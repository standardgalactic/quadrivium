About the Authors
Susannah Gardner is the co-founder and creative director of Hop Studios 
Internet Consultants (www.hopstudios.com), a web design company spe­
cializing in custom web solutions for content publishers.
Hop Studios brings an insightful concern for community building and 
editorial workflow to bear on each project — backed by solid design and 
interface interaction skills. The company builds many types of sites, but 
specializes in those with copious, rapidly changing content or with a strong 
journalism, education, or editorial component (like blogs!). 
Susannah is also a freelance writer and author; she is the author of Blogging 
For Dummies, 2nd Edition, Blogging For Dummies, 3rd Edition, Buzz Marketing 
with Blogs For Dummies, co-author of BitTorrent For Dummies, Dreamweaver 
MX 2004 For Dummies, and Teach Yourself Visually: Dreamweaver MX 2004, all 
from John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
Prior to running Hop Studios, Susannah worked in the Online Journalism 
and Communication Program at the University of Southern California, 
writing curriculum, teaching, and conducting research at the intersection of 
technology and journalism. She was a senior editor of the Online Journalism 
Review, the media industry’s only Internet-focused journalism publication. 
Susannah also spent four years at The Los Angeles Times, one of six editors 
responsible for launching that newspaper’s web site. During her time at 
LATimes.com she established the site’s multimedia lab, which produced 
ground-breaking web audio, video, and animation. She also launched and 
edited MetaHollywood, an online-only publication that covered new Hollywood 
technology and was LATimes.com’s single largest revenue source in 1998.
Susannah earned bachelor’s degrees in Print Journalism and American 
literature at USC. To learn more about her web design company, visit www.
hopstudios.com. 
Shane Birley is a Vancouver-based web developer, creative writer, and blog 
consultant with more than 15 years of experience in developing web sites. 
In January 2006, he cofounded Left Right Minds Initiatives with his partner 
Allyson McGrane.
Left Right Minds is a creative solutions company for nonprofit societies, char­
ities, and businesses. The business evolved from Shane’s work with develop­
ing web sites (through his previous company, Vicious Bunny Creative) and 
Allyson’s ongoing work with nonprofit arts groups. Both partners have expe­
rience giving workshops about their areas of expertise and in training others 
to use new technology and business skills. In addition to web development, 
the company manages and represents performing artists with the support of 
the Canada Council for The Arts.

As a partner in Left Right Minds, Shane is now working to develop web sites 
using content management systems that enable his clients to edit and update 
their own web content. He regularly gives workshops on blogging and did 
extensive research for BitTorrent For Dummies. Shane has a background in 
improvisational theatre and a B.A. in English — these qualifications enable 
him to translate difficult computing concepts into easy, plain language. To 
learn more about his web company, visit www.leftrightminds.com. He 
also writes a personal blog at www.shanesworld.ca.
Dedication
This edition is dedicated to the memory of Derek Miller, whose humor and 
courage while facing cancer were chronicled on his blog Penmachine (www.
penmachine.com). Derek died in May 2011. He is missed by so many in 
Vancouver and around the world.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Susannah: Another year, another edition, and this year there are so many 
more blogs out there! This year’s greatest thanks must go to all those 
dedicated and fascinating people who start blogs; there are more of you than 
anyone can keep track of, and our world is richer for all those viewpoints.
You, dear reader, are likely to join the ranks of those I just thanked, but you 
deserve some special attention for taking the journey to the blogging world 
by reading this book. I appreciate the opportunity to be a guide into this 
world that I enjoy so much. 
Shane Birley has helped me on every edition of Blogging For Dummies I have 
worked on, and is an invaluable writing partner. Get this, people — he meets 
deadlines! And he does so with cheerful aplomb, clean copy, and so far he 
hasn’t sent me an invoice either. Thanks, Shane.
The team at John Wiley & Sons are always great and this year is no exception. 
Amy Fandrei responds to e-mails almost before I write them, and Jean Nelson 
has been as easy an editor to work with as I can remember. Debbye Butler 
did a great job with the copyediting. There are so many others at Wiley who 
are part of getting a book like this finished, many of whom I don’t know by 
name. They are nonetheless appreciated.

It wouldn’t be a blogging book with my name on it if my technical editor 
wasn’t Paul Chaney. Paul has more enthusiasm for this industry than any 
other six people combined, which makes his corrections and suggestions not 
just tolerable but welcome. 
And then behind the scenes, there are all those in my work and personal life 
who understood the pressure of deadlines, provided caffeinated beverages 
and let me ask nosy questions about the blogs they read. My thanks go out 
especially to the ever-efficient Nancy Waldock, and my truly outstanding 
business and life partner Travis Smith. 
Shane: It has been a few years since the 3rd Edition of Blogging For Dummies, 
and I am quite happy to be helping out yet again. My first and hugest thanks 
goes out to Susannah for allowing me the opportunity to collaborate with her 
on this edition. She is an incredibly wicked-awesome person, and I am very 
thankful to count her as one of my good friends. I must also thank Jonathon 
Narvey who has helped me keep writing and has become one of my biggest 
fans — and I his. He has helped me get back into top writing form when I 
thought I couldn’t do it anymore.
Thanks to everyone on the Northern Voice committee — I love the 
opportunity to help create this annual personal blogging and social media 
conference (it happens every year in Vancouver, BC, you should come!). It 
keeps me honest and blogging at Shanesworld.ca. And a shout-out to the 
guys at Dyscultured, a tech and pop culture podcast who invited me to join 
their merry band. Not to mention the fabulous (and shorter than me) Monica 
Hamburg who hangs out with me for the S&M Rants podcast.
As always, I appreciate the love and support of my family: my mother who 
bought me my first TRS-80 computer, when I really wanted a Coleco video 
game console; my father who taught me everything about life, love, and the 
pursuit of great beer; and my sister, Kristen, who may be taller than me, but 
still knows I am the bigger and older brother and I will always know more 
than her.
My biggest thanks goes to Allyson McGrane, my partner in crime, life, and 
just about everything else. She was incredibly supportive in helping to 
proofread, listening to me report on all the latest blog technologies, and most 
of all, walking our pugs Serendipity and Faith when I was focused on getting 
the next paragraph down on paper.
I am sure I have forgotten some people but you know who you are and I 
thank you.

Introduction
A

llow me to be the first to welcome you to the blogosphere, an exciting 
and energetic space online that people are using to reach out, build 
communities, and express themselves. Blogging For Dummies, 4th Edition, 
is designed to help you through the process of starting a blog quickly, and 
it gives you the tools you need to make the most of your experience in the 
blogosphere. The entire book is updated and includes several new chapters 
since the last edition. Keeping pace with the World Wide Web is a challenge!
This book is designed to be useful for all kinds of bloggers, whether you’re 
the CEO of a major corporation or a hobbyist with a passion for communicat­
ing. I focus on what makes a blog work — and how a blog can work for you. 
Also, I realize that not everyone has the technical skills necessary to start a 
blog, so I provide options for all levels of experience.
This book is useful to you, whether you’re taking part in the conversations 
in the world of blogs or becoming a blogger yourself. I cover everything 
from technology to legal issues, so you can go forward knowing you have a 
resource that covers every aspect of this exciting medium.
About This Book
Whether you’re building a blog as a rank beginner or redesigning an existing 
blog to make it better, you can find everything you need in these pages. The 
fact that you’re holding this book likely means you have some ideas about 
starting a blog — and I want to get you started right away! 
The first part of the book gets you blogging quickly and safely. Chapter 1 
introduces you to blogging, Chapter 2 walks you through the world that is 
the blogosphere, and Chapter 3 helps you choose the software and tools you 
need to get started. In Chapter 4, I show you the fastest and easiest way to 
get started immediately with your very own blog.
However, you don’t have to memorize this book or even read it in order. 
Feel free to skip straight to the chapter with the information you need and 
come back to the beginning later. Each chapter is designed to give you easy 
answers and guidance, accompanied by step-by-step instructions for specific 
tasks.

Blogging For Dummies, 4th Edition 
I include sidebars that give you more information, but you don’t need to read 
those sidebars if you’re short on time. Technical Stuff icons also indicate 
helpful extras that you can come back to when you have more time.
Conventions Used in This Book
Keeping things consistent makes them easier to understand. In this book, 
those consistent elements are conventions. Notice how the word conventions 
is in italics? That’s a convention I use frequently. I put new terms in italics 
and then define them so that you know what they mean.
URLs (web addresses) or e-mail addresses in text look like this: www.blogging
fordummiesbook.com. Sometimes, however, I use the full URL, like this: 
http://traction.tractionsoftware.com/traction because the URL is 
unusual or lacks the www prefix.
Most web browsers today don’t require the introductory http:// for web 
addresses, though, so you don’t have to type it in.
Foolish Assumptions
Just because blogs have a funny name doesn’t mean they have to be writ­
ten by funny people — or even humorous ones! If you can write an e-mail, 
you can write a blog. Have confidence in yourself and realize that blogs are 
an informal medium that forgives mistakes unless you try to hide them. In 
keeping with the philosophy behind the For Dummies series, this book is an 
easy-to-use guide designed for readers with a wide range of experience. Being 
interested in blogs is all that I expect from you.
If you’re new to blogs, this book gets you started and walks you step by step 
through all the skills and elements you need to create a successful web log. If 
you’ve been reading and using blogs for some time now, this book is an ideal 
reference that can help you ensure that you’re doing the best job possible 
with any blog that you start or manage.
I do expect that you aren’t tackling starting a blog without having some basic 
computer knowledge under your belt, not to mention a computer on your 
desk (or, uh, lap!). If you’re still figuring out how to use your computer or 
don’t have access to an Internet connection, keep this book for a time when 
you’re more able to put your computer and the Internet to work for you.
That said, you don’t need to know much more than how to use a web 
browser, open and create files on your computer, and get connected to the 
Internet, so you don’t need to be a computer genius, either.

 Introduction
How This Book Is Organized
To ease you through the process of building a blog, I organized this book 
to be a handy reference. The following sections provide a breakdown of the 
parts of the book and what you can find in each one. Each chapter walks you 
through a different aspect of blogging, providing tips and helping you under­
stand the vocabulary of web logs.
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs
This part introduces you to the general concepts of blogging, including actu­
ally starting a blog today. In Chapter 1, I show you some good blogs and give 
you background about this young industry. You can find out what’s involved 
in creating a blog and take a quick tour of what works in a blog and what 
doesn’t.
While reading Chapter 2, you find guidance on how your friends, family, and 
business colleagues might react to your new blog. If you’re interested in blog­
ging frankly, you might want to read this chapter before you start criticizing 
your boss or writing about your personal life online.
In Chapter 3, you make a big decision: what blogging software you want to 
use. I explain what your options are and how to find blog software that has 
the features and extras you need. Chapter 3 also helps you choose a domain 
name and a web host so that you can install your own blog software and con­
trol every aspect of the blogging experience.
Part II: Setting Up Your Blog
In Chapter 4, you can jump right into a real blog and start a hosted Blogger 
blog. Sign up in ten minutes and have fun putting up text, links, and images. It 
really is that easy.
Chapters 5 and 6 are devoted to helping you start blogging in two other for­
mats. Chapter 5 covers setting up and blogging with WordPress, a software 
application that you install on your own server. And Chapter 6 is all about 
blogging with the popular Tumblr hosted blog software.
Together, these chapters give you step-by-step instructions for both starting 
up a new blog and adding blog posts, images, and other fun stuff to the blog 
you start. If you read no other chapters in this book, read these three!

Blogging For Dummies, 4th Edition 
Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good
Part III is dedicated to making sure you know how to get the most out of your 
blog while meeting the needs of your audience. In Chapter 7, you can work on 
figuring out just what your topic is and how best to produce content around 
your subject. I even give you tips on dealing with writer’s block.
In Chapter 8, you can define your audience and work on targeting your blog 
content to reach that group most effectively — and keep readers coming 
back for more.
Chapter 9 helps you avoid a common blog problem: spam. Discover the tricks 
every blogger must know to keep ads for enhancing intimate body organs 
from dominating their comment areas. More than that, however, Chapter 9 
tells you how to cultivate a community of interaction and conversation on 
your blog.
Chapter 10 is a new addition to this edition of Blogging For Dummies. If you 
are wondering how to blog anonymously (and I won’t ask why!), this chapter 
is a handy starting point for knowing how to assess the risks and make the 
technical adjustments necessary.
Part IV: Going Beyond Words
In Part IV, you find a series of chapters that help you dress up your blog with 
style and neat technological tools. In Chapter 11, you can find out how to 
make the most of photos and other graphics in your blog. Did you know that 
adding a photo to your blog post makes more people read it? It’s true!
If you can’t say it with a photo, say it with your mouth by creating a podcast 
as I explain in Chapter 12. Everyong, from the newest blogger to the seasoned 
professional, can use this exciting area of the blogosphere to make them­
selves heard.
In Chapter 13, I introduce you the idea of adding a forum, or bulletin board, 
to your blog. This conversational medium is a great adjunct to the dialogue 
that happens in your blog comments, but gives your visitors a little more 
freedom in directing that conversation.
Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog
Make your blog and yourself known on the Internet and in the blogosphere 
by using the tools described in Part V. In Chapter 14, you can find out what 
the heck RSS is and how you can use it to direct traffic to your blog. Not only

that, but you can also use RSS yourself to read other blogs quickly and find 
out what others are saying about you.
Twitter is showing up everywhere, even in sitcoms. In Chapter 15, get familiar 
with this easy tool for keeping in touch with friends, family, and even your 
colleagues. You can dive in to the depths of social networking in Chapter 16. 
You may find more going on with Facebook than you think!
Chapter 17 helps you use statistics and traffic-tracking tools to discover more 
about your audience members and how they’re using your blog.
Part VI: Getting Business-y with It
Part VI drills down to the business of . . . uh . . . business! 
If you’ve ever thought that you ought to be able to make a little money with 
your blog, then Chapter 18 is for you. Find out how to put ads on your blog, 
form relationships with sponsors, and use affiliate programs to make a buck.
If you’re a corporate CEO or small-business owner, then Chapter 19 is a must-
read. In this chapter, I show you how businesses, nonprofit groups, and other 
organizations are making use of blogs to form relationships with clients and 
customers.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
In The Part of Tens, you can discover ten ways to increase the community 
interaction on your blog, ten indispensible tips for mobile bogging, and best of 
all, ten outstanding blogs that make the most of technology and the Internet.
Part VIII: Appendixes
Blogs, sidebars, blogrolls, RSS — this medium has more jargon than you 
can shake a stick at. I define new terms in each chapter so that you know 
what’s going on when you start blogging, and you can always consult the 
glossary in Appendix A for definitions of all those weird blog terms that 
have sprung up in recent years. Don’t let a few acronyms keep you from 
enjoying the blogosphere! 
In Appendix B, you can get the goods on writing your own HTML code. 
Happily, you don’t need to do much of that on a blog (unless you want to)!

Blogging For Dummies, 4th Edition 
Icons Used in This Book
Here’s a rundown of the icons I use in this book:
	
The Remember icon reminds you of an important concept or procedure to 
store away in your memory bank for future use.
	
The Technical Stuff icon signals technical stuff that you might find informa­
tive and interesting, but that you don’t need to know to develop the blogs 
described in this book. Feel free to skip over these sections if you don’t like 
the techy stuff.
	
Tips indicate a trick or technique that can save you time and money — or 
possibly a headache.
	
The Warning icon warns you of any potential pitfalls — and gives you the all-
important information about how to avoid them.
Where to Go from Here
Turn to Chapter 1 to dive in and get started with an intro to blogs and an over­
view of why this medium is so exciting for so many people. If you just want to 
get started blogging today, read over Chapter 4. Otherwise, spend some time 
thinking about the best blog software solution for your situation — which you 
can read more about in Chapter 3. Already have a blog, but want to do more 
with it? I think Chapter 8’s coverage of great content might be a great place to 
dive in. Don’t forget to send me your efforts: I can’t wait to see your blog! Drop 
me an e-mail at susie@bloggingfordummiesbook.com.

y now, you’ve probably heard the word blog tossed around by all kinds 
of people, seen it show up in news stories or cited on TV news broad­
casts, or you may even have a child, friend, or coworker who has a blog. 
Bloggers are showing up inside businesses, and businesses are even using 
blogs to reach out to their customers. But what exactly do all these people 
mean when they say they have a blog? And what does a blog written by a 
teenager have in common with one written by a CEO?
Don’t be too hard on yourself if you aren’t exactly sure what a blog is. The 
word blog is actually a mash-up of two other words — web and log — so if it 
sounds made up, that’s because it is. At its most basic level, a blog is a chron­
ologically ordered series of website updates, written and organized much like 
a traditional diary, right down to the informal style of writing that character­
izes personal communication.
In this chapter, you find out just what makes a blog bloggy and why so many 
people are outfitting themselves with one like it’s the latest celebrity fashion 
trend. (Hint: It’s not just that we’re all narcissists!) You can get some ideas 
that you can use to start your own blog and become part of the blogosphere 
(the community of blogs and bloggers around the world).
No matter what your teenager tells you, the blogosphere has absolutely no 
requirement that you must write your blog while wearing your pajamas. Also, 
you’re allowed to use a spellchecker.

Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
Making Yourself Comfortable with Blogs
I talk to a lot of people about blogs, many of whom know that you can find a 
blog on the World Wide Web, but who also have the impression that all blogs 
are written by navel-gazing cranks with an axe to grind or by 12-year-old 
girls. Some blogs really are diaries in which the blogger records the minutiae 
of day-to-day life — but blogs can be much more than that, and all kinds of 
people write them.
One of my favorite blogs (see Figure 1-1) falls into the personal diary cate­
gory: Mimi Smartypants (http://mimismartypants.com). A woman living 
in Chicago writes this blog, which records her thoughts and activities with 
such hilarious prose that I often find myself laughing out loud when I read 
her posts.
Think of a blog this way: It’s a kind of website. All blogs are websites (the 
opposite isn’t true, though), and neither the content nor the creator makes 
a blog a blog — the presentation does. A blog can be many things: a diary, a 
news source, a photo gallery, or even a corporate marketing tool. Blog con­
tent can include text, photos, audio, and even video, and bloggers talk about 
nearly any subject that you can imagine.

 Chapter 1: Discovering Blog Basics
	
One of the reasons blogs have become such a popular way of publishing a 
website is because they’re particularly good at generating high search-engine 
rankings. If you have a blog, it’s more likely than a standard website to come 
up high in lists of search results for the topics you discuss. The reason? Your 
posts are fresh and recent. Search engines give an extra boost to web pages 
that have the most recently updated or created content related to the key­
words that someone is searching for. And better search-engine listings mean 
more visitors, more readers, more comments, and a more vibrant community. 
Individuals and companies have taken advantage of the blog medium to reach 
out to web users.
How people use blogs
With millions of blogs in the world — the blog search engine Technorati 
(http://technorati.com) tracks more than 1 million blogs — it’s obvious 
that blogging is a popular and successful format for publishing a website. But 
just what are people doing with blogs? They can’t all be talking about their 
cats!
And they aren’t. Bloggers are using the blog format to communicate effec­
tively in all kinds of information spheres, from the personal to the profes­
sional. In fact, many blogs serve multiple purposes at the same time, mixing 
posts about activities at home with news pertaining to work. Your blog can 
serve many purposes in your life.
Documenting your life
A lot of folks use blogs for the same reason they might keep a diary — to 
chronicle their lives and activities. This urge to communicate appears in all 
kinds of mediums, from scrapbooking to taking digital photographs. If you’re 
interested in sharing personal details with others, a blog gives you a fast, effi­
cient way to do so.
If you send holiday newsletters every year or e-mail a group of friends and 
family to let them know about exciting events in your life, you can have a lot 
of fun with a blog. You can blog as often as you want, and your readers visit 
when they’re ready to get more information. Best of all, each blog post gives 
your friends and family a quick way to respond to you; they only have to 
leave a comment on your blog post. You might find you’re talking more with 
your family than ever before!
	
You don’t have to buy or find the postage stamps either, so keeping in touch 
through your blog is inexpensive and less time-consuming than snail mail. And 
no more envelope glue to lick.

Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
Of course, not all lives come up roses every day; they can’t all be wed­
ding and travel blogs. Personal blogs can be intense when they document 
rough times. Steve Sheldon (http://lymphomania.wordpress.com), a 
Vancouver-based blogger, uses his blog Lymphomania, shown in Figure 1-2, 
to document his experiences with lymphoma. He explains how the blog has 
been part of his journey:
“. . . I have lymphoma, and as scary as it’s been, it’s also been a great 
learning experience; learning how amazing the people around me are, 
how I can handle such a life-changing event, and learning about the dis­
ease and the treatment.
I want to use this blog as a way to vocalise everything that is going 
through my head as I am on this journey, it seems a little narcissistic, 
but by externalising to an audience, it’s really helping me cope with the 
stress of it all, and who knows, maybe some of you will learn something 
about the disease, in which case; Mission accomplished!”

In your eagerness to let your friends know about what you’re up to, don’t 
forget that anyone in the world can access a blog (unlike a real diary or 
scrapbook), now and in the future. Don’t publish anything that you might find

embarrassing in the future, and have the same consideration when you talk 
about others or use photographs.
Exploring a hobby or passion
If you have a passion or hobby that you just love to talk about, consider 
doing so in a blog. Anyone who shares your interest is a potential reader and 
is bound to be looking for more information wherever he or she can find it.
You can detail your own experiences, offer advice to others, drum up sup­
port for whatever you like to do, or just talk about what you love. Best of all, 
you might be able to make connections with others who share your infatua­
tion, making friends and finding ways to get involved with your hobby more 
deeply.
Cybele May runs a blog about something she loves: candy. Candy Blog (www.
candyblog.net) is her personal labor of love and a great excuse to buy a 
lot of candy! Cybele reviews candies, writing extensive descriptions of taste, 
texture, and ingredients for fellow sugar enthusiasts. And they respond! 
Nearly every review garners comments from fans and critics of the candies 
that Cybele samples. Check out Candy Blog in Figure 1-3.

Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
Sharing information
Sometimes, a blog is all about sharing information. Journalists use blogs to 
report on local, national, and international news; critics and commentators use 
the medium to state their opinions and predictions. Educators keep parents 
and students abreast of classroom happenings and dates. Coworkers let col­
leagues in geographically distant offices know what’s going on in relation to 
collaborative projects. The uses of the informational blog are really limitless.
The popular blog Boing Boing (www.boingboing.net) is a great example 
of an information-sharing blog. Self-described as a “directory of wonderful 
things,” Boing Boing’s several contributors are dedicated to keeping you up 
to date on all the weird and wonderful websites in the world. A selection of 
posts from August 2009 described the Nano Air Vehicle (it has wings, like 
insects do), a mouse who had made its home in an Oregon ATM, and a link 
to creating your own “Achingly Self-Referential Virtual Commodity Fetish 
Objects.” This site is truly a random collection of news and links, perfect for 
the eclectic consumer of trivia.
Another popular information blog is TechCrunch (www.techcrunch.com). 
This guide to everything Internet covers everything from new companies to 
the latest geek gadgets and, of course, offers a lot of information about soft­
ware. You might not find every post useful, but if you’re trying to keep up 
with the breakneck pace of technological innovation on the Internet, you may 
find TechCrunch (shown in Figure 1-4) and blogs like it invaluable resources.
Making money
You spend a lot of time producing your blog, and a lot of people read it. Why 
not turn those eyes into dollars? That’s a question many a popular blogger 
has asked, and you can make it happen in several ways.
The most common technique involves including advertisements on your 
blog pages. For example, Google AdSense (www.google.com/adsense) pro­
vides in-page advertising that’s designed to match the content of your blog 
and therefore be of interest to your readers. Each time a visitor to your blog 
clicks one of these advertising links, you earn money from Google. I talk more 
about making money from advertising programs, affiliate links, sponsorships, 
and more in Chapter 18.
Of course, companies haven’t missed out on the fact that blogs can help 
them drum up interest in their products and services, or inform and connect 
with consumers. Many companies, small and large, have added blogs to their 
websites, and they use the blogs to start conversations with their customers 
and potential customers. In many cases, use of the informal voice of the blog 
medium has helped customers understand that real people work in these 
organizations. This personal connection gives the company better credibility 
and often adds to customers’ recognition of that company and its values in 
the marketplace.

General Motors, Google, and Sun Microsystems all have company blogs, 
giving readers a peek inside the corporate culture of what might otherwise be 
fairly faceless monoliths. 
Southwest has taken this approach (www.blogsouthwest.com). On the 
blog’s About page, Southwest says, “Our goal with the new Nuts About 
Southwest remains to give our readers the opportunity to take a look inside 
Southwest Airlines and to interact with us.” Southwest tries to make sure 
that the blog represents a lot of voices inside the company, from managers 
to captains — even the president of the company. As with personal blogs, 
the tone is light and conversational, making the company seem friendly and 
accessible.
Recognizing a blog
You’ve probably seen a blog online already. Because the blogger isn’t 
required to put a big This Is a Blog! sticker at the top of the page, you might 
not have realized that you were looking at a blog. With a little practice and 
familiarity with standard blog elements, though, you can identify any blog in 
a snap.

Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
Regardless of what the blog is about or who writes it, every blog features
	
✓	Frequent updates: Most bloggers update their blogs a few times a week; 
some bloggers even update them a few times a day. Blogs don’t have 
a schedule for publishing; the blogger simply updates the blog when it 
seems appropriate.
	
✓	Posts or entries: Each time a blogger updates the blog, he or she creates 
a blog post, or entry, that he or she then adds to the blog.
	
✓	Permalinks: Each time a blogger adds a post to his or her blog, that post 
appears on the blog’s home page. At the same time, blog software cre­
ates a permalink page to contain only that blog post and its comments. 
(The word permalink is short for “permanent link.”) Permalink pages 
are a big part of why blogs do so well with search engines — every post 
adds a new page to your website and provides another opportunity for 
your blog to come up as a search result.
	
✓	Chronological order: When a blogger writes a new blog post, that post 
appears at the top of the blog’s first page. The next time the blogger 
writes a post, it shows up at the top, and the older posts move down the 
page.
	
✓	Comments: Most (though not all) blogs allow readers to leave 
comments — short text messages — in response to blog posts. Comments 
really differentiate a blog from most websites by encouraging interaction 
and conversation.
	
✓	Archives: Because blogs are updated so frequently, bloggers often sort 
their blogs into a date-based archive so that readers can find older infor­
mation easily.
	
✓	Categories: Bloggers can sort posts by subjects or categories, which 
allows a blogger to blog about a number of different topics and lets read­
ers focus in on the topics that most interest them.
Blog anatomy: Dissecting a typical blog
In this section, I give you a tour of the usual blog elements by using baker 
Rose Levy Beranbaum’s blog, Real Baking with Rose Levy Beranbaum (www.
realbakingwithrose.com). Rose’s blog has all the usual features that I 
discuss in this section, as shown in Figure 1-5 — and a few more bells and 
whistles as well.

Most blogs — no matter what topic they cover — look quite similar because 
the elements of one blog are common to all blogs. Rose’s is no exception.

Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
Those common elements are:
	
✓	Branding/logo header: A header at the top of the blog displays the name 
of the blog, often including a logo or other visual element. This header 
is visible on every page of the blog, identifying it, even to a visitor who 
visits one of the interior pages without first going to the home page. In 
Figure 1-5, the header contains the name of the blog, a photo of Rose, 
and the blog’s navigation — the links to the different parts of her site.
	
✓	Most recent posts: At the top of the blog’s home page, the most recent 
post appears. While you scroll down the home page, you see the next 
most recent post, and the next most recent post, and so on. New posts 
are always at the top, making it easy to find the latest, freshest infor­
mation when you visit. Most blogs display around a dozen recent blog 
posts on the first page of the blog, and to read older posts, you can visit 
the archives.
	
✓	Post information: Along with each entry, blog software displays infor­
mation about the post. This sort of post information typically appears — 
but a blogger doesn’t have to include it. A blog might be missing an ele­
ment or two that I list or have others that I don’t mention:
 
• The date and time the post was published.
 
• The name of the post’s author. On blogs that have multiple 
authors, the visitor may find this info especially valuable.
 
• The number of comments on the post. 
Blogging through the ages
The concept behind a blog isn’t new; after all, 
people have been keeping diaries and journals 
since the invention of the written word. Even 
on the web, diary websites existed long before 
anyone used the word blog.
No one really knows when the first true blog 
was created, but estimates put the date around 
1994. The term weblog came into existence in 
1997, and it was quickly shortened to the more 
colloquial blog. If you want to read more about 
the history of blogging, read author Rebecca 
Blood’s essay on the early days of blogging 
at www.rebeccablood.net/essays/
weblog_history.html.
No one can really measure the number of 
blogs in the world, for a number of technical 
reasons and because blogs can be short-lived 
(accidentally or deliberately). All studies of 
numbers, however, indicate that the number of 
blogs increases dramatically every month. For 
example, in May 2007, the blog search engine 
Technorati (www.technorati.com) was 
tracking 75 million blogs; by July 2007, that 
number was 94 million.

• A link to the permalink page, usually labeled Permalink. 
Sometimes, you can both read and write comments on the perma­
link page.
 
• The category in which the blogger has placed the post. In Figure 
1-5, the category of the top post is Special Stories.
 
• Other links to bells and whistles unique to the blog, such as the 
links to Send to a Friend (which allows you to quickly e-mail the 
post to a friend) or Print.
	
✓	Sidebar material: Most blogs are laid out in two or three columns, with 
the most real estate given to the column that contains the blog posts 
themselves. The second and/or third columns display organizational 
material for the blog and peripheral information. Some blogs don’t have 
sidebars at all, and on some blogs, you may see elements that I don’t 
mention in the following list of typical sidebar components:
 
• Date-based archives: Nearly every blog archives a post when the 
blogger publishes that post, both by date and by category. In the 
sidebar of a blog, you can usually access both archive methods. 
Figure 1-6 shows the date-based archives of Rose’s blog, broken 
down by month. Date-based archives can also show weeks and 
years.
	
Figure 1-6:

based 
archive.

author of The Cake Bible 
(William Morrow).
 
• Categorized archives: Figure 1-7 shows the category archives of 
Real Baking with Rose Levy Beranbaum. By sorting each post into a 
category at the time that she publishes it, Rose creates an archive 
organized by subject, making it easy for you to find the posts that 
most interest you. Clicking a category link displays only the posts 
in that subject area, organized in reverse chronological order.
 
• Blogroll: A blogroll is a list of other blogs that the blogger finds 
interesting or useful. By including the blogs and websites that Rose 
likes to read on her blog, she can direct her readers to other inter­
esting websites (see Figure 1-8). And who knows, those sites may 
return the favor, sending their visitors to her site.

• Information about the author: Because blogs are so personal, some­
times you want to know more about who’s writing them. Many 
bloggers know their readers are curious, and those bloggers put 
together short bios and other information for readers. Bloggers 
sometimes display this information in the sidebar or link to it, like 
in Figure 1-9.

• RSS feed link: Readers can use RSS, or Really Simple Syndication, 
to subscribe to your blog by using a newsreader, such as Google 
Reader. After a reader subscribes via RSS, he or she can read the 
latest updates via the newsreader instead of visiting your blog. So, 
your readers don’t have to visit your blog several times a day to 
see whether you’ve updated it. A blog often includes an RSS link 
(identified by a small orange icon, as shown in Figure 1-10) near 
the bottom of the sidebar. I talk more about RSS in Chapter 13.

Starting a Blog
One reason that so many blogs exist is that you can set them up and publish 
them so easily. The early days of the Internet were full of heady talk about 
the democratization of publishing; people discussed how absolutely anyone 
would have the power to publish because of the prevalence of personal com­
puters. In fact, that idea wasn’t strictly true. Writers no longer needed a print­
ing press and a distribution method to get their work to people, but they still 
needed specialized skills and technology.

Unless the wannabe publisher spent time figuring out how to write HTML, 
owned a computer that had an Internet connection, and understood how to 
put files onto a web server, he or she was still pretty much in the old can’t-
get-published boat. You could acquire those skills and the tools to publish, 
but you couldn’t do so easily.
The answer, as it turns out, comes down to technology — specifically, soft­
ware. I believe blogging goes a long way toward making that initial promise of 
the web come true. If you can write an e-mail, you can figure out how to use 
the simple interfaces of blogging software without any of the muss of dealing 
with HTML, FTP, or any of those other awful web acronyms everyone’s sup­
posed to understand these days.
Figure 1-11 shows the publishing interface of Blogger (www.blogger.com), 
a great blogging software tool. To write a new post, you simply log into 
Blogger, fill in the blanks for a new post, and click the Publish Post button to 
put the entry on your blog.

Different blog software offer different feature sets. Like with all software, the 
tricky part is finding the right one to use for your situation and needs. I can 
assure you, however, blogging software comes in all shapes, sizes, and price

ranges. In Chapter 3, I talk extensively about choosing the right software solu­
tion for your blog. Chapter 4 shows you how to start a blog in about ten min­
utes by using Blogger, and Chapter 5 walks you through the details of using 
WordPress. In Chapter 6 you can try out a microblog using Tumblr. 
Choosing What to Blog About
You can find blog topics all over the map. If you haven’t already read a blog, 
follow these simple steps to find one and read it, which is the best possible 
way to become familiar with the medium:
	
1.	Open your web browser and go to www.technorati.com.
	
2.	Type any search term that you’re interested in reading about into the 
search box at the top of the page.
	
	 For example, you might enjoy reading a blog written by someone with 
whom you share a hobby, such as knitting or parasailing. Or try a search 
term that describes what you do for a living; if you’re an accountant, for 
example, you might search for tax regulations. You can also search for 
something that can help you accomplish a task, such as buying a house 
or finding out how to paint.
	
3.	Click Blog or Posts to filter the search results as you desire. I find 
Posts gives me more interesting results.
	
4.	Click Search (the magnifying glass button to the right of the search 
box).
	
	 Technorati returns a list of recent blog posts that used your search 
term. When I searched for knitting, for example, Technorati showed 
me a blog post by someone who just bought some new yarn for making 
socks, one about a recipe for a knitting-themed birthday cake, and 
another post by someone who was frustrated with a pattern.
	
5.	Find a blog post that looks interesting and click the URL to visit the 
blog and read more.
	
6.	Repeat Steps 1 through 5, as needed, until you find a blog that you 
enjoy!
You can find blogs on so many topics that you can’t help but find something 
interesting, whether it engages you professionally or personally. I read blogs 
on all kinds of topics that interest me, from (surprise) knitting to the arts to 
real estate.

Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
The blog format is exceptionally well-suited to letting you explore an idea, 
a hobby, or a project — but don’t let that stop you from using it for other 
things. People have created blogs to pass along marketing expertise, sell 
shoes, cover the latest celebrity gossip, raise funds for bike rides, and even 
write books. The topic or topics that you write about should excite you and 
hold your interest, and they can be about absolutely anything.
Having that much freedom can be a little scary and, if you’re like me, can 
leave you with an absolute blank in your mind. No problem; you can start a 
blog today about one topic, and when you actually figure out what you want 
to write about, change directions and go down another road. It’s a very flex­
ible format!
	
Think about the following tips when you start a blog:
	
✓	Choose a subject that genuinely interests you. Don’t choose a topic 
only because you think being interested in it makes you look good or 
you think that it’ll attract a lot of readers. You’re the one who has to do 
the writing for the blog, and you can do that writing a lot more easily if 
you’re enthusiastic about your subject. Your passion shines through to 
your readers and keeps them coming back.
	
✓	Decide whether any topics are off limits. Bloggers who keep personal 
diaries for their friends and families might decide to keep certain sub­
jects out of the public forum of the Internet. For example, do you really 
want your significant other reading a frank account of last night’s dinner 
preparation argument? How about your mom or your boss?
	
✓	Think about your potential readers. Who are they? How can you appeal 
to them and get them to keep reading your blog? Do you even care about 
how many readers you have? If you do, what do you want to show, 
explain, or ask them?
Creating a Successful Blog
Blogs are so quick and easy to set up that you can start one without having 
much of a plan in place for what you want to blog about, why you’re blogging, 
or what you’re trying to accomplish. Some people thrive on this kind of wide-
open playing field, but others quickly become bored (or boring!).
To get your blog started on the right foot, think seriously about why you’re 
blogging, and then make a commitment to attaining your goals. Don’t get me 
wrong — this isn’t a job! But, just as you wouldn’t expect good results from a 
dinner prepared without paying any attention to ingredients, you can’t start 
your blog without having a recipe for success.

 Chapter 1: Discovering Blog Basics
Here’s my recipe for a good blog:
	
1.	 Preheat the oven by setting goals.
	
2.	 Measure out several cups of good writing.
	
3.	 Mix well with frequent updates.
	
4.	 Sprinkle in a lot of interaction with your readers.
	
Watching how someone else blogs is a great way of finding out how to be 
successful yourself! Keep track of how the blogs you enjoy are keeping you 
interested: Take note of how often the blogger updates his or her blog, the 
writing style, and which posts you find most engaging and get you to leave a 
comment. 
Setting goals
Just like you have many different reasons to blog, you have many ways to 
create a successful blog. Don’t forget that your goals and plans might not be 
the same as another blogger’s. Do think about what your goals are and keep 
those goals in mind when you start your blog.
The following are ways that you might define a successful blog:
	
✓	Numbers: Many bloggers are eager to attract readers to their blogs, and 
they define success by the number of people who visit every day.
	
✓	Comments: Some bloggers find the interaction with readers in the com­
ment area of the blog very gratifying. For these bloggers, getting a com­
ment every day or on every post might mean they’re successful.
	
✓	Results: Many bloggers start their blog in order to accomplish a task 
(such as raising money for a charity), to sell a product, or even to get a 
book contract (blogs have done all these things). When these bloggers 
meet their goal, they know they’ve succeeded!
When you start your blog, take time to think about how you define success. 
Do you want to help your entire family keep in touch? Do you want to let your 
friends back home know more about your college experience? Are you start­
ing a company and trying to get attention in the media? Consider writing your 
goals into your very first blog post and then returning to that post every few 
months to see whether your goals have changed and to remind yourself of 
what you’re trying to accomplish.

Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
Writing well
Many people think that blogs are poorly written, misspelled, and full of 
grammatical no-no’s such as incomplete sentences. Most criticism has at 
least some basis in reality, and this case is no different. Many bloggers do 
write their blogs very casually, paying only cursory attention to spelling 
and grammar.
For many, this informality is part of the charm of the format. Readers find 
the colloquial, conversational tone accessible and easy to read, and bloggers 
who write informally seem approachable and friendly.
I’m not making an excuse, however, for ignoring all the rules of writing. Well-
written and correctly spelled blogs attract readers just as often (perhaps 
more often) as those that aren’t. You can develop a friendly, personal way of 
writing without losing touch with the dictionary. I encourage the use of spell­
checking, even for very informal blogs intended for friends and family.
	
For a professional blog, don’t even consider writing without paying attention 
to spelling and grammar. Your readers will roll their eyes, and your competi­
tors will get a good snicker out of it.
	
Most importantly, however, think through your writing and consider your 
readers. Take the time to practice and develop a voice that sounds personal 
and conversational while still qualifying as good, engaging writing. Don’t let 
the chatty style of a blog fool you: The best bloggers spend just as much time 
writing a casual blog post as they would a work memo.
You can find tips on how to develop your voice in Chapter 7.
Posting frequently
Commit yourself to writing new posts on your blog frequently. Ah, frequently 
is such a deceptive little word — because really, what does it mean?
For some people, frequently means every day. For others, it means three 
times a day. If you want a blog that doesn’t eat up every spare moment in 
your life but that you still update often enough to keep people interested, 
define the word frequently as at least two or three times a week. (If you want 
to blog more often than that, go to town.) This number of updates strikes a 
good balance for most blogs.

 Chapter 1: Discovering Blog Basics
	
Many bloggers use a little trick to account for periods of writer’s block or for 
when they go on vacation: They write posts ahead of time and then save them 
for later. Using your blog software, you can schedule a date and time for a 
post to go live, making it possible for you keep your readers entertained, even 
while you’re having an appendectomy or basking on a beach in Hawaii.
You also need to pace yourself. In the first heady days of having a blog, the 
posts flow freely and easily, but after a few months, you might find it difficult 
to be creative.
Interacting with comments
Comments make blogs really different from a website; the opportunity to 
interact and converse with the creator of a website and with other readers is 
almost unique to blogs. 
	
Forums, also called bulletin boards, offer one way to engage in online con­
versation on the web, but they aren’t as directed by regular posts as blogs. 
Everyone in the forum community is free to chime in with a topic or question. 
In fact, some bloggers have chosen to add forums to their blogs as a place for 
free-flowing conversation. I talk more about how this can work in Chapter 13.
Visitors to a blog have the opportunity to leave a comment on each post. 
Sometimes, readers leave comments in reaction to what they read; other 
times, they might offer a suggestion or pose a question. Because any reader 
can leave a comment, readers may leave comments about other comments!
Blog posts often include a link directly below each post, indicating how many 
comments readers have left. Clicking this link takes you to a page that dis­
plays the post, any comments that readers have left about that post, and a 
form that you can use to leave your own comment.
After someone makes a comment, it appears in the Comments area of the 
blog, usually labeled with the comment writer’s name, along with the date 
and time that he or she left the comment. On some popular blogs, readers 
compete to see who can leave the first comment on a new blog post.
In Rose Levy Beranbaum’s blog Real Baking with Rose Levy Beranbaum 
(www.realbakingwithrose.com), Rose often responds to questions that 
readers ask by putting the answer in her blog post’s comments area. Rose’s 
comments have a shaded background that other comments don’t have (see 
Figure 1-12) and feature her personal avatar image.

Not every blog allows comments. Many popular bloggers find that they’re 
overwhelmed by the sheer volume of responses that they get and must turn 
off comments because they can’t keep up with them. We should all be so 
lucky to have that problem. For most bloggers, comments are an important 
way to develop a dialogue with readers.
	
I recommend you keep comments turned on in your blog. They’re an easy 
way to involve your audience in your topic and to get valuable feedback about 
what you’re doing with your blog.
	
Unfortunately, spammers can take advantage of comments as easily as they 
can send you unwanted e-mail. If you keep comments turned on, you get 
unwanted comments that have commercial messages, unless you take preven­
tive measures (which is becoming easier to do). You or your readers might 
even find some spam comments offensive, just like some kinds of spam e-mail. 
If you decide to allow comments on your blog, be sure to read them and delete 
inappropriate messages. Your readers will thank you. In Chapter 9, I talk at 
length about encouraging comments — and dealing with those comments that 
you don’t want.

 Chapter 1: Discovering Blog Basics
Designing for Success
Blog design is a very personal experience. The decisions you make about 
how your blog looks are just as important as the technology that you choose 
to run your blog and what you choose to put on it. Because the web is an 
ever-evolving medium, no solid rules exist that tell you what you should or 
shouldn’t do with your blog. But you can follow guidelines to keep your best 
foot forward.
The blog that you’re starting is a reflection of you and your professional life. 
Even if your blog is for personal expression, it represents who you are. So, 
make sure that you have a good handle on how you want to present yourself 
to the world. If pink bunnies say everything you need, you should have pink 
bunnies. And if you need to look more corporate, you should avoid the pink 
bunnies — unless you sell Easter baskets and egg dye.
If you’re blogging for business reasons, either on behalf of a company or to 
promote yourself, make sure that both the writing and design demonstrate 
the proper tone. Seek advice from bloggers like you and find out from friends 
and family just how they think your blog should look. Check out other blogs, 
especially blogs that reflect the same goals or tone you want to create. What 
does the design of those blogs say about the blogger and the blog content?
Whether you hire a designer for your blog, use a blog template, or try to 
make the design yourself, seek ways to make your blog stand out from the 
rest. If you’re a business, make sure that your logo appears on your blog. 
If you’re creating a personal blog, add your own photos. Even if you use a 
default template, you can often add an identifying graphic or element on the 
site that differentiates your blog from others.
	
Don’t be afraid to start small and plan to redesign later. You can grow into 
your big ideas when you’re sure that you know what you want, so take the 
time to look at what other blogs are doing while you make your plans.
Let your readers be your guide: If your mom visits your site and says that 
she can’t read it, find out why. If your friends start talking more about the 
annoying background color than your latest blog post, you have a problem. 
Just like you do with your content, keep the design focused on the readers to 
keep them coming back for more.
The average blog has four very distinct areas in which to place and customize 
content: logos, headers, sidebars, and footers. In a blog, each of these areas 
has a specific purpose. As more blogs have come into existence, these areas 
have developed in specific ways that can help you organize your content.

Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
Here’s some detail about each of these customizable areas:
	
✓	Logos: Getting a visitor’s attention on the Internet is a science in itself, 
and clean, crisp logos can hold a visitor’s interest long enough to get 
him or her to read some of your blog. Typically, a logo appears near the 
top of each blog page. Many logos include an illustrated element and a 
special font treatment of the blog name.
	
✓	Headers: The header of any blog contains a few elements. The first 
element should be, of course, the name of your blog. The title should 
explain what your blog talks about or who you are as the main writer. 
You can also throw into the header some form of navigation that can 
help your visitors find their way around and provide them with quick 
links to special areas that you want highlighted on your site. On many 
blogs, the logo also appears in the header. Like the name suggests, head­
ers appear at the top of blog pages.
	
✓	Sidebars: Sidebars usually become a major focus for a blog site. Sidebars 
are columns to the right or left (or both) of the main content area, and 
they contain elements such as navigational links, special highlighting 
graphics that point to social networking sites, lists of blogs that you 
read (blogrolls), archive links, or anything that you want to share with 
your visitors outside the context of a blog post. Sidebars usually appear 
on every page of your blog and look consistent from page to page. 
	
✓	Footers: Footers live at the bottom of each blog page, and sometimes 
they do nothing more than feature a copyright message. More advanced 
bloggers have expanded the use of footers to include a significant series 
of links to content within their sites. These links might lead to comments 
on the blog, recent posts, or posts that you particularly want to high­
light. The footer can feature parts of your blog that you want visitors to 
find easily.

f you put something on your blog, anyone can read it. Blogs, like all web­
sites, are accessible anywhere in the world at any time, and anyone who 
can access a computer and understand the language the blog is written in 
can read it. (Some blog software does allow privacy settings or password 
protection; if you use these options, you have more assurance of privacy.)
And, like with all websites, people can print, duplicate, and fax blog posts, 
tape them to lampposts, distribute them to a class, or post them on social 
networking websites such as Facebook. A reader of your blog can even copy 
and paste the text of your blog posts into a text editor or e-mail message, 
sending that text buzzing around the world in the blink of an eye.
You can’t know who’s reading your blog, why they’re reading it, or what they 
might do with what you post. I often talk to bloggers who say, “Well, my only 
readers are my friends and family, so I don’t worry too much about what I write.” 
Your friends and family may very well be reading (in fact, I hope they are!), but 
they may not be the only readers. Don’t make the mistake of assuming that you 
know who is and isn’t reading your blog! I’m not saying that your readers aren’t 
only your friends and family, but that you can’t know that for sure.
	
Some blog-hosting sites require you to register in order to use them, and limit 
readership to those who have registered. It’s not just anyone who has a com­
puter and an Internet connection can read those blogs; anyone with a com­
puter, an Internet connection, and an account on that service can read them. 
Those blogs might look like they offer you more privacy, but generally the bar­
riers to registering for a service are very low: You just need an e-mail address. 
The blogs might as well be public.

Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
In rare instances, an entire blog is password-protected and therefore read­
able only by visitors who know the login information for the site. As long as 
that login information stays private, the blog is private. All the points about 
people being able to copy and paste or print the post still apply, however. As 
well, if someone shares a password, you may have unwelcome guests.
In this chapter, I drive home the point that you shouldn’t post anything to 
your blog that you don’t want anyone in the world to read — and yes, that 
includes your best friend, your significant other, your mother, your cowork­
ers, your boss, your landlord, your neighbor . . . you get the idea.
Assessing Your Involvement
Any productivity guru will tell you that individuals who are looking for advice 
think with their short-term brains. When you start a new project, you rarely 
think beyond the end of the calendar year — and even that can be a some­
what generous assumption. New bloggers aren’t any different.
Think about where you want the blog to be in five years. Will you still 
actively blog, or will this blogging thing last a few days, weeks, or months? 
Recognizing your level of commitment helps establish a clear vision about 
the resources that you should put into the blog.
	
Making decisions about the future of a blog can be a tricky business, but here 
are a few questions to answer (maybe in your new blog!) about where your 
blog will take you:
	
✓	What level of commitment are you willing make to blogging? Take a 
moment to visualize your level of commitment. On a list of your priori­
ties, where does blogging fall? If it’s at the absolute bottom of the list, 
this may not work out well. On the other hand, if you’re thinking about 
how many ways you can use your blog to enhance your business visibil­
ity or to keep your family up to date about what you’re doing, you might 
want to try blogging.
	
	The best starting point in determining your commitment is deciding 
how many posts you’re planning to write per day or week. Many popu­
lar bloggers tend to post more than once per day, but at that stage, the 
blogs are usually making a little money, or the bloggers already have an 
established business (so the blog provides mainly a supplemental outlet 
for them). Posting once per week works for most personal blogs.
	
✓	Do you like writing? How’s your typing? Being able to write is one skill, 
but being able to write interesting, fun prose that people actually want 
to read is entirely different. You can’t pick up blogging overnight; you

 Chapter 2: Entering the Blogosphere
must figure out how to do it by practicing. A good way to do this would 
be to create a test blog on a free blogging service like Blogger (www.
blogger.com) and try posting for a period of time. If you have any fear 
of writing or don’t know whether writing on a regular basis will work for 
you, you don’t need to invest a lot of time and money until you know the 
answers to these questions.
	
	Knowing how to type is an important skill that some new bloggers might 
not be very good at. If you don’t like to write (or type!), consider a pod­
cast or a videoblog. I talk about those formats in Chapter 12.
	
✓	What will the blog be about? Is your blog personal or professional? 
If you think of your blog as a personal space, that suggests you should 
spend less time on it than you do on your paying work or occupation — 
and you should definitely keep your budget lower than your income! 
Choose a design solution and write content to suit your budget and time.
	
	However, if you want the blog to serve a business purpose or promote 
your professional acumen, keep in mind that a company or consult-
ancy needs to present a polished, professional image online with a 
professional-looking design — ideally, one that’s integrated into any 
existing branding and identity. Also, rather than squeezing in time for 
writing the blog in the background, designate time for blogging just as you 
would for a meeting, project task, or other work-related responsibility.
	
✓	Do you think that your new blog might grow into a new career, lead 
to new clients and business, or help build connections with peers and 
colleagues? Websites can really help you make connections (just like 
joining social networks and finding old classmates), and I presume that, 
in part, you’re starting a blog to reach out to a community. If the com­
munity is a professional one or a group whose respect you must earn, 
your blog can send unspoken messages about who you are and what 
you stand for. But you don’t need to get all corporate!
	
	Most popular bloggers have developed careers based on their blogs 
unintentionally, all thanks to the quality of the blog. Bloggers have used 
blogs as starting points for book deals, television shows, and even direct 
sources of revenue. Think about the needs of your audience members 
and how to appeal to them, even when you consider what software to 
use. If you want to build an empire, choose the software that has the 
bells and whistles necessary to make that empire possible. Chapter 3 
has more information about software.
	
✓	How comfortable are you with sharing information about yourself 
or about your business or industry? The Internet is a public space. 
Don’t forget that anyone, not just the people you’re trying to reach, can 
read what you reveal about yourself on your blog. (See the next section 
for details.) Occasionally, bloggers find themselves the recipients of 
unwanted attention and discover that they need to blog more anony­
mously than they’d planned.

Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
What Happens When You Publish?
Blogging is a very immediate medium: When you publish a post, it goes live 
on your blog right away. In fact, several things happen the moment you click 
the Publish button:
	
✓	The post appears at the top of your blog’s home page.
	
✓	The blogging software adds the post to your blog’s archive, usually 
by both date and subject, and to your RSS feed, which gets updated in 
newsreaders.
	
✓	Anyone who signed up for e-mail notifications receives an e-mail about 
your post.
	
✓	If your blog software pings blog search engines and services, those 
search engines and services receive a notice from your blog software 
that you’ve updated your blog and put that information into their cata­
logs. (A ping is simply an electronic notification.) Users of search engine 
websites can then get your blog post as a result of a search.
	
✓	A search-engine crawler indexes the post the next time it visits your 
blog.
All these changes happen whether or not you think about them. The fact that 
blog posts are quickly distributed with a minimum of effort on the part of the 
blogger is part of the beauty and effectiveness of this format. Blog software 
and services are designed to deliver your content quickly.
	
Of course, you can edit your blog posts after you post them, and many blog­
gers make changes when necessary (see the “Making mistakes” section, later 
in this chapter, for some suggestions about changing your blog posts appro­
priately). However, editing after you post is a pretty ineffective way to control 
your message, because visitors might read or e-mail the original post before 
you make your edits.
The content you publish on a blog or web page can live on in other unin­
tended ways as well:
	
✓	Other bloggers might quote your post and expand on it on their blogs, 
creating partial copies of your deathless prose.
	
✓	Blog services might point to, and even partially excerpt, your blog post.
	
✓	Search engines might cache or otherwise archive the content temporar­
ily or permanently.
	
✓	An Internet archive, such as the Wayback Machine (www.archive.
org/web/web.php), might add your blog post to its permanent 
database.

You can see these effects demonstrated in Figure 2-1; a Google search (www.
google.com) for the phrase what happens when you drink coke turned up 
not only a blog post, but also several references to that same post on other 
blogs and websites, and on the news-sharing site Digg (http://digg.com). 
Google linked to the original blog post and a cached version archived by 
Google.
I don’t want to scare you. After all, publishing to your blog is a good thing! 
You want each of these processes to happen because they bring readers to 
your blog and present your content to potential readers. But be sure about 
what you’re posting before you start the ball rolling.

Blogging Ethically
The best defense, as they say, is a good offense. As a blogger, you should 
think about what you write before you publish it, as well as afterwards.
What I’m about to say might shock you, so prepare yourself: Bloggers have a 
code of ethics.
Okay, what I really mean is that some bloggers have a code of ethics. This 
loose set of ethics and standards, to which many serious bloggers adhere,

36
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
developed as blogs matured from a new medium into a more established one. 
For most old-school bloggers, the word to think about is transparency, which 
represents a whole range of ideas. I introduce transparency here and explain 
in more detail in the following sections:
	
✓	Truth-telling and honesty: In keeping with the diary format of a blog, 
being transparent on your blog has a lot to do with telling the truth 
about who you are, why you’re blogging, and what you want to accom­
plish with your blog. You want to communicate openly and honestly on 
a blog, dealing straightforwardly with your topics and ideas, and with 
your readers. 
	
	This idea of honesty doesn’t mean you need to reveal information that 
you’re not comfortable disclosing online — quite the contrary. But it 
does mean you don’t intentionally mislead your readers, as I explain in 
the upcoming section, “Telling the truth.” 
	
✓	Admitting mistakes: No one’s perfect, and you’ll eventually make a 
mistake. Whether you post something that you heard that turns out not 
to be true, or you blog while angry, the real test is how you respond 
to making a mistake. In the blogosphere, you need to own up to your 
words, apologizing if you need to, and making corrections when they’re 
necessary.
	
✓	Maintaining a dialogue: A good blogger is aware of, and responsive to, 
his or her readers via the comments that those readers leave on blog 
posts. A blog isn’t created in a vacuum. In fact, many bloggers feel that 
you can use a blog to build real relationships with people.
	
The idea that you can use a blog for meaningful interaction is the revolution­
ary element in blogging. At the core, blogging is about real people talking with 
each other and sharing real knowledge and experiences.
Of course, a blog isn’t necessarily great literature — and that’s fine. But 
transparency comprises worthy ideas, especially if you plan to blog about 
personal and sensitive topics. Read on for more details.
Telling the truth
Honesty in blogging is different from honesty in real-life relationships or even 
journalism or advertising, because knowing who someone is or what they 
represent online is complex. Consider the following: 
	
✓	Blogging anonymously: Blogging under a pen name is okay. For many 
bloggers, telling the truth is first about emotional honesty and second — 
or perhaps not at all — about revealing who you are. For example, a per­
sonal blogger may connect with a community over a sensitive topic and 
thus want to use a pen name.

 Chapter 2: Entering the Blogosphere
	
	The blogosphere doesn’t like poseurs. If you choose to blog about your 
life and do so anonymously, be prepared for readers to challenge 
whether you’re even a real person. Know that your true identity may be 
revealed, either publicly or among people who know you in real life. Be 
prepared to defend your writing as your own, especially if your anony­
mous blog could create conflict in your offline life or career.
	
	A famous incident from 2001 concerning the blog of Kaycee Nicole, a 
young teenager who had just died of leukemia, demonstrates the kind of 
thing I’m talking about. People all over the world followed her blog, chat­
ted with her online, even spoke with her on the phone during her illness. 
In fact, the life and death of Kaycee was the product of imagination. After 
some suspicious anomalies surfaced, several savvy bloggers tracked 
down real-world evidence that she not only hadn’t died, but didn’t even 
exist.
	
	If you’re set on blogging anonymously — and there are many reasons to 
choose this approach — be sure to check out Chapter 10 to learn what 
to watch out for.
	
✓	Blogging about products and services at the behest of the product or 
service provider: The online community has slammed bloggers for blog­
ging about products and services for money without revealing that they 
were paid to do so. A blog scandal in 2003 put Dr Pepper into the public 
eye for soliciting blog posts from a group of teenagers about a new prod­
uct called Raging Cow. The teens received trips, samples of the product, 
and gift certificates, and the company asked them to promote the drink 
on their personal blogs. Many of the teens did so without revealing that 
they basically received compensation for promoting the product, and 
when the arrangement became public, a blogosphere boycott of the 
company and a lot of anger against the bloggers ensued.
	
	Since then, the FTC has ruled that these kinds of endorsement relation­
ships must be disclosed, so this is no longer simply an ethical issue. You 
can review the FTC guidelines at www.ftc.gov/os/2009/10/091005r
evisedendorsementguides.pdf.
	
✓	Blogging as a fictional character: Interestingly, Dr Pepper also started 
a blog ostensibly written by the Raging Cow herself during her travels 
around the country, as shown in Figure 2-2. Bloggers roundly criticized 
this blog at the time (for being fake, of course). But the idea of creating 
fictional characters that write blogs has stuck around, and many blog­
gers have used it successfully since then. The format is still controver­
sial, but it’s also highly effective!

character.
	
	
In general, I recommend following these rules about honesty in your blogging:
	
✓	Explain who you are and why you’re blogging.
	
✓	If you need to hide your identity or those of people you mention, indi­
cate that you’re doing so and why.
	
✓	If you start a fake blog, make sure that you disclose somewhere on the 
site that it is, in fact, fake. (You’d think that a blog written by a bovine is 
obviously fake, but it doesn’t hurt to say so.)
	
✓	If you’re making money from your blog posts, explain the arrangement 
and how you’re allowing it to influence (or not influence) what you 
write. U.S.-based bloggers should review the FTC guidelines around 
endorsements and material considerations at www.ftc.gov/os/2009/
10/091005revisedendorsementguides.pdf.

39
 Chapter 2: Entering the Blogosphere
	
✓	If you mention a fact or story that you got from someone else, explain 
who. If you can link to the source, do. Observe copyrights at all times.
	
✓	Take responsibility for what’s on your blog, no matter where else you 
might have heard or read about what you write.
Making mistakes
If you make a mistake on your blog, admit it. Apologize, if necessary. Above 
all, don’t try to deny it or hide it.
	
Mistakes, big and little, are inevitable and upset people, but you can do a great 
deal to help yourself and your credibility by how you handle the mistake after 
you or your readers discover it.
In general, most bloggers try to avoid editing posts after they publish those 
posts, which is part of the transparency I discuss earlier in the section 
“Blogging Ethically.” Sometimes, however, you need to correct the original 
post when you make a factual or grammatical error. Fortunately, bloggers 
have evolved ways to indicate corrections in blog posts, such as using strik­
ethrough text on the original error and following it with the correction, like 
this:
President Bill Clinton played his trumpet saxophone on The Arsenio Hall 
Show.
Blogger Darren Barefoot uses this technique on his blog (www.darren
barefoot.com). In Figure 2-3, he corrects a grammatical error that changes 
the meaning of a sentence. Other bloggers use italics or bold, or make notes 
at the top or bottom of the blog post, to make these kinds of corrections. The 
strikethrough style, however, has the advantage of letting you indicate the 
original error clearly.
	
Making a correction while retaining the error is best (unless the error was 
libelous or is causing legal trouble). Try to avoid simply changing the text like 
the mistake never existed.
You can handle updates that you want to make to a blog post in two ways:
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
40
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
	
✓	Expand on your original post: If you change your mind about some­
thing, or simply need to expand on what you first said, you may want to 
do so in the original blog post, instead of starting a new post. Updating 
the original blog post ensures that readers see your original post at the 
same time as the update.
	
	For very important updates that change the intention or meaning of a 
post, Darren Barefoot (www.darrenbarefoot.com) posts the update 
at the end of the original post labeled UPDATE, as shown in Figure 2-4. In 
this case, the update expands on the original post by pointing out new 
resources. Some bloggers preface the new content with the acronym 
ETA (which stands for Edited to Add).
	
✓	Start a new post: When you really mess up, you might also choose to 
add a new blog post that explains what went wrong and how you might 
be able to avoid similar mistakes in the future (assuming that’s pos­
sible!) or that just clarifies the whole situation. You don’t always need 
to go this far, but if it helps clear the air, why not? Plus, you can use the 
extra post to apologize if you need to.
	
	If you start a new post to explain a mistake, link to the old post and also 
go into the old post to create a link to the new one, just so all your read­
ers get a chance to see all the details.

Handling dialogue
You write your blog in hopes that people read it and (usually) respond and 
interact with you, as well. The mechanism for interacting with your readers 
involves blog post comments. Comments are both a boon and a bane for 
bloggers: They provide a source of much interesting dialogue, but they can 
also likely provide an area for people to post spam and other unwanted 
material.
A blogger who neglects to read comments and respond to them quickly loses 
the community of people who write those comments because they can get 
frustrated and leave. On the flip side, reading and replying to those same 
folks generally earns a blogger a larger and more engaged audience.
You don’t need to keep all the comments on a blog, however. Pay attention 
to the conversation others generate on your blog; when necessary, exercise 
your judgment about removing personal attacks, libel, obscenity, spam, or 
other undesirable content.
In Chapter 9, I cover building a strong community dialogue by using the com­
ments on your blog.

Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
Keeping Your Job While Blogging
You can blog about anything you want. And you spend a lot of time at work. 
So maybe you’re blogging about work. Work can certainly provide you with a 
great source of stories and jokes. In fact, at my office the other day, my part­
ner did the stupidest thing. . . .
Ahem.
Anyway, blogging about work can get you in trouble. Your colleagues and 
your boss might not appreciate that you repeat water-cooler gossip on your 
blog, complain about the most boring meeting ever, or talk about how you 
photocopied inappropriate body parts when you were “working” late on 
Thursday.
	
If you choose to discuss people you work with on your blog and someone may 
be able to identify them (even if you don’t include your coworkers’ names), 
you can get yourself in hot water with both your coworkers and your boss.
And all that trouble comes before you reveal trade secrets or stock information!
Some bloggers identify both themselves and their employers on their per­
sonal blogs. Doing so is certainly transparent — after all, work is a big part of 
your life — but it isn’t necessarily wise. For one thing, if you blog about your 
work place and you name your employer, readers might think that you’re 
blogging on behalf of your employer.
This perception isn’t fair, but a lot of readers have it. After all, if you blog 
on your own time (and you do blog on your own time, right?) and don’t use 
company blogging software, who can consider you a spokesperson for your 
company? Honestly, most people won’t think you’re a mouthpiece for 
your company, but they might associate your thoughts and opinions 
with your employer. Generally speaking, employers don’t want people to 
associate the business with the political agendas, family relationships, or 
dating habits of their employees.
Employers today know that blogs exist, and they’re fully capable of typing 
your name, their name, or the company name into a search engine and find­
ing blogs that talk about them or their company. Blogging anonymously — 
although a good idea if you want to criticize your employer — doesn’t really 
guarantee that you won’t get caught, particularly if other people in your 
office know about your blog.
Employers who regard their employees as representatives of their busi­
nesses might even institute a company blogging policy that dictates whether 
www.it-ebooks.info

43
 Chapter 2: Entering the Blogosphere
you can identify your employer on your personal blog. This policy might 
even request that you not blog at all, especially if you are the visible face of 
the organization or speak for the company in other circumstances. 
	
I encourage you to blog about whatever floats your boat, but if you want to 
blog about work, you need to do so safely. Here are a few tips that you can use 
to stay on your employer’s good side:
	
✓	Regardless of what you blog about, don’t blog while you are at work. 
Using company time and resources to write a personal blog is a clear 
violation of most employment contracts and can get you disciplined or 
fired, even if all you do on your blog is sing your boss’s praises.
	
✓	Find out whether your workplace has a blogging policy. If your boss 
doesn’t know, consult with the HR department. In some cases, a policy 
might be in place that makes certain requests of your blogging behavior, 
and you can choose whether to comply with them. Comply with them or 
have good reasons if you choose not to.
	
✓	Ask questions about your employer’s blogging policy if it’s unclear 
or incomplete. Find out whether you can’t discuss certain subjects and 
whether you can identify yourself as an employee.
	
✓	Be smart about what you choose to say about your work and your 
colleagues. If you wouldn’t feel comfortable saying what you write in 
public, don’t put it on your blog. (Go back to the beginning of this chap­
ter if you’re unclear on the idea that the web is a public place.)
	
✓	Don’t reveal trade secrets. Trade secrets include confidential informa­
tion about how your employer does business that can impact revenue 
or reputation. If you aren’t sure whether you can blog about something, 
run it by your boss first.
	
✓	Review other rules and regulations that might impact what you can 
blog about. For example, some employers have policies about taking 
photographs of the workplace, or revealing addresses or buildings. 
Those policies seem unrelated to blogging — until you put those photos 
or that information on your blog.
	
✓	Consider including a disclosure statement on your blog that says 
you’re blogging for personal expression and not as a representative 
of your employer. Thomas Duff makes his blogging position clear in 
his very thorough disclosure statement on Duffbert’s Random Musings 
(www.duffbert.com/duffbert/blog.nsf/htdocs/TDUF63Z2TS.
htm), which is shown in Figure 2-5.

Blogging without Embarrassing 
Your Mother or Losing Friends
You might think it goes without saying that if you can lose your job over 
opinions that you express on your blog, you can also damage your personal 
relationships with friends and family. I’m saying it anyway.
Many bloggers get caught up in the confessional mood and post content 
that they later regret — though perhaps not as much as a friend or relative 
regrets it.
Understanding what’s at stake
Successful blogger Heather Armstrong alienated her family early in her blog­
ging career when she posted her views on the religion in which she was 
raised. Her parents, who were still firm believers in that religion, read the 
post and were hurt, as was her extended family and the community in which

they lived. (I’m sure she also received plenty of e-mails from people outside 
of family who also felt strongly about their religion.) Heather calls herself 
a poster child for what not to do on a blog, though in fact, the process has 
resulted in Dooce (www.dooce.com), a blog that’s both well-known and prof­
itable today.
In an interview with Rebecca Blood (who studies blogs), Heather cautions 
that criticizing others might make great posts, but the chances are good that 
the person you criticize will read what you’ve written and feel hurt. You can 
read the full interview on Rebecca Blood’s website at www.rebeccablood.
net/bloggerson/heatherarmstrong.html. More recently, Heather was 
the subject of a New York Times story www.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/
magazine/27armstrong-t.html describing the influence she has earned 
by chronicling stories from the life of her family and herself.
Even if you never criticize others, you might possibly reveal information 
about others — their conversations with you, the date you had last night, 
the disappointing sexual encounter — that your friends and family may find 
disturbing.
Protecting others in your life
Call it the Mom test: Can your blog post get you in trouble with your mom? 
Sure, you’re an adult, and so is she — but she’s the most likely person to call 
you on an inappropriate blog post. Your coworkers might be appalled when 
they read about your love life, but they probably won’t ever tell you that your 
blog is a problem. If your mom is like my mom, she will.
In some ways, all this advice is common sense:
	
✓	Don’t blog about topics that you think might hurt others.
	
✓	Don’t blog about others without their permission, even about topics that 
you consider inconsequential. Don’t identify friends and lovers by name 
without their permission.
	
✓	Remember that your blog software archives your blog posts, so some­
one might read what you say today at a later time. For instance, if you 
write a report on an unsuccessful relationship, the next person you want 
to date might read it.
	
Before you hit the Publish button, stop for a second and put yourself in the 
shoes of your reader: Are you writing for the reader, or are you writing for 
yourself? If your answer is the latter, you might be better off keeping a real 
diary in a format that the entire world can’t publicly access.

Protecting Your Privacy and Reputation
Your blog might not reflect your employer’s viewpoints or your family’s, but 
it certainly reflects your own. Don’t forget that what you put on your blog 
today might stick around for a long time to come and that the reader might 
not always have your best interests at heart.
	
Never put any personal identifying information online that exposes you to pos­
sible identity theft or physical confrontation: Don’t post your Social Security 
number, home address, birthdate or place, mother’s maiden name, pass­
words, bank account numbers, or any information that you use as password 
reminders or identifying information with financial institutions. Most bloggers 
prefer to keep phone numbers private, as well. Don’t reveal this information 
about the people you blog about, either.
Many bloggers solve the issues discussed in this chapter by choosing to blog 
anonymously or by using a handle — a phrase or moniker that doesn’t per­
sonally identify the writer.
Don’t forget that many of your online identities are linked. For example, if 
you use a nickname when you leave comments on other blogs, and then use 
that same nickname on a bulletin board or when you sign up for a social-
networking service, people can easily connect the dots. In fact, many of these 
services already work together.
For example, on one of my blogs, I display my Flickr photo stream and my 
latest Twitter messages. My Facebook profile pulls in my Amazon wish list, 
my music playlists, and my horoscope. Here’s my point: If you identify your­
self on any of these sites or tools, and then tie them together in some way, 
others can easily follow the trail to figure out who you are.
Anonymity gives you a great way to protect yourself on your own blog, but 
it doesn’t keep you from showing up in other people’s blogs or Flickr photo 
streams. If your friends and family have blogs, consider setting ground rules 
with them about situations and topics that you want excluded as subjects on 
their blogs. Be willing to accept the same kinds of requests about your own 
blog writing.

 Chapter 2: Entering the Blogosphere
	
One of the best ways to take charge of your own online identity is to start a 
website or blog yourself. If other people are mentioning you online, having an 
official website that contains accurate information can help supplant or down­
play less desirable material.
If you want to find out more about controlling your online identity or protect­
ing your privacy, review some of these great online resources:
	
✓	Visit the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s (EFF) guide “How to Blog 
Safely (About Work or Anything Else)” at www.eff.org/wp/blog-
safely for advice on blogging anonymously, and be sure to read 
Chapter 10 of this book.
	
✓	The EFF’s “Legal Guide for Bloggers” is a great resource on a number 
of issues, including defamation, privacy rights, and legal liability: www.
eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal.

Choosing and Hosting 
Blog Software
In This Chapter

▶	Identifying a good web host
▶	Deciding between hosted and non-hosted software
▶	Getting your blog software in place
I

f you’re serious about turning your blog into a visual masterpiece, you’re 
likely to choose a blog software package that you install on your own web 
server. Hosted solutions are great, but you run up against the limits of cus­
tomization quite quickly.
In this chapter, you can find information about choosing the right software 
for your situation. If you pick blog software that you need to install, you also 
need to get yourself a domain name and web hosting where you can install 
your software.
Prepare yourself for strange new technology jargon while you explore what 
makes blogging exciting, frustrating, confusing, and rewarding — blogging 
software.
Having Your Own Domain Name
Of course, you want a blog — that’s why you’re reading this book, right? 
But before you get too much further, you need to deal with the single most 
important decision of your blogging career: the name of your blog!

50
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
That name should tie closely into the domain name, or web address, that 
your visitors use to access your blog. And if you have a domain name, you 
obviously need web hosting so that your blog software has a place to live on 
the Internet. In the following sections, I walk you through domain names and 
web hosting.
A domain is the address (or main URL) that people type in their web brows­
ers to get to your website. Think of a domain like an address to your house. 
Each house on a street has an individual address. When someone looks for 
you in the phone book, he or she can find your address. If you search for 
a website by using your favorite search engine, you can find the website 
address.
Picking a domain name
You can use any word or phrase as your domain name (assuming no one 
else is using that domain name). You can make your domain name a com­
pany name, a nickname, or your favorite food group. For years, professional 
web designers and developers have been saying that all the good domains 
are gone, which is far from the truth. After all, new websites and blogs are 
launched all the time, and many of them have great, memorable domains!
For an example of a great domain name, check out Darren Barefoot’s blog 
One Year, One Canadian (www.oneyearonecanadian.ca), which docu­
ments his effort to live a year buying only Canadian products, eating only 
Canadian food, and consuming Canadian media (see Figure 3-1).
Think up a phrase or sentence that says something about you and your blog 
as a starting place. Write your topic keywords on sticky notes, and then 
move them around. That trick may lead to something great.
What exactly does a domain do for you? It has several plusses:
	
✓	Your readers can easily remember your site. Your mom can brag about 
you and send visitors to your blog.
	
✓	Having a domain of your own looks professional; it’s a nice marketing 
benefit at a small cost.
	
✓	You can change web hosts or hosted blog solutions with impunity 
because your address is actually a separate service. If — or when — you 
move your blog, your web host can help you use the same domain to get 
to your new server on the web.

Figure 3-1:

atively to

name and 
domain, 
like One 
Year, One 
Canadian.
	
Your domain should represent your blog’s name and purpose, although at 
the end of the day, there are no hard and fast rules. Here are a few quick 
guidelines that you might want to follow. Try to choose a domain that
	
✓	Matches your blog name
	
✓	Is based on your topic keywords
	
✓	Is a play on words or slang based around your topic
	
✓	Is humorous or otherwise memorable
	
If you’re having trouble coming up with a name idea, consider using your 
name. In fact, even if you ultimately want to use another domain for your blog 
address, owning the domain for your own name is a good idea. You can use 
several domain names to reach the same website or blog, too, so using your 
own name as a domain might help people find you in search engines.
	
Many online tools can help you choose a domain name if you’re having trou­
ble. Domain-name-choosing websites help by suggesting word combinations 
and coming up with randomly generated choices. One good site to use for this 
purpose is Bust a Name (www.bustaname.com), which is shown in Figure 3-2.

Even if you end up using a hosted blog solution and therefore don’t need to 
get web hosting, you can buy a domain and forward the address to your blog. 
This is handy to do because it makes your blog’s address easier to remember. 
After you register your domain, check the Help text of the registrar to find out 
how to forward the domain to your blog’s web address (URL). Instructions 
vary by registrar.
Registering a domain
Registering a domain is a straightforward process. First, use a domain regis­
trar to buy your name. After you own the name, you just need to point your 
new domain at your web host. This process basically involves telling your 
domain registrar which web server your website is on; your web hosting 
company or domain registrar gives you the information and tools to make it 
all work.

 Chapter 3: Choosing and Hosting Blog Software
You can use many domain registration services. The choice really comes 
down to the domain management interface — the tools that you get in order 
to manage your domain. Some management screens are incredibly difficult 
to work with. Finding a host that has a clean and easy-to-use interface makes 
a world of difference when you’re updating or making changes to your web 
domain. Be sure to shop around, as well. The annual fee for domain registra­
tion varies widely, and for the most part, the price differences don’t equal a 
difference in what you get.
You can choose to register for your domain for a single year or for multiple 
years at a time. Typically, registering for multiple years earns you a small 
discount. If you choose to register for only a year, you need to renew the 
domain in a year (assuming that you want to keep your website going). Many 
domain registration companies also offer web-hosting and e-mail packages.
	
Make sure that you keep your domain registration up to date. If you have any 
changes to your domain or contact information, including your e-mail address, 
update your domain information immediately. If your information isn’t cur­
rent, you can lose access to your domain or miss e-mail reminders to renew 
your domain. Print a copy of the login information and store it safely.
Visit any of the domain registrars in the following sections to check whether 
your domain is available, and then register it.
Go Daddy
www.godaddy.com
Go Daddy is a popular web host and domain registrar that provides a long 
list of web services, including domain hosting, web hosting, and e-mail 
address hosting. It has a good reputation and is easy to contact if you require 
assistance. A .com domain is priced at $11.99 for a year’s registration.
To register a domain with Go Daddy, follow these steps:
	
1.	Point your web browser to www.godaddy.com.
	
2.	Type the domain you’re interested in into the Start a Domain Name 
Search text box.

Domainsatcost.ca
www.domainsatcost.ca
This domain registrar, located in Canada, provides registrations for all major 
domains, including .com and .ca domains. It has a support number (long 
distance applies), and someone answers the telephone — a rarity among 
domain hosts. Domainsatcost.ca is reasonably priced at $12.95 CDN (that’s 
Canadian dollars!) a year for .ca domains, and $14.95 year for .com domains.
Finding Web Hosting
With a domain in hand, you can turn your attention to web hosting.
If the domain is your address, web hosting is your actual house on the web. 
Web hosting provides the web server where your software, graphics, and 
other files live online. When people use your address — the domain — the 
web server gives them the pages that they want.
Doing your research
Your primary concern is to find a web host that has everything your blog 
software needs to run. Because you want to use a blog software package, you 
might have more specific needs than are on offer for a typical website.
Most blog software uses a LAMP (Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP) web server, 
a mix of several kinds of web server technology that is ideal for running 
dynamic websites such as blogs:
	
✓	Linux: A very common web server operating system. It’s very stable and 
considered a standard for web servers. As a blogger, you probably don’t 
need to make too many changes to the operating system, as long as it’s 
in place for you.
	
✓	Apache: Apache is web-page-serving software, which means it looks at 
what web page is requested and then feeds the browser the appropri­
ate file. It does most of the hard work of serving web pages to visitors 
coming to your website.
	
✓	MySQL: MySQL is the most popular database software for blogs. For 
any blogging package, you need some kind of database system to store 
all your blog posts and run the other functionality of the blog software. 
MySQL is the standard database tool for most blog software.
www.it-ebooks.info

56
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
	
✓	PHP: PHP is the programming language that a lot of blogging and con­
tent management systems use. It sits between the blogging software and 
the database, making sure all the parts work together.
The preceding four technologies are considered the bare minimum that most 
blogging packages need to function. But you should consider these require­
ments, as well:
	
✓	Disk space: For blogging, disk space is important if you decide to store 
a lot of images on your blog or upload audio and video files. Uploading 
images is relatively easy to do, but you need the space to store those 
images. For the average blog that has a few photos, you most likely 
want about 500 megabytes (MB). Blogs that have a lot of photos require 
several gigabytes (GB) of disk space. Video blogs need a whole lot more 
disk space (unless you use an online video-sharing service) than text or 
photo blogs, so you want more than 10GB. Those files do take up a lot of 
space!
	
	Running out of disk space is an easily solved problem: Most web hosts 
allow you to add disk space when you need it for an additional cost. 
Check with your web host to find out what it charges for additional 
storage.
	
✓	E-mail management: You probably want an e-mail address with your 
new domain. If you want to use your blog for business purposes, having 
an e-mail address that matches your domain looks more professional. 
	
✓	Backups: Consider how you plan to back up your data (including your 
database content) and whether the web host will also back up the files 
on your web-hosting account. Knowing this information can save you 
from disaster and data loss in the future. Daily backups aren’t a bad 
idea!
	
✓	Bandwidth and CPU resources: Computers and networks can take only 
so many visitors and downloads, and hosts usually set a quota on how 
much bandwidth you can use for the particular web-hosting package 
that you buy. Ask about what happens if you exceed your monthly allow­
ance of bandwidth. (Usually, you have to pay for the extra resources.) 
For most bloggers, this won’t be an issue, but if you develop a very pop­
ular blog with lots of visitors, or are serving very large files like videos, 
bandwidth can become an additional cost.
Buying web hosting
After you purchase your domain, you should be able to pick a web host just 
as easily. But the reality is that web host offerings are all over the map, so 
you need to do your research, ask for recommendations from friends and col­
leagues who have websites, and compare the details of what different hosts 
offer.

57
 Chapter 3: Choosing and Hosting Blog Software
	
When comparing web hosts, always confirm the numbers provided in sales 
materials. Here are the top questions to ask a prospective web host about its 
web-hosting packages:
	
✓	What’s your reliability and uptime guarantee? Most web hosts will tell 
you the amount of time in a given month that they guarantee your web­
site to be available given normal traffic loads. None of them, however, 
can absolutely guarantee 100 percent uptime.
	
✓	What’s your data transfer limit, and how much do you charge for addi­
tional bandwidth? Bandwidth/data transfer is used as visitors visit your 
website and download pages from your site in order to view them. If you 
have a lot of files being transferred, or a single file that thousands of visi­
tors download, you may hit your limit and need to buy more.
	
✓	How much disk space does the package include, and what do you charge 
for additional space?
	
✓	What kind of technical support do you offer? What are your telephone 
hours? How do you handle e-mail support?
When you find a web host that interests you, check out the packages on 
offer. Many web hosts provide a handy comparison chart that you can use to 
quickly compare pricing and features, as Nexcess.net (www.nexcess.net) 
does in Figure 3-4.
The following sections help you get started with your web-hosting search by 
discussing three top web-hosting services.
Go Daddy
www.godaddy.com
Go Daddy is a popular web host — and domain registrar — that provides a 
long list of web services. Its smallest web-hosting packages start at around 
$4.99 a month.
For a new blogger just starting out, I recommend the Economy Plan. It 
includes 10GB of disk space and unlimited bandwidth, in addition to daily 
backups and 24-hour phone and e-mail technical support. You can receive 
discounts if you sign up for a year or more at a time.

 Chapter 3: Choosing and Hosting Blog Software
Deciding on the Right Blogging Software
No matter where you take your blog, it all starts with one crucial decision: 
what blog software you want to use. Choose wisely, grasshopper, and watch 
your blog software grow while you add more bells and whistles. Pick poorly, 
and be faced with the ultimate chore: migrating your blog from one blog soft­
ware package to a better one. You can do this transfer, but you can’t do it 
easily. Spend the time to find out about the available blogging tools and the 
functionality they provide now so that you can save yourself a lot of head­
aches later.
First, you need to recognize that all blogging platforms aren’t created equal. 
Of course, blogging software packages, whether they’re managed by you or 
by paid web-hosting technical staff, all share the same or similar functional­
ity that you need for a typical blog. But each software package was designed 
with very different goals in mind.
Unlike software that you install on a desktop or laptop computer, blogging 
software requires a server environment to function. What a challenge, for a 
non-technical blogger who just wants to start posting, to make a good deci­
sion about web servers!
Bloggers can use either of two kinds of blogging platforms:
	
✓	Hosted blogs: Hosted blog services provide a unique situation in which 
you don’t need to worry about the software technology at all. You can 
concentrate on worrying about what your next blog post will be about, 
rather than how to configure a web server. To use hosted blogging soft­
ware, you log into the editing tool, write a post, click the Publish button, 
and log out.
	
	You don’t need to think about how the software is managed, just as long 
as it’s there the next time you want to post something. Many bloggers 
consider this setup the deal of the century. One popular hosted solution 
is Blogger (www.blogger.com), which I discuss in detail in Chapter 4.
	
	Extra bonus: If you choose hosted software, you don’t have to worry 
about web hosting — the software company is providing that service for 
you! See the section “Understanding Hosted Blog Software,” later in this 
chapter, for a more in-depth discussion of this option. 
	
	Social networks allow you to connect with current friends and make new 
ones while sharing photos, videos, and text. They’ve exploded in popu­
larity in the last few years, and many of them have added a blogging 
tool. I cover how blogging fits into social networking in Chapter 16.
www.it-ebooks.info

60
Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
	
✓	Non-hosted blogs: You might want to run your own blogging system 
right from the beginning. This type of setup is known as non-hosted or 
installable blogging software. By installing blog software on your own 
web server, you take on all responsibilities related to maintaining the 
blogging software and the data created when you blog. Strictly from 
a technical point of view, this type of setup for a new blog might be a 
little on the difficult side and cause more stress — especially for the 
nontechnical folks who are figuring things out while they go — but you 
ultimately get more flexibility when you use a non-hosted setup. For 
example, Serious Eats (www.seriouseats.com), a blog that covers 
food news from all over the blogosphere, uses Movable Type, a blogging 
solution that you install on your own server.
	
	Okay, I lied. Hosting your own blog is a lot more difficult than the point-
and-click solution of hosted software. If you love a challenge or want all 
the bells and whistles, however, consider hosting your blog yourself. 
Later in this chapter, the section “Understanding Blog Software That 
You Install on Your Own Server” explains the details of how non-hosted 
blog software works.
Budgeting for software
Many of the hosted services available to new bloggers usually don’t charge 
the user — at least, at the basic level of service. A great number of the non-
hosted blogging software packages are also free, but the web server that 
you need to install them on most definitely isn’t. How much money you can 
commit to your new blog can help you figure out what platform you should 
acquire.
	
Consider how much financial commitment you want to dedicate to your new 
blogging life. Costs can be associated with
	
✓	Blogging software: Some packages are free; others aren’t. In some cases, 
the blogging software might be free for personal use but can cost money 
if you use it for commercial purposes.
	
✓	Upgrades: When you choose a software package that has a price tag, be 
sure to note the costs for upgrading that software down the line. Blog 
software is in flux, and you’ll need updates!
	
✓	A domain name: Regardless of whether you choose a hosted or non-
hosted solution, you can buy a domain name (also called a web address) 
and point it at your blog.
	
✓	Web hosting: If you choose a blogging software package that needs to 
be installed on a web server, you need to find web hosting.

 Chapter 3: Choosing and Hosting Blog Software
	
✓	Support costs: If you have questions about your blog software or web 
hosting, getting answers might cost you. Find out what the support poli­
cies are for both software and hosting before you buy.
	
✓	Web designers: If you need to hire a web designer or developer to pro­
duce a design, install the software, and get your blog started, you have 
to pay those folks.
	
✓	Special bells and whistles: You might find that you can purchase and 
use extra add-ons with your blog, from cool functionality to exciting 
designs.
Making sure you get the basics
Each blogging package has a great number of options to choose from. Some 
options are designed to trick out your ride, making your blog into a thing of 
beauty and delight. Some options you absolutely need to have. Good blog­
ging software must have the following five features:
	
✓	A usable publishing interface or control panel: Check out how the 
control panel looks before you commit yourself. A good user interface 
is important, and if you can’t make sense of what you see, chances are 
good that you won’t enjoy using the software.
	
✓	Comments: A blog isn’t a blog unless your readers can leave comments 
on your posts. You don’t have to use the comments, but blogging soft­
ware without comments takes away a vital element of blogging — allow­
ing your readers to cultivate discussions.
	
✓	Spam deterrents: Spam comments are a part of every blog, but that 
doesn’t mean you have to live with them. Like e-mail spam, comment 
spam tends to be an automated process that posts on your blog useless 
information and includes links to all kinds of other sites. Look for blog­
ging software that has functionalities in place to help you moderate and 
block spam.
	
✓	Pinging: A blog software package that uses pinging services is a great 
idea. Pinging is an automated notification system for search engines and 
newsreaders, letting those services know that you’ve updated your blog. 
Because search engines tend to rank “fresh” content highly, letting them 
know when you have new content means that your blog may be more 
likely to appear, and appear higher, in search results. 
	
✓	RSS feeds: If your blog software doesn’t have an RSS feed, move on to dif­
ferent blog software. If you’re at all interested in building traffic to your 
blog, an RSS feed is the single best built-in software feature that you can 
use to meet that goal. An RSS feed is a computer-readable version of your 
blog, standardized so that it can appear in newsreaders and on websites 
and blogs. For more information about RSS, read Chapter 14.

Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
I highly recommend two other features, although not all bloggers use them:
	
✓	Categories: Blogs often jump from topic to topic. Categorizing your posts 
gives your readers a quick and easy way to sort through your content, 
focusing on what most interests them. A List Apart (www.alistapart.
com) uses categories, called topics here, to sort blog posts; Figure 3-5 
shows the categories in the sidebar on the right side of the blog post.
	
	Categories are high-level organizational tools. For example, a food blog 
might have posts sorted into categories like Vegetarian, Dessert, Main 
Dish, and so on.
	
✓	Tags: A tag is a term associated with a blog post. (For example, when 
I write a blog post about my new cat Maggie, I tag that entry “kitten.”) 
Tagging is a relatively new technology, but it has proven to be one of the 
best ways to sort through blog data quickly. The Cool Hunting blog (www.
coolhunting.com) uses tags in the right column, shown in Figure 3-6.
	
	Tags are like keywords you might use when doing a search on a search 
engine website, and they tend to be more specific than categories. A 
blog post on a food blog might use categories as I describe in the pre­
ceding bullet, and then tag individual posts with more specific terms, 
like chocolate, hazelnut, and brownie. To differentiate between categories 
and tags, think of categories as describing a group of blog posts, and 
tags as describing individual posts.

Upgrading with bells and whistles
You can implement a number of cool toys on your blog:
	
✓	Trackbacks: Trackbacks are a useful technology that allows bloggers to 
link to blog posts on related topics. If your blog software is trackback-
enabled, you can link to another blog simply by using the URL of the 
original posting. In this automatic process, your blog software lets 
another blogger’s software know that your blog has referenced a post so 
that the software can create a link on the original post.
	
	Trackbacks can also be a source of spam, and as a result, they’re not as 
important in the blogosphere as they used to be. So, although they’re 
nice to have, if the blog software package that you want to use doesn’t 
offer trackbacks, don’t automatically eliminate that software from 
consideration.
	
✓	News aggregation: One of the handiest features of blogging software 
is the capability to aggregate news by using RSS feeds. Having a news 
aggregator included with your blog package allows your site to pull in 
information from other blogs. You can then provide this information to 
your readers, offering them content from other sources.

Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
	
✓	Spam blacklist: Most blogging packages have some kind of blacklist pro­
tection against spam comments. These blacklists are often centralized 
lists of e-mail addresses, URLs, and IP addresses that spammers use, 
which the blog software prevents from commenting in any blog post on 
your blog. With an up-to-date blacklist, you can stop a lot of spam before 
it becomes a comment.
	
✓	Spam whitelist: Some blogging software includes the capability to use 
a whitelist, in which you preselect the users who can comment. Spam-
filtering systems and blog user accounts are quickly replacing this type 
of system, however.
	
✓	CAPTCHAs: CAPTCHAs are images that display letters and/or numbers 
that a person can read but a machine can’t. When someone wants to 
leave a comment on a post, he or she must correctly type these letter/
number combinations into a text box, which proves to the blog soft­
ware that the commenter is indeed a human and not a computer spam 
system. This process blocks out the comment spam and lets through 
the valuable feedback. Variations on CAPTCHAs include simple math 
problems that a user needs to solve in order to post a comment. Clotilde 
Dusoulier’s Chocolate & Zucchini blog (http://chocolateand
zucchini.com) uses one form of a CAPTCHA, as shown in Figure 3-7.

 Chapter 3: Choosing and Hosting Blog Software
	
You can tie together more and more web services these days, from your 
photos on Flickr, to your Twitter updates, to your . . . well, you have a lot of 
possibilities. Some blog software allows you to automate those kinds of con­
nections, so if that interests you, keep an eye out for software with these fea­
tures. I walk you through some possibilities in Chapter 16.
Understanding Hosted Blog Software
Hosted services take a whole lot of responsibility off the blogger. The blog 
software company manages the data, software, and web hosting; the blog­
ger manages the content. Some services, such as Blogger, do it all for free, 
whereas other services, such as TypePad, charge a monthly fee to run your 
blog. Yet other services, such as WordPress, offer a level of free service 
with the option to upgrade when your blogging requires a little more power. 
Hosted blog software allows you to make someone responsible for the entire 
gauntlet of technical tasks that don’t excite you.
	
Seasoned blogging veterans recommend that new bloggers start by using a 
hosted service that’s free. The reason is simple: If you find the idea of having a 
blog appealing, but you have never tried blogging or played with blogging soft­
ware, you might not like it all that much in reality. So, an expert — say, the one 
writing this book — tells newbie bloggers to take a free blogging service for a 
test drive before committing a lot of time or money.
After all, actually sitting down and running a full- or part-time blog is a whole 
lot of work. If writing turns out not to be your cup of tea, using a free service 
for a while means that you haven’t poured any money down the drain to find 
that out.
Reaping the benefits
An upfront cost of zero is very attractive to new bloggers. If you want access 
to blog technology and have a limited budget (not to mention all those other 
annoying budget commitments, such as food and rent), free looks just about 
perfect. Not all hosted software is free, but they generally have quite reason­
able costs. A hosted blog that charges a monthly fee is still cheaper than 
most monthly cell phone plans, about on par with a newspaper subscription.
But free or inexpensive isn’t the only upside to hosted blog services. They 
really take the complication out of starting a blog. For the technophobe, a

Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
hosted solution is ideal because you have very few technical issues to worry 
about. Hosted services take care of
	
✓	Web domains
	
✓	Software maintenance and updates
	
✓	Data storage and backup
	
✓	Template design and management
Hosted solutions are also generally quicker to set up than software you have 
to install on your own server, so you can start blogging sooner when you 
choose one of these solutions.
Updates are generally free, and the software is available to the end user 24 
hours a day, 7 days a week. Sounds like a really good deal, huh?
Living with the limitations
Before you sign yourself up, be sure you understand the tradeoffs that come 
with using a hosted blog service. Ultimately, you don’t control your own blog. 
If the company goes out of business, takes servers down for maintenance, or 
decides to change its offerings, you’re pretty much stuck with the results.
A free hosted solution, for example, might suddenly decide it should start 
charging; one that already charges can always raise its rates.
Most hosted solutions let users make some modifications and tweaks, but 
you can’t install your own plug-ins and extras; in many cases, the level of 
customization is quite limited. With hosted blog software, that ubiquitous 
WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) acronym is a double-edged sword: 
You can’t actually do more with less.
	
If you blog on behalf of a company or business, you might want to cross a 
hosted solution off your list for a couple of reasons:
	
✓	You probably need to make your blog part of an existing website, inte­
grated into the look and feel of the company brand; hosted blogs don’t 
allow this customization or integration.
	
✓	With a business blog, you need control of the data. Putting the blog on 
your own server removes any doubts about security or data ownership.

 Chapter 3: Choosing and Hosting Blog Software
	
When you think about whether to use a hosted solution, be sure you under­
stand the terms of service of that host. Some hosts reserve the right to cancel 
or remove your blog or blog posts.
Make sure to read all the fine print for the host that you want to use! You 
don’t want to run into legal restrictions that mean you can’t actually use your 
blog the way you want to, and you definitely don’t want to suddenly find your 
blog missing if the hosted software company decides you’re in violation of its 
rules.
Choosing hosted software
In the following sections, you can take a look at some of the most popular 
hosted platforms to see which might be the best fit for you and your new 
blog. These blogging software packages have been around for quite a while 
and are regarded as some of the best that the blogging community has to 
offer.
Blogger
www.blogger.com
Blogger is the quintessential hosted blogging platform. Started in 1999 at Pyra 
Labs, Blogger weathered the rough Internet waters at the turn of the century 
to become the most well-known hosted blogging platform. The Blogger ser­
vice became incredibly popular, and eventually, Google purchased it. Since 
then, Blogger has introduced many new features and remained one of the 
premier blogging platforms. Blogger has many features that allow bloggers to 
publish multiple blogs:
	
✓	All blogs are free and hosted for you, with no hassles and no mess.
	
✓	Blogger offers a wide variety of free templates to get you going, which 
you can customize in a number of ways.
	
✓	The publishing tool now has Google AdSense (a blog advertising pro­
gram) and other neat elements, such as polls and lists, integrated into it, 
allowing you to add functionality to your blog.
	
✓	If you don’t want Blogger to host your files, you can save all your blog­
ging files to another server.
	
I show you how to get Blogger set up in Chapter 4. Because you can use it so 
easily and set it up quickly (and because it’s free), I encourage all new blog­
gers to use Blogger as a learning tool, even if you plan to use other blog soft­
ware for your real blog.

WordPress.com
www.wordpress.com
In 2005, the popular WordPress blogging platform launched a hosted service, 
in addition to software that you can install on your own server. WordPress.
com, as shown in Figure 3-8, offers a clean, easy-to-use interface, and blog­
gers tend to see it as more flexible than anything else on the market. Now 
that WordPress.com has added new functionality and additional themes, you 
can set it up very quickly.
In short, WordPress.com
	
✓	Is free to use (although there are some premium levels available with 
additional functionality)
	
✓	Has many options for design templates, letting you choose a look that 
suits your content
	
✓	Includes features such as tags and categories, permitting easy organiza­
tion of your posts
	
✓	Offers spellchecking, rich-text editing, and photo uploading
	
✓	Lets you measure your site traffic and statistics to help gauge your 
popularity
	
✓	Integrates an excellent spam-fighting tool, Akismet
	
On WordPress.org, you can get software to install WordPress on your own 
website. I talk more about WordPress.org later in this chapter, and in 
Chapter 5, you can find out more about both versions in detail. 
TypePad
www.typepad.com
TypePad was launched in 2003 to great fanfare. It allows you to do more than 
just blog; it was one of the first blogging platforms to offer the capability 
to create static content pages. TypePad pricing starts at $8.95 a month and 
ranges upward, depending on the services that you include.

ment, which means you don’t need to know HTML
	
✓	Tools that allow you to insert photos into your posts quickly, automati­
cally resizing them and adding thumbnails to blog posts
	
✓	Tools that allow you to quickly place videos and podcasts into your blog 
posts
Tumblr
www.tumblr.com
Tumblr is a fun, and really easy-to-use hosted blogging service — and it’s 
free. Tumblr blogs are a little different, in that it is really easy to re-post mate­
rial from another Tumblr blog to your own blog, so sharing is a big part of the 
Tumblr experience.
Tumblr offers:

Understanding Blog Software That 
You Install on Your Own Server
If technology freaks you out, you can make life easier by using hosted solu­
tions, but bloggers who require more flexibility than hosted solutions offer 
may choose non-hosted blogging packages. Configuring software to your own 
tastes and requirements can really improve the overall quality of your blog, 
making it more attractive to readers and ultimately more successful.
	
Flexibility can make or break your blog. If you have the money and the skills to 
install your own blog software, doing so can give you better tools and control 
over your blog, enabling you to do things like customize the design, add third-
party widgets for serving ads, or dabble in customizing the publishing interface.
Choosing a non-hosted blog isn’t a plug-and-play solution. Unfortunately, 
choosing to install blog software, rather than to use a hosted service, means 
that you need a whole bunch of other technical services to make it all work.
Reaping the benefits
If you use non-hosted blog software, you’re in full control. You can do just 
about anything to the software after you install it:
	
✓	Design personalization: For those who have web design skills, stand-
alone blogs generally are very adaptable. Some blogs have incredibly 
diverse and clever designs, many created by the author of the blog to 
match the style and topic of the blog. Installing the software on your 
web server gives you access to every part of the blog software’s innards, 
from templates to graphics, so you can make your blog as pretty as a 
picture. Or tough. Very tough.

 Chapter 3: Choosing and Hosting Blog Software
	
✓	Customization: A lot of the blogging software available is open source 
(meaning the code for the software package is available to developers 
so that they can manipulate it). Programmers can add, remove, update, 
and improve functionality for each package. Some packages offer many 
different options, and independent programmers might also offer addi­
tional functionality either for free or a low cost.
	
✓	Looking smart: The blogging world has social divisions, just like any 
other, and at the top of the blogging heap, you find geeks. If you want 
to play with the cool nerds, you need to install your own blog software. 
Technical bloggers will recognize your prowess and give you props.
Living with the limitations
The first stumbling block you discover when installing your own blogging 
software is . . . installing your own blogging software. Somehow, you have to 
get the software files onto your server, run the scripts, modify the code, and 
generally muck about in the ugly innards of the software. This process can 
either be simple or a complete nightmare, depending on your technical savvy 
and the complexity of the blog software package that you choose.
	
You can shortcut this issue by choosing a web-hosting company that offers 
blogging software. Most blogging software companies provide a list of web 
hosts who have in-house expertise in handling their software; just browse 
around on the software company’s website to find that list. You can also have 
the blogging software company install the software for you. For a fairly reason­
able fee, you can put that job into the hands of an expert. This solution makes 
sense for one big reason: You need to install the software only once. If you 
don’t already know how to do it yourself, you don’t have to spend hours beat­
ing your head against a wall to obtain knowledge you’ll probably never need 
again.
Of course, all software requires some level of maintenance, and most web 
hosts don’t handle software upgrades and tweaks; be prepared to handle 
those requirements when they come up by doing them yourself or finding an 
expert who can handle them for you.
Using non-hosted software has some other downsides, as well:
	
✓	Design personalization and code customization: Making your blog look 
pretty sounds great, but you need a cornucopia of associated skills to 
make that happen — everything from graphic design to HTML coding. 
If you don’t have these skills yourself or access to someone who does, 
you don’t actually have the ability to customize your blog, despite your 
software.

Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
	
✓	Domain registration and Web hosting: Unlike the hosted systems, you 
can’t avoid spending money to host your own blog software. Several 
costs automatically kick in, such as domain name registration and web 
hosting (explained in the sections “Registering a domain” and “Finding 
Web Hosting,” earlier in this chapter).
	
✓	Technical support: Even if you pay to get the blog software installed for 
you or sign up with a web host that does it automatically, if the software 
breaks (and doesn’t all software break at some point?), many web hosts 
can’t or won’t fix it.
	
✓	Backing up: If you install your own software, you’re responsible for 
making sure that the software and data get backed up or for finding a 
web host that includes backups as part of the hosting package.
Choosing non-hosted blogging software
If you’re ready to make the leap into the deep end of the blogging pool, the 
following sections give you recommendations for a range of well-respected 
non-hosted blogging tools.
WordPress
www.wordpress.org
Since 2003, WordPress has provided a solid platform for new and experi­
enced bloggers who want the control of installing blog software on their own 
computers. Many bloggers say that WordPress is the easiest blogging plat­
form (aside from hosted blogging software) to set up and configure. I cover 
installing and using WordPress in Chapter 5.
	
The interface acts exactly the way the hosted WordPress.com system works. 
That said, if you’re considering using WordPress, sign up for a test blog on 
WordPress.com to get a good preview of how WordPress works.
Here are some of the highlights:
	
✓	WordPress is free!
	
✓	It offers many, many user-submitted and user-prepared designs, ready 
for use.
	
✓	It includes tags and categories, allowing you to organize your posts 
easily.
	
✓	It has editing tools (such as spellchecking), offers common text styles, 
and gives you easy ways to include photos, videos, and other media.

✓	It displays statistics about your visitors to help you understand the traf­
fic to your blog.
	
✓	It fights spam with a range of anti-spam tools.
Movable Type
www.movabletype.com
Movable Type is the grandfather of all installable blogging platforms. 
Released in 2001, it quickly became one of the most popular blogging soft­
ware packages, for geeks and pundits alike. Movable Type was the first blog­
ging software that permitted contributions by multiple authors, and bloggers 
highly regard it for the many ways that you can leverage it to create easily 
updateable websites and blogs.
If you’re serious about looking at hosting your own installation, Moveable 
Type is a strong contender. Movable Type offers
	
✓	A WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editing environment that 
saves you time and effort
	
✓	Easy tools for categorizing your posts, inserting photos and multimedia, 
and spellchecking
	
✓	Automatic generation of RSS feeds to give your blog longevity
	
✓	Searchable content, tags, and other cool tools
	
✓	A range of licensing options for personal, commercial, and educational use
Pricing varies, but the basic commercial installation is $395.95, and you may 
qualify to use the free Blogger license if you are an individual blogger and not 
setting up a blog for an organization or business.
ExpressionEngine
www.expressionengine.com
Back in 2001, a company called pMachine released a blogging software pack­
age called pMachine Pro. pMachine Pro quietly hatched a following based on 
clean interface, solid performance, and flexibility in both design and layout. 
From that success, pMachine built the content management system and blog­
ging software ExpressionEngine, an exceptionally powerful platform.

Part I: Getting Started with Blogs 
Today, pMachine (now known as EllisLab) supports all kinds of sites by using 
ExpressionEngine, which it offers in both commercial and personal flavors. 
Like Movable Type, ExpressionEngine is highly regarded by web developers 
because it offers great blogging tools, but it’s flexible enough to be used to 
develop all kinds of websites — not just blogs.
ExpressionEngine users have
	
✓	The capability to run multiple blogs that have many contributors
	
✓	A powerful templating engine
	
✓	Additional modules and community plug-ins, including mailing lists, 
forums, and photo galleries
	
✓	Strong comment moderation and prevention tools
	
✓	Different levels of user access, allowing administrators to control what 
blogs and templates users can edit
ExpressionEngine’s commercial license runs you $299.95, the non-profit/
personal version is $149.95, and there is a Freelancer license for smaller-
presence websites for $99.95.
Installing blog software
After you purchase your domain and web hosting, you can get into the nitty-
gritty technical tasks: installing your blog software. To get started, look for 
installation instructions on your blog software company’s website. Each blog­
ging package has a set of instructions for doing the job yourself and details 
about hiring company technical support to do the job for you.
	
Keep in mind that installing blog software is a one-time task! When you finish, 
you never need to do it again, and you probably don’t need the skills neces­
sary to install the software in order to use your blog.
Unfortunately, the steps that you need to take to install a particular blog 
application vary dramatically from software to software, so I can’t give you 
detailed step-by-step directions. Each blog software package has its own par­
ticular requirements for installation, but the general process follows these 
steps:
	
1.	 Download the latest version of your blogging software.
	
2.	 Uncompress the package and upload it to your new web host by using 
FTP (file transfer protocol).
	
3.	 Execute the installation application associated with your software.

 Chapter 3: Choosing and Hosting Blog Software
To make your installation experience as trouble-free as possible, watch out 
for the following common problems:
	
✓	File location: When you upload your blog package, make sure that you 
upload it to the correct location. All web hosts tell you where to place 
your web files and software so that visitors can find your blog. If you put 
your files in the wrong place, no one can access your blog.
	
✓	Database requirements: Sometimes, you need to create a database prior 
to installing your blog software. Each web host has a different procedure 
for creating a database, so if your installation instructions mention this 
requirement, consult the web host documentation or support materials 
to find out how to set things up properly.
Sound like gibberish? The truth is that almost anyone can use blogging 
software, but only quite technically advanced computer users can install it 
themselves. If you’re a web designer or developer, you may be able to install 
the software yourself. If you aren’t technical but want to be, this project gives 
you the chance to really get your hands dirty.
However, if tech stuff makes you cringe, you can investigate having someone 
else install the software. My main advice is to find a professional:
	
✓	Web designers: Many people who build websites for a living can help 
would-be bloggers get blogging software installed and running. Of 
course, you need to pay these folks for their time, so shop around for 
several quotes to get the best deal.
	
✓	Blogging software companies: The best blogging software companies 
offer inexpensive solutions to this problem: They install the software for 
you on your own website. Check with the blogging software company to 
see whether it offers this service.
	
✓	Web-hosting companies: Some web hosts install software for you if you 
ask (and pay them), and some even offer a one-click installation. These 
one-click installations can save bloggers from headaches, pain, and mid­
night crying sessions. You just click a button to install the desired blog­
ging software on your web server. If this option sounds appealing, check 
with the web host you’re eyeing before you sign up to see whether it 
offers one-click blog software installations.
	
Many blogging software companies have figured out that installing blog soft­
ware creates a real barrier to the nontechnical customer. As a result, you 
can often go to a blogging software company’s website and find a list of web-
hosting companies that offer one-click installation for a particular blogging 
platform.

art of the beauty of a blog is how quickly and easily you can get going. 
You can go from zero to blog in about ten minutes by using good blog 
software, especially if you go with hosted blog software. One such is Blogger, 
which is the focus of this chapter. I show you how to set up a blog with 
Blogger, write and publish blog posts by using its interface, manage your set­
tings, and customize your template to make your space on the web unique.
If you’re unfamiliar with hosted blog software versus server-based software, 
flip to Chapter 3 for an introduction to blog software. In Chapter 5, you can 
find an introduction to WordPress, which offers both hosted and server-
based blogging software. And in Chapter 6, you discover Tumblr, a short 
form of blogging called micro blogging.
Starting a Blog with Blogger
You can’t find a better place to get introduced to blogging than Blogger 
(www.blogger.com). It’s free, fast, and easy to use. Because you can get 
started so easily, you can use Blogger to play with code and discover how 
blogging works without having to invest a lot of time and energy in web serv­
ers and complicated installation processes.
Blogger promises to get you blogging in three steps: Create an account, name 
your blog, and choose a template.
	
Each hosted blog software platform has a different process for getting started, 
but each one requires the same kind of information: your contact information 
and a name for your blog.

Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
Creating an account
Before signing up with Blogger, you need login information (a username and 
password), which you can get in a couple of ways:
	
✓	Through a Google account: If you have an account with one of Google’s 
services, such as Gmail, you can log in to Blogger by using that account 
information. (Blogger was acquired by the popular search engine com­
pany in 2002.)
	
✓	Through Blogger: If you don’t have a Google account, you get one when 
you sign up with Blogger.
To sign up for Blogger when you don’t have a Google account, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the Get Started button on the Blogger home page (www.
blogger.com).
	
2.	Type your e-mail address in the Email Address text box. Re-type your 
e-mail into the second e-mail text box.
	
3.	Choose a password and type it in the Enter a Password text box.
	
	When you type your password, Blogger indicates whether you need to 
increase the password strength — meaning how difficult it would be for 
someone to guess your password. Click the Password Strength link for 
more information about creating a more secure password.
	
4.	Retype the password in the Retype Password text box.
	
5.	Type the name that you want to associate with your blog in the 
Display Name text box.
	
6.	Select the Email Notifications check box if you want to receive infor­
mational e-mails from Blogger.
	
	 If you don’t want to receive these e-mails, leave the check box deselected.
	
7.	Type your numeric birth date into the Birthday text box.
	
8.	In the Word Verification text box, enter the word shown as an image.
	
9.	Select the Acceptance of Terms check box.
	
	 You can read the Terms of Service to see what you’re agreeing to by 
clicking the Terms of Service link.
	
10.	Click Continue to start a new blog, and then move on to the following 
section in this chapter.
To sign up for Blogger by using an existing Google account, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Type your Google account username and password into the appropri­
ate text boxes on the Blogger home page (www.blogger.com).

2.	Click Sign In.
	
	 The Blogger Dashboard appears.
	
3.	Click the New Blog link in the Dashboard, and then check out the fol­
lowing section in this chapter.
Naming your blog
When you have a Blogger account set up, you can choose a name for your 
blog. If you’re creating a blog that you plan to actually use (rather than just 
test, a topic that I discuss in Chapter 3), give a lot of thought to the name 
that you choose. Your blog name needs to accurately portray your blog’s 
tone and content. If you plan to use this blog as a test space, don’t worry 
too much about choosing a name that has a lot of meaning, but be sure you 
choose something that you can remember!
To name your Blogger blog, follow these steps:
	
1.	Type the name of the blog in the Blog Title text box.
	
2.	Decide what phrase you want to use in your URL and type it in the 
Blog Address text box.
	
	 A URL (uniform resource locator) is better known as a web address. To 
open your blog, visitors type this address into the address bar of their 
web browsers. You can use any word or phrase that you want as a URL, as 
long as someone else isn’t using it, but you probably want to keep it short, 
sweet, and memorable so that others can get to your blog quickly and 
easily. You can’t use spaces or punctuation, except dashes, in your URL.
	
	 You can type about 35 characters in this text box.
	
	 As your type, Google will check to see whether your URL is available and 
display the status of that check below the text box.
	
3.	Click the Check Availability link to see whether the web address you 
want to use is available. If it isn’t, type a new phrase into the Blog 
Address text box and try again.
	
	 You might have to make several tries to find an available blog address — 
Blogger is popular!
	
4.	Select one of the Template styles shown by clicking on the image.
	
	 You can change this selection later.
	
5.	Click the Create Blog button.
	
	 Blogger sets up your new blog and takes you to the Dashboard.

After you complete this setup process, you don’t need to repeat it when you 
want to add a post to your blog. The next time you come to Blogger, simply 
use the login boxes on the home page to log in and get started posting to your 
blog.
Using the Dashboard
When Blogger sets up your blog, it adds it to a Dashboard (see Figure 4-1) 
that displays your new blog and any others you may have. You can use the 
Dashboard to get quickly to common tasks, like writing a new post, checking 
your stats, and viewing your blog.
To write a blog post, click the orange Pencil button next to the name of your 
blog. The View Blog button opens your blog, allowing you to view it the same 
way your visitors will see it.
The Posts drop-down list gives you access to all your past posts, pages, com­
ments, stats, earnings information, layout, template, and blog settings. Simply 
click the arrow in the Posts drop-down list to view all the options, as shown 
in Figure 4-1.

 Chapter 4: Starting a Blogger Blog
Writing a Post
You officially join the blogosphere by writing your very first blog post, an 
entry, for your new blog. (The blogosphere, by the way, is the semi-ironic way 
that bloggers refer to themselves, their blogs, and the phenomena that is 
blogging today. You’re a member of the blogosphere when you have a blog, 
regardless of whether you think it’s the dumbest word you’ve heard this 
year.)
The mechanics of writing a blog post aren’t much different from writing an 
e-mail. Bloggers usually make most posts quite short, and they write those 
posts directly and conversationally. Of course, you might decide to use your 
blog to write the next Great American Novel, in which case, your posts might 
be quite a bit longer than what’s standard! That’s fine, too. Every blog takes 
on a personality and life of its own. If you want to find your own narrative 
voice for your blog, go to Chapter 7.
	
If you’ve used a web-based e-mail service such as Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo!, 
the Blogger software feels very familiar. To create the post, you simply have 
to fill in the appropriate text boxes in a form, format the text, and then send it 
off to its destination — in this case, to your blog, rather than a friend’s e-mail 
inbox.
Follow these steps to write a blog post on Blogger:
	
1.	From the Blogger home screen, click the orange Pencil button next to 
your blog’s name.
	
	 Blogger opens the Publish entry screen, as shown in Figure 4-2.
	
2.	Enter a title for your post in the Title text box.
	
	 Titles are a lot like newspaper headlines: They should be catchy and 
informative, and they should encourage visitors to your blog to continue 
reading the rest of the post.
	
3.	Write your post in the large text box.
	
	 Consider writing your blog posts in a standard word-processing pro­
gram, such as Notepad or Microsoft Word — and then saving that post. 
Too many bloggers have spent hours composing right in the entry box 
of their blog software, only to find that their Internet connection has 
failed or another technical problem has occurred — which results in a 
lost post. You don’t want to lose all your carefully considered prose just 
because your cat pulled the cable modem out of the wall! It’s safer to 
compose offline, and then simply copy and paste the text into the blog 
software.

If you know how to write HTML code, you can also try composing your post in

as needed. If you want to find out more about coding HTML, I discuss common 
tags in Appendix B.

Adding a link
The Link icon deserves special attention. You use this icon whenever you 
want to link to another blog, a news story, that embarrassing website that 
your best friend just created, or any other page on the web.
When you want to create a clickable link in your blog post, follow these steps:
	
1.	Highlight the text that you want to make clickable by clicking and 
dragging.
	
2.	Click the Link icon.
	
	 A pop-up window appears, as shown in Figure 4-3.
	
3.	Enter the URL of the website to which you want to link and click OK.
	
	 Include the full URL of the web page in this text box. Don’t delete the 
http:// that’s prefilled in the form for you. The URL you use should 
look like this:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/supersusie/6166429107

	 And not this:
www.flickr.com/photos/supersusie/6166429107
	
	 You can most easily make sure that you have the right link by going to the 
web page to which you want to link, copy the URL from the address bar 
(press Ctrl+C to copy and then Ctrl+V to paste; on a Mac, use Ô rather 
than Ctrl). To make sure the link is going to the right page, you can click 
the Test This Link link in the Edit Link window to preview the page.
	
	 After you click OK, the linked text appears as underlined blue text in 
your post. It doesn’t become clickable until you publish it.
	
Don’t forget that if you know HTML and would prefer to create the link manu­
ally by using HTML code, you can do so on the HTML tab.
Spellchecking your text
Blogger provides a handy tool for anyone who needs help with spelling (and 
who doesn’t?). After you finish writing your post, click the Check Spelling 
icon. It’s the icon that shows the letters ABC with a checkmark below them 
(refer to Figure 4-2).
Blogger highlights incorrectly spelled words in yellow. Click any misspelled 
word to see a list of suggested alternatives. Select any suggestion from the 
list or simply type your own correction.
Including an image
You can make your blog post more appealing by including an image. 
Longtime bloggers can tell you that adding a photo or artwork encourages 
visitors to read more of the surrounding text. And, of course, everyone knows 
how many words that photo is worth!
Blogger has some good built-in tools that allow you to upload an image that’s 
already the right size and format for displaying on the web. If you need help 
formatting photographs from a digital camera or another source, Chapter 11 
shows you how.
Follow these steps to upload an image from your computer and add it to your 
blog post:
	
1.	Click the Add Image icon.
	
	 It looks like a photograph (refer to Figure 4-2).
	
	 The Upload window opens.

2.	Click the Choose Files button to upload an image on your computer.
	
	 A File Upload dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 4-4.
	
3.	Locate the image that you want to upload from your computer and 
select it.
	
4.	Click Open.
	
	 The image is uploaded to Blogger.
	
5.	Click Add Selected from the lower-right corner of the Upload screen.
	
	 The image is placed in your blog post.
	
6.	Select the image and then choose your image formatting options (see 
Figure 4-4):
 
• Image Size: Determines how large the display of the image is in 
your blog post, regardless of the dimensions of the source image. 
You can choose Small, Medium, or Large.
 
• Alignment: Determines how text wraps around the image. You can 
choose None, Left, Center, or Right.
 
• Caption: Places text directly under the image.

You can also add an image to your post from another website, as long as you 
have permission to use the image or it’s in the public domain. (Read more 
about copyright in Chapter 8.) You can add an image from a site easily by 
using Blogger. Just follow these steps:
	
1.	Find an image or photo on the web that you want to use.
	
	 Make sure that you’re allowed to use it by checking copyright permis­
sion or asking the creator.
	
2.	Right-click the image and select Copy Image Location from the menu 
that opens.
	
	 Phrasing of this option may differ in different browsers. If you don’t see 
anything that looks right, choose Properties from the menu. A window 
opens that shows you the URL address, which you can then click and 
drag to highlight. Press Ctrl+C to copy the address (Ô+C on a Mac).
	
3.	Head back to Blogger and start a new post, or open one that you’ve 
already created.
	
4.	Click the Add Image icon.
	
	 It looks like a photograph (refer to Figure 4-2).
	
	 The Upload window opens.
	
5.	Choose the From a URL link and press Ctrl+V (Ô+V on the Mac) to 
paste the image address into the image URL text box on the right of 
the window.
	
	 Blogger loads a preview of your image.
	
6.	Click the Add Selected button to insert the photo in your post.
	
7.	Click to select the image to choose from image formatting options 
(refer to Figure 4-4):
 
• Image Size: Determines how large the display of the image is in 
your blog post, regardless of the dimensions of the source image. 
You can choose Small, Medium, or Large.
 
• Alignment: Determines how text wraps around the image. You can 
choose None, Left, Center, or Right.
 
• Caption: Places text directly under the image.
Publishing Your Post
When you’re satisfied with your blog post, you can publish it so that the 
world can admire your erudition. Publishing a post isn’t hard: Click the 
orange Publish button at the top of the page. Your post appears on your blog, 
making it available for others to read.

 Chapter 4: Starting a Blogger Blog
Before you publish, you can take advantage of three areas of the Blogger 
Publish page that I find very helpful: previewing, saving as a draft, and select­
ing post options.
Previewing your post
Before you publish, you can preview what you’ve created by clicking the 
Preview button (found at the top-right of the browser window). This preview 
is WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get), which means that it shows you 
the post exactly as you formatted it, including links, text colors, embedded 
images, and so on. The Preview is shown in a new browser window.
	
I like to preview my post before I publish because I can more easily read for 
meaning and content at this point. Think of the preview as a last chance to 
catch grammar problems or even to think twice about what you’re posting if 
it’s controversial. Of course, you can also see how the text and content flow 
around any images that you’ve added.
If you see changes that you want to make, simply switch back to the editing 
screen, make your changes, and click the Preview button again.
Configuring post settings
To the right of your blog post, you see the post settings links. These let you 
decide on a number of important ways your post is handled by Blogger, from 
when the post is published, to whether you allow comments.
Scheduling your post
Many bloggers like to create posts in advance of when they plan to publish 
them. For example, if you’re planning a vacation, you can write several posts 
before you leave. When you put them into Blogger, click the Schedule link 
to the right of the post box before you publish your post. Set the date and 
time you want your post to go live, click Done, and when you click Publish, 
Blogger will hold your post until that point.
By default, Blogger sets the publication date and time of the entry to the date 
and time that you began writing that entry. You might choose to change the 
date or time for a number of reasons:
	
✓	Social or professional reasons:
 
• Create a blog post for a friend’s birthday and make the date match 
the time your friend was born.
 
• If you’re blogging at work, you might want to set your date and 
time to a period when you weren’t supposed to also be at your 
www.it-ebooks.info

Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
desk (ahem) working. Chapter 2 discusses blogging and workplace 
issues in detail (and recommends that you don’t blog at work, 
unless that’s part of your job responsibility).
	
✓	To work around your schedule:
 
• If you take a long time to write a post, by the time you’re ready to 
publish it, you might need to put a more realistic time on the entry.
 
• If you save your post as a draft and publish it later, you can update 
the date and time to accurately reflect the real publication date.
Allowing comments
You can choose whether you want readers to be able to comment on your 
blog post by selecting the Options link under Post settings. There are three 
options: Allow; Don’t Allow, Show Existing; and Don’t Allow, Hide Existing. 
Don’t Allow, Show Existing keeps already-posted comments visible, even 
though no one can add new comments.
	
You can make the decision to turn off comments at any time, so if you decide 
later that you don’t want to receive further comments, you can always edit the 
entry and turn off this option then.
Most of the time, you want to allow comments; after all, part of what makes 
a blog exciting to read is the opportunity to interact with the blogger. 
Sometimes, though, you might write an entry that you don’t want to read 
discussion about, perhaps because you don’t want to start a long argument 
or because the entry has become a target of spammers. You can find more 
about interacting with your reading community and preventing spam in 
Chapter 9.
Launching your post
Once you have the text and photos laid out nicely and you’ve chosen your 
settings, it’s time to publish! This is pretty hard, so get ready:
	
1.	Click the Publish button at the top of your blog post.
	
2.	Ha ha, just kidding, there is no Step 2! Your post is on your blog. Go 
take a look.
Viewing Your Blog Post
After you publish, you can see how your post looks on the blog. You may find 
this step rewarding — and you definitely don’t want to skip it. Even if you 
preview your post before publishing, you haven’t seen your post in the way 
www.it-ebooks.info

91
 Chapter 4: Starting a Blogger Blog
that your readers see it. You can do that only by actually going to your blog 
as it appears to everyone on the web and taking a look.
Computers can still make errors or fail between the moment you click 
Publish and when the entry shows up on the blog. I like to look at my blog 
every time I post a new entry to make sure that it actually looks right on the 
page and that the blog software successfully processed it.
When you click Blogger’s Publish button, the system provides you with a 
handy link to view your blog. Click View Blog to head over to your blog and 
see your handiwork.
Of course, if you prefer taking the long way, you can always type the web 
address (the one that you chose when you set up your blog) into the web 
browser to see your blog without going through the Blogger Dashboard.
	
While you look at your blog, make sure the formatting, images, and text look 
the way that you want them to and click any links that you created. If anything 
doesn’t work quite properly, go back into Blogger and make changes to your 
entry.
Selecting the Dashboard Settings
Blog software, as a rule, is quite customizable. As the owner of the blog, you 
can decide a number of things about the way your blog looks and works, 
and you can control those elements from the control panel — called the 
Dashboard in Blogger — of your blog software.
Most blog software packages work quite similarly, and if you know how 
Blogger works, you can make the most of any other software.
Blogger divides its settings into several areas: Basic, Posts and Comments, 
Mobile and Email, Language and Formatting, and Other. I cover important 
highlights from the settings in the following sections.
You access all the Blogger settings via the Blogger Dashboard. (In other blog 
software packages, this area is called the control panel, the admin panel, and 
so on.) To reach the Dashboard, just log in to the Blogger website. If you’re 
already logged in, look for a link to the Dashboard in the upper-left corner of 
any page and click it. My Dashboard is shown in Figure 4-1.
The Dashboard shows all the blogs that you’ve started with Blogger. For each 
blog, you can quickly start a new post, view your blog, or jump into other 
areas. A single click takes you into the blog settings, or to the template or 
layout that you’re using.

Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
	
You can access all the Blogger settings for your blog from the Dashboard. 
Look for the Posts drop-down list (it looks like two pieces of paper) next to the 
blog you want to configure, and click the arrow to open the menu. Selecting 
the Settings option (refer to Figure 4-1) takes you into the right area to do 
everything discussed in this section.
Making basic changes
From the Basic Settings area, you can change the name of your blog (Blogger 
refers to this name as the blog title) and also give it a short description. Most 
of the Blogger templates display the description near the top of the page. 
Even if you change the title on your blog page, the URL that readers type into 
a browser to visit your blog stays the same, but you can also change the URL.
You can also add authors to your blog — people who can also contribute 
blog posts, creating a group blog. To add someone as an author, you simply 
need that person’s e-mail address. If the person you’re adding has a Blogger 
or Google account, I recommend using that address so that all his or her 
Blogger and Google account services are tied together.
If you aren’t happy with the web address for your blog, you can edit the 
address by changing the Blog*Spot Address setting. For instance, if you 
start a blog called My New Kitten Maggie and your cat grows up (they do 
that, I hear), you might want to edit both the name and the location of your 
blog. (You have to make the name change on the Basic Settings tab, which I 
describe in the preceding section.) Use the Publishing tab to change the URL. 
For example, you can change
http://mynewkittenmaggie.blogspot.com
into
http://mygrownupcatmaggie.blogspot.com
	
You can change your address only to one that another Blogger member isn’t 
already using, so you may have to make several tries before you find one 
that’s available. Although you can make changes to the URL of your blog, 
remember that doing so means that no one can access your blog from the pre­
vious address, so anyone who has bookmarked your blog or memorized the 
address can’t reach you after you make the change.
Follow these steps to change your blog’s name, add a description, edit the 
URL, give authors access, or limit readership:
	
1.	From the Dashboard, click the Pages menu and select Settings.
	
	 The Basic Settings page opens, shown in Figure 4-5.

2.	Edit the Title and/or Description.
	
3.	Edit the Blog Address/URL.
	
4.	Give others permission to post to your blog: 
	
a.	Click the Add Authors link in the Permissions area of the Basic 
Settings page.
	
	A pop-up window appears with a text box for addresses.
	
b.	Type or paste the e-mail address of the author you want to add, 
and click OK, as shown in Figure 4-5.
	
	Blogger sends an e-mail invitation to the address(es) you provided.
	
5.	Choose who should be able to read your blog from the Blog Readers 
area:
 
• Anybody: Anyone with Internet access and the blog address can 
read your blog.
 
• Only These Readers: Restrict access to selected people; you need 
the e-mail addresses of those you want to give reading access.
 
• Only Blog Authors: Only people you have added as authors on the 
blog can read the blog.

Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
Making comment changes
Comments are both strengths and weaknesses of the blog medium. Both 
readers and bloggers find the capability to leave a comment, which lets you 
interact or converse with a blogger, very attractive.
	
Commenting has a downside: Spammers have discovered the comment tech­
nology, as well. Just as with e-mail, you can expect some commenters to tell 
you about fabulous mortgage opportunities, Mexican pharmaceuticals, and 
other less-than-savory possibilities — information neither you nor your read­
ers want.
The Posts and Comments settings help you reduce spam on your blog. One of 
the best ways to reduce spam is to specify who can comment on your blog. 
From the Posts and Comments screen, select an option from the Who Can 
Comment options:
	
✓	Anyone: This option allows the widest possible audience, with no limita­
tions on who can comment. It provides no spam prevention, but it also 
imposes no barriers to leaving a comment to genuine commenters.
	
✓	Registered Users: Sets your blog to accept comments only from reg­
istered members of Blogger so that you can cut down on some spam. 
Don’t forget that not everyone has a Blogger account — or wants one — 
so you might lose some real comments.
	
✓	Users with Google Accounts: Because Google validates the accounts it 
creates, letting users who have Google accounts leave comments can help 
ensure that you get comments from humans, rather than spammers.
	
✓	Only Members of the Blog: Prevents anyone who isn’t a member of your 
blog from leaving a comment. No one you haven’t personally authorized 
as a member can leave a comment. This option creates a lot of work for 
you because you have to maintain the list of authorized members, but 
you don’t get any spam.
	
You can add members to your blog from the Basic Settings page.
Also on the Posts and Comments page, you can specify your comment mod­
eration options. Change the Enable Comment Moderation setting to Always. 
Turning on comment moderation prevents anyone from posting a comment 
that you haven’t approved. When someone leaves a comment, you get an 
e-mail that lets you know about the comment. From the Dashboard, you can 
authorize or reject the publication of the comment. You can also moderate 
comments via e-mail.

Moderating comments is a lot of work for you, but it improves the quality and 
readability of comments on your blog for your readers, and it discourages 
spammers in the future.
Making e-mail changes
On the Mobile and Email settings page, you can turn on a cool feature that 
allows you to post to your blog by sending an e-mail message. When it’s con­
figured, you can simply send an e-mail to the address from any device capa­
ble of sending e-mail (such as your smartphone!). The subject of the e-mail 
becomes the title of the blog post, and the text of the e-mail is the entry 
body. It’s a very quick, easy way to publish to your blog, which makes it great 
for when you’re traveling.
To set up a Mail2Blogger address, click on the Email & Mobile Settings tab 
and fill out the Email Posting Address text box. Be sure to save the settings 
and test to make sure that it works!
	
In the Mobile and Email page, you can enter an e-mail address in the Comment 
Notification text box at which you want to receive notification when someone 
leaves a comment on your blog. This setting helps you keep track of com­
ments left on your blog, especially when you have a lot of old posts on which 
you might not see comments when you view your blog.
You can also set up your phone with Blogger so that you can post using SMS/
MMS. This is especially cool for photo bloggers who use their phones to cap­
ture images.
Customizing Your Blog
The look that you picked when you started your blog might be just fine, 
but many bloggers want to tweak and customize the look and feel of their 
blogs — I know I did when I started working on my blog. I was using personal 
words and pictures, and I wanted to make the rest of the site look more like 
my own website, rather than a Blogger design.
Blogger differentiates between the template and layout of your blog. The 
template dictates the look of the blog; the layout is the placement of the ele­
ments of the blog.

Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
When you start your Blogger blog, you choose a template and that template 
determines the look and feel of your blog, as well as the placement of the ele­
ments and what those elements are. However, you should think of the tem­
plate and the layout it comes with as a starting point; it’s not set in stone.
You can change the look of a Blogger blog in four ways:
	
✓	Change the template you are using completely.
	
✓	Customize an existing template using the Template Designer.
	
✓	Create your own template in HTML (see the “Editing templates old-
skool: Using code” sidebar).
	
✓	Edit the layout of your template to move, add, and remove elements.
Choosing a new template
One of the fun features of Blogger allows you to choose from a number of 
templates for your blog. The template determines both the look and feel of 
your blog, and also how the blog elements appear on the page. Blogger has 
many templates to choose from, and don’t forget that you can customize or 
change the template later if your first choice no longer looks as fresh in six 
months. (For more info, see the “Using the Template Designer” section, later 
in this chapter.)
To choose a template, follow these steps:
Editing templates old-skool: Using code
If you’re a web designer or coder, and you 
want to sink your teeth into the Blogger tem­
plate itself, you can do so. To get to the code 
from the Blogger Dashboard, select Template 
from the blog’s Posts and click Edit HTML for 
the template you’re using.
From here, you can edit the HTML and save as 
you go. Blogger recommends only advanced 
users use this tool. You should be proficient with 
HTML and CSS, and know a certain amount of 
Blogger’s own coding language, to successfully 
edit these files.
Blogger suggests that using the Template 
Designer gives you good options without as 
much risk of breaking your blog.

Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
Using the Template Designer
Don’t know any HTML, but still want to tweak certain elements of your blog’s 
design just a little? You’re in luck — the Blogger Template Designer gives you 
some excellent tools to do just that. In fact, I think you’ll be pleasantly sur­
prised to discover just how many things you can change easily.
The Template Designer gives you the capability to change:
	
✓	The font face, size, and color of text, links, navigation elements, and 
sidebar elements.
	
✓	The background color and/or image.
	
✓	Widths of the columns on your blog
	
✓	Layouts of your blog to use one, two, three, four, or even five columns.
	
In fact, you can even use the Template Designer to insert some of your own 
custom styles, if you’re up-to-date with HTML and CSS.
To use the Blogger Template Designer, follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Dashboard, select Template from the Posts drop-down list.
	
2.	Click the Customize button under the Template you’re currently 
using.
	
	 The Template Designer opens.
	
3.	Click the Background link in the left column and click the thumbnail 
in the Background Image box.
	
	 The Select Background Image window opens.
	
4.	Browse the available backgrounds and select one in order to preview 
it, as shown in Figure 4-7.
	
	Looking for something specific? Choose one of the image categories 
in the left side of the window to see topically selected images, like 
Shopping, Technology, or Nature.
	
	 You can upload an image from your computer to use as a background by 
selecting Upload image.
	
5.	Click Done.
	
6.	If desired, choose a new color theme from the options in the 
Background page of the Template Designer.
	
	 The themes set background, link, text, and other element colors.

	 Color: Select a color for the element, using the following selection 
suggestions:
 
• Hexadecimal Code: If you know the hexadecimal code for the 
color that you want to use, you can type it into this text box. 
Hexadecimal code is a code that contains letters and numbers that 
equate to a color. Primarily, graphic and web designers use hexa­
decimal codes, so don’t worry if this seems like gibberish to you.
 
• Color Picker: Click the drop-down list on the color picker to really 
fine-tune an exact color choice (see Figure 4-8).
 
• Colors from This Template: These colors are already in use in your 
template.
 
• Suggested Colors: This palette shows colors that Blogger thinks fit 
well with the colors already in use.
 
• Background Color: Choose a color for the background of the ele­
ment you are customizing. The ways you can select a color are the 
same as for the font color choices.
	
	 When you click a color, Blogger shows a preview of how it looks on your 
blog in the lower half of the screen.

	 A Blogger page opens, displaying a confirmation that it has saved your 
edits. You can return to the Blogger home page or continue making 
changes in the Template Designer.
Editing page elements
The Layout area of Blogger (see Figure 4-9) gives you, the blogger, a ground-
breaking tool that allows you to have detailed control over the layout and 
look of your blog without requiring you to become an HTML guru and stay 
up late figuring out the intricacies of web publishing. This kind of editing 
control reflects the growing do-it-yourself attitude found in the blogosphere: 
Bloggers want sites that reflect their own sensibilities, but not everyone has 
the time to become an expert or the budget to hire one.
This access also reflects the growing expertise of many computer users who 
can edit photographs and create graphics, and it gives them the capability to 
make the most of those skills.
In the Layout screen (see Figure 4-9), a wireframe of your blog template 
appears. A wireframe is a visual representation of the template layout that 
uses only outlines, or boxes, of the elements.

The following list explains how you can use the wireframe features to cus­
tomize your page:
	
✓	Edit page elements. Click the Edit link for any page element that is 
already being used to change its formatting. What you can change 
depends on what kind of element it is, and the features Blogger has 
given you access to. For example, clicking Edit on the Blog Posts area 
lets you edit:
 
• The number of posts on the page
 
• The date style
 
• Wording of the byline, labels, and comments areas
 
• Social networking sharing tools like Twitter, Facebook, and 
Google+
 
• Ad placement in your page
 
• The order of elements in a blog post
	
✓	Add a gadget. Click the Add a Gadget link to place in your sidebar polls, 
images, lists, advertising, and more from a library of Blogger-provided 
elements. You have many to choose from, but here’s a quick list to give 
you a feel for the options:
 
• Poll
 
• List
 
• Link List
 
• Picture
 
• Google AdSense (see Chapter 18)
 
• Text
 
• HTML/third-party functionality
 
• RSS or Atom feed (more about RSS in Chapter 14)
 
• Video clips
 
• Logos
 
• Your profile
 
• Headlines

f you spend much time looking at blogs or talking to bloggers, you can’t 
miss references to WordPress, one of the best-known and well-liked blog­
ging software options available today. WordPress comes in two flavors — 
hosted and installable. In this chapter, I focus on working with the installable 
version that you place on your own web server.
This chapter runs through an overview of how to install WordPress on your 
server, use the administration panel, play with themes and widgets, and find 
out where to connect with other WordPress users in your local community 
and online.
	
I can cover only so much detail in a single chapter, so if you want to dive into 
greater detail about WordPress and find out how you can keep your software 
installation healthy for a long time to come, invest in a copy of WordPress For 
Dummies, 4th Edition, by Lisa Sabin-Wilson (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).
Choosing between WordPress.com 
and WordPress.org
Some blog software is available as both a hosted service and a version that 
you can download and install. WordPress is one of those packages. (For a 
refresher on hosted versus server-based blogging software, see Chapter 3.)

Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
References to WordPress (Figure 5-1) are uniformly about the version of the 
software that you download and install on your own server. You can check it 
out online at www.wordpress.org. However, the option at WordPress.com 
is a hosted version. Fortunately, you can use both types of WordPress for 
free.
When WordPress.com was launched, many bloggers rejoiced because 
WordPress had reached the blogging mainstream. Bloggers could now create 
blogs with ease and use the tools that they had come to love without having 
to tinker in the background or stress over how to maintain those blogs.

platform.
	
Open source software
WordPress is open source software, which 
means that its source code — the programming 
that runs the application — is freely accessi­
ble to developers who want to customize it or 
create new software from or for it.
Also, you can freely distribute open source soft­
ware, and no one places restrictions on how 
you (or anyone else) can use it. In fact, one of 
the few terms of using open source software is 
that you can’t place restrictions on the use or 
distribution of what you create from it.

A free and hosted service. The 
WordPress.com service deals 
with daily maintenance, such as 
backups and software updates.
You can’t implement 
custom themes (you 
have to choose from 
about 70 themes).
 
Security is a little better than 
some hosting services: Your 
blogs are replicated in three dif­
ferent locations, thus keeping 
your blog posts safe.
You can’t upload any 
custom widgets.
 
You gain the benefits of the 
WordPress.com community’s 
featured blog postings and 
shared content.
You can’t customize the 
WordPress software.

It’s free.
You must install and 
maintain the software 
yourself.
 
You can fully customize the 
WordPress software; you can 
also use any theme you like or 
create your own.
Needing your own 
domain and web hosting 
adds to your costs.
Choosing a version of WordPress looks daunting, doesn’t it? It really isn’t. 
You just need to ask yourself these questions: How nerdy are you? Do you 
like fiddling with the dials? Jiggling the handle? If your answers are positive, 
then you should continue reading this chapter! If not, WordPress.com may be 
the WordPress for you.
	
Still stuck? You can find additional information about the two options at 
http://support.wordpress.com/com-vs-org.
Installing WordPress
In this chapter, I focus on installing and using WordPress on your own web 
server. (If you think the hosted version is what you need, just point your web 
browser to www.wordpress.com and follow the simple sign-up instructions 
to get started.)

You can get your WordPress installation up and running without a huge 
amount of difficulty, but in order to get your site going, you need to follow 
some very important steps.
	
Although this chapter walks you through the process, you can also follow 
along with WordPress’s instructions, located at http://codex.wordpress.
org/Installing_WordPress.
Registering a domain
Do you know what you want to call your blog yet? Do you have a domain 
already? When you’re itching to get your blog online and want to control 
every aspect, the domain is the first thing that you need.
A domain is the name and brand of your blog, and the web address (or URL). 
It gives visitors an idea of what your blog is about and who you are. You can 
have some fun getting creative with your blog name! Before committing to a 
blog name, why not see what others have done? The following list gives you 
five examples of some of the world’s top blogs and their domains:
	
✓	Engadget (www.engadget.com): A technology blog that talks about 
gadgets
	
✓	Tech Crunch (www.techcrunch.com): A technology-industry blog
	
✓	Boing Boing (www.boingboing.net): A blog that talks about almost 
anything
	
✓	Lifehacker (www.lifehacker.com): A site that suggests ways that you 
can make your life better and more efficient
	
✓	ReadWriteWeb (www.readwriteweb.com): A site featuring several 
blogs that talk about web technology
The domains in the preceding list make quite an impression, even if, at first 
glance, they don’t necessarily tell the visitor what they write about. If you 
find and bookmark a blog that you like, you keep going back for the great 
content, not the domain name. In Chapter 3, I talk about acquiring domains in 
detail, if you need a refresher about them.

 Chapter 5: Starting a WordPress Blog
Selecting web hosting
After you choose an appropriate domain for your blog, you need somewhere 
for your WordPress install to live. In Chapter 3, I tell you what to look for in 
web hosting and make some recommendations. Don’t forget that you can also 
ask other bloggers what host they use and what their experience has been.
If you’ve read Chapter 3 of this book, you already know that web software 
such as WordPress has certain technical requirements. The requirements for 
WordPress are
	
✓	PHP 4.3 or greater
	
✓	MySQL 4.0 or greater
	
✓	The mod_rewrite Apache module
Most web hosts have similar configurations and should be able to handle 
what you need, but you can review the official WordPress requirements 
page at http://wordpress.org/about/requirements. They also have 
a handy bit of text that you can copy and send to potential web hosts to see 
whether their services can handle WordPress. How cool is that?
	
The WordPress community has already taken the question of web hosting into 
its multitude of hands and come up with a list of recommended hosting com­
panies. The community and WordPress developers voted these companies 
their top picks for providing everything that you need for WordPress:
	
✓	BlueHost (www.bluehost.com)
	
✓	DreamHost (www.dreamhost.com)
	
✓	Media Temple (www.mediatemple.com)
	
✓	Blogs About (www.blogs-about.com)
	
✓	Laughing Squid (www.laughingsquid.com)
Each of these companies offers well-known quality web hosting, but if you 
want to continue looking, compare notes with other bloggers and refer back 
to Chapter 3 for good advice about choosing a web host.

Getting the software
After you sort out your web host and site domain, you next need to down­
load and extract the WordPress files from WordPress.org and put them on 
your computer. Choose a place you’ll remember, such as a Documents or 
Download directory. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Point your web browser to www.wordpress.org.
	
	 The main WordPress page appears.
	
2.	Click the red Download tab in the top-right corner.
	
	 The site takes you to a short instructional page that has download infor­
mation on it.
	
3.	Click the Download WordPress button.
	
	 Your web browser may ask you to select a location to place the files that 
are downloading. If it does, choose a place on your computer that you 
will remember. Your Desktop or Documents folder are decent choices.
	
4.	After the compressed file downloads, double-click it to expand (or 
unzip) the files it contains on your computer.
	
	 The files are saved on your computer, as shown in Figure 5-2.

 Chapter 5: Starting a WordPress Blog
	
WordPress.org provides the downloadable file in two compressed formats: 
GZip (.tar.gz) and ZIP (.zip) format. These days, most computer systems 
recognize the ZIP format, and you should be able to open it without installing 
any additional software. After you expand the .zip file, you can delete it from 
your computer.
Uploading the WordPress files
Do you have your files unzipped? Great! Now, the installation process gets 
a little more technical. You need to upload these unzipped files to your web 
hosting space by using an FTP (file transfer protocol) client. If you don’t have 
an FTP client installed on your computer, you have plenty of free options that 
you can download and install.
The following are my two favorite FTP clients:
	
✓	FileZilla (www.filezilla-project.org): Available for all computer 
platforms (see Figure 5-3)
	
✓	Cyberduck (www.cyberduck.ch): Available only for Macintosh 
computers
Both of these programs have the capability to connect and transfer files to 
your new web host. To place the WordPress files on your web host, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Download and install the FTP client of your choice.
	
	 Look for installation instructions on the FTP software website.
	
2.	Start your FTP client.
What is FTP?
FTP is a technology used to copy files from one 
computer to another by using the file transfer 
protocol. Simply put, FTP allows computers that 
are running different operating systems (such 
as Windows or Mac) to move files across the 
Internet without experiencing format difficul­
ties. It’s an old technology that people still use 
every day to move website files.

3.	Connect to your web server by using the details that your web host 
provided you for FTP access.
	
	 These details usually include a URL, username, and password.
	
	 The directory in which you store the WordPress files is normally the 
main directory that you see when you connect via FTP. Check with your 
web host if you’re confused.
	
4.	Using the FTP software, upload the WordPress files from your com­
puter to the server.
	
	 In some FTP clients, you can drag and drop the WordPress files to the 
location on the web host. Others use arrow interfaces.
	
5.	When the files finish uploading, close your FTP client.
	
At some point in the future, you may need to upload additional files (although 
WordPress is fairly good at doing most of its updates directly through the 
interface). That said, make sure to retain the information that you used to con­
nect to your web host.

 Chapter 5: Starting a WordPress Blog
Setting up the database
You’re doing great! But don’t rest on your laurels; this next step is probably 
the most technical. Take a deep breath and prepare to set up a database for 
your WordPress blog.
Arguably, setting up a database isn’t actually terribly difficult. However, each 
web host handles databases in different ways, so I can’t give you straightfor­
ward instructions for accomplishing this task.
	
Your web host is in the business of handling technical issues, and of course, it 
sets up the environment in the first place. Don’t hesitate to request assistance 
with your database setup.
	
The database system that you need to use is called MySQL. (Without MySQL, 
you can’t use WordPress.) MySQL is a relational database management 
system. It can store all kinds of data for WordPress — from your blog posts 
to blogroll links, as well as all your WordPress settings. So, MySQL stores the 
blog posts that you write inside a database that’s fast, efficient, and flexible.
If you want to know more about MySQL, pick up a copy of PHP & MySQL For 
Dummies, 4th Edition, by Janet Valade (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.). But take my 
word that after you set up your database, you won’t need to know anymore 
about it for the purposes of using WordPress.
After you know how to access your database setup tool, follow these steps:
	
1.	Log into your web host.
	
2.	Create the database.
	
	You need to name your database something that makes sense. If you 
have a blog called Joe Smith’s Wondrous Adventures, you can name the 
database joesmith. The length of database names and database user­
names are normally limited, and you can’t include special characters in 
the names.
	
3.	Create a database user.
	
	You can make the username anything, except the name that you used 
for your database. The same length and special character restrictions 
apply, though.

4.	Assign a password to that user.
	
	 Don’t forget to write this information down so that you can use it when 
you run the WordPress install script.
Because web hosting companies can choose for themselves which MySQL 
database system to include in their hosting packages, I don’t know which of 
the following applies to your situation. But web hosts commonly use one of 
the following management systems:
	
✓	phpMyAdmin: A database management tool (shown in Figure 5-4) that a 
lot of web hosts provide to their clients. You can create and delete data­
bases, manage database users, and (depending on what permissions the 
web host gives you) manipulate the data itself.

min is a tool 
that you 
can use to 
manage and 
create 
databases.

 Chapter 5: Starting a WordPress Blog
	
✓	cPanel: A common web host interface that generally enables users to 
create and delete databases. You normally do any additional manipula­
tion by using phpMyAdmin.
	
✓	Plesk: Yet another web host interface that allows users to create and 
delete databases and manage database users. You do any data manipu­
lation by using phpMyAdmin.
The web host that you choose probably uses one of the interfaces in the 
preceding list. You can figure them out and use them fairly easily. If you’re 
running only one blog, you need only a single database. If you’re thinking 
of running more than one, you need to find out how to keep your databases 
healthy and separate by using tools that your web host provides.
	
Some web hosts have automated WordPress installation and allow you to 
bypass all the installation instructions in this chapter — the web host takes 
care of it all. Ask your web host whether it offers packages that include 
WordPress installation as part of the setup.
Running the install script
After you put the WordPress files in the directory your web host recom­
mends and write down the database information, you only have to run the 
WordPress installer. The installer is super simple. Things can go wrong, of 
course, but if the installer gets stuck, it does a very good job of letting you 
know exactly what you need to do.
Follow these steps to install WordPress:
	
1.	To run the installer, point your Internet browser to
www.yourwebdomain.com/wp-admin/install.php
	
	 Remember to replace www.yourwebdomain.com with your domain 
name!
	
	 The installer checks to see whether you’ve created or edited the con­
figuration file. If it doesn’t find one, it will create it for you.
	
2.	Click Create a Configuration File.
	
	 This creates your WordPress configuration file. Now all you need to do 
is enter the information the configuration file needs.

3.	Make sure you have the database name, username, password, and 
hostname. If you do, click Let’s Go!
	
4.	Enter the database information (see Figure 5-5).
	
	 You can usually leave the database host as localhost because most 
web hosting environments use that host without complaint. You don’t 
have to change the table prefix, either.
	
5.	Click Submit.
	
6.	Click Run the Install.
	
7.	Enter a blog title and your e-mail address in the text boxes provided.
	
8.	Click Install WordPress.

	 If everything goes well, the installer displays the word Success on the 
screen. The username and password of the administration user also 
appear on the screen. Keep a record of this information in a safe loca­
tion because if your blog experiences any problems or you need to con­
duct any WordPress configuration or management, you will need to log 
in using the admin account.
	
9.	Click Log In.
	
	 The log-in page appears, where you can log into your new installation.
	
	 That’s it! You’ve done it! You can now log into your new WordPress 
installation and get busy publishing.
	
The configuration file is named wp-config.php. If your installer can’t 
create the configuration file automatically, follow the instructions that 
WordPress provides at (http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_
WordPress#Setup_configuration_file) to create the file by hand.
Getting Familiar with Settings
After you have your new blog software installed and running, you can log into 
your WordPress admin account and take a look around. The WordPress soft­
ware does a lot right out of the box to make your blogging life as simple as pos­
sible. You have the ability to create blog posts; create static pages; add images 
and multimedia files; connect to social networking sites, such as Flickr and 
Facebook; and chat with blog visitors by using the commenting system.
Either these functions come with the WordPress install, or you can add them 
by using a plug-in that you download and install. Each of these plug-ins typi­
cally has an administration page.
In the following sections, I introduce you to the administration section of the 
blog itself.
Logging in
Before you can start posting, you need to head on over to the Log In page 
and enter the username and password that were provided to you during the 
installation process.

Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
In order to log into your new website, you may want to bookmark the follow­
ing link:
www.yourdomain.com/wp-admin/wp-login.php
Remember to replace www.yourwebdomain.com with your domain name!
Setting up an Editor account
WordPress allows you to set up and maintain several levels of user accounts 
in addition to the administrative account created during the setup process. 
These account types are called roles. They are:
	
✓	Administrator: Administrators have access to all features and areas of 
the blog software, from technical configuration to user accounts to con­
tent tools. This is the most powerful level of access on your blog; handle 
with care!
	
✓	Editor: This is a user who can publish posts, manage posts, and manage 
other account posts.
	
✓	Author: This is a user who can publish and manage his or her own 
posts.
	
✓	Contributor: This is a user role that allows someone to write and 
manage posts but not publish them live to the blog.
	
✓	Subscriber: This is a user who can read comments, post comments, and 
receive other private information.
	
If you are the only person blogging on your website, you should still go ahead 
and set up an Editor user account for creating blog posts. I recommend that 
you don’t use the administrative account created during installation as the 
account you use when you author blog posts. It’s a bit like driving a car by 
opening the hood and manipulating the engine directly; use the perfectly good 
steering wheel that comes with WordPress by setting up an Editor account. 
Reserve the administrative account for administrative tasks like installing new 
themes, plug-ins, and any other general maintenance.

 Chapter 5: Starting a WordPress Blog
Set up your Editor account by following these steps:
	
1.	Log into your WordPress installation.
	
2.	From the Dashboard, click Users.
	
	 You see the full list of users and their roles.
	
3.	Click Add New.
	
	 WordPress loads the Add New User screen.
	
4.	Fill out the user fields.
	
	 You will see a listing of text boxes: username, first name, last name, 
e-mail, website, and password. Only three are required: username, pass­
word, and e-mail address. I also recommend filling in the first and last 
names.
	
5.	Select the Editor role.
	
6.	Click Add User.
	
	 The user is created.
	
When you set up a new user, you can choose to send the account information 
to the new user’s e-mail address. In this case, the account is for yourself, so 
you don’t need to select this check box. If you wish to have additional writers 
on your blog, consider setting them up as Authors — instead of Editors — and 
notifying them as you set up their accounts.
	
After you create your new Editor account, don’t forget to log out of the admin­
istrative account, and then log in again as an Editor!
Using the Dashboard
Each time you log into your WordPress blog, you end up on the Dashboard 
page. Get to know this page well because you spend most of your blogging 
time here. You can configure the front Dashboard to your liking by moving 
panels around and turning panels on or off. You can see the Dashboard in 
Figure 5-6.

to spend a 
lot of time 
with the 
WordPress 
Dashboard.
	
On the left side of the Dashboard, a series of menus point you to the various 
sections of the administration panel. You likely visit some of these menus on 
a daily basis and some only once in a while:
	
✓	Posts: Includes links that allow you to edit posts, add new posts, and 
manage categories and tags.
	
✓	Media: Provides you with a link to upload new media files to your media 
library or manage previously uploaded media.
	
✓	Links: Manage lists of links on your website. For example, group links 
together into categories and post them in sidebars as blogrolls or other 
link lists.
	
✓	Pages: Clicking Pages takes you to the Page Administration section. 
Pages in WordPress are considered static pieces of content (pages that 
change only once in a while) and aren’t blog posts. Use them for pretty 
much any section of your website, like a bio page or contact page. You 
can then link to these pages from a sidebar menu or via another blog 
post. Some themes may also provide you with menus that you can use 
to link to different sections of your blog.

Checking out the panels
On the right side of the Dashboard, you see a series of panels. Each panel 
gives you access to parts of the administrative interface for WordPress. The 
default panels are
	
✓	Right Now: Contains a quick overview of what’s happening on your blog. 
The panel displays
 
• The number of posts on the blog
 
• The number of comments
 
• The spam count
 
• The number of categories and tags currently in use on the site
	
✓	Recent Comments: Lists the most recent comment activity on your blog

✓	Incoming Links: Uses Google searches to show the sites that are send­
ing visitors to your blog.
	
✓	Plugins: Gives you a quick list of the newest, the most popular, and the 
most recently updated plug-ins. A plug-in is a small piece of program­
ming that you can attach to existing software to extend that software’s 
functionality.
	
✓	QuickPress: Allows you to post a quick note on your blog right from the 
administration panel.
	
✓	Recent Drafts: Contains a listing of posts that you saved as drafts but

Creating a Post
I’m sure you’re bursting at the seams to get your first blog post online. The 
process is quite simple in terms of using WordPress. The real challenge is 
coming up with good stuff to blog about! Jump to Chapter 8 for a lot of tips 
and ideas on writing for your blog.

 Chapter 5: Starting a WordPress Blog
To start a new blog post, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the Posts menu in the Dashboard and select Add New.
	
	 WordPress opens the Add New Post page, shown in Figure 5-7.
	
2.	Give your post a title by entering it in the text box below Add New 
Post.
	
3.	Add some text in the body text box.
	
	 Use the formatting buttons if you want to change the style of your text, 
create a list, or otherwise add elements.
	
4.	Use any of the other options that you want for this post.
	
	 WordPress gives you the following options:
 
• Excerpt: If you want, you can write a short summary of your post 
for the Excerpt field.

• Post Tags: Tags are keywords that describe the topic of your post. 
Tagging your posts lets search engines easily identify the subject 
material you discuss and means your post is likely to rank higher 
in search engine listings.
 
• Categories: Use the Add New Category link in the Categories box 
if you need to create a new category for your post. Categories are 
general groups that you can sort your blog posts into so that read­
ers can easily locate the content most interesting to them.
 
• Discussion: You can choose whether you want to allow readers to 
post comments on this posting and whether you want to permit 
trackbacks. I explain trackbacks in Chapter 3.
 
• Custom Fields: You can add custom fields to your posts, which you 
fully control. Custom fields are simply fields that appear in each 
blog post that you can display by altering the template for your 
blog. For example, if your blog is a restaurant-review blog, you 
might choose to add custom fields for the location or rating of 
each restaurant that you review.
	
5.	Click Publish to save your blog post and check out your blog to see 
how it looks!
	
	 If you’re not ready to post your blog entry to the public, you can save 
your posting as a draft or preview it before you post it. Also, you can set 
a particular date if you want to schedule your post for publication in the 
future.
	
	 Look for a Visit Site link at the top of the Dashboard; the link takes you 
right to your blog.
Customizing Your Design
After you play around with a few of the WordPress features, I know you’re 
thinking, “How do I make this new blog pretty?” The answer is as simple as a 
menu click. Just follow these steps:
	
1.	From the menus on the left side of the Dashboard, click Appearance.
	
	 The Manage Themes page opens, displaying a list of themes that you 
can install.
	
2.	Search for themes based on color or keyword.
	
	 WordPress returns a list of themes based on your search query.
	
3.	Click Preview to see how a particular theme looks in a pop-up 
window. Close the pop-up to look at the list again.

4.	After you find a theme that you like, click Install to load the theme 
onto your server.
	
5.	Click Active to apply the theme to your blog.
You can install several themes all at the same time, and then take time to test 
which theme best suits your blog.
Now, do you want to get into the code even more? If so, get ready to dive 
into HTML. Only the brave venture into this territory because it does require 
knowledge of HTML, CSS, PHP, and WordPress’s own markup language. The 
code editing for WordPress includes a little more than just plain old HTML.
Some bloggers love playing with HTML code, and some run away as fast as 
they can. If you have the chops, however, the developers of WordPress have 
made accessing and modifying the theme files a fairly easy task.
Select Editor from the Appearance menu to get at the editing interface for the 
currently installed theme. The editor is simply a text editor in which you can 
manipulate the files in your theme without using any other technology (such 
as FTP) to access the files. It’s simple to use and doesn’t have too many frills.
The drawback to using the editor is that you really need to know your stuff 
when it comes to HTML code, CSS, and a little PHP thrown in for good mea­
sure. If you don’t know what these technologies do, I don’t recommend 
touching your theme without a little practice beforehand. Make backups!
Finding Out More about WordPress
You could spend a lot of time figuring out WordPress, and I just can’t fit it all 
into a single chapter. (I tried!) But you’re far from alone in your search for a 
better understanding of your new WordPress blog. A great many websites 
and blogs can help you further your WordPress education. Here are a few 
handy resources:
	
✓	WordPress For Dummies, 4th Edition, by Lisa Sabin-Wilson (John 
Wiley & Sons, Inc.): You knew that For Dummies had a book on this 
topic, right? Of course you did! Why not pick up a copy? You can dig 
deeper into the ins and outs of WordPress code, themes, and widgets. 
This book can be your one-stop resource. Tell Lisa Sabin-Wilson that 
Blogging For Dummies sent you!

✓	WordCamp: Over the last couple of years, camps have been popping up 
everywhere. Camps (also known as unconferences) are informal gather­
ings of people who love to get together and talk about their interests. If 
you love WordPress, then you need to go to a WordCamp in your area 
soon because you can find out a lot of things not covered anywhere else. 
What could be better than a bunch of people getting together to talk 
about everything WordPress? Maybe a bunch of people getting together 
to talk about everything WordPress who also have cupcakes? Visit the

o you think blogging might just be too much work? Before you dismiss 
my question as sarcastic, consider this: A 2010 study by Technorati 
indicated that 40 percent of the surveyed bloggers spend more than 3 hours 
a week on their blogs, and 13 percent spend more than 10. That’s not an 
insignificant amount of time, and not everyone has that kind of time to devote 
to blogging. (Interestingly, only half of the bloggers Technorati surveyed for 
this study indicated that they make money from their blogging. Check out the 
full study online at http://technorati.com/blogging/article/who-
bloggers-brands-and-consumers-day.)
So, if you’re interested in blogging but worried about time, a micro blog 
might be an alternative you should consider. Micro blogging is pretty much 
what it sounds like — creating very short blog posts. But the micro blog may 
have all the other usual trappings of a blog, such as comments, RSS feeds, 
and so on.
In this chapter, I introduce you to micro blogging options and walk you 
through starting a micro blog using Tumblr.

Part II: Setting Up Your Blog 
Introducing Micro Blogging
Micro blogging is characterized by very short blog posts, done quickly and 
frequently, and often from some nontraditional publishing tools, such as 
mobile phones, e-mail, instant messages, and text messages. However, you 
can still use a web interface to produce a micro blog!
Some micro bloggers use their blogs as mechanisms to collect and archive 
interesting tidbits of information that they come across while they surf the 
web. Many micro blogs contain very little personal content in the form of 
writing, but a lot of photos, video snippets, and links. In fact, many micro 
bloggers don’t explain why they choose to include something in their blogs at 
all, and in this way, micro blogs can be much more idiosyncratic to the indi­
vidual blogger than a regular blog.
We Are the Weirdos (http://wearetheweirdos.tumblr.com) is a micro 
blog produced with Tumblr (you can read more about Tumblr in the follow­
ing sections). Created by Spencer, the blog (see Figure 6-1) is a motley collec­
tion of funny photos, screenshots, videos, audio files, and quotes.
Other micro blogging tools act a little differently. Facebook, LinkedIn, 
Google+, and MySpace — or any social network that allows you to post status 
updates — are technically micro blogging tools, as well. Status updates are 
very short text posts that are generally used to let others know what you’re 
thinking or doing.
Twitter (www.twitter.com) is a micro blogging tool that broadcasts 
status updates. Blogger Darren Barefoot writes a blog called One Year, 
One Canadian (www.oneyearonecanadian.ca) and uses the micro blog­
ging tool Twitter in combination with his regular blog posts to provide 
quick updates to his readers about his efforts to live a life consuming only 
Canadian food and media for an entire year. His Twitter micro blog (www.
twitter.com/1y1c) is shown in Figure 6-2.
I spend more time covering the Twitter phenomenon in Chapter 15.

Starting a Micro Blog with Tumblr
In this section, I walk you through starting a micro blog by using Tumblr, one 
of the most popular micro blogging services out there.
Tumblr (www.tumblr.com) is hosted blog software, which means that you 
don’t need to have web hosting, a domain name, or anything more than the 
capability to access the website in order to get started.
	
I cover the differences between hosted and installable blog software in 
Chapter 3.
Signing up and getting started are simple processes. Just follow these steps:
	
1.	Point your web browser to www.tumblr.com.
	
	 The main Tumblr page opens.
	
2.	Type your e-mail address into the Email Address text box.

3.	Type a password of your choice into the Password text box.
	
4.	Type a URL (usually the name of the blog you’re creating) into the URL 
text box.
	
5.	Click the Start Posting button, as shown in Figure 6-3.
	
	Tumblr loads a visual test called a CAPTCHA to make sure you are a 
human and not a spam script.
	
6.	Retype the CAPTCHA words shown and click I’m Human.

Creating a Text Post
Tumblr allows you to create blog posts by using text, photos, quotes, links, 
chat excerpts, audio files, and video. I show you how to post entries that 
include these different elements in the following sections. For more on 
including audio and video in your blog posts, jump to Chapters 11 and 12.

3.	Type the text of your blog post in the Post field.
	
	 Use as much or as little text as you want.
If you’re ready, you can post to your blog right now by clicking Create Post, 
or you can spend a little time making your post fancy. In the following sec­
tion, you can find out about the options.
Formatting your blog post
Tumblr, like most blog software, gives you the ability to format your blog 
post while you create it. The icons just above the Post field, shown in Figure 
6-4, enable you to format what you’ve written.

 Chapter 6: Starting a Tumblr Blog
Tumblr uses a WYSIWG (what you see is what you get) interface, which 
shows you the effect of a tool in your blog post right when you apply it. This 
list describes each of the available tools:
	
✓	Bold: Make any text in your blog post bold by clicking and dragging over 
the text that you want to affect, and then clicking the Bold icon. The 
selected text is made bold.
	
✓	Italic: Italicize any text in your blog post by clicking and dragging over 
the text that you want to affect, and then clicking the Italic icon. The 
selected text is then shown in italics.
	
✓	Strikethrough: This style is commonly applied to text that you need 
to correct. Click and drag over the text that you want to affect, and 
then click the Strikethrough icon. The selected text is then made 
strikethrough.
	
✓	Unordered List: In web browsers, unordered lists are usually displayed 
as bulleted lists (like this list you’re reading right now). You can most 
easily use this tool by typing each list item into your blog post on a 
separate line. Click and drag to select all the items, and then click the 
Unordered List icon.
	
✓	Ordered List: In web browsers, ordered lists usually appear as num­
bered lists. You can most easily use this tool by typing each list item 
into your blog post on a separate line. Click and drag to select all the 
items, and then click the Ordered List icon.
	
✓	Blockquote: Indent a paragraph clicking anywhere in the line or para­
graph of text that you want to affect, and then selecting the Blockquote 
icon. Your text moves to the right.
	
✓	Insert/Edit Photo: Add photos to your blog posts by linking to them on 
other websites. I give you step-by-step instructions for adding photos to 
your posts in the following section.
	
✓	Insert/Edit Link: Make any text or image in your blog a clickable link to 
any website. I give you step-by-step instructions for adding a link in the 
section “Adding links to your post,” later in this chapter.
	
✓	Unlink: You can remove a link that you added by clicking the linked text 
or photo, and then clicking the Unlink icon.
	
✓	Toggle Spellchecks: Not a great speller? (You aren’t alone.) Click the 
Spellcheck icon to run a spellchecker on your text. If you click the small 
arrow to the right of the icon, you can choose another language for the 
spellcheck default.

✓	Insert “read more” break: Break up your post so that only part of it 
appears on your blog’s home page, and the rest is visible when the 
visitor clicks through to the permalink — the page that shows only the 
post — page.
	
✓	Edit HTML Source: Are you an HTML guru? If you want to edit the 
source code of your blog post directly, click the Edit HTML Source icon 
and go to town.
	
Appendix B, at the end of this book, gives you some basic HTML editing code, 
if you’re starting to explore this area.
Use the tools described in the preceding list to format your text, and when 
you’re ready, move to the following section to add an image to your text blog 
post.
Adding an image to your post
Blog posts are more fun with photos! If you want to add an image to a text blog 
post on your Tumblr blog, you first need a photo on the web. A lot of bloggers 
set up accounts with the photo-sharing site Flickr (www.flickr.com), post 
their photos there, and then include the ones they want to share via their blog 
by using Tumblr. On Flickr, you can also republish many photos by others, 
but be sure to check the licensing restrictions so that you don’t inadvertently 
violate someone’s copyright.
To find out more about copyright and photos, jump to Chapter 11. For now, 
feel free to experiment with a photo that I took, which you can view at www.
flickr.com/photos/supersusie/3815946553.
Follow these steps to place an image from Flickr into your Tumblr text blog 
post:
	
1.	Use a web browser to go to a photo on Flickr, such as www.flickr.
com/photos/supersusie/3815946553.
	
2.	Click the Share button directly above the image.
	
	 Flickr opens a Share options window.
	
3.	Click the Grab the HTML/BBCode link.
	
	 This opens a view that provides code for your use.
	
4.	Select whichever size you want to use from the size drop-down list.
	
	 In my example, I selected Small.

5.	Click in the area labeled Copy and Paste the Code Below and press 
Ctrl+C (Ô+C on the Mac), or select Copy from the browser Edit menu 
to copy the image code, as shown in Figure 6-5.
	
6.	In your Tumblr text blog post, click where you want to put your photo.
	
7.	Click the HTML icon.
	
	 Tumblr opens the HTML Source Editor window, shown in Figure 6-6. 
This window shows any content you have already placed in your post, 
with the HTML code that formats it.
	
8.	Click in the window where you want your image to appear and press 
Ctrl+V (Ô+V on the Mac) to paste the code into the field.
	
9.	Click the Update button.
	
	 Tumblr closes the window and shows the image in your post.
	
10.	To wrap the text around the image, click on the image to select it and 
then click the Image icon (it looks like a tree).
	
	 The Insert/Edit Image window opens.
	
11.	Select an option from the Alignment drop-down list.
	
	 I chose Left because I want to put the image on the left side of the text.

image.
	
13.	Click the Insert button to close the window and place the image in 
your blog post.
	
	 Tumblr displays the image in your blog post.
Adding links to your post
Links add a lot of value to a blog post by giving your readers the resources 
to explore a topic further or find more information about your discussion or 
idea. As long as you link to useful information, don’t hesitate to add links to 
your posts.
You can add links to both text and images. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Select text or click on an image in your blog post.
	
2.	Click the Insert/Edit Link tool (it’s a small piece of chain).
	
	 Tumblr opens the Insert/Edit Link window.

3.	Type or paste a URL into the Link URL text box.
	
	 In this example, I’m linking to the image featured in the preceding sec­
tion, so I create a link back to Flickr by typing the following into the Link 
URL field: www.flickr.com/photos/supersusie/3815946553.
 
• (Optional) You can give a descriptive title to your link in the Title 
text box if desired.
 
• (Optional) If you want to open the link in a new web browser 
window, select Open Link in a New Window from the Target drop-
down list. If you don’t select an option, the default behavior opens 
the link in the same window.
	
4.	Click the Insert button to add the link to the text or photo in your blog 
post (see Figure 6-7).
	
	 The link isn’t clickable in the editing screen because you’d have trouble 
formatting or removing the link later if it was.
If you want to remove a link that you’ve created, you can easily do it. Simply 
click the text or photo on which you placed a link, and then click the Unlink 
tool.

Customizing How Your Blog Looks
This section introduces you to the customization options for your Tumblr 
blog. You can change the look and feel of the blog, as well as some of the 
functionality. Adding your own touches really personalizes a blog and makes 
it feel more like home.

 Chapter 6: Starting a Tumblr Blog
Get to the customization options by clicking the Customize appearance link 
in the right column of your Tumblr Dashboard. A page that displays a pre­
view of your blog opens, and the menu across the top enables you to adjust 
the following:
	
✓	Info: Update the following areas by using this option:
 
• Title: Give your Tumblr blog a name.
 
• Description: Some of the themes (discussed later in this list) dis­
play a short description text area. You can describe yourself, your 
blog, or whatever you think people might want to know about you 
and what you’re doing.
	
✓	Theme: Change the appearance of your blog by choosing one of the 
design themes that Tumblr automatically provides. Tumblr offers nearly 
200 options. If you’re good with HTML, you can also use this tab to 
create your own custom theme.
	
✓	Appearance: Even if you select a theme that you like, the Appearance 
tab allows you to further customize the colors. Clicking any color option 
displays a color picker, and from there, you can go crazy (or not). You 
can see this in Figure 6-9.

✓	Pages: Want to include some content on your blog but don’t think it 
should be a blog post? In this area, you can create a standalone page. 
This might be used to create a bio page, or one where you let people 
contact you.
	
✓	Advanced: Anything you can customize that didn’t fit in the other cat­
egories seems to be available in the Advanced tab:
 
• Add Custom CSS: Some themes available on the Theme tab include 
custom Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) styles. If you’re not familiar 
with CSS, don’t worry about it. Custom CSS is part of creating 
advanced layouts.
 
•	Post Count: Change the number of blog posts that appear on your 
blog’s home page.
 
• Options: Extend the functionality of your blog by adding some neat 
features, including enabling high-resolution photos, opening links 
in new windows, optimizing your layout for mobile delivery, and 
adding descriptive words to your URLs.
After you make updates in any of the customization tabs, be sure to click the 
Save Changes button at the top-right of the page. And then take a look at your 
blog so that you can be sure the changes were implemented correctly.
	
You can view your Tumblr blog at any time by pointing your web browser to 
the URL that you chose when you signed up or by clicking the Open link in the 
menu on the right side of the Dashboard, which you can see in Figure 6-10.

want to consider customizing, as well. You can access these settings by click­
ing the Settings link in your Tumblr Dashboard (you can see the Settings 
button in Figure 6-10).

The settings you can tweak are: 
	
✓	Portrait Photo: Make your blog more your own by uploading a photo of 
yourself. Some themes display these images; some don’t.
	
✓	URL: If you want to change the URL of your blog at any point, you can 
take care of that here. Remember, you probably don’t want to change 
the URL of a blog that already has visitors because then they can’t find 
you easily anymore.
	
✓	Replies: Let your visitors reply to your posts if they “follow” your blog 
using the Tumblr Follow feature.
	
✓	Ask: Your visitors can submit questions to you on your blog if you opt 
to allow them.
	
✓	Submissions: If you’d like to let others submit blog posts, you can set up 
a page to allow this, complete with guidelines.
	
✓	Facebook: Promote your Tumblr posts using your Facebook Wall.
	
✓	Twitter: Promote your Tumblr posts by publishing them in your Twitter 
feed.
	
✓	Posts by Email: Obtain an e-mail address that lets you submit your 
posts by e-mail.
	
✓	RSS Feeds: Choose to include some or all of your posts in your RSS feed, 
or redirect your feed URL. (For more about RSS, see Chapter 14.)
	
✓	Language: Choose the language for your blog.
	
✓	Timezone: Set your time zone to match your geographic location.
	
✓	Directory: You can allow search engines to show your blog in search 
results — a really good idea if you’re trying to build an audience!
	
✓	Not Safe for Work (NSFW): If you’re blogging about sex-related or other 
workplace-sensitive topics, marking your blog NSFW alerts the directory 
and warns others.
Exploring Tumblr Goodies
Tumblr offers fun extras for your blog on the Goodies page (see Figure 6-11),

using your phone, instant messages, e-mail, or third-party applications.
	
My favorite addition available in the Goodies area is Call in Audio. It’s a really 
nice (and free) tool that you can use to call in and record audio posts by using 
a phone. You can create quick recordings on the go, and best of all, you don’t 
need to buy any extra equipment or software!

Finding Your Niche
In This Chapter
▶	Discovering blog genres
▶	Finding out what makes appealing blog posts
▶	Making connections with other bloggers
I

f you’re blogging only for your friends and family, you probably have a 
captive audience that stays interested, no matter what you choose to blog 
about on any given day. (Although, even your mom might get a little tired of 
hearing about what time you got up and what you had for lunch!)
Most bloggers, however, define blogging success as attracting, keeping, and 
growing an audience of interested readers who can’t wait for the next pearl of 
wisdom to leave their fingertips . . . preferably an audience that leaves com­
ments and interacts with the blogger and with other readers.
Creating this kind of blog is no small challenge: You’re in competition with 
every other source of news, information, and entertainment in your audience 
members’ lives (not to mention your own, if you have trouble finding time for 
blogging).
So, find a niche and exploit it fully. I have no way of knowing exactly what 
your niche is — that’s something for you to figure out — but I can give you 
ideas and suggestions to help you start turning your mental gears. This chap­
ter can help you find others blogging in your subject area, what they’re doing 
right, and how you can make the most of your subject.
Deciding What Belongs on Your Blog
You may find picking a niche and sticking with it tough to do. Fortunately, 
blogging gives you a lot of leeway in how you handle a subject, in evolving 
your own style, and in what you blog about. The medium allows for a lot of 
experimentation, and your readers likely welcome new approaches and ideas 
while you go.

Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
For your own peace of mind, however, you probably want to pick a broad 
theme and then explore within that theme. Do you like books? Why not blog 
about what you’re reading and make recommendations? You can then take a 
natural leap to movies based on books, and to authors . . . even a simple idea 
can give you a lot of room to grow.
Some subject areas have worked as popular and successful blog topics 
already. You can take on the competition and start a blog about
	
✓	Your kids: Baby books might have gone out of style, but that doesn’t 
mean you can’t document your child’s growth in detail on a blog. 
Mommyblogging, as it’s called, is on the rise in a big way. Talk about a 
topic that has an infinite variety of discussions, products, problems, and 
cute photos!
	
✓	Your hobby or interest: Blogs are beautifully suited to help you make 
connections, so feel free to use yours to become part of a community of 
folks who share your passion for knitting, sport fishing, geocaching, car­
pentry, or whatever your interest is.
	
✓	Technology: Many of the original bloggers chose technology as their 
focus — a great decision. People have a huge interest in technology 
and technology issues today. After all, more and more people have cell 
phones, personal computers, and MP3 players, and everyone has prob­
lems using them!
	
✓	Politics: Do I really need to point out that political commentary and criti­
cism can make a good blog? A number of popular political bloggers have 
turned their online punditry into thriving careers in traditional media.
	
✓	News of the weird: Some very popular blogs make the most of the many 
strange websites by posting links and quick summaries of the sites on 
their blogs. These blogs cater to the lazy man’s approach to surfing, and 
if you’re interested in sharing the quirky oddities that you find, you can 
definitely get an audience for them.
	
✓	Specialized news: Offer a service for your busy readers by aggregating all 
the news on a particular topic, including quick tidbits and links to sources. 
You can create this kind of blog for both serious and comic topics — 
cranial surgery techniques to coverage of the latest teen sensation.
	
✓	A personal diary: If your life is full of crazy adventures, colorful figures, 
drama, passion, and ludicrous jokes, you can stick with the tried and 
true blog subject: You. With a unique voice and great writing, you can 
attract readers who can become friends.
The following sections look at each of these topics in a little more detail.

 Chapter 7: Finding Your Niche
Mommyblogging
Generally speaking, mommyblogging is memoir-style blogging, detailing the 
trials, tribulations, and general hysteria of raising children.
	
Quite a few mommyblogs start before much mommying is going on — before 
or during pregnancy — and then proceed through infancy and upward. 
Don’t let the fact that you’re not quite a mommy yet deter you from starting a 
mommyblog.
They’re often hilarious, often heartbreaking, and so easy to identify with. If 
you don’t have children, you certainly were one once. Frankly, kids are funny.
You can find many great examples of mommyblogs out there; I had trouble 
picking just one to tell you about, but you can start exploring at the blog 
Woulda Coulda Shoulda (www.wouldashoulda.com). Mir, a mother of two, 
writes Woulda Coulda Shoulda, shown in Figure 7-1. Her blog has earned 
her coverage in Parents Magazine, Redbook, and The Today Show; inclusion 
in an anthology; and gigs speaking about mommyblogging at the BlogHer 
Conference (www.blogher.com).

Turning your offline hobby into a blog
You probably already have offline hobbies that consume time and energy, 
and about which you have great passion. You also probably have plenty to 
say on the topic, but too few people are genuinely interested in hearing you 
expound about your hobby.
Find your compatriots online by starting a blog about your hobby and hook­
ing into a community of people who share both your passion for the activity 
and also your passion for news and discussion about your hobby.
You can find many terrific hobby blogs out there: great blogs about every­
thing from scrapbooking to jewelry-making to collecting airline safety cards.
One of my hobbies is knitting, and let me tell you, the knitters have caught 
onto blogging in a huge way! Bloggers who knit share stories about frustrat­
ing patterns, exciting yarns, sales, and more. I read knitting blogs because I 
can identify with what the blogger is describing, but also because I often find 
out something new.
One fun knitting blog is Yarn Harlot (www.yarnharlot.ca), written by a knit­
ter living in Toronto named Stephanie Pearl-McPhee. Yarn Harlot (shown in 
Figure 7-2) is the online diary of a devoted knitter and author; Stephanie has 
also written six books of knitting humor. Her hilarious blog covers everything 
from knitting techniques to home renovations, and it never fails to entertain.

 Chapter 7: Finding Your Niche
Talking technology
Can anyone ever know enough about technology to make everything he or 
she owns function? At least for me, the answer is no. Just when I start to feel 
reasonably competent with computers, a hard drive fails. And how often 
have I brought home a new cell phone, ripped open the box with great excite­
ment, and then failed utterly to figure out how to get my contacts imported? 
It’s true — even I need technology help.
And I’m betting you do, too. Technology bloggers have figured this out, writ­
ing blogs that explain how to resolve common problems as well as blogs that 
whet your appetite for new gadgets. Don’t you always think that a new and 
better device can solve your problems with the one you have now?
You can find a number of highly successful technology blogs around the 
web, including some that have been in existence for years and years. Some of 
these blogs are specialized to a particular kind of tool or software; some are 
just about conveying the latest and greatest across the field.
If you work in technology or just have a passion for it, you can start a blog 
around your enthusiasm. That’s what Dennis Lloyd did when he founded 
iLounge (www.ilounge.com).
iLounge, shown in Figure 7-3, covers anything and everything about Apple’s 
iPod and iPhone devices. Started in 2001, shortly after Dennis Lloyd first laid 
eyes on an iPod, it has grown from being a blog into a true community site, 
including forums and photo galleries, in addition to the news blogs.
Getting political with it
No matter where you sit on the political spectrum, you live in interesting 
political times. You’ll never be short of topics, from the latest political scan­
dal to the next national election.
Some of the most popular political bloggers have turned their online musings 
into full-fledged careers in the media, from talk shows to newspaper columns. 
And some traditional journalists have bowed out of newspapers and televi­
sion to move to a blog.
This niche has room for many kinds of blogs, from those criticizing national 
policy to those covering local school board and city elections. If you have 
a craving to get involved in politics but don’t want to run for office, a blog 
might be a great way to develop an effective voice. And if you’re a politician, 
you can follow the example of Barack Obama, who used a blog as part of his 
campaign strategy while running for the presidency of the United States. (He 
won, by the way.)

the essen-
tial source 
for all news 
and issues 
for the 
Apple iPod 
and iPhone.
	
For some, the urge to sound off on politics has produced entirely new publi­
cations. Take, for example, Truthdig (www.truthdig.com), which won four 
Webby Awards. (The Webbys are the web’s equivalent of the Oscars.) Shown 
in Figure 7-4, Truthdig was started by journalist Robert Scheer and publisher 
Zuade Kaufman to be a source for political commentary and news that chal­
lenges the “wisdom of the day.”
Pointing out the strange
If it’s bizarre, you can probably find a website about it. Many bloggers make 
a blogging career out of pointing blog readers to the strangest of the strange 
websites. These blogs are often called link blogs, which consist primarily of 
short descriptions and links off into the wild world of the web. Today’s blog­
ger, in an attempt to cultivate the perverse, hilarious, and just weird, often 
adds more commentary, but the effect is the same: The reader gets a daily 
dose of random tidbits to enjoy.
A good example of a blog in this area is The Obscure Store & Reading Room 
(www.obscurestore.typepad.com), which focuses on news stories that 
seem just too bizarre to be true — but actually are true. Postings on the day 
this chapter was written ranged from stories about a boy who reported his 
own mother to 911 from the car for her bad driving and a social networking 
community called Enemybook (see Figure 7-5).

Reporting news
The offline world is full of general news sources — the 200-page newspaper 
that struggles to appeal to all its readers or the broadcast news show that 
does local car chases and the weather well — and not much else. Specialized 
news sources are hard to come by.
Online, the situation is a little different. Quite a few news outlets have opted 
to offer news personalization features, letting you customize the news that 
you consume by topics. But many folks who have specialized interests still 
have to look through a lot of news sources to find truly pertinent stories.
If you’re doing that kind of research for yourself, you can start a blog that 
shares your findings with others interested in the same topic. Are you an 
economist collecting stories about garbage production in North America? Or 
a marketing expert who keeps track of the latest guerilla marketing tactics in 
order to keep on your toes professionally? You can turn this research into a 
valuable blog for others who share your interest.
You can produce this format quite easily, as well, because posts are fre­
quently just pointers to a news story or article on another website. The 
value for readers in a blog of this kind is that someone else (the blogger) has 
already done the work of finding the news, so sending them to another site is 
actually an important part of the service you’re providing.
Quite a few bloggers have opted to develop blogs in a specialized news area 
and parlayed that success into a new revenue stream or sponsorship, so cre­
ating your own news blog might even prove to be a wise business move.
	
Even if you don’t put advertising on your specialized news blog, keeping a 
blog of this kind demonstrates that you’re on top of your field.
One journalist who left traditional media behind in order to serve as a clear­
inghouse of news about the media in Los Angeles is Kevin Roderick. His blog, 
LA Observed (www.laobserved.com), shown in Figure 7-6, is a must-read 
for journalists in Southern California and across the United States. His blog 
is becoming quite a little empire while he expands into city hall and business 
coverage.
Revealing it all
If nothing in this chapter appeals to you so far, perhaps you’re looking for the 
blog classic: a personal diary. Part memoir and part confessional, personal 
diaries on the web cover every topic that life can serve up.

Personal diaries can be real snooze-fests or tearjerkers nonpareil. Much 
depends, of course, on the quality of the writing. But much also depends on 
what happens in the life being documented. Life bloggers, as they’re sometimes 
called, must deal with whatever comes up next for them, from weddings to 
being fired or hired to being diagnosed with cancer.
These blogs are usually easy to relate to and easy to read; they’re also often 
humorous or heart-wrenching, and sometimes both. They take courage to 
write, whether read by millions or only five.
For a heart-wrenching example of a personal diary blog, visit Penmachine 
(www.penmachine.com) for a journal written about a Vancouver-based writ­
er’s life, including his struggles with colorectal cancer (see Figure 7-7). Derek 
Miller’s writing is full of emotional and gritty detail, and also the mundane 
circumstances of a full life lived despite health problems. Derek passed away 
on May 4, 2011; his final post was written in anticipation of his death and is a 
final good-bye to friends and family.

Learning from the Pros
After you choose a topic, you can work on producing a readable blog that 
you can be proud of. In the following sections, you get ideas for setting up a 
blog successfully by cultivating your own talents and observing what others 
are doing right.
When you blog, much depends on the quality of your writing and your abil­
ity to make a connection with your readers. Work on developing a dialogue 
with your readers. Life bloggers often create this connection by revealing 
common experiences that many people can identify with. Businesses can 
choose to start a blog that gives typically silent members of a company 
(such as high-level executives or behind-the-scenes mechanics) a connec­
tion to customers.
	
Many blogs are maintained by more than one person; sometimes, contribu­
tions by several different people can enliven and enrich the conversation, as 
well as decrease the workload for any single blogger.
I cover creating great content in Chapter 8, and in that chapter, you can find 
out how to keep track of what’s working for other bloggers.

 Chapter 7: Finding Your Niche
Lurking on other blogs
You can best figure out what will work on your blog by seeing what’s working on 
other blogs. If you aren’t a regular blog reader, find some blogs and start reading!
The old, old Internet term lurking describes web users who look at blogs, 
mailing lists, online discussions, and forums, but don’t choose to participate 
in them. Lurking online doesn’t have any negative connotations, though the 
word does sound kind of sinister.
In truth, lurking can help you find out about what kinds of communication 
and interaction are appropriate when you’re new to a web community or 
when you’re planning to start one yourself. The vast majority of web users 
are actually lurkers; most people don’t do more than read or look at blogs.
Start your lurking career by finding a few blogs that you like, that you regard as 
competition, or that you find interesting for some reason. If you want to see a 
blog that has a very active, vocal audience, find one that has a lot of comments 
and make sure that you read them all. Many of the blogs mentioned in this 
chapter fall smack into this category, so why not start with them?
If you want to see how a blog evolves, find one that has been around awhile 
and look back through the site’s archives to see how it got started. Most of 
all, pay attention to what you find interesting about the blog.
	
Here are some issues that you can figure out from lurking on a blog:
	
✓	Posts: Watch what the blogger (or bloggers) posts about, how often they 
post, and what days and times attract readers. See whether you can 
understand what prompts a blogger to post.
	
✓	Interaction: Pay attention to the posts that get a lot of comments and 
responses, and try to understand what gets people talking.
	
✓	Resource use: Look for instances when the blogger chooses to include a 
link, a quote, or other resource, and what it adds to the conversation.
	
✓	Design: Keep an eye out for blog designs and styles that you might want 
to imitate on your own blog.
	
✓	Sidebar use: Look at the blog sidebars for cool technologies and tools 
that the blogger uses (and that you might be able use on your own blog).
	
You want interaction with your blog readers, but some comments can cause 
problems because they’re off-topic or offensive, so you can use this opportunity 
to see how other bloggers handle bad comments. Pay attention to whether a 
blog comment policy is in place and how the blogger enforces that policy. When 
does the blogger choose to remove or edit comments? Do you agree with his or 
her choices? How do you want to handle problem comments on your own blog? 
I talk more about handling spam and bad comments in Chapter 8.

Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
While you lurk, keep a list of notes and ideas for later reference, especially 
for items that you think are good ideas but that you aren’t ready to imple­
ment quite yet. You can easily lose those first good ideas if you don’t keep 
track of them somehow.
	
What works for someone else might not work for you, and it doesn’t have to. 
The blogosphere is still young, and you have plenty of room and time to try 
new ideas. Rules and standards that others have adopted give you a good 
starting point, but you don’t have to use them if they don’t work for you.
Participating by commenting
When you’re comfortable, you can start participating in your favorite blogs. 
Leaving comments can start your interactions on a blog. You don’t have to 
take a long time to write comments, they help the blogger, and you might 
even further the conversation with your comment.
Leaving comments gives you experience with participating in a blog audi­
ence, and when you have a blog of your own, you can comment on someone 
else’s blog to let others know about your own blog.
Many blog comment forms give you the chance to leave a URL when you post 
a comment, and the software often links your name to the URL. So, when you 
have a blog, leaving a comment that includes such a link is a bit like leaving 
a tiny, unobtrusive ad. When the blogger and other blog visitors read your 
comment, they might just choose to click the link and visit your blog, espe­
cially if they like what you had to say.
	
You might also get visitors who didn’t like what you say! You invite disagree­
ment any time you put your opinion out into the world, but don’t let that stop 
you from doing it.
Some bloggers have made the mistake of abusing this little privilege, leaving 
comments that don’t add to the topic or say much, simply to get the links to 
their blogs on the other bloggers’ pages. Don’t make this mistake. Be a genu­
ine member of the blogosphere and leave comments only when you truly 
have something to say. “Nice site” is neither interesting to read nor particu­
larly helpful to anyone.
	
Leave comments that distinguish you as a thoughtful contributor to the topic. 
If you can answer a question posed by the blog post or provide information 
that seems to be missing, you really contribute value with your comment. But 
you can also just leave your own opinion, even if you completely disagree with 
what the blogger is saying.

 Chapter 7: Finding Your Niche
Reaching Out to Other Bloggers
Don’t forget that other bloggers are your primary audience. These folks are 
online and already familiar with blogs, and you’re likely to find other bloggers 
with whom you have things in common — maybe even the subject of your 
blog.
Meeting with bloggers in person and communicating with them online are 
terrific ways to network and market your blog. A lot of bloggers list the blogs 
that they read right beside their blog posts in the sidebar called a blogroll, so 
you might be able to generate some additional readership if you create rela­
tionships with bloggers.
Meeting in person
This is going to sound really old school, but you can turn online acquain­
tances into offline friends. In fact, it can be pretty fun.
For example, on a visit to Boston, I posted on the Rockin’ Sock Club blog, 
asking for yarn store recommendations. I also offered to meet with any knit­
ters in town who wanted to get together. (The Rockin’ Sock Club is a sock-
knitting club put together by Blue Moon Fiber Arts. Only members of the sock 
club can post comments and blog posts.) As a result, I had a great afternoon 
with people I never would have met otherwise.
You don’t have to knit socks to get together with bloggers, though. Most 
cities have an active community of bloggers that you can cultivate:
	
✓	Be sure to include your e-mail address and let people know that you 
want to make new friends. Look for similar information on the blogs that 
you read if you’re interested in getting in touch with a blogger.
	
✓	Look for bloggers who identify their locations and get to know them on 
their blogs by posting comments.
	
✓	Visit Upcoming (http://upcoming.yahoo.com) or Meetup (www.
meetup.com), and search for blogger get-togethers in your area. Many 
bloggers network with other nearby bloggers on a regular basis. You can 
even look up get-togethers when you’re visiting a new place.
	
✓	Organize your own get-together and publicize it on your blog, Twitter, or 
on Upcoming or Meetup.

Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
Using social networks
Social networking sites are designed to connect you with your current group 
of friends, and then extend those connections out to their friends. Each site 
that I mention in this section has a different mechanism for making that 
happen, and different types of community interaction occur. LinkedIn (www.
linkedin.com), for example, is a professional networking site designed to 
showcase your work background and interests so that you can make connec­
tions to others in your field.
You can make friends in social-networking online communities, such as 
Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, and Facebook. Social networking sites usually 
give bloggers a way to link to blogs, or even to notify others about new blog 
posts via profile pages. If you’re looking for online connections in the blog­
ging community, these communities are a great place to start.
	
In fact, a lot of bloggers regard their blogs as a form of networking, and 
they’re already looking to make these kinds of connections via social net­
working websites.
Facebook (www.facebook.com) is more about cementing your social friend­
ships, even for tracking down old friends from high school with whom you 
might have lost touch. It has great additional applications and games that 
you can use to break the ice with a new friend.
Regardless of whether the folks in your social network have blogs, you can 
use the site to let them know about your blog, building up your audience and 
hopefully the participation on it by leveraging the goodwill of people you 
know and the people they know!

Chapter 8
Creating Great Content
In This Chapter
▶	Discovering who your audience is
▶	Getting words onto your blog
▶	Adding value by including links
▶	Planning for blogging dry spells
A

 lot of elements work together to make a blog successful, from a well-
designed layout to fancy technical widgets, but none of those things 
are a substitute for good content aimed at the right audience. In fact, if you 
write (or podcast or take photos) well and you’re reaching readers who are 
engaged by your style and content, you can actually be successful without 
spending any time at all on your blog’s appearance. Good content can even 
make your readers forgive an awkward interface or missing bells and whis­
tles, such as RSS feeds or categories.
So, if you do nothing else to make your blog succeed, focus on producing 
great writing, photos, audio, or videos. Know what your audience wants and 
deliver it. In fact, try slightly under-delivering it — keep your audience want­
ing more.
Most blogs include a written component, or are predominantly word-based, 
so this chapter offers pointers on writing well for the web and understanding 
what your audience expects from your blog.
	
In this chapter, I refer to competitors when I am describing other bloggers 
who are covering the same subject area as your blog, or trying to reach the 
same audience you want to attract. Remember that in the blogosphere the 
atmosphere is very collaborative, which means competitors can also be 
friends, contacts, occasional contributors to your blog, participants in your 
comments area, and good resources for information. So when I talk about 
competitors, I do so in the friendliest sense of the word!

Knowing Your Audience
First things first: How well do you know your audience? Are you hitting the 
right notes to attract the readers you want in the quantity you want them?
	
Not all bloggers care about the number of readers they get, but they do care 
about getting the right eyes on their words. Regardless of whether you’re 
number-obsessed or just focused on your niche, you need to understand your 
audience and what your readers are looking for.
You can get an idea about your audience by
	
✓	Using statistics software to track the number of visitors to your blog and 
what links those visitors click
	
✓	Noting the content that elicits the biggest and best response from your 
readers (or the response that you want, even if it isn’t the biggest)
	
✓	Looking at the blogs of others in your subject area to see what you can 
find out from their comment activity, search engine rankings, and other 
data
You might have to wait awhile for statistics and comments, but you can 
easily look at others’ blogs, even if you’re still developing your own blog. I 
talk in detail about measuring site traffic and statistics in Chapter 17, so jump 
there if you want to find out more about the readers you already have.
Finding your competitors
To find your competitors, you must first define your own niche. Your niche 
consists of what you’re blogging about, the topics you cover, and what words 
you use most frequently in your posts. You use these keywords to describe 
yourself, and visitors use them to find you when they conduct a search on 
Google, Yahoo!, Bing, or another search engine.
Use these descriptive words (plus the word blog) to search for yourself on 
Google or another search engine. Investigate the results that come up and 
look for blogs that have content (never mind the look and feel of the blog for 
now) similar to the content you’re creating or want to create.
You can also use one of the blog search engines, such as Technorati (www.
technorati.com), Google Blogs search page (http://blogsearch.
google.com), or Icerocket (www.icerocket.com). Figure 8-1 shows the 
results of a search on Technorati that used the terms diy, wedding, dress, and 
flowers. These results show posts from blogs that talk about these topics.

competitors’

You want to find other blogs that inhabit your niche, and then spend a week 
or two investigating these blogs. Your mission: Find the secret of their suc­
cess, which I discuss in the following section. You want to know how those 
blogs get readers and how they keep those readers coming back for more.
Discovering the secrets of success
While you watch your competitors’ blogs, you have a chance to figure out 
what topics they blog about, of course, but also how they reach out to their 
audience.
	
Your competitors might not be blogging in the most effective way. While you 
look at these blogs, decide whether your competitors are actually reaching 
their audiences successfully or whether they’re falling short. You can learn as 
much from a failing blog as you can from a successful one.
While you visit these blogs, keep a journal of your impressions. Watch the fol­
lowing to investigate how these bloggers handle publishing and outreach:

Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
	
✓	How frequently the blogger puts new posts on the blog: Frequency of 
blog posts is a big deal. Any blogger can tell you to post “frequently,” 
but almost none can tell you what that really means. I talk more about 
how often you should post in the section “Writing Well and Frequently,” 
later in this chapter, but you can explore this idea by noting how often 
your competitors choose to post to their blogs. Do they create new 
posts daily, or even multiple times a day? Or do they post a few times a 
week, or even once a week? When you become a reader of that blog, do 
you find yourself wanting more content or less?
	
✓	When the blogger publishes blog posts: Time of day can have a surpris­
ing impact on how readers receive a blog post. You need to reach your 
audience members when they’re likely to be sitting at their comput­
ers. If your audience consists of stockbrokers, time your posts so that 
new content becomes available just before business hours start on the 
East Coast, not during dinnertime on the West Coast. If you’re target­
ing teens, try to publish before or after school hours, not while they’re 
sitting in homeroom. (Theoretically, they are doing schoolwork at that 
point and not surfing the Internet!)
	
	Sure, your readers can visit your blog anytime and pick up content that 
you posted in the middle of the night, but you can impress them with a 
blog that always seems to have fresh content just when they want it.
	
✓	The length of posts on the blog: You might be surprised to know that 
the ideal length of a blog post is a hotly debated topic among experi­
enced bloggers. Some bloggers swear by the short-and-sweet recipe 
that guides most web writing: Blog posts should get to the point quickly 
and allow readers to get back to their busy days with the information 
that they need. Others find that longer posts — even essays — do the 
job, keeping readers on the site longer and providing more thoughtful 
commentary. The topic of your blog and your audience’s appetite and 
available time, combine to dictate the natural length of your blog posts. 
Looking at your competitors’ blogs can tell you the number of words 
that they find optimal in a blog post, which you can use as a starting 
point for your blog.
	
✓	When the blogger links to outside websites: Linking to other blogs 
and websites is a great way to serve the reader. By pointing out other 
sources of information or even other blogs, you help them become more 
knowledgeable about your topic and keep them engaged with it. So, 
when do your competitors choose to link to other sites, and what sites 
do they link to? Are the links designed to entertain, educate, or inform? 
Are links included in the text of the post or broken out at the end? What 
makes you click a link yourself?
	
	I talk a lot more about linking other sites as a strategy for reaching 
your audience in the section “Linking to Serve the Reader,” later in this 
chapter.

 Chapter 8: Creating Great Content
	
✓	When the blogger addresses his or her audience directly: A lot of blog­
gers use a very personal writing style that directly acknowledges the 
reader, kind of like this book. You might enjoy being addressed directly 
by a blogger because the conversation feels more personal. Or, depend­
ing on the topic of the blog, perhaps a more formal, almost academic 
approach is more appropriate. Either way, check out how your com­
petition is handling this issue. When do they ask readers for input or 
feedback, and how do they phrase those requests? Do readers actually 
respond, and if so, to what kinds of approaches?
	
✓	Use of multimedia, such as photos, audio, and videos: Although the 
majority of blogs are made up of a whole lot of words, you can still 
throw in the occasional (or even frequent) picture or video. In fact, 
bloggers do it all the time to dress things up visually and keep readers 
interested. Take a look at how your competitors include multimedia in 
their blogs. Do they use photos to illustrate the ideas in the posts or just 
to attract the eye? What about animation or video? Do posts that have 
these extras get more comments or fewer? Do you like getting informa­
tion in these other formats, or do you find them distracting?
	
✓	Posts that get a lot of comments and posts that get very few: A blog 
that gets a lot of comments signals that the blogger is resonating with 
his or her audience — even if just to make audience members mad. A 
blog that has no or few comments probably just leaves people flat (or 
maybe isn’t even read). Not all bloggers get hundreds of comments 
every time they post. Some blog posts just get better responses than 
others, and part of what makes a blogger successful is being able to 
know what makes those posts really work so that they can repeat the 
success. Watch your competitors’ blogs to see when a post gets a big 
response and look at what kind of response it gets.
	
	Also, watch for the posts that don’t get any responses. Figure out why 
those posts didn’t work so that you don’t make the same mistake!
	
✓	The writing style of the blogger: Bloggers need to have good content, 
and for most bloggers, that comes down to having an accessible and 
readable writing style. For those blogs in your niche that attract par­
ticipation and good press, what style does the blogger use? Personal? 
Professional? Humorous? What tone appeals to readers and makes them 
come back to the blog again and again? What approach do you find more 
readable and engaging?
Use these same points of analysis on your own blog. After you have your blog 
up and running for awhile, take a look at your content with the same critical 
eye that you use on your competitors. What are you doing right? What are 
you doing incorrectly?

Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
You may find this exercise hard to do. I’m sure you think everything on your 
blog is great; after all, no one sets out to write a bad blog post! Still, some of 
your posts are likely more popular with readers than others, and if you can 
figure out why certain posts work better than others, you can repeat that suc­
cess again and again. In fact, developing a critical eye for your own content 
can really help you make your blog succeed: This medium doesn’t hold still, 
and you need to adapt your style and content while your audience grows and 
changes. Consider conducting this kind of survey of your content a couple 
times a year to make sure that you stay on track and topical to the folks you 
want to attract, even if you’re aiming for just your immediate family.
If you find it tough to view your own content through that kind of lens, but 
you have a friend or two who get what you are doing and can look at it criti­
cally, ask them to do a site review. Just remember, they are giving you opin­
ions and advice, but it’s your call whether you implement any of that!
Profiling your audience
When you finish your competitive analysis (which I explain how to do in the 
preceding section) and after you review your own content successes and fail­
ures, picture your audience in your mind’s eye.
Create a clear vision of just who’s in your audience. If you don’t have the 
audience you’re targeting at this point, develop a picture of who you want in 
your audience.
You don’t actually have to draw a picture, though. You can create this profile 
in words that describe the characteristics of your ideal audience member. 
You can include anything that you want in this profile, from shoe size to per­
sonal hang-ups — any detail that helps you really know this person better 
and create content for this person on your blog.
	
Don’t just say, “My ideal audience is anybody who is interested in [insert your 
blog topic here].” You already know that. Otherwise, this person wouldn’t be 
on your blog in the first place. You want to capture all the details that make 
this person different, unique, and interesting.
Take Gizmodo, as shown in Figure 8-2. Gizmodo (www.gizmodo.com) is 
a techie blog featuring information on gadgets and other nifty technical 
devices. The blog’s tagline is “Gizmodo, the gadget guide. So much in love 
with shiny new toys, it’s unnatural.” Right away, you know that the audience 
for Gizmodo is more than just those interested in gadgets. Gizmodo readers 
adore gadgets, see them as playthings meant to entertain and amuse, and 
are perhaps unhealthily engaged by them (maybe at the expense of other 
hobbies and pursuits). And those audience members want their gadget news 
piping hot, fresh off the presses. Doesn’t that tell you more about what kinds 
of posts will work best to attract and keep these kinds of readers?

Heck, you might even think about what your ideal audience member reads, 
eats, or wears; his or her sleeping habits and style of personal hygiene; and so 
on. If a specific detail seems like it might impact your writing style and con­
tent, throw it into the mix.
When you have a reader profile in hand, you can be more targeted about 
what you choose to write about and how you address that audience.
Writing Well and Frequently
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: The primary ingredients for a success­
ful blog are
	
✓	Good content
	
✓	Frequently updated content
But what do I really mean by good and frequently?
Good content compels, satisfying the readers’ immediate interests but leaving 
them hungry for more. Think of a blog post like an appetizer: It should whet the 
appetite, pique the palette, and sustain the diner until the next course arrives. 
You don’t want to give your readers “annual Thanksgiving dinner” — you want 
them to come back, come back soon, and come back often.
Respecting copyright
As a general rule, anything and everything you

Copyright is just what it sounds like: It focuses 
on “the right to copy” an original creation. 
Copyright law protects an author by giving that 
right solely to him or her.
Unless the creator of an image or photo spe­
cifically licenses his or her copyright to you, 
you can’t reuse it, even if you give the author 
credit or link back to the original story. (This 
rule applies to text, photos, and videos, too.) But 
this rule has a few exceptions: You can quote 
a news story or a blog post on your blog if you 
use only part of it, and as long as you don’t take 
credit for the work. Commentary and critique 
also allow you to excerpt a piece of text or other 
work. But don’t think that just because you’re 
the subject of a story or blog post that you have 
the right to repost the entire article on your blog 
or website. You don’t. When in doubt, ask and 
get permission.

areas around fair use, especially if you plan to 
write reviews.

 Chapter 8: Creating Great Content
As a general rule, blogging has evolved into quite a personal, conversational 
medium, and textual blogs have a strong feel of the author and his or her 
personality. The first blogs were actually online diaries, and even today, most 
bloggers choose to use words such as I or my in their blog posts, creating 
an intimate and open feel — even on corporate blogs. This first-person writ­
ing differs dramatically from most corporate communication, which at best 
refers to the company as our and at worst only refers to the company by its 
full and official name.
Take, for example, one of the McDonald’s blogs, Open for Discussion, which 
was written by McDonald’s Vice President Bob Langert. In a post on August 
20, 2007, Bob wrote:
“We all have one — a pet peeve that we just can’t ditch. I was recently 
reminded of my #1 pet peeve while reading the latest account of 
McDonald’s Moms’ Quality Correspondents. They reported that 
McDonald’s beef is 100% pure USDA-inspected beef. Frankly, I don’t 
think this should be any kind of big ‘Aha’, and I am amazed that so many 
people question this established fact.”

Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
Writing in the first person isn’t as easy as it looks (or reads); after all, most 
people spend years training to write more formally and commonly produce 
all kinds of documents in which first-person writing is emphatically not suit­
able: memos, reports, news stories, invoices, and so on. You may have trou­
ble finding an authentic, genuine voice that really feels comfortable. My best 
advice is to just practice, practice, practice.
Think of your blog posts like letters or e-mails. Speak directly and simply, like 
you would in a personal note or letter. Try not to over-think your words, but 
don’t go right into stream of consciousness (fun to write, hard to read).
	
One of my favorite techniques for making my blog posts readable is to close 
the door of my office and read my post out loud. If it sounds close to something 
I might actually say in conversation, it hits the right tone for a blog post — at 
least, on my blog.
When it seems appropriate, use humor and jokes, especially if you can be 
self-deprecating. People just love self-deprecating bloggers. Here’s an exam­
ple from Stephanie Pearl-McPhee’s Yarn Harlot blog (www.yarnharlot.ca):
“I think that I can’t be the only one who finds LA a little hard on the ol’ 
self esteem. There is an alarmingly high ratio of tall, beautiful people 
compared to us ordinary souls, and it usually doesn’t take long for me, 
the shabby and usually bra-less to feel out of place.”
Sometimes I find it difficult to write to some anonymous audience member 
and get a conversational tone, so I imagine that I’m writing to a good friend. If 
I can be interesting enough to hold her attention, it ought to do the trick for 
my readers, too!
	
If you make your blog informal and conversational, you still can’t completely 
ignore spelling, grammar, and sentence structure. Some bloggers do opt for 
a completely unedited approach, right down to not using capital letters, but 
keep in mind that people have more trouble, not less, reading poorly formu­
lated writing. If you have a business or professional blog, you definitely need 
to pay attention to spelling and grammar because these little details influence 
your credibility. Do your readers a favor — use the grammar and spellcheck 
functions of your word processor.
On the other hand, many blogs have made a reputation based on using 
incorrect spelling or grammar! An example is the funny blog I Can Has 
Cheezburger? (www.icanhascheezburger.com), which has built its popu­
larity largely on bad spelling in hilariously captioned photos of cats.
	
Many bloggers like to quote news articles and blog posts, and then expand on 
them. If you take this approach, make sure that you understand the rules of 
copyright law when you use someone else’s words — it’s always best to ask 
permission! For more, read the sidebar “Respecting copyright.”

 Chapter 8: Creating Great Content
Linking to Serve the Reader
Links — you need ’em. You may worry that by providing a link to a news 
story or online article, you’re sending your readers away from your site into 
the black hole of the Internet, never to return. Your readers might, in fact, 
click the link and go read the article. But they probably won’t forget where 
they found the link.
On a blog, links are just as much a resource as any other information that you 
provide. In fact, many blogs actually consist of collections of links around a 
topic or theme, pulled together to inform or entertain the blog’s readers.
	
If you’re providing good content and expanding on that content by using links, 
you’re doing your readers a service that they won’t forget — one they likely 
come back to you for.
Joey deVilla doesn’t shy away from adding links to his blog posts on The 
Adventures of Accordion Guy in the 21st Century (www.joeydevilla.com), 
as shown in Figure 8-4.
	
Figure 8-4:

links to his 
blog posts,

readers 
get more  
information.
	
In a September 20, 2007, post about the Canadian dollar’s parity with the U.S. 
dollar, he included links to bios of the U.S. president and Canadian prime 
minister in office during the last time the currencies were equal, and he pro­
vided links to pop culture references current at that time. Also, he collected a 
list of news stories that covered the event.
Speaking of dollars, links are the currency of the blogosphere. A lot of blog­
gers point their readers to blog posts that they find especially interesting, 
even going so far as to quote the other blogger. In the sidebars of their blogs, 
bloggers regularly build lists of links to blogs that they read. These lists are 
called blogrolls.

Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
In general, bloggers are generous about linking to other blogs and websites 
because the favor is frequently returned. As the saying goes, “You have to 
spend a little to make a little.”
	
Adding links to your posts is a good thing . . . unless you’re irresponsible 
about what you link to. Take your responsibility as a publisher seriously and 
don’t send people to suspect resources or throw them into an adult-oriented 
site without warning.
	
When you link to a blog post, be sure you link to the permalink URL, not the 
blog’s home page. A permalink is the unique Web address for an individual 
blog post — the permanent link to that page. You should use the permalink 
because the blogger might update the blog any time after you create the link, 
pushing the post that you mention down or even off the blog’s home page.
The Web Style Guide (www.webstyleguide.com) covers everything from 
good web design standards to graphics production, but you can probably 
benefit most from Chapter 9 of the guide, which covers links, titles, and 
common online styles.
Breaking Through a Blank Screen
At times, even outstanding bloggers hit dry spells and can’t think of a word 
to write. You can safely anticipate a day sometime in the lifespan of your blog 
when you literally have nothing to say to your readers, no matter how much 
enthusiasm you have for your topic.
This phase will pass, but sometimes, you need a little help pushing back to a 
productive spot. Here are a few tips for making it through your dry spell:
	
✓	Stockpile a few evergreen posts. In newsrooms around the world, jour­
nalists regularly create evergreen stories (stories that can be printed or 
televised at any time and still be interesting). You can also put together a 
few evergreen blog posts that you can keep on hand against a day when 
your creative juices temporarily dry up. You can also use these kinds 
of posts for days when you’re sick or on vacation, but still want to have 
something publish on your blog. A lot of blog software allows you to 
schedule a publication date for a blog post in the future, so you can even 
set these posts to go up automatically and take a well-deserved break.
	
✓	Ask a friend to guest blog for a few days. Bring some new perspec­
tive to your blog when you have none left yourself by asking a friend, 
colleague, fellow blogger, or even a critic to write some blog posts for 
you. Your readers might enjoy the change of style and tone (and if they 
don’t, you make them that much happier when you come back!). Be

 Chapter 8: Creating Great Content
sure to return the favor when your guest blogger has a dry spell of his 
or her own.
	
✓	Recycle an oldie but goodie. When you can’t think of exciting new 
content, bring out a great post from your archives. New readers appre­
ciate seeing something they missed, and old readers might find new 
information in a second read. Professional blogger Darren Rowse points 
his readers to a list of best-of posts on ProBlogger (www.problogger.
net). In fact, Darren pulls out the best posts of all time, for the month, 
for new readers, and just some of his favorites (see Figure 8-5).
	
✓	Hold a contest. When the well has run dry, you can hold a contest. Ask 
your readers to submit funny photos or write a caption for one of your 
funny photos. Show them a bottle of jellybeans and ask for guesses 
about how many pieces of candy are in the bottle. You get the idea: 
Distract them with shiny, happy prizes! But make sure you’re fair and 
impartial in how you award prizes. If you say you plan to hold a raffle, be 
sure to actually do so!
	
✓	Post a photo. Rather than 1,000 words, put up a single photo. Take a pic­
ture of where you usually blog, show off your new laptop, or just take a 
walk in your neighborhood. You can dig out a photo of yourself as a kid 
or show that embarrassing haircut you had in the ’80s.

Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
	
✓	Post about the books, movies, or television that you’re consuming. 
Tell folks about the other media you’re enjoying. You can even hook up 
an Amazon Associates account and earn a little money from your rec­
ommendations. (You can find out how to set up this kind of account in 
Chapter 18.)
	
✓	Give out your favorite recipe. Dig out the cookbook and find your 
grandmother’s fudge recipe or your mom’s apple pie recipe, and share it 
with your readers. Better yet, take a break from the computer and make 
the recipe yourself so that you can put up a photo with your post.
	
✓	Blog from a new location. Sometimes, breaking the routine can shake 
loose those recalcitrant brain cells. Try blogging from another room in 
your house, or head to the local Internet cafe or coffee shop.
	
✓	Record an audio podcast. If you can’t write, talk! Give the gift of your 
voice to your readers — listeners — by trying something new and differ­
ent. You might be pleasantly surprised and make podcasting a regular 
feature of your blog. Chapter 12 covers podcasting extensively.
	
✓	Do an interview. Ask a friend, colleague, neighbor, child, parent, boss, 
or public figure whether you can interview him or her for your blog. 
Type up a few questions, e-mail them off, and when the answers arrive in 
your inbox, a little copying and pasting should do the trick.
	
✓	Take a quiz. Let your readers know what superhero you are or what 
color your personality is by playing with some of the fun quizzes and 
polls online. The Superhero Quiz is at www.thesuperheroquiz.com 
(I’m Spider-Man), and you can find loads of others on blogthings (www.
blogthings.com) and Quiz Meme (www.quizmeme.com).
	
✓	Ask for suggestions from your readers. Appeal to your readers for help 
finding new topics to post about. Also, look through your old posts and 
see whether you can expand on a post that worked well; check out com­
ments and e-mails from readers, too!

Comments
In This Chapter

▶	Maintaining and managing your blogging community
▶	Dealing with spammy comments on your blog
▶	Handling negative comments on other blogs
E

very blog should have comments. Love them or hate them, they’re an inte­
gral part of blogging. Comments provide the main source of interaction 
between you and your readers. Visitors to your blog can ask you questions, 
correct your writing, suggest your next blog topic, or leave a note to say hello.
Unfortunately, as interesting and thought-provoking as comment conver­
sations can be, they’re not without their challenges. Comment spam and 
negative commentary can take the joy out of blogging and make managing 
comments on your blog feel like a full-time job.
How you handle your blog community determines your level of stress and 
success. In this chapter, I talk about how you can set your own comment 
rules and monitor your community. I also give you tips about how to make 
your blog a positive place for conversation, as well as provide strategies for 
dealing with spammers and negativity.
Getting Interaction Going with Comments
Comments are an important part of a blog. When a blogger opts, through 
choice or necessity, to turn off commenting, the blogger loses some of what 
makes blogging such a dynamic, exciting medium: the interaction between 
blogger and readers. Not only the blogger loses out when he or she removes 
comments — most blog readers enjoy the comments left by others and often 
form a strong community feeling for fellow visitors.

Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
A blogger may turn off comments when he or she simply doesn’t have the 
time or desire to read and respond to them, or when the tenor of the com­
ments becomes a problem. Popular blogger Heather Armstrong only selec­
tively allows comments on her blog Dooce (www.dooce.com) because her 
religious views and style of blogging generate a lot of negative interaction 
with readers in the comments. Political bloggers often have similar problems.
Other bloggers’ main issue with comments is often related to time. A popular 
blogger can get hundreds of comments on a single blog post, and it takes 
time to read and respond to those comments, much less remove any inappro­
priate comments. Spam can also lead a blogger to restrict comments. Just as 
with e-mail, spammers have discovered that they can throw their unwanted 
Blogs that have active comment communities
While you experiment with comments, see how 
sites that have vibrant, active communities 
handle the onslaught of opinion and discus­
sion. The following popular blogs have devel­
oped an involved and vocal audience that you 
can explore:
Boing Boing (www.boingboing.net): This 
grandfather of blogs brings together the weird 
and wonderful from all over the web for the 
entertainment and bemusement of its readers. 
Readers are healthily active in the comments, 
and the blog features a navigation item labeled 
Suggest a Link that encourages readers to send 
their suggestions for future posts.
Gizmodo (www.gizmodo.com): This gadget 
guide keeps you abreast of all the latest in 
shiny tech toys, from car stereos to mobile 
phones — and does so in multiple languages, 
to boot. Comments on this blog range from the 
rabid fan to the disgruntled critic and add as 
much value as the blog posts.
Nuts About Southwest (www.blogsouth
west.com): Folks from all levels of the 
Southwest Airlines organization post to this 
blog, which covers topics such as new boarding 
procedures, dress codes, and food offerings. 
Judging from the hundreds of comments on 
some posts, Southwest is getting plenty of 
feedback from its customers on experiences 
with the airline.
Yarn Harlot (www.yarnharlot.ca): 
Stephanie Pearl-McPhee is an avid knitter 
turned knitting book author. You simply won’t 
believe how popular her blog is or how many of 
her readers comment on her humorous posts 
about knitting projects and her family life.
The Pioneer Woman Cooks! (www.the
pioneerwoman.com/cooking): Warning! 
Reading this blog can make you very hungry. 
Ree, wife to a cattle rancher, posts mouthwa­
tering recipes amply illustrated with photo­
graphs. If you’re looking for ideas about what 
to cook for dinner, Ree has ideas. Judging by 
the comments that her blog receives, you can 
trust her cooking advice.
Truthdig (www.truthdig.com): This news 
website has won multiple Webby Awards 
for Best Political Blog in both the Juried and 
People’s Choice categories. The site combines 
commentary on current political issues with 
book reviews, podcasts, and interviews, and 
it gets loads of feedback from fans and critics.

commercial messages (anyone need a refinance?) into blogs. Even with the 
best blog software, some spam messages end up on the blog.
Still, the vast majority of blogs allow comments, and those blogs benefit hugely 
from the interaction and fun that comments can generate. On a blog such as 
Grey Matter (www.greyswriters.com), from the writers of the TV show Grey’s 
Anatomy, readers really get involved with the show’s writers. In the comments, 
readers share their thoughts on the show, offering feedback and suggestions.
Getting involved
	
If you want to have a dialogue with your readers, you need to allow comments on 
your blog, whether you’re reaching out to your parents or to your customers.
Just because your blog posts have a comment form, though, people don’t 
necessarily just jump in and start commenting. You need to tailor your posts 
to elicit dialogue and feedback, perhaps even by going so far as to ask specifi­
cally for responses.
	
If the comment areas of your blog look a little bare, ask some friends to help 
by reading and commenting for a few weeks. Comments tend to generate more 
comments, if you can get the ball rolling.
Of course, the problem might lie with your content or approach, so don’t be 
afraid to experiment with your topic or style to try to get better results from 
your comment forms.
You want to be involved in your blogging community, right? If you don’t, then 
turn that comment function off. Here’s a quick checklist of tips for cultivating 
comments on your blog:
	
✓	Make it easy for your readers to comment. Sometimes, readers can 
have problems finding that Comment Now button or link. Keep your 
comment links visible to encourage people to comment.
	
✓	Ask questions of your readers. Get your readers to start participating 
by requesting advice, seeking out information, or asking for a recipe. 
The simple act of asking can do wonders for comments. Ask your visi­
tors to tell you stories, answer questions, or give advice. For instance, 
if you’re blogging about a frustrating travel experience, you might ask 
your readers for tips for the future. Or, if you’re looking for a new laptop 
bag, ask your readers to recommend bags that they like.
	
	Specific, rather than general, questions work best to start a conversation.
	
✓	Request topics or ideas. Requesting ideas about your blog topics can 
generate an amazing response. You may also invite readers to send in

blog posts they write that could benefit the community of your site. (If 
you make this invitation, make sure that you’re clear about who owns 
the copyright! As the publisher of the content, you probably want to 
have the guest bloggers assign copyright to you.)
	
✓	Communicate with your readers. Make sure you’re actively talking to 
your readers by responding to the comments that they leave on your 
blog.
	
✓	Host comment-related contests. Think of ways that you can turn com­
ments into a contest. One common contest strategy involves asking 
people to leave a comment in order to enter a contest, and then drawing 
a winner randomly from those who participate. Ree Drummond, author 
of the Pioneer Woman Cooks blog, does this; in a July 2011 contest, 
more than 40,000 comments were left on a giveaway blog post.
Also, get involved with your blogging community. Visit other blogs and use 
their comment systems to get involved with their readers. In return, if you’re 
active enough with your comments, those readers visit you, as well.
Enabling comments
Most modern blog software, regardless of whether it’s hosted or installed 
on your own web server (see Chapter 3), has tools that allow your visitors 
to comment and tools that allow you to handle the comments you receive. 
Check your documentation to figure out what functionality the software 
you’re using offers — and don’t forget that you may be able to customize the 
way in which your comment tools are configured to better suit your prefer­
ences and audience.
If you find yourself in a situation in which you use software that doesn’t have 
that capability, and you can’t change software, you can find third-party solu­
tions. In fact, many bloggers who use top-of-the-line blog software opt to use 
another tool for comments because they want specific functionality.
One such tool is DISQUS (www.disqus.com), which offers a truly impressive 
range of functionality options — plus, it’s free! You can use it to
	
✓	Allow visitors to track comments via e-mail or RSS.
	
✓	Allow visitors to rank comments on the site or reply to a comment 
directly.
	
✓	Allow visitors to flag comments as inappropriate or spam.
	
✓	Sort how the comments appear, either by date or popularity.
	
✓	Moderate comments to remove, edit, and screen out unwanted content.

 Chapter 9: Building Community with Comments
Managing Comments
Like all good things, comments require care and feeding. Although I believe 
the resulting community dialogue makes that effort worthwhile, I can’t deny 
that managing comments involves real work and time. In the following sec­
tions, I talk about ways you can set up your blog for comments, prevent pos­
sible problems, and deal with problems if they do crop up.
Establishing community guidelines
You want comments, but you want the right comments. Ideally, your visitors 
provide on-topic, interesting, and never ever profane feedback. Of course, we 
don’t live in an ideal world, so setting some community guidelines for partici­
pation on your site can help clarify your expectations to your readers. Make 
those guidelines straightforward and clear. Your rules may exclude anything 
you want. Common blog rules outlaw comments that include
	
✓	Racist or bigoted speech
	
✓	Sexually explicit content
	
✓	Discussions or descriptions of violent or criminal acts
	
✓	Unlicensed copyrighted material
	
✓	Threats, harassment, or personal privacy violations
You have to enforce these rules, but simply having them in place can deter 
troublemakers from posting at all, particularly if you’re scrupulous in enforc­
ing your guidelines quickly.
The blogging software solution that you use might also have a set of standards 
in place with which both you and your visitors must comply. For example, 
Microsoft Windows Live Spaces (http://home.spaces.live.com), a hosted 
blogging solution, has a community code of conduct that you must enforce on 
your blog (shown in Figure 9-1). Every hosted blogging service has its own set of 
rules that you should be aware of. Don’t get caught breaking the rules!
	
You may need to adapt any guidelines that you create over time, especially 
while your blog grows in popularity or changes its focus. Be sure to set a time 
every so often to review your own guidelines and make changes. You might 
include your visitors in the development of the community guidelines, checking 
with your readers about what you do to protect them. They’ll love you for it.
Figure 9-2 shows the blog comment policy written by Kathryn Lord, who 
blogs about online dating and relationships on her website (www.find-a-
sweetheart.com). For Kathryn, it all comes down to having common cour­
tesy for her and for other readers — mud-slinging comments are history.

 Chapter 9: Building Community with Comments
On Greg Mankiw’s blog for economics students, he asked his readers to simply 
treat each other with respect: “Please approach this blog with the civility you 
would bring to a college seminar. Don’t post anything here that you wouldn’t 
say to a fellow seminar participant face to face.” You can read Greg’s full 
blog comment policy at http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/09/
comments-policy.html. Unfortunately, Greg Mankiw couldn’t enforce 
his comments policy and decided to close comments entirely.
	
If you’re thinking about writing a blog comment policy, take a look at what other 
bloggers have done. A quick search on Google for blog comment policy turns 
up some well-done policies that might give you ideas. And remember, you can 
add a blog comment policy at any time and amend your policy as needed.
Editing comments
Sometimes, a reader posts a legitimate comment that you need to alter in 
some way. For example, you might prefer to remove profanity from otherwise 
legitimate comments or edit a long web link that’s breaking a page layout. 
Whatever the situation, edit a reader’s comments delicately.
Some of your readers might react poorly to having their words edited, and of 
course, the last thing you intend is to insult a reader by pointing out spelling 
or grammar issues. Use a sensitive hand, but remember that a comment on 
your blog is as much a part of the conversational give-and-take as your original 
blog posts. Not only that, but you’re also responsible for the words on your 
blog and may feel that you have a duty to remove hateful or offensive language, 
especially if young audiences read your blog.
	
Your blog is your domain, your kingdom, and your place in the world, so your 
word is final.
Of course, when you choose to edit a comment, you might want to alert read­
ers that you have done so and why, as I’ve done in comment #7 on my own 
blog, shown in Figure 9-3. You may also want to lay out in your blog comment 
policy circumstances in which you’ll edit comments. Both these techniques 
can head off accusations of censorship.
Deleting comments
Unfortunately, not all the comments on your blog are fun to read, or are even 
remarks that should stay on your blog. When it comes right down to it, you 
control which comments appear on your blog, whether you moderate them 
ahead of time or afterward. You need to moderate comments because quite a 
few of your blog’s comments probably come from spammers and add nothing 
to the conversation. But sometimes, you may need to delete comments from 
real people that are even on topic. Every blogger has to make a choice about 
what kinds of comments to delete.

An edited comment
Bloggers choose to delete comments for several reasons:
	
✓	Comments are off-topic for the post to which they’re attached (a common 
issue with spam comments).
	
✓	Comments make personal attacks on the blogger or other readers. For 
example, many bloggers draw the line at comments that contain racial 
slurs, name-calling, hate language, or speculation about things such as 
sexual orientation. People who leave these types of comments are often 
called trolls.
	
✓	Comments left anonymously or by using a fake name and e-mail address.
	
✓	Comments feature a URL apparently included for marketing purposes.
	
✓	Comments are libelous.
	
✓	Comments are obscene.

✓	Comments contain private information (which you don’t want to make 
public).
	
✓	Comments contain plagiarized material.
	
In blogging terms, a troll is an individual who posts irrelevant and often inflam­
matory things in blog comments. Trolls try to get an emotional response out 
of people and can be quite disruptive. Most blogs won’t see any troll activity, 
but if you become popular, they will make an appearance from time to time.
	
Deleting comments is quite a personal decision, one that any good blogger 
runs into. After all, you want to get people talking, so you need to have opin­
ions that can start dialogue. A milquetoast approach doesn’t make an interest­
ing blog, even if it does prevent offensive comments.
Most blog readers can accept that you get to make the decisions about which 
comments stay and which get the heave-ho on your own blog. Nobody likes to 
have their comments deleted, however, and readers often criticize bloggers 
when those bloggers delete comments, especially when the readers don’t know 
why the bloggers deleted those comments. If you find yourself being ques­
tioned about deleted comments, you can always write a blog post about how 
you deal with comments and remind your readers about your blog’s comment 
policy, or refer them to your comment policy if you have one.
Moderating comments
The single best solution for keeping spam off your blog is to read each and 
every comment left on your blog individually, removing the comments that 
are spam or inappropriate. Sifting through your blog’s comments is called 
moderating. Moderating your blog comments can add overhead to your blog­
ging time, but if you’re dedicated to making your blog successful and useful 
to your readers, it’s time well spent.
You have several options for how you manage the time that you spend look­
ing through comment lists, but the method you choose as your primary line 
of defense depends on how your community grows.
You, your community, your software, or a combination of all three can mod­
erate your blog. Table 9-1 covers the pros and cons of three approaches that 
you can try. Some bloggers have strong preferences at the outset, but you 
can experiment with the best setup for your blog and readers.

You need to keep the soft­

spammers always work 
out new ways to cheat the

behind-the-scenes technical

against personal attacks or 
flames.
You can most easily maintain your sanity by using a combination of the meth­

online discussion, experiment with these methods to find one that suits you 
and your readers, while letting you keep enough time in your schedule for 
actually writing new blog posts!
	
Some blogs have communities that build quickly, whereas others take more 
time. You might need to change your spam prevention methods from time to 
time in order to take advantage of the community desire to help.
Recognizing Spam Comments
Spam! It’s everywhere, lurking in your e-mail inbox, waiting to pounce on an 
unsuspecting click. It also hangs out on your blog, hiding in the comments —

183
 Chapter 9: Building Community with Comments
you might never escape it! Fortunately, you can slow the stream of spam mes­
sages, and even block most of them from appearing on your blog.
I don’t recommend disabling comments just to keep out the spam. Blog com­
ments are crucial for the life and health of your blog; if you want to make 
your blog more than just another website by having real conversations with 
your readers, you can’t forego comments. You have to take the good with the 
bad. And I won’t lie about the bad: Fighting spam can consume valuable time 
and energy. If you’re serious about blogging, you have to do it, no matter how 
unrewarding it feels. It’s like taking out the trash: no fun, but if you don’t do 
it, your house fills with garbage.
Any unwanted message that someone posts in the comment area of your 
blog is spam, especially those messages that include links to fabulous drug 
cocktails, unbelievable mortgage opportunities, and solutions to certain . . . 
ahem . . . anatomical size problems (which, naturally, you don’t have).
The first time you see a spam comment on your blog, you might not recog­
nize it. Long ago, you could easily pick out the spam posts on blogs: They 
consisted of incomprehensible text, inappropriate images, and links to por­
nographic websites. But, while the blogs evolved, so did the spammers, and 
today’s spam comments might look like anything from a sincere compliment 
to a request for more information. Figure 9-4 shows a spam comment that 
was left on one of my blogs.

You — your brain and eyes — protect your blog from the outside world. If 
something looks suspicious to you, check it out so that you can protect your­
self, your readers, and your search engine ranking.
Because you’re the first line of defense, you need to get a feel for the com­
ments that are legitimately posted on your site. Take some time to see what 
your community is like. If your blog community needs time to grow, venture 
out onto other blogs and see what people are saying:
	
✓	Look at real comments and see how they’re written.
	
✓	Get involved and add your own commentary to other blogs. The more 
experience you have at posting comments, the better you can identify 
the spam on your site.
When you take the time to read real comments, you can more easily spot the 
spam.
Spam has certain styles. Spammers attempt to weasel into your site by look­
ing like they have personal or generally harmless content. Sometimes, you 
can’t tell a legitimate comment that has poor grammar and spelling from a 
spam comment that has similar attributes. Spammers count on this confu­
sion. You may find sorting the wheat from the chaff a tricky bit of business, 
but by following a few tips, you can get through the spam onslaught with as 
little frustration as possible. Examine the following types of comments with 
skepticism:
	
✓	Personalized and customized messages: A real human being creates 
this type of spam, as opposed to an automated bit of programming. 
Usually a human being, paid by a spam company, visits your blog, reads 
a few posts and a few comments, and then customizes messages that fit 
in with the tone and style of the site. Often, the spammers even direct 
these messages to you by name. You can easily miss these messages 
when you’re watching for spam comments.
	
	If the link that’s included with a comment isn’t related to the subject of 
the comment or the topics on your blog, the comment is suspect, no 
matter how on-topic it might seem.
	
✓	Generic commentary or questions: The generic message spam either 
requests that you do something or makes a very nonspecific remark. 
You often see comments such as, You’ve got the same name as I 
do, Have you seen the new video?, Check out my blog?, Need 
you to do something for me, or Your blog is broken you 
need to see this.
	
✓	Flattery: Finally, spammers use flattery. Spammers may send comments 
such as Your blog is awesome or I like your blog, click to 
read mine. As a general rule, regard these kinds of brief praise with 
suspicion (well, unless your blog really is awesome, of course!). Real 
fans usually elaborate more about what they like about your writing.

 Chapter 9: Building Community with Comments
	
In general, a spam comment includes a link, usually to an advertising website 
or a site designed to look like a blog. The spammers hope that you or your 
blog visitors click the link, giving those spammers a traffic boost and poten­
tially allowing them to collect a fee based on the number of times users visit 
the site or click a link. Look closely at comments that include links.
Many comment spammers are annoyingly ingenious about finding ways to 
disguise their messages. (Some aren’t — you can easily recognize as spam 
the comments about Viagra or the ones that contain gibberish.) But the 
generic nature of comments gives them away. Keep your wits about you so 
that you can identify new trends and formats in comment spam techniques 
when they appear. The techniques described in this chapter can help you 
prevent or remove spam, but the human brain is endlessly inventive, which 
keeps the spammers a step ahead of any software solution to the problem.
Understanding why spam exists
Junk snail mail, e-mail spam, and blog spam all 
exist for the same reason: because someone, 
somewhere, makes money on them. You may 
find this fact hard to believe if you just look at 
spam comments — a lot of them don’t really 
make much sense, much less look like some­
thing you might click.
But spam comments aren’t necessarily 
designed to make you or your readers click 
them. Blog spammers usually just want to raise 
the search engine profile of a site that they 
link to in their comments. Search engines use 
secret formulas to determine the result listings 
that you see when you do a search. The formula 
works to determine and display the most rele­
vant results — the ones that best match your 
search terms — at the top of the list. One of the 
ingredients in this secret formula is the number 
of websites that link to a site, and another ingre­
dient is the words used for that link.
So, when you write a blog post about a com­
pany that has a product you love and link to 
the company, you’re really doing it two favors: 
You’ve praised it publicly, and you’ve given 
it a little boost in the search engine rankings, 
which helps it come up a little higher the next 
time someone searches for the product you 
reviewed. Aren’t you nice? Now imagine that 
ten more customers do the same thing on their 
blogs. The company gets a lot of search engine 
love for all those different links.
Spammers are trying to scam this process by 
creating dozens, even hundreds, of links from 
many different web pages to the website that 
they’re attempting to boost in the search engine 
rankings. When a site appears high in the 
search engine rankings, you know what hap­
pens: More people visit it more often.
Ultimately, comment spam might simply want 
to get people to visit a particular website, but 
it takes a fairly indirect path to that result. After 
someone opens the website, the unfortunate 
visitor might get a chance to buy a product, 
click a link, provide information that he or she 
shouldn’t about bank accounts, or view a page 
that has ads on it. And that’s where the spam­
mers make profit.

Don’t just leave comment spam on your blog and let your readers sort 
through the mess. Spam attracts spam: If you don’t remove these kinds of 
comments, you actually end up with more spam on your site. And, when your 
readers click the spam links, spammers realize that you’re not tending your 
blog, so they flock to it. Delete your spam. Your readers will thank you.
Unfortunately, spam isn’t the only unwanted comment material you might 
deal with. Some of your legitimate commenters may use language that you 
don’t want on your blog or post personal, offensive flames (or attacks) 
aimed at you or other readers. You’re just as entitled to remove this kind of 
comment as you are to remove spam. In most cases, you can use the tech­
niques described in the following section to handle flames and spam com­
ments alike.
	
Don’t avoid blogging just because of the amount of spam you’re bound to get. 
After all, junk messages aren’t anything new. You see spam in your e-mail all 
the time; heck, you even see it in your snail mail box, and you probably aren’t 
about to stop getting mail delivered, right?
Fighting Spam with Software
Spam is a pain. But consider how much spam you really have to deal with: 
Do you get three spam messages every few weeks, or are you getting 500 
an hour? If you’re receiving only a few every month, you might not need to 
install any software because you can moderate the few problem comments 
yourself pretty easily. If your blog gets dozens of comments every day, how­
ever, spam fighting can take up a lot of your time. The following sections 
explore some of the many blog software solutions available to make this task 
a little faster and easier.
Protecting your comment form
The tools described in the following sections are designed to give spammers 
trouble filling out the comment form on your blog. These tools try to prevent 
the spam from ever reaching your blog so that you don’t need to deal with 
reading and deleting it.
	
These tools do that job fairly well, but they also present something of a barrier 
to people who want to leave a legitimate comment; remember, you want to cut 
down on spam, not real comments! Keep your audience’s needs and abilities 
in mind when you implement any spam-fighting tools.

 Chapter 9: Building Community with Comments
CAPTCHAs
A CAPTCHA (an acronym for something really long and boring) is a challenge-
response test, meaning it’s a question that your reader must answer cor­
rectly in order to post a comment. On a blog, CAPTCHAs are most commonly 
implemented in such a way that humans can complete them but comput­
ers can’t. A CAPTCHA on the World Hum travel site (www.worldhum.com) 
requires the would-be commenter to duplicate the letters and numbers 
shown in an image in order to submit a comment, as shown in Figure 9-5.
CAPTCHAs were created to stop spammers from adding comments to blogs 
by using automated scripts that try to fill out any web form that they find, 
especially blog comment forms. But spammers are inventive: Some blog com­
ment scripts can now recognize letters and numbers in an image, so many 
sites that use CAPTCHAs distort the text by stretching it, or layering it with 
graphic random graphic elements.
Other sites use CAPTCHA questions that are simple for humans to answer, 
such as trivia or mathematical questions. For example, “What color is a red 
balloon?” These kinds of CAPTCHAs are new and have yet to prove their 
effectiveness, but you might want to check into them and see for yourself 
how they work.

Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
Your blog software may have CAPTCHA technology built in, or you might be able 
to add one by using a plug-in. Check your blog software’s documentation and 
support tools for suggestions on installing and configuring a CAPTCHA system.
User registration
Registration is a popular option with larger communities, especially online 
forums. The community requests or even requires that users who want to 
leave comments sign up for a user account. These accounts are typically free, 
but to complete the registration process, you must provide a name and valid 
e-mail address, thereby cutting down on the number of spam scripts that can 
create an account and therefore post comments. Sites that require registra­
tion actually prevent anyone who isn’t registered from leaving a comment; 
sites that simply request registration reward registering by recognizing mem­
bers or by marking a registered user’s comments in some highlighted way.
This setup lets you keep a record of everything that a particular poster adds 
to the system, easily identifying your most frequent contributors and visitors. 
Also, if a poster gets out of hand, or an automated spam system acquires an 
account and posts by using that username, you can simply close the account 
and stop the poster from posting again by using that account.
Blog software is increasingly offering registration, so be sure to check your 
documentation. If your software doesn’t offer registration, look for a plug-in 
that does.
Screening for spam
Software that filters the incoming comments in various ways can provide a 
defense against spammers by identifying and removing comments that look 
like spam. These filters give a blogger great tools: They run all hours of the 
day and they don’t require any effort on your part. But an automated process 
is never as smart as a human, so you might occasionally lose a valid com­
ment if you use a filtering system.
A third-party software solution called Automattic Akismet (see the sidebar 
“Akismet,” later in this chapter) is the clear leader when it comes to spam 
filtering, though many blogging software applications have added their own 
internal tools, as well. Check to see whether your blog software has any of 
these technologies in place for you to use; you can probably find some of 
them available. If you don’t, check http://akismet.com/development to 
see whether you can add Akismet to your blog.
Keyword filtering
Keyword filters can help you identify incoming comment spam. This kind of 
filtering is probably the oldest type of protection for blog comments. It might

189
 Chapter 9: Building Community with Comments
not work all the time because spammers have become much smarter since 
this technology was first used. Spam filtering usually works by comparing 
incoming comments against lists of words and/or phrases associated with 
spam. Matches indicate spam, and the filter yanks those comments.
Keyword filters are typically updated frequently to keep up with the ploys 
that spammers use. Some of these lists contain web addresses and other 
computer identification information, as well as keywords. Users also can 
submit and maintain their own lists in case custom spelling or other methods 
of tricking the anti-spam system come into use (for example, using V1agra, 
rather than Viagra).
Several services over the years have allowed different blog tools and 
platforms to take advantage of a central keyword listing. These lists are 
maintained and updated by a third-party company. Today’s most popular 
anti-spam system, Akismet (see the sidebar “Akismet,” later in this chapter), 
falls into this category.
	
One problem with this kind of filter system is that some spammers leave nice 
messages that include bad links. These messages get past the filter because 
they aren’t offensive and don’t violate any rule that you have.
Blacklists and whitelists
A blog blacklist is a method of keeping spam off your website by prevent­
ing certain known spam systems from accessing your comment system or 
your website as a whole. By specifically identifying spammers from certain 
addresses, countries, or computers, or by using certain URLs, you can block 
those individual spammers, keeping your blog much safer.
Most blogging software comes with a blacklist system built in or a system 
that you can easily add by using a plug-in or third-party solution. Consult 
your blog software documentation to be sure that you understand how to 
keep your blacklist up to date and how you can contribute to the blacklist.
Whitelists perform the opposite action of a blacklist by specifically permit­
ting certain visitors or types of visitors. A whitelist is a preselected list of 
visitors whom you know won’t post spam on your blog. Bloggers use a 
whitelist in conjunction with a blacklist. Whitelists can allow you to accept 
comments from visitors who have been misidentified as spammers in the 
past. Essentially, you’re making your blog accessible to certain people or 
computer networks. If you want to guarantee that your mother, for instance, 
can always post to your blog — or even if you want to set it up so that she 
doesn’t have to comply with a CAPTCHA or other anti-spam techniques — 
add her to the whitelist so that she can post with impunity. Whitelists are 
uncommon, so if your blogging software doesn’t offer this functionality, you 
probably can’t find a good third-party solution.

Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
IP banning
Similar to blacklists, IP banning prevents certain IP addresses or a range of 
IP networks from accessing your website. IP banning is probably the oldest 
method of protecting blogs.
	
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a series of numbers that identifies a net­
work, a computer, or any networked electronic device within a computer 
network. Devices such as printers, fax machines, desktop and laptop comput­
ers, and some telephones can have their own IP addresses.
Many blog software solutions offer lists of banned IP addresses that they col­
lect from other users of the same software who have identified spammers, 
and you can automatically update your own list to prevent those spammers 
from posting to your site.
A potential problem with banning networks or certain IP addresses is that 
the offending poster may connect via a different IP address the next time 
that he or she posts something. Banning by IP address can work for known 
spam companies, but it’s highly fallible because so many computers regularly 
obtain new IP addresses through their Internet Service Providers (ISPs). IP 
banning can also affect people whom you don’t actually want to block. For 
instance, if you block a computer on a particular network, others who use the 
same network but are blameless might end up using the offending IP address 
at some point and be blocked. Many bloggers discount IP banning, saying 
that it has no real usefulness in today’s mobile world.
Akismet
One anti-spam service is worth a special men­
tion: Automattic Akismet (www.akismet.
com). The Akismet service has been around 
since the latter half of 2005, and it’s one of the 
best spam-filtering systems in the world. Plus, 
it’s very easy to use. While you moderate your 
comments, a simple series of links and buttons 
helps you make quick choices about good and 
bad comments.
Akismet works by running your comments 
through a central data center. The Akismet 
system runs a number of tests each time a user 
submits a comment, and if the comment passes 
all the tests, Akismet automatically posts the 
comment to your site. It holds comments that 
fail the tests in a queue for your review so that 
you can identify any valid comments and post 
them. (Or you can just delete them all without 
going through them.)
The software updates itself and maintains the 
blacklist that it uses, so after you install it on 
your blog, you don’t have to do anything to keep 
it up and running. Akismet is free for personal 
use but requires a monthly fee for commercial 
use. Also, some deals are available for non­
profit organizations.

 Chapter 9: Building Community with Comments
Dealing with Coverage on Other Blogs
You can’t do much about negative blog posts or comments about you on 
other blogs, although many a blogger has stayed awake all night worrying. (It 
doesn’t seem to help.) You can easily post a comment that responds, but you 
may not want to respond when you’re feeling angry and emotional because 
you may post something you would regret.
	
You’re taking part in a public conversation, and free speech means that 
people can openly express their opinions about you, your blog, your opinions, 
your business — you name it. You can find negative criticism hard to take, 
especially when you feel it’s unjustified. Before you send off an angry e-mail 
or post a vicious comment, sit back and take a little time to consider your 
options. If you can be objective, try to understand exactly what the other 
person is criticizing and whether the critic has a point.
Here are four ways that you can handle a case in which another blogger 
posts a negative statement about you or your blog:
	
✓	Point to the negative coverage on your own blog and get some other 
opinions on the issue without taking a position yourself.
	
✓	Ignore the post and comment about it only when someone specifically 
requests your opinion.
	
✓	Post respectful comments on the blog in question and constructively 
add to the conversation there.
	
✓	Counter the criticism, in a respectful manner, on your own blog.
Whichever path you choose, make sure that you deal with the comment in 
a respectful manner. You can easily escalate a conflict online because you 
don’t have to deal with people face to face. The anonymous feeling people 
get when they’re on the Internet can lead them to behave in ways that they 
wouldn’t in person. Try to take the high road as much as possible, if only 
because an uninvolved reader is more likely to see you as right if you handle 
things more courteously than your critic.
In some cases, criticism of an individual or business on a blog has led to legal 
ramifications, from copyright violation to libel. If you feel that the negative 
comments about you online might fall into the legal realm, consult with a 
lawyer about the best course of action.
	
You might not be the only target of criticism: Some bloggers use their blogs 
as a way to publish attacks on everyone, from public figures to private indi­
viduals. Some other bloggers might even attack your readers and ignore you. 
Deal with these kinds of situations quickly and with as much care as you can 
provide. Think of yourself as the referee in a situation that involves personal 
attacks from one member of your audience to another, and look for ways to 
defuse the situation and prevent future occurrences.

E

ver been on a blog and had difficulty figuring out who is writing it? That 
might be intentional, especially if the topic of the blog is sensitive. Many 
bloggers who want to be heard in a public forum prefer to do so without 
using their real names.
Perhaps you are thinking about blogging about politics but hold a position 
where your political views shouldn’t be common knowledge. Maybe you’re a 
survivor of childhood abuse who wants to contribute to current discussion 
and help other adults, but without having your identity become common 
knowledge. You might work for an employer that you believe is engaging in 
unsafe business practices and feel ethically obligated to share that informa­
tion; getting fired would mean you don’t have access to office information 
any longer. Or perhaps you have a personal journal that details your essen­
tially mundane life, but would just prefer for others not to know who you are.
Many bloggers rely on (perceived) anonymity to keep one aspect of their lives 
from becoming attached to the others. However, the nature of the Internet and 
digital identity means that it can be surprisingly easy to connect the dots from 
one Internet service to another. As potential employers, family members, poten­
tial relationship partners, and others research you, they may find information 
you want them to have, mixed right in with information that isn’t appropriate. An 
Internet search on your name might return your risqué Flickr photos in the same 
list of results as your professional resume. Anonymity seems like the answer.
	
Before you start down the path of anonymous blogging, it’s worth really 
asking yourself the question of whether it’s worthwhile to put something 
online if it would cause a problem if it was linked to you. The single best way 
to prevent others from finding out information you want kept private, or infor­
mation you don’t want your name on, is to keep it out of the public eye. And 
let’s be clear: The Internet is as public as it gets.

Please regard this chapter as a resource, guideline, and starting point, and not a 
recipe for guaranteed anonymity. Technology and laws change, and although 
what I say here may help protect your identity, it should not take the place of 
you doing your own research, and of making your own decisions about what to 
publish. This is especially true if you are using this book some time after its pub­
lication, or are outside of North America. Basically, I make no guarantees that 
following this advice means your identity will remain unknown.
Also, this is not meant to protect you from being caught for doing anything 
illegal. Don’t break any laws, and if you do, don’t post anything about it on 
the Internet. Seriously.

The reasons for a decision to blog anonymously may be widely varied, and 
so are the potential consequences of being found out. What this means is 
that not every blogger needs the same level of identity protection. A teenager 
dishing on his friends might not want to get caught, but if he is, he’s unlikely 
to face the risk of criminal prosecution (or worse) as would, say, a political 
activist in a country where free speech is not protected.
Give some thought to the level of protection you need, and to what might 
happen if your identity is exposed. If speaking your mind on your blog puts 
you at risk for jail time, physical harm, or prosecution, you clearly need to 
take the utmost levels of precautions as you go about setting up and publish­
ing to your blog.
Those who choose to blog about topics their employers might object to, 
or even to blog about their employers, clearly also need to be very care­
ful, although the consequences of being identified here are likely to involve 
finances rather than physical safety.
The next question is whether anyone is going to pursue discovering your 
identity. There are also those who might simply prefer to keep some facets 
of their lives separate from others. A soccer mom might prefer that her kids 
don’t stumble across her personal musings on sexuality, for example — but 
in reality her kids aren’t going to go looking for a blog like that, much less 
have access to technology or legal resources to connect the dots.
Having said that, keep in mind that anytime you reveal yourself as the author 
of an anonymous blog, even to a trusted friend, you crack the door open a 
little wider for that information to become public. Many anonymous bloggers 
have been exposed not through complicated technical detective work, but 
because someone chose to leak a secret.

 Chapter 10: Blogging Anonymously
While you’re thinking about risks, consequences, and who might put two and 
two together, pause and give some thought to others who might be harmed if 
your identity was revealed. If you can be identified, and you’ve blogged about 
friends, family, former relationships, employers, and others in unflattering 
ways, or revealed sensitive information about them, you’re putting possible 
consequences into their lives, too. Risks that might be acceptable for you may 
not be so for others, particularly if they are put in harm’s way unknowingly.
	
I recommend you read through this whole chapter before taking any of these 
steps, because I move from low- to high-level precautions; if you decide you 
need to set yourself up at the highest level, some steps described later need to 
be done first.
Going Anonymous
Clearly, you shouldn’t use your own name or photo on your anonymous blog. 
Beyond that, there are still other basic precautions you should take while 
setting up protections for your identity. Most of them are based on good 
common sense.
Establishing a pseudonym
It’s obvious, but I’ll say it anyway: No matter who you are, what your blog is 
about, or what might happen, every single anonymous blogger needs a pseud­
onym. A pseudonym is a fake name, preferably one that doesn’t cleverly sug­
gest your real name, or provide any clues to who you really are. For example, 
“CEOsecretary” isn’t a good pseudonym for that blog you write about how 
much your employer irritates you, but “Fed Up Worker” will do just fine.
	
If you have created an account on a social networking service, or really any 
sort of membership website, you may have been asked to create a username 
to use on that site. It might be tempting to use that nickname on your anony­
mous blog, but don’t do so.
For example, you may have noticed in some of the screenshots in this book, 
that my Gmail address is displayed as supersusie@gmail.com. I use the 
nickname supersusie on many websites, and that means it would be a poor 
choice if I wanted to start an anonymous blog. For one thing, it contains part 
of my actual name! For another, I use this username across many websites 
in association with my real name and e-mail address. All it would take is a 
couple of Internet searches to know that supersusie and Susannah Gardner 
are one and the same person, even if I never used the name Susannah on my 
personal blog.
So, choose a new pseudonym, one you’ve never used before.

Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
Setting up a new e-mail address
The next step in anonymity is to set up a new e-mail address using your pseud­
onym. Whatever blogging service you decide to use, they all require you to 
have an e-mail address in order to get started, and you can’t use an e-mail 
address that is associated with any of your real identifying information.
Create an entirely new e-mail account (don’t use any identifying information 
in the account settings). As well, don’t import your contacts.
There are many free webmail services out there. Ideally, you want to choose 
a service that offers a secure connection, like Gmail (www.gmail.com) or 
RiseUp (www.riseup.net). A secure connection means your visit to the 
e-mail website can’t be listened-in on by technical snoopers. You have a 
secure connection if you can get to the e-mail website prefaced by https:// 
instead of http://.
Choosing passwords
How many times have you used the same password when signing up for a 
new web service? If you’re like me, it’s a bunch! Most people I talk to admit 
that they have one or two passwords they use in rotation, one that might be 
a little more secure than the other, or one that they use whenever there is a 
credit card involved.
Let me tell you a little story: I’m a member of the popular knitting social network 
Ravelry (www.ravelry.com). Now, Ravelry is a great site for knitters — hardly 
a high-value target. They also don’t ask for much personal information and they 
don’t store financial data or other important records. But in June 2011, the site 
was targeted by hackers who managed to break into a server and capture many 
of the Ravelry community usernames and passwords. While the passwords were 
encrypted, Ravelry was concerned that the hackers might be able to crack them. 
They recommended all Ravelry members change their passwords on the site 
and stepped up their security precautions.
But there are larger implications for any Ravelry community member who 
might have used the same username and password on another site. If a hacker 
tried those usernames and passwords on another, more sensitive site, like a 
bank site or a photo sharing site, some of those usernames and passwords 
would probably work. Long story short, choose unique usernames and pass­
words for any service that you really want to protect — like an anonymous 
blog.
	
Ideally, you should choose passwords that contain a variety of lower- and 
uppercase characters, as well as numbers. You can even use some punctua­
tion characters. Don’t choose a password that spells out a word, even if you 
www.it-ebooks.info

197
 Chapter 10: Blogging Anonymously
replace some of the letters with characters or numbers, and definitely don’t 
use a password that is the name or birth date of a family member or pet.
It’s a good idea to change your passwords frequently. It’s also a good idea 
not to write down your passwords or record them anywhere (especially 
on your computer). Of course, none of this does you any good if you can’t 
remember your passwords as a result, so experiment with some set of good 
password practices that still lets you log into your services.
I’m a fan of the PC Tools Secure Password Generator (www.pctools.com/
guides/password), which lets you generate a random set of characters to 
create a truly strong password.
Starting your anonymous blog
Your safest bet to maintain your anonymity is to choose hosted blogging soft­
ware (I talk more about this in Chapter 3) that doesn’t require you to have a 
domain, web hosting, or to buy a license.
Two options are:
	
✓	WordPress.com (www.wordpress.com)
	
✓	Blogger (www.blogger.com)
	
Be sure to sign up using your anonymous e-mail address, and to leave out 
any identifying information in the account information, name of the blog, and 
so on.
	
Be cautious about what sites you include in a blogroll or link to; putting any of 
your friends in your blogroll, or linking to your own non-anonymous blog, is a 
quick trip to outing yourself.
Being time and location aware
One way you might inadvertently give clues about who you are is to suggest 
what time zone you are in based on when you post to your blog. Consider 
changing the times and dates of your posts so that they go live at times when 
you might be asleep or otherwise occupied, but don’t go so far as to never 
post at a time that would be appropriate for your time zone.
Changing the time and date also divorces when you’re online and posting 
from when the post is published, which makes it a little harder to correlate 
Internet access to a specific person. This can help if someone is trying to 
track down your identity by accessing log files of when your computer is on 
the Internet, or when your blog software was accessed.

Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
Approaching Content Cautiously
You are far more likely to be identified because of what you are writing or 
posting than anything else. Be extremely careful about details that provide 
clues to who you are, where you are, what you do, and so on.
Be very cautious about giving specifics. Here are six examples:
	
✓	The number of employees in your workplace
	
✓	Your geographic location
	
✓	Your profession
	
✓	The stores you commonly shop at
	
✓	The names, numbers, breeds, and descriptions of your pets
	
✓	The names of friends and colleagues
Any single detail likely won’t be enough to identify you, but cumulatively 
they may paint the picture for a savvy reader. This becomes a bigger issue 
over time: The longer you blog, the more information about yourself you 
have provided.
Remember that photos are records of a particular time and location, so if 
you put one on your blog that you took, you’re telling the world you were at 
that location at that time. It’s a good idea to remove that photo from your 
computer, your camera card, and certainly you shouldn’t post it anywhere 
else on the Internet. You also want to scrub any meta information out of the 
image itself.
	
When it comes to your subject material, you should be especially careful to 
understand whether you are violating any laws in what you say. For bloggers, 
the main concern is libel. Libel is any seemingly factual statement that is both 
false and damaging to a person’s reputation.
Publishing harmful information about another individual is a good way to 
get them interested in figuring out who you are, so that they can stop you or 
pursue legal action.
Stepping Up Security
Now I talk about the big guns. You have a blog and you really need to make 
sure you aren’t identified as the author. For starters, don’t do anything that 
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

199
 Chapter 10: Blogging Anonymously
involves making a credit card payment, like register a domain name, buy a blog 
software license, or sign up for web hosting. Your credit card information isn’t 
on your blog, but a financial transaction that ties you to the domain of your 
anonymous blog is a quick route to identification.
	
Many of the other precautions involve a fair amount of technical know-how. 
Remember that I am giving you the basics, and use this as a jumping-off point 
to do more research!
Understanding IP addresses
The primary technical consideration for maintaining anonymity online has 
to do with your IP address. An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a 
numeric identifying number assigned to every single device that connects to 
the Internet, from your computer to your smartphone. An IP address identi­
fies the device uniquely, and works like a mailing address to tell other com­
puters how to find that device.
Every time you go online, you leave a history that includes this IP address, 
whether all you do is send an e-mail, or post a comment on a blog. This 
means that if you set up an anonymous blog and the IP address of the device 
you use to post to the blog can be traced to you, the blog can be attributed 
to you as well. In fact, some webmail services even include the IP address as 
part of the header in e-mail messages you send.
An IP address can be permanent — a web server is typically always located 
at the same IP address — or it can be dynamic, which is the case for most 
home computers on the Internet. If you access the Internet via an Internet 
Service Provider, sometimes the IP address is assigned at the time you actu­
ally connect to the service. That means your IP address changes, but it can 
still be traced to the ISP and the right legal pressure can force an ISP to give 
up the records of which customers used what IP addresses when.
	
Curious to know what your IP address is? Visit www.whatismyip.com and 
you see the number at the top of the page.
Clearly, hiding your IP address is necessary for the highest level of identify 
protection. This is not a simple process, but there are ways to do this. The 
resources at the end of this chapter can help, and you can also look into:
	
✓	Anonymizer (www.anonymizer.com)
	
✓	Tor (www.torproject.org)
	
✓	Psiphon (www.psiphon.ca)

Part III: Fitting In and Feeling Good 
Using software safely
Even after you implement a good IP address strategy, there are some other 
important technical ways of protecting yourself. You may not need to do 
all of these, but remember that every additional precaution lessens your 
chances of being identified. Here are eight recommendations:
	
✓	Use a web browser that is up-to-date and known to be conscientious 
about security holes. Mozilla Firefox is a good choice; Internet Explorer 
is not.
	
✓	Run your browser in Privacy Mode (Private Browsing in Safari).
	
✓	Install and regularly run antivirus software on your computer.
	
✓	Consider encrypting your hard drive. TrueCrypt (www.truecrypt.org) 
is a good open source tool for Windows and Mac.
	
✓	If you write your posts on your computer, delete them from your com­
puter and use software intended to permanently remove files from your 
computer. The Mac makes this easy — simply choose Secure Empty 
Trash from the Finder menu. On the PC, look into installing software like 
Eraser (http://security.tacticaltech.org/glossary#Eraser) 
or Ccleaner (www.piriform.com/CCLEANER).
	
✓	After you go online to post to your blog, make sure to clear your cook­
ies, passwords, and browser history. The technique for doing this will 
vary depending on which browser you are using, so be sure to read 
through the documentation provided to make sure you know how to 
accomplish these tasks. Clearing your history means that your computer 
is clean if others use it or it is lost. You should also do this if you use a 
public computer.
	
✓	Be cautious in how you participate in commenting on blogs, using 
forums, or signing up for services using your anonymous identity. Many 
of these services collect IP addresses when you post to them, or when 
you sign up.
	
✓	Blogging in public is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, using a 
publicly available computer — in a library or Internet cafe — means 
muddying the waters in terms of who posted to a blog from that com­
puter. On the other hand, if you’re in public, others can likely view your 
screen, you yourself can be seen, and you don’t know what software 
might be on the computer you are using.

 Chapter 10: Blogging Anonymously
Keeping up
Keep up to date on the technical issues involved. Don’t assume you’ve set 
things up that will protect you permanently. The Internet is a very fluid place: 
Technology and tools change constantly, and having all your bases covered 
today is no guarantee that you will be safe tomorrow. For instance, simply 
upgrading your browser to the latest version has implications for security!
This goes for legal issues around anonymity as well. Know the laws in your 
country, or those that apply to you, so that you can be deliberate about 
what laws you violate (if any), or what the consequences might be if you 
are identified.
Resources
Above all, don’t take my word for any of this! You should do your own 
research so that you can blog anonymously with confidence. Here are five of 
the resources I used to research this topic:
	
✓	A Technical Guide to Anonymous Blogging, TechSoup (www.techsoup.
org/learningcenter/internet/page6042.cfm)
	
✓	How to Blog Safely (About Work or Anything Else), Electronic Freedom 
Foundation (www.eff.org/wp/blog-safely)

Working with Photos
In This Chapter
▶	Getting set up with a digital camera and editing software
▶	Making or collecting images to use on your blog
▶	Using Picasa to edit your photos
▶	Putting Flickr photos into your blog posts
I

t’s a fact: People love photos! You can increase your readership and 
decrease your writing time by including photos in your blog posts or 
putting photo badges (code you can place on your blog that shows off your 
photos) into your sidebar. Many bloggers have discovered that including a 
photo in a blog post, even if the photo is only tangentially related to the post, 
ensures that more people read the post than read entries without photos.
If you already have a digital camera and photo-editing software, you have the 
tools at hand to start putting photos into your blog quickly. But if you’re new 
to photography, this chapter also includes information about choosing a digi­
tal camera or software.
Putting graphics on the web isn’t incredibly hard to do, and today’s wonder­
ful photo-sharing websites make posting photos online quick and easy. In 
fact, if you already have a Flickr account that you use to share your digital 
photos, you can jump right to the section “Inserting Photos into Blog Posts 
with Flickr,” later in this chapter. You’ll be pleased as punch to find out how 
easily you can do it.
Getting Equipped
Today, digital cameras are quite inexpensive, and using one can expedite the 
process of putting your photos online. Most digital cameras can take photo­
graphs in file formats that you can use on the web with no further processing, 
but you can also pick up software that helps you convert your photos to the 
right format quite quickly. Some cameras shoot photos in particular formats, 
some of which are not web-compatible, so you have to convert them into 
web-friendly formats like JPG and GIF. (I cover the more nitty-gritty details 
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

206
Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
of web-compatible file formats and photo editing in the section “Editing 
Photos,” later in this chapter; if you’re in the market for a camera, make sure 
that you know in what format or formats the camera captures pictures.)
The ingredients to getting photos onto your website are
	
✓	A camera, preferably a digital camera
	
✓	A way to get your photos from your camera onto your computer, such 
as a USB cable or scanner
	
✓	Image-editing software that can help you crop, resize, and touch up your 
photos
	
✓	A photo-sharing service or blog software that has file-upload tools
The following sections cover these items in detail.
Picking a digital camera
Digital cameras come in all kinds of price ranges and with tons of different 
features. When you take a photograph, the image is saved on a storage card 
or small hard drive, and many cameras have a nice preview screen that lets 
you see the results of your photography right away.
When you need your photos, you can remove the storage card from your 
camera, and then insert it into the card reader hooked to your computer, or 
even into a printer. You may want to have a removable storage card if you 
plan to take a lot of pictures because you can easily carry several cards with 
you, switching them out when you fill one. Some cameras can also connect 
directly to your computer.
	
Digital cameras usually come with several quality settings that determine the 
resolution of your image and the sizes that look good when you print your 
photograph. If you choose higher-quality settings, the resolution is higher, and 
the file sizes are also larger. This means fewer images fit on your storage card, 
but the resulting photos look better, print more sharply, and can be resized 
more easily than lower-quality images. Web images are usually compressed so 
that the file sizes are reasonable for visitors to download, but taking images at 
higher-quality settings (which usually means that the resolution is also higher 
than is needed for the web) gives you more options down the line and better 
looking photos even after compression.
Today, even relatively inexpensive digital cameras can take high-quality 
images suitable for use in almost any medium, so the real challenge is to pick 
a camera that suits your picture-taking style.
Be realistic about how you plan to use the camera and how comfortable you 
are with it when you look at the options:

 Chapter 11: Working with Photos
	
✓	Digital SLRs: If you’re a professional photographer or a dedicated ama­
teur, you likely want a high-end dSLR camera. But these cameras are 
quite large, which makes them awkward to carry and use unobtrusively 
on a day-to-day basis. They can be expensive, too.
	
✓	Low-end point-and-shoots: If you’re a photography amateur, super light­
weight cameras can get a lot of admiring glances. But they might lack 
important features, and their tiny size might also make them hard to use 
and hold steady.
	
✓	Midrange: If you’re not a professional photographer but want more than 
just the basics that low-end cameras provide, look for a camera in the 
midprice range. These cameras come in a range of styles and sizes, and 
with a wide range of features designed for use by completely inexperi­
enced to professional photographers.
	
✓	Mobile cameras (phone cameras): These days, most phones come with 
cameras built-in — convenient, but the photos may not look as wonder­
ful as those taken with higher-end cameras.
Start your search by visiting CNET (www.cnet.com) and looking at the 
product reviews written by CNET editors and readers. Reading through the 
reviews can help you understand the options and features, and it can give 
you a feel for the price ranges that include the features you want.
With some CNET recommendations in mind, head for a camera or good elec­
tronics store to test-drive some cameras. You need to feel physically com­
fortable handling and using any camera that you purchase, regardless of how 
well it was reviewed online.
Another website worth using for camera research is Digital Photography 
Review (www.dpreview.com). It highlights a collection of digital cameras 
with lots of detail about different brands and models. This site shows exam­
ple photos from most of the cameras along with reviews from readers.
Choosing photo-editing software
You need to find a program to help you edit and organize your photos. You 
have loads of options, at all pricing levels. In fact, your computer might have 
come packaged with image-editing software, or the digital camera that you 
purchase might include software.
When you’re looking for image-editing software with the ultimate goal of get­
ting your images online, consider these criteria:
	
✓	File formats: You need to be able to create images in the right format for 
display on the web. These formats are JPG, GIF, and PNG. These formats 
also allow you compress the file size of your images for the web.
www.it-ebooks.info

208
Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
	
✓	Standard editing tools: At a minimum, you need image-editing software 
that allows you to resize, crop, rotate, and adjust brightness and con­
trast in your photos. These tools should be quick and easy to use.
	
✓	Organizing tools: Look for software that helps you keep track of your 
images by using thumbnail previews, naming schemes, and search, espe­
cially if you take a lot of photos.
	
✓	Photo sharing: You don’t need a program that integrates with the blog­
ging tool that you use or with a photo-sharing service such as Flickr, but 
it can speed up the time it takes to post a photo online. I discuss insert­
ing photos with Flickr in the section “Inserting Photos into Blog Posts 
with Flickr,” later in this chapter.
	
With these ideas in mind, don’t forget to think about whether you want an 
image editor that can do more than just get photos into shape for online pub­
lication. If you plan to print photographs, be sure you look for photo-editing 
software that has good tools for printing.
I cover two software programs (Picasa and iPhoto) in the following sections. 
Other image-editing programs also work well for touching up and formatting 
photographs:
	
✓	Adobe Photoshop Elements: Under $100; version 9 and higher support 
Windows and Mac (previous versions support only Windows); www.
adobe.com/products/photoshop-elements.html. This program is 
suitable for users who have the patience to figure out how to use a full-
featured program but don’t need professional features, such as the capa­
bility to produce color separations for high-end professional printers. 
Photoshop Elements is a great compromise between basic and high-end 
software.
	
✓	Adobe Photoshop Lightroom: $299; Mac and Windows; www.adobe.
com/products/photoshoplightroom. This software is intended 
specifically for photography. Serious amateur photographers and pro­
fessionals find this program valuable for managing large collections of 
photographs.
	
✓	Adobe Photoshop: $699; Mac and Windows; www.adobe.com/products/
photoshop. For anyone who isn’t a designer or very serious photogra­
pher, Adobe Photoshop can be overkill. But this program can make your 
photos look especially great if you are willing to pay the premium price. 
Advanced editing tools and more control over the quality of the images 
you are using for your blog put this package heads and shoulders above 
Adobe Elements’ more basic toolset.
	
✓	Adobe Fireworks: $299; Mac and Windows; www.adobe.com/products/
fireworks. Although you can use Fireworks to process photos, it’s 
really intended to be a web graphics production tool. If you have it 
already, use it, but if you’re looking over your options, I recommend 
some of the other products in this list for photo editing.

Picasa
http://picasa.google.com
Picasa, from Google, is priced competitively (it’s free) and works especially 
well for photographers who want to put photos online. It has highly devel­
oped organizational tools, allowing you to do everything from automatically 
importing and naming photos from your camera when you hook it up to your 
computer, to quickly labeling and tagging your photos, to rating good photos, 
to creating photo albums.
Picasa has good editing tools, but they sacrifice some fine control in favor 
of being easy to use. You can crop, straighten horizons, fix red-eye issues, 
adjust color and contrast, and make other edits to your photos easily.
However, the photo-sharing tools set Picasa apart. You can use tools to 
e-mail photos, get them onto the web, create online slideshows, and put 
photo collections onto other devices. You can also print photos quite easily, 
and create slideshows with music and captions.
Picasa (shown in Figure 11-1) is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
In the section “Editing Photos,” later in this chapter, I walk you through using 
Picasa’s simple editing tools.

iPhoto
www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto
If you’re a Mac user, you have a great image-editing program in Apple’s 
iPhoto (see Figure 11-2). It gives you all the basic tools for cropping, straight­
ening, adjusting color and brightness, and resizing. Plus, you can dabble with 
fun effects, and increase or decrease highlights and shadows in your photos.
iPhoto also comes with excellent organizing tools: You can categorize, tag, 
caption, and title your photos quickly and easily, and the simple search inter­
face helps you find old photos.
You can use iPhoto for more than publishing your photos on your own blog. 
Use iPhoto to publish to the MobileMe web service, put up slideshows and 
albums, and share your photos with groups of friends and family.
You can also use iPhoto to print a real photo album, calendar, cards, and indi­
vidual prints. iPhoto frequently comes packaged on new Macintosh computers, 
but if you don’t have it, head to the Apple Store (http://store.apple.com) 
and buy a copy of iLife. It includes iPhoto and other digital applications.

Choosing a photo-sharing tool
When you’re ready to put your photos online, regardless of whether you 
ultimately want to include images on your blog, you have plenty of options. 
Photo-sharing websites have become full-fledged members of the Web 2.0 
movement, offering friends lists, tagging, and other sophisticated tools.
The media darling of photo-sharing sites is definitely Flickr (www.flickr.
com). For avid photographers, Flickr has nearly replaced the need to have 
a blog at all because many of the best blogging tools are integrated into the 
Flickr service.
On Flickr, you can
	
✓	Create a list of friends whose photos you want to follow.
	
✓	Upload and organize photos by using tags (keywords), sets, and 
collections.
	
✓	Start groups around a visual theme and add your photos to other 
groups.
	
✓	Set privacy controls to dictate who can see your photos.
	
✓	Use your photos to create books, prints, calendars, business cards, 
DVDs, and stamps.
	
✓	Post photos in your account and receive comments (see Figure 11-3).
	
✓	Create slideshows of your photos.
	
✓	Upload, tag, and share video.
	
✓	Browse other members’ photos and leave comments.
Basic Flickr accounts are free for 300MB worth of photos and two videos 
each month. You can display only your most recent 200 photos, though. 
Pro accounts cost $24.95 a year and receive unlimited uploading and image 
display.
In the section “Inserting Photos into Blog Posts with Flickr,” later in this 
chapter, I show you how to put Flickr to work for you when you want to add 
images to blog posts.
Flickr isn’t alone in offering photo sharing online; it just happens to be my 
favorite. You can also upload your photos to Photobucket (www.photo
bucket.com), Shutterfly (www.shutterfly.com), SmugMug (www.smug
mug.com), Snapfish (www.snapfish.com), and Webshots (www.webshots.
com), among others.

Whatever service you choose, look for tools that can make your life easier 
when it comes to putting your photos on your blog. For example, look for ser­
vices that
	
✓	Integrate well with the camera you own, and/or with your mobile phone 
if you use it for photography.

Choosing Visuals for Your Blog
Far be it from me to tell you how to take photographs — I’m a rank amateur 
when it comes to photography. But I can give you tips on taking photos that 
you can use for a new blog post, which I do in the following sections.
Taking photos
Readers respond well to photos: Visitors are more likely to read posts that 
have photos than those that don’t. And, most of the time, your photos and

 Chapter 11: Working with Photos
other images don’t have to have a strong relationship to what you’re blogging 
about. In fact, they can go off on a tangential topic or idea.
You can’t always throw unrelated images onto your blog, though. After all, 
if you’re blogging about your new mobile phone, go with a picture of that 
phone. And if you’re talking about your recent trip to Peru — well, you 
need some pictures from your trip. But if you’re just pontificating or talk­
ing about a favorite book, think about adding a photograph as more of an 
accessory.
Bloggers often add pictures to posts that just need a little zing, as on the 
Foodists blog (www.foodists.ca) in the post shown in Figure 11-4. Blog 
posts about cooking and restaurants are seriously enlivened by the addition 
of beautiful food photos. Who doesn’t salivate at the sight of a beautifully 
prepared dessert?
If you want to take photographs to put on your blog, keep your eyes open all 
the time for visuals that inspire or interest you. You don’t have to be a rocket 
scientist to find good picture subjects, but you do need to be thinking about 
your blog and your camera more often than you might normally. In fact, 
some bloggers find that carrying a camera with them actually helps them find 
things to blog about and illustrate regular blog posts.

Here are four tips for taking photos for your blog:
	
✓	Carry your camera with you when you leave the house, even if you’re 
just running down to the grocery store.
	
✓	Keep fresh batteries in your camera so that when you need to use it, 
it isn’t dead. If possible, keep a second set of batteries in your camera 
pouch. (By the way, digital cameras quickly suck up battery juice, so 
you really should buy rechargeable batteries, reducing the impact on 
both your pocketbook and the environment.)
	
✓	Don’t worry too much about taking the perfect picture. Just take the pic­
ture! Photo editing and good cropping can salvage many a bad shot, but 
they can’t help you if you never even pushed the shutter button.
	
✓	Take photos of the people you meet and talk to, and your friends. Be 
sure to ask them whether you can use their photos on your blog. Then, 
when you blog about going to a movie with Bill, you have a photo of Bill 
to include.
Using art from other sources
One nice thing about the web: You can find tons and tons of photos and 
other images, graphics, and visuals out there to inspire you. Some bloggers 
have taken advantage of this vast offering by including some of those great 
visuals in their blog posts. Photos attract readers’ attention better than a few 
paragraphs of text. You may decide to use photos on your blog, as long as 
you have the rights to republish those images.
Here are three tips when you need images other than your own:
	
✓	Check the public domain: Some materials are designated public domain 
works, which means anyone can use them for any purpose, although 
you must still give the author credit. If you’re interested in featuring 
public-domain and licensed images on your blog, do a search for public 
domain photos on your favorite search engine. You can investigate a 
number of good resources.
	
	In the United States, anything published before 1923 is considered 
public domain, but other countries don’t necessarily have the same 
policy.
	
✓	Search through Creative Commons: By using the Creative Commons 
licensing tool, you can look for works that authors have licensed for 
republication. To find additional works that you can use, visit http://
search.creativecommons.org and search by using keywords that 
describe the material you’re looking for. (Creative Commons licenses 
allow blog authors to make known their copyright wishes for the copy­
ing to their blog content.)

 Chapter 11: Working with Photos
	
✓	Ask for permission: If you see something that you like and want to use, 
but it’s protected by full copyright, consider simply asking whether 
you can use it. Many photographers, especially those who don’t make a 
living selling their work, willingly let you use their work, especially if you 
give them credit!
	
Many of the photos on the Flickr photo-sharing site (www.flickr.com) have 
been licensed for use on other websites and blogs. When you’re looking at a 
photo on Flickr, check the copyright information on the right side of the page.
Editing Photos
As long as you have the rights to do so, you can edit any photo. In general, 
you can do what you like to photos that you acquire from a public domain 
website or a picture that you take yourself. Photos that you obtain permis­
sion to use, or use under a special license, may have restrictions when it 
comes to making edits. Be sure you understand what you’re allowed to do. 
In the following sections, I show you how to do some of the most common 
photo-editing tasks using Picasa.
The most common photo-editing tasks are resizing, cropping, adjusting light­
ing and contrast, and adjusting the color of a photo. For each of the following 
tasks, you should have Picasa running and have a photo available to edit.
Getting photos into Picasa
Before you can edit a photo, you need to get it into Picasa. Follow these 
steps:
	
1.	With Picasa installed on your computer and running, connect your 
camera to your computer.
	
	 You can also put your camera’s storage card into a card reader or printer, if 
that’s how you usually move photos from your camera to your computer.
	
2.	Click the Import button in Picasa.
	
	 Picasa loads the Import screen.
	
3.	Use the Import From menu to select the device containing your 
photos, or identify a folder already on your computer.
	
	 Picasa connects to the device, and displays the available photos.
	
4.	 Select the photo or photos you want to import, and click Import 
Selected. Or, click Import All to bring the photos into Picasa.
	
	 Picasa imports the image(s) and displays them in the Library.

Cropping a photo
Cropping a photo allows you to remove unneeded or unattractive parts of an 
image. For example, if you take a picture of a group of friends and then want 
to include a photo of just one of the individuals in your blog post, you can 
crop out the other people in the image.
To crop a photo that you’ve imported into Picasa, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open Picasa and, in the Picasa Library, double-click the photo that 
you want to edit.
	
	 The Editing screen opens.
	
2.	Click the Crop button at the top of the Basic Fixes tab.
	
3.	Select whether you want to crop to a preset size or crop manually.
	
	 If you’re cropping to a preset size, simply select the size that you want 
to use from the menu.
	
4.	Use your mouse to click and drag over the area that you want to retain 
in your photo, as shown in Figure 11-5.
	
	 While you click and drag, the area that will be cropped out of your photo 
appears slightly grayed out, leaving the portion that will be retained at 
the original brightness.
	
Figure 11-5: 
Cropping 
manually 
lets you 
choose a 
specific 
area that 
you want to 
keep in your 
photo.

	 If you want to start over, click Reset to remove the cropping box that 
you created. If you don’t want to crop after all, click the Cancel button to 
exit the Crop tool.
	
5.	Click the Preview button and check out how the cropped photo will 
look.
	
6.	Click the Apply button to crop your photo.
	
	 Picasa displays the cropped photo.
Adjusting brightness and contrast
Sometimes, despite your best efforts, photos end up looking too dark or 
too light. By using photo-editing software such as Picasa, you get a second 
chance because you can adjust brightness and contrast.
To adjust the brightness and contrast, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open Picasa and, in the Library, double-click the photo that you want 
to edit.
	
	 The Editing screen opens.
	
2.	Click the Tuning tab on the left side of the application.
	
3.	On the Tuning tab, drag the slider bar below Highlights to adjust the 
brightness of the image.
	
	 Picasa adjusts the image being displayed while you move the bar.
	
	 If you’re lightening the photo, watch the brightest parts of your photo to 
make sure that they don’t get too bright, losing information you want in 
the photo. If you’re bringing down lightness, watch the darker areas of 
your photo so that you don’t end up with too much black in your photo. 
Let your eyes be the judge of a well-adjusted image.
	
You can have Picasa make an educated guess about the brightness settings 
that you need by clicking the Auto Contrast button in the Basic Fixes tab. Click 
the Undo Auto Contrast button if you don’t like the results.
Adjusting color
Color in photos frequently needs a little adjusting. I’ve taken too many green­
ish photos in fluorescent lights! With a little help from photo-editing software 
such as Picasa, I can turn my friends’ skin back to normal colors.
To adjust the color of a photo, follow these steps:

Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
	
1.	Open Picasa and, in the Library, double-click the photo that you want 
to edit.
	
	 The Editing screen opens.
	
2.	Click the Tuning tab on the left side of the application.
	
3.	On the Tuning tab, drag the slider bar below Color Temperature to 
adjust the color tone of the picture.
	
	 Color can be tricky to adjust. As a good rule, look for an element in 
the photograph that you know should be a particular color, and then 
adjust the overall color to make that element look right. Then, look at 
the overall picture and adjust, if necessary. Elements that you can use 
for the purpose include eye color, skin color, sky, and other consistent 
elements.
	
You can have Picasa make an educated guess about the color settings that 
you need by clicking the Auto Color button in the Basic Fixes tab. Click the 
Undo Auto Color button if you don’t like the results.
Optimizing a photo for the web
Digital cameras commonly store photos as high-resolution files suitable for 
print, but that high-resolution is more than you need for display on a blog or 
website. And you probably don’t want to make your blog visitors download a 
great big image when they don’t need to. Usually, you compress the file size 
of your image when you plan to put it on your blog.
	
If you plan to upload your image to Flickr, don’t worry about compressing the 
image when you export. Flickr can handle large files and can resize the photo 
for you.
You may also need to change the image’s dimensions in order to fit it into 
your blog layout, or even create a thumbnail version.
	
In Picasa, compressing — also called setting the image quality — and resiz­
ing a photo actually occur when you export the image. You don’t need to deal 
with these issues until after you do all your other edits. When you export, you 
create a file that you can upload to your blog, so don’t skip this step!
To resize and export an image, select the photo in Picasa that you want to 
export and follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the Export button at the bottom of the Picasa window.
	
	 The Export to Folder dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 11-6.
	
2.	Click the Browse button and select the location on your computer 
where you want to save the file that you’re exporting.

3.	To resize your image, click the Resize To radio button below Image 
Size Options and enter a pixel width that you want to use for your 
new image in the text box below Resize To.
	
	 You may need to experiment to find the right pixel width for your partic­
ular blog design, but a good rule is to choose a pixel width of 400 pixels 
because many blog templates tend to hover around this width.
	
	 You can also use the slider bar to the right of the pixel text box to 
change the width.
	
4.	Select an Image Quality setting from the Image Quality drop-down list.
	
	 For web graphics, Normal is a good setting to choose because it has a 
good balance between image size and file size.
	
5.	Click Export.
	
	 Picasa exports your image to the folder you chose in Step 2.

Inserting Photos into Blog 
Posts with Flickr
If you have a photo prepared for use on your blog, you’re ready to upload it 
to the web. You can take two approaches to get your image online:
	
✓	Uploading directly to your blog: If your blog software supports it, you 
might be able to upload your image directly into your blog post. In 
Blogger, for instance, you can use the Image Upload button in the New 
Post interface to upload an image. You can read more about this process 
in Blogger in Chapter 4.

✓	Other online sharing sites: If your blog software doesn’t include an 
image-uploading tool, you can upload your photos to an online shar­
ing site, such as Flickr. You can then add your photo to your post from 
that site.
Follow these steps to add photos to Flickr:
	
1.	Log into your Flickr account and select Upload Photos & Video on the 
home page.
	
	 Alternatively, click the arrow next to the You navigation button and 
select Upload Photos and Videos from the menu that appears.
	
	 The Upload to Flickr page appears.
	
2.	Click the Choose Photos and Videos link.
	
	 A Select File dialog box opens, showing files on your computer.
	
3.	Navigate to the location of the photo that you want to upload, select 
the photo, and click Open.
	
	 Your photo goes into an upload queue on the Flickr page.
	
	 If you want to upload more photos, click the Add More link and add 
those photos to the queue, as well.
	
4.	Make sure that your Privacy setting is Public so that readers can view 
your photo when you put it on your blog.
	
5.	Click the Upload Photos and Videos button.
	
	 Flickr displays a progress bar and notifies you when it has fully 
uploaded your photo.
	
6.	Click the Add a Description link.
	
	 The images you’ve just uploaded will appear and you can now add tags, 
descriptions, and titles.
	
7.	Give your photo a title, description, and tags that describe it in the 
text boxes provided.
	
8.	Click the Save button.
	
	 Flickr adds your new photo(s) to your photo page. After you’ve com­
pleted your upload, you are sent back to your main photostream.
	
9.	On your photo page, click the photo that you just uploaded.
	
10.	Select the right-hand sharing menu above the photo, as shown in 
Figure 11-7.
	
	 To post your photos directly from Flickr onto Facebook, Twitter, 
Tumblr, or Blogger, select the appropriate icon and skip the remaining 
steps. Flickr shows you the starting point for configuring the connection 
between Flickr and your blog. Have the web address for your blog’s pub­
lishing interface, your username, and password ready.

Flickr uploading tools
There are four ways to upload your photos to 
Flickr: You can use the method described in 
this chapter, download the Flickr Uploadr tool 
and install it on your computer, use a plug-in 
for iPhoto, or upload via e-mail. If you upload 
via e-mail, don’t forget that you can use your 
mobile phone to e-mail pictures directly onto 
your Flickr photostream.

B

y adding podcasts — either audio or video files that you publish on the 
Internet for people to download and listen to or view — to your blog, 
you reach a wider audience and reach your audience in different locations: 
People might listen to you while they drive or commute, or they might watch 
your videos on their televisions or their iPods.
The production process for a podcast is (in theory) simple: You go out into 
the world, record a video or some audio, edit it on your computer, and then 
upload the files to your blog for release onto the Internet. Your blog’s readers 
then download the files, and they can still leave comments and interact with 
your blog in the usual way.
Intrigued? Podcasts are attracting a whole new audience to the blogosphere. 
With the creation of improved software and mobile devices that can consume 
these kinds of media, you might want to seriously consider adding podcast­
ing to your blog.

Deciding to Podcast
Podcasts come in all flavors. You can find personal podcasts, technical pod­
casts, sports reports, music samples, recorded social gatherings, previously 
recorded radio broadcasts, book reviews, and audio books. If you can think 
of a topic, you can probably find a podcast for it.

Knit Picks (www.knitpicks.com) is a knitting yarn and supplies company 
that offers a regular podcast about knitting activities, techniques, books, 
and guest interviews in an informative and entertaining mix. The Knit Picks 
podcast page (http://knitpicks.com/cfBlog/author.cfm/Knit%20
Picks%20Podcast) is shown in Figure 12-1.
Blogs and podcasts can look very similar; the main difference is that a pod­
cast entry contains a media file that the consumer can download, either by 
directly accessing the website or by subscribing to a syndicated blog feed 
(also known as the RSS feed). See the section “Delivering your podcasts,” 
later in this chapter, for more information about your options.
Many bloggers who want to podcast don’t because of the learning curve 
to build and maintain a podcast. As wonderful as podcasts can be, writing, 
recording, uploading, hosting, and promoting one requires a higher level 
of technical proficiency than written blog posts do. However, you may find 
figuring out how to work podcasts worth it if you think they can help grow 
your audience, enhance your blog content, or improve and expand your 
blogging skills. In the following sections, you can take a closer look at the 
advantages of podcasting and figure out how to choose between audio and

 Chapter 12: Starting a Podcast
Reaching a wider audience
Podcasting can help you reach a different audience. Many people like to read 
and enjoy taking in a well-written blog post. However, some blog readers 
enjoy listening to what you have to say as an audio recording. Other blog 
followers like to watch, rather than read, your blog post — especially if you 
have a compelling voice or are more photogenic than average. (I’ve been told 
I have a face for radio.)
Also, some of the things that you want to talk about on your blog might work 
better as an audio recording, rather than as a text post, such as interviews, 
soundscapes, or special events. And video is even more powerful: You can 
show off much more of your personality than you can by using just a text 
blog, and you can demonstrate things that you might find difficult or impos­
sible to convey with just words.
Podcasting in ancient times
In 2003, a number of bloggers thought it would 
be interesting to record their thoughts out loud 
and then publish the audio, usually as MP3 
files, through their blogs. Some of those blog­
gers started releasing audio blog entries on a 
regular basis. What happened next was a bit 
of a surprise. Because of the rising popular­
ity of MP3 players, such as Apple’s iPod, the 
audience for these podcasts grew extremely 
quickly. And thanks to RSS feeds, listeners 
could easily retrieve and download the latest 
recordings. People from all over the world 
started listening, recording, and publishing their 
own audio blogs. Several audio blogs became 
popular enough to gain some notice within the 
mainstream media. A hidden audience had 
been discovered.
In fact, most people believe the word podcast 
comes from the Apple iPod device, a popular 
MP3 player that can store and play podcasts 
and music. This belief comes close, but it isn’t 
the whole truth. Podcasts arose at the same 
time that Apple’s device came on the scene, 
and bloggers conceived the name podcast to 
echo the idea that people could listen to these 
audio files on the go by using a hand-held 
device. But many devices could play the files, 
and in fact, people listen to most podcasts on 
a computer, not an MP3 player. Some say the 
word comes from a combination of the acronym 
pod (pod standing for portable-on-demand) and 
the word broadcast, but this meaning evolved 
after the word itself, probably in response to 
Apple’s attempts in 2005 to try to restrict the 
commercial use of the word pod.
Although some bloggers were also experiment­
ing with video in 2003, it took until 2005 for vid­
eocasting to really start to gain traction. Two 
technological shifts helped make this happen. 
iTunes, the program most people used to sub­
scribe to podcasts, started supporting video; 
YouTube, the video-sharing site, made upload­
ing and sharing video a much more common 
online activity.

Think about when and where people might play your podcast and use that 
knowledge to help focus your entries.
Choosing between audio and video
If you’re ready to take the plunge into the production of a podcast, you need 
to decide what format you want to use. Both audio and video require special­
ized skills to produce.
	
Your level of technical competence and comfort can determine what medium 
you choose. You need to consider what type of podcast fits with your blog’s 
audience — don’t use videocasting, for example, if your blog targets those 
who use low-bandwidth connections.
Here are a few tips that can help you decide what type of podcast to use:
	
✓	Audio:
 
• Easier to produce than video because of a larger availability of 
open source software. Most software for professional video editing 
is expensive.
 
• Easier and generally quicker to edit than video.
 
• More portable than video. Fewer portable devices are designed to 
deal with video than with audio.
 
• Less of a space hog than video, making audio files less expensive 
to store on a web host than video files.
	
✓	Video:
 
• More compelling. The visual and auditory components combined 
are more likely to keep a viewer from becoming distracted.
 
• You can make video shorter than audio. Audiences likely feel satis­
fied with a 2–4-minute video podcast, whereas they might want a 
much longer audio podcast.
 
• Gives you more visual elements to work with — both when you’re 
designing your blog and in individual entries.
 
• Has more related sites online where you can upload and share files.
 
• Requires the viewer’s attention, whereas people can listen to audio 
podcasts while completing other tasks. You can listen to an 
audio podcast while driving to work, for example.
	
Video and audio files can get very large. When you upload them to your web 
server, you fill up your available disk space more quickly than you do if you 
upload only text and photos. Also, distributing audio and video requires more 
bandwidth. Keep an eye on your disk space and bandwidth usage so that you

aren’t hit with unexpected overage charges. Ask your web host how to keep 
tabs on those elements, any fees that you may accrue, and whether you need 
more space and bandwidth.
If video is the medium of your choice, be sure to read Chapter 13 for tips and 
tools specific to video production.
Planning Your Podcast
To create a podcast, you first need the desire to make it the best experience 
for the listeners that you can. If you aren’t having fun, it shows in the final 
result. Remember, even if you find your very first podcast a little frustrating, 
it gets easier.
Here are a few key ingredients that you need for a good podcast:
	
✓	Planning what you’ll say: You can make a single podcast, like a blog 
entry, about anything, so have a clearly defined topic before you start. 
Some podcasters write a script for every podcast that they record. 
Although you may find a script is overkill for you, jotting down a few 
notes or creating an outline to follow can help you streamline the cre­
ation process. You can find a list to help you brainstorm topics and the 
flow of your podcast later in this section.
	
✓	Finding your voice: You need to establish the tone of the piece before 
you go forward. How will the format of your overall podcast determine 
how you shoot or record it? Do you want to use some kind of traditional 
show format, or do you want to improvise the entire program each time? 
Taking these kinds of questions into account when you’re planning your 
first podcast can help you make your program a success.
	
✓	Timing: Technically speaking, you can use as much or as little time as 
you want in your podcast. You may find, however, that you get a better 
end product when you give yourself limits, rather than chattering on 
about your favorite color or a funny thing your cat did when you really 
should be getting to the point of your recording session. Think about 
how much time you can reasonably expect your audience to give you, 
and target that length for your podcasts. In general, podcasts range from 
a few minutes to an hour. Also, make sure that you have enough time to 
record the entire podcast in the same location so that you don’t have 
awkward changes in the background noise, which can distract your lis­
tener or viewer.
	
✓	Recording conditions: When you want to record anything, you need 
to take into account environmental considerations before you hit the 
Record button. Is the environment you’re in quiet enough? Background 
noise from fans or computers may annoy the listeners! For video, 
do you have sufficient lighting to produce watchable video? Try to

eliminate distractions, such as phones ringing or people walking by. 
And if you can, do some test recording that you can listen to or watch 
so that you know what the quality of the final product will be before 
you record your entire podcast.
	
Blogging in writing is relatively easy in comparison to recording a podcast, 
and you can also more easily hide your inexperience in a text blog because 
you can rewrite and edit before posting. Although you can edit audio and 
video, removing stuttered speech or inappropriate facial expressions is harder 
than revising text in a blog post. The good news is that practice can help elimi­
nate awkward moments.
	
If you get stuck thinking about a podcast topic or format, ask your readers for 
suggestions. Even if only five or ten readers respond, you can get some good 
ideas and direction.
Here’s a short list of podcast ideas that have been successful for other pod­
casters. Use this list to spark your creativity to find other topics that interest 
you:
	
✓	One-on-one interviews: Fascinating people in your neighborhood are 
just waiting to get on your podcast — especially people involved in a 
cause, an organization, or a business. Discover more about your family’s 
background or the adventures of your friends. See who in your acquain­
tance might fit the theme and direction of your podcast.
	
✓	Show your expertise: Show off what you know and share your knowledge 
with others — maybe even show your audience how to do something.
	
✓	Soundscapes: You can find fascinating sounds all around you that you 
can document. Record yourself walking through a forest or park. Make 
some observations about your surroundings, describe each sound, and 
explain why it’s important to you. Remember, what’s ordinary for you 
(waves at the beach, a passing train, construction noise, or a barn owl) 
might fascinate someone living on the other side of the country or the 
world.
	
✓	Events: A performance at your local coffeehouse, a city hall meeting, 
or a surprise party all might make for an interesting podcast. Make 
sure to get permission before recording or publishing a podcast of 
an event.
	
✓	Discussions: General discussions in social settings can reveal some 
great conversations. Take your recorder along to your next BBQ or eve­
ning social, and direct the conversation along a theme or idea.

 Chapter 12: Starting a Podcast
If you take the time to plan out what things you want to share with your 
subscribers, you can make your podcast happen. With a recording device, a 
plan, and maybe someone else to talk to (although, not entirely necessary!), 
you can have a complete podcast episode in no time.
Assessing the Tools
Making your podcast requires a bit more than your fingers and a computer 
keyboard. Podcasts require recording equipment for audio and video. Here’s 
what you’re looking at:
	
✓	Computer: You need a computer of some kind. You can use a desktop or a 
laptop, although laptops are more flexible and allow you to edit on-the-go. 
The computer must be able to handle editing audio files and, more impor­
tantly, video files. Video is a computer-intensive medium and requires a 
computer with a lot of power and a lot of disk space in order to process 
the large files that you record. Audio files can also be fairly large.
	
✓	Microphone: Microphones these days are built into almost every laptop, 
and you can easily buy external microphones. Consider purchasing a 
good microphone from a professional audio store because the micro­
phones that you get from the average computer store or on the typical 
laptop are poor quality. Ask a podcaster or the staff of a good audio 
store for advice about the best microphone for the kind of recording 
situation that you expect to be in. Expect to spend at least $40 for your 
microphone: It isn’t the item to economize on.
	
✓	Sound-recording and sound-editing software: Unless you’re the sort of 
person who never deviates from a script or says “um,” you need soft­
ware to edit your audio or video. Solutions range from free to the price 
of a small automobile. Let your budget be your guide. You may want 
to start small and upgrade when you know more about podcasting and 
your own needs. A good starting point for audio software is the free 
program Audacity (http://audacity.sourceforge.net). Audacity 
(as shown in Figure 12-2) is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux/
Unix. It’s the program of choice for many podcasters, largely because 
it’s free and open source. Audacity is a multi-track recording program, 
which means you can have two pieces of audio, such as a voice and a 
piece of music, and you can mix the two at different volumes or even 
fade from one to the other.
	
	A high-end solution is Sony’s Sound Forge (www.sonycreative
software.com/products/soundforgefamily.asp).

Dressing Up Your Podcast with 
Music and Sound Effects
Nothing spices up a podcast like a little intro or background music. But 
podcasts — even if they’re produced and released at no cost to the listener — 
aren’t exempt from copyright restrictions. You need to find music and/or images 
that are in the public domain or licensed for republication.
 
Let me be clear: Even if you use only a little bit of a copyrighted song or give 
the performer credit, you’re still violating copyright if you don’t have a license 
or other permission to use the music. The same goes for using copyrighted 
images and video clips in videocasts.
But plenty of this material is available for you to use. The term podsafe has 
appeared to describe music, sounds, and other clips that are available for 
free unlimited use in podcasting, but no specific license exists to identify that 
a clip is podsafe. Read the terms and conditions before you integrate sound 
or audio into your productions.

The Freesound Project
www.freesound.org
Music is great, but what about sound effects? What podcast wouldn’t be 
improved by a few barking dogs and fart noises? I’m kidding, of course. But 
sound effects can really add value to your production, from realistic sounds 
of dialing a phone to a spring breeze. The Freesound Project can help you 
dress up your podcast.
Use its simple search box to find Creative Commons–licensed sound. You can 
also contribute your own sound effects to the project by creating an account 
and uploading to its website.
Publishing Your Podcast
You can put your podcast into the blogosphere fairly simply: Write a blog 
post about your podcast, upload your podcast media file, and then publish it 
by using your blog software.
But before you do that, you have a couple of tasks: You need to add metadata 
to and choose a file format for your podcast.
Assigning metadata
Metadata, simply put, is data about data. In the case of podcasts, metadata is 
data that describes your video or audio podcast. When you publish a podcast, 
whether audio or video, you need to provide descriptive metadata that pod­
cast systems such as Apple’s iTunes and the RSS feed can read. After all, the 
computer can’t listen to or watch your podcast and figure out what it contains!
Common metadata types include
	
✓	Title
	
✓	Author name
	
✓	Publication information
	
✓	Topics covered
	
✓	Type of file
	
✓	Descriptions
	
✓	Keywords
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

234
Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
Your editing software (both video and audio software packages) asks you to 
enter metadata when you create your audio or video files, and software such 
as iTunes, which is designed to support podcasts, also offers you a chance to 
provide metadata.
Choosing a format
Creating video and audio for general release means that you need to choose 
a file format that your audience can consume.
Most audio bloggers release audio files in the MP3 format. MP3 files are easy 
to create and play on a variety of devices. Most computer users are familiar 
with the format, and both browsers and preinstalled audio players have good 
built-in support for MP3s.
Other options are available, such as OOG, an open format, and AAC, a 
format popular on Apple computers. Windows users can play AAC files, too, 
if they install QuickTime. The Apple iPod can’t play OOG files, which is a 
significant issue for most audiences. AAC has some nice features, such as 
audio bookmarks.
Storing your podcasts
When you have a podcast ready for primetime, you need to figure out where 
to put it online. Posting your podcast poses two problems:
	
✓	Storage: You need a place to put the actual file. Audio and video files are 
larger than text files, so you may run into an issue with disk space when 
you store them.
	
✓	Bandwidth (the amount of data your audiences downloads): You have 
to account for the additional bandwidth required for your audience to 
download those files. It takes more bandwidth to deliver audio or video 
to your audience than it does text or images.
You have two options for getting the storage and bandwidth you need: your 
web-hosting server (the one that hosts your blog) or a free storage website.
Putting your files on your own web-hosting server
Check with your web host to find out how much disk space you have avail­
able and what it costs to increase your allotment. Be aware that if you keep 
podcasting, you’ll eventually run out of disk space, even if you start off with 
quite a bit. If you’re a video podcaster, you want a hosting package that has 
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
235
 Chapter 12: Starting a Podcast
several gigabytes of storage space. If you stick with only audio, you need a 
few gigabytes to start. When your podcasts grow in number, you’ll require 
more and more space, so keep that in mind. I talk about choosing a web host 
in Chapter 3.
You also need to consider bandwidth when you choose your hosting ser­
vice. Most web-hosting packages offer a standard amount of bandwidth, and 
you’re charged if you and your audience use more than that. Most web hosts 
have pretty reasonable fees, unless your podcast becomes the hottest thing 
on the web and your traffic becomes astronomical.
To give you a better idea about how file sizes can affect your web-hosting 
costs, I show you some reasonable working numbers. You can compare these 
to your hosting package bandwidth:
	
✓	1MB (megabyte) audio file: If you have 100 subscribers and you post 
one audio file a week, your estimated bandwidth for that file is about 
100MB.
	
✓	10MB (megabyte) video file: If you have 100 subscribers and you post 
one video file a week, your estimated bandwidth for that file is 1000MB 
or 1GB.
From these numbers, you can see how your bandwidth needs may skyrocket. 
Thinking about these almost hidden costs is important because you can get 
stuck with a hosting bill you weren’t expecting.
	
Bandwidth can be a confusing concept, especially when dealing with a pod­
cast. Websites like Podtopia (http://podtopia.net) have tools that let 
you generate estimates on how much it can cost you to host your own files.
	
Most hosting packages come with a finite amount of disk space and band­
width. You most likely can post only a certain number of podcasts before your 
hosting package runs out of space. Unless you have the dollars to spend, you 
probably need to find an alternative for storing your files.
Using a free storage and sharing website
Luckily for podcasters, a great service called Archive.org (www.archive.
org) is the home of the Internet Archive, a nonprofit organization founded 
in 1996 to build an Internet library in which researchers, historians, and the 
general public can store and access text, audio, moving images, software, and 
a vast collection of archived web pages.
	
You can upload your podcasts to the Internet Archive for free, as long as 
you comply with its guidelines and describe your content. The system also 
provides and converts your video or audio format into other formats for 
increased accessibility.

236
Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
You can find other podcast storage options, too. If you haven’t seen a YouTube 
video on a blog or website lately, you must be living under a rock. YouTube 
(www.youtube.com) has soared in popularity. When you upload a video to 
YouTube, your video is listed on the site, where visitors can view and com­
ment on it. But you can also grab the code for the file and embed it directly 
into your website or blog post. Files that you upload to YouTube are reformat­
ted into Flash video. They must be shorter than 15 minutes and less than 2GB 
in size.
If you think 15 minutes isn’t long enough for your blog, YouTube offers a 
YouTube Partner Program (www.youtube.com/partners). Members of 
the program are granted permission to upload larger video files, have videos 
longer than 15 minutes, and share advertisement revenue. If you think video 
blogging is for you, check it out!
Delivering your podcasts
After you have your audio and video online and your blog post created, you 
need to make sure that your blog has an RSS web feed. Podcasts are typically 
delivered to playback software (such as Apple iTunes) through a subscrip­
tion to your blog’s RSS feed. I talk extensively about setting up and using RSS 
in Chapter 14.
Suffice it to say that you need an RSS feed so that your viewers and listeners 
can subscribe to it themselves, but also so that you can promote your pod­
cast by using some of the handy podcast promotional directories and soft­
ware out there. (See the following section for the promotion details.)
If you already subscribe to a number of blogs, you know that a syndicated 
blog feed contains information such as the title of the post, the main con­
tent, and maybe some author information. A podcast feed, in addition to 
the typical entry information, contains a link to a media file. If a consumer 
subscribes to a podcast feed by using an RSS reader, most modern readers 
automatically download the files so that the user can listen or watch at his 
or her convenience.
Promoting Your Podcast
Publishing your podcast on your website can help you promote it, but you 
can get the word out in more effective ways. If you already have a good pro­
motional system built into your site and a decent-sized audience, you can get 
users to subscribe to your podcast without too much additional marketing. 
If you need a little more promotion, however, you also can use a number of 
other strategies.

tion if you plan to pursue funding or sponsorship. Once you have set up a 
podcast with FeedBurner, log in and select it in order to view traffic informa­
tion in the Analyze section of the site.
Adding your podcast to iTunes
Because of the overwhelming popularity of Apple’s iTunes software as 
the main podcast viewer, you absolutely must submit your podcast to its 
service — unless, for some reason, you don’t want people to find your 
podcast.
Before you submit your podcast to iTunes, you need to do the following:
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
240
Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
	
✓	Sign up for an Apple ID. Each submission is associated with a user 
account. If you have iTunes installed on your computer and have pur­
chased songs or other media from the iTunes store, you already have 
an Apple ID. To get an ID, download iTunes, which you find at www.
itunes.com; after you install the software, select the iTunes Store 
option on the left of the main screen to begin setting up your ID.
	
✓	Set up an RSS feed. If you’re using blog software, you likely already have 
a feed. Check your documentation for more information, and jump to 
Chapter 14 for more about RSS feeds.
	
✓	Have a few entries in your feed and make sure that the feed is work­
ing. You can test your feed by making sure your own feed reader (like 
Google Reader) can subscribe to your feed. If you see your posts in your 
reader, the feed should be working fine. Refer to Chapter 14 for informa­
tion on subscribing to feeds in Google Reader.
	
	If you have a FeedBurner feed set up, you’ve already taken care of some 
of the optimization to make your feed work well in iTunes. Be sure to 
use the FeedBurner feed address when you sign up in iTunes.
Before iTunes adds podcasts to the Store, Apple iTunes staff reviews pod­
cast submissions. The staff can refuse podcasts for even very small reasons. 
You may have problems getting a podcast added if you’ve been turned down 
before.
If you have the iTunes software installed on your computer, you can submit 
your podcast by using the iTunes interface. In order to get your podcast into 
the iTunes Store, follow these steps:
	
1.	Start your iTunes software.
	
2.	Click the iTunes Store navigation item in the left column.
	
	 This will open the iTunes store interface.
	
3.	Select the Podcasts link from the iTunes Store menu on the top of the 
screen.
	
	The Podcasts page appears.
	
4.	Click the Submit a Podcast menu item located in the top-right of the 
page.
	
	 iTunes loads the Submit Podcasts page.
	
5.	Enter the RSS feed of your podcast in the Podcast Feed URL field and 
click the Continue button.
	
	If you’re not logged in to the iTunes Store, you’re prompted to log in at 
this point.
	
	 iTunes submits your feed for review by Apple staff.

 Chapter 12: Starting a Podcast
After you submit your podcast, it might take several days or even weeks 
until your feed shows up in the iTunes library of podcasts. If your podcast is 
rejected for any reason, you receive an e-mail from Apple. (Unfortunately, it 
doesn’t provide reasons for rejections.)
Getting listed in podcast directories
Podcast directories help would-be listeners and viewers find known pod­
casts. Getting listed in these directories is an easy way to let people know 
about your podcast. Most directories are organized by topic, and many of 
them offer subscription features that allow people to quickly sign up for your 
podcast. Listing your podcast in these directories can most certainly provide 
you with new traffic to your blog and podcast.
Here’s where you should get your podcast listed:
	
✓	Podcast Alley (www.podcastalley.com): This site contains a podcast 
directory, as well as news and information about podcasting.
	
✓	Podcast.com (www.podcast.com): Podcasts are organized by category 
(for example, entertainment or sports), and the home page displays a 
list of recently updated podcasts.
	
✓	Castroller (www.castroller.com): One of the newer websites for sub­
scribing, organizing, and listening to podcasts. You can sort podcasts 
you listen to into “channels,” and it is easy to recommend podcasts 
(including your own!) to others. It is easy to use and has a lot of social 
media functionality built in. This makes it easy for your listeners to pro­
mote you.
	
✓	Podcast Pickle (www.podcastpickle.com): One of the older podcast 
directories, Podcast Pickle offers visitors organization tools for the pod­
casts to which they subscribe.
	
✓	PodNova (www.podnova.com): More than just a directory. You can 
subscribe, listen, view, read, and maintain your feeds online by using 
PodNova.
	
✓	PodBean (www.podbean.com): Another directory where you can pub­
lish and host your podcast. You and your audience can listen and view 
your podcasts and share them on other websites like Facebook.
And if you don’t want to put your podcast on any of the sites in the preced­
ing list, check out Robin Good’s extensive list of podcast directories at www.

▶	Installing forum software
▶	Establishing community guidelines
I

magine your blogging career five years in the future. Your blog has thou­
sands of visitors every single day. Comments are being left on your blog 
posts by the hundreds every hour. A blogging career couldn’t get any better, 
could it? You’ve reached the big time! People love you!
But wait! You also have a problem: You can’t keep up with the conversation, 
and now that you think about it, a lot of your contributors are talking to each 
other. Although you love reading what they have to say, these conversations 
aren’t really directed at you anymore. One possible solution to this awesome 
dilemma is to add a forum to your blog. On the Internet, a forum — which 
might also be called a message board or bulletin board — is software that per­
mits date-sorted conversations between members, generally organized around 
topics. Members can reply to messages posted by others, or start their own 
topics. Unlike blog posts, forums are typically not maintained by an author. 
Members are all on an equal playing field when it comes to the conversation.
Sounds good, right? But, should you do it? Is it a good idea? What if members 
talk about things unrelated to the topics you normally discuss on your blog?
In this chapter, I discuss the benefits of setting up a forum, what types of 
forum software are available, and how forums differ from your blog’s com­
ment system. I also tell you about common features of a typical forum pack­
age and how you can add a forum to your blog without disturbing the natural 
flow of the blog itself.

Deciding Whether Forums 
Will Work for You
The neuroscientist and author Sam Harris has a blog combined with a 
forum on his website at www.samharris.org. Sam is sometimes known as 
“America’s leading atheist,” and his writings cover the intersection of reli­
gion and science. As you can imagine, this is a set of topics that generates a 
huge amount of discussion, and Sam has responded by housing some of this 
conversation on the forums of his website (www.samharris.org/forum), 
shown in Figure 13-1. This neatly solves one of Sam’s biggest problems — as 
a single individual, he simply can’t respond to the sheer volume of conversa­
tion his chosen field generates, but discussion of which he encourages.
There are many reasons to add a forum to your blog. The first and most 
common reason is that your frequent visitors may ask you to add one, but 
you may also see the need for it yourself.
The second most common reason is that discussions have simply outgrown 
the blog commenting system. This isn’t a bad thing; it just means your blog 
is incredibly popular. You should be pleased that visitors enjoy what you are 
doing so much!

 Chapter 13: Leveraging Community with Forums
Some bloggers find that comments are great ways for dialogue to start, and 
that forums allow that discussion to expand. But how does a forum benefit 
your blog itself? How can you use a forum to grow your community? Here 
are a few examples of what a forum can do besides giving your readers a 
way to chat:
	
✓	Increase traffic to your blog: By offering a place where people can 
exchange ideas and chat directly with one another, you can reap the 
rewards of additional content. Each posting on your blog is an individual 
page that people can find by searching the Internet. The same thing 
applies to forum posts. The more discussions you facilitate, the more 
pages and locations search engines can index. This means you can use 
your forum as a place for friendly conversation and generate more traffic.
	
✓	Find a new type of audience: A forum may attract a whole new type of 
readership. Those individuals who like to leave comments on blog posts 
may not be invested enough to carry on longer chats with other comment­
ing visitors. But providing them a platform where they can expand on 
their comments and offer additional opinions can help build a new audi­
ence. There is an audience out there that enjoys participating in wider 
discussions that are not specific to individual blog posts. People may be 
attracted to your forum and then start participating in the comments.
	
✓	Keep tabs on your audience’s interests: Even though you write your blog 
to put your ideas out into the blogosphere, you may run dry from time to 
time. You can look through the comments on your blog to find new ideas 
or expand on existing posts, but a forum can generate a whole new set of 
ideas. This is a great tool for taking the pulse of what your community is 
finding compelling or interesting, where they have questions, and that can 
feed directly back into what you choose to discuss on your blog.
	
✓	Build additional credibility: If you are already blogging and attracting 
readers, you are likely developing some visible expertise with your com­
munity. Forums can help build that reputation with a larger audience, 
and on a broader set of topics. (You may even learn a thing or two from 
your community members while you’re at it!) 
	
✓	Have more “you” time: Comments on blogs tend to be directed 
toward you, the blogger. This means that people who leave comments 
want to hear your reaction to their thoughts. You need to spend a lot 
of your time not just writing your blog but also responding to com­
ments. Adding a forum gives your community members the chance to 
help each other out, and takes a bit of the pressure off you to be the 
only source of information.
Does it sound like it is worth adding a forum to your blog? Don’t worry if the 
answer is “No,” “I’m not sure,” or “Not right now.” Forums aren’t for every blog, 
or every blogger, but they can be a natural evolution of online discussions and 
commentary. There isn’t a stock answer — the final call is up to you! If you’re 
on the fence, you might want to write a blog post and see what your readers 
think.

If your answer is “Yes, let’s go!” jump to the next section for answers to what 
I’m sure your question is now — what kind of forum software is available?
Researching Software Options
A set of “out of the box” features come with most forum software packages, 
but it’s worth reviewing the basics to make sure you’re meeting your audi­
ence’s needs when making your selection.
	
A great online source where you can “kick the tires” on a bunch of differ­
ent forum software can be found at http://php.opensourcecms.com/
scripts/show.php?catid=5&category=Forums.
The website is dedicated to providing demonstrations of blog software, 
forum software, and general content management systems. It’s a great place 
to try out forum packages without installing them yourself.
Another option to consider before you start installing software is to find 
some online forums (whether or not they are on a blog) and spend some 
time using them. You can often find out what software is being used by look­
ing near the bottom of the home page of the forum. You can then make your 
choice based on the user experience.
Choosing between Free and 
Commercial Forum Software
One of the first decisions you must make is between free forum software and 
commercial software. Both categories offer great options.
Budget is of course one of the biggest differences. There’s free . . . and not 
free. If you have zero budget, well, the choice is pretty simple! But if you do 
have some money to spend, commercial forum software generally offers 
some level of customer service and technical support that free software 
lacks. If something goes wrong or the forum does not perform correctly, 
answers can be a little easier to come by. If you aren’t terribly technical your­
self, having reliable technical support may be cheap, whatever the cost.
Selecting the software that will benefit both you and your audience is para­
mount to the success of your forum, so be sure to thoroughly kick the tires 
before you make your final choice.

 Chapter 13: Leveraging Community with Forums
In addition to forum software you install on a web server, you can also use 
hosted software that runs elsewhere. See the “Hosted forum solutions” side­
bar, later in this chapter, for information about these lighter-weight options.
Browsing commercial forum software
Here are three of the most popular packages with commercial support:
	
✓	vBulletin (www.vbulletin.com): This feature-rich forum software 
offers commercial support and a variety of licensing models. Cost starts 
at $195 and increases based on additional features and support levels.
	
✓	UBB.Threads (www.ubbcentral.com): Available since 1997, UBB pric­
ing starts at $139, and you can pay to have the software installed.
	
✓	IP.Board (www.invisionpower.com): Part of a suite of website tools, 
this forum software can be purchased on its own from $149.
Perusing open source forum software
Here are a few open source alternatives:
	
✓	phpBB (www.phpbb.com): This very popular open source package has 
been available since 2000, and there are good user-created resources.
	
✓	Vanilla Forums (www.vanillaforums.org): This tool promises a high 
degree of flexibility and integration with existing websites and blogs.
	
✓	miniBB (www.minibb.com): miniBB is a lightweight forum package that 
prides itself on being small and fast.
Hosted forum solutions
For those who would prefer to make implement­
ing forums as simple as possible, hosted forum 
software is the easiest way to go. Hosted forum 
software works much like hosted blog software: 
You sign up for a service and they handle all the 
hosting, technical maintenance, and users on 
their own servers, so there’s no need for you 
to install anything, or even have web hosting.
The downside is that hosted solutions may not 
be as flexible and may not allow full integration 
with your blog software. And, as with hosted 
blog software, you typically must abide by the 
company’s use requirements, and won’t have 
any control over downtime or features.

Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
Getting Finicky about Features
Of course, it isn’t all about the cost! Features matter when it comes to forums, 
particularly those that need to host a high volume of messages and/or users. 
It’s worth noting that although you can migrate from one forum software pack­
age to another, the process is notoriously complicated, so you can save your­
self time if you think through the options up front.
	
✓	Availability: Some blog software actually offers forum software, or inte­
grates easily with a particular package. Check your blog documentation. 
If you are lucky and the blog platform you selected has forum features 
built in, all you have to do is turn them on. If it doesn’t, it’s worth check­
ing to see if there is a package commonly used by others using the blog 
software you are using, or if there are compatibility recommendations. 
bbPress, for example, was created by the makers of WordPress, and can 
be easily implemented on WordPress blogs (www.bbpress.org).
	
✓	Threading: One of the most important forum features is whether or not 
conversations on the forum are flat or threaded. Threading groups sets 
messages together, relating them. For example, if you post something on 
a forum and someone replies to you, a threaded conversation displays 
a visual cue that indicates that the forum postings are part of the same 
conversation. You can track which conversations are which and who is 
replying to what postings. You can see an example of a threaded forum 
in Figure 13-2.

 Chapter 13: Leveraging Community with Forums
	
✓	Look and feel: Forum software is incredibly visual, and typically a soft­
ware package comes with several default themes, or design packages. 
Many offer additional themes, for free or for a fee. You may also be inter­
ested in creating a custom theme that matches the design of the blog 
you’re adding the forum to.
	
✓	Ignore lists: Not everyone on the same forum is the best of friends. 
Unlike the comment system where users always know who is writing 
the comment (unless they post anonymously, but those types of people 
don’t really want to have real discussions), you want to give a little bit 
of control to your users to make sure their time on your forum is a good 
one. Ignore lists allow a forum member to hide other users and their 
posts. This is somewhat like blocking someone on a social network, and 
a handy feature that lets your community members aggressively dislike 
another member and still have a positive experience.
	
✓	Signatures (sigs): Forum users are addicted to signatures. A signature 
is a lot like it sounds — a way for users to append identifying informa­
tion to the posts they make on the forum. Signatures generally allow for 
imagery, links to external websites, famous quotes, and even some good 
old-fashioned silliness. As you might expect, forum members are quite 
attached to them.
	
✓	Emoticons: Who doesn’t love emoticons? Don’t answer that :). 
Emoticons are whimsical text or visual icons intended to convey emo­
tion. Many forum users use them to indicate the tone of their message 
and prevent misinterpretation. Emoticon options differ from software 
package to software package, but are usually appreciated by the forum 
members.
	
✓	Polls: Polls are a nice feature that allows visitors to vote on questions 
that other users create. Questions can be asked, and answers can be 
preselected by the user asking the question. The answers are then calcu­
lated, and a graph is produced.
	
✓	Membership tools: Most forum software offers a set of member­
ship tools, like registration, profiles, avatars, and so on. Membership 
allows the software to understand that posts come from the same user 
and keep track of the user’s activity across the lifespan of the forum. 
Membership requirements decrease the amount of spam on a forum, 
and also allow moderators to remove or block problematic users.
	
	If your blog already has registration turned on for comment posting, you 
may want to look for forum software that can be tied into your existing 
membership database, so that visitors don’t have to create and remem­
ber two different accounts.
	
✓	Spam controls: If you thought that spammers would leave a forum alone, 
think again. I’m sorry to say that spam is as big a problem on a forum 
as it is on a blog. Membership (see the preceding bullet) can help, but a 
good forum software package should offer you some options for identify­
ing, preventing, and removing spam posts and users.

Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
	
✓	Images and rich media: Some forum software allows users the capabil­
ity to post images, upload files, and embed rich media from other loca­
tions on the web. This can make postings and discussions more vibrant.
At the end of the day, the features you choose help your users communicate 
better — more quickly, easily, and effectively. So do your homework!
Installing Forum Software
After you decide to press ahead with installing a forum for your readers, it’s 
time to think about what you need to run it. If you already have web hosting 
for your blog, this process may be quite simple. In fact, check with your web 
host; they may have a forum software package available as an add-in, or may 
even be able to take care of the installation for you.
If you don’t have web hosting, it’s time to find some. I talk about web hosting 
in Chapter 3.
	
As well as establishing web hosting, you must think about the URL for your 
forum. Your blog, for example, may have a URL like www.example.com. When 
you install your forum software, you can’t use the same URL because your 
blog already lives at that location. The forums need their own addresses. A 
couple of options are:
	
✓	www.example.com/forum
	
✓	www.forum.example.com
Consult with your web host to see what the best options are, or if they have 
any guidelines for where and how software of this kind should be installed.
The installation process for your forum software will vary from package to 
package, but they all come with installation instructions. Refer to those in 
order to complete the installation of the package you’ve chosen.
A typical installation process, however, looks a lot like this:
	
1.	 Download the forum software from the web.
	
2.	 Decompress the file on your computer.
	
3.	 Upload the forum software files to your web hosting account.
	
4.	 When the files are in the correct location, go to the installation script 
page in your browser and click the Install button to be walked through 
the installation procedure.

251
 Chapter 13: Leveraging Community with Forums
	
5.	 When the forums are installed, visit them and test all the common tasks 
your users need to accomplish, such as registering, logging in, resetting 
a password, formatting a member profile, and of course, posting!
	
If you have any problems with the installation procedure, make notes about 
any error messages you see, and where the failure occurred in the installation 
process so that you can ask good questions using whatever support tools are 
available to you. And if you’ve opted not to spring for support, a search engine 
query on the error may help you track down the problem.
Cultivating Community Standards
As Chapter 9 mentions, building community standards is important. 
Establishing a good set of rules will encourage readers to get involved and 
add their own ideas to the conversations. Ideally, the dialogue on your forum 
stays civil, respectful, and on-topic. However, sometimes your community 
may need a little push in the right direction. Making your expectations 
regarding behavior clear upfront can help set the tone for the kinds of con­
versations that occur on the forum — and give you a way to remove mem­
bers who don’t follow the rules without being accused of censorship.
Typically, forum guidelines should direct members to conform to some basic 
standards:
	
✓	Be polite: Being rude on a forum is tempting for some people. You prob­
ably want to make sure politeness is one of your first and foremost rules.
	
✓	“No flaming, no trolls.” Many forum owners explicitly indicate that flam­
ing and trolls aren’t allowed. Flaming someone is the act of posting hos­
tile messages. Flames are often posted by trolls, people who participate 
in a forum with the purpose of sowing havoc with off-topic or offensive 
content.
	
✓	User accounts: You may want to make it clear that the user accounts 
you provide to all of those who chat in your forums exist on your terms, 
and that people who violate terms lose their accounts.
	
✓	Links: Some communities restrict their users and do not allow linking to 
other websites. Others allow users to post links, but only after members 
have been active for some time. Because some links can take people 
to unwanted material, spam, and malware websites, links can become 
problematic.
	
✓	Pictures: If your software allows users to post photos, either as part of 
their member profile, or within the body of posts, you need to specify 
whether particular types of imagery are acceptable. Nudity, for example, 
is typically excluded.

252
Part IV: Going Beyond Words 
	
✓	Legal stuff: A mention about copyright is worth including. Forum soft­
ware lets users post images, audio, and text, but the users must be held 
to a standard that means they are not posting the work of others.
Some of this stuff sounds a little daunting, I know. But most people appreci­
ate the additional resource of a forum and aren’t actually out to post trouble­
some content. If you’re thinking about guidelines, visit some existing forums 
and review their terms of use for additional ideas and considerations. Forums 
that have been around for some time may be especially useful for this pur­
pose, because their guidelines have probably evolved as the community ran 
into particular kinds of problems.
When it comes to community guidelines of any sort, they are entirely up to 
you. Like comments, you may consider it your duty to protect everyone who 
posts on your blog and your forums, or you may feel that the community 
should police itself. It can be a very structured conversation that you encour­
age or you can let it be a written “wild west.”

Reaching Out with RSS
In This Chapter
▶	Figuring out what RSS really is
▶	Signing up for an RSS feed
▶	Putting RSS to work for your blog
N

o fashionable blog would be caught dead without a web feed. It’s 
essential for both accessibility and promotion of your blog. RSS (Really 
Simple Syndication) feeds, or web feeds, give you an easy way to distribute 
your content, such as blog posts and podcasts, to your web audience.
But what is RSS, really? In this chapter, I explain what an RSS feed is, how to 
create your blog feed (it’s easy), how to subscribe to feeds, and more.
Getting the Goods on Web Feeds
RSS is one of the hottest technologies on the Internet today. Since 2003 — 
which is when blogs truly reached mainstream awareness — blogs and other 
technologies have adopted RSS at an exponential rate. Companies such as 
Mozilla, Microsoft, IBM, and many others have created really interesting 
ways to use RSS feeds to share information, both through their websites and 
through internal communication processes.
Put simply, when you syndicate your blog by using a web feed, feed software 
reads your blog posts, which it formats by using XML (eXtensible Markup 
Language). XML is an Internet standard and marks your prose so that soft­
ware applications can understand and display it properly for readers who 
subscribe to your blog.
Why is RSS a good thing? Well, it means that code can be used to easily dis­
play your blog’s feed on other websites, from blogs to search engines. Sites 
that pull in news from multiple sources use RSS feeds to do so, and being 
syndicated in this way can earn you traffic from those sites back to your blog.

Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
But more importantly, newsreader software that any visitor to your site 
might use can read RSS feeds, and visitors can then access your blog quickly 
and easily. By subscribing to a blog via an RSS feed, visitors don’t have 
to bookmark hundreds of blogs and check them every 20 minutes to see 
whether the bloggers have updated them. Instead, a user can simply log into 
his or her newsreader software to see in one window all the feeds to which 
he or she subscribes.
	
On the web, several different terms describe the subject of this chapter: RSS, 
Atom, web feed, and news feed are a few. Website developers use all these 
terms interchangeably, but the most accurate one is web feed. RSS is simply a 
type of web feed. Even though web feed is the most accurate name, I usually 
refer to RSS feeds because that’s how most blogs and bloggers refer to them.
	
If you want to find out more about RSS than I can provide in this chapter, 
either to give your blog visibility in the world or to pull other blog content into 
your own blog or site, consider reading Syndicating Web Sites with RSS Feeds 
For Dummies, by Ellen Finkelstein (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).
Breaking it down further
Essentially, RSS gives your blog the capability to break down its content into 
a basic text file. Software creates this text file in a special XML format that 
makes up the feed. Blog software then distributes this plain-text version of 
your blog content to other websites, search engines, and blogosphere track­
ing services. Figure 14-1 shows the code behind an RSS feed.
A few acronyms for RSS are floating around out on the Internet. Here are the 
acronyms you’re most likely to see, and if you want to talk about RSS with 
your blog readers, you can use any of them (but the first one tends to be the 
most popular):
	
✓	Really Simple Syndication
	
✓	RDF Site Summary
	
✓	Real Simple Syndication
	
✓	Rich Site Summary
	
You can use RSS to syndicate content on your blog, but most mainstream 
news agencies also use RSS to make their news information more accessible. 
News services such as Reuters, CBC, CNN, and the Washington Post use RSS 
technology to spread their articles beyond their own websites.
Many web browsers use XML to handle displaying RSS feeds in a more attrac­
tive format. If you click an RSS feed link and find that the content that loads 
looks rather user friendly, you’re probably using a browser that understands 
and formats XML nicely.

For a really excellent short video that describes just what RSS is and how it 
works, visit the Common Craft blog at www.commoncraft.com/video/rss. 
This video uses simple graphics and words to get across the concepts that 
make RSS so groundbreaking.
Confused? Well, don’t worry, because nearly all blog software automatically 
builds your RSS feed and helps you advertise it to your blog visitors. So, 
you’re most likely covered, in any case — but if you know a little bit about 
RSS and why it’s important to your blog, you can ensure your blog content 
reaches a wider audience.
Generating web traffic
Some bloggers have a tendency to limit the distribution of their content and 
keep it off other sites. The reasoning goes that you worked hard to create 
that content, so why should other sites and software get to display it for free?
	
Actually, because of its ease of use, RSS can help you gain more users. Your 
website can travel further than ever because you can distribute RSS feeds with 
little to no effort on your part. Because syndication of your content includes 
links back to your blog, people who are exposed to your RSS feed probably 
click those links and come to your blog.

Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
So, because the RSS feed is only text, it doesn’t have to stay in one place. Any 
number of websites and blogs can pick it up and display it.
Creating a feed for your blog
Unless you really want to mess around in the code of your own RSS files, you 
shouldn’t need to do anything special to get started with RSS. Most blog soft­
ware already includes an RSS feed that pulls together and syndicates your 
blog. At most, you might have to turn on the option to have an RSS feed.
Then, just blog normally and ignore the feed. Your users can find it and sub­
scribe, and your blog content flows automatically into the feed.
	
Chances are that your blog software already has RSS capability. Check your 
administrative settings and documentation. If it doesn’t, you might also be 
able to add the functionality by using a plug-in.
If you don’t have software that creates an RSS feed, you have a couple of 
options. If you’re a programmer or coder, you can probably pick up enough 
XML to hand-code an RSS feed yourself. But an even better option is to use 
some of the third-party feed creation tools available today:
	
✓	FeedYes (www.feedyes.com): Use this simple tool to create an RSS 
feed from any website or blog. You can create multiple feeds and, with 
an account, edit and manage them. FeedYes is free.
	
✓	IceRocket RSS Builder (http://rss.icerocket.com): With this 
tool you can build RSS feeds or “channels” from practically any content 
on the web. You can create as many feeds as you want. IceRocket RSS 
Builder is a free service.
	
✓	Feed43 (www.feed43.com): Set up a feed for your blog quickly and for 
free. Increase the frequency with which your feed is updated by buying a 
higher level of feed, starting at $29 a year.
	
✓	FeedForAll (www.feedforall.com): Use this tool to create and edit 
RSS feeds for your blog or podcast. You must be able to install software 
on your web host to use this tool. Pricing starts at $39.95.
When a feed exists, you don’t need to do anything else. Search engines and 
software tools automatically find it when they index your blog, and your 
readers can subscribe to your feed when and if they choose to do so.
Subscribing to an RSS Feed
I’m sure you read at least a few favorite blogs regularly. Do you visit them 
every day or maybe even several times a day? Are you ever frustrated 
because the site hasn’t been updated yet? Do you ever miss a post by a few

minutes, and then read it hours or days later, and miss out on the conversa­
tion? The solution to this problem is RSS.
Follow these basic steps to get set up with your favorite blog’s RSS feed:
	
1.	Choose a newsreader and sign up to begin using it.
	
	 You can find tons out there, and I tell you about a few of my favorites in 
the sections “Finding a web-based newsreader” and “Choosing a desk­
top-based reader,” both later in this chapter.
	
2.	Subscribe to an RSS feed.
	
	 Don’t worry: You can subscribe to an RSS feed even more easily (and 
cheaply) than you can subscribe to a newspaper or magazine, although 
the idea is similar. The newsreader software you chose and signed up to 
use provides specific instructions on subscribing.
	
3.	Check your newsreader.
	
	 When you subscribe to an RSS feed, new blog posts appear in your 
newsreader every time the blogger posts a new entry to his or her blog. 
When the blogger publishes a new post, the RSS feed is updated a few 
minutes later, and the newsreader checks the feed and alerts you to the 
new posts.
	
4.	Click, read, and voilà!
	
	No more boring bookmarking and refreshing a blog over and over. You 
go to the blog only when it has new content, so you never miss anything.
You can subscribe to as many (or as few) feeds as you want, potentially keep­
ing track of hundreds of sites, all in one place.
Browser newsreaders
Some browsers have built-in newsreaders that you can use to subscribe to 
feeds and then read them. On a PC, Internet Explorer 7 and higher allows 
you to read, subscribe to, and manage feed subscriptions right inside the 
browser. Mac and PC users of the Firefox web browser can install a plug-in 
called Sage (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/
sage) to add news-reading capabilities to the browser.
On the Mac, you can use the built-in newsreader in the Safari browser to sub­
scribe to and read feeds.
Finding a web-based newsreader
Web-based newsreaders are online services that allow you to aggregate your 
favorite feeds into a simple interface where you can read your subscriptions. 
These online services are usually free.

Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
The big advantage to using a web-based newsreader is that you can log into 
the service from any computer, even if you’re traveling, at the library, or 
using your son’s laptop. In most cases, however, you need to have Internet 
access in order to read the blog posts because you have to be online. Google 
Reader, Bloglines, and Feedly, introduced in the following sections, are three 
popular web-based newsreaders.
Google Reader
www.google.com/reader
Google Reader is a great web-based feed aggregator. If you already regis­
tered with Gmail or other Google services, getting started with Reader is as 
simple as signing in at www.google.com/reader. If you don’t have a Google 
account already, click the Create an Account Now link.
Google Reader’s interface is similar to the other Google web products, and it 
features feed searching, RSS feed sharing, mobile access, and offline reading. 
Google Reader is shown in Figure 14-2.

 Chapter 14: Reaching Out with RSS
Bloglines
www.bloglines.com
The web-based application Bloglines is super-simple to use, with quick tools 
for adding a subscription and sorting your subscriptions into categories. One 
fun feature of Bloglines is that you can produce a blogroll — a list of links 
to blogs — to put in your blog’s sidebar, sharing the blogs to which you’re 
subscribed with your readers. Bloglines even carries over the categorization 
when it displays your blog subscriptions. You can mark some feeds as pri­
vate if you prefer not to share them with the world.
Feedly
www.feedly.com
Feedly is a unique browser-based application designed to make your feed 
reading enjoyable by providing you with an easy-to-read, newspaper-like 
layout. The main feature is called “the cover,” where your feeds are displayed 
in a thumbnail format that looks great to the eye and makes sorting through 
many feeds enjoyable. Integration with social networks like Facebook, 
Twitter, and Tumblr is seamless and makes sharing posts with others a snap.
Feedly is available as a browser-based application but also has free iPhone, 
iPad, and Android mobile applications. Feedly requires you to have a Google 
account and Google Reader.
Choosing a desktop-based reader
Desktop readers are a little different than online newsreaders. You install 
desktop readers directly on your computer (so they don’t use any web-based 
tools), which gives you a bit more control over when the reader checks and 
updates your feeds. Best of all, a desktop reader actually downloads the 
feeds to your machine, so you can read blogs even when you don’t have 
Internet access — perhaps while making a commute or on an airplane.
	
Some people believe that a major drawback of desktop readers is that they 
cause your computer to run slower than it normally would, especially when 
it has to check a large number of feeds. Because computers have so many dif­
ferences, I can’t predict whether a desktop reader may slow down your com­
puter, but definitely watch out for this problem.
FeedDemon (Windows)

Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
FeedDemon is a free RSS reader client that you can install locally on your 
computer. It downloads updates from your feeds on a regular basis (which 
you can configure), and it features many great organizational tools that keep 
your feeds updated and easy to peruse.
FeedDemon, available from the folks at NewsGator, also downloads and 
stores any podcasts to which you subscribe; it transfers those podcasts 
to your portable audio player. As if that isn’t enough, you can also set up 
custom news watches to keep track of topics or events that you want to 
know more about.
FeedDemon is available only for Windows.
NetNewsWire (Mac)
www.newsgator.com/rss-readers.aspx
NewsGator’s Mac newsreader solution is NetNewsWire, a free program that 
takes advantage of preinstalled Apple software on the Mac. As with FeedDemon, 
you can use NetNewsWire to read and organize feeds, as well as save them for 
later reference or send them via e-mail or instant messenger to a friend.
NetNewsWire automatically downloads podcasts and transfers them to 
Apple’s iTunes software, and you can even use NetNewsWire with iCal and 
Address Book.
	
NewsGator also makes a newsreader for the Apple iPhone and iPad, which 
you can download via the iPhone App Store. The premium iPhone version, at 
$4.99, or the premium iPad version, at $9.99, ensures that your reading experi­
ence is ad-free.
Signing up for a feed
After you select a newsreader, you can subscribe to a feed and start reading! 
This task has two steps: visiting a blog that you enjoy reading and then sub­
scribing.
Somewhere on the blog page, you might see a small orange icon, sometimes 
with the acronym RSS or XML in it. Or you might just see a small text link to 
the feed.
	
Look closely: RSS feeds can be hard to find on the page. Because you need to 
use the link only once, bloggers tend to downplay them in the design.
Alternet (www.alternet.org) offers several different RSS feeds, so you can 
choose between getting front-page news stories, video stories, columns, and 
so on. Check out all the flavors at www.alternet.org/webfeeds.

 Chapter 14: Reaching Out with RSS
When you find the RSS link or icon, click it. If you’re using a web-based news­
reader, you might be subscribed automatically, or you might see an icon for 
subscribing using one of the most common newsreaders.
If you don’t see a link or an icon to an RSS feed, copy the URL from the 
address bar of the browser. Return to your newsreader and follow your news­
reader’s instructions for adding a new subscription.
Follow these steps to subscribe to an RSS feed in Google Reader:
	
1.	Visit a blog or website to which you want to subscribe and locate the 
feed link or icon.
	
2.	Click the link.
	
	 The browser displays the feed.
	
3.	Copy the URL from the address bar.
	
	 You can also simply right-click the feed link or icon and select Copy Link 
Location or Copy Shortcut from the pop-up menu that appears.
	
4.	In Google Reader, click the Add Subscription link in the left column.
	
	 A small dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 14-3.
	
	 If Google Reader finds the feed, that feed appears in the right column. If 
it doesn’t find the feed, Google Reader notifies you.
	
5.	Repeat as desired!

Making the Most of RSS
You can use RSS in all sorts of ways. Industries as diverse as financial sectors 
and breaking news organizations have adopted RSS because it’s so flexible 
and generates website traffic, attracting new readers from search engines and 
news aggregators. But that’s not all you can use RSS for:

Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
	
✓	Syndicating content: In the blogosphere, syndication means that you 
publish your information on the web so that newsreaders and other 
websites can display it.
	
✓	Aggregating news: Do you like other blogs that deal with similar topics 
as your own? You can use their RSS feeds to include their content on 
your website. You can link directly to it or, if your blog software has 
such functionality, display other blog content on your own blog.
	
✓	Replacing e-mail newsletters: Some RSS advocates make astounding 
claims that RSS will be the death of e-mail. Although this dire prediction 
hasn’t yet come to pass, RSS definitely has many advantages over e-mail 
newsletters. The most important is that you can avoid spam. How? You 
can simply choose to read an RSS feed, rather than receive more e-mail; 
by not giving away your e-mail address, you don’t put it at risk for being 
sold to a spammer.
	
✓	Keeping communities updated: RSS feeds are terrific for keeping people 
updated. Some feeds merely post information, such as sports scores — 
as fast as a goal is scored, an RSS feed can be updated. Here are five 
kinds of things you can share that people might want to know as soon as 
possible:
 
• Security bulletins
 
• Classified listings for apartments
 
• Emergency weather changes
 
• Changes to bids on eBay or Amazon
 
• Product availability at retail stores
Because of the simplicity of using RSS technology (yes, the actual building of 
RSS feeds might still be too geeky for most bloggers), you can use it in many 
ways to augment the communication channels of your blog or within your 
community that you haven’t quite figured out yet. Get creative!

W

hile I was watching a well-known sitcom on TV the other day, a char­
acter mentioned Twitter. If that’s not mainstream, I don’t know what 
is! But just because Hollywood knows about Twitter doesn’t mean that you 
don’t have questions, so this chapter gets down to brass tacks.
Twitter (www.twitter.com) is a free social network used for micro blog­
ging, which is essentially blogging, but in very short form. How short? Well, 
on Twitter, your posts are limited to 140 characters — barely enough for a 
couple of sentences. If you use Facebook, you may be surprised to know that 
you’re already familiar with micro blogging.
Although you can post only up to 140 characters of text at a time on Twitter, 
you can use it to share photographs and links, even videos. Many businesses 
have jumped onto the Twitter bandwagon and use the tool to tell their cus­
tomers about sales, specials, and other news.
	
If this chapter whets your appetite for even more Twitter tidbits, be sure to 
check out Twitter For Dummies, by Laura Fitton, Michael Gruen, and Leslie 
Poston (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).
Understanding Twitter
Twitter started in 2006 and grew slowly into the phenomenon it is today. It’s 
fundamentally difficult to explain both its popularity and its purpose; as with 
blogs themselves, some very logical and common-sense questions jump to 
mind for most people:
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
	
✓	Who’s going to read this stuff, anyway?
	
✓	What am I supposed to talk about on Twitter?
	
✓	Why do people use Twitter?
	
✓	Isn’t Twitter a huge waste of time?
	
✓	How do the creators of Twitter make money?
And in the case of people who already have a blog, the big question is, “Do I 
really need Twitter, as well?”
I hope you can forgive my answer to these questions: It’s up to you! People 
use Twitter for all kinds of reasons. I’ve seen Twitter accounts devoted to 
spiritual guidance, sports, sex, marketing, web development, and diaries. You 
name it, and someone is using Twitter to talk about it. So, explaining why you 
should use Twitter, and what you might get out of it, is pretty hard to do!
For example, the blog Foodists (www.foodists.ca) has a Twitter account 
that is regularly used to alert readers to restaurant openings, food markets, 
tastings, and of course to attract readers to the blog when there are new 
posts available. In Figure 15-1, you can see the Foodists Twitter profile page 
(www.twitter.com/foodists).

 Chapter 15: Joining the Twitterverse
The Foodists Twitter updates are also displayed on the blog, ensuring that 
the audiences for both the main blog and Twitter micro blog know what’s 
going on in each place. The goal of having both a blog and a Twitter account 
is pretty simple: Get more readers by producing different kinds of content in 
different web formats.
For most Twitter users, the first goal is communication, quickly followed 
by reaching out to more people in a format that they can use easily (and for 
free), which reaches people very quickly.
Here are just a few ways in which individuals and businesses are putting 
Twitter to work:
	
✓	Restaurants: Advertise specials, let customers know about available 
tables, and offer coupons.
	
✓	Pundits: Post links and resources to support their viewpoints.
	
✓	Friends: Coordinate get-togethers and even arrange dates.
	
✓	Conference organizers: Remind potential attendees of sign-up deadlines 
and early-bird pricing specials.
	
✓	Conference attendees: Let other attendees know about good speakers 
(and snacks) and keep those who aren’t attending up to date.
	
✓	Celebrities: Extend their personal brand and identity by talking about 
their projects.
	
✓	Characters from popular television shows: Carry on dialogue with view­
ers between episodes — written by the show’s writers, actors, or mar­
keting folks.
	
✓	Political candidates: Update voters about their policies and appear­
ances.
	
✓	Emergency services: Update followers about operations. In 2009, the 
Australian County Fire Authority used Twitter to send out alerts and 
updates about the Black Saturday bushfires that killed 173 people and 
injured more than 400.
Twitter updates have a lot of potential to inform and entertain. To get a sense 
of the mechanics of using Twitter, follow these basic steps:
	
1.	Sign up for a Twitter account and choose a nickname.
	
	 When you set up your account, you can choose to share your updates — 
called tweets — with anyone (meaning the public) or to restrict access 
to only the people you choose to follow.
	
2.	Customize your icon and profile page to make them reflect your per­
sonality or brand.

3.	Run your contact list through Twitter to see if any of your friends, 
family, and colleagues are on Twitter.
	
	 If any of them are on Twitter, decide whether you want to follow their 
updates.
	
4.	Post updates.
	
	 You can tweet about anything, from news about your plans, your 
thoughts, or activities.
	
	 People who follow you on Twitter see your updates. On the web, 
updates appear right when you post them to Twitter. Followers who 
have their phones configured to do so get your updates as text mes­
sages and can respond to them by sending a text message to a number 
provided by Twitter. If you have an iPhone, iPad, Blackberry, Windows 
7, or Android phone, you can install the Twitter application to use the 
network that way.
Following people on Twitter is equivalent to making them into a friend or con­
tact on other social networks; Twitter simply calls those folks who read your 
updates followers. Like with other social networks, the number of followers 
you have indicates your popularity, and a lot of people focus on getting those 
numbers high.
The really neat thing about Twitter is that you can participate without ever 
visiting the Twitter website. Twitter’s designed so that you can handle the 
whole thing by mobile phone text messaging and apps, keeping you updated 
with a device that you probably already have close to hand.
Getting Started
I’m a big fan of learning by doing, so in the following sections, I walk you 
through signing up for Twitter and getting started. I get the easy job — get­
ting you started with Twitter. You have the hard job of figuring out what to 
tweet about!
Signing up for an account
Follow these steps to set up a Twitter account:
	
1.	Point your web browser to www.twitter.com.
	
	 The Twitter home page opens.
	
2.	Enter your first and last name in the Full Name field.
	
	 You’re limited to 20 characters in this field.

3.	Provide an e-mail address to use with your Twitter account in the 
Email field.
	
4.	Create a password in the Password field.
	
5.	Click Sign Up.
	
	 Twitter loads the Create an Account page, which confirms the informa­
tion you already provided.
	
6.	Choose a Twitter username and type it in the Username field.
	
	 Unlike some social networks, you can change your username later.
	
	 Your username is limited to 15 characters, and while you type in your 
desired username, Twitter checks to see whether it’s available. If you 
don’t get a green OK message (see Figure 15-2), try again until you find 
an available username.
	
7.	Click Create My Account.
	
	 Twitter creates your new account and loads the Who to Follow page. 
You also receive an e-mail that contains your new account information 
at the address you used to sign up.

Finding friends to follow
After you set up your account, you can let Twitter help you find friends, family, 
and colleagues who are also Twitter users by giving the service access to your 
contact lists in Gmail, Yahoo!, or AOL. If you don’t have contact lists with any 
of these tools, click the Skip This Step link at the bottom of this screen.
To let Twitter access your contact list in an online e-mail tool and find people 
to follow, follow these steps:
	
1.	On the Find Friends page, click Search Contacts beside the name of 
the service that you use to keep track of your contacts, such as Gmail.
	
	 Twitter loads a login information screen.
	
2.	Provide your login information for the service to which you want to 
give Twitter access, such as your e-mail address and password.
	
	 Twitter doesn’t keep this information; you’re granting the company only 
one-time access to your contact list.
	
	 If you are already logged into the service you use for contacts, Twitter 
gives you a screen requesting access to the service.
	
3.	Review the provided list of contacts who have Twitter accounts, and 
follow the provided instructions to select those you wish to follow.
	
	 Twitter connects to the service and loads your contact informa­
tion, matching the e-mail addresses from your list against the e-mail 
addresses of other Twitter users.
	
	 You can always add more people later.
	
4.	Select anyone from the Look Who Else Is Here page whom you want to 
follow and click Finish.
	
	 If you prefer not to follow any of these popular Twitter users, simply 
click Finish without selecting any of them.
	
	 Twitter loads your personal home page, which displays messages from 
all the people you’re following.
	
If you’d prefer not to run your contact list through Twitter, you can easily 
search for individual users by clicking the Find People link that appears in the 
navigation area at the top of all Twitter pages and then using the search tools 
provided.
Twittering
After you sign up for a Twitter account, it’s time for the fun part — your first 
tweet! You can send a tweet pretty darn easily from the website. Follow these 
steps:

 Chapter 15: Joining the Twitterverse
	
1.	Point your browser to www.twitter.com and log into Twitter if you 
aren’t already logged in.
	
	 Twitter loads your personal home page, which displays messages from 
all the people you’re following.
	
2.	Type your tweet into the What’s Happening? field at the top of the page.
	
	 While you type, watch the number at the bottom of the field; it tells you 
the number of characters still available.
	
3.	Click Tweet (see Figure 15-3).
	
	 Twitter posts your tweet into your message stream, where your follow­
ers can read and respond to it. If any of them subscribe to your updates 
with their phones, they receive a text message that contains your tweet.
Posting a tweet is just the beginning. Other kinds of messages include the 
following:
	
✓	@ messages: When you want to direct a message to a specific person, 
but still include it in your main message stream (which means all your 
followers, and possibly the public, can see it), start your message with 
the @ symbol followed by the username of the person. For example
@b4dbook i’m reading your chapter on Twitter right now!

Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
	
	To view these messages quickly, click the @Mentions tab in the main 
column of your Twitter page, as shown in Figure 15-4.
	
✓	Direct messages: You send direct messages to only a specific Twitter user, 
and they don’t appear in the general message stream. To send a direct 
message, visit the user’s profile page and click the Message icon in from 
the right navigation; it looks like a small envelope. Or preface your message 
in the What’s Happening? field with a d and the username. For example
d hopstudios thanks!
	
	Be careful sending direct messages — you can too easily post things 
publicly that you meant to be private!
	
✓	Retweets: Do you see a tweet in your stream that you want to rebroad­
cast to all your followers? That’s called retweeting. To retweet, simply 
put your mouse over the tweet, and the Retweet link will become vis­
ible. Click the link, and the tweet is automatically sent to your follow­
ers. Alternatively, you can copy and paste the text of the tweet into the 
What’s Happening? field, preface it with RT, and even add your own 
remark, as below:
that makes so much sense! RT @dbarefoot On a similar 
bent, there’s a great quote about creativity being 
something plus frequent iteration.
	
	It’s considered good form to include the username of the person you’re 
retweeting.

Exploring the Settings
You can personalize your Twitter home and profile pages in a lot of ways, 
and of course, you can also update your account information, change your 
username and password, and so on. You can make all these changes on the 
Settings page, which you access by clicking the drop-down menu at the top 
right of any Twitter page. The Settings page includes the following areas:
	
✓	Account settings: Change the e-mail address at which Twitter contacts 
you and your username. You can also customize the following:
 
• Language: Select the language you tweet in.
 
• Time Zone: Make sure Twitter knows your time zone.
 
• Tweet Location: This geo-location service tells your followers 
exactly where you are in the world.
 
• Tweet Media: Opt to see photos and videos from any tweet in your 
Timeline, instead of only those from people you follow directly.
 
• Tweet Privacy: Control who can see your tweets by requiring 
authorization for each new follower request.
 
• Always use HTTPS: Encrypt your account information for better 
security.
	
✓	Password: Change your password. You need to know your current pass­
word in order to change it.
	
✓	Mobile: Set up your phone to receive tweets from Twitter. I cover this 
setup fully in the following section.
	
✓	Notifications: Decide whether you want to receive e-mail messages 
when you get a new follower, receive a direct message, are retweeted or 
mentioned, or subscribe to the Twitter e-mail newsletter.
	
✓	Profile: Customize your Twitter icon by uploading a photo or other 
graphic. Businesses often choose to display a logo as their icon. You can 
also provide your:
 
• Location: Let people know where you are on the globe.
 
• Web: Your profile displays this URL, so you can send people to 
your home page quickly.
 
• Bio: Give people a little bit of background about who you are.
	
✓	Design: Select a new theme for the look and feel of your Twitter pages, 
upload your own custom background image, or even change the back­
ground, text, and link colors.

Twittering with Your Mobile Phone
Twitter is intended for use with your mobile phone, either by receiving and 
sending tweets as text messages or by using one of the device-specific pieces 
of software that interface with Twitter.
Tweeting from your phone
When you want to use your mobile phone to tweet, you first need to let 
Twitter know about your phone by setting it up on the Mobile Settings page. 
Follow these steps:
	
1.	Point your web browser to www.twitter.com, sign in if you need to, 
and choose Settings from the menu at the top-right of the page.
	
	 The Settings page loads.
	
2.	Click the Mobile tab from the Settings menu at the top of the page.
	
3.	Choose your country/region.
	
4.	Fill in your mobile phone number and, if desired, select the check box 
labeled Let Others Find Me by My Phone Number.
	
5.	Choose your text messaging language.
	
6.	Click Start.
	
	 Remember, depending on your mobile phone plan, it may cost money 
for you to receive and/or send text messages on your phone. Check with 
your service provider to see what is and isn’t included in your plan! 
If you don’t have an unlimited text message plan, be sparing with the 
number of Twitter feeds sent to your phone.
	
7.	From your phone, send a text message as directed to the number pro­
vided on the Twitter site.
	
	 If you send this text correctly, you receive a text message from Twitter, 
confirming that you’ve signed up.
	
8.	Refresh the Mobile page on the Twitter website and customize what 
kinds of text messages you want and the hours you want to receive 
them.
From this point on, you can post tweets from your phone. Simply text the 
same number to which you sent your confirmation code. In the United States, 
the number is 40404; in Canada it is 21212. When you send a text message 
to that number, the text message is posted as a tweet on your account, and 
your followers can read it.

 Chapter 15: Joining the Twitterverse
Receiving selected tweets on your phone
You can request to receive the tweets of people you’re following as text mes­
sages. I recommend you be selective about this option! For example, I follow 
several hundred people by using Twitter, but I want to hear from only a hand­
ful of friends and family at the moment they tweet and as a text message.
To get someone’s tweets on your phone, follow these steps:
	
1.	Point your web browser to www.twitter.com and sign in, if you 
need to.
	
	 Twitter loads your personal home page.
	
2.	Click the Following link in the right navigation area.
	
	 Twitter displays a list of all the users you’re following on Twitter.
	
3.	Find a user whose tweets you want to receive as text messages and 
click that user.
	
	 Twitter loads a basic profile on the right side of the page.
	
4.	Click the tiny phone icon next to the Following button.
	
	 The icon turns green — you’ve just turned on text message updates 
from that user.
	
	 To turn off text message updates, repeat these steps, but click the green 
icons.
Tying Your Blog into Twitter
Some bloggers have set up a system that automatically tweets about their 
blog posts. If you want to use this system, explore Twitterfeed (www.
twitterfeed.com).
Setting up such a system is pretty simple, really. If your blog has an RSS feed 
(see Chapter 14), you simply point Twitterfeed at both the feed and your 
Twitter account. Whenever you post a new blog update, a tweet containing 
the blog post title and URL is added to your Twitter feed.
	
Tweeting about your blog posts can really help to drive traffic to your blog, 
but some users find the impersonality of this kind of message irritating. Be 
aware of what your audience is looking for if you decide to go this route.
You can also put a widget on your blog itself that shares your Twitter posts 
with your blog visitors (and invites them to follow you!). To do this, follow 
these steps:

1.	Sign in or create an account on Twitter (www.twitter.com) and click the 
Resources navigation link at the right-hand column of any Twitter page.
	
	 Twitter loads the Resources page.
	
2.	Click the Widgets item.
	
	 The Select Your Widget screen appears.
	
3.	Click My Website in the left navigation panel, and then Profile Widget 
from the center of the page.
	
	 The Customize Your Profile Widget screen opens.
	
4.	Customize the Preferences, Appearance, or Dimensions to suit your 
blog from the navigation menu on the left.
	
	 A preview of your badge appears on the right side of the page, as shown 
in Figure 15-5.
	
5.	Click Finish & Grab Code when your badge looks the way that you 
want it to.
	
	 Twitter displays the code for your badge.
	
6.	Copy the code and go to your blog so that you can paste that code into 
your sidebar.

Diving Into Social Networking

E

ver been “liked” on Facebook? Done any tweeting lately? What about 
endorsing someone on LinkedIn? Is this all gibberish to you? Welcome to 
the world of social networking, the hottest topic online in the last few years.
At first glance, social networking can look overwhelming and difficult to 
understand because it uses a lot of jargon, and so many players are in the 
field. Never fear, however. Social networking is a simple concept: You can 
meet others online by using a website or online service. At the very heart of 
it, social networking is the simple process of finding people you want to hang 
out with, or connecting online with people you already hang out with.
The web has opened the door to meeting people who share your interests, 
but whose geography or professional careers — to name just a couple of 
possibilities — made it unlikely you would ever meet in “real” life. Social-
networking websites are designed to bring together people who share hob­
bies, careers, friends, geographic regions, and other interests, and then 
encourage communication and sharing. And believe me, social-networking 
sites exist for everything under the sun!
In this chapter, I introduce you to some of today’s most popular social-
networking tools and show you how they can tie into your blogging efforts.
Thinking Strategically
Social networks allow you to connect with current friends and make new 
ones while sharing photos, videos, text, and more. They’ve exploded in popu­
larity in the last few years, and many social networks have even added blog­
ging tools. From Twitter to Facebook, these tools are proliferating, and their 
quality is improving. Social networking can build:

✓	Friendships: You can form long-lasting bonds with people you meet 
online. By building your social network, you inevitably find others who 
share your interests.
	
✓	Communities: Connecting with other people is one of the greatest ways 
to improve your blogging experience. Other bloggers are using social 
networks to connect with those who share their interests and passions.
	
✓	Audience: Bring more eyeballs to your blog. The fact that these eyeballs 
belong to folks you already have things in common with — well, that’s a 
bonus!
	
In general, social networks that have blogging tools are good for, well, social 
networking. If you’re starting a business or professional blog, these blogging 
tools were once considered “amateurish” or unprofessional. Over the last 
couple of years, that attitude has changed dramatically. It is now a require­
ment that professional bloggers use social media tools to promote them­
selves. If you aren’t, you are considered outdated and lacking in knowledge. 
These days it is hip to be square, and it can pay off with more blog traffic.
Many blogs include a feature on each post that allows you to share the post 
and a link to it on many social networks. You can add this feature to your 
own blog if your blog software has these tools built in, or by implementing 
the ShareThis service (www.sharethis.com). I cover ShareThis in detail 
later in this chapter.
Because this book talks about blogging, I focus mainly on how social net­
works can benefit your blog. You may forget that, sometimes, you also need 
to select social networks that work for you, overall. The following sections 
give you some tips on choosing a network or networks.
Connecting with your audience
The key is to know your audience and to choose what information to share. 
The more information you share among the social networks you use, the 
more attention you can bring to your blog. You must take the time to identify 
your audience and choose networks where that audience is active. Be sure 
that the social networks where you spend time are those that likely can repay 
that effort.
You can tie your blog and your social networks together, letting blog read­
ers know about your actions on social networks and vice versa. The payoff? 
More readers and, hopefully, more readers from the audience that you’re 
trying to attract.

 Chapter 16: Diving Into Social Networking
Essentially, if you participate in a social-networking site that has something 
to do with the topic of your blog, the friends you make on that network natu­
rally fit into your target audience. And the readers of your blog are also likely 
to want to join your social network, bringing along with them their groups 
of friends, family, and colleagues, who may in turn be interested in what you 
blog about. That’s the idea, anyway!
These sites can attract huge audiences, and you greatly increase your ability 
to filter content through to groups who are most interested in what you have 
to say on your blog. The friends and contacts you make through social net­
works may very well be hungry for good blogs to read.
Selecting networks
Integrating social networks into your online activities and your blog does 
require some planning. With so many options, how do you determine which 
networks to spend time in? You could just dive in and sign up for a bunch 
of social networks, then see where the chips fall, but if you want your time 
spent using social networks to pay off, consider the following questions:
	
✓	What do you want to accomplish with your online efforts?
	
✓	What networks does your current readership use? What about your 
friends and family?
	
	If you’re unsure what networks you have to choose from, the section 
“Getting Familiar with Social Networks,” later in this chapter, introduces 
you to a variety of popular networks.
	
✓	Which networks have the coolest designs and best functionalities?
	
✓	How active is your audience on social networks? What do they seem to 
be getting out of that interaction?
	
✓	Is your blog content subject-appropriate for any particular social net­
works? On the flip side, is your blog inappropriate for any of them?
	
✓	Does your audience want to know about you in ways that a social-
networking tool might fulfill?
	
✓	How much time do you want to spend playing around with social 
networks?
You need to consider these types of questions when you’re looking to fit a 
social network into your blogging life. Take a look at where your readers are 
coming from and, using the analytics information that you should be collect­
ing for your blog (see Chapter 17), find out what attracts visitors to your site.

Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
Post a question on your blog about a social-networking website, and solicit 
responses and advice.
The social-networking online realm is a bit of a Wild West scenario: Everyone’s 
experimenting to find out what works and what doesn’t. So, jump in the saddle, 
pardner!
Protecting your privacy online
You may worry about the security of your identity online if you’re jumping 
headlong into the social-networking world.
	
Be smart. Don’t post information on any social-networking website that you 
feel is inappropriate. You want to keep certain bits of information private. If 
a social-networking website asks you to provide information that you aren’t 
comfortable sharing, don’t share it. If the website insists you share that infor­
mation, don’t use that service. It’s as simple as that.
If you’re at all concerned about your security online, make sure you check 
regularly with your bank and any credit card company you deal with. Some 
financial institutions are taking new and additional precautions to make sure 
that your security and identity remain private.
	
Social networks often feel safer than the Internet at large because they require 
membership and logins, and of course, profiles of your new friends often 
include photos and other elements that look convincingly real. However, 
remember that these sites offer very little barrier to creating an account — 
the accounts are free, the services don’t require identity verification, and the 
social networks can’t prevent people from including misleading information or 
outright lying about who they are.
So, remain vigilant. If you’re aware of what information you place online, you 
should be able to protect yourself without much of a concern. Just like writ­
ing on your blog, consider using this guideline: If you wouldn’t blog it, don’t 
social network it.
Getting Familiar with Social Networks
Almost any interest group and almost any method of sharing has a social net­
work. Deciding which ones to try out depends on what you want to get out of 
the social networking. If you’re a photographer, social websites such as Flickr

 Chapter 16: Diving Into Social Networking
(which allows you to share photos) may be your cup of tea. If you like to read 
books and talk about them, LibraryThing and Goodreads may be the places 
to hang out.
In the following sections, I show you some of the most popular (and some of 
my favorites) so that you can get familiar with social-networking sites and 
decide where to get started.
	
You can find many more sites that I don’t have the space to cover in this book, 
so make this chapter a starting point while you explore social networks.
Friend-based networks
Social networks are never really all that general, but the most popular social 
networks allow their users to share almost anything, from photos to friends 
to games. Social networks such as Facebook simply try to throw everything 
and the kitchen sink into the mix; others, such as Twitter, go with a more 
minimal approach.
Here are two all-purpose social networks:
	
✓	Facebook (www.facebook.com): Facebook is one of the most popular 
social-networking platforms. It boasts a user base of more than 300 
million — and that number gets bigger every day. Started in 2004 by 
Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook was initially intended to be a communica­
tion tool for university students but quickly grew beyond that audience.
	
	The service allows users to share photos, audio, and video; install 
apps, such as games and horoscopes; and friend others. Friending is the 
method of identifying people you want in your network. On most social 
networks, Facebook included, friends are entitled to see more of your 
shared information than other members of the network.
	
	For more information about Facebook security settings, check out 
Facebook For Dummies, written by Carolyn Abram and Leah Pearlman 
(John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).
	
	Not surprisingly, you can also post messages and short status updates, 
and you can set up your profile to let others know when you post to 
your blog. You can install widgets on your blog that automatically post a 
Facebook update when you create a new post (see Figure 16-1).

Figure 16-1:

friends.
	
	
✓	Twitter (www.twitter.com): Micro blogging is all the rage on today’s 
World Wide Web, particularly as mobile-phone technology has really 
taken off in North America. Twitter is a micro-blogging tool that allows 
you to post small bursts of text, called tweets, about your plans, 
thoughts, and activities. Following other people’s Twitter feeds means 
that you can stay abreast of their activities, as well. You can handle the 
whole Twitter experience by mobile phone text messaging, keeping you 
updated by using a device that you probably already have close at hand.
	
	Though you can post up to only 140 characters of text at a time, you can 
use Twitter to share photographs, links, and even videos. Many busi­
nesses have jumped onto the Twitter bandwagon and use the tool to 
let their customers know about sales, specials, and other news. I cover 
Twitter in detail in Chapter 15.
Hobby-based networks
If you’re a bookworm like me, hold on to your hat. A number of social-net­
working sites are designed specifically to let you catalog your bookshelves, 
find cool books to read, and chat with other book lovers.

The same is true of music lovers; you can share your musical tastes with 
others online and get suggestions for new music that you may like. Some 
services even allow you to listen to full tracks of music, or you can listen to 
bite-sized chunks.
The fun doesn’t stop there, either. If you have a hobby that you share with 
a large enough group, you can probably find a social network out there 
designed just for you. Here are a few of my favorites:
	
✓	LibraryThing (www.librarything.com): A great website that allows 
you to share books that you’re reading. You can catalog your collection 
and find information about your books by using a variety of libraries, 
such as Amazon.com or the Library of Congress.
	
	The tie-in with your blog? Widgets let you share what you’re reading and 
have read with your blog visitors.
	
✓	Goodreads (www.goodreads.com): Goodreads is another social book-
cataloging website that allows you to build virtual bookshelves of books 
that you’ve read or want to read. You can recommend books to others, 
compare what you’re reading with others in the forums, and even run a 
book club.
	
	Some of my friends who share my taste in books find the site useful for 
choosing what to read next, by keeping track of the ratings others post 
for books they’ve read. I really like using it to keep track of the books I 
want to read next, so that I don’t have to keep all that information in my 
head. And, of course, there are widgets for your blog (not to mention for 
Facebook and MySpace).
	
✓	Last.fm (www.last.fm): Founded in 2002, Last.fm (shown in Figure 
16-2) is a social-networking site that allows you to share your musical 
tastes. You can track the music you’re listening to and share what types 
of music you enjoy with others. If you install Last.fm’s audioscrobbling 
widget, it records automatically whatever music you play on your com­
puter, phone, or MP3 player. It then posts this information on your pro­
file on the website.
	
	Over time, you can see what music you listen to most often, and then 
the website and the community can make suggestions about what other 
music you may want to check out. You can tie Last.fm widgets to your 
blog so that your readers can subscribe to your music playlist and also 
be your listeners.

music that 
you may

✓	Blip.fm (www.blip.fm): Blip.fm is another, and more recent, addition to 
the music social-networking realm. This tool is tied closely to Twitter, so 
users of the one social network get the benefit of the other.
	
	Blip.fm allows you to sign up, identify your friends, search the web for 
music that you want to recommend (or just listen to), and then build a 
playlist based on the results. Do you have a friend who has impeccable 
musical taste? Get him or her signed up for Blip.fm, and then listen to 
his or her playlist. This site also allows you to give props (as in praise) 
to users who blip (post) a song you like, giving feedback about what you 
want more of.
	
	You can even link your Last.fm account to Blip.fm and let your computer 
do all the work of blipping songs for you.
	
✓	Ravelry (www.ravelry.com): This chapter wouldn’t be complete 
without a mention of my favorite social network of all time, Ravelry. I 
admit, it may not be your favorite! Ravelry is a social network designed 
for knitters to share information about what they’re making or thinking 
of making, how they did it, and other such conversation. You can add 
friends and send messages, and of course, if you have a knitting blog, 
you can pull your blog posts into Ravelry and get your friends from 
Ravelry over to your blog.

Professional networks
The business world has latched onto social networking, as well. Many busi­
nesses are using social-networking tools to find new clients, build more cre­
ative advertising, and create a conversation with the public. Many of them 
use the existing popular social networks, from Facebook to Twitter, but the 
big player in business-related social networking is LinkedIn.
LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com) claims to have more than 45 million users, 
and it targets its service to your professional life. Looking to find a new 
employee or a new job? LinkedIn can put you in touch with others in your 
industry, recommend partners, help you locate contractors, and generally 
get the lowdown on those you work with.
One of the most useful features of LinkedIn is that your profile looks much 
like a résumé, so you can refer people you want to work with to your 
LinkedIn profile. You can also connect with past and present colleagues, and 
make use of their networks so that you can make connections with people 
they interact with. The business world can become a surprisingly small 
place, thanks to these connections. In fact, I used LinkedIn to make contact 
with many of the businesses that I discuss in this book by putting my own 
network to use.
Media-sharing networks
The web has allowed all of us to share more than just text — you can easily 
display video, audio, and photos online, and a number of social-networking 
sites let you do just that, regardless of whether you have a website or blog. 
Here are the big hitters:
	
✓	Flickr (www.flickr.com): Flickr is one of the most successful social 
networks going. Flickr allows you to post and store your photographs 
and even videos online. You can share these photos and videos with the 
community at large, as well as your friends and family. Viewers can mark 
each photo as a favorite, and they can also leave comments and feed­
back for you.
	
	You can use Flickr to build albums and galleries of your photos, and 
even slideshows. Best of all, you can place your photos online with 
Flickr, and then quickly and easily embed those photos into your blog 
posts (see Chapter 11).

Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
	
✓	YouTube (www.youtube.com): For those video bloggers out there, 
YouTube is probably the most popular social-networking video plat­
form online today. People from all over the world record, edit, and post 
videos, and then share them with the YouTube community. You can 
post these videos and also embed them into your website or blog.
Informational networks
Initially, social bookmarking was just an online service that allowed you to 
save all your bookmarks without worrying about whether you’d lose them. 
As social networking became more popular, social-bookmarking websites got 
into the act and began to offer all kinds of ways in which you can share your 
bookmarks with others or discover new and interesting websites to visit. Use 
these sites to organize your bookmarks, recommend websites, and web surf:
	
✓	Delicious (www.delicious.com): Early on in the life of the web, some­
one realized that we all spent a lot of time e-mailing each other links 
(“You have to see this; it’s hilarious!”) and that a more efficient way to 
share that kind of information probably existed. Enter Delicious.
	
	Delicious (see Figure 16-3) enables you to record and tag links for later 
retrieval. You no longer have to be at the same computer to remember 
what websites you’ve visited or bookmarked. You can make your book­
marks private or share them with the public. This incredibly easy-to-use 
social-bookmarking service is also incredibly powerful. You can share 
your bookmarks by using the built-in RSS feeds and by sharing your 
bookmarks with your personal network of other users.
	
	Social bookmarking is a little different than creating bookmarks of sites 
that you go to often, which you probably already do with your browser. 
I use Delicious to keep track of research around a particular topic — for 
example, looking up activities to do on my next trip to Asia.
	
✓	StumbleUpon (www.stumbleupon.com): Many people have called 
StumbleUpon one of the biggest time wasters online today. But that isn’t 
actually a bad thing. Web surfing is a time-honored way of negotiating 
the World Wide Web; and StumbleUpon simply acknowledges that fact, 
and then gives you some outstanding tools for more efficiently and intel­
ligently surfing.
	
	With StumbleUpon, users post and recommend interesting things that 
they find on the web, and others view those recommendations and add 
their own endorsements, effectively creating a snapshot of the most 
interesting and compelling links on the web. You can imagine how useful 
sharing becomes when you create a community on StumbleUpon of your 
friends and colleagues; if you combine their recommendations with the 
personalization options that StumbleUpon provides, it’s like reading a 
personalized (albeit somewhat eccentric) newspaper.

Location-based networks
A bunch of networks allow you to post your location on a map or track your 
(and your friends’) geographic whereabouts. Typically, these kind of social-
networking applications need a little forethought before you use them. Do 
you really want your colleagues to know where you are at all times? I didn’t 
think so. But these kinds of programs can help you create impromptu coffee 
meetings or figure out whether someone you want to see is “checked in” 
nearby. Many location-based networks also give you information based your 
current location for nearby great places to eat, shop, or visit.
	
These services are really designed for mobile phone users who have signed up 
for data plans.
Try these networks on for size:
	
✓	foursquare (www.foursquare.com): foursquare allows you to use 
your phone as a GPS device. It tracks your location, checks you in at 
the places you visit, and awards points for everywhere you go. If you’re 
the most frequent visitor to a location in a 30-day period, foursquare 
declares you the mayor of that location, and you can also earn badges. 
Foursquare has some handy apps for different types of phones as well 
as a mobile phone website version.

	Some businesses are rewarding users with freebies and recognition. 
You can link your foursquare account with your Twitter and Facebook 
updates.
	
✓	Gowalla (www.gowalla.com): Gowalla is a popular location-based 
social-networking website. It offers applications for iPhone/iPad, 
BlackBerry, Palm, and Android mobile devices. You can share pictures 
of your location, and people may leave comments on your “check-in.” 
	
✓	Google Latitude (www.google.com/latitude): Google Latitude (see 
Figure 16-4) is another location-aware mobile application that allows 
you to share your current location and keeps track of places you’ve 
been. You can have this application automatically update with your 
whereabouts, or you can manually add your check-in points. The appli­
cation plots your updates on a Google Map for your friends to view. The 
application is available for many mobile platforms, including iPhone and 
BlackBerry.

Sharing It All
Clearly, there are many social networks, widgets, and bits of code you can 
choose to include on your blog. You can spend a lot of time customizing, but 
I have good news. If you would like to make the pages of your blog easy for 
your visitors to share with others via social networks, there is an easy way to 
get the job done.
	
ShareThis (www.sharethis.com) has the solution. Sign up with this free ser­
vice and add the code to your site so that you can quickly and easily add all 
those tools to your site in a single step.
You can see the ShareThis widget implemented on the blog for this book in 
Figure 16-5. Clicking the ShareThis link opens a small window in the page that 
visitors can use to select where they would like to share your content.

You can customize the ShareThis widget to control which sharing tools show 
up in the window. The neatest feature, however, is that ShareThis tracks the 
data of those who use the ShareThis tool on your site, so you can find out 
more about the ways in which people share content, as well as which stories 
or blog posts attract the most attention!

or a moment, picture your new blog running just the way you want it. 
The graphics are pretty, you’re blogging every day, and comments are 
rolling in. Everything looks perfect, and you seem to be well on your way to a 
successful blogging career. But wait! For no real reason, over a few weeks, the 
number of comments left on your blog each day starts to decrease. Your visi­
tor numbers are down. You don’t find an obvious explanation, and you can’t 
imagine why your readership is disappearing so quickly!
If you ever find yourself in this type of situation, you may start to ask your­
self questions such as, “How many visitors do I have every day, anyway?” or 
“How many of my visitors have been here before?”
It’s time to understand your web traffic statistics. You, as a blogger, may find 
web stats especially important because your audience numbers are affected 
each time you post, versus the kind of traffic a static website generates.
You must pay attention to how your blog is performing on the Internet, but 
it can be confusing and boring. Spending an afternoon peering at web stats, 
especially if you don’t know what you’re looking for, can be a tedious experi­
ence. It’s like . . . well, it’s like watching paint dry. But it doesn’t have to be as 
painful as it sounds. Web statistics are very geeky, but these days, you can 
choose from services available to bloggers (and webmasters, in general) that 
allow you to track your blog’s success in interesting and informative ways by 
using a friendly interface.

Exploring the Power of Statistics
Even if you like the way your blog is performing, you should take a look at 
your blog stats once in a while. Some bloggers look at them daily to see what 
kinds of visitors appeared on their blogging radar overnight; some blog­
gers check their stats once a week or once a month. Whichever pattern you 
choose, keep a good handle on your statistics. Knowing how many visitors 
you have can help you improve your blog in the future, making it even more 
popular.
For an example of what a typical web-stats tool looks like, check out 
StatCounter’s measurement of the Find-A-Sweetheart website (www.find-
a-sweetheart.com) in Figure 17-1. (You have to be logged in if you want to 
view stats on StatCounter.)
Using web statistics, you can track
	
✓	What countries your web visitors are surfing from
	
✓	How long visitors stay
	
✓	How many visitors check out your site for the first time
	
✓	How many visitors have been to your blog before

With some of the more advanced web analytics software, you can see what 
pages are the least popular, find out how search engines handle your blog, 
and even see what errors or missing pages your visitors get when they try to 
access parts of your site. (If you have removed an old blog post or renamed 
a posting, your statistics will tell you which pages are missing.) A lot of blog­
gers particularly want to know what websites are sending visitors to their 
blogs so that they can figure out where to invest time and energy in com­
ments and discussion forums.
	
Knowing even a little bit about your traffic can help you make all kinds of stra­
tegic decisions about your blog, from what kind of design to use to the subject 
of a post.
Blog stats become even more useful when you begin analyzing them. Web 
analytics are the trends that your statistical or log software shows you. Some 
traffic software helps break down these trends for you, but the most basic 
software simply displays the raw data about how visitors use your site and 
lets you draw the conclusions. When people talk about web analytics, they’re 
referring to the process that you undertake when you’re looking through 
those stats and logs to figure out what visitors are doing on your website. 
Commonly, you look for trends about what content the visitors view, how 
often they visit, and what other sites direct traffic your way.
	
Pay close attention to your website logs so that you can chart what your 
users are doing over time. You can see what your site visitors are reading and 
what keeps them coming back for more. You can then use this information 
for a variety of purposes (such as deciding what to blog about). The following 
examples illustrate how gathering your blog’s statistics and interpreting them 
can be useful:
	
✓	You notice that a large bunch of readers are coming from a particu­
lar country (see Figure 17-2), and you don’t live in that country. In 
this case, you should see what pages those visitors are viewing — and 
determine why they’re coming to your site. You can then write more 
to attract additional visitors who have similar tastes. In fact, noticing a 
trend such as this one might help you focus on a core audience that you 
didn’t even know about. You can even redefine what you do with your 
blog in the future.

✓	You have ads on your blog (see Chapter 18), and more people are 
clicking a certain type of advertisement. If you take the time, you can 
see what kinds of visitors are clicking advertisements on your site (if 
you have any ads, of course). You can use information about what ads 
your visitors click to sell ad space to certain advertisers.
	
You may have trouble staying away from your blog’s web stats, and you might 
want to check them daily. But don’t forget that you have a blog to run, which 
requires that you focus on the quality of the content you produce for your 
community. Try to avoid an obsession over your web statistics because no 
amount of tinkering with web analytics can make your blog popular. Your con­
tent is the only thing that can accomplish that feat.
Knowing What the Statistics Mean
To understand what you’re looking at when you scan your web statistics or 
server logs, you need to know a series of terms. Most web analytics software 
uses these terms, but you should always check to see how the software’s cre­
ators define measurements. Web analytics software tends to use these terms 
in the same way, but not always. I cover the most vital terms in the following 
sections.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

295
 Chapter 17: Measuring Blog Presence
	
You’ll run into more terms than the ones I cover in this chapter, but the most 
important ones for bloggers are page views, unique visitors, and repeat visitors. 
Together, these three statistics give you the most accurate picture of how 
many visitors your blog receives and what they do while they visit.
I also introduce you to what the term hits means, which new bloggers often 
find misleading, and how statistics can help you resolve errors on your blog.
Hits
A hit is an official request from a web browser for a file from the web server. 
The file can be an HTML file or a movie file. Essentially, accessing any file 
available on a web server to the surfing public counts as a hit.
	
Any given web page causes multiple hits on the server when it loads, even 
though it’s only one page. Multiple files are actually called to display the page: 
the HTML file, any associated style documents, and all the image files. If an 
HTML file has five images, it counts as six hits — one for the HTML file and 
five for each individual image.
A lot of people think that hits indicate the number of website visitors or even 
the number of pages viewed, but hits don’t even come close to measuring 
those kinds of figures. Hits are pretty meaningless if you’re trying to under­
stand how many visitors you have, but they can help you get a feel for the 
traffic load that your site puts on the web server.
Page views
A page view is normally defined as a page within a web server log; if the 
web browser requests an HTML file, the log records that as a single request, 
even if the server needs several files to display the page. Each time the web 
browser loads a page of your site, it counts as a page view. Page views are a 
valuable measurement because you can get a better understanding of how 
people actually use your site.
In Figure 17-3, you can see the page views for September 30, 2009.
	
Advertisers are often very interested in the number of page views on a website 
(more is better), and most bloggers consider a high page-view number some­
thing to brag about.

loads for a 
given day.
	
Unique visitors
Unique visitors are just what they sound like — individual visitors who come 
to your website. The analytics software counts them only once, no matter 
how many pages they view or how many times they visit. When you’re look­
ing at the number of unique visitors your blog gets, take a look at what time 
period the analytics software refers to. Fifty unique visitors in one day, for 
example, is a much bigger deal than 50 unique visitors in a month.
Repeat visitors
Repeat visitors are blog readers who visit your site on more than one occa­
sion and, usually, visit multiple pages. Pay attention, just as with unique visi­
tors, to the time period this repeat-visitor number covers.
In Figure 17-4, you can see a graph that breaks down the percentages of first-
time visitors to repeat visitors on the web statistics tool StatCounter.

Errors
Most stat software tracks errors, instances when your visitors get an actual 
error message when they try to do something on your site or when they try 
to view a page that doesn’t exist anymore (or never did).
	
Track your error logs to find out where visitors are having problems — and be 
sure to fix the errors.
Getting Web Stats
You can find many statistics software applications that track web traffic avail­
able for installation on your blog. But before you get too carried away, check 
to see whether your blog host offers web traffic–tracking software or gives 
you access to your server logs.

If your web host offers stats software, review the offering carefully. You might 
not need any additional tools, or you might want to supplement the prein­
stalled tool with one of those discussed in the following sections, if only to 
check the accuracy of the numbers you’re seeing. Keep in mind that different 
applications can measure statistics differently, so the numbers may not be 
exactly the same.
	
Some bloggers like to look at the server logs for their sites. Server logs are 
simple text files that web servers generate in order to keep track of informa­
tion about who visits a web server, when, using what kind of browser, when 
errors occur, and so on.
Most web hosts provide access to stat software and server logs through an 
administrative control panel.
In the following sections, I cover the different services and software available. 
You should be able to find a service that fits your web-stats needs.
Choosing hosted statistics software
Like hosted blog software, the company that creates the hosted web statis­
tics software package also manages that software. Typically, you install the 
software by adding a chunk of HTML code to your pages, which communi­
cates with the hosted software.
A lack of standards
Currently, no official standards govern the 
world of server logs and web statistics. No 
large corporations tell anyone how to capture 
their traffic numbers, what terminology to use, 
or how to analyze the statistics. The world of 
web stats has, more or less, grown organically, 
and a set of rules around the analysis of server 
logs has emerged from the community.
The various software tools have a lot of incon­
sistency in what and how they measure statis­
tics. As a result, I commonly use two different 
programs to measure unique visitors on my own 
blog, and the two software programs rarely 
agree about what that number is. It’s a frustrat­
ing fact of life. (Between you and me, I tend to 
use the bigger number.)
Knowing about this inconsistency, you might 
want to consider using at least a couple of 
web statistics tools (I talk about the options in 
the section “Getting Web Stats,” later in this 
chapter) and comparing the results that you 
get. Different web analytics software treat 
server logs differently, and some software is 
certainly better than others. Most often, users 
prefer packages that create charts and graphs, 
which represent their data visually, making the 
numbers easier to understand quickly. Because 
no hard and fast rules exist, you’re free to do 
research into what packages can work best for 
you.

 Chapter 17: Measuring Blog Presence
Because you must be able to place some HTML code into your blog software 
templates so that it appears on every page that you want to track, blog soft­
ware that doesn’t give you the ability to add code will rule out using a hosted 
statistics solution.
Google Analytics
www.google.com/analytics
Google Analytics has a great interface with many options that you can cus­
tomize and use to analyze stats to your heart’s content. Google Analytics can 
calculate how many page views and number of visits your blog or site has 
received. The Google Analytics system (shown in Figure 17-5) is free, but it 
requires a registered Google Account (which is free, as well).
StatCounter
www.statcounter.com
StatCounter is a free, hosted statistics tracker, and new users can figure it out 
easily, thanks to good organization and explanation in the control panel.

Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
After setting up your site in StatCounter, you must insert StatCounter HTML 
code into your blog templates so that it can track every page. StatCounter mea­
sures page views and hits, of course, but also what terms your readers use in 
search engines to a Google Maps interface of where your traffic originates.
Site Meter
www.sitemeter.com
Site Meter has been around since the beginning of stat tracking on the web. 
This tool provides you with basic details about each visitor who comes to 
your blog and shows you what the visitor does while he or she is there, even 
down to what page he or she is on before leaving.
Site Meter (see Figure 17-6) has two levels of service: the free Basic edition 
and the Premium edition. The Premium edition provides more information 
than the Basic setup and grants access to a longer history of your statistics, 
but the free edition is a good starting point for new bloggers. The profes­
sional edition starts at $6.95 a month.

 Chapter 17: Measuring Blog Presence
Choosing installable statistics software
Web analytics software that you can install on your web server and manage 
on your own is called installable software. If you want to use a specific analyt­
ics package that your web host doesn’t normally provide, look into whether 
you can install software on your server. Some hosts can give you suggestions 
and may even assist you when you install analytics software.
Installed software usually measures the same metrics as hosted statistics 
software, but it does so by analyzing log files stored on your website, rather 
than gathering information when a visitor hits your site. Some web develop­
ers feel that installed software therefore provides more accurate numbers 
than hosted software, but many other web developers and bloggers hotly 
debate that opinion.
When you sign up for a web-hosting package, the web host probably has 
some kind of web statistics available to you. These packages can range from 
open source software to custom, home-grown solutions.
	
Check the technical requirements for the package that you want to install to 
be sure that your server works with it.
The Webalizer
www.mrunix.net/webalizer
The Webalizer is an open source application that you install on your server. 
Because it’s free to use, many web hosts offer it as part of their standard web 
hosting packages. Originally created in 1997, the Webalizer lets you track 
hits, page views, geographical origin of your traffic, and other data.
The Webalizer generates easy-to-read pages that show traffic to your site 
broken down by month, but you can also see traffic figures by day and even 
by hour. It offers all the usual suspects, from page views to unique visitors to 
the top referring sites.
AWStats
http://awstats.sourceforge.net
AWStats is a popular web statistics analyzer that you can install on your web 
server. Its features enable you to track not only visitors, but also streaming 
media, e-mail, and FTP transactions on your server. AWStats requires that 
you have the Perl programming language installed on your web server to 
operate. (Most web servers support this requirement.)
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
302
Part V: Marketing and Promoting Your Blog 
AWStats generates graphs and other visual indicators about the activity of 
your visitors month by month, letting you see the region and cities where 
traffic originates, as well as the operating systems and browsers that your 
visitors use, among many other measurements.
Mint
www.haveamint.com
Mint, which began in 2004 as a basic website tracking tool, has matured into 
a great service. Mint’s installable software offers the usual suspects: new and 
returning visitors, the sites from which they get to your site, search terms 
that they use to find you, and so on. Mint also looks really cool: It produces 
fun graphs and charts.
A Mint license costs $30 per site.
Finding Out What Others Are Saying
With web analytics software, you can watch the behavior of your site’s visi­
tors but you can also find out a lot by monitoring mentions of you, your blog, 
and your topic on the web (especially on your competitors’ blogs!) on other 
websites. Watching what’s going on within the blogosphere is a huge task. 
You can spend hundreds of dollars to have others do it for you, or you can 
check out some of the simple tools available on the web.
Among the simple blogosphere tools available to you are the following:
	
✓	E-mail notifications: Receive updates via e-mail about content or topics 
that you want to keep up with.
	
✓	RSS watch lists: Keep current on topics by using your favorite news­
reader software. (Read more about RSS in Chapter 14.)
You can use these tools in a variety of ways by doing random manual 
searches and installing software designed to display web information on your 
desktop.
	
The power of RSS and the syndication of news and blog feeds become appar­
ent when you start trying to monitor certain phrases and keywords. RSS is one 
of the best ways to track what people are saying about your blog and about 
topics that you’re interested in.

Google Alerts
www.google.com/alerts
Google Alerts (see Figure 17-7) provides you with e-mail notifications that it 
sends to you based on keyword searches of Google’s search system. Sign up 
for an account, and then create an alert by entering keywords about which 
you want Google Alerts to notify you.
In order to receive any e-mail from the Google Alerts system, you need to 
enter some keywords. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Go to www.google.com/alerts.
	
2.	Enter the keywords that you want to be notified about in the Search 
Terms text box.
	
3.	Select the type of web content that you want included in your search 
from the Type drop-down list.
	
	 Your options are News, Blogs, Web, Video, and Discussions.
	
4.	Select how often you want to be notified from the How Often drop-
down list.
	
	 You can select As-It-Happens, Once a Day, or Once a Week.
	
5.	Choose the quantity of results you want from the Volume drop-down 
list.
	
	 Your options are Only the Best Results and Everything.
	
6.	Type your e-mail address into the Your Email field, or select Feed.
	
	 If you are already signed into your Google account, your Gmail address 
is pre-filled.
	
	 If you select Feed, you can subscribe to these custom search results 
using a RSS reader. See Chapter 14 for more on RSS.
	
7.	Click Create Alert.
	
	 Google begins to track your search and sends you the e-mails that you 
requested at the rate you want them.
When a keyword gets a hit, you get an e-mail that includes a link to the web 
page. Google Alerts can do automatic keyword searches for all kinds of web­
sites, including blogs.

Figure 17-7: 
Google 
Alerts sends 
you e-mail 
if it hits your 
keywords in 
searches.
	
These alerts work best when you create a specific and detailed search. Think 
about how you can refine your search to keep your results to a manageable 
number. For instance, if you want to track a particular news topic, use sev­
eral keywords, rather than just one. For example, use knitting sock yarn 
hand-dyed, not just socks.
	
Set Google Alerts to search for your name, your blog name, and any keywords 
that you want to be aware of. Use these alerts to find out when people are talk­
ing about you, your blog, or the topics you’re covering.
Twitter
www.twitter.com
Twitter is a social-networking service that allows you to post online messages 
known as tweets. People can then watch your tweets, and you can watch 
theirs. Your tweets can be anything from short messages, links to websites, 
or conversations with others. You can also use Twitter to track what people 
are talking about by searching for keywords and hashtags (Twitter users 
sometimes mark keywords in their tweets with a # to set them off and make 
it easier to search for them). You can search using the Twitter search engine

dvertising on your blog has never been easier. Many different advertis­
ing systems offer bloggers a free way to place ads on their blogs, and 
businesses have picked up on the fact that blog advertising can really work. 
Putting an ad or two on your blog can help you easily earn a little money 
doing something you enjoy. Many bloggers turn a pretty penny, and some 
even earn a living, from advertising.
Ever since websites came into existence, you could find online advertise­
ments. From the first web banners of the early Internet to today’s contextual 
advertising systems, ads have run the gamut from wildly successful to a 
waste of precious bandwidth.
In some cases, the effectiveness of ads has more to do with the readers than 
anything else. On the blog for some topics, blog readers willingly look at 
ads and even click them, but audiences on other blogs just don’t have the 
patience to wade through advertisements that clutter their reading pleasure. 
So, you need to know what your audience will tolerate before you make a big 
play with ads!
Turning your blog into a retirement savings plan won’t happen overnight, 
and don’t take the addition of advertisements to the average blog lightly. 
It all requires planning, patience, and faith and trust in your readership. 
Depending on your audience, you might even need to request input from 
them about the advertisements that you choose to deploy on your blog.

Finding Out How Advertising Works
Banner ads (rectangular ads usually placed along the top of a site) used 
to dominate ad slots on the web but have become less important because 
people often just tune them out. Then, pop-up, animated, and blinking adver­
tisements generated a few clicks and ultimately managed to generate a mas­
sive backlash. Many of these moving, beeping, and blinking ads just irritated 
users, instead of successfully advertising.
Today’s contextual advertising tools are actually intelligent; ads are matched 
by subject to the words and phrases that you use on your blog. Generally, 
this approach gives you ads that better suit your readers’ interests, making 
those readers more likely to click the ads.
First, decide whether your blog is meant for an advertising campaign. Many 
blogs can benefit greatly from advertisements. However, you should think 
about a few things before diving in:
	
✓	Does your blog have a design that’s ready for ads?
	
✓	Does your blog software support the advertising system you choose?
	
✓	Will advertising earn you any money?
	
✓	Will your audience put up with ads?
Answering these questions isn’t easy; in fact, you might find it impossible 
unless you jump in. Try using some advertising and observe the results.
Planning for advertising
You can use several kinds of advertising methods to turn a blog into a place 
where you can make a tidy profit. The last few years have seen an explosion 
of companies that want a piece of the action in the blogosphere, and these 
companies have come up with creative ways to make ads easy to use, simple 
to implement, and appealing to your readers.
If you’re a new blogger or just new to advertising programs, you can easily 
latch onto the first advertising system that you find and commit to using it. 
Although this system may serve your needs well, you might want to take a 
look at some of the different ad systems available and find out about how 
advertising tends to work in the blogosphere before you start using ads.
	
While you do your research, keep in mind that if you decide to make that leap 
into monetizing your blog, you should choose software that allows you to con­
trol your advertising so that it doesn’t overwhelm the blog audience that you 
worked so hard to build.

 Chapter 18: Making Mad Mad Money
A multitude of advertising companies offer bloggers simple solutions to mon­
etize websites. Most of these programs work in similar ways but have unique 
delivery methods. Advertising programs range from text-only ads to flashy 
animations, and even full-page advertisements that really get your readers’ 
attention! As a blogger, choosing an advertising program that works for your 
audience can make the difference between an increase in readers and turning 
off your existing traffic.
Looking at the formats
You can deliver ads to a blog audience in four different ways. Additional 
methods are available, but most don’t work very well in a blog. The most 
popular advertisement formats for blogs are
	
✓	Text-based ads: These ads are text-only and feature a link or links to the 
advertiser’s website or service. Each ad is very plain, and most advertis­
ing systems limit your ability to customize their look and feel.
	
✓	Graphical banner and button ads: Banner and button ads can be static 
or animated images. These ads usually have preset sizes, but you can 
customize them to fit your blog design.
	
✓	RSS ads: Ads are a new addition to RSS feeds; while the format has taken 
off with the public, advertisers have jumped on the bandwagon. Such 
ads can include text or images, and they’re linked to the advertiser’s 
website straight from your RSS feed. See how this kind of advertising 
looks when someone views the RSS feed in a newsreader, shown in 
Figure 18-1. If you want to find out more about RSS, see Chapter 14.
	
✓	Pop-up ads: Pop-ups tend to be everyone’s least favorite type of ad, but 
oddly enough, pop-up ads that open in a new window are still quite suc­
cessful at getting people to click an advertiser’s website. The readers 
might be fairly irritated by the time they get to the site, but they do click.
	
The Interactive Advertising Bureau makes recommendations each year about 
ad sizes and standards. You might find the recommendations useful in plan­
ning for ads. Visit www.iab.net/standards/adunits.asp to see the 
options.
Most ad programs today — with the exception of sponsorships — use contex­
tual advertising, which coordinates ad display with related editorial content. 
So, a blog post about skiing might include ads for ski shops and resorts. A 
blogger who posts about blogging, for example, ends up with ads for blog 
software and tools. (I speak from experience here.)
Contextual ad systems search your blog for keywords that match products 
the advertisers have in their inventory. These ads then appear beside the 
topic keywords and, in theory, apply in the context of the web page on which 
they appear.

Cat Web Design blog, as shown in Figure 18-2.
Assessing business models
Money can flow from the advertiser to the blogger in different ways. Always 
read the terms of service for an ad program because each advertising com­
pany has a different idea about how to compensate bloggers. The usual busi­
ness models for online ads are
	
✓	Cost per impression: In this model, advertisers pay for the number 
of times a computer loads a page that displays the ad. The advertiser 
might prefer that a reader click its ad, but it recognizes that simply 
appearing on a blog that users access also has value.
	
✓	Cost per click or pay per click: The blogger makes money only when a 
reader clicks an ad and goes to the advertiser’s website. This type of ad 
is very common in contextual ad programs, as well as on search engines 
in the sponsored results section.

✓	Cost per action: The advertiser pays only when the reader actually takes 
action after he or she views and clicks the ad on the blog. This required 
action can include anything from signing up to receive more information 
to actually purchasing a product.
	
✓	Sponsorships: When an advertiser wants to be actively associated with 
the content of your blog, it might offer to sponsor the blog or some part 
of the blog. A sponsorship usually includes premium advertisements 
and exclusive ad placement, and the blogger sometimes even thanks the 
sponsor in the editorial content of the site. See “Seeking Sponsorships” 
later in this chapter.
	
A lot of bloggers have had the same great idea about the ads on their blogs: 
“I’ll just click these myself and send my cost-per-click rates through the roof! 
I’ll make millions!” Unfortunately, the advertising companies have figured out 
this little scheme, and they refer to it as click fraud. Advertisers spend good 
money to have their ads displayed, and companies that run advertisement 
programs go out of their way to make sure that clicks on those ads are legiti­
mate clicks. Make sure that you understand what happens if you click ads on 
your own blog before you do it: Some programs penalize or even ban bloggers 
who engage in click fraud.

Getting Advertising Going
Most bloggers choose to incorporate advertising programs by signing up 
with a company that serves as a middleman between the blogger and the 
advertiser. This company typically negotiates rates with the advertiser, 
tracks ad performance, and pays the blogger for advertising placement.
Although you can cut out the middleman and sell your own ad space, many 
bloggers find that they don’t really want to spend their time dealing with the 
negotiation, tracking, and technical overhead.
But even the most time-pressed blogger can likely find the strength to listen 
when an advertiser contacts that blogger directly and offers to sponsor the 
blog. These arrangements are typically more lucrative for the blogger (and 
the advertiser, presumably), and the two parties negotiate this relationship 
on a case-by-case basis, depending on the audience, product, blog traffic, and 
other factors.
After you decide on formats, placement, and business models, it’s time to 
put ads on your blog. The good — and bad — news is that you have dozens 
of options to choose from. In the following sections, I show you a few well-
regarded advertising programs to consider.
Google AdSense
www.google.com/adsense
AdSense is Google’s contextual advertising program, and it’s really the big­
gest player in the contextual advertising arena. When you sign up for Google 
AdSense, you choose what kinds of ads you want on your blog, from text to 
images to videos. You can see examples of the Google AdSense formats in 
Figure 18-3.
Advertisers pay Google money when your blog visitors click the advertise­
ments displayed beside your content, and you receive a portion of those 
payments. Successful bloggers who have a lot of traffic can earn a living from 
Google AdSense, but income varies greatly, depending on the size of your 
audience and how well your blog topics match the advertisers who contract 
with Google.

Text Link Ads
www.text-link-ads.com
Based in New York, Text Link Ads is one of the most popular and recogniz­
able advertising systems used by bloggers. Designed with blogs in mind, 
these ads are a slightly different option than contextual advertising programs 
that try to relate ads specifically to your content. Instead, you get only simple 
links that you preapprove, which are related but much lower-key in look and 
feel than contextual ads.
You can display Text Link Ads on the same page with Google AdSense, 
Yahoo! Publisher Network, and other contextually served ads.

Part VI: Getting Business-y with It 
AdBrite is an advertising marketplace similar to the others mentioned in 
the preceding sections. Bloggers can choose between text, banner ads, full-
page interstitials (splash pages containing a full-page advertisement), inline 
ads, and image ads. Interstitials are high-paying ads that take over the entire 
browser window when a user clicks to move from one page of your website 
to another; they usually feature a Skip This Ad link or button.
Putting Ads on Your Blog
To get these ads onto your website, most often, the programs you sign up for 
provide you with a bit of code that you insert into your website templates. 
Some programs have step-by-step instructions for popular blog software 
packages, but be aware that you might also need to consult your blog soft­
ware documentation for help with putting your ads where you want them.
First, decide just where you want the ads on your page. The best thing to do 
when you’re thinking about introducing ads into your blog design is to make 
sure the ads aren’t overpowering.
	
Don’t damage your reputation or credibility by overloading the site with ads 
or by associating ads too closely with your blog posts and content. Aside from 
pop-up ads, nothing is more annoying than having a blog design that’s created 
around ads rather than a blog that’s designed to include ads.
At the same time, you need to place ads in spots where readers can see them. 
Bloggers have discovered a few truths about ads, although your results might 
differ:
	
✓	Ads at the top and bottom of each page do poorly. Readers often 
ignore and rarely view advertisements along the top or the bottom of 
a blog because the site content usually appears in the middle of the 
screen. While users scroll their windows to view site content, they may 
never see these top and bottom advertisements at all.
	
✓	Ads in the sidebars perform well but might interfere with navigation. 
The left side of the website is a traditional place for ads. However, it’s 
also a prime place for navigation tools, and your website design might 
require that you locate such tools higher than the ads you want people 
to view. As for the right side, not only are navigation tools sometimes 
placed here, but the bulk of blog content tends be aligned to the left side 
of the screen. Some users might cover the right side with other windows 
and therefore miss these right-side advertisements entirely.
	
✓	Ads within the content itself get clicked. Some blogs have their ads 
placed within their content, and therefore visitors don’t miss the ads. 
But you need to be careful when you use advertising within your con­
tent. Remember that you want to make the content king, not the ad.

 Chapter 18: Making Mad Mad Money
	
Try out ads in different places on your blog and see how your audience 
reacts, as well as how your earnings do. You might need to try several differ­
ent locations before you find one that balances your readers’ needs with your 
advertisers’.
Putting Ads in Your RSS Feeds
Active bloggers debate about whether RSS feeds should contain ads. 
Traditionally, bloggers have used RSS as a way to share information, and only 
later did it become a place to put advertisements. You might want to con­
sider using RSS ads because many of your blog readers might use RSS read­
ers to consume the content of your blog.
RSS ads are simply banner or text advertisements that appear below or 
above the content displayed in your RSS reading program. The ads are usu­
ally smaller than typical banner ads on the average website because they’re 
meant to fit within the RSS feed.
Pheedo
www.pheedo.com
Pheedo is the pioneering company that began the feed advertising industry. 
In 2003, Pheedo’s creators thought of an idea to place advertisements in RSS 
feeds and started Pheedo. Their business has grown into one of the largest 
advertising networks for RSS.
Google FeedBurner Ad Network
http://feedburner.google.com
FeedBurner, a Google-owned company, is chock-full of feed experts. It has a 
program called the FeedBurner Ad Network that allows you to monetize your 
feed with ads via a revenue-sharing program. It has established a significant 
ad network. You can also connect an existing Google AdSense account to 
your RSS ads.

Getting Paid to Post
Being paid to post can mean a couple of different things. For many bloggers, 
it means receiving money or products to post a review or mention a company 
on a personal blog. But blogging for money can also lead you down the path 
of the professional blogger, where you write posts for other blogs.
Placing products on your blog
Some bloggers believe that getting paid to post about products or companies 
is a bad thing. However, blogging is hard work. Would it be so terrible to get 
paid to talk about a product every once in a while?
Some bloggers fear that the influence of advertisers might take over the tradi­
tionally independent voice of the blogosphere. When advertisers offer money 
to bloggers to praise their products and services in a blog, it might not result 
in an honest review of the business. So, if you’re paid to post information 
about someone else, make sure that you retain your right to post your own 
honest opinion. You might even want to consider starting an additional blog 
to showcase content that you’re being paid to produce, as opposed to the 
content contained in your original blog.
	
Above all, let your readers know what products companies have paid you to 
mention or review, or sent you for free in hopes that you review them. You 
can head off accusations of deception by disclosing the terms of how you 
came to talk about a product or a post that some company has paid you for.
You can either set up your own system or find a service that allows you to 
connect with companies that want to have their products or services adver­
tised on blogs.
SponsoredReviews.com
www.sponsoredreviews.com
SponsoredReviews.com is a company that connects advertisers with blog­
gers who are willing to write reviews about the advertisers’ products and ser­
vices. This company is forthright with the expectation that you, as a blogger, 
will offer an honest opinion and even give constructive criticism about the 
products that its advertisers create.
PayPerPost

319
 Chapter 18: Making Mad Mad Money
PayPerPost is a company that helps bloggers get paid for creating and pub­
lishing advertiser-sponsored content. The theory behind the company is that 
if you’re a blogger, you’ll inevitably write about some products that you’ve 
used in the past or are currently using. PayPerPost believes you should be 
paid for those kinds of posts.
PayPerPost works somewhat like a job board, where you accept bids to write 
about a certain product or service. The advertiser and the amount of traffic 
you report determine the amount of money you receive.
Blogging professionally
You can offer your blogging services to those who might want them by 
making a small business for yourself as a professional blogger. Believe me, 
companies are often looking for competent writers they can hire to contrib­
ute content to their blogs. This decision might take time away from your per­
sonal blog, but hopefully, additional practice can help you to become a better 
blogger!
To offer up your service, check the blogger-wanted ads on job boards and see 
whether you’re interested in writing about any topic. Also, be sure to post 
about your availability on your own blog’s sidebar and in your blog itself.
A site where you can start your search for blogging jobs is Jobs.Progblogger 
(http://jobs.problogger.net). This popular website provides help to 
bloggers so that they can monetize their websites. The job board is highly 
active, and blogger jobs often appear here.
	
When you begin blogging professionally, you need to keep track of any prog­
ress you make. Typically, this tracking includes either the number of posts 
that you create or the number of site visitors over a period of time. You can 
organize this information in various ways, but the tracking needs to prove that 
some interaction occurred between you and your readers.
Tying in Affiliate Marketing
If you ever blogged about a product that you really like and just knew that 
you were helping the company that makes the product make a sale, you can 
now make some money from that sale with affiliate marketing.
Popular retailers have set up affiliate marketing programs, most notably 
Amazon.com. You sign up with an affiliate program, and when you blog about 
one of its products, you include a piece of identifying information that the 
company gives you. You earn cash when readers of your blog click the prod­
uct and buy it.

Part VI: Getting Business-y with It 
If you find yourself blogging about items that others might buy as a result of 
your recommendation, check to see whether the company that makes the 
product has an affiliate program and sign yourself up.
In short order, your blog can contain links to books, DVDs, or other products 
that provide you with a commission on each product bought through a link 
from your website.
Amazon Associates Program
www.amazon.com/associates
Amazon is the most recognized affiliate program available, and it’s arguably 
one that you likely benefit from using because many bloggers mention books 
and DVDs that they’ve enjoyed.
Amazon Associates works by letting you create specially formatted links that 
you can use on your blog to drive traffic to the Amazon website. Anything 
that a visitor who clicks your link purchases earns you a percentage of the 
sale as a referral fee.
LinkShare
www.linkshare.com/publishers
LinkShare is another affiliate program that calls itself a pay-per-action mar­
keting network. You can place both text and graphical ads on your blog and 
make money from any sales that come from readers’ purchases.
Google Affiliate Network
www.google.com/ads/affiliatenetwork
If you regularly blog about consumer products, the Google Affiliate Network 
can help you turn those blog posts into money. Sign up to review the adver­
tisers participating in the network, and learn how to track conversions of 
your recommendations into purchases. Many well-known brands participate 
in the Google Affiliate Network, from Target to Verizon.

Seeking Sponsorships
Sponsorships are advertisements by companies that have either requested to 
be an advertiser or whom you seek out to advertise on your site. Such spon­
sorship can mean one of two things:
	
✓	Sponsors might pay you to put their ads on your website.
	
✓	Sponsors might simply provide you with free goods or services in return 
for advertising on your website.
	
You need to think carefully about whether to take on a sponsor because not 
all sponsorships are equal:
	
✓	Prominent placement or exclusivity: A sponsor is different from the 
usual ad on your website because sponsors like a prominent placement 
on your blog — possibly including the exclusive right to advertise on 
your blog.
	
✓	Acknowledgment: A sponsor might ask you to use the phrase “This blog 
sponsored by . . . ” or some variation of it to let your readers know that a 
specific company is funding your blog. You may also want to thank your 
sponsor occasionally to generate extra goodwill.
	
✓	Time commitment: Sponsorships often run for a set length of time, 
usually much longer than a standard ad runs. Sponsorships of several 
months to a year aren’t unheard of.
Getting sponsors interested in your blog is probably the hardest advertis­
ing strategy, though it’s also the most lucrative. To find a sponsor, you need 
to “sell” your blog, from the design to the content. Make the sponsor want 
to post its advertisements on your site — not someone else’s. When you’re 
seeking sponsors, keep your blog dynamic, on topic, and well written.
One of the best things sponsors do for your blog is legitimize your work. 
Many bloggers might be viewed by the public as “just another blogger” 
within the static of the Internet. But, if you have sponsors that believe in 
what you’re doing, you can attract other professional relationships, such as 
speaking engagements or press interviews. If you’re regarded as an authority, 
you can build a stronger brand.
Negotiating a sponsorship experience
Sponsors can be demanding advertisers. Unlike developing your own mon­
etization plan, sponsorships can change the way you advertise on your site. 
Some sponsors demand exclusivity — which means they’re the only business 
of that type that advertises on your site, and you might have to turn away 
other potential sponsors. Others might demand that you always write about

322
Part VI: Getting Business-y with It 
their products or services in a positive way. Dealing with sponsors can be a 
true balancing act. But the rewards can be worth the work.
Here’s my recipe for a successful sponsor/blogger relationship:
	
✓	Be clear on your topic. Know who you are and what you’re writing 
about. If you have a blog that isn’t clear about its subject, when you’re 
seeking sponsorship, potential sponsors may be unable to understand 
why they are a good match for your blog. Sponsors want a very clear 
idea about the content you’re creating and about what you can do for 
them.
	
	Keeping your blog on topic is especially important when sponsors are 
actively using their brand identities on your site. Make sure that they’re 
aware of everything you might write about so that they don’t have any 
surprises or objections to editorial content.
	
✓	Be clear about what you’re promising. Be sure both you and your spon­
sor understand exactly what influence and control — if any — the part­
nership offers the advertiser. Thoroughly outline how you’ll handle both 
content and advertising placement of the sponsor; the advertiser should 
be upfront about its expectations of you.
	
✓	Know your audience. Educate yourself on your audience if you’re seek­
ing paying sponsors for your blog. With increased sponsorship, you 
absolutely must address the question of who your audience is. You need 
to document the activity in your community, track your comments, and 
analyze the information from your web statistics. (Check Chapter 16 for 
information on web statistics and traffic software.)
	
	Create a report of your statistics to prove to any sponsors that you 
have the numbers that you claim you do. Don’t use any guesswork when 
creating this report. Your sponsors want to see solid numbers and data 
to back up your claims. Sponsorship arrangements often require you 
to create statistics reports; the simple fact is that if you want to make 
money, you have to gather data.
	
	You can collect data from your audience in the form of contests, polls, 
and other interactive experiences. Ask your audience members who 
they are — and if you approach it in a professional manner, they might 
be happy to reveal a little bit about themselves.
	
✓	Banner placement and visual cues. If you’ve been placing advertising 
on your blog for awhile, you already have a good idea where ads appear 
to good effect on your site, and you probably also know what types of 
ads work best. So, you can demonstrate the benefits of placement and 
ad types to any potential sponsors.
	
	However, if you’ve never had ads on your site when you first seek a 
sponsor, be prepared to offer ideas and suggestions for adequately high­
lighting the sponsor’s ads and branding. You can even provide a design 
mock-up or some kind of visual representation. Or you might even 
www.it-ebooks.info

323
 Chapter 18: Making Mad Mad Money
consider creating a demo website that actually shows the ads in the 
positions and formats that you think can work.
	
✓	Limit other monetization methods. Some bloggers find that if they use 
other advertising systems at the same time as a sponsor, it dilutes the 
effectiveness of the sponsorships. Many sponsors ask to be the exclu­
sive advertiser on your site or that you limit what other kinds of adver­
tising and advertisers you use while they sponsor you. This request isn’t 
unreasonable, especially if you have a lucrative sponsorship agreement 
that compensates you for the loss of those ad spots.
Setting boundaries
Jumping to the professional level in the blogging world poses a few potential 
pitfalls and requires ongoing reinvention on your part. Set up and keep to a 
few simple rules about what your professional limits and intentions are, and 
don’t be afraid to write those rules down in a document that you share with 
sponsors and your readers.
Also, be ready to say no. Some sponsors might want more than you’re will­
ing to give. Yes, you may be able to earn some money from your blog, but 
don’t forget the reason you’re blogging in the first place. Your blog is your 
territory, not your sponsor’s. You’re renting the sponsor space on your site, 
giving it access to your audience. You aren’t signing up for someone to tell 
you what to do. You already have parents for that!
	
Don’t jump at every offer that comes in the door. You may find this advice 
difficult to follow when you’re seeking your first sponsor, but you need to 
maintain a high level of professionalism — not just for yourself, but also for 
your audience. In the same way that you protect your audience from nasty 
comments and spam, you need to be sure that you give them an appropriate 
experience with your sponsors and advertisers. Protect the integrity of your 
blog and avoid sponsors that demand more time, editorial control, or space 
on your blog than you’re willing to give.
Accepting Gifts, Not Obligations
Many companies offer news media access to products and services in order 
to generate press attention, and increasingly, bloggers are being offered 
the same goodies. After all, some blog topics are so specific that companies 
absolutely know that the blog’s readers will be interested in their products. 
For example, a blogger who writes about cell phones might be targeted by a 
mobile phone company, and offered a free product or money in exchange for 
some kind of online review or feedback.

Part VI: Getting Business-y with It 
This kind of exchange can be a tricky situation because some bloggers regard 
the gift as some kind of bribe or obligation to write something positive about 
the product in question.
In fact, that perception isn’t correct. I know bloggers who accept products 
for review on the condition that they say what they really think about it, and 
most companies are perfectly satisfied with this kind of arrangement. In addi­
tion, most bloggers who do these kinds of reviews are very upfront with their 
readers about how they obtained the product in question and what agree­
ment they have with the company that provided it.
If you’re getting these offers, you can probably benefit from establishing such 
a policy. Most bloggers don’t want to be seen as taking bribes or favors from 
companies that just want the bloggers to say nice things about them. Your 
policy needs to lay out how you plan to deal with such situations.
Here are three things to consider when you start to get product-review offers:
	
✓	Be clear about what you’ll do with the product. Tell the product maker 
that you won’t write a positive review if the product doesn’t deserve it. 
Make sure that you’re very specific about what you’ll provide in return 
for the gift (if anything).
	
✓	Be prepared to return gifts. A lot of bloggers, especially the incredibly 
geeky ones, would love to receive a gift from a company that has the 
latest and hottest product. However, if the company has unreasonable 
demands or demands that don’t match the blogger’s vision, the blogger 
might choose to simply return the gift.
	
✓	Donate what you receive. You can avoid an ugly scene with your audi­
ence or any sponsors of your blog by taking the gifts you receive, writing 
your review, and then giving the items away. You can send them to your 
favorite charity or hold a contest for your audience. Donating your free­
bies generates all kinds of goodwill from your community while avoiding 
any accusations of bias.
Keep to the core of what makes your blog great. If you get an offer for a free 
product, think about it first — don’t accept it right away. You can even go 
to your community members and see what they think if you require advice. 
Whether you accept ads or sponsorships, and how you implement them, 
really depends on you.

A

s a business owner or entrepreneur, you’re probably wondering 
whether blogging can help you be more financially successful or allow 
you to promote your company in some way. Many of today’s technically 
savvy businesses have started blogs and found them to be terrific tools for 
reaching out to customers, generating buzz about a service or product, build­
ing goodwill, or just informing customers about what they’re up to.
If you’re thinking about adding a blog to your outreach efforts but aren’t 
entirely confident that it’ll be worth the time and effort, you aren’t alone. 
Many companies have difficulty seeing the value in blogging. Some profes­
sionals worry about diverting time away from more crucial workplace tasks, 
whereas others worry about opening themselves up for public criticism.
And the truth is that even though blogging can provide a business with a 
really incredible tool, it isn’t right for every business. Nonetheless, in this 
chapter, I do my best to persuade you that blogging can work for you and 
your company, whether you’re a lone-wolf entrepreneur just starting out or 
a Fortune 500 executive with more marketing staff than you know what to 
do with.

Putting Blogs to Work for Your Business
A stigma still lingers around blogs. Many people still think of a blogger as a 
pimple-faced teenager who sits in his pajamas all day writing excruciatingly 
boring diary posts about what he had for breakfast. Blogs, for a lot of folks, 
equate with the worst kind of narcissistic navel-gazing. Those kinds of blogs 
do exist, of course, but in reality, the blogosphere contains so much more 
than that. Hundreds of nonprofit organizations, small-business owners, con­
sultants, newspapers, and schools have moved into the blogosphere.
Why? Blogs are simple to set up, easy to publish, and have a proven track 
record for increasing search engine traffic to a website. For a company in 
which time is of the essence and accessibility is a necessity — show me a 
company where these things aren’t a priority, and I’ll eat my hat — blogs are 
a low-investment way to accomplish a lot. Don’t believe me? Then perhaps 
you’ll believe General Motors, McDonald’s, Microsoft, Amazon.com, The New 
York Times, and Southwest Airlines; all these companies have added blogs to 
their business practices.
Considering the benefits of a business blog
For a business or organization, you can use blog software to release com­
pany public-relations documents to the public, or you can go further and 
introduce blogs as part of your external communications to your customers 
and potential customers. Some companies use blogs internally to coordinate 
work teams or communicate across distances. Here are a few of the ways 
businesses are using blogs:
	
✓	Generating conversation and buzz about the company, its products, or 
services in the online space
	
✓	Reaching out with information and support to current customers, even 
resolving issues traditionally handled by phone-based customer service
	
✓	Creating new pathways to interact with the public about an industry or 
issue, including gathering feedback and input to guide future product 
development
	
✓	Defusing negative criticism or press by publicly addressing problems
	
✓	Demonstrating expertise and experience to potential customers
	
✓	Directly driving sales or action
	
✓	Collaborating across teams, branches, regions, or staggered shifts
When it comes to business, the main thing that a business blogger should 
consider is that blog software, implemented properly, can allow companies 
to improve their communications and organization with very little overhead.

 Chapter 19: Blogging for Companies
In some cases, blogs have even saved businesses money by delivering docu­
ments and data online that were previously delivered via snail mail.
Businesses haven’t been the only beneficiaries, either. Customers have bene­
fited from increased access to news, information, support, and dialogue with 
companies that have blogs.
Making blogs work for you can be simple if you have a communication strat­
egy that’s flexible and can evolve when your blog takes off. Blogs can gener­
ate sales and establish strong communication directly with customers, and 
marketing experts believe blogs are a friendly method of making customers 
happy.
Checking out businesses that blog
You know blogging is important. You already know that it gives you a very 
good way to generate talk about your company. Do you need a little more 
convincing? Well, the following sections discuss how some other companies 
are blogging.
Hewlett-Packard
www.hp.com/hpinfo/blogs
You’ve probably owned a Hewlett-Packard product at some point in your 
computing life. Hewlett-Packard has built computers, printers, cameras, and 
high-end computer servers for years, building up incredible expertise across 
a range of consumer products. You can see that knowledge in the HP blogs, 
which claim to convey the “unvarnished thoughts of HP employees.” Topics 
range from computers to the Cannes Film Festival to gaming, and the blog­
gers come from all areas of the company’s structure.
Wells Fargo
http://blog.wellsfargo.com
What could a bank possibly blog about, you ask? Apparently, banks can 
discuss a whole lot with their customers. Student loans, small business, and 
stock markets are all topics discussed on the Wells Fargo Blogs site. Wells 
Fargo Blogs gives multiple contributors a public voice in a variety of blogs, 
from The Student LoanDown to Guided by History.

The Microsoft Community Blogs (shown in Figure 19-1) are one way that 
Microsoft reaches out to customers and potential customers. These blogs, 
written by software and hardware developers, give interested readers a 
behind-the-scenes peek at their favorite products and a way to interact with 
the developers.
Oracle
http://blogs.oracle.com
Oracle also reaches out to customers by using developer blogs. On the blogs, 
customers can seek out and talk directly to the people involved in the making 
of a product, giving customers a feeling of involvement and direct access not 
available from traditional marketing efforts.
It’s pretty ingenious, when you think about it — put your engineers and pro­
grammers to work helping you promote your products and services, rather 
than just creating them!

 Chapter 19: Blogging for Companies
Deciding whether to blog
Blogging for business reasons is a sensitive topic both in and out of the 
blogosphere. Old-school bloggers don’t like seeing blogging turned from a 
personal outlet into a professional one, and many businesses worry that the 
informality of a blog looks unprofessional. And that isn’t all: Some businesses 
also have concerns about employees who have personal blogs on which they 
might talk about their work or appear to be representing the company.
Blogging isn’t for every corporate culture. If your company has traditionally 
had an open hand with communication and outreach, blogging is going to be 
a great tool for you. But if you have a reserved corporate culture, blogging 
might be too much of a stretch beyond business as usual. Still, many compa­
nies that might seem an odd fit for blogs for marketing or outreach have been 
happily surprised at the results they’ve obtained.
Businesses that need to keep information or trade practices confidential, or 
that stand to lose by having an open-door policy, probably shouldn’t blog. 
For instance, some government agencies and law firms are limited by the 
very nature of their businesses in what they can communicate. You know 
best whether your corporate culture or industry can benefit from the use of 
a blog.
	
At the very least, however, track your company and what’s said about it in the 
blogosphere. Just because you ignore blogs, that doesn’t mean they ignore 
you! Chapter 17 explains how you can keep tabs on what others say about 
your business online.
	
If you’re still on the fence about starting a blog, try one with a set endpoint, for 
an event or a product launch. After the event occurs, you can end the blog’s 
lifespan gracefully and have some real data to use in assessing whether blogging 
was a worthwhile endeavor for you. Also, take a look at your competitors — 
are any of them blogging? If so, does the blog appear to be reaching visitors 
effectively? Are readers leaving comments? Watch how these competitors are 
making use of a blog and give some thought to whether you might be able to do 
something similar (but more effectively).
Planning for Business Blog Success
Blogging for a business comes down to planning. Don’t let the ease of getting 
started with the technical side of blogging seduce you into jumping in with­
out preparing. You need to decide what your goals are, figure out who you 
want to actually write the blog, map out the topics that you plan to discuss, 
and plan how you might integrate direct action or sales.

Part VI: Getting Business-y with It 
Setting goals
Before you jump into blogging for your business, you need to set goals that 
define how you can know whether your blog is successful after you launch 
it. Decide what you want the blog to help you accomplish. Do you want to 
replace some of your existing customer service efforts with the blog? Are you 
launching a new product that needs publicity? Whatever your direction, plan 
your purpose prior to launching the blog.
	
So many things could go into a blog, but you also have a business to run. 
Decide how much time you want to devote to writing and maintaining your 
blog. Blogging is part of your business, but it can’t take away from time you 
need to devote to other tasks.
You might choose to define success by
	
✓	Increasing traffic to your website
	
✓	Reaching a certain number of blog comments on a daily basis
Top five reasons why blogs work for businesses
Here are the most important reasons that blogs 
work so well as a business and marketing tool 
in today’s Internet-enabled world:
	✓	Cost: A lot of blogging software packages 
are open source and available at no cost, 
but even those that have licensing fees are 
very reasonably priced. Hosted services 
can also provide you with an inexpensive 
platform to begin business blogging.
	✓	Communication: A blog allows you to com­
municate with potential and current clients 
in a direct and informal way. You can chat 
and communicate about your product or 
service without pressuring your client. You 
use a business blog to make sure that your 
potential or existing clients get the facts 
about your product without a heavy-handed 
sales pitch.
	✓	Research: Many companies want to break 
into new markets and new demographics. 
Blogging allows for collaborative discussion 
that can help you gather valuable informa­
tion about how to position products and 
services.
	✓	Feedback: Find out what you’re doing right 
and wrong in your business or with your 
products by just asking outright on your 
blog. Discover how to improve what you’re 
currently doing or how you can deal with 
existing problems — and get points for 
effort while you do.
	✓	Reputation: Do away with that corporate-
giant personality most companies can’t 
help but convey. Blogs can put a human, 
personal face on what has usually been 
a monolithic surface. If you let the public 
see how you respect and regard them, you 
reap the benefits of being honest and open. 
Smaller businesses and consultancies ben­
efit from the publicity around their names 
and opinions.

 Chapter 19: Blogging for Companies
	
✓	Seeing more conversation about your company/products/services in the 
media or on other blogs
	
✓	Earning money from product sales or blog advertising
You might want to define success for your blog in other ways, so don’t think 
you have to use any of these suggestions. A blog is such a flexible medium 
that yours might accomplish a goal I can’t even imagine!
Choosing a blogger
Businesses have developed two approaches to company blogs: blogs written 
by one person and those written by multiple people from all over the organi­
zation. Either approach is valid, as long as everyone posting to the blog has a 
clear idea of the goals, ideas, and style of the blog.
	
If you create a blog that has multiple contributors, put a single individual in 
charge of content on a regular basis and encourage others from the organiza­
tion to chime in when they have something to say. The responsibility for the 
blog is in one person’s hands, but the door is open for wide participation.
Occasional writers are welcome, but don’t suddenly give employees brand-
new job duties that they can’t meet. Having multiple voices in a blog can also 
help you to convey the culture of your company overall, giving readers a 
taste of what people at all levels of the organization think about and do.
If you spread the writing around, you might be able to create a blog that has 
a huge amount of content and satisfies a very large readership. The multiple-
voice perspective might also awaken ideas in the other writers and generate 
internal conversations.
	
No matter who blogs, you must decide internally whether someone needs to 
vet posts before actually posting them, and who should do the vetting. It’s a 
good idea to have someone who isn’t blogging keep an eye on things, just to 
get a second opinion.
When you’re considering just who should blog on behalf of the company, 
give some thought to
	
✓	Writing ability: You need a blogger who’s an effective writer and who 
also likes to write.
	
✓	Position within the company: Who’s the right person to reach out to 
the public? CEOs offer one perspective, and so do those on the factory 
floor. Try to match the goals and style of your blog with the right people 
within your company, and don’t be afraid to give unexpected staffers a 
try. You might be surprised at how interesting readers find a behind-the-
curtain approach.

Part VI: Getting Business-y with It 
	
✓	Knowledge and expertise: Be sure to choose a person who has suf­
ficient knowledge and expertise to be interesting and engaging on the 
subjects the blog discusses. Preferably, you want people who really 
know what they’re talking about and have information to share.
	
✓	Time commitments: Choose a blogger who has the time to put into the 
site. Don’t overload already busy staff with this new job requirement.
After you choose a blogger, you have a few more folks to identify. Don’t 
forget to plan who you want to review comments, deal with spam, and fix 
technical issues.
Deciding what to write
While you think about topics for the blog, consider how informal or personal 
you want to make your blog style. Although the occasional personal post 
can help to humanize your blog, don’t be tempted down the journaling path: 
You’re creating a business blog, so look for creative ways of covering your 
industry.
The goal of many business blogs is to establish (or maybe reestablish) the 
business as a leader in its industry. Think about how to demonstrate exper­
tise while staying interesting and readable: You need to show that you know 
your stuff without becoming a stuffed shirt! Use the blog to persuade people 
that they should trust you without coming right out and telling people, “I’m 
trustworthy!”
Whoever blogs for your business needs to have a keen understanding of the 
goals and culture of the company, as well as know how much information to 
put on the blog without going too far. Many companies set up rules about 
topics that are appropriate for the blog, as well as define what information 
they want to keep confidential.
Here are some general guidelines to keep in mind for your blog content:
	
✓	Keep it true. Double-check blog posts for accuracy before making them 
live. Like a newspaper or any other publisher, follow a process to make 
sure you’re publishing facts and not fiction. You can include opinions on 
your business’s blog as long as you label them as just that.
	
✓	Keep it relevant and real. Be as open and honest as you can in your 
blog. This approach to transparency can make some in your company 
nervous (hi, corporate lawyer!), but the more successful business blogs 
provide insight or communication from real people. Some even give the 
public access to the viewpoints and words of high-level staff the read­
ers would normally never meet or talk to. Furthermore, whoever blogs 
should stay on topic and keep posts related to the subject of the blog, 
no matter how interesting that TV show was last night.

 Chapter 19: Blogging for Companies
	
✓	Keep it informative and educational. One problem that many companies 
encounter when they start to blog is the fact that their blogs are (ahem) 
boring. You might have great information, but if people don’t also find it 
interesting to read about, you can’t get readers to stick around long. Try 
to write posts that educate with a light-hearted manner and that focus on 
information and news that are useful to those reading it.
	
✓	Keep it positive. Steer away from discussing your competition in your 
blog. If you can say something nice about another company, don’t hesi­
tate, but you probably don’t want to point out just what other compa­
nies are doing wrong. That kind of approach can turn your blog into a 
giant argument, scaring off less-opinionated customers who might other­
wise be interested in your products and services.
	
✓	Keep using keywords. Part of the plan of a business-related blog is to 
make sure the blog is useful to readers, but for that plan to work, you 
have to get readers from the search engine to your blog. Use your knowl­
edge of your industry and topical news to use keywords that people are 
likely to use in search engines when they look for the subject of your 
blog or your business.
	
	Pay special attention to the words that you use in the titles of your blog 
posts: Search engines often weight these words most heavily, so hit the 
highpoints in your titles. Informative is better than cutesy!
	
✓	Keep linking. Business blogs should also link to related articles and 
websites. You can link to resources on your business’s own website, but 
don’t hesitate to point folks to good information that isn’t on your web­
site. If you’re a source for information that they need or can get them to 
the information they need effectively, you don’t lose them for long.
	
	Also, look for chances to link the blog to itself! A lot of bloggers are 
clever about linking to old posts on their own blogs so that new readers 
know where to go deep within the blog archives. This kind of linking can 
increase traffic and also inform and educate your readers.
	
✓	Keep posting. Post on a regular basis and don’t stop. Don’t worry about 
an absolutely right number of posts per week, but most experts agree 
that two to three posts a week is enough to keep your blog active and 
useful without overwhelming your readers. Other bloggers post less 
frequently, and others post multiple times a day. Do what works for 
you and for your readers, but be consistent so that your readers know 
what to expect from you. If your blog has long silences followed by short 
bursts of posting, you create a recipe for low readership numbers.
Generating sales or action
Asking potential customers to check out your services after they read some­
thing on your blog can turn those readers into actual customers. If you see a 
logical link to a product or service that you offer, it only makes sense to let

people know. But you need to do more than simply push sales. You tread a 
fine line between a blog that points out possible purchases, along with pro­
viding content, and one that isn’t anything more than a big ad.
	
Keep one idea in mind: Meet the needs of your readers. If you can put yourself 
in the shoes of a blog visitor, you might be able to successfully discriminate 
between a reasonable link to a product sale and one that’s too blatant.
Some blogs don’t try hard to get people to pull out their wallets. Instead, the 
blog’s purpose might be to gather feedback and get people to participate in 
an event or contest. Again, try to be genuine and inviting, rather than pushy. 
Get readers involved and invested in your goal.
The ThreadStaff blog (www.threadless.com/news) successfully negotiates 
between information and sales. Threadless is a company that solicits t-shirt 
designs, allows visitors to vote on their favorites, and then prints and sells 
the winning designs. Its blog, shown in Figure 19-2, keeps readers up to date 
on other products Threadless sells, lets artists know when to submit designs, 
explains new directions the company is taking, and even promotes charitable 
causes the company espouses.

 Chapter 19: Blogging for Companies
Delivering with Technology
You might be thinking about how you, as a blogger, can make connections 
with potential customers by using your blog. Words are a great start, but 
technology can also be your friend! A lot of the standard blog bells and 
whistles are designed to get people involved or to make it easy for them to 
consume your blog.
Use the tools in the following sections to get readers to return to your blog 
again and again.
Enabling comments
Comments are a double-edged sword for companies that start blogs. On the 
one hand, they do a great job of starting conversation and interaction. On 
the other hand, they can be a source of a lot of work because you have to 
keep them free of spam or inappropriate conversation. Many businesses are 
tempted to start a blog and keep comments turned off, but that cuts out a 
huge part of the benefit of a blog: hearing from your readers and interacting 
directly with them.
My advice? Turn on the comments! But take precautions by setting up a good 
policy about what kinds of comments are acceptable and implement some of 
the very good spam-fighting tools discussed in Chapter 9.
Creating RSS/web feeds
Before the advent of web feeds, blog readers had to remember to visit the 
blog periodically to see whether the blogger had posted a new entry. This 
dangerous method made it easy for people to forget to visit. Web feeds, or 
RSS feeds, give you a way to let people know quickly, easily, and automati­
cally that you have new content available on your blog. Blog visitors simply 
subscribe to the feed by using a newsreader, which tracks the feed and 
updates it every time you update the blog, giving instant notification to the 
reader.

Part VI: Getting Business-y with It 
Users can set up web feeds, usually formatted as RSS (Really Simple 
Syndication), quickly and easily. In fact, most blog software packages auto­
matically include an RSS tool, so you can set it up once and never think about 
it again.
I talk more about web feeds in Chapter 14.
Podcasting
Podcasting is a relative newcomer to the blogosphere, but it’s proving to be 
a powerful blog ally. Podcasting, the recording and distribution of audio and 
video files to subscribers, has a tremendous potential to give your business 
blog a boost by providing multimedia presentations to your readers. You 
can add personality and a face to your blog. Posting interviews, discoveries, 
tutorials, and other adventures that your company has had can boost your 
visibility higher than a text-only blog can.
HBO produces podcasts to accompany many of its top shows (http://
itunes.apple.com/us/artist/hbo/id118405710). A quick run through 
the selection reveals interviews with directors, stars, on-set interviews, epi­
sode clips, and more.
You can read more about creating a podcast in Chapter 12.
Starting a wiki
Wikis are collaboratively built websites, which any visitor can edit. 
Businesses and organizations have found that wikis can complement blog 
sites nicely. Blogs allow for comments, but a wiki can provide a little more 
flexibility because visitors can both post pages and leave updates in a wiki, 
contributing to everything from documentation to news coverage.
Wikis are terrific collaborative tools, and if you’ve been trying to figure out a 
good way to share knowledge within an organization, you might want to use 
this approach. Many companies have found wikis useful for group learning 
purposes, such as building documentation or setting up procedural tasks. 
One of the most well-known examples of a successful wiki is Wikipedia (www.
wikipedia.org), an online encyclopedia to which anyone can contribute 
content or edit existing content. You can even find it available in multiple 
languages.
The Northern Voice blogging conference (www.northernvoice.ca) used a 
wiki to allow attendees of a self-organized event called Moosecamp to create 
its own event schedule. Figure 19-3 shows the wiki.

Joining a social network
Adding your company to a variety of social networks can also help to boost 
your visibility in the blogosphere. Businesses tend to shy away from social 
networking as a valid form of online advertising, but using these mediums 
properly can add a viral component to your communication strategy. (Viral 
marketing is advertising that consumers actually spread themselves. For 
example, when you forward a funny video created by a company, you’ve 
spread the “virus.”)
A lot of social networks exist, so be sure to choose those that are most per­
tinent for your industry and approach, not those frequented by 14-year-old 
girls (unless that suits your business!). LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com) and 
XING (www.xing.com) are good places to get started.
To get started with LinkedIn, follow these steps:
	
1.	Use your web browser to go to www.linkedin.com.
	
2.	Fill out the registration form and click the Join Now button.
	
	 LinkedIn loads the sign-up continuation screen.

3.	Fill out the required fields, including your name, business informa­
tion, and where you went to school.
	
4.	Click Join LinkedIn.
	
	 LinkedIn creates an account for you.
	
	 After you’re a LinkedIn member, be sure to click the Expand Your 
Network button at the top-right of any page in order to invite colleagues 
or see who in your e-mail address book already uses LinkedIn.
I introduce social networks and what they’re all about in Chapter 16.
Advertising on Blogs
Traditional marketing strategies include advertising, and blogs are no excep­
tion. But these aren’t your father’s ads: Blog advertising runs the gamut of 
everything from text links to full sponsorships.
In the past, taking out a typical advertisement meant that you’d go to the 
local newspaper, select an ad size, and choose a section in which you wanted 
your ad to appear. Maybe people saw the ad, maybe they didn’t, but you got 
charged by how many newspapers were printed, not how many sales you 
made.
Online advertising offers more accountability to the advertiser: Because of 
the way websites work, you can track how many times readers’ computers 
load an ad, when a reader clicks it, and what the person does after he or she 
clicks that ad. Because advertisers like this kind of measure of effectiveness, 
printed material has seen a significant decline in the purchase of ad space, 
whereas online advertising has grown hugely. You can use several methods 
to get your name or even your blog URL seen on other websites and blogs.
Going contextual
Contextual advertising is the practice in which an ad-serving tool matches the 
advertisements based on the content that appears in the blog. For example, a 
blog about candy would have ads for candy, and a blog about movies would 
show ads for upcoming films. If the website visitors are interested in the con­
tent of the website, they’re likely also interested in goods and services related 
to the topic of the website, and thus they’re more likely to click the ads.
The first major player in the contextual advertising game was Google 
AdSense. The program was popular from the start, and after a few rocky 
periods of users abusing the system, it has proven to be quite a moneymaker

for successful bloggers. Many professional bloggers make their living almost 
entirely on the income received from Google AdSense revenue. Search-engine 
marketer Alexandre Brabant uses Google AdSense on his company website, 
eMarketing 101 (www.emarketing101.net). The Google AdSense program 
ads appear below the navigation bar of his site, as shown in Figure 19-4.
Here are two ways that you can get involved with Google’s contextual adver­
tising tools:
	
✓	Sign up to put ads on your blog or website. Use the Google AdSense 
program (www.google.com/adsense). Chapter 18 introduces this 
program.
	
✓	Submit your blog or website for display. The Google AdWords program 
(http://adwords.google.com) lets you present your blog or website 
in the ads displayed on other websites.

business, check out Building Your Business with Google For Dummies, by Brad

Yahoo! and several other companies also have contextual advertising pro­
grams. Do a web search for contextual advertising programs to see what’s on 
offer.
You can add contextual advertising to your web (RSS) feed or put yourself 
into other web feeds by using the FeedBurner Ad Network (http://feed
burner.google.com).
Advertising via ad networks
A number of advertising middlemen can help successful bloggers put ads 
on their blogs. In most cases, you can choose between text and graphic ads 
in a set of standard web-advertising sizes. You create the ad, the ad net­
work serves it up, the blogger posts new content, and his or her visitors see 
your ad.
If you want to advertise on some of the most successful blogs around, check 
out one or more of these ad networks:
	
✓	b5media (www.b5media.com): Offers ad placement on more than 290 
blogs reaching more than 10 million readers; bloggers can sign up to be 
paid for blogging on the b5media blog network.
	
✓	Blogads (www.blogads.com): Offers ad placement on 1,500 blogs and 
allows you to choose an audience to target (for example, parents or 
news junkies).
	
✓	ClickZ (www.clickz.com): Offers ad placement on the ClickZ family of 
news, opinion, and entertainment sites.
	
✓	Crisp Ads (www.crispads.com): Offers advertising across blog catego­
ries (such as autos and food) or on specific blogs. More than 3,800 blogs 
are enrolled.
	
✓	FeedBurner (http://feedburner.google.com): Offers placement 
on blogs and in RSS feeds; choose from categories of blogs and/or target 
specific times of day or geographic regions.
Each of these services offers you an array of popular blogs and ad formats to 
choose from, organizes the deal, and handles the transaction. Rates are nego­
tiated based on the level of advertising, the blogs that you’re placed on, and 
how many times your ads are viewed or clicked.

 Chapter 19: Blogging for Companies
Sponsoring a blog
For a splashy way to be seen on a blog or website, consider sponsoring the 
site. Sponsorships for popular blogs have gained a lot of notoriety in the 
blogosphere. Some bloggers call accepting sponsorships “selling out,” but 
others regard it as a great way to get paid to do what they love. Sponsorships 
tend to get you coverage on other blogs, even if it’s just speculation about 
the amount you paid to sponsor a blog, but as they say, “Any publicity is 
good publicity.”
Sponsorships usually entitle you to occupy any and perhaps all advertising 
slots on a blog, and they often earn you mentions in the text of the blog, as 
well. Few blogs actually advertise that they accept sponsorships, largely 
because sponsored blogs are still fairly rare. If you want to sponsor a blog, 
contact the blogger directly with an inquiry. He or she can let you know 
whether the blog is open to a sponsorship, and you can go from there.
Sponsorships can be expensive to do. Be prepared to negotiate with the blog­
ger about the length of your sponsorship and the amount of money you’re 
willing to pay, but think bigger than you would for advertisement. In some 
cases, sponsors assume the operating costs of a blog, in addition to paying 
the blogger for his or her time and audience exposure.
As a sponsor, you’re entitled to more than just a prominent ad placement 
(though you should get that, too!). You can consider requesting exclusivity — 
that you’re the only advertiser in your industry on the blog, the only spon­
sor, or the only advertiser. You can request mentions in the copy of the blog, 
or any other arrangement you think is good for both you and the blogger. For 
many sponsors, having a prominent logo placement and label at the top of 
every blog page, and no other advertising on the blog, fills the bill.
Topics to discuss with any blogger you’re considering sponsoring include the 
following:
	
✓	What topics the blog covers: Know what kinds of content the blog 
you’re sponsoring typically has, and what kind of language it uses. 
Because readers associate your brand with the blog, you need to be 
comfortable with the way the blogger expresses him- or herself, as well 
as what subjects the blogger may raise.
	
	You might also want to discuss how you plan to handle situations in 
which the blogger has blogged about a topic with which you have a 
problem. Understand that the blogger is likely to resist giving you edito­
rial control, and be clear about what, if any, say you want to have in the 
content of the site.

Part VI: Getting Business-y with It 
	
✓	How you want the blog to acknowledge your sponsorship: Be sure to 
establish how the blogger will place your brand on the page, and when 
and where he or she will mention your business and link to your busi­
ness’s website.
	
✓	How other ads or monetization occur on the blog: Talk with the blog­
ger about other ways that he or she earns revenue and decide what, if 
any, of those systems can remain in place during the term of your spon­
sorship. Be prepared to compensate the blogger for any revenue that 
he or she usually earns that you request he or she remove from the site. 
For example, if the blogger commonly uses Google AdSense advertising 
that you don’t want to appear on the blog when you sponsor it, ask for 
accounting statements showing the value of those ads to the blogger.

Chapter 20
Ten Ways of Growing Community
E

very online community needs leaders or facilitators to keep the discus­
sions lively, upbeat, and on topic. Playing “mom” or “dad” can be the 
hardest job in any community, and sometimes, the rewards come slowly. 
Don’t let this fact discourage you, though. Encouraging growth in any com­
munity requires a certain level of patience, persistence, and attention — but 
when it works, it really works.
This chapter offers ten simple tricks for developing your blog from your 
soapbox into a real community, with true interaction between you and your 
readers, and among the readers themselves.
If you’re lucky, in the process of getting people to read and comment on your 
posts and on each other’s comments, you even discover how to convert 
readers into community evangelists who can make the community larger, 
more fun, and more active.
Write
Get writing (or podcasting, or posting photos, or whatever it is you’re doing 
on your blog)!
Establish a regular schedule for maintaining your blog; a schedule really 
helps readers know what to expect and when. A regular schedule can even 
build anticipation and excitement. Be open to ideas, provide a welcoming 
environment, and keep yourself on topic so that interested, engaged readers 
get what they’re looking for when they visit.
Write on other websites, as well. See whether other blogs might need a little 
help with a few additional posts. Also, help keep the conversations going on 
other blogs that you enjoy. Each time you comment on another blog, you get 
exposure to a few more potential readers for your own blog and build links 
back to your blog.

Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Reply
If someone asks you a question, either in the comments or through e-mail, 
make sure to reply. Acknowledge what the person says in your reply and take 
the time to answer properly, even if only to thank him or her for the com­
ment. Thoughtful responses to questions and comments about your blog can 
do as much to build your community as original blog posts can.
Some bloggers take the attitude that reader comments aren’t important or 
don’t count as much as the blog posts. If you actually want to build a reader­
ship that interacts with you, this attitude is dead wrong. Readers want your 
attention and encouragement.
Keep on top of what people are saying within your blog domain and don’t be 
a stranger to those who like what you do. Embrace their enthusiasm for your 
blog. Give them a reason to keep coming back. Interaction can make those 
who might shy away feel that they’re really part of the community that you’re 
developing.
If you reply to comments and criticism on both your blog and in other online 
communities, you can really attract others to your own site. Get involved as 
much as you would in any offline community group.
Visit and Participate
Join other communities. It’s that simple. If you want to build a community 
around your blog, you need to participate in others. Find blogs that are 
related to the topic areas of your blog. Jump in to the conversation by offer­
ing a different perspective, or some feedback to the blogger or to the folks 
who leave comments. Mentioning your site on other blogs is fine, as long as 
you make sure that your comments relate to the subject at hand and add to 
the conversation.
Also, don’t just write and leave. Keep active in the communities in which 
you’re a member and use that time to connect with others. Take what you 
can from the community, but also give back what you think can benefit every­
one as a whole. Remember that participating in these communities might 
even give you ideas for your own blog, so you’re likely to benefit in several 
ways from the time you spend on these blogs.
You can also share links between your blog community and related blogs 
that you want to support. Offer to set up a type of network where you can 
share content between sites. Anything is possible; you only need to ask.

 Chapter 20: Ten Ways of Growing Community
Add Guest Bloggers
If your blog readership is up and running, and you’re attracting a significant 
number of daily readers, you can request that members of your community 
help you out by guest-blogging on your site. Depending on the software 
you’re using, you can either set up secondary blogs or allow guest bloggers 
to post to the main blog of your site. Getting other perspectives and com­
ments from your community “experts” is incredibly cool, and you might be 
able to build a series of posts from other bloggers into your site.
This kind of blogging trade-off can let you have multiple voices fill out the 
content on your site and provide a richer experience for your readers.
	
These relationships are great to have when you get sick or want to take a 
vacation. Tap your guest-blogging community for help covering your blog 
when you aren’t around to do it.
Try E-Mail and Newsletters
As spam-ridden as electronic mail can be, you can still use it to stay in con­
tact with your community. Offering e-mail delivery of some or all of your blog 
content to your readers can attract users who aren’t comfortable with some 
of the fancier technologies, such as RSS. Try these three tactics:
	
✓	Let your readers send a blog post to a friend who might also be 
interested.
	
✓	Let your users sign up for e-mail notifications when you post something 
new to your blog.
	
✓	Let your readers sign up for an e-mail newsletter that supplements your 
blog or recaps recent blog posts of interest.
Many blog software programs have built-in Tell a Friend or Email a Friend 
functionality. If you turn this feature on, every blog post includes a small 
icon or link that, when clicked, lets your reader fill out the name and e-mail 
address of a friend and send an e-mail notification about your blog post to 
that friend. It’s like free marketing. Figure 20-1 shows an Email to a Friend 
form on the Improv Everywhere blog (www.improveverywhere.com).

Figure 20-1: 
The Email

feature lets 
you clue

about a

post.
	
You can easily reach users who have mastered e-mail, but aren’t up on news­
readers and RSS, by setting up your blog to allow users to sign up for e-mail 
notifications when you post a new blog entry. Allowing them to sign up and 
also remove themselves from your e-mail system puts them in control of the 
situation, which means that you don’t contribute to the spam problem. The 
FeedBurner site (http://feedburner.google.com) lets you set up an 
e-mail notification/subscription tool.
Taking the time to create some kind of additional e-mail newsletter can also 
get people interested in your website. You can take a little time at the end of 
each calendar month to pick out your best or most popular blog posts. You 
can include the links to your blog posting, or you can copy and paste the 
blog post into an e-mail and send it off.
You can create this kind of newsletter in several ways, but it’s most effec­
tive if you sign up for an e-mail service provider such as Constant Contact

(www.constantcontact.com), Topica (www.topica.com), Emma (www.
myemma.com), MailChimp (www.mailchimp.com) or Lyris HQ (www.lyris.
com/solutions/lyris-hq/email-marketing), to name a few. These ser­
vices can handle subscription requests, unsubscribe requests, and changes 
of e-mail addresses, all without needing you to do anything. In addition, most 
of them offer you the capability to track click-throughs on links in your news­
letters and track whom you e-mail and when.
	
You can find a few free mailing-list options out there, but most of them involve 
a monthly fee. Shop around to find one that fits your price range.
Track and Customize
What does your community like to read? Do the members like your posts 
about your personal life, or are they more interested in what you’re doing 
in your daily job? Or is it your opinion about some other topic that you’ve 
discussed?
Watch to see what element of your content is most popular and what gets the 
most comments and responses. Don’t confuse posts that get responses with 
posts that people like — you want to know what people are interested in and 
willing to comment on, not what they like. Controversial blog posts are most 
likely to generate conversation and feedback.
Knowing what’s popular in your blog can help you when you write later 
on because you can draw on this knowledge to create more posts that get 
responses. Keep an eye on those posts that get lots of comment and under­
stand their appeal to your audience as you make decisions about what to 
post about in the future. You can find out more about understanding your 
audience in Chapter 9, and get some help with content in Chapter 8.
	
Also, pay attention to what posts are unpopular and try to refrain from cover­
ing that content again.
You can also turn this information into additional resources for your read­
ers. TechCrunch (www.techcrunch.com), for instance, tracks the posts that 
get the most comments and displays them in an Actively Discussed Posts 
box, which is shown in Figure 20-2. If you assume that the blog posts with the 
most comments are the most interesting, readers can use this box as a short­
cut to find the best content on the blog.

Develop Solutions
Pay attention to what’s going on in your community so that you can find solu­
tions to problems when they arise. Communities grow and change, but they 
don’t thrive unless you resolve issues such as spam or technical problems.
I can’t describe this suggestion very well because each community’s prob­
lems are unique. Just know that you need to keep on top of any problems 
that do come up.
For instance, if your blog readers start complaining about seeing too many 
spam comments on your blog, you need to find and implement some spam 
prevention tools and techniques. If you fail to do so, you risk losing your 
readers who get frustrated with having to skip every other comment on your 
blog.
Other possible problem areas might include flame wars between overheated 
readers, slow web servers, or too long a turnaround between when a reader 
submits a comment and when it actually appears on the site. (For the full 
scoop on comments and spam, see Chapter 9.)

 Chapter 20: Ten Ways of Growing Community
Check Your Code and Software
Make your blog accessible to all web users. Your HTML code needs to be 
flexible enough to display in the many web browsers out there, and it must 
accommodate browsers used by people who are blind. Whether you’re keep­
ing the website design code clean or offering RSS feeds, you’re ultimately 
responsible for making your site work for your readers.
It’s a hard fact to accept, but it’s true: Your blog doesn’t look the same on 
your monitor and in your browser as it does on other computers and in other 
browsers.
Test your designs and test your RSS feeds in as many places as possible. 
Keep checking back to see whether anything changes over time. For instance, 
when Microsoft upgraded Internet Explorer from version 6 to 7, many web­
sites experienced display problems that the site owners had to resolve. And 
of course, a blog grows, which means that the load your site puts on your 
web server changes over time.
Here are some important questions to ask yourself:
	
✓	How does your site behave with 500 blog posts, versus the 10 or 20 you 
started with?
	
✓	Can Google’s newsreader display your RSS feed? What about Bloglines? 
How about . . . you get the picture. Chapter 14 is dedicated to all things 
RSS-related.
	
✓	Does the podcast that you listed with iTunes still appear in its directory? 
Can someone subscribe to it? Does iTunes deliver it?
	
✓	Are the images in old blog posts still available and viewable on the site?
	
✓	Do you regularly exceed the bandwidth allowances provided by your 
web host? Does your site run slowly at certain times of the day?
Changes, no matter how small, in design code or blog software programming 
can have unintended results. Be sure to look at your own blog on several 
computers every few weeks. Try leaving comments, using the search feature, 
clicking links, and generally kicking the tires on a regular basis.
Have Contests
Everyone loves to get free stuff! If traffic is lagging and needs a boost, try 
holding a giveaway or contest to spur more interaction. You could have a 
candy giveaway or offer up that rusting Chevy in your backyard. You need to 
www.it-ebooks.info

352
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
make your community members do something in order to get this free stuff 
that you see fit to give away.
By having contests on your blog, you can build your site traffic. You can 
make the contests almost anything: writing contests, reward points for dif­
ferent levels of activity, writing and submitting blog posts, and so on. Hold a 
seasonal contest, such as best costume during Halloween or most romantic 
date idea on Valentine’s Day.
The possibilities are practically endless. Get hokey and create memorable 
contests. Sometimes, the sillier you get, the better the response from your 
readers.
	
If you’re running a business blog, be sure that you understand the legal issues 
surrounding contests; legal requirements can vary state by state, and you 
might have to deal with national laws, as well.
Ask Your Readers
One of the best things that you can do for the community is to make sure that 
everyone’s having the best time they can. How do you know whether your 
readers enjoy their time on your blog? Why not just ask?
Give people a way to let you know whether the community aspects of your 
site work for them by including a Contact Me page. But if you really want to 
hear about how things are going, try just posting a blog entry asking people 
for their thoughts and constructive criticism about what you’re doing.
You likely will get great new ideas, as well as help identify real problems. In 
fact, your readers will probably give you bonus points for asking for their 
input!

Ten Tools for Mobile Blogging
W

hen you’re committed to the blogging lifestyle, the daily grind might 
feel overwhelming at times — writing, tinkering with blog software, 
preparing images, and repeating the process over and over. Luckily for you, 
a slew of websites and software can spice things up and banish any boredom 
you’re experiencing, all while attracting new readers to your blog.
Making It Mobile with Mobify
Do you have a blog already but aren’t happy with how it looks when you view 
it on a smartphone or on an Apple iPad? Mobify is a great solution. Sign up 
for free at www.mobify.com and use the Mobify GUI Picker to tell mobile 
browsers what parts of your blog to display, and even make modifications to 
how those elements display. You need to know HTML and CSS to really make 
the most of this tool, but when that work is done, you can simply continue to 
publish your blog as you normally do and the mobile version is created auto­
matically. Mobify even helps you with media files that might be problematic 
to display on mobile devices by optimizing the content for different devices.
Mobify works by detecting Internet visits from mobile devices and routing 
them to the mobile version, so there’s virtually nothing for you to do to main­
tain your mobile site after you’ve set things up.
Going Mobile with Blogger
Many blog software packages include options that allow you to blog from the 
road using your phone (not while you’re driving, natch!). If you can text or 
send e-mail from your phone, you can post to your blog.
Blogger, which I cover extensively in Chapter 4, is one such tool. The easi­
est way to get started with Blogger is to set up your Mail2Blogger address in 
the settings of a blog you have already set up. From that point, anything you 
send to that address is automatically added as a blog post, so a phone with 
e-mail capability can be used for blogging while you’re on the road or away

from your computer. You can tell Blogger to hold those posts as drafts, or 
publish them immediately.
Blogger can also create a mobile version of your blog, and you can get 
started at www.blogger.com/mobile-start.g. Sending a text from a 
U.S.-based mobile phone to BLOGGR (256447) or e-mail to go@blogger.com 
starts the ball rolling.
	
If you’re sending e-mail or texts from your phone to your blog, you might have 
to pay for these services from your mobile phone provider, although Blogger’s 
services are free.
Posting to WordPress on Your iPad
The popular blogging software and service WordPress has made an app 
specific for blogging on your iPad or iPhone. Both are available through the 
Apple iTunes App Store and are free.
After you install the app, you can log in to your WordPress account, whether 
it’s one you have installed on your own web host or run through the hosted 
WordPress.com website. Writing posts works very similarly to using the web 
interface, and you can also edit existing posts, add images, and so on.
You can also moderate comments, a task that never sleeps, whether or not 
you happen to have a computer in front of you. All this from a free app!
	
You need to be running WordPress 2.9.2 or higher to use the app with a self-
hosted blog.
Tying Into Tumblr
Tumblr (www.tumblr.com), a fun and popular microblogging service, also 
offers a custom app for the iPhone. You can post photos, videos, audio, 
quotes, links, and text. And, if you keep multiple Tumblr blogs (they can be 
addictive!), you can manage all of them through the app.
Additional features allow you to use your iPhone address book, post to 
Twitter, and reply to Tumblr messages. Frankly, it’s a lot like using the web­
site itself!
I take that back. In some ways, it’s actually easier! If you want to post a photo, 
for example, starting a photo post actually brings up the camera interface of 
the iPhone, allowing you to take the photo on the spot. Talk about instanta­
neous blogging! This is a free app in the iTunes App Store.

Blogsy
Blogsy (www.blogsyapp.com) is an app that really knocks my socks off. 
This iPad application ties so many of the online services I use together that it 
makes blogging a snap. First of all, it’s just a great method for creating a blog 
post, with easy-to-use text formatting and linking tools.
But its real magic comes into play when you want to integrate a piece of 
media you created and uploaded to the Internet using another web service. 
With a few quick steps to log in to your accounts, you can:
	
✓	Insert an image from your Flickr or Picasa accounts, even resizing and 
aligning it within your blog post.
	
✓	Stream a video from your YouTube account.
	
✓	Find images to use in Google Image Search.
	
✓	Upload images that are already on your iPad.
You can use Blogsy to create posts for WordPress (either a blog on your own 
server or the hosted version), Blogger, or Posterous, and there are plans in 
the works to add support for other platforms as well.
Get Blogsy for $4.99 in the Apple iTunes Store.
Analyzing on the Road
Are you one of those bloggers who’s hooked on knowing stats? Do you check 
to see how many unique visitors you have on a daily basis? If so, you prob­
ably use Google Analytics, and I have good news: Now you can feed your 
obsession from your iPhone or iPad.
A number of programs can give you access to a Google Analytics account; 
Analytics Pro is a great one. You can use Google Analytics to track stats on 
multiple websites, and Analytics Pro lets you do the same using many of the 
same tools — you see graphs, reports, thumbnails, and maps galore.
If you need to keep track of hourly visitor statistics, this app lets you do so 
while you’re traveling, at a conference, or in a meeting. But don’t blame me if 
you get hooked!

Feeding Your Habit with Feedly
It goes hand in hand that bloggers read other blogs. In fact, if you’re like me, 
you spend far more time consuming blog posts than you do creating them. 
One mobile application that I have come to rely on heavily is Feedly (www.
feedly.com), a newsreader that syncs up with your Google Reader account.
Feedly’s minimalistic design and interface elements put the highlight on the 
content of the blogs you read, and make it simple to jump through a series of 
posts from a single blog.
You can install Feedly on the iPhone, iPad, Android devices, and even in the 
Safari, Firefox, and Chrome browsers. Feedly has put a lot of emphasis on the 
common sharing tools, so you can also share posts you find interesting with 
Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and e-mail.
One of the Feedly features I particularly like is the suggestions it makes for 
other blogs you might enjoy based on those you already read. This feature 
makes it easy for me to find new and interesting blogs in my limited time.
Get Feedly for free in the Apple iTunes Store.
Sharing Photos with Instagram
If you have a yen to share your photos and get instant feedback on them, I 
recommend you check out Instagram, a very lightweight photo blogging tool 
for the iPhone that also is a social network.
Take photos with your phone, and share them in Instagram, complete with 
captions, geolocation information, and tie-ins to Flickr, Twitter, Tumblr, 
Foursquare, and Posterous. Your followers see your photos in a feed, and can 
“like” and comment on them, and of course, you have your own feed to view 
the photos of others.
Sound simple? It really is. It’s also fun. When you share your photo, you can 
choose from a selection of very cool filters (sepia tone, anyone?) and focus 
effects. Your prosaic photo can feel like a work of art in mere seconds.
Get Instagram for free in the Apple iTunes Store.

Journaling Your Life with 280daily
280daily is an exercise in dedication. Every day at 4:00 p.m., this service 
sends you a message, asking you to sum up your day in 280 characters — 
about 50 words. This is a blogging tool, but it isn’t a public one! You’re the 
only person who will ever see your 280daily posts. It truly is an online diary.
280daily doesn’t have a mobile app as of this writing (although they say they 
are working on one), but it does have a beautifully simple mobile version of 
the website (www.280daily.com). When you’re on the road, a phone or 
other handheld device with a browser will let you keep your journal updated.

Ten Blogs You Should Know
B

ecause so many blogs are floating about in the blogosphere, you can’t 
possibly read them all. In the beginning, only a handful of blogs were 
known well enough to attract solid audiences. A few short years later, well 
over 100 million different blogs exist, and each one attracts its own audience. 
This book makes reference to a number of blogs, but there’s always room for 
more. This chapter includes a short list of some of the blogs that I find most 
interesting and useful.
Take the time to visit each of these blogs. Not only do they feature great con­
tent, but you also can discover what these bloggers do to achieve blogging 
success.
Engadget
www.engadget.com
In March 2004, Peter Rojas, cofounder of the blog Gizmodo, launched 
Engadget. Engadget is a contributor-supported blog that has posts written by 
several writers; it features articles about consumer technology and boasts 
lively discussions in the comments section.
Engadget is one of those blogs that you can’t live without. It has won a 
number of awards and been translated into several different languages. If 
you have any interest in gadgets (I know you do!) and want to find out more 
about them, you can’t go wrong in subscribing to Engadget. And if you want 
to explore the podcast milieu, don’t miss the weekly Engadget podcast.

If you like reading funny blogs, you’ll love Hyperbole and a Half, written by 
Allie Brosh, whose prose will make you laugh, and whose laughably terrible 
(yet evocative) illustrations will make you laugh until you cry. Hyperbole and 
a Half is a classic personal blog — the personal diary of an amusing writer 
who blogs when she feels like it about whatever she wants to. Brosh started 
the blog after getting positive feedback on funny Facebook updates, and 
covers everything from depression to her childhood experiences with a fishy 
best friend. (Hint: Things go terribly wrong.)
Young House Love
www.younghouselove.com
Sherry and John Petersik could be cuter, but I’m not sure how. These ambi­
tious young marrieds blog about their adventures refurbishing and reno­
vating old homes (they are on their second). Neither has a background in 
construction, so their renovations are total DIY efforts, from tiling, bathroom 
remodeling, and cabinet refinishing.
The two have parleyed their skills into a regular column in Better Homes & 
Gardens Do It Yourself Magazine and also blog for BabyCenter. All this means 
that besides renovating their home, the two are making their living as full-
time bloggers.
One look at their blog tells you why. Sherry and John write well and enter­
tainingly, and the photos that accompany each post are a fantastic addition.
Lifehacker
www.lifehacker.com
Lifehacker is a daily blog that features tips, tricks, and software downloads 
that can help you get things done more quickly and more efficiently. Several 
core writers helm the blog, devising new ways to do your day-to-day activi­
ties. They do write blog-specific tips, and many of their other posts have 
ideas that you can adapt for blogging.
Started in 2005, Lifehacker has produced a lot of content that’s useful and 
may give you ideas about how you can increase your blogging success. 
They’ve also turned their blog into a couple of books!

and texting. Ever made a typo when sending a text? Ever had your phone 
“correct” it for you and make it worse? 
I regularly tell people I “lobe” them instead of “love” them myself. But that’s 
nothing compared to some of the hilarious and awful screenshots of phone 
screens you’ll find on this blog.

Improv Everywhere
www.improveverywhere.com
Improv Everywhere is a blog that documents “scenes of chaos and joy” orga­
nized in New York City public spaces by Charlie Todd. Todd brings together 
volunteers for lighthearted “missions” that take them into public spaces to 
do unexpected activities.
In October 2009, Todd organized a group dog walk. More than 2,000 people 
made the most of the day by taking their furry friends into the streets of 
Brooklyn for about an hour. The catch was — the dogs were all invisible. The 
dog walkers carried leashes and never let on to spectators that there was 
anything peculiar about what was going on. Some onlookers were frustrated 
not to know what was happening, but others played along by asking politely 
about the dog’s breed and petting them. Good fun!
Todd organizes these events irregularly, but they all make great, entertaining 
reading.

Appendix A
Glossary
aggregator: A collector of information about a topic or idea. An aggregator 
can be a person, blog, or website. Technologically speaking, RSS is an aggre­
gation format for individual blogs. Google News is an example of a website 
that aggregates news for many sources.
audio blog: See podcast.
blog: A chronological log of information kept by an individual, a group, or 
a business. The term blog is a merging of the words web and log. On a typi­
cal blog, the most recent post appears at the top of the page, usually time-
stamped. Scrolling down the page takes the reader to older posts. Each post 
usually offers an opportunity for readers to interact by adding their com­
ments and may also display Trackback information about other blogs that 
have linked to this post. Blog content is determined entirely by the author(s) 
of the blog; therefore, many are personal journals, but others are focused 
aggregations of news or commentary.
blogger: The author of a blog.
blogging: Producing blog posts. A blogger blogs on his or her blog.
blogosphere: The community of blogs and bloggers around the world.
blogroll: A collection of links used or recommended by an individual blogger. 
A blogroll is usually shown in a column on a blog.
buzz marketing: A no-cost or low-cost method of marketing associated with 
people telling other people about a company’s products or services. Buzz 
marketing is based on peoples’ direct experiences with specific products or 
on the experiences others have related to them.
comment: A piece of feedback left by a reader on a blog post.
CSS: This acronym stands for Cascading Style Sheets, an advanced HTML 
technique that permits fine control and layout of a website and quick 
changes in formats across the site.

entry: See post.
feed: See RSS.
feedreader: See newsreader.
follow: On Twitter, the act of subscribing to read the updates posted by 
another member. Unsubscribing is unfollowing.
friend: On Facebook and other social networks, the act of identifying another 
member as a part of your network; usually tied with access to information 
posted by that member for friends only, as well as allowing others to see 
who’s in your group of friends.
FTP: File Transfer Protocol is the mechanism that allows transfer of files and 
data from one computer to another.
hit: A request to a web server for a file. When the web page (which often 
consists of multiple files) is downloaded from a server, the number of hits is 
equal to the number of files requested. Thus, one page view can often equal 
more than one hit, which means that counting the hits is typically an inaccu­
rate measure of web traffic.
HTML: HyperText Markup Language is the computer coding used by web 
designers to create web pages.
hyperlink: See links.
keyword: The content and/or type of meta tag included in a web page’s 
HTML code to help index the page. The term keyword also refers to terms or 
phrases that a user submits to a search engine when looking for content on 
the Internet.
links: A link, or hyperlink, is a navigation tool that allows a user to go from 
one web location to another by clicking. Links are typically underlined.
meme: Ideas that evolve virally. While bloggers post, comment on other 
blogs, post about posts on other blogs, and add their own thoughts, a meme 
spreads across the Internet, changing while it goes. Some groups spread 
memes consciously by participating in answering a set of questions or post­
ing on a topic, but most memes are a natural byproduct of interesting topics.
meta tag: HTML tags used in a web page to describe the document to search 
engines. Common tags are title, keyword, and description. Title and descrip­
tion are frequently displayed in search results; keywords are used to deter­
mine when a site should be returned as a search result.
micro blog: A blog composed of extremely brief text or multimedia posts.

moderation: The regulation of an online community; specifically, the con­
tributions made by users to discussion forums or blog comment threads. 
Moderation may include removal of content if that content is deemed inap­
propriate.
moderator: A person granted special privileges to enforce the rules of an 
online community by removing or changing content from individual posts.
newsreader: Software used to subscribe to and then read blog and website 
RSS feeds.
page view: A request to load a single page of a website. Counting page views 
can help determine whether any change made to the page results in more or 
fewer visits.
permalink: Short for permanent link. A page of a blog that contains a single 
blog post and usually any comments on that post. Permalinks allow users to 
link directly to a single post for more accurate reference.
photoblog: A blog composed entirely of images, sometimes with caption 
information.
ping: A ping occurs when one computer asks another whether it’s there; the 
second computer confirms its presence/location/status. In the blogosphere, 
many bloggers alert blog aggregation websites with a ping when posting a 
new entry.
podcast: A digital media file that’s distributed over the Internet by using 
feeds with the intention for viewers to download it and play it back on por­
table media players and personal computers. This can be an audio file or a 
video file.
post: A publication to a blog, possibly containing text, images, and other 
media. A post can also be called an entry.
RSS: Stands for Really Simple Syndication. An XML-based feed of a blog’s post­
ings that blog aggregation sites or software pick up.
sidebar: A column to the right or left of the main content of your blog. 
Usually, blog software comes with some content already in the sidebar, such 
as links to your categories, archives, and RSS feed. Bloggers can customize 
sidebars with additional common and uncommon elements.
spam: Unsolicited electronic messages sent in bulk that may be commercial, 
nonsensical, or malicious. In addition to creating e-mail spam, spammers can 
target blog comments and blog forums.

nontext media and organize information for easy searching.
tagging: The act of adding tags to a photo, video, audio file, or blog post.
trackback: A mechanism that tracks references to a blog posting that occurs 
on other blogs. Trackbacks are designed to help readers find other blogs that 
discuss the same topic. They also let bloggers know what another blogger 
has blogged about and linked to a post.
troll: A blog reader who posts offensive, personal attacks that interfere with 
the conversation between blogger and readers.
tweet: A post or update on the micro-blogging website Twitter.
unique visits: A statistic used to count the visitors to a website, counting 
each visitor only once in the timeframe of the report. The number of unique

a system in which the content during editing appears very similar to the end 
result.
XML: XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language, and it allows publishers to 
build their own structures into markup languages. You can use XML for any 
kind of structured information, and it’s intended to allow information to pass 
to any computer system, regardless of the platform that the computer uses.

Appendix B
Very Basic HTML Code
O

n a blog, code can mean many things. It can refer to the complicated 
programming that makes up the software that runs your blog, or it can 
mean simple styles that make written words look cool when displayed on 
your blog. In this appendix, you can find out how to make the text in your 
blog posts look like a million bucks. (Leave the blogging software code to the 
experts.)
The code that you’re working with affects only a given blog post; the blog 
software itself builds the blog pages. So, you don’t have to know very many 
pieces of code — just the code commonly used to format text and photos, or 
to insert video files.
	
Most of the code that you need to format your blog posts is HTML (HyperText 
Markup Language).
Documents formatted by using HTML really consist of nothing but text, 
which your Internet browser can read and then display. HTML code tells 
your browser all kinds of things, such as how the text on the screen should 
be aligned and what text links to what web page. You can easily use HTML. 
With a few exceptions, each bit of code, or tag, includes opening and closing 
elements, which surround the content that you want to affect. A few tags are 
standalone elements that you insert in only one spot. With HTML, you basi­
cally use code to mark up text, photos, and other elements.
Adding Headings, Paragraphs, 
and Line Breaks
You generally want to break up long blocks of text in your blog posts, maybe 
even throw in labels here and there. Styling headers, adding line breaks, and 
making sure that you divide the text of your blog into paragraphs can really 
improve the flow of your posts.

Part VIII: Appendixes 
Headings
HTML has six levels of headings. H1 is the most important and largest, H2 is 
slightly less important and smaller, and so on. The final heading is H6, but 
people rarely use that heading level because it produces very small text. For 
most cases, first- and second-level headers do the job, giving you text larger 
than the main body text (and these headings usually are in bold). You can 
implement header tags by inserting code like this:
<h1>The most important heading ever</h1>
Like a light switch, the tag turns on before the first letter of your header and 
turns off after the last character.
You use all headers in the same way — just substitute in place of the number 
1 a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. For example
<h2>The second most important heading ever</h2>
Figure B-1 shows each of the header tags as the browser interprets and dis­
plays them.
	
Figure B-1: 
Headers 
from the 
largest to 
the smallest.
	
	
Headers have more than just an effect on how your text looks: Search engines 
understand that text defined by a header tag is important, so words and 
phrases that you enclose in a header are marked as especially relevant to 
your site, and search engine results lists will place your website higher when 
search terms match words in your headers.

373
 Appendix B: Very Basic HTML Code
Paragraphs
To create paragraph breaks, you need to start the new paragraph with a <p> 
tag. The closing </p> is placed at the end of the paragraph after the text, like 
this (see Figure B-2 for how the browser displays this code):
<p>Paragraph one has amazing text in it.</p>
<p>Paragraph two has amazing text in it too.</p>
<p>Paragraph three is being neglected by the first and 
second paragraphs.</p>
	
Figure B-2: 
Text para-
graphs, 
displayed 
by a web 
browser.
	
Most blogging software makes provision for paragraph breaks automatically, 
but if you ever end up looking at the code, you can recognize these funda­
mentally important tags. On most websites, paragraph breaks actually pro­
duce the effect of two line breaks, so paragraphs are spaced out from each 
other in the same way that they are in this book.
You can end a line of text and start the next word on a new line by using a 
<br> tag. You need to insert these standalone tags only once: There is no 
closing <br> tag. To create a line break, here’s what you do:
Break your line of text<br>
and start again on the next line.
Emphasizing Text
Dress up your text by using italics, underlining, bold, or even strikethrough 
code. You can add these text features by using HTML on/off tags, so you 
place the first tag at the start of the text that you want to affect and follow 
the text with the closing tag. Figure B-3 shows how each of the following code 
examples appears in a web browser.

Part VIII: Appendixes 
	
Figure B-3: 
Use bold, 
italics, 
underlining, 
and strik-
ethrough in 
your HTML 
to make 
your text 
pop.
	
Here are the codes for each kind of text:
	
✓	Bold: <b> or <strong>
<b>Some of this text</b> is bold.
	
✓	Italics: <i> or <em>
<i>Some of this text</i> is italicized.
	
✓	Underline: <u>
Add punch with an <u>underline</u>.
	
✓	Strikethrough: <strike>
Correct an error <strike>by striking it out</strike>.
	
Even though the preceding list shows you how to underline text in your blog 
posts, I don’t actually recommend that you use this style. As you know, under­
lining commonly indicates links online, so your readers may be very confused 
to see underlined text that isn’t also a link.
Linking Up
In HTML, links are defined with the <a> tag (the a stands for anchor). But 
that isn’t all! This special tag also gets what’s called an attribute and a value, 
to go along with the basic tag. The attribute, href, indicates to the browser 
that what comes next is a hypertext reference — in this case, a web page. 
The value is the actual web page that the code links to, enclosed in quotation 
marks. Here’s how all that looks in action:
This link goes to <a href=”http://www.google.com”>Google</a>.
If you post the preceding line in a blog, the word Google appears as a click­
able link that leads to the Google website.

 Appendix B: Very Basic HTML Code
	
Make sure that you use the full URL when you create a link — including the 
http://! Unless you include that prefix, the browser doesn’t understand that 
it needs to find another website. Instead, it looks for a document on your web­
site called http://www.google.com.
Also, when you turn off the tag, you need to turn off only the main tag, not 
the attribute or value. Those extras are turned off automatically when you 
use the closing </a> tag.
You can also use this tag around an image to make the image clickable to a 
web page. Simply place the tag around your image code, like so:
<a href=”http://www.google.com”><img src=”googlelogo.gif”></a>
Making Lists
Lists can let people know about your favorite kinds of candy, music, or what­
ever. With a little help from your friendly HTML, you can create unordered 
lists or ordered lists. You create all lists, no matter the flavor, by using a 
series of HTML tags. These tags make lists a bit tricky to implement, so pay 
close attention to those closing tags — they’re easy to forget.
An unordered list is a series of bulleted items. You can use this kind of list for 
items that don’t require numbering. For example, if you want to create a list 
of cat breeds, you don’t need to list them in any particular order. Unordered 
lists use the <ul> and <li> tags. Set up the code as I do in this list of kinds 
of chocolate:
<ul>
<li>Milk.</li>
<li>Dark.</li>
<li>White.</li>
</ul>
The <ul> tag stands for unordered list, and it turns on at the beginning of the 
list and turns off following the last item in the list. The <li> tag stands for list 
item; it turns on at the beginning of each new item and turns off at the end of 
that item. Figure B-4 shows an unordered list.

dered lists

Part VIII: Appendixes 
An ordered list contains items that use numbers instead of bullet points 
and are perfect for steps lists or creating lists with content that needs to be 
ranked. Format an ordered list the same way you format an unordered list (as 
discussed in the preceding section), but substitute the <ol> tag for the <ul> 
tag (see Figure B-5):
<ol>
<li>Get a graham cracker.</li>
<li>Lay on a piece of chocolate.</li>
<li>Add a toasted marshmallow.</li>
<li>Add a second graham cracker on top, squish 
marshmallow, and eat.</li>
</ol>
	
Figure B-5: 
Ordered 
lists work 
well for 
instructions.
	
You can embed a list inside another list. In fact, you can even embed a differ­
ent kind of list into a list. Each time you embed a new list, the web browser 
creates additional indenting, giving you a nice stair-stepped look in your 
final page. Here’s how you format the code that places an unordered sub-list 
inside an ordered list in a s’mores recipe:
<ol>
<li>Get a graham cracker.</li>
<li>Lay on a piece of chocolate. It can be:
   <ul>
   <li> Milk</li>
   <li> Dark</li>
   <li> White</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li>Add a toasted marshmallow.</li>
<li>Add a second graham cracker on top, squish 
marshmallow, and eat.</li>
</ol>
