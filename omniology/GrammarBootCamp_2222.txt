BOOT CAMP
English Grammar Boot Camp

s it who or whom? When do we use between instead of among? What is a 
comma splice or a misplaced modifier—and why do they matter? Is it true 
that you shouldn’t end a sentence with a preposition? This course explores 
all of these well-known usage questions alongside some less well-known 
ones, such as whether it’s legitimate to criticize the past participle proven 
or the use of however at the beginning of a sentence. In each case, you will 
get clear explanations of the terminology and judicious advice about how to 
handle the usage issue as a writer and as a speaker.
This course delves into the technical details of everything from pronouns 
to participles to passives to punctuation with a liveliness that will delight 
the grammar geek. You will learn why the verb go turns into went in the 
past tense, how “go slow” works differently from “feel bad,” and whether 
we really should say “It is I” rather than “It is me.” You will have the chance 
to work through the conundrum of making a possessive out of a noun that 
ends in –s and decide on the proper plural of emoji. The course never 
settles for easy answers, such as “Don’t use the passive voice.” One entire 
lecture is devoted to when passive sentences are useful and when they are 
ineffective, with detailed clarification of when a sentence that might look 
passive is not passive.
At every turn, the course tells the stories behind the rules. You will never 
look at a grammar checker’s correction of a which into a that once you 
know how H.W. Fowler viewed this “rule” when he first introduced it. The 
rule about not splitting infinitives does not seem to go back to Latin, despite 
the folklore along those lines, and you’ll be surprised by the power of a 
letter to the editor.

The pronoun they has been singular since before Shakespeare could 
use it (which he did), and it was an 18th-century woman grammarian who 
introduced the rule that he could function generically. Why did the American 
Dialect Society then vote singular they the Word of the Year for 2015? 
These historical facts bring usage rules to life and give you context to make 
informed decisions about current usage questions. 
To help you make these decisions, the course pulls back the curtain on 
language authority and provides you an insider’s view on judgments by 
the American Heritage Dictionary Usage Panel. It introduces language 
databases where you can explore your own questions, such as whether 
based off is replacing based on (the answer is not yet) and whether 
published academic writing starts sentences with And (the answer is a 
resounding yes).
By the end of this course, you will be able to use this knowledge of 
grammar to your advantage as a speaker and writer. You will have a new 
understanding of what makes writing “choppy”—and how to fix it. And you 
will see why writing a speech needs to be different from writing an essay to 
help your audience follow what you’re saying. 
Have you wondered why the Oxford comma is called the Oxford comma? 
Or is your concern whether you should enforce the rule about using the 
Oxford comma? Answers to all such questions await, framed in a way that 
allows you to approach grammar with meticulous care and a fun sense  
of exploration. ■

Lecture 1  ▪  Why Do We Care about Grammar?
Lecture
1
“A
ptitude is essential; but equally as important is the desire to learn.” 
That sentence was on the usage ballot for the American Heritage 
Dictionary of the English Language (AHD) in fall 2015. All the members 
of the Usage Panel were asked to vote on the sentence, using these 
categories: acceptable, somewhat acceptable, somewhat unacceptable, 
or completely unacceptable. At issue: Is the phrase equally as redundant? 
Fifty-three percent of the panel deemed the sentence unacceptable. The 
panel tipped toward rejecting the sentence—but was still split. Blurry lines 
like that are what we’ll discuss throughout this course.
About Usage
■
■
The Usage Panel was created by AHD in the late 1960s to give 
dictionary users guidance about formal writing. The panel surveys 
a group of highly educated people invested in language. Today, 
there are about 200 members, including academics, journalists, 
creative writers, radio personalities, and linguists.
■
■
Members vote on whatever grounds they choose: personal 
preference, favorite usage guides, data about actual usage, and 
so on.
■
■
There isn’t some objective measure of whether a grammatical 
construction is acceptable. And judgments about acceptability 
change over time—as we’ll see in this course. This is one of the 
things that make studying grammar endlessly interesting. 
Why Do We Care
about Grammar?

5
English Grammar Boot Camp
■
■
If you can accept and even embrace the complexity and subtlety 
of what “acceptable” means when it comes to usage, you can 
write and edit with even more nuance. It allows you to be careful in 
the best sense of that word: to care about the language and how 
to use it best in any given situation. 
■
■
We can master the usage rules that help us write appropriate and 
even beautiful prose—and we can recognize where usage guides 
don’t agree because the language is changing or because our 
sensibilities are changing.
■
■
There are bits of grammar that grammarians have paid a lot of 
attention to over the decades and made pronouncements about. 
Two examples are split infinitives and ending sentences with 
prepositions.
■
■
There are also bits of grammar people haven’t noticed as much. 
An example: Is it “have showed” or “have shown”? No one seems 

6
Lecture 1  ▪  Why Do We Care about Grammar? ﻿﻿
to care right now. Both are acceptable in formal prose. However, 
that is not the case for everyone with “proved” versus “proven.”
An Open Mind
■
■
This course will ask you to keep an open mind—to think about 
grammar in what may be a new way. That’s not to say we should 
throw out all usage rules we’ve learned. The conventions of formal, 
edited English can be very valuable. 
■
■
Advice in usage guides, which we’ll be covering in this course, 
helps you to write clearer, more aesthetically pleasing prose. 
Some rules about formal grammar can help you avoid ambiguity 
and capture tone and prosody on the page. 
■
■
But it’s valuable to distinguish “preferable” from “correct” or “the 
only acceptable thing.” It’s worth asking questions about a usage 
rule that has been handed down for generations. Asking those 
questions and making those distinctions makes us even savvier 
writers and speakers: We can make deliberate, informed decisions 
about language we want to use in context.
■
■
Linguists are sometimes accused of being hypocrites because 
they point out the very humanness of the rules that govern formal, 
edited English and sometimes their faulty logic, and then often 
follow those rules when they write books and articles. 
■
■
One way to deal with this conundrum is to avoid your pet peeves 
in your own writing, but resist inappropriately correcting them in 
the writing of others; for example, you might avoid writing the word 
impactful, but since its use is now widespread, correcting it in the 
work of others is harder to justify.
Some Terms
■
■
The term usage means how words and phrases are used in speech 
and writing. This is understood broadly to cover pronunciation, 
word meaning, morphology, syntax, and punctuation.

7
English Grammar Boot Camp
■
■
Grammar is typically used more narrowly in linguistics to cover 
morphology and syntax (not pronunciation and punctuation). 
However, some “grammar books” out there cover pronunciation 
and punctuation
■
■
Both grammar and usage can be used descriptively to refer to 
what speakers and writers actually do with the language and 
to refer to what they should do to demonstrate “good usage” or  
“good grammar.”
Your Inner Grammando and This Course
■
■
The term grammando is a great word introduced by Lizzie 
Skurnick in The New York Times Magazine. Grammando means 
“one who constantly corrects others’ linguistic mistakes.” The 
example Skurnick gives is, “Cowed by his grammando wife, Arthur 
finally ceased saying ‘irregardless.’” 
■
■
If you are someone with an opinionated, fairly outspoken inner 
grammando, this course will ask you to get in touch with that inner 
grammando. You can start a dialogue where the two of you can 
revisit usage questions your inner grammando might think are 
already settled. 
■
■
Why? What are the benefits of this dialogue? It will make you even 
more careful, with an increased sensitivity to role of context and 
effects of language change. It will also make you more confident 
that you aren’t getting it wrong when you are helping others  
with usage
■
■
More importantly, it allows us to understand language difference 
as difference, not deficit. Language is a key part of culture, and 
understanding the diversity in our language is an important part of 
understanding the diversity among speakers. We can help others 
master the conventions of standard, formal usage without making 
others feel bad about themselves or their language.

■
If you are someone who feels some insecurity about your mastery 
of grammar, this course asks you to believe that you know more 
than you think you do. You “know grammar” because you are able 
to communicate. You may not know all the terminology or all the 
formal usage rules for written English, but you know a whole lot 
about how English grammar works.
□
□
The fun thing about this course is that we will unpack, analyze, 
and put labels on all of this knowledge that you carry around 
with you—and talk about the usage rules that may distinguish 
written English from spoken English.
□
□
With all of this knowledge, we can be ever more skilled 
speakers and writers. We’ll also learn a lot of great facts about 
the elaborate system and kooky idiosyncrasies in English 
grammar.
■
■
The next two lectures address prescriptive and descriptive 
approaches to grammar. Then, after a quick review of some 
fundamental terminology about words, phrases, and clauses, 
we’re going to dive into the details of parts of speech and related 
usage rules.
■
■
The course is loosely organized around the major parts of speech 
like nouns, verbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and the like. As we 
talk about how each part of speech works, we’ll address the tricky 
usage issues that come up with that part of speech.

Questions to Consider
1.	 How would you define grammar?
2.	 What are three of your biggest pet peeves about usage? As a mental 
exercise, try making the case for the acceptance of one of your peeves 
(e.g., using less for fewer could be seen as a streamlining of the 
grammar, eradicating an optional distinction without causing confusion).

Prescriptivism: Grammar 
Shoulds and Shouldn’ts
T
his course has a certain viewpoint: If you speak English fluently, you 
know English grammar. What you may not have full control of is (1) all 
the terminology to describe what you know, and (2) the full set of rules that 
govern formal, standard English. Throughout the course, we’ll be covering 
relevant prescriptive rules as we talk about nouns, adverbs, prepositions, 
and the like. In this lecture, we’ll talk about the authority and history of this 
approach to grammar
What Grammar Means to Me
■
■
Some writing instructors use an assignment called “What 
Grammar Means to Me” to learn about the baggage students may 
be bringing with them. One instructor got this memorable and 
telling response:
	
When someone says the word “grammar” to me, my mind 
immediately flashes back to my sixth grade English teacher. 
She was teaching us about prepositions and our class was 
having trouble grasping it. The following day she brought 
in a Mickey Mouse figurine and a Barbie playhouse. She 
proceeded to place Mickey all around the house. “Mickey is 
BY the house, Mickey is IN the house.” She has since scarred 
me forever by telling us that if we ever placed a preposition 
at the end of a sentence, Mickey would die. Grammar has 
terrified me ever since.
■
■
For many people, connotations of grammar include red pens, fear, 
ignorance, drills, correction, and Mickey Mouse and his imminent 

12
demise. They may also think of rules like: Don’t end a sentence with 
a preposition, don’t dangle a modifier, and don’t split an infinitive. 
These can build a sense that “I don’t know English grammar.”
■
■
This lecture will focus generally on what we will call prescriptive 
grammar: the set of rules that tell us what we should and shouldn’t 
do in formal standard English. Prescriptive here means prescribing 
the do’s and don’ts of speaking and writing formal standard English.
Split Infinitives
■
■
The example of split infinitives will help here. The split infinitive 
rule is basically: Don’t put an adverb between to and a verb (i.e., 
to boldly go, to better understand). The idea is that the infinitive is 
a single unit and should not be split up.
■
■
This is one of the strongest prescriptive rules in popular 
understanding of grammar. However, Oxford lifted the ban in 
1998, with its New Oxford Dictionary of English. Many style guides 
have also relaxed—but many editors and teachers have not.
■
■
Where does this rule come from? One common idea that it comes 
from Latin, but there is no evidence for that. Some people cite 
Bishop Lowth’s 1762 work on grammar, but it doesn’t actually 
address it.
■
■
It wasn’t possible to split an infinitive until Middle English. There 
is evidence of split infinitives in the 14th century. For instance, the 
Wycliffite translation of the Bible includes: “It is good to not eat 
flesh and to not drink wine.” By the 17th century, some writers were 
trying to avoid it, but there was no explicit rule.
■
■
Do we split infinitives today? Yes, and some sound idiomatic: to 
better serve; to better understand. It may also be about a weak-
strong rhythm: to boldly go. Some uses are less ideal, such as 
when we get a lot of material between to and the verb: to quickly 
and effectively but not always consistently grade.
Lecture 2  ▪  Prescriptivism: Grammar Shoulds and Shouldn’ts

13
English Grammar Boot Camp
■
■
So here’s better advice: It is fine to split infinitives with an adverb; 
for clarity, one might want to avoid splitting an infinitive with a long 
adverbial phrase.
■
■
Any idea about “right” and “wrong” when it comes to grammar 
gets complicated when we learn about the history of prescriptive 
rules and compare rules to the way that real speakers and writers 
use the language in real time. Not splitting an infinitive may be the 
right call for a specific piece of writing, but that doesn’t make it 
universally “right” or how English is “supposed to” work.
The Value of Prescriptive Rules
■
■
It is inaccurate to suggest there is no value to prescriptive rules. 
Contrary to what some people believe, linguists aren’t saying 
prescriptive rules are bad and everyone should speak and write 
however they want all the time. However, some linguists can be 
overly strident in their attempt to challenge the perceived authority 
of prescriptive rules. 
■
■
Prescriptive rules can promote a standard, which has a real 
value; they can promote aesthetically pleasing kinds of prose, 
like parallelism; and they can promote clarity. Let’s just keep 
perspective on their value: Be open-minded about the rules’ 
benefits and weaknesses—and be open-minded about other ways 
to speak and write English, depending on audience and context.
The Scope of Prescriptive Rules
■
■
Prescriptive grammar covers a lot of ground, much more than 
just syntax. Take as an example Ellie Grossman’s book The 
Grammatically Correct Handbook, which touches on pronunciation, 
spelling as it relates to pronunciation, punctuation, lexical issues, 
regional differences, morphological issues, Latin plurals, past 
participles, syntactic issues, and stylistic issues. 
■
■
This course will cover that full range, and will usually refer to those 
as “usage” issues. Relevant questions are: How do we use the 
language? Is there guidance about how we are supposed to do 

14
something? To what extent does something affect spoken and 
written usage?
■
■
The rules governing these questions are found in a loose network. 
Many of us were asked to purchase an academic usage guide or 
dictionary for an English course; examples include: 
□
□
Strunk and White’s Elements of Style
□
□
Joseph Williams’s Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace
□
□
H. W. Fowler’s Dictionary of Modern English Usage 
□
□
Bryan Garner’s Dictionary of American Usage.  
■
■
Some guides hail from as far back as almost 250 years. The 
second half of 18th century saw a proliferation of these guides. 
The guides tend to focus on usage issues where there is variation  
in usage.
■
■
How do they justify which usage is incorrect? We’ll cover this more 
in future lectures, but there is a range of reasons: 
□
□
Etymology (a word should mean what it used to mean)
□
□
Logic (language should work like math, even though it is not 
math)
□
□
Analogy (English should work like Latin or German)
□
□
Purity (English should remain true to its roots, even though it 
has always been influenced by other languages)
□
□
Authority (great writers used the language this way)
□
□
Personal taste. 
Lecture 2  ▪  Prescriptivism: Grammar Shoulds and Shouldn’ts

15
English Grammar Boot Camp
■
■
One grammarian’s personal preference can get picked up as a 
rule in future guides. We’ll see this may be the case with the rule 
about ending a sentence with a preposition.
■
■
We can identify by name some of the earliest grammarians whose 
opinions about good usage still echo in today’s guides. Some 
examples of influential works:
□
□
Joseph Priestley’s Rudiments of English Grammar (1761). 
Priestley was the chemist who isolated oxygen—and a 
clergyman and political theorist, who also wrote a grammar. 
He tried to move away from Latin models, and was interested 
in actual usage but still concerned with correctness.
□
□
Robert Lowth’s A Short Introduction to English Grammar 
(1762). Lowth’s image is often framed as the “arch 
prescriptivist,” but has been rehabilitated by Ingrid Tieken-
Boon van Ostade.
□
□
American lawyer Lindley Murray’s English Grammar (1795). 
Murray was more prescriptive than his predecessors. This 
book went through 65 official editions in about 75 years. His 
grammar spread the idea that singular they was wrong, and 
one should use he instead.
□
□
Richard Grant White’s Words and Their Uses: Past and 
Present (1870). Many point to this as the pinnacle of 
prescriptivism. The author was a Shakespearean with very 
strong opinions about usage; for instance, he called the word 
donate “utterly abominable.” 
■
■
These examples give us a useful perspective on guidance about 
usage. Things that may sound terrible to our ears may become 
unremarkable within a generation or two.
■
■
This doesn’t mean that we don’t want to avoid usage that others 
strongly dislike or see as overly informal or low in some contexts. 

16
﻿
But we can have the perspective that the judgment is not inherent 
to the construction—it is something that has been put on it and 
may change.
Fowler and Roberts
■
■
Compared with White, we can view H. W. Fowler and his Dictionary 
of Modern Usage (1926) as a good-natured prescriptivist. The 
book is filled with opinions (e.g., alright is “not a word”). 
■
■
He says it is a mistake to assume none can only be singular, 
and he categorizes the prescription against split infinitives under 
“fetishes” and “superstitions,” mocking those who follow the 
prescription doggedly.
■
■
What would Fowler have thought of Supreme Court Chief Justice 
John Roberts changing the oath of office when he swore in 
President Obama in 2008? The original oath includes the words, 
“I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of 

17
English Grammar Boot Camp
the President of the United States” Notice that faithfully comes 
between will and execute. This is not a split infinitive, but a split 
verb—and people who feel strongly about one often feel strongly 
about the other.
■
■
Roberts’s version went: “I do solemnly swear that I will execute the 
office of the President of the United States faithfully.” That faithfully 
moved pretty far from where President Obama expected it to be. 
Both versions are clear and unambiguous—the concern about 
the verb is not a concern about clarity or even euphony (faithfully 
execute is very colloquial).
■
■
They redid the oath and all was fine. This incident shows the power 
of rules to shape our sense of what is good and appropriate. It’s a 
good reason to know and understand them—and to have enough 
information to make informed decisions about when we want to 
follow them and when we don’t.

Questions to Consider
1.	 When would you allow a split infinitive, and why?
2.	 What needs to happen for a usage rule to become inapplicable, 
irrelevant, or defunct? Who declares a usage rule “over”?

18
Descriptivism: How 
Grammar Really Works
Lecture
3
T
his lecture starts with a look at contractions in English, not in terms 
of whether or not we should use them in formal writing but in terms 
of where contractions can and cannot happen. Then we’ll move on to 
discuss historical underpinnings of certain rules, and how concepts like the 
rightness or wrongness of double negatives are somewhat fungible. We’ll 
close with a look at other descriptive rules. The overall theme of the lecture 
is: If you speak and write English competently, then you actually know 
quite a lot about grammar, even if you don’t think you do. Another theme: 
Nonstandard grammars aren’t necessarily wrong.
Contractions
■
■
We’ll start with a straightforward and very common contraction: did 
+ not, which can help make, “I didn’t swim.” Now let’s coordinate 
that sentence to see what can happen: 
□
□
He swam but I didn’t swim. 
□
□
He swam but I didn’t. (This omits the main verb “swim” and 
leaves didn’t stranded at end of sentence. This is not always 
possible.)
■
■
Let’s now look at another common contraction: I + am, as in, 
“I’m driving.”  Now let’s  coordinate (imagine we’re talking about 
carpools):
□
□
She’s driving and I’m driving.
Lecture 3  ▪  Descriptivism: How Grammar Really Works

19
English Grammar Boot Camp
□
□
She’s driving and I’m. (This doesn’t work: You can’t omit the 
main verb and leave I’m stranded at the end of the sentence.)
■
■
We couldn’t strand other pronouns contracted with auxiliary verbs 
to end a sentence or clause:
□
□
Who has been to South Africa? She has. (Again, we have 
omitted main verb and the rest of  the sentence.)
□
□
Who has been to South Africa? She’s. (This is a no-go.)
■
■
This is true in a comparative sentence too, where to be is the main 
verb and not an auxiliary or helping verb: “She’s taller than I’m” 
doesn’t work. 
■
■
No one ever taught you this; it is intuitive grammatical knowledge, 
learned when you were a child. You just have a sense that “She’s 
taller than I’m” is ungrammatical, in a more fundamental way than 
a split infinitive. This is fundamental to your linguistic competence 
as a speaker of English.
Descriptive Grammar
■
■
Descriptive grammar is made up of this complex set of rules 
that allow us to make grammatical utterances. Grammatical 
in the descriptive sense means rule-governed, systematically 
constructed language delivered in a way that can be parsed by 
others. A rule is an established pattern of usage that speakers 
recognize. Descriptive grammars must be huge to capture all 
this knowledge compared with style guides, which capture a  
small percentage.
■
■
The most remarkable feature of grammar of human languages is 
that we can create an infinite number of utterances from a finite 
set of resources. Think about what you’re doing right now: You’re 
reading sentences you’ve never read before.

20
■
■
Conventions are fundamental: Think of linguistic signs and 
grammatical rules and patterns. Those rules allow us to combine 
the signs in new ways.
Multiple Negations
■
■
Ungrammatical sentences don’t follow the patterns of a variety of 
English. Here’s an example with word order. We know this is fine: 
A dog chased me down the street.
■
■
We know these are not fine:
□
□
Dog a chased me down street the.  (Determiners must come 
before nouns.)
□
□
A dog chased me the street down. (The preposition needs to 
come before the noun phrase.)
□
□
Dog me street down chased a the. (This is just a general mess.)
■
■
What about, “We don’t have nothing to hide.” Is this grammatical 
in the descriptive sense? To answer that, let’s think historically. 
Double negation is now considered nonstandard, but there is a 
long history of multiple negation 
in English.
■
■
Chaucer described a knight in 
the General Prologue of The 
Canterbury Tales: “He nevere 
yet no vileynye ne sayde.” 
(Translation: He never no evil 
thing not said à He never ever 
said anything vile.) Note that 
there are three negatives.
In Shakespeare’s As You Like It, the character 
Celia asserts: “I cannot go no further.”
Lecture 3  ▪  Descriptivism: How Grammar Really Works

21
English Grammar Boot Camp
■
■
The system for marking negation in English was different: Some 
writing used ne rather than not, and it was inserted before the verb 
(ne sayde). Now we use not and it is inserted after the auxiliary 
(cannot, has not, did not say). Varieties of English that continue to 
use double negation carry on a long tradition.
■
■
It’s a myth that two negatives cancel each other out. Take, for 
example, the meaning of  “not unhappy.” We must also note 
that intonation matters: “We don’t have none.” All in all, we must 
consider double negation grammatical for many varieties of 
English. It is not formal or standard, but completely systematic and 
well understood by speakers of all varieties.
Multiple Grammars
■
■
This is a good moment to make a key point about how “English 
grammar” works: There isn’t just one. All varieties of English 
spoken in speech communities have systematic grammars.
■
■
We need to talk about English grammars, as there are many 
varieties of English—Standard American English is just one of 
them. Standard American English will be the focus of much of this 
course, but we will often point out differences in other varieties 
and talk about how the standard variety has changed over time.
■
■
Now let’s return to negation, focusing on the kind with just one 
negative. If we step back from a negative sentence to examine 
what is at work, it can give you a taste of how much you know. 
Let’s take the sentence, “It did not rain.”
□
□
The not goes after the auxiliary verb.
□
□
Contraction is possible (“didn’t rain”).
□
□
The  auxiliary verb(s) come before the main verb. 
■
■
What if there is more than one auxiliary? Take as an example, “The 
cake has been eaten.” You know that you the negative version 

22
would go as, “The cake has not been eaten,” rather than, “The cake 
has been not eaten.” A contraction is also possible, with hasn’t. 
■
■
That’s a lot of knowledge about how to make a negative sentence 
that you may never have had spelled out that way before. You just 
learned it as a kid. 
Other Descriptive Rules
■
■
Here are some other examples of descriptive rules:
□
□
Determiners come before nouns: “All her many friends” 
instead of, “Her all many friends.”
□
□
An adjective will come between the determiner and the noun: 
“a silly song.”
□
□
To make most nouns plural, add -s: “silly songs.”
□
□
Prepositions precede the noun phrase: “in my head.”
■
■
These may seem very basic and not worth spending time on, but 
it’s powerful to remember how much we know when we know 
English grammar. The usage rules that we worry about are just a 
fraction of the universe of English grammar. 
■
■
Being able to compare how the language works descriptively with 
the rules we’re told to follow in formal speech and writing can help 
you make even more informed decisions about usage. You’ll gain 
a new perspective on some of the rules you may have learned in 
school or elsewhere.
■
■
As an example, let’s return to double negation. We’ve determined 
that historically it has been rule-governed and continues to be 
rule-governed and grammatical in many varieties of English.
■
■
But in 18th century, Bishop Lowth, in his very popular grammar, 
introduced the idea that negatives could cancel each other. This 
Lecture 3  ▪  Descriptivism: How Grammar Really Works

23
English Grammar Boot Camp
got extended to sentences like, “We don’t have nothing to hide.” 
They were declared illogical.
■
■
Double negatives are now avoided in Standard American English, 
and in fact are often condemned as wrong or bad English. But 
there is nothing inherently wrong or uneducated about the 
construction—in fact, it used to be used in high writing. 
■
■
In fact, some people thought that the move to single negation 
wasn’t necessarily a good thing. Here’s a quote from the London 
Review (October 1, 1864) found in Fitzedward Hall’s Modern 
English (1873): “The double negative has been abandoned, to the 
great injury of strength of expression.”
■
■
To be clear, this isn’t to advocate that we all suddenly start using 
double negation in formal prose, or stop teaching students about 
the issue. We should teach students the standard use, but we 
shouldn’t condemn the other, as this isn’t well founded. This is 
what it means to be careful about our grammar: to be sure what 
we’re saying is accurate and fair about how both prescriptive and 
descriptive grammar work.
■
■
It is helpful for us to understand social judgment and be able to 
navigate it as speakers and writers; it is also intellectually interesting 
to see how those judgments can change over time. This perspective 
and background knowledge actually makes us better editors and 
teachers because we understand the formal written variety in 
the context of all the varieties of English out there. It it is a more 
engaging and empowering way to think about and teach grammar.
■
■
It gives us credit for all that we already know and acknowledges 
all the variation that we know is out there—and that we know can 
function really well in context. Part of mastering the game of the 
formal standards is to understand how these usage rules may ask 
us to switch up our language from informal to formal contexts, and 
from speech to writing.

24
■
■
All of this can make grammar playful again, as opposed to a world 
of absolute rights and wrongs.

T
his lecture is the last of our background lectures before we dive into the 
usage rules related to different parts of speech. We’ll address questions 
like: How many parts of speech are there? How do we define them? What 
is the difference between a phrase and a clause? The standard parts of 
speech fall in this hierarchy: Words make phrases, which make clauses, 
which make sentences. This kind of terminology is critical for the remaining 
20 lectures. Much of this will be review for many readers, but it will provide 
some new ways of thinking about how we define and categorize words into 
parts of speech, or lexical categories.
Distinctions and Morphs
■
■
Let’s start by clarifying a key distinction that builds on the material 
from the previous two lectures: what lexical category a word 
belongs to versus what lexical category we think a word should 
belong to.
□
□
A good case study is the word impact, which is accepted as 
a noun and a verb. Some people, including many who write 
usage guides, think it should not be a verb that means “to 
have an impact on.” 
□
□
In 2001, 80 percent of the AHD Usage Panel rejected the 
sentence, “The court ruling will impact the education of 
minority students” as somewhat or completely unacceptable. 
□
□
Bryan Garner, in his influential Garner’s Modern American 
Usage, admits that this use of impact as a verb has become

Lecture

26
widespread, but he also concludes that it should be avoided 
because we already have affect and influence. 
■
■
The word impact captures a phenomenon in Modern English that 
is very relevant to a discussion of lexical categories: Words can 
change categories—or more often, expand into new categories. 
Some examples:
□
□
Nouns get verbed (to google) 
□
□
Verbs get nouned (a hire) 
□
□
Adjectives get verbed (to clean).
■
■
Sometimes, people aren’t happy about this when it happens. Ben 
Franklin wrote to Noah Webster in 1789 about several new verbs, 
newly created from nouns, that he didn’t like: advocate, notice, 
and progress. 
■
■
In Modern English, we have very few inflectional endings; for 
example, regular verbs just take –ed to become past tense. 
Therefore, it’s not too hard to take a noun and make it a verb 
(googled). Nouns just take –s to become plural and possessive. 
Additionally, we don’t have grammatical gender. So you can take a 
verb like invite and make it a noun—and you don’t have to give it a 
gender. If you have more than one, you have invites.
Lexical Categories
■
■
This is a good moment to step back for a quick review of what 
lexical categories (also known as parts of speech) are available in 
English. While there is some basic agreement on this, not everyone 
agrees on the terminology or how many categories there are.
■
■
Lexical categories can be divided into two big categories:
□
□
Open class: nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. This class 
can take new members.
Lecture 4  ▪  Re Phrasing

27
English Grammar Boot Camp
□
□
Closed class: pronouns, determiners, auxiliary verbs, 
conjunctions (or coordinators and subordinators), and 
prepositions. This class rarely adds new members
■
■
Some words defy these lexical categories. Examples are discourse 
markers, interjections, and the word not. Some people call not an 
adverb; some let it be its own category.
■
■
In this lecture, we’ll talk about how we define what makes a noun or 
a preposition or an auxiliary verb (and then we’ll talk about phrases 
and clauses).
■
■
In the 1970s educational show Schoolhouse Rock, one song 
advises that, “A noun is a person, place, or thing.” But does this 
hold up? The answer is no, not entirely. Relying on what a word 
means (or purely “semantic” criteria) to define parts of speech is 
often difficult and inadequate. For instance, nouns can also be also 
abstract concepts (love, confusion), states of being (limbo), and 
actions (running).
■
■
Linguists come at defining parts of speech from at least two other 
angles: how a word behaves in terms of the inflectional endings it 
takes and in terms of how it works in phrase or sentence.
□
□
Morphology covers what kinds of inflectional endings a word 
takes. Nouns tend to make plural with –s. Verbs tend to make 
past tense with –ed and present participles with –ing (walk/
walked/walking). Adjectives can make comparatives with –er 
or more (happy/happier, beautiful/more beautiful), and so on.
□
□
There are some derivational endings that tend to signal 
what lexical category a word is in: If you see a word ending 
in –ize, odds are it is a verb (colonize, problematize); if you 
see a word ending in –ion or –ment, odds are it is a noun 
(realization, retirement).

28
■
■
Syntax covers what slot in a phrase or clause a word can fill. This 
is intuitive:
□
□
Nouns: the _____ (cat, love, running)
□
□
Verbs: will _____ (swim, walk, go)
□
□
Adjectives: the _____ thing  (happy, ridiculous)
□
□
Auxiliary verbs: She ____ go  (will, may, might)
□
□
Prepositions: ____ the tree (in, up, down, around, on, to)
■
■
We have not yet mentioned adverbs. They are tricky. There is one 
morphological signal: –ly (slowly, extremely, frankly). However, 
that can also signal an adjective (lovely, homely). Syntactically, 
adverbs appear all over the sentence and they modify all kinds of 
things (verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs).
Phrases, Clauses, and Sentences
■
■
What’s the difference between a phrase and a clause? Simply put: 
a clause is composed of a subject and a predicate. A predicate 
is the verb and all its accouterments. Here are two clauses, with 
brackets separating the subject and predicate: 
□
□
[My sister] [took all four kids to the aquarium].
□
□
[I] [am tired].
■
■
A phrase is a group of words that works together within a clause. 
To clarify, it can help to think intuitively about the “chunks” within a 
clause (or what linguists would call constituents). An example: My 
sister took all four kids to the aquarium.
□
□
All is more related to four kids than to took.
Lecture 4  ▪  Re Phrasing

29
English Grammar Boot Camp
□
□
Sentences work in chunks that are nested within each other, 
not like train cars that are just all hooked up sequentially.
■
■
Let’s unpack this straightforward sentence in terms of phrases:
□
□
The whole sentence is one clause, with a subject (“My sister”) 
and a predicate (“took all four kids to the aquarium”).
□
□
“My sister” is a noun phrase (the two words together function 
like a noun).
□
□
“All four kids” is also a noun phrase; here it is the direct object.
□
□
“The aquarium” is also a noun phrase, and it is nested 
inside another kind of phrase: a prepositional phrase (“to 
the aquarium”). Prepositional phrases are interesting 
In the sentence, “My niece 
loved the fish at the aquarium,” 
the prepositional phrase “at the 
aquarium” functions adjectivally 
to modify “fish.”

30
because they function like adverbs and adjectives. Here the 
prepositional is functioning adverbially: It describes where my 
sister took the four kids.
■
■
What is the difference between a clause and a sentence?
□
□
They can be the same thing when a sentence has only one clause.
□
□
However, a sentence can have more than one clause: “My 
sister took all four kids to the aquarium, but it was inexplicably 
closed.” These are compound or complex sentences.
Sentences and Contractions
■
■
Let’s end this lecture with the question of what a sentence is. It 
seems so easy, but actually there isn’t a clear answer.
□
□
One definition: A sentence is a written string of words that is 
“complete in and of itself” that ends with a period. 
□
□
Typically a sentence has one or more clauses, but we can 
also get fragments: “Not true.”
□
□
In speech, how do we know where a sentence ends? 
Intonation is a clue, but an imperfect one. In real-time speech, 
we often do not speak in full sentences and we can have  
long run-ons.
□
□
We need to accept that sentences are written products. It’s 
not that they don’t have counterparts in the spoken word, but 
the period is a written imposition.
□
□
This highlights the difference between speech and writing, 
which will be a theme throughout this course. Often we are 
asked to follow conventions in written language that put 
it at odds with the way we speak. This is not a bad thing, 
necessarily, but it is worth noting.
Lecture 4  ▪  Re Phrasing

31
English Grammar Boot Camp
■
■
One study in the Longman Grammar shows that in speech we 
contract “do not” almost 100 percent of the time, and we contract 
modals like “will not” 95 percent of the time. Yet we are told that in 
formal writing we shouldn’t do that, except perhaps for emphasis. 
■
■
That convention is changing a bit, as contractions sneak their way 
into more formal prose. 
■
■
Bryan Garner counters the concern that contractions make writing 
seem too breezy and argues that with contractions, we can gain 
“relaxed sincerity.” But, he warns, don’t contract recklessly and 
avoid contractions in solemn contexts.
■
■
These are rhetorical choices: What we are trying to achieve as 
writers, in terms of tone and formality, matters. Again, this is 
a more interesting way to look at a usage rule than whether we 
should or shouldn’t use contractions, as if there was something 
inherently wrong with them.
Questions to Consider
1.	 What is a sentence? How do we know where sentences end in spoken 
language?
2.	 If the nouns notice and progress historically got to become verbs, why 
shouldn’t the noun impact also get to become a verb?
3.	 What part of speech or lexical category is not? What about yes?

32
T
he issue of countable versus uncountable nouns is a tricky one. Many 
speakers and writers don’t observe the distinction, and sometimes it 
sounds wrong to do what is technically right. This is one of several usage 
issues around nouns that we’re going to look at in this lecture. We’ll also 
cover irregular plurals (like the plurals of octopus and emoji); collective 
nouns like jury; and other agreement issues, such as “There are a few 
reasons” versus “There’s a few reasons.”
Less/Fewer and Countability
■
■
A prototypical countable noun is pencil, and a prototypical 
uncountable noun is water. You can count uncountable nouns 
with measure words, such as drops, cups, or buckets of water. 
These measure words can refer to a part (a grain of sand) or a 
container (a bottle of beer) or a quantity (a lot of grass). With many 
uncountable nouns, we can also make them countable with a shift 
in meaning: “A lot of beer” can become “12 beers.”
■
■
Opinions differ on when to use less versus fewer. Some use 
the rule of thumb that less can be used with both countable and 
uncountable nouns. This doesn’t cause any issues in expressions 
that are unremarkable, such as, “500 words or less.” However, it 
can be jarring in uses like, “90 percent less germs.”
■
■
Strunk’s Elements of Style (1918) sets out the rule: “Less. Should 
not be misused for fewer.” Less means quantity; fewer means 
number.
Fewer Octopuses 
or Less Octopi?
Lecture

Lecture 5  ▪  Fewer Octopuses or Less Octopi?

33
English Grammar Boot Camp
■
■
But it’s not that clear-cut in usage. As AHD recognizes, if you look 
at what feels idiomatic in American English and other varieties, 
you see less used with things we can count: 
□
□
Measures of time: “less than three days”
□
□
Measures of amount: “less than $200”
□
□
Measures of distance: “less than 100 miles”
□
□
Approximations: “100 bottles, more or less”
■
■
As writers, should we just go with what sounds right? The answer 
is split. With measures, time, and distance, yes—go with what 
sounds right. But proceed with caution in other instances.
■
■
In 2006, only 28 percent of the AHD Usage Panel accepted the 
sentence, “The region needs more jobs, not less jobs.” This 
sentence is not ambiguous or confusing, but there is still some 
gatekeeping with this construction.
Singular/Plural Issues
■
■
Irregular plurals are a mixture of native English ones and borrowed 
ones. It can seem like a chaotic mess, but there are actually 
patterns that are worth sorting out. The three main categories of 
The lexicographer Bryan Garner 
praises supermarkets that use 
fewer instead of less in their 
express-line signs.

34
irregular plurals spawned from English are the –en plurals, the 
zero plurals, and the vowel changes.
□
□
–en plurals have been dying out for some time, and are limited 
today to words like children, oxen, and brethren
□
□
Another regular way of making plurals was a zero ending, and 
we still see that with sheep and deer. Interestingly, this class 
has expanded over time, encompassing fish (which used to 
be fishes). Emoji could be a new member of this category, 
and that is the plural version in Japanese.
□
□
The vowel change plurals reflect a very old stage of 
Germanic, when there was a plural ending that caused the 
vowel to change. That ending has long since fallen by the 
wayside, but its effects remain in goose/geese, man/men, and  
mouse/mice.
■
■
Now let’s look at irregularities that have come through borrowing 
from other languages.
□
□
One very common set of irregular plurals stems from Latin 
borrowings that end in –us, such as syllabus, focus, and 
status. Not all of these Latin –us words come from the same 
declension in Latin, so they have different plural formations in 
Latin, which further confuses the issue in English. And then 
there are a few –us borrowings, like hippopotamus, which 
aren’t from Latin at all. 
□
□
Most borrowings from Latin that end in –us take an –i plural 
in Latin: focus/foci, stimulus/stimuli, and alumnus/alumni. For 
all of these words, the –i plural is still the most common in 
English, but some of them are starting to get Englishified. 
Additionally, something like foci may sound too formal or 
even forced, even though right now it is more common in  
formal writing.
Lecture 5  ▪  Fewer Octopuses or Less Octopi?

35
English Grammar Boot Camp
□
□
Some have already become Englishified: crocuses not croci.
□
□
Syllabus is a complicated case when it comes to words that 
take –i to become plural. It is borrowed from modern Latin, 
and it seems to stem from a scribal error that misread the 
Greek (it was a different word). So the Latinate plural syllabi is 
not etymologically founded, but it has taken hold. Right now, 
we can safely use either syllabi or syllabuses.
□
□
Then there are –us borrowings from Latin that keep the –us 
in Latin. The plural of apparatus is apparatus and of status is 
status if we stay true to the Latin, but we haven’t. Speakers for 
the most part use apparatuses and statuses.
□
□
There is a third, pretty small set of –us words that take what 
looks to us like an irregular plural. Examples are corpus/
corpora and genus/genera. The Oxford English Dictionary 
already includes genuses, but not yet corpuses (though it can 
be found in usage).
■
■
There are two common words people often mistake for Latin 
borrowings. Hippopotamus is Greek, not Latin. It means “river horse.” 
Many dictionaries recommend the –es ending (hippopotamuses), 
but recognize that some folks use –i (hippopotami). Saying or 
writing hippos is a way around this choice.
■
■
What about octopus? This word is Greek. Octopus showed up in 
English in the mid-18th century; before that it was a polypus. In the 
late 19th century, the plural was usually octopi, but by the 1930s 
and 40s, octopuses became the major form.
■
■
The takeaway here about irregular plurals is that they are 
idiosyncratic. Some are moving toward regular English plurals and 
some are not. There is not better advice than to look in standard 
dictionaries and usage guides when in doubt—and realize that 
there will be some differences of opinion. Also, Latin plurals may 
be read as more correct or pretentious.

36
■
■
Before leaving borrowed words, let’s address one big usage issue: 
data. Technically, data is plural, as it is plural in Latin; the singular 
is datum. But in English it has been reinterpreted as a singular 
mass noun. This leads to, “the data shows,” as opposed to, “the 
data show.” Both are now in common usage, with a preference for 
the plural in academic writing and a preference for the singular in 
the spoken. Regardless of which you choose, just be consistent.
Questions of Agreement
■
■
Agreement can be a sticky issue. First, let’s cover collective 
nouns, like jury, group, family, and couple. There are two ways to 
think about this: meaning and geography.
□
□
When it comes to meaning, ask: Are you thinking about the 
group as a unit or as separate individuals? Examples are “Her 
family is highly educated” versus “His family is all doctors.” 
□
□
Regarding geography: If you’re from the US, you’re likely 
to use the singular (“The jury is deadlocked”). If you’re from 
U.K., you’re likely to use the plural (“Arsenal are losing”).
■
■
Things can get muddy when the collective is followed by a 
prepositional phrase such as, “A jury of my peers is/are debating” 
or “A group of my friends is/are going.” American grammar guides 
often allow some variation here based on meaning, depending on 
whether something like “a group” refers more to the individuals 
than to a unit. 
■
■
What if the noun comes after the verb? It happens in there is/are 
constructions (e.g., “There is a spider on your head.”)
■
■
At issue is the grammatical subject (the existential there) versus 
the notional subject (a spider). The prescriptive rule is that the 
notional subject governs agreement, so there’s no problem in, 
“There is a spider on your head.” 
Lecture 5  ▪  Fewer Octopuses or Less Octopi?

37
English Grammar Boot Camp
■
■
Let’s add two spiders. Could you say, “There’s three spiders 
on your head”? We often contract to there’s. This has become 
formulaic enough that the number of the following noun doesn’t 
matter: “There’s a reason for that” works, as does “There’s three 
reasons for that.” 
■
■
In formal writing, we’re less likely to contract and more likely 
to let the following noun govern the agreement. This course’s 
recommendation is to be careful and let the notional subject 
govern in formal writing. But it is fair to note that it is quite idiomatic 
to use “there’s” with plural nouns in speech and informal writing.

Questions to Consider

percent less calories?”
2.	 At what point, if ever, should the word data be accepted as a singular

are using data as a singular noun, are they all wrong?

Lecture 6  ▪  Between You and Your Pronouns
T
his lectures addresses several prominent usage issues related to 
pronouns. It’s not accurate to say a pronoun is just a word that stands 
in for a noun, because pronouns can stand in for entire noun phrases. 
Pronouns are some of the most common words in our language. This 
lecture starts with a definition of our terms, then moves on to describe 
several categories of pronouns. Throughout, the lecture provides examples 
of how to use pronouns properly—and where there’s wiggle room.
Personal Pronouns
■
■
There are several categories of pronouns. We’ll start with the 
personal pronouns, several of which are among the most common 
words. Examples include I, you, it, he, and they. 
■
■
With personal pronouns, we often hear reference to the first, 
second, and third person. This is about where people (or things) 
are relative to the discourse or text. Pronouns can stand in for the 
people in the discourse (with first or second person) or people or 
things being discussed (with third person).
Between You and I
■
■
The first usage issue with personal pronouns we need to discuss 
is “between you and I” (a pet peeve for many). We need this 
background to understand what is happening with “between you 
and I,” so we need to discuss the case system from Old English.
■
■
Case is a grammatical system that distinguishes the function of a 
noun or pronoun in a clause. If we look at the personal pronouns, 
Between You and 
Your Pronouns
Lecture

we see that most of them distinguish three cases: subject, object 
(direct and indirect), and possessive.
□
□
First person: I/me/mine, we/us/ours
□
□
Second person: you/you/yours
□
□
Third person: he/him/his, she/her/hers, they/them/theirs, it/it/its
■
■
In Old English, all nouns made these kinds of distinctions: 
subject, object, and possessive. Today, everything but possessive 
distinctions has dropped away. But pronouns still prop up the full 
historical case system.
■
■
Given that we don’t have to make this distinction anywhere else in 
the grammar, we can interchange pronouns when the syntax gets 
complicated—and it gets complicated in conjoined constructions.
□
□
In American English and British English, if the personal 
pronoun occurs by itself, you tend to consistently get I in 
subject position and me in object position: “I went to the store” 
or “My mother called me.”
□
□
But if you create an “X-and-Y” situation with I/me, you will 
hear: “Me and my mom went to the store,” and “My mother 
called my sister and I.” Compare these to the standard 
constructions: “My mom and I went to the store,” and “My 
mother called my sister and me.”
■
■
Conjoined constructions may not follow the same rules as single 
nouns. For example, while you would get accusative “me” alone, 
the conjoined “my sister and I” may not have to take the object 
case after a preposition, as in “between my sister and I”. In other 
words, “X and I” and “me and Y” could be routinized (though not 
standardized) expressions.

Lecture 6  ▪  Between You and Your Pronouns ﻿﻿
■
■
Interestingly, polite usage for many speakers, including highly 
educated ones, is “between you and I.” In the long run, the 
distinction may well collapse. Who knows which pronoun will win?
Distinction Problems
■
■
A collapse of singular/plural distinction in the can happen in the 
second person as well. We used to have thou/thee. This became 
the familiar form, but is now mostly dead (other than Quakers and 
old plays and novels). There are many newer plural forms: y’all, 
you guys, yous, yous guys, yinz. 
■
■
In standard English, you can be both singular and plural. This 
fact is relevant to what is known as the generic pronoun problem, 
which happens when we need to refer back to a noun phrase (the 
antecedent) that refers to a person whose gender is unspecified, 
unknown, or irrelevant. For instance: “A person at that level should 
not have to keep track of the hours  ____ put in.” (This was the 
sentence on the AHD usage ballot for a generic person.)
■
■
There is also the situation where we don’t know a person’s 
gender: “We would like to think the anonymous reviewer for _____ 
comments.”
■
■
There is an idea out there that we don’t have a singular generic 
pronoun for these situations, and since the late 18th century, 
people have been coming up with artificial ones. Some examples: 
heshe, thon, e, hiser, ze. But we do have a singular generic 
pronoun: they.
■
■
The question is whether we’re going to allow writers to use singular 
generic they in formal writing. We already use it in informal, less 
monitored writing.
■
■
The push against they originated in the 18th century, first recorded 
in Anne Fisher’s grammar and then picked up in Lindley Murray’s 
wildly popular grammar at the end of 18th century.

41

■
■
In the 1970s, second-wave feminism pushed against the use of he 
as the dominant pronoun. Four options arose: 
□
□
He or she
□
□
Alternate he and she 
□
□
Make it plural 
□
□
Omit the pronoun.
■
■
These are fine solutions, but why can’t we also use they? It works 
well in the spoken language, and is no more ambiguous than other 
spoken pronouns. Luckily, if you are a writer who would like to use 
singular they, we are entering an era where this is close to becoming 
standard usage. We’re not quite there, but we’re getting close.
■
■
There have been some artificial pronouns suggested along the 
way. Ze now has some traction as a transgender pronoun, along 
with they. These are also for those who identify outside the male/
female binary.
■
■
There is debate on college campuses about these pronouns. 
Overall, the pronouns are about respecting what people ask to be 
called and thereby creating a more inclusive, respectful space.
Interrogative Pronouns
■
■
The collapse of case is relevant to another class of pronouns: 
interrogative. These are pronouns that create questions. You often 
see a list of five: what, which, who, whom, and whose. But you 
could argue there are three: what, which, and who, the last of 
which then has two additional mutations (whom and whose) for 
the object and possessive form.
■
■
Who/whom is the biggest usage issue. Who is the subject form of 
the pronoun; whom is the object form, and it is in decline. But it 
has been in decline for several hundred years, so one interesting 

42
﻿
Whom might sound appropriate 
in an academic context but stuffy 
in a social context.

43
English Grammar Boot Camp
question is why it hasn’t died yet. It is healthiest when it comes 
after a preposition (examples: “to whom,” “by whom”). Alone, it 
can look like a subject form because it appears first: “Who(m) are  
you calling?”
■
■
Whom can sound fussy in many contexts. If you wish to avoid it 
in e-mails or texts, you can either rework the sentence or just use 
who: “Who did you call about getting the washing machine fixed?” 
Know your audience.
Indefinite Pronouns
■
■
Indefinite pronouns pose other agreement issues, especially the 
pronoun none. An example: Should it be, “None of the books is 
_____” or “None of the books are _____?” 
■
■
Indefinite pronouns do not refer to a specific person or thing. They 
stand in for a vague or undetermined person or thing, or amount of 
things. Typical examples: anyone/anybody, everyone/everybody, 
and someone/somebody.
■
■
Most are straightforward in terms of agreement with verbs: anyone 
is singular (“anyone is”) and few is plural (“few are”). None is 
trickier, perhaps especially in a phrase where it is referring to none 
of a plural group of things: “None of my friends is/are.”
■
■
So, can none be both singular and plural? In short, yes. Over the 
years, sources, have varied, but now  certain reputable usage 
guides recognize the singular or plural can be standard. Bryan 
Garner distinguishes between meaning of “not one” (singular) 
versus “not any” (plural). 
This What?
■
■
We haven’t covered another category of very common pronouns, 
namely this, that, these, and those. These are demonstrative 
pronouns, which point at things inside and outside the text  
or discourse.

44
Lecture 6  ▪  Between You and Your Pronouns
■
■
Did you learn that you should never leave the word this by itself at 
the beginning of a sentence in formal writing? Such instruction can 
lead students to add nouns: “This idea means _____.” This setup 
can in turn become clunky if it’s hard to find a noun that captures 
exactly what this is referring back to.
■
■
The good news: You can relax that stricture (if you learned it). 
Sometimes it is OK to leave your this without a noun. The key is 
that it needs to be clear what you’re referring back to. And it is OK 
if, as Bryan Garner puts it, sometimes the this summarizes what 
you just wrote.
■
■
Here’s an example from Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers, where he’s 
making a connection between agriculture and growing seasons, 
and educational reform:
	
Unless a wheat- or cornfield is left fallow every few years, the 
soil becomes exhausted. Every winter, fields are empty. The 
hard labor of spring planting and fall harvesting is followed, 
like clockwork, by the slower pace of summer and winter. 
This is the logic the reformers applied to the cultivation of  
young minds.
■
■
Garner’s advice is worth following here: Make sure you can 
answer, “This what?”

Questions to Consider
1.	 The second-person pronoun you has already lost the distinction 
between subject and object so that we now use you for both. If—and 
this is a big if—English were to lose the subject-object distinction in the 
first-person singular pronoun, do you think I or me would win? Why?
2.	 Studies show that many speakers use they as a singular generic 
pronoun in a sentence like “Someone left their towel on the deck chair.” 
What are reasons for and against allowing singular generic they in 
formal writing?

Lecture 7  ▪  Which Hunting
T
he Microsoft Word grammar checker has strong feelings about the 
difference between that and which as relative pronouns—and it 
expresses those feelings in green squiggly lines under our words. Informal 
polling suggests that a good number of writers aren’t sure what the problem 
is but change the that into a which or the which into a that until the grammar 
checker has been appeased. This lecture’s aim is to give a better sense of 
what is going on with those words.
Relative Clauses
■
■
Let’s look at an example that the grammar checker in Microsoft 
Word 2010 would flag: “I have a great dress which you can 
borrow.” The checker wants that here because it is a restrictive 
relative clause. The checker would allow which in a sentence with 
a nonrestrictive relative clause, such as: “I bought a great dress, 
which happened to be on sale.”
■
■
A relative clause modifies a noun or noun phrase: “the dress that 
I just bought” or “the man who wouldn’t stop talking to me on the 
airplane.” The relative clause is introduced by a relative pronoun 
that stands in for the noun being modified. Relative pronouns 
include that, which, who, whom, whoever, whomever, and whose.
■
■
Two more examples:
□
□
“I had lunch with a friend who just returned from China.” Who 
stands in for friend.
Which Hunting
Lecture
7

47
English Grammar Boot Camp
□
□
“Alex recently ran into our old roommate, who now lives in 
Hong Kong.” Who subs in for our old roommate.
■
■
These examples captured the restrictive/nonrestrictive distinction. 
In restrictive clauses, the clause narrows the set to specify who/
what you’re referring to. In nonrestrictive clauses, the clause adds 
information about the noun but does not restrict the set.
□
□
“… who just returned from China” restricts from a large set of 
friends to one friend.
□
□
“… our old roommate, who now lives in Hong Kong” simply 
adds information about the roommate’s whereabouts. We 
already understood who the old roommate was. Also note that 
the clause occurred after a comma.
■
■
Clearly, who can be both restrictive and nonrestrictive. The 
distinction becomes relevant with that and which. There’s a 
rule that says we should use that for restrictives and which for 
nonrestrictives, as well as a comma for the latter, which captures 
the pause typical of speech.
That/Which
■
■
Let’s look at two examples with that/which: 
□
□
“I have the keys to the car that is in the driveway.” (There are 
multiple cars and I’m specifying which one I have keys for—as 
opposed to one in the garage and one in the street.)
□
□
“I have the keys to the car, which is in the driveway.” (There is 
only one car, and I’m just letting you know where it’s parked)
■
■
This rule is an attempt to create complementary distribution where 
it may never have existed. For most speakers, that applies only 
to restrictive clauses. They tend not to use it after a comma for 
nonrestrictives. But a good number of us can use which for both: “I 
have the keys to the car which is in the driveway.”

48
Lecture 7  ▪  Which Hunting
■
■
If we use which only for nonrestrictives, then there is no overlap. 
The prescription goes back to H.W. Fowler’s The King’s  
English (1908):
	
This confusion is to be regretted; for although no distinction 
can be authoritatively drawn between the two relatives, an 
obvious one presents itself. 
■
■
He goes on to say that that should be the defining/restrictive 
relative and who/which the nondefining/nonrestrictive. He then 
adds: “‘Who’ or ‘which’ should not be used in defining clauses 
except when custom, euphony, or convenience is decidedly 
against the use of ‘that.’”
■
■
In other words, Fowler is presenting an idealized distinction 
between that and which—and allowing exceptions only for 
euphony or convenience. Fowler is also recommending that as the 
restrictive pronoun with animate and inanimate nouns, and then 
who and which for nonrestrictive uses.
■
■
Most guides now allow who to be restrictive and nonrestrictive. 
(Fowler wasn’t letting who be restrictive—just that.)
The Debate Continues
■
■
Fowler returned to that/which in his influential A Dictionary of 
Modern English Usage (2nd edition). He clarifies his preference 
for complementary distribution and yet shows his awareness that 
actual usage and his preferred order do not necessarily align. He 
starts by acknowledging that grammarians have less influence 
on usage than they may realize, but that it’s hard to resist having 
preferences about what would be best usage. 
■
■
He then notes:
	
The relations between that, who, and which have come to us 
from our forefathers as an odd jumble, and plainly show that 
the language has not been neatly constructed by a master 

49
English Grammar Boot Camp
builder who could create each part to do the exact work 
required of it, neither overlapped nor overlapping. 
■
■
So he accepts the jumble, but he goes on to say it doesn’t mean 
we couldn’t, at least theoretically, do better. The jumble that 
Fowler describes gets lost in Strunk and White’s version of “the 
rule” in Elements of Style. They make a clear distinction: That is 
restrictive; which is nonrestrictive. 
■
■
But they then note there are exceptions, such as this sentence 
from the Bible: “Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this 
thing which is come to pass.” However, the exception for euphony 
or convenience doesn’t seem to be an option for most of us. In the 
end, they tell us to go which-hunting to improve our work.
■
■
The Associated Press Stylebook makes no exceptions to the 
restrictive/nonrestrictive rule. Bryan Garner’s A Dictionary of 
English Usage (1998) has strong words on the subject, seeming to 
say that if you follow this rule, you are detailed-oriented as a writer 
and care about niceties. 
■
■
AHD usage guidelines take a more tempered tone: Which with 
restrictive relative clauses is common and may be preferable if 
there is a that in the antecedent noun phrase: “We want to assign 
only that material which will be most helpful.”
Zero Relatives 
■
■
Let’s now talk about a couple of other features of relative clauses: 
clauses introduced by a zero relative, and pied-piping, which 
involves moving the preposition that is connected to the relative 
pronoun up to the front of the relative clause. Both zero relatives 
and pied-piping involve relative clauses with a relative pronoun in 
an object position. 
■
■
In zero relative clauses, the relative pronoun doesn’t appear 
at all. An example: “I can’t remember the name of the person 
whom I met last night” versus “I can’t remember the name of the 

50
Lecture 7  ▪  Which Hunting
person I met last night.” The latter contains a zero relative clause,  
missing whom. 
■
■
This can only happen when the relative pronoun functions as the 
object in the relative clause. For example, take, “the book that I 
just finished,” where the relative clause is “that I just finished.” 
□
□
If we put the relative pronoun where it would be as the object 
in the clause, we would get: “I just finished that [book].” But it 
doesn’t get to stay in the object position. 
□
□
The object relative pronoun gets fronted to the beginning of 
the relative clause, up next to the noun it modifiers: “the book 
[I just finished that]” turns into “the book that I just finished.” 
Then you can delete the that: “the book I just finished.”
■
■
When the relative pronoun is the subject of the relative clause, it 
is already up in the front. Let’s take the sentence, “I saw my friend 
who lives in Beijing.” Who is in subject position, already at the 
head of the relative clause. We cannot omit the relative pronoun 
when it is the subject: “I saw my friend who lives in Beijing”  
doesn’t work. 
■
■
But when it is an object relative pronoun, we can omit: “I can’t 
remember the name of the person whom I met last night” works 
because it is still easy to parse. The noun person is followed by 
another noun, I, so we know that we have hit a relative clause. 
Pied-Piping
■
■
Pied-piping sometimes happens when the relative pronoun is 
the object of a preposition in the relative clause. An example: 
“I am wondering whom I should send the RSVP to.” The whom 
gets fronted; the question is what happens to that preposition at  
the end.
■
■
Grammatically, it can stay there at the end of the sentence (we’ll 
come back to the rule about that in Lecture 18). Or we can front it: 

51
English Grammar Boot Camp
“I’m wondering to whom I should send the RSVP.”  This is called 
pied-piping because it is following the relative pronoun just like the 
children following the Pied Piper.
■
■
What happens when we’re not using a whom but a that as the 
object of the preposition? Consider this sentence: “She read the 
book that I referred to.” If we decide to pied-pipe the preposition, 
the that must turn into a which: “She read the book to which I 
referred.” Why? Because. Because English syntax is full of little 
idiosyncrasies made to seem normal through usage. 
Animate Beings
■
■
Here’s another oddity with relative pronouns: As a general rule, 
we restrict who and whom to animate beings. But there is an 
exception. We have an odd gap in the language for how to handle 
possessive relative pronouns for inanimate objects. 
■
■
An example will help here: “I returned the computer whose hard 
drive is broken.” Another example: “The car whose horn is blaring 
is driving me crazy.” We can use that’s there—“The car that’s horn 
is blaring”—but whose is also accepted as standard.
■
■
Where do animals fall in terms of the animate/inanimate line? A 
general rule can be to use that when we’re talking about animals 
in general, but who when talking about a specific animal.
You could say, “The cat that 
ate a canary might get sick,” 
or, “Our cat Emily, who ate a 
canary, might get sick.”

1.	 Have you ever wondered where the rules in the grammar checker in 
your word processing program come from? If you haven’t, why haven’t 
you asked that question?

you make of that?

t grates on some people when others say “an historical novel” or “an 
historic event.” A and an are indefinite articles used with countable nouns 
(like historical novels or historic events). This lecture aims to unravel the 
rules surrounding those articles, answering questions like: Which one 
goes best before words like historical? Then the lecture moves on to cover 
determiners more generally as a lexical class. We’ll close with a look at 
some capitalization issues.
A versus An
■
■
When it comes to a and an, the general rule is a before 
consonants and an before vowels. Examples are “a cat” and “an 
elephant.” Exceptions exist, though: Take “a unicorn,” where the u 
is pronounced like a y, which is a consonant.
■
■
What happens with the words history and historical? Over time, 
the /h/ sound has become more likely to be pronounced at the 
beginning (moving the word from ’istoric to historic in practice). 
Today, the Associated Press Stylebook and Chicago Manual of 
Style both recommend a historic(al). 
■
■
The site Grammarist calls an historic “an unnecessary affectation.” 
Maeve Maddox, on dailywritingtips.com, quotes comment sections 
on this. There is much vitriol, including: “When people use ‘an 
historical’ on NPR, it’s because [they’re] snooty.”
■
■
It is useful to step back and remember that we’re just talking 
about the presence or absence of one consonant: a versus an. 
This shows how loaded even the smallest language choices can 
A(n) Historical Issue
Lecture

54
Lecture 8  ▪  A(n) Historical Issue
become. They can get you judged as snooty in some cases and 
illiterate in others.
Determiners
■
■
A/an, as indefinite articles, both fall in the broader category of 
determiners. Determiners are the little words that introduce nouns 
to create noun phrases. We’ll focus on three things: the highly 
intuitive rules that govern their ordering, the agreement issues 
with the word either, and some regional differences in usage. 
■
■
The category of determiners is bigger than many people realize, and 
there isn’t a lot of agreement about how to categorize them. Let’s 
look at just one way we can subdivide the set. Here’s one version 
with seven major categories, forming the acronym Pi and IQ. 
□
□
Possessives (my, her, their, our)
□
□
Interrogatives (which, what, whatever)
□
□
Articles (a, an, the)
□
□
Numbers (cardinal and ordinal: one/two and first/second)
□
□
Demonstratives (this, that, these, those)
□
□
Indefinites (any, each, other, another)
□
□
Quantifiers (many, some, several, most)
■
■
We can also subdivide this set into three categories based on 
the order in which they occur in a noun phrase: predeterminers, 
central determiners, and postdeterminers. Those terms are just 
about order.
■
■
Two examples are, “The first several pages” or “all my many 
quirks.” We wouldn’t say, “the several first pages” or “my all 

55
English Grammar Boot Camp
many quirks.” How do we know this? This is the kind of intuitive 
knowledge that makes up a lot of “descriptive grammar.”
■
■
Let’s go through how the determiners sort into these three categories 
based on the order in which they appear in the noun phrase.
□
□
Predeterminers include terms like all/both, multiplying 
expressions, and fractions. 
□
□
Central determiners include definite and indefinite articles, 
possessives, and demonstratives.
□
□
Postdeterminers include cardinal and ordinal numbers; 
general ordinals (like next and last); and quantifiers (like many 
and some). 
Adjectives and Pronouns versus Determiners
■
■
How are determiners different from adjectives and pronouns? 
We’ll start with adjectives. Adjectives are an open class (we can 
add new ones) and determiners are a closed class (we don’t get 
new ones very often at all).
■
■
Adjectives can occur before a noun and then out in the predicate 
(e.g., “the friendly cat” and “the cat is friendly”). Determiners only 
appear before the noun: “the cat” and not “cat is the.”
■
■
Adjectives will consistently fall between the determiners and the 
noun: “All our friendly cats, not “all friendly our cats.” Additionally, 
adjectives can be modified by an intensifier like very: “very friendly.” 
And adjectives usually make comparatives: “more friendly.”
■
■
Let’s now look at determiners compared with pronouns. Many 
of the words that function as determiners can also function as 
pronouns. The key is whether the word is standing alone in the 
place of a noun, as opposed to modifying a noun.

56
Lecture 8  ▪  A(n) Historical Issue
□
□
Take the example of many. Consider the difference between 
“Many clichés have some wisdom in them,” and in a 
conversation about clichés, “Many have some wisdom in 
them.” In the latter sentence, Many stands in for clichés, but in 
the former, it modifies clichés.
□
□
The, a, and an cannot be pronouns.
Regional Variation
■
■
Now that we have defined determiners and how they work within 
the noun phrase, let’s look at some regional variation.
■
■
If we’re speaking generically, in British English someone is “in 
hospital,” but in American English they’re “in the hospital.” 
■
■
Note that Americans “go to prison” and “go to college”—which is 
different from going to “the prison” or “the school” to visit.
Capitalization
■
■
To close this lecture, let’s look at a capitalization issue that can 
come up when we think about determiners: capitalization of nouns 
like president.
□
□
If we’re talking about a president in general, clearly it’s not 
capitalized. And when we refer to the current president—so if it 
were 1978, we’d say President Carter—it is clearly capitalized. 
□
□
But what about when you refer to “the president/President” of 
the U.S.? In this case, you mean the current president, but 
you don’t say President [Name].
■
■
Note that capitalization has been a moving target in the history 
of English; our current rules are relatively recent and still to some 
extent in flux.

57
English Grammar Boot Camp
□
□
In the Renaissance, there was a good amount of variation in 
terms of nouns that might get capitalized in the middle of a 
sentence, sometimes for emphasis.
□
□
By the 17th century, it was settling down: A word would be 
capitalized at the beginning of a sentence, in proper names, 
the word I, and in important nouns like titles and personified 
nouns (such as Virtue).
□
□
The 18th century witnessed increased use of capitalization for 
nouns deemed important and for things like fields (such as 
Rhetoric). Ben Franklin was quite fond of this practice, and it 
appears in the Constitution and Declaration of Independence.
□
□
In the second half of the 
18th century, grammarians 
clamped down on this 
use of capital letters for 
nouns of special note. 
Grammarians started to 
claim that it “disfigures” 
one’s 
writing 
to 
use 
capitals for all nouns. 
Capitalizing for emphasis 
started to be proscribed in 
19th century.
■
■
Today, capitalization is mostly 
restricted to the start of a 
sentence, proper names, and 
titles when they occur with the 
person’s name.
□
□
According to the Chicago Manual of Style, we are not to 
capitalize titles even when the referent is specific (so we’d say 
“Dean Munson,” but “the dean”). The exception is in cases of 
18th-Century Capitalization
"No Person except a natural 
born Citizen, or a Citizen 
of the United States, at the 
time of the Adoption of this 
Constitution, shall be eligible 
to the Office of President" —
the U.S. Constitution
"…we mutually pledge to 
each other our Lives, our 
Fortunes, and our sacred 
Honor." —the Declaration of 
Independence

58
﻿
directly addressing someone, in which case it would be “Mr. 
President,” or “Senator.”
■
■
But you will certainly see capitalization of “the Dean” or “the 
President,” which can be read as an attempt to be formal and 
polite. This drives some people crazy, but there isn’t an intuitive 
logic to using “President Roosevelt” and “the president” when 
we’re talking about the same person.
■
■
Bryan Garner points out the contradiction of “Stone Age” 
(capitalized) versus “space age.” He does provide leeway for 
capitalizing for “some rhetorical purpose,” although he asks us to 
minimize capitalization
■
■
Another capitalization issues that might trip you up: You have to 
figure out whether the is part of a newspaper title: The New York 
Times versus the Los Angeles Times.
■
■
In 2016, the Associated Press decided to stop capitalizing Internet 
and Web, saying most viewed them as generic. But there has been

one Slate writer put it, “It’s one place as proper and unique as 
Saturn. And it’s utterly reasonable to capitalize this realm’s name.”

Now for a historical note on why we capitalize I. It used to be ic, but 
lost the c by the 12th century. By the late 1300s, the letter/pronoun 
was becoming taller. It has been pretty consistently capitalized in 
written standard English ever since
■
■
Why I is now capitalized is one of those mysteries of the language, 
and can strike non-English speakers as odd. They may also find 
it odd that English is capitalized in English, as not all languages 
consider the names of languages to be proper nouns.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Rules about capitalization in English have fluctuated over the past few 
centuries. If we’re referring to the current elected leader of the United 
States, would you advocate writing “the president” or “the President?”

Lecture 9  ▪  Funnest Lecture Ever
T
his lecture covers adjectives, starting with the fuss around the terms 
fun, funner, and funnest. Next the lecture turns to a general discussion 
of comparatives and superlatives. We’ll talk about those, along with double 
comparatives, and then turn to an odd set of adjectives that mean different 
things depending on where they appear in the sentence. At the end of the 
lecture, we’ll talk about how to handle noun phrases where the adjective, 
oddly, shows up after the noun.
A Fun Question
■
■
Let’s start with a recent question from the ballot for the AHD Usage 
Panel. It is about the word fun. Panelists received five sentences 
and had to rate each one on a four-point scale: completely 
acceptable, somewhat acceptable, somewhat unacceptable, or 
completely unacceptable. Here are the first three, innocuous-
seeming sentences:
□
□
That party was really fun.
□
□
That party was so fun.
□
□
We went to a fun party.
■
■
What’s the point of asking about those sentences? Why would 
anyone be concerned about them? The answer lies in the history 
of the word fun. The word is only relatively recently an adjective. It 
showed up as a noun in the early 1700s.
Funnest Lecture Ever
Lecture
9

61
English Grammar Boot Camp
■
■
It’s hard to know exactly when it started being used as an adjective. 
It isn’t until the 1950s that it showed up with any regularity. 
Interestingly, the Oxford English Dictionary has not yet recorded 
fun as an adjective. The dictionary has it as a noun.
■
■
Younger speakers at this point see the adjective fun as standard; 
there are some lingering concerns but they are dwindling. Bryan 
Garner, however, argues that fun as an adjective “remains casual 
at best.”
■
■
Back to the usage ballot. The last two sentences in the fun entry were:
□
□
That party was funner than I expected.
□
□
That was the funnest party I’ve been to this year.
■
■
If you’re cringing right now, you’re not alone. But let’s take a closer 
look to see if funner and funnest are really wrong. This look takes 
us back to the newness of the adjective.
■
■
As a noun, fun takes more: “more fun.” This is why, right now, fun 
often still takes more even when it is an adjective. But lots of other 
one-syllable adjectives make the comparative and superlative in 

62
Lecture 9  ▪  Funnest Lecture Ever
a different way: tall/taller/tallest, wide/wider/widest, smart/smarter/
smartest, blue/bluer/bluest.
■
■
Kids, when they learn the word fun, make it behave like other 
one-syllable adjectives until corrected. But a shift is underway: 
Students have a much stronger negative reaction to funner than to 
funnest. This course’s prediction is that kids will win out in the long 
term. Some advice for now: Beware of funner.
Comparatives and Superlatives
■
■
The usage question about fun/funner/funnest makes for a 
good introduction to a lecture on adjectives because one of 
the characteristic features of adjectives is that they create 
comparatives and superlatives. 
■
■
One-syllable adjectives typically take –er and –est to form 
comparatives and superlatives. These inflectional endings are 
the oldest way to create comparatives and superlatives. English 
used to rely much more heavily on inflectional endings than it does 
now. The historical antecedents of –er and –est were the default in 
Old English. The use of more and most is newer; it spread slowly 
through 14th century and peaked in the late medieval period. 
■
■
Then an unpredictable thing happened: By the Renaissance, 
inflected forms with –er and –est began reasserting themselves. 
The history of English generally involves the loss of inflections, but 
speakers are unpredictable.
■
■
Now we have had something of a division of function. Generally, 
–er and –est are used for shorter (and more frequent) adjectives 
made up of one or two syllables. More and most are used for 
longer (and less frequent) adjectives. Those are typically three 
syllables or more, but it can occur with two-syllable adjectives as 
well. Two-syllable adjectives can go either way.
■
■
What is going on with those two-syllable adjectives? It’s not a total 
free-for-all. One study suggests that when the adjective precedes 

63
English Grammar Boot Camp
the noun, it favors the –er/–est ending; for example, “the coolest 
school ever.” When the adjective is out in the predicate, it favors 
more or most: “Sam was a little more cool.”
■
■
We also know that the sound of the final syllable in an adjective or 
the suffix at the end of an adjective can have an impact.
□
□
The ending –y prefers –er/–est: Happy becomes happiest; 
easy becomes easiest.
□
□
The ending –ful tends to take more or most: more hopeful; 
most cheerful.
■
■
Studies of comparatives and superlatives in contemporary spoken 
English will turn up a not insignificant number of double forms, 
usually with two-syllable adjectives, such as more wealthier and 
most deadliest. These are now severely criticized.
Historical Uses
■
■
Let’s look at historical figures that we deem to be very literate 
who used double comparatives and superlatives. Here are some 
examples from Shakespeare:
□
□
In Measure for Measure: “To some more fitter place”
□
□
In King Lear: “To take the basest, and most poorest shape”
□
□
In King Lear: “Harbour more craft, and more corrupter ends”
■
■
Interestingly, these have all sorted out in different ways. Fit usually 
takes –er or –est, but more/most fit is not uncommon. Corrupt now 
almost categorically takes more or most. Poor overwhelming uses 
–er or –est.
■
■
Of course, there are some adjectives that at least theoretically 
can’t take comparative and superlative forms because their 
meanings do not allow for comparison: unique, equal, perfect, and 

64
Lecture 9  ▪  Funnest Lecture Ever
pregnant, for example. In reality, all four of these do show up with 
comparatives sometimes
■
■
More perfect is perhaps the most famous in the U.S. The phrase “a 
more perfect Union” appears in the Preamble to the Constitution. 
Is this wrong? Patricia O’Conner and Stewart Kellerman provide 
a useful defense on their blog Grammarphobia. They argue that 
more perfect is capturing the process of striving toward perfection 
rather than surpassing it.
■
■
The issue with unique is different; here, we are getting a change 
in meaning. The word spawned from the Latin unicus, meaning 
“single, sole, alone of its kind.” 
□
□
It came into English via French, appearing in the early 17th 
century and meaning “one of a kind.”
□
□
But by the mid-18th century there were already examples 
where it meant “remarkable” or “unusual.” Lots of people still 
don’t like this, but it’s not new.
□
□
Nevertheless, we probably want to be careful with more 
unique in formal writing: When the AHD Usage Panel was 
surveyed in 2004, 66 percent of the panelists disapproved of 
“Her designs are quite unique.” But this was down from 80 
percent in 1988.
□
□
Editors of the AHD point out some very rhetorically effective 
uses of comparative unique, such as this sentence from 
Martin Luther King Jr.: “I am in the rather unique position 
of being the son, the grandson, and the great-grandson of 
preachers.” 
Two-Syllable Adjectives
■
■
Let’s now return to two-syllable adjectives, and whether they 
appear in attributive or predicative positions. An attributive 
adjective appears right before the noun: “coolest school.” A 

65
English Grammar Boot Camp
predicative one appears after a linking verb like was: “Sam was 
more cool.”
■
■
There are a few adjectives that typically if not exclusively appear 
only in the attributive or predicative position. The adjectives 
former and latter appear only attributively: “the former point.” The 
adjectives awake and asleep typically appear only predicatively: 
“The student is asleep.” 
■
■
But we can imagine contexts, especially where we are setting up 
a contrast, where adjectives like awake and asleep could be used 
attributively: “Look at that student over there. No, not the awake 
one, the asleep one.”
■
■
Another set of adjectives mean different things when they are 
used attributively and predicatively. Let’s take the adjective late as 
an example: “His wife is late” has a much different meaning from 
“his late wife.”
■
■
The adjective sheer also changes: “The curtains are sheer” 
contrasts sharply with “That is sheer stupidity.” In “sheer stupidity,” 
sheer is doing a kind of intensifying work. 
Post-Noun Adjectives
■
■
We have a few phrases where the adjective appears after the noun, 
usually because they have been borrowed from French. Attorney 
general may be the most common, but we also have the solicitor 
general, postmaster general, surgeon general, and the like. Other 
examples include poet laureate and professor emeritus/emerita.
■
■
These are often official titles and part of government or law (e.g., 
heir apparent, court martial). They are mostly left over from post–
Norman Conquest England, when French and Latin were the 
languages of court, law, and nobility.
■
■
The usage issue is how to make them plural. Let’s take attorney 
general, which means “the attorney with the most general jurisdiction.” 

66
Lecture 9  ▪  Funnest Lecture Ever
The plural should be attorneys general. The same system applies for 
poets laureate, surgeons general, and heirs apparent.
■
■
What about court martial? Courts martial appears in writing, but 
you can find court martials in speech. There is probably some 
confusion here with the completely different but similar-sounding 
court marshal, which refers to a judicial officer who provides 
security and handles other processes in a court.
■
■
In sum, if you find yourself writing about attorneys general or poets 
laureate or courts martial, remember that they are quirky in their 
Frenchness, check your intuitions about where the adjective is in 
the compound, and put that –s on the first word—not the second.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Try spelling out your objections to funner and funnest, and don’t settle 
for “It doesn’t sound right.” What is actually wrong with these words?
2.	 Can the word unique mean “one of a kind” and “very unusual” at the

T
his lecture is about the simple past tense form and past participles, 
as well as about some idiosyncrasies in English verbs. We’ll start by 
clarifying the past tense versus past participles. We’ll look at questions like: 
Why is went the past tense of go? What’s happening with the phrase have 
went? The lecture also looks at the process of regularization of verbs, as 
well as what happens when irregularities come up. We’ll close with a look 
at usage issues like proved versus proven.
Past Tense and Past Participles
■
■
How do you create the past tense of a verb? It can seem like such 
a straightforward question with a simple answer: Add an –ed. 
Except for all the verbs where you don’t do that.
□
□
The simple answer is true for the majority of verbs: talked, 
walked, played, dined, stayed, etc.
□
□
But consider verbs with vowel changes: sing/sang, drink/
drank, swing/swung, hold/held, run/ran, and so on.
■
■
Old English had two classes of regular verbs: weak (which take 
–ed) and strong (which take a vowel change). Over time, many 
strong became weak. For example, swell’s past-tense version 
went from swoll to swelled. The verb shine is still undergoing 
the change now, from shone to shined. Now, strong verbs are 
considered “irregular.” But they still have a pattern: sing becomes 
sang, swim becomes swam, and drink becomes drank.
Going, Going, Went
Lecture
10

68
Lecture 10  ▪  Going, Going, Went
■
■
The past participle is formed differently for the two different classes 
of verbs. The past participle is the form used in perfect aspect 
(e.g., have talked) and the passive voice (e.g., was written).
□
□
To form a past participle with regular verbs, add –ed. This 
means the past tense and the past participle are the same.
□
□
With irregular verbs, often a vowel changes. Sung, the past 
participle of sing/sang, is an example. And sometimes –en is 
added: Written is the past participle of write/wrote. 
Have Went
■
■
So, what’s going on with have went? Why do people say, “It seems 
to have went well” instead of “It seems to have gone well?” Think 
about all those regular verbs where past tense is the same as the 
past participle.
■
■
With irregular verbs, the past tense and past participle are 
typically different: we drank/we have drunk. But there can be an 
understandable tendency to regularize the verbs to make past 
tense and past participle identical, like regular verbs: we have 
went or we have drank.
■
■
Will have went and have drank win because they are more 
regular? It’s hard to know: They could, but language can maintain 
irregularities for a long time, especially with common words like 
go, drink, and run.
Irregularities
■
■
While regularization can be a powerful force, sometimes we 
create new irregularities: Consider dive/dove and sneak/snuck. 
Snuck is an Americanism. Bryan Garner still describes snuck as 
nonstandard—even though he notes that it appears almost as 
often as sneaked in modern print materials.
■
■
To show the kinds of irregularities we can maintain without even 
noticing it, let’s consider the verb to be.

□
Present: am, is, are
□
□
Past: was, were
□

Past participle: been

Present participle: being
□
□
Infinitive: be
■
■
What a mess! Three different stems came together over time: b–, 
w–, and vowels. The present tense also has more forms than any 
other verb: First-person singular (am), third-person singular (is), 
and plural (are).
■
■
Other verbs just have two present-tense forms: the base form 
and the third-person singular. But in some dialects, there is only 
the base form: she walk and he go. This is nonstandard but 
totally logical and the completion of a longstanding change in the 
language of losing verb inflections. We used to have –est as in 
thou sayest and –en as in they sayen.
Present Participles and Lie/Lay
■
■
At this point in the lecture, we have covered four of the five forms 
of every verb: the base form (example: talk), the third-person 
singular (talks), the past tense (talked), and the past participle 
(talked). The fifth is the present participle, which takes the base 
word plus –ing; for example, talking or writing.
■
■
Even the most confusing verbs are regular in the present 
participle, like lie/lay. But what is going on with those verbs? 
They’re frequently misused. Garner says they spawn “one of the 
most widely known of all usage errors.” When should we use lie/
lay/have lain versus lay/laid/have laid?
■
■
In Old English, there were some intransitive strong verbs, like 
lie, that had related –ed verbs that could be used transitively (or 

70
Lecture 10  ▪  Going, Going, Went
causatively). In other words, a verb like lie had a related verb that 
meant to cause something to lie down—i.e., to lay it down. 
■
■
This is why the past tense lay (which is intransitive) looks identical 
to the base for the transitive verb lay (whose past tense is then 
laid). Speakers and writers have been confusing them for over  
500 years.
■
■
“Lay myself down to sleep” works because myself is the object: 
People lay objects down. But someone can also lie down on a bed 
to sleep. 
■
■
Do you lie low or lay low when you are hiding out? The answer 
is both. Garner describes lay low as “loose,” but he recognizes it 
as common—and quotes William Safire, among others, using the 
past-tense “I laid low.”
Grammatical Information
■
■
Now that we have all these forms, we can talk about all the 
grammatical information they carry within a sentence, such as 
tense and aspect.
■
■
The three tenses are typically present, past, and future. But some 
linguists will say the tenses are actually past and non-past. “The 
plane lands at 5:00 pm” would be non-past. Of course, we do 
express the future, but not with an inflectional ending. Take, for 
example, will and gonna. We’ll come back to auxiliary verbs in the 
next lecture.
■
■
Aspect refers to how we view an event with respect to time (versus 
when it occurred in time). Progressive and perfect are the two 
most well-known aspects.
□
□
Progressive describes actions in progress at the moment we 
are talking about them. An example: “Her husband is cooking 
right now.” 

71
English Grammar Boot Camp
□
□
Perfect describes an action in the past and its relation to 
another moment in time.
▪▪
Present perfect covers an action that began in the past 
and is still happening  or relevant now: “I have run five 
miles.”  Present perfect can also suggest that something 
happened recently: “I have started running.”
▪▪
Past perfect covers an action that began in the past and 
ended before another moment in the past: “I had run five 
miles when my shoe fell off.”
■
■
For fun, we can combine the perfect and the progressive, as in, “I 
have been running for two hours.” This started in the past and in 
progress now.
■
■
Standard English does not have a way to express habitual aspect 
through the verb form, but African American English (one of the 
systematic dialects of American English) does. Be serves as 
a habitual verb: “She be running these days.” Standard English 
does this primarily with adverbials, like usually or all the time. 
■
■
Habitual be is seen as nonstandard variation, but there is a 
system there—it’s just different from Standard American English. 
Note that Standard American English has variations of its own, like  
swelled/swollen.
Proved versus Proven
■
■
When it comes to proved versus proven, the latter has been 
criticized in the past. The verb was borrowed from French and 
was regular, but then developed proven, which originates in past 
participle of Scottish English preve.
■
■
When proven was newer, it met with resistance, to say the least. 
Richard Grant White, in Words and Their Uses, Past and Present, 
wrote in 1876: 

72
Lecture 10  ▪  Going, Going, Went
	
[Proven], which is frequently used now by lawyers and 
journalists, should, perhaps, be ranked among words that 
are not words. … Proved is the past participle of the verb to 
prove, and should be used by all who wish to speak English. 
■
■
Garner weighed in: “Proved has long been the preferred past 
participle of prove. But proven often ill-advisedly appears.” 
■
■
But many of us use proven as a past participle, as in this sentence 
from the Journal of International Affairs: “The above mentioned 
measures have been implemented half-heartedly and for the most 
part have proven to be ineffective.” This is a useful reminder that 
views on what is good and bad usage change over time. Proven is 
now unremarkable for many if not most of us.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Why might speakers introduce new irregular past tense forms into the 
language, such as dove and snuck?
2.	 Would you say/write “have proved” or “have proven”? Would you 
consider both of them standard usage? If so, why is this variation in 
standard usage OK?

W
e’ll spend this lecture thinking about how we categorize verbs based 
on how they function in the sentence. Specifically, we’ll ask: Do they 
take an object, or two, or none? There are a surprising number of usage 
issues linked to this categorization of verbs, including the “It is me” versus 
“It is I” conundrum. We’ll start with linking verbs, and then we’ll move on 
to the transitive versus intransitive distinction, including some usage 
questions. The lecture closes with some less known types of verbs.
It Is Me?
■
■
A common conundrum is the question: Do we say “It is me” or “It is I”? 
The traditional rule for this construction sets out “It is I” as the correct 
form. The basis for the correction is that to be is a linking verb, which 
equates the subject with the predicate noun phrase or adjective 
phrase that follows it, for example, “Anne is a grammar geek.” 
■
■
Semantically, the linking verb equates the subject noun phrase and 
the noun or adjective phrase in the predicate. But what happens 
grammatically? The subject is in the nominative case, which means 
that if it is a pronoun it will be I, we, he, she, they, or you.
■
■
Does the predicate noun also need to be in the nominative? Some 
prescription on this question says yes, so we’d get “It is I” and “It 
is she speaking.” But it sounds very odd to most of us to say, “It 
is we” instead of “It’s us.” Here’s another awkward sentence: “I 
asked who called yesterday, and it was he.” 
Object Lessons
Lecture

74
Lecture 11  ▪  Object Lessons
■
■
The good news: Many usage guides now say that both “It 
is me” and “It is I” are acceptable. It is, rather than an issue of 
grammaticality, an issue of formality.
Good or Well?
■
■
To be is far and away the most common linking verb—because 
it is the most common verb. There is a well-known usage issue 
around its linking status: When someone asks, “How are you?” are 
you good or are you well?
■
■
Some people learn to say, “I am well” but not “I am good.”  But 
this prescription does not hold up under scrutiny. Given that to be 
is a linking verb, in the clause “I am _____,” we should expect an 
adjective (like terrible or tired).
■
■
Well is both an adjective and an adverb, and this is part of where 
things get confused. Well is the adverb form of good: “I’m a good 
cook” can also be stated as “I cook well.” But well is also an 
adjective in reference to health.
■
■
Good is generally an adjective: “the good food.” But in some 
nonstandard varieties of English, it is also an adverb: “He runs 
good.” This is a fairly stigmatized construction.
■
■
One theory is that concerns about good as an adverb have bled 
over to encourage a sense that there is something wrong with “I 
am good,” but there, good is serving as an adjective, just as it is in 
“I feel good.” So in reality, we can say either, depending on what 
we mean. Also consider formality.
Bad or Badly?
■
■
Feel is another linking verb, and it raises a usage question of its 
own: When something unfortunate happens and you are feeling 
sympathy for someone, are you feeling bad or badly?

75
English Grammar Boot Camp
■
■
The confusion stems from this: Feel can be a transitive verb (“I felt 
the cold tile under my feet”); an intransitive verb (“I can feel!”); and 
a linking verb (“I feel ducky”).
■
■
Bad is an adjective and badly is an adverb. We would use bad after 
any other linking verb: “That seems bad.” And we would use badly 
after an intransitive verb: “I failed badly.” At least in theory, one can 
feel bad or feel badly, but it seems the latter doesn’t come up often. 
■
■
There is, technically, a meaning difference between I feel badly 
and I feel bad. If you feel badly, the idea is that you have a bad 
sense of feel; if you feel bad, you have a bad feeling. Technically, 
then, you feel bad for someone else’s misfortune—although that 
sounds overly informal or even wrong to many speakers.

76
Lecture 11  ▪  Object Lessons
■
■
It looks like confusion has led to anxiety about what is correct. That 
has led to some hypercorrection. In the end we may need to rethink 
what is technically correct (feel badly may become standard).
Objects
■
■
With all other verbs in English (sometimes referred to as action 
verbs), we talk about their relationship to objects. Can they take 
an object or not? If so, can they take one object or two?
■
■
It’s actually a mistake to think of these as categories of verbs. 
It’s more accurate to think about it as how a verb behaves in a 
sentence, as many verbs can appear both with and without 
objects. For example, take the verb read: It can take no object, 
one object, or two objects.
□
□
No object: “I read” or “I read every day.” Here, read is intransitive.
□
□
One object: “I read the newspaper.” Here, read is 
monotransitive, or just transitive.
□
□
Two objects:  “I read my grandmother the newspaper.” Here, 
read is ditransitive. 
■
■
Intransitive verbs don’t take objects and transitive ones take at least 
one. Even verbs we typically think of as intransitive can often be 
made transitive. For example: “I walk” can become “I walk the dog.”
■
■
Sometimes this is controversial, as in the case of whether grow 
can be transitive outside of agriculture. Take, for example, this 
sentence: “One of our key strategies is to grow our business by 
increasing the number of clients.” In 1992, 80 percent of the AHD 
Usage Panel rejected it; in 2014, 60 percent accepted it.
Word Order
■
■
To talk in more detail about transitivity, let’s step back and talk 
briefly about word order in English. The subject/object relationship 
is determined pretty much entirely by word order at this point.

77
English Grammar Boot Camp
□
□
With ditransitive verbs, the direct and indirect object always 
appear in the same order. Here’s an example: “I sent her my 
tennis racket.” There, the subject (I) occurs before the verb 
(sent), which occurs before the indirect object (her), which 
occurs before the direct object (tennis racket). The indirect 
object covers to or for whom the action was done. The direct 
object is the recipient of the action.
□
□
In Modern English, the order will always be (1) subject, (2) 
verb, (3) indirect object, and (4) direct object: “(1) My friend 
(2) made (3) me a (4) birthday cake.” Note that the indirect 
object can always be bumped to the end with to/for: “I sent my 
tennis racket to her.”
Other Subsets
■
■
Complex transitive verbs look like they have two objects, but they 
function differently from ditransitive verbs. Take this example: “We 
elected Morgan president of the class.” Morgan is the object and 
then president of the class is being equated with Morgan. 
■
■
President of the class here would be called an object complement. 
It completes the predicate and refers to the object. It could also be 
called an object predicative. There can also be an adjective there: 
“My brother called me crazy.”
■
■
Another subset of verbs always appear with a prepositional 
phrase as their complement. Let’s take the verb depend. It can 
be intransitive (“It depends”), but if we want to specify what it 
depends on, we have to use on: “It depends on the weather,” not, 
“It depends the weather.”
■
■
The verb listen works much the same way. We can listen 
intransitively. If we want to specify the object, we have to add to: 
“We listened to music.” Technically, these verbs don’t take a direct 
object; they take a prepositional phrase.

A final subset of verbs look like verbs that require prepositional 
phrases, but they work differently. These are phrasal verbs; they’re 
composed of a main verb and a particle (or sometimes two). A 
particle is a word that fulfills a grammatical function but doesn’t 
fall into a traditional lexical category. Examples of particles include 
call up, ask out, look up, and come down with.
■
■
One might think it was a verb plus a preposition, but you can test 
and tell the difference. Let’s look at the difference between these 
two sentences:
□
□
“Mary looked up the hill.”
□
□
“Mary looked up my phone number.”
■
■
In “Mary looked up the hill,” up the hill is a prepositional phrase 
expressing where Mary looked. It functions as a unit. 
■
■
In “Mary looked up my phone number,” looked up is a unit. You 
can move the object to create, “Mary looked my phone number 
up” or “Mary looked it up.” But you can’t do “Up my phone number 
is where Mary looked,” because up my phone number is not a 
prepositional phrase.
■
■
In these cases, you have a phrasal verb with a direct object. And 
these verbs will come back when we talk about the well-known 
rule about whether you can end a sentence with a preposition—
because sometimes it is not a preposition.
Question to Consider
1.	 At this point English follows fairly strict subject-verb-object word order. 
Can you come up with examples where the object comes first?

P
erhaps the best-known usage rule involving auxiliary (or helping) verbs 
is the distinction between—or the lack of distinction—between can and 
may. This lecture covers that issue, as well as many other sticking points 
that we run into when using auxiliary verbs. We’ll spend a deal of time on 
the verb will. The issue of combining auxiliary verbs will also get attention, 
and we’ll close with a look at the word ain’t.
Can and May
■
■
There is a traditional rule that may is about permission and can 
is about ability. So, for example, a student can leave a class 
whenever they want to; the issue is whether they may leave (with 
permission from the instructor). 
■
■
Historically, can has been used to express permission for almost 
200 years—so these two auxiliary verbs overlap in the realm of 
permission. Note that we don’t use may for ability.
■
■
There are times when all of us want to use can for permission. 
Specifically in a contracted negative construction, we prefer can’t 
to mayn’t when we’re talking about permission: “Can’t I come?” 
works much better than “Mayn’t I come?” 
■
■
For some speakers, can versus may is a formality distinction 
regarding permission. However, as of 2009, 37 percent of the AHD 
Usage Panel rejects can when used for permission, specifically in 
the question, “Can I take another week to submit the application?” 
Rejection is falling, but that is still over a third of the Usage Panel. 
Shall We?
Lecture
12

80
Lecture 12  ▪  Shall We?
■
■
A side note: Both can and may express possibility for the future: 
“It may get crazy in here!” or “It can snow in Michigan in May.” The 
usage issue we’ve been talking about here is not about possibility, 
but about permission versus ability.
Auxiliary Verbs
■
■
Can and may are two of nine modal auxiliary verbs, or modals, 
in English. The other seven are may, might, must, could, shall, 
should, will, and would. Modal auxiliaries express ability, necessity, 
obligation, or permission. This is referred to as deontic modality. 
They can also express assessment of reality or likelihood, which is 
called epistemic modality.
■
■
For example, deontic must is about obligation or necessity: “I must 
finish this essay.” Epistemic must is an evaluation of reality: “It 
must have fallen below freezing last night.”
■
■
In addition to the nine modal auxiliaries, there are three auxiliary 
verbs, known as primary auxiliaries, that are not modals: be, have, 
At a play, you might hear the formal 
instruction, “Audience members may 
take photographs,” or the more informal, 
“Yes, you can take a photo.”

81
English Grammar Boot Camp
and do. All auxiliaries appear before the main verb and require a 
main verb, except in cases of elision. 
Modals
■
■
Modals work differently from other verbs in that they do not inflect: 
There is no –s or past tense –ed. “She mights” or “They musted” 
don’t happen. There is also no –ing (“Coulding” never occurs) and 
no past participle (“He has shalled” doesn’t happen either).
■
■
Modals have no infinitive form, and the main verb after them 
appears in the base or infinitive form: It’s “can go,” not “can goes.” 
We can see the effect of inserting a modal on our understanding 
of whether something is possible or likely or allowed. Take  
these examples:
□
□
I play ping-pong.
□
□
I can play ping-pong. (Someone has asked if I know how or 
permission.)
□
□
I might play ping-pong. (This is a possibility in the future.)
□
□
I would play ping-pong. (This is a possibility, perhaps if 
something else happens.)
□
□
I must play ping-pong. (Two interpretations: I need to do this 
for whatever reason, or this must be true—e.g., you found 
photos of me playing last week.)
■
■
The auxiliary modal will also has two meanings, the most common 
of which is future tense. It can also express epistemic modality of 
something we think is likely to happen or want to happen. Think 
about the two different interpretations of this sentence:
□
□
I will play ping-pong. (This is a simple statement of future action.)

82
Lecture 12  ▪  Shall We?
□
□
I will play ping-pong! (This expresses determination to learn 
this sport.)
■
■
In standard varieties of English, you get only one modal per verb 
phrase, but in some varieties of Southern American English, you 
can get double modals or multiple modals.
□
□
Examples include might could, might should, may can, and 
useta could. In a sentence, someone might say, “I might 
should send a contribution.”
□
□
It’s not impossible to put two modals next to each other in 
English. It doesn’t typically occur in standard English, but it 
occurs in other varieties.
Primaries
■
■
The three primary auxiliary verbs do much heavy lifting. Two of 
them (be and have) express aspect and voice for verbs, and 
auxiliary do has become all wrapped up in how we ask questions 
and express negation.
■
■
The three primary auxiliaries do inflect within the verb phrase; for 
example: “I am talking,” “she has listened,” and “he does exercise.” 
In talking about these three auxiliaries, let’s start with be, have, 
and aspect. 
□
□
The progressive aspect takes be: “I am playing ping-pong” 
and “I was playing ping-pong.”
□
□
The perfect aspect takes have: “I have played ping-pong” and 
“I had played ping-pong.”
■
■
The auxiliary be also plays a role in creating passive voice. This 
takes be plus a past participle: “The ping-pong paddle was stolen.”
■
■
Then there is auxiliary do, which has dramatically increased its 
functions in English grammar since the Renaissance. Do has long 

83
English Grammar Boot Camp
been used in declarative sentences: “He does exercise.” At this 
point it typically expresses emphasis: “I do care about the fate of 
porcupines, I do!” 
■
■
Since the Renaissance, do has become a standard part of how we 
make negative statements and questions: “I like dark chocolate” 
becomes “I do not like dark chocolate.” But we don’t need do if 
there is another auxiliary there, modal or primary: “Ashley was not 
playing video games earlier.”
■
■
We also don’t need do if the main verb is to be: “Video games are 
not a good distraction.”
■
■
The auxiliary do is now a key part of how we make yes/no questions. 
During the Renaissance and earlier, you could flip the main verb 
and subject to make a question: “Know you the address?”
■
■
Now, if there is no other auxiliary present and the main verb is 
anything other than to be, we insert do and move it to the front: 
“Do you know the address?” Again, if there is another auxiliary verb 
there, we don’t need do: “Was Ashley playing video games earlier?” 
Changes
■
■
Two modals are in serious decline. The first, which won’t surprise 
you, is shall. While we’re talking about shall, let’s address a  
usage issue.
□
□
There is a rule out there about shall and will. For those 
who know it, the idea is that one expresses future and one 
obligation, and it varies by person. In first person, shall 
expresses the future and will expresses obligation.
□
□
The supposed rule continues: In the second and third person, 
will expresses future and shall expresses obligation. Has this 
ever been true? Not as far as we know. It was imposed by 
prescriptivists trying to create a logical system where there 
has never been one. But you can find it in Strunk and White’s 

84
Lecture 12  ▪  Shall We?
work. (For Americans, shall is more formal, sometimes used 
to express official, legal obligation. Lawyers can care a lot 
about this.)
■
■
The other modal in decline may surprise you: It’s must. Must has 
been in decline for much of the 20th century. But this is only the 
deontic must—the one that expresses obligation or necessity.
■
■
On reflection, must often sounds too strong: “I must run errands 
tonight after work” comes off as an overstatement. We’d usually 
say something more like, “I hafta run errands tonight after work.”
■
■
This example points to the rise of a new set of auxiliary verbs 
that are emerging, sometimes called semi-modals or emerging 
modals. They include hafta and gonna. Those aren’t standardized 
spellings, but they are how we say them. In fact, gonna and going 
to now mean different things: “I’m gonna run errands” versus “I am 
going to run errands.” 
■
■
We still recognize these are informal and don’t write them in 
formal prose, but their rise in American English is dramatic. These 
significant changes in the modal system are happening without a 
lot of fanfare or stigmatization (other than informality).
Ain’t
■
■
Before we finish this lecture on auxiliary verbs, we need to talk 
about ain’t. This must be the most notorious auxiliary verb out 
there. Dictionaries tend to treat it as nonstandard, and some 
people claim it isn’t a word.
■
■
What is wrong with ain’t? Mostly it is that style guides tell us there 
is something wrong with it. In the 18th century, a whole set of 
contractions were condemned: shouldn’t, can’t, won’t, and ain’t. 
All of these have redeemed themselves—they’re seen as informal, 
but not ignorant—except ain’t.

85
English Grammar Boot Camp
■
■
One key point: Almost all speakers of English use ain’t sometimes. 
Some speakers use it routinely as part of their grammar. Some use 
it for emphasis or in stock expressions— “Ain’t gonna happen”—to 
create an unpretentious or folksy tone. 
■
■
But the stigma is pretty strong when it is used as part of daily 
speech. An example: When he was at the University of Michigan, 
football coach Rich Rodriguez caught heat from a university regent 
for using ain’t in a speech in front of fans.
■
■
If think about it, “ain’t I?” seems more systematic than “aren’t I?” 
Why do we accept “aren’t I?” as standard when we do not accept 
“I aren’t?” This is one of the many examples of the ways in which 
what is considered standard is not necessarily more logical than 
other possibilities.
■
■
Defending the logic of ain’t this way is not an assertion that 
ain’t is standard usage—it clearly isn’t. The linguistic defense is 
meant instead to ask us to think critically about the arguments we 
make about standard and nonstandard usage, especially if we 
find ourselves making claims that one thing is more logical than 
another.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Consider these two sentences: “I must run errands after work” and “I 
have to run errands after work.” What differences in connotation do 
you see between the two sentences?
2.	 What is actually wrong with the auxiliary verb ain’t? The word is in 
standard dictionaries, so the answer cannot be “Ain’t ain’t in the 
dictionary.”

86
Lecture 13  ▪  Passive Voice Was Corrected
I
n 2009, The Chronicle of Higher Education published an essay called “50 
Years of Stupid Grammar Advice,” written by Geoff Pullum, a linguist at 
the University of Edinburgh. Pullum is not known for pulling his punches, 
especially when it comes to Strunk and White’s The Elements of Style. The 
essay was published a day after the 50th anniversary of that book. As the 
title makes clear, it was far from celebratory. Central to Pullum’s case is 
the treatment of the passive voice in Strunk and White. This entire lecture 
focuses on the passive voice, starting with Strunk and White. 
Active Voice
■
■
In The Elements of Style, Strunk and White give us the following 
advice:
	
The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the 
passive. … This rule does not, of course, mean that the writer 
should entirely discard the passive voice, which is frequently 
convenient and sometimes necessary. … The habitual use of 
the active voice, however, makes for forcible writing.
■
■
The leeway in this advice is important: The passive is sometimes 
convenient or necessary. As we’ll talk about, the passive is also 
highly conventionalized in scientific writing and other kinds of 
academic prose.
■
■
Where Strunk and White run into trouble is that their examples 
potentially could confuse people about what is passive and what 
is not. They provide four example sentences, and only one of 
Passive Voice 
Was Corrected
Lecture
13

87
English Grammar Boot Camp
them is actually passive. They introduce the sentences by saying 
they show “how a transitive verb in the active voice can improve a 
sentence.” Therefore, they have two topics in this advice: transitive 
verbs and active voice. But given that the whole section is about 
active voice, the transitive verb part can get lost. 
■
■
Here are the sentences:
1.	
There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground.
2.	
At dawn the crowing of a rooster could be heard.
3.	
The reason that he left college was that his health became 
impaired.
4.	
It was not long before she was very sorry that she had said 
what she had.
■
■
Only number 2 is passive: “At dawn the crowing of the rooster 
could be heard.” We can see one of the ways the passive voice 
can create stylistic stumbles: We don’t know who is doing the 
hearing. The passive here has inserted an unknown agent who 
is hearing the rooster, as opposed to just letting the rooster crow  
at dawn.
Defining Passivity
■
■
The active voice has a subject (the agent) acting upon an object. 
In the passive voice, the object gets fronted; the verb takes an 
auxiliary be and a past participle; and the subject can gain the 
word by (and becomes optional). 
□
□
Active voice: “Big Bird tickled Cookie Monster.”
□
□
Passive voice: “Cookie Monster was tickled by Big Bird.”
■
■
The point is that the recipient of the action becomes the subject, 
and the agent moves to end and becomes optional. The optionality 

88
Lecture 13  ▪  Passive Voice Was Corrected
of agent is very helpful when we don’t want to take responsibility: 
“Mistakes were made.”
■
■
It’s also helpful when we don’t know who was responsible: “My car 
was side-swiped in the parking lot.” 
To Be
■
■
What is happening in the other Strunk and White sentences 
if it is not the passive? What we’re seeing in all of these is the 
unnecessary insertion of to be, which weakens the clout of the 
verb and often adds extra words to the sentence. Let’s review 
each sentence in turn.
1.	
There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground.
■
■
This is just a to be sentence, and the be became necessary when 
we added the introductory there. One cleaner version of the same 
sentence would be, “Dead leaves covered the ground.” 
■
■
Next up:
3.	
The reason that he left college was that his health became 
impaired. 
■
■
This raises much of the same issue as number 1.“The reason that 
X is Y” introduces a to be verb. It is worth looking at whether, in 
context, we can just use a because construction instead: “He left 
college because his health became impaired.” This causes a shift 
in emphasis, from why he left college to the fact that he left.
■
■
Finally: 
4.	
It was not long before she was very sorry that she had said 
what she had.
■
■
“It was not long” could be become “soon” or “quickly,” but it is 
going to depend on what the writer wants to emphasize. “It was 

89
English Grammar Boot Camp
not long before she did X” is not exactly the same rhetorically as 
“She quickly did X.”
■
■
“She was very sorry” could become “She regretted.” This is really 
a word choice issue that involves verbs.
■
■
“… she had said what she had” could probably become “she said 
what she did” or “she regretted her words.” We need a little more 
context.
■
■
Putting all four of these sentences under pro-active-voice advice 
becomes potentially confusing, particularly in terms of equating all 
uses of to be as a main verb with the passive voice. That is Geoff 
Pullum’s concern. 
Better Advice
■
■
Better advice about the passive voice is to consider whether a 
passive construction is the most rhetorically effective choice. There 
are several reasons why it might be the best choice rhetorically.
■
■
The passive voice sometimes helps us maintain continuity 
between sentences. Consider these examples against each other:
□
□
“I have a new favorite mug. It was given to me by graduate 
students in the English and Education program.”
□
□
“I have a new favorite mug. Graduate students gave it to me.” 
■
■
The passive voice is gone in the second example, but there is a 
rough jump between the sentences.
■
■
Sometimes we don’t know the agent, as mentioned earlier, and 
the passive is really helpful here. Think about some of the terrible 
news we hear, where reporters need to be careful not to assume 
agents before we know: “Two people were shot last night.” 

90
Lecture 13  ▪  Passive Voice Was Corrected
■
■
Then there is scientific writing. The passive voice has become 
more conventionalized in this register than in many others. Think 
about the description of an experiment. Researchers are doing 
all the actions: taking the sample, putting it in a petri dish, adding 
whatever they’re adding, and so on. 
□
□
If we told it like a story, there would be people involved: “We 
took the sample and put it in the petri dish.” But that no longer 
sounds all that scientific.
□
□
Let’s try instead: “The sample was placed in the petri dish and 
water was added.” Now the human agents are invisible or at 
least very marginalized. The specimens take center stage and 
its sounds more objective.
■
■
There are a few other passive phrases common in academic 
writing beyond scientific writing that don’t typically get edited out 
as ineffective passives. Examples include “It could be argued” and 
“Other relevant factors must be considered.”
□
□
“It could be argued” is a way we introduce counterarguments 
as part of defending our own claims. Others may have argued 
these or they may be hypothetical, but it doesn’t actually 
matter who has argued them.
□
□
“[X] must be considered” can be a solution to the abstract we 
in academic writing. Take the sentence, “We must consider 
other relevant factors.” Who is we? The author(s)? The author 
and the readers? All researchers in the field? 
■
■
Pick your poison with the passive or the abstract we: Both of them 
present stylistic issues.
She Got Cheated
■
■
Let’s talk about a passive variant that doesn’t use be but instead 
uses get: “My car got side-swiped in the parking lot.” This setup 

91
English Grammar Boot Camp
feels much more colloquial. It’s not something we are going to do 
in formal writing.
■
■
In addition to being more colloquial, get passives may also carry 
two other differences in connotation.
1.	
They can reflect the responsibility of the grammatical subject: 
“Mario got fired” blames Mario more than “Mario was fired.”
2.	
They can reflect the attitude of the speaker toward the event, 
expressing adversity or sympathy: “My car got hit” expresses 
adversity. “She got cheated” expresses sympathy.
■
■
Get passives are older than you might guess. They first popped up 
in the mid- to late 17th century, although they were only sporadic 
until the late 18th century.
Passive Progressives
■
■
The 19th century witnessed the rise of the passive progressive 
in English. A passive progressive is a passive that is in 
progress, for example, “The house is being built.” This is now 
totally unremarkable, but people hated it when it came into the 
language. Here is George P. Marsh in Lectures on the English  
Language (1863):
	
… the clumsy and unidiomatic continuing present of the 
passive voice, which, originating not in the sound common 
sense of the people, but in the brain of some grammatical 
pretender, has widely spread, and threatens to establish itself 
as another solecism in addition to the many which our syntax 
already presents. The phrase ‘the house is being built,’ for ‘the 
house is building,’ is an awkward neologism, … an attempt 
at the artificial improvement of the language in a point which 
needed no amendment. 
■
■
David Booth’s 1830 work, An Analytical Dictionary of the English 
Language, argued, “For some time past, ‘the bridge is being built,’ 

92
﻿
‘the tunnel is being excavated,’  and other expressions of a like 
kind, have pained the eye and stunned the ear.”  (This was not in 
the 1805 edition.)
■
■
Before this construction arose, did people really say things like, 
“The house is building?” The answer is yes.
□
□
Jane Austen wrote in the novel Northanger Abbey: “The clock 
struck ten while the trunks were carrying down.”
□
□
Samuel Richardson wrote in the 1753 novel Sir Charles 
Grandison: “Tea was preparing. Sir Charles took his own seat 
next Lord L—, whom he set in to talk of Scotland.”
“The tea was preparing” now sounds 
funny to us, while “the tea is being 
prepared” sounded funny to people in 
the 19th century.

do you find them ineffective in your own writing or in other people’s 
writing?

Lecture 14  ▪  Only Adverbs
T
wo well-known company slogans have raised some grammatical 
hackles based on their use, or non-use, of adverbs. Subway has long 
used the slogan “Eat Fresh,” and in 1997 Apple rolled out “Think different.” 
Do we have grammatical problems here? This question is where we’ll start 
our lecture on adverbs. Then we’ll move on to consider other adverb topics, 
including intensifiers, tricky adverbs like hopefully, and flat adverbs.
Eat Fresh
■
■
“Eat Fresh” sounds like “eat right,” but “right” can clearly be an 
adverb as well as an adjective. This leaves us with the question of 
whether fresh can be an adverb. It’s usually an adjective: “The fish 
are fresh.”
■
■
But fresh can be an adverb: “The bread is baked fresh every day.” 
However, “Eat Fresh” works differently from “Baked Fresh” would. 
In the latter, fresh means recently. 
■
■
Is “Eat Fresh” a shortening of “eat fresh food?” Is this a 
nonstandard meaning of the adverb? In the end, we know what it 
means, and it has done its work: We notice the language.
Think Different
■
■
Apple’s “Think different” is another case. With standard grammar, 
the phrase would be “think differently”—but this could have a 
different meaning, too. It boils down to thinking in different ways 
versus think about different things.
Only Adverbs
Lecture
14

95
English Grammar Boot Camp
■
■
Different can be an adverb: “Carol didn’t know different until 
Eleanor told her.” So, in Apple’s slogan, is different an adjective 
or adverb? Are we to think about different kinds of computers or 
think differently about computers? This ad didn’t win an Emmy for 
nothing—the ambiguity works.
■
■
The ambiguity is possible because English has words that can be 
both adjectives and adverbs without changing form. We’ll come 
back to those “flat” adverbs.
Defining Adverbs
■
■
Adverbs are difficult to pin down and define. Merriam-Webster’s 
stab at it is this: “a word that describes a verb, an adjective, 
another adverb, or a sentence and that is often used to show time, 
manner, place, or degree.”
■
■
Unlike adjectives, which modify nouns, adverbs modify a whole 
range of things.
□
□
Modifying verbs: go quickly, protest peacefully.
□
□
Modifying adjectives: incredibly nice, very happy.
□
□
Modifying adverbs: really stupidly, ridiculously slowly.
□
□
Modifying a clause/sentence: Frankly, this situation with 
adverbs is a mess.
Only Some Confusion
■
■
The adverb only sometimes causes confusion. For example, 
some would nitpick “Anne only gave me two dollars” as having 
a different meaning from “Anne gave me only two dollars.” Bryan 
Garner called only “perhaps the most frequently misplaced word 
in English.” But if it happens so frequently, is it really misplaced? 
■
■
Garner is echoing a long-standing concern. Concern about only 
goes way back, as early as Bishop Lowth in 1763, who went after 

96
Lecture 14  ▪  Only Adverbs
“I only spoke three words” 
instead of “I spoke only 
three words.”
□
□
Why the objection? 
If the focus is that it 
was just three words, 
then only should come 
before three words.
□
□
If the focus is what 
you 
spoke 
(instead 
of wrote), then only 
should come before 
spoke.
□
□
If the focus is on you speaking (instead of others), then only 
can also come before spoke.
■
■
In speech, intonation would address much of this. Some later 
grammarians called Lowth hypercritical on this. English likes the 
only before the verb.
■
■
Do you have a problem with the following two sentences, the first 
written by James Thurber and the second by Samuel Johnson?
□
□
“We feel very badly about your only having one turkey.” 
□
□
“Every other author may aspire to praise; the lexicographer 
can only hope to escape reproach.” 
■
■
They really aren’t confusing, so are we quibbling over too fine a 
point? Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary of English Usage, which 
provides those two sentences, points out that in edited prose, the 
only does tend to appear before the phrase it modifies (something 
writers and editors are paying attention to).
Bishop Lowth

97
English Grammar Boot Camp
■
■
Here’s Thurber again: “Indeed, we spent so little time in bed most 
of us had only one child.” Is it worth editing for this? Maybe, at 
least some of the time. Here’s an example from editors of the 
AHD: “Dictators respect only force; they are not moved by words” 
versus “Dictators only respect force; they do not worship it.”
■
■
Let’s be clear that this is about disambiguating sentences that 
require it. In sum, the issue with only stems from the flexibility 
many adverbs show in terms of sentence placement—but not all 
of them show it.
Intensifiers
■
■
Intensifiers (a subset of adverbs) are less flexible: They appear 
before adjectives and adverbs. Examples include very happy, 
really fast, and truly superb.
■
■
Some attention recently came to the rise of super as an intensifier. 
The Corpus of Contemporary American English showed it was 
five times more frequent in 2010–2012 than in 1990–1994. “Super 
fast” is faster than “really fast,” but as super does this work more 
frequently, it will weaken.
■

New, slangier forms in American English include hella cool, 
uber cool, and wicked cool. British English has its own slangy 
intensifiers: flipping, chuffing, dead, blooming, and the mildly 
expletive bloody.
■
■
In formal writing, it is worth looking at all intensifiers and seeing if 
you need them:
□
□
“This finding is quite remarkable” can just be “This finding is 
remarkable.”
□
□
“The very dramatic decrease” can be “The dramatic decrease.”

Lecture 14  ▪  Only Adverbs
■
■
But this does not make the case that one should omit all adverbs. 
Some work to boost our claims, such as clearly, surely, and 
obviously. Equally importantly, adverbs can hedge our claims: 
Take perhaps, possibly, and arguably as examples.
Hopefully
■
■
Let’s discuss one other controversial adverb: hopefully as a 
sentence adverb. In the first couple of decades of the 20th century, 
the adverb hopefully started to be used to mean “I hope/we hope/it 
is hoped that ….” Speakers could say, “She smiled hopefully” and 
“Hopefully it won’t snow tomorrow.”
■
■
The sentence adverb use of hopefully gained in popularity. But 
in the 1960s, prescriptive commentators noticed this new use 
and condemned it, calling it overly ambiguous. Speakers have 
continued to use it prolifically as a sentence adverb, but starting 
in the 1960s, the sentence adverb use dropped precipitously in 
edited prose.
■
■
The AHD Usage Panel has been asked about this regularly. For 
a time, the panel was getting more prescriptive about it: In the 
1969 survey, 44 percent of the panel accepted the new usage of 
hopefully in “Hopefully, the treaty will be ratified.” But in 1999, only 
34 percent accepted it.
■
■
Now the tide has turned: In 2012, 63 percent accepted that 
sentence. Furthermore, 89 percent accepted mercifully as a 
sentence adverb: “Mercifully, the play was brief.”
■
■
Given how common the sentence adverb use of hopefully is in 
speech, it seems that whatever ambiguity there is, it is an ambiguity 
that speakers can tolerate. Human language is often ambiguous.

Flat Adverbs
■
■
To end this lecture, let’s come back full circle to flat adverbs. 
These are adverbs that have the same form as their adjective 
counterparts (examples: fast, up, down, and soon). For instance, 
take “I am a fast eater” and “I eat fast.”
■
■
One of the common markers of adverbs is the suffix –ly, which we 
can add to an adjective to make an adverb: quick becomes quickly. 
■
■
There are also a few adjectives that have that –ly ending, such as 
homely and comely. The suffix –ly has come to be used to form 
adverbs, which leaves an adjective like friendly in an awkward 
position: What is the adverb form? Friendlily? In a friendly way? 
■
■
There are, though, many adverbs with no distinctive –ly marking, 
such as soon, up, down, fast, hard, tight, and slow.
□
□
You might question whether slow is an adverb, since we 
have slowly. There is some controversy over “drive slow,” but 
historically there is no problem here.
□
□
There used to be a lot of flat adverbs in English because 
we used to mark adverbs with final –e. When that dropped 
off, slow was an adjective and an adverb. Shakespeare, in 
A Midsummer Night’s Dream, wrote: “But oh, me thinks, how 
slow / This old Moone wanes.”
■
■
What about “drive safe?” Historically, the adverb here has been 
safely. But why not let safe be a flat adverb? Merriam-Webster 
recognizes this, but the AHD and OED do not.
■
■
What about “play nice?” Nice historically has been an adverb, 
although now it would be considered nonstandard in sentences 
like “He sings really nice.” Again, Merriam-Webster recognizes 
nice as an adverb; the AHD does not.

100
Lecture 14  ▪  Only Adverbs
■
■
Some flat adverbs mean something different from the –ly form; for 
example, take “work hard” versus “hardly work.”
■
■
In some cases, the flat adverb will feel more informal or more 
playful, but that doesn’t make it ungrammatical. Remember: Flat 
adverbs have been around for centuries. They can make us 
think when they are used in creatively ambiguous ways, as in  
“Think different.”

T
he Microsoft Word grammar checker is arguably the most powerful 
prescriptive force in the world. It is on roughly 90 percent of word 
processing programs and it is on by default. Writers are much more likely 
to encounter the rules in that grammar checker than any usage guide. And 
when it puts a green squiggly line under something, it makes you wonder: 
What’s wrong with that? Frequently, it targets words such as and, like, and 
but—the subject of this lecture. We’ll review coordinating conjunctions 
and coordinators; subordinating conjunctions/subordinators; and then talk 
about the dramatic differences between speech and writing.

Lecture 15  ▪  No Ifs, Ands, or Buts
And
■
■
The grammar checker underlines And at the beginning of a 
sentence. This is a tipoff that there might be some problems 
with the rules in the grammar checker, because this rule simply 
isn’t a rule. It is a myth. Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary of English  
Usage summarizes:
	
Everybody agrees that it’s all right to begin a sentence with 
and, and nearly everybody admits to having been taught 
at some past time that the practice was wrong. Most of us 
think the prohibition goes back to our early school days. … 
[T]he prohibition is probably meant to correct the tendency 
of children to string together independent clauses or simple 
declarative sentences with ands.
■
■
There’s a reason kids have a tendency to use a lot of and’s (it’s the 
way we talk). As writers, they need to learn in less colloquial ways. 
But first, let’s think about the power of the MS Word grammar 
checker putting green squiggly lines under sentence-initial And 
and But. It sure makes it seem like there is something wrong  
with them. 
■
■
The software’s explanation is that it is informal to start a sentence 
that way: “Although sentences beginning with ‘and,’ ‘but,’ ‘or,’ or 
‘plus’ may be used informally, use the suggested replacement 
for a more formal or traditional tone.”  But not everyone makes 
a distinction between informal and wrong, and these aren’t even 
strictly informal: You can find sentence-initial And and But all over 
academic writing, in literature, and in the Bible: “And God said, 
‘Let there be light.’”
■
■
In informal polls, a good number of people revise their prose until 
the green squiggly line goes away, so this myth suddenly takes on 
new power.

Coordinators and Subordinators
■
■
This lecture will typically use the terminology coordinator and 
subordinator, but there is not unanimity in the linguistics community 
about terminology. Geoff Pullum and his co-author Rodney 
Huddleston have argued that we are getting the terminology wrong 
in their book the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language. 
■
■
They argue that we should think about many words that are 
typically called subordinating conjunctions as prepositions. But you 
will continue to encounter the terms coordinator and subordinator, 
as well as coordinating and subordinating conjunction, in most 
usage guides, grammar books, and dictionaries, so this lecture will 
use that categorization.
Coordinators
■
■
Coordinators (or coordinating conjunctions) like and and but join 
two units of equal status, for instance, two nouns or noun phrases. 
And is a prototypical coordinator and can coordinate words, 
phrases, and clauses. Examples are below.
□
□
Words: “apples and oranges”; “cease and desist”; “safe and 
sound.”
□
□
Phrases: “the young and the restless”; “reading books and 
writing essays.”
□
□
Clauses: “My phone rang, and I jumped.”
■
■
Some coordinators can also take more than two. The key point 
overall is that the coordinator occurs between the coordinates: “My 
phone rang and I jumped,” not “And I jumped, my phone rang.” 
■
■
The coordinator or can do all the things and can do: It can connect 
words, phrases, and clauses, and coordinate more than two items. 
In contrast, but can’t do all of that. It does less well with words and 
phrases: “I bought apples but oranges” doesn’t work, although we 
can say, “I bought apples but not oranges.” 

104
Lecture 15  ▪  No Ifs, Ands, or Buts
■
■
These more prototypical coordinators also can’t co-occur: “He 
loves chocolate and but it keeps him up at night” doesn’t work. 
However, you can make and and or co-occur with a slash: “He 
should eat chocolate earlier in the day and/or eat less chocolate.”
■
■
So and yet are sometimes called marginal coordinators. So 
can’t typically connect words or phrases—only clauses. We can 
say, “They were late, so they parked illegally right in front,” but 
not “They were late so frantic.” That said, so can connect verb 
phrases: “They were late, so drove fast.” So and yet can also 
combine with and: “They were late, and yet they stopped to get 
coffee on the way.”
The Word Plus
■
■
Some controversy surrounds the word plus. Let’s start with the 
well-known mathematical expression “two plus two equals four.” 
The –s in equals suggests that “two plus two” is singular. Some 
interpret this to mean plus is a preposition, so “plus two” is a 
prepositional phrase, which allows “two plus two” to be singular.
■
■
This is different from how and works in identical constructions: 
“Two and two are four.” Plus can also feel like a preposition in a 
sentence like this: “All school-aged children, plus an accompanying 
adult, can get in for free.”
■
■
The editors of the AHD reject the idea that plus is a preposition. 
They call plus here a conjunction and simply state that convention 
means that “two plus two” is treated as a singular.
■
■
Another controversy: Can you use plus to coordinate clauses or 
even to begin a sentence?
□
□
Using it to coordinate clauses is out there, but sounds 
informal, as in this example from Esquire: “The next woman, 
the forty-three-year-old, already has two kids, plus she’s 
recovering from thyroid cancer.”

105
English Grammar Boot Camp
□
□
Plus can also start a sentence, but not all critics like it. Its use 
is on the rise, though. In 2009, 67 percent of the AHD Usage 
Panel accepted the example, “He has a lot of personal charm. 
Plus, he knows what he’s doing.” 
Subordinating Conjunctions
■
■
Subordinating conjunctions connect clauses. In the process, they 
subordinate one to the other such that it can no longer stand alone 
but depends on the main clause. The prototypical example is if: 
“If it snows tomorrow, we probably won’t run.” We can reverse the 
clauses: “We probably won’t run if it snows tomorrow.” But “If it 
snows tomorrow” can’t stand on its own.
■
■
Note that fragments that begin with a subordinator are possible for 
rhetorical effect. For instance: “Researchers say we might be able 
to stave off climate change with a 40 percent reduction in global 
emissions. Unless the unexpected happens.” This short fragment 
can add emphasis.
■
■
Common subordinating conjunctions include although, because, 
while, when, after, before, since, unless, as if, in order that, and 
as soon as.
■
■
Most subordinating conjunctions are not controversial, but 
because and like have raised some hackles. 
□
□
The first concern: Can you begin a sentence with because? 
Yes, but if you start with because, you need to remember to 
add the independent clause.
□
□
The second concern about because regards the use of “the 
reason is because” rather than “the reason is that.” It is 
redundant, and is largely edited out of more formal writing, but 
you can still find it.

106
Lecture 15  ▪  No Ifs, Ands, or Buts
Like a Cigarette Should
■
■
The word like as a subordinating conjunction or subordinator 
has also caused controversy. The best example is this text from 
a Winston cigarette ad in the 1950s and 1960s: “Winston tastes 
good, like a cigarette should.”
■
■
Newspapers, magazines, and usage guides wanted like only to 
be a preposition. But like as a conjunction seems to go back to 
the 14th century. It shows up in Shakespeare and later Charles 
Dickens, George Eliot, John Keats, and Emily Bronte.
■
■
Criticism started as early as the 18th century. Noah Webster called 
the sentence “He thinks like you do” an “improper and vulgar” 
expression. By the 20th century, the consensus position was that it 
was wrong to use like to mean “as if” or “as.”
■
■
In the end, what do we make of the Winston cigarette ad? It did its 
job. It had people talking. If you want to use like as a subordinator, 
it’s your decision. You’re in good company if you decide to do so.
■
■
Is it OK to use like as a preposition? Yes, but some people seem 
to be scared of it because of the criticism of like as a subordinating 
conjunction. Like as a preposition expresses similarity: “Dave, 
like many other Ann Arborites, own a Prius.” It also can be used 
synonymously with such as: “Our friend’s daughter wants to go to 
a smaller school like Oberlin.”  
Slash
■
■
The word slash has begun to emerge as a new coordinator 
between clauses. Here’s an example in oral communication: “I 
really love that hot dog place on Liberty Street slash can we go 
there tomorrow?” 
■
■
It can express what one should do versus what one is going to do: 
“I’m going to go home and work on my paper slash take a nap.” 

107
English Grammar Boot Camp
■
■
It can also mean “following up on that.” Here’s an example from 
Twitter: “When is your next tour  slash  will you be making any 
pitstops in Dallas and/or OKC?”
■
■
Why write it out instead of using the symbol? As one teenager 
explained in a comment on a blog post regarding slash, the main 
reason for slash over / is “for it to be seen clearly and read as 
‘slash’ instead of ‘or.’ The two words now have a completely 
different meaning and function, even though they are both 
expressed using the same symbol.”
■
■
This is linguistic innovation under our very noses, and it’s 
innovation of the most interesting kind: It involves a function word.

Lecture 16  ▪  However to Use However
W
hen a writer is struggling to get an idea onto the page, sometimes 
people will recommend, “Just say it out loud and write that down” or 
“Just write it like you would say it.” That advice might help you get the idea 
out of your head initially, but in any formal register of writing, we should 
not write the way we speak. We are expected to use different vocabulary 
and different syntactic structures. One key example: Certain conjunctive 
adverbs are used much more heavily writing, especially in formal writing. 
Those are the focus of this lecture.
Therefore, Thus, and So On
■
■
According to the Corpus of Contemporary American English, 
therefore is far and away most common in academic writing. It 
occurs five times more often in academic writing than magazines 
and speech, and ten times more than it appears in newspapers or 
fiction.
■
■
Thus is an even more extreme case. It’s more than 30 times more 
common in academic writing than speech. In speech, we’re more 
likely to say something like so than we are to say thus or therefore. 
We might even just use and to show a consequence: “Rosie didn’t 
get enough sleep the night before and she didn’t do well on the 
final exam.”
■
■
We show more reliance on coordinators in speech than many 
conjunctive adverbs. Consequently is 25 times more common in 
academic writing than speech. Newspapers don’t like it as much. 
There, it’s only twice as common as it is in speech.

■
■
Moreover is 40 times more frequent in academic writing than 
speech. Even less academic-sounding conjunctive adverbs (or 
adverbials—phrases that function as adverbs) are more written 
than spoken. In addition is more than twice as common in 
newspapers and magazines than in speech. In academic writing, 
we seem to love it: It’s more than seven times more common in 
academic writing than in speech.
■
■
Some conjunctive adverbs pattern the other way. Two examples 
are anyway and then. So we do have some colloquial conjunctive 
adverbs.
Defining Conjunctive Adverbs
■
■
The most basic definition of conjunctive adverbs is that they are 
adverbs that conjoin two clauses. The clauses remain independent. 
They may be separate sentences or joined by a semi-colon. Take 
this example from The Atlantic (2015): “I feel depressed; therefore, 
my marriage is not working out” could instead be “I feel depressed. 
Therefore, my marriage is not working out.”
■
■
But a conjunctive adverb is different from a coordinator because 
it can move. A coordinator has to appear exactly between the two 
clauses,  joining them from that medial position: “I feel depressed; 
and my marriage is not working out.”
■
■
The conjunctive adverb can appear in the same place as and, but 
it can also move in the second clause:
□
□
“I feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.”
□
□
“I feel depressed; my marriage, therefore, is not working out.”
□
□
 “I feel depressed. My marriage is, therefore, not working out.”

110
Lecture 16  ▪  However to Use However
Usage Issues
■
■
Let’s now turn to some usage issues with conjunctive adverbs. 
We’ll start with however given how many problems this causes 
writers. However is one of the most common conjunctive adverbs 
in writing. Interestingly, it is on the decline overall in writing.
■
■
Students often want however to behave like but and just put a 
comma before it rather than a semicolon. This doesn’t happen 
to only students, either. The Harvard Review, for instance, 
announced the following on its submissions webpage: “Writers at 
Uses of Conjunctive Adverbs
■
■
Why do we get such a range of conjunctive adverbs in writing? 
They have many uses:
□
□
They can show with some specificity how two clauses are 
connected (versus the informal and and but). 
□
□
They can add to previous information (furthermore, in 
addition, moreover).
□
□
They 
can 
contrast 
(notwithstanding, 
nonetheless, 
nevertheless, in contrast).
□
□
They can illustrate (for example, for instance).
□
□
They can summarize (in short, in sum).
□
□
They can show sequence in time or logic (consequently, 
therefore, thus).
□
□
They can emphasize (certainly, indeed).

111
English Grammar Boot Camp
all stages of their careers are invited to apply, however, we can 
only publish a very small fraction of the material we receive.”
■
■
Usage guides would tell you that you need a semicolon before 
however, because however is a conjunctive adverb, not a 
coordinator. That would make the Harvard Review example: 
“Writers at all stages of their careers are invited to apply; however, 
we can only publish a very small fraction of the material we receive.”
■
■
The question is: Can however be a coordinator? If enough people 
think it is, and treat it like it is, can it become one? Fundamentally, 
however continues to act like a conjunctive adverb because it can 
move around within the clause. For example: “We can publish, 
however, only a very small fraction of the material we receive.”
■
■
Another consideration: Does however tend to occur more often 
initially, which would make it look and act more like a coordinator? 
Research using the Corpus of Contemporary American English 
and Corpus of Historical American English shows that clause-
initial however has risen dramatically over the past 150 years. 
In other words, it has become more and more common to start a 
sentence with however.
■
■
As however becomes more and more common at the beginning 
of a sentence, it looks more like a coordinator. That could help 
explain why so many people treat however as a coordinator. We 
are left with the question of whether we can accept that however 
might be working as both a conjunctive adverb and a coordinator.
■
■
There is a history of prescription against using however at the 
beginning of the sentence. But this restriction is fading: Editors 
aren’t editing however from the starts of sentences.
■
■
As the restriction on clause-initial however fades, usage guides 
strictly police the use of semicolons before however when used to 
connect two clauses within one sentence.

112
Lecture 16  ▪  However to Use However
Introducing Importance
■
■
Let’s now turn to how you should introduce a sentence that you 
want to signal is more important than what precedes it. Should you 
begin, “More important,” or “More importantly?” 
■
■
“Even more important” and “Even more importantly” both express 
the writer’s stance toward the assertion. The writer believes it is 
more important.
■
■
Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary of English Usage traces debate 
over more important vs. more importantly back to 1968 with some 
commentators condemning the adverbial phrase and others, 
including William Safire, concluding that both were acceptable.
■
■
More importantly rose dramatically from 1960. In 2000, it passed 
more important in Google Books. We’re seeing exactly the same 
thing happen with more notable versus more notably (the latter is 
now more common). More strikingly is on the rise, although more 
striking remains more common.
Firstly and Thusly
■
■
There is one conjunctive adverb that some argue shouldn’t even 
be a word: firstly. It has long been subject of debate. In the 19th 
century, it was getting criticized openly. H.W. Fowler, in the early 
20th century, as part of his defense of firstly, quoted Thomas De 
Quincey, who wrote, “I detest your ridiculous and most pedantic 
neologism of firstly.”
■
■
Thomas Lounsbury wrote about the debate about firstly in 
Harper’s in 1905. He quoted the English poet and writer Walter 
Savage Landor as saying, “Firstly is not English.” However, he 
also pointed out that letter writers such as Lady Mary Mortley 
Montagu and Lord Byron both used firstly.
■
■
Let’s be clear that firstly is a word. H.W. Fowler decisively 
dismissed the whole controversy about it, calling it “one of the 
harmless pedantries.” But there may be reasons not to use it.

113
English Grammar Boot Camp
■
■
With respect to firstly, Strunk and White prefer the numbers without 
the –ly: first, second, third. These are shorter. A more persuasive 
reason is that while firstly, secondly, and thirdly may sound OK, it 
starts to get awkward around fifthly and sixthly.
■
■
Interestingly, a Google Books search shows firstly on the rise, but 
it is dwarfed by comparison with sentence-initial First. When in 
doubt, stick with first, but know that firstly is a word.
■
■
The word thusly is another controversial case. This word was 
created in the 1800s, seemingly by humorists as a signal of 
uneducated usage. It has gotten picked up in more educated 
usage, with the meaning “in such a way.” Here is an example from 
Newsweek (2009): “President Martin Van Buren described the 
economic crisis of 1837 in Britain and America thusly ….”
■
■
But in 2002 usage survey, the AHD Usage Panel was given this 
sentence: “His letter to the editor ended thusly: ‘It is time to stop 
fooling ourselves.’” Eighty-six percent of the panel rejected it, so 
thusly is an adverb to be wary of.
Questions to Consider
1.	 What kinds of words do you identify more with formal writing than with 
speech?
2.	 In your opinion, why do so many writers get confused about how to 
punctuate however when it occurs between clauses?

114
Lecture 17  ▪  Squirrels and Prepositions
T
his lecture is all about prepositions. We’ll start by unpacking the 
concern about different than versus different from, touching on the 
idiomatic nature of prepositions in English. Then we’ll take a step back to 
nail down just what prepositions are. From there, we’ll cover issues like 
between versus among and toward versus towards. Then we’ll end by 
looking at a fascinating change with the word because, along with why new 
prepositions are rare.
Different From or Than?
■
■
One question on prepositions is: Is different than or different 
from correct? A common sentiment is that the adjective different 
does not set up a comparison on a scale the way that more than 
or less than do, so than is inappropriate. With different, we are 
distinguishing one thing from another thing. 
■
■
But the argument that because “X differs from Y,” it should be 
different from isn’t completely persuasive either: Prepositions 
don’t hold across parts of speech. We sympathize with others but 
express sympathy for them.
■
■
One fundamental issue at play here is that prepositions in English 
are not a totally rational bunch of words; instead, they are highly 
idiomatic. Why is it due to instead of due by? Why is it in addition 
instead of on addition?
■
■
Different than initially came under criticism long ago. Robert Baker 
in Reflections on the English Language (1770) called different 
Squirrels and Prepositions

115

The advice that prepositions cover “everything a 
squirrel can do with respect to a tree” runs into 
trouble with sentences like, “The squirrel was until 
the tree.”

116
Lecture 17  ▪  Squirrels and Prepositions
than “not English.” This didn’t pick up steam until the end of the 
19th century, when different than came to be widely critiqued.
■
■
It remains a construction many editors in the U.S. will correct 
toward different from, but not all the time: Since the mid-20th 
century, people have been opting for different than when it is 
followed by a clause, not a noun phrase. 
■
■
For example, take this sentence: “Social norms for Generation 
Xers are different than they were for Millennials.” We can’t use 
from here, because it would create: “Social norms for Generation 
Xers are different from they were for Millennials.”
■
■
Different from is still often seen as the most formal and standard in 
written American English, but there is nothing wrong with different 
than, and it is the standard alternative when there is a clause 
following the adjective different. 
Changing Attitudes
■
■
The way we deal with the word sympathy shows that attitudes 
about which preposition is the correct one change over time. We 
now say “sympathize with” but “feel sympathy for.” 
■
■
But in the 19th century, essayist Thomas De Quincy called 
sympathy for a “monstrous barbarism.” Prepositions may be little 
words, but people care about them.
Defining Prepositions
■
■
Prepositions are notoriously hard to define and yet English 
grammar is highly dependent on them. A very common definition 
from Margaret Shertzer in The Elements of Grammar is this: “A 
preposition is a connecting word that shows the relation of a noun 
or pronoun to some other word in a sentence.” 
■
■
Strunk and White define a preposition as “A word that relates its 
object (a noun, pronoun, or –ing verb form) to another word in  
the sentence.”

117
English Grammar Boot Camp
■
■
The Riverside Handbook puts it this way: “Prepositions show 
relationships between words, often relationships over time and 
space.” They’re always followed by a noun phrase (noun, pronoun, 
or gerund) and show relationships.
■
■
One grammar guide tells us that a preposition isn’t a preposition 
unless it has that related noun or pronoun as its object. This is 
the standard way of looking at prepositions, and you’ll find it in 
pretty much every dictionary and every grammar book except one: 
Rodney Huddleston and Geoff Pullum’s Cambridge Grammar of 
the English Language. 
■
■
As noted, prepositions often show relationships in terms of time 
(examples: before, after) and location (examples: over, through, 
inside). They can also show comparison and other distinctions, 
for example, unlike, except, and excluding. And they can 
focus our attention (example: regarding) or set up opposition  
(example: versus).
■
■
Prepositions can also do grammatical work similar to the work that 
inflectional endings carry; for example, we have the possessive of: 
“The name of the ship.” This brings up an interesting usage issue: 
double possessives.
□
□
Is it “a friend of Kate’s” or “a friend of Kate”? It seems much 
more colloquial to say “a friend of Kate’s,” but it is doubly 
marked, so is it wrong?
□
□
Some would relegate it to informal contexts, but you can find it 
in more formal ones. And there are a few double possessives 
that are mandatory, for example, “a friend of mine” instead of 
a “friend of me.” 
■
■
Interestingly, some single possessive alternatives are problematic 
and not all double possessives are idiomatic. As an example of the 
former, we can’t say, “a bicycle of Kate” to indicate possession. As 
an example of the latter, we have double possessives that don’t 

118
Lecture 17  ▪  Squirrels and Prepositions
sound right: We can say “the name of the ship” but not “the name 
of the ship’s.”
Between, Among, Toward, and Towards
■
■
Let’s now turn to two other usage issues: between vs. among, 
and toward vs. towards. The rule about when to use between and 
when to use among can seem straightforward: Use between for 
two things and among for three or more things.
■
■
But here’s another way to think about it: Use between when 
talking about two things, and between or among when talking 
about three or more things depending on whether you’re talking 
about them individually, or in terms of relationships in pairs 
(between), or whether you are talking about all the things and their  
relationship collectively.
■
■
According to this principle, you could say, “I am choosing between 
the salmon, tuna, and swordfish for dinner.” That works if you’re 
looking at each fish individually. You need to know that style 
guides don’t consistently disagree with this. 
■
■
Although etymologically, between goes back to mean “by two,” 
it has been used for more than two things since Old English. 
According to the blog of the Oxford dictionaries, it should be, 
“A treaty was drawn up between France, Germany, Italy, and 
Greece,” but, “There was agreement among members of NATO.”
■
■
Strunk and White are on the same page: Usually when there 
are more than two, we should use among, but when it is about 
individual relationships, we should use between.
■
■
Several commentators on this question point out the difference 
between “Anne ran among the cars” and “Anne ran between the 
cars.” The first suggests Anne weaving in and out; the second has 
Anne running with lines of cars on both sides.

Regarding toward and towards: The bottom line here is that both 
are standard. Towards is more British and toward more American.
Because Prepositions
■
■
Throughout this lecture, we’ve covered changes in preposition 
usage, but we haven’t covered making new prepositions—and 
that’s because it almost never happens. Historically, occasionally a 
borrowing such as during came in from Old French. Every once in 
a while, a participle will become a preposition (e.g., considering).
■
■
In this context, linguists are very interested in what is happening 
with because, and they have been debating how to describe this 
new or expanded usage. Here’s an example: “I can’t diet because 
chocolate.” It can also occur with adjective and interjections: 
“because tired” and “because argh.”
■
■
Can a preposition do that? Geoff Pullum says yes, but the linguist 
blogger Gretchen McCulloch says no. Pullum says that because has 
always been a preposition, rather than a subordinating conjunction. 
He argues that we need to recognize that prepositions can be 
followed by nouns, clauses, prepositional phrases, or nothing.
■
■
Because has traditionally taken a clause or a prepositional phrase 
with of: “because of the cold.” It is now expanding to take nouns 
and pronouns, and possibly adjectives as well.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Prepositions are notoriously idiomatic (e.g., due to not due by; in 
addition not on addition). Come up with two examples of expressions 
with prepositions where it is difficult to explain the logic.
2.	 Did you learn that between should be used for two items and among 
for three or more items? If so, try to imagine instances where you 
would want to use between for three or more items.

English Grammar Boot Camp
A
n old joke about prepositions goes like this: A freshman on Harvard 
campus asks a senior, “Excuse me, can you tell me where the library is 
at?” The senior replies haughtily, “At Harvard, we do not end a sentence with 
a preposition.” The first-year student tries again: “Can you tell me where the 
library is at, jerk?” The rule about not ending a sentence with a preposition 
is widely known. We’re going to spend this entire lecture on it because it is 
so well known and widely enforced, and yet there is confusion about when it 
should apply and whether it is a worthwhile rule to follow at all.
The Joke
■
■
Let’s start with what is going on in the joke. The question “Where 
is the library at?” ends in a preposition, but concern about this 
construction is not really about the preposition. It’s more about the 
redundancy of “Where … at.” The at is not stranded.
■
■
This sentence, however, has a stranded preposition: “Which library 
are we meeting at?” The preposition gets stranded when the noun 
moves up to the front of the clause. There are two times when that 
fronting happens: wh-questions and relative clauses.
■
■
Wh-questions involve interrogative pronouns: who, what, where, 
when, why, and how. That interrogative pronoun gets put at 
the front of the question, no matter what function it plays in the 
sentence: “What did you eat for dinner?”
■
■
If the interrogative pronoun is the object of a preposition, it can still 
front, with or without the preposition. Let’s look at an example, first 
with the question in a form where the interrogative pronoun is still 
Stranded Prepositions
Lecture
18

122
Lecture 18  ▪  Stranded Prepositions
positioned as the object of the preposition: “You cooked dinner for 
whom?” can become “Whom did you cook dinner for?”
■
■
Both of these are completely grammatical in English in the 
descriptive sense; the question is whether we find it more pleasing 
to front the preposition too. The term in linguistics for this is pied-
piping, which we covered in Lecture 7. 
■
■
The same kind of fronting happens in relative clauses with which. 
For example: “That is the house that I was telling you about” can 
also be “That is the house about which I was telling you.” Both of 
these sentences are fully grammatical, although the second one 
sounds very formal.
The Rule’s Origins
■
■
We know that there is a rule that we shouldn’t strand a preposition 
at the end of a sentence. Where does that rule come from? 
John Dryden (who also proposed a language academy in the 
1660s) is usually cited as the first to notice and disparage the  
stranded preposition.
□
□
In 1672 he picked out for critique the writing of Ben Jonson. 
Here’s the line from Jonson: “The bodies that those souls 
were frighted from.”
□
□
Dryden commented: “The Preposition in the end of the 
sentence; a common fault with him, and which I have but 
lately observ’d in my own writings.” He subsequently not only 
avoided stranded prepositions in his own prose but went back 
and revised earlier work that contained stranded prepositions.
■
■
Interestingly, if we go back to Ben Jonson’s 1640 grammar, we 
see that he very descriptively notes that prepositions “follow 
sometimes the Nounes they are coupled with.” Joseph Priestley 
says very much the same thing in 1761, in his important grammar 
Rudiments of English Grammar:

123
English Grammar Boot Camp
	
Prepositions generally precede their substantives; as He went 
to London: but sometimes a verb more elegantly parts them; 
as This is the thing with which I am pleased; or This is the 
thing which I am pleased with.
■
■
So in 1761, Priestly is allowing for stylistic variation, saying 
that sometimes it is more elegant to strand the preposition. But 
Priestley’s view lost to Bishop Lowth’s opinion on the construction, 
written down and disseminated in English Grammar of 1762: 
	
The Preposition is often separated from the Relative which it 
governs, and joined to the Verb at the end of the Sentence, 
or of some member of it: as, “Horace is an author, whom I 
am much delighted with.” “The world is too well bred to shock 
authors with a truth, which generally their booksellers are the 
first that inform them of.” [Pope, Preface to his Poems] This is 
an Idiom, which our language is strongly inclined to; it prevails 
in common conversation, and suits very well with the familiar 
style in writing; but the placing of a Preposition before the 
Relative is more graceful, as well as more perspicuous, and 
agrees much better with the solemn and elevated Style.
■
■
Notice that it is not yet a rule per se. Lowth first playfully strands a 
preposition in the sentence “This is an Idiom, which our language 
is strongly inclined to.” He then opines that it is more graceful, 
solemn, and elevated to pied-pipe the preposition.
■
■
From what we can tell, this opinion started to influence the usage 
of authors, even as some grammarians argued that sometimes 
the language was better served by stranding the preposition 
at the end of the sentence. The final nail that secured this rule 
is probably that it got picked up in Lindley Murray’s best-selling 
grammar of 1795.
■
■
Over time, the prescription became less about what was elegant 
and more about what was “bad usage.” But in the 1920s, H.W. 
Fowler, in A Dictionary of Modern English Usage, tried to make the 

124
Lecture 18  ▪  Stranded Prepositions
conversation again about elegance rather than about hard-and-
fast rules:
	
If it were not presumptuous, after that, to offer advice, the 
advice would be this: Follow no arbitrary rule, but remember 
that there are often two or more possible arrangements 
between which a choice should be consciously made.
■
■
You’ll notice that Fowler actually chooses to pied-pipe a preposition 
in that last sentence (“two or more possible arrangements between 
which a choice should be consciously made”). That was a good 
choice over “two or more possible arrangements which a choice 
should be consciously made between.”
■
■
Fowler is giving us very good advice: Make stylistic choices and 
enjoy the freedom in English grammar that allows us to do so.
■
■
The third and fourth editions of Strunk and White’s guide advise 
that it’s about having a good ear:
	
Years ago, students were warned not to end a sentence with 
a preposition; time, of course, has softened that rigid decree. 
Not only is the preposition acceptable at the end, sometimes 
it is more effective in that spot than anywhere else. “A 
clawhammer, not an ax, was the tool he murdered her with.” 
This is preferable to “A claw hammer, not an ax, was the tool 
with which he murdered her.” Why? Because it sounds more 
violent, more like murder. A matter of ear. 
■
■
But Microsoft Word’s grammar checker can’t be that flexible. 
When the box pops up, it advises: “Although a preposition at the 
end of a sentence may be used informally, consider deleting or 
repositioning the preposition for a more formal or traditional tone.” 
This gives some flexibility, but it suggests that it is somehow wrong 
in formal writing.

Churchill
■
■
There is a story out there that Winston Churchill rejected the “do 
not end a sentence with a preposition” rule. The story goes that 
Churchill said something like, “That is a silly rule up with which I 
will no put.” 
■
■
Ben Zimmer, executive editor of Vocabulary.com and columnist for 
The Wall Street Journal, has done some digging, though, and we 
don’t have evidence that Churchill said this. The first instance of 
the quote is in The Strand Magazine in 1942. Churchill contributed 
to the magazine, but here’s the quote, per the Wall Street Journal:
	
When a memorandum passed round a certain Government 
department, one young pedant scribbled a postscript drawing 
attention to the fact that the sentence ended with a preposition, 
which caused the original writer to circulate another 
memorandum complaining that the anonymous postscript was 
“offensive impertinence, up with which I will not put.” 
After recapping a situation, a 
newsperson might utter the 
informal-sounding sentence, 
“That’s where we’re at.”

126
Lecture 18  ▪  Stranded Prepositions
■
■
In 1948, Sir Ernest Gowers wrote in Plain Words: “It is said that 
Mr. Winston Churchill once made this marginal comment against a 
sentence that clumsily avoided a prepositional ending: ‘This is the 
sort of English up with which I will not put.’” Zimmer has found it in 
multiple newspapers. 
■
■
What makes the supposed Churchill quote funny is that he is 
playing with a phrasal verb, not a prepositional phrase. A phrasal 
verb is a two- or three-part verb with a main verb and one or two 
participles; call up and put up with are examples.
■
■
These verbs don’t like to have the particle fronted because it 
doesn’t work like a preposition: “With that I will not put up” and “Up 
with that I will not put” are clunky. “That is something I will not put 
up with” works.
■
■
Remember that some of the words that look like prepositions at 
the end of sentences are not functioning as prepositions. Follow 
your judgment about when it works well—even elegantly—to 
strand a preposition.

Questions to Consider
1.	 In what contexts might it sound better to strand the preposition (e.g., 
“That was the decision for which we were waiting” versus “That was 
the decision we were waiting for”)?
2.	 Imagine you are listening to live radio coverage of a hurricane. The 
reporter has some information about the damage but is awaiting more 
information. She says, “That’s where we’re at right now.” Would you 
consider that standard usage? Why or why not?

I
f we heard the sentence, “Clinging to the side of the aquarium, Mary saw 
a starfish,” we would probably assume it was the starfish clinging to the 
side of the aquarium. But if we look closely at the structure of the sentence, 
the participial phrase “Clinging to the side of the aquarium” modifies Mary. 
This falls under the assumption that participles and other modifiers sit next 
to what they modify. To correct it, we’d switch to, “Clinging to the side of the 
aquarium, the starfish stared at Mary,” or “Mary saw the starfish clinging to 
the side of the aquarium.” This issue seems straightforward enough, but 
there are some twists, so this lecture explores “danglers” (as Bryan Garner 
calls them) in depth.
The Dangers of Danglers
Lecture
19

128
Lecture 19  ▪  The Dangers of Danglers
Terminology
■
■
Many of us have learned terms like dangling modifiers or dangling 
participles. Participles are subcategory of modifiers and often the 
issue. Here’s a dangler with a past participle: “Parked behind a 
row of tall bushes, the speeding teenagers didn’t see the cop until 
it was too late.”
■
■
We’re interested in the participles that are acting adjectivally. In 
addition to present and past participles, the modifier could also be 
a prepositional phrase: “As a teacher of writing, my students often 
tell me about traumatic experiences they have had with grammar 
in high school.”
■
■
When it comes to danglers, there can be a useful distinction 
between dangling modifiers versus misplaced/wrongly attached 
modifiers. 
□
□
Misplaced/wrongly attached modifiers happen when the 
noun that the participle is supposed to modify is there in the 
sentence, just not next to the modifier: “Plummeting from the 
sky, Cindy watched the punted football drop right in between 
her outstretched hands.”
□
□
Dangling modifiers are dangling because there is no noun 
in the sentence for them to modify: “Glancing through the 
document, the typos jumped off the page.”
■
■
There are some danglers that have become accepted in 
more formal writing. With these, the participle has come to be 
accepted as a preposition or disguised conjunction. An example: 
“Considering the danger, she is lucky to have gotten out alive.” 
(She’s not considering the danger—we are.) Such participial 
phrases are now understood to function adverbially, modifying the 
whole sentence.

129
English Grammar Boot Camp
Ends of Sentences
■
■
All our examples have had the participial phrase at the beginning 
of the sentence. Garner points out that editors are often more 
lenient about these phrases at the end of sentences. His example: 
“Sarah stepped to the door, looking for her friend.”
■
■
It is hard to call this unacceptable—it’s very clear Sarah is doing 
both actions. Garner calls it a coordinating participle, as it implies 
that this verb happened next: “Sarah stepped to the door and 
looked for her friend.” 
■
■
Another example: “My colleague wrote me an email after our 
meeting, asking if he had unintentionally insulted me by joking 
about marathon runners.” As you can see, danglers are not a 
totally cut and dried issue. 
■
■
Does our grammar, in the descriptive sense, allow participial 
phrases (and other modifiers) to be separated from the noun? 
Clearly, the answer is yes. As Garner notes, we are more forgiving 
when the participial phrase is at the end of the sentence. 
■
■
We remain stricter when it is at the beginning, and there are good 
reasons to avoid ambiguity in writing—but it’s not certain that these 
sentences with danglers are mostly ungrammatical. There’s a key 
difference between speech and writing here. These sentences 
are usually easy to parse in speech—we go with logic. In writing, 
we need to be more careful because we cannot clarify ambiguity 
caused by a dangler.
Present but Ambiguous
■
■
A modifier can technically be in the right place and still be 
ambiguous in a way that merits rewriting. Here’s an example from 
the New Jersey Administrative Code:
	
Property owners and occupants of dwellings suffering damage 
from squirrel, raccoon, opossum, skunk, weasel, woodchuck, 
gray fox, red fox and coyote, or their agents designated in 

130
Lecture 19  ▪  The Dangers of Danglers
writing, may control these animals by lawful procedures at 
any time subject to State law and local ordinances.
■
■
The ambiguity: Are we talking about all these animals or their 
agents designated in writing? When you look closely at this 
sentence, though, the phrase “or their agents designated in 
writing” is not dangling or misplaced. There is a legitimate reading 
of the sentence where it stands as an alternative to “property 
owners and occupants of dwellings suffering damage.” Yet this 
sentence desperately needs an editor.
■
■
The length of the prepositional phrase “from squirrel, raccoon, …. 
and coyote” stretches readers’ working memory capacity, loading 
a lot of information in between the subject noun phrase (“property 
owners and occupants of dwellings”) and the appositive phrase 
(“or their agents designated in writing”). 
■
■
There are some other potential issues. For example, the and 
between the red fox and the coyote, along with the omission of 
an Oxford comma after red fox, potentially raise the question of 
whether all these critters need to be working in cahoots for the 
regulation to apply, whether it is only the red fox and coyote 
who are working together, or whether all of the animals can be 
independent, free-agent damage doers. Lawyers think about 
these kinds of things. In addition, the their in “or their agents” is 
ambiguous, even if grammatically unproblematic. 
■
■
Here we see why written language, and especially legal language, 
can require a high level of attention to modifiers and commas.
Absolute Constructions
■
■
One construction can look like a dangling participle, but it is 
instead something called an absolute construction. One of the 
very common ones is, “Weather permitting, the race will start at 
8:00 am.” The whole phrase functions adverbially to say, “If the 
weather permits.”

131
English Grammar Boot Camp
■
■
These will often have a noun and participle. It could be a present 
participle, as in “this being the case” or “the sun having risen.” Or it 
could be a past participle: “all things considered.” 
■
■
Being that has been controversial among grammarians: When is 
it OK because it is in an absolute construction, and when it is not 
OK because it means because or since? Here it is as an absolute 
construction: “The review criticized the book for taking a more 
philosophical than empirical approach, the implication being that 
the author strayed too far from the data.”
■
■
Now take the example, “Being that it’s a holiday, I let the kids sleep 
late.” Seventy-one percent of the AHD Usage Panel rejected it 
as unacceptable.  And a full 83 percent rejected this one: “Being 
that he has never attended law school, it’s strange that he’s giving 
legal advice.” Clearly, being that meaning because or since is not 
held in high regard right now, at least in more formal contexts.
■
■
Let’s return for a moment to absolute constructions with being that. 
One emerging pattern in student writing is the being that absolute 
construction becoming its own sentence.
■
■
Ryan McCarty has been looking into this and has found it in 
published writing too, although it is criticized. Here’s an example 
from a 2009 issue of the Journal of Instructional Psychology: 
	
There are a plethora of reasons to be given for the importance 
of the social studies. A major reason  being  that  threats  to 
humanity exist if nations continually spend excessive amounts 
of money on the military as well as plan attacks against  
each other.
■
■
Clearly we have a fragment here. We could replace being with is 
and correct the issue. In speech it’s not an issue: We wouldn’t be 
able to hear whether this was a new sentence or an em-dash, and 
in the latter case it would be completely fine.

132
Lecture 19  ▪  The Dangers of Danglers
■
■
In writing, absolute constructions (when they are not fragments) 
have their benefits. They can be a nice way to vary one’s sentence 
structure: “The sun having risen, we jumped into the lake” versus 
“The sun rose and we jumped into the lake.” Just beware of 
making them their own sentence in formal writing.
Questions to Consider
1.	 Consider this sentence: “Reviewing the grades at the end of the term, 
it became clear that the curve needed to be adjusted.” Would you 
correct this sentence if you had your editor hat on? Why or why not?
2.	 Consider this sentence: “Being that it’s a holiday, I let the kids sleep 
late.” Do you have any concerns about the grammar?

I
t’s time to put together a lot of the grammatical pieces we’ve been talking 
about into the bigger picture of how we present information in our writing. 
This lecture will provide a few fundamental pieces of advice about how 
to help your readers follow your ideas by helping your readers follow 
you from sentence to sentence. You’re going to see some real payoff for 
understanding how sentences work in terms of subjects and predicates, 
conjunctive adverbs and relative clauses, and the like. There are some 
wonderfully concrete ways that you can help make your prose clearer.
Flow versus Choppiness
■
■
Flow is not a very useful word to describe writing, although we 
use it all the time. The opposite is choppy. But what are we saying 
with choppy? Somehow we’re having trouble seeing connections 
between sentences. Somehow our expectations as readers are 
not being met. We’re reading along and expecting one thing and 
we get something else, and so our head metaphorically jerks up. 
■
■
This raises the key questions: How can you know what your 
readers are expecting? And how can you help them navigate  
your prose?
■
■
One answer is using conjunctive adverbs or adverb phrases. 
Conjunctive adverbs are words like therefore, nonetheless, and 
consequently; and adverb phrases include in addition and in sum. 
These help us understand how one sentence is connected to  
the next.

Choppy Paragraph
Lecture

134
Lecture 20  ▪  Navigating the Choppy Paragraph
■
■
That said, there is a more fundamental principle at work in terms 
of how we can present information sentence to sentence in a way 
that makes sense to readers. It is often called the known-new 
contract or given-new contract.
■
■
Here’s the fundamental idea: As readers, we expect information 
we know to precede new information. Grammatically, known 
information will be in the subject position and new information 
in the predicate. Or, known information will be an introductory 
phrase, perhaps an adverbial like given that.
■
■
Examples from real writing will help here. Here’s a very 
straightforward one from Boys in the Boat by Daniel James Brown: 
“Since early in the eighteenth century, the London watermen 
had also made a sport of racing their dories in impromptu 
competitions. They were rough-and-tumble events.” The first 
sentence introduces the impromptu competitions in the predicate. 
The second sentence then tells us about the competitions.
■
■
Now let’s look at a longer passage, this one from The Immortal 
Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot. Here we’re going to 
look at five consecutive sentences as context: HeLa cells are the 
cells that were derived from cervical cancer cells extracted from 
Henrietta Lacks in 1951—they were the first human cells grown in 
a lab that were “immortal”.
	
Researchers had long believed that human cells contained 
forty-eight chromosomes, the threads of DNA inside cells 
that contain all of our genetic information. But chromosomes 
clumped together, making it impossible to get an accurate 
count. Then, in 1953, a geneticist in Texas accidentally mixed 
the wrong liquid with HeLa and a few other cells, and it turned 
out to be a fortunate mistake. The chromosomes inside the 
cells swelled and spread out, and for the first time, scientists 
could see each of them clearly. The accidental discovery 
was the first of several developments that would allow two 

135
English Grammar Boot Camp
researchers from Spain and Sweden to discover that normal 
human cells have forty-six chromosomes.
■
■
Let’s now unpack how the information is presented in these five 
sentences:
□
□
First sentence: Researchers believed there were 48 
chromosomes in human cells; the chromosomes contain 
genetic information.
□
□
Second sentence: But the chromosomes clumped together, 
so they were hard to count. (Chromosomes have been 
introduced and explained in the first sentence, and now we 
learn something new.)
□
□
Third sentence: “Then, in 1953,” prepares us to meet a 
geneticist, who accidentally mixes the wrong liquid in with 
some cells.
□
□
Fourth sentence: We were just talking about the cells and 
their chromosomes, so we’re prepared to learn something 
new about them: They swelled and spread out.
□
□
Fifth sentence: This sentence sums up what we’ve just 
been talking about and then tells us the implications of that 
accidental discovery: Two researchers from Spain and 
Sweden discovered that normal human cells have only  
46 chromosomes.
■
■
The passage is easy to follow, in part because our expectations 
are met as we go in terms of how information will be presented 
to us. We don’t have to work too hard as readers in terms of how 
the information is structured, so we can focus on the story the 
sentences are telling.

136
﻿
A Detailed Example
■
■
As an example of choppiness, let’s take these sentences, modified 
from an article in The Atlantic called “To Remember a Lecture 
Better, Take Notes by Hand.”
	
A new study—conducted by Mueller and Oppenheimer—
finds that people remember lectures better when they’ve 
taken handwritten notes, rather than typed ones. Adolescents 
these days suffer from short attention spans. The educational 
system must respond to new technologies. Perhaps it is time 
to bring back the pencil.
■
■
This passage is choppy because it’s been rewritten to make 
it choppy. It jumps from a study to adolescents to educational 
reform. Here’s what the real article does:
	
A new study—conducted by Mueller and Oppenheimer—finds 
that people remember lectures better when they’ve taken 
handwritten notes, rather than typed ones. What’s more, 

137
English Grammar Boot Camp
knowing how and why typed notes can be bad doesn’t seem 
to improve their quality. Even if you warn  laptop-notetakers 
ahead of time, it doesn’t make a difference. For some tasks, it 
seems, handwriting’s just better.
■
■
The first sentence introduces the study and overall topic. The 
second sentence picks up the idea of typed notes (which was 
introduced in the predicate of the first sentence). The third 
sentence is still on this topic, introducing laptop-notetakers. 
■
■
The next paragraph in the article then brings in the question 
of education. It starts by referring back to the study (known 
information) and then introduces the new idea that this is relevant 
to education: “The study comes at a ripe time for questions 
about laptop use in class. Educators still debate whether to allow 
students to bring their laptops into the classroom.”
■
■
The second sentence here can then go from class to educators 
and use that to introduce the question of whether students should 
be allowed to use laptops in class.
Three Basic Patterns
■
■
Three templates exist for helping readers along. These will seem 
very basic, but that is because they are boiled-down maps; these 
three templates sometimes underlie very long, complex, and 
beautiful sentences.
■
■
The first template is the constant template (i.e., we’re keeping 
the subject constant). An example: “The study shows that taking 
notes by hand helps students retain more information. The study 
further suggests that even when you tell laptop notetakers not to 
take notes verbatim, they still struggle to take effective notes.” The 
subject is literally repeated.
■
■
The second template is the derived template. The subject leads to 
one thing, and then a derivation of the subject leads to another. An 

138
Lecture 20  ▪  Navigating the Choppy Paragraph
example: “The time demands on student-athletes can be intense. 
For example, voluntary practices may not always feel voluntary.”
■
■
The third template is the chained template. One thing leads to 
another, which leads to another, which leads to another. Here’s an 
invented sentence to go with the earlier Boys in the Boat example:
	
Since early in the eighteenth century, the London watermen 
had also made a sport of racing their dories in impromptu 
competitions. They were rough-and-tumble events. This 
informal exuberance could lead to heated debates about 
cheating and who had actually won. 
■
■
That example moves progressively: Competitions gets picked 
up in the second sentence and we learn they were rough-and-
tumble events. Then, the third sentence captures that rough-and-
tumbleness in the subject and tells us more about that.
■
■
Chaining can work well, but be careful because it means your 
paragraph can end fairly far away from where it started. 
Scientific Writing
■
■
With this information about the known-new contract in our pocket, 
let’s turn to a few principles proposed by George Gopen and 
Judith Swan in a wonderful article called “The Science of Scientific 
Writing.” 
■
■
Their premise is that scientific writing doesn’t need to be as hard 
to understand as it often is—it is as much or more about the 
prose than about the complexity of the concepts themselves. As 
they write, “complexity of thought need not lead to impenetrability  
of expression.” 
■
■
Gopen and Swan reiterate fundamental principles about known/
new information: Put in stress position the new information, which 
is usually in the predicate. Place the person/thing whose “story” 
the sentence is telling in topic position. (This can be a reason to 

139
English Grammar Boot Camp
use the passive.) Place old information in the topic position to link 
back and contextualize forward. In general, provide context for the 
reader before asking the reader to consider new things.
■
■
It is a very humanizing article as it takes apart scientific writing. 
For example, they quote this passage:
	
Large earthquakes along a given fault segment do not occur 
at random intervals because it takes time to accumulate the 
strain energy for the rupture. The rates at which tectonic 
plates move and accumulate strain at their boundaries are 
approximately uniform. Therefore, in first approximation, one 
may expect that large ruptures of the same fault segment will 
occur at approximately constant time intervals. If subsequent 
mainshocks have different amounts of slip across fault, then 
the recurrence time may vary, and the basic idea of periodic 
mainshocks must be modified. For great plate boundary 
ruptures the length and slip often vary by a factor of 2. Along 
the southern segment of the San Andreas fault the recurrence 
interval is 145 years with variation of several decades.
■
■
They conclude: “This is the kind of passage that in subtle ways 
can make readers feel badly about themselves.” Each sentence 
in isolation is fine. But look at how the topics jump around: large 
earthquakes, rates at which tectonic plates move, one (“one may 
expect”), subsequent mainshocks, great plate boundary ruptures, 
and the southern segment of the San Andreas fault.
■
■
The theme—recurrence intervals—is there but not usefully in 
the topic position. There is lots of great information here, but the 
reader has to work very hard to follow along. Technical material 
can be presented more clearly, and that should be our goal  
as writers. 
Closing Advice
■
■
One other good piece of advice: Beware of putting too much 
information in between the subject and the verb. This happens 

140
Lecture 20  ▪  Navigating the Choppy Paragraph
with modifiers on the subject’s noun phrase. An example: “The 
study, which looked at what happens when people take notes with 
laptops (with or without access to the Internet) versus when they 
take notes by hand, found that people with pencils retained more 
of the information.” Our brains have trouble holding the sentence 
open waiting for the verb.
■
■
Finally, when is a sentence too long? When there are too many 
pieces of information that need stress or emphasis. In other 
words, look at whether you’re trying to introduce a lot of new 
information in one sentence. If you are, revise. Readers will find 
new information more easily if it is in its own sentence, in the “new 
information” position.

Questions to Consider
1.	 How would you explain what it means that a piece of writing is choppy?
2.	 How can the complexity of our ideas interfere with the clarity of our prose?

141

T
he grammar of conversation can be quite different from the grammar 
of formal writing. And when we study grammar, we often pull our 
sentences from literature or academic writing or newspapers in order to 
understand their structure. But the rules we learn from examples like that 
often don’t translate to how conversations work. In this lecture, we’ll talk 
about some fundamental differences between speech and writing, and then 
how discourse markers function.
Speech Patterns
■
■
It’s surprising how often we speak in incomplete sentences and 
run-ons, and how many other little words there are in there: um, 
well, like, you know, I mean, and yeah. Obviously this is less true 
of very formal speech—especially if it is scripted.
■
■
Below is an example of classroom talk, from a teacher in a high 
school English classroom, talking about Hero and Claudio from 
Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing:
	
Right I mean she—OK so she’s still dead but she didn’t 
betray him, and if he didn’t feel so bad, he didn’t feel so bad 
about her being dead when she betrayed him but now, now 
when the h— like, when it’s his honor, right, i— when he’s at 
fault now he’s like oh I feel really bad about her being dead, 
actually, thought about it a little bit more. Right?
■
■
We see here false starts: “she—OK so she’s still dead” and “now 
when the h— like, when it’s his honor.” There are effects of real-
time processing: The speaker often starts with one grammatical 
What Part of 
Speech is Um?
Lecture
21

142
Lecture 21  ▪  What Part of Speech is Um?
structure and then needs to do something different. We also can 
see how hard it is to find sentence breaks sometimes in spoken 
language. The above example is potentially all one sentence.
■
■
When the teacher quotes speech, she puts in a speech discourse 
marker. Quoting Claudio, she says, “now he’s like oh I feel really 
bad about her being dead.” The oh is like an opening quotation 
mark (because we don’t get quotation marks when we speak).
■
■
This bit of real speech, because it is a monologue, is actually pretty 
orderly compared with conversation where people are interrupting 
each other, taking over the conversational floor, or even just back-
channeling. People might also be simultaneously watching TV or 
texting, or having more than one conversation at once.
The Grammar of Conversation
■
■
Genuine conversation can look chaotic, but it has a grammar 
of its own. Of course, spoken utterances are filled with nouns, 
verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, as well as prepositions, pronouns, 
determiners, and the like. And we obey all the rules we have 
talked about for creating descriptively grammatical utterances 
(except when we make false starts or get tangled up in our syntax 
because we change course in the middle of an utterance). 
■
■
We might not, though, follow some of the rules that govern stylistic 
niceties such as distinguishing who/whom, avoiding “equally as 
important,” or catching a “There’s three reasons for this.” Speech is 
also filled with words like um and well—and for younger speakers, 
lots and lots of like.
Involved and Informational Discourse
■
■
To talk about some differences in the grammar of conversation 
and writing, it is useful to focus on the distinction between involved 
discourse and informational discourse, as described by linguistics 
expert Doug Biber.

143
English Grammar Boot Camp
□
□
The purpose of involved discourse is to build relationships. 
This is the type of discourse most associated with classroom 
settings. It involves lots of first- and second-person pronouns. 
Discourse markers (like well and um) are frequent. There is a 
heavy reliance on to be. Contractions are also frequent.
□
□
Informational discourse is used to deliver information. This 
type of discourse packs a lot of information into nouns rather 
than letting full clauses carry the weight (e.g., “when the 
company started” becomes “at the company’s founding”). 
Information discourse is also characterized by longer words 
and attributive adjectives. 
■
■
The notion of a high type/token ratio captures the much higher 
rate of variation in word choice in more formal writing. Each word 
is a type, and each token is a time it appears in the discourse. In 
writing, we often use a word only once or twice because we’ve 
learned to avoid repetition. But in speech, we repeat a lot because 
this is actually helpful for the people processing in real time.
■
■
The differences captured by the distinction between involved and 
informational discourse align to some extent with the different 
processing demands of speaking and writing. 
□
□
In speech, we benefit from repetition and coordination when 
processing in real time. In writing, we can go back and look 
again at a more complex syntactic structure.
□
□
This is part of why listening to someone read a speech, 
especially, if it wasn’t written to be read aloud, can be hard to 
follow. Speech can also tolerate more ambiguity, which is part 
of what makes writing hard.
Discourse Markers
■
■
Discourse markers are the little words at the margins (the 
beginning and end) that help organize discourse and manage 
listeners’ expectations. People sometimes want to talk about 

144
Lecture 21  ▪  What Part of Speech is Um?
them as meaningless, but in fact they do a lot of work for us in 
conversation. They don’t carry meaning the way a noun does, but 
they are meaningful for us as speakers and listeners.
■
■
Discourse markers include words such as so, now, well, uh, um, 
oh, and, but, and like, and lexicalized phrases such as you know 
and I mean. They are optional, but can be very helpful as long as 
we don’t overuse them.
■
■
Discourse markers are not just the disfluencies that people often 
think they are. Certainly they are sometimes fillers (like um), but 
even that serves a purpose: holding the floor. Discourse markers 
also do two other important things: 
□
□
They can be like signposts in a conversation. They can signal 
to listeners how to understand an utterance in relation to the 
utterances that precede and follow it. 
□
□
They can help the listener understand the utterance in the 
context of the relationship being negotiated between the 
speaker and the listener.
■
■
Think about the grammatical choices we make in terms of how to 
phrase a request, depending on who we’re talking to: “Save that 
seat for me” versus “Could you please save that seat for me?” 
versus “I’m sorry to bother you, but is there any way you could 
save that seat for me?” Discourse markers help with this; for 
example, we can signal ending a turn: “I’m not sure what I think 
about that, so ….” 
■
■
Let’s look at five specific discourse markers to see how they work. 
1.	
So shows effects or logical consequences. It can also 
introduce summaries or rephrasings: “So, the main point here 
is….” And in an extended narrative, it can introduce different 
parts of the story: “So I get to the building ….”

145
English Grammar Boot Camp
2.	
Now can signal a topic shift (like a paragraph marker): “Now, 
let’s talk about how determiners differ from adjectives.” Like 
so, it can also flag that something important is coming: “Now, 
this raises a fundamental question ….”
3.	
Well, according to work by Andreas Jucker at the University 
of Zurich, can also introduce a new topic, but one of its most 
interesting functions is prefacing a dispreferred response: 
“Well, I can see what you’re saying, but ….”
4.	
Um functions in much the same way as well.
5.	
Oh does a surprising amount of work. One function is 
indicating surprise; for example, consider: “Thank you” versus 
“Oh, thank you.” Oh can also preface a suddenly remembered 
question: “Oh, did you ask about when the road will reopen?” 
It can also help if we need to repair: “Oh, it is on Liberty Street, 
not Washington.”
When someone wants to signal the 
end of their turn, they might end a 
sentence with “I mean…” and trail off.

146
Lecture 21  ▪  What Part of Speech is Um?
■
■
Look at two more phrases that help us navigate relationships with 
our listeners.
1.	
You know (or y’know): This can conclude an argument or 
trail off at the end of a turn. It can also introduce a story. 
Importantly, the phrase can establish solidarity with an 
audience. Here’s an example from an interview of Ken 
Wheaton (editor of Advertising Age) on CBS This Morning in 
2015: “We’ll pretend to like PBS but we really want to go, you 
know, go home and watch junk on TV.” 
2.	
I mean can signal an upcoming adjustment: “I would never 
do that. I mean, I’m not saying that I wouldn’t think about it.” 
It can also help minimize the authority of the speaker, which 
speakers often choose to do to make their audience feel more 
equal. Compare “I think that would work” with “I mean, I think 
that would work.”
And, Like
■
■
And is both a conjunction and a discourse marker depending 
on what it is doing. Here is and as a discourse marker in a 
conversation between two people:
□
□
Person 1: “I started watching the new season of Frankie and 
Grace last night.”
□
□
Person 2: “And is it good?”
■
■
And is building from one utterance to the next, to suggest a 
connection. 
■
■
Like, too, can be a discourse marker. It can be a filler, or it can be 
a focuser: “It was, like, awesome.”
■
■
Some younger speakers use it a lot, which can be distracting. 
That’s true of any discourse marker. If you’re concerned that 

147
English Grammar Boot Camp
you’re overusing like or any other discourse marker, awareness is 
the first step. A countermeasure: Record yourself.

Lecture 22  ▪  Duck, Duck, Comma, and Duck
I
n both American English and British English, according to a study in 1987 
by linguist Charles Meyer, the comma and the period are neck-in-neck 
for the most common punctuation mark (40–45 percent each), with comma 
winning by a nose. In terms of which punctuation marks people are most 
confused about, the comma, the semicolon, and apostrophe are at the 
top of the list, with the dash not far behind. We’ll focus on the comma, 
semicolon, colon, and dash in this lecture: the punctuation marks that 
structure the sentence. 
Early Punctuation
■
■
Punctuation is a key part of how we organize language on the 
page. Sentences end with periods, question marks, or exclamation 
points. They do not end with commas, colons, semicolons, or 
dashes. Slashes now have a very little role to play other than in 
things like and/or, but that has not always been the case.
■
■
The earliest manuscripts in Roman antiquity typically did not have 
punctuation; readers often were familiar with the texts, and this 
way scribes did not prejudice the reading. The earliest punctuation 
marks that were added to texts were guides to phrasing.
■
■
It is a modern notion that punctuation should align with 
grammatical structure as opposed to spoken phrasing (and not 
everyone agrees on this). For English, the printing press started to 
stabilize punctuation after it was introduced in 1476, but there was 
lots of variation in the Renaissance.
Duck, Duck, 
Comma, and Duck
Lecture
22

149
English Grammar Boot Camp
■
■
The following example shows a few of the differences in 
punctuation. It’s a couple of lines from a story, “How the Witch 
Served a Fellow in an Alehouse,” which was published in 1606 
in a pamphlet called The Most Cruell and Bloody Murder. Here 
is the passage: “At last the witch got so much time to cal to him, 
Doest thou heare good friend (quoth she?) What sayst thou ill face 
(quoth he?)”
■
■
The dialogue is framed by “quoth she/he” in parentheses. You’ll 
notice that the question mark is in the “wrong place”: in the 
parenthetical as opposed to at the end of the question. Then 
there is no period after “(quoth she?)” or “(quote he?)” to end  
the sentence.
■
■
The rise of prescriptive grammars in the 18th century started to set 
down stricter standards for how punctuation should and shouldn’t 
be used—but if you read 18th and 19th century texts, you’ll still see 
punctuation used in ways we wouldn’t see as standard now. 
■
■
Often that is because there is more punctuation than we’re now 
accustomed to. Let’s consider the first sentence of Jane Austen’s 
Pride and Prejudice: “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a 
single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a 
wife.” We now wouldn’t have either of those commas, especially 
the second one.
Modern Rules: Commas
■
■
The 20th century witnessed some reigning in of punctuation. We’ll 
focus on the modern rules for the rest of this lecture. Let’s start 
with rules about commas.
■
■
Commas are designed to mark or set off phrases or groups of 
words shorter than a sentence. There are a few set rules for how 
to use commas and then some variation.
■
■
Here are five times when commas are now recommended if not 
required:

150
﻿

151
English Grammar Boot Camp
1.	
Between two full clauses coordinated by a coordinator like 
or, and, or but: “He played tennis for four hours yesterday, 
and his back and arm muscles are letting him know about  
that today.”
2.	
Commas around a non-restrictive clause. This is how we 
show it is nonrestrictive and it does correspond to a pause 
in speech. As an example: “Paul’s sister, who is an attorney 
in NYC, paid him a surprise visit.” Here Paul has just one 
sister. But let’s imagine Paul has more than one. Then we’d 
have: “Paul’s sister who is an attorney in NYC paid him a  
surprise visit.”
3.	
Commas around any kind of parenthetical phrase: “The U.S. 
Constitution, as discussed earlier, outlines ….”
4.	
Commas after introductory subordinate clauses: “After the 
mayor met with citizens from the neighborhood, she approved 
a zoning change that would allow a high-rise hotel.”
5.	
Commas in a list between items: “nouns, verbs, and adverbs” 
or “nouns, verbs and adverbs.” 
■
■
That last category raises the question of the Oxford comma, which 
occurs after the penultimate item. With attempts to streamline or 
minimize punctuation in the 20th century, the Oxford comma was 
taken out in some style guides. Today, it’s typically a question of 
“house style” or personal style.
■
■
People can have strikingly strong feelings about the Oxford 
comma. Some argue it should be required because otherwise 
there can be ambiguity. 
Commas, Consistency, and Aesthetics
■
■
The question of consistency comes up with constructions where a 
comma is variable, in particular with introductory adverbials. Most 
everyone wants a comma if the adverbial gets long: “In addition 

152
Lecture 22  ▪  Duck, Duck, Comma, and Duck
to higher pay for all employees, ….” The word however always 
requires commas around it. 
■
■
Part of each of our decisions about commas is going to depend 
on whether we prefer lightly or more heavily punctuated text. The 
difference between “Hi Eileen” and “Hi, Eileen” is really about 
aesthetics, not correctness.
■
■
But for all this, there is one thing a comma cannot do: connect two 
clauses without a coordinator—at least according to most style 
guides for formal English. This is the comma splice. An example: 
“Erica was the queen of the prom, she dazzled everyone.”
Modern Rules: Semicolons
■
■
Many people have strong feelings about the semicolon. Some, like 
Kurt Vonnegut and George Orwell, think it should never be used. 
Others, like Charles Dickens and David Crystal, find it nuanced 
and sophisticated.
■
■
The 18th century witnessed the explosion of the semicolon. 
Lindley Murray described it as the punctuation mark that divided 
a compound sentence into two or more parts, “not so closely 
connected as those which are separated by a comma, nor yet so 
little depend on each other, as those which are distinguished by  
a colon.”
■
■
There was some heavy use of semi-colons in 20th century. For 
instance, take these lines from Evelyn Waugh’s 1945 novel 
Brideshead Revisited:
	
“I have been here before,” I said; I had been there before; first 
with Sebastian more than twenty years ago on a cloudless 
day in June, when the ditches were white with fool’s parsley 
and meadowsweet and the air heavy with all the scents 
of summer; it was a day of peculiar splendour such as our 
climate affords once or twice a year, when leaf and flower 
and bird and sun-lit stone and shadow seem all to proclaim 

153
English Grammar Boot Camp
the glory of God; and though I had been there so often, in so 
many moods, it was to that first visit that my heart returned on 
this, my latest.
■
■
Today, semicolons have two main uses:
1.	
Joining two independent clauses that have a close semantic 
relationship. There could be no conjunctive adverb or 
something like nevertheless, or thus, or put differently. The 
semicolon shows readers these ideas are tightly linked.
2.	
In a list where items are long and have punctuation within 
them. For example: “I went to Vegas with my friend Auden, 
who had never been to Vegas; my sister, who loves Vegas in 
a way I don’t understand; and my mom, who just wanted to 
spend time with us.”
Modern Rules: Colons
■
■
The colon, when introduced at the end of the 16th century, was 
used to mark a pause longer than a comma or semicolon but 
shorter than a period.
■
■
One apt description of the colon is that it urges the reader 
forward, foreshadowing that what is to come is going to explain or 
exemplify what you have just read. Colons are now used before 
lists, examples, definitions, or other explanatory material.
■
■
The colon and semicolon barely figure in the written English of 
texting: Their formality makes them a bad choice rhetorically and 
aesthetically. But they do serve an important role in the non-emoji 
smiley and winking faces: :) and ;).
Modern Rules: Dashes
■
■
Now we turn to the dash. Can one misuse the dash? Yes, but it’s 
hard. Overuse is more common. The dash can serve the same 
function as a comma, semi-colon, or colon, but with a different, 

154
Lecture 22  ▪  Duck, Duck, Comma, and Duck
less formal connotation. It often suggests an interruption or a new 
thought/afterthought.
■
■
Here’s a nice example of dash usage from an article by Marko 
Dragojevic and Howard Giles published in Human Communication 
Research in 2016: “Two experiments examined the effects 
of processing fluency—that is, the ease with which speech is 
processed—on language attitudes toward native- and foreign-
accented speech.”
■
■
Sometimes no other punctuation mark will quite do the trick. One 
instance is with an introductory list followed by a clause to explain: 
“X, Y, Z—all these help explain ….”
■
■
Another instance is with an added phrase (not a clause) that 
wouldn’t do well with a comma. Here’s an example from George 
Eliot’s Middlemarch: “He had done nothing exceptional in 
marrying—nothing but what society sanctions, and considers an 
occasion for wreaths and bouquets.”
Formal and Informal Writing
■
■
As we think about punctuation in formal writing, remember Bishop 
Lowth in the 18th century: “The doctrine of punctuation must needs 
be very imperfect: few precise rules can be given, which will 
hold without exception in all cases; but much must be left to the 
judgement and taste of the writer”
■
■
There are guidelines, but the very creativity of human language 
and of good prose will require some flexibility and some application 
of good sense to punctuation. Also recognize that punctuation in 
different registers will function differently. 
■
■
There is a sense out there that texting is ruining our sense of 
punctuation. But that isn’t necessarily the case—it’s more that the 
rules of punctuation in texting need to do something different.

155
English Grammar Boot Camp
■
■
Think about early punctuation, which tried to capture oral delivery. 
In texting, punctuation is used to try to capture tone, facial 
expression, and other parts of context.
■
■
Emoticons and emoji do this work, as do shorthands like jk, and lol. 
And punctuation marks have been repurposed: The exclamation 
mark shows agreement but not necessarily lots of enthusiasm 
unless there are several. The period is serious if not angry. The 
ellipsis is skeptical or invites a response. And the unmarked/
generic punctuation choice is no punctuation at all.

Lecture 23  ▪  Its/It’s Confusing
T
he apostrophe is perhaps the most unstable punctuation mark in English. 
Yet we will sometimes judge others severely based on how they use 
the apostrophe: poking fun at grocers’ apostrophes in apple’s or deciding 
not to go on a date with someone because their online profile misuses its/
it’s. Many of the rules for apostrophes are extremely idiosyncratic, as we’ll 
see in this lecture. We’ll also learn about how contractions work, the deal 
with plurals, and what the future holds for apostrophes.
The Apostrophe’s History
■
■
The word apostrophe is a French borrowing, coming into English 
in the 16th century. It has historically been used for contractions, 
and eventually it expanded to possessives (both nouns and 
pronouns) and plurals.
■
■
It was then reigned in as part of standardization. Now the 
apostrophe is used for possessives of nouns and contractions 
(and a few plurals, just to make things confusing). It is this double 
use of the apostrophe for possessive and contractions that makes 
its/it’s tricky, as we’ll discuss.
Contractions and Possessives
■
■
Contractions are largely straightforward: When two words are 
smashed together, letters and/or sounds get left out, and the 
apostrophe represents that. Cannot becomes can’t; do not 
becomes don’t; I am becomes I’m.
■
■
We can also use the apostrophe to show that we have left off a 
letter or sound at the beginning or end of words: ‘tis, runnin’.
Its/It’s Confusing
Lecture

157

■
■
Possessives in English are now marked with a final s, both in 
the singular and plural, and the only thing that distinguishes 
them is where the apostrophe goes. In the singular to make 
the possessive, take the noun and add –’s. For instance, cat  
becomes cat’s.
■
■
It is understandable that we want to extend the pattern to 
pronouns, but pronouns work differently. The first-person singular 
doesn’t use –’s at all: The possessive is my or mine. For all others, 
there’s a change of form in possessive, and then we add –s for 
pronouns: you becomes yours; we becomes ours. 
■
■
It is the only pronoun that stays the same in the possessive and 
adds –s (becoming its), so it is no wonder that speakers are more 
inclined to want to use an apostrophe. It acts more like a noun 
than a pronoun in how it makes the possessive. Before you judge 
someone’s its/it’s error, pause and consider what judgment you’re 
about to make.
■
■
Now let’s deal with the nouns where the possessive gets tricky: 
nouns that end in –s. Do you add another –s with an apostrophe 
or just an apostrophe?
■
■
Some style guides say to let pronunciation guide your choice: If 
there is an added syllable in the possessive, add another –s to 
represent the new syllable; if not, just add an apostrophe.
■
■
But other style guides, including Strunk and White’s, advise that 
we should always make the possessive of singular nouns by 
adding –’s. That is, always except for a selection of ancient proper 
names ending in –us, –es or –is. They cite Jesus, Moses, and Isis 
(the goddess.) According to them, it is always Moses’ and Jesus’—
or you can take the escape hatch and go with “the laws of Moses.”
■
■
Other guides only mention Moses and Jesus, but not always other 
ancient figures. Bryan Garner also defers to this tradition, making 
an exception (to use just the final apostrophe) for classical names 

158
Lecture 23  ▪  Its/It’s Confusing
like Jesus and Aristophanes, along with names of companies and 
countries like General Motors and the United States. Most people 
would prefer the look of “General Motors’ reputation” over “General 
Motors’s reputation.”
■
■
We often get out of the possessive issue with the United States 
because we use it as a noun modifier; for instance, we might say 
“The United States economy” or “the U.S. military.” Or we can 
rephrase with an of-construction: “the president of the U.S.” But in 
the end, most people prefer the aesthetics of United States’ over 
United States’s.
■
■
Then we have plural nouns that end in –s. Let’s imagine that there 
is a family with the last name Jones. This family has one car, and 
we want to refer to that car. Is it the Jones’ car or the Joneses’ car? 
Most guides say Joneses’. An escape hatch would be the Jones 
family’s car.
■
■
Two other issues come up with the possessive. One we already 
talked about in the lecture on prepositions: the double possessive 
in “a friend of Kate’s.”
■
■
The other issue: How does the apostrophe distribute when there 
are two owners? Let’s imagine two people, Kate and Dean. 
Together, Kate and Dean own two cars. Should we talk about “Kate 
and Dean’s cars” or “Kate’s and Dean’s cars?” In other words, 
does the apostrophe distribute through the conjoined phrase that 
describes the owners (“Kate and Dean”) or can you have just one 
apostrophe that encompasses the whole thing?
■
■
Arguably, there is a distinction in meaning. If “Kate and Dean” is a 
unit (for instance, they’re married) and together they own the car, 
then let’s use just one apostrophe: “Kate and Dean’s car.” Then we 
can use two apostrophes to show that there are two cars, which 
Kate and Dean own independently: “Kate’s and Dean’s cars.”

Plurals
■
■
We’re sometimes allowed to use the apostrophe to mark plurals, 
specifically with numbers and letters. As an example regarding 
decades, 1960s and 1960’s both appear, depending on the 
source. It’s more common to omit the apostrophe, but The New 
York Times still uses it.
■
■
If we’re talking about plural individual letters, we can say “three 
As” or “three A’s.” But lowercase letters require an apostrophe; this 
creates “three a’s” rather than “three as.” 
■
■
We use the apostrophe to create a plural when we are referring to 
multiple instances of a word. An example: “There are four the’s in 
the passage.”
The Future of the Apostrophe
■
■
What is the future of the apostrophe? It’s hard to say, but we can 
speculate.
□
□
John Richards, a retired copy editor and reporter, in Boston, 
England has founded the Apostrophe Protection Society.
□
□
There is also the Kill the Apostrophe website, which calls 
them redundant, wasteful, and snobbish.
■
■
The apostrophe probably will not die entirely (although a couple of 
linguists have suggested this). It is likely that its use will diminish.
■
■
One factor is the increasing use of noun modifiers in English such 
that nouns appearing before other nouns are assumed to modify 
the noun afterwards, often through possession. Take, for example, 
“the book’s cover” versus “the book cover.” This leads to an overall 
reduction in the possessive marker –s.
■
■
Some nonstandard dialects of English already do zero possession 
with expressions. For example, the lyrics of Beyonce’s 2016 
song “Formation” include features of African American English 

160
﻿
throughout, including the zero possessive “I like my baby hair” (a 
defense of her daughter wearing her hair in an afro).
■
■
The history of English is the history of the loss of inflectional 
endings, and it is not surprising to see the possessive –s drop in 
varieties of English. 
■
■
We’re also seeing the loss of the apostrophe, while the –s remains, 
in some street signs and names of well-known geographical spots. 
In the U.K., the Birmingham City Council banned apostrophes 
from street signs in 2009. Cambridge did the same for any new 
street names in 2014, but then quickly reversed the decision after 
a public uproar.
■
■
The U.S. Board on Geographic Names has a policy of removing 
apostrophes from titles proposed for towns, mountains, caves, and 
so on. Examples include Pikes Peak (which lost its apostrophe in 
1891) and Harpers Ferry. Exceptions include Martha’s Vineyard 
(which got it back in 1933), Clark’s Mountain (apostrophe granted 
in 2002), and Ike’s Point (apostrophe granted in 1944).

161
English Grammar Boot Camp
■
■
People have experimented with apostrophes before. George 
Bernard Shaw used apostrophes in contractions only when there 
would be ambiguity without them (for instance, I’ll versus Ill). He 
explained, “There is not the faintest reason for persisting in the 
ugly and silly trick of peppering pages with these uncouth bacilli.” 
■
■
We probably overestimate the ambiguity that would happen 
without apostrophes. People say she’ll will be shell and he’ll will 
become hell. In context, though, sentences like “Shell be here at 
9:00” probably would not be ambiguous if we were used to seeing 
Shell this way.
■
■
But there is concern that if we aren’t careful, chaos will reign in the 
written language. John Richards posed the sentence: “Residents’ 
refuse to be placed in bins.” If you remove the apostrophe, it 
becomes: “Residents refuse to be placed in bins.” The lack of 
apostrophe creates ambiguity. But such sentences are hard to find 
or construct. This isn’t to say we should get rid of apostrophes; 
rather, we should just keep our concerns about ambiguity in check.
■
■
It’s good to know the rules about when and where to use 
apostrophes, and adhere to them in formal and many informal 
contexts. Judgment is rampant. But in terms of how we judge 
others, we should exercise some caution. Many brilliant writers 
are not great proofers, and almost everyone gets mixed up at least 
sometimes on its/it’s.
■
■
We still read and celebrate historical texts that used the apostrophe 
very differently, with less consistency than we insist on today. 
And even in that consistency, as we have talked about in this 
lecture, there are lots of exceptions and idiosyncrasies regarding 
“standard” use of the apostrophe.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Should the possessive form be Bill Gates’ or Bill Gates’s? What 
about boss’ or boss’s? Should we be consistent in how we handle the 
possessive for all nouns that end in –s?
2.	 Why shouldn’t we use an apostrophe in possessive pronouns and 
write your’s, our’s, her’s, their’s, and it’s?

163
English Grammar Boot Camp
I
n this final lecture, we’ll start by covering two tricky issues: the use of 
“based off of” and “advocate for,” two evolutions that are currently 
controversial but may end up sticking. Then we’ll move on to discuss 
what makes a rule a rule—as we’ve seen throughout this course, it’s a 
murky issue. We’ll close with some general advice on when you should 
and shouldn’t correct someone, as well as a look at how you can make 
deliberate, effective choices as a writer.
Based Off What?
■
■
In student writing, “based off of” has become very widely used 
(rather than “based on”). The Google Books Ngram Viewer reports 
that “based off of” has risen dramatically since 1980, including 
tripling in use between 2000 and 2008. But “based on” still 
outnumbered it 10,000 to 1 in 2008.
■
■
It’s not surprising that we’re seeing “based off of” in students’ 
writing. They are the movers and shakers of change, and it is a 
fairly colloquial feature that they may not know to edit out of their 
academic prose. 
■
■
Changes in grammar typically happen first in the spoken 
language, which can make new forms feel more informal. Why 
might speakers be shifting to “based off of?” There is no definite 
answer, but we can point to two factors:
Trending Language
Lecture

164
Lecture 24  ▪  Trending Language
□
□
Prepositions are notoriously idiomatic. You just have to learn 
them, and they don’t always make sense. For example, why is 
it “as a result” and not “in a result” or “for a result”? 
□
□
While “based on” makes sense as we build on the base that 
is there, we also can build off things (when we extend them). 
We also have “jumping-off points,” so one could argue there is 
a logic to “based off of” as well.
■
■
Some folks don’t like “off of” because they think it is redundant, 
which is a fair point. Interestingly, it’s not a new redundancy. Being 
old doesn’t make a construction good per se, but it does suggest 
that this is a redundancy that doesn’t grate on speakers too much 
in the general scheme of things.
■
■
Here’s an example from Shakespeare’s Henry VI. Simpcox, 
when asked why he is lame, responds, “A fall off of a tree.” This 
construction tends to be colloquial, but it will sometimes appear in 
more formal writing.
■
■
The bottom-line question: Is it OK to use “based off of” in formal/
professional writing? There is some informal censure of “based off 
of” out there. But there isn’t a lot of formal prescription on “based 
off of” yet. In other words, the writers of style guides and usage 
manuals have not started paying attention to this new construction 
on the rise.
■
■
In sum, change is afoot. If usage guide writers continue to let it fly 
generally under the radar and don’t clamp down on it as “wrong,” 
then the change may happen fairly rapidly and “based off” will 
become more and more standard in formal contexts. But right 
now, writers use it with some risk of judgment.
Advocacy
■
■
Let’s look at another tricky prepositional issue. Here are two 
sentences from a question on the AHD usage ballot:

165
English Grammar Boot Camp
□
□
Sentence 1: The teacher advocated a new educational 
technique. 
□
□
Sentence 2: The teacher advocated for a new educational 
technique. 
■
■
Sentence 2 makes some people grimace. But forty-five percent 
of the panel voted it as acceptable, so clearly opinions are split. 
The AHD editors as a result stayed conservative in their summary: 
“A careful writer” will use advocate transitively without for. A writer 
should only use for in a sentence like, “She advocates for former 
foster children” (where the beneficiary is present).
■
■
Notice that the AHD editors do not say “advocate for” is wrong. 
Rather, the goal is to make choices that are careful about context, 
audience, and expectations. And as part of our care, we should 
recognize that opinions as voiced by usage guide writers and 
entities like the Usage Panel will change over time.
Rules
■
■
Given all this, let’s think again about what makes a grammar/
usage rule a rule. As we’ve done throughout this course, we first 
need to distinguish the descriptive from the prescriptive.
□
□
Descriptive rules are patterns that govern how we use the 
language to create grammatical utterances that others will 
understand; an example is the order in which determiners 
must occur.
□
□
Prescriptive rules are created by real people, at specific 
moments in time, to try to manage the language, especially 
the written language. An example is consistency in the use 
of commas, which has the goal of minimizing distraction  
for readers.
■
■
In the end, we make choices based on the grammatical information 
we have at hand. This is empowering. It also reminds us that 

166
Lecture 24  ▪  Trending Language
English usage is a living thing, changing along as generations of 
speakers roll over.
Changes to Watch
■
■
What changes should you be watching? Predictions are dangerous, 
but here are some guesses as to what the future might hold:
1.	
New modals could emerge (in addition to hafta and gonna, we 
might also see sposta).
2.	
The demise of whom might be underway.
3.	
We could see growing acceptance of singular they.
4.	
An expansion of the perfect and the progressive could occur.
5.	
We might see the death of the subjunctive. But this is hard 
to know—the most remarkable thing is that it hasn’t died 
yet. The subjunctive mood captures belief, intention, desire; 
and it states information contrary to the facts. It appears in 
sentences such as, “If I were grammar queen for a day.” Many 
people don’t know what it is, and yet some studies indicate 
that in American English its use is increasing in sentences 
like, “I demand that he study grammar joyfully.” 
6.	
Noun modifiers could increase. An example: “Great Courses 
lecture material.”
7.	
Slash as a conjunction and because as a preposition might 
grow.
8.	
The use of on accident could increase; the same goes for 
impactful.
9.	
The quotative like will grow in frequency.
10.	 Hone in will fully replace home in.

167
English Grammar Boot Camp
■
■
Regarding the last example: Home in showed up in the 1920s and 
took on the metaphorical meaning of focus on by 1950s. By the 
1960s, hone in on also took on this meaning.
■
■
Today, is home in on losing its status as the standard form? 
Research with Google Books shows home in on is still more 
common, but the gap has narrowed significantly. 
Should We Correct?
■
■
We should be very careful about how and when we alert other 
people to a usage issue. It can be a very powerful move, to stop 
and correct someone. It shows you’re listening to how they are 
talking as much or more than what they are saying.
■
■
Correction is one thing if you’re a teacher reading a piece of formal 
writing. It’s quite another if you’re in a conversation. Correcting 
someone in a conversation can be very silencing. You can see 
this online when people correct other people’s grammar as the 
ultimate weapon in an argument.
■
■
Hopefully, we can embrace how much we care about language 
and use that caring for good. We can create beautiful prose—
or clever prose or efficient prose or funny prose—in a variety of 
genres, being careful about how we use the language and being 
deliberate in our grammatical choices, without being unnecessarily 
overly fussy. 
■
■
Of course, we are going to notice things in language. We’ll notice 
typos, and then we can decide what we want to make of them. 
We’ll notice new grammatical developments and differences 
across regions and social groups—we can’t control that.
■
■
What we can control is what we think we know about that person 
based on that bit of grammar—or based on their accent, or a 
word choice that reflects what region they’re from, or what social 
group they identify with. We can control what judgments we want  
to make.

168
Lecture 24  ▪  Trending Language
■
■
We can control any impulse we might have to go “grammando” 
when we hear something. Ask: Does that thought stay in our head 
or do we say it out loud? What is the goal? What is the context? 
Are we being helpful or hurtful? Are we sure we’re right?
■
■
Let’s think of ourselves as caretakers of the language, tending 
it to allow it to do its work in powerful, effective ways. To be 
effective, language (both written and spoken) must respond to 
its audience and context, which requires some flexibility in what 
kind of grammar is preferred. And as we’ve talked about, there are 
many English grammars; the formal written standard is just one of 
them. To be effective, formal written language also benefits from 
consistency (so as not to distract readers) and from minimizing 
ambiguity. 
■
■
Language also needs to be creative; it needs to be allowed to 
surprise us and to adapt to the needs and desires of the speakers 
and writers who are both older and younger than we are. The next 
time you find yourself contemplating a grammatical construction 

169
English Grammar Boot Camp
that strikes your ear as not quite right if not downright wrong, 
imagine yourself being asked to judge its acceptability as if you 
were a member of the AHD Usage Panel.
■
■
This course has hopefully given you new tools and perspectives to 
approach that question, to think about what acceptability means in 
what context and how that may change over time. Key tools you 
can use include usage guides, the Google Books Ngram Viewer, 
the Corpus of Contemporary American English, and the Corpus of 
Historical American English.
■
■
With this knowledge and these tools, you can effectively be an 
advocate for what you see as the most effective language choices. 
Remember that whatever you choose—whether to embrace 
tradition or embrace change—you are following in the footsteps 
of many eloquent speakers and writers who precede us. To make 
those kinds of decisions about grammar more consciously and 
deliberately is what it means to harness the power of language.

go about answering the question?
