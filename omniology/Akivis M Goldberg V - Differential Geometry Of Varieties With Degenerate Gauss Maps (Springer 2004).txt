Preface
1. The Gauss Map. The Gauss map of an oriented smooth surface X2 in
Euclidean space E3 is the mapping of X2 into the unit sphere S2 ⊂E3:
γ : X2 →S2,
by means of the family of the unit normals n to X2. This map carries a point
x ∈X2 to a point p ∈S2, where p is the terminal point of the vector n
emanating from some ﬁxed point O ∈E3, γ(x) = p (see Figure 0.1).
Figure 0.1
If dσ is an area element of the surface X2 and dω is an area element of the
spherical image of X2, then
dω = Kdσ,
where K is the Gaussian curvature of X2 (see Gauss [Ga 27] or Stoker [Sto 61],
p. 94).
The Gauss map γ is degenerate at a point x ∈X2 if K = 0 at this point,
and the Gauss map γ is degenerate on the surface X2 if the curvature K
vanishes at all points of X2. In this case the Gauss map γ maps the surface
xi

Preface
X2 into a curve C ⊂S2 (see Figure 0.2). The tangent planes to the surface
X2 depend on one parameter, and the surface X itself is an envelope of this
family of tangent planes.
Figure 0.2
If the surface X2 is deﬁned in E3 by the equation z = f(x, y), then the
condition K = 0 is equivalent to the Monge–Amp`ere equation
rt −s2 = 0,
where r = zxx, s = zxy, t = zyy (see Monge [Mon 50]). The surfaces with K = 0
are called developable. Such surfaces can be locally mapped isometrically into
a plane. The latter property is the reason that surfaces with the vanishing
Gaussian curvature are called developable: they can be “developed on the
plane.”
Developable surfaces are a well-known subject from the 19th century. Lo-
cally they are classiﬁed into three types: cones, cylinders, and torses (tangential
developables). A torse is a one-parameter family of tangent lines to a ﬁxed
smooth space curve.
The deﬁnition of the Gauss map can be easily extended to a hypersurface
X = Xn of Euclidean space En+1. The Gauss map of an oriented smooth
hypersurface Xn ⊂En+1 is the mapping of V n into the unit hypersphere
Sn ⊂En+1:
γ : X →Sn,
by means of the family of hypersurface normals n. If X ⊂En+1 is given by
the equation
z = f(x1, . . . , xn),
then the condition for its Gauss map to be degenerate has the form
det(zij) = 0,

Preface
xiii
where zij =
∂2z
∂xi∂xj . If the submanifold X is of codimension N −n > 1, then
the condition for its Gauss map γ to be degenerate has a more complicated
form.
The fact that the Gauss map γ of X ⊂En+1 is degenerate is of projectively
invariant nature. This is the reason that the degeneracy of the Gauss map can
be deﬁned in terms of projective diﬀerential geometry.
Let X be a smooth oriented submanifold of dimension n in the N-dimensio-
nal projective space PN, and let G(n, N) be the Grassmannian of n-dimensional
subspaces of the space PN. Then the Gauss map γ of X ⊂PN is deﬁned as
the map
γ : X →G(n, N),
which carries a point x ∈X to the tangent subspace Tx(X) to X at the point
x, i.e.,
γ(x) = Tx(X).
The rank r of the map γ is called the rank of the submanifold X of dimension
n. The rank r does not exceed n, and we assume that the rank r is constant
on X.
In a projective space PN, a variety X of dimension n is said to be a variety
with a degenerate Gauss map or a tangentially degenerate variety if the rank of
its Gauss map γ : X →G(n, N) is less than n. We use the term “variety” here
instead of “submanifold” because X has a degenerate Gauss map, and hence
it is diﬀerentiable almost everywhere (see Section 2.1) while a submanifold is
diﬀerentiable everywhere.
In this book we study the geometry of varieties with degenerate Gauss
maps, construct a classiﬁcation of such varieties based on the structure of
their focal images, and consider applications of the theory of such varieties to
diﬀerent problems of diﬀerential geometry and its applications.
Note that in higher dimensions the property through which developable
surfaces can be mapped isometrically into a plane is not valid any longer. This
is why we prefer to call a variety X ⊂PN for which rank γ < n a variety
with a degenerate Gauss map or a tangentially degenerate variety. Note that
some authors (Fisher, Ishikawa, Piontkowski, Mezzetti, Tommasi, Rogora, Wu,
Zheng) call such varieties developable.

Developments in the Theory of Varieties with Degenerate
Gauss Maps. As we mentioned earlier, the developable surfaces in the three-
dimensional Euclidean space are a well-known subject from the 19th century.
The torses (tangential developables) form a special class of ruled surfaces,
namely developable ruled surfaces, and of necessity have singularities, at least
along the original curve.
There are numerous publications on developable

surfaces. The main properties of developable surfaces can be found in most
textbooks on diﬀerential geometry.
Mathematically developable surfaces are the subject of several branches
of mathematics, especially of diﬀerential geometry and algebraic geometry.
Recently developable surfaces have attracted attention through their relation
with computer science (see, for example, the book by Pottmann and Wallner
[PW 01]). They are widely used in industry, and are fundamental objects in
computer-aided design (see for example, the paper by Hoschek and Pottmann
[HoP 95]). Though singularities can be avoided in practical situations, the
appearance of singularities in developable surfaces is essential to their nature.
Thus the complete description of the structure of developable surfaces involves
the singularity theory which was developed in the 20th century (see, for exam-
ple, the books Bruce and Giblin [BG 92] and Porteous [Por 94]).
The multidimensional varieties X with degenerate Gauss maps of rank
r < n were considered by ´E. Cartan in [C 16] in connection with his study of
metric deformation of hypersurfaces, and in [C 19] in connection with his study
of manifolds of constant curvature. Yanenko [Ya 53] encountered these varieties
in his study of metric deformation of submanifolds of arbitrary classes. Akivis
[A 57, 62], Savelyev [Sa 57, 60], and Ryzhkov [Ry 60] systematically studied
this kind of variety in a projective space PN. Brauner [Br 38], Wu [Wu 95], and
Fischer and Wu [FW 95] studied such varieties in a Euclidean N-space EN.
Akivis and Goldberg in their book [AG 93] investigated the multidimensional
varieties with degenerate Gauss maps in Chapter 4.
Note that a relationship of the rank of varieties X and their deformation
in a Euclidean N-space was indicated by Bianchi [Bi 05] who proved that
a necessary condition for X to be deformable is the condition rank X ≤2.
Allend¨orfer [Al 39] introduced the notion of type t, t = 0, 1, , . . . , m = dim X,
of X and proved that varieties XN−p, p > 1, of type t > 2 in EN are rigid.
Note that both notions, the type and the rank, are projectively and metrically
invariant, and that for a hypersurface, the type coincides with the rank.
Griﬃths and Harris in their classical paper [GH 79] considered the varieties
X with degenerate Gauss maps from the point of view of algebraic geometry.
The paper [GH 79] was followed by Landsberg’s paper [L 96] and book [L 99]
and by the recently published book [FP 01] by Fischer and Piontkowski. The
books [L 99] and [FP 01] have special sections devoted to varieties with degen-
erate Gauss maps. They are in some sense an update to the paper [GH 79].
In both books, following [GH 79], the authors employed a second fundamental
form for studying developable varieties, gave detailed and more elementary
proofs of some results in [GH 79], and reported on some recent progress in this
area. In particular, in [FP 01] the authors gave a classiﬁcation of developable
varieties of rank two in codimension one.

In recent years many papers devoted to varieties with degenerate Gauss
maps have appeared. Zak [Za 87] studied the Gauss maps of submanifolds of
the projective space from the point of view of algebraic geometry. Ishikawa
and Morimoto [IM 01] investigated the connection between such varieties and
solutions of Monge–Amp`ere equations. Ishikawa [I 98, 99b] found real algebraic
cubic nonsingular hypersurfaces with degenerate Gauss maps in RPN for N =
4, 7, 13, 25, and in [I 99a] he studied singularities of C∞-hypersurfaces with
degenerate Gauss maps. Rogora [Rog 97] and Mezzetti and Tommasi [MT
02a, 02c] also considered varieties with degenerate Gauss maps from the point
of view of algebraic geometry. Piontkowski [Pio 01, 02a, 02b] considered in PN
complete varieties with degenerate Gauss maps with rank equal to two, three,
and four and with all singularities located on a hyperplane at inﬁnity. The
reader can ﬁnd more details on all these results in the Notes to Chapter 2.
The contents of this book are connected with the theory of singularities of
diﬀerentiable mappings. There are numerous publications on this topic. In par-
ticular, in the book [AVGL 89] by Arnol’d, Vasil’ev, Goryunov, and Lyashko,
which is devoted to investigations of singularities of diﬀerentiable mappings,
their classiﬁcation, and their applications, the authors consider the singulari-
ties of the Grassmann mappings of submanifolds of the Euclidean space and
the projective space. Many papers (for example, [Sh 82] by Shcherbak and [I
00b] by Ishikawa) are devoted to a classiﬁcation of isolated singular points of
curves in the Euclidean space and the projective space.
As a rule, the singular points we consider on a variety with a degenerate
Gauss map are not isolated (see Section 2.4).
We outline here what distinguishes our book on varieties with degenerate
Gauss maps from other literature on this subject:
i) In the current book the authors systematically study the diﬀerential ge-
ometry of varieties with degenerate Gauss maps. They apply the main
methods of diﬀerential geometry: the tensor analysis, the method of ex-
terior forms, and the moving frame method.
ii) Western authors were not familiar with the results obtained by Russian
geometers in the 1960s (Akivis, Ryzhkov, Savelyev). Some of the results
presented by western geometers had been known for years. We present
all these results in their historical perspective.
iii) In the study of varieties with degenerate Gauss maps, the authors sys-
tematically use the focal images (the focal hypersurfaces and the focal
hypercones) associated with such varieties. These images were ﬁrst in-
troduced by Akivis in [A 57]. They allow the authors to describe the
geometry of the varieties with degenerate Gauss maps and give their

xvi
Preface
classiﬁcation. Note that in algebraic geometry, the focal hypersurfaces
are called the discriminant varieties.
iv) In the complex projective space, every plane generator L of a variety
with a degenerate Gauss map carries singular points. The question is
whether these singular points should be included in L.
Our point of
view is that it is very useful to include them in L; this simpliﬁes the
exposition.
Many algebraic geometers who study this subject do not
consider singular points as a part of L, and this makes their exposition
of the results more complicated.
Note also that in most of the books and papers where the singularities
of diﬀerentiable mappings are considered, the authors investigate only
isolated singularities. But the singularities of Gauss maps comprise al-
gebraic curves or hypersurfaces in the plane generators of varieties with
degenerate Gauss maps.
v) It appeared that the Griﬃths–Harris conjecture on the structure of va-
rieties with degenerate Gauss maps is not complete. As we show in this
book (see also our paper [AG 01a] and the paper [AGL 01] by Akivis,
Goldberg, and Landsberg), the basic types of varieties with degenerate
Gauss maps include not only cones and torses but also hypersurfaces
with degenerate Gauss maps. Note that such hypersurfaces form a very
wide class of varieties with degenerate Gauss maps.
vi) When the authors were writing this book, they found some new results on
the varieties with degenerate Gauss maps. Some of them were already
published and some are in papers submitted for publication.
Among
these results are a new classiﬁcation of such varieties (see Akivis and
Goldberg [AG 01a]), a detailed investigation of Sacksteder–Bourgain hy-
persurfaces (see Akivis and Goldberg [AG 01b]), ﬁnding an aﬃne ana-
logue of the Hartman–Nirenberg cylinder theorem (see [AG 02a]), es-
tablishing the relation between the smooth lines on projective planes
over two-dimensional algebras and the varieties with degenerate Gauss
maps (see Akivis and Goldberg [AG 02b]), application of the duality
principle for construction of varieties with degenerate Gauss maps (see
Akivis and Goldberg [AG 02b]), and a description of a new class varieties
with degenerate Gauss maps (twisted cones) (see Akivis and Goldberg
[AG 03b]).
vii) In this book we consider a very large number of examples. Some of these
examples (such as the twisted cones and some algebraic hypersurfaces
in P4) are considered here for the ﬁrst time, and other examples (such

Preface
xvii
as the cubic symmetroid in P5 and its projection onto P4) were known
earlier but are considered here from a new point of view.
viii) The authors give a new deﬁnition for the dual defect of a variety with a
degenerate Gauss map and for dually degenerate varieties with degener-
ate Gauss maps (see p. 72). This new deﬁnition is better than the usual
deﬁnition of the dual defect given on p. 71: while by old deﬁnition all
varieties with degenerate Gauss maps are dually degenerate, by the new
deﬁnition, they can be both dually degenerate and dually nondegenerate.
Moreover, while by the old deﬁnition, the dual defect δ∗of a dually non-
degenerate variety with degenerate Gauss map equals its Gauss defect,
δ∗= δγ > 0, by the new deﬁnition, the dual defect δ∗of such a variety
equals 0, δ∗= 0, and this is more appropriate for a dually nondegenerate
variety.
In addition to varieties with degenerate Gauss maps, algebraic geometry
studies other kinds of degenerate varieties (such as secantly degenerate and
dually degenerate varieties; see, for example, the paper [GH 78] by Griﬃths
and Harris; the books [L 99] by Landsberg, pp.
4, 16, and 52; [T 01] by
Tevelev, Chapters 6, 9; and [Ha 92] by Harris, pp. 197–199). Not as many
secantly degenerate, dually degenerate, and degenerate varieties of other kinds
are known. For example, there is only one secantly degenerate variety in the
projective space P5, namely, the Veronese variety (see Sasaki [Sas 91] and
Akivis [A 92]). In this connection, note also that all smooth dually degenerate
varieties of dimension n ≤10 are listed (see for example, the book [T 01] by
Tevelev, Chapter 9, or Notes to Section 2.5 of this book where the appropriate
references are given).
Unlike the classes of these degenerate varieties, the varieties with degenerate
Gauss maps compose a much wider class. In particular, the arbitrariness of the
class of torsal varieties is equal to some number of functions of two variables,
and the arbitrariness of the class of hypersurfaces with degenerate Gauss maps
of rank r in the space PN (as well as their dual image, smooth tangentially
nondegenerate subvarieties, for which r = n) is equal to N −r functions of r
variables. Hence, the study of the varieties with degenerate Gauss maps in the
space PN is of considerable interest.
Note that in the book only dually nondegenerate varieties with degenerate
Gauss maps are under investigation. For such varieties, the system of second
fundamental forms always contains at least one nondegenerate form of rank r,
and for them not only the focus hypersurfaces but also the focus hypercones

whose vertices are the tangent subspaces of the variety X are correctly deﬁned.
3. The Contents of the Book. The book consists of ﬁve chapters. In
Chapter 1, we give the basic notions and results of vector spaces and projec-
tive space, consider the main topics associated with diﬀerentiable manifolds,
and study some algebraic varieties, namely, Grassmannians and determinant
submanifolds.
In Chapter 2, we introduce the basic notions associated with a variety in a
projective space PN, deﬁne the rank of a variety and varieties with degenerate
Gauss maps, present the main examples of varieties with degenerate Gauss
maps (cones, torses, hypersurfaces, joins, etc.), study the duality principle
and its applications, consider another example of submanifolds with degener-
ate Gauss maps (the cubic symmetroid) and correlative transformations, and
investigate a hypersurface with a degenerate Gauss map associated with a
Veronese variety and ﬁnd its singular points. The reader can ﬁnd more details
on Chapters 1 and 2 in the Contents.
In Chapter 3, we deﬁne the Monge–Amp`ere foliation associated with a vari-
ety with a degenerate Gauss map of dimension n, derive the basic equations of
varieties with degenerate Gauss maps, prove a characteristic property of such
varieties (the leaves of the Monge–Amp`ere foliation are ﬂat), and consider focal
images of such varieties (the focus hypersurfaces and the focus hypercones). In
this chapter we also study varieties with degenerate Gauss maps not only in the
complex projective space but also in the real projective space, the aﬃne space,
the Euclidean space, and the non-Euclidean spaces. We prove that in these
spaces there are varieties with degenerate Gauss maps without singularities,
and we introduce and investigate an important class of varieties with degen-
erate Gauss maps without singularities, the so-called the Sacksteder–Bourgain
hypersurface. Note that Sacksteder and Bourgain constructed examples of hy-
persurfaces with degenerate Gauss maps in the aﬃne space A4. In Section
3.4 (see also the paper by Akivis and Goldberg [AG 01b]), we prove that the
hypersurfaces constructed by them are locally equivalent, and we construct
a series of hypersurfaces with degenerate Gauss maps in the aﬃne space AN
generalizing the Sacksteder–Bourgain hypersurface.
In Chapter 4, in the projective space PN, we consider the basic types of va-
rieties with degenerate Gauss maps: cones, torsal varieties, hypersurfaces with
degenerate Gauss maps. For each of these types, we consider the structure of
their focal images and ﬁnd suﬃcient conditions for a variety to belong to one
of these types (for torsal varieties our condition is also necessary). The classi-
ﬁcation of varieties X with degenerate Gauss maps presented in this chapter
is based on the structure of the focal images of X. In a series of theorems, we
establish this connection. We prove that varieties with degenerate Gauss maps

Preface
xix
that do not belong to one of the basic types are foliated into varieties of basic
types. Finally, we prove an embedding theorem for varieties with degenerate
Gauss maps and ﬁnd suﬃcient conditions for such a variety to be a cone. In this
chapter, we also consider varieties with degenerate Gauss maps in the aﬃne
space AN and ﬁnd a new aﬃne analogue of the Hartman–Nirenberg cylinder
theorem. We consider here parabolic hypersurfaces in the space P4 (i.e., the
hypersurfaces X with degenerate Gauss maps of rank r = 2 that have a double
focus F on each rectilinear generator L). We also prove existence theorems for
some varieties with degenerate Gauss maps, for example, for twisted cones in
P4 and A4, and we establish a structure of twisted cones in P4. This structure
allows us to ﬁnd a procedure for construction of twisted cylinders in A4.
Chapter 5 is devoted to further examples and applications of the theory
of varieties with degenerate Gauss maps. As the ﬁrst application, we prove
that lightlike hypersurfaces in the de Sitter space Sn+1
1
have degenerate Gauss
maps, that their rank r ≤n−1, and that there are singular points and singular
submanifolds on them. We classify singular points and describe the structure of
lightlike hypersurfaces carrying singular points of diﬀerent types. Moreover, we
establish the connection of this classiﬁcation with that of canal hypersurfaces
of the conformal space. As the second application, we establish a relation of
the theory of varieties with degenerate Gauss maps in projective spaces with
the theory of congruences and pseudocongruences of subspaces and show how
these two theories can be applied to the construction of induced connections on
submanifolds of projective spaces and other spaces endowed with a projective
structure. As the third application, we consider smooth lines on projective
planes over the complete matrix algebra M of order two, the algebra C of
complex numbers, the algebra C1 of double numbers, and the algebra C0 of dual
numbers. For the algebras, C, C1, and C0, in the space RP5, to these smooth
lines there correspond families of straight lines describing three-dimensional
point varieties X3 with degenerate Gauss maps of rank r ≤2.
We prove
that they represent examples of diﬀerent types of varieties X3 with degenerate
Gauss maps.
Sections, formulas, and ﬁgures in the book are numbered within each chap-
ter. Each chapter is accompanied by notes containing remarks of historical
and bibliographical nature and some supplementary results pertinent to the
main content of the book. A fairly complete bibliography on multidimensional
varieties with degenerate Gauss maps, a list of notations, an author index, and
a subject index are at the end of the book.
Bibliographic references give the author’s last name followed by the ﬁrst
letter(s) of the author’s last name and the last two digits of the year in square
brackets, for example, Blaschke [Bl 21]. Note that in the bibliography, in ad-
dition to the original article being cited, reviews of the article in major mathe-

f¨ur Mathematik, Mathematical Reviews) are referenced.
4. General Remarks for the Reader. This book is intended for gradu-
ate students whose ﬁeld is diﬀerential geometry, as well as for mathematicians
and teachers conducting research in this subject. It can be used in special
graduate courses in mathematics.
In our presentation we use the tensorial methods in combination with the
methods of exterior diﬀerential forms and moving frames of ´Elie Cartan. The
reader is assumed to be familiar with these methods, as well as with the basics
of modern diﬀerential geometry. However, in Chapter 1 we recall basic facts
of tensor calculus and the method of moving frame in the form in which they
will be used in the book. Many other concepts of diﬀerential geometry are ex-
plained brieﬂy in the text; some are given without explanation. As references,
the books [KN 63] by Kobayashi and Nomizu, [BCGGG 91] by Bryant et al.,
and [C 45] by ´E. Cartan are recommended. In the book [Sto 69] by Stoker,
the reader can ﬁnd the main notions and theorems of elementary diﬀerential
geometry that are necessary for reading this book. We also recommend our
book Akivis and Goldberg [AG 93], in which the projective diﬀerential geom-
etry of general submanifolds and some of their most important special classes
were developed systematically. We will often refer to this book.
All functions, vector and tensor ﬁelds, and diﬀerential forms are assumed
to be diﬀerentiable almost everywhere. As a rule, we use the index notations in
our presentation. We believe this allows us to obtain a deeper understanding
of the essence of problems in local diﬀerential geometry.
Note also that if we impose a restriction on a variety, then, as a rule, we
assume that this condition holds at all points of this variety. More precisely,
we consider only the domain of the variety where this restriction holds.

Chapter 1
Foundational Material
In Section 1.1, we discuss the basic notions and results of vector spaces, vectors and tensors
in them, and the general linear group. In Section 1.2, we consider the main topics associated
with diﬀerentiable manifolds: tangent spaces, frame bundles, mappings, exterior diﬀerential
calculus, Cartan’s lemma, completely integrable systems, the Frobenius theorem, Cartan’s
test for a system in involution, the structure equations of a diﬀerentiable manifold and of the
general linear group, and aﬃne connections. Section 1.3 is dedicated to a projective space—
we consider projective transformations, projective frames, and the structure equations of a
projective space, the duality principle, projectivization, classical homogeneous spaces (aﬃne,
Euclidean, non-Euclidean), and their transformations. In Section 1.4 we demonstrate the ge-
ometric and analytic methods of specialization of moving frames by considering the geometry
of a curve in the projective plane. Finally, in Section 1.5, we study some algebraic varieties,
namely, Grassmannians and determinant submanifolds (Segre and Veronese varieties).
1.1
Vector Space
1.1.1 The General Linear Group. In what follows, the notion of a ﬁnite-
dimensional vector space Ln over the ﬁeld of real or complex numbers will
play an important role. We will not state here the basic axioms and proper-
ties of a vector space—they can be found in any textbook on linear algebra.
Note only that a frame (or a basis) of an n-dimensional vector space Ln is a
system consisting of n linearly independent vectors e1, e2, . . . , en. A transition
from one frame R = {e1, e2, . . . , en} to another frame R′ = {e′
1, e′
2, . . . , e′
n} is
determined by the relation
e′
i = ej · aj
i, i, j = 1, . . . , n,
(1.1)
where a = (aj
i) ∈GL(n) is a nonsingular square matrix. (In these formulas
and everywhere in the sequel the Einstein summation convention is used, i.e.,
1

2
1. Foundational Material
it is assumed that summation is carried out over the indices that appear twice:
once above and once below.) Thus, the family R(Ln) of frames in the space
Ln depends on n2 parameters.
Let us ﬁx a frame R0, and let Ra be an arbitrary frame in the space Ln,
where a is a set of parameters determining the location of the frame Ra with
respect to the frame R0:
Ra = R0 · a.
(1.2)
In (1.2) the entries of the matrix a = (aj
i) are global functions on the manifold
R(Ln). Equation (1.2) shows that the frame Ra is a diﬀerentiable function (in
fact, linear) of parameters a = (aj
i). Let Ra+da be a frame near the frame Ra
on the manifold R(Ln). Then the transition from the frame Ra to the frame
Ra+da is described as follows:
Ra+da = R0 · (a + da) = Ra · (a−1) · (a + da)
= Ra · (I + a−1 · da) = Ra · (I + ωa),
(1.3)
where
ωa = a−1 · da
(1.4)
is a diﬀerential 1-form. Now (1.3) implies that
dRa = Ra · ωa.
(1.5)
The form ωa is a left-invariant form with respect to the transformations
of the group GL(n). In fact, let g be a ﬁxed element from the group GL(n).
Then
ωga = (ga)−1d(ga)
= (a−1 · g−1 · (dg · a + g · da)
= a−1(g−1 · g)da = a−1 · da = ωa
(1.6)
(because dg = 0). The fact that the forms ωa deﬁned by (1.4) are left-invariant
guarantees that all our constructions do not depend on the choice of the initial
frame R0 in Ln.
Because Ra = {e1, e2, . . . , en}, by setting ωa = (ωj
i ), we can write equations
(1.5) in the vector form
dei = ej · ωj
i .
(1.7)
Following ´E. Cartan, we shall write equations (1.7) in the form
dei = ωj
i · ej.
(1.8)

1.1
Vector Space

1.1.2 Vectors and Tensors. Let us ﬁnd the law of transformation of
the coordinates of a vector under transformations of a frame in the space
Ln. Suppose we have two frames R and R′ whose vectors are connected by
relations (1.1). An arbitrary vector x can be represented in the form of linear
combinations of the vectors of these two frames:
x = xiei = ′xie′
i.
(1.9)
Using formulas (1.1), we ﬁnd from (1.9) that
xi = ai
j · ′xj,
′xi = ai
jxj,
(1.10)
where (ai
j) is the inverse matrix of the matrix (ai
j).
In what follows, it will be more convenient for us to replace equations
(1.10) with equivalent diﬀerential equations. We assume that the vector x is
unchanged under transformations of a frame, i.e., we assume that dx = 0. If
we diﬀerentiate the ﬁrst equation of (1.9) and apply formulas (1.8), we obtain
0 = dxiei + xidei = (dxi + xjωi
j)ei.
The linear independence of the vectors ei implies that
dxi + xjωi
j = 0.
(1.11)
Equations (1.11) are the desired diﬀerential equations, which are equivalent to
equations (1.10). Equations (1.10) can be recovered by integrating equations
(1.11).
A covector is a linear function ξ(x) of the vector variable x. The coordinate
representation of ξ(x) is ξ(x) = ξixi. Because this expression does not depend
on the choice of the frame R, we have ξixi = const. The linear forms ξ(x) in
Ln form the vector space (Ln)∗called the dual space of the space Ln.
Next, let us ﬁnd the diﬀerential equations for coordinates of a covector
ξi. It follows from the deﬁnition of a covector that its contraction ξixi with
coordinates xi of an arbitrary vector x is constant, i.e., this contraction does
not depend on the choice of frame:
ξixi = const.
Diﬀerentiating this relation and using formulas (1.11), we ﬁnd that
dξixi + ξidxi = (dξi −ξjωj
i )xi = 0.

4
1. Foundational Material
Because this holds for any vector xi, it follows that
dξi −ξjωj
i = 0.
(1.12)
Similar equations can be derived for a tensor of any type. For example, let
us consider a tensor t of the type (1, 2) with components ti
jk. It follows from
the deﬁnition of such a tensor that its contraction with coordinates xj, yk, and
ξi of arbitrary vectors x, y and an arbitrary covector ξ does not depend on the
choice of frame:
ti
jkxjykξi = const.
Diﬀerentiating this relation and using formulas (1.11) and (1.12), we ﬁnd the
diﬀerential equations that the components ti
jk of the tensor t satisfy:
dti
jk −ti
lkωl
j −ti
jlωl
k + tl
jkωi
l = 0.
(1.13)
By integrating equations (1.12) and (1.13), we can get the laws of transforma-
tion of the coordinates of a covector ξi and the tensor ti
jk under transformation
(1.11) of a frame:
′ξi = aj
iξj,
′ti
jk = al
jam
k ai
ptp
lm.
(1.14)
To simplify the form of equations (1.11), (1.12), (1.13), and similar equa-
tions, it is convenient to introduce the diﬀerential operator ∇deﬁned by the
following formulas:
∇xi = dxi + xjωi
j,
∇ξi = dξi −ξjωi
j.
(1.15)
Using this operator, we can write equations (1.11), (1.12), and (1.13) in the
form
∇xi = 0, ∇ξi = 0, ∇ti
jk = 0.
(1.16)
In addition to the vectors and tensors considered above that were invariant
under transformations of a frame, we will encounter objects that get multiplied
by some number under transformations of a frame. This number depends on
the choice of basis and some other factors. Such objects are called relative vec-
tors and relative tensors. Their coordinates satisfy equations that are slightly
diﬀerent from equations (1.16). For example, for a relative tensor of type (1, 2),
these equations have the form
∇ti
jk = θti
jk,
(1.17)

1.2
Diﬀerentiable Manifolds
5
where θ is a closed linear diﬀerential form. The following law of transformation:
′ti
jk = λal
jam
k ai
ptp
lm
(1.18)
corresponds to equations (1.17). If we diﬀerentiate (1.17), we obtain (1.18),
where θ = dλ.
The simplest tensor is the tensor of type (0, 0) or an absolute invariant, i.e.,
a quantity K that does not depend on the choice of frame. For this quantity,
equation (1.16) becomes
dK = 0.
(1.19)
A relative invariant is a quantity K that is multiplied by a scalar under trans-
formations of a frame. For this quantity, equation (1.17) becomes
dK = θK.
(1.20)
1.2
Diﬀerentiable Manifolds
1.2.1 The Tangent Space, the Frame Bundle, and Tensor Fields. The
second basic that is needed is the notion of a diﬀerentiable manifold. We give
only the main points of the deﬁnition here; for more detail, we refer the reader
to other books (see, for example, the books [KN 63] by Kobayashi and Nomizu,
[Di 70, 71] by Dieudonn´e, or [Va 01] by Vasil’ev ).
A neighborhood of any point of a diﬀerentiable manifold M is homeomor-
phic to an open simply connected domain of the coordinate space Rn (or Cn
if the manifold M is complex). This allows us to introduce coordinates in the
neighborhood of any point of the manifold. The number n is the dimension of
the manifold M.
If neighborhoods of two points of the manifold M have a nonempty in-
tersection, then the two coordinate systems deﬁned in this intersection are
connected by means of invertible diﬀerentiable functions. The diﬀerentiabil-
ity class of these functions is called the class of the diﬀerentiable manifold.
Coordinates deﬁned in a neighborhood of a point of a diﬀerentiable manifold
admit invertible transformations of the same class of diﬀerentiability. In what
follows, we will assume the diﬀerentiable manifolds under considerations to be
of class C∞, and in the complex case we will assume them to be analytic.
Consider an n-dimensional diﬀerentiable manifold M n and a point x ∈M n.
In a neighborhood of the point x, we introduce coordinates in such a way that
the point x itself has zero coordinates.
Let xi = xi(t) be a smooth curve
passing through the point x. We parameterize this curve so that xi(0) = 0.

6
1. Foundational Material
The quantities dxi
dt

t=0= ξi are called the coordinates of the tangent vector ξ
to the curve under consideration at the point x. The parametric equations of
the curve can be written as xi(t) = ξit + oi(t), where oi(t) are inﬁnitesimals of
orders higher than t.
The set of tangent vectors to all curves passing through a point x ∈M n
forms an n-dimensional vector space. This space is called the tangent space
to the manifold M n at the point x and is denoted by Tx(M n). The set of all
tangent spaces TM n of the manifold M n along with their natural projections
TM n →M n is called its tangent bundle and is denoted by T(M n). An element
of the tangent bundle is a pair (x, ξ), where x ∈M n and ξ ∈Tx(M n). This
explains why the tangent bundle is also a diﬀerentiable manifold of dimension
2n, dim T(M n) = 2n.
Next, we consider the set of all possible frames Rx = {ei} in each tangent
space. This set can be viewed as a ﬁber of a ﬁbration R(M n) called the frame
bundle over the manifold M n. Because the family of frames at a ﬁxed point x
depends on n2 parameters, the dimension of the frame bundle R(M n) is equal
to n + n2: dim R(M n) = n + n2.
Let ξ be a vector of the space Tx(M n) : ξ ∈Tx(M n). The decomposition
of this vector relative to the basis {ei} has the form
ξ = ωi(ξ)ei,
(1.21)
where ωi(ξ) are the coordinates of the vector ξ with respect to the basis {ei}.
These coordinates are linear forms constituting a cobasis (a dual basis) in the
space Tx(M n). This cobasis is a basis in the dual space T ∗
x(M n). An element
of the dual space is a linear form over Tx(M n). It follows from formula (1.21)
that
ωi(ej) = δi
j.
(1.22)
The set of spaces T ∗
x(M n) forms the cotangent bundle T ∗(M n) over the mani-
fold M n.
Because every tangent space Tx(M n) is an n-dimensional vector space, we
can consider tensors of diﬀerent types in this space. A tensor ﬁeld t(x) is a
function that assigns to each point x ∈M n the value of the tensor t at this
point. We will assume that the function t(x) is diﬀerentiable as many times
as we need.
In each space Tx(M n), the frames {ei} admit transformations whose dif-
ferentials can be written in the form (1.8). Because later we will also consider
displacements of the point x along the manifold M n, we rewrite formulas (1.8)
in the form
δei = πj
i ej,
(1.23)

1.2
Diﬀerentiable Manifolds

where δ denotes diﬀerentiation when the point x is held ﬁxed, i.e., δ is the
restriction of the operator of diﬀerentiation d to the ﬁber Rx(M n) of the frame
bundle R(M n), and the forms πj
i are invariant forms of the general linear group
GL(n) of frame transformations in the space Tx(M n). Parameters deﬁning
the location of a frame in the space Tx(M n) are called secondary (or ﬁber)
parameters, in contrast to principal parameters, which deﬁne the location of
the point x in the manifold M n. This is why the symbol δ is called the operator
of diﬀerentiation with respect to the secondary parameters and the 1-forms πi
j
are called the secondary (or ﬁber) forms.
If a tensor ﬁeld is given on the manifold M n, then the coordinates of this
ﬁeld must satisfy equations of type (1.13) at any point of this ﬁeld. For ex-
ample, the coordinates ti
jk of the tensor ﬁeld t(x) of type (1, 2) depend not
only on a point x but also on the frame Rx attached to the point x, so that
ti
jk = ti
jk(x, Rx). If the point x is held ﬁxed, then this dependence can be
written in the form of the following diﬀerential equations:
δti
jk −ti
lkπl
j −ti
jlπl
k + tl
jkπi
l = 0.
(1.24)
If, in accordance with formulas (1.15), we denote the left-hand side of this
equation by ∇δti
jk, then this equation takes the form
∇δti
jk = 0.
(1.25)
If the point x moves along the manifold M, then for a tensor ﬁeld ti
jk(x),
equations (1.24) and (1.25) have the form
dti
jk −ti
lkωl
j −ti
jlωl
k + tl
jkωi
l = ti
jklωl
(1.26)
and
∇ti
jk = ti
jklωl,
(1.27)
where ωl are basis forms of the manifold M n.
1.2.2 Mappings of Diﬀerentiable Manifolds. Let M and N be two
manifolds of dimension m and n, respectively, and let f : M →N be a
diﬀerentiable mapping of M into N.
Consider a point a ∈M, its image
b = f(a) ∈N under the mapping f, and coordinate neighborhoods Ua and Ub
of the points a and b. The mapping f deﬁnes a correspondence
yu = f u(xi), i = 1, . . . , m, u = 1, . . . , n,
between coordinates of points x ∈Ua and y ∈Ub. A mapping f is diﬀerentiable
of class p, f ∈Cp, if and only if the functions f u are diﬀerentiable scalar

8
1. Foundational Material
functions of the same class p. If the functions f u are inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable
functions, then the mapping f belongs to class C∞, and if the functions f u
are analytic functions, then f ∈Cω.
Consider the matrix
M =
∂yu
∂xi

having n rows and m columns. This matrix is called the Jacobi matrix of the
mapping f. It is obvious that the rank r of this matrix satisﬁes the condition
r ≤min(m, n).
It is also obvious that the rank r depends on a point x ∈Ua. If the rank
reaches its maximal value at a point x, i.e., r = min(m, n), then the mapping
f is said to be nondegenerate at the point x, and the point x itself is called a
regular point of a mapping f. If r < min(m, n) at a point x, then the point x
is called a singular point of the mapping f.
The following relations can exist between the dimensions m and n:
a) m < n. In this case, in a neighborhood Ua of a regular point a, a mapping
f is injective. If a ∈M is a regular point of the mapping f, then b = f(a)
is a regular point of the submanifold V = f(M) ⊂N, and the map f
carries a suﬃciently small neighborhood of the point a into a spherical
neighborhood of the point b = f(a). Moreover, the tangent subspace
Tb(V ) at a regular point b is an m-dimensional subspace of the tangent
subspace Tb(N) whose dimension is equal to n. In particular, if m = 1,
the submanifold V is a curve in N, and if m = n −1, the submanifold V
is a hypersurface in N.
b) m > n. In this case, in a neighborhood Ua of a regular point a, a mapping
f is surjective. In Ua, this mapping deﬁnes a foliation whose leaves Fy
are the complete preimages f −1(y) of the points y ∈Ub, where b = f(a).
The dimension of a leaf is equal to m −n, and the dimension of the
subspace tangent to the leaf Fy is also m −n. If dim N = 1, then we
may assume that N ⊂R, and the leaves Fy are the level hypersurfaces
of the function
y = f(x1, . . . , xp)
deﬁning the mapping M →R.
c) m = n. In this case, in a neighborhood of a regular point a, a mapping f
is bijective. The tangent subspaces Ta(M) and Tb(N) to the manifolds M
and N at the points a and b are of the same dimension, and the mapping
f induces a nondegenerate linear map f∗: Ta(M) →Tb(N) with the
matrix Ma.

1.2
Diﬀerentiable Manifolds
9
Note also that if m < n, then in a neighborhood of a regular point a the
correspondence between the manifolds M and f(M) is bijective.
1.2.3 Exterior Algebra, Pfaﬃan Forms, and the Cartan Lemma.
Let xi be coordinates in a neighborhood of a point a of the manifold M n, and
let f(x) be a diﬀerentiable function deﬁned in this neighborhood. Then the
diﬀerential of this function can be written in the form
df = ∂f
∂xi dxi.
(1.28)
The latter expression is a linear diﬀerential form in a coordinate neighborhood
of the manifold M n. However, this form is of special type because its coeﬃ-
cients are partial derivatives of the function f(x). A linear diﬀerential form of
general type can be written in the form
θ = aidxi.
(1.29)
Its coeﬃcients ai = ai(x) are coordinates of a diﬀerentiable covector ﬁeld
deﬁned on the manifold M n. The set of all linear forms on the manifold M n
is denoted by Λ1(M n).
For the linear forms, the operations of addition and multiplication by a
function can be deﬁned in a natural way. In addition, for two linear forms
θ1 and θ2, the operation of exterior multiplication θ1 ∧θ2 can be deﬁned.
This operation is linear with respect to each factor and is anticommutative:
θ2 ∧θ1 = −θ1 ∧θ2. The product θ1 ∧θ2 is an exterior quadratic form. The
exterior quadratic forms of general type are obtained by means of linear com-
binations of the exterior products of linear forms. The linear operations can
be deﬁned in a natural way in the set of exterior quadratic forms, and this set
is a module over the ring of smooth functions on the manifold M n. This mod-
ule is denoted by Λ2(M n) (see, for example, the book [KN 63] by Kobayashi
and Nomizu, pp. 5–7). The localization of this module over each coordinate
neighborhood U ⊂M n is a free module with
n
2

=
n(n−1)
2
generators. At
each point, the exterior quadratic forms form a vector space Λ2 of dimension
n(n−1)
2
over the ﬁeld of real or complex numbers.
In a similar manner, one can deﬁne the exterior diﬀerential forms of degree
p, p ≤n on the manifold M n, and these forms generate a module Λp(M n)
over the same ring. The localization of this module over each neighborhood
U ⊂M n is a free module of dimension
n
p

.
The multiplication of exterior forms of diﬀerent degrees can be also deﬁned.
If θ1 and θ2 are exterior forms of degrees p and q, respectively, then their
exterior product θ1 ∧θ2 is an exterior form of degree p + q.
This product

10
1. Foundational Material
satisﬁes the following property:
θ1 ∧θ2 = (−1)pqθ2 ∧θ1.
(1.30)
By the skew symmetry, the exterior forms of degree greater than n vanish.
The exterior forms of diﬀerent degrees form the exterior algebra on the
manifold M n:
Λ = Λ0 + Λ1 + Λ2 + . . . + Λn;
(1.31)
here Λp is the module of exterior forms of degree p. In particular, Λ0 is the
ring of diﬀerentiable functions on the manifold M n. Exterior forms of degree
p are also called p-forms, and 1-forms are also called the Pfaﬃan forms.
We now consider an exterior diﬀerential form of degree two on a manifold
M n. In terms of the coordinates xi, this form can be written as
θ = aijdxi ∧dxj, i, j = 1, . . . , n,
where aij = aij(x), aij = −aji, and dxi ∧dxj are the basis 2-forms. A skew-
symmetric bilinear form is associated with the form θ.
The bilinear form
θ(ξ, η),
θ(ξ, η) = aijξiηj,
determines the value of the form θ on a pair of vector ﬁelds ξ and η deﬁned in
T(M n). If these two vector ﬁelds satisfy the equation
θ(ξ, η) = 0,
then we say that they are in involution with respect to the exterior quadratic
form θ. The notion of the value of an exterior p-form on a system consisting of
p vector ﬁelds given on the manifold M n can be deﬁned in a similar manner.
Note further the following proposition of algebraic nature, which is called
the Cartan lemma.
Lemma 1.1 (´E. Cartan). Suppose the linearly independent 1-forms ω1, ω2,
. . . , ωp and the 1-forms θ1, θ2, . . . , θp are connected by the relation
θ1 ∧ω1 + . . . + θp ∧ωp = 0.
(1.32)
Then the forms θa are linearly expressed in terms of the forms ωa as follows:
θa = labωb,
(1.33)
where
lab = lba.
(1.34)

1.2
Diﬀerentiable Manifolds
11
Proof. Because the forms ωa, a = 1, . . . , p, are linearly independent in the
covector space T ∗, by adding the forms ωξ, ξ = p + 1, . . . , n, we complete
ω1, . . . , ωp to a basis for T ∗. Then
θa = labωb + laξωξ.
Substituting this into relation (1.32), we obtain
labωa ∧ωb + ωa ∧laξωξ = 0,
which implies laξ = 0 and lab = lba.
Cartan’s lemma is of pure algebraic nature. But if the forms ωa and θa are
given on a diﬀerentiable manifold M, then Cartan’s lemma is also valid, and
the quantities lab are smooth functions on M.
In the algebra of diﬀerential forms, another operation—the exterior diﬀeren-
tiation—can be deﬁned. For functions, i.e., exterior forms of degree zero, this
operation coincides with ordinary diﬀerentiation, and for exterior forms of type
θ = adxi1 ∧. . . ∧dxip,
(1.35)
this operation is deﬁned by means of the formula:
dθ = da ∧dxi1 ∧. . . ∧dxip.
(1.36)
It is possible to prove that this operation is invariant under the change of
variables (see, for example, Cartan’s book [C 45], p. 34).
The operation of exterior diﬀerentiation deﬁnes a linear mapping of the
space Λp(M n) into the space Λp+1(M n):
d : Λp →Λp+1.
(1.37)
Using formula (1.36), the formula for diﬀerentiation of a product of two exterior
forms can be proved. Namely, if the forms θ1 and θ2 have degrees p and q,
respectively, then
d(θ1 ∧θ2) = dθ1 ∧θ2 + (−1)pθ1 ∧dθ2.
(1.38)
In addition, the following formula holds:
d(dθ) = 0.
(1.39)
This formula is called the Poincar´e lemma. In particular, for a function f on
M n we have d(df) = 0. Conversely, if ω is a 1-form given in a simply connected
domain of a manifold M n and such that dω = 0, then ω = df.

12
1. Foundational Material
A p-form θ satisfying the condition dθ = 0 is called closed, and a p-form
θ satisfying the condition θ = dσ, where σ is a (p −1)-form, is called exact.
Poincar´e’s theorem states that if M n is a p-connected manifold (i.e., in M n
every p-dimensional contour is homotopic to zero), then in M n any closed
p-form is exact. This theorem follows from the p-dimensional Stokes theorem.
Note also that the operation of exterior diﬀerentiation, deﬁned by formula
(1.36) by means of coordinates, does not depend on the choice of coordinates
on the manifold M n, i.e., this operation is invariant; it commutes with the
operation of coordinate transformation on the manifold M n.
1.2.4 The Structure Equations of the General Linear Group. As an
example, we apply the operation of exterior diﬀerentiation to derive the struc-
ture equations of the general linear group GL(n). In Section 1.1.1, invariant
forms for this group were determined for the frame bundle R(Ln) of a vector
space Ln and were written in the form (1.4). Applying exterior diﬀerentiation
to equations (1.4) and using equations (1.36), we obtain
dω = da−1 ∧da.
(1.40)
From relation (1.4) we ﬁnd that
da = aω,
(1.41)
and because aa−1 = I, we have
da−1 = −a−1da · a−1 = −ωa−1.
(1.42)
Substituting expressions (1.41) and (1.42) into equation (1.40), we arrive at
the equation
dω = −ω ∧ω.
(1.43)
In coordinate form, this equation is written as
dωi
j = −ωi
k ∧ωk
j ,
or, more often, as
dωi
j = ωk
j ∧ωi
k.
(1.44)
Equations (1.43) and (1.44) are called the structure equations or the Maurer–
Cartan equations of the general linear group GL(n).
1.2.5 The Frobenius Theorem. Suppose that a system of linearly in-
dependent 1-forms θa, a = p + 1, . . . , n, is given on a manifold M n. At each
point x of the manifold M n, this system determines a linear subspace ∆x of
the space Tx(M n) via the equations
θa(ξ) = 0.
(1.45)

1.2
Diﬀerentiable Manifolds
13
The dimension of this subspace is equal to p. A set of such p-dimensional sub-
spaces ∆p
x given at every point x of the manifold M n is called a p-dimensional
distribution and is denoted by ∆p(M n).
An integral manifold of a system of Pfaﬃan equations
θa = 0
(1.46)
is a submanifold V q of dimension q, q ≤p, whose tangent subspace TxV q at any
point
x
belongs
to
the
element
∆p
x
of
the
distribution
∆p(M n),
TxV q ⊂∆p(M n).
It is easy to prove that the system (1.46) always possesses one-dimensional
integral manifolds.
If the system has integral manifolds of maximal possi-
ble dimension p which form a foliation on the manifold M n, then we say
that the system is completely integrable. This means that through any point
x ∈M n, there passes a unique p-dimensional integral manifold V p of the sys-
tem (1.46).
A necessary and suﬃcient condition for a system (1.46) to be
completely integrable is given by the Frobenius theorem (see Kobayashi and
Nomizu [KN 63], vol. 2, p. 323).
Theorem 1.2 (Frobenius). System (1.46) is completely integrable if and only
if the exterior diﬀerentials of the forms θa vanish by means of the equations of
this system.
Analytically this can be written as follows:
dθa = θb ∧θa
b ,
(1.47)
where θa
b are some new 1-forms.
Note that structure equations (1.44) of the general linear group GL(n),
which we found earlier, are conditions of complete integrability for the system
of equations (1.8) deﬁning the inﬁnitesimal displacement of a frame of the
space Ln.
Note also that if a system of forms ωi
j is given and it depends on ρ ≤n2
parameters and satisﬁes structure equations (1.44), then by Frobenius’ theo-
rem, this system uniquely (up to a transformation of the general linear group
GL(n)) determines a ρ-parameter family of frames Rρ in the space Ln.
1.2.6 The Cartan Test. If system (1.46) is not completely integrable,
then it could still possess integral manifolds of dimension q < p.
We say
that the system of Pfaﬃan equations (1.46) is in involution if at least one two-
dimensional integral manifold V 2 passes through each one-dimensional integral
manifold V 1 of this system, at least one three-dimensional integral manifold
V 3 passes through each of its two-dimensional integral manifolds V 2, etc., and

14
1. Foundational Material
ﬁnally, at least one integral manifold V q of dimension q passes through each
integral manifold V q−1 of dimension q −1.
Later we will often apply the Cartan test for the system of Pfaﬃan equa-
tions (1.46) to be in involution.
To formulate the Cartan test, ﬁrst, we note that if V q is an integral manifold
of system (1.46), then on this manifold not only system (1.46) vanishes but
also the system
dθa = 0.
(1.48)
A q-dimensional subspace ∆q
x tangent to the integral manifold V q is character-
ized by the fact that each of its vectors satisﬁes every equation of system (1.46),
and each pair of its vectors is in involution relative to the exterior quadratic
forms dθa, i.e., the pair satisﬁes system (1.48). These vectors are called the
one-dimensional integral elements of system (1.46).
Let ξ1 be a one-dimensional integral element of system (1.46).
A two-
dimensional integral element passing through element ξ1 is determined by a
vector ξ2 that, in addition to the system of equations (1.45), together with ξ1
satisfy the system
dθa(ξ1, ξ2) = 0.
(1.49)
If the vector ξ1 is held ﬁxed, system (1.49) is a linear homogeneous system for
ﬁnding ξ2. Denote the rank of this system by r1. Suppose that ξ2 is a solution
of system (1.49). The vectors ξ1 and ξ2 determine a two-dimensional integral
element E2 of system (1.46). To ﬁnd a three-dimensional integral element of
this system, we should consider the system
dθa(ξ1, ξ3) = 0, dθa(ξ2, ξ3) = 0.
(1.50)
Each vector ξ3 satisfying equations (1.50), together with the vectors ξ1 and
ξ2, determines a three-dimensional integral element E3. Denote the rank of
system (1.50) by r2. Similarly we can construct integral elements E4, . . . , Eq.
They are connected by the relation
ξ1 = E1 ⊂E2 ⊂E3 ⊂. . . ⊂Eq.
Denote by rk the rank of the system of type (1.50) deﬁning a vector ξk+1,
which is in involution with the previously deﬁned vectors ξ1, . . . , ξk, and let
s1 = r1, s2 = r2 −r1, . . . , sq−1 = rq−1 −rq−2.
Let sq be the dimension of the subspace deﬁned by a system of type (1.50)
for ﬁnding a vector ξq. The integers s1, s2, . . . , sq are called the characters of
system (1.46), and the integer
Q = s1 + 2s2 + . . . + qsq

1.2
Diﬀerentiable Manifolds
15
is called its Cartan number. The characters of the Pfaﬃan system (1.46) are
connected by the inequalities
s1 ≥s2 ≥. . . ≥sq.
(1.51)
The left-hand sides of equations (1.48) are exterior products of some linear
forms from which q forms are linearly independent and are the basis forms of
the integral manifold V q. Let us denote these 1-forms by ωa, a = 1, . . . , q. In
addition, equations (1.48) contain forms ωu whose number is equal to s1 +s2 +
. . . + sq. Applying the procedure outlined in the proof of the Cartan lemma,
one can express the forms ωu as linear combinations of the forms ωa. The
number of independent coeﬃcients in these linear combinations is called the
arbitrariness of the general integral element and is denoted by the letter S.
If the manifold M and the distribution ∆p(M) deﬁned on M by the system
of equations (1.46) are real analytic, then the following theorem is valid:
Theorem 1.3 (´E. Cartan’s Test). For a system of Pfaﬃan equations (1.46)
to be in involution, it is necessary and suﬃcient that the condition Q = S holds.
Moreover, its q-dimensional integral manifold V q depends on sk functions of
k variables, where sk is the last nonvanishing character in sequence (1.51).
Note also that if system (1.46) of Pfaﬃan equations is not in involution, this
does not mean that the system has no solution. The further investigation of this
system is connected with its successive diﬀerential prolongations. Moreover, it
can be proved that after a ﬁnite number of prolongations one obtains either a
system in involution—and in this case there exists a solution of system (1.46)—
or arrives at a contradiction proving that the system has no solution.
The reader can ﬁnd a more detailed exposition of the theory of systems of
Pfaﬃan equations in involution in the books [BCGGG 91] by Bryant, Chern,
Gardner, Goldsmith, and Griﬃths; [C 45] by Cartan; [Fi 48] by Finikov; [Gr 83]
by Griﬃths; [GJ 87] by Griﬃths and Jensen; and [AG 93] by Akivis and
Goldberg. Examples of application of Cartan’s test can be found in the rest of
this book.
1.2.7 The Structure Equations of a Diﬀerentiable Manifold. Let
us ﬁnd the structure equations of a diﬀerentiable manifold M n. As we have
already noted, if a diﬀerentiable function f(x) is given on the manifold M n,
then in local coordinates xi, the diﬀerential of this function can be written in
form (1.28). The operators
∂
∂xi of diﬀerentiation with respect to the coordi-
nates xi form a basis of the tangent space Tx(M n), called the natural basis.
We view the diﬀerentials dxi as the coordinates of a tangent vector d =
∂
∂xi dxi
with respect to this basis. If we replace the natural basis { ∂
∂xi } by an arbitrary

16
1. Foundational Material
basis {ei} of the space Tx(M n):
ei = xj
i
∂
∂xj ,
∂
∂xi = xj
iej,
(1.52)
where (xj
i) and (xj
i) are mutually inverse matrices, then we can expand the
vector d as
d = ejxj
idxi = ωjej,
(1.53)
where we used the notation
ωj = xj
idxi,
i, j = 1, . . . , n.
(1.54)
The forms ωj are called the basis forms of the manifold M n.
Taking exterior derivatives of equations (1.54), we obtain
dωi = dxi
j ∧dxj.
(1.55)
Eliminating the diﬀerentials dxj by means of relations (1.54) from equations
(1.55), we arrive at the equations:
dωi = dxi
k ∧xk
j ωj.
(1.56)
Equations (1.56) imply that
dωi = ωj ∧ωi
j,
(1.57)
where the forms ωi
j are not uniquely deﬁned. In fact, subtracting (1.56) from
(1.57), we ﬁnd that
ωj ∧(ωi
j + xk
j dxi
k) = 0.
Applying the Cartan lemma to these equations, we obtain the equations
ωi
j + xk
j dxi
k = xi
jkωk
or
ωi
j = −xk
j dxi
k + xi
jkωk,
(1.58)
where xi
jk = xi
kj.
Equations (1.57) are the ﬁrst set of structure equations of the manifold M n.
By the Frobenius theorem, it follows from equations (1.57) that the system of
equations ωi = 0 is completely integrable. The ﬁrst integrals of this system
are the coordinates xi of a point x of the manifold M n.

1.2
Diﬀerentiable Manifolds
17
Let us ﬁnd the second set of the structure equations of the manifold M n,
which are satisﬁed by the forms ωi
j. Exterior diﬀerentiation of equations (1.58)
leads to the equations
dωi
j = −dxk
j ∧dxi
k + dxi
jk ∧ωk + xi
jkωl ∧ωk
l .
(1.59)
The entries of the matrices (xj
i) and (xj
i) are connected by the relation
xk
j xi
k = δi
j.
If we diﬀerentiate this relation, we ﬁnd that
dxk
j = −xk
qxl
jdxq
l .
Substituting these expressions for dxk
j into equations (1.59) and using relations
(1.58), we ﬁnd that
dωi
j = ωk
j ∧ωi
k + (∇xi
jk + xp
jlxi
pkωl) ∧ωk,
(1.60)
where ∇xi
jk are deﬁned according to the rule (1.15). Deﬁne also the 1-forms
ωi
jk = ∇xi
jk + xp
jlxi
pkωl + xi
jklωl,
(1.61)
where xi
jkl = xi
jlk. Using these equations, we can write equations (1.60) as
dωi
j = ωk
j ∧ωi
k + ωi
jk ∧ωk.
(1.62)
These equations form the second set of structure equations of the manifold
M n.
Using the same procedure we just used to deﬁne the forms ωi, ωi
j, and ωi
jk
on the diﬀerentiable manifold M n and to ﬁnd structure equations for these
forms, we can deﬁne higher-order forms ωi
jkl, . . . and ﬁnd structure equations
for them (see Laptev [Lap 66]). However, in this book we will not need these
higher-order forms and equations.
As we already noted, the forms ωi are basis forms of the manifold M n. The
forms ωi
j are the ﬁber forms of the bundle R1(M n) of frames of ﬁrst order over
M n, and the forms ωi
jk, together with the forms ωi
j, are the ﬁber forms of the
bundle R2(M n) of frames of second order over M n. The ﬁbers R1
x and R2
x of
these two ﬁbrations are deﬁned on the manifolds R1(M n) and R2(M n) by the
equations ωi = 0.
We denote by δ the restriction of the diﬀerential d to the ﬁbers R1
x and R2
x
of the frame bundles under consideration. Let us also denote the restrictions

18
1. Foundational Material
of the forms ωi
j and ωi
jk to these bundles by πi
j = ωi
j(δ) and πi
jk = ωi
jk(δ)
respectively. Then it follows from equations (1.62) that
δπi
j = πk
j ∧πi
k.
(1.63)
Equations (1.63) coincide with the structure equations (1.44) of the general
linear group GL(n).
Thus, the forms πi
j are invariant forms of the group
GL(n) of admissible transformations of the ﬁrst-order frames {ei} associated
with a point x of the manifold M n, and the ﬁber R1
x is diﬀeomorphic to this
group. This ﬁber is an orbit of a vector of a representation space of the group
GL(n).
This and relations (1.5) show that if ωi = 0, the vectors ei composing a
frame in the space Tx(M n) satisfy the equations
δei = πj
i ej,
and the forms ωi composing a coframe satisfy the equations
δωi = −πi
jωj.
(1.64)
Next, consider the forms πi
jk = ωi
jk(δ). Relations (1.61) imply that
πi
jk = ∇δxi
jk,
and thus πi
jk = πi
kj. It is not so diﬃcult to show that the forms πi
jk satisfy the
following structure equations
δπi
jk = πl
jk ∧πi
l + πl
j ∧πi
lk + πl
k ∧πi
jl
(see Laptev [Lap 66]) and that these forms together with the forms πi
j are
invariant forms of the group GL2(n) of admissible transformations of the
second-order frames associated with the point x ∈M n. The group GL2(n) is
diﬀeomorphic to the ﬁber R2
x.
1.2.8 Aﬃne Connections on a Diﬀerentiable Manifold.
In what
follows we will use the notion of an aﬃne connection in a frame bundle. An
aﬃne connection γ on a manifold M n is deﬁned in the frame bundle R2(M n)
by means of an invariant horizontal distribution ∆deﬁned by a system of
Pfaﬃan forms
θi
j = ωi
j −Γi
jkωk
(1.65)
vanishing on ∆. The distribution ∆is invariant with respect to the group of
aﬃne transformations acting in R1(M n).

1.3
Projective Space
19
Using equations (1.65), we eliminate the forms ωi
j from equations (1.57).
As a result, we obtain
dωi = ωj ∧θi
j + Ri
jkωj ∧ωk,
(1.66)
where Ri
jk = Γi
[jk]. The condition for the distribution ∆to be invariant leads
to the following equations:
dθi
j = θk
j ∧θi
k + Ri
jklωk ∧ωl.
(1.67)
The Pfaﬃan forms θ = (θi
j) with their values in the Lie algebra gl(n) of the
group GL(n) are called the connection forms of the connection γ.
The quantities Ri
jk and Ri
jkl form tensors called the torsion tensor and the
curvature tensor of the connection γ, respectively.
Conversely, one can prove that if in the frame bundle R2(M n), the forms θi
j
are given, and these forms together with the forms ωi satisfy equations (1.66)
and (1.67), then the forms θi
j deﬁne an aﬃne connection γ on M n, and the
tensors Ri
jk and Ri
jkl are the torsion and curvature tensors of this connection
γ.
As a rule, in our considerations the torsion-free aﬃne connections will arise
for which Ri
jk = 0. For these connections, the form ω = (ωi
j) can be chosen as
a connection form. Under this assumption, the structure equations (1.66) and
(1.67) can be written in the form
dωi = ωj ∧ωi
j, dωi
j = ωk
j ∧ωi
k + Ri
jklωk ∧ωl.
(1.68)
A more detailed presentation of the foundations of the theory of aﬃne
connections can be found in the books [KN 63] by Kobayashi and Nomizu and
[Lich 55] by Lichnerowicz (see also the papers [Lap 66, 69] by Laptev).
1.3
Projective Space
1.3.1 Projective Transformations, Projective Frames, and the Struc-
ture Equations of a Projective Space.
We assume that the reader is
familiar with the notions of the projective plane and the three-dimensional
projective space. These notions can be generalized for the multidimensional
case in a natural way (see Dieudonn´e [Di 64]).
Consider an (n + 1)-dimensional vector space Ln+1. Denote by Ln+1 the
set of all nonzero vectors of the space Ln+1. We consider collinear vectors
of Ln+1 to be equivalent and deﬁne the n-dimensional projective space Pn as
the quotient of the set Ln+1 by this equivalence relation: Pn = Ln+1/{0}.

20
1. Foundational Material
This means that a point of Pn is a collection of nonzero collinear vectors λx of
Ln+1, i.e., a point of Pn is a one-dimensional subspace of Ln+1. A straight line
of Pn is a two-dimensional subspace of Ln+1, etc. If in Ln+1 a basis deﬁned
by the vectors e0, e1, . . . , en is given, then any vector x ̸= 0 of Ln+1 can be
decomposed relative to this basis:
x = x0e0 + x1e1 + . . . + xnen,
where the numbers x0, x1, . . . , xn are the coordinates of the vector x rela-
tive to the basis {ei}.
In the space Ln+1, a set of collinear vectors corre-
sponds to the point x of Pn, and the coordinates of this set are the numbers
(λx0, λx1, . . . , λxn), where λ ̸= 0. These numbers are called the homogeneous
coordinates of the point x ∈Pn. Note that they are unique up to a multiplica-
tive factor.
Linear transformations of the space Ln+1 give rise to corresponding pro-
jective transformations of the space Pn. Under these transformations, straight
lines are transformed into straight lines, planes into planes, etc. Because a
point in Pn is deﬁned by homogeneous coordinates, transformations of the
form
yu = ρxu, ρ ̸= 0, u = 0, 1, . . . , n,
deﬁne the identity transformation of the space Pn. Thus, the projective trans-
formations can be written as
ρyu = au
vxv, ρ ̸= 0, u, v = 0, 1, . . . , n,
where det(au
v) ̸= 0. Therefore, the group of projective transformations of the
space Pn depends on (n+1)2 −1 = n2 +2n parameters. This group is denoted
by PGL(n).
A projective frame in the space Pn is a system consisting of n + 1 points
Au, u = 0, 1, . . . , n, and a unity point E, which are in general position. In the
space Ln+1, to the points Au there correspond linearly independent vectors
eu, and the vector e = n
u=0 eu corresponds to the point E. These vectors are
deﬁned in Ln+1 up to a common factor. It follows that the set of projective
frames {Au} depends on n2 + 2n parameters. We shall assume that the unity
point E is given along with the basis points Au, although we might not mention
it on every occasion.
We will perform the linear operations on points of a projective space Pn
via the corresponding vectors in the space Ln+1.
These operations will be
invariant in Pn if we multiply all corresponding vectors in Ln+1 by a common
factor.

1.3
Projective Space
21
In some instances, we assume that a vectorial frame in Ln+1 is normalized
by the condition
e0 ∧e1 ∧. . . ∧en =

±1
for odd n,
1
for even n,
(1.69)
where the wedge denotes the exterior product. Condition (1.69) can always
be achieved by multiplying all vectors of the frame by an appropriate factor.1
Hence the group PGL(n) is isomorphic to the quotient group SL(n + 1)/C2,
where C2 = {1, −1} is the cyclic group of the second degree.
When such a normalization has been done, the vectors of a frame in Ln+1
corresponding to the point of a projective frame {Au} are uniquely determined.
Thus, the group of projective transformations of the space Pn is isomorphic to
the special linear group SL(n + 1) of transformations of Ln+1. Sometimes we
will write the normalization condition (1.69) in the form
A0 ∧A1 ∧. . . ∧An = ±1.
(1.70)
The equations of inﬁnitesimal displacement of a frame in Pn have the same
form (1.5) as in Ln:
dAu = ωv
uAv,
(1.71)
but now the indices u and v take the values from 0 to n, and by condition
(1.70), the forms ωv
u in equations (1.71) are connected by the relation
ω0
0 + ω1
1 + . . . + ωn
n = 0.
(1.72)
This condition shows that the number of linearly independent forms ωv
u be-
comes equal to the number of parameters on which the group PGL(n) of
projective transformations of the space Pn depends.
The structure equations of the space Pn have the same form as they had
in the space Ln:
dωu
v = ωw
v ∧ωu
w,
(1.73)
but now we have a new range for the indices u, v and w: u, v, w = 0, 1 . . . , n.
It is well known that a projective space Pn is a diﬀerentiable manifold. Let
us show that equations (1.73) are a particular case of the structure equations
(1.57) and (1.62) of a diﬀerentiable manifold.
To show this, ﬁrst we write
equations (1.73) for v = 0 and u = i, where i = 1, . . . , n, in the form
dωi
0 = ωj
0 ∧θi
j,
1If we multiply all the vectors e0, e1, . . . , en by λ, then the determinant is multiplied by
λn+1. Thus if n is odd, then it is impossible to change the determinant sign.

22
1. Foundational Material
where θi
j = ωi
j −δi
jω0
0. These equations diﬀer from equations (1.57) only in no-
tation. Next, taking exterior derivatives of the forms θi
j and applying equations
(1.73), we ﬁnd that
dθi
j = θk
j ∧θi
k + (δi
kω0
j + δi
jω0
k) ∧ωk
0.
Comparing these equations with equations (1.62), we observe that they coin-
cide if
ωi
jk = δi
kω0
j + δi
jω0
k.
The latter relations prove that if a ﬁrst-order frame is held ﬁxed, the second-
order frames of a projective space Pn depend on n parameters while on a
general diﬀerentiable manifold they depend on n3 parameters.
Note that the forms ωi
0 constitute a basis in the cotangent space T ∗
x(Pn) of
a projective space Pn. The corresponding basis in the tangent space Tx(Pn) is
formed by the vectors vi which are directed along the lines A0Ai (see Griﬃths
and Harris [GH 79]). In what follows, we will denote the forms ωi
0 by ωi.
1.3.2 The Duality Principle.
Consider a hyperplane ξ in Pn.
The
equations of this hyperplane can be written in the form
ξuxu = 0, u = 0, 1, . . . , n,
(1.74)
where the coeﬃcients ξu are deﬁned up to a constant factor. These coeﬃcients
can be viewed as homogeneous coordinates of the hyperplane ξ. They are called
the tangential coordinates of the hyperplane ξ. This consideration shows that
the collection of hyperplanes of a projective space Pn is a new projective space
of the same dimension n. This space is denoted by (Pn)∗and called dual to
the space Pn.
Equation (1.74) is the condition of the incidence of a point x with coor-
dinates xu and a hyperplane ξ = (ξu). Denote the left-hand side of equation
(1.74) by (ξ, x). Then we can write it in the form
(ξ, x) = 0.
(1.75)
Equation (1.75) shows that the spaces Pn and (Pn)∗are mutually dual, that
is, the space Pn is dual to the space (Pn)∗,
((Pn)∗)∗= Pn.
The passage from the space Pn to the space (Pn)∗(or back from (Pn)∗
to Pn) is called the duality principle.
Let Pm ⊂Pn be an m-dimensional
subspace of the space Pn. Then Pm is spanned by m + 1 linearly indepen-
dent points M0, M1, . . . , Mm.
By the duality principle, to every point Mi,

1.3
Projective Space
23
i = 0, 1, . . . , m, there corresponds a hyperplane µi. Hence to a subspace Pm
there corresponds in (Pn)∗a subspace of dimension n −m −1, which is the
intersection of hyperplanes µi. Therefore, (Pm)∗= Pn−m−1 = µ0∧µ1∧. . .∧µm.
If in the space Pn we have P1 ⊂P2 ⊂Pn, then in (Pn)∗we have
P ∗
2 ⊂P ∗
1 ⊂(Pn)∗.
This means that the duality principle reverses the in-
cidence of subspaces in the spaces Pn and (Pn). Thus, to each theorem of
projective geometry and to any conﬁguration composed from subspaces of the
space Pn, there corresponds a dual theorem and conﬁguration in the space
(Pn)∗(see Rosenfeld [Ro 97], p. 135).
The mapping C of the space Pn to the space (Pn)∗preserving the incidence
of subspaces is called the correlation, C : Pn →(Pn)∗, where ξ = Cx is a
nondegenerate linear mapping. In a frame {Au}, u = 0, . . . , n, of the space
Pn, the correlation C can be written in the form
ξu = cuvxv, det(cuv) ̸= 0,
(1.76)
where xv are point coordinates and ξu are tangential coordinates in Pn.
In the space (Pn)∗, let us choose a coframe consisting of n + 1 hyperplanes
αu connected with the points of the frame {Au} by the following condition:
(αu, Av) = δu
v .
(1.77)
This coframe is called dual to the frame {Au}. Condition (1.77) means that
the hyperplane αu contains all points Av, v ̸= u, and that the condition of
normalization (αu, Au) = 1 holds.
We write the equations of inﬁnitesimal displacement of the tangential frame
{αu} in the form
dαu = ωu
v αv, u, v = 0, 1, . . . , n.
(1.78)
Diﬀerentiating relations (1.77) and using equations (1.71), (1.78), and (1.77),
we arrive at the equations
ωu
v + ωu
v = 0,
from which it follows that equations (1.78) take the form
dαu = −ωu
v αv.
(1.79)
The structure equations (1.73) are the conditions for complete integrability
of both equations (1.71) of inﬁnitesimal displacement of a point frame and
equations (1.79) of inﬁnitesimal displacement of a tangential frame.
Thus,
if the 1-forms ωu
v depend on some number ρ, ρ ≤n2 + n, of parameters,
and satisfy structure equations (1.73), then in the space Pn, they deﬁne a
ρ-parameter family of frames, up to a projective transformation of Pn. The

24
1. Foundational Material
location of this family of frames is completely determined by the location of a
frame corresponding to initial values of parameters. Conversely, if in Pn a fam-
ily of projective frames that depends on ρ parameters is given, then the com-
ponents ωu
v of inﬁnitesimal displacement of this family are unchanged under
its projective transformation. Similarly, the 1-forms ωu
v deﬁne a ρ-parameter
family of coframes {αu}, up to a projective transformation. Hence, the forms
ωu
v are invariant forms with respect to transformations of the projective group.
1.3.3 Projectivization. In what follows, we will often use a special con-
struction called the projectivization.
Let Pn be a projective space of dimension n, and let Pm be a subspace
of dimension m, where 0 ≤m < n.
We say that two points x, y ∈Pn,
x, y /∈Pm, are in the relation Pm and write this as xPmy if the straight line
xy intersects the subspace Pm. It is easy to check that the introduced relation
is an equivalence relation. Thus, the points in the relation Pm are called Pm-
equivalent. This equivalence relation divides all points of the space Pn into
the equivalence classes in such a way that all points of an (m + 1)-plane Pm+1
containing the subspace Pm belong to one class.
The equivalence relation introduced above allows us to factorize the space
Pn by this relation. The resulting quotient space Pn/Pm is called the projec-
tivization of Pn with the center Pm and denoted by Pn−m−1:
Pn−m−1 = Pn/Pm.
Sometimes the quotient space Pn/Pm is called the factorization of Pn with
respect to Pm. The projectivization Pn−m−1 is a projective space of dimension
n −m −1. Let us take a basis in Pn in such a way that its points Ai, i =
0, 1, . . . , m, belong to the center Pm of projectivization.
Then the basis of
the space Pn−m−1 is formed by the points Aα = Aα/P m, α = m + 1, . . . , n.
Because the center Pm is unchanged under projectivization, the equations of
inﬁnitesimal displacement of the frame {Ai, Aα} of the space Pn can be written
in the form
dAi = ωj
i Aj, dAα = ωβ
αAβ + ωi
αAi.
Thus, in this family of frames we have ωα
i = 0. Hence, the structure equations
(1.73) of a projective space Pn imply that
dωβ
α = ωγ
α ∧ωβ
γ .
(1.80)
This allows us to consider the forms ωβ
α as the components of inﬁnitesimal
displacement of the frame { Aα} of the projectivization Pn−m−1, so that
d Aα = ωβ
α Aβ.

1.3
Projective Space
25
On some occasions, we will identify the points Aα of the projectivization
Pn−m−1 with the points Aα of the projective space Pn.
Note that one can also consider the projectivization of a vector space Lm by
its 0-dimensional subspace {0}. The result of this projectivization is the sub-
space Pm−1 = Lm/{0}.
Actually, in the deﬁnition of the projective space
Pn itself (see Section 1.3.1), we already used the projectivization, so that
Pn = Ln+1/{0}.
1.3.4 Classical Homogeneous Spaces (Aﬃne, Euclidean, Non-Eu-
clidean) and Their Transformations.
As was noted in the Preface, a
projective space can be used to represent all classical homogeneous spaces:
aﬃne, Euclidean, non-Euclidean, conformal, and other spaces. To do this, one
ﬁxes certain invariant objects in a projective space Pn and reduces the group
of transformations of the space by requiring that they be invariant. Now we
show how this can be carried out for the basic homogeneous spaces.
An aﬃne space An is a projective space Pn in which a hyperplane α is
ﬁxed.
This hyperplane is called the ideal hyperplane or the hyperplane at
inﬁnity (or the improper hyperplane). The aﬃne transformations are those
projective transformations that transform this hyperplane into itself. Straight
lines of the space Pn that intersect the ideal hyperplane at the same point are
called parallel straight lines of the space An. Two-dimensional planes of Pn
intersecting the ideal hyperplane along the same straight line are called parallel
2-planes of the space An, etc.
As a frame in the space An, it is natural to take a projective frame whose
points A1, . . . , An lie in the ideal hyperplane α. The equations of inﬁnitesimal
displacement of such a frame have the form

dA0 =
ω0
0A0+
ωi
0Ai,
dAi =
ωj
i Aj, i, j = 1, . . . , n.
(1.81)
Equations (1.81) show that in this case the forms ω0
i in equations (1.71) are
equal to zero: ω0
i = 0. This and structure equations (1.73) imply that dω0
0 = 0.
Thus, the form ω0
0 is a total diﬀerential: ω0
0 = d log |λ|. Substituting this value
of the form ω0
0 into the ﬁrst equation of (1.81), we ﬁnd that
dA0 = dλ
λ A0 + ωi
0Ai.
It follows that
d
A0
λ

= ωi
0
Ai
λ .
(1.82)
If we set
A0
λ = x,
Ai
λ = ei,
(1.83)

26
1. Foundational Material
then equation (1.82) can be written as
dx = ωi
0ei.
(1.84)
Diﬀerentiating the second equation of (1.83), we obtain
dei = θj
i ej,
(1.85)
where
θj
i = ωj
i −δj
i d ln |λ|.
We may consider the point x as the vertex of an aﬃne frame and the vectors ei
as its basis vectors. Equations (1.84) and (1.85) are the equations of inﬁnites-
imal displacement of this aﬃne frame {x, ei}. These equations contain n + n2
linearly independent forms ωi
0 and θj
i . This corresponds to the fact that the
group of aﬃne transformations of the space An depends on n+n2 parameters.
The forms ωi
0 determine a parallel displacement of the frame, and the forms
θj
i determine the isotropy transformations of this frame, which keep the point
x invariant.
The structure equations of the space An can be obtained from equations
(1.73). In fact, we derive from those equations that
dωi
0 = ω0
0 ∧ωi
0 + ωj
0 ∧ωi
j = ωj
0 ∧θi
j,
dθi
j = dωi
j = ωk
j ∧ωi
k = θk
j ∧θi
k.
As a result, the structure equations of the aﬃne space An have the form



dωi
0 = ωj
0 ∧θi
j,
dθi
j = θk
j ∧θi
k.
(1.86)
These equations imply that the isotropy transformations form an invariant
subgroup in the group of aﬃne transformations of the space An, and this sub-
group is isomorphic to the general linear group GL(n). In addition, equations
(1.86) imply that the parallel displacements form a subgroup that is not an
invariant subgroup.
A Euclidean space En is obtained from an aﬃne space An if in the ideal hy-
perplane of the latter space a nondegenerate imaginary quadric Q of dimension
n −2 is ﬁxed. The equations of this quadric Q can be written in the form
x0 = 0,
n

i=1
(xi)2 = 0.
(1.87)

1.3
Projective Space
27
The Euclidean transformations are those aﬃne transformations that transform
this quadric into itself.
The quadric Q allows us to deﬁne the scalar product (a, b) of vectors a and
b in the Euclidean space En. If we take vectors of a frame in such a way that
(ei, ej) = δij
(1.88)
(here δij is the Kronecker symbol: δii = 1 and δij = 0 if i ̸= j), then the forms
θi
j from equations (1.85) are connected by the relations
θj
i + θi
j = 0,
(1.89)
which are obtained by diﬀerentiating equations (1.88). The number of inde-
pendent forms in equations (1.84) and (1.85) is now equal to n + 1
2n(n −1) =
1
2n(n+1). This number coincides with the number of parameters on which the
group of motions of space En depends. The structure equations of the space
En still have the form (1.86).
A non-Euclidean space is a projective space Pn in which a nondegenerate
invariant hyperquadric
Q(X, X) = guvxuxv = 0, u, v = 0, 1, . . . , n,
(1.90)
is ﬁxed. Suppose for deﬁniteness that a non-Euclidean space is elliptic, i.e. the
hyperquadric Q(X, X) is positive deﬁnite. Then we may choose the points of a
projective frame {Au} in such a way that they form an autopolar simplex with
respect to this hyperquadric, and we normalize the vertices of this simplex.
This means that we have
Q(Au, Av) = δuv,
(1.91)
and the forms ωv
u from equations (1.71) satisfy the equations
ωv
u + ωu
v = 0.
(1.92)
The elliptic transformations are those projective transformations of the space
Pn that preserve the hyperquadric Q.
These transformations depend on
1
2n(n + 1) parameters, and the latter number coincides with the number of
independent forms among the forms ωu
v .
If the hyperquadric Q is of signature (1, n), then it deﬁnes the hyperbolic
geometry in Pn, which is also called the Lobachevsky geometry.

Specializations of Moving Frames
1.4.1 The First Specialization. In our study of the structure of subman-
ifolds in a projective space, we will often apply the method of specialization
of moving frames. The idea of this method is that from all projective frames
associated with an element of a submanifold, we will take the frames that
are most closely connected with the element and its diﬀerential neighborhood
of a certain order. Such a specialization can be conducted analytically and
geometrically.
Consider, for example, how the method of specialization of moving frames
applies in the study of geometry of a curve on a projective plane. In this study,
we will use both geometric and analytic variations of this method.
Let Γ be a smooth simple connected curve in the projective plane P2. A
moving frame in P2 consists of three points A0, A1, and A2 that do not belong
to a straight line. The equations of inﬁnitesimal displacements of such a frame
have the form
dAu = ωv
uAv,
u, v = 0, 1, 2,
(1.93)
where ωv
u are diﬀerential 1-forms satisfying the structure equations of the plane
P2:
dωv
u = ωw
u ∧ωv
w,
u, v, w = 0, 1, 2
(1.94)
(cf. equations (1.71) and (1.73)).
We assume that the family of projective frames in P2 is normalized by the
condition
A0 ∧A1 ∧A2 = 1
(1.95)
(cf. equation (1.70)). Diﬀerentiating (1.95) with the help of (1.93) and using
the fact that the points A0, A1, and A2 are linearly independent, we obtain
that
ω0
0 + ω1
1 + ω2
2 = 0
(1.96)
(cf. equation (1.72)).
First, we apply two geometric specializations of the moving frame. Suppose
that A0 = x ∈Γ and locate the point A1 on the tangent Tx(Γ) to Γ at the
point x, A1 ∈Tx(Γ). Then we have
dA0 = ω0
0A0 + ω1
0A1.
(1.97)
Comparing (1.97) with the ﬁrst equation of (1.93), we see that
ω2
0 = 0.
(1.98)
The form ω1
0 is a basis form on the curve Γ: if ω1
0 = 0, then the point A0
is a ﬁxed point on Γ. This form ω1
0 is proportional to the diﬀerential du of a

1.4

29
parameter u moving the point x = A0 along Γ: ω1
0 = αdu. The parameter u
is called the principal parameter.
Taking the exterior derivative of equation (1.98) with the help of (1.94), we
obtain the exterior quadratic equation
ω1
0 ∧ω2
1 = 0,
which by Cartan’s lemma implies that
ω2
1 = b2ω1
0.
(1.99)
Note that the coeﬃcient b2 is deﬁned in a second-order diﬀerential neighbor-
hood of the point x. In what follows, the subindex will denote an order of a
neighborhood in which an object in question is deﬁned.
If b2 = 0 at all points of Γ, then
dA0 = ω0
0A0 + ω1
0A1, dA1 = ω0
1A0 + ω1
1A1,
and
d(A0 ∧A1) = (ω0
0 + ω1
1)(A0 ∧A1),
and the curve Γ becomes the straight line A0 ∧A1. In what follows, we will
assume that
b2 ̸= 0,
(1.100)
i.e., that the curve Γ is not a straight line.
For the next specialization of the moving frame, we apply the analytic
method. Taking the exterior derivative of (1.99) with the help of (1.94) and
(1.96), we obtain the exterior quadratic equation
(db2 −3b2ω1
1) ∧ω1
0 = 0,
which by Cartan’s lemma implies that
db2 −3b2ω1
1 = b3ω1
0.
(1.101)
If we ﬁx A0 on Γ (i.e., if we set ω1
0 = 0), we ﬁnd that
δb2 −3b2π1
1 = 0,
(1.102)
where πj
i = ωj
i |ω1
0=0 and δ is the symbol diﬀerentiation with respect to the
secondary parameters (i.e., the parameters that move a frame when the point
x = A0 is held ﬁxed).
By (1.100), it follows from (1.102) that
δ log b2 = 3π1
1.
(1.103)

30
1. Foundational Material
If we ﬁx all secondary parameters except φ2, in terms of the diﬀerential of
which the secondary form 3π1
1 is expressed, we obtain
3π1
1 = δ log φ2.
(1.104)
Here we used the fact that the diﬀerential of a function of one variable is always
a total diﬀerential. By (1.104), equation (1.103) takes the form
δ log b2 = δ log φ2.
It follows that
b2 = E2φ2,
where E2 = const. Because φ2 takes arbitrary values, we can take
φ2 = 1
E2
.
As a result, we get
b2 = 1,
(1.105)
and (1.99) takes the form
ω2
1 = ω1
0.
(1.106)
Note that we could take φ2 = −1
E2 , and as a result we could have b2 = −1
and
ω2
1 = −ω1
0.
(1.107)
Note that if we change the orientation of the curve Γ, i.e., if we change du to
−du, we come again to equations (1.105) and (1.106). In what follows, we will
assume that specialization (1.105) takes place.
By (1.105), equation (1.101) takes the form
−3ω1
1 = b3ω1
0.
(1.108)
Taking the exterior derivative of equation (1.108), we obtain the exterior
quadratic equation
[db3 + b3(ω0
0 −ω1
1) + 3(ω0
1 −ω1
2)] ∧ω1
0 = 0,
which by Cartan’s lemma implies that
db3 + b3(ω0
0 −ω1
1) + 3(ω0
1 −ω1
2) = (3b4 −(b3)2)ω1
0.
(1.109)
1.4.2 Power Series Expansion of an Equation of a Curve. Before go-
ing to further frame specializations, we will clarify the meaning of the functions
b2, b3, and b4. First, we ﬁnd the conditions for a point
M = x0A0 + x1A1 + x2A2
(1.110)

1.4

in the plane P2 to be ﬁxed. Such a condition is
dM = θM,
(1.111)
where θ is a 1-form. By (1.93) and linear independence of the vertices Au of
our moving frame, it follows from (1.111) that

dx2 + x0ω2

(1.112)
For nonhomogeneous coordinates

(1.113)
Suppose that the curve Γ is given by an equation
y = f(x).
(1.114)
If we place the origin (0, 0) to a regular point of Γ, then the right-hand side of
(1.114) can be expanded into the MacLauren series:
y = a1x + 1
2!a2x2 + 1
3!a3x3 + . . . =
∞

n=1
1
n!anxn.
(1.115)
Because we placed the point A1 on the tangent Tx(Γ) to Γ at the point
x, the equation of the tangent line Tx(Γ) is y = 0. The tangent line Tx(Γ)
intersects Γ in two coinciding points.
Thus if we set y = 0 in (1.115), we
must obtain a double root x = 0. Hence expansion (1.115) must start from
second-degree terms. Therefore, we have
a1 = 0,
(1.116)
and expansion (1.115) becomes
y = 1
2!a2x2 + 1
3!a3x3 + . . . =
∞

n=2

n!anxn.
(1.117)

1. Foundational Material
Next we diﬀerentiate equation (1.117), apply (1.113), and equate the coef-
ﬁcients in x. This gives
a2 = 1.
(1.118)
Equating the coeﬃcients in xn, n ≥2, we obtain the following recurrent
diﬀerential equations for the coeﬃcients an, n ≥2:

(1.120)
Substituting n = 2, 3 into (1.119) and applying (1.119), (1.116), (1.118),
(1.96), (1.106), (1.108), and (1.109), we ﬁnd that
a3 = b3, a4 = 3b4.
(1.121)
As a result of (1.118) and (1.121), expansion (1.117) takes the form
y = 1
2x2 + 1
6b3x3 + 1
8b4x4 + [5].
(1.122)
Hence, equation (1.122) shows that the coeﬃcients a2, a3, and a4 of expan-
sion (1.117) coincide with the functions b2 = 1, b3, and b4.
1.4.3 The Osculating Conic to a Curve. In homogeneous coordinates,
the equation of a conic in the plane P2 is
a11(x1)2 + 2a12x1x2 + a22(x2)2 + 2a10x1x0 + 2a20x2x0 + a00(x0)2 = 0.
It has six coeﬃcients but only ﬁve essential parameters. Thus a conic can have
a fourth-order tangency with the curve Γ. We write the preceding equation in
nonhomogeneous coordinates x and y as follows:
a11x2 + 2a12xy + a22y2 + 2a10x + 2a20y + a00 = 0.
(1.123)
If (1.123) is the equation of such an osculating conic C2, then substitut-
ing y from (1.122) into (1.123), we must obtain ﬁve roots x = 0. Thus the

1.4
Specializations of Moving Frames
33
coeﬃcients in xk, k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, must vanish. Hence we obtain ﬁve relations
between auv and the coeﬃcients of expansion (1.122). But we can obtain the
same ﬁve relations by another method.
The function y and its derivatives
y′, y′′, y′′′, y(iv) computed from equations (1.122) and (1.123) must coincide
at the point x = 0, y = 0. Thus, taking four consecutive derivatives of (1.123)
and substituting each time the values
x = 0, y = 0, y′(0) = 0, y′′(0) = 1, y′′′(0) = b3, y(iv)(0) = 3b4,
we obtain the following relations:





a00 = 0, a10 = 0, a11 + a20 = 0, 3a12 + a20b3 = 0,
4a12b3 + 3a22 + 3a20b4 = 0.
(1.124)
Solving (1.124) with respect to a11, a12, and a22, we ﬁnd that





a00 = 0, a10 = 0, a11 = −a20,
a12 = −1

a20.
(1.125)
Substituting (1.125) into (1.123), we obtain the following equation (in non-
homogeneous coordinates) of the osculating conic C2 having a fourth-order
tangency with the curve Γ:
9x2 + 6b3xy + (9b4 −4(b3)2)y2 −18y = 0.
(1.126)
In homogeneous coordinates (x0, x1, x2), equation (1.126) can be written as
9(x1)2 + 6b3x1x2 + (9b4 −4(b3)2)(x2)2 −18x2x0 = 0.
(1.127)
1.4.4 The Second and Third Specializations and Their Geometric
Meaning. For the next two specializations, we apply the geometric method.
First, we place the point A2(0, 0, 1) on the conic C2. The point A2 belongs to
the conic C2 deﬁned by equation (1.127) if and only if
9b4 −4(b3)2 = 0.
(1.128)
As a result of this specialization, equation (1.127) takes the form
3(x1)2 + 2b3x1x2 −6x2x0 = 0.
(1.129)

34
1. Foundational Material
Second, we locate the point A2 on the tangent line to C2 at the point A2.
The equation of the tangent to the curve (1.129) at A2 is
∂F
∂x2 = 2b3x1 −6x0 = 0
or
b3x1 −3x0 = 0.
This tangent line is the line A1 ∧A2 deﬁned by the equation x0 = 0 if and only
if
b3 = 0.
(1.130)
It follows from (1.128) and (1.130) that the conditions
b3 = 0, b4 = 0
(1.131)
are necessary and suﬃcient conditions for A2 to be located on the curve Γ and
for the line A1 ∧A2 to be the tangent line to Γ at the point A2.
The specializations (1.131) imply that equations (1.108) and (1.109) become
ω1
1 = 0
(1.132)
and
ω0
1 −ω1
2 = 0.
(1.133)
In addition, it follows from (1.96) and (1.132) that
ω0
0 + ω2
2 = 0.
(1.134)
Next, taking the exterior derivative of equation (1.133), we obtain the ex-
terior quadratic equation
ω0
2 ∧ω1
0 = 0,
which by Cartan’s lemma implies that
ω0
2 = b5ω1
0.
(1.135)
In addition, as a result of specializations (1.131), expansion (1.122) takes
the form
y = 1
2x2 + [5],
(1.136)
and equation (1.126) of the osculating conic C2 becomes
y = 1
2x2.
(1.137)

1.4
Specializations of Moving Frames
35
Next, we rewrite expansion (1.122) in the form
y = 1
2x2 + 1
5!a5x5 + 1
6!a6x6 + 1
7!a7x7 + [8].
(1.138)
If a5 = 0, then at the point x = A0, the conic C2 has a tangency of at least
ﬁfth order with the curve Γ. Such points of Γ are called sextactic. If Γ and C2
have a ﬁfth-order tangency at all points, then C2 is the same at all points of
Γ, and Γ = C2.
It is easy to conﬁrm this consideration analytically.
If a5 = 0, then it
follows from (1.119)–(1.120) that ap = 0, p = 6, 7, . . ., and expansion (1.138)
becomes (1.137).
In what follows, we assume that
a5 ̸= 0.
(1.139)
Setting n = 4 in (1.119)–(1.120) and taking into account (1.131) and
(1.135), we ﬁnd that
a5 = 6b5.
(1.140)
By (1.140), expansion (1.138) takes the form
y = 1
2x2 + 1
20b5x5 + 1
6!a6x6 + 1
7!a7x7 + [8].
(1.141)
It follows from (1.139) and (1.140) that
b5 ̸= 0.
(1.142)
In what follows, we assume that (1.139) (or (1.142)), i.e., that the curve
Γ in question is not a conic. Note that in the frame we have constructed,
the conic C2 deﬁned by equation (1.137) has a fourth-order tangency with the
curve Γ at the point x = A0.
1.4.5 The Osculating Cubic to a Curve. In homogeneous coordinates,
the equation of a cubic in the plane P2 is
auvwxuxvxw = 0,
u, v, w = 0, 1, 2.
(1.143)
It has ten coeﬃcients but only nine essential parameters. Thus a cubic can
have an eighth-order tangency with the curve Γ. But not all cubics in P2 are
projectively equivalent. Moreover, not all points of a cubic are equivalent: a
cubic can have a singular (double) point. We will use this fact later. Thus
we will save one parameter and look for a cubic C3 having only a seven-order
tangency with the curve Γ.

36
1. Foundational Material
In order to ﬁnd such a cubic C3, we apply the same procedure we used in
Section 1.4.3 when we were looking for an osculating conic C2. The function
y and its derivatives y′, y′′, y′′′, y(iv), y(v), y(vi), y(vii) computed from equations
(1.138) (we assume that the specializations b2 = 1, b3 = b4 = 0 have been
made) and (1.143) must coincide at the point x = 0, y = 0. Thus taking seven
consecutive derivatives of (1.143) and substituting each time the values
x = 0,
y = 0,
y′(0) = 0,
y′′(0) = 1,
y′′′(0) = 0,
y(iv)(0) = 0,
y(v) = a5,
y(vi) = a6,
y(vii) = a7,
we ﬁnd the following eight relations:
a000 = 0, a100 = 0,
2a110 + a200 = 0, a111 + 3a120 = 0,
a220 + 2a112 = 0, a5a200 + 30a122 = 0,
a6a200 + 12a5a120 + 30a222 = 0,
a7a200 + 14a6a120 + 42a5(a112 + a220) = 0.
Excluding the case when Γ is a conic (i.e., assuming that inequality (1.139)
holds), we ﬁnd from the preceding equations that
a110 = λa5, a120 = µa5, a200 = −2λa5, a111 = −3µa5,
3a122 = 1
5λa2
5, a222 = 1
15λa5a6 −2
5a2
5µ,
3a112 = −1
7λa7 + µa6, 3a220 = −2
7λa7 + 2µa6,
where λ and µ are arbitrary parameters.
As a result, we ﬁnd the following equation of a pencil of osculating cubics
having at the point x = y = 0 a seven-order tangency with the curve Γ:

= 0.
(1.144)
We can see that if λ = 0, equation (1.144) does not contain the ﬁrst powers
of x and y. Hence if λ = 0, the cubic C3 has a double point (a knot) at the
point A0. Equating to zero the second-degree terms, we get
6a5xy −2a6y2 = 0.

1.4
Specializations of Moving Frames
37
This shows that at the double point A0, the osculating conic C3 has two real
tangents deﬁned by the equations
y = 0 and 3a5x −a6y = 0.
(1.145)
1.4.6 Two More Specializations and Their Geometric Meaning.
For the two ﬁnal specializations, we will apply again the analytic method. Tak-
ing the exterior derivative of equation (1.135), we obtain the exterior quadratic
equation
(db5 + 3b5ω0
0) ∧ω1
0 = 0,
which by Cartan’s lemma implies that
db5 + 3b5ω0
0 = 3b6ω1
0.
(1.146)
If the point x = A0 is held ﬁxed, it follows from (1.146) and (1.141) that
δ log b5 = −3π0
0.
Fixing all secondary parameters except φ5, in terms of the diﬀerential of which
the secondary form −3π0
0 is expressed, we obtain consecutively
−3π0
0 = δ log φ5, δ log b5 = δ log φ5, b5 = E5φ5,
where E5 = const. Taking φ5 =
1
E5 , we arrive at
b5 = 1.
(1.147)
By (1.147), we ﬁnd from (1.146) that
ω0
0 = b6ω1
0.
(1.148)
Taking the exterior derivative of equation (1.148), we obtain the exterior
quadratic equation
(db6 + ω0
1) ∧ω1
0 = 0,
which by Cartan’s lemma implies that
db6 + ω0
1 = kω1
0.
(1.149)
If the point x = A0 is held ﬁxed, it follows from (1.149) that
δb6 = −π0
1.
Fixing all secondary parameters except the parameter φ6, in terms of the dif-
ferential of which the secondary form −π0
1 is expressed, we obtain consecutively
−π0
1 = δφ6, δb6 = δφ6, b6 = φ6 + E6,

38
1. Foundational Material
where E6 = const. Taking φ6 = −E6, we arrive at
b6 = 0.
(1.150)
By (1.150), equation (1.149) becomes
ω0
1 = kω1
0,
(1.151)
and equations (1.148) and (1.134) give
ω0
0 = ω2
2 = 0.
(1.152)
Exterior diﬀerentiation of (1.151) gives the exterior quadratic equation
dk ∧ω1
0 = 0,
which by Cartan’s lemma implies that
dk = lω1
0.
(1.153)
Now all the forms ωj
i become the principal forms:





ω2
0 = 0,
ω2
1 = ω0
2 = ω1
0,
ω0
1 = ω1
2 = kω1
0,
ω0
0 = ω1
1 = ω2
2 = 0,
(1.154)
and the functions k and l are the absolute invariants of the curve Γ.
Setting n = 5 and n = 6 in (1.119)–(1.120) and taking into account (1.131),
(1.140), (1.147), (1.150), (1.151), and (1.152), we ﬁnd that
a6 = 0, a7 = 18k.
(1.155)
By (1.155), expansion (1.141) takes the form
y = 1
2x2 + 1
20x5 +
k
280x7 + [8].
(1.156)
The osculating cubic C3 having the knot at the origin is determined by the
equation
5x3 + 4y3 −10xy = 0.
(1.157)
Note that expansion (1.156) coincides with the similar decomposition (8)
on p. 216 in the book [Fi 37] by Finikov.
Now we can establish the geometric meaning of the specialization a6 = 0.
It follows from (1.145), that the condition a6 = 0 is necessary and suﬃcient

1.4

39
for the straight line A0A2 to be the second tangent line to the osculating cubic
C3 at its double point A0.
Note that we can make the specialization a6 = 0 geometrically by requesting
the line A0A2 be the second tangent line to the cubic C3 at its double point
A0 immediately after we found equations (1.145).
1.4.7 Conclusions. We make the following conclusions from our consid-
erations in this section:
1. The specializations we have performed can be made for any curve not a
straight line or a conic.
2. We summarize here the geometric meaning of all vertices of our special-
ized moving frame:
A0 = x ∈Γ,
A0 ∈C2,
A0 ∈C3,
A1 ∈Tx(Γ)
A1 ∈Tx(C3),
A2 ∈Tx(C2)
A2 = Tx(C3) ∩C2,
A1 = Tx(Γ) ∩TA2(C2)

The parameter u in (1.159) is the projective arc length, and the absolute
invariant k in equations (1.160) is the projective curvature of Γ (see more
detail on the projective arc length on pp. 222–224 and on the projective
curvature on pp. 221–222 and 225–226 in the book [Fi 37] by Finikov).
It can be proved (see [Fi 37], pp. 220–221) that if we take the new parameter

and if the projective curvature k is given as a function of the projective arc
length, then the curve Γ is deﬁned up to a projective transformation.
In
particular, in the book [Fi 37], the curves Γ with k = 0 and k = const are
determined.
In general, all these considerations are coming from Halphen’s paper [H 78].
In particular, Halphen deﬁned the so-called Halphen’s point in the following
manner (see also p. 68 in the book [Wi 06] by Wilczynski).
A pencil of cubics has always 3 · 3 = 9 centers. All curves of the pencil
(1.144) of osculating cubics have eight common points with the curve Γ (and

1.5

41
thus among each other) at the origin. Therefore, besides the point x = A0,
there exists only one common points for all cubics of the pencil (1.144). This
point is the Halphen point. Its coordinates are
x1 = 490k, x2 = 175k2, x0 = 685 + 25k2.
If k = 0, then the Halphen point coincides with the point x = A0. In this
case the curve (1.157) has an eighth-order tangency with Γ at x.
1.5
Some Algebraic Manifolds
1.5.1 Grassmannians. We now consider some algebraic varieties in a pro-
jective space, which we will need in our considerations.
First of all, we study the Grassmannian G(m, n) of m-dimensional sub-
spaces in a projective space Pn. Consider a ﬁxed frame {Eu} in Pn and denote
the coordinates of a point X relative to this frame by xu.
Thus, we have
X = xuEu. Let Pm be an m-dimensional subspace in Pn. Let us take m + 1
linearly independent points Xi, i = 0, 1, . . . , m, in the subspace Pm. We call
them basis points of the Pm. We write the coordinates of the points Xi relative
to the frame {Eu} in the form of a matrix:
(xu
i ) =


(1.162)
Because the matrix has m + 1 rows and n + 1 columns, the total number of
such minors is equal to
 n+1
m+1

. If we change the basis in the subspace Pm, the
matrix (1.161) also changes, but all of its minors are multiplied by the same
factor, namely, the determinant of the matrix of basis transformation. Thus,
these minors can be taken as homogeneous projective coordinates of a point in
the projective space PN of dimension N =
 n+1
m+1

−1. These coordinates are
called the Grassmann coordinates of the Pm ⊂Pn. It is easy to see that these

42
1. Foundational Material
coordinates are skew-symmetric and that not proportional sets of Grassmann
coordinates correspond to diﬀerent m-dimensional subspaces.
The Grassmann coordinates pi0i1...im are not independent—they satisfy the
sequence of the following quadratic relations:
pi0i1...im−1[impj0j1...jm] = 0,
(1.163)
which follows from equations (1.161) and (1.162) (see, for example, Hodge and
Pedoe [HP 47]). In formulas (1.163) (and many other formulas of this book),
the square brackets enclosing some (or all) upper (or lower) indices denote the
alternation with respect to the enclosed indices while the parentheses in the
indices denote the symmetrization. For example,
t[ij] = 1
2(tij −tji), t(ij) = 1
2(tij + tji),
t[ijk] = 1
3!(tijk + tjki + tkij −tjik −tkji −tikj),
t(ijk) = 1
3!(tijk + tjki + tkij + tjik + tkji + tikj).
If we locate points Ai, i = 0, 1, . . . , m, of the moving frame in the subspace
Pm, then we have
dAi = ωj
i Aj + ωα
i Aα,
α = m + 1, . . . , n;
thus the 1-forms ωα
i are basis forms on the Grassmannian G(m, n).
Relations (1.163) deﬁne in the space PN an algebraic variety of dimension
(m + 1)(n −m), which is the number of linearly independent basis forms ωα
i
on the Grassmannian. We denote this algebraic variety by Ω(m, n). There is
a one-to-one correspondence between m-dimensional subspaces Pm of Pn and
the points of the variety Ω(m, n). This correspondence deﬁnes the mapping
ϕ : G(m, n) →Ω(m, n), called the Grassmann mapping.
As an example, we consider the Grassmannian G(1, 3), the manifold of
straight lines of the three-dimensional projective space P3. In this case, matrix
(1.161) takes the form:

are usually called the Pl¨ucker coordinates of the straight line l deﬁned by the
points X0 and X1. Because
4
2

= 6, the minors are homogeneous projective
coordinates of a point in the space P5. It is easy to prove that these coordinates
satisfy the single quadratic equation
p01p23 + p02p31 + p03p12 = 0
(cf. (1.163)). Therefore, the variety Ω(1, 3) is a hyperquadric in P5, called the
Pl¨ucker hyperquadric.
Let us study the structure of the Grassmannian G(m, n) and its image
Ω(m, n) in the space PN, where N =
 n+1
m+1

−1.
Let p and q be two
m-dimensional subspaces of Pn having in common an (m −1)-dimensional
subspace Pm−1.
These two subspaces generate a linear pencil λp + µq of
m-dimensional subspaces. A straight line of the variety Ω(m, n) corresponds
to this pencil. All subspaces of the pencil belong to the same subspace Pm+1
of dimension m + 1, and a pair of subspaces Pm−1 ⊂Pm+1 completely deﬁnes
the pencil and therefore a straight line on Ω(m, n).
Consider further an (n −m)-bundle of m-dimensional subspaces passing
through a ﬁxed subspace Pm−1.
An (n −m)-dimensional plane generator
ξn−m of the variety Ω(m, n) corresponds to this bundle. Because the space
Pn contains the m(n −m + 1)-dimensional family of subspaces Pm−1, the va-
riety Ω(m, n) carries a family of (n −m)-dimensional plane generators ξn−m,
and the latter family depends on m(n −m + 1) parameters.
Let Pm+1 be a ﬁxed (m + 1)-dimensional subspace in Pn. Consider all its
m-dimensional subspaces Pm. They form a plane ﬁeld of dimension m+1. An
(m + 1)-dimensional plane generator ηm+1 of the variety Ω(m, n) corresponds
to this ﬁeld. Because Pn contains the (m + 2)(n −m −1)-parameter family of
subspaces Pm+1, the variety Ω(m, n) carries an (m + 2)(n −m −1)-parameter
family of plane generators ηm+1.
If Pm−1 ⊂Pm+1, then the plane generators ξn−m and ηm+1 of the variety
Ω(m, n) corresponding to these subspaces intersect each other along a straight
line. Otherwise, they do not have common points.
Next, consider in Pn a ﬁxed subspace Pm.
It contains an m-parameter
family of subspaces Pm−1. Thus, an m-parameter family of generators ξn−m
passes through the point p ∈Ω(m, n) corresponding to the Pm. There is also
an (n −m −1)-parameter family of subspaces Pm+1 passing through the same
subspace Pm. Thus, an (n−m−1)-parameter family of generators ηm+1 passes
through the point p ∈Ω(m, n). Moreover, any two generators ξn−m and ηm+1
passing through the point p have a straight line as their intersection. It follows
that all plane generators ξn−m and ηm+1 passing through the point p ∈Ω(m, n)
are generators of a cone with its vertex at the point p, and this cone is located

44
1. Foundational Material
on the variety Ω(m, n). We denote this cone by Cp(n −m, m + 1) and call it
the Segre cone. The projectivization of the Segre cone with the center at a
point p is the Segre variety S(n −m −1, m) which we will study later.
In the space Pn, the set of all m-dimensional subspaces intersecting a
ﬁxed subspace Pm along the subspace of dimension m −1 corresponds to the
Segre cone Cp(n −m, m + 1). It follows that the dimension of the Segre cone
Cp(n −m, m + 1) is equal to n.
1.5.2 Determinant Submanifolds. The so-called determinant subman-
ifolds are interesting examples of submanifolds in a projective space.
Consider a projective space PN of dimension N = ml + m + l in which
projective coordinates are matrices (xα
i ) with i = 0, 1, . . . , m; α = 0, 1, . . . , l,
and we suppose m ≤l. A determinant manifold is deﬁned by the condition
1 ≤rank (xα
i ) ≤r, r ≤m.
(1.164)
Consider ﬁrst the extreme case r = 1. In this case, the matrix (xα
i ) has the
form of a simple dyad:
xα
i = tαsi,
(1.165)
where tα and si are homogeneous parameters that can be taken as coordinates
of points in the spaces Pl and Pm∗.
The determinant manifold deﬁned by equation (1.165) is called the Segre
variety and is denoted by S(m, l) (cf. the end of Section 1.4.1). This variety
carries two families of plane generators si = λci and tα = µcα where ci and cα
are constants. The generators of these two families are of dimension l and m,
respectively. The Segre variety is an embedding
Pl × (Pm)∗→PN
(1.166)
of the direct product of the spaces Pl and Pm∗into the space PN, and the
dimension of the Segre variety is l + m.
Suppose now that in relation (1.164) the rank r = 2. In this case the entries
of the matrix (xα
i ) can be written in the form
xα
i = λ (′tα · s′
i) + µ (′′tα · s′′
i ),
(1.167)
i.e., the matrix (xα
i ) is a linear combination of two simple dyads. Each of these
dyads determines a point on the Segre variety S(m, l). If the parameters λ and
µ vary, the point of the space PN with coordinates xα
i describes a straight line
—the bisecant of the Segre variety S(m, l). Thus, if r = 2, equation (1.164)
deﬁnes the bisecant variety for the Segre variety S(m, l).
Similarly, for any r, the determinant manifold (1.164) is a family of (r −1)-
secant subspaces for the Segre variety S(m, l).

1.5
Some Algebraic Manifolds
45
For example, if m = l = 1, then n = 3, and the equations of the Segre
variety S(1, 1) can be written as
x0
0 = t0s0,
x0
1 = t0s1,
x1
0 = t1s0,
x1
1 = t1s1.
(1.168)
Eliminating the parameters tα and si from these equations, we arrive at the
quadratic equation
x0
0x1
1 −x1
0x0
1 = 0,
(1.169)
deﬁning in the space P3 a ruled surface of second order that carries two fam-
ilies of rectilinear generators: si = const and tα = const. This surface is an
embedding of the direct product P1 × P1∗into the space P3.
Next, we consider another type of determinant manifold deﬁned in a pro-
jective space Pn of dimension n =
1
2(m + 1)(m + 2) −1, where projective
coordinates are symmetric matrices (xij), i, j = 0, 1, . . . , m, by the equation:
rank (xij) = r, r ≤m.
(1.170)
If r = 1, then each entry of a matrix (xij) is the tensorial square of a vector ti:
xij = titj.
(1.171)
The parameters ti can be considered as homogeneous coordinates of a point
in a projective space Pm. Thus, the manifold deﬁned by equations (1.171) is a
symmetric embedding of the Pm into the Pn:
s : Sym (Pm × Pm) →Pn,
where n = 1
2(m + 1)(m + 2) −1. The manifold (1.171) is called the Veronese
variety and is denoted by V (m). Its dimension is m.
If r > 1, the determinant manifold (1.170) is the variety of (r −1)-secant
subspaces for the Veronese variety V (m).
As an example of the Veronese variety, we consider the case m = 2. Then
n = 5 and the variety V (2), deﬁned by equation (1.171) for i, j = 0, 1, 2, is a
symmetric embedding of the two-dimensional projective plane into the space
P5. The variety V (2) is a two-dimensional surface of fourth order in P5 (see,
for example, Semple and Roth [SR 85]).
Note some properties of the Veronese surface V (2). To each straight line
of the plane P2 there corresponds a conic on the Veronese surface V (2), and
this surface carries a two-parameter family of such conics. Through each point
of the surface V (2), there passes a one-parameter family of such conics, and
through any pair of points of the surface V (2) there passes a unique conic of

46
1.Foundational Material
this family. Two-dimensional planes in P5 containing these conics are called
conisecant planes of the surface V (2).
To the conics deﬁned by the equation
aijtitj = 0
(1.172)
in the plane P2, there corresponds a quartic (a fourth-degree curve) on the
Veronese surface V (2). This quartic is the intersection of the Veronese surface
V (2) with the hyperplane
aijxij = 0
(1.173)
of the space P5. If the conic (1.172) degenerates into two straight lines, then
the corresponding quartic is decomposed into two conics. For curves of this
type, we have det(aij) = 0, and the hyperplane (1.173) deﬁning this curve is
tangent to the Veronese surface V (2) at a point of intersection of these two
conics. If the curve (1.172) is a double straight line, then aij = aiaj, and
the hyperplane (1.173) is tangent to the Veronese surface V (2) along a double
conic.
If r = 2, the manifold deﬁned in the space P5 by equation (1.170) is a
hypercubic deﬁned by the equation

= 0, xij = xji,
(1.174)
and called the cubic symmetroid.
This hypercubic is a bisecant variety for
the Veronese surface V (2). It carries two families of two-dimensional plane
generators. One of these families consists of conisecant planes of the surface
V (2), and the second consists of two-dimensional planes tangent to this sur-
face. The Veronese surface V (2) is the manifold of singular points of the cubic
symmetroid (1.174).
In Section 2.5 we will prove that the Veronese variety and the cubic sym-
metroid are mutually dual submanifolds.

surfaces in the Euclidean space. Cartan developed the method of specialization of
moving frames for studying submanifolds in any homogeneous space (see, for exam-
ple, [C 35] and [C 45]). In Russia, Finikov (see [Fi 48, 50]) and his students widely
used the method of specialization of moving frames in their work.

Chapter 2
Varieties in Projective
Spaces and Their Gauss
Maps
In this chapter, after introducing in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 the basic notions (such as the
tangent, osculating and normal subspaces, the second fundamental tensor and the second
fundamental form, and the asymptotic lines and asymptotic cone) associated with a variety
in a projective space PN, in Section 2.3, we deﬁne the rank of a variety and varieties with
degenerate Gauss maps. In Section 2.4, we consider the main examples of varieties with
degenerate Gauss maps (cones, torses, hypersurfaces, joins, etc.). In Section 2.5, we study the
duality principle and its applications, consider another example of varieties with degenerate
Gauss maps (the cubic symmetroid) and correlative transformations, and in Section 2.6, we
investigate a hypersurface with a degenerate Gauss map associated with a Veronese variety
and ﬁnd its singular points.
2.1
Varieties in a Projective Space
2.1.1 Equations of a Variety. Let M be an n-dimensional connected dif-
ferentiable manifold, and let f be a nondegenerate almost everywhere diﬀer-
entiable mapping of M into a projective space PN:
f : M →PN,
where n < N. The image X = f(M) of the manifold M under this mapping
is also diﬀerentiable almost everywhere.
We shall call X an n-dimensional
variety (or sometimes subvariety). Note that the manifold M is diﬀerentiable
while the variety X = f(M) is almost everywhere diﬀerentiable.

2. Varieties in Projective Spaces and Their Gauss Maps
For a point x ∈X of a variety X ⊂PN, we have dim TxX ≥dim X = n.
If dim TxX = dim X = n, then a point x is called regular (or smooth), and if
dim TxX > dim X = n, a point x is called singular (see Shafarevich [Sha 88],
Chapter 2, §1).
We denote the locus of smooth points of X by Xsm and the locus of singular
points of X by Sing X, so
Xsm = {x ∈X : dim TxX = dim X},
Sing X = {x ∈X : dim TxX > dim X}.
It is obvious that Sing X ⊂X, Xsm ⊆X, dim Xsm = n, dim Sing X < n.
If ti, i = 1, . . . , n, are diﬀerentiable coordinates on the manifold M, then
the variety X can be given by the equations
xu = xu(ti), u = 0, 1, . . . , N,
(2.1)
where xu(ti) are almost everywhere diﬀerentiable functions of the variables
ti, and the rank of the matrix ( ∂xu
∂ti ) does not exceed n.
Because xu are
homogeneous coordinates of a point x of the space PN, the functions xu admit
multiplication by a common factor, which can be not only a number but also
a function f(ti).
The locus of singular points Sing X is determined by the condition
rank
∂xu
∂ti

< n.
The variety X can also be given locally by a system consisting of N −n
independent equations of the form
F α(x0, x1, . . . , xN) = 0, α = n + 1, . . . , N,
(2.2)
where F α are homogeneous almost everywhere diﬀerentiable functions. In a
neighborhood of a nonsingular point x, the Jacobi matrix

∂F α
∂xu

is of rank
N −n. Hence without loss of generality, we may assume that if in a neighbor-
hood of a point x ∈X, det

∂F α
∂xβ

̸= 0, α, β = n + 1, . . . , N, then equations
(2.2) can be solved for the variables xα:
xα = xα(x0, x1, . . . , xn), α = n + 1, . . . , N.
(2.3)
Here the right-hand sides are homogeneous functions of ﬁrst degree. Therefore,
these right-hand sides and the right-hand sides of equations (2.1) contain n
essential variables that determine the location of a point on the variety X. If
we set xi/x0 = ti, we reduce equations (2.3) to the form (2.1).

2.1
Varieties in a Projective Space
51
In Section 1.5 we considered some algebraic submanifolds in a projec-
tive space. Certainly, those are diﬀerentiable manifolds. Moreover, equations
(1.163) deﬁning the image Ω(m, n) of the Grassmannian G(m, n) in the space
PN, where N =
 n+1
m+1

−1, are of form (2.2), and equations (1.165) and (1.171),
deﬁning the Segre and Veronese varieties, respectively, are of form (2.1). How-
ever, the parameters in equations (1.165) and (1.171) are homogeneous while
the parameters in equations (2.1) are nonhomogeneous. But as we indicated
for equation (2.3), in a neighborhood of a nonsingular point, it is easy to change
homogeneous parameters for nonhomogeneous ones.
2.1.2 The Bundle of First-Order Frames Associated with a Vari-
ety. Let X be an almost everywhere diﬀerentiable variety of dimension n in
the projective space PN, and let x be its nonsingular point. In what follows,
we assume that a point x ∈X under consideration is nonsingular without also
specifying this. Consider all smooth curves passing through a point x ∈Xsm.
The tangent lines to these curves at the point x lie in an n-dimensional sub-
space Tx(X) of the space PN, called the tangent subspace to the variety X at
the point x. For brevity, we also use the symbol Tx for the subspace Tx(X).
If x is a regular point of the variety X, then the tangent subspace Tx(X)
can be considered in two ways: as a vector space Ln+1 formed by the vectors
v = xy, where y ∈Tx(X) or as a projective subspace Pn of the projective space
PN with the ﬁxed point x ∈X. In what follows, we will adhere to the second
point of view. Unless otherwise stated, we will conduct all our considerations
in a neighborhood of a regular point x ∈X.
We associate a family of moving frames {Au}, u = 0, 1, . . . , N, with each
point x ∈Xsm, and assume that for all these frames the point A0 coincides with
the point x, and the points Ai, i = 1, . . . , n, lie in the tangent subspace Tx.
The frames of this family are called ﬁrst-order frames. Because the diﬀerential
dx = dA0 of the point x belongs to the tangent subspace Tx, its decomposition
with respect to the vertices of the frame {Au} can be written as:
dA0 = ω0
0A0 + ωi
0Ai.
(2.4)
Thus, in the space PN, the variety X along with the family of ﬁrst-order frames
is deﬁned by the following system of Pfaﬃan equations:
ωα
0 = 0, α = n + 1, . . . , N,
(2.5)
and the forms ωi
0 in equation (2.4) are linearly independent and form a cobasis
in the tangent subspace Tx. For brevity, we denote these forms by ωi:
ωi
0 = ωi.

52
2. Varieties in Projective Spaces and Their Gauss Maps
We call equations (2.5) the basic equations of the variety X.
By the structure equations (1.73) of a projective space PN and by equations
(2.5), the exterior diﬀerentials of the forms ωi can be written as
dωi = ωj ∧(ωi
j −δi
jω0
0).
(2.6)
This implies that the 1-forms
θi
j = ωi
j −δi
jω0
0
(2.7)
are the base forms of the frame bundle R1(M) of ﬁrst-order frames on the
manifold M of parameters of the variety X. The forms ωi are the basis forms
of the manifold M as well as of the variety X. By relation (1.64), if the point
x is held ﬁxed, the forms ωi satisfy the diﬀerential equations
δωi + ωj(πi
j −δi
jπ0
0) = 0,
(2.8)
where, as in Chapter 1, the symbol δ denotes the restriction of the diﬀerential
d to the ﬁber R1
x of the frame bundle R1(M), and πu
v = ωu
v (δ).
If the point x is held ﬁxed on the variety X, then the forms ωi vanish,
ωi = 0. In this case, the tangent subspace Tx is also ﬁxed. Hence the forms
ωα
i also vanish. Thus, if the point x is held ﬁxed, then the admissible trans-
formations of the moving frames are determined by the following derivational
equations:


δA0 = π0
0A0,
δAi = π0
i A0 + πj

δAα = π0

(2.9)
The 1-forms π0
0, π0
i , πj
i , π0
α, πi
α and πβ
α in (2.9) deﬁne the group of transforma-
tions of ﬁrst-order frames associated with the point x = A0. This group is
called the stationary subgroup of the plane element (x, Tx) of X.
Because the family of ﬁrst-order frames is associated with each point x of
the variety X, the bundle R1(X) of ﬁrst-order frames is deﬁned on the whole
variety X. The base of this bundle is the variety X itself, its base forms are
the forms ωi, its typical ﬁber is a set of ﬁrst-order frames associated with a
point x = A0, and its ﬁber forms are the forms ω0
0, ω0
i , ωj
i , ω0
α, ωi
α, and ωβ
α.
Consider the projectivization Tx = Tx/A0 of the tangent subspace Tx with
the center A0 = x (see Section 1.3.3). This projectivization is a projective space
Pn−1 whose elements are the straight lines of the space Tx passing through the
point x.

2.1
Varieties in a Projective Space
53
As indicated in Section 1.3, this projectivization deﬁnes an equivalence
relation in the set of points of the space Tx. This explains why it is natural to
denote this projectivization by Tx/A0:
Tx = Tx/A0.
A frame in the space Tx = Pn−1 is formed by the points Ai = Ai/A0, and the
forms ωi become homogeneous coordinates of the point Y ∈Pn−1, i.e.,
Y = ωi Ai.
Consider also the projectivization of the space PN with the tangent sub-
space Tx as the center of projectivization. The elements of this projectivization
are (n+1)-dimensional subspaces of the space PN containing the n-dimensional
subspace Tx. We denote this projectivization by PN−n−1 = PN/Tx. The ba-
sis points of the space PN−n−1 are the points Aα = Aα/Tx, determined by
(n + 1)-dimensional subspaces passing through the points Aα and the center
Tx of projectivization. The space PN−n−1 = PN/Tx is called the ﬁrst normal
subspace of the variety X at its point x and is denoted by Nx(X) = PN/Tx.
2.1.3 The Prolongation of Basic Equations. The further investigation
of a variety X in a projective space PN is concerned with diﬀerential prolonga-
tions of equations (2.5) deﬁning this variety along with the family of ﬁrst-order
moving frames associated with it. Exterior diﬀerentiation of these equations
gives the exterior quadratic equations
ωi ∧ωα
i = 0.
(2.10)
Applying the Cartan lemma to these exterior equations, we obtain the expres-
sions of the forms ωα
i in terms of the basis forms ωi of the variety X:
ωα
i = bα
ijωj, bα
ij = bα
ji.
(2.11)
The 1-forms {ωα
0 , ωα
i } are the basis forms of the Grassmannian G(n, N) whose
elements are the subspaces p = A0 ∧A1 ∧. . . ∧An. But on the variety X,
we have ωα = 0 (see (2.5)). Thus, equation (2.11) deﬁnes a mapping of the
variety X into the Grassmannian G(n, N). This mapping is called the Gauss
map. We denote it by γ:
γ : X →G(n, N).
Its name is related to the fact that this map is a projective generalization of
the spherical map, introduced by Gauss, of a surface V 2 of a three-dimensional
Euclidean space R3 into a sphere S2 by means of unit normal vectors.

54
2. Varieties in Projective Spaces and Their Gauss Maps
To establish the nature of the geometric object with the components bα
ij,
we evaluate the exterior diﬀerentials of equations (2.11) by means of struc-
ture equations (1.73) of the space PN. This results in the following exterior
equations:
∇bα
ij ∧ωj = 0,
(2.12)
where
∇bα
ij = dbα
ij −bα
kjθk
i −bα
ikθk
j + bβ
ijθα
β,
(2.13)
and the forms θj
i are determined by formulas (2.7). As we noted earlier, these
forms are connected with transformations of the ﬁrst-order frames in the sub-
space Tx(M) tangent to the manifold M of parameters of the variety X. Sim-
ilarly, the forms
θα
β = ωα
β −δα
β ω0
0
(2.14)
determine admissible transformations of moving frames in the space Nx(X).
Applying the Cartan lemma to exterior quadratic equation (2.12), we ob-
tain the equations
∇bα
ij = bα
ijkωk,
(2.15)
where the coeﬃcients bα
ijk are symmetric with respect to all lower indices. It
follows from these equations that if ωi = 0, we have
∇δbα
ij = δbα
ij −bα
kjσk
i −bα
ikσk
j + bβ
ijσα
β = 0,
(2.16)
where
σj
i = πj
i −δj
i π0
0, σα
β = πα
β −δα
β π0
0.
Comparing equations (2.16) with equations (1.13), we see that the quantities
bα
ij form a tensor relative to the indices i and j. They also form a tensor relative
to the index α under transformations of moving frames in the space Nx(X).
Such tensors are called mixed tensors.
2.2
The Second Fundamental Tensor and the
Second Fundamental Form
2.2.1 The Second Fundamental Tensor, the Second Fundamental
Form, and the Osculating Subspace of a Variety.
The tensor bα
ij is
connected with the second-order diﬀerential neighborhood of a point x of the
variety X. For this reason, this tensor is called the second fundamental tensor
of the variety X. Let us clarify the geometric meaning of this tensor. To do

2.2
The Second Fundamental Tensor and the Second Fundamental Form 55
this, we compute the second diﬀerential of the point x = A0 by diﬀerentiating
the relation (2.4):
d2A0 = (dω0
0 + (ω0
0)2 + ωi
0ω0
i )A0 + (ω0
0ωi
0 + ωj
0ωi
j)Ai + ωi
0ωα
i Aα.
(2.17)
Factorizing the latter relation by the tangent subspace Tx = A0 ∧A1 ∧. . .∧An,
we obtain
d2A0/Tx = ωi
0ωα
i Aα,
(2.18)
where Aα are basis points of the normal space Nx = PN/Tx.
Substituting the values of ωα
i from equations (2.11) into equation (2.18)
and denoting the left-hand side by Φ, we ﬁnd that
Φ = bα
ijωiωj Aα.
(2.19)
This expression is a quadratic form with respect to the coordinates ωi, having
values in the normal subspace Nx. The form Φ is called the second fundamental
form of the variety X. Thus, the second fundamental form deﬁnes a mapping
of the tangent subspace Tx(X) into the normal subspace Nx(X):
Φ : Sym(2)Tx(X) →Nx(X).
This mapping is called the Meusnier–Euler mapping (see Griﬃths and Harris
[GH 79]).
Note that a variety X is an n-plane or a part of an n-plane if and only
if the second fundamental form Φ vanishes on X. In fact, if Φ ≡0, then it
follows from formula (2.18) that ωα
i = 0 on X. This implies that the equations
of inﬁnitesimal displacement of a moving frame become:

dA0 = ω0
0A0 + ωiAi,
dAi = ω0
i A0 + ωj
i Aj,
and as a result, the n-plane A0 ∧A1 ∧. . .∧An is ﬁxed, and the point A0 moves
in this n-plane.
The scalar forms
Φα = bα
ijωiωj
(2.20)
are the coordinates of the form Φ with respect to the moving frame { Aα} in the
space Nx. Let us denote the maximal number of linearly independent forms
Φα by m. In some instances, it is convenient to consider the bundle of second
fundamental forms of the variety X deﬁned by the relation
Φ(ξ) = ξαbα
ijωiωj,
(2.21)

56
2. Varieties in Projective Spaces and Their Gauss Maps
where ξ = (ξα). The number m is the dimension of this bundle. In what
follows, we assume that the number m is constant on the variety X.
The quantities ξα occurring in (2.21) deﬁne a hyperplane ξ = ξαxα = 0,
which is tangent to the variety X at the point x, and expression (2.21) is called
the second fundamental form of the variety X with respect to the hyperplane
ξ.
In the space Nx, consider the points
Bij = bα
ij Aα.
(2.22)
Because Bij = Bji, the number of these points is equal to 1
2n(n+1). However,
it is not necessarily the case that all these points are linearly independent.
The maximal number of linearly independent points Bij coincides with the
maximal number of linearly independent forms Φα, which we denoted by m.
Note that according to our general point of view (see the Preface), we suppose
that the integer m is the same on the entire variety X in question, and we will
make similar assumptions relative to all other integer-valued invariants arising
in our further considerations.
It is obvious that the number m satisﬁes the following inequalities:
0 ≤m ≤n(n + 1)
2
and m ≤N −n.
(2.23)
In the space Nx, the points Bij span the subspace Pm−1.
Next, in the space PN, we consider the subspace, which is the linear span of
the subspace Tx and the points Bij = bα
ijAα. By relation (2.17), this subspace
is also the linear span of all two-dimensional osculating planes of all curves of
the variety X passing through the point x. For this reason, this subspace is
called the second osculating subspace of the variety X at its point x, and it is
denoted by T (2)
x . We consider the tangent subspace Tx as the ﬁrst osculating
subspace of the variety X at a point x, Tx = T (1)
x .
2.2.2 Further Specialization of Moving Frames and Reduced Nor-
mal Subspaces.
We will make a further specialization of moving frames
{Au} associated with a point x ∈X.
To do this, we place the vertices
An+1, . . . , An+m of the frames into the second osculating subspace T (2)
x , whose
dimension is equal to n + m. The frames thus obtained are called the frames
of second order.
With this specialization, the points Bij, which together with the points A0
and Ai deﬁne the second osculating subspace T (2)
x , are expressed in terms of
the points Ai1 alone: Bij = bi1
ijAi1, i1 = n + 1, . . . , n + m. So, we have
bα1
ij = 0, α1 = n + m + 1, . . . , N,
(2.24)

2.2
The Second Fundamental Tensor and the Second Fundamental Form 57
and therefore formulas (2.11) break up into two groups:
ωi1
i = bi1
ijωj,
(2.25)
ωα1
i
= 0.
(2.26)
Therefore the second fundamental forms Φα of the variety X can be written
as follows:
Φi1 = bi1
ijωiωj, Φα1 = 0,
(2.27)
and formula (2.18) becomes
d2A0/Tx = ωiωi1
i Ai1.
(2.28)
The forms Φi1 are linearly independent, and the matrix (bi1
ij) of coeﬃcients of
these forms, having m rows and 1
2n(n + 1) columns, is of rank m.
Consider now the projectivization with the center Tx of the projective space
T (2)
x . This projectivization is a projective space of dimension m −1. We call
this space the reduced ﬁrst normal subspace of the variety X and denote it by

Nx:

Nx = T (2)
x /Tx.
(2.29)
If N > n + m, then at the point x ∈X it is also possible to deﬁne the
second normal subspace
N (2)
x
= PN/T (2)
x ,
(2.30)
whose dimension is equal to N −n −m −1 and whose basis is formed by the
points Aα1 = Aα1/T (2)
x .
Let us now establish the form of equations (2.15) after the specialization of
moving frames indicated earlier. These equations also break into two groups:
∇bi1
ij = dbi1
ij −bi1
kjθk
i −bi1
ikθk
j + bj1
ij θi1
j1 = bi1
ijkωk,
(2.31)
∇bα1
ij = bi1
ijωα1
i1 = bα1
ijkωk.
(2.32)
Equations (2.31) show that the quantities bi1
ij form a tensor relative to the
indices i, j, and i1. Because the matrix (bi1
ij) is of rank m, equations (2.32) can
be solved with respect to the forms ωα1
i1 :
ωα1
i1 = cα1
i1kωk.
(2.33)
Substituting these expressions of the forms ωα1
i1 into equations (2.32), we obtain
bi1
ijcα1
i1k = bα1
ijk.
(2.34)

58
2. Varieties in Projective Spaces and Their Gauss Maps
Because the quantities bα1
ijk are symmetric with respect to the indices j and k,
we ﬁnd from (2.34) that
bi1
ijcα1
i1k = bi1
ikcα1
i1j.
(2.35)
This equation can also be obtained as a result of exterior diﬀerentiation of
equations (2.26).
In the same manner as for the tensor bα
ij, we can prove that the quantities
bα1
ijk form a tensor relative to the indices i, j, k, and α1. This and the relations
(2.34) imply that the quantities cα1
i1k also form a tensor relative to the indices
k, i1, and α1. As to the quantities bi1
ijk in relations (2.31), it is easy to verify
that they do not form a tensor, but rather they depend on the choice of the
subspace A0 ∧An+1 ∧. . . ∧An+m, which is complementary to the subspace Tx
in the osculating subspace T (2)
x .
2.2.3 Asymptotic Lines and Asymptotic Cone. A curve on a two-
dimensional surface V 2 of a Euclidean space E3 is called asymptotic if its
osculating planes coincide with the tangent planes to the surface V 2 or are
undetermined (see, for example, Blaschke’s books [Bl 21], p. 52, or [Bl 50],
p.
65).
This deﬁnition is projectively invariant and can be generalized to
the case where we have a variety of any dimension n in a projective space PN.
Namely, a curve l on a variety X is said to be asymptotic if its two-dimensional
osculating plane at any of its points x belongs to the tangent subspace Tx to
the variety X at this point or is undetermined.
If a curve l is given on the variety X by a parametric equation x = x(t),
then its osculating plane is determined by the points x(t), x′(t) and x′′(t). But
because x = A0, this plane can also be deﬁned by the points A0, dA0, and d2A0.
Because for an asymptotic line the second diﬀerential of its point belongs to
the tangent subspace Tx, it follows from equation (2.17) that on this curve we
have
Φ = ωiωα
i Aα = 0,
(2.36)
i.e., the second fundamental form of the variety X vanishes on l.
Thus in
coordinate form, the equations of asymptotic lines have the form
bα
ijωiωj = 0.
(2.37)
On a curve l passing through the point x, the basis forms ωi have the
form ωi = ξidt, where ξi are coordinates of a tangent vector to the curve.
Substituting these expressions into equations (2.37), we obtain
bα
ijξiξj = 0.
(2.38)
These equations deﬁne a cone Cx of directions with vertex x. This cone belongs
to the tangent subspace Tx and is called the asymptotic cone.

2.2
The Second Fundamental Tensor and the Second Fundamental Form 59
If we place the points Ai1, i1 = n+1, . . . , n+m, of our moving frames into
the second osculating subspace T (2)
x , as we did in Section 2.2.2, then by (2.38),
the equations of the asymptotic cone Cx at the point x can be written as
bi1
ijξiξj = 0, i1 = n + 1, . . . , n + m.
(2.39)
The problem of existence of asymptotic directions at the point x of the
variety X is reduced to ﬁnding nontrivial solutions of the system of equations
(2.39). This is an algebraic problem. In general, nontrivial solutions exist if
m ≤n −1. However, in some special cases, nontrivial solutions of equations
(2.39) may exist even if m > n −1.
2.2.4 The Osculating Subspace, the Second Fundamental Form,
and the Asymptotic Cone of the Grassmannian. As an example, we now
consider the second osculating subspace and the second fundamental form for
the Grassmannian G(m, n).
As in Section 1.4, we denote by Ω(m, n) the image of the Grassmannian
G(m, n) under the Grassmann mapping. This image is a variety of dimension
ρ = (m + 1)(n −m) in the projective space PN, where N =
 n+1
m+1

−1.
With each element p = Pm of G(m, n) we associate a family of moving
frames whose points Ai, i = 0, 1, . . . , m, span the subspace Pm. Then we have
dAi = ωj
i Aj + ωα
i Aα, α = m + 1, . . . , n,
(2.40)
where ωα
i are the basis forms of G(m, n).
The subspace Pm can be represented as
p = A0 ∧A1 ∧. . . ∧Am,
(2.41)
where the symbol ∧denotes the exterior product. Diﬀerentiating (2.41) and
using (2.40), we obtain
dp = ωp + ωα
i pi
α,
(2.42)
where ω = ω0
0 + ω1
1 + . . . + ωm
m, and
pi
α = A0 ∧A1 ∧. . . ∧Ai−1 ∧Aα ∧Ai+1 ∧. . . ∧Am.
This implies that the tangent subspace Tp to the variety Ω(m, n) is the span
of the points p and pi
α.
Formula (2.42) proves that the forms ωα
i are coordinates of a point in the
projective space Tp/p with respect to the moving frame pi
α = pi
α/p.
To ﬁnd the second diﬀerential of the point p, we ﬁrst diﬀerentiate the points
pi
α and then apply projectivization with the center Tp. This gives
dpi
α/Tp = ωβ
j pij
αβ,
(2.43)

60
2. Varieties in Projective Spaces and Their Gauss Maps
where
pij
αβ = pij

and
pij
αβ = A0 ∧A1 ∧. . . ∧Ai−1 ∧Aα ∧Ai+1 ∧. . . ∧Aj−1 ∧Aβ ∧Aj+1 ∧. . . ∧Am.
Thus, the points pij
αβ are skew-symmetric with respect to both the upper and
lower indices. By equation (2.43), the projectivization with the center Tp of
the second diﬀerential of the point p has the form
d2p/Tp = 1

α,β,i,j
(ωα

(2.44)
The right-hand side of this expression is the second fundamental form Φ of the
image Ω(m, n) of the Grassmannian G(m, n). The coordinates of this form are
written as follows:
ωαβ
ij = ωα
i ωβ
j −ωβ
i ωα
j .
(2.45)
It follows that the forms ωαβ
ij are skew-symmetric in both the upper and lower
indices. If i < j and α < β, the points pij
αβ are linearly independent, and their
number is equal to ρ1 =
m+1
2
n−m
2

. The number of linearly independent
forms ωαβ
ij is equal to the same number ρ1. The points p, pi
α, and pij
αβ determine
the second osculating subspace T (2)
p
of the variety Ω(m, n) at the point p.
Because the dimension of the tangent space Tp of Ω(m, n) is equal to
dim Tp = (m + 1)(n −m) =
m + 1
1
n −m
1

,
(2.46)
the dimension of its second osculating subspace T (2)
p
is given by the formula:
dim T (2)

(2.47)
The equation of the asymptotic cone C of the variety Ω(m, n) has the form
ωαβ
ij = ωα
i ωβ
j −ωβ
i ωα
j = 0.
(2.48)
Because the forms ωαβ
ij are the minors of second order of the rectangular matrix
M = (ωα
i ),
(2.49)

2.2
The Second Fundamental Tensor and the Second Fundamental Form 61
equations (2.48) are equivalent to the conditions
rank M = 1.
(2.50)
But as we noted in Section 1.4, in the projective space Tp/p this condition
deﬁnes the Segre variety S(m −1, n −m −1) carrying plane generators of
dimensions m −1 and n −m −1. The Segre variety S(m −1, n −m −1) is the
projectivization of the asymptotic cone C, which is the Segre cone C(m, n−m).
The vertex of this cone is the point p, and its director manifold is the Segre
variety S(m −1, n −m −1).
2.2.5 Varieties with One-Dimensional Normal Subspaces. Consider
an n-dimensional variety X = V n belonging to a projective space Pn+1. Such a
variety is called a hypersurface. For a hypersurface X, equations (2.5), (2.11),
and (2.20) have the forms
ωn+1
0
= 0,
(2.51)
ωn+1
i
= bijωj, bij = bji,
(2.52)
Φ = bijωiωj,
(2.53)
where bij = bn+1
ij
is the second fundamental tensor of the hypersurface X.
If Φ ≡0 at any point x ∈X, then as we showed in Section 2.2.1, the
hypersurface X coincides with its ﬁrst osculating subspace, i.e., it degenerates
into a hyperplane.
If the form Φ does not identically vanish, then the osculating subspace T (2)
x
coincides with the space Pn+1. Moreover, in this case, the normal subspace
Nx is of dimension 1 and coincides with the reduced normal subspace 
Nx. The
hypersurface X has a single relatively invariant second fundamental form Φ,
which at any point x determines the cone Cx ⊂Tx of asymptotic directions
with vertex at x. The cone Cx is deﬁned by the equation
Φ = bijωiωj = 0.
(2.54)
Consider a variety X = V n in the space PN, and suppose that all second
fundamental forms Φα, α = n + 1, . . . , N, of X are proportional. In this case,
the points of the variety X are called axial, and the reduced normal subspaces

Nx of X are of dimension 1, as was the case for a hypersurface.
Specializing the moving frames in the same way as in Section 2.2.2, we
obtain
Φn+1 = bijωiωj,
(2.55)
Φα1 = 0, α1 = n + 2, . . . , N.
(2.56)

62
2. Varieties in Projective Spaces and Their Gauss Maps
Thus, equations (2.25) and (2.26) have the form
ωn+1
i
= bijωj, ωα1
i
= 0.
(2.57)
Because now the index i1 takes only one value, formula (2.33) can be written
as follows:
ωα1
n+1 = cα1
k ωk,
α1 = n + 2, . . . , N,
(2.58)
and formula (2.52) can be written as
bijcα1
k
= bikcα1
j .
(2.59)
We can now prove the following result.
Theorem 2.1. If all points of a variety X = V n of a projective space PN
are axial, then either the variety X belongs to its ﬁxed osculating subspace
T (2)
x
of dimension n + 1, or this variety is a torse, i.e., it is an envelope of a
one-parameter family of n-dimensional subspaces.
Proof. Suppose that rank Φ = r ≥2. Then the matrix of this form can be
reduced to a diagonal form, i.e., bij = 0, i ̸= j, baa ̸= 0, buu = 0, a = 1, . . . r;
u = r + 1, . . . , n. As a result, equations (2.59) take the form
baacα1
k
= 0, k ̸= a.
But because the index a takes more than one value, this implies that
cα1
k
= 0 for any k = 1, . . . , n.
Thus, we have ωα1
n+1 = 0, the subspace T (2)
x
= A0∧A1∧. . .∧An∧An+1 remains
ﬁxed when the point x moves along the variety X, and X ⊂T (2)
x .
If rank Φ = r = 1, then the matrix of Φ can be reduced to the form in
which
b11 ̸= 0, bij = 0 if i ̸= 1 or j ̸= 1.
As a result, equations (2.59) take the form
b11cα1
k
= 0, k ̸= 1.
It follows that cα1
k
= 0, and the forms ωα1

Thus, the family of tangent subspaces Tx of the variety X depends on one
parameter, and therefore this variety is a torse (see Example 2.5 in Section
2.4).

2.3
Rank and Defect of Varieties with Degenerate Gauss Maps
63
In the case when X is a variety of an N-dimensional space of constant
curvature, a similar theorem was proved by C. Segre (see [SegC 07], p. 571),
and for this reason, it is called the Segre theorem.
The proof given above
implies that the result of Segre’s theorem does not depend on a metric but is
of pure projective nature. So our theorem is a generalized Segre theorem.
2.3
Rank and Defect of Varieties with
Degenerate Gauss Maps
To a regular point x ∈X ⊂PN, there corresponds the tangent subspace Tx.
Because Tx is an element of the Grassmannian G(n, N), the variety X deﬁnes
a map
γ : X →G(n, N).
(2.60)
As we said earlier, under this map, we have γ(x) = Tx(X). We called the map
γ the Gauss map.
We denote the image of the variety X under the Gauss map γ by γ(X).
Denote by r the rank of the Gauss map γ(X), rank γ(X) = r. It is obvious
that 0 ≤r ≤n. The rank of the variety X is deﬁned as the rank of the map
γ: rank X = rank γ(X).
Because Tx = A0 ∧A1 ∧. . . ∧An, the basis forms of the Grassmannian
G(n, N) are the forms {ωα
0 , ωα
i }. Thus, the Gauss map γ(X) is deﬁned by
equations (2.5) and (2.11). It follows from these equations that
rank γ(X) = rank X = rank (ωα
i ) = rank (bα
ijωj).
(2.61)
Let x ∈X be a regular point of a variety X ⊂PN, and Φx be its second
fundamental form at this point. Consider the subspace
T ′
x = {ξ ∈Tx|Φx(ξ, η) = 0 for any η ∈Tx}.
By (2.20), in a coordinate form, this subspace is deﬁned by the system of
equations
bα
ijξi = 0.
(2.62)
The number l = dim T ′
x is called the Gauss defect of a variety X (see the book
[FP 01], p. 89, by Fischer and Piontkowski) or the index of relative nullity of
the second fundamental form Φ of the variety X at the point x (see the paper
[CK 52] by Chern and Kuiper).
Comparing equations (2.61) and (2.62), we ﬁnd that
l + r = n,

64
2. Varieties in Projective Spaces and Their Gauss Maps
i.e., the sum of the defect and the rank of a variety X coincides with its di-
mension.
In what follows, we assume that at all points x ∈X, its rank (and therefore
its defect) takes a constant value.
If r = rank X = n, then the Gauss map γ is nondegenerate. In this case,
the tangent subspace Tx(X) to the variety X depends on n parameters, and the
variety X is called tangentially nondegenerate. For such a variety, the forms
ωα
i in equations (2.11) cannot be expressed in terms of fewer than n linearly
independent forms ωi.
If r = rank X < n, then the Gauss map γ is degenerate. In this case,
its Gauss image γ(X) depends on r parameters, where 0 ≤r < n. Then we
say that the variety X is tangentially degenerate of rank r, or X is a variety
with a degenerate Gauss map of rank r. We denote such variety by X = V n
r ,
rank X = r < n. Varieties with a degenerate Gauss map of rank r foliate into
their leaves L of dimension l = n−r, along which the tangent subspace Tx(X)
is ﬁxed. This foliation is called the Monge–Amp`ere foliation (see Section 3.1.1).
We will prove in Theorem 3.1 (see Section 3.1.3) that the leaves of this foliation
are l-planes.
Figure 2.1
In a three-dimensional Euclidean space E3 (N = 3, n = 2, r = 1) vari-
eties with degenerate Gauss maps are known as developable surfaces. There
are three classes of developable surfaces in E3: cylinders, cones, and tangent
developables of space curves (see Figure 2.1 (a), (b), (c)).
If rank X = 0, then the matrix (bα
ij) is the zero matrix, the form Φ is also 0,
Φ = 0, and a variety X is a ﬂat variety, i.e., X is an n-dimensional projective
subspace Pn of the space PN, or it is an open part of Pn.

2.4
Examples of Varieties with Degenerate
Gauss Maps
Consider a few examples of varieties with degenerate Gauss maps.
Example 2.2. If rank X = dim X = n, then X is a variety of complete rank.
X is also called tangentially nondegenerate in the space PN. Such varieties do
not have singular points.
For example, the quadric Q deﬁned in a three-dimensional projective space
P3 by the equation
x0x3 −x1x2 = 0
is tangentially nondegenerate.
For the quadric Q, we have n = 2, N = 3,
r = 2, l = 0.
Such a quadric bears two families of rectilinear generators.
However, the tangent plane T(Q) is not constant along these generators, i.e.,
none of these families compose the Monge–Amp`ere foliation.
Example 2.3. As we showed in Section 2.2.1, for r = 0, a variety X is an
n-dimensional subspace Pn, n < N. This variety is the only variety with a
degenerate Gauss map without singularities in PN.
Example 2.4. Suppose that S is a subspace of the space PN, dim S = l −1,
and T is its complementary subspace, dim T = N −l, T ∩S = ∅. Let Y
be a smooth tangentially nondegenerate variety of the subspace T, dim Y =
rank Y = r < N −l. Consider an r-parameter family of l-dimensional sub-
spaces Ly = S ∧y, y ∈Y . This variety is a cone X with vertex S and the
director manifold Y . The subspace Tx(X) tangent to the cone X at a point
Figure 2.2
x
∈
Ly(x
/∈
S) is deﬁned by its vertex S and the subspace Ty(Y ),
Tx(X) = S ∧Ty(Y ), and Tx(X) remains ﬁxed when a point x moves in the
subspace Ly. As a result, the cone X is a variety with a degenerate Gauss map
of dimension n = l+r and rank r, with plane generators Ly of dimension l (see

66
2. Varieties in Projective Spaces and Their Gauss Maps
Figure 2.2). The generators Ly of the cone X are leaves of the Monge–Amp`ere
foliation associated with X.
Example 2.5. Consider a smooth curve Y in the space PN not belonging
to a subspace Pl+1 ⊂PN and the set of its osculating subspaces Ly of order
and dimension l. This set forms a variety X = ∪y∈Y Ly of dimension l + 1
and rank r = 1 in PN. Such a variety is called a torse (cf. Section 2.2.5).
The subspace Ty = Ly + dLy
dy is the tangent subspace to X at all points of its
generator Ly. Thus, the subspaces Ly are the leaves of the Monge–Amp`ere
foliation associated with the torse X. The subspace Fy = Ly ∩dLy
dy describes
also a torse of dimension l. This process of construction of torses departing
from X can be continued in both directions: from one side until we reach a
smooth curve Y for which the subspace Ly is the osculating subspace of order
l −1, and from the other side until we reach an (N −1)-dimensional variety
(hypersurface) with a degenerate Gauss map. Figure 2.3 shows a torse in P3.
Conversely, a variety of dimension n and rank 1 is a torse formed by a
family of osculating subspaces of order n −1 of a curve of class Cp, p ≥n −1,
in the space PN.
Figure 2.3
In what follows, unless otherwise stated, we always assume that r > 1.
In particular, we consider the spatial third-degree curve1 C deﬁned in the
space P3 by the parametric equations x(t) = (t3, t2, t, 1). The tangent line to
C is determined by the point x(t) and the point x′(t) = (3t2, 2t, 1, 0). The
parametric equations of this tangent line have the form
y(t, s) = x(t) + sx′(t) = (t3 + 3t2s, t2 + 2ts, t + s, 1).
1Cayley [Cay 64] called such a curve a twisted cubic.

2.4
Examples of Varieties with Degenerate Gauss Maps
67
A surface swept by these tangent lines is a torse—a variety with a degenerate
Gauss map of rank one and dimension two in the space P3. In this case we
have n = 2, N = 3, l = 1, r = 1. The tangents to the line x(t) are the leaves
of the Monge–Amp`ere foliation associated with this third-degree curve.
In order to obtain an equation of form (2.2) of the torse X formed by the
tangents to the third-degree curve, we need to exclude parameters t and s from
the parametric equations of the third-degree curve and its tangent line. An
equation of this torse can also be obtained by a method indicated by Cayley
(see [Cay 64]).
Let (y0, y1, y2, y3) be homogeneous coordinates of the space P3. Consider
the nonhomogeneous polynomial
ψ(t) := y0t3 + y1t2 + y2t + y3.
An osculating plane of the third-degree curve x(t) = (t3, t2, t, 1) is deﬁned
by the points x(t), x′(t) = (3t2, 2t, 1, 0), and x′′(t) = (6t, 2, 0, 0). So, the equa-
tion of this plane is

or
ψ∗(t) := y0 −3y1t + 3y2t2 −y3t3 = 0.
It follows from this form of ψ∗(t) that the dual curve x∗(t) has the param-
eterization x∗(t) = (1, −3t, 3t2, −t3). Its osculating plane is deﬁned by the
points x∗(t), (x∗)′(t) = (0, −3, 6t, −3t2), and (x∗)′′(t) = (0, 0, 6, −6t). Thus,
its equation is

Easy computation shows that this equation is
ψ(t) = 0.
The torse X is the envelope of the family of osculating planes ψ∗(t) = 0 of
the third-degree curve x(t), and the torse X∗is the envelope of the family of
osculating planes ψ(t) = 0 of the dual curve x∗(t).

68
2. Varieties in Projective Spaces and Their Gauss Maps
We ﬁnd equations of both torses X and X∗.
According to Cayley [Cay 64], an equation of the torse X∗is
Disct ψ(t) = 0,
where Disct ψ(t) is the discriminant of the polynomial ψ(t). Computing the
discriminant

up to a factor of y0, we obtain the following equation of the torse X∗:

We can ﬁnd an equation of the torse X (which is the envelope of the
osculating planes ψ∗(t) = 0 of the third-degree curve x∗(t)) by computing the
discriminant of the polynomial ψ∗(t).
However, it is easier to ﬁnd this equation by making the substitution
y0 →y3, y1 →−3y2, y2 →3y1, y3 →−y0
in the equation of the torse X. The result is
Ψ∗:= y2
0y2
3 −6y0y1y2y3 + 4y0y3
2 + 4y3
1y3 −3y2

2 = 0.
This equation shows that the surface swept by the tangents to the third-
degree curve is an algebraic fourth-degree surface.
Note that Cayley [Cay 64] took equations of the family of osculating planes
of the torse X in the form
y0t3 + 3y1t2 + 3y2t2 + y3 = 0.
Comparing this with ψ∗(t) = 0, we see that Cayley used the following paramet-
rization of a third-degree curve: (1, −t, t2, −t3). It is easy to check that the
equations of the torses X and X∗for Cayley’s parameterization are precisely
the same as for our parameterization. Namely, the torses X and X∗for Cay-
ley’s parameterization are deﬁned by the equations Ψ∗= 0 (see [Cay 64]) and
Ψ = 0, respectively.
In his paper [Ca 64], Cayley found equations of torses formed by the tan-
gents to two special fourth-degree curves (quartics) u(t) and v(t) in the space

P3. He did not indicate the equations of these fourth-degree curves—he found
equations of the torses as envelopes of the families of osculating planes of the
dual curves u∗(t) and v∗(t).
In addition, in his paper [Cay 64], Cayley considered in P3 the fourth-
degree curves u(t) = (81, −27t, 9t2, t4) and v(t) = (−2, t, −t3, 2t4) and found
equations of the torses formed by the tangents to these curves. These torses
are deﬁned by the algebraic equations

These equations can be derived in a way similar to what we used to ﬁnd the
equation Ψ∗(t) = 0 of the torse formed by the tangents to the third-degree
curve x(t) = (t3, t2, t, 1).
Figure 2.4
Example 2.6. In the space PN, N ≥4, we take two arbitrary smooth space
curves, Y1 and Y2, that do not belong to the same three-dimensional space,
and the set of all straight lines intersecting these two curves (see Figure 2.4).
These straight lines form a three-dimensional variety X.
Such a variety is
called the join. Its dimension is three, dim X = 3. It is easy to see that the
variety X has a degenerate Gauss map. In fact, the three-dimensional tangent
subspace Tx(X) to X at a point x lying on a rectilinear generator L is deﬁned
by this generator L and two straight lines tangent to the curves Y1 and Y2 at
the points y1 and y2 of their intersection with the line L. Because this tangent

70
2. Varieties in Projective Spaces and Their Gauss Maps
subspace does not depend on the location of the point x on the generator L,
the variety under consideration is a variety X = V 3
2 with a degenerate Gauss
map of rank two.
This example can be generalized by taking k spatial curves in the space
PN, where N ≥2k and k > 2, and considering a k-parameter family of (k −1)-
planes intersecting all these k curves.
Example 2.7. Let N = n + 1, and let Y be an r-parameter family of hyper-
planes ξ in general position in Pn+1, r < n. Such a family has an n-dimensional
envelope X that is a variety with a degenerate Gauss map of dimension n and
rank r in the space Pn+1. It foliates into an r-parameter family of plane gener-
ators L of dimension l = n−r, along which the tangent subspace Tx(X), x ∈L,
is ﬁxed and coincides with a hyperplane ξ of the family in question. Thus, X is
a hypersurface with a degenerate Gauss map of rank r with (n−r)-dimensional
plane generators L in the space Pn+1.

Application of the Duality Principle
2.5.1 Dual Variety.
For construction of new examples of varieties with
degenerate Gauss maps we employ the duality principle in a projective space
introduced in Section 1.3.2.
By the duality principle, to a point x of a projective space PN, there cor-
responds a hyperplane ξ. A set of hyperplanes of space PN forms the dual
projective space (PN)∗of the same dimension N. Under this correspondence,
to a subspace P ⊂PN of dimension p, there corresponds a subspace P∗⊂(PN)∗
of dimension N −p −1. Under the dual map, the incidence of subspaces is
reversed, that is, if P1 ⊂P2, then P∗
1 ⊃P∗
2.

2.5
Application of the Duality Principle
71
Let X be an irreducible, almost everywhere smooth variety of dimension
n, dim X = n, in the space PN, let x be a smooth point of X, and let TxX
be the tangent subspace to X at the point x. A hyperplane ξ is said to be
tangent to X at x if Tx ⊂ξ. The bundle of hyperplanes ξ tangent to X at x
is of dimension N −n −1.
The set of all hyperplanes ξ tangent to the variety X at its smooth points
composes a variety
X∧= {ξ ⊂P N|∃x ∈Xsm such that TxX ⊆ξ}.
But this variety can be not closed if X has singular points. The dual variety
X∗of a variety X is the closure of the variety X∧:
X∗= X∧= {ξ ⊂P N|∃x ∈Xsm such that TxX ⊆ξ}.
(2.63)
The dual variety X∗can also be described as the envelope of the family of
hyperplanes ξ dual to the points x ∈X. This gives a practical way for ﬁnding
X∗, which we will use in examples.
If a variety X is tangentially nondegenerate, i.e., if its rank r = n, then in
the general case, the dimension n∗of its dual variety X∗is equal to
n∗= dim X∗= (N −n −1) + n = N −1.
(2.64)
Equation (2.64) means that the variety X∗is a hypersurface with a degenerate
Gauss map in the space (PN)∗. The rank r of X∗equals the dimension n of
the variety X, r = rank X∗= n, and its Gauss defect δγ(X∗) = l∗= n∗−r =
N −r −1.
However, it may happen that dim X∗< N −1. Then the number
δ∗= N −1 −dim X∗
is called the dual defect of the variety X, and the variety X itself is said to be
dually degenerate.
An example of a dually degenerate smooth variety is the Segre variety
X = Seg (Pm × Pn) ⊂Pmn+m+n, whose dual defect equals |m −n| (see
Example 2.11).
If a variety X has a degenerate Gauss map (i.e., if its rank r < n), then the
dual variety X∗is a ﬁbration whose ﬁber is the bundle Ξ = {ξ ⊂PN|ξ ⊇TLX}
of hyperplanes ξ containing the tangent subspace TLX and whose base is the
manifold B = X∗/Ξ. The dimension of a ﬁber Ξ of this ﬁbration (as in the
case r = n) equals N −n −1, dim Ξ = N −n −1, and the dimension of the
base B equals r, dim B = r, i.e., the dimension of B coincides with the rank

72
2. Varieties in Projective Spaces and Their Gauss Maps
of the variety X. Therefore, in the general case, the dimension n∗of its dual
variety X∗is determined by the formula
dim X∗= (N −n −1) + r = N −l −1,
(2.65)
where l = dim L = δγ(X) = n −r, and its Gauss defect is equal to
δγ(X∗) = l∗= n∗−r = (N −l −1) −r = N −n −1 = dim Ξ.
However, it may happen that dim X∗< N −l −1. Then the number
δ∗= N −l −1 −dim X∗
is called the dual defect of the variety X, and the variety X itself is said to
be dually degenerate. Note that the dual defect of tangentially nondegenerate
varieties (see p. 71) can be obtained from this new deﬁnition by taking l = 0.
Note also that dually degenerate smooth varieties in the projective space
PN are few and far between. As to dually degenerate varieties with degenerate
Gauss maps, we are aware of only a few examples of dually degenerate varieties
X with degenerate Gauss maps: the varieties X with degenerate Gauss maps
of ranks three and four in PN were considered by Piontkowski [Pio 02b].
This is why in this book we consider only dually nondegenerate varieties in
the space PN, i.e., we assume that for the variety X ⊂PN of dimension n and
rank r, the dimension of its dual variety is determined by formula (2.65).
2.5.2 The Main Theorem. The following theorem follows immediately
from the preceding considerations.
Theorem 2.8. Let X be a dually nondegenerate variety with a degenerate
Gauss map of dimension n and rank r in the space PN. Then the leaves L of
the Monge–Amp`ere foliation of X are of dimension l = n−r. The dual variety
X∗⊂(PN)∗is of dimension
n∗= N −l −1
(2.66)
and the same rank r, and the leaves L∗of the Monge–Amp`ere foliation of X∗
are of dimension
l∗= N −n −1.
(2.67)
Under this map, the plane generator L∗corresponds to a tangent subspace
Tx(X) of the variety X, and the tangent subspace Tξ(X∗) of the variety X∗
corresponds to a plane generator L, i.e., on X the tangent bundle T(X) and
the Monge–Amp`ere foliation L(X) are mutually dual.
In particular, if a variety X ⊂PN is tangentially nondegenerate, then we
have n = r, l = 0 (i.e., n∗= N −1), and the dual map (*) sends X to a

2.5
Application of the Duality Principle
73
hypersurface X∗⊂(PN)∗with a degenerate Gauss map of rank n with the
leaves L∗of the Monge–Amp`ere foliation of dimension l∗= N −n −1.
Conversely, if X is a hypersurface with a degenerate Gauss map of rank
r < N −1 in PN, then the variety X∗dual to X is a tangentially nondegenerate
variety of dimension r and rank r.
In particular, the dual map (*) sends a tangentially nondegenerate variety
X ⊂PN of dimension and rank r = n = N −2 to a hypersurface X∗⊂(Pn+2)∗
with a degenerate Gauss map of rank r, and X∗bears an r-parameter family
of rectilinear generators. Each of these rectilinear generators possesses r foci
if each is counted as many times as its multiplicity. The hypersurface X∗is
torsal and foliates into r families of torses. The original variety X bears a net
of conjugate lines corresponding to the torses of the variety X∗. Of course, the
correspondence indicated above is mutual.
We consider an irreducible, almost everywhere smooth variety X of dimen-
sion n and rank r in the space PN in more detail. The tangent bundle T(X)
of X is formed by the n-dimensional subspaces Tx tangent to X at points
x ∈X and depending on r parameters.
The subspaces Tx are tangent to
X along the plane generators L of dimension l = n −r composing on X the
Monge–Amp`ere foliation L(X). The bundle T(X) and the foliation L(X) have
a common r-dimensional base.
Let (*) be the dual map of PN onto (PN)∗. The dual map (*) sends the
variety X to a variety X∗, which is the set of all hyperplanes ξ ⊂(PN)∗
tangent to X along the leaves L of its Monge–Amp`ere foliation. The map (*)
sends the tangent bundle T(X) and the Monge–Amp`ere foliation L(X) of X
to the Monge–Amp`ere foliation L(X∗) and the tangent bundle T(X∗) of X∗,
respectively. Thus, under the dual map (*), we have
(T(X))∗= L(X∗),
(L(X))∗= T(X∗),
where dim T(X∗) = dim X∗= n∗= N −l −1 and dim L(X∗) = dim L∗= l∗
= N −n −1.
We now consider a few examples.
Example 2.9. First, we consider a simple example. Let X be a smooth spatial
curve X in a three-dimensional projective space P3. For this curve, we have
N = 3, n = r = 1, l = 0, and Tx(X) is the tangent line to X at x. The dual
map (*) sends a point x ∈X to a plane ξ ⊂X∗, and the dual variety X∗is
the envelope of the one-parameter family of hyperplanes ξ (see Figure 2.6), i.e,
X∗is a torse.
Using the formulas for n∗and l∗written earlier we ﬁnd that n∗= 2, l∗= 1.
The variety X∗bears rectilinear generators L∗along which the tangent planes

74
2. Varieties in Projective Spaces and Their Gauss Maps
ξ = T(X∗) are constant. Hence rank X∗= 1. The generators L∗of the torse
X∗are dual to the tangent lines T(X) to the curve X.
Next, we determine which varieties correspond to the varieties with de-
generate Gauss maps considered in Examples 2.4, 2.5, and 2.7.
Figure 2.6
Example 2.10. To a cone X of rank r with vertex S of dimension
l −1 (see Example 2.4), there corresponds a variety X∗lying in the subspace
T = S∗, dim T = N −l. Because dim X∗= n∗= N −l −1, the variety X∗is a
hypersurface of rank r in the subspace T. Such a hypersurface was considered
in Example 2.7.
If a tangentially nondegenerate variety X, dim X = rank X = r, belongs to
a subspace Pn+1 ⊂PN, then we can consider two dual maps in the spaces Pn+1
and PN. We denote the ﬁrst of these maps by ∗and the second by ◦. Then
under the ﬁrst map, the image of X is a hypersurface X∗⊂Pn+1, and under
the second map, the hypersurface X is transferred into a cone X◦of rank r
and dimension n◦= N −n + r −1 with an (N −n −2)-dimensional vertex
S = (Pn+1)◦and (N −n −1)-dimensional plane generators L◦= T(X)◦. It
follows that Examples 2.4 and 2.7 are mutually dual to each other.
For the torse X (see Example 2.5), we have n = l + 1, r = 1 and
n∗= N −l −1, l∗= N −l −2, i.e., the dual image X∗of a torse X is a torse.
Thus, the varieties considered in Examples 2.4, 2.5, and 2.7 are dual to
varieties considered in 2.7, 2.5, and 2.4, respectively.
Example 2.11. The Segre variety (see Griﬃths and Harris [GH 79] and
Tevelev [T 01]) S(m, n) is the embedding of the direct product of the pro-
jective spaces Pm and Pn in the space Pmn+m+n:
S : Pm × Pn →Pmn+m+n,

where i = 0, 1, . . . , m, k = 0, 1, . . . , n, and xi, yk, and zik are the coordinates
of points in the spaces Pm, Pn, and Pmn+m+n, respectively. This manifold has
the dimension m + n, dim S(m, n) = m + n.
Consider in the spaces Pm and Pn projective frames {A0, A1, . . . , Am} and
{B0, B1, . . . , Bn}. Then in the space Pmn+m+n we obtain the projective frame
{A0 ⊗B0, A0 ⊗Bk, Ai ⊗B0, Ai ⊗Bk}
(here and in what follows i, j = 1, . . . , m; k, l = 1, . . . , n) consisting of
(m + 1)(n + 1) linearly independent points of the space Pmn+m+n. The point
A0 ⊗B0 is the generic point of the variety S.
In the spaces Pm and Pn, we have the following equations:
dA0 = ω0
0A0 + ωi
0Ai, dB0 = σ0
0B0 + σk
0Bk
(see (1.71)). Hence
d(A0 ⊗B0) = (ω0
0 + σ0
0)(A0 ⊗B0) + ωi
0(Ai ⊗B0) + σk
0(A0 ⊗Bk),
and the subspace in Pmn+m+n spanned by the points A0 ⊗B0, Ai ⊗B0, and
A0 ⊗Bk is the tangent subspace to the Segre variety S at the point A0 ⊗B0:
TA0⊗B0 = Span (A0 ⊗B0, Ai ⊗B0, A0 ⊗Bk).
The second diﬀerential of the point A0 ⊗B0 has the form:
d2(A0 ⊗B0) = 2 ωi
0 σk
0 Ai ⊗Bk
(mod TA0⊗B0).
Hence the osculating subspace T 2
A0⊗B0(S) to the variety S coincides with the
entire space Pmn+m+n/TA0⊗B0, and its second fundamental forms have the
form
Φik = ωi
0σk
0.
The total number of these forms is mn.
The equations ωi
0 = 0 determine
n-dimensional plane generators on S, and the equations σk
0 = 0 determine its
m-dimensional plane generators.
Consider a tangent hyperplane to the Segre variety S at the point A0 ⊗B0.
Because such a hyperplane contains the tangent subspace TA0⊗B0, its equation
can be written in the form
ξ = ξikzik = 0,
where i = 1, . . . , m; k = 1, . . . , n, and zik are coordinates of points in the space
Pmn+m+n/TA0⊗B0. As a result, the second fundamental form of the variety S
with respect to the hyperplane ξ is
Φ(ξ) = ξik ωi
0 σk
0

76
2. Varieties in Projective Spaces and Their Gauss Maps
(see (2.21)). The forms Φ(ξ) constitute the system of the second fundamental
forms of the variety S. The mn forms Φik are linearly independent forms of
this system. The matrix of this system of second fundamental forms has the
form
Ξ =

0
(ξik)
(ξki)
0

.
In this formula (ξik) is a rectangular (m × n)-matrix and (ξki) is its transpose.
It follows that det Ξ = 0 if m ̸= n. In this case, the system of the second
fundamental forms of the variety S is degenerate, and the dual defect δ∗(S) of
S equals |n −m| : δ∗(S) = |n −m|. The variety S is dually nondegenerate if
and only if m = n.
2.5.3 Cubic Symmetroid. Now we consider the Veronese variety given
as the image of the embedding
V ∗: Sym (P2∗× P2∗) →P5∗
into the projective space P5∗. This embedding is deﬁned by the equations
xij = uiuj,
i, j = 0, 1, 2,
(2.68)
where ui are projective coordinates in the plane P2∗, i.e., tangential coordinates
in the plane P2, and xij are projective coordinates in the space P5∗, xij = xji.
Let us ﬁnd an equation of the variety V that is dual to the variety
V ∗⊂P5∗deﬁned by equations (2.68). This variety V is the envelope of the
two-parameter family of hyperplanes deﬁned in the space P5 by the equation
ξ = xijuiuj = 0,
i, j = 0, 1, 2.
(2.69)
Equation (2.69) depends on two aﬃne parameters u = u1
u0 and v = u2
u0 , and the
quantities xij occurring in (2.69) are projective coordinates in the space P5. In
order to ﬁnd the equation of the envelope of the family (2.69), we diﬀerentiate
equation (2.69) with respect to ui. The result is
∂ξ
∂ui
= xijuj = 0.
(2.70)
Eliminating the parameters uj from equations (2.70), we arrive at the equation
det (xij) = 0,

(2.71)
Equation (2.71) deﬁnes in the space P5 the cubic hypersurface dual to the
Veronese variety (2.68) and called the cubic symmetroid.
The Veronese variety V ∗deﬁned by equation (2.68) is a tangentially non-
degenerate variety in the space P5∗. Thus, by Theorem 2.8, its dual variety
V is a hypersurface with a degenerate Gauss map of rank two in the space
P5 having two-dimensional leaves L(V ) of the Monge–Amp`ere foliation on V .
The latter is dual to the tangent bundle T(V ∗) of V ∗.
Next we ﬁnd equations of the leaves L(V ) of the cubic symmetroid V .
Three hyperplanes
α0x0i + α1x1i + α2x2i = 0, i = 0, 1, 2,
(2.72)
of the space P5 have a common two-dimensional plane. It is easy to see that
the coordinates of points of this 2-plane satisfy equation (2.71). In fact, by
(2.72), the rows of the determinant on the left-hand side of (2.71) are lin-
early dependent, and hence the determinant vanishes. Hence equations (2.72)
determine two-dimensional plane generators of the symmetroid V . Because
equations (2.72) contain two variables α1
α0 and α2
α0 , the symmetroid V carries a
two-parameter family of two-dimensional plane generators.
The equation of the tangent hyperplane ξ at the point x = (xij) to the
cubic symmetroid V deﬁned by equations (2.71) has the form
∂F
∂xij yij = 0,
(2.73)
where yij are coordinates of an arbitrary point y ∈ξ.
Equation (2.73) can be written in the form
F = x00x11x22 + 2x01x12x20 −x00(x12)2 −x11(x02)2 −x22(x01)2 = 0. (2.74)

(2.75)
Consider the plane generators L0 of the cubic symmetroid V deﬁned by
equations (2.72) with α0 = α1 = 0, α2 ̸= 0. For this generator, equations
(2.72) take the form
x2i = 0.
(2.76)
This implies that only one coeﬃcient of equation (2.73), namely
∂F
∂x22 , is non-
vanishing. Hence, equation (2.73) takes the form
y22 = 0.
(2.77)
Equation (2.77) is the equation of the tangent hyperplane to V for all points
of the generators L0. As a result, the tangent hyperplane ξ is constant for all
points of the generators L0.
But all plane generators L of the cubic symmetroid V are projectively
equivalent. Thus each of them is a leaf of the Monge–Amp`ere foliation on V ,
and the symmetroid V itself is a hypersurface with a degenerate Gauss map of
rank r = 2 in the space P5. This corresponds to the contents of Theorem 2.8.
2.5.4 Singular Points of the Cubic Symmetroid. Next we ﬁnd singu-
lar points of the cubic symmetroid V deﬁned by equation (2.71). Such points
are determined by the equations
∂F
∂xij = 0.
(2.78)
Because all plane generators of the symmetroid V are projectively equivalent,
we will look for singular points on the plane generator L0 deﬁned by equations

2.5
Application of the Duality Principle
79
(2.76).
On this plane generator, all the determinants (2.75) are identically
equal to zero, except the determinant
∂F
∂x22 . As a result, singular points on the
plane generator (2.76) are determined by the equation
∂F
∂x22 = x00x11 −(x01)2 = 0.
(2.79)
Equation (2.79) deﬁnes the locus of singular points in the plane generator
L0. Hence, the locus of singular points in the plane generator L0 is a conic.
Similarly, in all other generators L of the cubic symmetroid V , the loci of
singular points are the second-degree curves (the focus curves FL (see Section
3.2, p. 100) of these generators).
From (2.75) and (2.78) it follows that the set of all singular points on the
entire cubic symmetroid V is determined by the equation
rank xij = 1
or
xij = xixj,
i, j = 0, 1, 2
(2.80)
(cf. equations (2.68)). This means that the set of singular points of the cubic
symmetroid V ⊂P5 is a Veronese surface V ∗⊂P5∗.
Most likely, all these results are well known in algebraic geometry. However,
we obtained them here by the methods of diﬀerential geometry.
Now we give one more interpretation of the properties of the cubic sym-
metroid V ⊂P5.
To this end, we denote the entries of the matrix on the
left-hand side of (2.71) by aij, i.e., we write this matrix in the form
A =


a00
a01
a02
a10
a11
a12
a20
a21
a22

, where aij = aji.
Because the matrix A is deﬁned up to a nonvanishing factor, in the projec-
tive plane P2, it determines a second-degree curve
aijxixj = 0, i, j = 0, 1, 2
(see Figure 2.7 (a)). To the cubic symmetroid V deﬁned in P5 by the equation
det A = 0,
(2.81)
there corresponds in P2 the set of second-degree curves that decompose into
two straight lines
aixi = 0, bixi = 0,
i = 0, 1, 2,
(2.82)
(see Figure 2.7 (b)).

80
2. Varieties in Projective Spaces and Their Gauss Maps
Figure 2.7
To the plane generator L ⊂V , there corresponds in P2 the set of second-
degree curves of type (2.82) decomposed into two intersecting straight lines
with a common point of intersection for all pairs. The family of these plane
generators L depends on two parameters because the points of P2 depend on
two parameters.
To a tangent hyperplane of the cubic symmetroid V ⊂P5 at the point
aij = a(i bj), there corresponds in P2 the set of second-degree curves passing
through the common point of the straight lines (2.82).
To the set of singular points of the symmetroid V ⊂P5 deﬁned by the
equation
rank A = 1,
there corresponds in P2 the set of second-degree curves degenerating into two
coinciding straight lines (see Figure 2.7 (c)).
2.5.5 Correlative Transformations.
If we have the identiﬁcation
(PN)∗= PN, the duality principle can be realized by a correlative transforma-
tion of the space PN.
Consider a correlative transformation C (a correlation) in the space PN
that maps a point x ∈PN into a hyperplane ξ ∈PN, ξ = C(x), and preserves
the incidence of points and hyperplanes. A correlation C maps a k-dimensional
subspace Pk ⊂PN into an (N −k −1)-dimensional subspace PN−k−1 ⊂PN.
We assume that the correlation C is nondegenerate, i.e., it deﬁnes a one-
to-one correspondence between points and hyperplanes of the space PN.
Analytically, a correlation C can be written in the form
ξi = cijxj, i, j = 0, 1, . . . , N,
where xi are point coordinates and ξi are tangential coordinates in the space PN
(cf. formulas (1.76) on p. 23). A correlation C is nondegenerate if det(cij) ̸= 0.
Consider a smooth curve C in the space PN and suppose that this curve does
not belong to a hyperplane. A correlation C maps points of C into hyperplanes

2.6
Hypersurface with Degenerate Gauss Map and Veronese Variety
81
forming a one-parameter family. The hyperplanes of this family envelope a hy-
persurface with a degenerate Gauss map of rank one with (N −2)-dimensional
generators (see Figure 2.6 on p. 58).
If the curve C lies in a subspace Ps ⊂PN, then a correlation C maps points
of C into hyperplanes that envelop a hypercone with an (N −s−1)-dimensional
vertex.
Further, let X = V r be an arbitrary tangentially nondegenerate r-dimen-
sional variety in the space PN. A correlation C maps points of such V r into
hyperplanes forming an r-parameter family. The hyperplanes of this family
envelop a hypersurface Y = V N−1
r
with a degenerate Gauss map of rank r.
The generators of this hypersurface X are of dimension N−r−1 and correspond
to the tangent subspaces Tx(V r).
If the tangentially nondegenerate variety V r belongs to a subspace Ps ⊂PN,
s > r, then the hypersurface Y = V N−1
r
corresponding to V r under a correla-
tion C is a hypercone with an (N −s −1)-dimensional vertex.
Now let X = V n
r be a variety with a degenerate Gauss map of rank r. Then
we can prove the following result, which fully corresponds to Theorem 2.8.
Theorem 2.12. A correlation C maps an n-dimensional dually nondegenerate
variety X = V n
r with a degenerate Gauss map of rank r with plane generators
of dimension l = n −r into a variety X∗= V N−l−1
r
, with a degenerate Gauss
map of the same rank r with (N −n −1)-dimensional plane generators.
Proof. A correlation C sends an l-dimensional plane generator L ⊂X to an
(N −l −1)-dimensional plane PN−l−1, and a tangent subspace Tx(X) to an
(N −n −1)-dimensional plane PN−n−1, where PN−n−1 ⊂PN−l−1. Because
both of these planes depend on r parameters, the planes PN−n−1 are generators
of the variety C(X), and the planes PN−l−1 are its tangent subspaces. Thus,
the variety C(X) is a variety X∗= V N−l−1
r
of dimension N −l −1 and rank
r.

and an arbitrary point ξ ∈(RP5)∗can be represented as a linear combination

(2.84)
where (u, v, w) are projective coordinates in the plane RP2. Thus, the variety
V is the embedding
ψ : Sym (P2∗× P2∗) →P5∗.
By (2.83), formula (2.84) can also be written in the form
ξ = u2A00 + v2A11 + w2A22 + 2uvA01 + 2vwA12 + 2uwA02.

not belonging to the Veronese variety V , onto the subspace (RP4)∗not tangent
to the variety V and deﬁned in (RP5)∗by the equation
x00 + x11 + x22 = 0.
(2.86)
First, we ﬁnd the projections of the vertices Aij of the frame of the space
(RP5)∗onto the subspace (RP4)∗.
Because the vertices A01, A12, and A02
belong to the subspace (RP4)∗, the projections coincide with these points:
Pr A01 = A01, Pr A12 = A12; Pr A02 = A02
(see Figure 2.8).
Figure 2.8
The projection of the vertex A00 can be found from the condition
Pr A00 = A00 −λS =

The points Pr A00, Pr A11, and Pr A22 are linearly dependent because
Pr A00 + Pr A11 + Pr A22 = 0.
(2.87)
Thus, we can take the independent points
A01, A12, A20 and Pr A00 = A00, Pr A22 = A22
(2.88)
as a basis of the subspace (RP4)∗. By (2.87), for the point Pr A11 we obtain
the expression
Pr A11 = −A00 −A22.
(2.89)
Next, we ﬁnd the projection of the Veronese variety V onto the subspace
(RP4)∗from the point S. By (2.85), (2.88), and (2.89), we have
Pr ξ = (u2 −v2) A00 + (w2 −v2) A22 + 2uvA01 + 2vwA12 + 2uwA02.
Note that a similar projection of a Veronese variety into a four-dimensional
projective space was considered earlier by Sasaki [Sas 91]. In the space RP4
dual to the subspace (RP4)∗, the last equation deﬁnes a two-parameter family
of hyperplanes ξ corresponding to the points x∗of the space (RP4)∗.
The
equation of a hyperplane ξ has the form
ξ := (u2 −v2)x00 + (w2 −v2)x22 + 2uvx01 + 2vwx12 + 2uwx02 = 0,
(2.90)
where x00, x22, x01, x12, and x02 are projective coordinates in the space RP4.
The family of hyperplanes ξ depends on two parameters u
w and v
w. Hence the
envelope of this family is a hypersurface X with a degenerate Gauss map of
rank two in the space RP4. The hypersurface X bears a two-parameter family
of rectilinear generators L that are leaves of the Monge–Amp`ere foliation on
X.
In order to ﬁnd an equation of the envelope of the family of hyperplanes ξ,
we diﬀerentiate equation (2.90) with respect to the parameters u, v, and w:

Because by Euler’s theorem on homogeneous functions, we have
u ∂ξ
∂u + v ∂ξ
∂v + w ∂ξ
∂w = 2ξ;
it follows that by (2.91) equation (2.90) is identically satisﬁed.
Eliminating the parameters u, v, and w from equations (2.91), we ﬁnd that

(2.92)
This equation determines the hypersurface X—the envelope of the family of
hyperplanes ξ—in the space RP4.
This implies the following theorem.
Theorem 2.13. The hypersurface X dual to the projection of a Veronese vari-
ety into a four-dimensional subspace is a cubic hypersurface. This hypersurface
has a degenerate Gauss map and is of rank two. It bears a two-parameter fam-
ily of rectilinear generators that are leaves of the Monge–Amp`ere foliation on
X.
Moreover, equation (2.92) proves that the hypersurface X is equivalent
to the projectivization of the set of symmetric matrices of third order with
vanishing determinant and trace.
2.6.2 Singular Points. Let us ﬁnd singular points of the hypersurface X
deﬁned by equation (2.92). In order to do this, we write this equation in the
form
Φ = −x00x22(x00 + x22) + 2x01x02x12
+(x02)2(x00 + x22) −x00(x12)2 −x22(x01)2 = 0.
(2.93)
Singular points of the hypersurface X are deﬁned by the equations

∂x00 = −2x00x22 −(x22)2 + (x02)2 −(x12)2 = 0,
(2.94)

∂x12 = 2x01x02 −2x00x12 = 0,
(2.96)
∂Φ
∂x02 = 2x01x12 + 2x02(x00 + x22) = 0,

and
∂Φ
∂x22 = −(x00)2 −2x00x22 + (x02)2 −(x01)2 = 0.

Equations (2.95) and (2.96) imply that
x12 = λx01, x02 = λx00, x22 = λ2x00,
(2.99)
where, of course, λ ̸= 0. Substituting these expressions into equations (2.94),
(2.97), and (2.98) and dividing by λ or λ2, we arrive at the same equation
(x01)2 + (1 + λ2)(x00)2 = 0,
from which it follows that

Equations (2.99) and (2.100) determine the desired singular points F and F
on the hypersurface X. These points are complex conjugate on the straight
line F ∧F.
It is easy to see that the straight line F ∧F belongs to the hypersurface X
deﬁned by equation (2.84). In fact, it follows from (2.99) and (2.100) that the
coordinates (x00, x22, x01, x12, x02) of an arbitrary point F +sF of this line are
(1 + s, λ2(1 + s), i

1 + λ2(1 −s), iλ

1 + λ2(1 −s), λ(1 + s))x00.
Substituting these coordinates into the left-hand side of equation (2.93), we
obtain zero.
NOTES
2.1–2.2. Our presentation of the projectivization of the tangent and osculating
subspaces of a submanifold X is close to that in the paper [GH 79] by Griﬃths and
Harris (see also the book [AG 93] by Akivis and Goldberg).
The diﬀerential geometry of the Grassmannian was considered by Akivis in [A 82].
The osculating spaces, fundamental forms, and asymptotic directions and lines of
a submanifold X were investigated by ´E. Cartan in [C 19]. See more on the second
fundamental forms of X in Griﬃths and Harris [GH 79] and Landsberg [L 94].
Note that the proof of our Theorem 2.1 is diﬀerent from that of Theorem 2.2 in
[AG 93], which has some inaccuracies.
This theorem generalizes a similar theorem of C. Segre (see [SegC 07], p. 571),
which was proved for submanifolds X of dimension n of the space PN that have at
each point x ∈X the osculating subspace T 2
x of dimension n + 1. By this theorem,
a submanifold X either belongs to a subspace Pn+1 or is a torse.

Notes
87
Note that C. Segre proved the theorem named after him for a submanifold of a
multidimensional space of constant curvature.
Note also that Theorem 2.1 is similar to Theorem 3.10 from the book [AG 93] by
Akivis and Goldberg, which was proved there for submanifolds of a space PN bearing
a net of conjugate lines.
2.3. Zak [Za 87] (see also his book [Za 93] and the paper [Ra 84] by Ran) proved
that the Gauss map of a smooth variety is ﬁnite (see also the books [FP 01] by
Fischer and Piontkowski (subsections 2.3.3 and 3.1.3); [Ha 92] by Harris (p. 189);
[L 99] by Landsberg (p. 48); [T 01] by Tevelev (Sections 3.3 and 4.2); and the book
[Za 93] by Zak). In terms of diﬀerential geometry, Zak’s theorem can be formulated
as follows: The image of the Gauss map γ(X) of a smooth irreducible variety X ⊂PN
of dimension n, which is diﬀerent from a linear space, is a smooth irreducible variety
γ(X) ⊂G(n, N) of the same dimension n.
From the point of view of diﬀerential geometry, this result is more or less obvious:
If a variety X is smooth in PN, then its Gauss map γ(X) has the rank r = n (i.e.,
X is tangentially nondegenerate).
Fischer [F 88] extends to the complex analytic case a classical result on ruled
surfaces in E3. He shows that the only developable surfaces in CP3 are planes, cones,
and tangent surfaces of curves. He also shows that a developable ruled surface is
uniquely determined by its directrix and its Gauss map.
The origins of the theory of varieties with degenerate Gauss maps are in the
works of C. Segre [SegC 07, 10] who studied the local diﬀerential geometry of linear
spaces. In particular, in [SegC 07, 10], he introduced the Segre cone of such families
and used the concepts of the second fundamental forms and foci.
Varieties X = V n
r with degenerate Gauss maps of rank r < n were considered by
´E. Cartan in [C 16] in connection with his study of metric deformation of hypersur-
faces, and in [C 19] in connection with his study of manifolds of constant curvature;
by Yanenko in [Ya 53] in connection with his study of metric deformation of subman-
ifolds of arbitrary class; by Akivis in [A 57, 62], Savelyev in [Sa 57, 60], and Ryzhkov
in [Ry 60] (see also the survey paper by Akivis and Ryzhkov [AR 64]) in a projective
space PN. Brauner [Br 38], Wu [Wu 95], and Fischer and Wu [FW 95] studied such
varieties in a Euclidean N-space EN.
Note that a relationship of the rank of varieties V m and their deformation in a
Euclidean N-space was indicated by Bianchi as far back as 1905. In [Bi 05] he proved
that a necessary condition for V m to be deformable is the condition rank V m ≤2.
Allend¨orfer [Al 39] introduced the notion of type t, t = 0, 1, , . . . , m, of V m and
proved that varieties VN−p, p > 1, of type t > 2 in EN are rigid. For deﬁnition of
type of V m, see [Al 39] or Yanenko [Ya 53]. Note only that the notion of type (as
well as of rank) is projectively and metrically invariant, and that for a hypersurface,
the type coincides with the rank.
Griﬃths and Harris in [GH 79] (Section 2, pp.
383–393) considered varieties
X = V n
r with degenerate Gauss maps from the point of view of algebraic geometry.
Following [GH 79], Landsberg [L 96] considered varieties with degenerate Gauss maps.
His recently published book [L 99] is in some sense an update to the paper [GH 79].

2. Varieties in Projective Spaces and Their Gauss Maps
Section 5 (pp. 47–50) of these notes is devoted to varieties with degenerate Gauss
maps.
In the recently published book [FP 01] by Fischer and Piontkowski, the
authors studied ruled varieties from the point of view of complex projective algebraic
geometry. One section of this book was devoted to varieties with degenerate Gauss
maps (they called such varieties developable). Following Griﬃths and Harris’s paper
[GH 79], the authors employed a bilinear second fundamental form for studying
developable varieties, gave detailed and more elementary proofs of some results in
[GH 79], and reported on some recent progress in this area.
In particular, they
gave a classiﬁcation of developable varieties of rank two in codimension one. Rogora
in [Rog 97] and Mezzetti and Tommasi in [MT 02a] also considered varieties with
degenerate Gauss maps from the point of view of algebraic geometry.
Recently Ishikawa published four papers [I 98, 99a, 99b] and [IM 01] on varieties
with degenerate Gauss maps (called “developable” in these papers).
In [IM 01],
Ishikawa and Morimoto found the connection between such varieties and solutions
of Monge–Amp`ere equations; they named the foliation of plane generators L of X
(dim L = l) the Monge–Amp`ere foliation. In [IM 01], the authors proved that the
rank r of a compact C∞-hypersurface X ⊂R PN with a degenerate Gauss map is
an even integer r satisfying the inequality r(r+3)
2
> N, r ̸= 0. In particular, if r < 2,
then X is necessarily a projective hyperplane of R PN, and if N = 3 or N = 5, then a
compact C∞-hypersurface with a degenerate Gauss map is a projective hyperplane.
In [I 98, 99b], Ishikawa found a real algebraic cubic nonsingular hypersurface
with a degenerate Gauss map in RPN for N = 4, 7, 13, 25, and in [I 99a] he studied
singularities of C∞-hypersurfaces with degenerate Gauss maps.
The notion of the index l of relative nullity was introduced by Chern and Kuiper
in their joint paper [CK 52] (see also the book by Kobayashi and Nomizu [KN 63],
vol. 2, p. 348) for a variety X = V n embedded into a Riemannian manifold V N.
However, the second fundamental forms of a submanifold X are related not so
much to the metric structure of X as to its projective structure, because these forms
are preserved under projective transformations of the Riemannian submanifold X.
This was noticed by Akivis in [A 87b], who also proved the relation l + r = n.
Note that if l > 0, then the point x is called a parabolic point of the variety X. If
all points of a variety X are parabolic, then the variety X is called parabolic (cf. the
papers [Bor 82, 85] by Borisenko). The varieties X, for which the index l is constant
and greater than 0 for all points x ∈X, are called strongly parabolic.
In 1997 Borisenko published the survey paper [Bor 97] in which he discussed re-
sults on strongly parabolic varieties and related questions in Riemannian and pseudo-
Riemannian spaces of constant curvature and, in particular, in a Euclidean space EN.
Among other results, he gives a description of certain classes of varieties of arbitrary
codimension that are analogous to the class of parabolic surfaces in a Euclidean space
E3. Borisenko also investigates the local and global metric and topological properties,
indicates conditions that imply that a variety of a Euclidean space EN is cylindri-
cal, presents results on strongly parabolic varieties in pseudo-Riemannian spaces of
constant curvature, and ﬁnds the relationship with minimal surfaces.
2.4.
The results presented in this section are due to Akivis [A 57] (see also

Notes
89
Section 4.2 in the book [AG 93] by Akivis and Goldberg).
In our presentation,
we follow the recently published paper [AG 01a] by Akivis and Goldberg.
Other
examples of varieties with degenerate Gauss maps can be found in the papers [A 87a]
by Akivis, [AG 93, 98b, 98c, 01a, 01b, 02b] by Akivis and Goldberg, [AGL 01] by
Akivis, Goldberg, and Landsberg, [C 39] by Cartan, [FW 95] by Fischer and Wu,
[GH 79] by Griﬃths and Harris, [I 98, 99a, 99b, 00a] by Ishikawa, [Pio 01, 02a, 02b] by
Piontkowski, [S 60] by Sacksteder, [Wu 95] by Wu, [WZ 02] by Wu and F. Zheng, and
in the books [L 99] by Landsberg and [FP 01] by Fischer and Piontkowski. Examples
of varieties with degenerate Gauss maps on the sphere Sn were constructed in the
recent papers [IKM 01, 02] by Ishikawa, Kimura, and Miyaoka.
2.5. The reader can ﬁnd more details on the dual varieties and the dual defect
of a tangentially nondegenerate variety, for example, in the following books: Fischer
and Piontkowski [FP 01] (Sections 2.1.4, 2.1.5, 2.3.4, 2.5.1, 2.5.3, and 2.5.7); Harris
[Ha 92] (pp. 196–199); Landsberg [L 99] (pp. 16–17 and 52–57); and Tevelev [T 01]
(Chapters 1, 6, and 7).
Formula (2.65) for the expected dimension of the dual
variety of a variety with degenerate Gauss map appeared also in the paper [Pio 2b]
by Piontkowski and implicitly in the books Landsberg [L 99] (see 7.2.1.1 and 7.3i)
and Fischer and Piontkowski [FP 01] (Section 2.3.4).
During the last 20 years, the smooth dually degenerate varieties (for which
dim X∗< N −1) were considered in many articles (see, for example, the papers
[GH 79] by Griﬃths and Harris, Zak [Za 87], Ein [E 85, 86] and the books [Ha 92] by
Harris, [L 99] by Landsberg, [T 01] by Tevelev, [FP 01] by Fisher and Piontkowski).
Note that Harris [Ha 92] (p. 197) uses the term deﬁcient for such varieties and the
term deﬁciency for their defect.
The classiﬁcation of dually degenerate smooth varieties of small dimensions n
with positive dual defect δ∗was found by Ein [E 85, 86] for n ≤6, by Ein [E 85, 86]
and Lanteri and Strupa [LS 87] for n = 7, and by Beltrametti, Fania, and Sommese
[BFS 92] for n ≤10 (see also Section 9.2.C in the book [T 01] by Tevelev).
For applications of the duality principle see also the book [AG 93] by Akivis and
Goldberg. In our presentation of these applications, we follow our recently published
papers [AG 01a, 02b] and Section 4.1 of the book [AG 93].
The dual defect of a variety X must be deﬁned as the diﬀerence between an ex-
pected dimension of the dual variety X∗and its true dimension. Thus, the deﬁnition
given on p. 71 and used in the literature (see, for example, Fischer and Piontkowski
[FP 01] (p. 55); Harris [Ha 92] (p. 199); Landsberg [L 99] (p. 16); and Tevelev
[T 01] (p. 3) is correct for smooth varieties because for them an expected dimension
of the dual variety X∗equals N −1. In the books mentioned above, the deﬁnitions
of the dual defect and dually degenerate varieties given on p. 71, which are correct
for tangentially nondegenerate varieties, are automatically extended to varieties with
degenerate Gauss maps. In our opinion, this is incorrect, because for the latter vari-
eties, an expected dimension of X∗is N −l −1 < N −1 (see formula (2.65)), and for
them the correct deﬁnition of the dual defect (and dually degenerate varieties) must
be the deﬁnitions given on p. 72. Note that the deﬁnition on p. 72 includes the def-
inition on p. 71: the latter can be obtained from the former if one takes l = 0. Note

90
2. Varieties in Projective Spaces and Their Gauss Maps
also that by deﬁnition on p. 72, the dual defect δ∗of a dually nondegenerate variety
equals 0 (and this is natural), while by the deﬁnition on p. 71, δ∗= δγ = n −r > 0.
2.6. The constructions we made in Section 2.6 can be generalized for the projec-
tive space KP over the algebras K = R, C, H, O, where C is the algebra of complex
numbers, H is the algebra of quaternions, and O is the algebra of Cayley’s octonions
or octaves (see more on octonions and the algebra of Cayley’s octonions in Rosenfeld
[Ro 97], Section 1.3.1). Then dim K = 2i−1, i = 1, 2, 3, 4. In all these algebras, there
is an involutive or antiinvolutive automorphism z →z.
This was done by Ishikawa in [I 99a], who constructed examples of real al-
gebraic cubic nonsingular hypersurfaces with degenerate Gauss maps in RPn for
n = 4, 7, 13, 25. These hypersurfaces have the structure of homogeneous spaces of
groups SO(3), SU(3), Sp(3), and F4, respectively, and their projective duals are lin-
ear projections of Veronese embeddings of projective planes KP2 for K = R, C, H, O.

Chapter 3
Basic Equations of
Varieties with Degenerate
Gauss Maps
In Section 3.1, we deﬁne the Monge–Amp`ere foliation associated with a variety with a de-
generate Gauss map of dimension n, derive the basic equations of varieties with degenerate
Gauss maps, and prove a characteristic property of such varieties (the Monge–Amp`ere folia-
tion has ﬂat leaves) of any of their plane generators. At the end of Section 3.1, for varieties
with degenerate Gauss maps we prove the generalized Griﬃths–Harris Theorem, which be-
comes the well-known Griﬃths–Harris Theorem for tangentially nondegenerate varieties (see
the paper [GH 79] by Griﬃths and Harris). In Section 3.2, we consider focal images of such
varieties (the focus hypersurfaces and the focus hypercones). In Section 3.3, we study va-
rieties with degenerate Gauss maps without singularities, in Section 3.4, we introduce and
investigate an important class of varieties with degenerate Gauss maps without singularities,
the so-called Sacksteder–Bourgain hypersurface, in the aﬃne space A4, and in Section 3.5,
we consider complete parabolic varieties in Riemannian spaces of constant curvature.
3.1
The Monge–Amp`ere Foliation
3.1.1 The Monge–Amp`ere Foliation Associated with a Variety with a
Degenerate Gauss Map. We consider a variety X with a degenerate Gauss
map of dimension n and rank r in the space PN. Let
γ : X →G(n, N)
91

92
3. Basic Equations
be its Gauss map. Denote by L a leaf of the Gauss map γ. This leaf is the
preimage of the tangent subspace Tx(X) on the variety X:
L = γ−1(Tx) = γ−1(γ(x)).
The foliation on X deﬁned as indicated above is called the Monge–Amp`ere
foliation (see, for example, the papers by Delano¨e [De 89] and Ishikawa [I 98,
99b]).
A leaf L of this foliation, as well as the tangent subspace Tx(X), depends
on r parameters. Denote by M an r-dimensional variety of parameters deﬁning
a displacement of the subspace Tx on X, and let (ul+1, . . . , un) be coordinates
of a point of M.
The Monge–Amp`ere foliation is deﬁned by a completely integrable system
of Pfaﬃan equations
ωp = 0,
p = l + 1, . . . , n,
whose ﬁrst integrals are coordinates (ul+1, . . . , un) of a point u ∈M.
Because the 1-forms ωα
i occurring in equations (2.40) deﬁne a displacement
of the subspace Tx on X, on the variety X, these forms must be expressed in
terms of precisely r linearly independent forms, i.e., we have
rank (ωα
i ) = r.
If x = A0 is a regular point of the variety X, then we can take as these
independent forms the forms
ωp
0 = ωp, p = l + 1, . . . , n,
determining a displacement of the point x transversally to the leaf Lx of the
Monge–Amp`ere foliation. These forms are basis forms on the manifold M and
on the Monge–Amp`ere foliation of the variety X. They are linear combinations
of the diﬀerentials dup of coordinates of a point u ∈M.
3.1.2 Basic Equations of Varieties with Degenerate Gauss Maps.
We write the expressions of the forms ωα
i
in terms of the forms ωq,
q = l + 1, . . . , n, as follows:
ωα
i = bα
iqωq,
q = l + 1, . . . , n.
(3.1)
Because the matrix (bα
ij), i, j = 1, . . . , n, is symmetric, this matrix takes the
form

pq = bα

(3.2)
where Op×q is the zero matrix with p rows and q columns. In what follows,
we will assume that there is at least one nondegenerate matrix of rank r in

3.1
The Monge–Amp`ere Foliation
93
the system (ξαbα
pq) of second fundamental tensors of X. By the generalized
Griﬃths–Harris theorem (see p. 97), this means that the variety X in question
is dually nondegenerate.
In what follows we will use the following ranges of indices:
a, b, c = 1, . . . , l; p, q = l + 1, . . . , n; α, β = n + 1, . . . , N.
We will choose the points of our moving frame as follows: the point A0 = x
is a regular point of X; the points Aa belong to the leaf L of the Monge–
Amp`ere foliation passing through the point A0; the points Ap together with
the points A0, Aa deﬁne the tangent subspace TLX to X; and the points Aα
are located outside the subspace TLX.
It follows from equations (2.5), (3.1) and (3.2) that
ωα = 0, ωα
a = 0,
(3.3)
ωα
p = bα
pqωq,
(3.4)
where, as earlier, bα
pq = bα
qp, and the indices take the values indicated above.
The 1-forms ωq are basis forms of the Gauss image γ(X) of the variety X, and
the quantities bα
pq form the second fundamental tensor of the variety X at the
point x.
By (3.3), the equations of inﬁnitesimal displacement of the moving frame
associated with a variety X with a degenerate Gauss map have the form

where here and in what follows, unless otherwise stated, the indices take the

Taking exterior derivatives of equations (3.3), we obtain the following ex-
terior quadratic equations:
ωp
a ∧ωα
p = 0.
(3.6)
Substituting expressions (3.4) into equations (3.6), we ﬁnd that
bα
pqωp
a ∧ωq = 0.
(3.7)
Let us prove that, as was the case for the forms ωα
p , the forms ωp
a can be
expressed in terms of the basis forms ωq alone. Suppose that decompositions
of the forms ωp
a have the following form:
ωp
a = cp
aqωq + cp
aξωξ,
(3.8)

94
3. Basic Equations
where the forms ωξ are 1-forms that are linearly independent themselves, and
the set {ωq, ωξ} is also linearly independent. Substituting these expressions
into equations (3.7), we ﬁnd that
bα
sqcs
apωp ∧ωq + bα

aξωξ ∧ωq = 0.
Because the exterior products ωp ∧ωq and ωξ ∧ωq are independent, it follows
from these relations that
bα
sqcs
ap = bα
spcs
aq
(3.9)
and
bα
pqcp
aξ = 0.
(3.10)
The last system is a linear homogeneous system with respect to the quantities
cp
aξ. Because the forms ωα
p cannot be expressed in terms of less than r linearly
independent forms, the rank of the matrix of coeﬃcients of system (3.10) is
equal to r, and the system has only the trivial solution, cp
aξ = 0.
Hence
equations (3.8) take the form:
ωp
a = cp
aqωq,
(3.11)
where the coeﬃcients cp
aq are connected with the coeﬃcients bα
pq by conditions
(3.9).
Note that conditions (3.9) will play an important role in our future
investigations, and we will apply them many times. For this reason, we framed
these conditions.
We shall call equations (3.4) and (3.11) the basic equations of a variety X
with a degenerate Gauss map.
Note that under transformations of the points Ap, the quantities cp
aq are
transformed as tensors.
As to the index a, the quantities cp
aq do not form
a tensor with respect to this index. Nevertheless, under transformations of
the points A0 and Aa, the quantities cp
aq along with the unit tensor δp
q are
transformed as tensors. For this reason, the system of quantities cp
aq is called
a quasitensor.
Denote by Bα and Ca the (r ×r)-matrices of coeﬃcients occurring in equa-
tions (3.4) and (3.11):
Bα = (bα
pq), Ca = (cp
aq).
Sometimes we will use the identity matrix C0
=
(δp
q) and the index
i = 0, 1, . . . , l, i.e., {i} = {0, a}. Then equations (3.2) and (3.9) can be com-
bined and written as follows:

The Monge–Amp`ere Foliation

are symmetric.
3.1.3 The Structure of Leaves of the Monge–Amp`ere Foliation.
In examples considered in Section 2.4 we saw that the leaves of the Monge–
Amp`ere foliation are straight lines or planes. The following theorem proves
that this is the general fact.
Theorem 3.1. The leaves of the Monge–Amp`ere foliation associated with a
variety X with a degenerate Gauss map of dimension n and rank r are l-
dimensional planes, where l = n −r.
Proof. On a variety X, consider the system of equations
ωp = 0,
(3.13)
deﬁning the Monge–Amp`ere foliation. By (2.6) and (3.11), we have
dωp = ωq ∧(ωp
q −δp
qω0
0 −cp
aqωa).
(3.14)
By the Frobenius theorem, equations (3.14) imply that the system of equations
(3.13) is completely integrable and deﬁnes a foliation of the variety X into
(n −r)-dimensional varieties.
Let us prove that all these varieties are planes. In fact, if ωp = 0, then by
(3.11), the ﬁrst two of equations (3.5) take the form
dA0 = ω0
0A0 + ωaAa,
dAa = ω0
aA0 + ωb
aAb.
(3.15)
This means that if ωp = 0, then the l-plane deﬁned by the points A0 and Aa
remains constant. Thus the varieties deﬁned on X by the system of equations
(3.13) are planes of dimension l. Namely, these l-planes are the leaves of the
Monge–Amp`ere foliation associated with X.
The same system of equations (3.13) implies that if ωp = 0, then in addition
to equations (3.15), we have the equations
dAp = ω0
pA0 + ωa
pAa + ωq
pAq.
(3.16)
Equations (3.15) and (3.16) mean that the tangent subspace Tx(X) along the
ﬁxed l-plane A0 ∧A1 ∧. . . ∧Al remains constant.
Thus, in Theorem 3.1, we have proved that the leaves of the Monge–Amp`ere
foliation associated with the variety X are l-dimensional planes
L = A0 ∧A1 ∧. . . ∧Al

96
3. Basic Equations
or their open parts. The tangent subspace Tx(X) remains constant along the
leaves L of this foliation. For this reason, it is natural to denote this subspace
by TL, L ⊂TL. A pair (L, TL) on X depends on r parameters ul+1, . . . , un,
the coordinates of the point u ∈M.
In what follows, we extend the leaves L of the Monge–Amp`ere foliation to
the entire projective space Pl in which they are located (L ∼Pl). The leaves
L ∼Pl of the Monge–Amp`ere foliation are plane generators of the variety X.
Note that the Monge–Amp`ere foliation is not locally trivial because its leaves
have singular points (which we will consider in Section 3.2).
We shall call the varieties of this type projectively complete. The notion of
geodesic completeness, used when one studies varieties with degenerate Gauss
maps in the Euclidean geometry, cannot be used here because in projective ge-
ometry the geodesics on submanifolds cannot be deﬁned. In a certain sense, the
notion of projective completeness replaces the notion of geodesic completeness
in the Euclidean (and Riemannian) geometry.
However, unlike a traditional deﬁnition of the foliation (see, for example,
Dubrovin, Fomenko, and Novikov [DFN 85], §29), as we will see in Section 3.2,
the leaves of the Monge–Amp`ere foliation can have singularities. It is for this
reason that in general its leaves are not diﬀeomorphic to a standard leaf Pl.
3.1.4 The Generalized Griﬃths–Harris Theorem. In Section 2.5.1,
we deﬁned the dual variety X∗⊂(PN)∗for a variety X ⊂PN with a degen-
erate Gauss map of dimension n and rank r as the set of tangent hyperplanes
ξ (ξ ⊃TLX) to X. It follows that the dual variety X∗is a ﬁbration whose
ﬁber is the bundle
Ξ = {ξ|ξ ⊃TLX}
of hyperplanes ξ containing the tangent subspace TLX and whose base is the
manifold
B = X∗/Ξ.
As we noted in Section 2.5.1, the dimension of a ﬁber Ξ of this ﬁbration equals
N −n −1, and the dimension of the base B equals r, dim B = r, i.e., the
dimension of B coincides with the rank of the variety X. This implies that in
the general case,
dim X∗= (N −n −1) + r = N −l −1
(cf. formula (2.65)).
As was noted in Section 2.5.1, for a dually degenerate variety X with a
degenerate Gauss map, we have
dim X∗< N −l −1.

3.1
The Monge–Amp`ere Foliation

The following theorem expresses this condition in terms of the second fun-
damental forms of the variety X.
Theorem 3.2 (Generalized Griﬃths–Harris Theorem). The dual vari-
ety X∗⊂(PN)∗of a variety X with a degenerate Gauss map is dually degen-
erate if and only if at all smooth points x ∈X every second fundamental form
of the system of second fundamental forms II = ξαbα
pqωpωq of X is degenerate.
Proof. Consider the bundle R(X) of frames associated with a variety X with a
degenerate Gauss map, which we constructed earlier in this section. The basis
forms of the bundle R(X), as well as the basis forms of the tangent bundle
T(X) and the Monge–Amp`ere foliation of the variety X, are also called the
horizontal forms, and the secondary forms of all these bundles are called the
ﬁber or vertical forms (see, for example, Section 20.2 of the book [Di 71] by
Dieudonn´e). The forms ωp, p = l + 1, . . . , n, are linearly independent, and
their number equals r. Thus, these forms are basis forms in the bundle R(X).
On the bundle R(X) the equations of inﬁnitesimal displacement of a frame
have the form (3.5).
In this proof we will use the following ranges of indices:
0 ≤u, v ≤N,
1 ≤i, j ≤n,
1 ≤a, b ≤l,
l + 1 ≤p, q ≤n,
n + 1 ≤α, β ≤N,
n + 1 ≤ρ, σ ≤N −1.
Consider now the dual coframe (or tangential frame) {αu} in the space
(PN)∗to the frame {Au} constructed in Section 1.3.
The hyperplanes αu
of the frame {αu} are connected with the points of the frame {Au} by the
conditions (see equations (1.77)):
(αu, Av) = δu
v .
(3.17)
Conditions (3.17) mean that the hyperplane αu contains all points Av, v ̸= u,
and that the condition of normalization (αu, Au) = 1 (cf.
formula (1.70))
holds.
We proved in Section 1.3 that the equations of inﬁnitesimal displacement
of the tangential frame {αu} are
dαu = ωu
v αv, u, v = 0, 1, . . . , N,
(3.18)
where the forms ωv
u are related to the forms ωv
u by the following formulas:
ωu
v = −ωu
v

3. Basic Equations
(see equations (1.78)). Hence equations (3.18) can be written as
dαu = −ωu
v αv

(see equations (1.79)).

The N −n−1 forms ωN
σ determine the inﬁnitesimal displacement of the hyper-
plane ξ = αN in the bundle Ξ of tangent hyperplanes ξ containing the tangent
subspace TLX, i.e., these forms are the ﬁber forms on the dual variety X∗.
The number N −n −1 coincides with the dimension of a ﬁber of this bundle.
Hence, forms ωN
σ are linearly independent.
A basis of the ﬁbration X∗is the span SN of the forms ωN

ωN
p are horizontal on X∗. Because
ωN
p = bN
pqωq, bN
pq = bN

the dimension of SN does not exceed the rank r = n −l of the variety X.
Consider the exterior product
ωN

pq) ωl+1 ∧. . . ∧ωn.
It is easy to see that dim SN = rank (bN
pq), and dim SN < r if and only if
det (bN
pq) = 0.
Because αN was any of the hyperplanes αβ, we have
det (bβ
pq) = 0.
Moreover, the tangent hyperplane ξ can be chosen arbitrarily from the
system ξ = ξβαβ. This system of tangent hyperplanes passing through the
tangent subspace TLX determines the system of second fundamental forms
II = ξβbβ

of this variety X. This proves the theorem statement: the variety X is dually
degenerate if and only if the system of its second fundamental forms II does
not contain any nondegenerate form.
Note that if r = n (i.e., if a variety X is tangentially nondegenerate), then
its dual variety X∗is dually degenerate if and only if at all smooth points x ∈X
every second fundamental form of the system of second fundamental forms
II = ξαbα
ijωiωj of X is degenerate. We emphasize that unlike in Theorem 3.2,
the basis forms here are the forms ωi, i = 1, . . . , n.
This is exactly Theorem 3.5 proved by Griﬃths and Harris in [GH 79]. This
is why we called Theorem 3.2 the generalized Griﬃths–Harris theorem.
Corollary 3.3. A variety X with a degenerate Gauss map is dually nondegen-
erate (i.e., the dimension of its dual variety X∗⊂(PN)∗equals N −l −1) if

of X.

3.2.1 The Focus Hypersurfaces. Let X = V n
r be a variety with a degen-
erate Gauss map of rank r in the space CPN. By Theorem 3.1, such a variety
carries an r-parameter family of l-dimensional plane generators L of dimension
l = n −r. Let x = x0A0 + xaAa be an arbitrary point of a generator L. For
such a point we have
dx = (dx0 + x0ω0
0 + xaω0
a)A0 + (dxa + x0ωa + xbωa
b )Aa + (x0ωp + xaωp
a)Ap.
By (3.11), it follows that
dx ≡(x0δp
q + xacp
aq)Apωq
(mod L).
(3.20)
The matrix (Jp
q ) = (x0δp
q + xacp
aq) is the Jacobi matrix of the map γ : X →
G(n, N), and the determinant
J(x) = det (Jp
q ) = det (x0δp
q + xacp
aq)
of this matrix is the Jacobian of the map γ.
We recall that in Section 2.1.1 we call a point x ∈X a regular point of
the map f and of the variety X if dim TxX = dim X = n, and we call x ∈X

100
3. Basic Equations
singular if dim TxX > dim X = n. It is easy to see that at regular points
J(x) ̸= 0 and at singular points J(x) = 0. The set of all singular points of the
variety X was denoted by Sing X.
By (3.20), the set of singular points of a generator L of the variety X is
determined by the equation
det (δp
qx0 + cp
aqxa) = 0.
(3.21)
Hence this set is an algebraic hypersurface in the generator L of dimension
l −1 and degree r. This hypersurface (in L) is called the focus hypersurface1
and is denoted FL. Obviously, we have Sing X = ∪FL.
Note that extending the leaves L of the Monge–Amp`ere foliation to the
space Pl (see Section 3.1) means that we include singular points FL of L into
L. Essentially, by adding FL to L, we consider the closure of the leaf L, and
this closed leaf carries the structure of the projective space Pl.
Because for xa = 0 the left-hand side of equation (3.21) takes the form
det (x0δp
q) = (x0)r,
it follows that the point A0 is a regular point of the generator L.
We now calculate the second diﬀerential of a point x ∈L:
d2x ≡ωα
s (ωsx0 + ωs
axa)Aα
(mod Tx).
This expression is the second fundamental form of the variety X:
IIx = ωα
s (ωsx0 + ωs
axa)Aα = bα
ps(δs
qx0 + cs
aqxa)Aαωpωq.
(3.22)
Theorem 3.4. The number of linearly independent forms in the system of
second fundamental forms of a variety X with a degenerate Gauss map of rank
r is constant at all regular points of its plane generator L.
Proof. Suppose that ξ = ξαxα = 0 is the tangent hyperplane to X at x ∈L,
ξ ⊃TL. Then
(ξ, IIx) = hpq(ξ, x)ωpωq,
where
hpq(ξ, x) = ξαbα
ps(δs
qx0 + cs
aqxa),
hpq = hqp,
is the second fundamental form of the variety X at x with respect to the
hyperplane ξ. Because at regular points x ∈L the inequality J(x) ̸= 0 holds,
the rank of the matrices (hpq(ξ, x)) is the same as the rank of the matrix
B(ξ) = (ξαbα
pq) = ξαBα,
(3.23)
1We use the term ”focus hypersurface” for the locus of foci in a plane generator L of a
variety X. We will use the term ”focal variety” for the locus of foci in the entire variety X.

3.2

101
and this rank is the same at all regular points x ∈L. Denote this rank by m.
3.2.2 The Focus Hypercones. We call a tangent hyperplane ξ = (ξα)
singular (or a focus hyperplane) if
det (ξαbα
pq) = 0,
(3.24)
i.e., if the rank of matrix (3.23) is reduced. Condition (3.24) is an equation
of degree r with respect to the tangential coordinates ξα of the hyperplane
ξ containing TL(X). Because we assume that the variety X is dually nonde-
generate, by Corollary 3.3, there exists at least one nondegenerate form in the
system of second fundamental forms of X. Hence in the space PN, equation
(3.24) deﬁnes an algebraic hypercone of degree r, whose vertex is the tangent
subspace TL(X). This hypercone is called the focus hypercone and is denoted
ΦL (see Akivis and Goldberg [AG 93], p. 119). In the dual space (PN)∗, equa-
tions (3.24) deﬁne an algebraic hypersurface Φ∗of degree r belonging to the
leaf L∗of the Monge–Amp`ere foliation on the variety X∗dual to X.
Note that if a variety X is dually degenerate, then on such a variety, equa-
tions (3.24) are satisﬁed identically, and X does not have focus hypercones.
The determinant det (ξαbα
pq) on the left-hand side of equation (3.24) is the
Jacobian of the dual map γ∗: X∗→G(r, N). The map γ∗sends a hyperplane
ξ tangent to the variety X (i.e., an element of the variety X∗) to a leaf L of
the Monge–Amp`ere foliation that belongs to the hyperplane ξ.
The focus hypersurface FL ⊂L (deﬁned in Section 3.2.1) and the focus
hypercone ΦL with vertex TL are called the focal images of the variety X with
a degenerate Gauss map.
Note that under the passage from the variety X ⊂PN to its dual variety
X∗⊂(PN)∗, the systems of square matrices Ca and Bα as well as the focus
hypersurfaces FL and the focus cones ΦL exchange their roles.

L(X).
Its dimension is

L(X) = n + m,

dent scalar second fundamental forms of the variety X at its regular points.
However, because at a regular point x ∈Xsm the condition J(x) ̸= 0 holds
(see p. 97), m is the number of linearly independent points among the points
Apq = Aαbα
pq.
The number m is constant for all regular points of a generator L of the variety
X. We also use the notation SL for the osculating space T 2
L(X).
On a generator L of the variety X, consider the system of equations
δq
px0 + cq
apxa = 0.
(3.26)
The matrix of system (3.26) has r2 rows and l + 1 columns. Denote the rank
of this matrix by m∗. If m∗< l + 1, then system (3.26) deﬁnes a subspace KL
of dimension k = l −m∗in L. This subspace belongs to the focus hypersurface
FL deﬁned by equation (3.21). If l > m∗, then the hypersurface FL becomes a
cone with vertex KL. We call the subspace KL the characteristic subspace of
the generator L.
Note also that by the duality principle in PN, the osculating subspace SL
and the characteristic subspace KL constructed for a pair (L, TL) correspond
to one another.
In what follows, we assume that a variety X in question does not have
singular points except the foci determined by equation (3.21), and its dual X∗
does not have singular hyperplanes except the focus hyperplanes determined
by equation (3.24).
3.2.3 Examples. First we will ﬁnd the foci and the focus hypersurfaces FL
for some of examples considered in Section 2.3.
Example 2.4. For a cone X, the focus hypersurface FL in each its plane
generators L is the cone vertex S.
Example 2.5. For a torse, in the case n = 2, r = 1 (i.e., for X = V 2
1 ⊂PN)
formed by the tangents to a nonplanar curve in PN (see Sections 2.2.4 and
Figure 2.3 for N = 3), each of its rectilinear generators L has one singular
point (a focus), and the tangent subspace of X at this point degenerates into
a straight line. The set of all singular points of such X forms the
edge of
regression of this variety with a degenerate Gauss map.
Note that in Examples 2.4 and 2.5 the focus variety FL of the generator L
is a subspace of dimension l −1. However, for a cone in Example 2.4, FL is
ﬁxed, while for a torse in Example 2.5, FL depends on one parameter and is
itself a torse of dimension one.
Example 2.6. For a join, the points y1 and y2 are foci of the generator L, and
the curves Y1 and Y2 are degenerate focus varieties (see Figure 2.4 on p. 69).

3.2
Focal Images
103
There are two cones through every generator L. These cones are described
by generators passing through the focus y1 or the focus y2. On the variety
X, these cones form two one-parameter families comprising a focal net of the
variety X.
Example 2.7.
For a hypersurface X = V 3
2 ⊂P4 on Figure 2.5 (the case
n = 3, r = 2), the focus hypersurface FL in each of its one-dimensional plane
generators L is decomposed into a pair of points y1 and y2 called the foci.
These foci y1 and y2 describe two two-dimensional focal surfaces Y1 and Y2.
Note that Example 2.6 diﬀers from Example 2.7 because in Example 2.6 the
foci describe the curves while in Example 2.7 they describe two-dimensional
surfaces.
Example 2.9. For the cubic symmetroid deﬁned by equation (2.71), the focus
curve FL in a two-dimensional generator L is a conic (see formula (2.79) on
p. 79). The manifold of these curves on the symmetroid (2.71) is a Veronese
variety deﬁned in the space (P5)∗by the equation
rank (aij) = 1.
Example 3.5. (See also Section 5.3, p.
184.)
Let X be a variety with a
degenerate Gauss map of dimension n and rank r = n −1.
The leaves of
the Monge–Amp`ere foliation on X can be considered as light rays. The focus
hypersurfaces FL ⊂L decompose into r points on L. Each of these points
describe an n-dimensional variety F(p), p = 1, . . . , r. From the point of view of
geometric optics, the varieties F(p) are the loci of condensation of light rays.
They are called the caustics (see, for example, §2 of Chapter 2 in the book
[AVGL 89] by Arnol’d, Vasil’ev, Goryunov, and Lyashko). Of course, only the
cases N = 2 and N = 3 are discussed in optics.
Although in this book we assume that n < N, the case n = N is also
interesting. Then a variety X is the congruence (i.e., an (n −1)-parameter
family) of straight lines. The congruence of straight lines in a three-dimensional
projective, Euclidean, and non-Euclidean spaces were studied in detail by many
geometers starting from Monge [Mon 50] (for a detailed theory of congruences
see the book [Fi 50] by Finikov).
3.2.4 The Case n = 2. We now consider the case n = 2, i.e., X2 ⊂PN.
In this case, we have 0 ≤r ≤2. As we already know, if r = 2, then X is a
tangentially nondegenerate smooth surface. If r = 0, then X is P2. In this case,
Bα = 0 and Ci = 0, and there are no singularities (the focus hypersurfaces FL
and the focus hypercones ΦL are indeterminate).
Suppose that r = 1. Because in each of the pencils ξαBα and ξiCi, there is
at least one nondegenerate matrix, and C0 = (δp
q), we have rank Bα = 1, and
rank Ca ≤1.

104
3. Basic Equations
In this case, the generator L depends on one parameter. The indices p, q
take only one value, 2, and equation (3.21) of the focus hypersurface FL takes
the form
x0 + c2
12x1 = 0.
Thus, in this case the focus hypersurface FL is a point. Equation (3.24) of the
focus hypercone ΦL takes the form
ξαbα
22 = 0.
Thus, in this case the focus hypercone ΦL is a hyperplane.
In general, the surface X2 is a torse. If the above mentioned point is held
ﬁxed, i.e., it is the same for all rectilinear generators L, then the surface X2
of rank one is a cone.
3.2.5 The Case n = 3. In this case, we have 0 ≤r ≤3. As was in
the previous case, if r = 3, then X3 is a tangentially nondegenerate smooth
hypersurface, and if r = 0, then X is P3.
Suppose ﬁrst that r = 2, and as a result, l = 1.
Because the variety
X is dually nondegenerate, in each of the pencils ξαBα and ξiCi, there is
at least one nondegenerate matrix, and C0 = (δp
q), we have rank Bα = 2,
and rank Ca ≤2. In this case, the rectilinear generator L depends on two
parameters. The indices p and q take only two values, 2 and 3, and equation
(3.21) of the focus hypersurface FL takes the form
det (δq
px0 + cq
1px1) = 0, p, q = 2, 3,
i.e., it has the form

x0 + c2
12x1
c3
12x1
c2
13x1
x0 + c3
13x1
 = 0.
This equation deﬁnes two foci. Denote them by F1 and F2. We present here
a complete classiﬁcation of three-dimensional varieties X for which F1 ̸= F2.
A classiﬁcation of varieties X with a double focus, i.e., when F1 = F2, will be
given in Section 4.5.2.
If F1 ̸= F2, then the following cases are possible:
a) The points F1 and F2 describe two-dimensional surfaces (F1) and (F2),
and the rectilinear generators L are tangent to (F1) and (F2) along the
lines composing conjugate nets on (F1) and (F2) (see Figure 2.5 on p. 70).
b) The points F1 and F2 describe the same irreducible two-dimensional sur-

3.3
Algebraic Hypersurfaces with Degenerate Gauss Maps in P4
105
face (F) having two components (F1) and (F2). The rectilinear genera-
tors L are tangent to the components (F1) and (F2).
c) The point F1 describes a two-dimensional surface (F1), the point F2 de-
scribes a curve (F2), and the rectilinear generators L = F1F2 are tangent
to the surface (F1) and intersect the curve (F2). Then the variety X
foliates into ∞1 cones with vertices on the curve (F2), and the surface
(F1) has a conic conjugate net.
d) Both points F1 and F2 describe curves (F1) and (F2), and the rectilinear
generators L intersect both of these curves (see Figure 2.4 on p. 69).
Then the variety X foliates into two families of cones whose vertices
describe the curves (F1) and (F2). So, X is a join (see Example 2.6 in
Section 2.4).
e) Both points F1 and F2 describe curves (F1) and (F2) that are parts of a
curve γ not belonging to a three-dimensional space. Then the variety X
is described by bisecants to the curve γ.
Note that the case when the point F1 describes a two-dimensional surface
(F1) in PN, N ≥4, and the point F2 is ﬁxed is impossible. If it were possible,
then the rectilinear generators L = F1F2 would be tangent to the surface (F1)
and would pass through the point F2. But for such a conﬁguration, the point
F1 is not a focus of L.
Suppose next that r = 1, and as a result, l = 2. In this case, p, q = 3, and
equation (3.21) of the focus hypersurface FL takes the form
x0 + c3
13x1 + c3
23x2 = 0.
Thus, in this case the focus hypersurface FL is a straight line. Therefore, the
variety X foliates into ∞1 of 2-planes that are osculating planes of a generic
curve γ. The focus straight lines FL are tangent to the curve γ.
In particular, if all FL have a common point, then the variety X is a cone.
This cone is a cone over a developable surface formed by tangents to a curve
γ belonging to a three-dimensional subspace.
3.3
Some Algebraic Hypersurfaces with
Degenerate Gauss Maps in P4
The question arises: Do there exist in the space PN varieties with degenerate
Gauss maps of rank r without singularities?
The preceding considerations
imply that from the complex point of view, a variety X = V n
r with a degenerate

106
3. Basic Equations
Gauss map of rank r does not have singularities if and only if it is an n-plane
Pn, i.e., if r = 0. From the real point of view, a variety X = V n
r
with a
degenerate Gauss map of rank r does not have real singularities if and only if
its focal images in the plane generators are pure imaginary, and this situation
can occur only if the rank r is even.
Note that in the theory of varieties with degenerate Gauss maps, the com-
plex point of view is necessary only for studying focal images deﬁned by alge-
braic equations.
We consider now two examples: one in which a variety X has real singu-
larities and one in which X does not have real singularities. Other examples
will be considered in Chapter 4.
Example 3.6. We consider the hypercubic X3 ⊂P4 deﬁned by
X3 = {(x, y, t, w) ∈P4 | w = (x2 + y2 + 2txy)/(1 −t2)},
where (x, y, t, w) are nonhomogeneous coordinates in P4. Introduce homoge-
neous coordinates (x0, x1, x2, x3, x4) by setting
x1 = xx0, x2 = yx0, x3 = tx0, x4 = wx0.
Then the equation of X3 becomes
F(x0, x1, x2, x3, x4) = x0(x2
1 + x2
2) + 2x1x2x3 −x4(x2
0 −x2
3) = 0,
(3.27)
where xα, α = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, are the coordinates of a point x ∈P4 with respect
to the ﬁxed frame formed by the points
E0(1, 0, 0, 0, 0), E1(0, 1, 0, 0, 0), E2(0, 0, 1, 0, 0), E3(0, 0, 0, 1, 0), E4(0, 0, 0, 0, 1).
Let us ﬁnd singular points of the hypercubic X3. Such points are deﬁned
by the equations
∂F
∂xα = 0, α = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. It follows from (3.27) that

two real 2-planes, π1 and π2, deﬁned by the ﬁrst two equations of (3.30) and
(3.31), respectively. A rectilinear generator of X3 joins two arbitrary points
of the conics C1 and C2. In fact, take two arbitrary points of C1 and C2:
x = (x0, x1, −x1, x0, x2
1/x0) ∈C1 and y = (y0, y1, y1, −y0, y2
1/y0) ∈C2. Con-
sider an arbitrary point z = x + λy on the straight line x ∧y. Its coordinates
are
z = x + λy = (x0 + λy0, x1 + λy1, −x1 + λy1, x0 −λy0, x2
1/x0 + λy2
1/y0).
A straightforward calculation shows that these coordinates satisfy equation
(3.27) for any λ. So, the straight line L = x ∧y ∈X3 is a rectilinear generator
of X3. The hypercubic X3 deﬁned by equation (3.27) is a join with directrices
C1 and C2 (see Example 2.6), and as a result, X3 is hypersurface with a
degenerate Gauss map of rank two. A tangent hyperplane to X3 is determined
by the points x ∈C1 and y ∈C2 and the straight lines tangent to C1 and C2
at these points (see Figure 3.1).

Systems (3.30) and (3.31) have the same third equation. This equation de-
termines
a

hypercone
whose
vertex
is
the

line
S = E2 ∧E3 deﬁned by the equations x0 = x1 = x4 = 0, and the 2-planes π1
and π2 do not have common points with the vertex E2 ∧E3 of this hypercone.
Hence, they intersect this hypercone along two conics C1 and C2. Thus, we
have a complete description of the hypercubic X deﬁned by equation (3.27).
In this example, we also have l = 1 and m = 1. The hypercubic X3 foliates
into two family of real cones, whose vertices belong to one of the curves C1 or
C2 and whose director manifold is the second of these curves.
Let us ﬁnd the form of the matrices Bα and Ci for this example.
We
consider the conic C1 deﬁned by (3.30). It follows from the last equation of
(3.30) that
x1
x0
= x4
x1
= t,
and as a result,
x1 = tx0, x4 = t2x0.
In addition, equations (3.30) imply that
x3 = x0, x2 = −tx0.

Thus, taking x0 = 1, we obtain a point x = (1, t, −t, 1, t2) ∈C1.
In a similar manner, we ﬁnd from equations (3.31) of the second conic C2
that
y1 = sy0, y4 = s2y0, y3 = −y0, y2 = sy0,
and taking y0 = 1, we get a point y = (1, s, s, −1, s2) ∈C2.
We choose now as the vertices A0 and A1 of our moving frame the following
points:

A0 = 1
2(x + y) = (1, 1
2(t + s), 1
2(s −t), 0, 1
2(t2 + s2)),
A1 = 1
2(x −y) = (0, 1
2(t −s), −1
2(t + s), 1, 1
2(t2 −s2)).
Diﬀerentiating the points A0 and A1, we ﬁnd that

We take the points 1
2(0, 1, −1, 0, 2t) and 1
2(0, 1, 1, 0, 2s) as the vertices A2 and
A3 of our moving frame:
A2 = 1
2(0, 1, −1, 0, 2t), A3 = 1
2(0, 1, 1, 0, 2s).
Diﬀerentiating A2 and A3, we obtain
dA2 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1)dt, dA3 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1)ds.
We take the point (0, 0, 0, 0, 1) as the vertex A4 of our moving frame:
A4 = E4 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1).
The points A0, A1, A2, A3, and A4 are linearly independent. We take them as
the vertices of our moving frame.
Thus, for the frame {A0, A1, A2, A3, A4}, we have the following equations

the focus hypersurface FL in the generator L = A0 ∧A1 consists of two real

Example 3.7. (See Wu and F. Zheng [WZ 02].) We consider the hypercubic

X3 = {(x, y, t, w) ∈P4|w = (x2 −y2 + 2txy)/(1 + t2)},
where (x, y, t, w) are nonhomogeneous coordinates in RP4. Introduce homoge-
neous coordinates (x0, x1, x2, x3, x4) by setting
x1 = xx0, x2 = yx0, x3 = tx0, x4 = wx0.

3. Basic Equations
Systems (3.35) and (3.36) determine two conics C and C that are inter-
sections of two complex conjugate 2-planes π and π deﬁned by the ﬁrst two
equations of (3.35) and (3.36), respectively. The third (common) equation of
these systems deﬁnes a real hypercone with a one-dimensional vertex E2 ∧E3
deﬁned by the equations x0 = x1 = x4 = 0. This common third equation of
(3.35) and (3.36) can be written in the form
x1
x0
= x4
x1
.
Deﬁne complex parameters σ = t + is and σ = t −is on the conics C and
C by setting on C
x1 = σ x0.
Then on this conic we obtain
x2 = iσ x0, x3 = ix0, x4 = σ2x0.
Similarly, on the conic C, we obtain
x1 = σ x0, x2 = −iσ x0, x3 = −ix0, x4 = σ2 x0.
Taking in these relations x0 = 1 (i.e., in nonhomogeneous coordinates), we
ﬁnd that
x = (1, σ, iσ, i, σ2) ∈C
(3.37)
and
x = (1, σ, −iσ, −i, σ2) ∈C.
(3.38)
Consider the real straight line L deﬁned by the points x and x. Its arbitrary
real point u has the form
u = λx + λx.
By (3.37) and (3.38), the coordinates u0, u1, u2, u3, and u4 of this point are



u0 = λ + λ,
u1 = λσ + λσ,
u2 = i(λσ −λσ),
u3 = i(λ −λ),
u4 = λσ2 + λσ2.
Substituting these coordinates into equation (3.32), we can see that this equa-
tion becomes an identity. Thus, the straight line L belongs to the hypercubic
(3.32), and this hypersurface is ruled.

3.3
Algebraic Hypersurfaces with Degenerate Gauss Maps in P4
113
Moreover, because the points x and x of the straight line L describe the conics
C and C, the hypercubic (3.32) is a join with directrices C and C (see Example
2.6).
As a result, the hypercubic (3.32) is a real hypersurface X3 with a
degenerate Gauss map of rank two in the space P4. A tangent hyperplane to
X3 is determined by the points x ∈C and x ∈C and the straight lines tangent
to C and C at these points (see Figure 3.2).
As we noted earlier, the common third equation of systems (3.35) and
(3.36) determines a real second-order hypercone with a one-dimensional vertex
x0 = x1 = x4 = 0, and the 2-planes π and π do not pass through this vertex.
These 2-planes intersect this hypercone along two conics C and C. Complex
conjugate points x ∈C and x ∈C deﬁne real rectilinear generators L = x ∧x
of the hypercubic X deﬁned by (3.32). The tangent hyperplanes to X along
L are constant because they are determined by the generator x ∧x and the
complex conjugate tangents to C and C at the points x and x. Thus, we have
a complete description of the hypercubic X deﬁned by equation (3.32).
In this example l = 1 and m = 1. The hypercubic X3 foliates into two
families of complex conjugate hypercones.
Let us ﬁnd the form of the matrices B4, C0, and C1 for this hypercubic.

To this end, we choose as the vertices A0 and A1 of our moving frame the

following real points:
A0 = 1

2i(x −x).
Applying (3.37) and (3.38), we ﬁnd the coordinates of these points:

A0 = (1, t, −s, 0, t2 −s2),
A1 = (0, s, t, 1, 2ts).

dA1
= (0, ds, dt, 0, 2(sdt + tds))
= (0, 0, 1, 0, 2s)dt + (0, 1, 0, 0, 2t)ds.
We take the points (0, 1, 0, 0, 2t) and (0, 0, −1, 0, −2s) as the vertices A2 and
A3 of our moving frame:
A2 = (0, 1, 0, 0, 2t), A3 = (0, 0, −1, 0, −2s).
Then the last equations take the form

dA0 = dt A2 + ds A3,
dA1 = ds A2 −dt A3.
This shows that the points A1, A1, A2, and A4 deﬁne the 3-plane TL that is
tangent to X along the rectilinear generator L.
Diﬀerentiating A2 and A3, we obtain
dA2 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 2)dt, dA3 = (0, 0, 0, 0, −2)ds.
We take the point (0, 0, 0, 0, 2) as the vertex A4 of our moving frame:
A4 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 2).
Then the diﬀerentials dA2 and dA3 take the form

So, the focus hypersurface FL in the generator L = A0 ∧A1 consists of two
complex conjugate points:
A0 + iA1 = x and A0 −iA1 = x.
Therefore, the hypersurface with a degenerate Gauss map deﬁned in the space

3.4
The Sacksteder–Bourgain Hypersurface
3.4.1 The Sacksteder Hypersurface. In Cartesian coordinates (y1, y2, y3, y4),
Sacksteder’s hypersurface S ⊂A4 is deﬁned by the equation
y4 = y1 cos(y3) + y2 sin(y3)
(3.39)
(see Sacksteder [S 60]).
We introduce in the space A4 homogeneous coordinates (x0, x1, x2, x3, x4)
such that yα = xα
x0 , α = 1, 2, 3, 4, and we enlarge this space to a projective
space P4 by means of the improper hyperplane P3
∞deﬁned by the equation
x0 = 0. Consider the natural extension of the hypersurface S in the space P4
and denote it by the same letter S. The equations for the hypersurface S can
be represented in the parametric form






x0 = s,
x1 = −sv sin u + t cos u,
x2 = sv cos u + t sin u,
x3 = su,
x4 = t.
(3.40)
Equations (3.40) can be written in the form
X = sA0 + tA1,
where

A0 = (1, −v sin u, v cos u, u, 0),
A1 = (0, cos u, sin u, 0, 1)
are points of the space P4 = A4 ∪P3
∞. The straight lines L = A0 ∧A1 are the
generators of the hypersurface S deﬁned by (3.39), because equation (3.39) is
satisﬁed identically if we substitute the coordinates of the point X into this
equation. Diﬀerentiating the points A0 and A1, we obtain

dA0 = A2 du + A3dv,
dA1 =
A3du,
where

A2 = (0, −v cos u, −v sin u, 1, 0),
A3 = (0, −sin u, cos u, 0, 0).
It can be easily veriﬁed that the points A0, A1, A2, and A3 are linearly in-
dependent. Because u and v are constant along L, the tangent hyperplane

3.4
The Sacksteder–Bourgain Hypersurface
117
TL = A0 ∧A1 ∧A2 ∧A3 remains constant along the straight line L = A0 ∧A1.
This hyperplane, like a rectilinear generator L of the hypersurface S, depends
solely on the parameters u and v. Thus, rank S = 2.
We ﬁnd the singular points (foci) of a generator L = A0 ∧A1 of the hyper-
surface S ⊂P4 in the same manner as for the general case in Section 2.3. A
point X = sA0 + tA1 is the focus of this generator if dX ∈A0 ∧A1, whence it
follows that, for the focus,
s(A2du + A3dv) + tA3du = 0.
Because the points A2 and A3 are linearly independent, it follows that

s du
= 0,
t du + s dv = 0.
(3.41)
Figure 3.3
This system should have a nontrivial solution relative to du and dv, which
deﬁnes a focal direction on S. Consequently,

the

focus
of
the
line
A0 ∧A1. By equations (3.41), the torses on the hypersurface S are deﬁned

118
3. Basic Equations
by the equation du = 0, and these torses are the pencils of straight lines
with centers at the points A1 = {0, cos u, sin u, 0, 1} located in the 2-planes
β = A0 ∧A1 ∧A3, where A3 = dA1
du . With respect to a ﬁxed frame, the planes
β are deﬁned by the equations

x3 = ux0,
x4 = x1 cos u + x2 sin u.
(3.42)
The 2-planes β belong to S and are its plane generators (see Figure 3.3).
They form a one-parameter family depending on the parameter u. But Tx(S)
is ﬁxed only along a generator L = A0 ∧A1 ⊂β. This is why rank X = 2 (not
1). The point A1 describes the conic C in P3
∞deﬁned by the equations







x0 = 0,
x3 = 0,
(x1)2 + (x2)2 = (x4)2,
(3.43)
which can be easily derived from A1 = (0, cos u, sin u, 0, 1). Because A3 = dA1
du ,
the straight line A1 ∧A3 is tangent to the conic C at the point A1.
Thus, the hypersurface S deﬁned by equation (3.39) in the space A4, has
no singularities in the proper domain of this space, because they have “re-
treated” to the hyperplane at inﬁnity P3
∞of this space. On the other hand,
the hypersurface S is not a cylinder. Such hypersurfaces are called twisted
cylinders.
The example we discussed can be easily generalized. Let γ be an arbitrary
complete smooth curve in the hyperplane at inﬁnity H∞of an aﬃne space
AN. Suppose that this curve is described by the point A1 = A1(u). We set
A3 = dA1
du , and let β = β(u) be the smooth family of proper tangent 2-planes
of the curve γ. These 2-planes form a complete regular variety X = V 3
2 of
rank r = 2 on which the Monge–Amp`ere foliation is formed by the pencils of
straight lines with centers at the points A1 located in the 2-planes β. The
proof of this assertion diﬀers little from our investigation of the structure of
hypersurface (3.39) in A4.
3.4.2 The Bourgain Hypersurface. Recently Wu [Wu 95] published an
example of a noncylindrical algebraic hypersurface with a degenerate Gauss
map in a Euclidean space E4 that has a degenerate Gauss mapping but does
not have singularities. This example was constructed (but not published) by
Bourgain (see also Ishikawa [I 98, 99a, 99b]).
This example can be considered in an aﬃne space A4 (and even in a projec-
tive space P4). In the aﬃne space A4, in Cartesian coordinates (x1, x2, x3, x4)

(3.45)
In (3.45) make the following admissible change of Cartesian coordinates:
x2 + x3 →x2, x2 + 2x3 →x3.
Then equation (3.45) becomes
x1x2
4 + x2x4 −x3 = 0.
(3.46)
Introduce homogeneous coordinates in A4 by setting xi = zi
z0
, i = 1, 2, 3, 4.
Then equation (3.46) takes the form
g(z0, z1, z2, z3, z4) = z1z2
4 + z0z2z4 −z2
0z3 = 0.
(3.47)
Equation (3.47) deﬁnes a cubic hypersurface G in the space A
4 = A4∪P3
∞which
is an enlarged space A4, i.e., it is the space A4 enlarged by the hyperplane at
inﬁnity P3
∞(whose equation is z0 = 0).
Denote by Eα, α = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ﬁxed basis points of the space A
4. Suppose
that these points have constant normalizations, i.e., that dEα = 0. An arbi-
trary point z ∈A
4 can be written in the form z = 
α zαEα. We take a proper
point of the space A
4 as the point E0, and take four linearly independent points
at inﬁnity as the points E1, E2, E3, E4.
Equation (3.47) shows that the proper straight line E0 ∧E4 deﬁned by the
equations z1 = z2 = z3 = 0 and the plane at inﬁnity deﬁned by the equations
z0 = z4 = 0 belong to the hypercubic G deﬁned by equation (3.47).
We write the equations of the hypercubic G in a parametric form. To this
end, we set
z0 = 1, z4 = p, z1 = u, z3 = pv.
Then it follows from (3.47) that
z2 = v −pu.
This implies that an arbitrary point z ∈G can be written as
z = E0 + uE1 + vE2 + p(E4 −uE2 + vE3).

3. Basic Equations
The parameters p, u, and v are nonhomogeneous coordinates on the hypercu-
bic G.
Let us ﬁnd singular points of the hypercubic G. Such points are deﬁned by
the equations ∂g
∂zα
= 0. It follows from (3.47) that

∂g

(3.49)
All these derivatives vanish simultaneously if and only if z0 = z4 = 0. Thus
the 2-plane at inﬁnity σ = E1 ∧E2 ∧E3 is the locus of singular points of the
hypercubic G.
Consider a point A0 = E0 +pE4 = (1, 0, 0, 0, p) on the straight line E0 ∧E4.
It follows from (3.47) that to the point A0 there is the corresponding straight
line a(p) in the 2-plane at inﬁnity σ, and the equation of this straight line is
p2z1 + pz2 −z3 = 0.
(3.50)
The family of straight lines a(p) depends on the parameter p. Its envelope is
determined by equation (3.50) and the equation
2pz1 + z2 = 0.
Excluding parameter p from the last two equations, we ﬁnd that the envelope
is the conic C deﬁned by the equation
z2
2 + 4z1z3 = 0.
(3.51)
The straight line a(p) is tangent to the conic C at the point
A1(p) = E1 −2pE2 −p2E3.
(3.52)
Equation (3.52) is a parametric equation of the conic C. The point
dA1
dp = −2(E2 + pE3)
(3.53)
belongs to the tangent line to the conic C at the point A1(p).
Consider the 2-planes τ = A0 ∧A1 ∧dA1
dp . Such 2-planes are completely
determined by the location of the point A0 on the straight line E0 ∧E4, and

3.4
The Sacksteder–Bourgain Hypersurface
121
they form a one-parameter family. All these 2-planes belong to the hypercubic
G. In fact, represent an arbitrary point z of the 2-plane τ in the form
z = αA0 + βA1 −1
2γ dA1
dp
= αE0 + βE1 + (−2pβ + γ)E2 + (−p2β + pγ)E3 + pαE4.
(3.54)
The coordinates of the point z are
z0 = α, z1 = β, z2 = γ −2pβ, z3 = p(γ −pβ), z4 = pα.
(3.55)
Substituting these values of the coordinates into equation (3.47), one can see
that equation (3.47) is identically satisﬁed. Thus the hypercubic G is foliated
into a one-parameter family of 2-planes τ(p) = A0 ∧A1 ∧dA1
dp .
In a 2-plane τ(p) consider a pencil of straight lines with center A1. The
straight lines of this pencil are deﬁned by the point A1 and the point
A2 = E2 + pE3 + q(E0 + pE4). The straight lines A1 ∧A2 depend on two
parameters p and q. These lines belong to the 2-plane τ(p), and along with
this 2-plane they belong to the hypercubic G. Thus they form a foliation on
the hypercubic G.
We prove that this foliation is a Monge-Amp`ere foliation. In the space A
4,
we introduce the moving frame formed by the points

(3.57)
Consider a displacement of the straight lines A1 ∧A2 along the hypercubic
G. Suppose that Z is an arbitrary point of this straight line,
Z = A1 + λA2.
(3.58)

122
3. Basic Equations
Diﬀerentiating (3.58) and taking into account (3.57) and dEα = 0, we ﬁnd that
dZ ≡(2qdp + λdq)A0 + λdp(A3 + qA4)
(mod A1, A2).
(3.59)
It follows from relation (3.59) that:
1. A tangent hyperplane to the hypercubic G is spanned by the points
A1, A2, A0 and A3 + qA4. This hyperplane is ﬁxed when the point Z
moves along the straight line A1 ∧A2. Thus, G is a hypersurface with a
degenerate Gauss map of rank 2, and the straight lines A1 ∧A2 form a
Monge-Amp`ere foliation on G.
2. The system of equations

2q dp + λdq = 0,
λ dp
= 0
(3.60)
deﬁnes singular points on the straight line A1 ∧A2, and on the hypersur-
face G it deﬁnes torses. The system of equations (3.60) has a nontrivial
solution with respect to dp and dq if and only if its determinant vanishes:
λ2 = 0. Hence by (3.58), a singular point on the straight line A1 ∧A2 co-
incides with the point A1. For λ = 0, system (3.60) implies that dp = 0,
i.e., p = const. Thus it follows from (3.52) that the point A1 ∈C is
ﬁxed, and as a result, the torse corresponding to this constant parameter
p is a pencil of straight lines with the center A1 located in the 2-plane
τ(p) = A0 ∧A1 ∧A2.
3. All singular points of the hypercubic G belong to the conic C ⊂P∞
deﬁned by equation (3.52). Thus if we consider the hypercubic G in an
aﬃne space A4, then on G there are no singular points in a proper part
of this space.
4. The hypercubic G considered in the proper part of an aﬃne space is not
a cylinder because its rectilinear generators do not belong to a bundle of
parallel straight lines. A two-parameter family of rectilinear generators
of G decomposes into a one-parameter family of plane pencils of parallel
lines.
None of these properties characterizes Bourgain’s hypersurfaces completely:
they are necessary but not suﬃcient for these hypersurfaces. The following
theorem gives a necessary and suﬃcient condition for a hypersurface to be of
Bourgain’s type.

3.4
The Sacksteder–Bourgain Hypersurface
123
Theorem 3.8. Let l be a proper straight line of an aﬃne space A4 enlarged
by the hyperplane at inﬁnity P3
∞, and let C be a conic in the 2-plane σ ⊂P3
∞.
Suppose that the straight line l and the conic C are in a projective correspon-
dence. Let A0(p) and A1(p) be two corresponding points of l and C, and let τ
be the 2-plane passing through the point A0 and tangent to the conic C at the
point A1. Then
(a) when the point A0 is moving along the straight line l, the plane τ describes
a Bourgain hypersurface, and
(b) any Bourgain hypersurface satisﬁes the described construction.
Proof. Necessity (b) of the theorem hypotheses follows from our previous con-
siderations. We prove suﬃciency (a) of these hypotheses. Take a ﬁxed frame
{Eα}, α = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, in the space A4 enlarged by the plane at inﬁnity P3
∞as
follows: its point E0 belongs to l, the point E4 is the point at inﬁnity of l,
and the points E1, E2, and E3 are located at the 2-plane at inﬁnity σ in such
a way that a parametric equation of the straight line l is A0 = E0 + pE4, and
the equation of C has the form (3.52). The plane τ is deﬁned by the points
A0, A1, and dA1
dp . The parametric equations of this plane have the form (3.55).
Excluding the parameters α, β, γ, and p from these equations, we return to the
cubic equation (3.47) deﬁning the Bourgain hypersurface B in homogeneous
coordinates.
The method of construction of the Bourgain hypersurface used in the proof
of Theorem 3.8 goes back to the classical methods of projective geometry
developed by Steiner [St 32] and Reye [R 68].
3.4.3 Local Equivalence of Sacksteder’s and Bourgain’s Hyper-
surfaces. In Section 3.4.2, we investigated Bourgain’s hypersurface B. In
particular, we proved that, as was the case for the Sacksteder hypersurface S,
the Bourgain hypersurface has no singularities because they “go to inﬁnity”
and compose a conic C in the hyperplane at inﬁnity H∞. This analysis suggests
an idea that Bourgain’s and Sacksteder’s hypersurfaces should be equivalent.
Moreover, this analysis showed that a hypersurface constructed in these exam-
ples is torsal, i.e., it is stratiﬁed into a one-parameter family of plane pencils
of straight lines.
Now we prove the following theorem.
Theorem 3.9. The Sacksteder hypersurface S and the Bourgain hypersurface
B are locally equivalent, and the former is the standard covering of the latter.
Proof. In a Euclidean space E4, in Cartesian coordinates (x1, x2, x3, x4), the
equation of the Sacksteder hypersurface S (cf. equation (3.39)) has the form
x4 = x1 cos x3 + x2 sin x3.
(3.61)

124
3. Basic Equations
The right-hand side of this equation is a function on the manifold M 3 = R2×S1
because the variable x3 is cyclic. Equation (3.61) deﬁnes a hypersurface on
the manifold M 3 × R.
The circumference S1 = R/(2πZ), where Z is the
set of integers, has a natural projective structure of P1. In the homogeneous
coordinates x3 = u
v , the mapping S1 →P1, can be written as x3 →(u, v). By
removing the point {v = 0} from S1, we obtain a one-to-one correspondence
S1\{v = 0} ←→R1.
(3.62)
Now we can consider the Sacksteder hypersurface S in A4 or, if we enlarge A4
by the plane at inﬁnity P3
∞, in the space P4.
Next we show how by applying the mapping S1 →P1, we can transform
equation (3.61) of the Sacksteder hypersurface S into equation (3.47) of the
Bourgain hypersurface B. We write this mapping in the form
x3 = 2 arctan u
v ,
u
v ∈R, |x3| < π.

(3.64)
Substituting these expressions into equation (3.61), we ﬁnd that
x4(u2 + v2) = x1(v2 −u2) + 2x2uv,
i.e.,
(x4 + x1)u2 + (x4 −x1)v2 −2x2uv = 0.
(3.65)
Make a change of variables
z1 = x4 −x1, z2 = −2x2, z3 = x1 + x4, z0 = u, z4 = v.
As a result, we reduce equation (3.65) to equation (3.47). It follows that the
Sacksteder hypersurface S deﬁned by equation (3.44) is locally equivalent to
the Bourgain hypersurface deﬁned by equation (3.47).
Note also that if the cyclic parameter x3 changes on the entire real axis
R, then we obtain the standard covering of the Bourgain hypersurface B by
means of the Sacksteder hypersurface S.

3.4.4 Computation of the Matrices Ci and Bα for Sacksteder–
Bourgain Hypersurfaces. We now compute the matrices Ci and Bα for
Sacksteder–Bourgain’s hypersurfaces. In Section 3.4.2, for Sacksteder–Bour-
gain’s hypersurface deﬁned by parametric equation (3.39), we choose the fol-

A3 = (0, −sin u, cos u, 0, 0).
(3.66)

dA3 = (0, −cos u, −sin u, 0, 0)du.
We take as the point A4 of our moving frame the point

Then the diﬀerentials dA2 and dA3 take the form:

dA2 = −v duA3 + dvA4,

Complete Varieties with Degenerate
Gauss Maps in Real Projective and
Non-Euclidean Spaces
3.5.1 Parabolic Varieties. With varieties with degenerate Gauss maps in
a projective space PN there are associated the so-called parabolic varieties in
simply connected Riemannian spaces of constant curvature.
In Section 2.3 we deﬁned the index l(x) of relative nullity (the Gauss defect)
of the variety X, dim X = n, at the point x. It was related to the rank r of
X by the equation l = n −r. If l(x) > 0, then the point x ∈X is called a
parabolic point of the variety X. If all points of a variety X are parabolic, then
the variety X is called parabolic.
Varieties X of a Riemannian space VN of a constant Gauss defect l(x) = l
are called l-parabolic varieties (cf. the papers [Bor 82, 85] by Borisenko).
We will now study complete l-parabolic varieties in real simply connected
Riemannian spaces VN
c
of constant curvature c.
If c = 0, then VN
c
is the
Euclidean space EN. If c > 0, then VN
c
is the elliptic space SN. If c < 0,
then VN
c is the hyperbolic space HN. Each of these spaces admits a geodesic
mapping into the space PN, which is usually called the projective realization
of the corresponding space VN
c .
The Euclidean space EN is realized in the projective space PN from which
a hyperplane E∞has been removed (this hyperplane is called improper or
the hyperplane at inﬁnity), and the proper domain of the space EN can be
identiﬁed with the open simply connected manifold PN\E∞. The elliptic space
SN is realized in the entire projective space PN, because the absolute of SN
is an imaginary hyperquadric and its proper domain coincides with the entire
space PN.
Finally, the hyperbolic space HN is realized in the part of the
projective space PN lying within the convex hyperquadric that is the absolute
of this space. This open simply connected domain is the proper domain of
the hyperbolic space HN. We denote by G the proper domain of the simply
connected space VN
c in all these cases.
Let X, dim X = n, be a complete parabolic variety of a space VN
c of con-
stant curvature. Suppose that X has a constant Gauss defect l. Let X be
the image of X in the domain G of the space PN in which the space VN
c
is
realized, and let 
X be the natural extension of this image in the space PN, so
that X = 
X ∩G. In this extension, l-dimensional plane generators of the va-
riety X are complemented by improper elements from the complement PN\G.
Because the variety X has a constant Gauss defect l, its realization 
X in the
space PN is a variety with a degenerate Gauss map of rank r = n−l < n. The
variety 
X bears l-dimensional plane generators L, and each L carries the focus

3.5
Complete Varieties with Degenerate Gauss Maps
127
hypersurface FL of degree r, which is the set of all singularities of L. Thus a
variety X is regular if and only if the real part Re FL of its focus hypersurfaces
is located outside of the proper domain G of the space VN
c .
One of the important problems of multidimensional diﬀerential geometry is
the ﬁnding of complete l-parabolic varieties X without singularities in spaces
VN
c of constant curvature. Theorem 3.2 implies the following result.
Theorem 3.10. Let V m be a complete l-parabolic variety of a simply connected
space VN
c of constant curvature. Let X = f(X) be the image of X in the proper
domain G of the space PN in which the space VN
c is realized, and let 
X be the
natural extension of this image in the space PN. The variety X is regular if
and only if the real parts Re FL of the focus hypersurfaces FL belonging to
generators L of the variety 
X lie outside of the proper domain G ⊂PN.
Let us examine the content of Theorem 3.10 for the diﬀerent kinds of spaces
VN
c of constant curvature.
If c = 0, then VN
c
is the Euclidean space EN, and PN\E∞is the proper
domain of its projective realization. Thus a complete l-parabolic variety X of
the space EN is regular if and only if the real part Re FL of the focus variety FL
of each plane generator L of the corresponding variety 
X ⊂PN coincides with
the intersection L∩E∞and constitutes a ρ-fold (l−1)-plane, where 0 < ρ ≤r.
If c > 0, then VN
c is the elliptic space SN, and its proper domain coincides
with the entire space PN. Thus a complete l-parabolic variety X of the space
SN is regular if and only if the focus hypersurface FL of each plane generator
L of the corresponding variety 
X is pure imaginary. This is possible only if
the Gauss defect δγ = l of the variety X is odd.
If c < 0, then VN
c is the hyperbolic space HN, and the proper domain of its
realization lies inside the absolute of this space. Thus a complete l-parabolic
variety X of the space HN is regular if and only if the real part Re FL of the
focus hypersurface FL of each plane generator L of the corresponding variety

X lies outside of or on the absolute of this space.
Parabolic surfaces of a three-dimensional space V3
c of constant curvature
allow an especially simple description. In P3, with each parabolic surface V 2
there is associated a corresponding torse, each rectilinear generator of which
possesses a focus point. The locus of these focus points constitutes an edge
of regression of the surface V 2. If c = 0, then this edge of regression must
belong to the improper plane E∞, i.e., the edge of regression is a plane curve.
But this is possible if and only if the edge of regression degenerates into a
point. Therefore, a projective realization of a hyperbolic surface V 2 of a three-
dimensional Euclidean space E3 is a cone with its vertex in the improper plane
E∞. Thus the surface V 2 itself is a cylinder. Hence in the space E3 there are
no other regular parabolic surfaces except the cylinders.

128
3. Basic Equations
If c > 0, i.e., if we have the elliptic space S3, then there are no regular
parabolic surfaces, because the edge of regression of the torse V 2 is always
real. Finally, if c < 0, i.e., if we have the hyperbolic space H3, then there are
regular parabolic surfaces, because the real edge of regression of the torse V 2
can be located outside of the absolute.
Thus we have proved the following result.
Theorem 3.11. In the Euclidean space E3, only cylinders are regular parabolic
surfaces. In the space S3, there are no regular parabolic surfaces at all, and
in the space H3, regular parabolic surfaces exist and depend on two arbitrary
functions of one variable.
The last statement follows from the fact that a torse in P3 is completely
deﬁned by its edge of regression, i.e., by an arbitrary space curve, but these
curves are deﬁned in P3 by two arbitrary functions of one variable, as indicated
in the theorem. Of course, the functions of one variable mentioned in Theorem
3.11 are not completely arbitrary: they must satisfy some inequalities guar-
anteeing that the variety Sing X does not belong to the proper domain of the
space H3 located inside of the absolute.
3.5.2 Examples. In order to construct examples of parabolic varieties
without singularities in a simply connected space VN
c of constant curvature c,
we ﬁrst ﬁnd such examples in the real projective space RPN.
In the real projective space RPN, we have already considered in Section 3.4
an example of such varieties—the Sacksteder–Bourgain hypersurfaces in A4.
Note that this kind of variety will be considered again in Section 5.2
Now we construct another example of a three-dimensional variety with a
degenerate Gauss map of rank two in the real space RPN, N ≥4, which does
not have real singular points.
Example 3.12. We consider in RPN, N ≥4, a three-dimensional variety
X = V 3
2 of rank two with imaginary focus hypersurface FL. Equations (2.5),
(3.3), (3.4), and (3.11) deﬁning this variety in RPN take the form

We examine these two cases in turn. In case (a), we specialize the moving
frames in RPN in such a fashion that A4 = B2 and A5 = B3. Then equations

where λ = 6, . . . , N. Therefore the variety X in case (a) is determined by the
system of Pfaﬃan equations (3.71), (3.73), and (3.75).
Next, we investigate the consistency of this system by means of the Cartan
test (see Section 1.2.6). For this purpose we adjoin to Pfaﬃan equations (3.75)
the exterior quadratic equations obtained as the result of exterior diﬀerenti-
ation of these Pfaﬃan equations. Exterior diﬀerentiation of equations (3.71)
leads to identities, by virtue of (3.73), and (3.75). Exterior diﬀerentiation of
equations (3.73) yields

Complete Varieties with Degenerate Gauss Maps

Their number is q = 2N −2. The second character of the system is therefore
s2 = q −s1 = 2, and the Cartan number Q = s1 +2s2 = 2N. The number S of
parameters on which the most general integral element depends is computed
from the formula S = 2q −s1 = 2N. Because Q = S, by the Cartan test, the
system of Pfaﬃan equations (3.71), (3.73), and (3.75) is in involution, and its
general integral manifold depends on two arbitrary functions of two variables.
In case (b), we have bα
2 = b2bα and bα
3 = b3bα.
Equations (3.74) can
therefore be written in the form
ωα
2 = bα(b2ω2
0 + b3ω3
0),
ωα
3 = bα(b3ω2
0 −b2ω3
0).
Consequently,

(mod Tx),
dA3 ≡(b3ω2
0 −b2ω3

(mod Tx),
where B = bαAα. We specialize our moving frame assuming A4 = B. Then
equations (3.74) take the form

the following quadratic equations:
ω4
2 ∧ωλ
4 = 0,
ω4
3 ∧ωλ
4 = 0.
Because by (3.78), 1-forms ω4
2 and ω4
3 are linearly independent, it follows from
the last equations that
ωλ
4 = 0,
λ = 5, . . . , N.
This means that the variety X belongs to the four-dimensional space P4 spanned
by the points A0, A1, A2, A3 and A4. In case (b), the variety X is thus a hyper-
surface in the space P4, being deﬁned in this space by the system of equations
(3.71) (with α = 4), (3.73), and (3.78).
We now investigate the consistency of the last system. For this purpose we
apply exterior diﬀerentiation to equations (3.78). As a result, we obtain the
following quadratic equations:
(∆b2 −2(b2ω2
2 + b3ω3
2)) ∧ω2
0 + ∆b3 ∧ω3
0 = 0,
∆b3 ∧ω2

The system of exterior equations (3.76) and (3.80) consists of s1 = 4 inde-
pendent equations. They contain q = 6 characteristic forms. As a result, the
character s2 = q −s1 = 2, and the Cartan number Q = s1 + 2s2 = 8. The
number S of parameters, on which the most general integral element depends,
is also equal to 8. Because Q = S, by the Cartan test, the system of Pfaﬃan
equations (3.71), (3.73), and (3.78) is in involution, and its general integral
manifold depends on two arbitrary functions of two variables.
Thus, three-dimensional varieties X of rank two in RPN that have no real
singularities exist, in both cases (a) and (b), and a general integral manifold,
deﬁning such varieties, depends on two arbitrary functions of two variables.
Next, we show how one can construct parabolic varieties without singular-
ities in a simply connected space VN
c of constant curvature c.
Example 3.13. Suppose that a simply connected space VN
c of constant cur-
vature c is realized in a projective space RPN, and let G be its proper domain.
If X is a three-dimensional parabolic variety of rank 2 in RPN that has no
real singularities, then the intersection X ∩G is a variety having the same
properties in V N
c . Such varieties consequently also exist in V N
c , and a gen-
eral integral manifold of the system, deﬁning such varieties, depends on two
arbitrary functions of two variables.
Note that in Section 3.3, we constructed another example of a variety with
a degenerate Gauss map without singularities in a real projective space RPN
(see Example 3.7).

able surfaces in a three-dimensional Euclidean space E3.
A generalization of equation (3.82) for a multidimensional space has the form
det (uij) = 0,
i, j = 1, . . . , n,
(3.83)
where uij =
∂2u
∂xi∂xj . In the Euclidean space En+1 (as well as in the aﬃne apace
An+1 and the projective space Pn+1), a function u(x1, . . . , xn) satisfying equation
(3.83) determines a hypersurface X with the equation u = u(x1, . . . , xn) having a
degenerate Gauss map. The rank of X equals the rank of the matrix (uij).
If the matrix (uij) has a constant rank r < n, then the hypersurface X carries
plane generators L of dimension n −r along which the tangent hyperplanes to X are
constant. These plane generators L compose the Monge–Amp`ere foliation.
In this book we consider the Monge–Amp`ere foliations not only on hypersurfaces
but also on varieties of codimension higher than one.
See more on connections between the Monge–Amp`ere equations and the geometry
of manifolds in the papers [De 89] by Delano¨e and [Mo 79] by Morimoto.
Ishikawa and Morimoto found the connection between varieties with degenerate
Gauss maps and solutions of Monge–Amp`ere equations.
In [IM 01], the authors
proved that the rank r of a compact C∞-hypersurface X ⊂RPN with a degenerate
Gauss map is an even integer r satisfying the inequality
r(r+3)
2
> N, r ̸= 0.
In
particular, if r < 2, then X is necessarily a projective hyperplane of RPN, and if
N = 3 or N = 5, then a compact C∞-hypersurface with a degenerate Gauss map is
a projective hyperplane.
In our exposition of basic equations we follow the recently published paper by
Akivis and Goldberg [AG 01a].
Theorem 3.1 is fundamental in the theory of varieties with degenerate Gauss
maps.
In some investigations, the authors take this property as the deﬁnition of
such varieties—see, for example, the Akivis paper [A 57]. However, such varieties are
usually deﬁned in terms of reduced rank of the Gauss map. Then this property is
proved—see, for example, Theorem 2.10 in the Griﬃths and Harris paper [GH 79];
Theorem 4.1 in the book [AG 93] by Akivis and Goldberg (see also Theorem 1 in
their recently published paper [AG 01a]); Landsberg’s book [L 99] (§5); and the
Linearity Theorem in Section 2.3 of the recently published book [FP 01] by Fischer
and Piontkowski.
The proof of this theorem in the paper [HN 59] by Hartman and Nirenberg is
based on the lemma on the constancy of a certain unique (n −1)-plane. This lemma
was proved in the paper [CL 57] by Chern and Lashof. Sternberg [Ste 64] called this
lemma the lemma of Chern–Lashof–Hartman–Nirenberg. A projective analogue of
this lemma is our Theorem 3.1 (see also Theorem 4.1 in the book [AG 93] by Akivis
and Goldberg and Theorem 1 in their paper [AG 01a]).
Theorem 3.2 proved at the end of Section 3.1 generalizes for varieties with degen-
erate Gauss maps Theorem 3.5 of the paper [GH 79] proved by Griﬃths and Harris
for tangentially nondegenerate varieties.
In Section 3.1 we assume that every plane generator L of a variety X with a
degenerate Gauss map has at least one regular point. Otherwise, the Monge–Amp`ere

134

foliation is degenerate, and we will not consider this case in the book.
3.2. Most of the results of this section are due to Akivis (see [A 57, 62]).
Note that a rather rough classiﬁcation of two-dimensional and three-dimensional
varieties with degenerate Gauss maps is given in the paper [GH 79] by Griﬃths and
Harris. On a classiﬁcation of three-dimensional varieties with degenerate Gauss maps
see the papers [Rog 97] by Rogora and [MT 02a] by Mezzetti and Tommasi.
Mezzetti and Tommasi [MT 02b] constructed an example of an irreducible two-
dimensional algebraic variety (F) in the space P4 that generates a hypersurface X
with a degenerate Gauss map of rank two.
From the diﬀerential geometry point
of view, the surface (F) in their example is separated into two parts (two separate
surfaces) (F1) and (F2) by a curve Γ (see Figure 2.5). The hypersurface X is formed
by the straight lines joining the points of (F1) and (F2) connected by the Laplace
transform. On the curve Γ the Laplace transform is undetermined. In our opinion,
the hypersurface X has two focal surfaces. But both focal surfaces are described by
the same algebraic equation. Hence, while from the algebraic geometry point of view,
the example constructed in [MT 02b] belongs to class b) indicated in the text, from
the diﬀerential geometry point of view, this example belongs to class a).
3.3. Example 3.6 is new. The hypercubic in Example 3.7 is from the recent
paper [WZ 02] by Wu and F. Zheng.
3.4. Sacksteder’s hypersurface was considered by Sacksteder in [S 60]. It was
the ﬁrst example of a hypersurface with degenerate Gauss map of rank two without
singularities in a Euclidean space E4. In 1995, Wu [Wu 95] published an example of
a noncylindrical tangentially degenerate algebraic hypersurface in a Euclidean space
E4 that has a degenerate Gauss map but does not have singularities. This example
was constructed (but not published) by Bourgain (see also the papers [I 98, 99a, 99b]
of Ishikawa). Theorem 3.9 was proved in the paper [AG 02a] by Akivis and Goldberg.
Note that Mori in his paper [M 94] claimed that he constructed an example of
a noncylindrical hypersurface with degenerate Gauss map without singularities in
a Euclidean space E4 (see also Ishikawa’s papers [I 98, 99b] in which this result
was mentioned). However, the authors of this book proved that the hypersurface in
Mori’s example is cylindrical. This was communicated to Mori, who recognized that
his claim was wrong.
3.5.
As we remarked in the Notes to Section 2.3, the notion of the index of
relative nullity was introduced by Chern and Kuiper in [CK 52] (see also Kobayashi
and Nomizu [KN 63], vol. 2, p. 348). This number is also called the Gauss defect of
the system of second fundamental forms Φα of the variety X (see, for example, the
book [FP 01], p. 89, by Fischer and Piontkowski).
Complete parabolic varieties in a Euclidean space En were studied by Borisenko
in [Bor 82, 85]. In [Bor 92], he used the notion of parabolicity to formulate and prove
a theorem on the unique determination of V m ⊂En from its Grassmann image.
Akivis [A 87a] recognized that the problem of ﬁnding singularities on complete
parabolic varieties in a Riemannian space V n
c of constant curvature and distinguishing
those varieties that have no singularities is related not so much to the metric as to the
projective structure of the spaces V n
c . In this section we follow Akivis’s paper [A 87a].

Chapter 4
Main Structure Theorems
In this chapter, in the projective space PN, we consider the basic types of varieties with
degenerate Gauss maps: torsal varieties, hypersurfaces, and cones. For each of these types
of varieties, we consider the structure of their focal images and ﬁnd suﬃcient conditions for
a variety with a degenerate Gauss map to belong to one of these types (for torsal varieties
our condition is also necessary).
In Theorems 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.15, and 4.16, we establish
connections between the types and the structure of focal images of varieties with degenerate
Gauss maps of rank r. In Section 4.3, we consider varieties with degenerate Gauss maps in the
aﬃne space AN and ﬁnd a new aﬃne analogue of the Hartman–Nirenberg cylinder theorem.
In Section 4.4, we deﬁne and study new types of varieties with degenerate Gauss maps:
varieties with multiple foci and their particular case, the so-called twisted cones. We also
prove here existence theorems for some varieties with degenerate Gauss maps, for example,
for twisted cones in P4 and A4 (Theorems 4.12 and 4.14) and establish a structure of twisted
cones in P4 (Theorems 4.13). This structure allows us to ﬁnd a procedure for construction
of twisted cylinders in A4. In Section 4.5, we prove that varieties with degenerate Gauss
maps that do not belong to one of the basic types considered in Sections 4.1–4.2 are foliated
into varieties of basic types (Theorem 4.16). A classiﬁcation of varieties X with degenerate
Gauss maps presented in this chapter is based on the structure of the focal images FL and
ΦL of X. In Section 4.6, we prove an embedding theorem for varieties with degenerate Gauss
maps and ﬁnd suﬃcient conditions for such a variety to be a cone (Theorems 4.18 and 4.19
in Section 4.6).
4.1
Torsal Varieties
As we saw earlier, in the projective space PN, there exist several types of
varieties X of dimension n < N with degenerate Gauss maps of rank r < n:
torsal varieties (see Example 2.5), hypersurfaces with degenerate Gauss maps
(see Example 2.7), cones (see Example 2.4), and twisted cones (see Section
3.4).
In this chapter, we establish a connection between the structure of focal
images of a variety with a degenerate Gauss map and the structure of the

variety itself.
First, we prove two lemmas.
Lemma 4.1. Suppose that l ≥1, and the focus hypersurface FL ⊂L does not
have multiple components. Then all matrices Bα can be simultaneously diag-
onalized, Bα = diag (bα
pp),1 and the focus hypercone ΦL decomposes into r bun-
dles of hyperplanes Φp
in PN
whose centers are the (n + 1)-planes
TL ∧Bp, where Bp = bα
ppAα are points located outside of the tangent sub-
space TL. The dimension n + m of the osculating subspace T 2
L of the variety
X along a generator L does not exceed n + r.
Proof. Because the hypersurface FL ⊂L does not have multiple components,
a general straight line λ lying in L intersects FL at r distinct points. We place
the vertices A0 and A1 of our moving frame onto the line λ. By (3.21), the
coordinates of the common points of λ and FL are deﬁned by the equation
det(δq
px0 + cq
1px1) = 0.
Because the straight line λ intersects the hypersurface FL at r distinct points,
the preceding equation has r distinct roots. This implies that the matrix C1
can be diagonalized, C1 = diag (cp
1p) (no summation over p), and cp
1p ̸= cq
1q
for p ̸= q.
Next we write equations (3.9) for a = 1:
bα
qpcp
1p = bα
pqcq
1q.
Because cp
1p ̸= cq
1q and bα
pq = bα
qp , it follows that bα
pq = 0 for p ̸= q. As a
result, all matrices Bα can be simultaneously diagonalized, Bα = diag (bα
pp).
Equation (3.24) takes the form

p
(ξαbα
pp) = 0,
and the focus hypercone ΦL decomposes into r bundles of hyperplanes Φp in
PN whose axes are the (n + 1)-planes TL ∧Bp, where Bp = bα
ppAα are points
located outside of the tangent subspace TL. The osculating subspace T 2
L of
the variety X along a generator L is the span of the tangent subspace TL and
the points Bl+1, . . . , Bn. Thus, the dimension of this subspace does not exceed
n + r.
1Here and in what follows, we use a shorter notation for diagonal matrices: diag (bα
pp)
instead of diag (bα
l+1,l+1, . . . , bα
nn) and diag (cp
ap) instead of diag (cl+1
a,l+1, . . . , cn
an).

4.1
Torsal Varieties
137
Lemma 4.2. Suppose that m ≥2 and the focus hypercones ΦL of a variety X
do not have multiple components. Then all matrices Ca can be simultaneously
diagonalized, Ca = diag (cp
ap), and the focus hypersurfaces FL decompose into r
plane components deﬁned in L by the equations x0 +cp
apxa = 0 (no summation
over p). The dimension k = l−m∗of the characteristic subspace KL is greater
than or equal to l−r, where m∗is the number of linearly independent matrices
Ca.
Proof. Let ξn+1 and ξn+2 be two hyperplanes in general position that are
tangent to a variety X along its generator L.
They determine a pencil of
tangent hyperplanes ξ = ξn+1 + λξn+2.
By (3.24), the intersection of this
pencil with the focus hypercone ΦL is deﬁned by the equation
det (bn+1
pq
+ λbn+2
pq ) = 0;
(4.1)
this equation is the λ-equation of the matrices Bn+1 and Bn+2 (see B¨ocher
[B¨o 07], Chapter XIII, no. 57). Because the focus hypercone ΦL does not have
multiple components and the pencil ξ is in general position with respect to this
hypercone, equation (4.1) has r distinct roots. This implies that the matrices
(bn+1
pq ) and (bn+2
pq ) can be simultaneously diagonalized (see, for example, B¨ocher
[B¨o 07], Chapter XIII, no. 58, Theorem 2),
Bn+1 = diag(bn+1
pp ), Bn+2 = diag(bn+2
pp )
and
bn+1
pp
bn+1
qq
̸= bn+2
pp

for p ̸= q.
(4.2)
Consider further equations (3.9) for α = n + 1, n + 2. These equations and
inequalities (4.2) imply that
cp
aq = 0 for p ̸= q,
i.e., all matrices Ca are simultaneously diagonalized,
Ca = diag (cp
ap) (no summation over p).
As a result, equation (3.21) of the focus hypersurface FL becomes
n

p=l+1
(x0 + cp
apxa) = 0.
(4.3)
Thus, the hypersurface FL decomposes into r plane components Fp deﬁned in
L by the equation
x0 + cp
apxa = 0 (no summation over p).
(4.4)

138
4. Main Structure Theorems
The characteristic subspace KL (see Section 3.2.3) is the intersection of
these plane components, and its dimension is k = l −m∗, where m∗is the
number of linearly independent equations (4.4). Because m∗≤r, we have
k ≥l −r.
We recall that a variety X with a degenerate Gauss map of rank r is torsal
if it foliates into r families of simple (i.e., not multiple) torses.
Theorem 4.3. A variety X with a degenerate Gauss map of rank r > 1 is
torsal if and only if all its focus hypersurfaces FL decompose into r simple
(l −1)-planes Fp, p = l + 1, . . . , n, belonging to its plane generators L, and
all its focus hypercones ΦL decompose into r simple bundles Φp of hyperplanes
with (n + 1)-dimensional vertices that contain the tangent subspaces TL of the
variety X.
Proof. Necessity: Suppose that a variety X is torsal of rank r > 1. Let τ1 be
one of the families of torses into which X foliates. This family is deﬁned on X
by the system of equations
ωl+2 = . . . = ωn = 0,
(4.5)
and the form ωl+1 is a basis form on torses of this family. A plane generator L
of X is deﬁned by the points A0, A1, . . . , Al of a moving frame associated with
X. By (3.5 ), (3.11), and (4.5), on τ1, the diﬀerentials of these points have the
form

dA0 = ω0
0A0 + ωaAa + ωl+1Al+1,
dAa = ω0
aA0 + ωb
aAb + cp
a,l+1ωl+1Ap.
However, because on a torse, dim(L+dL) = l+1 (see Example 2.4), the tangent
subspaces to a torse must be determined by the points A0, A1, . . . , Al, Al+1.
As a result, we have cp
a,l+1 = 0 for p = l + 2, . . . , n.
Because by the theorem hypotheses, the variety X is torsal, i.e, it foliates
into r families τp of torses, in a similar manner, we prove that in the matrices
Ca = (cp
aq), all nondiagonal entries vanish. Thus, all these matrices can be
simultaneously diagonalized:
Ca = diag (cp
ap).
(4.6)
By means of (4.6), equation (3.21) determining a focus hypersurface FL in a
plane generator L takes the form

p
(x0 + cp
apxa) = 0.

4.1
Torsal Varieties
139
This proves that FL decomposes into r hyperplanes deﬁned in L by the equa-
tions
x0 + cp
apxa = 0.
(4.7)
These hyperplanes are tangent to the torses τp into which the variety X foliates.
Because all these torses are simple, equations (4.7) for diﬀerent values of p are
not proportional. As a result, the rows of the matrix

By (4.6), conditions (3.9) take the form

Because the matrices Bα = (bα
pq) are symmetric, it follows that
bα

(4.9)
Because the rows of the matrix C in (4.8) are not proportional, for any pair of

As a result, equation (4.9) implies that

Thus the matrices Bα are also simultaneously diagonalized:
Bα = diag (bα

(4.10)
It follows from (4.10) that equation (3.24) of the focus hypercone ΦL takes the
form

and this hypercone decomposes into r bundles of hyperplanes deﬁned by the
equations

4. Main Structure Theorems
The centers of these bundles are the (n+1)-planes TL ∧Bp, where Bp = bα
ppAα
are points not belonging to the subspace TL. It is not diﬃcult to prove that
these (n + 1)-planes are tangent to the torses τp described by the subspace TL
when it moves along the torses τp ⊂X. Because the torses τp are simple, the
torses τp are also simple. Thus all the points Bp are distinct, and as a result,
the columns of matrix (4.10) composed from eigenvalues of the matrix Bα are
not proportional.
Suﬃciency. Suppose that all focus hypersurfaces FL of a variety X decom-
pose into r simple hyperplanes Fp ⊂L, and all its hypercones ΦL decompose
into r simple bundles Φp with the centers TL ∧Bp, where Bp /∈TL. Then by
Lemmas 4.1 and 4.2, all matrices Ca and Bα can be simultaneously diagonal-
ized,
Ca = diag (cp
ap), Bα = diag (bα
pp).
This implies that equations (3.11) and (3.4) take the form
ωp
a = cp

p = bα
ppωp,
(4.11)
where there is no summation over the index p.
Consider l-planes L deﬁned by the points A0, A1, . . . , Al of the moving

(4.12)
It follows that for
ωq = 0,
q ̸= p,
(4.13)
there is no summation over p on the right-hand side of equations (4.12). Thus,
the tangent subspace to the one-parameter family of rectilinear generators L
deﬁned on X by equations (4.13) is the plane L ∧Ap of dimension l + 1.
Therefore, this family of planes is a torse τp.
Thus, we have proved that the variety X foliates into r families of torses
deﬁned on X by the systems of equations (4.13). These families of torses are
mutually simple because the (l + 1)-planes L ∧Ap tangent to torses of these
families passing through their common rectilinear generator L are simple.
It is not diﬃcult to prove that the families of the tangent subspaces TL
deﬁned on X by the system of equations (4.13) also form torses τp of dimension
n + 1.
An example of a torsal variety was considered in Section 2.4 (see Example
2.7); for n = 3, r = 2, this is a hypersurface X = V 3
2 ⊂P4 (see Figure 2.5).

Hypersurfaces with Degenerate Gauss Maps
4.2.1 Suﬃcient Condition for a Variety with a Degenerate Gauss
Map to be a Hypersurface in a Subspace of PN. First we consider the
structure of the focal images of hypersurfaces with degenerate Gauss maps.
Theorem 4.4. If a variety X with a degenerate Gauss map of dimension n and
rank r is a hypersurface in a subspace Pn+1 ⊂PN, then all its focus hypercones
ΦL are r-fold bundles of hyperplanes of the space PN with the center Pn+1.
Proof. Suppose that X ⊂Pn+1 ⊂PN, and the subspace Pn+1 is deﬁned by
the tangent subspace TL of X and a point B = bαAα, α = n + 1, . . . , N,
i.e., Pn+1 = TL ∧B. Then the variety X has only one independent second
fundamental form
Φ = bpqωpωq,
p, q = l + 1, . . . , n,
where det (bpq) ̸= 0.
But, with respect to an arbitrary tangent hyperplane ξαxα = 0 of the
variety X, its second fundamental form can be written in the form
Φ = ξαbα
pqωpωq
(see (2.21)), where bα
pq is the second fundamental tensor of the variety X. Thus,
Φ(ξ) = λ(ξ)Φ.
It follows that
ξαbα
pq = λ(ξ)bpq.
This implies that λ(ξ) = ξαbα and
bα
pq = bαbpq.
As a result, equation (3.24) of the focus hypercones ΦL of X takes the form
(ξαbα)r · det (bpq) = 0.
Hence the focus hypercones ΦL is an r-fold bundle of hyperplanes
bαξα = 0,
passing through the subspace Pn+1 = TL ∧B, where B = bαAα.
The next theorem gives a suﬃcient condition for a variety X ⊂PN with a
degenerate Gauss map to be a hypersurface in a subspace Pn+1 ⊂PN.

142
4. Main Structure Theorems
Theorem 4.5. Suppose that a variety X with a degenerate Gauss map of rank
r ≥2 and dimension n satisﬁes the conditions:
(i) On X, the conditions of Lemma 4.1 are satisﬁed, i.e., l ≥1 and all focus
hypersurfaces FL ⊂L do not have multiple components.
(ii) All focus hypercones ΦL are r-fold bundles of hyperplanes with (n + 1)-
dimensional centers P n+1
L
containing the tangent subspace TL.
Then the variety X is a hypersurface in a subspace Pn+1 ⊂PN.
Proof. By Lemma 4.1 and condition (i) of the theorem, all matrices Bα = (bα
pq)
of the variety X can be simultaneously diagonalized,
Bα = diag (bα
pp),
and the focus hypercones ΦL deﬁned by equation (3.24) decompose into bun-
dles of hyperplanes whose axes are the subspaces TL ∧Bp, where Bp = bα
ppAα.
But from condition (ii) it follows that the axes of these bundles coincide,
and this implies that the eigenvalues bα
pp of the tensors bα
pq are proportional.
As a result, the tensors bα
pq themselves are proportional. The last condition
can be expressed by the formula
bα
pq = bαbpq,
(4.14)
where det (bpq) ̸= 0, because the rank of the system of tensors bα
pq is equal to
r and p, q = l + 1, . . . , n, i.e., the indices p and q take r values.
Because condition (4.14) means that the varietyX has only one independent
second fundamental form
Φ = bpqωpωq
and r ≥2, then the Segre theorem (see Theorem 2.1 in Section 2.2.5) implies
that the variety X is a hypersurface in a subspace Pn+1 ⊂PN.
The last result can be proved directly. In fact, it follows from (4.14) that
ωα
p = bαbpqωq.
(4.15)
Taking exterior derivatives of equations (4.15), we obtain the following exterior
quadratic equations:
(bpq∇bα + bα∇bpq) ∧ωq = 0,
(4.16)
where
∇bα = dbα + bβωα

∇bpq = dbpq −bsqωs

The 1-forms ωq, q = l+1, . . . , n, are basis forms on the variety X. However,
they might not compose a complete basis of all 1-forms deﬁned on this variety.
We supplement the forms ωq by 1-forms ωu in such a way that the forms ωq
and ωu compose a basis of the system of 1-forms occurring in equation (4.16).
Then the decompositions of the forms ∇bα and ∇bpq occurring in (4.16) can
be written as

∇bα = bα
p ωp + tα
uωu,
∇bpq = bpqsωs + tpquωu.
(4.17)
If we substitute (4.17) into (4.16) and equal to 0 the coeﬃcients in the
product of the independent forms ωs and ωu, we ﬁnd that
bpqbα
s −bpsbα
q + bα(bpqs −bpsq) = 0
(4.18)
and
bpqtα
u + bαtpqu = 0.
(4.19)
It follows from (4.19) that
tα
u = tubα, tpqu = −tubpq,
(4.20)
where tu are parameters. Note that equations (4.20) imply equations (4.19).
Contracting equations (4.18) with the tensor bpq, which is the inverse tensor
of bpq, we ﬁnd that
(r −1)bα
s + bα(bpqs −bpsq)bpq = 0.
Because by theorem hypotheses r ≥2, it follows that
bα
s = bαbs,
(4.21)
where
bs =
1
r −1(bpqs −bpsq)bpq.
As a result, the ﬁrst equation of system (4.17) takes the form
∇bα = bαbsωs.
(4.22)
Next, we consider the subspace Pn+1 = TL ∧B, where B = bαAα. Diﬀer-
entiating the points Ap ∈TL and applying formulas (3.5) and (4.14), we ﬁnd
that
dAp ≡bpqωqB
(mod TL).
(4.23)

144
4. Main Structure Theorems
Diﬀerentiating point B and applying formulas (4.22), we obtain
dB ≡bqωqB
(mod TL).
(4.24)
Equations (4.23) and (4.24) mean that the subspace Pn+1 = TL ∧B is ﬁxed
when we move along a generator L ⊂X. Thus, P n+1
L
= Pn+1 ⊂PN, and
therefore, X is a hypersurface in Pn+1 ⊂PN.
4.2.2 Focal Images of a Hypersurface with a Degenerate Gauss
Map. Let us study the focal images of a hypersurface with a degenerate Gauss
map of rank r in the space Pn+1. On such a hypersurface, formulas (3.4) and
(3.11) become
ωn+1
p
= bpqωq, ωp
a = cp
aqωq,
(4.25)
where bpq = bqp and det (bpq) ̸= 0. Conditions (3.9) now take the form
bpscs
aq = bqscs
ap.
By (4.25), equation (3.24) of the focus hypercone ΦL takes the form
det (bpqξn+1) = 0.
It follows that ξn+1 = 0, and the last equation deﬁnes the tangent subspace
TL of X. Thus, the focus hypercone ΦL is reduced to its vertex TL.
As in the general case (cf. (3.21)), the equation of the focus hypersurface
FL ⊂L has the form
det (δp
qx0 + cp
aqxq) = 0,
and FL is an algebraic hypersurface of degree r in a generator L. For l ≥2, in
the general case this hypersurface is indecomposable. For example, as we saw
earlier, for the cubic symmetroid considered in Section 2.5.2, this hypersurface
is a nondegenerate conic belonging to the two-dimensional generator L.
If all focus hypersurfaces FL of a hypersurface X decompose into hyper-
surfaces F ′
L and F ′′
L of orders r′ and r′′ (r′ ≥2, r′′ ≥2, and r′ + r′′ = r),
then the hypersurface X decomposes into two families of varieties X′ and X′′
of dimension n′ = l + r′ and n′′ = l + r′′, respectively, and by Theorem 4.5,
each of these varieties is a hypersurface in a subspace of dimension n′ + 1 and
n′′ + 1, respectively.
If all focus hypersurfaces FL of a hypersurface X ⊂Pn+1 decompose into
r simple planes of dimension l −1, then by Theorem 4.3, the hypersurface X
is torsal, i.e., X foliates into r families of simple torses.
In Chapter 5, we will study in more detail the case when n-dimensional
varieties with degenerate Gauss maps foliate into similar varieties of smaller
dimensions.

Hypersurfaces with Degenerate Gauss Maps

4.2.3 Examples of Hypersurfaces with Degenerate Gauss Maps.
As we noted in Section 2.5.1, a variety dual to a tangentially nondegenerate
variety of dimension r in a projective space PN is a tangentially degenerate
hypersurface of rank r and dimension n = N −1.
Another example of a hypersurface with a degenerate Gauss map is the cu-
bic symmetroid considered in Section 2.5.2,
where N
=
5, n
=
4,
r = 2, l = 2.
Now we give a new example of a hypersurface with a degenerate Gauss
map. This example generalizes the cubic symmetroid.
Example 4.6. Consider a hyperquadric Q in the space Pn deﬁned by the
equation
auvxuxv = 0, auv = avu,
u, v = 0, 1, . . . , n.
(4.26)
For each hyperquadric Q, there is a corresponding point in the space PN, where
N = 1
2(n + 1)(n + 2) −1. The coordinates of this point are the coeﬃcients
auv of equation (4.26). The degenerate hyperquadrics—the hypercones—are
deﬁned by the condition
det (auv) = 0,
(4.27)
which determines a hypersurface V N−1 ⊂PN. Because the degree of degener-
acy of a hyperquadric can vary, in the space PN we can consider the sequence
of varieties deﬁned by the equations
rank (auv) = ρ,
(4.28)
where 2 ≤ρ < n. Each term of this sequence deﬁnes a variety of hypercones
with (n−ρ+1)-dimensional plane generators and an (n−ρ)-dimensional vertex
in PN.
If ρ = 1, the variety (4.28) is a Veronese variety (see Section 1.5.2). In this
case
auv = auav, u, v = 0, 1, . . . , n
(4.29)
(cf. (1.171)), and the hyperquadric (4.26) deﬁned by the tensor auv becomes
a double hyperplane auxu = 0.
Let us study the structure of the determinant variety (4.28) in the general
case ρ = n −1. Such a variety is a hypersurface V N−1 in PN. To the points
of V N−1, there correspond the hypercones Q0 with 0-dimensional vertex (a
point) in PN.
We consider a family of moving frames {Auv} in PN, such that Auv = αuαv,
where αu is a basis hyperplane of the space (Pn)∗. Because the equations of
inﬁnitesimal displacement of a tangential moving frame in the space (Pn)∗have
the form (1.79),
dαu = −ωu
v αv,
(4.30)

146
4. Main Structure Theorems
for the moving frames in the space PN we get
dAuv = −ωu
wAwv −ωv
wAuw.
(4.31)
Consider a family of hypercones Q with the common vertex A0 in the space
Pn. The equation of this family has the form
aijxixj = 0, i, j = 1, . . . , n.
(4.32)
In the space PN, to this family of hypercones, there corresponds the sub-
space deﬁned by the equations a00 = 0, a0i = 0. This subspace is a plane
generator L of the hypersurface V N−1. The dimension l of this generator is
equal to l = n(n+1)
2
−1 = n2+n−2
2
, and the set of all these generators depends
on n parameters. So, the rank r of the hypercones Q is r = rank Q = n.
In the space PN, the points Aij of our moving frame lie on a generator L of
the hypersurface V N−1. Applying formulas (4.31), we calculate the diﬀerentials
of the points Aij:
dAij = −ωi
kAkj −ωj
kAki −ωi
0A0j −ωj
0A0i.
(4.33)
Let x = xijAij be a point of the generator L. Then
dx = (dxij −xikωk
j −xkjωk
i )Aij −2xijωi
0A0j.
(4.34)
This equation shows that at all points of the generator L for which
det(xij) ̸= 0,
(4.35)
the tangent subspace Tx to the hypersurface V N−1 is determined by the points
Aij and A0j. Hence this subspace is of dimension N −1 and is constant for
all points x ∈L for which inequality (4.35) holds.
Therefore, V N−1 is a
hypersurface with a degenerate Gauss map of rank n.
At the points of the generator L0 for which
det(xij) = 0,
(4.36)
the dimension of the tangent subspace Tx(V N−1) is reduced. Thus these points
are foci of the generator, and singular points of the hypersurface V N−1.

4.3.1 Structure of Focus Hypersurfaces of Cones. As we saw earlier, in
the space PN, cones with (l −1)-dimensional vertices and with l-dimensional

147
plane generators have degenerate Gauss maps (see Example 2.4 in Section
2.4). We now prove the following theorem describing the structure of focus
hypersurfaces of such cones.
Theorem 4.7. If a variety X with a degenerate Gauss map of dimension
n and rank r ≥1 is a cone with vertex of dimension l −1, then all its focus
hypersurfaces FL are r-fold (l−1)-dimensional planes belonging to its generator
L.
Proof. Suppose that X is a cone with an (l −1)-dimensional vertex S, where
l = n−r, and l-dimensional plane generators L. We associate with X a family
of moving frames such that the points A1, . . . , Al ∈S and A0 ∈L. Because
the vertex of the cone X is ﬁxed, then on X, equations (3.5) take the form
dA0 = ω0
0A0+ ωa
0Aa + ωpAp,
dAa =
ωb
aAb,
where a, b = 1, . . . , l; p = l + 1, . . . , n. It follows that ωp
a = 0, and all matri-
ces Ca are zero matrices, cp
aq = 0. As a result, equation (3.21) of the focus
hypersurface FL ⊂L becomes
det (x0δp
q) = 0,
i.e., (x0)r = 0, and the focus hypersurface FL is an r-fold hyperplane x0 = 0,
which coincides with the vertex S of the cone X.
The next theorem gives a suﬃcient condition for a variety X ⊂PN with a
degenerate Gauss map to be a cone.
Theorem 4.8. Suppose that X is a variety with a degenerate Gauss map of
dimension n and rank r ≥2 in the projective space PN, and X satisﬁes the
following conditions:
(i) All focus hypersurfaces FL are r-fold hyperplanes belonging to its plane
generators L.
(ii) On X, the conditions of Lemma 4.2 are satisﬁed, i.e., m ≥2, and all
focus hypercones ΦL do not have multiple components.
Then the variety X is a cone with an (l −1)-dimensional vertex and l-dimen-
sional plane generators.

148
4. Main Structure Theorems
Proof. By Lemma 4.2, all matrices Ca = (cp
aq) of the variety X can be si-
multaneously diagonalized, Ca = diag (cp
ap), and its focus hypersurfaces FL
decompose into r hyperplanes deﬁned by the equations
x0 + cp
apxa = 0.
But by condition (i) of the theorem, all these hyperplanes belonging to a
generator L coincide. This implies that
cp
ap = cq
aq := ca.
Thus, the entries of all matrices Ca = (cp
aq) take the form
cp
aq = caδp
q.
The equations of the r-fold focus hyperplanes of the variety X can be written
in the form
x0 + caxa = 0.
If we locate the points Aa of our moving frame of X in this hyperplane, then
we obtain ca = 0, and as a result, we have
cp
aq = 0,
a = 1, . . . , l,
for all p, q = l + 1, . . . , n. Therefore, by (3.11), we obtain
ωp
a = 0.
(4.37)
Taking exterior derivatives of equation (4.37), we arrive at the exterior
quadratic equation
ω0
a ∧ωp
0 = 0.
But because r ≥2, and the forms ωp
0 are linearly independent, it follows from
the above quadratic equations that
ω0
a = 0.
(4.38)
Now from equations (3.5) and (4.38) it follows that
dAa = ωb
aAb,
and the (l −1)-plane S = A1 ∧A2 ∧. . . ∧Al is ﬁxed. Thus, the variety X is
an n-dimensional cone with the vertex S and l-dimensional plane generators
L = A0 ∧A1 ∧. . . ∧Al.

Aﬃne Analogue of the Hartman–Nirenberg Cylinder Theorem

4.3.2
Aﬃne
Analogue
of
the
Hartman–Nirenberg
Cylinder
Theorem. The Hartman–Nirenberg cylinder theorem in an (n+1)-dimensional
Euclidean space En+1 was ﬁrst proved by Hartman and Nirenberg in their joint
paper [HN 59]. This theorem states the following.
Theorem 4.9 (The Hartman–Nirenberg Cylinder Theorem). Let
X ⊂En+1 be a connected, complete, C2, orientable hypersurface in an (n+1)-
dimensional space En+1.
If X is of constant zero curvature, then it is an
(n−1)-cylinder (i.e., an n-dimensional cylinder with (n−1)-dimensional gen-
erators erected over a curve) in the sense that X has a parameterization (in
the large) of the form
v = v(x) =
n−1

i=1
aixi + b(xn) for all x = (x1, . . . , xn),
(4.39)
where a1, . . . , an−1 are constant vectors in En+1; b(xn) is a vector-valued func-
tion of a variable xn of class C2 in En+1; and a1, . . . , an−1, ∂b/∂xn is a set
of orthonormal vectors.
In the proof of this theorem, Hartman and Nirenberg ﬁrst proved that the
vanishing of the Gaussian curvature implies that the rank r(x) of the Gauss
map of X does not exceed one, r(x) ≤1. If r(x) = 0, then X is a hyperplane.
In the case r(x) = 1, X is an (n −1)-cylinder that can be parameterized as
indicated in equation (4.39).
The proof of this theorem in the paper [HN 59] by Hartman and Nirenberg
is based on the lemma on the constancy of a certain unique (n −1)-plane.
This lemma was proved in the paper [CL 57] by Chern and Lashof. Sternberg
[Ste 64] called this lemma the lemma of Chern–Lashof–Hartman–Nirenberg. A
projective analogue of this lemma is our Theorem 3.1 (see also Theorem 1 in
the paper [A 87a] by Akivis, Theorem 4.1 in the book [AG 93] by Akivis and
Goldberg, and Theorem 1 in their paper [AG 01a]).
Note that in [HN 59] and [Ste 64], the authors obtain an (n −1)-cylinder,
i.e., a cylinder in En+1 with (n −1)-dimensional plane generators erected over
a curve. The reason they did not get an (n−r)-cylinder, i.e., an n-dimensional
cylinder in En+1 with (n −r)-dimensional plane generators erected over an
r-dimensional manifold, where r = 1, . . . , n −1, is that the vanishing of the
Gaussian curvature implies that the rank r(x) of the Gauss map of X does not
exceed one.
The Hartman–Nirenberg cylinder theorem is of aﬃne nature. In fact, the
notion of a cylinder appearing in the theorem conclusion is an aﬃne notion.
As to the theorem hypotheses, although the notion of the Gaussian curvature
is not aﬃne, the notion of the rank of the Gauss map, which is fundamental

150
4. Main Structure Theorems
in the proof of this theorem and whose boundedness, r(x) ≤1, is implied by
the vanishing of the Gaussian curvature, is even of projective nature. This is
why it is interesting to consider an aﬃne analogue of the Hartman–Nirenberg
cylinder theorem.
We recall that in an aﬃne space AN, an l-cylinder X over the ﬁeld of
complex or real numbers is deﬁned as a smooth n-dimensional submanifold
bearing l-dimensional plane generators, l < n, which are parallel to each other.
An l-cylinder is a variety with a degenerate Gauss map of rank r = n−l. In an
aﬃne space AN, N > n, an l-cylinder can be deﬁned by a parametric equation
v = v(x) =
l

i=1
aixi + b(xl+1, . . . , xn) for all x = (x1, . . . , xn),
(4.40)
where ai are constant vectors in AN, b(xl+1, . . . , xn) is a vector-valued function
of r = n −l variables deﬁning in AN a director manifold Y of the cylinder X,
and the vectors ai and bp =
∂b
∂xp are linearly independent.
In this section we prove the following aﬃne analogue of the Hartman–
Nirenberg cylinder theorem.
Theorem 4.10 (An Aﬃne Analogue of the Hartman–Nirenberg Cylin-
der Theorem). Let Xn be a smooth, projectively complete, connected variety
with a degenerate Gauss map of constant rank r, 2 ≤r ≤n −1, without sin-
gularities in a real or complex aﬃne space AN, N −n ≥2. Suppose that in
the pencil of the second fundamental forms of X, there are two forms deﬁn-
ing a regular pencil, all eigenvalues of which are distinct. Then the variety
X is a cylinder with l-dimensional plane generators, l = n −r ≥2, and an
r-dimensional tangentially nondegenerate director variety Y . In AN such a
cylinder can be deﬁned by parametric equation (4.40).
Proof. We enlarge the space AN to a projective space PN by attaching a hy-
perplane at inﬁnity PN−1
∞
. So we have
PN = AN ∪PN−1
∞
.
Consider the submanifold X described in the theorem in the space PN. This
submanifold X ⊂PN satisﬁes all conditions of Theorem 4.8 Thus, X is a
cone with an (l −1)-dimensional vertex in PN. But because X is projectively
complete in the space AN, all its singular points are located at a hyperplane
at inﬁnity PN−1
∞
. Thus, X is a cylinder in AN.

Varieties with Degenerate Gauss Maps with
Multiple Foci and Twisted Cones
4.4.1 Basic Equations of a Hypersurface of Rank r with r-Multiple
Focus Hyperplanes. In Section 4.3, in a projective space PN, we considered
varieties X with degenerate Gauss maps of dimension n and rank r with the
following two properties:
(i) Their focus hypersurfaces FL degenerate into r-fold hyperplanes.
(ii) Their system of second fundamental forms possesses at least two forms
whose λ-equation has r distinct roots.
We have proved that such varieties X are cones in the space PN with a vertex
of dimension l −1, where l = n −r.
In this section we also consider varieties X with degenerate Gauss maps
of dimension n and rank r ≥2 with r-fold focus hyperplanes but we assume
that all their second fundamental forms are proportional, i.e., for each pair of
second fundamental forms of X, their λ-equation has an r-multiple eigenvalue.
Because we assume r ≥2, the generalized Segre theorem (see Theorem 2.1
in Section 2.2.5) implies that such varieties are hypersurfaces in a subspace
Pn+1. We shall prove that such hypersurfaces can diﬀer from cones.
Consider a hypersurface X with a degenerate Gauss map of dimension n
and rank r whose focus hypersurfaces FL are r-fold hyperplanes of dimension
l −1, where l = n −r is the dimension of the Monge–Amp`ere foliation on
X. We associate a family of moving frames with X in such a way that the
point A0 = x is a regular point of a generator L, the points Aa, a = 1, . . . , l,
belong to the r-fold focus hyperplane FL, the points Ap, p = l +1, . . . , n, lie in
the tangent hyperplane TL(X), and the point An+1 is situated outside of this
hyperplane. As a result of such frame specialization, basic equations (3.4) and
(3.11) of the variety X take the form
ωn+1
p
= bpqωq, ωp
a = cp
aqωq,
p, q = l + 1, . . . , n,
(4.41)
where B = (bpq) is a nondegenerate symmetric (r × r)-matrix. Because the
points Aa, a = 1, . . . , l, belong to the r-fold focus (l−1)-plane FL, the equation
of FL is
(x0)r = 0.
However, in the general case the focus hypersurface FL of the generator L is
determined by the equation
det (δp
qx0 + cp
aqxa) = 0

152
4. Main Structure Theorems
(see (3.21)). Hence, we have
det(δp
qx0 + cp
aqxa) = (x0)r
It follows that each of the matrices Ca has an r-multiple eigenvalue 0, and
as a result, each of these matrices is nilpotent. We assume that each of the
matrices Ca has the form
Ca = (cp
aq), where cp
aq = 0 for p ≥q.
(4.42)
Thus, rank Ca ≤r −1. It follows that all matrices Ca are nilpotent. Denote
by r1 the maximal rank of matrices from the bundle C = xaCa, r1 ≤r −1.
It is obvious that this form is suﬃcient for all FL to be r-fold hyperplanes.
Wu and F. Zheng [WZ 02] (see also Piontkowski [Pio 01, 02b]) proved that
this form is also necessary for the ranks r = 2, 3, 4 and diﬀerent values of the
maximum rank r1 of matrices of the bundle xaCa. For r ≤4, condition (4.42)
is also necessary for FL ⊂L to be an r-fold hyperplane. However, Wu and
F. Zheng in [WZ 02] gave also a counterexample which proves that for r ≥5,
the form (4.42) is not necessary for all FL to be r-fold hyperplanes.
A single second fundamental form of X at its regular point x = A0 can be
written as
Φ0 = bpqωpωq.
This form is of rank r. At singular points Aa belonging to an r-multiple focus
hyperplane FL, the second fundamental form of the hypersurface X has the
form
Φa = bpscs
aqωpωq,
(4.43)
where (bpscs
aq) is a symmetric matrix. The maximal rank of matrices from the
bundle Φ = xaΦa is also equal to r1 ≤r −1.
4.4.2 Hypersurfaces with Degenerate Gauss Maps of Rank r with
a One-Dimensional Monge–Amp`ere Foliation and r-Multiple Foci.
Let A0A1 be a leaf of the Monge–Amp´ere foliation, let A0 be a regular point
of this leaf, and let A1 be its r-multiple focus. Then in equations (4.41), we
have a, b = 1; p, q = 2, . . . , n, and these equations become
ωn+1
p
= bpqωq, ωp
1 = cp
qωq.
(4.44)
By our assumption (4.42), the matrix C = (cp
q) has the form
C =

We will assume that rank C = r −1 = n −2. Then in the matrix C, the
coeﬃcients cp
p+1 ̸= 0. As to the matrix B = (bpq), by the relation
BC = CB
(4.46)
(cf. (3.12), p. 94), this matrix has the form
B =

,
(4.47)
and rank B = n −1. In addition, by (4.46), the entries of the matrices B and
C are connected by certain bilinear relations implied by (4.46).
By (4.44), (4.45), and (4.47), on the hypersurface X, we have the equation
ωn
1 = 0.
(4.48)
Because on the hypersurface X equations (2.5) and (3.3) also hold, the diﬀer-
entials of the points A0 and A1 take the form
dA0 = ω0
0A0 + ω1
0A1 + ω2
0A2 + . . . + ωn−1
0
An−1 + ωn
0 An,
dA1 = ω0
1A0 + ω1
1A1 + ω2
1A2 + . . . + ωn−1
1
An−1.
(4.49)
In equations (4.49), the forms ω2
1, ω3
1, . . . , ωn−1
1
are linearly independent, and
by (4.44) and (4.45), they are expressed in terms of the basis forms ω3, . . . , ωn
only. The following cases can occur:
1) The 1-form ω0
1 is independent of the forms ω3, . . . , ωn, and hence also of
the forms ω2
1, . . . , ωn−1
1
. In this case, the r-multiple focus A1 of the rectilinear
generator L describes a focus variety G of dimension r = n−1. The variety G is
of codimension two in the space Pn+1 in which the hypersurface X is embedded.
The tangent subspace TA1(G) is deﬁned by the points A1, A0, A2, . . . , An−1.
At the point A1, the variety G has two independent second fundamental forms.
We can ﬁnd these two forms by ﬁnding the second diﬀerential of the point A1:
d2A1 ≡ωp
1ωn
p An + ωp
1ωn+1
p
An+1
(mod TA1(G)).
Thus, we have
Φn
1 = ωp
1ωn
p , Φn+1
1
= ωp
1ωn+1
p
.
The second of these forms coincides with the second fundamental form Φ1 of
the hypersurface X at the point A1. By (4.45), if ω3 = . . . = ωn = 0, the

154
4. Main Structure Theorems
1-forms ωp
1 = 0. Hence the quadratic forms Φn
1 and Φn+1
1
vanish on the focal
variety G. Therefore, the direction A1 ∧A0 is an asymptotic direction on the
variety G.
2) The 1-form ω0
1 is a linear combination of the forms ω2
1, . . . , ωn−1
1
, and
hence also of the forms ω3, . . . , ωn. In this case, the focus A1 of the rectilinear
generator L describes a focus variety G of dimension n −2, and its tangent
subspace TA1(G) is a hyperplane in the space A0 ∧A1 ∧A2 ∧. . . ∧An−1. For
ω2
1 = . . . = ωn−1
1
= 0, the point A1 is ﬁxed, and the straight line L = A1 ∧A0
describes a two-dimensional cone with vertex A1. This cone is called the ﬁber
cone. The hypersurface X foliates into an (n −2)-parameter family of such
ﬁber cones. It is called a twisted cone with rectilinear generators.
In Section 4.4.3, for n = 3 we will prove that a ﬁber cone is a pencil of
straight lines. Most likely this is true for any n.
3) Suppose that an (n−2)-dimensional focus variety G of the hypersurface
X belongs to a hyperplane Pn of the space Pn+1. We can take this hyperplane
as the hyperplane at inﬁnity Pn
∞of the space Pn+1. As a result, the space
Pn+1 becomes an aﬃne space An+1. In this case, the hypersurface X becomes a
twisted cylinder in An+1, which foliates into an (n−2)-parameter family of two-
dimensional cylinders with rectilinear generators. The hypersurface X with a
degenerate Gauss map is not a cylinder in An+1 and does not have singularities
in this space. Thus, this hypersurface is an aﬃnely complete hypersurface in
An+1, which is not a cylinder.
An example of such a hypersurface in the
space A4 was considered by Sacksteder and Bourgain (see Sacksteder [S 60],
Wu [Wu 95], Ishikawa [I 98, 99a, 99b], Akivis and Goldberg [AG 02a], and
Section 3.4).
Note also that hypersurfaces with degenerate Gauss maps in the space
Pn+1 considered in this section are lightlike hypersurfaces which were studied
in detail in the papers [AG 98b; 98c]) by Akivis and Goldberg. We will consider
them in Section 5.1.
4.4.3 Hypersurfaces with Degenerate Gauss Maps with Double
Foci on Their Rectilinear Generators in the Space P4. As an example,
we consider hypersurfaces X with degenerate Gauss maps of rank r = 2 in
the space P4 that have a single double focus F on each rectilinear generator
L = A0 ∧A1. With respect to a ﬁrst-order frame, the basic equations of X are
ω4
0 = 0, ω4
1 = 0.
(4.50)

4.4

155
The basis forms of X are ω2
0 and ω3
0. By (4.44), (4.45), and (4.47), with respect
to a second-order frame, we have the following equations

where b23 = b32 ̸= 0 and c2

The diﬀerentials of the points A0 and A1 are

0A3,
dA1 = ω0

(cf. (4.39)). The point A1 = FL is a single focus of a rectilinear generator L.
Exterior diﬀerentiation of equations (4.51) gives the following exterior quad-
ratic equations:

From equations (4.52) and (4.55), it follows that the forms ω3
2 and ω0
1 are linear
combinations of the basis forms ω2
0 and ω3
0. Three cases are possible:
1) ω0
1 ∧ω3
0 ̸= 0. Because by (4.51), this implies that ω0
1 ∧ω2
1 ̸= 0, it follows
that the focus A1 describes a two-dimensional focal surface G2. The tangent
plane to G2 at the point A1 is TA1(G) = A1 ∧A0 ∧A2, and the straight line
L = A0 ∧A1 is tangent to G2 at A1.
2)
ω0
1 ∧ω3
0 = 0.
(4.56)
In this case, the point A1 describes a focal line G1, and the straight line
L = A0 ∧A1 intersects this line G1 at the point A1. The hypersurface X

156
4. Main Structure Theorems
foliates into a one-parameter family of two-dimensional cones and is a twisted
cone.
3) The osculating hyperplane of the curve G1 is ﬁxed.
We consider these three cases in detail.
1) We prove an existence theorem for this case applying the Cartan test
(see Section 1.2.6).
Theorem 4.11. Hypersurfaces X of rank two in the space P4, for which the
single focus of a rectilinear generator L describes a two-dimensional surface,
exist, and the general solution of the system deﬁning such hypersurfaces de-
pends on one function of two variables. The direction A1A0 is an asymptotic
direction on the surfaces G2, and the hypersurface X is formed by asymptotic
tangents to the surfaces G2.
Proof. On a hypersurface in question, the inequality ω0
1 ∧ω3
0 ̸= 0 holds as well
as the exterior quadratic equations (4.52)–(4.55). The latter equations contain
ﬁve forms ω3
2, ∆b23, ∆b33, ω0
1, and ∆c2
3 that are diﬀerent from the basis forms
ω2
0 and ω3
0. So, we have q = 5.
The character s1 of the system under investigation is equal to the number of
independent exterior quadratic equations (4.52)–(4.55). Thus, we have s1 = 4.
As a result, the second character of the system is s2 = q −s1 = 1. Therefore,
the Cartan number Q = s1 + 2s2 = 6.
We now calculate the number of parameters on which the most general
integral element of the system under investigation depends. Applying Cartan’s
lemma to equations (4.52) and (4.53), we ﬁnd that






−2b23ω3
2 = b222ω2 + b223ω3,
∆b23 = b232ω2 + b233ω3,
∆b33 = b332ω2 + b333ω3
0.
(4.57)
Because the coeﬃcients of the basis forms on the right-hand sides of (4.57)
are symmetric with respect to the lower indices, the number of independent
coeﬃcients on the right-hand sides of (4.57) is S1 = 4.
Equation (4.55) implies that
ω0
1 = c2
3ω3
2 + λ ω3
0.
(4.58)
We substitute this expression into equation (4.54). As a result, we obtain
−2(c2

0 + ∆c2
3 ∧ω3
0 = 0.
(4.59)

157
It follows from (4.59) that the 1-form ∆c2
3 is a linear combination of the basis
forms. We write its expression in the form
∆c2
3 = µ ω2
0 + ν ω3
0.
(4.60)
Because b23 ̸= 0, we can ﬁnd the form ω3
2 from the ﬁrst equation of system
(4.57). Substituting this expression and (4.60) into equation (4.59), we ﬁnd
that


ω3
0 ∧ω2
0 + µ ω2
0 ∧ω3
0 = 0.
This implies that
µ = c2
3b223
b23
−λ.
Thus, there are only two independent coeﬃcients in decompositions (4.58) and
(4.60), S2 = 2.
As a result, we have S = S1 + S2 = 6, and S = Q. Applying the Cartan
test, we conclude that the system under investigation is in involution, and its
general solution depends on one function of two variables.
Next, we ﬁnd the second fundamental forms of the two-dimensional focal
surface G2 of the hypersurface X with a degenerate Gauss map. To this end,
we compute
d2A1 ≡(ω0
1ω3
0 + ω2
1ω3
2)A3 + ω2
1ω4
2A4
(mod TA1(G2)).
Thus, the second fundamental forms of G2 are
Φ3
1 = ω0
1ω3
0 + ω2
1ω3
2, Φ4
1 = ω2
1ω4
2.
The direction A1A0 is deﬁned on G2 by the equation ω2
1 = 0. By (4.51), this
equation is equivalent to the equation ω3
0 = 0. Thus, in this direction the
second fundamental forms Φ3
1 and Φ4
1 vanish:
Φ3
1 ≡0
(mod ω3
0), Φ4
1 ≡0
(mod ω3
0),
and the direction A1A0 is an asymptotic direction on the focal surface G2.
2) We prove the following existence theorem for the twisted cones.
Theorem 4.12. If condition (4.56) is satisﬁed, then the double focus A1 of
the generator A0 ∧A1 of the variety X describes the focal curve, and X is a
twisted cone. In the space P4, the twisted cones exist, and the general solution
of the system deﬁning such cones depends on ﬁve functions of one variable.

158
4. Main Structure Theorems
Proof. In this case, the point A1 describes the focal line G1. By (4.56), we
must enlarge the system of equations (4.51) by the equation
ω0
1 = a ω3
0.
(4.61)
Equation (4.61) is equivalent to equation (4.56). The 1-form ω3
0 is a basis form
on the focal line G1. By (4.61), equation (4.55) takes the form
ω3
2 ∧ω3
0 = 0.
This equation is equivalent to (4.56). It follows that
ω3
2 = b ω3
0.
(4.62)
Now equations (4.52) and (4.54) become
(∆b23 + 2b23 b ω2
0) ∧ω3
0 = 0,
(4.63)
(∆c2
3 + (a + b c2
3) ω2) ∧ω3
0 = 0.
(4.64)
Equation (4.53) remains the same.
Taking exterior derivatives of equations (4.61) and (4.62), we obtain the
exterior quadratic equations
(da + a(2ω0
0 −ω1
1 −ω3
3) + c2
3 ω0
2 + ab ω2

0 = 0,
(4.65)
(db + b(ω0
0 −ω2
2) + b23 ω3
4 + b ω2
0) ∧ω3
0 = 0.
(4.66)
Now the system of exterior quadratic equations consists of equations (4.53),
(4.63)–(4.66). Thus, we have s1 = 5. In addition to the basis forms ω2
0 and
ω3
0, these exterior equations contain the forms ∆b23, ∆b33,
∆c2
3, ∆a, and ∆b, where
∆a = da + a(2ω0
0 −ω1
1 −ω3
3) + c2
3ω0
2
(4.67)
and
∆b = db + b(ω0
0 −ω2
2) + b23ω3
4.
The number of these forms is q = 5. Thus, s2 = q −s1 = 0, and the Cartan
number Q = s1 = 5. If we ﬁnd the forms ∆b23, ∆b33, ∆c2
3, ∆a, and ∆b from
the system of equations (4.53), (4.63)–(4.66), we see that the most general
integral element of the system under investigation (i.e., the dimension S of the
space of integral elements over a point) depends on S = 5 parameters. Thus,
S = Q, the system under investigation is in involution, and its general solution
depends on ﬁve functions of one variable.

Consider the focal curve G1 of the twisted cone X3 ⊂P4 described by the
point A1. We have
dA1 = ω1
1A1 + (c2
3A2 + aA0) ω3
0.
The point A2 = c2
3A2 + aA0 along with the point A1 deﬁne a tangent line to
G1. Because c2
3 ̸= 0, we can specialize our moving frame by locating its vertex
A2 at A2 and by normalizing the frame by means of the condition c2
3 = 1 (see
Section 1.4). Then we obtain
dA1 = ω1
1A1 + ω3
0A2.
In addition, the conditions
a = 0, c2
3 = 1
are satisﬁed. These conditions and equations (4.51), (4.61), (4.64), and (4.67)
imply that

After this specialization, the straight line A1 ∧A2 becomes the tangent to
the focal line G1.

0 = 0,
ω0

It follows from the last equation that
ω0
2 = c ω3
0.
(4.71)
Note also that equation (4.66) shows that because b23 ̸= 0, the quantity b
can be reduced to 0 by means of the form ω3
4 (see Section 1.4). As a result,
equation (4.62) takes the form
ω3
2 = 0,
(4.72)
and because b23 ̸= 0, equation (4.66) becomes
ω3

0 = 0.

It follows from (4.73) that
ω3

Diﬀerentiating the point A2 and applying (4.51), (4.71), and (4.72), we
obtain
dA2 = ω2
2A2 + ω1
2A1 + (cA0 + b23A4) ω3
0.
The 2-plane α = A1 ∧A2 ∧(cA0 + b23A4) is the osculating plane of the line G1
at the point A1.
We place the point A4 of our moving frame into the plane α and make a
normalization b23 = 1. As a result, we have c = 0 and
ω0
2 = 0, ω4
2 = ω3
0.
(4.75)
Now, the plane α is deﬁned as α = A1 ∧A2 ∧A4, and the diﬀerential of A2
becomes
dA2 = ω2
2A2 + ω1
2 A1 + ω3
0 A4.
Taking the exterior derivative of the ﬁrst of two equations (4.75), we obtain
ω0

0 = 0,
and this implies that
ω0
4 = g ω3
0.
(4.76)
By means of equations (4.72) and (4.76), we ﬁnd that
dA4 = ω4
4A4 + ω1
4A1 + ω2
4A2 + (fA3 + gA0) ω3
0.
(4.77)
Equation (4.77) means that the 3-plane
β = A1 ∧A2 ∧A4 ∧(fA3 + gA0)
is the osculating hyperplane of the focal line G1.
Taking exterior derivatives of equations (4.74) and (4.76), we ﬁnd the fol-
lowing exterior quadratic equations:
(df + f(ω0

can reduce the quantities f and g to the following values:
f = 1, g = 0,

As a result, equations (4.74) and (4.76) become

(4.80)
and the osculating hyperplane β of G1 becomes

we obtain

4. Main Structure Theorems
The system of equations (4.84) is equivalent to the system of equations
(4.53), (4.63)–(4.66) from which it is obtained as a result of specializations. For
the system of equations (4.84), as it was for the original system of equations
(4.53), (4.63)–(4.66), we have
q = 5, s1 = 5, s2 = 0 and Q = S = 5.
The system is in involution, and its solution exists and depends on ﬁve func-
tions of one variable.
Formulas (4.83) and (4.84) allow us to prove the following theorem:
Theorem 4.13. A twisted cone X in the space P4 foliates into a one-parameter
family of pencils of straight lines whose centers are located on its focal line G1
and whose planes are tangent to G1.
Proof. We consider the structure of the ﬁber cones of a twisted cone X ⊂P4.
The ﬁber cones C on X are deﬁned by the system
ω3
0 = 0.
(4.85)
By (4.85) and (4.83), we have
dA0 = ω0
0A0 + ω1
0A1 + ω2
0A2.
(4.86)
It follows that the plane A0 ∧A1 ∧A2 is tangent to the ﬁber cone C along its
generator L = A0 ∧A1. By (4.85) and (4.83), the diﬀerential of the point A2
is
dA2 = ω1
2A1 + ω2
2A2,
(4.87)
and by (4.85), we also have
dA1 = ω1
1A1.
(4.88)
Equations (4.86), (4.87), and (4.88) prove that the tangent plane γ = A0 ∧
A1 ∧A2 to the ﬁber cone C is ﬁxed when the generator L = A0 ∧A1 moves
along C. It follows that a ﬁber cone C is simply a pencil of straight lines with
center at A1 located at the plane γ.
Note that in the example of Sacksteder–Bourgain hypersurface (see Section
3.4), we have seen the same situation as in Theorem 4.13. However, in Theorem
4.13 we proved this fact for the general case.
Now we prove the converse statement: A general smooth one-parameter
family of two-dimensional planes γ(t) in the space P4 forms a three-dimensional
twisted cone X. In fact, such a family envelopes a curve G1, whose point A is
the common point of the planes γ(t) and γ(t + dt), i.e.,
A(t) = γ(t) ∩γ(t + dt).

4.4
Varieties with Degenerate Gauss Maps with Multiple Foci
163
The point A(t) and the plane γ(t) deﬁne a pencil (A, γ)(t) of straight lines with
center A(t) and plane γ(t). The set of these pencils forms a three-dimensional
ruled surface X with rectilinear generators L belonging to the pencils (A, γ)(t).
Moreover, the tangent space T(X) is constant along a rectilinear generator L.
Hence the rank of the variety X equals two.
Because the dimension of the Grassmannian G(2, 4) of two-dimensional
planes in the space P4 is equal to six (see Section 1.4, p. 42), one-parameter
family of such planes depends on ﬁve functions of one variable. This number
coincides with the arbitrariness of existence of twisted cones in P4 that we com-
puted earlier by investigating a system deﬁning a twisted cone (see Theorem
4.12, p. 157).
3) Next we ﬁnd under what condition a twisted cone becomes a twisted
cylinder. This condition is equivalent to a condition under which the osculating
hyperplane β of the focal curve G1 is ﬁxed, when the point A1 moves along
G1. Because β = A1 ∧A2 ∧A3 ∧A4 and
dA3 = ω0
3A0 + ω1
3A1 + ω2
3A2 + ω3
3A3 + ω4
3A4,
the condition in question has the form
ω0
3 = 0.
(4.89)
If we take the ﬁxed osculating hyperplane β of G1 as the hyperplane at inﬁnity
H∞of the space P4, then P4 becomes an aﬃne space A4. Then the hypersur-
face X becomes a twisted cylinder 
X, which by Theorem 4.13, foliates into a
one-parameter family of planar pencils of parallel straight lines. The hypersur-
face X does not have singularities in the space A4 and is a complete smooth
noncylindrical hypersurface of rank two.
It is easy to prove the existence of twisted cylinders in the space A4.
Theorem 4.14. Twisted cylinders in the space A4 exist, and the general so-
lution of the system deﬁning such cylinders depends on four functions of one
variable.
Proof. In fact, a twisted cylinder in A4 is deﬁned by the system of equations
(4.83) and (4.89). By (4.89), the last equation of system (4.84) becomes an
identity.
Exterior diﬀerentiation of (4.89) leads to an identity too.
Thus,
in the system of exterior quadratic equations (4.84), only four equations are
independent. Thus, s1 = 4, and equations (4.84) contain only four 1-forms
that are diﬀerent from the basis forms. Hence q = 4. Therefore,
s2 = q −s1 = 0, Q = s1 + 2s2 = 4.

164
4. Main Structure Theorems
Equations (4.84) imply that S = 4. Because Q = S, the system is in involution,
and its general solution depends on four functions of one variable.
In conclusion, we indicate a construction deﬁning the general twisted cylin-
ders in the space A4. Let P3 be an arbitrary hyperplane in the projective space
P4, and let G1 be an arbitrary curve in P3. Consider a family of planes γ(t)
that are tangent to the curve G1 but do not belong to P3, such that two in-
ﬁnitesimally close planes γ(t) and γ(t + dt) of this family do not belong to a
three-dimensional subspace of the space P4. Then these two planes have only
one common point A(t) = γ(t) ∩γ(t + dt) belonging to G1, and the planes
γ(t) form a twisted cone in the space P4. If we take the hyperplane P3 as the
hyperplane at inﬁnity of P4, then the space P4 becomes an aﬃne space A4,
and a twisted cone formed by the planes γ(t) becomes a twisted cylinder in
A4. Such a construction was considered by Akivis in his paper [A 87a].
4.4.4 The Case n = 3 (Continuation).
In Section 3.2.5 we gave a
complete classiﬁcation of three-dimensional varieties X of rank two with de-
generate Gauss maps in the case when each rectilinear generator L of X has
two diﬀerent foci F1 and F2. We indicated there ﬁve classes a), b), c), d), and
e) of such varieties.
In this section we present a complete classiﬁcation of three-dimensional
varieties X of rank two with degenerate Gauss maps in the case when each
rectilinear generator L of X has a double focus F1 = F2 = F.
If F1 = F2 = F, then the following three cases are possible:
f) If a double focus F describes a two-dimensional surface V 2 = (F), then
V 2 has a four-dimensional osculating subspace and bears one family of
asymptotic lines, and a variety X is a union of tangents to a family of
asymptotic lines of V 2 (cf. Theorem 4.11, p. 155).
g) If a double focus G describes a space curve γ = (F), then a variety X
is a twisted cone formed by plane pencils of straight lines whose centers
belong to the curve γ and whose planes π are tangent to γ (cf. Theorem
4.13, p. 161).
One can also say that in this case a variety X is a band, i.e., is the union
of planes π that are tangent (not osculating) planes to the curve γ (the
support curve of the band). For deﬁnition of a band see the books [Bl 21]
(§33) or [Bl 50] (§21) by Blaschke or the book [AG 93] (Section 7.6) by
Akivis and Goldberg.
h) If a double focus F is ﬁxed, then X is a cone with vertex F.

Reducible Varieties with Degenerate
Gauss Maps
4.5.1 Some Deﬁnitions. We saw in Section 3.1.2 that the system of ma-
trices Ca and Bα are associated with a variety X with a degenerate Gauss
map of rank r. This system is said to be reducible if these matrices can be
simultaneously reduced to a block diagonal form:
Ca = diag (Ca1, . . . , Cas), Bα = diag (Bα1, . . . , Bαs),
(4.90)
where Cat and Bαt, t = 1, . . . , s, are square matrices of orders rt, and r1 +r2 +
. . . + rs = r. If such a decomposition of matrices is not possible, the system of
matrices Ca and Bα is called irreducible. If r1 = r2 = . . . = rs = 1, then the
system of matrices Ca and Bα is called completely reducible.
A variety X with a degenerate Gauss map of rank r is said to be reducible,
irreducible, or completely reducible if for any values of parameters u ∈M,
the matrices Ca and Bα are reducible, irreducible, or completely reducible,
respectively.
4.5.2 The Structure of the Focal Images of Reducible Varieties
with Degenerate Gauss Maps. Equations (3.21) and (3.24) of focal images
of a variety X with a degenerate Gauss map of rank r imply the following
proposition describing the structure of the focus hypersurfaces FL and the
focus hypercones ΦL of a reducible variety X.
Proposition 4.15. Suppose that a variety X with a degenerate Gauss map of
rank r is reducible. Then each of its focus hypersurfaces FL ⊂L decomposes
into s components Ft of dimension l −1 each and degrees r1, r2, . . . , rs, and
each of its focus hypercones ΦL decomposes into s hypercones Φt of the same
degrees r1, r2, . . . , rs; r1 + r2 + . . . + rs = r, and with the same vertex T. In
particular, if X is completely reducible, then a focus hypersurface FL decom-
poses into r hyperplanes, and a focus hypercone ΦL decomposes into r bundles
of hyperplanes with (n + 1)-dimensional axes.
Proof. We assume that the index t takes only two values, t = 1, 2, r = r1 + r2,
and the indices p and q have the following values:
p1, q1 = l + 1, . . . , l + r1, p2, q2 = l + r1 + 1, . . . , n.
Then equations (3.11) and (3.4) become

Thus the focus hypersurface FL decomposes into two (l −1)-dimensional com-
ponents F1 and F2 deﬁned by the equations
F1 : det(δp1
q1 x0 + cp1
aq1xa1) = 0,
F2 : det(δp2
q2 x0 + cp2
aq2xa2) = 0
of degrees r1 and r2.
The focus hypercone ΦL also decomposes into two components Φ1 and Φ2
deﬁned by the equations
Φ1 : det(ξαbα
p1q1) = 0,
Φ2 : det(ξαbα
p2q2) = 0
of degrees r1 and r2.
The proof of Proposition 4.15 for any number of components is similar to
the above proof.
4.5.3 The Structure Theorems for Reducible Varieties with
Degenerate Gauss Maps. In this subsection we prove the main theorems
of this section.

4.5
Reducible Varieties with Degenerate Gauss Maps
167
Theorem 4.16. Suppose that a variety X is reducible and its matrices Bαt
and Cit deﬁned in (4.90) are of order rt, t = 1, . . . , s. Then X is foliated into
s families of (l + rt)-dimensional varieties of rank rt with l-dimensional plane
generators. For rt = 1, these varieties are torses, and for rt ≥2, they are
irreducible varieties described in Theorem 4.4 and 4.5.
Proof. We again assume that the index t takes only two values, t = 1, 2,
r = r1 + r2, and the indices p and q have the following values:
p1, q1 = l + 1, . . . , l + r1, p2, q2 = l + r1 + 1, . . . , n.
Then equations (3.11) and (3.4) become (4.91).

Consider the system of equations

where θq1

(4.99)
where i = {0, a} and cp

q. Suppose that the component F1 of the focus
hypersurface FL does not have multiple components. Assuming that l ≥1, we
write equations (4.99) for two diﬀerent values of the index i, for example, for
i = 0, 1. Because the matrices (cp1
as1) and (cp2
as2) are not proportional, then it
follows from (4.99) that two terms occurring in (4.99) vanish separately. In
particular, this means that
cp1
is1θs1
q2 ∧ωq2 = 0.
(4.100)
Because the number of linearly independent forms among the 1-forms ωp1
i
connected with the basis forms by relations (4.91) is equal to the number of
linearly independent forms ωq1 (i.e., it is equal to r1), then it follows from
(4.100) that
θs1
q2 ∧ωq2 = 0.
But the last equations coincide with equations (4.97) and are conditions of com-
plete integrability of (4.96). Thus, the variety X foliates into an r1-parameter
family of varieties of dimension l+r2 and of rank r2, and these varieties belong
to the types described in Theorems 4.4 and 4.5.
In a similar way, one can prove the complete integrability of equations
ωq2 = 0 on the variety X. Thus the variety X foliates also into an r2-parameter
family of varieties of dimension l + r1 and of rank r1.
By induction over s, we can prove the result, which we have proved for
s = 2 components, for the case of any number s of components.
Note that the torsal varieties described in Theorem 4.3 are completely
reducible, and the varieties X described in Theorems 4.4 and 4.5 are irreducible
varieties.
The following theorem follows from Theorem 4.8 and the theorems proved
in Sections 4.1–4.2 and 4.4.
Theorem 4.17. Suppose that X is a variety with a degenerate Gauss map in
the space PN, dim X = n, rank X = r < n, for which all focus hypersurfaces
FL have components F ∗
L of degree r∗< r.
Then X foliates into (r −r∗)-
parameter family of varieties X∗of dimension n∗= r∗+ l, where l = n −r is
the dimension of plane generators of the variety X. Moreover,
(a) If each of the focus hypersurfaces F ∗
L of a variety X∗decomposes into r∗
simple hyperplanes, then all varieties X∗are torses.

4.6
Embedding Theorems
169
(b) If r∗≥2 and the focus hypersurfaces F ∗
L of a variety X∗do not decom-
pose, then all varieties X∗are hypersurfaces in the space Pn∗+1, where
n∗= r∗+ l.
(c) If r∗≥2 and the focus hypercones Φ∗
L of a variety X∗do not decompose,
then all varieties X∗are cones with (l −1)-dimensional vertices.
(d) If l = 1, r∗= 2, and each rectilinear generator of the variety X bears a
double focus F ∗
L describing an r-dimensional variety G in the space PN,
then G foliates into two-dimensional surfaces G2, and each G2 bears a
one-parameter family of asymptotic lines. The variety X itself foliates
into three-dimensional varieties X∗with degenerate Gauss maps of rank
two formed by the tangents to the asymptotic lines of the surfaces G2.
(e) If l = 1, r∗= 2, and the rectilinear generators of the variety X bears
a double focus F ∗
L describing an (r −1)-dimensional variety G in the
space PN, then the variety X foliates into an (r −2)-parameter family of
twisted cones of rank two formed by pencils of straight lines in the planes
tangent to the curves C ⊂G.
Most likely, statements (d) and (e) can be generalized for the cases when
r∗> 2.
Thus, Theorems 4.16 and 4.17 describe the structure of general varieties
with degenerate Gauss maps. As a result, these theorems are structure theo-
rems for such varieties.
Note that Theorem 4.17 does not cover varieties with degenerate Gauss
maps with multiple nonlinear components of their focal images.
This gives rise to the following problem (see Akivis and Goldberg [AG 01a]):
Problem. Construct an example of a variety X ⊂PN(C) with a degenerate
Gauss map whose focal images have multiple nonlinear components or prove
that such varieties do not exist. It is assumed that the variety X itself does
not have multiple components.
4.6
Embedding Theorems for Varieties with
Degenerate Gauss Maps
4.6.1 The Embedding Theorem. In this section we prove the theorem for
varieties X with degenerate Gauss maps giving suﬃcient conditions for X to
be embedded into a subspace PM of the space PN, M < N. The dual theorem
gives suﬃcient conditions for X to be a cone.

170
4. Main Structure Theorems
Theorem 4.18. Let X ⊂PN be a variety with a degenerate Gauss map of
dimension n and rank r < n.
Suppose that all matrices Bα can be simul-
taneously diagonalized, Bα = diag (Bα
pp). Suppose also that the rectangular
(r × (N −n))-matrix B = (bα
pp) composed from the eigenvalues of the matrices
Bα has a rank r1 ≤r −1, and this rank is not reduced when we delete any
column of this matrix. Then the variety X belongs to a subspace Pn+r1 of the
space PN.
Proof. Under the conditions of Theorem 4.18, equations (3.4) takes the form
ωα
p = bα
ppωp, p = l + 1, . . . , n, α = n + 1, . . . , N.
(4.101)
The matrix B has only r1 linearly independent rows. Thus by means of trans-
formations of the moving frame vertices located outside of the tangent subspace
TL, equations (4.101) can be reduced to the form
ωλ
p = bλ
ppωp, ωσ
p = 0,
(4.102)
where λ = n + 1, . . . , n + r1, σ = n + r1 + 1, . . . , N. The third of equations
(3.5) takes the form
dAp = ω0
pA0 + ωa
pAa + ωq
pAq + ωλ
pAλ,
and the points Aλ together with the points A0, Aa, and Aq deﬁne the osculating
subspace T 2
L of the variety X for all points x ∈L. The dimension of T 2
L is
n + r1, dim T 2
L = n + r1.
Diﬀerentiation of the points Aλ gives
dAλ ≡ωσ
λAρ
(mod T 2
L),
(4.103)
where λ, µ = n + 1, . . . , n + r1; σ = n + r1 + 1, . . . , N. If ωp = 0, then the
osculating subspace T 2
L of X remains ﬁxed. It follows from equations (4.103)
that the 1-forms ωσ
λ are expressed in terms of the basis forms ωp of X, that is,
ωσ
λ = lσ
λpωp.
(4.104)
Taking exterior derivatives of the second group of equations (4.102), we
ﬁnd that
ωλ
p ∧ωσ
λ = 0.
(4.105)
Substituting the values of the 1-forms ωλ
p and ωσ
λ from equations (4.102) and
(4.104) into equation (4.105), we ﬁnd that
bλ
ppωp ∧lσ
λqωq = 0.

4.6
Embedding Theorems
171
In this equation the summation is carried over the indices λ and q, but there
is no summation over the index p. It follows from these equations that
bλ
pplσ
λq = 0, p ̸= q.
(4.106)
System (4.106) is a system of linear homogeneous equations with respect to
the unknown variables lσ
λq. For each pair of the values σ and q, system (4.106)
has the rank r −1 and r1 unknowns. Because r1 ≤r −1, under the conditions
of Theorem 4.18, the rank of the matrix of coeﬃcients of this system is equal
to r1. As a result, the system has only the trivial solution lσ
λq = 0. Thus,
equations (4.104) take the form
ωλ
σ = 0.
(4.107)
It follows from (4.103) and (4.107) that the osculating subspace T 2
L of X re-
mains ﬁxed when L moves in X. Thus X ⊂Pn+r1.
Remark. If r1 = r and N > n + r, then the osculating subspace T 2
L of X
can move in PN when L moves in X. In this case the variety X is torsal.
Theorem 4.18 generalizes Theorem 2.1 proved in Section 2.2. The latter is
similar to Theorem 3.10 from the book [AG 93] by Akivis and Goldberg and
was proved in [AG 93] for varieties of a space PN bearing a net of conjugate
lines. As we noted in Chapter 2, this theorem generalizes a similar theorem
of C. Segre (see [SegC 07], p. 571) proved for varieties X of dimension n of
the space PN, which has at each point x ∈X the osculating subspace T 2
x of
dimension n + 1. By this theorem, a variety X either belongs to a subspace
Pn+1 or is a torse.
4.6.2 A Suﬃcient Condition for a Variety with a Degenerate
Gauss Map to be a Cone.
The theorem dual to Theorem 4.18 is also
valid and gives a suﬃcient condition for a variety with a degenerate Gauss
map to be a cone.
Theorem 4.19. Let X ⊂PN be an n-dimensional variety with a degenerate
Gauss map of rank r < n. Suppose that all matrices Ca can be simultane-
ously diagonalized, Ca = diag (cp
ap). Suppose also that the rectangular (r × l)-
matrix C = (cp
ap) composed from the eigenvalues of the matrices Ca has a rank
r2 ≤r −1, and this rank is not reduced when we delete any column of this
matrix. Then the variety X is a cone with an (l −r2)-dimensional vertex KL.
Proof. The proof of this theorem is similar to the proof of Theorem 4.18.

4. The Main Structure Theorems
NOTES
4.1–4.2. The basic types of varieties with degenerate Gauss maps (torsal va-
rieties, hypersurfaces, and cones) were considered in the recent paper [AG 01a] by
Akivis and Goldberg. Note that the hypersurfaces with degenerate Gauss maps as a
basic type were omitted in the paper [GH 79] by Griﬃths and Harris.
The results presented in Example 4.6 are due to Safaryan [Saf 70] (see also Section
4.6 of the book [AG 93] by Akivis and Goldberg).
4.3.
Hartman and Nirenberg indicated in [HN 59]: “A similar result under
weaker diﬀerentiability hypotheses has been stated for n = 2 by Pogorelov” (see
[P 56a, 56b]). For E3, the results of [HN 59] were developed further by Stocker (see
[Sto 61, 69]).
In recent papers (see, for example, Ishikawa’s papers [I 99a, 99b]) the authors
state the Hartman–Nirenberg cylinder theorem by saying that “a properly embedded
developable hypersurface in En+1 of rank (γ) ≤1 is necessarily a cylinder.” A similar
result is known for a complex Euclidean space Cn+1 (see the paper by Abe [Ab 72];
see also the survey [Bor 97] by Borisenko).
Note that an aﬃne cylinder theorem in other formulations was presented in the
paper [NP 87] by Nomizu and Pinkall (see also the book [NS 94] by Nomizu and
Sasaki) and in the papers [O 95, 96, 98] by Opozda. Their aﬃne cylinder theorems
give suﬃcient conditions for a hypersurface (i.e., a variety of codimension one) X in
An+1 to be a cylinder erected over a curve with (n−1)-dimensional plane generators.
Our aﬃne cylinder theorem (Theorem 4.10) gives suﬃcient conditions for a variety X
of any codimension and any rank r, 2 ≤r ≤n−1, in AN, N −n ≥2, to be a cylinder
erected over a submanifold of dimension r and rank r with (n−r)-dimensional plane
generators. In the recent papers [Pio 01, 02a, 02b], Piontkowski considered in PN
complete varieties with degenerate Gauss maps with rank equal to two, three, and
four and with all singularities located at a hyperplane at inﬁnity. In particular, as an
extreme case, he obtained an aﬃne cylinder theorem for varieties of rank one and any
codimension. So our aﬃne cylinder theorem for varieties of codimension greater than
two and rank r ≥2 complements substantially all previously known aﬃne cylinder
theorems that were for hypersurfaces of rank one.
4.4.
In subsections 4.4.1–4.4.3 we follow the paper [AG 03b] by Akivis and
Goldberg.
Recently Wu and F. Zheng [WZ 02] considered a variety X of dimension n with a
degenerate Gauss map in the complex Euclidean space CN and proved that if r ≤4
or r = n −1, then X is a twisted cylinder, i.e., it is foliated by cylinders (which
reduce to (n −1)-planes when r = 2) whose generators are level sets of the Gauss
map. This was conjectured by Vitter [V 79] for any value of r (and proved by him
for r = 2), but the authors give counterexamples showing that it fails to be true for
r = 5.
As we indicated in the Notes to Chapter 3, a classiﬁcation of three-dimensional
varieties with degenerate Gauss maps was presented in the papers [Rog 97] by Rogora
and [MT 02a] by Mezzetti and Tommasi. In particular, in these papers, the varieties
of the class g) were described as bands (although Rogora did not use this term). The

Notes
173
description of a variety of this class as a twisted cone appeared in this book for the
ﬁrst time.
4.5–4.6. In these sections we follow the paper [AG 01a] by Akivis and Goldberg.
The problem at the end of Section 4.5 was posed by Akivis and Goldberg in their
paper [AG 01a]. In the recent preprint [MT 02c], Mezzetti and Tommasi constructed
a series of examples of varieties that solve the problem.

Further Examples and
Applications of the Theory
of Varieties with
Degenerate Gauss Maps
In Section 5.1, we deﬁne the de Sitter space, prove that lightlike hypersurfaces in such a space
have degenerate Gauss maps, that their rank r ≤n −1, and that there are singular points
and singular submanifolds on them. We classify singular points and describe the structure
of lightlike hypersurfaces carrying singular points of diﬀerent types. Moreover, we establish
the connection of this classiﬁcation with that of canal hypersurfaces of the conformal space.
The cases of maximal rank r = n−1 and of reduced rank r < n−1 are considered separately.
In Section 5.2, we establish a relation of the theory of varieties with degenerate Gauss maps
in projective spaces with the theory of congruences and pseudocongruences of subspaces and
show how these two theories can be applied to the construction of induced connections on
submanifolds of projective spaces and other spaces endowed with a projective structure. In
Section 5.3, we consider smooth lines on projective planes over the complete matrix algebra
M of order two, the algebra C of complex numbers, the algebra C1 of double numbers, and
the algebra C0 of dual numbers. For the algebras C, C1, and C0, in the space RP5, to these
smooth lines there correspond families of straight lines describing three-dimensional point
varieties X3 with degenerate Gauss maps of rank r ≤2.
We prove that they represent
examples of diﬀerent types of varieties X3 with degenerate Gauss maps. Namely, the variety
X3, corresponding in RP5 to a smooth line Γ ⊂CP2, does not have real singular points, the
variety X3, corresponding in RP5 to a smooth line Γ ⊂C1P2, bears two plane singular lines,
and ﬁnally the variety X3, corresponding in RP5 to a smooth line Γ ⊂C0P2, bears one double
singular line. In the last case, the variety X3 is a generalization of Sacksteder–Bourgain’s
hypersurfaces with degenerate Gauss maps without singularities in the Euclidean space E4.
We deﬁne the notion of the curvature of a smooth line in the plane AP2, A = C, C1, C0, and
we prove that in all three cases, the rank of X3 equals the rank of the curvature of the line Γ.

5. Further Examples and Applications
5.1
Lightlike Hypersurfaces in the de Sitter
Space and Their Focal Properties
5.1.1 Lightlike Hypersurfaces and Physics. It is well known that the
pseudo-Riemannian manifolds (M, g) of Lorentzian signature play a special
role in geometry and physics and that they are models of spacetime of general
relativity. At the tangent space Tx of an arbitrary point x of such a manifold,
one can invariantly deﬁne a real isotropic cone Cx. From the point of view of
physics, this cone is the light cone: trajectories of light impulses emanating
from the point x are tangent to this cone.
An (n + 1)-dimensional Riemannian manifold(M, g) is called Lorentzian if
its metric tensor g has the signature (n, 1).
Hypersurfaces of a Lorentzian
manifold (M, g) can be of three types: spacelike, timelike, and lightlike (see,
for example, the books [ON 83] by O’Neill or [AG 96] by Akivis and Goldberg).
The tangent hyperplane to a spacelike hypersurface X, dim X = n, of a
Lorentzian manifold (M, g) at any point does not have real common points
with the light cone Cx. This implies that on X a proper Riemannian metric
is induced. The tangent hyperplane to a timelike hypersurface X at any point
intersects the light cone Cx along an (n −1)-dimensional cone. This implies
that on X a pseudo-Riemannian metric of Lorentzian signature (n −1, 1) is
induced. Finally, the tangent hyperplane to a lightlike hypersurface X at any
point is tangent to the light cones Cx. This implies that on X a degenerate
Riemannian metric signature (n −1, 0) is induced.
A Lorentzian manifold of constant positive curvature is called the de Sitter
space. The de Sitter space Sn+1
1
admits a realization on the exterior of an
n-dimensional oval hyperquadric Qn of a projective space Pn+1. Thus the de
Sitter space is isometric to a pseudoelliptic space, Sn+1
1
∼ext Qn. Because
the interior of the hyperquadric Qn is isometric to the hyperbolic geometry of
the Lobachevsky space Hn+1, Hn+1 ∼int Qn and the geometry of Qn itself
is equivalent to that of an n-dimensional conformal space Cn, Cn ∼Qn, the
groups of motions of these three spaces are isomorphic to each other and are
isomorphic to the group SO(n + 2, 1) of rotations of a pseudo-Euclidean space
En+2
1
of Lorentzian signature. This allows us to apply the apparatus developed
in the book [AG 96] by Akivis and Goldberg for the conformal space Cn to
the study of the de Sitter space.
As we will show in this section, lightlike varieties in the de Sitter space are
varieties with degenerate Gauss maps. For this reason we study them in this
book. From the point of view of physics, lightlike hypersurfaces are of great
importance because they are models of diﬀerent types of horizons studied in
general relativity: event horizons, Cauchy’s horizons, Kruskal’s horizons (see

5.1
Lightlike Hypersurfaces in the de Sitter Space
177
the books [Ch 83] by Chandrasekhar and [MTW 73] by Misner, Thorpe, and
Wheeler). This is why the study of geometric structure of lightlike hypersur-
faces is of interest.
5.1.2 The de Sitter Space. In a projective space Pn+1 of dimension
n + 1, we consider an oval hyperquadric Qn. Let x be a point of the space
Pn+1 with projective coordinates (x0, x1, . . . , xn+1). The hyperquadric Qn is
determined by the equations
(x, x) := gξηxξxη = 0,
ξ, η = 0, . . . , n + 1,
(5.1)
whose left-hand side is a quadratic form (x, x) of signature (n + 1, 1). The
hyperquadric Qn divides the space Pn+1 into two parts, external and internal.
We normalize the quadratic form (x, x) in such a way that for the points of the
external part the inequality (x, x) > 0 holds. This external domain is a model
of the de Sitter space Sn+1
1
(see, for example, Y. Zheng [Z 96]). We identify
the external domain of Qn with the space Sn+1
1
. The hyperquadric Qn is the
absolute of the space Sn+1
1
.
On the hyperquadric Qn of the space Pn+1, the geometry of a conformal
space Cn is realized. The bijective mapping Cn ↔Qn is called the Darboux
mapping, and the hyperquadric Qn itself is called the Darboux hyperquadric.
Figure 5.1
The Darboux mapping sends hyperspheres of the space Cn to cross sections
of the hyperquadric Qn by hyperplanes ξ. It also sends a hyperplane ξ to a
point x that is polar-conjugate to ξ with respect to Qn and lies outside of Qn,
that is, a point of the space Sn+1
1
(see Figure 5.1). Thus, points of the space
Sn+1
1
correspond to hyperspheres of the space Cn.
Let x be an arbitrary point of the space Sn+1
1
. The tangent lines from the
point x to the hyperquadric Qn form a second-order cone Cx with vertex at
the point x. This cone is called the isotropic cone. For spacetime, whose model

178
5. Further Examples and Applications
is the space Sn+1
1
, this cone is the light cone, and its generators are lines of
propagation of light impulses whose source coincides with point x.
The cone Cx divides all straight lines passing through the point x into
spacelike (not having common points with the hyperquadric Qn), timelike (in-
tersecting Qn in two diﬀerent points), and lightlike (tangent to Qn) straight
lines. The lightlike straight lines are generators of the cone Cx.
A spacelike straight line l ⊂Sn+1
1
corresponds to an elliptic pencil of hy-
perspheres in the conformal space Cn. All hyperspheres of this pencil pass
through a common (n −2)-sphere Sn−2 (the center of this pencil). The sphere
Sn−2 is the intersection of the hyperquadric Qn and the (n −1)-dimensional
subspace of the space Pn+1 that is polar-conjugate to the line l with respect
to the hyperquadric Qn.
A timelike straight line l ⊂Sn+1
1
corresponds to a hyperbolic pencil of
hyperspheres in the space Cn. Two arbitrary hyperspheres of this pencil do
not have common points, and the pencil contains two hyperspheres of zero
radius that correspond to the points of intersection of the straight line l and
the hyperquadric Qn.
Finally, a lightlike straight line l ⊂Sn+1
1
corresponds to a parabolic pencil
of hyperspheres in the space Cn consisting of hyperspheres tangent to each
other at a point that is a unique hypersphere of zero radius belonging to this
pencil.
Hyperplanes of the space Sn+1
1
are also divided into three types. Spacelike
hyperplanes do not have common points with the hyperquadric Qn; a timelike
hyperplane intersects Qn along a real hypersphere; and lightlike hyperplanes
are tangent to Qn. Subspaces of any dimension r, 2 ≤r ≤n −1, can be
classiﬁed in a similar manner.
Let us apply the method of moving frames to study some questions of dif-
ferential geometry of the space Sn+1
1
. With a point x ∈Sn+1
1
we associate
a family of projective frames {A0, A1, . . . , An+1}. In order to apply formulas
derived in the book [AG 96] by Akivis and Goldberg, we will use the nota-
tions used in that book. Namely, we denote by An the vertex of the moving
frame that coincides with the point x, An = x; we locate the vertices A0, Ai
i = 1, . . . , n −1,, and An+1 at the hyperplane ξ that is polar-conjugate to the
point x with respect to the hyperquadric Qn, and we assume that the points
A0 and An+1 lie on the hypersphere Sn−1 = Qn ∩ξ, and the points Ai are
polar-conjugate to the straight line A0 ∧An+1 with respect to Sn−1. Because
(x, x) > 0, we can normalize the point An by the condition (An, An) = 1. The
points A0 and An+1 are not polar-conjugate with respect to the hyperquadric
Qn. Hence we can normalize them by the condition (A0, An+1) = −1. As a
result, the matrix of scalar products of the frame elements has the form

The quadratic form gijxixj occurring in (5.3) is positive deﬁnite.

(5.5)
These formulas are precisely the formulas derived in the book [AG 96] (see p.
32) by Akivis and Goldberg for the conformal space Cn.
It follows from (5.4) that
dAn = ω0
nA0 + ωi
nAi + ωn+1
n

(5.6)
The diﬀerential dAn belongs to the tangent space Tx(Sn+1
1
), and the 1-forms
ω0
n, ωi
n, and ωn+1
n
form a coframe of this space. The total number of these forms
is n+1, and this number coincides with the dimension of Tx(Sn+1
1
). The scalar
square of the diﬀerential dAn is the metric quadratic form g on the manifold
Sn+1
1
. By (5.2), this quadratic form g can be written as
g = (dAn, dAn) = gijωi
nωj
n −2ω0
nωn+1
n
.
Because the ﬁrst term of this expression is a positive deﬁnite quadratic form,
the form g is of Lorentzian signature (n, 1). The coeﬃcients of the form g

180
5. Further Examples and Applications
produce the metric tensor of the space Sn+1
1
whose matrix is obtained from
the matrix (5.2) by deleting the nth row and the nth column.
The quadratic form g deﬁnes on Sn+1
1
a pseudo-Riemannian metric of signa-
ture (n, 1). The isotropic cone deﬁned in the space Tx(Sn+1
1
) by the equation
g = 0 coincides with the cone Cx that we deﬁned earlier in the space Sn+1
1
geometrically.
The 1-forms ωη
ξ occurring in equations (5.4) satisfy the structure equations
of the space Cn:
dωη
ξ = ωζ
ξ ∧ωη
ζ ,
(5.7)
which are obtained by taking exterior derivatives of equations (5.4) and which
are conditions of complete integrability of (5.4). The forms ωη
ξ are invariant
forms of the fundamental group PO(n + 2, 1) of transformations of the spaces
Hn+1, Cn, and Sn+1
1
which is locally isomorphic to the group SO(n + 2, 1).
Let us write equations (5.7) for the 1-forms ω0

(5.9)
where θ = (ωu
n), u = 0, i, n+1, is the column matrix with its values in the vector
space Tx(Sn+1

v ), u, v = 0, i, n + 1, is a square matrix of order
n + 1 with values in the Lie algebra of the group of admissible transformations
of coframes of the space Tx(Sn+1

). The form ω is the connection form of the
space Sn+1

By (5.5), in this matrix, only the forms in the upper-left corner, which form
an n × n-matrix, are linearly independent.
Next we ﬁnd the curvature form and the curvature tensor of the space Sn+1
1
.
To this end, we take exterior derivative of the connection form ω, more pre-
cisely, of its independent part. Applying equations (5.7), we ﬁnd the following

(5.13)
It follows from (5.13) that
Rr
suv = δr
ugsv −δr

(5.14)
where (gsv) is the matrix of coeﬃcients of the quadratic form (5.3). But this
means that the space Sn+1
1
is a pseudo-Riemannian space of constant positive
curvature K = 1. The Ricci tensor of this space has the form
Rsv = Rr
srv = ngsv.
(5.15)
This conﬁrms that the space Sn+1
1
, as any pseudo-Riemannian space of constant
curvature, is the Einstein space.
Thus by means of the method of moving frame we proved the following
well-known theorem (see, for example, Wolf [W 77]).
Theorem 5.1. The de Sitter space, whose model is the domain of a projective
space Pn+1 lying outside of an oval hyperquadric Qn, is a pseudo-Riemannian
space of Lorentzian signature (n, 1) and of constant positive curvature K = 1.
This space is homogeneous, and its fundamental group PO(n + 2, 1) is locally
isomorphic to the special orthogonal group SO(n + 2, 1).
5.1.3 Lightlike Hypersurfaces in the de Sitter Space. A hypersurface
X, dim X = n, in the de Sitter space Sn+1
1
is said to be lightlike if all its tangent
hyperplanes are lightlike, that is, they are tangent to the hyperquadric Qn,
which is the absolute of the space Sn+1
1
.

182
5. Further Examples and Applications
Denote by x an arbitrary point of the hypersurface X, by η the tangent
hyperplane to X at the point x, η = Tx(X), and by y the point of tangency
of the hyperplane η with the hyperquadric Qn (see Figure 5.2).
Next, as
in Section 5.1.1, denote by ξ the hyperplane that is polar-conjugate to the
point x with respect to the hyperquadric Qn, and associate with a point
x a family of projective frames such that x = An, y = A0, the points Ai,
i = 1, . . . , n −1, belong to the intersection of the hyperplanes ξ and η,
Ai ∈ξ ∩η, and the point An+1, as well as the point A0, belong to the straight
line that is polar-conjugate to the (n −2)-dimensional subspace spanned by
the points Ai. In addition, we normalize the frame vertices in the same way as
this was done in Section 5.1.2. Then the matrix of scalar products of the frame
elements has the form (5.2), and the components of inﬁnitesimal displacements
of the moving frame satisfy the Pfaﬃan equations (5.5).
Figure 5.2
Because the hyperplane η is tangent to the hypersurface X at the point
x = An and does not contain the point An+1, the diﬀerential of the point
x = An has the form
dAn = ω0
nA0 + ωi
nAi,
(5.16)
the following equation holds:
ωn+1
n
= 0,
(5.17)
and the forms ω0
n and ωi
n are basis forms of the hypersurface X.
By relations (5.5), it follows from equation (5.17) that
ωn
0 = 0
(5.18)
and
dA0 = ω0
0A0 + ωi
0Ai.
(5.19)
Taking the exterior derivative of equation (5.17), we obtain
ωi
n ∧ωn+1
i
= 0.

5.1
Lightlike Hypersurfaces in the de Sitter Space
183
Because the forms ωi
n are linearly independent, by Cartan’s lemma, we ﬁnd
from the last equation that
ωn+1
i
= νijωj
n, νij = νji.
(5.20)
Applying an appropriate formula from (5.5), we ﬁnd that
ωi
0 = gijωn+1
j
= gikνkjωj
n,
(5.21)
where (gij) is the inverse matrix of the matrix (gij).
Note that if ωi
n = 0, then by (5.20), ωn+1
i
= 0, and by (5.5), ωi
0 = 0.
Now formulas (5.16) and (5.19) show that for ωi
n = 0, the isotropic straight
line AnA0 is ﬁxed, and hence X is a ruled hypersurface. In what follows, we
assume that the entire straight line An ∧A0 belongs to the hypersurface X.
Thus the following theorem holds.
Theorem 5.2. A lightlike hypersurface X of the de Sitter space Sn+1
1
bears
an (n −1)-parameter family of rectilinear generators l = An ∧A0 ⊂Sn+1
1
that
are tangent to the absolute Q of this space at the points A0.
The rectilinear generators l = An ∧A0 forms on the hypersurface X a
foliation (not a ﬁbration), because, as we will show, each of them carries
r ≤n −1 singular points (if each is counted as many times as its multiplicity),
and this foliation is not locally trivial.
Next, we prove the following theorem.
Theorem 5.3. A lightlike hypersurface X of the de Sitter space Sn+1
1
is a
ruled hypersurface with a degenerate Gauss map γ : X →G(n, n + 1) whose
rank is equal to the dimension of the variety Y described by the point A0 on
the hyperquadric Qn.
Proof. Formulas (5.16) and (5.19) show that at any point of a generator of
the hypersurface X, its tangent hyperplane is ﬁxed and coincides with the
hyperplane η. Thus X is a hypersurface with a degenerate Gauss map.
From relations (5.16) and (5.19) it follows that the tangent hyperplane η of
the hypersurface X along its generator AnA0 is determined by this generator
and the points Ai,
η = An ∧A0 ∧A1 ∧. . . ∧An−1.
The displacement of this hyperplane is determined by the diﬀerentials (5.16),
(5.19), and
dAi = ω0

i Aj + ωn
i An + ωn+1

An+1.
But by (5.5), ωn
i = −gijωj
n, and the forms ωn+1
i
are expressed according to
formulas (5.50). From formulas (5.20) and (5.21) it follows that the rank of

184
5. Further Examples and Applications
the hypersurface X is determined by the rank of the matrix (νij) in terms of
which the 1-forms ωn+1
i
and ωi
0 are expressed. But by (5.19) and (5.21), the
dimension of the variety Y described by the point A0 on the hyperquadric Qn
is also equal to the rank of the matrix (νij).
Denote the rank of the tensor νij, which is equal to the rank of the hyper-
surface X, by r. In this and following sections we will assume that r = n −1,
and the case r < n −1 will be considered in Section 5.1.4.
For r = n −1, the hypersurface X carries an (n −1)-parameter family of
isotropic rectilinear generators L = An∧A0 along which the tangent hyperplane
Tx(X) is ﬁxed. From the point of view of physics, the isotropic rectilinear
generators of a lightlike hypersurface X are trajectories of light impulses, and
the hypersurface X itself represents a light ﬂux in spacetime.
Because rank (νij) = n −1, the variety Y described by the point A0 on
the hyperquadric Qn has dimension n −1, that is, Y is a hypersurface in
Qn, dim Y = n −1. The tangent subspace TA0(Y ) to Y is determined by the
points A0, A1, . . . , An−1. Because (An, Ai) = 0, this tangent subspace is polar-
conjugate to the rectilinear generator An ∧A0 of the lightlike hypersurface
X.
The variety Y of the hyperquadric Qn is the image of a hypersurface of the
conformal space Cn under the Darboux mapping. We will denote this hyper-
surface also by Y . In the space Cn, the hypersurface Y is deﬁned by equation
(5.18) which by (5.5) is equivalent to equation (5.17) deﬁning a lightlike hy-
persurface X in the space Sn+1
1
. To the rectilinear generator An ∧A0 of the
hypersurface X, there corresponds a parabolic pencil of hyperspheres An+sA0
tangent to the hypersurface Y (see the book [AG 96] by Akivis and Goldberg,
p. 40). Thus the following theorem is valid.
Theorem 5.4. There exists a one-to-one correspondence between the set of
hypersurfaces of the conformal space Cn and the set of lightlike hypersurfaces
of the maximal rank r = n −1 of the de Sitter space Sn+1
1
. To the pencils
of tangent hyperspheres of the hypersurface Y there correspond the isotropic
rectilinear generators of the lightlike hypersurface X.
Note that for lightlike hypersurfaces of the four-dimensional Minkowski
space M 4 the result similar to the result of Theorem 5.4 was obtained by
Kossowski in [Kos 89].
5.1.4 Singular Points of Lightlike Hypersurfaces in the de Sitter
Space. Suppose that the hypersurface X has the maximal rank r = n −1.
This implies that X bears rectilinear generators L = An ∧A0. Taking exterior
derivative of equations (5.18) deﬁning the hypersurface Y in the conformal

space Cn, we obtain

i = 0,
from which by linear independence of the 1-forms ωi
0 on Y and Cartan’s lemma
we ﬁnd that
ωn
i = bijωj
0, bij = bji.
(5.22)
It is not diﬃcult to ﬁnd relations between the coeﬃcients νij in formulas
(5.20) and bij in formulas (5.22). Substituting the values of the forms ωn
i and
ωj
0 from (5.5) into (5.22), we ﬁnd that
−gijωj
n = bijgjkωn+1
k
.
Solving these equations for ωn+1
k
, we obtain
ωn+1
i
= −gikbklgljωj
n,
where (bkl) is the inverse matrix of the matrix (bij). Comparing these equations
with equations (5.20), we obtain
νij = −gikbklglj.
(5.23)
Of course, in this computation we assumed that the matrix (bij) is nondegen-
erate.
Consider the point
z = An + sA0
(5.24)
on the rectilinear generator L = An∧A0 of the hypersurface X. Diﬀerentiating
this point and applying formulas (5.16) and (5.19), we obtain
dz = (ds + sω0
0 + ω0
n)A0 + (ωi
n + sωi
0)Ai.
(5.25)
By (5.5) and (5.22), we have
ωi
n = gikωn
k = −gikbkjωj
0.
As a result, formula (5.25) becomes
dz = (ds + sω0
0 + ω0
n)A0 −gik(bkj −sgkj)ωj
0Ai.
(5.26)
The diﬀerential dz is the diﬀerential of the Gauss map γ : X →G(n, n+1)
that was considered in Theorem 5.2. The linearly independent forms ωi
0 are
basis forms on the parametric manifold M n−1, and the form θ = ds+sω0

n
is a basis form on the line l. Thus the matrix

where ˆbi
j = gik(bkj −sgkj), is the Jacobi matrix of this mapping.
By (5.26), the tangent subspace Tz(X) to the hypersurface X at the point
z is determined by the points z, A0, and bi
jAi. Thus the point z is a regular
point of the hypersurface X if and only if
det(bij −sgij) ̸= 0.
In particular, the condition det(bij) ̸= 0 is necessary and suﬃcient for the point
An ∈L = An ∧A0 to be regular.
The equation
det(bij −sgij) = 0
(5.27)
deﬁnes singular points on the rectilinear generator L of the hypersurface X.
This equation is the characteristic equation of the matrix (bij) with respect
to the matrix (gij). Because the matrices (bij) and (gij) are both symmetric,
and (gij) deﬁnes the positive deﬁnite quadratic form g and is of rank n −1,
equation (5.27) has n −1 real roots if each is counted as many times as its
multiplicity. Thus each rectilinear generator An∧A0 of a lightlike hypersurface
X carries n −1 real singular points.
From the point of view of geometric optics, the singular points are the
points of condensation of light rays on a lightlike hypersurface X, i.e., they are
foci, and the varieties deﬁned by them in the space Sn+1
1
are the focal varieties,
or the caustics, on X (cf. Example 3.5 on p. 103).
Denote the roots of the characteristic equation (5.27) by sh, h = 1, 2, . . . ,
n −1. Then the foci on the rectilinear generator An ∧A0 corresponding to
these roots can be written in the form
Fh = An + shA0.
(5.28)
It is clear from (5.28) that the point A0 is not a focus of the rectilinear
generator An ∧A0.
This is explained by the fact that by our assumption
rank (νij) = n −1, and by (5.21), on the hyperquadric Qn the point A0
describes a hypersurface Y that is transversal to the straight lines An ∧A0.
In the conformal theory of hypersurfaces, to the singular points Fh, there
correspond the tangent hyperspheres deﬁning the principal directions at a point
A0 of the hypersurface Y of the conformal space Cn (see p. 55 in the book
[AG 96] by Akivis and Goldberg).
We now construct a classiﬁcation of singular points of a lightlike hyper-
surface X of the space Sn+1
1
. We will use some computations made in the paper
Akivis and Goldberg [AG 98a] in which a classiﬁcation of canal hypersurfaces
was constructed.

Suppose ﬁrst that F1 = An + s1A0 is a singular point deﬁned by a simple

(5.29)
where

where (ˆbpq) = (bpq −s1gpq) is a nondegenerate symmetric matrix.
Because the point F1 is deﬁned invariantly on the generator An ∧A0, it is
ﬁxed if ωi
0 = 0. Thus it follows from (5.29) that
ds1 + s1ω0
0 + ω0
n = s1iωi,
(5.32)
here and in what follows ωi = ωi
0. By (5.31) and (5.32), relation (5.29) takes
the form
dF1 = s11ω1A0 + (s1pA0 −ˆbq
pAq)ωp.
(5.33)
Here the points Cp = s1pA0 −ˆbq
pAq are linearly independent and belong to the
tangent subspace Tx(X).
Consider the variety F1 described by the singular point F1 in the space
Sn+1
1
. This variety is called the focal variety of the hypersurface X. Relation
(5.33) shows that two cases are possible:
1) s11 ̸= 0. In this case the variety F1 is of dimension n−1, and its tangent
subspace at the point F1 is determined by the points F1, A0, and Cp. This
subspace contains the straight line An ∧A0 and intersects the hyperquadric
Qn. Thus this subspace, as well as the variety F1 itself, is timelike. For ωp = 0,
the point F1 describes a curve γ on the variety F1, which is tangent to the

188
5. Further Examples and Applications
straight line F1 ∧A0 coinciding with the generator An ∧A0 of the hypersurface
X. The curve γ is an isotropic curve on the variety F1. Thus on F1 there
arises a ﬁber bundle of focal lines. The hypersurface X foliates into an (n−2)-
parameter family of torses for which these lines are edges of regressions. The
points F1 are singular points of a kind called a fold.
If the characteristic equation (5.27) has distinct roots, then an isotropic
rectilinear generator l of a lightlike hypersurface X carries n −1 distinct foci
Fh, h = 1, . . . , n−1. If for each of these foci the condition of type s11 ̸= 0 holds,
then each of them describes a focal variety Fh of dimension n −1 carrying a
conjugate net. Curves of one family of this net are tangent to the straight lines
l, and this family is isotropic. On the hypersurface Y of the space Cn = Qn
described by the point A0, the net of curvature lines corresponds to these
conjugate nets.
2) s11 = 0. In this case, relation (5.33) takes the form
dF1 = (s1pA0 −ˆbq
pAq)ωp,
(5.34)
and the focal variety F1 is of dimension n −2. Its tangent subspace at the
point F1 is determined by the points F1 and Cp. An arbitrary point z of this
subspace can be written in the form
z = znF1 + zpCp = zn(An + s1A0) + zp(s1pA0 −ˆbq
pAq).
Substituting the coordinates of this point into relation (5.3), we ﬁnd that
(z, z) = grsˆbr
pˆbs
qzpzq + (zn)2 > 0.
It follows that the tangent subspace TF1(F1) does not have common points
with the hyperquadric Qn, that is, it is spacelike. Because this takes place for
any point F1 ∈F1, the focal variety F1 is spacelike.
For ωp = 0, the point F1 is ﬁxed. The subspace TF1(F1) is ﬁxed too. On the
hyperquadric Qn, the point A0 describes a curve q that is polar-conjugate to
TF1(F1). Because dim TF1(F1) = n −2, the curve q is a conic, along which the
two-dimensional plane polar-conjugate to the subspace TF1(F1) with respect to
the hyperquadric Qn intersects Qn. Thus for ωp = 0, the rectilinear generator
An ∧A0 of the hypersurface X describes a two-dimensional second-order cone
with vertex at the point F1 and the directrix q.
Hence in the case under
consideration a lightlike hypersurface X foliates into an (n −2)-parameter
family of second-order cones whose vertices describe the (n −2)-dimensional
focal variety F1, and the points F1 are conic singular points of the hypersurface
X.

5.1
Lightlike Hypersurfaces in the de Sitter Space
189
The hypersurface Y of the conformal space Cn corresponding to such a
lightlike hypersurface X is a canal hypersurface that envelops an (n −2)-
parameter family of hyperspheres.
Such a hypersurface carries a family of
cyclic generators that depends on the same number of parameters. Such hyper-
surfaces were investigated in detail in the paper Akivis and Goldberg [AG 98a].
Further let F1 be a singular point of multiplicity m, where m ≥2, of a
rectilinear generator An ∧A0 of a lightlike hypersurface X of the space Sn+1

deﬁned by an m-multiple root of characteristic equation (5.27). We assume
that
s1 = s2 = . . . = sm := s0, s0 ̸= sp,
(5.35)
and that a, b, c = 1, . . . , m and p, q, r = m + 1, . . . , n −1. Then the matrices

n can be expressed in terms of the

ds0 + s0ω0
0 + ω0
n = s0cωc + s0qωq.

Substituting decomposition (5.41) into equation (5.40), we ﬁnd that
(ˆbpqωp
a + gabs0qωb) ∧ωq + gabs0cωb ∧ωc = 0.
(5.42)
The left-hand side of (5.42) does not have similar terms. Hence both terms
are equal to 0. Equating to 0 the coeﬃcients of the summands of the second
term, we ﬁnd that
gabs0c = gacs0b.
(5.43)
Contracting this equation with the matrix (gab) which is the inverse matrix of
the matrix (gab), we obtain
ms0c = s0c.
Because m ≥2, it follows that
s0c = 0,
and relation (5.41) takes the form
ds0 + s0ω0
0 + ω0
n = s0pωp.
(5.44)
For the singular point F1 of multiplicity m of the generator An ∧A0 in
question, equation (5.29) can be written in the form
dF1 = (ds0 + s0ω0

Substituting decomposition (5.44) in the last equation, we ﬁnd that

(5.45)
This relation is similar to equation (5.34) with the only diﬀerence being that in
(5.34) we had p, q = 2, . . . , n −1, and in (5.45) we have p, q = m + 1, . . . , n −1.
Thus the point F1 describes a spacelike focal variety F1 of dimension n−m−1.
For ωp
0 = 0, the point F1 is ﬁxed, and the point A0 describes an m-dimensional
variety on the hyperquadric Qn, which is a cross section of Qn by an (m + 1)-
dimensional subspace that is polar-conjugate to the (n −m −1)-dimensional
subspace tangent to the variety F1.
The point F1 is a conic singular point of multiplicity m of a lightlike hyper-
surface X, and this hypersurface foliates into an (n−m−1)-parameter family of
(m+1)-dimensional second-order cones circumscribed about the hyperquadric
Qn. The hypersurface Y of the conformal space Cn that corresponds to such a
hypersurface X is an m-canal hypersurface (i.e., the envelope of an (n−m−1)-
parameter family of hyperspheres), and it carries an m-dimensional spherical
generators.

5.1
Lightlike Hypersurfaces in the de Sitter Space
191
Note also the extreme case when the rectilinear generator L = An ∧A0 of
a lightlike hypersurface X carries a single singular point of multiplicity n −1.
It follows from our consideration of the cases m ≥2 that this singular point is
ﬁxed, and the hypersurface X becomes a second-order hypercone with vertex
at this singular point which is circumscribed about the hyperquadric Qn. This
hypercone is the isotropic cone of the space Sn+1
1
. The hypersurface Y of the
conformal space Cn that corresponds to such a hypersurface X is a hypersphere
of the space Cn.
The following theorem combines the results of this section.
Theorem 5.5. A lightlike hypersurface X of maximal rank r = n−1 of the de
Sitter space Sn+1
1
possesses n −1 real singular points on each of its rectilinear
generators L = An∧A0 if each of these singular points is counted as many times
as its multiplicity. The simple singular points can be of two kinds: a fold and
conic. In the ﬁrst case, the hypersurface X foliates into an (n −2)-parameter
family of torses, and in the second case, it foliates into an (n −2)-parameter
family of second-order cones. The vertices of these cones describe the (n −2)-
dimensional spacelike variety in the space Sn+1
1
. All multiple singular points
of a hypersurface X are conic. If a rectilinear generator of a hypersurface X
carries a singular point of multiplicity m, 2 ≤m ≤n−1, then the hypersurface
X foliates into an (n−m−1)-parameter family of (m+1)-dimensional second-
order cones. The vertices of these cones describe the (n −m −1)-dimensional
spacelike variety in the space Sn+1
1
. The hypersurface Y of the conformal space
Cn corresponding to a lightlike hypersurface X with singular points of multi-
plicity m is a canal hypersurface that envelops an (n−m−1)-parameter family
of hyperspheres and has m-dimensional spherical generators.
Because lightlike hypersurfaces X of the de Sitter space Sn+1
1
represent
a light ﬂux (see Section 5.1.2), its focal varieties have the following physical
meaning. If one of them is a lighting variety, then others are varieties of con-
centration of the light ﬂux. Intensity of concentration depends on multiplicity
of a focus describing this variety. Each of these focal varieties is a caustic, i.e.,
a locus of concentration of light rays.
In the extreme case, when an isotropic rectilinear generator L = An ∧A0
of a hypersurface X carries one (n −1)-multiple focus, the hypersurfaces X
degenerates into the light cone generated by a point source of light. This cone
represents a radiating light ﬂux.
If each isotropic generator L ⊂X carries two foci F1 and F2 of multiplic-
ities m1 and m2, m1 + m2 = n −1, m1 > 1, m2 > 1, then these foci describe
spacelike varieties F1 and F2 of dimension n −m1 −1 and n −m2 −1, respec-
tively. If one of these varieties is a lighting variety, then on the second one a
light ﬂux is concentrated.

5.1.5 Lightlike Hypersurfaces of Reduced Rank in the de Sitter
Space. As we proved in Section 5.1.2, lightlike hypersurfaces of the de Sitter
space Sn+1
1
are ruled hypersurfaces with degenerate Gauss maps. However, in
Section 5.1.4, we assumed that the rank of these hypersurfaces is maximal,
that is, it is equal to n −1. In this section we consider lightlike hypersurfaces
of reduced rank r < n −1.
We proved in Section 5.1.3 that the rank of a lightlike hypersurface X
coincides with the rank of the matrix (νij) deﬁned by equation (5.20) as well as
with the dimension of the variety V described by the point A0 on the Darboux
hyperquadric Qn. As a result, to a lightlike hypersurface X of rank r there
corresponds an r-dimensional variety Y, dim Y = r, in the conformal space Cn.
The symmetric matrices (gij) and (νij), the ﬁrst of which is nondegenerate
and positive deﬁnite and the second of which is of rank r, can be simultaneously
reduced to quasidiagonal forms

det(νpq) ̸= 0. This implies that formulas (5.21) take the form
ωa
0 = 0, ωp
0 = gpsνsqωq
n.
(5.47)
The second equation in system (5.47) shows that the 1-forms ωp
0 are linearly
independent: they are basis forms on the variety Y, dim Y = r, described by
the point A0 on the hyperquadric Qn, on the lightlike hypersurface X of rank
r, and also on a frame bundle associated with this hypersurface. The 1-forms
occurring in equations (5.4) as linear combinations of the basis forms ωp
0 are
principal forms, and the 1-forms that are not expressed in terms of the basis
forms are ﬁber forms on the above mentioned frame bundle.
By (5.5), the second group of equations (5.47) is equivalent to the system
of equations
ωn
p = bn

(5.48)
where bn
pq = −gpsνstgtq, (νst) is the inverse matrix of the matrix (νpq),
bn
pq = bn
qp, and det(bn
pq) ̸= 0. Note that we can also obtain equations (5.48) by
diﬀerentiation of equation (5.18) which holds on the hypersurface X.
Taking exterior derivatives of the ﬁrst group of equations (5.47), we ﬁnd
that
ωp

p = 0.
Applying Cartan’s lemma to this system, we ﬁnd that
ωa
p = ba

Let us prove that in our frame an (m+1)-dimensional span L of the points
A0, Aa, and An is a plane generator of the hypersurface X. In fact, it follows

In the last equations δ is the symbol of diﬀerentiation with respect to the ﬁber
parameters (i.e., for ωp

η = ωξ

Equations (5.52) show that for ωp
0 = 0, the point An of the hypersur-
face X moves in an (m + 1)-dimensional domain belonging to the subspace
L = A0 ∧A1 ∧. . . ∧Am ∧An of the same dimension. Let us assume that the
entire subspace L belongs to the hypersurface X, and that the point An ∈L
moves freely in L. The subspace L is tangent to the hyperquadric Qn at the
point A0 ∈Y , and thus L is lightlike.
Because the point A0 describes an
r-dimensional variety, the family of subspaces L depends on r parameters.
Equations (5.51) and (5.52) show that the basis 1-forms of the lightlike
hypersurface X are divided into two classes: ωp
n and ωa
n. The forms ωp
n are
connected with the displacement of the lightlike (m + 1)-plane L in the space

the point A0 remains ﬁxed, the rectilinear generator An ∧A0 describes an m-
dimensional bundle of straight lines with its center at the point A0, and this

bundle belongs to the ﬁxed (m + 1)-dimensional subspace L passing through
this point.
Further consider an arbitrary point
z = z0A0 + zaAa + znAn
(5.53)
of the generator L of the lightlike hypersurface X. From formulas (5.51) it
follows that the diﬀerential of any such point belongs to one and the same n-
dimensional subspace A0∧. . .∧An tangent to the hypersurface X at the original
point An. The latter means that the tangent subspace to the hypersurface X
is not changed when the point z moves along the lightlike generator L of the
hypersurface X. Thus, the hypersurface X is a hypersurface with a degenerate
Gauss map of rank r.
As a result, we arrive at the following theorem making Theorem 5.3 more
precise.
Theorem 5.6. If the rank of the tensor νij deﬁned by relation (5.20) is equal to
r, r < n−1, then a lightlike hypersurface X of the de Sitter space Sn+1
1
is a ruled
hypersurface with a degenerate Gauss map of rank r with (m + 1)-dimensional
lightlike generators, m = n−r−1, along which the tangent hyperplanes of X are
constant. The points of tangency of lightlike generators with the hyperquadric
Qn form an r-dimensional variety Y, dim Y = r, on Qn.
The last fact mentioned in Theorem 5.6 can also be treated in terms of
quadratic hyperbands (see the book [AG 93] by Akivis and Goldberg, p. 256).
By Theorem 5.6, the hypersurface X is the envelope of an r-parameter family of
hyperplanes η tangent to the hyperquadric Qn at the points of an r-dimensional
smooth submanifold Y belonging to this hyperquadric.
But this coincides
precisely with the deﬁnition of the quadratic hyperband. Thus Theorem 5.6
can be complemented as follows.
Theorem 5.7. A lightlike hypersurface X of rank r in the de Sitter space
Sn+1
1
is an r-dimensional quadratic hyperband with the support submanifold
Y, dim Y = r, belonging to the Darboux hyperquadric Qn.
Note also the extreme case when the rank of a lightlike hypersurface X is
equal to 0. Then we have
νij = 0, ωi
0 = 0.
The point A0 is ﬁxed on the hyperquadric Qn, and the point An moves freely in
the hyperplane η tangent to the hyperquadric Qn at the point A0. The lightlike
hypersurface X degenerates into the hyperplane η tangent to the hyperquadric
Qn at the point A0, and the quadratic hyperband associated with X is reduced
to a degenerate 0-pair consisting of the point A0 and the hyperplane η.

Let us also ﬁnd singular points on a rectilinear generator L of a lightlike
hypersurface X of rank r of the de Sitter space Sn+1
1
. To this end, we write the
diﬀerential of a point z ∈L deﬁned by equation (5.53). We will be interested
only in the part of this diﬀerential that does not belong to the generator L.
By (5.51), we obtain
dz ≡(z0ωp
0 + zaωp
a + znωp
n)Ap
(mod L).
By (5.48), (5.49), and (5.50), we ﬁnd from the last relation that
dz ≡N p
q (z)ωq
0Ap
(mod L),
where
N p
q (z) = δp
qz0 −gabgpsbb
sqza −gpsbn
sqzn.
(5.54)
At singular points of a generator L the dimension of the tangent subspace
Tx(X) to the hypersurface X is reduced. By (5.54), this is equivalent to the
reduction of the rank of the matrix N p
q (z). Thus singular points of generator
L can be found from the condition
det N p
q (z) = 0,
(5.55)
which deﬁnes an algebraic focus hypersurface F order r in the (m + 1)-dimen-
sional plane generator L. The left-hand side of equation (5.55) is the Jacobian
of the Gauss map γ : X →G(n, n + 1), and the focal variety F is the locus
of singular points of this map that are located in the plane generator L of the
hypersurface X indicated in Theorem 5.2 on p. 183.
If the rank of a lightlike hypersurface X is maximal, that is, it is equal to
r = n −1, then its determinant manifold F is a set of singular points of its
rectilinear generator An ∧A0 determined by equation (5.28). On the other
hand, if r < n −1, then singular points of the straight lines An ∧A0 lying
in the generator L are also determined by equation (5.28), and they are the
common points of these straight lines and the variety F.

Induced Connections on Submanifolds
5.2.1 Congruences and Pseudocongruences in a Projective Space.
The theory of congruences and pseudocongruences of subspaces of a projective
space is closely related to the theory of varieties with degenerate Gauss maps.
In a projective space PN, we consider a family Y of its l-dimensional sub-
spaces L, dim L = l, which depends on r = n −l parameters. We assume
that not more than a ﬁnite number of subspaces L passes through every point

196
5. Further Examples and Applications
x ∈Pn. If we restrict ourselves by a small neighborhood of a subspace L, then
we can assume that only one subspace L ⊂Y passes through a generic point
x ∈L. Such families of the space Pn are called the congruences.
In a three-dimensional space P3 as well as in three-dimensional spaces en-
dowed with a projective structure (such as an aﬃne, Euclidean, and non-
Euclidean space), the theory of congruences was studied by many geometers.
The extensive monographs on this subject were published (see, for example,
the monograph [Fi 50] by Finikov).
The dual image for a congruence Y of l-dimensional subspaces in Pn is a
pseudocongruence Y ∗which is an r-parameter family of subspaces of dimen-
sion r −1. Every hyperplane ξ ⊂Pn contains not more than a ﬁnite number
of subspaces L∗⊂Y ∗. However, if we consider an inﬁnitesimally small neigh-
borhood of the subspace L∗of the pseudocongruence Y ∗, then there is only a
single subspace L∗in the hyperplane ξ.
In this section, we shall establish a relation of the theory of varieties with
degenerate Gauss maps in projective spaces with the theory of congruences and
pseudocongruences of subspaces and show how these two theories can be ap-
plied to the construction of induced connections on submanifolds of projective
spaces and other spaces endowed with a projective structure.
So, consider in Pn a congruence Y of l-dimensional subspaces L. We asso-
ciate with its element L a family of projective frames {A0, A1, . . . , An} chosen
in such a way that the points A0, A1, . . . , Al are located in L, and the points
Al+1, . . . , An are located outside of L. The equations of inﬁnitesimal displace-
ment of such frames have the form
 
dAi = ωj
i Aj + ωp
i Ap,
dAp = ωi
pAi + ωq
pAq,
(5.56)
where i, j = 0, 1, . . . , l; p, q = l+1, . . . , n, and L = A0∧A1 . . .∧Al is a generator
of the congruence Y in question. Because this generator depends on r param-
eters and is ﬁxed, when ωp
i = 0, the forms ωp
i are expressed linearly in terms
of the diﬀerentials of these r parameters or in terms of linearly independent
1-forms θp—linear combinations of these diﬀerentials:
ωp
i = cp
iqθq.
(5.57)
Under admissible linear transformations of the basis forms θp, the matrices
Ci = (cp
iq) are transformed according to the tensor law with respect to the
indices p and q.
A point F ∈L ⊂Y is called a focus of a generator L if dF ∈L under some
condition on the basis forms θp. In order to ﬁnd the foci, we represent them
in the form F = xiAi. Then
dF ≡xiωp
i Ap
(mod L),

5.2
Induced Connections on Submanifolds
197
and as a result, the foci are determined by the system of equations
xiωp
i = 0.
By (5.57), this system takes the form
xicp
iqθq = 0.
(5.58)
This system has a nontrivial solution with respect to the forms θq if and only if
det(xicp
iq) = 0.
(5.59)
Equation (5.59) determines on L the focus hypersurface FL, which is an alge-
braic hypersurface of degree r.
Suppose that the point A0 of our moving frame does not belong to the
hypersurface FL. Then the 1-forms ωp
0 are linearly independent, and we can
take these forms as basis forms of the congruence Y . As a result, equations
(5.57) become
ωp
a = cp
aqωq
0,
(5.60)
where a = 1, . . . , l, and cp
0q = δp
q. Now equations (5.60) coincide with equations
(3.11). As a result, equation (5.59) of the focus hypersurface FL takes the form
det(x0δp
q + xacp
aq) = 0.
(5.61)
Equation (5.61) coincides with equation (3.21) deﬁning the foci on a plane
generator L of a variety X with a degenerate Gauss map of rank r. However,
unlike in Chapter 3, the quantities cp
aq are not connected by any relations of
type (3.9), because now there is no matrices Bα = (bα
pq).
Thus, the focus
hypersurfaces FL determined by equation (5.61) are arbitrary determinant
varieties (see Section 1.5.2, pp. 44–46) on generators L of the congruence Y in
question.
In particular, if l = 1 and n = r + 1, then Y becomes a rectilinear congru-
ence. Equation (5.61) deﬁning the focus hypersurfaces FL of such a congruence
becomes
det(x0δp
q + x1cp
1q) = 0.
(5.62)
Hence, each of the focus hypersurfaces FL of Y decomposes into r real or
complex points if each is counted as many times as its multiplicity. Each of
these points describes a focal variety in Pn tangent to the generators L of the
congruence Y . Recall that we encountered a similar situation in Section 5.1
(see p. 186) when we studied lightlike hypersurfaces in the de Sitter space.
Next, we consider a pseudocongruence Y ∗in the space Pn. Its generator
L∗is of dimension r−1 and depends on r parameters. We place the points Ap,

198
5. Further Examples and Applications
p = l+1, . . . , n, l = n−r, of our moving frame into the generator L∗⊂Y ∗and
place the points Ai, i = 0, 1, . . . , l, outside of L∗. The equations of inﬁnitesimal
displacement of such frames again have the form (5.56) but now the 1-forms
ωi
p are linear combinations of the basis forms θp deﬁning a displacement of the
generator L∗= Al+1 ∧. . . ∧An. So now we have
ωi
p = bi
pqθq
(5.63)
and
dAp = ωq
pAq + bi
pqθqAi.
(5.64)
Consider a hyperplane ξ passing through the generator L∗⊂Y ∗. Relative
to our moving frame, the equation of ξ is ξixi = 0, where ξi are tangential
coordinates of the hyperplane ξ. The hyperplane ξ, which in addition to the
generator L∗contains also a near generator ′L∗determined by the points Ap
and dAp, is called the focus hyperplane. By (5.64), the conditions deﬁning the
focus hyperplane are
ξibi
pqθq = 0.
(5.65)
The system of equations (5.65) deﬁnes a displacement of the generator L∗if
and only if this system has a nontrivial solution with respect to the forms
θq. The necessary and suﬃcient condition for existence of such a nontrivial
solution is the vanishing of the determinant of system (5.65):
det(ξibi
pq) = 0.
(5.66)
Equation (5.66) deﬁnes the family of focus hyperplanes passing through the
generator L∗⊂Y ∗. This family is an algebraic hypercone of degree r whose
vertex is the generator L∗. Note that equation (5.66) is similar to equation
(3.24) of the focus hypercone ΦL of a variety with a degenerate Gauss map.
5.2.2 Normalized Varieties in a Multidimensional Projective
Space.
Consider a smooth r-dimensional variety X in a projective space
Pn, r < n. The diﬀerential geometry on such a variety is rather poor. It is less
rich than the diﬀerential geometry on varieties of the Euclidean space En or
the spaces of constant curvature Sn and Hn. With a ﬁrst-order neighborhood
of a point x ∈X ⊂Pn, only the tangent subspace Tx(X) is associated. As
we saw in Section 1.4, where we studied a curve in the projective plane P2,
in order to enrich the diﬀerential geometry, it is necessary to use diﬀerential
prolongations of rather higher orders of the curve equations.
However, we can enrich the diﬀerential geometry of X ⊂Pn if we endow X
with an additional construction consisting of a subspace Nx(X) of dimension
n −r such that Tx(X) ∩Nx(X) = x, and an (r −1)-dimensional subspace

5.2
Induced Connections on Submanifolds

Kx(X), Kx(X) ⊂Tx(X), x /∈Kx(X). We shall denote these subspaces simply
by Nx and Kx and call the normals of the ﬁrst and second kind (or simply
the ﬁrst and second normals) of the variety X, respectively (see the book by
Norden [N 76], p. 198). The family of ﬁrst normals forms a congruence N,
and the family of second normals forms a pseudocongruence K in the space
Pn. If at any point of x ∈X, there are assigned a single ﬁrst normal Nx and a
single second normal Kx, then the variety X is called normalizated (cf. Norden
[N 76], p. 198, and Akivis and Goldberg [AG 93], Chapter 6).
As we will see below, on varieties of the Euclidean space En and the non-
Euclidean spaces Sn and Hn, the ﬁrst and second normals are determined by
the geometry of these spaces while on varieties of the aﬃne space An and
the projective space Pn, these normals should be assigned artiﬁcially, or to
ﬁnd them, one should use higher order neighborhoods of a point x ∈X. In
this section, we shall apply the ﬁrst method. Note that the second method is
connected with great computational diﬃculties. One can ﬁnd more details on
this method and a related bibliography in the books [AG 93] by Akivis and
Goldberg, Chapters 6, 7, and Norden [N 76], Chapter 5.
Thus, we consider now a normalized variety X of dimension r, r = dim X,
in the projective space Pn. We associate with X a family of projective frames
{A0, A1, . . . , An} in such a way that A0 = x, Aa ∈Nx, a = 1, . . . , l, where
l = n −r, and Ap ∈Kx, p = l + 1, . . . , n.
The equations of inﬁnitesimal
displacement of these frames have the form

dAa = ω0

aAp,
dAp = ω0
pA0 + ωa

pAq,
(5.67)
Equations (5.67) show that for the family of moving frames in question,
the system of diﬀerential equations
ωa = 0
(5.68)
is satisﬁed, and the 1-forms ωp are basis forms, because they determine a
displacement of the point A0 = x along the variety X. Exterior diﬀerentiation
of equations (5.68) and application of Cartan’s lemma lead to the following
equations:
ωa
p = ba
pqωq, ba
pq = ba
qp
(5.69)
(cf. equations (2.11) in Section 2.1). As we saw in Section 2.1, the quantities
ba
pq form a tensor and are coeﬃcients of the second fundamental forms of the
variety X at the point x:
Φa = ba
pqωpωq.
(5.70)

200
5. Further Examples and Applications
The points Ap belong to the tangent subspace Tx(X). We assume that
these points belong to the second normal Kx ⊂Tx(X), Kx = Al+1 ∧. . . ∧An.
Then, for ωp = 0, the 1-forms ω0
p must also vanish, and as a result, we have
ω0
p = lpqωq.
(5.71)
Next, we place the points Aa of our moving frame into the ﬁrst normal Nx
of X, Nx = A0 ∧A1 ∧. . . ∧Al. Then, for ωp = 0, we obtain that ωp
a = 0, and
hence
ωp
a = cp
aqωq.
(5.72)
Consider a point y ∈Nx on the ﬁrst normal.
For this point, we have
y = y0A0 + yaAa. Diﬀerentiating this point by means of (5.67), we ﬁnd that
dy = (dy0 + y0ω0
0 + yaω0
a)A0 + (y0ωp + yaωp
a)Ap + (dya + ybωa
b )Aa.
(5.73)
A point y is a focus of the ﬁrst normal Nx if dy ∈Nx. By (5.73), this
condition implies that
y0ωp + yaωp
a = 0.
Applying relations (5.72), we ﬁnd that
(y0δp
q + yacp
aq)ωq = 0.
This system has a nontrivial solution with respect to the forms ωq if and only if
det(y0δp
q + yacp
aq) = 0.
(5.74)
Equation (5.74) diﬀers from equation (5.61) only in notation, and it deﬁnes the
focus hypersurface Fx in the generator Nx of the congruence of ﬁrst normals
associated with the variety X. It follows from equation (5.74) that the point
x ∈X, whose coordinates are y0 = 1, ya = 0, does not belong to the focus
hypersurface Fx.
Let us ﬁnd the focus hypercones Φx of the pseudocongruence K of second
normals of X. The hypercones Φx are formed by the hyperplanes ξ of the
space Pn containing the second normal Kx = Al+1 ∧. . . ∧An ⊂Tx(X) and its
neighboring normal Kx + dKx, which contains not only the points Ap but also
the points
dAp ≡ω0
pA0 + ωa
pAa
(mod Nx).
As a result, tangential coordinates ξ0 and ξa of such a hyperplane satisfy the
equations
ξ0ω0
p + ξaωa
p = 0.

5.2
Induced Connections on Submanifolds
201
By (5.71) and (5.72), it follows from this equation that
(ξ0lpq + ξaba
pq) ωq = 0.
This system has a nontrivial solution with respect to the forms ωq if and only
if its determinant vanishes,
det(ξ0lpq + ξaba
pq) = 0.
(5.75)
Equation (5.75) determines an algebraic hypercone of order r whose vertex
is the generator Kx of the pseudocongruence K of the second normals. This
hypercone is called the focus hypercone of the pseudocongruence K.
Next, we consider the tangent and normal bundles associated with a nor-
malized variety X. The base of both bundles is the variety X itself, the ﬁbers of
the tangent bundle are the tangent subspaces Tx, and the ﬁbers of the normal
bundle are the second normals Nx.
Suppose that ′x = x + xpAp is an arbitrary point in the tangent subspace
Tx, and x = ′x −x = xpAp is a vector in the tangent bundle TX.
The
diﬀerential of this vector has the form
dx = (dxp + xqωp
q)Ap + xp(lpqA0 + ba
pqAa)ωq.
(5.76)
The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (5.76) belongs to the tangent subspace
Tx, and the second term belongs to Nx. The 1-form Dxp = dxp + xqωp
q is
called the covariant diﬀerential of the vector ﬁeld x = (xp). The vector ﬁeld
x is called parallel on the tangent bundle T(X) if the form Dxp vanishes, i.e.,
if
Dxp = dxp + xqωp
q = 0.
(5.77)
The 1-forms ωp
q are the components of the connection form ω = {ωp
q} of the
aﬃne connection on the variety X.
We ﬁnd the exterior diﬀerentials of the components ωp
q of the connection
form ω. By (5.69), (5.71), and (5.72), these exterior diﬀerentials have the form
dωp
q = ωs

From equation (5.78) it follows that

to compute the curvature tensor for diﬀerent normalizations of the variety X.
If Rp
qst = 0 on the variety X, then the aﬃne connection on X is ﬂat, and a
parallel translation of a vector x does not depend on the path of integration
(see, for example, Norden [N 76], p. 118, or Kobayashi and Nomizu [KN 76],
p. 70).
Further, we consider a vector ﬁeld y in the normal bundle N(X). This
vector is determined by the point x and a point y = y0A0 + yaAa of the ﬁber
Nx ⊂N(X). The diﬀerential of the point y is deﬁned by equation (5.73).
The 1-form
Dya = dya + ybωa
b
(5.81)
is called the covariant diﬀerential of the vector ﬁeld y in the normal bundle
N(X), and the forms ωb
a are the components of the connection form of the
normal connection on a normalized variety X (see, for example, Cartan [C
01], p.
242; see more on the normal connection in the paper [AG 95] and
Section 6.3 of the book [AG 93] by Akivis and Goldberg). The 2-form
Ωa
b = dωa
b −ωc

is called the curvature form of the normal connection. Note that Cartan in
[C 01] called this form the Gaussian torsion of an embedded variety X.
Diﬀerentiating the forms ωa
b and applying formulas (5.69) and (5.72), we
ﬁnd the expression of the curvature form Ωa
b:

The second normals Kx associated with the variety X allow us to ﬁnd a
distribution ∆y of r-dimensional subspaces associated with X. The elements
of the distribution ∆y are linear spans of the points y ∈Nx and the second
normals Kx, ∆y = y ∧Kx. By (5.73), the distribution ∆y is determined by
the system of equations
dya + ybωa
b = 0.
(5.84)

5.2
Induced Connections on Submanifolds
203
In the general case, the system of equations (5.84) is not completely integrable,
and when a point x moves along a closed contour l ⊂X, the corresponding
point y does not describe a closed contour.
But the point y describes a closed contour l′ if system (5.84) is completely
integrable. The condition of complete integrability of (5.84) is the vanishing
of the tensor of normal curvature (5.83) of the variety X. In this case, the
distribution ∆y deﬁned by system (5.84) is completely integrable, and the
closed contours l′ lie on integral varieties of this distribution. These integral
varieties form an (n −r)-parameter family of r-dimensional subvarieties X(y)
which are “parallel” to the variety X in the sense that the subspaces Tx(X)
and Tx(X(y)) pass through the same second normal Kx.
Now suppose that a normalized variety X ⊂Pn has a ﬂat normal connec-
tion, i.e., Ra
bst = 0. By (5.83), these conditions lead to the relation
ba
ptcp
bs = ba
pscp
bt.
(5.85)
Relations (5.85) diﬀer from relations (3.9) (p. 94) in Chapter 3 only in notation.
If we introduce the matrix notations
Ba = (ba
pq), Cb = (cp
bq)
(cf. Section 3.1, p. 94), then relations (5.85) take the form
(BaCb) = (BaCb)T
(5.86)
(cf. (3.12), p. 94).
We proved in Chapters 3 and 4 that these relations imply that the matrices
Ba and Cb can be simultaneously reduced to a diagonal form or a block diagonal
form. Therefore, the focus hypersurfaces Fx ⊂Nx of the variety X decompose
into the plane generators of diﬀerent dimensions (see Chapters 3 and 4). This
property of the varieties X with a ﬂat normal connection allows us to construct
a classiﬁcation of such varieties in the same way as this was done for the
varieties with degenerate Gauss maps in a projective space. For varieties in
an aﬃne space and a Euclidean space, such a classiﬁcation was outlined in the
papers [ACh 75, 76, 01] by Akivis and Chakmazyan.
5.2.3 Normalization of Varieties of Aﬃne and Euclidean Spaces.
An aﬃne space An diﬀers from a projective space Pn by the fact that in An
a hyperplane at inﬁnity P∞is ﬁxed. If we place the points Ai, i = 1, . . . , n,
of our moving projective frame into this hyperplane, then the equations of
inﬁnitesimal displacement of the moving frame take the form (1.81),

(5.88)
Consider a variety X of dimension r in the aﬃne space An. The tangent
space Tx(X) intersects the hyperplane at inﬁnity P∞in a subspace Kx of
dimension r −1, Kx = Tx ∩P∞. Thus, for a normalization of X, it is suﬃ-
cient to assign only a family of ﬁrst normals Nx. If we place the points Aa,
a = 1, . . . , l, of our moving frame into the subspace Nx ∩P∞, and the points
Ap, p = l +1, . . . , n, into the subspace Kx, then equations (5.87) take the form

pq is the second fundamental tensor of the variety X. Equations (5.72)
also preserve their form:

but equations (5.71) become

Thus lpq = 0, and the equation of the focus hypersurface Fx ⊂Nx preserves
its form (5.74):
det(y0δp

As to equation (5.75) of the focus hypercone Φx, by (5.92), this equation takes

Induced Connections on Submanifolds

As was the case in the projective space, the vanishing of tensor of normal
curvature Ra
bst is equivalent to the complete integrability of the system deﬁning
the distribution ∆y = y ∧Kx, where y ∈Nx. But in the aﬃne space, the
elements ∆y of this distribution are parallel to the subspace Tx(X).
As a
result, a variety X ⊂An has a ﬂat normal connection if and only if this
variety admits an l-parameter family of parallel varieties X(y), where y ∈Nx.
Further consider a variety X of dimension r in the Euclidean space En. On
X, both the second normal Kx = Tx ∩P∞and the ﬁrst normal Nx orthogonal
to the tangent subspace Tx(X) are naturally deﬁned.
In the Euclidean space En, there is deﬁned a scalar product of vectors, and
a scalar product of points in the hyperplane at inﬁnity P∞is induced by the
scalar product in En. Because in our moving frame, we have Aa ∈Nx ∩P∞;
Ap ∈Tx ∩P∞= Kx, a = 1, . . . , l; p = l + 1, . . . , n; and Tx ⊥Nx, we ﬁnd that
(Aa, Ap) = 0,
(5.97)
where, as usually, the parentheses denote the scalar product of points in the
hyperplane at inﬁnity P∞. In addition, we set
(Aa, Ab) = gab, (Ap, Aq) = gpq,
(5.98)
where gab and gpq are nondegenerate symmetric tensors.
Diﬀerentiating equations (5.97) and using formulas (5.89), (5.97) and (5.98),
we ﬁnd that
gab ωb
p + gpq ωq
a = 0.
It follows that
ωp
a = −gpq gab ωb
q.
(5.99)
Equations (5.99) and (5.90) imply that
ωp
a = −gpq gac bc
qsωs.
(5.100)
Comparing (5.100) and (5.91), we obtain
cp
as = −gpq gac bc
qs.
(5.101)
Now we ﬁnd the equation of the focus hypersurface Fx of the variety
X ∈En. By (5.93) and (5.101), we have the following equation for Fx:
det(y0δp
q −yagpsgacbc
sq) = 0.
The last equation is equivalent to the equation
det(y0gpq −yaba
pq) = 0,
(5.102)

206

where ya = gabyb.
In our moving frame, the hyperplane at inﬁnity P∞is determined by the
equation y0 = 0.
Hence by (5.102), the intersection Fx ∩P∞of the focus
hypersurface Fx with the hyperplane at inﬁnity P∞is deﬁned by the equation
det(yaba
pq) = 0.
(5.103)
But this equation diﬀers only in notation from equation (5.94) of the focus
hypercone Φx of the variety X.
Equations (5.94) and (5.103) coincide if
ξa = ya = gabyb.
This means that the focus hypercone Φx of the variety
X ⊂En is formed by the hyperplanes ξ containing the tangent subspace Tx
and orthogonal at the points y of the hyperplane at inﬁnity P∞lying in the
intersection Fx ∩P∞.
This result clariﬁes the geometric meaning of the focus hypercone Φx for
the variety X ⊂En and its relation with the focus hypersurface Fx of X.
We also ﬁnd the curvature tensor of the aﬃne connection induced on the
variety X ⊂En.
Substituting the values of cp
aq from (5.101) into formula
(5.95), we ﬁnd that
Rp
qst = gpugac(ba
qtbc
us −ba
qsbc

(5.104)
Contracting equation (5.104) with the tensor gpv and changing the summation
indices (if necessary), we ﬁnd that
Rpqst = gac(ba

qs),
(5.105)
where Rpqst = gpuRu
qst. Formulas (5.104) and (5.105) give the usual expressions
for the curvature tensor of the aﬃne connection induced on a normalized variety
X ⊂En.
But in addition to the curvature tensor of the aﬃne connection induced
on a normalized variety X ⊂En, we considered also the tensor Ra
bst of nor-
mal curvature deﬁned by equation (5.96). Substituting the values of cp
aq from
(5.101) into formula (5.96), we ﬁnd that

Algebras
5.3.1 Two-Dimensional Algebras and Their Representations. There
are three known two-dimensional algebras: the algebra of complex numbers
z = x + iy, where i2 = −1; the algebra of double (or split complex) numbers
z = x + ey, where e2 = 1; and the algebra of dual numbers z = x + εy, where
ε2 = 0. Here everywhere x, y ∈R. Usually these three algebras are denoted by
C, C1, and C0, respectively (see Rosenfeld [Ro 97], §1.1). These algebras are
commutative and associative, and any two-dimensional algebra is isomorphic
to one of them.
Each of these three algebras admits a representation by means of the real
(2 × 2)-matrices:
z = x + iy →

(5.109)
In what follows, we will identify the algebras C, C1, and C0 with their matrix
representations.
The algebras C, C1, and C0 are subalgebras of the complete matrix algebra

The algebra C does not have zero divisors while the algebras C1, C0, and M

for the algebra C0 the form x = 0, and for the algebra M the form

1 = 0.
(5.111)
The elements of the algebras C1 and C0, as well as the regular complex
numbers (the elements of the algebra C), can be represented by the points on
the plane xOy. In this representation, the zero divisors of the algebra C1 are
represented by the points of the straight lines y = ±x, and the zero divisors of
the algebra C0 by the points of the y-axis.
The elements of the algebra M are represented by the points of a four-
dimensional vector space, and its zero divisors by the points of the cone (5.111)
whose signature is (2, 2). Thus, to the algebra M, there corresponds a four-
dimensional pseudo-Euclidean space E4

5.3.2 The Projective Planes over the Algebras C, C1, C0, and M.
Denote by A one of the algebras C, C1, C0, or M and consider a projective
plane AP2 over the algebra A (see Bourbaki [Bou 70]). A point Y ∈AP2 has
three matrix coordinates Y 0, Y 1, Y 2 that have, respectively, the form (5.107),
(5.108), (5.109), or (5.110). Because it is convenient to write point coordinates
as a column-matrix, we write
Y = (Y 0, Y 1, Y 2)T .
(5.113)
The matrix Y in (5.113) has six rows and two columns. Of course, the columns
of this matrix must be linearly independent. The coordinates Y α, α = 0, 1, 2,
are deﬁned up to a multiplication from the right by an element P of the algebra
A, which is not a zero divisor. So we have Y ′ ∼Y P, P ∈A.
In particular, for Y ∈CP2, Y ∈C1P2, and Y ∈C0P2, we have

respectively.
The columns of the matrix Y can be considered as coordinates of the points
y0 and y1 of a real projective space RP5, and to the matrix Y there corresponds
the straight line y0 ∧y1 in the space RP5. So we can set Y = y0 ∧y1. The set
of all straight lines of the space RP5 forms the Grassmannian RG(1, 5), whose
dimension is equal to eight, dim RG(1, 5) = 2 · 4 = 8.
Note that RG(1, 5) is a diﬀerentiable manifold. Thus, AP2 is also a diﬀer-
entiable manifold over R.
5.3.3 Equation of a Straight Line. A straight line U in the plane AP2
is deﬁned by the equation
U0Y 0 + U1Y 1 + U2Y 2 = 0,
where Uα ∈A, α = 0, 1, 2. The coordinates Uα admit a multiplication from
the left by an element P ∈A, which is not a zero divisor.
In general, two skewed straight lines in RP5 correspond to two points Y, Z ∈
AP2. These straight lines deﬁne a subspace RP3 corresponding to the unique
straight line in AP2 passing through the points Y and Z.
Two points Y and Z are called adjacent if more than one straight line
passes through them in AP2. To such points, there correspond intersecting
straight lines y0 ∧y1 and z0 ∧z1 in RP5. Through adjacent points Y, Z ∈AP2,
there passes a two-parameter family of straight lines in AP2, because through
a plane RP5, there passes a two-parameter family of subspaces RP3 ⊂RP5.
If
Y = (Y 0, Y 1, Y 2)T , Z = (Z0, Z1, Z2)T
are adjacent points, then the rank of the (6×4)-matrix composed of the matrix
coordinates of Y and Z is less than four. If the rank of this matrix is four,
then through the points Y and Z, there passes a unique straight line.
On a plane AP2 there are three basis points E0, E1, E2 with coordinates
E0 = (E, 0, 0)T , E1 = (0, E, 0)T , E2 = (0, 0, E)T ,
where E =

1

is the unit matrix, and 0 is the 2 × 2 zero-matrix. A
point Y ∈AP2 can be represented in the form
Y = E0Y 0 + E1Y 1 + E2Y 2.
(5.114)
However, as we noted earlier, the coordinates Yα of this point admit a multi-
plication from the right by an element P ∈A, which is not a zero divisor.
A point Y is in general position with the straight line Eα∧Eβ, α, β = 0, 1, 2,
if and only if its coordinate Y γ, γ ̸= α, β, is not a zero divisor.
Let, for

210
5. Further Examples and Applications
example, a point Y be in general position with the straight line E1 ∧E2. Then
its coordinate Y 0 is not a zero divisor, and all its coordinates can be multiplied
from the right by (Y 0)−1. Then expression (5.114) of the point Y takes the
form
Y = E0 + E1 Y 1 + E2 Y 2,
(5.115)
where Y 1 = Y 1(Y 0)−1, Y 2 = Y 2(Y 0)−1. Now the (4 × 2)-matrix (Y 1, Y 2)T
is deﬁned uniquely and is called the matrix coordinate of the point Y as well
as of the straight line y0 ∧y1 deﬁned in the space RP5 by the point Y (see
Rosenfeld [Ro 97], Section 2.4.1, and also Rosenfeld [Ro 66], Chapter 3, §3).
For the plane MP2, the matrix coordinate has eight real components. Hence
dim MP2 = 8.
Because dim MP2 = dim RG(1, 5), the plane MP2 can be
bijectively mapped onto the Grassmannian RG(1, 5).
For the planes CP2, C1P2, and C0P2, the matrix coordinates of points have
four real components. Hence the real dimension of these planes is four,
dim CP2 = dim C1P2 = dim C0P2 = 4.
Therefore, the family of straight lines y0 ∧y1 in the space RP5 for each of these
planes depends on four parameters, i.e., it forms a congruence in the space
RP5. We denote these congruences by K, K1, and K0, respectively.
5.3.4 Moving Frames in Projective Planes over Algebras. A moving
frame in a projective plane over an algebra A is a triple of points Aα, α = 0, 1, 2,
that are mutually not adjacent. Any point Y ∈AP2 can be written as
Y = A0Y 0 + A1Y 1 + A2Y 2,
where Y α ∈A are the coordinates of this point with respect to the frame
{A0, A1, A2}. The coordinates of a point Y are deﬁned up to a multiplication
from the right by an element P of the algebra A that is not a zero divisor. If a
point Y is in general position with the straight line A1∧A2, then its coordinate
Y 0 is not a zero divisor. Thus, the point Y can be written as
Y = A0 + A1 Y 1 + A2 Y 2,
where Y 1 = Y 1(Y 0)−1, Y 2 = Y 2(Y 0)−1. The matrix (Y 1, Y 2)T is the matrix
coordinate of the point Y with respect to the moving frame {Aα}, and this
matrix coordinate is deﬁned uniquely.
The plane AP2 admits a representation on the Grassmannian RG(1, 5)
formed by the straight lines of the space RP5.
Under this representation,
the straight lines
A0 = a0 ∧a1, A1 = a2 ∧a3, A2 = a4 ∧a5
(5.116)

5.3
Smooth Lines on Projective Planes over Two-Dimensional Algebras 211
in RP5 correspond to the vertices of the frame {Aα}; here ai, i = 0, . . . , 5, are
points of the space RP5.
The equations of inﬁnitesimal displacement of the moving frame {A0, A1, A2}
have the form
dAα = AβΩβ
α, α, β = 0, 1, 2,
(5.117)
where Ωβ
α are 1-forms over the algebra A. In the representation of the algebra
A by (2 × 2)-matrices, these forms are expressed as the transposed matrices
(5.107), (5.108), (5.109), and (5.110). Their entries are not the numbers. They
are real 1-forms:
Ωβ
α =

ω2β
2α
ω2β+1
2α
ω2β
2α+1
ω2β+1
2α+1

.
(5.118)
Thus, for the plane CP2, the entries of the matrix Ωβ
α satisfy the equations
ω2β
2α = ω2β+1
2α+1, ω2β+1
2α
= −ω2β
2α+1,
(5.119)
for the plane C1P2 the equations
ω2β
2α = ω2β+1
2α+1, ω2β+1
2α
= ω2β
2α+1,
(5.120)
and for the plane C0P2 the equations
ω2β
2α = ω2β+1
2α+1, ω2β
2α+1 = 0.
(5.121)
If the frame {Aα} moves in the plane AP2, then the points ai ∈RP5 also
move. The equations of inﬁnitesimal displacement of the moving frame {ai}
can be written in the form
dai = ajωj
i , i, j = 0, 1, . . . , 5,
(5.122)
where by (5.116) the forms ωj
i coincide with the corresponding forms (5.118).
The forms ωi
j satisfy the structure equations of the projective space RP5:
dωi
j = −ωi
k ∧ωk
j ,
(5.123)
where d is the symbol of exterior diﬀerential, and ∧denotes the exterior mul-
tiplication of the linear diﬀerential forms (see Section 1.2.4).
5.3.5 Focal Properties of the Congruences K, K1, and K0. Now
we consider the congruences K, K1, and K0 of the space RP5, representing the
planes CP2, C1P2, and C0P2 in this space, and investigate their focal properties.
Theorem 5.8. The projective planes CP2, C1P2, and C0P2 admit a bijective
mapping onto the linear congruences K, K1, and K0 of the real space RP5.
These congruences are, respectively, elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic.

212
5. Further Examples and Applications
Proof. To each of these congruences, we associate a family of projective frames
in such a way that the points a0 and a1 are located on a moving straight line
of the congruence.
For the congruence K, equations of inﬁnitesimal displacement of the points
a0 and a1 can be written in the form



da0 = ω0
0a0 + ω1
0a1 + ω2
0a2 + ω3
0a3 + ω4
0a4 + ω5

da1 = −ω0
1a0 + ω0
0a1 −ω3
0a2 + ω2
0a3 −ω5
0a4 + ω4
0a5.
(5.124)
By (5.120), for the congruence K1, these two equations take the form



da0 = ω0
0a0 + ω1
0a1 + ω2
0a2 + ω3
0a3 + ω4
0a4 + ω5

da1 = ω1
0a0 + ω0
0a1 + ω3
0a2 + ω2
0a3 + ω5
0a4 + ω4
0a5.
(5.125)
Finally, by (5.121), for the congruence K0, these two equations take the form



da0 = ω0
0a0+ ω1
0a1 + ω2
0a2 +ω3
0a3 + ω4
0a4 +ω5
0a5,
da1 =
ω0
0a1
+ω2
0a3
+ω4
0a5.
(5.126)
Let x = a1 + λa0 be an arbitrary point of the straight line a0 ∧a1. This
point is a focus of this straight line if for some displacement, its diﬀerential dx
also belongs to this straight line.
Let us start from the congruence K1, because the focal images for this
congruence are real and look more visual. By (5.125), for this congruence we
have
dx ≡(ω3
0 + λω2
0)a2 + (ω2
0 + λω3
0)a3 + (ω5
0 + λω4
0)a4
+(ω4
0 + λω5
0)a5
(mod a0 ∧a1);
(5.127)
as a result, for its focus x, the following equations must be satisﬁed:



ω2
0 + λω3
0 = 0,
ω4
0 + λω5
0 = 0,
λω2
0 + ω3
0 = 0,

0 = 0.

Smooth Lines on Projective Planes over Two-Dimensional Algebras 213
It follows that the values λ = ±1 are double roots of this equation. Thus, each
line a0 ∧a1 of the congruence K1 has two double foci
f1 = a1 + a0, f2 = a1 −a0.
Equations (5.127) imply that the diﬀerentials of the focus f1 are expressed
only in terms of the points a0 + a1, a2 + a3, and a4 + a5. The diﬀerentials of
these points are expressed in terms of the same points. As a result, the plane
π1 = (a0 + a1) ∧(a2 + a3) ∧(a4 + a5)
remains ﬁxed when the straight line a0 ∧a1 describes the congruence K1 in
the space RP5. In a similar way, one can prove that the focus f2 describes the
plane
π2 = (a0 −a1) ∧(a2 −a3) ∧(a4 −a5).
Thus, the congruence K1 is a four-parameter family of straight lines of the
space RP5 intersecting its two planes π1 and π2 that are in general position.
Hence K1 is a hyperbolic line congruence.
In a similar way, we can prove that each straight line a0 ∧a1 of the con-
gruence K bears two double complex conjugate foci,
f1 = a1 + ia0, f2 = a1 −ia0,
and these foci describe two complex conjugate two-dimensional planes π1 and
π2, π2 = π1. Hence K is an elliptic line congruence in the space RP5. The
straight lines of K do not have real singular points in RP5.
Finally, consider the congruence K0 in the space RP5. We look for the foci
of its straight lines in the same form
x = a1 + λa0.
Diﬀerentiating this expression by means of (5.126), we ﬁnd that
dx ≡λω2
0a2 + (λω3
0 + ω2
0)a3 + λω4
0a4 + (λω5
0 + ω4

(mod a0 ∧a1).
Thus, the focus x must satisfy the following equations:

5. Further Examples and Applications
It follows that the value λ = 0 is a quadruple root of this equation. Thus, each
line a0 ∧a1 of the congruence K0 has a real quadruple singular point f = a1.
Applying equations (5.121), it is easy to prove that when the straight line a0∧a1
describes the congruence K0, this focus describes the plane π = a1 ∧a3 ∧a5.
Hence K0 is a parabolic line congruence.
5.3.6 Smooth Lines in Projective Planes. On a projective plane AP2,
where A is one of the algebras C, C1, and C0, consider a smooth point sub-
manifold Γ of real dimension three. A line Γ of the plane AP2 is called an
A-smooth line if at any of its points Y , the tangent space TY (Γ) coincides with
a straight line U ⊂AP2 corresponding to the projective plane passing through
Y .
With an A-smooth line Γ, we associate a family of projective frames
{A0, A1, A2} in such a way that A0 = Y and A1 lies on the tangent U to
the line Γ at the point Y . Then on the line Γ, the ﬁrst of equations (5.117)
takes the form
dA0 = A0Ω0
0 + A1Ω1
0.
(5.130)
It follows that A-smooth lines on a plane AP2 are deﬁned by the equation
Ω2
0 = 0.
(5.131)
The 1-form Ω1
0 in equation (5.130) deﬁnes a displacement of the point A0 along
the curve Γ. So this form is a basis form on Γ.
By equations (5.118), we have
Ω1

line Γ ⊂AP2, the following diﬀerential equations will be satisﬁed:
ω4
0 = 0, ω5
0 = 0.
(5.132)
These equations are equivalent to equations (5.131).
Because Ω1
0 is a basis form on the line Γ ⊂AP2, the real forms ω2
0 and
ω3
0 are linearly independent. The families of straight lines in the space RP5
corresponding to these lines depend on two parameters and form a real three-
dimensional ruled variety X3 ⊂RP5. The varieties X3 belong to the congru-
ences K, K1, and K0 if Γ ⊂CP2, Γ ⊂C1P2, and Γ ⊂C0P2, respectively.

5.3
Smooth Lines on Projective Planes over Two-Dimensional Algebras 215
Theorem 5.9. The tangent subspace Tx(X3) to the ruled variety X3, cor-
responding in the space RP5 to a smooth line in the planes CP2, C1P2, and
C0P2, is ﬁxed at all points of its rectilinear generator L, and the variety X3 is
a submanifold with a degenerate Gauss map of rank r ≤2.
Proof. Consider a rectilinear generator L = a0 ∧a1 of the variety X3. By
(5.132), the diﬀerentials of the points a0 and a1 have the form



da0 = ω0
0a0 + ω1
0a1 + ω2
0a2 + ω3
0a3,
da1 = ω1
0a0 + ω1
1a1 + ω2
1a2 + ω3
1a3.
(5.133)
It follows that at any point x ∈a0∧a1, the tangent subspace Tx(X3) belongs to
a three-dimensional subspace RP3 ⊂RP5 deﬁned by the points a0, a1, a2, and
a3. Thus, the subspace Tx(X3) remains ﬁxed along the rectilinear generator
L = a0 ∧a1, and X3 is a variety with a degenerate Gauss map of rank r ≤2.
5.3.7 Singular Points of Varieties Corresponding to Smooth Lines
in the Projective Spaces over Two-Dimensional Algebras.
We prove the following theorem.
Theorem 5.10. Consider three-dimensional varieties X3 with degenerate
Gauss maps of rank r ≤2 in the space RP5 corresponding to smooth lines
in the projective planes CP2, C1P2, and C0P2 over the algebras of complex,
double, and dual numbers. For the algebra C, such a variety does not have
real singular points, for the algebra C1, such a variety is a join formed by the
straight lines connecting the points of two plane curves that are in general po-
sition, and for the algebra C0, such a variety is a subfamily of the family of
straight lines intersecting a plane curve. In all these cases, the general solution
of the system deﬁning a variety X3 depends on two functions of one variable.
Proof. A rectilinear generator L = a0 ∧a1 of a variety X3 of rank two bears
two foci. Let us ﬁnd these foci for the varieties X3 corresponding to the lines
Γ in the planes CP2, C1P2, and C0P2. We assume that these foci have the form
x = a1 + λa0.
If a line Γ ⊂C1P2, then equations (5.127) and (5.133) are satisﬁed. They
imply that
dx ≡(ω3
0 + λω2
0)a2 + (ω2
0 + λω3
0)a3
(mod a0 ∧a1),
and for the focus x, we have
ω3
0 + λω2
0 = 0, ω2
0 + λω3
0 = 0.

216
5. Further Examples and Applications
This system is consistent if and only if

1
λ
λ
1
 = 0,
i.e., if λ = ±1.
Thus, the foci of the straight line a0 ∧a1 are the points
a1 + a0 and a1 −a0. These points belong to the focal planes π1 and π2 of the
congruence K1 and describe lines Γ1 and Γ2. Such varieties X3 were called
joins (see Example 2.6 in Section 2.4). Because each of the lines Γ1 and Γ2
on the planes π1 and π2 is deﬁned by means of one function of one variable, a
variety X3 depends on two functions of one variable. The same result could be
obtained by applying the Cartan test (see the book [BCGGG 90] by Bryant,
Chern, Gardner, Goldsmith, and Griﬃths) to the system of equations (5.132).
If a line Γ ⊂CP2, then we can prove that a rectilinear generator L = a0∧a1
of the ruled variety X3 corresponding to Γ bears two complex conjugate foci
belonging to complex conjugate focal planes π1 and π2 = π1 of the congruence
K. Hence in the real space RP5, the variety X3 does not have real singular
points.
In the complex plane π1, the focus f1 can describe an arbitrary diﬀerentiable
line. But such a line is deﬁned by means of two functions of one real variable.
Therefore, in this case the variety X3 also depends on two functions of one
real variable.
Finally, consider a variety X3 ⊂RP5 corresponding to a line Γ ⊂C0P2.
Such a variety is deﬁned in RP5 by diﬀerential equations (5.121) and (5.132).
Using the same method, we can prove that a rectilinear generator L = a0 ∧a1
of the ruled variety X3 corresponding to Γ bears a double real focus f = a1
belonging to the focal plane π of the congruence K0 and describing in this
plane an arbitrary line.
We prove that in this case a variety X3 is also deﬁned by two functions of
one variable. But now in order to prove this, we apply the Cartan test.
Taking exterior derivatives of equations (5.132) and applying equations
(5.121), we obtain the following exterior quadratic equations:
ω2
0 ∧ω4
2 = 0, ω2
0 ∧ω5
2 + ω3
0 ∧ω4
2 = 0.
(5.134)
It follows from (5.134) that
ω4
2 = pω2
0, ω5
2 = qω2
0 + pω3
0.
(5.135)
We apply the Cartan test to the system of equations (5.132), (5.134), and
(5.135). In addition to the basis forms ω2
0 and ω3
0, equations (5.134) contain
two more forms ω4
2 and ω5
2. Thus, we have q = 2. The number of independent

5.3
Smooth Lines on Projective Planes over Two-Dimensional Algebras 217
equations in (5.134) is also 2, i.e., s1 = 2. As a result, s2 = q −s1 = 0, and
the Cartan number
Q = s1 + 2s2 = 2.
Equations (5.135) show that the number S of parameters on which the general
two-dimensional integral element depends is also 2, S = 2. Because Q = S, the
system of equations (5.132) is in involution, and its general solution depends
on two functions of one variable.
5.3.8 Curvature of Smooth Lines over Algebras.
Diﬀerentiating
equation (5.131) deﬁning a smooth line Γ in the plane AP2, where A =
C, C1, C0, and applying Cartan’s lemma, we obtain
Ω2
1 = RΩ1
0,
(5.136)
where R ∈A. The quantity R is called the curvature of the line Γ ⊂AP2.
For a line Γ in the plane C1P2, in formula (5.136) we have
Ω1
0 =

ω2


, R =

p

,
and det R = p2 −q2. If rank R = 2, then the quantity R is not a zero divisor,
and the rank of the ruled variety X that corresponds in RP5 to the line Γ, is
also equal to two. If rank R = 1, then R is a zero divisor, R ̸= 0, and the
rank of the variety X is equal to one. Finally, if R = 0, then a line Γ is a
straight line in the plane C1P2, and the variety X corresponding to Γ in RP5
is a subspace RP3.
For a line Γ in the plane CP2, in formula (5.136) we have
Ω1

Thus, det R = p2 + q2, and two cases are possible: rank R = 2 and rank R =
0.
In the ﬁrst case, a variety X ⊂RP5 of rank two without singularities
corresponds to the line Γ ⊂CP2, and in the second case, the line Γ is a
straight line in the plane CP2.
For a line Γ in the plane C0P2, in formula (5.136) we have

and det R = p2. If p ̸= 0, then rank R = 2, and the curvature R is not a
zero divisor.
If p = 0, q ̸= 0, then rank R = 1, and the curvature R is a

218
5. Varieties Associated with Associative Algebras
nonvanishing zero divisor. If p = q = 0, then R = 0. The rank of a variety X
corresponding in RP5 to a line Γ ⊂C0P2 is equal to the rank of R. If R = 0,
then the line Γ is a straight line in the plane C0P2.
Thus, we have proved the following result.
Theorem 5.11. The rank of the ruled variety X corresponding in RP5 to a
smooth line Γ ⊂AP2, where A = C, C1, C0, is equal to the rank of the curvature
of this line. For A = C, this rank can be two or zero, and for A = C1, C0, the
rank can be two, one, or zero.
NOTES
5.1. The geometry of lightlike hypersurfaces on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds
of diﬀerent signatures was the subject of many journal papers and even two books:
[DB 96] by Duggal and Bejancu and [Ku 96] by Kupeli.
On applications of the theory of lightlike hypersurfaces to physics see, for example,
[Ch 83] by Chandrasekhar and [MTW 73] by Misner, Thorpe, and Wheeler.
Akivis and Goldberg in [AG 98b, 98c] studied the geometry of the de Sitter space
Sn+1
1
using its connection with the geometry of the conformal space. They proved
that the geometry of lightlike hypersurfaces of the space Sn+1
1
is directly connected
with the geometry of hypersurfaces of the conformal space Cn. The latter was studied
in detail in the papers of Akivis (see, for example, his paper [A 52]) and in the book
[AG 96] by Akivis and Goldberg. This simpliﬁes the study of lightlike hypersurfaces
of the de Sitter space Sn+1
1
and makes possible to apply for their consideration the
apparatus constructed in the conformal theory.
In this section we follow the paper [AG 98c], namely, its parts in which the authors
proved that a lightlike hypersurface has a degenerate Gauss map and where singular
points of such hypersurfaces are investigated.
5.2. See more details on the geometry of normalized submanifolds and on con-
struction of invariant intrinsic normalizations of submanifolds in the projective space
Pn in the book Akivis and Goldberg [AG 93], Chapters 6 and 7.
On the normal connection see the paper [AG 95] and the book [AG 93] (Section
6.3) by Akivis and Goldberg.
On varieties with a ﬂat normal connection in an aﬃne space and a Euclidean
space see the papers [ACh 75, 76, 01] by Akivis and Chakmazyan, where the au-
thors indicated the ways to construct a classiﬁcation of varieties with a ﬂat normal
connection.
Another relation of the theory of varieties with degenerate Gauss maps and the
theory of normalized varieties was established in Theorem 4 of the paper [Cha 78]
by Chakmazyan (see also p. 39 of his book [Cha 90]).
5.3. The theory of projective planes over algebras is the subject belonging to the
geometry and the algebra, and this subject attracts the attention of both algebraists
and geometers. This theory was considered in Pickert’s book [Pi 75], and in the

Notes
219
separate chapters of the books of Bourbaki (see [Bou 70]) and Rosenfeld (see [Ro 66,
97]).
However, not so much was known about the diﬀerential geometry of such projec-
tive planes. Some questions in this direction were considered in the paper [A 87b] by
Akivis. In that paper the author studied smooth lines in projective planes over the
matrix algebra and some of its subalgebras. In this study he used the mapping of the
projective plane MP2 over the algebra M of (n × n)-matrices onto the Grassmannian
G(n −1, 3n −1) of subspaces of dimension n −1 of a real projective space RP3n−1.
It is proved in [A 87b] by Akivis that in the projective plane MP2 over the algebra
M of (2×2)-matrices, there are no smooth lines diﬀerent from straight lines. A family
of straight lines in RP5 corresponding to those straight lines is the Grassmannian
G(1, 3) of straight lines lying in a three-dimensional subspace RP3 of the space RP5.
See more details on the plane MP2 and its mapping onto the Grassmannian
G(n−1, 3n−1) of (n−1)-planes of a real projective space P3n−1 of dimension 3n−1
in the paper [Ve 86] by Veselyaeva.
For description of the algebra C of complex numbers, the algebra C1 of double
numbers, and the algebra C0 of dual numbers, see, for example, Paige [Pa 63], Schafer
[Sc 66], or Rosenfeld [Ro 97].
In our exposition we follow the paper [AG 03a] by Akivis and Goldberg.
The examples we have constructed in this section are of the same nature as
Ishikawa’s examples in [I 99a], but they are much simpler.
