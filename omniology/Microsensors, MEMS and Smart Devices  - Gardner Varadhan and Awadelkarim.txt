The miniaturisation of sensors has been made possible by advances in the technolo-
gies originating in the semiconductor industry, and the emergent field of microsensors
has grown rapidly during the past 10 years. The term microsensor is now commonly
used to describe a miniature device that converts a nonelectrical quantity, such as pres-
sure, temperature, or gas concentration, into an electrical signal. This book basically
reports on the recent developments in, firstly, the miniaturisation of a sensor to produce a
microsensor; secondly, the integration of a microsensor and its microelectronic circuitry
to produce a so-called smart sensor; and thirdly, the integration of a microsensor, a
microactuator, and their microelectronic circuitry to produce a microsystem.
Many of the microsystems being fabricated today employ silicon microtechnology and
are called microelectricalmechanical systems or MEMS in short. Consequently, the first
part of this book concentrates on the materials and processes required to make different
kinds of microsensors and MEMS devices. The book aims to make the reader familiar
with these processes and technologies. Of course, most of these technologies have been
derived from those currently employed in the semiconductor industry and so we also
review the standard microelectronics technologies used today to produce silicon wafers,
process them into discrete devices or very large-scale integrated circuits, and package
them. These must be used when the microelectronics is being integrated to form either
a hybrid device, such as a multichip module (MCM), or a fully integrated device, such
as a smart sensor. We then describe the new techniques that have been developed to
make microsensors and microactuators, such as bulk and surface silicon micromachining,
followed by the emerging technology of microstereolithography that can be used to form
true three-dimensional micromechanical structures.
The reader is now fully prepared for our description of the different types of microsen-
sors made today and the way in which they can be integrated with the microelectronics
to make a smart device (e.g. an electronic eye, electronic nose, or microtweezers) or
integrated with a microactuator to make a microsystem. Several of these chapters have
been dedicated to the important topic of IDT microsensors, that is, surface acoustic wave
devices that possess an interdigital transducer and so can be used to sense a wide variety
of signals from mechanical to chemical. This type of microsensor is attractive, not only
because it offers both high sensitivity and compatibility with the microelectronics industry
but also because it can be operated and even powered by a wireless radio frequency link.
The latter overcomes the initial constraints of communicating with small, low energy
budget, and even mobile MEMS - now referred to as micromachines!

PREFACE
Our aim has been to write a book that serves as a text suitable both for an advanced
undergraduate course and for a master's programme. Some of the material may well be
familiar to students of electrical engineering or electronics. However, our comprehensive
treatment will make it equally familiar to mechanical engineers, physicists, and materials
scientists.
We have provided more than 10 appendices to aid the reader and serve as a source of
reference material. These appendices explain the key abbreviations and terms used in the
book, provide suggestions for further reading, give tables of the properties of materials
important in microsensors and MEMS, and finally provide a list of the web sites of major
journals and active institutions in this field. In addition, this book is aimed to be a valuable
reference text for anyone interested in the field of microsensors and MEMS (whether they
are an engineer, a scientist, or a technologist) and the technical references at the end of
each chapter will enable such readers to trace back the original material.
Finally, much of the material for this book has been taken from short courses prepared
by the authors and presented to students and industrialists in Europe, North America, and
the Far East. Their many valuable comments have helped us to craft this book into its
final form and so we owe them our thanks. The authors are also grateful to many of their
students and colleagues, in particular Professor Vasundara V. Varadan, Dr. K. A. Jose,
Dr. P. Xavier, Mr. S. Gangadharan, Mr. William Suh, and Mr. H. Subramanian for their
valuable contributions.

Introduction
1.1 HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF
MICROELECTRONICS
The field of microelectronics began in 1948 when the first transistor was invented.
This first transistor was a point-contact transistor, which became obsolete in the 1950s
following the development of the bipolar junction transistor (BJT). The first modern-
day junction field-effect transistor (JFET) was proposed by Shockley (1952). These two
types of electronic devices are at the heart of all microelectronic components, but it
was the development of integrated circuits (ICs) in 1958 that spawned today's computer
industry.
1C technology has developed rapidly during the past 40 years; an overview of the
current bipolar and field-effect processes can be found in Chapter 4. The continual
improvement in silicon processing has resulted in a decreasing device size; currently,
the minimum feature size is about 200 nm. The resultant increase in the number of
transistors contained within a single 1C follows what is commonly referred to as Moore's
law. Figure 1.1 shows that in just 30 years the number of transistors in an 1C has risen
from about 100 in 1970 to 100 million in 2000. This is equivalent to a doubling of
the number per chip every 18 months. Figure 1.1 plots a number of different common
microprocessor chips on the graph and shows the clock speed rising from 100 kHz to
1000 MHz as the chip size falls. These microprocessors are of the type used in common
personal computers costing about €1000 in today's prices1.
Memory chips consist of transistors and capacitors; therefore, the size of dynamic
random access memories (DRAM) has also followed Moore's law as a function of time.
Figure 1.2 shows the increase of a standard memory chip from 1 kB in 1970 to 512 MB
in 2000. If this current rate of progress is maintained, it would be possible to buy for
€1000 a memory chip that has the same capacity as the human brain by 2030 and a
memory chip that has the same brain capacity as everyone in the whole world combined
by 2075! This phenomenal rise in the processing speed and power of chips has resulted
first in a computer revolution and currently in an information revolution. Consequently,
the world market value of ICs is currently worth some 250 billion euros, that is, about
250 times their processing speed in hertz.
1 euro (€) is currently worth about 1 US dollar.

1.2 EVOLUTION OF MICROSENSORS
The microelectronics revolution has led to increasingly complex signal-data proces-
sing chips; this, remarkably, has been associated with falling costs. Furthermore, these
processing chips are now combined with sensors and actuators2 to make an information-
processing triptych (see Figure 1.3). These developments follow the recognition in the
2 A sensor is a device that normally converts a nonelectrical quantity into an electrical quantity; an actuator is
the converse. See Appendix C for the definition of some common terms.

1980s that the price-to-performance ratio of both sensors and actuators had fallen woefully
behind processors. Consequently, measurement systems tended to be large and, more
importantly, expensive. Work therefore started to link the microelectronic technologies
and use these to make silicon sensors, the so-called microsensors.
Working definition of the term sensor:
'A microsensor is a sensor that has at least one physical dimension at the submillimeter
level.'
This work was inspired by the vision of microsensors being manufactured in volumes at low
cost and with, if necessary, integrated microelectronic circuitry. Chapters 5 and 6 describe
in some detail the silicon micromachining technologies used today to make microsensors
and microactuators. An overview of the field of microsensors is given in Chapter 8.
Figure 1.4 shows the relative market for ICs and microsensors in the past 10 years.
It is evident that the market for microsensors lags well behind the market for ICs;
nevertheless, it is worth 15 to 20 billion euros. The main cause has been the relatively
stable price-performance (p/p) ratio of sensors and actuators since 1960, as illustrated in
Figure 1.5. This contrasts markedly with the p/p ratio of ICs, which has fallen enormously
between 1960 and 2000 and is now significantly below that for sensors and actuators. As a
consequence of these changes, the cost of a measurement system is, in general, dominated
first by the cost of the microactuator and second by the cost of the microsensor.
However, despite the cost advantages, there are several major technical advantages of
making microsensors with microsystems technology (MST); the main ones are as follows:

The UK marketplace for microsensors is diverse, as shown in Figure 1.6, and includes
processing plants - environment and medical. However, the largest sector of the world
(rather than UK) sensor market3 is currently automotive; in 1997, the sales of pressure

sensors was about 700 million euros and that for accelerometers was about 200 million
euros (see Tables 8.10 and 8.11).
As the market for automotive sensors has matured, the price has fallen from €100 to
€10 for a pressure sensor. In addition, the sophistication of the chips has increased and
so has the level of integration. How this has led to the development of 'smart' sensors is
discussed in Chapter 15.
Working definition of the term smart sensor:
'A smart sensor is a sensor that has part or its entire processing element integrated in a
single chip.'
1.3 EVOLUTION OF MEMS
The next ambitious goal is to fabricate monolithic or integrated chips that can not
only sense (with microsensors) but also actuate (with microactuators), that is, to create
a microsystem that encompasses the information-processing triptych. The technology
employed to make such a microsystem is commonly referred to as MST. Figure 1.7
provides an overview of MST together with some of the application areas. Work to
achieve this goal started in the late 1980s, and there has been enormous effort to fabricate
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) using MST.
Working definition of the term MEMS:
'A MEMS is a device made from extremely small parts (i.e. microparts).'
Early efforts focused upon silicon technology and resulted in a number of successful
micromechanical devices, such as pressure sensors and ink-jet printer nozzles. Yet, these
are, perhaps, more accurately described as devices rather than as MEMS. The reason

INTRODUCTION
Figure 1.8 Some of the many fundamental techniques required to make MEMS devices. From
Fatikow and Rembold (1997)
for the relatively slow emergence of a complete MEMS has been the complexity of the
manufacturing process. Figure 1.8 details some new materials for MEMS and the various
microtechnologies that need to be developed.
In Chapter 3, some of the new materials for MEMS have been introduced and their
fundamental properties have been described. One attractive solution to the development
of MEMS is to make all the techniques compatible with silicon processing. In other
words, conventional complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) processing is
combined with a pre-CMOS or post-CMOS MST. Because of the major significance
of this approach, Chapters 12 to 14 have been dedicated to the topic of interdigitated
transducers (IDTs) and their use in microsensors and MEMS devices.
The present MEMS market is relatively staid and mainly consists of some simple
optical switches for the communications industry, pressure sensors, and inertia! sensors
for the automotive industry, as shown in Figure 1.9. This current staidness contrasts with
the potential for MEMS, which is enormous. Table 1.1 is taken from a recent report
on the world market for MEMS devices. The major growth areas were identified as
microfluidics and photonics and communications. However, there have been some exciting

developments in methods to fabricate true three-dimensional structures on the micron
scale. Chapter 7 describes the technique of microstereolithography and how it can be
used to make a variety of three-dimensional microparts, such as microsprings, microgears,
microturbines, and so on.
There are two major challenges facing us today: first, to develop methods that will
manufacture microparts in high volume at low cost and, second, to develop microassembly
techniques. To meet these challenges, certain industries have moved away from the use
of silicon to the use of glasses and plastics, and we are now seeing the emergence of
chips in biotechnology that include microfluidic systems (Chapter 15), which can truly
be regarded as MEMS devices.
1.4 EMERGENCE OF MICROMACHINES
Natural evolution will then lead to MEMS devices that move around by themselves.
Such chips are commonly referred to as micromachines and the concepts of microplanes,
microrobots, microcars, and microsubmarines have been described by Fujimasa (1996).
Figure 1.10 shows the scales involved and compares them with the size of a human flea!
Micromachines, if developed, will need sophisticated microsensors so that they can
determine their location and orientation in space and proximity to other objects. They
should also be able to communicate with a remote operator and hence will require a
wireless communication link - especially if they are asked to enter the human body.
Wireless communication has already been realised in certain acoustic microsensors, and

MEMS devices are described in Chapters 13 and 14. Associated with this development,
there is a further major problem to solve, namely, miniaturisation of a suitable power
source. Moving a micromachine through space requires significant energy. If it is to then
do something useful, such as removing a blood clot in an artery, even more power will
be required. Consequently, the future of MEMS devices may ultimately be limited by the
communication link and the size of its 'battery pack!'
The road to practicable micromachines appears to be long and hard but the first steps
toward microsensors and MEMS devices have been taken, and this book provides an
overview of these initial steps.

Electronic Materials and
Processing
2.1 INTRODUCTION
Integrated circuit (1C) processing is a mature technology for the fabrication of electronic
devices and systems. Steady advances in 1C fabrication technology have been the basis
for the microelectronic revolution, starting with the first discrete germanium transistors in
the 1950s to the 64-MB dynamic random access memories (DRAMs) of today. The main
purpose of this chapter is to introduce the reader to the basic terminology and to provide a
basic overview of the processing steps required to process silicon wafers. Therefore, this
chapter begins with the introduction of a special group of materials that may be referred
to as electronic materials. These materials are commonly used in conventional 1C tech-
nologies and some of them are used as microelectromechanical system (MEMS) materials
(see following chapter). Electronic materials have no common physical or chemical prop-
erties: for instance, their electrical properties span the range from near-ideal insulators to
excellent conductors, and their chemical composition may consist of one atom in simple
materials to several atoms in compound electronic materials. Therefore, the term elec-
tronic materials has no physical or chemical meaning; it solely describes materials used
in IC fabrication.
A more detailed discussion of conventional silicon IC processing is presented in
Chapter 4, which describes the additional steps required to package electronic chips. There
are also a number of excellent textbooks that describe in full the processing of conven-
tional electronic IC chips, such as microprocessors and DRAMs (for further information
see Sze (1985, 1988); Fung et al. (1985)).
2.2 ELECTRONIC MATERIALS AND THEIR
DEPOSITION
Many different kinds of bulk materials and thin films are used in the fabrication of ICs. The
bulk materials are predominantly semiconducting. The most important semiconductors in
IC fabrication are silicon and gallium arsenide. There are four important thin-film materials
(or class of materials) in IC fabrication:

10 
ELECTRONIC MATERIALS AND PROCESSING
1. Thermal silicon oxide
2. Dielectric layers
3. Poly crystalline silicon (poly-Si)
4. Metal films (predominantly aluminum)
The dielectric layers include deposited silicon dioxide (SiO2) (sometimes referred to
as oxide) and silicon nitride (Si3N4). These dielectrics are used for insulation between
conducting layers, for diffusion and ion-implantation masks, and for passivation to protect
devices from impurities, moisture, and scratches. Poly-Si is used as a gate electrode in
metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) devices, as a conductive material for multilevel metalli-
sation, and as a contact material for devices with shallow junctions. Metal films are used
to form low-resistance ohmic connections, both to heavily doped n+/p+ regions and to
poly-Si layers, and rectifying (nonohmic) contacts in metal semiconductor barriers.
The thermal oxide is usually a better-quality oxide (compared with deposited oxide) and
is used for the gate oxide layers in field-effect transistors (FETs). A detailed description
of FET devices and their electrical characteristics is given in Chapter 4.
As shall become apparent in the following chapters, electronic materials are of major
importance in MEMS devices. Therefore, the methods used for growing thermal SiOa and
for depositing dielectric poly-Si and metallic layers are reviewed in the following sections.
2.2.1 Oxide Film Formation by Thermal Oxidation
Thermal oxidation is the method by which a thin film of SiO2 is grown on top of a silicon
wafer. It is the key method of producing thin SiO2 layers in modern IC technology. The
basic thermal oxidation apparatus is shown in Figure 2.1. The apparatus comprises a
resistance-heated furnace, a cylindrical fused quartz tube that contains the silicon wafers
held vertically in slotted quartz boat, and a source of either pure dry oxygen or pure water
vapour. The loading end of the furnace tube protrudes into a vertical flow hood, wherein
a filtered flow of air is maintained. The hood reduces dust in the air that surrounds the
wafers and minimises contamination during wafer loading.
Figure 2.1 Basic furnace arrangement for the thermal oxidation of silicon wafers

Thermal oxidation of silicon in oxygen or water vapour can be described by the
following two chemical reactions:
900- 1200°C
Si (solid) + O2 (gas) 
> SiO2 (solid)
(2.1)
and
900- 1200 °C
Si (solid) + 2H2O (gas) 
SiO2 (solid) + 2H2 (gas) 
(2.2)
The silicon-silicon dioxide interface transverses the silicon during the oxidation process.
Using the densities and molecular weights of silicon and SiO2, it can be shown that
growing an oxide of thickness x consumes a layer of silicon that is 0.44x thick.
The basic structural unit of thermal SiO2 is a silicon atom surrounded tetrahedrally by
four oxygen atoms, as shown in Figure 2.2(a). The silicon-oxygen and oxygen-oxygen
interatomic distances are 1.6 and 2.27 A, respectively. SiO2 or silica has either a crystalline
structure (e.g. quartz in Figure 2.2(b)) or an amorphous structure (Figure 2.2(c)). Typi-
cally, amorphous SiO2 has a density of ~2.2 gm/cm3, whereas quartz has a density of
~2.7 gm/cm3. Thermally grown oxides are usually amorphous in nature.
Oxidation of silicon in a high-pressure atmosphere of steam (or oxygen) can produce
substantial acceleration in the growth rate and is often used to grow thick oxide layers.
One advantage of high-pressure oxide growth is that oxides can be grown at significantly
lower temperatures and at acceptable growth rates.
2.2.2 Deposition of Silicon Dioxide and Silicon Nitride
There are three deposition methods that are commonly used to form a thin film on a
substrate. These methods are all based on chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and are as
follows:
Figure 2.2 Atomic structure of (a) single unit of thermal oxide; (b) regular array of quartz; and
(c) disordered array of amorphous SiO2

12 
ELECTRONIC MATERIALS AND PROCESSING
1. Atmospheric pressure chemical vapour deposition (APCVD)
2. Low-pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD)
3. Plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD)
The latter method is an energy-enhanced CVD method. The appropriate method from
among these three deposition methods is determined by the substrate temperature, the
deposition rate and film uniformity, the morphology, the electrical and mechanical prop-
erties, and the chemical composition of the dielectric films.
A schematic diagram of a typical CVD system is shown in Figure 2.3; the only excep-
tion is that different gases are used at the gas inlet. Figures 2.3(a) and (b) show a LPCVD
reactor and PECVD reactor, respectively. In Figure 2.3(a), the quartz tube is heated by
a three-zone furnace and gas is introduced (gas inlet) at one end of the reactor and is
pumped out at the opposite end (pump). The substrate wafers are held vertically in a
slotted quartz boat. The type of LPCVD reactor shown in Figure 2.3(a) is a hot-wall
LPCVD reactor, in which the quartz tube wall is hot because it is adjacent to the furnace;
this is in contrast to a cold-wall LPCVD reactor, such as the horizontal epitaxial reactor
that uses radio frequency (RF) heating. Usually, the parameters for the LPCVD process
in the reaction chamber are in the following ranges:
1. Pressure between 0.2 and 2.0 torr
2. Gas flow between 1 to 10 cm3/s
3. Temperatures between 300 and 900 °C
Figure 2.3(b) shows a parallel-plate, radial-flow PECVD reactor that comprises a vacuum-
sealed cylindrical glass chamber. Two parallel aluminum plates are mounted in the
chamber with an RF voltage applied to the upper plate while the lower plate is grounded.
The RF voltage causes a plasma discharge between the plates (electrodes). Wafers are
placed in the lower electrode, which is heated between 100 and 400 °C by resistance
heaters. Process gas flows through the discharge from outlets that are located along the
circumference of the lower electrode.

CVD is used extensively in depositing SiO2, Si3N4, and polysilicon. CVD SiO2 does
not replace thermally grown SiO2 that has superior electrical and mechanical properties as
compared with CVD oxide. However, CVD oxides are instead used to complement thermal
oxides and, in many cases, to form oxide layers that become much thicker in relatively
short times than do thermal oxides. SiO2 can be CVD-deposited by several methods. It
can be deposited by reacting silane and oxygen at 300 to 500 °C in an LPCVD reactor
wherein

dichlorosilane can be used as follows:

(2.4)
A property that relates to CVD is known as step coverage. Step coverage relates the surface
topography of the deposited film to the various steps on the semiconductor substrate.
Figure 2.4(a) shows an ideal, or conformal, film deposition in which the film thickness is
uniform along all surfaces of the step, whereas Figure 2.4(b) shows a nonconfonnal film
(for a discussion of the physical causes of uniform or nonuniform thickness of deposited
films, see Fung et al. (1985)).
Table 2.1 compares different SiO2 films deposited by different methods and contrasts
them with thermally grown oxides. Similarly, Si3N4 can be LPCVD-deposited by an
intermediate-temperature process or a low-temperature PECVD process. In the LPCVD
process, which is the more common process, dichlorosilane and ammonia react according
to the reaction

2.2.3 Polysilicon Film Deposition
Polysilicon is often used as a structural material in MEMS. Polysilicon is also used in
MEMS for electrode formation and as a conductor or as a high-value resistor, depending
on its doping level. A low-pressure reactor, such as the one shown in Figure 2.3(a),
operating at temperatures between 600 and 650 °C is used to deposit poly silicon by
pyrolysing silane according to the following reaction:
SiH4
600°C
Si + 2H2
(2.6)
The most common low-pressure processes used for polysilicon deposition are the ones
that operate at pressures between 0.2 and 1.0 torr using 100 percent silane. Another
process for polysilicon deposition involves a diluted mixture of 20 to 30 percent silane
in nitrogen.
The properties of electronic materials are summarised in Appendices F (metals) and
G (semiconductors), and some of the properties of common electronic materials used in
MEMS are summarised in Table 2.2.
2.3 PATTERN TRANSFER
2.3.1 The Lithographic Process
Lithography is the process of imprinting a geometric pattern from a mask onto a thin
layer of material called a resist, which is a radiation-sensitive material. Figure 2.5 shows

16 
ELECTRONIC MATERIALS AND PROCESSING
Figure 2.5 Basic steps in a lithographic process used to fabricate a device
schematically the lithographic process that is used to fabricate a circuit element. First,
a resist is usually spin-coated or sprayed onto the wafers and then a mask is placed
above it. Second, a selected radiation (see Figure 2.5) is transmitted through the 'clear'
parts of the mask. The circuit patterns of opaque material1 (mask material) block some
of the radiation. The radiation is used to change the solubility of the resist in a known
solvent.
The pattern-transfer process is accomplished by using a lithographic exposure tool
that emits radiation. The performance of the tool is determined by three properties:
resolution, registration, and throughput. Resolution is defined as the minimum feature
size that can be transferred with high fidelity to a resist film on the surface of the
wafer. Registration is a measure of how accurately patterns of successive masks can
be aligned with respect to the previously defined patterns on a wafer. Throughput is
the number of wafers that can be exposed per hour for a given mask level. Depending
on the resolution, several types of radiation, including electromagnetic (e.g. ultraviolet
(UV) and X rays) and paniculate (e.g. electrons and ions), may be employed in
lithography.
Optical lithography uses UV radiation (A ~ 0.2-0.4 urn). Optical exposure tools are
capable of approximately 1 um resolution, 0.5 urn registration, and a throughput of 50
to 100 wafers per hour. Because of backscattering, electron-beam lithography is limited
to a 0.5 um resolution with 0.2 um registration. Similarly, X-ray lithography typically
has 0.5 um resolution with 0.2 um registration. However, both electron-beam and X-ray
1 The circuit pattern may be defined alternatively by the transparent part, depending on the choice of resist
polarity and film process (see later).

17
lithographies require complicated masks. The vast majority of lithographic equipment
used for IC fabrication is optical equipment. Optical lithography uses two methods for
imprinting the desired pattern on the photoresist. These two methods are shadow printing
and projection printing.
In shadow printing, the mask and wafer are in direct contact during the optical
exposure (contact printing is shown in Figure 2.6(a)) or are separated by a very
small gap g that is on the order of 10 to 50 urn (proximity printing is shown in
Figure 2.6(b)).
The minimum line width (Lmin) that can be achieved by using shadow printing is
given by
(2.7)
The intimate contact between the wafer and mask in contact printing offers the possibility
of very high resolution, usually better than 1 jam. However, contact printing often results
in mask damage caused by particles from the wafer surface that become attached to the
mask. These particles may end up as opaque spots in regions of the mask that are supposed
to be transparent.
Projection printing is an alternative exposure method in which the mask damage
problem associated with shadow printing is minimised. Projection printing exposure
tools are used to project images of the mask patterns onto a resist-coated wafer several
centimeters away from the mask (Figure 2.7). To increase resolution in projection
printing, only a small portion of the mask is exposed at a time. A narrow arc-shaped
image field, about 1 mm in width, serially transfers the slit image of the mask onto
the wafer. Typical resolutions achieved with projection printing are on the order of
1 urn.

2.3.2 Mask Formation
For discrete devices, or small-scale-to-medium-scale ICs (typically up to 1000 components
per chip), a large composite layout of the mask set is first drawn. This layout is a
hundred to a few thousand times the final size. The composite layout is then broken
into mask levels that correspond to the IC process sequence such as isolation region on
one level, the metallisation region on another, and so on. Artwork is drawn for each
masking level. The artwork is reduced to 10 x (ten times) glass reticule by using a
reduction camera. The final mask is made from the 10x reticule using a projection
printing system.
The schematic layout of a typical mask-making machine is shown in Figure 2.8. It
consists of the UV light source, a motorised x-y stage sitting on a vibration-isolated
table, and optical accessories. The operation of the machine is computer-controlled. The
information that contains the geometric features corresponding to a particular mask is
electrically entered with the aid of a layout editor system. The geometric layout is then
broken down into rectangular regions of fixed dimensions. The fractured mask data is
stored on a tape, which is transferred to the mask-making machine. A reticule mask plate,
which consists of one glass plate coated with a light-blocking material (e.g. chromium)
and a photoresist coating, is placed on the positioning stage. The tape data are then read
by the equipment and, accordingly, the position of the stage and the aperture of the shutter
blades are specified.
The choice of the mask material, just like radiation, depends on the desired resolution.
For feature sizes of 5 ^im or larger, masks are made from glass plates covered with a
soft surface material such as emulsion. For smaller feature sizes, masks are made from
low-expansion glass covered with a hard surface material such as chromium or iron

The method used for resist-layer formation is called spin casting. Spin casting is a process
by which one can deposit uniform films of various liquids by spinning them onto a wafer.
A typical setup used for spin casting is shown in Figure 2.9. The liquid is injected onto

the surface of a wafer, which is pressure-attached to a wafer holder through holes in the
holder that are connected to a vacuum line, and continuously pumped during the process.
The wafer holder itself is attached to and spun by a motor. The thickness jc of the spin-on
material is related to the viscosity n of the liquid and the solid content / in the solution
as well as the spin speed w:
nf
(2.8)
Typical spin speeds are in the range 1000–10000 rpm to give material thickness in the
range of 0.5 to 1 um. After the wafer is spin-coated with the resist solution, it is dried
and baked at temperatures in the range of 90 to 450 °C, depending on the type of the
resist. Baking is necessary for further drying of the resist and for strengthening the resist
adhesion to the wafer (Table 2.3).
A resist is a radiation-sensitive material that can be classified as positive or negative,
depending on how it responds to radiation. The positive resist is rendered soluble in a
developer when it is exposed to radiation. Therefore, after exposure to radiation, a positive
resist can be easily removed in the development process (dissolution of the resist in an
appropriate solvent, which is sometimes called the developer). The net effect is that the
patterns formed (also called images) in the positive resist are the same as those formed
on the mask (Figure 2.10). A negative resist, on the other hand, is rendered less soluble
in a developer when it is exposed to radiation. The patterns formed in a negative resist
are thus the reverse of those formed on the mask patterns (Figure 2.10). Table 2.4 lists a
few of the commercially available resists, the lithographic process, and their polarity (see
Table 4.3).

2.3.4 Lift-off Technique
The pattern-transfer technique, referred to as lift-off, uses a positive resist to form the resist
pattern on a substrate. The steps of the technique are shown in Figure 2.11. The resist is
first exposed to radiation via the pattern-carrying mask (Figure 2.11 (a)) and the exposed
areas of the resist are developed as shown in Figure 2.1 l(b). A film is then deposited over
the resist and substrate, as shown in Figure 2.11(c). The film thickness must be smaller
than that of the resist. Using an appropriate solvent, the remaining parts of the resist and
the deposited film atop these parts of the resist are lifted off, as shown in Figure 2.1 l(d).
The lift-off technique is capable of high resolution and is often used for the fabrication
of discrete devices.

2.4 ETCHING ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
Etching is used extensively in material processing for delineating patterns, removing
surface damage and contamination, and fabricating three-dimensional structures. Etching
is a chemical process wherein material is removed by a chemical reaction between the
etchants and the material to be etched. The etchant may be a chemical solution or a
plasma. If the etchant is a chemical solution, the etching process is called wet chemical
etching. Plasma-assisted etching is generally referred to as dry etching, and the term dry
etching is now used to denote several etching techniques that use plasma in the form of
low-pressure discharges.
2.4.1 Wet Chemical Etching
Wet chemical etching involves three principal steps:
1. The reactants are transported by diffusion2 to the surface to be etched.
2. Chemical reactions take place at the surface.
3. Reaction products are again transported away from the surface by diffusion.
2 Under some circumstances, reactions can be reaction-rate-limited rather than diffusion-rate-(mass-transport)
limited.

ETCHING ELECTRONIC MATERIALS 
23
Let us consider, as an example, etching of silicon. For silicon, the most commonly used
etchants are mixtures of nitric acid (HNOs) and hydrofluoric acid (HF) in water or acetic
acid (CH3COOH). Wet chemical etching usually proceeds by oxidation. Initially, silicon
is oxidised in the presence of holes as follows:
Si + 2H+ 
> Si2+ + H2 
(2.9)
Water dissociates according to the reaction
H2O 
> (OH)- +H+ 
(2.10)
The hydroxyl ions (OH)- recombine with positively charged silicon ions to form SiO2 in
two steps:
Si2+ + 
2(OH) 
> Si(OH)2 
(2.11)
and
Si(OH)2 
> SiO2 + H2 
(2.12)
SiO2 dissolves in HF acid according to the reaction
SiO2 + 6HF 
» H2SiF6 + 2H2O 
(2.13)
where H2SiFe is soluble in water. The reactions of (2.9) to (2.13) may be represented
with HNO3 by the following overall reaction:
Si + HNO3 + 6HF 
* H2SiF6 + HNO2 + H2O + H2 
(2.14)
The chemical solution used for gallium arsenide (GaAs) etching is a combination of
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) dissolved in water. Dielectrics and
metals are etched using the same chemicals that dissolve these materials in bulk form and
involve their conversion into soluble salts or complexes. Generally, film materials will
etch more rapidly than their bulk counterparts.
Etching processes are characterised by three parameters:
1. Etch rate
2. Etch selectivity
3. Etch uniformity
The etch rate is defined as the material thickness etched per unit time. Etch selectivity is a
measure of how effective the etch process is in removing the material to be etched without
affecting other materials or films present in the wafer. Quantitatively, etch selectivity can
be expressed as the ratio between the etch rate of the material to be etched and etch-mask
materials on the wafer. Table 2.5 lists the properties of different wet etchants for different
materials.
2.4.2 Dry Etching
The basic concept of dry or plasma etching is very simple. A glow discharge is used
to generate chemically reactive species (atoms, radicals, and ions) from a relatively inert

molecular gas. The etching gas is chosen so as to produce species that react chemically
with the material to be etched to form a reaction product that is volatile. The etch
product then desorbs from the etched material into the gas phase and is removed by
the vacuum pumping system. The most common example of the application of plasma
etching is in the etching of carbonaceous materials, for example, resist polymers, in
oxygen plasma - a process referred to as plasma ashing or plasma stripping. In this case,
the etch species are oxygen atoms and the volatile etch products are CO, CO2, and H2O
gases.
In etching silicon and silicon compounds, glow discharges of fluorine-containing
gases, such as CF4, are used. In this case, the volatile etch product is SiF4 and the
etching species are mainly fluorine atoms. In principle, any material that reacts with
fluorine atoms to form a volatile product can be etched in this way (e.g. W, Ta, C,
Ge, Ti, Mo, B, U, etc.). Chlorine-containing gases have also been used to etch some
of the same materials, but the most important uses of chlorine-based gases have been
in the etching of aluminum and poly-Si. Both aluminum and silicon form volatile
chlorides. Aluminum is not etched in fluorine-containing plasmas because its fluoride
is nonvolatile.
The characteristic of etching processes, which is becoming more and more important
as the lateral dimensions of the lithography become smaller, is the so-called directionality
(anisotropy) of the etch process. This characteristic is illustrated in Figure 2.12 in
which the lithographic pattern is in the x-y plane and the z-direction is normal to this
plane. If the etch rates in the x and y directions are equal to the etch rate in the z-
direction, the etching process is said to be isotropic (or nondirectional) and the shape
of the sidewall of the etched feature will be as shown in Figure 2.12(a). Etch processes
that are anisotropic or directional have etch rates in the z-direction and are larger than
the lateral (x or y) etch rates. The extreme case of directional etching in which the
lateral etch rate is zero (to be referred to here as vertical etch process) is shown in
Figure 2. 12(b).
Plasma etching, as described in the preceding discussion, is predominantly an isotropic
process. However, anisotropy in dry etching can be achieved by means of the chemical
reaction preferentially enhanced in a given direction to the surface of the wafer by
some mechanism. The mechanism used in dry etching to achieve etch anisotropy is ion
bombardment. Under the influence of an RF field, the highly energised ions impinge
on the surface either to stimulate reaction in a direction perpendicular to the wafer

surface or to prevent inhibitor species from coating the surface and hence reenhance
etching in the direction perpendicular to the wafer surface. Therefore, the vertical
sidewalls, being parallel to the direction of ion bombardment, are little affected by the
plasma.
Figure 2.13 is a schematic diagram of a planar etching system, which comprises
a vacuum chamber, two RF-powered electrodes, an etching gas inlet, and a pumping
mechanism. The planar systems are also called parallel-plate systems or surface loaded
systems. These systems have been used in two distinct ways: (1) the wafers are mounted
on a grounded surface opposite to the RF-powered electrode (cathode) or (2) the wafers
are mounted on the RF-powered electrode (cathode) directly. This latter approach has
been called reactive ion etching (RIE). In this approach, ions are accelerated toward
the wafer surface by a self-bias that develops between the wafer surface and the
plasma. This bias is such that positively charged ions are attracted to the wafer surface,
resulting in surface bombardment. It has been demonstrated that a planar etching system,
when operated in the RIE mode, is capable of highly directional and high-resolution
etching.
To illustrate the mechanisms involved in reactive ion etching, consider the example of
poly-Si etched in chlorine plasma:

2.5 DOPING SEMICONDUCTORS
When impurities are intentionally added to a semiconductor, the semiconductor is said
to be 'doped.' Figure 2.14 shows a hypothetical two-dimensional silicon crystal in which
one silicon atom is replaced (or substituted) by an atom - in this example, a Group V
element in the periodic table, namely, phosphorus. Phosphorus has five valence electrons,
whereas silicon has only four. The phosphorus atom shares four of its electrons with
four neighboring silicon atoms in covalent bonds. The remaining fifth valence electron in
phosphorus is loosely bound to the phosphorus nucleus.
The ionisation energy of an impurity atom of mass m in a semiconductor crystal can be
estimated from a one-electron model. If this ionisation energy is denoted by the symbol

where eo is the permittivity of free space, er is that of the semiconductor, and m* is
the effective electron mass in the semiconductor crystal. The energy En is discussed in
Section 3.1 of the following Chapter. When the phosphorus atom in silicon is ionised,
the released electron becomes a free electron that is available for conduction. The phos-
phorus atom is, hence, called a donor atom because it donates a free electron to the
crystal. All atoms with five valence electrons, that is, Group V elements, can behave in
a similar manner to phosphorus in silicon, that is, donate a free electron to the semicon-
ductor crystal. However, the amount of energy required, Ed, for this process to occur
may differ from one type of donor atom to another. All Group V atoms will donate
electrons if they substitute for host atoms in crystals of Group IV elemental semiconduc-
tors. Consequently, Group V elements, such as phosphorus or arsenic, are called donor
atoms or simply donors, and the doped semiconductor is now referred to as an extrinsic
semiconductor. This may be contrasted to an intrinsic (undoped) semiconducting material.
Now consider the introduction of a large concentration of phosphorus atoms in an
otherwise pure silicon crystal, for example, a phosphorus atom concentration of ~1015
cm-3. With a minimal energy supply, each of these phosphorus atoms will donate an
electron to the crystal, amounting to a concentration of electrons in the conduction band
on the order of 1015 cm-3 at room temperature. This concentration of electrons is to
be contrasted with the concentration of conduction electrons in intrinsic silicon at room
temperature, which is on the order of 1010 cm-3. Thus, with this doping level, a five-
order-magnitude increase in the free-electron concentration has been achieved. Note that
there are about 1022 to 1023 atoms/cm3 in a solid and that a doping level of 1015 cm-3
is equivalent to merely replacing one silicon atom in every 107 to 108 atoms/cm3 by a
phosphorus atom. Obviously, this level of doping introduces a very insignificant change
in the overall crystal structure but its effect on the free-electron concentration is clearly
very significant. Note that conduction in this phosphorus-doped silicon will therefore
be dominated by electrons. This type of extrinsic (Group IV) semiconductor, or more
specifically, silicon, is called an n-type semiconductor or n-type Si. The term n-type
indicates that the charge carriers are the negatively charged electrons. The example
discussed in the preceding text was specific to silicon doped with phosphorus; however,
the conclusion arrived at will apply generally to all elemental semiconductors doped with
a higher group element. The values of the ionisation energies Ed for several Group V
donors in silicon are given in Table 2.7 together with those for some acceptors.

Figure 2.15 
Hypothetical 2D silicon crystal doped with boron (p-type semiconductor)
Now consider the situation in which a Group IV semiconductor is doped with atoms
from an element in Group III of the periodic table, that is, atoms that have only three
valence electrons. To be more specific, let us take silicon doped with boron as an example,
as is shown in the hypothetical two-dimensional silicon lattice in Figure 2.15. As can be
seen from Figure 2.15, the net effect of having a boron atom that substitutes for silicon
is the creation of a free hole (an electron deficiency in a covalent bond). This hole
is generated as follows: because boron has three valence electrons, three neighbouring
silicon atoms will be bonded covalently with boron. However, the fourth nearest-neighbour
silicon atom has one of its four valence electrons sitting in a dangling bond; that is, the
whole system of the boron atom and the four neighbouring silicon atoms has one electron
missing. An electron from a neighbouring Si-Si covalent bond may replace the missing
electron, thereby creating an electron deficiency (a hole) at the neighbouring bond. The
net effect is, hence, the generation of a free hole in the silicon crystal. Therefore, this
type of extrinsic semiconductor, silicon in this particular example, is called a p-type
semiconductor or p-type Si. It is p-type because electrical conduction is carried out by
positively charged free holes. Common acceptor atoms to silicon are given in Table 2.7.
Diffusion and ion implantation are the two key processes used to introduce controlled
amounts of dopants into semiconductors. These two processes are used to dope selectively
the semiconductor substrate to produce either an n-type or a p-type region.

ELECTRONIC MATERIALS AND PROCESSING
2.5.1 Diffusion
In a diffusion process, the dopant atoms are placed on the surface of the semiconductor by
deposition from the gas phase of the dopant or by using doped oxide sources. Diffusion
of dopants is typically done by placing the semiconductor wafers in a furnace and passing
an inert gas that contains the desired dopant through it. Doping temperatures range from
800 to 1200°C for silicon. The diffusion process is ideally described in terms of Pick's
diffusion equation

where C is the dopant concentration, D is the diffusion coefficient, / is time, and x is
measured from the wafer surface in a direction perpendicular to the surface (Figure 2.16).
The initial conditions of the concentration C(x, 0) = 0 at time t = 0 and the boundary
conditions are that surface concentration C(0, t) = Cs at surface and that a semi-infinite
medium has C(oo, t) = 0. The solution of Equation (2.21) that satisfies the initial and
boundary conditions is given by
C(x, t) = Cserfc
(2.22)
where erfc is the complementary error function and the diffusion coefficient D is a function
of temperature T expressed as
D = D 0exp(—E a/kT) 
(2.23)
where Ea is the activation energy of the thermally driven diffusion process, k is
Boltzmann's constant, and DO is a diffusion constant. The diffusion coefficient is

Relationship between the diffusion coefficient and doping concentration of a charge
carrier in a semiconducting material
independent of dopant concentration when the doping concentration is low. However,
when the doping concentration exceeds some temperature-dependent characteristic value,
called the intrinsic carrier concentration [Ni(T)], the diffusion coefficient becomes
dependent on dopant concentration. When D is independent of dopant concentration, the
diffusion process is called intrinsic diffusion, whereas when D is dependent on the doping
concentration, the diffusion process is called extrinsic diffusion (Figure 2.17). In intrinsic
diffusion the dopant diffusion profiles are complementary error functions as given by
Equation (2.22); however, extrinsic diffusion profiles are somewhat complex and deviate
from the basic linear theory. Instead, more complex models or empirical lookup tables
are used to predict the diffusion depth.
The diffusion coefficients of commonly used dopants are considerably smaller in silicon
dioxide than in silicon. Hence, while doping silicon, silicon dioxide can be used as an
effective diffusion barrier or mask. Typical diffusion coefficients in the oxide at ~900 °C
are 3 x 10-19 cm2/s for boron and 10-18 cm2/s for phosphorus. This is to be contrasted
with diffusion coefficients at ~900 °C for the same dopants in silicon that are on the order
of 10-14 cm2/s.
2.5.2 Ion Implantation
Ion implantation is induced by the impact of high-energy ions on a semiconductor
substrate. Typical ion energies used in ion implantations are in the range of 20 to 200 keV

Figure 2.18 shows the schematics of a medium-current ion implanter. It consists of an
ion source, a magnet analyser, resolving aperture and lenses, acceleration tube, x- and
y-scan plates, beam mask, and Faraday cup. After ions are generated in the ion source,
the magnetic field in the analyser magnet is set to the appropriate value, depending on
charge-to-mass ratio of the ion, so that desired ions are deflected toward the resolving
aperture where the ion beam is collimated. These ions are then accelerated to the required
energy by an electric field in the acceleration tube. The beam is then scanned in the x-y
plane using the x- and y-deflection plates before hitting the wafer that is placed in the
Faraday cup.
Commonly implanted elements are boron, phosphorus, and arsenic for doping elemental
semiconductors, n- or p-type. After implantations, wafers are given a rapid thermal
anneal to activate electrically the dopants. Oxygen is also implanted in silicon wafers
to form buried oxide layers. The implanted ion distribution is normally Gaussian in
shape and the average projected range of ions is related to the implantation energy
(Figure 2.19).
2.6 CONCLUDING REMARKS
This chapter has introduced the topic of electronic materials and has described
some basic processing steps. The next chapter describes another important class
of materials, namely, those relating to the field of MEMS. These two chapters
should help acquaint the reader with the materials commonly used in both
microsensors 
and MEMS devices. Later chapters deal with more specialised
processing and fabrication techniques, such as bulk and surface micromachining and
stereomicrolithography.

3.1 OVERVIEW
Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) materials may be classified into five main types:
metals, semiconductors, ceramics, polymers, and composites. This chapter first introduces
the basic nature of each type of material and then discusses the different ways in which
they can be prepared. It also provides the reader with a brief overview of the underlying
physical structure of these materials and how they relate to their material properties1. More
advanced readers may wish to omit parts of this chapter as the details given here on the
preparation of electronic-grade silicon (EGS) are also presented in Chapter 4, Standard
Microelectronic Technologies, that discusses the central role of silicon processing within
the fields of microsensors and smart devices.
3.1.1 Atomic Structure and the Periodic Table
To understand the classification of materials, it is necessary to understand the quantum
mechanical structure of an atom and relate it to the nature of the macroscopic bulk
material. Every atom in an element is made up of a small, positively charged nucleus,
which is balanced in charge by the negatively charged electrons surrounding the nucleus.
The positive charge in the nucleus arises from nuclear particles called protons. Each
proton possesses a positive charge that is equal in magnitude to the negative charge
of an electron e, and in a neutral atom the number of protons in the nucleus is equal
to the number of electrons outside the nucleus. The number of electrons around the
nucleus, or the number of protons in the nucleus, of a neutral atom is equal to its atomic

If we consider a one-electron atomic model, such as that for hydrogen, then the energy
En of its single electron can only have values given by the following equation (Tuck and
Christopoulos (1986)):

where n is a positive nonzero integer, mc is the free-electron mass, e is its electronic
charge, h is the Planck's constant divided by 2n, and EQ is the permittivity of free
space2. These are the only allowed energy values for the electron. These energy levels
are characterised by the integer n, which is called the principal quantum number. These
levels, or the orbits corresponding to them, are called shells; shells corresponding to
n = 1, 2, 3,... , are labeled the K, L, M,... , shells, respectively, where the K shell is
the one nearest to the nucleus. Some shells have subshells determined by the angular
momentum of the electron in its orbit. We observe that these energy values are negative,
meaning that the electron is restricted to move close to the nucleus. Such an elec-
tron is generally referred to as a bound electron, that is, the electron is bound to the
nucleus. If this electron acquires energy from an external source such that its energy En
becomes equal to or greater than zero, then the electron frees itself from the nucleus
and is then called a free electron. As we shall see later, these free electrons are moving
charges and are therefore important in defining the properties of electronically conducting
materials.
The possible values of the orbital angular momentum for the electron in an atom are
given by [l(l + l)]1/2h, where the quantum number / takes the values / = 0, 1, 2, 3,... ,
(n — 1); that is, / < (n — 1). Here again, just as the energy of the electron in a one-
electron atom is quantised, so is its orbital angular momentum. The orbital quantum
number / governs the angular momentum of the electron. In an external magnetic field,
we also find that the possible (allowed) values of the z-component of the orbital angular
momentum are denoted by m, where the quantum number m is called the magnetic
quantum number. It is called as such because in the absence of a magnetic field, all
the states defined by mh have the same energy values, that is, the states are degen-
erate. However, the application of a magnetic field lifts the degeneracy and each of these
states would have a different energy. The value of m can only be an integer between
-/ and +/, that is, m is -/, (-/ + 1), (-/ + 2),..., 0, 1, 2 
(/ - 2), (/ - 1), / or
l < m < +l.
To sum up, while in a specific shell n, the electron can have any one of a number of
allowed orbital angular momenta characterised by the quantum number / = 0, 1, 2,... ,
(n — 1). These different / values correspond to different subshells, or orbitals, each
of angular momentum value of [l(l + l)]1/2h. Hence, although an electron occupies a
certain shell n of certain energy En, its orbital angular momentum can assume different
values. Within the same orbital, the projection of the angular momentum along the z-axis
can take certain values as described earlier. The quantum number for the z-component
of the angular momentum is m, where —l < m < +l. Therefore, at this point it can
be said that the state of the electron in a hydrogen atom is characterised by n, /,
and m.
So far, we have implied that the electronic distribution in an isolated atom can be
characterised by only three quantum numbers n, I, and m. However, in addition to orbital
angular momentum, it was found that each individual electron also has an intrinsic spin
angular momentum. The value of this spin angular momentum is characterised by the
quantum number 5 that assumes only one value — ^. The magnitude of this spin angular
momentum is [S(S + l)]1/2h = * 3 h / 2 and is called the total spin. Actually, the spin of
an electron in a magnetic quantum number has two states identified by the spin quantum

number ms, which takes two values +| and — |. Therefore, four quantum numbers n, l,
m, and ms are required for a complete description of the electronic states in an isolated
one-electron atom. The four quantum numbers are listed in Table 3.1 along with the
parameters that they represent and the limitations on the values of each of these quantum
numbers.
When an atom containing more than one electron is treated quantum mechanically, a
useful first-approximation is that the electrons do not exert forces on one another. Thus,
in this approximation, the states occupied by these electrons are still characterised by the
quantum numbers in Table 3.1. However, the arrangement of these electrons in the atom
satisfies Pauli's exclusion principle. This principle states that in a multielectron system no
two electrons can have identical sets of quantum numbers. Stated differently, the Pauli's
exclusion principle requires that no two electrons may have the same spatial distribution
and spin orientation and that no more than one electron may have the same wave function
when spin is included. Therefore, four quantum numbers n, I, m, and ms are required to
describe the exact state of an electron in an atom.
The lowest-energy, or ground-state, electron configuration for any atom can be
explained using the results summarised in Table 3.1 and the Pauli's exclusion principle.
The number of combinations of m and ms for a given subshell or orbital (n, /) gives the
maximum number of electrons in that subshell. For each value of /, there are (21 + 1)
values of m, and for each value of / and m, there are two values of ms (±1/2). Therefore,
the maximum number of electrons that can be placed in a given subshell, in accordance
with Pauli's exclusion principle, is 2(21 + 1). As stated earlier, the shells associated with
n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are labeled as the K, L, M, N, O, and P shells, respectively.
The orbitals associated with / — 0, 1, 2, and 3 are labeled as the s, p, d, and f orbitals,
respectively. The quantum number / specifies the shape of the envelope in which the
electron is likely to be found. Figure 3.1 shows the calculated (from quantum theory)
envelopes for s, p, and d electrons. In the case of s electrons, the envelope is spherical;
for p electrons, it is dumbbell-shaped; and for d electrons, it is clover-shaped in four cases
and dumbbell-shaped in one.
Using the results on the atomic structure outlined earlier, we can now proceed to set up
the periodic table of elements. The first few elements of the periodic table are shown in
Table 3.2. The first element is hydrogen with only one electron in the lowest energy state
defined by n = 1, l = 0, and m = 0. This configuration of the hydrogen atom is designated
as Is 1. The number 1 to the left stands for the shell n = 1, s specifies the orbital l = 0,

and the superscript 1 stands for the number of electrons occupying this state. Note that
the electron can take on spin quantum number of either +| or — ^, as the two spin states
have the same energy in the absence of magnetic field and are equally accessible to the
electron. The second element helium has two electrons that occupy the two lowest energy
states. These states are (n, l, m, ms) equal to (1, 0, 0, +-1) and (1, 0, 0, — |), that is, the
ground state of the helium atom can be labeled as 1s2. Note that for helium the lowest
shell (n = 1) is full. The chemical activity of an element is determined primarily by the
valence electrons that are electrons in the outermost unfilled shell. Because the valence
energy shell of helium is full, helium does not react with other elements and is an inert
element.
The third element lithium has three electrons, two of which will occupy the states
(n, l, m, ms) equal to (1, 0, 0, +5), (1, 0, 0, —|), and the third will occupy one of the
other eight states in the next shell with n = 2. From among these eight states, the third
electron in the lithium atom occupies one of the two states (2, 0, 0, +^) or (2, 0, 0, — |).
Therefore, the ground state configuration of lithium is written as 1s22s1.
In theory, we may continue to build up the periodic table following the method illus-
trated in the preceding discussion, as shown in Table 3.2. However, in practice, electrons
will start to interact with each other as the atomic number of the element increases. This
electron-electron interaction is not taken into account in the model that was presented
earlier for the atomic structure, and the buildup of the periodic table will, therefore, some-
what deviate from the predicted one. This deviation is shown in Table 3.3 and Figure 3.2,
which gives the energy scheme for the first six different shells and orbitals.
Proceeding in the same manner as described earlier, we can arrange the 105 or so
elements that are known to us presently to complete the periodic table, as shown in
Figure 3.3. In the periodic table, elements are arranged in horizontal rows in order of
atomic number. A new row is begun after each noble gas (e.g. He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe,
and Rn) is encountered. Notice that the elements in each vertical column have similar
properties. Also notice that the elements on the left-hand side of the diagonal dividing
band are metals, whereas those on the right-hand side are nonmetals. The elements within
the bands are semimetals, which are more commonly known as semiconductors.

3.1.2 Atomic Bonding
Materials are composed of elements that are connected to each other at the atomic level.
The connections between elements in a material are known as bonds. The properties and
applications of materials depend upon the nature and strength of the bond. There are

3.1.2.1 Ionic bonding
In ionic bonding, one element gives up its outer-shell electron(s) to uncover a stable inner
shell of eight electrons (resembling the nearest noble element). The electrons are attracted
to a second element in which they can serve to complete its outer shell of eight (again
resembling the nearest noble element). An example of ionic bonding is the sodium chloride
(NaCl) molecule in which the sodium atom donates its 3s1 electron, leaving an L shell of
eight (as in Ne), whereas the chlorine atom with an outer shell of seven (3s23p5), attracts
that electron to form an outer shell of eight (as in AT). As a result of this electron-transfer
process, two ions, Na+ and Cl~, are formed (see Figure 3.4).
The ions formed in an ionic bond are attracted by a coulombic force that is propor-
tional to the product of the charge on the ions and inversely proportional to the square of
their separation when the ions can be regarded as distinct points in space. However, when
the ions are close to one another, the force field changes and a repulsive force develops
between the electron fields. On the basis of these observations, a graph of potential energy
versus interatomic distance looks like the one shown in Figure 3.5. The minimum in the
curve corresponds to the equilibrium distance between the two ions.

OVERVIEW 
43
3.1.2.2 Covalent bonding
In covalent bonding, atoms share their outermost shell electrons to attain a stable group of
eight electrons. In the case of chlorine gas molecule (Cl2), one electron from each chlorine
atom is used to form a common covalent bond, whereby each atom is surrounded by a
stable group of eight electrons (Figure 3.6). This is called a molecular bond because
the stable molecule Cl2 is formed. The Cl2 molecular bond is pictorially depicted in
Figure 3.7, in which the merging of two of the 3p electron envelopes is shown. Instead
of drawing the entire ring, it suffices to only show the pair of shared electrons as two
dots or as a single line.
There are situations in which the covalent bonding becomes more complex than in a
simple molecular bond. The most important of these complex covalent bonds are those
associated with a tetrahedral structure, such as the methane (CH4) molecule. The atomic
structure of carbon is Is22s22p2. As CH4 is about to be formed, a two-process step occurs
within the carbon atom. First, one of the 2s electrons is promoted to a 2p state. The energy
required to achieve this first step is provided during the formation of the C—H bonds.
Next, the 2s electron and three 2p electrons hybridise to form a hybridised group of four
electrons with orbits along four evenly spaced tetrahedral axes (Figure 3.8). Four equal
C—H bonds are then formed to produce the tetrahedral structure of the CH4 molecule
(Figure 3.8).
3.1.2.3 Metallic bonding
In metallic bonding, encountered in pure metals and metallic alloys, the atoms give up
their outer-shell electrons to a distributed electron cloud for the whole block of metal (see

of metallic bonding, owing to the ability of a high concentration of electrons to move
freely, meaning that they possess a high mobility.
3.1.3 Crystallinity
Materials occur in either a crystalline or an amorphous state. The crystalline state refers to
the organisation of ~1022 atoms/cm3 arranged in a regular manner in a three-dimensional
structure. This regular array of atoms may be obtained by repeating in three dimensions an
elementary arrangement of building blocks called unit cells, which contain atoms placed
at fixed positions. If the periodic arrangement occurs throughout the volume of a sample
material, this constitutes a single crystal. However, if the regular structure occurs only
in portions of a material and the different portions are aligned arbitrarily with respect to
each other, the material is said to be polycrystalline. The individual regular portions are

OVERVIEW 
45
referred to as crystallites or grains and are separated from each other by grain boundaries.
If the individual crystallites are reduced in size to the point where they approach the size
of a unit cell, periodicity is lost and the material is called amorphous or glassy.
The geometric shape of a unit cell is a three-dimensional parallel-piped structure and
contains one or a few of the same3 atom in simple crystals such as copper, sodium, or
silver but may contain thousands of atoms in complex organic crystals. The length of an
edge of the unit cell is called the lattice constant. The variety of crystal structures can
be defined by arranging atoms systematically about a regular or periodic arrangement of
points in space called a space lattice. A lattice is defined by three fundamental translational
vectors a, b, and c, so that the arrangement of atoms in a crystal of infinite extent looks
identical when observed from any point that is displaced a distance r from an origin, as
viewed from the point R, where
R — r + n1a + n2b + 
n3C 
(3.2)
n1, n2, and n3 are integers. This is schematically shown in Figure 3.10. The points
described by the position vector R constitute the space lattice.
Parallel planes of atoms in a crystal are identified by a set of numbers called Miller
indices. These numbers can be obtained in the following way: choose the origin of the
coordinate system x, y, z to coincide with a lattice point in one of these parallel planes.
Find the intercepts of the next parallel plane on the x-, y-, and z-axes as x1, y1, and
Zi, respectively. Now take the reciprocals of these numbers and multiply by a common
factor so as to obtain the three lowest integers h, k, and l; these integers are called Miller
indices and are normally written within parentheses (h, k, /). An example of this method
for plane identification is shown in Figure 3.11. If one of the intercepts happens to be a
negative number, an overbar is added to the corresponding Miller index to indicate that
the plane intercepts with the negative axis.
A crystallographic direction in a crystal is denoted by a square-bracket notation [h, k, l].
The numbers h, k, and / correspond, respectively, to the x, y, and z components of a
vector that defines a particular direction. Again these numbers h, k, and / are the smallest
integers, the ratios for which are the same as those of the vector length ratios. An overbar
on any of the integers denotes a negative vector component on the associated axis. For
example, the direction of the negative x-axis is [1,0, 0], whereas the positive .x-axis is
denoted by the direction of [1,0,0].

tion vectors. A third unit cell vector c provides the third dimension (not shown)

Unit cell of a simple cubic (SC) crystal lattice structure
The following subsections describe some of the common crystal structures encountered
and those that are used to describe MEMS materials.
3.1.3.1 Cubic structures
The geometric shape of the unit cell in cubic structures is a cube. If a single atom or a
group of atoms are placed at the corners of the cube, this constitutes a simple cubic (SC)
crystal (Figure 3.12). Each one of the cube corners constitutes a site, or a lattice point,
which can be occupied by one building block (an atom or a group of atoms). Because
each corner of a given cube is shared by other seven cubes, it turns out that each unit
cell contains, in essence, one site or one lattice point in SC structure. In addition, in an

OVERVIEW
47
SC structure, each atom or a group of atoms at some lattice point is surrounded by six
nearest neighbours.
A second cubic crystal structure is the body-centred cubic (BCC). The BCC crystal
lattice not only contains a single site at each corner of the cube but also one at the
centre of the cubic cell, as shown in Figure 3.13. The number of nearest neighbours to
any particular lattice point in this case is eight. The third cubic structure is face-centred
cubic (FCC) lattice (see Figure 3.14), which contains one site in the centre of each of the
six cube faces in addition to the eight positions at the comers of the cube. The number
of nearest-neighbour sites to any given lattice point in this case is 12. Using arguments
similar to those used in SC structures, it is found that the number of lattice points in a
BCC and an FCC unit cell are two and four, respectively.
The conventional unit cell of diamond is basically cubic, as shown in Figure 3.15.
This structure is more loosely packed than the previously discussed cubic structures.

Figure 3.15 
Tetrahedral structure of carbon in its diamond state
Each carbon atom has four nearest neighbours forming a tetrahedral bond. This diamond
structure could be visualised as placing an atom at the centre of the cube, two atoms
at the opposite corners of the top face of this cube, and two atoms placed at opposite
corners at the bottom face of the cube, but twisted 90° with respect to the top-face atoms.
This configuration is shown in Figure 3.15, but it is not the unit cell. The tetrahedral
bonds of the four corner atoms to the central atom are very strong and highly directional,
occurring at angles of ~ 109.5°. In essence, the diamond structure can be viewed as two
interpenetrating FCC lattices - one displaced from the other by one-fourth the length and
along a cube diagonal. The diamond structure, which is a special type of cubic structure,
is of particular interest because some of the electronic materials (semiconductors) have
diamond-like crystal structures. Moreover, diamond itself has been used as a functional
material in microdevices.
3.1.3.2 Hexagonal close-packed structure
The hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure ranks in importance with the BCC and FCC
lattices; more than 30 elements crystallise in the HCP form. Underlying the HCP structure
is hexagonal lattice geometry (see Figure 3.16). To describe hexagonal structures, a few
simple modifications of the Miller indices of directions and planes are required. Instead
of three axes, x, y, and z, four axes are used - three in the horizontal (x, y) plane at
120° to each other, called a1, a2, a3, and the fourth, c, in the z-direction. The use of the
extra axis makes it easier to distinguish between similar planes in the hexagonal structure.
Figure 3.16 shows some planes located using this four-axes reference frame. Using either
three axes (a1, a2, and c) or four axes develops the notation for a direction. It is noted
that a\ and 02 are at 120° even in this instance. Figure 3.16 shows directions specified
using the three-coordinate system.
We have now reviewed all the necessary basic background information that will enable
us to describe different classes of materials. We broadly classify MEMS materials into five
categories: metals, semiconductors, ceramics, polymers, and composites. In the course of

METALS 
49
Figure 3.16 Hexagonal close-packed (HCP) crystal structure
discussing these different MEMS materials, several material-preparation techniques are
described. These techniques are described within different material sections according
to the frequency of their use in preparing the particular material under consideration.
However, it should be pointed out that several of the preparation techniques described in
the following sections are used to prepare more than one type of material. For instance,
the sputtering technique is described in the metals section; however, it is also used to
deposit semiconductor and ceramic films.
3.2 METALS
3.2.1 Physical and Chemical Properties
Metals are inorganic substances that are composed of one or more metallic elements.
Examples of metallic materials with one element are iron, aluminum, copper, and cobalt.
When a metallic material is composed of two or more metallic elements, it is called an
alloy. Some metallic materials may contain nonmetallic elements that are added inten-
tionally to improve the material's engineering qualities. An example of such a metallic
material is steel, in which the nonmetallic element carbon is added to iron. Metals and
alloys are commonly divided into two types: ferrous metals and alloys that contain high
concentrations of iron and nonferrous metals and alloys that contain no or very low
concentrations of iron.
Single-crystal metals are mostly found in the three simple types of cells: BCC, FCC, and
HCP. Under different conditions of temperature and pressure, different crystal structures
(that is, different unit cells) or phases for the same metal are formed. For example, a bar
of iron at room temperature has a BCC structure. However, if the bar is heated above
900 °C, the structure changes to FCC4. The BCC iron and the FCC iron are called the
a-phase and y-phase, respectively.
4 The phase change of a material is sometimes used as the sensing or actuating principle of a microdevice. One
example is a shape-memory alloy.

Metals are, in general, good thermal and electrical conductors. They are somewhat
strong and ductile at room temperature and maintain good strength both at room and
elevated temperatures. Table F.1 in Appendix F gives some important physical properties
of metals that are commonly used in microelectronics and MEMS.
Table 3.4 provides atomic and crystal structure information on 12 selected metals, and
these illustrate the three principal lattice structures described earlier.
3.2.2 Metallisation
Metallisation is a process in which metal films are formed on the surface of a substrate.
These metallic films are used for interconnections, ohmic contacts, and so on5. Metal
films can be formed using various methods, the most important being physical vapour
deposition (PVD). PVD is performed under vacuum using either the evaporation or the
sputtering technique.
3.2.2.1 Evaporation
Thin metallic films can be evaporated from a hot source onto a substrate, as shown in
Figure 3.17. An evaporation system consists of a vacuum chamber, pump, wafer holder,
crucible, and a shutter. A sample of the metal to be deposited is placed in an inert
crucible, and the chamber is evacuated to a pressure of 10-6 to 10-7 torr. The crucible
is then heated using a tungsten filament or an electron beam to flash-evaporate the metal
from the crucible and condense it onto the cold sample. The film thickness is determined

Figure 3.17 Schematic view of a thermal evaporation unit for depositing materials
by the length of time that the shutter is opened and can be measured using a quartz
microbalance (QMB)—based film thickness monitor. The evaporation rate is a function
of the vapour pressure of the metal. Therefore, metals that have a low melting point Tmp
(e.g. 660 °C for aluminum) are easily evaporated, whereas refractory metals require much
higher temperatures (e.g. 3422 °C for tungsten) and can cause damage to polymeric or
plastic samples. In general, evaporated films are highly disordered and have large residual
stresses; thus, only thin layers of the metal can be evaporated. In addition, the deposition
process is relatively slow at a few nanometres per second.
3.2.2.2 Sputtering
Sputtering is a physical phenomenon, which involves the acceleration of ions through
a potential gradient and the bombardment of a 'target' or cathode. Through momentum
transfer, atoms near the surface of the target metal become volatile and are transported as
a vapour to a substrate. A film grows at the surface of the substrate through deposition.
Figure 3.18 shows a typical sputtering system that comprises a vacuum chamber, a
sputtering target of the desired film, a sample holder, and a high-voltage direct current
(DC) or radio frequency (RF) power supply. After evacuating the chamber down to a
pressure of 10–6 to 10–8 torr, an inert gas such as helium is introduced into the chamber
at a few millitorr of pressure. A plasma of the inert gas is then ignited. The energetic
ions of the plasma bombard the surface of the target. The energy of the bombarding ions
(~keV) is sufficient to make some of the target atoms escape from the surface. Some

Basic components in a physical sputtering unit for depositing materials
of these atoms land on the sample surface and form a thin film. Sputtered films tend to
have better uniformity than evaporated ones, and the high-energy plasma overcomes the
temperature limitations of evaporation. Most elements from the periodic table, including
both inorganic and organic compounds, can be sputtered. Refractory materials can be
sputtered with ease, whereas the evaporation of materials with very high boiling points
is problematic. In addition, materials from more than one target can be sputtered at the
same time. This process is referred to as cosputtering.
The structure of sputtered films is mainly amorphous, and its stress and mechanical
properties are sensitive to specific sputtering conditions. Some atoms of the inert gas can
be trapped in the film, causing anomalies in its mechanical and structural characteristics.
Therefore, the exact properties of a thin film vary according to the precise conditions
under which it was made. Consequently, values given for the bulk material, such as those
given in Appendix F, serve only as an approximate guide to the film values.
3.3 SEMICONDUCTORS
3.3.1 Semiconductors: Electrical and Chemical Properties
Semiconductors are commonly inorganic materials made from elements in the fourth
column (Group IV) of the periodic table. The most important among these elements is
silicon that can be modified in several ways to change its electrical, mechanical, and
optical properties. The use of silicon in solid state and microelectronics has shown a
spectacular growth since the early 1970s, and this growth pattern is still continuing6. Other
6 Chapter 1 describes the recent emergence of microtechnologies.

SEMICONDUCTORS 
53
semiconductor materials, from Group IV elements in the periodic table, are germanium
and carbon (diamond). Semiconductor materials can also be made from a combination of
elements either from Group III and Group V or from Group II and Group VI. Examples of
these are gallium arsenide and zinc telluride materials. The name semiconductor is given
to these materials because at certain regimes of temperatures they are able to exhibit
good electrical conduction properties, and outside these temperature regimes they behave
as insulators7.
Semiconductor crystals can be made from both single elements and compounds. Semi-
conductors that are made from single elements are called elemental semiconductors.
Elemental semiconductors are found in Group IV of the periodic table, for example,
silicon (Si), and germanium (Ge). Compound semiconductors are made up of special
combinations either of Group III and Group V elements or of Group II and Group VI
elements, as stated earlier. Table 3.5 lists a few of the elemental and compound semicon-
ductors. Properties of some common elemental and compound semiconductors are given
in Appendix G.
Among the elemental semiconductors, silicon is by far the most commonly used mate-
rial. Silicon is the most important material for microelectronics and integrated circuit
technology. In addition, silicon-based compounds and technologies are becoming the
major cornerstones for the rapidly developing fields of MEMS and nanofabrication. For
this reason, we will be emphasising silicon and using it to demonstrate the general prop-
erties of semiconductor materials. Table 3.6 lists a few of the mechanical, electrical,
and thermal properties of single crystalline silicon. Gallium arsenide (GaAs) is the most
commonly used among the compound semiconductors, especially in fabricating optical
and high-speed devices.
The crystal structure of many semiconductors, including silicon and gallium arsenide,
is based on the cubic crystalline system8 (see Figure 3.15). Diamond itself could be

thought of as a semiconductor with a wide band gap of ~6 eV, and its structure is that
of two interleaved FCC arrays, in which one array is about a fraction of the interatomic
distance from the other. In the gallium arsenide-type of compound, one of the two arrays
is composed entirely of gallium atoms, whereas the other array is composed of arsenic
atoms. This particular class of the diamond structure is called the zinc-blende structure.
In the diamond lattice, each atom has four nearest neighbours. In both elemental and
compound semiconductors, there is an average of four valence electrons per atom. Each
atom is thus held in the crystal by four covalent bonds, wherein two electrons participate
in each bond. In a perfect semiconductor crystal and at absolute zero temperature, the
number of electrons available would exactly fill the inner atomic shells and the covalent
bonds. At temperatures above absolute zero, some of these electrons gain enough thermal
energy to break loose from these covalent bonds and become free electrons. Free electrons
are responsible for electrical conduction across the semiconductor crystal. Some of the
physical properties of selected semiconductor crystals are given in Table 3.6.
3.3.2 Semiconductors: Growth and Deposition
To demonstrate the methods of growing semiconductors, let us consider crystal growth
of silicon in detail. Silicon is used as an example because it is the most utilised semi-
conductor in microelectronics and MEMS. In fact, the next three chapters are devoted to
conventional silicon microtechnology (Chapter 4), bulk micromachining (Chapter 5), and
surface (Chapter 6) micromachining techniques.
Section 3.3.2.1 briefly outlines silicon crystal growth from the melt - a technique that
is widely used in growing bulk silicon wafers. This is followed by the epitaxial growth
of thin crystalline silicon layers in Section 3.3.2.2. A variation of the method for silicon
growth from the melt is the Bridgman technique that is used for growing gallium arsenide
wafers. The Bridgman technique is not discussed in this chapter (for a description of the
Bridgman technique see Tuck and Christopoulous (1986)). A more detailed description
of the way in which silicon wafers are made is given in Section 4.2. However, a brief
overview is presented in the following subsections.
3.3.2.1 Silicon crystal growth from the melt
Basically, the technique used for silicon crystal growth from the melt is the Czochralski
technique. The technique starts when a pure form of sand (SiO2) called quartzite is placed

in a furnace with different carbon-releasing materials such as coal and coke. Several
reactions take place inside the furnace and the net reaction that results in silicon is
SiC + SiO2
Si + SiO (gas) + CO (gas)
(3.3)
The silicon so produced is called metallurgical-grade silicon (MGS), which contains up
to 2 percent impurities. Subsequently, the silicon is treated with hydrogen chloride (HC1)
to form trichlorosilane (SiHCl3):
Si + 3HC1
SiHCl3 (gas) + H2 (gas)
(3.4)
is liquid at room temperature. Fractional distillation of the SiHCl3 liquid removes
impurities, and the purified liquid is reduced in a hydrogen atmosphere to yield electronic-
grade silicon (EGS) through the reaction
SiHCl3 + H
Si + 3HC1
(3.5)
EGS is a polycrystalline material of remarkably high purity and is used as the raw material
for preparing high-quality silicon wafers.
The Czochralski technique uses the apparatus shown in Figure 3.19 called the puller.
The puller comprises three main parts:
1. A furnace that consists of a fused-silica (SiO2) crucible, a graphite susceptor, a rotation
mechanism, a heating element, and a power supply.

2. A crystal pulling mechanism, which is composed of a seed holder and a rotation
mechanism.
3. An atmosphere control, which includes a gas source (usually an inert gas), a flow
control, and an exhaust system.
In crystal growing, the EGS is placed in the crucible and the furnace is heated above
the melting temperature of silicon. An appropriately oriented seed crystal (e.g. [100]) is
suspended over the crucible in a seed holder. The seed is lowered into the melt. Part of
it melts but the tip of the remaining seed crystal still touches the liquid surface. The seed
is then gently withdrawn. Progressive freezing at the solid-liquid interface yields a large
single crystal. A typical pull rate is a few millimeters per minute.
After a crystal is grown, the seed and the other end of the ingot, which is last to
solidify, are removed. Next, the surface is ground so that the diameter of the material
is defined. After that, one or more flat regions are ground along the length of the ingot.
These flat regions mark the specific crystal orientation of the ingot and the conductivity
type of the material (Figure 3.20). Finally, the ingot is sliced by a diamond saw into
wafers. Slicing determines four wafer parameters: surface orientation, thickness, taper
(which is the variation in the wafer thickness from one end to another), and bow (i.e.
surface curvature of the wafer, measured from the centre of the wafer to its edge). Typical
specifications for silicon wafers are given in Table 3.7.
3.3.2.2 Epitaxial growth
The method for growing a silicon layer on a substrate wafer is known as an epitaxial
process in which the substrate wafer acts as a seed crystal. Epitaxial processes are different

from crystal growth from the melt in that the epitaxial layer can be grown at a temperature
very much below the melting point. Among various epitaxial processes, vapour-phase
epitaxy (VPE) is the usual process for silicon layer growth.
A schematic of the VPE apparatus is shown in Figure 3.21. The figure shows a hori-
zontal susceptor made from graphite blocks. The susceptor mechanically supports the
wafer, and, being an induction-heated reactor, it also serves as the source of thermal
energy for the reaction.
Several silicon sources are usually used: silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4), dichloro-
silane (SiH2Cl2), trichlorosilane (SiHCl3), and silane (SiH4). Typical reaction temperature
for SiCl4 is ~1200°C. The overall reaction in the case of SiCl4 is reduction by hydrogen,
SiCl4 (gas) + 2H2 (gas) 
> Si (solid) + 4HC1 (gas)
A competing reaction that would occur simultaneously is
SiCl4 (gas) + Si (solid)
2SiCl2 (gas)
(3.6)
(3.7)
In reaction (3.6), silicon is deposited on the wafer, whereas in reaction (3.7), silicon is
removed (etched). Therefore, if the concentration of SiCl4 is excessive, etching rather
than growth of silicon will take place.
An alternative epitaxial process for silicon layer growth is molecular beam epitaxy
(MBE), which is an epitaxial process that involves the reaction of a thermal beam of silicon

MBE can achieve precise control in both chemical composition and impurity profiles
(if introduced intentionally). Single-crystal multilayer structures with dimensions on the
order of atomic layers can be made using MBE.
3.4 CERAMIC, POLYMERIC, AND COMPOSITE
MATERIALS
Ceramics are inorganic materials that consist of metallic and nonmetallic elements that
are chemically bonded together. Examples of these are alumina (Al2O3), salts, such as
sodium chloride (NaCl) and calcium fluoride (CaF2), and ceramic superconductors such
as YBa2Cu3O6.5.
Most ceramic materials, whether single-crystalline or noncrystalline (glass), have high
hardness and high-temperature strength but tend to be mechanically brittle. Several new
ceramic materials have been developed for engine applications; they are lightweight and
have high strength of hardness, good resistance to heat and wear, reduced friction, and
insulating properties9. These properties are highly desirable for engine applications. An
important application for ceramics is their use in tiles for the NASA space shuttle. These
ceramic tiles thermally protect the aluminum internal structure of the space shuttle during
ascent out of and reentry into the earth's atmosphere. Table 3.8 gives the structure and
uses of some selected engineering ceramics.
Polymers are materials that are organic (containing carbon) compounds, which have
long molecular chains or networks. Examples of polymeric materials include epoxies,
polyesters, nylons, and silicones. The strength and ductility of polymers vary greatly, and
because of their atomic structure, most polymers are poor electrical conductors. In fact,
some polymers are excellent insulators and are used in electrical insulation applications.
In general, polymers have low densities and relatively low softening or decomposition
temperatures. The physical properties of some common polymers are given in Table H.2
of Appendix H.
Because polymers are either long snakelike structures or three-dimensional random
networks, polymeric materials are usually noncrystalline. However, one may still find
some single-crystal polymers. Single-crystal properties are encountered only in linear

polymers and the single-crystallinity in these polymers is only partial. The develop-
ment of single-crystallinity is important because of its effects on mechanical, thermal,
and optical properties. The single-crystallinity in polymers is achieved by forming long
molecules such as chains of many thousands of carbon atoms by chemical reaction. On
cooling from liquid, these molecules bend back and forth to form individual crystals.
The application of these materials is discussed in various chapters in this book (for a
review on the use of polymers for electronics and optoelectronics, see Chilton and Goosey
(1995)).
The last type of MEMS material is a composite material, which is a combination of two
or more materials from the other four categories. Most composites consist of a selected
filler or reinforcing material and a compatible resin binder to obtain the desired material
characteristics. Usually, the component materials of a composite do not dissolve in one
another and are physically identifiable by an interface between the components.
Ceramic, polymer, and composite materials are important because they are often used as
passive materials in microsensors and MEMS devices. In other words, they are used either
to provide inert substrates or to form inert structures (e.g. shuttles) in micromechanical
devices. These materials are also used as active materials in microsensors and MEMS
devices; sometimes they are referred to as smart materials (Culshaw (1996)). An example
is the use of an electroactive polymer, such as polypyrrole, to make chemoresistive sensors
in an electronic nose (Gardner and Bartlett (1999)). Further details on such smart devices
are given in Chapter 15.

Standard Microelectronic
Technologies
4.1 INTRODUCTION
A large number of different microelectronic technologies exist today, and they are used for
making conventional microelectronic components, such as operational amplifiers, logic
gates, and microprocessors. Many technologies, and in some cases, all of a standard
process are used to fabricate the type of microdevices that are of interest to us here.
For example, a thermal microsensor can be made by using a standard bipolar process in
which, for instance, the forward voltage of a p-n diode (under constant current) or the
base-emitter voltage of an n-p-n transistor is proportional to the absolute temperature
(details may be found in Section 8.2.1). In this case, there is no significant difference
between the processing of a thermodiode and a conventional diode, although there will
be a difference in the device design and, perhaps, package. In most practical situations,
it is highly desirable to employ, wherever possible, the standard technologies and then
'bolt-on' one or more nonstandard pre- or postprocessing steps. The part or full integration
of standard microelectronics into a microsensor or microactuator is also often required
to enhance its functionality and, in doing so, make a so-called smart microtransducer1.
The degree of integration is a critical design issue; hence, designers should first consider
the hybrid solutions that, once again, draw upon standard microelectronic process and
packaging technologies. Because of the complexity of the end product, the integration of
microelectronics into a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) device is an even more
difficult problem. Consequently, it is covered in some detail in other chapters, wherein
we consider the different possible approaches, such as microelectronics first or MEMS
first. For all these reasons, this chapter seeks to provide a brief account of the standard
microelectronic technologies and thus provide a sound foundation on which to add other
nonstandard materials and processes - such as those described in later chapters on new
silicon-processing technologies (Chapters 5 and 6) and interdigitated transducer surface
acoustic wave (IDT SAW) microsensors (Chapter 12). We shall not attempt to describe all
the standard technologies, or indeed, even the subtle details of employing some of them.
Instead, our aim is to make the reader aware of the common choices currently available
and provide an appreciation of the nature of the technologies involved.
1 We will use the term microtransducer to describe a microsensing (or microactuating) device.

Figure 4.1 Overview of the microtechnologies used to make standard microelectronic devices
today
Figure 4.1 shows the basic technologies that are used to make a standard micro-
electronic device and essentially provides an overview of the contents of this chapter.
The growth and production of the single-crystal wafers are presented first, and this is
followed by their processing to make monolithic bipolar or metal oxide semiconductor
(MOS) devices, such as standard components (e.g. transistor—transistor logic (TTL),
programmable gate arrays (PGAs), and microprocessors) or application-specific integrated
circuits (ASICs). Then, some of the common signal interconnect and packaging tech
nologies are discussed. These have been divided into monolithic processes that include
bonding and making the electrical connections of the die onto a substrate and wiring
and packaging processes that include the different printed circuit board (PCB) and hybrid
solutions. Of particular importance to microtransducers and MEMS is the encapsulation
process. Standard components are usually plastic-encapsulated - a process that costs little
and provides protection from both mechanical stress and chemical attack from the envi-
ronment. However, some components are hermetically sealed inside a metal can in an
inert atmosphere that permits a higher power output through a higher device-operating
temperature. In some types of microsensors, great care must often be taken in the selec-
tion of both the mounting technologies and encapsulation process. Consider, for example,
a chemical microsensor, such as an ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET), which
needs to be operated in an ionic solution (or perhaps even in a river or reservoir) for
long periods of time without fouling, or a mechanical microsensor, such as a barometric
pressure sensor, which needs to operate in ambient conditions again for long periods of
time. It is our intention to introduce the reader to some of the different packaging tech-
nologies and to emphasise their importance while designing a microtransducer or MEMS
device.
In this chapter, we concentrate upon the monolithic processing of silicon because it is
the most commonly used semiconductor material today. Silicon is also the most impor-
tant material for making microtransducers and for making the integrated circuits (ICs)
that form the processing unit in a smart transducer or MEMS device.

4.2 WAFER PREPARATION
4.2.1 Crystal Growth
As stated in the preceding text, silicon is the most commonly used semiconductor mate-
rial for making microelectronic devices. Other semiconductor materials are employed in
certain important niche areas, for example, gallium arsenide (GaAs) for optoelectronic
devices and silicon carbide and gallium nitride (GaN) for high-power or high-temperature
devices, but silicon is by far the dominant material not only for standard microelectronic
components but also for microtransducers and MEMS devices.
Silicon is one of the earth's most abundant elements forming about 25 percent of
its surface crust. However, silicon reacts readily with oxygen and other materials in the
earth's atmosphere and hence is generally found in the form of sand (i.e. silicon dioxide
(SiO2)) or silicates. Sand can be found with an impurity level of less than 1 percent,
and this composition is usually the starting point for making single-crystal silicon wafers.
The process has three main steps: first, refining the sand into polycrystailine silicon rods;
second, growing the single-crystal silicon rods, known as boules; and third, producing the
wafers suitable for monolithic processing (see Section 4.3).
The first step is achieved by placing this relatively pure form of sand, quartzite, into
a furnace with a common source, such as coal, coke, or wood chips, of carbon. The
silicon dioxide (SiO2) is reduced by carbon and the condensed silicon vapour to form
metallurgical-grade silicon (98 to 99 percent pure):
SiO2(s) + 2C(s) 
Si(s) + 2CO(g) 
(4.1)
Next, the metallurgical-grade silicon is further purified by heating it up in an atmosphere
of hydrogen chloride (HC1) to form the compound trichlorosilane (SiHCl3):
Si(s) + 3HCl(g) 
SiHCl3(g) + H2(g) 
(4.2)
The trichlorosilane is cooled to form a liquid at room temperature (boiling point is
32 °C) and is easily purified to semiconductor standards by a fractional distillation proce-
dure. The distillation procedure removes the unwanted chlorides of metallic and dopant
impurities, such as copper, iron, phosphorous, and boron. Finally, the thermal reduc-
tion of trichlorosilane gas in a chemical vapour deposition (CVD) reactor produces
electronic-grade polycrystailine silicon, which is deposited onto a slim pure silicon rod
(see Figure 4.2).
SiHCl3(g) + H2(g) 
Si(s) + 3HCl(g)

The electronic-grade silicon rods are typically 20 cm in diameter and several metres
in length, and these are used to grow single-crystalline silicon by either the Czochralski
or the zone-melt process.
The present-day Czochralski process is based on the process invented by Czochralski in
1917 for the growth of single crystals of metals. It consists of dipping a single-crystal seed

of silicon into a graphite crucible that contains molten silicon under an argon atmosphere.
The seed is then slowly withdrawn at a typical rate of millimeters per minute while
simultaneously rotating the seed. Figure 4.3 shows a schematic diagram of a Czochralski
puller for crystal growth. Either a radio frequency (RF) or an electrical source supplies
the heat, and a known amount of the dopant is added to the melt to obtain the desired
n- or P-type doping in the grown crystal. The doping level is reasonably constant radially
across the boule but varies axially in a predefined manner; this does not usually pose a
problem for standard microelectronic devices. Czochralski crystals are grown along either
the (100) or the (111) crystal axis. Silicon crystals with a (111) axis grow more slowly
because of the smaller separation of these crystal planes of 4.135 A, but they are easier to
grow and are thus less expensive. This orientation is widely used in many microelectronic
devices. In some cases, such as in the fabrication of power devices, it is desirable to have
a high carrier mobility, and this requires a higher purity of silicon than that produced by

expensive but results in a higher level of crystal purity.
Figure 4.4 shows a schematic diagram of the apparatus used to grow a crystal by this
technique. Once again, the crystals are grown in either the (100) or the (111) orientation,
but in this case an RF field produces a melt zone at the bottom of a polycrystalline rod.
The seed is brought into contact with the molten zone and slowly rotated and pulled as
the molten zone is moved up the length of the polycrystalline rod until the process is
complete. Crystals with bulk resistivities up to 30 k - c m have been obtained using this
technique, and they show a higher purity than the Czochralski crystals (typically less
than 25 k-cm). The main drawbacks of this technique are that the crystals have smaller
diameter (less than 75 mm) and show a greater radial variation in crystal resistivity,
leading to a higher manufacturing cost.

4.2.2 Wafer Manufacture
The conventional base, or substrate, within which microelectronic devices and ICs are
fabricated, is the silicon wafer. Other substrates (e.g. glass, dielectric) upon which hybrid
circuits are built are covered later in this chapter. There are a number of production
steps that are required to turn a single-crystal silicon boule produced by Czochralski
or float-zone crystal growth into a silicon wafer suitable for monolithic processing,
namely,
1. Diameter sizing
2. Orientation
3. Slicing
4. Etching
5. Polishing
6. Cleaning

WAFER PREPARATION
67
First, the boule is ground down to a standard diameter for use in the automated processing
of wafers. This is done by a variety of wheel or belt grinders with a bias of about
+0.4 mm, but it leaves a damaged surface on the crystal. The outer damaged material
is then removed later by a less harsh treatment to give the desired wafer diameter (see
following text). The standard wafer sizes vary according to the microelectronic compo-
nent that is manufactured and the desired yield. Low volume production (e.g. specialist
microsensors/MEMS fabrication) may still use a 3" 4" or 6" wafer, whereas high volume
production of memory or microprocessor chips would use the highest available diameter,
that is, 8" or higher.
Crystal orientation and identification flats are ground into the silicon boule, and these
are used as an alignment reference in subsequent processing. Figure 4.5 shows both the
standard (larger) orientation flat (±0.5°) and the doping-type identification flat for silicon
wafers. Now, the damaged material is removed by an isotropic silicon-polishing etch of
hydrofluoric, nitric, and acetic acids to leave the boule diameter to the nominal standard
(±1 mm).
The boule is then sliced into wafers using a saw blade with a diamond or nickel cutting
edge mounted on the inside of the diameter. The blade is made as thin as possible but
is still about 100 um in thickness and therefore results in the loss of about 125 urn of
silicon per slice that represents a quarter of the silicon! Once again, the sawing processing
damages the surface of the silicon wafer, and so a further 50 to 80 um of silicon is removed
by an isotropic etch using the same acid mixture as before.
The final steps for producing the wafer are chemo-mechanical polishing using a
colloidal suspension of fine SiO2 particles in an aqueous, alkaline solution, followed
by cleaning in various detergents and water. The desired flatness of the polished wafer
depends on the subsequent process but would typically be around ±5 urn. Wafers used for
making microtransducers and MEMS devices often require an etching from the back of the
wafer and therefore, in this case, both sides of the wafer need to be polished to a fine finish.

4.2.3 Epitaxial Deposition
Epitaxial deposition is a process in which a thin, single-crystal layer can be deposited onto
the surface of a substrate wafer. The substrate wafer acts as a seeding layer and usually
has the same crystal structure as that of the epitaxial layer. Epitaxial growth is now
increasingly used in the production of both discrete devices and ICs. It is most commonly
used to isolate junctions from the substrate, that is, in junction isolation (JI) technology and
to allow formation of buried layers. JI technology permits the fabrication of circuits with
better characteristics, such as lower parasitic capacitances and faster switching speeds.
The most common types of epitaxial deposition are vapour-phase epitaxy (VPE) and
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).
There are many different designs of epitaxial reactors, and Figure 4.6 shows three
common types: a horizontal epitaxial reactor, a vertical epitaxial reactor, and a barrel
epitaxial reactor. In all cases, there is a reaction chamber in which the chemicals react to
form the epitaxial layer, a heat source (e.g. RF coils) to stimulate the chemical reaction,
and a gas supply and venting system.
In the horizontal reactor, the wafers are placed on the susceptor at a slight angle in
order to compensate for the depletion of the reactive gases as they pass along the surface.
In contrast, the susceptor is rotated in the vertical reactor and the gases can circulate
above the wafers to keep the gas partial pressures constant. Finally, in the barrel reactor,
the wafers are mounted vertically and the susceptor is again rotated to ensure an even
supply of gases to the wafers.

A number of different sources of both silicon and the dopant gas are available for
epitaxial deposition, as shown in Table 4.1.
A common silicon source is silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4), and a typical reaction temper-
ature is 1200°C. The gas is reduced by hydrogen in the following reaction:
SiCl4(g) + 2H2(g)
Si(s)+4HCl(g)
(4.4)
There is competition with a second reaction that removes the silicon layer; hence, the
concentration of silicon tetrachloride must be kept low (~0.02 mole fraction) to grow
rather than etch the silicon layer through
Si(s) + SiCl4(g)
2SiCl2(g)
(4.5)
The growth of an epitaxial layer of silicon onto a single-crystal silicon wafer is rela-
tively straightforward as the lattice spacing is matched, leaving little stress between
the epi-layer and support. In this case, the deposited material is the same material as
the substrate and is called homoepitaxy. When the deposited material is different from the
substrate (but close in lattice spacing and thermal expansivity), it is called heteroepitaxy.
Heteroepitaxy is an important technique used in microelectronics to produce a number
of specialist devices; for example, silicon-on-insulator (SOI), silicon on glass (SiO2) for
thin-film transistors, silicon on sapphire (Al2O3), and gallium nitride (GaN) for power
devices.
Epitaxial layers can be grown using CVD or physical vapour deposition (PVD); the
latter is known as MBE. In MBE, (see Figure 4.7) the single-crystal substrate is held at a
temperature of only 400 to 800 °C and in an ultrahigh vacuum of 10–11 torr. The depo-
sition process is much slower than CVD epitaxy at about 0.2 nm/s but provides precise
control of layer thickness and doping profile. MBE can be used to make specialised
structures, such as heterojunction transistors, quantum devices, and so on. However, the
ultrahigh vacuum needed and the slow deposition rate make this a very expensive tech-
nique to employ when compared with CVD epitaxy.

4.3 MONOLITHIC PROCESSING
A large number of technologies are used to fabricate discrete devices and ICs; therefore,
it is only possible here to cover some of the most commonly used ones and to simply give
the reader an appreciation of the typical steps involved. There are numerous books that
cover, in detail, semiconductor fabrication technologies (Interested readers should see, for
example, Colclaser (1980), Gise and Blanchard (1986), and Sze (1985)).
Figure 4.8 illustrates the common technologies used today to fabricate standard micro-
electronic devices. The two main classes of technology are bipolar and MOS. These
two technologies can be combined in a bipolar complementary metal oxide semicon-
ductor (BiCMOS) process to produce, for example, a mixture of high-speed, high-drive

Common silicon processes used to make standard semiconductor devices and ICs
analogue circuitry with low-power switching digital circuitry. Clearly, this dual process
is more difficult and expensive than a single process.
The bipolar process is used to make many standard analogue components (see
Section 4.3.1), for example, p-n diodes and bipolar junction transistors (BJTs), and to
make some popular logic families, such as TTL, integrated injection logic (IIL), and
emitter coupled logic (ECL) for fast switching. The MOS process can be divided into
those creating an IC within the silicon wafer (i.e. a bulk process) and those creating an
IC on top of an insulator (i.e. an SOI process). The n-type metal oxide semiconductor
(nMOS) process only makes n-channel metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor
(MOSFETs) and is simpler than the complementary MOS (CMOS) process that makes
both nMOS and p-type metal oxide semiconductor (pMOS) devices. The lower cost,
higher packing density, and low power dissipation per gate of the CMOS process makes
it one of the most commonly used technologies today.
Figure 4.9 shows the difference between the main technologies in gate-switching speed
and power dissipation per gate. GaAs has traditionally been a niche technology producing
very high-speed devices and switching circuits but at a much higher cost from a lower
yield process. However, the power dissipation of GaAs does compare favorably with
bipolar TTL and ECL, and, in some cases, with CMOS when the cost difference is
diminishing; therefore, GaAs is becoming more competitive.
A summary of the relative performances of basic bipolar and MOS processes is given
in Table 4.2. Most of the devices available for circuit design are described in the following
two sections.
There is the option to use a polysilicon gate instead of a metal gate in a CMOS
process with an N- or P-well (or both) implanted into a p-type or n-type silicon wafer

to get both pMOS and nMOS devices. Polysilicon-gate CMOS has more process steps
involved than the simpler metal-gate CMOS process, but the CMOS devices do possess
lower power dissipation per gate and higher gate-switching speed and are hence attractive
for many applications. The SOI CMOS process is being increasingly used to make very
large-scale integrated devices because of the higher packing densities possible. These thin-
film transistors have reduced latch-up and parasitic capacitance problems by using better
device isolation. SOI technology is also of interest in microsensor technology because of
the ability either to back-etch the SOI wafer to form a micromechanical silicon membrane
or to use non-silicon, dielectric substrate, such as sapphire, which has an excellent thermal

MONOLITHIC PROCESSING

conductivity. In addition, SOI technology offers extremely low unwanted parasitic effects
and excellent isolation between devices (see Section 4.3.5).
4.3.1 Bipolar Processing
The bipolar process has evolved over many years, as has its so-called standard process.
Clearly, this is an important issue and the integration of a microsensor, or microactuator,
will depend on the exact details of the process that is employed. As stated earlier, the
possible approaches to microsensors and MEMS integration and the problems associated
with compliance to a standard process are both discussed in some detail in later chapters.
This section presents what may be regarded as the standard bipolar process, which
employs an epi-layer to make the two most important types of bipolar components; that
is, vertical and lateral transistors. Bipolar n-p-n transistors are the most commonly used
components in circuit design as both amplifiers and switches because of their superior
characteristics compared with p-n-p transistors. Let us now consider in detail the process
steps required to make a vertical n-p-n and lateral p-n-p transistors. A similar process
can be defined to make vertical p-n-p transistors or the simpler substrate p-n-p transistors
with slightly different device characteristics.
Worked Example E4.1: Vertical and Lateral Bipolar Transistors
The standard bipolar process begins by taking a p-type substrate (i.e. single-crystal
silicon wafer) with the topside polished2. A buried n-layer is formed within the p-type
substrate by first growing an oxide layer. The oxide is usually grown in an oxidation
furnace using either oxygen gas (dry oxidation) or water vapour (wet oxidation) at a
temperature in the range of 900 to 1300 °C. The chemical reactions for these oxidation
processes are as follows:
Si(s) + 2H2O(g) 
SiO2(s) + 2H2(g) 
(4.6)
Other ways of forming an oxide layer, such as CVD, are discussed in Chapter 5.
The thermal oxide layer is then patterned using a process called lithography. A basic
description of these processes is given in this chapter and a description about more
advanced lithographic techniques is given in Chapter 5. Lithography is the name used
to describe the process of imprinting a geometric pattern from a mask onto a thin layer
of material, a resist, which is a radiation-sensitive polymer. The resist is usually laid
down onto the substrate using a spin-casting technique (see Figure 4.10).
In spin-casting technique, a small volume of the resist is dropped onto the centre of
the flat substrate, which is accelerated and spun at a constant low spin speed of about
2000 rpm to spread the resist uniformly. The spin speed is then rapidly increased to its
final spin speed of about 5000 rpm, and this stage determines its final thickness of 1 to
2 um. The thickness of the spun-on resist, dR, is determined by the viscosity 77 of the
2 Double-sided wafers are used if a back-etch is required to define a microstructure.

(4.7)
where fsc is the percentage solid content in solution. The resist-coated wafer is then cured
by a soft-bake at a low temperature (80 to 100°C for 10 to 20 minutes) and a process
mask applied for shadow or projection printing3. The mask is generally a reticule mask
plate and comprises a glass plate coated with a light-blocking material, such as a thin
chromium film, that has itself been patterned using a wet-etching process and a second
resist, but in this case the resist has been written on directly using a high-resolution
electron-beam writer. Then the mask and substrate are exposed to a radiation source,
usually ultraviolet (UV) light, and the radiation is transmitted through the clear parts of
the mask but blocked by the chromium coating. The effect of the radiation depends on the
type of resist - positive or negative. When a positive resist is exposed to the radiation,
it becomes soluble in the resist developer and dissolves leaving a resist pattern of the
same shape as that of the chromium film. Conversely, the negative resist becomes less
soluble when exposed to the radiation and so leaves the negative of the chromium coating.
Negative resists are used more commonly as they yield better results. Table 4.3 shows
some commercially available resists for both optical and electron-beam lithography4.
Figure 4.11 shows the lithographic patterning of a substrate with a negative resist and
chrome mask plate (mask 1), and subsequent soft-baking and developing in chemicals,
to leave the resist over predefined parts of the oxide layer. The resist is then hard-baked

Use of radiation and a mask plate to create windows in a resist layer through which
the oxide is etched and arsenic-doped to form buried n-regions in a p-type substrate. The buried
regions are used to increase device performance
(110 to 130 °C for 10 to 20 minutes) and the oxide is selectively removed using either a
wet-etching or a dry-etching process.
Table 4.4 shows the wet or liquid etchants commonly used to remove oxides and other
materials during a standard process. Dry etching is becoming increasingly popular, and
the details of different wet and dry etching processes, which are often referred to as
micromachining techniques, are described in this Chapter.
Next, arsenic is introduced into the exposed p-type silicon regions. There are two
different techniques used: thermal predeposition and ion implantation.
In thermal predeposition, a powder, liquid, or gas can be used as the source dopant
material for the predeposition process. The solid solubility of the dopant in the material,
predeposition time, and temperature determine how far the dopant diffuses into the wafer.

(4.8)
where D is the diffusion coefficient.
Table 4.5 shows the different sources used to dope semiconductors. After predeposition,
there is a drive-in step in which the existing dopant is driven into the silicon and a

MONOLITHIC PROCESSING 
77
protective layer of oxide is regrown in an oxygen atmosphere. In practice, the diffusion
coefficient D does vary itself with the level of doping, increasing somewhat linearly with
arsenic and quadratically with phosphorus. As a result, calibrated charts, instead of a
simple mathematical formula, are used to determine the doping profiles.
In the second doping technique, namely, ion implantation, the dopant element is ionised,
accelerated to a kinetic energy of several hundred keV, and driven into the substrate. This
alternative method is discussed in Section 2.5.2.
After predeposition and drive-in steps, the oxide protection layer is stripped off using a
wet or dry etch to leave the n-regions defined in the p-type substrate. An n-type epi-layer
of 4 to 6 um in thickness is grown on top of the substrate (see Section 4.2.3) to create the
buried n-type areas within the p-type substrate. The buried n-layer is used to minimise
both the collector series resistance of the vertical n-p-n transistor that is formed later and
the common-base (CB) current gain, 
F, of the parasitic p-n-p transistor formed by the
collector and base of the lateral p-n-p transistor and the substrate. However, the buried
n-regions can diffuse further into the epi-layer at elevated temperatures, and so caution
is required in any subsequent processing.
The transistors need to be electrically separated from each other, and there are a number
of techniques with which to do this. Common techniques used are oxide isolation, based
on local oxide isolation of silicon (LOCOS), junction isolation (JI) based on a deep boron
dope, or trench isolation, which is useful for minimising parasitic capacitance. At this
stage, a second mask (mask 2) is used to define the regions into which boron is implanted
and thus isolate one transistor from another (see Figure 4.12).
Then the deep n+-type contacts of the vertical n-p-n collector and lateral p-n-p base
are defined using a third mask in another patterning process, followed by an extrinsic
p-type implant for the base of the vertical n-p-n transistor and for both the emitter
and collector of the lateral p-n-p transistor (mask 3). The relatively thick, highly doped
extrinsic layer is followed by a thinner, lighter doped intrinsic base implant (mask 4)
below the emitter in the vertical n-p-n transistor. The lighter doping provides for a large
common-emitter (CE) current gain BF.
Next, the heavily doped n+ contact to the emitter in the vertical n-p-n transistor
is implanted (mask 5) to complete the transistor structures. Finally, the oxide layer is
patterned (mask 6) to form contact holes through to the transistor contacts and substrate,
and then the metal interconnect (normally 100 to 300 nm of aluminum) is deposited either
by physical evaporation or by sputtering and is patterned (mask 7) to form the completed
IC. Figure 4.13 shows the side view of two devices: the vertical n-p-n transistor and
lateral p-n-p transistor.
In some cases, a passivation layer of SiO2 or some other material is deposited and
patterned (mask 8) to serve as a physical and chemical protective barrier over the circuit.
This depends upon the proposed method of packaging of the die (see Section 4.4) and
the subsequent use. The complete bipolar process described here is summarised in
Figure 4.14.
It could be simplified by fabricating, for example, a pure n-p-n bipolar process, and, in
fact, most of the transistors in monolithic ICs are n-p-n structures. However, although the
characteristics of p-n-p transistors are generally inferior to an n-p-n transistor, as stated
in the preceding text, they are used as active devices in operational amplifiers, and as the
injector transistors in the IIL mentioned earlier. Similarly, a substrate p-n-p transistor

rather than a lateral p-n-p transistor could be fabricated by leaving out the buried n+-
layer. The problem that arises then is that it restricts the possible circuit configurations
(because the collector is connected to the substrate that gives parasitic problems) and,
therefore, the process can no longer be regarded as standard.
Various other components can also be formed using this bipolar process. For example,
Figure 4.15 shows three different types of diode that can be formed, namely, the emitter-
base diode that has a low reverse breakdown voltage of 6 to 60 V and can be used as a
Zener diode; the base-collector diode that has a higher reverse breakdown voltage of 15
to 50 V; and the epi-isolation diode.
Figure 4.16 shows five different types of resistor that can be formed: the base resistor
with a typical sheet resistance of 100 to 500 
/sq, the pinched-base resistor with a typical
sheet resistance of 2000 to 10000 /sq, the emitter resistor with a typical sheet resistance
of 4 to 20 /sq, the epi-resistor with a sheet resistance that varies from 400 to 2000 
/sq,
and a pinched epi-resistor that has a higher sheet resistance than an epi-resistor of 500 to
2000 
/sq and is often used in preference to the latter.
Finally, different capacitors can be formed; Figure 4.17 shows both the dielectric capac-
itor, in which the thermal oxide or thinner emitter oxide is used as the dielectric, and
the junction capacitance, which is suitable when there is no requirement for low leakage

trical properties compared with discrete devices that are fabricated by employing other
technologies; therefore, extra care is required to design circuits using these components.
It is common to use discrete components as external reference capacitors and resistors
together with an 1C to achieve the necessary performance.

4.3.2 Characteristics of BJTs
As noted earlier, there are a number of electronic devices available from a bipolar process,
and these may be used either as discrete components or as part of an IC, such as an oper-
ational amplifier or logic switch. Here, a basic discussion of the characteristics of the
bipolar transistor is presented. There are many textbooks that cover different aspects
of the bipolar transistor from the basic (e.g. Sze 1985) through to an advanced treat-
ment of the device physics, the construction of sophisticated models (e.g. Hart 1994),
and bipolar circuitry. Most of this material is outside the scope of this book, because
here we are mainly interested in the technologies that are relevant to the integration
of standard ICs with microtransducers and MEMS devices. However, it is necessary to
include some basic material on bipolar devices for three reasons: First, as a background
material to the readers who are less familiar with electrical engineering topics and who
want to know more about the basic electrical properties of a junction diode and tran-
sistor and the technical terms used, such as threshold voltage or current gain; second,
to serve as a reminder to other readers of the typical characteristics of a bipolar device
for use when designing an IC. Finally, and perhaps most important, to provide back-
ground information on microelectronic devices that can be exploited directly, or within
an 1C, as a microtransducer or MEMS device. For instance, a bipolar diode or bipolar
transistor may be used to measure the ambient temperature (see Chapter 8). Therefore,
for all these reasons, a brief discussion of the properties of the bipolar junction and FETs
is given here.
The basic properties of a semiconducting material have already been discussed in
Section 3.3 and they should be familiar to an electrical engineer or physicist. Therefore,
we start our discussion with the properties of the junction diode before moving on to the
BJT. As shown in the last section, a junction diode can be fabricated from a standard
bipolar process by forming a contacting region between an n-type and p-type material.

MONOLITHIC PROCESSING
83
Figure 4.18 shows (a) a schematic of the structure and (b) its symbol and implementation
in a simple direct current (DC) circuit. The concentration of the donors and acceptors are
shown in Figure 4.18(c).
In the absence of an external voltage V applied across the diode, there is a tendency
for acceptors in the p-type material to diffuse across into the n-type region driven by the
difference in electrochemical potential caused by the high concentration of acceptors pp
in p-type region compared with that in the n-type region np (i.e. pp » np). Similarly,
there is a tendency for the donors in the n-type material to move into the p-type material
because of the mismatch in carrier concentration, namely nn >> pn. Because no current
can flow across the junction without an external voltage, a depletion region that is free
of mobile charge carriers is formed. This region is called the space charge region and
it is shown in Figure 4.18(c), where the region near the p-type material is left with a
net negative charge and the region near the n-type material is left with a net positive
charge. Together, these form a dipole layer and hence a potential barrier of height Vd
(Figure 4.18(d)) that prevents the flow of majority carriers from one side to the other.
The height of the potential barrier, which is also known as the diffusion potential or
contact potential, is determined by the carrier concentrations
q 
PP
(4.9)
where T is the absolute temperature and q is the charge on an electron. The diffusion
potential varies for different technologies and is about 0.5 to 0.8 V for silicon, 0.1 to
0.2 V for germanium, and about 1.5 V for GaAs.

(4'10)
where E0 is the dielectric permittivity of free space and ET is the relative dielectric constant

Vd and the external voltage V, and for an ideal junction it is given by
= \lp\ + |/nl = .— ( ~ + ^] x V[Vd - V] 
(4.11)
q 
Nd 
Na
where Nd and Na are the donor and acceptor concentrations in the semiconducting mat-
erial. Thus, the capacitance of a junction diode is, in general, expressed by
Cd = K ( V d - V ] - m 
(4.12)
where the constant K is a function of the impurity profile and area A, and m depends on
the exact distribution of the impurities near the junction; in the ideal case, m takes a value
of 0.5, that is, a plot of 1/C2 versus V would be a straight line. Typical characteristics
of a silicon junction diode with the conductivity of the p-type and n-type regions being
100 S/cm and 1 S/cm, respectively, are a space charge layer / of 0.5 urn at V = 0 and
1.2 um at V = —5.0 (reverse-biased) and a junction capacitance of 23 pF at 0 V and
8.3 pF at —5.0 V. The nonlinear C- V characteristic of a junction diode, together with
its significant leakage current, makes its use better suited to digital rather than analogue
circuitry.
When the junction is forward-biased (i.e. V > 0), the height of the potential barrier
is reduced, and more holes flow through diffusion from the p-type region to the n-type
region and more electrons flow through diffusion from the n-type region to the p-type
region. In a simple diffusion model, in which the transition width / is much smaller
than the diffusion length, the recombination in the depletion region can be ignored and
then the net current flow is determined from the continuity equation with an exponential
probability of carriers crossing the barrier:
where J is the current density, D denotes the diffusion coefficient of the carrier and L is
its diffusion length. The V-I characteristic of a p-n junction diode is usually rewritten
in the slightly more general form of

MONOLITHIC PROCESSING
85
where 
is an empirical scaling factor and would be 1.0 for an ideal diode. Figure 4.19
shows the typical /- V characteristic of a discrete silicon p-n diode at room temperature.
The scaling factor A is about 0.58 here5 and the saturation current IS is about 1 nA. The
simple theory (Equation (4.13)) gives a saturation current of about 1 fA, but recombi-
nation effects, thermal generation, and series resistance effects increase it by 6 orders
of magnitude. Note that the saturation current is itself very temperature-dependent and
increases by approximately 20 percent per °C. Therefore, in the reverse-bias regime, the
shift in the I - V characteristic of the diode could be used to create a nonlinear temperature
sensor.
The basic theory ignores the reverse-bias breakdown of the diode, and this is shown
in Figure 4.19 as occurring around —60 V because of avalanche breakdown6. In a zener
diode, the breakdown voltage is reduced to below — 10 V by higher doping levels and
can be used as a reference voltage.
In the forward-bias region, the diode appears to switch on at a certain voltage and then
becomes fully conducting. This voltage VT will be referred to here as the threshold voltage
but is also called the cut-in or turn-on voltage. The threshold voltage is determined by
fitting a line to the high voltage values and extrapolating to the zero current axis, as

shown in Figure 4.19. The threshold voltage VT of a typical silicon junction diode is
0.6 V and has a linear temperature coefficient of about —1.7 mV/°C at 20 °C. Therefore,
operating a diode at constant current in the forward-bias regime produces a simple and
linear temperature sensor.
The BJT consists of either a p-type region sandwiched between two n-type regions
for an n-p-n transistor or an n-type region sandwiched between two p-type regions for
a p-n-p transistor; hence, it could be regarded as an n-p and p-n diode back to back.
In the last section, we saw how a bipolar process can be used to fabricate a vertical
n-p-n transistor and lateral p-n-p transistor for an IC. All the transistor voltages and
currents are defined in Figure 4.20 for both the n-p-n and p-n-p transistors. Bipolar
transistors are basically current-controlled devices in contrast to MOS transistors that are
voltage-controlled devices; therefore, we need to consider the currents in the transistor to
characterise it.
A bipolar transistor can be configured in three different ways (see Figure 4.21 for n-p-
n): (a) the CE, in which the emitter is the common terminal to both the base input voltage
VBE and the collector output voltage VCE; (b) the CB, in which the base is the common
terminal to both the emitter input voltage VEB and the collector output voltage VCB; and (c)
the common-collector (CC) configuration in which the collector is the common terminal
to both the base input voltage VBC and the emitter output voltage VEC- Bipolar transistors
are normally operated in the CE configuration because it usually provides the largest
power gain.

In the normal mode of operation7 of an n-p-n transistor in the CE configuration, the
emitter-base junction is forward-biased (i.e. VBE > 0) and the collector-base junction is
reverse-biased (i.e. VBC < 0). Therefore, the collector current Ic consists of two terms,
the main term being a fraction aF of the emitter current and the other being the reverse
saturation current ICo of the collector-base junction diode; hence
Ic = 
aFIE +

where Ln is the diffusion length of the injector carriers in the base of width W and is

silicon diode is about 1 nA.

transistor in the forward-active region, and they can also be defined from Equations (4.15),

Ideally, ap takes a value close to unity and ftp takes a value that is large.
The typical measured input characteristic IB — VBE and output characteristic Ic — VCE
of an n-p-n transistor are shown in Figure 4.22. The input characteristic is that of a diode
with a threshold voltage that is about 0.7 V corresponding to a silicon transistor. The
output characteristic shows all the possible regions of operation for the transistor.
As mentioned in the preceding text, the transistor is normally operated in the forward-
active region (VBE > 0; VBC < 0) where the forward current parameters of aF and ftp
apply. In this region, the output characteristic may be described by a simple model

teristics of the device
and the transistor is switched OFF (i.e. open), with the output current being close to

mode of operation. The reverse-bias region (VBE < 0, VBC > 0) has the emitter-base junc-
tion reverse-biased and the collector-base junction forward-biased and is defined by the
parameters aR and BR; however, this region is not used often.
Finally, it is worth noting that there are a number of low-frequency models of transistors
used to characterise their behaviour. Treating the transistor as a nonlinear two-port device,
the hybrid- 
model is often used. Figure 4.23 gives the hybrid- 
model for the CE
configuration of the n-p-n transistor with an alternating current (AC) voltage vin applied.
In this case, the h parameters define the important characteristics of the transistor operating
in the forward-active region (at the quiescent point), namely, the input impedance hie, the
current gain hfe, the output conductance hoe, and voltage gain hie.

Typical values of the h -parameters for a transistor with the ideal values shown in brackets

Higher input impedance and higher gain are realizable either in an MOS device or by
the combination of several transistors in a circuit to give better characteristics and to
be ideally linear - as in the operational amplifier. The important question to be asked
here is how the integration of the sensor or actuator in a pre- or postprocess affects the
characteristic parameters of the transistor and hence the circuit performance.

Family of field-effect transistors available from MOS technology
4.3.3 MOS Processing
As mentioned earlier, the two main semiconducting processes are bipolar and MOS. The
most important microelectronic device available from an MOS process is the field-effect
or unipolar transistor. There are two main kinds of FETs (see Figure 4.24): the junction
field-effect transistor (JFET) and the metal insulator gate field-effect transistor (MISFET).
Both types of transistors, namely, n -channel and p-channel, are available in advanced
CMOS or BiCMOS technologies; however, it should be emphasised that the MISFET is
an insulated gate control device, whereas JFET is a p-n junction control device. In silicon
technology, an insulator is readily available, that is, an oxide for the MISFET, and this
transistor is called a MOSFET. Here, we describe the process for making a MOSFET
rather than the simpler JFET because of the greater use of MOSFETs in ICs and micro-
transducers. Since the 1980s, MOSFETs have tended to be made with polysilicon rather
than metal gates because of the better device characteristics (lower parasitic capacitance)
and hence we show this process, although it is a slightly more complicated one.
As in the bipolar process, a transistor can be made in a number of different ways,
depending on whether high frequency or high power is required. The small-signal planar
MOSFET is fabricated using a simple substrate process, and Figure 4.25 summarises this
process for an n-type enhancement-mode MOSFET.
Worked Example E4.2: n-type Enhancement-Mode MOSFET
The process starts with taking a p-type single-crystalline silicon wafer as the substrate
and growing a thermal oxide layer, followed by the growth of an n-type polysilicon
layer. The polysilicon is then patterned (mask 1) using optical lithography to define
the polysilicon gate. The polygate is then used as a mask for a deep ion implantation

enhancement-mode n-channel MOSFET
of the two n+ regions that form the source and the drain on either side of the gate.
Contacts to the source and drain regions are then opened up by patterning (mask 2)
the oxide layer - again with optical lithography. Next, the metal interconnect is formed
by the deposition and patterning (mask 3) of a metal layer, such as aluminum, and a
final oxide passivation layer that is deposited and patterned (mask 4) to leave just the
wire-bonding pads exposed. A p-channel MOSFET is usually made in a CMOS process
by depositing an N-Well in the p-type wafer and so it usually takes a minimum of
five masks9 for a CMOS circuit with additional steps for LOCOS rather than junction
isolation.
As in the bipolar process, the properties of the small-signal planar MOSFET are deter-
mined by the accuracy of the photolithography. Once again, lateral and vertical transistors
can be made, and this is known as a diffused-channel metal oxide semiconductor (DMOS)
process. The lateral MOSFET can have a smaller channel10 and so runs at lower power
and higher frequencies, whereas the vertical MOSFET is a power device. Figure 4.26
illustrates the DMOS process used to make a lateral n-channel MOSFET.

Worked Example E4.3: A Lateral n-channel MOSFET
The process begins with the p-type single-crystalline substrate onto which is grown a
layer of oxide and then nitride. The nitride is then patterned (mask 1) and etched to
leave a nitride gate. Next, the drain area is masked off (mask 2) and the narrow p-type
channel is formed by ion implantation. The nitride gate and masked-off drain area are
then removed, and another mask (4) is used to define the n+ ion implantation regions
of the source and drain. Polysilicon is then grown over the whole wafer and patterned
(mask 5) to leave a polygate that extends well over the source n+ region and towards
the drain. The polygate is then used as a mask for a light n– ion implantation of a thin
channel beneath the oxide. Finally, windows are opened up through the oxide by another
lithographic process (mask 6) to the source and drain regions and a metal layer that is
deposited and patterned (mask 7) to form the connections to the gate, source, and drain
regions.
The DMOS process for the lateral MOSFET leads to a reproducible short-channel
device with a high transconductance (see Section 4.3.4), and this process is widely used to
make high-speed switching circuitry. Power MOSFETs are made using a vertical DMOS
process that is slightly more complicated than the lateral DMOS process. Figure 4.27
shows most of the steps required to make a vertical enhancement-mode n-channel power
MOSFET. The process starts with a heavily n+-doped n-type substrate rather than a p-type

The more commonly used small-signal n-channel MOSFET is shown in Figure 4.29.
MOSFETs can not only be n-channel or p-channel but also be of the depleted type or the
enhanced type. Figure 4.29 shows the symbols used to represent the four basic types of
MOSFETs.
FETs can be used to make a number of different types of microsensors. For example, a
FET can be used to make an ion-selective or gas-sensitive chemical sensor by modifying
its gate and exposing it to the local environment (see Section 8.6). For this reason, it is
useful to provide the basic properties of an MOSFET, especially for the less experienced
reader who can see the transfer characteristics of such a device. Figure 4.30 shows both the
output characteristics ID-VDS and transfer characteristic ID-VGS of a typical n-channel
enhancement-mode DMOSFET.

device in the linear region (i.e. VDs < VGs - VT, VGs > VT), the drain current is given by
ID = Kn [2 (VGS - VT) VDS - V2
DS] 
(4.24)
where Kn is the device constant and, for an n-type MOSFET, is related to the channel
length L, width W, electron mobility un, gate oxide capacitance C'o by
(4.25)
In the saturated region of operation (i.e. VDS > VGs - VT), the device is switched on and
the drain current simplifies to
n
= ~ (VGS - VT)2
(4.26)
as shown by the transfer characteristic illustrated in Figure 4.30. Pinch-off occurs when
VGS is less that VT, and, ideally, the drain current is zero when the device is switched off.
The basic dynamic properties of an FET device in a common-source configuration
can be characterised by the low-frequency equivalent circuit11 shown in Figure 4.31 in
which the main small-signal conductances12 are shown. The low-frequency gate-source,

An important parameter for both transistors and microsensors is the small-signal for-

a device. The forward transconductance gfs is defined by
d ID

Therefore, in the case of an MOSFET, the forward transconductance may be found from

mined in the saturation (S) region from Equations (4.27) and (4.26), where
gfs s = 2 (VGS - VT)
(4.30)
The low-frequency input conductance g-ls (when RL is large) is simply the sum of the
gate-source and gate-drain conductances,
gis = ggs +
(4.31)
The output or channel conductance gds is a function of the gate-source voltage and thus
varies with the type of FET. Figure 4.32 shows the variation of channel conductance for
n-channel and p-channel FETs.
The channel conductance of an FET that is turned on is low, and this corresponds to
VDS being low as well. For an n-channel depletion-type FET, the on-resistance rds(on) is
related to the forward transconductance and is given by, when VGS > VT,
rds(on) — gfs —

(4.33)
In the practical use of an FET, the various static and dynamic properties will be affected
when a load resistor RL is applied across the drain and source (see Figure 4.31) to create
a common-source voltage amplifier. However, when the output conductance is low, the
gain is related simply to the transconductance as follows:
(4.34)
The input capacitance of the FET transistor is an important parameter, and Figure 4.33
shows the principal capacitances within a transistor. A low-input capacitance is desirable
because, when coupled with a low on-resistance rds(on), the switching time is very fast.
Short-channel transistors, such as those produced by the DMOS process, have very fast (i.e.
nanosecond) switching times and so are used in high-speed circuitry. The output capacitance
Cds is mainly determined by the n-p junction capacitance and is inversely proportional to the
square root of the drain-source voltage. However, the other capacitances depend on both
gate and drain voltages, threshold voltage, and parasitic capacitances. In all these cases,
it should be remembered that the device capacitances are in the picofarad range, so care
must be taken when designing and interfacing ICs and also while using transistors as either
sensing or actuating devices. Any stray capacitance will act as a charge divider and reduce
the voltage signals accordingly in a capacitive microtransducer.
4.3.5 SOI CMOS Processing
There are many processes now used for the fabrication of MOS ICs in addition to the
standard bulk processes described earlier. One that may have particular relevance to
microtransducers and MEMs is the SOI process. Notable successes have been made in

depositing thin silicon layers onto insulators. Silicon layers can be deposited by a variety
of methods, such as zone-melt recrystallisation and solid-phase epitaxy (Furukawa 1985).
Insulating layers can be implanted using an oxygen or nitrogen implant to make SiO2 or
Si3N4, and (l00)-orientated silicon can be deposited onto glass or sapphire by a process of
heteroepitaxy. Some of the most successful methods to produce SOI presently are based
on wafer bonding. This involves bonding together two silicon wafers at high temperature,
one having a grown oxide on top. Then one of the wafers is thinned down and ends up
with the structure of silicon (substrate)-oxide-thin silicon layer. Once the thin layer of
silicon has been formed, and it is usually less than 1 micron in thickness, standard bipolar
or CMOS can be manufactured on top of this. Figure 4.34 shows the basic structure of
a lateral n-channel and p-channel MOSFET fabricated on top of a sapphire substrate.
Note that the capacitance of the source and drain to the substrate has been considerably
reduced and so SOI CMOS ICs tend to exhibit a high speed at a low power because of
the thermal sinking.
In addition, the substrate under an SOI MOSFET can be removed by a bulk-etching
process to leave a device mounted in a thin membrane. There are a number of potential
uses of SOI technology in microsensor design and Figure 4.35 shows the layout of a
gas-sensitive catalytic-gate MOSFET with an integrated FET heater. In this case, the
temperature of the CMOS-compatible sensing transistor can be raised to 180°C, possibly
using an MOSFET heater transistor, whereas the surrounding standard integrated circuitry

4.4 MONOLITHIC MOUNTING
There are a number of different technologies that can be used both to package electronic
devices and to make circuit interconnections as shown in Figure 4.36. In monolithic
mounting, the circuit interconnections have usually been created by the patterning of one
or more metallisation layers with, perhaps, some local polysilicon tracks in a CMOS
process. Therefore, the mounting process needs both to provide a suitable path for the
electrical signals from the single silicon die or chip to the substrate and to attach the
die to the substrate. A further consideration is the need to create a suitable path to
transfer heat from the chip to the substrate to limit the operating temperature of the 1C.
Figure 4.36 shows the four main technologies that are used to mount a chip that would
normally be standard components, such as MOSFET transistors or TTL logic devices, or, a
microtransducer or MEMS device that is of particular interest here, such as a temperature
IC or electrostatic microactuator.
The choice of monolithic mounting technique has implications not only to the pack-
aging cost but also to the basic characteristics of the device. Table 4.6 summarises the

basic features of these technologies and the following sections explain each method in
turn. Harper (1997) provides an excellent overview of this field.
In monolithic mounting, the die is bonded onto the substrate that is part of the IC
package. The IC package is then connected up to other electronic circuit components,
normally through a printed or hybrid circuit board. IC packages come in a variety of sizes
and forms, but the two main types are the dual-in-line13 package (DIP) and surface-mount
technology (SMT). DIPs are popular for smaller input-output (I/O) counts, whereas SMT
permits higher component densities. Figure 4.37 shows an example of a low-cost plastic
DIP, a metal DIP, and a metal SMT package.
Table 4.7 illustrates the characteristics of the common IC packages in terms of
their size, electrical characteristics, thermal characteristics, usual gates, and relative cost
(Ginsberg 1992).
4.4.1 Die Bonding and Wire Bonding
Die and wire bonding have been used for more than 25 years and involve a two-stage
process. First, the die is attached mechanically to the substrate either by an organic
adhesive, such as a silver-loaded epoxy, or by a metal solder. This is a low-temperature
13 Sometimes abbreviated to DIL package

Figure 4.37 
Examples of (a) a plastic DIP; (b) a metal DIP; and (c) a surface-mount package
process and care must be taken not to stress the die through differences in the thermal
expansions of the materials. Next, the electrical contacts between the die and substrate
are made through the bonding of a metal wire (see Figure 4.38). Gold or aluminum wires
of varying diameter (or ribbons) can be attached by thermocompression, thermosonic,
or ultrasonic bonding. Thermocompression bonding is commonly employed and requires
both heat (>300°C) and pressure to join the two metals together, usually by forming
a ball or stitch. In ultrasonic wedge bonding, the heat is generated by ultrasound and
so the substrate remains around room temperature. Finally, thermosonic bonding uses a
combination of ultrasound and pressure, and better results are obtained at intermediate
substrate temperatures of 125°C.
4.4.2 Tape-Automated Bonding
Tape-automated bonding (TAB) has a number of advantages over die- and wire-bonding
methods. First, TAB connects the die onto the substrate both electrically and mechanically.
The dies are thermocompressively bonded onto tiny beam leads that have been etched in
a metal tape (see Figure 4.39).
These inner leads have a smaller pitch than wire bonds and then fan out to a larger
pitch that is bonded onto the substrate. The gang bonding of the leads by means of a

hot thermode produces a faster throughput than wire bonding. Moreover, the reduced
inductance of a probe means that the devices can be AC-tested.
The disadvantages of TAB include the relatively high cost of the process and the need
for a large device footprint. This problem is overcome in flip-chip mounting.
4.4.3 Flip TAB Bonding
In flip TAB bonding, the die is mounted upside down on the substrate, as shown in
Figure 4.40. The major advantage of flip TAB over regular TAB mounting is that the die
can be subsequently attached to a metal lid for better thermal management.
4.4.4 Flip-Chip Mounting
Finally, flip-chip mounting of the die has a number of key advantages. It provides an
excellent contact between the die and substrate by eliminating the wire or beam lead

entirely (see Figure 4.41). Solder bumps are placed on the substrate and then the die is
mounted facedown, and the solder is melted to make the connection. The small footprint
and pitch, coupled with short interconnect of about 50 urn, and hence low inductance,
make this a very attractive technology at a relatively low cost.
Full details of these bonding methods may be found in textbooks such as Doane and
Franzon (1993).
4.5 PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD TECHNOLOGIES
Once electronic components have been made and packaged, such as the monolithic ICs
described in Sections 4.3 and 4.4, they need to be connected with other components
to form a circuit board. The most common way to do this is to make a PCB, which
is also known as a printed wiring board (PWB). There are a number of different PCB
technologies based on different dielectric materials and their fabrication process. Here, we
consider the three main kinds of organic PCBs - solid, flexible, and moulded; the ceramic
PCB is known as a thick film hybrid circuit board and is discussed in Section 4.6.1.
4.5.1 Solid Board
Solid (and flexible) PCBs generally consist of an organic dielectric material on top of
which is a thin metal layer - predominantly copper. The copper layer is patterned using
a photoresist material and an acid etch to define the tracks between the electronic compo-
nents. In the case of surface-mount devices, a single-sided organic PCB can be used as
illustrated in Figure 4.42(a). Single-sided PCBs are simpler to make and are increasingly
used with the greater availability of surface-mount components. However, the majority of
organic PCBs are double-sided with multilayer boards used in special cases, such as the
need to introduce ground planes and thereby reduce the electrical interference between
high-speed switching logic and analogue circuitry (Figure 4.42(b) and (c)). A double-
sided PCB has copper tracks patterned on both sides of the dielectric material. Electrical
connections between the layers are formed by drilling holes through the board, and this is
followed by the plating of the sides of the holes. Clearly, the metal will be thinner here,
and passing large currents down through holes can be a problem. Finally, a solder mask
is prepared and, if required, a protective layer is patterned, leaving just the solder areas
exposed.
In a solid organic PCB, the dielectric material consists of an organic resin reinforced
with fibres. The fibres are either chopped or woven into the fabric, and the liquid
resin is added and processed using heat and pressure to form a solid sheet. The most

commonly used fibres are paper, e-glass, s-glass, quartz, and aramid. The precise choice
of the dielectric material depends on the technical demands presented by the device and
application proposed, and the properties, such as the permittivity and loss factor, are
frequently the most important. Table 4.8 gives some of the properties of the fibres that
are commonly used in organic PCBs.
4.5.2 Flexible Board
In flexible PCBs, the resin used to make a solid dielectric material is replaced by a thin
flexible dielectric material and the metal is replaced by a ductile copper foil. Again, a

lithography, and layers can be joined together to form multilayer laminates. The layers
are usually bonded together using an adhesive such as acrylic, epoxy, polyester, and

polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE). Figure 4.43 shows the way in which single-sided, double-
sided, and multilayer flexible PWBs are constructed.
Table 4.9 gives some typical properties of the resins used in flexible organic PCBs.
Care is needed to match these properties with those of the copper layer and the nature of
the circuit, for example, high frequency or high power.
Flexible PCB dielectric and adhesive films are now manufactured to a standard, and
Table 4.10 shows the Class 3 properties of some dielectric films according to the standard
IPC-FC-231. Accordingly, organic PCB laminates can now be constructed with increased
confidence in their performance.
4.5.3 Plastic Moulded
The most common forms of PCB - the organic PCB and the ceramic PCB (see next
section) - are planar, that is, the metal interconnects are formed in two dimensions with
plated through holes joining one layer to another. However, it is possible to make a
three-dimensional PCB by the moulding of a suitable plastic. A three-dimensional PCB
can be made from extruded or injection-moulded thermoplastic resins with a conductive
layer that is selectively applied on its surface. However, high-temperature thermoplastics
are required to withstand the soldering process, and commonly used materials are
polyethersulfone, polyetherimide, and polysulfone. Plastic moulded PCBs have several
advantages over organic PCBs, such as superior electrical and thermal properties and
the ability to include in the design, noncircular holes, connectors, spacers, bosses, and
so on. More often than not, a moulded PCB is in essence an IC chip carrier package.
Plastic moulded PCBs may prove to be advantageous in microtransducers and MEMS
applications, in particular, when the assembled microstructure has an irregular structure
or needs special clips or connectors. The plastic moulded IC package may also be used
as part of a hybrid MEMS before full integration is realised. Future Micro-moulds may
be fabricated using microstereolithography (see Chapter 7).

STANDARD MICROELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGIES
4.6 HYBRID AND MCM TECHNOLOGIES
4.6.1 Thick Film
PCBs can also be formed on a ceramic board, and these may be referred to as
ceramic PCBs. A ceramic board, such as alumina, offers a number of advantages over
organic PCBs, because a ceramic board is much more rigid, tends to be flatter, has a
lower dielectric loss, and can withstand higher process temperatures. In addition, alumina
is a very inert material and hence is less prone to chemical attack than an organic PCB.
Ceramic PCBs can be processed in a number of different ways, such as thick-film, thin-
film, co-fired, and direct-bond copper. The most important technology is probably the thick
film. Circuit boards have been made for more than twenty years using this technology
and are usually referred to as hybrid circuits.
In thick-film technology, a number of different pastes have been developed (known as
inks), and these pastes can be screen-printed onto a ceramic base to produce interconnects,
resistors, inductors, and capacitors.
Example:
1. Artwork is generated to define the screens or stencils for the wiring layers, vias,
resistive layers, and dielectric layers.
2. Ceramic substrate is cut to size using laser drilling, and perforations that act as snapping
lines are included after the process is complete.
3. Substrate is cleaned using a sandblaster, rinsed in hot isopropyl alcohols, and heated
to 800 to 925 °C to drive off organic contaminants.
4. Each layer is then in turn screen-printed to form the multilayer structure. Each paste
is first dried at 85 to 150 °C to remove volatiles and then fired at 400 to 1000 °C.
5. The last high-temperature process performed is the resistive layer (800 to 1000 °C).
6. A low-temperature glass can be printed and fired at 425 to 525 °C to form a protective
overlayer or solder mask.
Thick-film technology has some useful advantages over other types of PCB manufacture.
The process is relatively simple - it does not require expensive vacuum equipment (like
thin-film deposition) - and hence is an inexpensive method of making circuit boards.
Figure 4.44 shows a photograph of a thick-film PCB used to mount an ion-selective
sensor and the associated discrete electronic circuitry (Atkinson 2001). The thick-film
process is useful here not only because it is inexpensive but also because it forms a robust
and chemically inert substrate for the chemical sensor. The principal disadvantage of thick-
film technology is that the packing density is limited by the masking accuracy - some
hundreds of microns. Photolithographically patterned thin-film layers can overcome this
problem but require more sophisticated equipment.
4.6.2 Multichip Modules
Increasingly, PCB technologies are being used to make multichip modules (MCMs). A
multichip module is a series of monolithic chips (often silicon) that are connected and

packaged to make a self-contained unit. This module can then be either connected directly
to peripheral ports for communication or plugged into another PCB. One important reason
for using MCM instead of a conventional die-packaging approach is that the active silicon
efficiency rating is improved (see Figure 4.45). In other words, the total area of the
semiconductor die is comparable to the MCM substrate area. As can be seen from the
figure, conventional PCB technologies and even SMT and hybrid are much poorer than
the high-density MCM methods.
The ceramic-based technology is referred to as an MCM-C structure; other MCM-C
technologies include high-temperature co-fired ceramic (HTCC) and low-temperature co-
fired ceramic (LTCC). Table 4.11 lists the relative merits of different MCM-C technologies.

The choice of ceramic substrate is important and the >99 percent alumina
has a low microwave loss, good strength and thermal conductivity, and good flatness.
However, it is expensive and 96 percent alumina can be used in most applications. In
cases in which a high thermal conductivity is required (e.g. power devices), beryllia (BeO)
or aluminum nitride (A1N) can be used, although these involve a higher cost. Table 4.12
summarises the key properties of the ceramic substrates.
In addition, modules wherein interconnections are made by thin films are classified as
MCM-D and those made by plastic (organic) laminate-based technologies are classified
as MCM-L. Table 4.13 shows a comparison of the typical properties of the three main
types of MCM interconnection technologies.

MCM technology has several advantages for integrating arrays of microtransducers and
even MEMS (Jones and Harsanyi 1995). First, the semiconductor dies can be fabricated
by a different process, with some dies being precision analogue (bipolar) components and
others being digital (CMOS) logic components. Second, the cost of fabricating the MCM
substrate is often less expensive than using a silicon process, and the lower die complexity
improves the yield. Finally, the design and fabrication of a custom ASIC chip is a time-
consuming and expensive business. For most sensing technologies, there is a need for new
silicon microstructures, precision analogue circuitry, and digital readout. Therefore, fabri-
cating a BiCMOS ASIC chip that includes bulk- or surface-micromachining techniques
is an expensive option and prohibitive for many applications.
Figure 4.46 shows the layout of a multichip module (MCM-L) with the TAB patterns
shown to make the interconnections (Joly et al. 1995). This MCM-L has been designed
for a high-speed telecommunications automatic teller machine (ATM) switching module,
which, with a power budget of 150 W, is a demanding application.
4.6.3 Ball Grid Array
There are a number of other specialised packaging technologies that can be used as an
alternative to the conventional PCB or MCM. The main drive for these technologies is
to reduce the size of the device and maximise the number of I/Os. For example, there
are three types of ball grid array (BGA) packages. Figure 4.47 shows these three types:
the plastic BGA, ceramic BGA, and tape BGA. The general advantages of BGA are
the smaller package size, low system cost, and ease of assembly. The relative merits of

(1995)
plastic and ceramic PGA packages are similar to those already discussed for PCBs and
MCMs. The tape EGA uses a TAB-like frame that connects the die with the next layer
board.
4.7 PROGRAMMABLE DEVICES AND ASICs
The microtechnologies described in this chapter are used to make a variety of different
microelectronic components. Figure 4.48 shows the sort of devices that can be made
today. These are subdivided into two classes - standard components, which are designed
for a fixed application or those that can be programmed, and application-specific ICs
(ASICs), which are further subdivided. The standard components that may be regarded as
having fixed application are discrete devices (e.g. n-p-n transistors), linear devices (e.g.
operational amplifiers), and IC logic families of TTL and CMOS (e.g. logic gates and
binary counters, random access memory). The other types of standard component may be
classified as having the application defined by hardware or software programming.
In hardware programming, the application is defined by masks in the process, and
examples of these devices include programmable logic arrays (PLAs) and read-only
memory (ROM) chips. There has been a move in recent years to make software
programmable components. The most familiar ones are the microprocessors (such as the
Motorola 68 000 series or Intel Pentium) that form the heart of a microcomputer and its

Figure 4.47 Three main types of ball grid array packages: (a) plastic; (b) ceramic; and (c) tape-ball
nonvolatile memory. For example, erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM)
in which the memory is erased by UV light and its easier-to-use successor, electronically
erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM). In recent years, there has been a
strong move toward software programmable array devices; these components do not have
the mathematical capability of a microprocessor but are able to perform simple logical
actions. As such, they can be high-speed stand-alone chips or glue chips - that is, chips
that interface an analogue device with a microcontroller or communication chip. Examples
of these are programmable logic devices (PLDs) and PGAs that may have several thousand

gates to define. The newest type of component is the programmable analogue array (PAA)
device, and these may well become increasingly important in sensing applications in which
the design of an operational amplifier circuit can be set and reset through I/O ports.
It should be noted that this classification of devices into hardware and software
programming is not universally accepted. Sometimes, it may be more useful to distinguish

between devices according to where they were programmed. In this case, devices may
all be regarded as 'electrically' programmed and then they can be subdivided into those
programmed by the manufacturer (as in mask-programmed parts) and those programmed
by the user (as in field-programmable gate array).
The second class of components are those called application-specific integrated circuit
ICs (ASICs) (see Figure 4.48). There are several types of ASIC and these are referred to
as full-custom, semicustom, and silicon compilation. Full-custom ASICs are those that are
defined down to the silicon level and, therefore, there is great scope for the optimisation
of the device layout, reduction in silicon die area, and speed of operation. However,
a full-custom design can be an expensive option and is only useful for large volumes.
Silicon compilation is the exact opposite; hence, it is rather wasteful of silicon and pushes
up the process costs while minimising the design cost. The more common approach, and
more relevant for the manufacturing of microtransducers, is that of a semicustom ASIC
chip. This has four subdivisions. In gate arrays, the device has been partly processed
and the designer simply defines the interconnection of the digital logic devices by one
or two customised masks. Thus, most of the process is common to a number of end
users, and hence the costs are greatly reduced. In analogue arrays, the same principle is
applied, except that this time a range of analogue components are being connected and
an analogue circuit is formed. In master slice, the wafer run can be split at a later stage
into different subprocesses. The last type of semicustom approach is the standard cell in
which the designer selects standard logic or analogue circuit functions from a software
library and then connects them together on the silicon die. The design time is reduced by
using standard cells with a standard process.
The various trade-offs of the ASIC technologies are illustrated in Figure 4.49 such
as risk, cost, density, and flexibility. Strictly speaking, PLDs are not ASICs but they
have been included here because they are often the main competitors to an ASIC chip.
Although the number of equivalent gates per chip in PLDs is only 500 to 3000, the cost
advantage is often attractive.
When deciding upon which ASIC technology to use, it is important to weigh the relative
costs involved, such as the development time and the nonrecurring engineering costs (mask
making etc.), and design consideration such as the architecture required and the number of
gates. In the final analysis, it is usually the volume that dictates the cost to manufacture the
chips; the production charges per 1000 gates are shown against total volume in Table 4.14.
For example, modern microprocessor and memory chips are manufactured in enormous
volume (millions of chips per year) and so the cost is dominated by the time to process
and, hence, the size of wafer processed. Current microelectronic plants use wafers of a
diameter of 8" or more, and companies have to build new plants that cost nearly one
billion dollars as larger diameter wafers become available. This situation is usually not
applicable to the manufacture of microsensors because of the much reduced volume and
higher added value.
However, all of these production costs per kgate are low compared with the cost of
fabricating a nonstandard component. For instance, when integrating a microtransducer
or MEMS with a standard IC, it is nearly always necessary to develop nonstandard pre-
or postprocessing steps, such as surface or bulk micromachining (see next chapter). This
cost issue is critical for the eventual success of a component on the market and therefore,
we will return to it later on in Chapter 8, having first described the different fabrication
methods and technologies associated with microtransducers and MEMS.

5.1 INTRODUCTION
The emergence of silicon micromachining has enabled the rapid progress in the field of
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), as discussed previously in Chapter 1. Silicon
micromachining is the process of fashioning microscopic mechanical parts out of a silicon
substrate or, indeed, on top of a silicon substrate. It is used to fabricate a variety of
mechanical microstructures including beams, diaphragms, grooves, orifices, springs, gears,
suspensions, and a great diversity of other complex mechanical structures. These mechan-
ical structures have been used successfully to realise a wide range of microsensors1
and microactuators. Silicon micromachining comprises two technologies: bulk micro-
machining and surface micromachining. The topic of surface micromachining is covered in
the next chapter. Further details can be found in the two-volume Handbook of Microlithog-
raphy, Micromachining, and Microfabrication (Rai-Choudhury 1997).
Bulk micromachining is the most used of the two principal silicon micromachining
technologies. It emerged in the early 1960s and has been used since then in the fabrication
of many different microstructures. Bulk micromachining is utilised in the manufacture of
the majority of commercial devices - almost all pressure sensors and silicon valves and 90
percent of silicon acceleration sensors. The term bulk micromachining expresses the fact
that this type of micromachining is used to realise micromechanical structures within the
bulk of a single-crystal silicon (SCS) wafer by selectively removing the wafer material.
The microstructures fabricated using bulk micromachining may cover the thickness range
from submicrons to the thickness of the full wafer (200 to 500 um) and the lateral size
ranges from microns to the full diameter of a wafer (75 to 200 mm).
Etching is the key technological step for bulk micromachining. The etch process
employed in bulk micromachining comprises one or several of the following techniques:
1. Wet isotropic etching
2. Wet anisotropic etching
3. Plasma isotropic etching
4. Reactive ion etching (RIE)
5. Etch-stop techniques
1 Chapter 8 is devoted to this topic.

SILICON MICROMACHINING: BULK
Some of these etch processes have already been used as a standard technology in the
microelectronics industry, for example, RIE (Chapter 2).
In addition to an etch process, bulk micromachining often utilises wafer bonding and
buried oxide-layer technologies. However, the use of the latter in bulk micromachining
is still in its infancy.
This chapter describes the commonly used bulk-micromachining processes and gives
a set of worked examples2 that illustrate the applications of each one, or a combination,
of these important processes. The discussion includes the important topics of etch-stops
and wafer-to-wafer bonding.
5.2 ISOTROPIC AND ORIENTATION-DEPENDENT WET
ETCHING
Wet chemical etching is widely used in semiconductor processing. It is used for lapping
and polishing to give an optically flat and damage-free surface and to remove contami-
nation that results from wafer handling and storing. Most importantly, it is used in the
fabrication of discrete devices and integrated circuits (ICs) of relatively large dimensions
to delineate patterns and to open windows in insulating materials. The basic mechanisms
for wet chemical etching of electronic materials were described in Section 2.4. It was
also mentioned that most of the wet-etching processes are isotropic, that is, unaffected by
crystallographic orientation.
However, some wet etchants are orientation-dependent, that is, they have the property
of dissolving a given crystal plane of a semiconductor much faster than other planes (see
Table 5.1). In diamond and zinc-blende lattices, the (111) plane is more closely packed
than the (100) plane and, hence, for any given etchant, the etch-rate is expected to be
slower.
A commonly used orientation-dependent etch for silicon consists of a mixture of potas-
sium hydroxide (KOH) in water and isopropyl alcohol. The etch-rate is about 2.1 um/min
for the (110) plane, 1.4 urn/min for the (100) plane, and only 0.003 um/min for the (111)
plane at 80 °C; therefore, the ratio of the etch rates for the (100) and (110) planes to the
(111) plane are very high at 400:1 and 600:1, respectively.

Figure 5.1 Anisotropic etching of (100) crystal silicon
Figure 5.1 shows orientation-dependent etching of (100)-oriented silicon through pat-
terned silicon dioxide (SiO2), which acts as a mask. Precise V-grooves, in which the edges
are (111) planes at an angle of approximately 55° from the (100) surface3, can be realised
by the etching. If the etching time is short, or the window in the mask is sufficiently
large, U-shaped grooves could also be realised. The width of the bottom surface, w, is
given by
w = WQ — 2h coth(55°) 
or w = WQ — 1.4h
(5.1)
where WQ is the width of the window on the wafer surface and h is the etched depth.
If (110)-oriented silicon is used, essentially straight walled grooves with sides of (111)
planes can be formed as shown in Figure 5.1.
Worked Example E5.1: Mechanical Velcro
Objective:
The objective is to apply isotropic and anisotropic wet etching to fabricate a dense regular
array of microstructures that act as surface adhesives (Han et al. 1992). The principle
of bonding is that of a button snap, or a zipper, but in a two-dimensional configuration.
The bonding principle is shown by a schematic cross section in Figure 5.2. When two
surfaces fabricated with identical microstructures are placed in contact, the structures
self-align and mate. Under the application of adequate external pressure, the tabs of
the structures deform and spring back, resulting in the interlocking of the two surfaces.
Thus, the structures behave like the well-known 'Velcro' material.

SILICON MICROMACHINING: BULK
Process Flow:
1. A 120-nm SiO2 layer is grown at 1000°C in dry oxygen on (100) silicon wafers.
The oxide is patterned using optical lithography into an array of 10 um2 rectangular
islands, with one edge aligned 45° to the (110) flat (see Figure 5.3(a)).
2. After photoresist stripping, the wafer is immersed in an anisotropic etch bath that
consists of aqueous KOH (33-45 percent, 84 °C, 4 min) and isopropyl alcohol. The
etching results in a truncated pyramid with exposed (212) planes, which are the fastest
etching surfaces. The (212) planes intercept the (100) base plane at an angle of 48°
(See Figure 5.3(b)).
3. After stripping the masking oxide and cleaning the samples with a conventional
chemical sequence, a thick SiO2 layer (~1.0 to 1.5 um) is grown at 1000 °C in
wet oxygen. The oxide is patterned by a second mask that consists of an array of
Greek crosses, each approximately 18-um wide, aligned to the original array (see
Figure 5.3(c)).
4. The oxide crosses act as a mask for a second etch in KOH (~3 min),
which removes some of the underlying silicon. Finally, the microstructures are
completed by etching the wafer for two minutes in an isotropic etching bath
(15:5:1 HNO3:CH3CO2H:HF). This step provides the vertical clearance for the
interlocking mating structures and the lateral undercut necessary to produce the
four overhanging arms. Although the isotropic silicon etch also attacks the oxide,
the selectivity is sufficiently large so as not to cause a significant problem (see
Figure 5.4(d)).

Figure 5.4 (a) Damaged area against insertion pressure and (b) tensile strength against area
damaged (Han et al. 1992)
Mechanical Testing:
Patterned samples, nominally (8 x 8) mm2, were interlocked by applying a load to the
upper substrate; the insertion pressure is monitored by placing the entire assembly on an
electronic force scale. The bond strength of the mating structures is then characterised
by direct measurements of the tensile load needed to induce failure. Bond strength is
determined by applying a tensile load through a pulley and measuring the force necessary
for separation. Separation of the samples (failure) is always accompanied by damaged
areas only on some regions of the mating surfaces, implying that the samples are only
interlocked over these damaged regions. The fraction of the damaged area is found to
be proportional to the insertion pressure (Figure 5.4(a)). Also, the tensile load necessary
to induce failure is proportional to the fraction of the damaged area (Figure 5.4(b)).
Extrapolation of the straight line plot of the area damaged against the tensile strength
to 100 percent interlocking yields a tensile strength of approximately 1.0 MPa.
Failure Analysis:
The analysis assumes a simple cantilever model as shown in Figure 5.5.
In the figure, Fn is the interaction force between the tabs and / is the length of the
tab. The bending stress, a, is given by
a(x) = M(x)y
(5.2)
where x is measured from the edge of the tab that is attached to the substrate, the
bending moment M(x) is given by Fn(l - x) Iz is the moment of inertia (bh3/12) of
the rectangular cross-sectional area of width b and thickness h about the centroidal axis
(z-axis), and y is the distance from the neutral plane. The maximum bending stress amax
occurs when x = 0 and y = ±h/2 and is given by
6/y

amax is higher than Tmax with the ratio of Tmax/amax equal to h/4l for the design used.
Visual examination of the tested samples indicates that failure is accompanied by
damage to the edge of the tab and is consistent with the failure occurring when amax

The tensile strength (failure load) of the structure can be found by substituting design
values for b, h, l, a, and /z (0.5) and by substituting ayp (6 x 105 kPa for the oxide) for
amax in Equation (5.7) to obtain a value of Fext equal to 1.1 MPa, which is in agreement
with the value obtained from the extrapolation of data in Figure 5.4(b). This finding
confirms that the failure mechanism is that of bending stress, which exceeds the oxide
yield point at the tab edge.

Worked Example E5.2: Undoped Silicon Cantilever Beams
Objective:
To fabricate a cantilever beam oriented in the (100) direction on (100) silicon wafers
(Choit and Smits 1993).
Process Flow:
1. A layer of SiO2 that is 0.5 um thick is grown on a (100) n-type silicon wafer.
The wafer is spin-coated with a layer of positive photoresist. The masks needed to
fabricate the cantilevers are shown in Figure 5.6(a, b). Cross-hatched areas represent
opaque regions of the masks. For mask 1 (Figure 5.6 (a)),
w1 = 2(wb +
and
(5.8)
where lb, wb, and tb are the length, width, and thickness of the beam, respectively.
l1 and w1 are shown in Figure 5.6(a). For mask 2 (Figure 5.6(b)), we have
= wb +
and l2 =
(5.9)
where d is a small parameter that corrects design errors and mask misalignment, l2
and w2 are shown in Figure 5.6(b). The two masks have essentially the same pattern,
except that mask 2 has a smaller beam width than mask 1. The wafer is patterned
with mask 1. The wafer is oriented in such a way that the length of the cantilever
beam is in the (010) direction of the wafer, as shown in Figure 5.6(c).
2. The wafer is then immersed in a bath of buffered oxide etch (BOE) to remove the
SiO2 in the areas that are not covered by photoresist, and this is followed by dissolving
the resist in an acetone bath. A transverse cross section of the beam region after the
resist has been removed is shown in Figure 5.7(a). The wafer is now ready to be
bulk-etched in sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at 55 °C.
3. Etching will take place in regions where the (100) planes of silicon are exposed.
Lateral etching of silicon directly underneath the SiO2 passivation layer will also
occur; the lateral planes that are etched are the (100) equivalent planes. These planes
are normal to the substrates. The rate of downward etching is the same as that
of lateral etching; this will result in walls that are almost completely vertical (see
Figure 5.7(b)). Planes are formed at the clamped end of the cantilever beam (111).

oxidised to grow a fresh layer of SiO2 that is 1 urn thick. The wafer is spin-coated
with a layer of positive photoresist and patterned with mask 2. After the unprotected
oxide is etched away in BOE, the resist is removed in acetone. The wafer is then
etched in NaOH at 55 °C until the bulk silicon is completely under-etched in the
areas that are directly underneath the beam. Figure 5.7(c, d) shows the evolution of
the silicon cantilevers etched in this way at different stages of the final etching in
NaOH.
5.3 ETCH-STOP TECHNIQUES
Many different chemical etchants for silicon are known. The properties that make some of
these etchants indispensable to micromachining of three-dimensional structures are selec-
tivity and directionality. As etching processes in polar solvents are fundamentally charge
transport phenomena, it is not surprising that the etch-rate may be dopant-type-dependent,
dopant-concentration-dependent, and bias-dependent. Etch processes can be made selec-
tive by the use of dopants - heavily doped regions etch more slowly - or even halted elec-
trochemically when observing the sudden rise in current through an etched n-p junction.
A region where wet (or dry) etching tends to slow down (or halt) is called an etch-stop.
There are several ways in which an etch-stop region can be created. In the following
subsections, two such methods by which etch-stops are created are discussed. These
methods are:
• doping-selective etching (DSE)
• bias-dependent etching BSE
5.3.1 Doping-Selective Etching (DSE)
Silicon membranes are generally fabricated using the etch-stop phenomenon of a thin,
heavily boron-doped layer, which can be epitaxially grown or formed by the diffusion
or implantation of boron into a lightly doped substrate. This stopping effect is a general
property of basic etching solutions such as KOH, NaOH, ethylenediamine pyrocatechol

ETCH-STOP TECHNIQUES
125
(EDP), and hydrazine (see Table 5.2). Because of the heavy boron-doping, the lattice
constant of silicon decreases slightly, leading to highly strained membranes that often
show slip planes. They are, however, taut and fairly rugged even in a few microns of
thickness and are approximately 1 cm in diameter. The technique is not suited to stress-
sensitive microstructures that could lead to the movement of the structures without an
external load. In this case, other etch-stop methods should be employed.
Early studies (Greenwood 1969; Bohg 1971) on the influence of boron doping on the
etch rates of EDP for (100) silicon at room temperature have shown a constant etch rate of
approximately 50 u,rn/h for the resistivity range between 0.1 and 200 Q-cm corresponding
to boron concentration from 2 × 1014 to 5 x 1017 cm–3. As the boron concentration is
raised to about a critical value of 7 × 1019 cm–3, corresponding to a resistivity of approx-
imately 0.002 £2-cm, the silicon remains virtually unattacked by the etching solution
(see Table 5.2). Figure 5.8 shows the boron-doping etch-stop properties for both KOH
and EDP.
The dependence of the etch rate on the dopant concentration is typically exploited
for undercutting microstructures that are defined by a masked heavy boron diffusion

in a lightly doped n- or p-type substrate. If the etch-stop concentration threshold lies in
between the substrate and diffusion concentrations, the p-substrate (or n -substrate for that
matter) is etched out from underneath the high boron diffusion. A silicon microstructure
with a geometry defined by the diffusion mask and a thickness close to the diffusion depth
is hence left freely suspended.
The main benefits of the high boron etch-stop are the independence of crystal orien-
tation, the smooth surface finish, and the possibilities it offers for fabricating released
structures with arbitrary lateral geometry in a single etch step. On the other hand, the
high levels of boron required are known to introduce considerable mechanical stress
into the material; this may even cause buckling or even fracture in a diaphragm or
other double-clamped structures. Moreover, the introduction of electrical components for
sensing purposes into these microstructures, such as the implantation of piezoresistors,
is inhibited by the excessive background doping. The latter consideration constitutes an
important limitation to the applicability of the high boron dose etch-stop. Consequently,
bias-dependent BSE, commonly referred to as an electrochemical etch-stop, is currently
the most widely used etch-stop technique.
5.3.2 Conventional Bias-Dependent BSE or Electrochemical
Etch-Stop
In electrochemical etching of silicon, a voltage is applied to the silicon wafer (anode), a
counter electrode (cathode) in the etching solution. The fundamental steps of the etching
mechanism are as follows:
1. Injection of holes into the semiconductor to raise it to a higher oxidation state Si+
2. Attachment of negatively charged hydroxyl groups, OH–, to the positively charged Si
3. Reaction of the hydrated silicon with the complexing agent in the solution
4. Dissolution of the reaction products into the etchant solution
In bias-dependent etching, oxidation is promoted by a positive voltage applied to the
silicon wafer, causing an accumulation of holes at the Si-solution interface. Under these
conditions, oxidation at the surface proceeds rapidly while the oxide is readily dissolved
by the solution. Holes such as H+ ions are transported to the cathode and released there
as hydrogen gas bubbles. Excess hole-electron pairs can, in addition, be created at the
silicon surface, for example, by optical excitation, thereby increasing the etch rate.
Figure 5.9 shows an electrochemical cell that is used to etch Si in a 5 percent hydro-
fluoric (HF) solution. The cathode plate used is made of platinum. In the etching situation
shown in Figure 5.9, holes are injected into the Si electrode and they tend to reside at
the Si surface where they oxidise Si at the surface to Si+. The oxidised silicon interacts
with incoming OH~ that are produced by dissociation of water in the solution to form
the unstable Si(OH), which dissociates into SiO2 and H2 gas. The SiO2 is then dissolved
by HF and removed from the silicon surface.
The current density-voltage characteristics for different silicon types and resistivities
are shown in Figure 5.10. It is apparent from Figure 5.10 that the current density is very
much dependent on the type and the resistivity (doping level) of Si. This dependence on
the type and resistivity is the property that is utilised in the electrochemical etch-stop
phenomenon.

To understand the mechanisms of electrochemical etch-stop, it is important to explore
in more detail the current-voltage (/- V) characteristics in etching solutions that exhibit
strong electrochemical etch-stop effects. The curves in Figure 5.11 are typically (I-V)
characteristics for n- and p-type silicon in KOH. We can easily see the similarity of
Figure 5.11 to the well-known curve of a diode, except that at a certain voltage the
current suddenly and sharply drops. Let us define the open circuit potential (OCP) as the
potential at which the current / is zero, and the passivating potential (PP) as the potential
at which the current suddenly drops from its maximum value. The two regions of interest
are the ones separated by the PP. Only cathodic to the PP is the sample etched, whereas
just anodic to it, an oxide grows and the surface is passivated. The insulating oxide layer
that is formed during the etching process brings about the drastic fall in current at the
PP. The difference between this etch and the HF etch described in Figure 5.9 is the fact
that in the latter etch the oxide is dissolved by the HF solution, whereas in the former
etch the oxide is not readily dissolved in the KOH solution. Another important feature of
Figure 5.11 is the different behaviour of the two dopant types. When applying a voltage
between the two passivating potentials of n- and p-type, one expects, in accordance
with the characteristics shown in Figure 5.11, that only the p-type sample, and not the
n-type sample, would be etched. This is the doping-selective effect that is used as an
etch-stop.

OCP and the current stops above the passivating potential (PP) (Linden et al. 1989)
The growth of an anodic oxide is believed to result from the progressing competition
between the oxidation of the silicon and the dissolution of the oxide products at the
silicon-solution interface. Ellipsometric measurements have given evidence of such an
oxide layer (Palik et al. 1985a). The results have been fitted with a multilayer model that
suggests a graded connective layer of SiOx.
Measurements on etch rates in KOH as a function of applied potential (Palik et al.
1985a) show that at the OCP there is very little difference in the etch rates between
the n- and p-type substrates, whereas there is a marked difference at other potentials.
Furthermore, the etch rate is not proportional to the current, and in fact, the etch rate
attains a maximum at the OCP (current is zero) and slows down as the PP (current is a
maximum) is approached; eventually, the etch stops when the current drops. The etch rates
at the OCP, therefore, seem to be independent of free-carriers concentration, and it seems
reasonable to suggest that the chemical mechanism is dominant. However, at the other
potentials, in which the etch rates for the n- and p-type dopants differ, this is probably
not the case. At these potentials, it is possible that a combined chemical and electro-
chemical mechanism is responsible for the etching process. A chemical-electrochemical
mechanism is proposed (Palik et al. 1985b) in which a chemical reaction takes place at
the silicon surface with sequential attacks of Si-Si bonds by H2O and OH, resulting
in the discharge of the OH into the etching layer giving soluble silicate of the form
Si(OH)2O2.
It is then followed by the more rapid electrochemical reaction that oxidises underlying
bonds. The reduction-oxidation couple OH–/H2O is assumed to supply the species for
etching, electrolysis, and oxidation.
The hydrogen gas produced per Si atom has been measured (Palik et al. 1985b) and
was found to be 2H2 per Si; this indicates a chemical reaction for a Si—Si bond at the
OCP as follows:
Si - Si + H2O
Si - H + Si - OH
(5.10)

ETCH-STOP TECHNIQUES

and
Si - Si + Si - OH + OH
Si - O– + Si - OH + H2
(5.11)
The net reaction for dissolution of a silicon atom would, therefore, be
Si + 2HO + 
2OH– 
> H2 + Si(OH)2(O–)2
(5.12)
The nature of the band bending at the surface will play a critical role in the effect that an
applied bias gives. A model relating the DSE and the p+-Si etch-stop with band bending
and charge transfers has been suggested but is beyond the scope of this book.
The conventional electrochemical etch-stop technique is an attractive method for fabri-
cating both microsensors and microactuators because it has the potential for allowing
reproducible fabrication of moderately doped n-type silicon microstructures with good
thickness control. However, a major limiting factor in the use of the conventional elec-
trochemical etch-stop process is the effect of reverse-bias leakage current in the junction.
Because the selectivity between n- and p-type silicon in this process is achieved through
the current-blocking action of the diode, any leakage in this diode will affect the selec-
tivity. In particular, if the leakage current is very large, it is possible for etching to
terminate well before the junction is reached. In some situations, the etching process
may fail completely because of this leakage. This effect is well known, and alternative
biasing schemes that employ three and sometimes four electrodes have been proposed to
minimise this problem. In the three-electrode setup (see Figure 5.12), a reference electrode
is introduced for more accurate control over the potential of the etchant.
In the four-electrode setup (Figure 5.13), a fourth electrode is used to contact the
p-type substrate to gain direct control over the p-n forward-bias voltage. The four-
electrode approach allows etch-stopping on lower quality epitaxial layers (larger leakage
currents) and should also enable etch-stopping of p-type epitaxial layers on an n-type
substrate.

ages are indicated relative to the reference electrode RE
The conventional junction etch-stop permits the formation of n-type structures. If the
doping types of the silicon in Figures 5.12 and 5.13 are reversed such that the bias
is applied to a p-type layer, and the n-type is exposed to solution, the diode is now
forward-biased by the applied potential. If the forward-diode current density is low
enough, it is possible that the n-type silicon will not passivate, even if the potential
applied to the p-type layer is greater than the passivation potential for silicon. If this
is the case, the n-type silicon will etch until it reaches the p-type layer, thus permit-
ting the formation of a p-type membrane. In practice, this process can be very difficult
to implement because it requires a very tight control of the potential applied to the
p-type layer and it is very sensitive to the diode-forward characteristics. To circum-
vent this weakness of the conventional electrochemical etch-stop technique, an alter-
native dopant-selective technique that uses pulsed anodising voltages applied to silicon
samples immersed in etching solutions was developed (Wang et al. 1992). This alternative

ETCH-STOP TECHNIQUES 
131
technique is called selective etching by pulsed potential anodisation and is described in
the following section.
5.3.3 Selective Etching of n -Type Silicon by Pulsed Potential
Anodisation
The pulsed potential anodisation technique selectively etches n-type silicon (Wang et al.
1992). The difference in the dissolution time of anodic oxide formed on n- and p-type
silicon samples under identical conditions is used to create an etch selectivity. The mech-
anism responsible for this dissolution time difference is not fully understood at present.
However, it is believed to be due to a difference in oxidation rates caused by the limited
supply of holes in n-type samples (Wang et al. 1992). This technique is applicable in a
wide range of anodising voltages, etchant compositions, and temperatures. It differs from
the conventional p-n junction etch-stop in that the performance of the etch-stop does
not depend on the rectifying characteristics or quality of a diode. Using this technique,
p-type microstructures of both low and moderate doping can be fabricated. Hence, the
pulsed potential anodisation technique opens up the possibility for the creation of fragile
microstructures in p-type silicon.
The main problems with the conventional electrochemical etch-stop and the pulsed
potential anodisation technique are related to the etch holders required for contacting the
epitaxial layer (and the substrate for two, three, or four electrodes) and for protecting
the epitaxial side of the wafer from the etchant. Any leakage in these holders interferes
with the correct operation of the etch-stop. Moreover, mechanical stress introduced by
the holder is known to reduce substantially the production yield in many cases. There-
fore, development of a reliable wafer holder for anisotropic etching with electrochemical
etch-stop is not straightforward. The process of making contact with the wafer itself can
also be critical and difficult to implement. Therefore, single-step fabrication of released
structures with either the conventional electrochemical etch-stop or the pulsed poten-
tial anodisation techniques may be troublesome. An alternative etch-stop technique that
does not require any external electrodes (or connections to be made to the wafer) has
been recently developed. This new technique is what is referred to as the photovoltaic-
electrochemical etch-stop technique (PHET) (Peeters et al. 1994).
5.3.4 Photovoltaic Electrochemical Etch-Stop Technique (PHET)
The PHET approach is able to produce the majority of structures that can be produced
by either the high boron or the electrochemical etch-stop (Peeters et al. 1994). PHET
does not require the high impurity concentrations of the boron etch-stop and does not
require external electrodes or an etch holder as is required in conventional electrochem-
ical etch-stop or in pulsed anodisation technique. Free-standing p-type structures with
arbitrary lateral geometry can be formed in a single etch step. In principle, PHET is to
be seen as a two-electrode electrochemical etch-stop in which the potential and current
required for anodic growth of a passivating oxide is not applied externally but is generated
within the silicon itself. The potential essentially consists of two components, namely,
the photovoltage across an illuminated p-n junction and the 'Nernst' potential of an
n-Si/metal/etchant solution electrochemical cell.

Worked Example E5.3: Formation of an Array of Thin Membranes
Objective:
The objective is to use electrochemical etching to fabricate an array of membranes with
thickness in the range 3 to 8 um and sides that are between 0.5 and 5 mm. The array is
to be fabricated on a p-type silicon substrate (Linden et al. 1989).
Process Flow:
1. The silicon wafers used are standard commercial, 280 um thick, (100)-oriented silicon
wafers. The wafers are boron-doped to a resistivity of 7 to 10 fi-cm, which corre-
sponds to a doping concentration of approximately 1.5 x 1015 cm–3. To produce a
p-n junction on the front surface of the wafer, a phosphorus-doped n-layer is diffused
on the p-type silicon wafer. The diffusion is performed by a predeposition, in which
oxygen is bubbled through a flask containing POCl3, followed by a driven-in diffusion
with a mixed gas ambient of nitrogen and oxygen. Typical n-doping concentrations
are around 1017 cm–3.
2. Standard photolithographic methods are used to form a SiO2 mask on the backside
(p-type side) of the wafer. The sides of the membranes range between 5 mm and
0.1 mm and the thickness (the thickness of the n-layers) range from 8 um down to
3 um (see Figure 5.14(a)).
3. The wafer is mounted on the etch apparatus as shown in Figure 5.14(b). The voltage
between the two passivating potentials is chosen as 1.9 V. The etch, using a KOH
solution, is performed through the p-type material and stopped when it reaches the
n-type material. Etching through the p-type silicon usually takes around four to five
hours.

Worked Example E5.4: Fabrication of Cantilever Beams
Objective:
The objective is to fabricate a cantilever beam that is a few microns thick on a p-type
silicon that supports wafers using electrochemical etching (Linden et al. 1989).
Process Flow:
The starting silicon wafers used are again standard commercial, 280 um thick4, (100)-
oriented silicon wafers. The wafers are boron-doped with a resistivity of 7 to 10 £2-cm,
which corresponds to a doping concentration approximately 1.50 × 1015 cm–3. Two
different techniques can be used to define the beam.
Technique A: The diffused-pattern technique
In the diffused-pattern technique, an n-type (a diffused n-layer of n-doping concen-
tration ~1017 cm–3, as described in Worked Example 5.3) pattern that describes the
beam is diffused into the wafer. The wafer is masked with SiO2 grown in wet O2
at 1000°C. Then, by stripping the patterning oxide and by performing the electro-
chemical etch, the beam will be totally defined by the diffusion process. The steps
for the beam fabrication using this method are shown in Figure 5.15. The etching is
performed in an apparatus similar to the one described in Worked Example 5.3 (see
Figure 5.14(b)).
In this technique, the pattern is diffused, thus resulting in an n-type pattern defining
the beam. Because of lateral diffusion during the drive-in, this technique will result in
beams with 'rounded' corners (Figure 5.15 (c)); this means that we will not end up with
the sharp corners that are usually associated with anisotropic etching.
Technique B: The etched-pattern technique
In the etched pattern technique, an n-type layer (dopant concentration ~1017 cm–3) is
diffused over the entire wafer. Oxidation is performed simultaneously with the drive-
in of the dopant. The oxide is patterned to cover the surfaces of the forming beam.
The wafer is then immersed in the KOH etching solution as in Worked Example 5.3
(Figure 5.14(b)) without any bias, until the n-type layer is etched through and the p-type
layer is exposed. Following this nonbias etch, a voltage bias is applied and the beam
will be etched correctly. The processing sequence for the beam fabrication using the
etched-pattern technique is outlined in Figure 5.16(a) through to (d).
This method has all the advantages of the anisotropic KOH etch, that is, giving
perfectly sharp corners defined by the (111) crystal planes. On the other hand, there
will be under-etching alongside the beam under the oxide mask when etching the top
layer without bias (if the beam is parallel to the (100) planes). In addition, the tip of the
beam will be 'polygonal' instead of being square in shape (Figure 5.16(e)) because the
etchant finds faster etching planes at the convex corners. Another possible advantage is
the fact that the beam surfaces are protected by the SiO2 throughout the whole etching
4 Wafer thickness normally increases with diameter, so 280 )im-thick wafers (3" diameter) are now hard to
source; however, larger (e.g. 4") wafers can be thinned down.

5.4 DRY ETCHING
As discussed in Sections 5.2 and 5.3, bulk-micromachining processes can yield SCS
microstructures using crystal-orientation-dependent and dopant-concentration-dependent
wet chemical etchants, such as EDP, KOH, and hydrazine to undercut the SCS structures
from a silicon wafer. However, the type, shape, and size of the SCS structures that can
be fabricated with the wet chemical etch techniques are severely limited. A dry-etch-
based process sequence to produce suspended SCS mechanical structures and actuators
has been developed (Zhang and McDonald 1992). The process is called single-crystal
reactive etching and metallisation (SCREAM). SCREAM uses RIE processes to fabricate
released SCS structures with lateral feature sizes down to 250 nm and with arbitrary
structure orientations on a silicon wafer. SCREAM includes process options to make
integrated, side-drive capacitor actuators. A compatible high step-coverage metallisation
process using metal sputter deposition and isotropic metal dry etch is used to form side-
drive electrodes. The metallisation process complements the silicon RIE processes that
are used to form the movable SCS structures.
For the SCREAM process, mechanical structures are defined with one mask and are
produced from a silicon wafer. The process steps used in SCREAM are illustrated in

Figure 5.17 
SCREAM process flow for a straight cantilever beam with integrated electrodes
(Zhang and McDonald 1992)
Figure 5.17. This figure shows the SCREAM process sequence for the fabrication of
a straight cantilever beam including the integrated metal electrodes adjacent to each
side of the beam. A layer of SiO2, used as an etch mask, is thermally grown on the
silicon substrate. The pattern to produce free-standing SCS structures is created using
photolithography. The photoresist pattern on the SiO2 is transferred to the silicon dioxide
using fluorocarbon-based oxide etching plasma. The photoresist is then stripped by an
O2 plasma etch and the SiO2 pattern is subsequently transferred to the silicon substrate
using a Cl– -based or a HBr-based RIE. Following the silicon etch, a sidewall silicon
dioxide layer is thermally grown in wet O2 at high temperatures. The thermal oxidation
process reduces possible damage on the sidewalls of the silicon steps created during the
RIE process. The lateral dimensions of the SCS structures are reduced during the thermal
oxidation. A metal layer is conformably deposited on top of the thermal oxide using a
sputter deposition system. Before the metal deposition, contact windows are opened to
allow electrical contact to both the silicon substrate and the movable silicon structures.
After the metal sputter deposition, photoresist is spun on the metal layer to refill the few-
microns-deep trenches. A metal side-electrode pattern is created in the photoresist using

136
SILICON MICROMACHINING: BULK
a wafer stepper to expose the photoresist. The metal side-electrode is then transferred to
the metal by a metal RIE process. After the metal electrodes are patterned, the SiO2 is
etched back with fluorocarbon-based RIE. Finally, the silicon mechanical structures are
released from the silicon substrate using an RIE process.
The SCREAM process described in the preceding text can be used to fabricate
complex, circular and triangular structures in SCS. These structures can include integrated,
high-aspect-ratio, and conformable capacitor actuators. The capacitor actuators are used
to generate electrostatic forces and so produce micromechanical motion.

rated Aluminum Electrodes Using SCREAM
Objective:
To fabricate a free-standing cantilever beam 200 nm long, 0.8 um wide, and 3.5 urn

Process Flow:
The steps are based on the process shown in Figure 5.17, with the metal being aluminum.
1. The starting substrate is an arsenic-doped, 0.005 fi-cm, n-type (100) silicon wafer. A
layer of SiO2 that is 400 nm thick is thermally grown on the substrate in a conven-
tional furnace in a steam O2 ambient at 1100°C. The oxide is used as an etch mask.
The pattern to produce free-standing SCS structures is created using photolithography
in positive photoresist spun on the oxide layer on silicon. A wafer stepper is used
to expose the photoresist. The minimum feature size of the SCS beam structures is
400 nm (see Figure 5.17(a)).
2. The photoresist pattern on the oxide is transferred to the oxide in a CHF3/O2 plasma
etch at flow rates of 30 seem5 and 1 seem, a chamber pressure of 30 mTorr and a
DC self-bias of 470 V in a conventional parallel-plate RIE tool. The etch rate of the
oxide is 23 nm/min. The photoresist on top of the oxide is then stripped off by an
O2 plasma etch (Figure 5.17(b)).
3. The oxide is then transferred to the silicon substrate using a Cl2/BCl3/H2 RIE
in a commercial RIE tool. Three etch steps are required to accomplish a deep
vertical silicon etch (Figure 5.17(c)). The parameters for these etch steps are given
in Table 5.3.

4. Following the silicon etch, a sidewall SiO2 layer of 150 nm is thermally grown
in wet O2 at 1000°C. The thermal oxidation process reduces possible damage
on the sidewalls of the silicon steps created during the Cl2/BCl3/H2 RIE. The
lateral dimensions of the SCS structures are reduced during the thermal oxidation
(Figure 5.17(d)).
5. A 400 nm layer of Al with a step coverage of 60 percent on the sidewalls is
conformably deposited using DC magnetron sputter deposition in a commercial depo-
sition tool. The sputtering is performed at a pressure of 9 mTorr and at a temperature
of 20 °C in argon gas and a beam current of 5 A. Before the Al deposition, contact
windows are opened to allow electrical contact to both the silicon substrate and the
movable silicon structure (see Figure 5.17(e)).
6. After the Al deposition, positive photoresist is spun on the Al layer at 2.5 krpm
for 45 seconds (3.6 urn thick) to fill the 3.8 urn-deep trenches. An Al side-
electrode pattern is created in the resist using a wafer stepper to expose the resist
(Figure 5.17(f)).
7. The Al side-electrode pattern is then transferred to the Al by means of an aluminum
dry-etch process; this step is required to clear the conformal Al layer deposited on the
high steps where the resist has been removed. The etch process is an anisotropic RIE
process that utilises flow rates of 20 sccm of Cl2 and 40 sccm of barium trichloride
(BCl3) at a chamber pressure of 50 mTorr and a DC self-bias voltage of 250 V. The
photolithography and the Al RIE steps produce smooth edges on the Al pattern over
a topography with 3.8 nm steps (Figure 5.17(g)).
8. After the Al electrodes are patterned, the SiO2 is etched back with a CF4 plasma in a
standard parallel-plate RIE tool. Anisotropic etch profiles are preferred to the oxide
etch-back to remove the oxide from the bottom of the trenches but to retain the SiO2
on the top and sidewalls of the SCS structures. Therefore, a low chamber pressure
of 10 mTorr and a high DC self-bias of 600 V are selected in the CF4 RIE process
(Figure 5.17(h)).
5.5 BURIED OXIDE PROCESS
This process is still under development and is based on the separation by the implanted
oxygen (SIMOX) technique that was developed originally to enable the manufacture of
silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers for ICs6. The buried oxide process generates microstruc-
tures by means of exploiting the etching characteristics of a buried layer of SiO2- After
oxygen has been implanted into a silicon substrate using suitable ion-implantation tech-
niques, high-temperature annealing causes the oxygen ions to interact with the silicon to
form a buried layer of SiO2. The remaining thin layer of SCS can still support the growth
of an epitaxial layer of thickness ranging from a few microns to tens of microns.
In micromachining, the buried SiO2 layer is used as an etch-stop. For example, the
etch rate of an etchant such as KOH slows down markedly as the etchant reaches the
SiO2 layer. However, this process has the potential for generating patterned SiO2 buried
layers by appropriately implanting oxygen.

5.6 SILICON FUSION BONDING
The construction of any complicated mechanical device requires not only the machining
of individual components but also the assembly of the components to form a complete
set. In micromachining, bonding techniques are used to assemble individually microma-
chined parts to form a complete structure. Wafer bonding, when used in conjunction with
micromachining techniques, allows the fabrication of three-dimensional structures that are
thicker than a single wafer. Several processes have been developed for bonding silicon
wafers. The most common bonding process is fusion bonding.
In the last decade, several groups (Lasky 1986; Ohashi et al. 1986; Apel et al. 1991)
have demonstrated that the fusion of hydrophilic silicon wafers is possible for obtaining
SOI materials. Since then, wafer-bonding techniques have found different applications
in the field of microelectronics; several static random access memory (SRAM), comple-
mentary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS), and power devices have been fabricated on
bonded SOI material. For micromechanical applications, fusion bonding rendered possible
the fabrication of complex structures by combining two or more patterned wafers. This
section describes the principles of wafer fusion bonding and presents fusion-bonding
processes for MEMS device fabrication.
5.6.1 Wafer Fusion
In its simplest form, the process of wafer fusion bonding is the mating together of a pair
of wafers at room temperature, followed by thermal annealing at temperatures between
700 and 1100°C. At room temperature, the wafers adhere via hydrogen bridge bonds of
chemisorbed water molecules that subsequently react during the annealing process to form
Si—O—Si bonds. Consequently, wafer pretreatment procedures that include hydrophilisa-
tion steps (wet cleaning processes and plasma hydrophilisation) support the process.
A major concern of all bonding processes is the presence of noncontacting areas,
which are generally called voids. Voids are mainly caused by particles, organic residues,
surface defects, and inadequate mating. Therefore, both the surfaces that are fusion-bonded
have to be perfectly smooth and clean because the smallest of particles could cause
large voids. Optimised processing includes wafer surface inspection, surface pretreatment
(hydrophilisation and cleaning), and mechanically controlled, aligned mating in a particle-
free environment.
5.6.2 Annealing Treatment
As discussed in the previous subsection, wafer fusion bonding involves a high-temperature
annealing step that is to be performed after the room-temperature contacting of the
surfaces. This annealing step is necessary to increase the strength of the bond. However,
the high-temperature annealing step (usually at a temperature above 800 °C) may intro-
duce problems, such as doping profile broadening, thermal stresses, defect generation,
and contamination. Annealing also prevents the use of bonding technology for compound
semiconductor materials because their dissociation temperature is often low. In addition,
postmetallisation bonding also requires bonding temperatures that are less than 450 °C as

SILICON FUSION BONDING 
139
most of the common metals that are used in device fabrication melt below this temperature.
Therefore, to make full use of the potential provided by wafer bonding for microstruc-
tures, low-temperature bonding methods have to be developed. Attempts to lower bonding
temperatures and still achieve reasonable bond strength are currently under way.
Three annealing temperature ranges are of interest in wafer bonding:
1. Temperature less than 450°C for postmetallisation wafers.
2. Temperature less than 800 °C for wafers with diffusion dopant layers (e.g. p+ etch-stop
layers).
3. Temperature greater than 1000°C for wafer bonding before processing. According to
the reaction mechanism, annealing at temperatures above 1000°C for several hours
should result in an almost complete reaction of the interface. A 1000 °C anneal for
about two hours gives sufficiently high bond strength for all subsequent treatments
(Harendt et al. 1991); it is not possible to separate the two bonded Si wafers without
breaking the silicon.
An 800 °C anneal results in sufficient bond strength for subsequent processes such as
grinding, polishing, or etching. However, the bonding is incomplete, as suggested by
partial delamination of thinned films after stress treatment (Harendt et al. 1991). The low-
temperature anneal (T < 450 °C) is inadequate for full wafer bonding. Although a signif-
icant increase in bond strength is already measurable after annealing at 200 °C (Kissinger
and Kissinger 1991), additional voids develop during annealing in the temperature range
200 to 700 °C and disappear at higher temperatures. If annealing is interrupted in this
temperature range, these voids remain after cooling; they probably originate from the inter-
facial water, which dissolves and reacts at temperatures above 800 °C. Patterned wafers,
however, have been successfully annealed at 450 °C without the development of additional
voids. In this case, the cavities probably act as buffers for the water. Table 5.4 is taken from
Harendt et al. (1991) and it gives the bond quality for different annealing temperatures.
5.6.3 Fusion of Silicon-Based Materials
Fusion bonding of poly silicon, SiO2, or silicon nitride to silicon proceeds in a manner
similar to silicon-to-silicon bonding. In the case of polysilicon bonding to silicon, a
polishing step for the two surfaces to be bonded is necessary. This polishing step produces

two smooth defect-free surfaces. The bonding mechanism is most probably identical to
silicon-to-silicon fusion bonding in that in both cases, Si—OH groups are present at the
surface. Thus, pretreatment (hydrophilisation) and annealing conditions are similar.
Because of the dissimilar mechanical characteristics of the different bonded materials,
the yield of void-free wafers can be significantly reduced by wafer bow or defects caused
by stress during thermal treatment. Bonding of wafers covered with a thin thermal oxide
or a thin silicon nitride results in homogenous bonded wafers, whereas oxides with thicker
oxide (or nitride) films develop voids during annealing (see Table 5.4).
5.7 ANODIC BONDING
Silicon-to-silicon anodic bonding is a bonding technique used to seal silicon together by
use of a thin sputter-deposited glass layer. The equipment used for anodic bonding is
shown in Figure 5.18. The equipment is basically a heat-chuck element with an electrode
that is capable of supplying high voltage across the structure to be bonded. The system
may automatically control the temperature and power supply during the bonding process.
After surface cleaning and polishing, one of the wafers (referred to here as the top
wafer) is initially given a glass film that is a few microns thick. This glass film is sputtered
on the wafer surface. The top wafer is placed on top of a second silicon wafer, which is
usually referred to as the support wafer (Figure 5.19); these two wafers are to be bonded.
The support wafer rests on the aluminum chuck shown in Figure 5.18. The two wafers
are usually sealed together by anodic bonding at temperatures less than 400 °C with an
electrostatic DC voltage of 50 to 200 V. The negative electrode is connected to the top
sputter-coated wafer. The voltage should be applied over a time that is long enough to
allow the current to settle at the steady-state minimised level. Typically, the bonding
process is terminated within 10 to 20 minutes. The bond process usually takes place in
air at atmospheric pressure.

Objective:
The objective is to fabricate a floating element sensor that consists of a plate
(120 um × 140 urn) and four tethers (30 urn x 10 urn) as shown in Figure 5.20(a)
(Shajii and Schmidt 1992). The tethers work as mechanical supports for the plate and
the resistors in the transduction scheme. The plate and the tethers are made from a 5 um
thick lightly doped n-type silicon layer and are suspended 1.4 um above another silicon
surface as shown in Figure 5.20(b). The entire structure is attached to the lower silicon
wafer at the ends of the tethers using a 1.4 um SiO2 layer.

SILICON MICROMACHINING: BULK
Process Flow: (Figure 5.21)
The fabrication of the sensor involves the processing of two wafers (handle wafer and
device wafer) that are bonded together. The process proceeds as follows:
1. A 1.4 urn thick layer of SiO2 is grown on the handle wafer by wet oxidation at
950 °C. The handle wafer is typically a 4, 10 to 20 £2-cm n-type (100) silicon. Using
photolithography, the oxide on top of the handle wafer is patterned as shown in
Figure 5.21(a). The device wafer has a 5 urn lightly doped n-type (~1015 cm–3)
epitaxial silicon layer grown on top of a highly boron-doped (~1020 cm–3) p+ region
(Figure 5.21 (a)).
2. The front of the handle wafer is bonded to the device wafer. The bonding sequence
includes a preoxidation cleaning of the two wafers, hydration of the bonding surfaces
using a 3:1 H2SO4:H2O2 solution for 10 minutes, a deionised water rinse, spin dry,
physical contact of the two bonding surfaces, and a high-temperature anneal (1000°C
in dry O2) for 70 minutes. The device wafer is then thinned in a KOH:H2O (20 percent
KOH by weight at 57 °C) solution until approximately 40 um of silicon remains. A
solution of CsOH:H2O (60 percent CsOH by weight at 60 °C) is used to stop on
the p+ layer because of its better etch-stop characteristics for heavily boron-doped

silicon in comparison with KOH. The p+ layer is subsequently removed using a
8:3:1 CH3COOH:HNO3:HF liquid etch. A brown stain, indicating porous silicon,
resulting from the etch is removed using a mixture of 97:3 HNO3:HF solution for
about 15 seconds leaving a 5 um-thick silicon epilayer bonded to the patterned oxide
(Figure 5.2 l(b)).
3. A masked implant (as at 80 keV and 7 x 1015 cm–2 dose) followed by a one-hour
anneal at 850 °C in dry O2 ambient is performed for better ohmic contact. Sensing
tethers are not implanted and their concentration remains at approximately 1015 cm–3.
Following the implant anneal, 500 nm of Al is deposited using electron-beam deposi-
tion, patterned and sintered in N2 ambient at 375 °C for 30 minutes (Figure 5.21(c)).
4. A thin layer of plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) amorphous
silicon (500 nm) is deposited over the wafer to protect the aluminum in the subsequent
processing steps. A 1 um-thick PECVD oxide is then deposited and patterned using a
CF4/CHF3/He plasma etch. This oxide will act as an etch mask for the silicon trench
etch that is used to define the floating element. The oxide is plasma-etched and the
resist is subsequently removed (Figure 5.21(d)).
5. A CCl4-based plasma etch is used to trench-etch the silicon. A BOE (7:1 H2O:HF
is used to etch the PECVD oxide that remains after the silicon trench etch, thus
completing the fabrication of the floating element. Electrical contacts are made
through the amorphous silicon layer to the Al bonding pads either by mechan-
ical probing or by ultrasonic wire bonding. The completed sensor is shown in
Figure 5.2 l(e).
5.8 CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this chapter, we have described the process involved in bulk silicon micromachining
that is used to fashion microstructures out of silicon wafers, including a discussion of
etching and etch-stops, followed by a discussion of the bonding together of two wafers
to make the complete microdevices. Several worked examples are considered to illustrate
the role of the various processes.
The alternative approach is that of surface rather than bulk silicon micromachining.
This topic is covered in the next chapter, again with worked examples of microstruc-
tures. Together, bulk and surface micromachining represent the two key technologies that
are essential for the manufacture of many different types of silicon microsensors and
microactuators today.

6.1 INTRODUCTION
Since the beginning of the 1980s, much interest has been directed toward micromechanical
structures fabricated by a technique called surface micromachining. The resulting two-and-
a-half-dimensional structures1 are mainly located on the surface of a silicon wafer and exist
as a thin film - hence the half dimension. The dimensions of these surface-micromachined
structures can be an order of magnitude smaller than the bulk-micromachined structures.
The main advantage of surface-micromachined structures is their easy integration with
integrated circuit (IC) components, as the same wafer surface can also be processed
for IC elements. However, as miniaturisation is immensely increased by silicon surface
micromachining, the small sizes or masses that are created are often insufficient for viable
sensors and, particularly, for actuators. The problem is most acute in capacitive mechanical
microsensors (Section 8.4) and especially in capacitively driven microactuators because
of the low coupling capacitances. Deep etching techniques, such as lithography, electro-
plating, and moulding process (LIGA), have been developed to address this problem but
are difficult to realise in silicon.
There are several common approaches to the making of microelectromechanical system
(MEMS) devices using surface micromachining. The first of these approaches is the
sacrificial layer technology for the realisation of mechanical microstructures. The second
approach incorporates IC technology and wet anisotropic etching and the third approach
uses plasma etching to fabricate microstructures at the silicon wafer surface. These
approaches are illustrated in this chapter by a set of ten worked examples that cover a
range of microsensor and MEMS devices from cantilever beams, resonant comb structures
through to micromotors.
6.2 SACRIFICIAL LAYER TECHNOLOGY
Sacrificial layer technology uses, in most situations, polycrystalline rather than single-
crystal silicon as the structural material for the fabrication of microstructures. Low-
pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD) of polysilicon (poly-Si) is well known
1 Full three-dimensional structures can now be made using microstereolithography; this important technology
is discussed in Chapter 7.

in standard IC technologies (see Chapter 4) and has excellent mechanical properties that
are similar to those of single-crystalline silicon2. When polycrystalline silicon is used as
the structural layer, sacrificial layer technology normally employs silicon dioxide (SiO2)
as the sacrificial material, which is employed during the fabrication process to realise
some microstructure but does not constitute any part of the final miniature device.
In sacrificial layer technology, the key processing steps are as follows:
1. Deposition and patterning of a sacrificial SiO2 layer on the substrate
2. Deposition and definition of a poly-Si film
3. Removal of the sacrificial oxide by lateral etching in hydrofluoric acid (HF), that is,
etching away of the oxide underneath the poly-Si structure
Here, we refer to poly-Si and SiO2 as the structural and sacrificial materials, respectively.
The reason for doing this is that in almost all practical situations this is the preferred
choice of material combination. However, other material combinations are also being
used in surface micromachining, some of which are discussed in Section 6.3.
6.2.1 Simple Process
The simplest of surface-micromachining processes involves just one poly-Si layer and
one oxide layer. This process is a one-mask process and is illustrated in Figure 6.1 in
which it is designed to form a poly-Si cantilever anchored to a Si substrate by means of
an oxide layer. The oxide sacrificial layer is deposited first (Figure 6.1 (a)). The poly-Si
structural layer is then deposited on top of the oxide. Next, the poly-Si layer is patterned,
forming both the cantilever beam and the anchor region (Figure 6.1(b)). Following the
poly-Si patterning step, the cantilever beam is released by laterally etching the oxide in
an HF solution. The oxide etch needs to be timed so that the anchor region is not etched
away (Figure 6.1(c)).
To implement successfully the process described in the preceding paragraph, the release
etch must be very carefully controlled. If the release etch is continued for too long a period,
the anchor region will be completely cut, resulting in device failure. However, to avoid
such a failure, the process may be extended to a two-mask process in which the poly-
Si cantilever is directly anchored to the substrate. This two-mask process is shown in
Figure 6.2. In this process, the deposited oxide (Figure 6.2(a)) is patterned for an anchor
opening by the first mask (Figure 6.2(b)). This is followed by a conformal deposition of
poly-Si and subsequent patterning of the poly-Si cantilever beam using the second mask
(Figure 6.2(c)). The cantilever is then released by a lateral oxide etch in HF solution
(Figure 6.2(d)). Because the anchor region in this case is made out of poly-Si, the oxide
release etch poses no threat of device failure.
Modifications of these simple one-mask and two-mask processes are the addition of
bushings (or dimples) and/or an insulating layer between the cantilever and the substrate.
The process with an added bushing is shown in Figure 6.3. An additional mask is
needed to pattern the bushing mould in either the one-mask or in the two-mask process
(Figure 6.3(b)). Because of the difference in depth between the bushing mould and the

anchor hole, it is not possible to pattern both openings simultaneously using the same
mask. The preferable mask sequence for the patterning of the two openings is first the
patterning of the bushing mould followed by the anchor region definition since the latter
opening is the deepest of the openings. The rest of the process proceeds as described in
the one-mask and two-mask processes.
The process in which an insulating layer is incorporated between the cantilever and
substrate is illustrated in Worked Example 6.1. The insulating layer that works very well
with the poly-Si-oxide combination is silicon nitride (see also Section 6.3). This process
and three other worked examples are now presented in turn:
• Freestanding polysilicon beam
• Linear motion microactuator
• Rotor on a centre-pin bearing
• Rotor on a flange bearing
Worked Example E6.1A: Freestanding Poly-Si Beam
Objective (A):
The objective is to fabricate a poly-Si freestanding beam that rests on the surface of a
silicon wafer but is raised above it by a silicon nitride-insulating step.
Process Flow (A):
A layer of silicon nitride is first deposited by LPCVD on the surface of a silicon wafer
(Figure 6.4(a)). The thickness of the nitride film corresponds to the height of the step
on which the freestanding beam base is to rest. This nitride film also acts as a protective
layer for the silicon substrate. A layer of sacrificial SiO2 is then deposited by chemical
vapour deposition (CVD) on top of the nitride layer (Figure 6.4(b)) and patterned as
shown in Figure 6.4(c). This patterned oxide island is of a thickness that is equal to the
height above the nitride-layer surface of the freestanding beam. Poly-Si is then deposited
by LPCVD on the patterned oxide as shown in Figure 6.4(d). When the sacrificial SiO2
island is laterally etched, the freestanding beam shown in Figure 6.4(e) is finally created.

Figure 6.4 Process flow for a freestanding polysilicon cantilever beam anchored to a silicon
substrate via an insulating nitride layer
Worked Example E6.1B: Freestanding Poly-Si Beam3
Objective (B):
The objective is to fabricate a poly-Si freestanding beam that rests on the surface of a
silicon wafer and is on the same level as a nitride layer that has been deposited on top
of the silicon wafer.
Process Flow (B):
This second procedure for beam fabrication is based on the localised oxide isolation of
silicon (LOCOS) process in which windows are opened in silicon nitride on the silicon
substrate and, subsequently, thermal SiO2 is grown in the openings (Figure 6.5(a)). Using
this patterned SiO2 as a sacrificial layer allows the construction of planar poly-Si beams.
For details see Linder et al. (1992).

that is, the beam is on the same level as the surrounding nitride layer (Figure 6.5(b)).
However, oxide growth also occurs underneath the nitride at the edges of the windows
and thereby pushes up the nitride mask - this is called the 'bird's beak effect.' As a
consequence of this effect, steps in the form of spikes are created at the edges of the
LOCOS poly-Si beams Figure 6.5(b).
Worked Example E6.2: Linear-Motion Microactuator4
Objective:
The use of piezoelectric materials for microactuators is receiving increasing attention as
an alternative to electrostatic-based and thermal-based actuation. Perceived advantages
of piezoelectric materials include greater energy densities, lower operating voltages, and
greater force-generating capabilities than electrostatic actuators. Piezoelectric materials
also have faster response times and greater efficiency than thermal actuators. The objec-
tive in this example is to fabricate the linear actuator shown in Figure 6.6(a) and (b).
The linear-motion actuator uses folded-path geometry as seen in the figure. When a
voltage is applied to the dual electrodes on the top surface of a piezoelectric thin film
of lead zirconium titanate (PZT), the PZT either expands or contracts along its length,
depending on the polarity of its voltage with respect to the poly-Si layer. The alternating
expansion and contraction from one bar to the next and the mechanical series connection
of the bars cause the net change in the length of each bar to add to that of the other bars
(Figure 6.6(b)). This cumulative effect permits a substantial increase in the actuation
range of this type of device.
Process Flow:
The process flow is shown in Figure 6.7.
1. The process starts with the deposition and patterning of the sacrificial material (SiO2)
as shown in Figure 6.7(a).
2. This is followed by the deposition of a poly-Si layer as the structural layer. The
poly-Si layer is then patterned as shown in Figure 6.7(b).
3. The poly-Si deposition and patterning is followed by a deposition and patterning of
PZT (see Figure 6.7(c)).
4. The fourth step is to deposit and pattern the metal electrodes (Figure 6.7(d)), followed
by an etch in HF solution to remove the sacrificial oxide (Figure 6.7(e)) and release
the mechanical microstructure.
6.2.2 Sacrificial Layer Processes Utilising more than One
Structural Layer
The worked examples described in Section 6.2.1 use only one structural (poly-Si) and
one sacrificial layer (SiO2). However, in principle, a surface-micromachining process may
comprise more than one structural layer and more than one sacrificial layer. Descriptions
of processes with more than one structural or sacrificial layer are given in the following

Process Flow:
Cross-sectional schematics of the process are shown in Figure 6.8:
1. The process starts with the deposition of an oxide layer as the first sacrificial layer
on which the bushing moulds are patterned (Figure 6.8(a)).
2. Following the patterning of the first oxide layer, the first poly-Si structural layer
is conformably deposited and patterned using the second mask as shown in
Figure 6.8(b). The bushings are formed automatically on the deposition of the poly-Si
layer. These bushings are often necessary to prevent stiction to the substrate when
the structure undergoes the sacrificial oxide wet-etching process.
3. Another oxide layer is deposited. This second oxide layer is also used as a sacrificial
layer. The second and the first oxide layers are patterned using a third mask that

carries the bearing anchor opening (Figure 6.8(c)). Note that at this stage of the
process, the poly-Si rotor is totally encased within the two oxide layers.
4. The second poly-Si structural layer is then deposited and patterned using the fourth
mask. This step defines the centre bearing as shown in Figure 6.8(d).
5. The rotor is finally released by etching the two sacrificial oxide layers in HF solution.
A top view of the rotor structure is shown in Figure 6.9.
Worked Example E6.4: Rotor on a Flange Bearing6
Objective:
The objective is to fabricate a poly-Si disk-shaped rotor that is free to rotate about a
poly-Si flange bearing.
Process Flow:
The process flow here is very similar to that in Worked Example 6.3 and uses only
minor modifications to those processes already described. A cross-sectional view of the
process is shown in Figure 6.10.
1. As in Worked Example 6.3, the process starts with the deposition of an oxide as the
first sacrificial layer. This step is followed by the deposition and patterning of the
first poly-Si structural layer as shown in Figure 6.10(a).
2. Using the second mask, the first sacrificial oxide is under-etched for flange formation;
this is schematically shown in Figure 6.10(b).
3. The second oxide sacrificial layer is then deposited conformably and the bearing
anchor region is patterned using the third mask (Figure 6.10(c)).
4. The poly-Si second structural layer is then deposited and the bearing is patterned. The
flange in the bearing forms automatically upon deposition of the second poly-Si layer
(Figure 6.10(d)). Following this step, the two sacrificial oxide layers are dissolved
in an HF solution. When released, the rotor rests on the bearing flange and does not
come in contact with the substrate. The rotor now slides on the flange as it rotates.

6.3 MATERIAL SYSTEMS IN SACRIFICIAL LAYER
TECHNOLOGY
An important consideration in the fabrication of an ideal mechanical microstructure is that
it is without any residual mechanical stress, so that the films deposited have no significant
residual strain. In particular, doubly supported freestanding structures will buckle in the
presence of a relatively modest residual compressive strain in the structural material. By
choosing the appropriate deposition conditions and by optimising the annealing step, an
almost strain-free structural material layer can be obtained7.
Surface micromachining requires a compatible set of structural materials, sacrificial
materials, and chemical etchants. The structural materials must possess the physical and
chemical properties that are suitable for the desired application. In addition, the structural
materials must have appropriate mechanical properties, such as high yield and fracture
strengths, minimal creep and fatigue, and good wear-resistance. The sacrificial materials
' Test structures are normally placed on the wafers to measure the actual strain.

156 
SILICON MICROMACHINING: SURFACE
must also have good mechanical properties to avoid device failure during the fabrication
process. These properties include good adhesion and a low residual stress to eliminate
device failure by delamination and/or cracking. The etchants must have excellent etch
selectivity and must be able to etch off the sacrificial materials without affecting the
structural ones. In addition, the etchants must also have appropriate viscosity and surface
tension characteristics.
Some of the common material systems that are used in surface micromachining are
discussed in the following three sections, followed by one worked example (a silicon
condenser microphone).
6.3.1 Polycrystalline Silicon and Silicon Dioxide
This material system has already been mentioned in Section 6.1. The poly-Si/oxide mate-
rial system is the most common one and uses the poly-Si deposited by LPCVD as the
structural material and the thermally grown (or LPCVD) oxide as the sacrificial mate-
rial. The oxide is readily dissolved in HF solution without the poly-Si being affected.
Silicon nitride is often used together with this material system for electrical insulation.
The advantages of this material system include the following:
1. Both poly-Si and SiO2 are used in 1C processing; therefore, their deposition technolo-
gies are readily available.
2. Poly-Si has excellent mechanical properties and can be doped for various electrical
applications. Doping not only modifies the electrical properties but can also modify
the mechanical properties of poly-Si. For example, the maximum mechanically sound
length of a freestanding beam is significantly larger for phosphorus-doped as compared
with undoped poly-Si8. However, in most cases, the maximum length attainable is
limited by the tendency of the beam to stick to the substrate.
3. The oxide can be thermally grown and deposited by CVD over a wide range of
temperatures (from about 200 to 1200°C), which is very useful for various processing
requirements. However, the quality of oxide will vary with deposition temperature.
4. The material system is compatible with 1C processing. Both poly-Si and SiO2 are
standard materials for IC devices. This commonality makes them highly desirable in
sacrificial layer technology applications that demand integrated electronics.
6.3.2 Polyimide and Aluminum
In this second material system, the polymer 'polyimide' is used for the structural material,
whereas aluminum is used for the sacrificial material. Acid-based aluminum etchants are
used to dissolve the aluminum sacrificial layer. The three main advantages of this material
system are as follows:
8 Caution is needed when doping because it can induce a significant amount of stress.

157
1. Polyimide has a small elastic modulus, which is about 50 times smaller than that of
polycrystalline silicon.
2. Polyimide can take large strains before fracture.
3. Both polyimide and aluminum can be prepared at relatively low temperatures
(<400°C).
However, the main disadvantage of this material system lies with polyimide in that it
has unfavourable viscoelastic characteristics (i.e. it tends to creep), and so devices may
exhibit considerable parametric drift.
6.3.3 Silicon Nitride/Polycrystalline Silicon and
Tungsten/Silicon Dioxide
In the third material system of silicon nitride/poly-Si, silicon nitride is used as the struc-
tural material and poly-Si as the sacrificial material. For this material system, silicon
anisotropic etchants such as potassium hydroxide (KOH) and ethylenediarnine pyrocate-
chol (EDP) are used to dissolve the poly-Si9.
In the fourth material system of tungsten/oxide, tungsten deposited by CVD is used as
the structural material with the oxide as the sacrificial material. Here again, HF solution
is used to remove the sacrificial oxide.
Finally, we give a worked example in which silicon nitride is employed as the structural
material as before but as a variant and, unusually, aluminum is used as the sacrificial layer
instead of poly-Si.
Worked Example E6.5: Silicon Condenser Microphone10
Objective:
The objective is to fabricate a silicon condenser microphone using silicon nitride as the
structural layer and aluminum as the sacrificial layer. In this case, gold is used to make
the electrical tracks.
Process Flow:
1. First, the backside and polished front side of a silicon wafer are covered with 1.8 jim
and 0.45 |um thermal oxides, respectively. A square window is then etched on the
oxide on the backside. A sacrificial layer of aluminum about 1.0 urn thick is then
evaporated onto the polished front side of the wafer and patterned, followed by
plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) of 1.3 urn of silicon nitride
(Figure 6.11 (a)).
2. The diaphragm-to-be silicon nitride film is provided with a 30 nm titanium adhesion
layer and a 30-nm gold electrode. Holes and V-grooves are then etched anisotropically
from the backside using KOH, and the KOH etch stops at the SiO2 etch-stop layer
(Figure 6.1 l(b)).
9 Details of these etches are given in Section 2.4.
10 For details see Scheeper et al. (1992).

3. The SiO2 etch-stop is finally removed in an HF solution. Subsequently, the aluminum
sacrificial layer is etched in an H3PO4/HNO3/CH3COOH/H2O mixture at 50 °C to
yield the microphone shown in Figure 6.11 (c).
6.4 SURFACE MICROMACHINING USING PLASMA
ETCHING
Surface micromachining can also be realised using a dry-etching process rather than a wet-
etching process. Plasma etching of the silicon substrate, with SFe/CVbased and CF4H2-
based gas mixtures, is advantageous because high selectivities for photoresist silicon
dioxide and aluminum masks can be achieved. However, when using plasma etching, a
large undercut of the mask is generally produced. This is due to the isotropic fluorine atom
etching of silicon that is known to be high compared with the vertical etch induced by ion
bombardment. In contrast, reactive ion etching (REE) of poly-Si using a chlorine-fluorine
gas combination produces virtually no undercut and produces almost vertical etch profiles
with photoresist used as the masking material. Thus, rectangular silicon patterns, which
are up to 30 urn deep, can be formed using chlorine-fluorine plasmas out of poly-Si
films and the Si wafer surface. A deep etch process is essential for microactuators and,
therefore, the deep RIE process is an attractive option. Here, we illustrate its use to make
two MEMS devices:

Centre-pin-bearing side-drive micromotor
Gap comb-drive resonant actuator
Worked Example E6.6: Centre-Pin-Bearing Side-Drive Micromotor11
Objective:
The objective is to fabricate a centre-pin, variable-capacitance, and side-drive micro-
motor, such as the salient-pole and wobble types.
Process Flow:
The flow process in this case adds to what has already been described in the previous
Worked Examples 6.3 and 6.4. The rotor is the main component of the micromotor;
however, we also need to incorporate stator poles to form the micromotor. A variable-
capacitance side-drive micromotor clearly requires electrically conducting materials for
both the rotor and the stator. Heavy doping of the poly-Si with phosphorus to form n-type
poly-Si satisfies this requirement. In addition, the stator poles need to be electrically
isolated from the substrate, the rotor, and one another. This electrical isolation is achieved
by LPCVD of an insulating silicon nitride layer. Figures 6.12 and 6.13 show the top
and the cross-sectional views, respectively, of the salient-pole and wobble micromotors.
The process flow is shown in Figure 6.14 and runs as follows:
1. First, an insulation bilayer that consists of 1 um silicon-rich silicon nitride is deposited
by LPCVD over a 1 um thermally grown oxide and it completely covers it. This
insulation bilayer is required to survive the release etching and to withstand high
voltages during the operation of the micromotor. The etch rate of silicon-rich silicon
nitride in HF solution is negligibly small compared with that of the oxide. Also,

the bilayer insulation structure proves to be very effective in eliminating electrical
breakdown through the substrate and permits operating voltages of up to about 250 V
on the stator poles.
2. The second step is to deposit a 0.35 um-thick heavily doped poly-Si and pattern
the poly-Si layer to form the shield. This step is followed by the deposition of the
first thermal low-temperature oxide (LTO) sacrificial layer, which is subsequently
patterned for the bushings and stator anchors as shown in Figure 6.14(a).
3. A 2.5 um-thick poly-Si layer is deposited and heavily doped with phosphorus. Phos-
phorus doping is achieved using POC13 at 950 °C. The poly-Si is patterned by RIE
to form the rotor, stator, and air gaps (Figure 6.14(b)). In the RIE process, a 0.5 (am

thermal oxide is used as an etch mask. The final rotor-stator poly-Si thickness is
2.2 urn because of the thermal oxidation used for the mask formation.
4. A second sacrificial LTO layer is grown; this provides 0.3 |im of LTO coverage on
the rotor and stator sidewalls and approximately 0.5 urn of LTO coverage on the top
surfaces. The bearing anchor is then defined and etched through the two sacrificial
oxide layers down to the electric shield below (Figure 6.14(c)).
5. A 1 urn-thick poly-Si layer is deposited, heavily doped with phosphorus, and then
patterned to form the bearing as shown in Figure 6.14(d). At this point, the completed
device is immersed in HF solution to dissolve the sacrificial LTOs and release the
rotor.
Worked Example E6.7: Gap Comb-Drive Resonant Actuator12
Objective:
Comb-drive actuators are widely used, as their output force is easily controlled by the
applied voltage, and the output force required to drive passive structures is extracted more
easily than that from rotational actuators. A top view of the resonator to be fabricated is
shown in Figure 6.15. The drive force of the actuator is obtained by applying a voltage
between the stator and the drive electrodes; this force is inversely proportional to the
gap width between the electrodes. Therefore, reducing the gap width between the two
electrodes is the most effective means of reducing the high drive voltage greater than
25 V that is normally required.
Process Flow:
It is widely acknowledged that masking precisely controlled submicron gaps from thick
poly-Si (e.g. ~4 urn as used in this example) using commonly available lithography
and etching systems is not an easy process. The process flow described subsequently

Figure 6.16 Process flow to fabricate the gap comb-drive resonant actuator in Figure 6.15
outlines a method of fabricating submicron gaps for comb-drive actuators called oxida-
tion machining. The process flow for the actuator's fabrication is depicted in Figure 6.16.
1. A 4 um-thick poly-Si (doped by ion implantation and annealed at 1100°C for 1 hour)
is deposited by LPCVD on top of a 2.5 um thermally grown oxide on the substrate. A
250 nm-thick silicon nitride layer is then deposited by LPCVD over poly-Si, which
protects the top surface during the thermal oxidation step. Finally, a 100 nm-thick
nickel layer is deposited by vacuum evaporation (Figure 6.16(a)).
2. The shape of the actuator is patterned on the nickel, followed by the wet etching of
the nickel film. Using the nickel pattern as a mask, Si3N4 and poly-Si are RIE-etched
in SF6 (Figure 6.16(b)).
3. After the removal of the nickel mask, the wafer is cut into 1 cm2 pieces and the
poly-Si is thermally oxidised (Figure 6.16(c)).
4. Figure 6.16(d) shows the actuator's cross section after it is released in HF solution.
6.5 COMBINED 1C TECHNOLOGY AND ANISOTROPIC
WET ETCHING
Anisotropic wet etching may be combined with an 1C process to fabricate freestanding
multilayer microstructures without additional masks. Its main merits are low cost and
compatibility with standard 1C processing. In the first phase, the multilayers are created
using 1C processing. Usually, the multilayer is composed of the standard insulating and

COMBINED 1C TECHNOLOGY AND ANISOTROPIC WET ETCHING
163
passivating dielectric films, poly-Si layers, and metal layers. The poly-Si and metal layers
constitute the active layers and are usually sandwiched between the dielectric films that
are necessary for electrical insulation and component passivation. By special design,
windows are opened around the multilayer structures for removal of all dielectric layers,
thus exposing the silicon surface underneath.
In the second so-called postprocessing phase, the wafers are immersed in anisotropic
silicon etchants. Thus, the exposed silicon surface around the multilayer structure is
removed, and by under-etching, the microstructures finally become freestanding. Because
the active layers are completely contained within the dielectric layers, they are protected
against the silicon-etching process.
An alternative approach is to etch anisotropically only the backside of the wafer, that
is, use a single-sided etching bath. This technique may be used to make certain structures
but tends to be a more time-consuming, and therefore, a more costly process. A worked
example is now provided.
Worked Example E6.8: Integration of Air Gap Capacitor Pressure Sensor and
Digital Readout13
Objective:
To fabricate a microstructure that consists of a top plate separated by a small air gap and
a bottom plate that has an inlet for pressurised gas (Figure 6.17). The gas pressure moves
the top plate upward, increasing the gap, and hence decreasing the capacitance. Metal
oxide semiconductor (MOS) electronics14 are integrated next to the capacitive sensor.

Process Flow (A): Front Side Processing
1. The starting p-type silicon wafer is 500 urn thick, of resistivity 15 to 20 fi-cm, and
of (100) orientation. An n-channel metal oxide semiconductor (NMOS) process is
performed up to the patterning and etching of the poly-Si transistor gates, reoxidation,
and junction drive-in of the source-drain regions (Figure 6.18(a)).
2. A 50 nm oxide layer is deposited by LPCVD at 400 °C, followed by a back strip of
the oxide and a p+ boron backside implant (BF2 at a concentration of ~7 x 1015
and energy of ~30 keV) to yield a good backside ohmic contact required for the
NMOS. Then, 150 nm of Si3N4 is deposited by LPCVD at 800 °C, patterned, and
plasma-etched using SFe (Figure 6.18(b)). The 50 nm oxide is an etch-stop for the
Si3N4 etch.

165
3. About 600 nm of borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG) is deposited at 400 °C. BPSG
serves as an interlevel dielectric between the poly-Si gate and metal and is also a
sacrificial layer that sets the gap. The BPSG is then patterned and plasma-etched using
CF4 that is timed to stop at Si3N4 because CF4 also etches Si3N4 (Figure 6.18(c)).
4. A 1 um layer of poly-Si is deposited by LPCVD at 625 °C, doped with phosphorus
using a POC13 source at 925 °C, and the phosphorus glass wet-etched. A front-coat
resist is applied and a backside poly-Si plasma etch is performed using SFf, stopping
on the BPSG layer. The poly-Si layer serves as the top plate of the air gap capacitor
and is patterned or plasma-etched in CC14 (Figure 6, 1 8(d)).
5. After etching, the process returns to a normal back-end MOS process that consists
of patterning or etching contact cuts into the BPSG, followed by a sputter deposition
of aluminum (with 1 percent Si) to a thickness of 1.1 um. The metal is patterned,
plasma-etched, and sintered to complete the front-side processing (Figure 6.18(e)).
The contact to the n+ bottom plate is made via n+ diffusion channels contacted by
the metal that surrounds the diaphragm. Contact to the poly-Si is made directly via
metal on top of a tab that protrudes from the square structure.
Process Flow (B): Backside Processing
1 . Back-to-front infrared alignment is made via two mask-plates in a double-sided mask
aligner. After photolithography, the backside is plasma-etched in CH4, removing both
the BPSG and the nitride in one step.
2. The wafer is then immersed in KOH/DI water solution at 80 °C using a custom-
designed one-sided etching system. The one-sided etching apparatus is critical
because the front circuits would be destroyed without it (Figure 6.19(a)).
3. Finally, this is followed by a one-sided HF etching of

SILICON MICROMACHINING: SURFACE
6.6 PROCESSES USING BOTH BULK AND SURFACE
MICROMACHINING
It is clearly possible to fabricate a variety of microsensor and MEMS devices using either
solely bulk-micromachining techniques or surface-micromachining techniques. Some of
these devices have been described here via worked examples, and a large number other
devices have been described in the literature (Gardner 1994).
However, all such devices suffer from limitations that are inherent in one or the other
of these two techniques. Taking advantages of the fabrication possibilities offered by bulk-
and surface-micromachining techniques and combining the two techniques in fabricating
MEMS devices opens up new opportunities for the fabrication of a new class of MEMS
devices that are not possible to fabricate using either of the technique alone. Several
devices have been fabricated using a combination of bulk- and surface-micromachining
processes. Two of these devices are now described in the Worked Examples 6.9 and 6.10.
Worked Example E6.9: Micronozzles15
Objective:
Micronozzles are important in a variety of optical instruments and micromechanical
devices, for example, beam-defining elements, high-resolution ink-jet printing heads,
microvalves, and flow controllers16. The objective in this example is to fabricate a
silicon nitride nozzle with a submicron aperture.
Process Flow:
The process flow used in micromachining the micronozzle is depicted in Figure 6.20.
1. The fabrication process starts with a lightly doped (100) Si wafer onto which a
composite layer of SisN4 and SiO2, 160 nm and 500 nm thick, respectively, is
deposited. The nitride and oxide are then plasma-etched to form a circular 3 \im-
diameter mask (Figure 6.20(a)).
2. Using this mask, the Si is dry-etched to form the Si moulds for the nozzle. The plasma
etch is chosen such that the etch is semianisotropic for an etch depth of approximately
3.5 nm and a sideways undercutting of approximately 5 nm (Figure 6.20(b)). The
oxide mask is first etched in an HF solution and then the nitride mask is removed by
further etching Si in a wet isotropic etch that fully undercuts the nitride mask.
3. The next step is to coat the Si moulds in Si3N4 to form the nozzles. A thin (few tens
of nanometers) layer of padding SiO2 is deposited, followed by LPCVD of about
350 to 550 nm of Si3N4. The deposited layers are highly conformal, replicating even
the high-cusped moulds (Figure 6.20(c)). A second layer of SiC»2 is deposited over
the nitride. This layer serves as a protective layer for the fine mould tips.
4. To define the nozzle aperture, Si3N4 has to be etched back to expose the required
portion of the Si mould. This is accomplished by coating the surface with a thick

a predetermined time to expose the required height of the covered tip to give the
desired nozzle diameter. This step is followed by the etching of the oxide and the
exposed nitride layers (Figure 6.20(d)).
5. The nozzles are finally made freestanding by etching away the Si mould and part
of the substrate in KOH followed by a back-sawing technique (Figure 6.20(e)), or a
back-masked anisotropic etching (Figure 6.20(f)).
Worked Example E6.10: Overhanging Microgripper17
Objective:
A top view and a cross-sectional view of the microgripper are shown in Figures 6.21 and
6.22, respectively. The objective is to fabricate a poly-Si microgripper that overhangs
from a support cantilever beam that itself protrudes from a silicon die, which serves as
the base for the gripper structure. The cantilever is approximately 12 um thick, 500 um
long, and tapered from a 400 um width at the base to 100 um width at the end. This
support cantilever accurately locates the overhanging poly-Si microgripper and provides
a thin extender for the unit. The poly-Si microgripper is 2.5 um thick and 400 um long.
For details, see Kim et al. (1992).

It consists of a closure driver and two drive arms that connect to arms that extend to the
gripper jaws. The beam widths for the drive arms and comb teeth are 2 um, whereas
that for the closure drive is 10 um to provide relative rigidity. When a voltage is applied
between the closure driver and drive arms, the drive arms move and close the gripper
jaws. Note that the drive arms are at the same electrical potential; this avoids any current
flowing between the gripper jaws when they are fully closed and possibly affects the
actuation process.
Process Flow:
The process flow for the microgripper's fabrication is shown in Figure 6.23.
1. Using thermally grown oxide as a mask, boron is diffused at 125 °C for 15 hours
from a solid dopant source. The oxide mask and the borosilicate glass (BSG) grown
during diffusion are subsequently removed (Figure 6.23(a)).
2. A 2 um thick phosphosilicate glass (PSG) is deposited by LPCVD, followed by
LPCVD of 2.5 urn-thick undoped poly-Si deposited at 605 °C. The poly-Si is then
patterned by RIE in CC14 plasma. This step defines the patterns of the gripper
and conducting lines. The poly-Si on the wafer backside is subsequently removed
(Figure 6.23(b)).
3. Three 2 um PSG film depositions are made to produce a 6 urn-thick film. These
three PSG films and the bottom film are the phosphorus source for diffusion into

the sandwiched poly-Si layer and they also protect poly-Si during subsequent bulk
micromachining. Each coating is followed by a one-hour, 1000 °C anneal to drive
phosphorus into poly-Si. To make a front-to-back alignment, an alignment window
is formed by patterning the PSG on the front side followed by anisotropic etching in
EDP (Figure 6,23(c)).
4. Break lines are patterned on the PSG around the poly-Si gripper area. These prede-
termined break lines effectively prevent any crack in the PSG membrane from
propagating to the gripper arms. The PSG on the back wafer can be positioned and
patterned in the last masking step. This step is followed by etching in EDP. Convex
corners are attached and rounded during the etching. The break lines of the PSG also
serve as etching holes on the wafer front side when etched in EDP (Figure 6.23(d)).

A final timed etch of sacrificial PSG fully exposes the overhanging poly-Si micro

6.7 ADHESION PROBLEMS IN SURFACE
MICROMACHINING
After sacrificial layer removal in surface micromachining, the wafers are normally rinsed
in deionised (DI) water and dried. The surface tension of the water under the structures
pulls them down to the surface of the wafer and, in some cases, causes them to adhere
permanently to the wafer surface; this is illustrated in Figure 6.24(a) and (b). This adhesion
problem is one of the major problems in surface micromachining and it accounts for almost
90 percent of surface-micromachined structure failures. The problem can be avoided by
using thick structural and sacrificial layers; however, this is only possible when the design
allows thick layers to be used. In many MEMS applications, the use of very thin layers
of structural and sacrificial materials is often necessitated by the design of the device(s).
If longer or thin beams or plates are needed, there are several options to prevent
adhesion. One option, as mentioned earlier, is to place small bumps on the bottom surface
of the plates to give them a tendency to pull back off the substrate (Figure 6.25). If the
spacing of the bumps (also known as dimples) is close enough, the central portion of
the plate will in fact never touch the substrate. This critical spacing is a function of
the structural and sacrificial layers. For a 2 um layer, the minimum dimple spacing is
approximately estimated to be 50 um.
There are several other methods of adhesion prevention, and these methods rely on
avoiding the problem of surface tension. The following three methods are among the most
commonly used methods:
1. Freeze drying (sublimation) of the final rinsing solution; for example, DI water or
/-butyl alcohol (Guckel et al. 1990).

SILICON MICROMACHINING: SURFACE
6.8 SURFACE VERSUS BULK MICROMACHINING
In this chapter and the previous one, we have described the use of bulk and surface
micromachining to fabricate microsensors and MEMS devices. Table 6.1 summarises
the relative advantages and disadvantages of these two technologies. Perhaps the most
attractive feature is whether the technique may be readily combined with a standard 1C
process - ideally as simple pre- or postprocessing steps. In this respect, a front side surface
micromachining is perhaps the most attractive current option. However, the possibility
of a front side bulk etch of a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) CMOS device may become a
cost-effective and desirable option in the near future. The use of a micromachined SOI
membrane to make a smart gas sensor is discussed later (Section 15.2).

7.1 INTRODUCTION
Stereolithography (SL) was introduced in 1981 by different teams in the USA (Hull 1984),
Europe (Andre et al. 1984), and Japan (Kodama 1981). SL is a rapid prototyping, and
manufacturing technology that enables the generation of physical objects directly from
computer-aided design (CAD) data files.
The stereolithographic process begins with the definition of a CAD model of the
desired object, followed by a slicing of the three-dimensional (3-D) model into a series
of closely spaced horizontal planes that represent the x-y cross sections of the 3-D object,
each with a slightly different z coordinate value. All the 3-D models are next translated
into numerical control code and merged together into a final build file to control the
ultraviolet (UV) light scanner and z-axis translator. The desired polymer object is then
'written' into the UV-curable resist, layer by layer, until the entire structure has been
defined (Figure 7.1).
The first commercially available SL system was produced by 3D Systems in 1987. SL
is now widely used in both the automotive and aerospace industries to fabricate industrial
products from the basic design to 'show and tell' parts at low cost - before the parts are
machined in the conventional manner.
This chapter describes in detail the different stereolithographic techniques and how they
can be used to make miniature parts (or microparts). When SL is used to make microparts,
it is usually referred to as microstereolithography (MSL). Here, we show the importance of
MSL as an enabling technology to make parts for microelectromechanical system (MEMS)
devices in materials other than silicon. It is thus a complementary technology to the
bulk- and surface-micromachining techniques described in Chapters 5 and 6, respectively.
Furthermore, MSL permits the fabrication of true 3-D devices, on the micron-to-millimetre
scale, including curvilinear and re-entrant microstructures that are difficult to make using
conventional silicon micromachining. It is sometimes referred to as the 'poor man's LIGA
process'!
The next section describes the fundamental concepts of photopolymerisation and SL
to produce an MSL system. The concept of photopolymerisation will already be familiar
to those who have read Chapters 2, 4, and 6, because it is also used in the processing of
conventional electronic materials and silicon microtechnology (e.g. see Sections 2.3, 4.3,
and 6.2).

7.1.1 Photopolymerisation
SL is a photopolymerisation process, that is, a process that joins together a number of
small molecules (monomers) in a resin or resist to make larger molecules (polymers),
which usually use UV radiation to polymerise (or cure) the resist material. Different
types of photopolymers are used in SL prototyping and these are commonly based on
either free-radical photopolymerisation or cationic photopolymerisation. The generalised
molecular structure of monofunctional acrylate, epoxy, and vinyl ether, which are the
three main photopolymer systems, are shown in Figure 7.2 (Jacobs 1996).
In general, the photopolymerisation process is initiated by the incidence of photons
generated by an UV light source. The breaking of the C—C double bond (acrylate and vinyl
ether) or ring (epoxy) in the monomer enables monomer units to link up and form a chain-
like structure. The cross-linked polymer chain finally forms when the chain propagation
is terminated. To illustrate this process, the various steps in a free-radical polymerisa-
tion sequence are given in Figure 7.3. The selection of the photopolymer depends on the
required dimensional accuracy and mechanical properties of each individual photopolymer
formulation (Jacobs 1996).
The curing depth and line-width of the photopolymerisation process are the two most
critical parameters and these need to be carefully controlled in the SL process. In principle,
the curing depth and line-width can be determined from the beam distribution and the
absorption of radiation in the resist (Figure 7.4).

where It, and I0 are the transmitted and incident light intensities, C is the concentration of
the absorber, d is the distance the light has passed into the absorber, and 
is a constant
proportional to the absorption coefficient of the absorbing material at the wavelength used.
In the SL process, we consider the UV beam to have a Gaussian profile, which is
scanned in a straight line at constant velocity vs along the x-axis, which is in the surface
of the photopolymer, as shown in Figure 7.5 (Jacobs 1992).
The irradiance (radiant power per unit area), I(x, y, z) at any point within the resin
can be related to the irradiance incident on the resin surface, I (x,y, 0) using the
Beer-Lambert law
(7.2)
where dp is the penetration depth of the beam, which depends on the wavelength, the
absorption coefficient, and the initiator concentration (from Equation (7.1)). It is defined
as the depth of resin that results in a reduction in the incident irradiance by a factor
of 1/e.
Here, we assume a Gaussian radial distribution of the light intensity in the plane
orthogonal to the optical axis O-X shown in Figure 7.6. The relationship between the
power P and irradiance I of an axisymmetric Gaussian light source (i.e. laser beam) is

where r is the radial distance and r2 is given by x2 + y2 according to the Pythagoras
theorem and w0 is defined as the half-width of the Gaussian beam. Because the power of
the laser beam is normally known, we can integrate Equation (7.3) to find that I (0,0,0)
is equal to 2P/(w2
0). Substituting this result back into Equations (7.2) and (7.3) allows
us to define the irradiance at an arbitrary point inside the resin as

The maximum cured line-width lw (2ymax) is obtained at the point of z = 0, and is

It is assumed here that the laser exposure at the point with maximum depth is equal to that
at the point with maximum line- width and is taken as critical exposure Ec. It is known
that the exposure level at which the gel point (i.e. polymerisation) is reached should be
slightly higher than the threshold exposure known as the critical exposure.
The relationship between the curing depth and line-width is finally obtained and is
given by
lw = 2w0 cd/2dp 
(7.9.)
It is essential that the precise working curves of the curing depth and line-width are known
in an SL process. More sophisticated models that take account of other factors, such as
dark polymerisation, diffusion of the light source, with calibration performed for each SL
system, and photocurable material may be constructed.

MICROSTEREOLITHOGRAPHY FOR MEMS
7.1.2 Stereolithographic System
All SL systems share the same basic elements or subsystems: the CAD design, layer-
preparation functions, and a laser-scanning or imaging system. A typical SL system is
schematically shown in Figure 7.7.
The CAD model is a 3-D representation of the object and is exported, most commonly,
into a file with a format called STL. Slice cross sections are produced from this file and
converging parts placed into a 'build' file. Process control software is then used to operate
the SL writing process according to the build file. Detailed information on CAD design,
STL file formats, part preparation convergence, contour slice, and so on can be found in
the references (Jacobs 1992, 1996).
A uniform, flat resin layer of the desired thickness is prepared for curing through
standard layer preparation. The liquid resin surface will be the foundation of each layer
of the SL model; therefore, the quality of the resin surface has a direct impact on the
accuracy of the final structure. Recoating blades, fluidic pumps, surface-finding lasers, and
robotic systems have all been considered to achieve a highly uniform resin surface. The
general requirements of the SL process are simple in concept, but their implementation
is quite challenging. The SL system should satisfy all the following requirements (Jacobs
1996):
• The resin surface must be maintained precisely at the focal plane of the imaging system
• The resin surface must be uniformly flat, leveled, and free of extraneous features
• The resin surface must be a controlled distance above the previously built cross section
of the part
The recoating and leveling systems work together and aim to achieve the desired goal
of providing a flat layer of liquid resin of proper thickness. A leveling system is used to
sense the resin height and permit adjustments. A level-finding system can vary from a
x-v scanner

MICROSTEREOLITHOGRAPHY

simple mechanical float mechanism through to an optical proximity sensor system, which
monitors the current resin height and allows this to be fed back into a computer-based
closed-loop control system.
A number of other steps are required in the coating process, such as the lowering
of the part in the vat full of resin, the wiping away of any excess materials, and the
smoothing of the remaining materials to provide the desired thickness of liquid resin
above the previously solidified layer.
The thickness of the layer typically ranges from 100 to 500 um. The recoater must be
controlled very precisely to achieve thinner layers, because a recoating error of 25 um
becomes very significant when building with thickness below 100 um (Jacobs 1996).
When a smooth, uniform, and accurate coating of the liquid resin has been achieved
over the previously solidified polymer layer, the process is not finished until sufficient
resin remains within the vat to compensate for any shrinkage that can occur during
curing.
An imaging system for SL includes a light source (laser or lamp), beam delivery,
and focusing elements (Figure 7.7). The laser (or lamp) chosen for the system must be
appropriate for the resin to be used. Wavelength, output beam shape, and power available
are all important characteristics (see equations in Section 7.1.1). Beam delivery elements
are employed to fold the path of the laser beam and therefore make the SL system as
compact as possible.
A typical SL system employs two orthogonally mounted, 
servo-controlled,
galvanometer-driven mirrors to direct the laser beams onto the surface of the vat. The
beam is passed though a focusing objective and then hits the resin surface. The beam
exposure is controlled by a shutter according to an on-off command generated by the
build file. A mechanical shutter requires typically about 1 ms to actuate, and so has now
been replaced by an acoustic optical modulator that has a much lower actuation time of
about 1 us, thus allowing a much faster fabrication process. The time needed to write a
layer is always a critical parameter of any beam writer because it relates both to throughput
and cost.
Applications of SL vary considerably from the quick-cast tooling through to struc-
tural analysis. Consequently, SL can speed up product development and improve product
quality through superior design and prototyping.
7.2 MICROSTEREOLITHOGRAPHY
The principle of MSL is basically the same as that of SL (Section 7.1), except that the
resolution of the process is lower. In MSL, a UV laser beam is focused down to a 1 to
2 um-diameter spot that solidifies a resin layer of 1 to 10 um in thickness, whereas in
conventional SL, the laser beam spot size and layer thickness are both on the order of
100 to 1000 um. Submicron control of both the x-y-z translation stages and the UV beam
spot enables the precise fabrication of complex 3-D microstructures.
MSL is also called microphotoforming 
and was first introduced to fabricate high
aspect ratio and complex 3-D microstructure in 1993 (Ikuta and Hirowatari 1993). In
contrast to conventional subtractive micromachining, MSL is an additive process, and
therefore, it enables the fabrication of high aspect ratio microstructures with novel smart
materials. The MSL process is, in principle, compatible with silicon microtechnology

180
MICROSTEREOLITHOGRAPHY FOR MEMS
and therefore post-CMOS batch fabrication is also feasible (Ikuta et al. 1996; Zissi
1996).
Different MSL systems have been developed in recent years to improve upon their
precision and speed. Basically, scanning MSL (Ikuta and Hirowatari 1993; Zissi el al.
1996; Katagi and Nakajima 1993; Zhang et al. 1999; Maruo and Kawata 1997) and
projection MSL (Bertsch et al. 1997; Nakamoto and Yamaguchi 1996; Monneret et al.
1999) are the two major approaches that have been taken. Scanning MSL builds the solid
microparts in a point-by-point and line-by-line fashion (Figure 7.8), whereas projection
MSL builds one layer with each exposure (Figure 7.9), thus speeding up the building
process by a significant factor (Beluze et al. 1999). The details of the two approaches are
presented in Sections 7.3 and 7.4.
Another research effort in MSL is the incorporation of a broad spectrum of mate-
rials to create MEMS with new special functions. The MSL fabrication of polymer

microparts and their subsequent electroplating to form metallic microparts have been
reported (Ikuta and Hirowatari 1993; Ikuta et al. 1996; Zissi et al. 1996; Katagi and Naka-
jima 1993; Maruo and Kawata 1997; Bertsch et al. 1997; Nakamoto and Yamaguchi 1996;
Monneret et al. 1999). Functional polymer (e.g. conducting polymer) microparts possess
the unusual characteristics of high flexibility, low density, and high electric conductivity
(Ikuta and Hirowatari 1993). Ceramic microstructures have also been fabricated by MSL
using both structural and functional ceramic materials (Zhang et al. 1999; Jiang et al.
1999). The use of MSL to make both ceramic and metallic microparts is discussed in
Section 7.7.
7.3 SCANNING METHOD
Most MSL equipment developed today are based on the scanning method (Figure 7.8),
which is the method employed in conventional SL and is widely used in the industry. With
the scanning method, a well-focussed laser beam with beam spot size around 1 micron is
directed onto the resin surface to initiate the polymerisation process. A 3-D microstructure
is built up by the repeated scanning of either the light beam or the work piece layer by
layer.
7.3.1 Classical MSL
The classical setup for SL is shown in Figure 7.10, in which the laser beam is deflected
by two low-inertia galvanometric X-Y mirrors and is focused by a dynamic lens onto the
surface of the workpiece in a photoreactor (vat) that contains a UV photoinitiator (Bertsch
et al. 1997). An acousto-optical shutter switches the laser beam on and off between
the polymerised segments. Small objects can be made with this type of apparatus, but
improvements in the beam focus are necessary to obtain the higher resolution needed for
rnicrofabrication (less than 100 um).

It is believed that, in classical MSL, too many mobile optical elements lead to poor
focusing. As shown in Figure 7.11, the free liquid resin surface defines a horizontal plane,
whereas the motion of the focused laser spot describes a portion of the surface of a sphere.
Thus, theoretically, the spot size varies during the scanning process. In classical SL, this
defocussing may not be critical as a larger beam size (>100 um) and longer focal depth
are used and an acceptable beam size and shape can be maintained across the flat resin
surface (Jacobs 1996). In MSL, however, the depth of focus is relatively short when
striving for high-resolution fabrication; in other words, to maintain the focus point at the
resin surface is highly critical, and this is the reason classical MSL apparatus employs a
dynamic lens for focusing. Even so, focusing still remains a major concern from recent
reports (Bertsch et al 1997).
Although this classical MSL system possesses some focusing problems that prevent
high-resolution fabrications, it has a fast fabrication speed. Therefore, classical MSL
is still an attractive option, as fabrication speed is always the first consideration of
production.
7.3.2 IH Process
A series of integrated harden (IH) polymer SL processes have been developed by Ikuta
and these are based on the classical scanning MSL method. The IH processes are designed
to overcome the beam-focussing problem present in a classical MSL system.

SCANNING METHOD

Figure 7.12 
Schematic diagram of the apparatus used for an IH process. From Ikuta and
Hirowatari (1993)
The apparatus for an IH process is shown in Figure 7.12, where the light source is a
UV lamp (Xenon lamp) and where the beam is focused onto the resin surface through a
glass window. The focal point of the apparatus remains fixed during the fabrication and
the work piece is in a container that is attached to an X-Y stage, which provides the
scanning that was realised previously by the galvanometric mirrors. Using an X-Y stage
to move the work piece rather than the galvanometric mirrors to deflect beam leads to
a smaller focal spot and hence higher resolution. Now, there is no need for a dynamic
focus lens because the focal point is fixed. The glass window is attached to the Z-stage
so that the layers of precise thickness can be prepared.
The IH process can be used to fabricate polymeric microstructures, whereas metal
microstructures can be obtained by first making a polymer micromould, metal-plating,
and finally removing the polymer (Figure 7.13, Ikuta and Hirowatari 1993).
The specifications of a typical IH process are listed below:
• 5 um spot size of the UV beam
• Positional accuracy is 0.25 urn (in the x-y directions) and 1.0 um in the z-direction
• Minimum size of the unit of harden polymer is 5 um x 5 um x 3 urn (in x, y, z)
• Maximum size of fabrication structure is 10 mm x 10 mm x 10 mm
With this IH process, some high aspect ratio and truly 3-D polymer microstructures,
such as micropipes and microsprings (Figure 7.14), have been successfully fabricated. In
addition, a metallic 3-D micropart was obtained after metal-plating of a polymer cast, as
shown in Figure 7.15 (Ikuta and Hirowatari 1993).
The characteristics of an IH process can thus be summarised as follows:
• It is capable of making true 3-D and high aspect ratio microstructures
• It works with different materials
• It requires no mask plates and is thus a cost-effective process

Hirowatari (1993)
• It has a medium range of accuracy (3 to 5 urn)
• It permits desktop microfabrication of parts
It should be pointed out here that the fabrication speed of the IH process is slower than
classic MSL because the scanning speed of the X-Y stage and container is less than that
of the galvanometric scanner.
7.3.3 Mass-IH Process
The slow fabrication speed of the IH process is a concern, and so the so-called mass-IH
process was proposed by Ikuta in 1996 to demonstrate the possibility of realising the
mass production of 3-D microfabrications by MSL (Ikuta et al. 1996).
The mass-IH process is schematically shown in Figure 7.16 and utilises fibre-optic
multibeam scanning. The basic idea is that an array of single-mode optical fibres can be
used to enhance the speed of device production.

Figure 7.17 Prototype of a fibre-optic array (4 mm by 4 mm). From Ikuta et al. (19%)
An array with five single-mode optical fibres (4 um in core diameter) was used to
demonstrate the mass-IH process by Ikuta (Ikuta et al. 1996) (Figure 7.17). Other spec-
ifications of the apparatus are the same as those of the IH process. As an example, five
micropipes with lateral windows were made within a period of 40 minutes (Figure 7.18),
in which each pipe had a cross section of 250 u,m by 250 urn and is 900 u.m high.
The thickness of each stack layer is 30 um. Thus, the fabrication speed was signif-
icantly improved by this arrangement of 'parallel-processing.' However, this mass-IH
process needs to be developed further using optical-fibre arrays and by improving the
resolution.
7.3.4 Super-IH Process
Both the IH and mass-IH processes are based on a scanning method with layer preparation,
which shares the same basic principle as conventional SL. Two of the problems associated
with this kind of layer-by-layer fabrication are as follows:
• The depth resolution is limited by the thickness of the layer that is stacked up
• Viscous UV-curable monomers can deform and hence damage the solidified microstruc-
tures

(a) Comparison of the solidification processes of conventional MSL (I) and the new
super-IH process (II) and (b) processes needed to make movable gear and shaft (I). Conventional
MSL needs support structure, whereas the new super-IH process (II) does not need a support
It has been shown by Ikuta et al. (1998) that a significant surface tension of the
liquid monomer decreases the precision of the fabrication process. The super-IH process
has been developed to address this problem and can be used to solidify the monomer
at a specific point in 3-D space by focusing a laser beam into a liquid UV-curable
monomer. The 3-D microstructure is now fabricated by scanning the focused spot in all
three dimensions inside the liquid, thus obviating the need for any supports or sacrificial
layers. Figure 7.19 illustrates the difference between the conventional MSL processes and
the super-IH process (Ikuta et al. 1998) in that it does not need a support (a) and therefore
can be used to make, for example, a movable gear and shaft in one step. Because the
beam is writing directly into the resist, the effects of the monomer viscosity and surface
tension are greatly diminished.
A schematic diagram of the experimental setup of the super-IH process is shown in
Figure 7.20 and consists of a He–Cd laser of 442 nm wavelength, an optical shutter,
a galvano-scanner set, an X-Y-Z stage, an objective lens, and a computer (Ikuta et al.
1998). The laser beam is focused inside the monomer volume by coordinating the beam
scanning and Z-stage movements; thus, the 3-D structures are formed inside the liquid.
The properties of this system must be precisely tuned to ensure that polymerisation
only takes place at the point of focus. The UV monomer system used in the super-IH
process is a mixture of urethane acrylate oligomers, monomers, and photoinitiators.
Some interesting polymer microparts with free-moving elements have been fabricated
using the super-IH process (Ikuta et al. 1998). Figure 7.21 shows a scanning electron

microscopy (SEM) image of a microquoit (a), and the fabrication steps to make it (b).
The focal point is scanned in a circular motion and the radius steadily increases as the
stage moves up or down with a constant interval along the optical axis. The shaft was
made first from the bottom to the top with a diameter of 10 urn and then the freely
movable ring was formed at the middle of the shaft with an inner diameter of 24 urn.
The ring is able to remain suspended freely in the liquid because of its high viscosity.
Clearly, this process can make microparts with freely moving elements in a single step
with no postprocess assembly necessary - this permits the fabrication of more complex
MEMS device than that with silicon micromachining.

TWO-PHOTON MSL 
189
The resolution of the super-IH process is excellent and is typically less than 1 um. The
fabrication speed can be increased by operating the galvano scanning mirror and X-Y-Z
stages together. The disadvantages are that the optics system is more expensive than both
the IH and mass-IH processes, and specialised monomer systems need to be developed
for each application.
7.4 TWO-PHOTON MSL
As mentioned earlier, conventional MSL is limited in terms of the minimum thickness
of the resin layers possible because of viscosity and surface tension effects. In contrast,
the two-photon MSL process (like the super-IH) does not have this problem because the
resin does not need to be layered.
When a laser beam is focused on a point with a microscope objective lens as shown
in Figure 7.22 (Maruo and Kawata 1998), the density of photons decreases with the
distance away from the focal plane, but the total number of photons in the beam at every
cross section remains the same (see Figure 7.22(b)). Thereafter, the resin is solidified
completely in the illuminated region even beyond focal point, leading to a poor resolution;
this means that the linear response of the materials to the light intensity based on a
single-photon absorption does not have optical sectioning capability. On the other hand,
if the material response is proportional to the square of the photon density, the integrated
material response is enhanced greatly at the focal point (see Figure 7.22(c)), and, therefore,
the polymerisation based on two-photon absorption occurs only in a small volume within
the focal depth. Normally, the beam power of the laser has to be extremely high (several
kilowatts) to obtain two-photon absorption.
A two-photon MSL apparatus is shown in Figure 7.23 (Maruo and Kawata 1998).
The beam is generated by a mode-locked titanium sapphire laser and is directed by two
galvanic scanning mirrors. The beam is then focused with an objective lens into the resin.
A charge-coupled device (CCD) camera is used to aid focusing and monitor the forming
of the microstructure. A Z-stage moves the resin container along the optical axis for
multilayer fabrication. The objective lens used by Maruo had a numerical aperture of
0.85 (magnification of 40). The accuracy of the galvano-scanner set (General scanning)

a wavelength of 770 nm. The resin used was SCR-500, which is a mixture of urethane
acrylate oligomers or monomers and photoinitiators. The absorption spectrum of this resin
is shown in Figure 7.24. The resin is transparent at 770 nm, meaning that polymerisation
cannot take place by one-photon absorption.
Some high aspect ratio and extremely fine 3-D microstructures have been fabricated
using two-photon MSL, as shown in Figure 7.25 (Maruo and Kawata 1998). The lateral

and depth resolution obtained with two-photon MSL were 0.62 and 2.2 um, respectively.
It is important to note that a depth resolution of only 2.2 um is difficult to achieve with
conventional MSL. However, the longest total length of a structure in the direction of the
optical axis was up to 74.3 um, which is a limitation of two-photon MSL. In addition,
the two-photon MSL system is more expensive than most of the other types of MSL
equipment.
7.5 OTHER MSL APPROACHES
There have been a number of other approaches to MSL. For example, Bertsch et al.
(1997) and others (Zissi et al. 1996; Zhang et al. 1999) report on a system that employs
scanning by an X-Y stage and a free surface (Figure 7.26). In this system, all the optics
for the beam delivery remain fixed, whereas an X-Y stage simultaneously moves the resin
tank and the vertical axis onto which the plate that supports the fabrications is attached.
The scanning method is similar to the one Ikuta used in the IH process (Section 7.3.2),
in which galvano-scanning is replaced with X-Y stage scanning so that the system is
simplified and the precision of the focusing is enhanced. The difference between this
MSL method and that of the IH process is that it adopts the free-surface method for layer
preparation, rather than the constrained surface (with a window) used in the IH process.
The reason is that many fabrications are damaged because of the microparts that adhere
to the window in the constrained surface method, and these can be avoided by using a
free surface. In addition, the time required in the free-surface method to obtain a fresh
layer of resin on top of a cured layer depends on the rheological properties of the resin,
so a resin with a low viscosity is preferred.
Free-surface MSL is a single-photon-based photopolymerisation process; the curing
volume is relatively large compared with that of two-photon MSL. However, by adding
a light-absorbing medium into the resin, the line-width and depth can be decreased (Zissi
et al. 1996; Zhang et al. 1999). If the beam-delivery system is optimised further to obtain
the finest beam spot size, the line-width and depth of 1-2 um and 10 um, respectively,
can be obtained with surface MSL (Zhang et al. 1999). Some interesting microfabrications
with high aspect ratios and true 3-D features are shown in Figure 7.27 (Zissi et al. 1996;
Zhang et al. 1999).

7.6 PROJECTION METHOD
As described in the preceding sections, the scanning MSL can be used for very fine, high
aspect ratio 3-D microstructure fabrication, but the fabrication speed is always a major
concern - even with the galvano-scanning method. Scanning MSL builds up the objects
layer by layer, but each layer is itself built up line by line. Thus, projection MSL has been
proposed for the more rapid building of 3-D microstructures. Although it is still building
layer by layer, each layer is now written by just one UV exposure through a mask. The
reintroduction of a photographic mask plate produces significant savings in time but does
add the extra expense of preparing masks.
Basically, there are two types of projection MSL: one is the use of a real photographic
mask to project the UV pattern for curing (Nakamoto and Yamaguchi 1996) and the other
is to use a dynamic mask referred to here as the liquid crystal display (LCD) projection
method (Bertsch et al. 1997).
7.6.1 Mask-Projection MSL
As in standard photolithography, an image is transferred to the liquid photopolymer by
shining an UV beam through a patterned mask plate as shown in Figure 7.28 (Suzumori
3 994). Then, another fresh layer of liquid photopolymer is prepared on top of the patterned
solid polymer. By repeating the above process, a multilayered 3-D microstructure can be
built by this mask projection MSL (Katagi and Nakajima 1993; Nakamoto and Yamaguchi
1996; Suzumori et al. 1994).
Let us now consider the equations that govern the optics of mask-projection MSL
(Nakamoto and Yamaguchi 1996):
When a beam of uniform intensity I0 passes through a square mask, with the centre
of the mask at x = 0 and y = 0, the depth of the polymer along the z-axis, and onto the
surface of the liquid polymer (see Figure 7.29(a)), diffraction occurs, and the intensity Id
may be expressed as follows:
ld(x, y, z) = 0.25 I0 (C2

where A is the wavelength of the UV light, a is the length of each side of the square, and
h is the distance between the mask and the surface of the resin.
The light intensity inside the resin, 7(x, y, z), can be calculated according to the
Beer-Lambert law expressed in a slightly different form from that of Equation (7.13)
I (x,y,z) = Id(x, y, 0)exp(-az)
(7.13)
where a is the absorption coefficient of the resin. The irradiation exposure E(x, y, z) =
I (x,y,z)t, where t is the irradiation time period. The resin solidifies once the irra-
diation exposure reaches the threshold value Ec. The parameters a and E0 determine
the solidification properties of the resin and must be determined experimentally. Letting

PROJECTION METHOD
195
E(x, y, z) = E0 allows the theoretical shape of the solidified polymer after projection to
be determined.
Similar to scanning MSL, the fabrication precision is related to the exposure. In partic-
ular, the curing depth strongly depends on the laser exposure as shown in Figure 7.29(b)
(Nakamoto and Yamaguchi 1996). The lateral dimension is slightly influenced by the
exposure and is determined mainly by the mask pattern in the case of a fixed distance
between the mask and resin surface.
Another important parameter in mask-projection MSL is the distance between the
mask and the resin surface. A large distance between the mask and resin surface results
in a larger lateral dimension because of diffraction (Nakamoto and Yamaguchi 1996)
(Figure 7.29(c)). Therefore, to minimise this effect and obtain the highest precision in
mask-projection MSL, the mask should be located as close as possible to the resin surface.
An example of a micropart fabricated by the mask-projection MSL process is shown
in Figure 7.30 (Nakamoto and Yamaguchi 1996).
The fabrication speed of mask-projection MSL is much faster than scanning MSL as
stated earlier. But for complex 3-D microstructures, a large number of masks are needed,
and this process is not only time-consuming but also expensive. This disadvantage can
be overcome by using dynamic mask-projection MSL.

7.6.2 Dynamic Mask-Projection MSL
Dynamic mask-projection MSL utilises a dynamic mask generator rather than a 'static'
photographic mask plate and therefore permits the rapid fabrication of complex 3-D micro-
objects. A schematic view of a dynamic mask-projection MSL is shown in Figure 7.31
(Bertsch et al. 1997). In dynamic MSL, the mask pattern is produced by a computer-
controlled LCD rather than by a chrome mask. Once the CAD file has been translated
into a numerical control code that is sent to the LCD device via a computer, the LCD can
function as a dynamic mask to control the pattern of the layer. The light beam then passes
through the LCD mask before it is focused on the resin surface to allow the selective
polymerisation of the exposed areas that correspond to the transparent pixels of the LCD.
The rest of the apparatus used in dynamic mask-projection MSL is the same as standard
MSL, namely, layer preparation, beam on-off control, and so on. It should be noted that
the Z-stage is the only moving element in the system and therefore it is simpler.
In dynamic mask MSL, the liquid-solid phototransformation can once again be
described by the Beer-Lambert law. Because time t is now the most critical parameter
in the process, the curing depth is usually given in the form of
dc = In(t/t 0)/aC with tc = Q/aCF0
(7.14)
where, dc is the curing depth, a is the absorption coefficient (1 mol–1cm– 1), C is the
concentration of the photoinitiator (mol I– 1), t is the exposure time (s), tc is the exposure
time (s) necessary to make the exposure reach the polymerisation threshold energy (s), Q
is the number of absorbed photons per unit volume (photon m– 3), which is determined
experimentally, and F0 is the incident flux (photon m–3cm–1).
The liquid crystal matrix is inserted between four glass windows that are opaque to UV
light; therefore, for this system, it is necessary to use a visible light source and a different
set of chemical mixtures (Bertch et al. 1997). The lateral dimension is now determined by

the LCD mask and so is limited by the resolution and contrast of current LCD displays. By
using a LCD composed of a 640 x 480 pixel array, a lateral resolution around 2 um x
2 um was obtained (Figure 7.32) by Monneret et al. (1999). Thus, dynamic projection
MSL gives a reasonable accuracy, which, no doubt, will improve as higher-resolution
LCDs are developed.
Some interesting microparts have been fabricated by a number of research groups
using dynamic projection MSL, as shown in Figure 7.33 (Nakamoto and Yamaguchi
1996; Monneret et al. 1999; Beluze et al. 1999).
Dynamic projection MSL has some problems associated with it, such as the limited
lateral resolution mentioned earlier and the size of the object that is currently limited to
a few millimeters. Nevertheless, dynamic projection MSL is an attractive way of making
3-D microparts in a reasonable time.
7.7 POLYMERIC MEMS ARCHITECTURE WITH
SILICON, METALS, AND CERAMICS
The fabrication of new MEMS devices requires the integration of various new functional
materials such as polymers, ceramics, metals, and metal alloys. This section describes
how the MSL process could be used to fabricate MEMS devices on the basis of these
different materials.
7.7.1 Ceramic MSL
Functional and structural ceramic materials possess useful properties such as high temper-
ature or chemical resistance, high hardness, low thermal conductivity, ferroelectricity, and
piezoelectricity. The application of ceramic materials in MEMS has attracted a great deal
of interest recently (English and Allen 1999; Epstein et al. 1997; Bau et al. 1998; Polla
and Francis 1996; Varadan et al. 1996). Three-dimensional ceramic microstructures are of
special interest in applications such as microengines (Epstein et al. 1997) and microflu-
idics (Bau et al. 1998). Various novel approaches to ceramic microfabrication have been
developed. Unlike conventional silicon micromachining, MSL can be used to build the
complex ceramic 3-D microstructures in a rapid free-form fashion without the need for
high pressures or high temperatures (Jiang et al. 1999).

Ceramic MSL differs from polymeric MSL in the following aspects. First, the resin
system for ceramic MSL is composed not only of the monomers and photoinitiators that
are used in polymer MSL but also of ceramic powders, dispersants, and diluents (Zhang
et al. 1999; Varadan et al. 1996). Dispersants and diluents are used to obtain a homoge-
neous ceramic suspension with a relatively low viscosity. Upon UV polymerisation, the
ceramic particles are bonded together by the polymer and the ceramic body is formed.

Generally, the viscosity of ceramic suspensions used for MSL is higher than the viscosity
of most liquid polymers, leading to slow layer preparation. A precision blade has been
designed for the layer preparation to solve this problem (Figure 7.34, Jiang et al. 1999).
Second, light transportation during MSL is more complicated in the solid-liquid two-
phase medium, and this is caused by light scattering off the solid ceramic particles and
affecting both the curing depth and the line-width.
The curing depth has been determined from previous macroscale experiments by Grif-
fith and Halloran (1995) to be given by
and 
Q =
(7.15)
where 0 is the mean particle size of the ceramic powder, £ is the volume fraction of the
ceramic material in the suspension, HO is the refractive index of the monomer solution,
An is the difference in refractive index of the ceramic solution and the monomer solution,
and A is the wavelength of the UV light.
Therefore, MSL production of ceramic microparts is much more difficult than that
of polymer microparts. Furthermore, there is no easy way to estimate the line-width,
although a Monte-Carlo simulation approach has been proposed for ceramic MSL (Sun
etal. 1999).
The fabrication of ceramic microstructures using MSL typically follows steps shown in
Figure 7.35. First, the homogeneous ceramic suspension is prepared. Submicron ceramic
powders are mixed with monomer, photoinitiator, dispersant, diluent, and so on by ball-
milling for several hours. The prepared ceramic suspension is then put into the vat and is
ready for exposure defined by the CAD file, after which a (green) body ceramic micropart
is obtained. Finally, the green body is put into a furnace first to burn off the polymer
binders and then sintered at higher temperatures to obtain the dense ceramic microparts.
The temperatures of the binder burnout and sintering vary according to the choice of
polymeric and ceramic materials. After sintering, the ceramic microstructures are ready
for assembly and use.
The ceramic microparts shown in Figure 7.36 were fabricated from an alumina
(50-59.5 percent volume) and lead zinc titanate (PZT) suspension (33 percent volume)
(Jiang et al. 1999). Even though the resolution of ceramic MSL is poorer than that of
polymer MSL, a minimum line-width of around 6 um is achievable.

layers of negative material and 20 layers of positive material were printed
This spatial-forming process can be used to mass-produce 3-D microparts (Taylor
et al. 1994). For example, stainless steel microparts have been fabricated as shown in
Figure 7.38, and typical dimensions ranging from 100 x 150 x 150 um3 to 0.25 x 1 x
20 mm3 with a typical minimum feature size of 10 urn (Taylor et al. 1994).
7.7.2.2 Electrochemical fabrication process
EFAB is a new micromachining process, which is based on solid free-form fabrica-
tion (SFF) principles, to make high aspect ratio and 3-D metallic microsystems (Cohen
et al. 1999). The major fabrication steps in EFAB include instant masking and selective
electroplating, blanket deposition, and planarisation as illustrated in Figure 7.39.
Instant masking uses photolithographically patterned masks on the anode for selective
electroplating. The instant mask consists of a conformable insulator because the pattern
may be topologically complex. Instant masking patterns a substrate by simply pressing the
insulator mask against the substrate. Electroplating materials are then deposited onto the
substrate through apertures in the insulator mask, and the insulator mask is removed after
the plating of each layer. The mask shown in Figure 7.40 consists of a layer of insulator
patterned on a flat Cu disk (Cohen et al. 1999). In selective electroplating, pressure is
applied between the Cu anode (with mask) and the Ni (cathode) substrate.
Blanket deposition is also based on electroplating but without the use of a mask.
Basically, the blanket-deposited material (e.g. Ni) is different from the selectively plated
material (Cu), so that one metal acts as a sacrificial material and is removed as the
final step.
Planarisation is the next step and involves lapping the surplus materials to achieve a
layer of precise thickness and flatness before the deposition of the next layer. By repeating
the above steps, a 3-D micrometallic structure can be formed (Figure 7.40).
A schematic view of the apparatus fulfilling the selective-plating, blanket-deposition,
and planarisation processes is shown in Figure 7.41 (Cohen et al. 1999). An example
of a 3-D metallic microstructure fabricated by EFAB is shown in Figure 7.42 and it
demonstrates the potential of using EFAB to make MEMS devices.

EFAB is a process still in the early stages of development. The resolution is around
25 um, and smearing (caused by lapping and misregistration) can also affect the fabrica-
tion precision. Moreover, the fabrication speed is still a cause for concern because too
many time-consuming electroplating steps are involved. For example, a throughput of two
planarised 5 mm layers per hour or about 50 layers per day is predicted.

7.7.3 Metal–Polymer Microstructures
Composite metal-polymer microstructures are of some interest in the field of MEMS.
A process has been developed by Cabrara et al. (1998) that allowed the construction,
layer by layer, of a 3-D object with both conducting and nonconducting parts instead of
manufacturing the parts separately and assembling them afterwards. For example, to build
the cylindrical object described in Figure 7.43 (Cabrera et al. 1998), which consists of
a metallic element (Part 1) freely rotating inside a polymer housing (Part 2), the major
steps involved in this fabrication process include the following:

• Electroplating of copper to make Part 1
• Local laser silver plating on polymer to get the conductive base for the electroplating
of copper
• MSL with an insoluble resin to make Part 2
• MSL with a soluble resin to make a sacrificial structure between Parts 1 and 2
The details of the layer-by-layer fabrication processes to build the structures shown in
Figure 7.44 are described by Cabrera et al. (1998).
The electroplating of copper is guided by the soluble polymer that is shaped by
MSL. By changing the two-dimensional (2-D) shapes, a 3-D complex metallic structure
should be formed in a layer-by-layer fashion. However, electroplating of copper can only
occur on a conductive substrate; a local laser silver-plating technique is therefore used
to plate silver onto the polymer substrate and connect it to the previously electroplated
copper substrate (Figure 7.44, step 10). The insoluble resin is then patterned using MSL.
After all layers of plating and MSL, the soluble resin is dissolved off to leave the
desired metal-polymer object (Figure 7.45). However, no postfabrication assembly is
necessary.
Again, fabrication speed is a concern because slow-plating processes are utilised in
every layer.
7.7.4 Localised Electrochemical Deposition
A localised electrochemical deposition apparatus is schematically shown in Figure 7.46
(Madden and Hunter 1996). The tip of a sharp pointed electrode (microelectrode) is
placed in a plating solution and brought near the surface where the deposition is
required. A potential is applied between the tip and the substrate. The electric field
generated for electrodeposition is thus confined to the area beneath the tip as shown in
Figure 7.46(a).
In principle, complete 3-D microstructures can be formed using localised electrochem-
ical deposition, provided the object is a conductor and therefore continuously in electrical
contact with the substrate electrode. The spatial resolution of this process is determined
by the base diameter of the microelectrode.
Another important parameter that needs to be considered in the process is the elec-
trodeposition rate. The vertical deposition rate can be up to 6 um/s, which is 100 times
greater than that of conventional electroplating (Madden and Hunter 1996).

The shape geometry of the microelectrode used for localised electrochemical deposi-
tion is critical to the deposition profile. As shown in Figure 7.47, two different micro-
electrode configurations have been modeled and used for experiments by Madden, one
in which insulation covers the length of the electrode, leaving a disk-shaped tip exposed,
and the second in which a portion of the conical segment above the disk is also left

tips (Madden and Hunter 1996). The separation between the substrate and the tip is
about the size of its base diameter. A comparison of the deposited profiles suggests
that the electrode in which the tip alone is exposed has the better lateral resolution (see
Figure 7.48).
Through the use of a fine tip (5 to 100 um diameter), it is possible to make high aspect
ratio and 3-D micronickel structures using localised electrochemical deposition as shown
in Figure 7.49 (Madden and Hunter 1996).

However, there are two problems to be solved before this process can be widely used
in industry, namely, assembly and mass production.
7.8 COMBINED SILICON AND POLYMERIC
STRUCTURES
MSL can be readily used to fabricate polymer 3-D microstructures; however, silicon
microtechnology prevails in the fabrication of integrated circuits (ICs) and microsensors.
Therefore, the combination of silicon and polymeric microstructures is an attractive option
for smart MEMS devices. Some recent efforts in this direction are described in this
section, including 'architecture combination' by the photoforming process, MSL integrated
with thick film lithography, and the AMANDA (surface micromachining, moulding, and
diaphragm transfer) process.
7.8.1 Architecture Combination by Photoforming Process
Architecture combination is a technology for building complicated structures by mechan-
ically connecting two or more architectures made by different micromachining processes.
This technology helps in making a system that consists of, for example, lithography, elec-
troplating, and moulding process (LIGA) linkages driven by a silicon micromotor that
are housed in a polymer microstructure (see Figure 7.50; Takagi and Nakajima 1994).
The desired housing structure is a complicated one and this function actually requires a
coupled mechanism in which one component is made by one process and another compo-
nent made by another process. Photoforming, as described earlier, has been employed for
this purpose not only because of its relatively high resolution but also because of its 3-D
fabrication capabilities (Figure 7.51; Takagi and Nakajima 1994).
For example, a microclamping tool has been fabricated using this architecture combina-
tion technology (Takagi and Nakajima 1994). The pressure vessel and heating components
can be fabricated first using silicon micromachining (Figure 7.51) and then the polymer
clamping structures are formed using photoforming on top of the silicon structure. When
the pressure vessel is heated up, it induces the flexible diaphragm to deflect and the
clamping structure will open; it then closes when the vessel cools. The polymer clamping

structure is shown in Figure 7.52 (Takagi and Nakajima 1994). The clamp is flexible and
soft and therefore should not damage the sample that it is holding.
With this architecture combination, the components fabricated with different processes
are joined together during the photoforming process - the alignment is then critical to
achieve a successful tool.
7.8.2 MSL Integrated with Thick Film Lithography
Many micromechanical components have been fabricated using planar processes such as
thin film and bulk-silicon micromachining. High aspect ratio micromachining is available
through LIGA, deep reactive ion etching (RIE), and thick resist lithography with high reso-
lutions. But these processes do not allow true 3-D fabrications. On the other hand, MSL
can be used to construct complex 3-D microstructures, but with the constraints of a lower
resolution and the problems associated with the manipulation and assembly of polymeric
microstructures. An approach that seeks to combine MSL and thick resist lithography may
provide a technique to build new 3-D microstructures with more functionality (Bertsch
et al. 1998).
EPON SU-8 resin has been used for thick resin lithography, and structures as thick
as 2 mm with an aspect ratio of 20:1 have been obtained, for example, a high-definition
monoblock axle-gear master for an injection mould for watch gears. Ideally, the axle
of the gears must be conical for the centreing and reduction of the friction torque. One
level or multilevel SU-8 structures were built first by lithography (Figure 7.53), and then
fixed to an MSL elevator attached to the Z-stage immersed with photopolymerisable resin
(Figure 7.54). After careful alignment, the axle grows layer by layer on the SU-8 surface.
No assembly step is required.
Figure 7.55 shows a one-level SU-8 structure on which a conical axle has been added.
The gear is 400 urn in diameter and 600 urn in height, the conical axle part is 250 urn
high, and the diameter of the axle is 80 urn. Figure 7.56 shows a two-level SU-8 structure
on which an axle that is 400 urn high and 150 urn in diameter has been added.

7.8.3 AMANDA Process
AMANDA is a process that combines surface micromachining, micromoulding, and
diaphragm transfer to fabricate microparts from polymers. A flexible diaphragm, made of
either functional or structural materials, is deposited and patterned on a silicon substrate
using a surface-micromachining process. The moulding process is then used to build
the housing for the fabricated diaphragm and the diaphragm is next transferred from the
silicon substrate to the polymeric housing. Hence, the AMANDA process allows low-cost
production of reliable microdevices by batch fabrication.

one-level SU-8 microgear. From Bertsch et al. (1998)
Figure 7.56 
Two-level SU-8 structure with an added axle. From Bertsch et al. (1998)
As an example for the AMANDA process, the fabrication process for a pressure trans-
ducer is shown in Figure 7.57 (Schomburg et al. 1998). A silicon wafer is covered with
60 nm of gold and 1.5 urn of polyimide by physical vapour deposition (PVD) and spin
coating, respectively. The polyimide is then patterned by photolithography and an add-
tional 100 nm of gold is evaporated on top of the polyimide layer. The second layer of
gold is patterned, and strain gauges are formed. The polyimide disks, which are 30 urn
thick, are built up on the strain gauges by spin coating and photolithography.
The housings of AMANDA devices are usually produced by injection moulding to save
time (Schomburg et al. 1998). Typically, several housings can be made in a batch. The
housing can be moulded from various thermoplastic materials, such as polysulfone, poly
(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polyacetylene, polycarbonate, polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF), and polyetherether ketone (PEEK).
The mould inserts for housings are fabricated by milling and drilling using a computer
numerically controlled (CNC) machine, LIGA, deep RIE, and so on.

surface-micromachined; (b) housings are made by moulding; (c) diaphragm is transferred to the
housings; and (d) diced chips with fluidic and electrical contacts. From Schomburg et al. (1998)
The diaphragm is transferred to the housings. Adhesive is injected into the cavi-
ties, which are part of the microstructure of the housings. In the case of the example
shown in Figure 7.57, the housings are adhesively bonded to the polyimide on the wafer.
The polyimide around the housings is severed and the housings, together with the poly-
imide diaphragm, are freed from the wafer. The polyimide can be pulled off the wafer
because the adhesion of the first gold layer to the silicon surface is poor. Usually, the
diaphragm is encapsulated in a second shell, which is moulded and bonded similar to
the first shell. Finally, batches are diced and equipped with fluidic and electric contacts
(Figure 7.57).
The dimensional accuracy of the microstructures fabricated by the AMANDA process
depends on the lithography, precision of the mould insert and the moulding process, and
the alignment and temperature control during the bonding of the moulded part and the
diaphragm. The lateral accuracy of the pattern on the diaphragm can be very high because
it is fabricated by photolithography. Transfer of the diaphragm to the polymer housing
causes overall shrinkage determined by the thermal expansion coefficient of the housing
and through the bonding temperature. The precision of the mould insert for housing fabri-
cation can be very high if a LIGA process is used. The precision of a moulding process
can be several microns (or even higher) using either injection or hot-embossing moulding.
In order to improve the dimensional accuracy of the AMANDA process (Schomburg et al.
1998) further, difficulties with the alignment have to be overcome and better shrinkage
control is required.

7.9 APPLICATIONS
Various microdevices have been developed to date using the microfabrication processes
described earlier. This section describes the fabrication of some microsensors and microac-
tuators using the MSL and the AMANDA processes.
7.9.1 Microactuators Fabricated by MSL
Our first example is a shape memory alloy (SMA) microactuator glued to the 3-D struc-
tures fabricated by MSL (Figure 7.58, Ballandras et al 1997). The MSL structure was
designed with a clamping area such that the SMA wire can be easily inserted. Once the
SMA wire is correctly positioned in the MSL architecture, it is submitted to a mechan-
ical initial stress to store mechanical energy within it, which is performed by using a
calibrated weight fixed at one end of the wire, the other end being embedded in a rigid
frame. The laser beam is then focused on the clamping area, inducing the polymerisation
of the monomer and thus bonding the SMA wire with the polymer structure.
The shape-memory effect has been selected as the basis for actuation here because
it offers both high strain and force (Bernard et al. 1997). The effect is based on the
reversible solid-state phase transformation of the material from the easily deformable
martensite at low temperatures to the relatively rigid austenite at high temperatures. For
Figure 7.58

etal. (1997)

a TiNi alloy, the phase-transformation temperatures are dependent primarily on the ratio
of Ti to Ni and are in the range of 10 to 100°C. The austenite phase has an associated
parent shape, so that when deformed martensite is heated, the material exerts a force to
re-attain the austenitic shape. This force is the basis of the actuation process. The amount
of shape recovery in unconstrained material depends on the level of strain in the deformed
martensite.
The assembly technique described in the preceding paragraph permits the fabrication
of various single module SMA actuators with dimensions of several millimeters. A device
with five modules is shown in Figure 7.59 (Ballandras et al. 1997) with a total length of
2 cm. By applying 2 V direct current (DC), a large displacement of 2 mm is obtained,
and this corresponds to 20 percent of the total length of the actuator. The maximum
current in the SMA wires was found to be 300 mA. The actuator dynamics appears to be
very stable with regard to the very large number of actuating cycles, and this means that
the MSL structures are stiff enough to ensure the return of the actuators to their initial
position. It should be pointed out that the fabricated actuators only weigh a few grams,
which is advantageous when using these actuators as manipulators in robots because less
energy is needed to move the actuators themselves.
A micropump has also been fabricated by MSL (Corrozza et al. 1995). The micropump
comprises a pump body and an actuator consists of a disk of piezoelectric ceramic disk
glued to a thin brass plate (Figure 7.60). The pump body is fabricated by MSL with a
complicated geometry to realise the optimal hydraulic performance and consists of two
ball valves, a pumping chamber, and inlet and outlet channels. Each ball valve has a

cylindrical chamber connected to a hemispherical chamber that contains a mobile ball.
When the actuating diaphragm moves upward, the inlet valve is open and the outlet
valve is closed, and the fluid is then sucked into the pump chamber. During the pumping
mode, the actuating membrane deflects downward, the inlet valve is closed and the outlet
valve opens, letting fluid flow out of the pump. The dimensions of this micropump are
listed here:
• Pump body: 18-mm diameter x 5 mm height
• Brass plate: 18-mm diameter x 0.1 mm height
• Piezoelectric ceramic disk: 10-mm diameter x 0.4 mm height
• Diameter of the channel: 0.5 mm
Under an alternating current (AC) input voltage of 300 V and 70 Hz, the back pressure
can be 2.45 m H2O and flow rate about 45 ul/s (Figure 7.60(b), Corrozza et al. 1995).
This represents a fairly high output when compared with other types of micropumps.
7.9.2 Microconcentrator
A concentration process is necessary for various chemical operations for both detection
and purification. With the recent development of various types of biochemical IC chips,

APPLICATIONS 
219
Figure 7.61 
Design of a microconcentrator chip
there is a growing demand for a microconcentrator with molecular filtering. The basic
design and a prototype of the microconcentrator chip are shown in Figure 7.61 (Ikuta
el al. 1999). The overall chip size is 8 x 6 x 8.5 mm3 and it consists of a microreactor
chamber divided by an ultrafiltration membrane. The lower part (A) of the microchamber
is filled with a high-concentration solution. A photodiode at the bottom can detect changes
of colour or intensity for use in biochemical luminescence tests. The transparent nature
of the polymer structures is an advantage over silicon. The fabricated device was used
to verify the concentration of protein in a biochemical reaction. The firefly protein,
luciferase, was used because it emits visible light with a wavelength of 560 nm in a
redox reaction with beetle luciferin. Therefore, the concentration of luciferase can be
determined from the intensity of the luminescence. In the experiments, the reagents
of luciferase, luciferin, and so on were premixed to supply to the concentrator. The
luminescence was observed from the chamber (A) at the underside of the ultrafiltration

successfully (Figure 7.62, Ikuta et al. 1999). As expected, the output from the photo-
diode increased with the supply of reagent and decreased when the supply was stopped
(Figure 7.63).
In this example, the MSL process has been used to fabricate the 3-D device, and
therefore packaging and leakage problems are eliminated completely. In addition, the
transparent polymer was helpful in the testing of the devices. We expect that more
advanced microdevices will be developed using this technology in the near future.
7.9.3 Microdevices Fabricated by the AMANDA Process
A micropump has been successfully fabricated by the AMANDA process as shown in
Figure 7.64 (Schomburg et al. 1998) and comprises two membrane valves and a pump
thermopneumatical actuator. The membrane of the two valves and the diaphragm of
the actuator are made of flexible polyimide, allowing for large deflections and excel-
lent conformity. The large deflection of the actuation diaphragm provides higher flow

chamber.
The deflection of the actuation diaphragm in a micropump fabricated by AMANDA
process can be one-to-two orders of magnitude higher than that of the silicon micropump.
Also, the excellent conformity of the valve membrane leads to a high efficiency n.
All these characteristics are associated with a high output flow rate and back pres-
sure (Figure 7.65). However, the working frequency of this micropump is relatively low

because thermal pneumatic actuation was adopted, which may not be acceptable in some
applications requiring high flow uniformity. The technical data of this type of micropump
are listed in Table 7.1. It should be noted that both the housings and the diaphragms of the
micropump are made of polymer and can be selected according to the special demands of
the particular application, for example, biomedical fluid delivery. Another advantage of
AMANDA is that it is a batch-fabrication process and therefore enables the production
of a micropump at a relatively low cost.
Several types of microvalves have been developed with AMANDA (Schomburg et al.
1998). For example, a bistable microvalve, which consists of a preformed polyimide
membrane that is able to occupy two stable positions (Figure 7.66). In the top position,
the membrane closes the inlet duct of the fluid chamber, whereas, in the bottom position
it clears that opening. In this case, the valve is controlled pneumatically. The technical

of the microvalve are presented in Figure 7.67. Applications include integral components
of pneumatic and hydraulic systems, systems for chemical analyses of liquids and gases,
dosage systems for medical applications, and so on.
AMANDA has also been used to fabricate transducers. For polymer membranes, the
low Young's modulus results in large deflections and strains at comparatively low pressure
loads. Therefore, polymer pressure transducers are suitable for measuring small differential
pressures. A schematic view of a pressure transducer is shown in Figure 7.68 (Martin
et al. 1998); the outer dimensions of this transducer are 5.5 x 4.3 x 1.2 mm3. The thin
polyirnide diaphragm supports strain gauges made of gold, covered by a 30 um-thick
polyimide disk. This disk bends by the pressure dropped across the diaphragm, and the
generated strain is measured with a Wheatstone bridge.
A volume flow transducer based on pressure difference measurement is shown in
Figure 7.69 (Martin et al. 1998). The pressure drop along a capillary is measured and
the flow rate is then calculated. These transducers can be easily integrated into the
polymer micropump and microvalves developed by the AMANDA process to form a
fully integrated microfluidic system.

7.10 CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this chapter, we have reviewed the emerging field of MSL and its combination with
other process technologies. MSL offers the promise of making a variety of microparts
and microstructures without the use of vacuum systems and, in the case of polymeric
microparts, high temperatures. It is particularly attractive in that it can be used to make
in batch process truly 3-D microparts in a wide range of materials, polymers, metals,
and ceramics at a modest cost. Because there are many applications in which silicon
microstructures are ruled out as a result of, for example, biocompatibility, this technology
looks extremely promising, not only for biofluidic but also for other types of MEMS

devices. The main disadvantage of MSL is that it takes a long time to write into, and
process, a large number of resist layers to fabricate a 3-D component. Although some of
the MSL process technologies address this issue, costs must be reduced to compete with
simpler methods, such as stamping, making 2-D microstructures.

Microsensors
8.1 INTRODUCTION
A sensor may be simply defined as a device that converts a nonelectrical input quantity E
into an electrical output signal E; conversely, an actuator may be defined as a device that
converts an electrical signal E into a nonelectrical quantity E (see Figure 8.1). In contrast,
a processor modifies an electrical signal (e.g. amplifies, conditions, and transforms) but
does not convert its primary form. A transducer is a device that can be either a sensor or
an actuator. Some devices can be operated both as a sensor and an actuator. For example,
a pair of interdigitated electrodes lying on the surface of a piezoelectric material can be
used to sense surface acoustic waves (SAWs) or to generate them. This device is referred
to as an interdigitated transducer (IDT). The importance of this device is such that we
have dedicated Chapter 13 to describing its applications as a microsensor and Chapter 14
to describing its use in microelectromechanical system (MEMS) devices.
It has been proposed by Middelhoek that a sensor or actuator can be classified according
to the energy domain of its primary input-output (I/O). There are six primary energy
domains and the associated symbols are as follows:
• Electrical 
E
• Thermal 
T
• Radiation 
R
• Mechanical 
Me
• Magnetic 
M
• Bio(chemical) 
C
For example, Figure 8.2 shows the six energy domains and the vectors that define the
conventional types of sensors and actuators, that is, A vector represents a thermal sensor,
whereas A represents a thermal actuator. In this way, all the different types of sensors
(and actuators) can be classified. In practice, the underlying principles of a sensor may
involve several stages; for example, the primary nonelectrical input (radiation) that first
transforms into the mechanical domain, then into the thermal domain, and finally into the
electrical domain.
Figure 8.3 shows the vectorial representation of this radiation sensor and the three
different stages of the conversion.
In theory, a transducer could have a large number of stages, but in practice, this is
usually between one and three. For example, an electromagnetic actuator has two: first,

(i.e. electromagnetic motor). The front-end power electronic device is also shown
the electrical signal E is converted into the magnetic domain M, and then the magnetic
domain is finally converted to a mechanical force that drives the motor and produces
motion Me.
This actuator system can also be illustrated in a block diagram (see Figure 8.4) together
with a power amplifier on the front end to enhance the small electrical actuating input
current signal /. In this case, the current through a coil induces a magnetic field B, which
induces a torque on the rotor and hence outputs a rotational motion 9. This block diagram
is similar to a control block diagram, and a transfer function can be assigned to each
stage of the transduction process to model the system dynamics.
There is another approach that has been adopted here to classify sensors and actuators
more precisely in terms of the electrical principle employed. Table 8.1 shows the different
names that are derived from the electrical domain and used to describe different types of
sensors (and actuators).
The first set of devices is named according to the electrical property that is changed,
that is, the electrical resistance R, electrical capacitance C, or electrical inductance L. For
example, capacitive sensors are widely used because they are voltage-controlled devices1
(such as metal oxide semiconductor integrated circuits (MOS ICs)) and offer low power
consumption - an essential feature for battery-operated devices and instruments.

These voltage-controlled devices normally have high input impedance at low-drive frequencies and so draw
low currents.

MICROSENSORS
The second set of devices is named according to the nature of the electrical signal.
Therefore, a capacitive sensor could be called a potentiometric sensor when a change in
voltage is recorded or a coulombic sensor when a change in electric charge is recorded.
In practice, sensors tend to be classified according to both the primary measurand (or
actuand) and the basic principle involved, for example, a capacitive pressure sensor.
Using this nomenclature, it is possible to describe reasonably clearly the type of device
in question.
Many books that have been published on the topic of sensors2 often focus on one prin-
ciple, such as thermal, pressure, chemical, and so on. Appendix K lists a number of general
books on sensors, but interested readers are referred to two books in particular. First, an
introductory text by Hauptmann (1991), which gives an excellent overview of sensors for
readers unfamiliar with the field, and second, a more advanced eight-volume book series
by Gopel published by Wiley-VCH, which provides the most comprehensive review of
sensors to date3. There are relatively few books that have been published specifically
on the topic of actuators. More commonly, actuators are often described within books on
either transducers or, perhaps, instrumentation. Therefore, we recommend the introductory
texts on Transducers by Norton (1989) and the more advanced instrumentation reference
book edited by Noltingk (1995).
In this chapter, we are concerned with miniature sensors, so-called microsensors4,
which are fabricated using predominantly the bulk- and surface-micromachining technolo-
gies described in Chapters 5 and 6, respectively. Again, there are a number of textbooks
already published, which report on the topic of microsensors, but there are very few on
microactuators5. For example, we recommend the book on Silicon Sensors by Middelhoek
and Audet (1989) and Microsensors by Gardner (1994). The subsequent sections provide
an overview of the field of microsensors, and as stated above, the emerging field of IDT
microsensors is covered separately in Chapter 13.
Some sensing devices have a part or all of the processing functions integrated onto the
same silicon substrate. We refer to these devices as smart sensors. We reserve the label
of 'intelligent' for devices that have in addition some biomimetic function such as self-
diagnostic, self-repair, self-growth, and fuzzy logic. The topic of smart (and intelligent)
sensors is dealt with in Chapter 15.
There have been rapid developments in the field of microsensors during the past 10
years, and a sharp increase has taken place in the size of the world market, which has
become some billions of euros today (see Chapter 1). Here, we focus upon the main types
of microsensors, which have powered this sensing revolution, together with some of the
emerging new designs.
8.2 THERMAL SENSORS
Thermal sensors are sensors that measure a primary thermal quantity, such as temper-
ature, heat flow, or thermal conductivity. Other sensors may be based on a thermal
2 This includes books on the topic of transducers (where a sensor is an input transducer).
3 Wiley-VCH regularly publish books called Sensors Update to supplement the original volume series.
4 Most microsensors are based on silicon technology; however, the term refers to devices with one dimension
in the micron range.

THERMAL SENSORS

measurement; for example, a thermal anemometer measures air flow. However, according
to our classification of measurand energy domain, this would be regarded as a mechanical
sensor and appear under Section 8.2.3. Consequently, the most important thermal sensor
is the temperature sensor.
Temperature is probably the single most important device parameter of all. Almost
every property of a material has significant temperature dependence. For example, in the
case of a mechanical microstructure, its physical dimensions - Young's modulus, shear
modulus, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and so on - vary with operating tempera-
ture. The effect of temperature can sometimes be minimised by choosing materials with
a low temperature coefficient of operation (TCO). However, when forced to use standard
materials (e.g. silicon and silica), the structural design can often be modified (e.g. adding
a reference device) to compensate for these undesirable effects.
It is often necessary to use materials that are not based on complementary metal
oxide semiconductor (CMOS), such as magnetoresistive, chemoresistive, ferroelectric,
pyroelectric; these compounds tend to possess strong temperature-dependencies6. In fact,
the problem is particularly acute for chemical microsensors, as most chemical reactions
are strongly temperature-dependent.
Many nonthermal microsensors (and MEMS devices) have to operate either at a
constant temperature - an expensive and power-intensive option when requiring heaters
or coolers, - or in a mode in which the temperature is monitored and real-time signal
compensation is provided. Clearly, microdevices that possess an integrated tempera-
ture microsensor and microcontroller can automatically compensate for temperature and
thus offer a superior performance to those without. This is why temperature sensors
are a very important kind of sensors and are commonly found embedded in microsen-
sors, microactuators, MEMS, and even in precision microelectronic components, such as
analogue-to-digital converters.
8.2.1 Resistive Temperature Microsensors
Conventionally, the temperature of an object can be measured using a platinum resistor,
a thermistor, or a thermocouple. Resistive thermal sensors exploit the basic material
property that their bulk electrical resistivity p, and hence resistance R, varies with absolute
temperature T. In the case of metal chemoresistors, the behaviour is usually well described
by a second-order polynomial series, that is,
P(T} ^ p0(l + aTT + ftrT2) and R(T) « R0(l + aTT + 
frT2) 
(8.1)
where po/Ro are the resistivity or resistance at a standard temperature (e.g. 0 °C) and otj
and ßT are temperature coefficients. C*T is a sensitivity parameter and is commonly known
as the linear temperature coefficient of resistivity or resistance (TCR) and is defined by

MICROSENSORS
Platinum is the most commonly used metal in resistive temperature sensors because it is
very stable when cycled over a very wide operating temperature range of approximately
—260 to +1700°C, with a typical reproducibility of better than ±0.1 °C. In fact, platinum
resistors are defined under a British Standard BS1904 (1964), made to a nominal resistance
of 100 £2 at room temperature, and referred to as Pt-100 sensors. Platinum temperature
sensors are very nearly linear, and «T takes a value of -1-3.9 x 10~4/K and fa takes a value
that is four orders of magnitude lower at —5.9 x 10-7/K2. In contrast, thermistors, that
is, resistors formed from semiconducting materials, such as sulfides, selenides, or oxides
of Ni, Mn, or Cu, and Si have highly nonlinear temperature-dependence. Thermistors are
generally described by the following equation:
(8.3)
where the reference temperature is generally 25 °C rather than 0°C and the material
coefficient ß is related to the linear TCR by —B/T2. The high negative TCR means
that the resistance of a pellet falls from a few megaohms to a few ohms over a short
temperature range, for example, 100°C or so.
8.2.2 Microthermocouples
Unlike the metal and semiconducting resistors, a thermocouple is a potentiometric temper-
ature sensor in that an open circuit voltage VT appears when two different metals are joined
together with the junction held at a temperature being sensed Ts and the other ends held
at a reference temperature Tref (see Figure 8.5).
The basic principle is known as the Seebeck effect in which the metals have a different
thermoelectric power or Seebeck coefficient P; the thermocouple is conveniently a linear
device, with the voltage output (at zero current) being given by
VT = (VB - VA) =
= (PB -
(8.4)
Thermocouples are also widely used to measure temperature, and their properties are
defined in British and US standards for different compositions of metals and alloys, for

example, types B, E, J, K, N, R, S, and T. Typically, they can operate from —100 to
+2000 °C with an accuracy of between 1 and 3 percent for a full-scale operation (FSO).7
Here, we are mainly interested in whether a temperature sensor can be integrated in
a silicon process to become either a temperature microsensor or part of a silicon-based
MEMS device. Table 8.2 summarises the typical properties of conventional temperature
sensors and, more importantly, whether they can be integrated into a standard integrated
circuit (1C) process.
As is apparent from Table 8.2, it is possible to integrate resistive temperature sensors
such as the platinum Pt-100. However, the deposition of platinum or the thermistor oxide
is a nonstandard IC process and therefore requires additional pre- or post-IC processing
steps. The inclusion of nonstandard materials during, for example, a CMOS process,
which is 'intermediate' CMOS, is generally regarded as highly undesirable and should be
avoided if possible.
It is possible to fabricate silicon resistors in standard silicon IC process, as described
in Chapter 4. For example, five or more resistors can be made of doped silicon in a
standard bipolar process, such as a base resistor, emitter resistor, or an epi-resistor, and
two or three resistors can be made in a CMOS process (see Figure 4.15). The resistivity
of a single crystal of silicon varies with temperature and doping level, as illustrated in
Figure 8.6, and the lightly doped silicon provided the highest TCR. In practice, it is diffi-
cult to make single-crystal silicon with an impurity level below ~1012 cm-3; therefore, it
will not behave as an intrinsic semiconductor with a well-defined Arrhenius temperature-
dependence because the intrinsic carrier concentration is about 1010 cm-3 at room temper-
ature. In highly doped silicon resistors (~1018 cm-3), the temperature-dependence approx-
imates reasonably well to the second-order polynomial given in Equation (8.1). Never-
theless, the temperature-dependence of a silicon resistor is nonlinear and depends upon
the exact doping level, making it less suitable for use as a temperature sensor than other

types of device. Therefore, the preferred approaches are to make a microthermocouple
out of silicon or, better still, use the inherent temperature sensitivity of a silicon diode or
transistor.
The Seebeck coefficient of single-crystal silicon varies with both temperature and
doping concentration (p-type) as shown in Figure 8.7. Doping has the effect of reducing
the temperature variation of the coefficient itself; hence, the response of a silicon-based
thermocouple becomes more linear. As a variety of doping levels are possible in a planar
IC process, a Seebeck coefficient ranging from +0.5 to +5 mV/°C is achievable.
In theory, the Seebeck coefficient of a doped semiconductor is given by

between collisions and the charge carrier energy and its value varies between —1 and
+2 depending on whether the carriers can move freely or are trapped, and finally <j> is
a phonon drag term for the carrier. In practice, the Seebeck coefficient can be readily

where m is a dimensionless constant (negative for n-type and positive for p-type) and is
typically around 2.6 and p0 is a resistivity constant of 5 x 10-6 £2m.
Therefore, a silicon thermocouple can be made in an IC process with doped silicon
and a standard metal contact, for example, aluminum. Figure 8.8 shows such a thermal
microsensor and consists of a series of N identical p-Si/Al thermocouples.

at 300 K), an output on the order of n millivolts per degree can be achieved from a
thermopile. Polysilicon/gold thermocouples have also been made with an output of about
+0.4 mV/K in which the n-type (phosphorous) polysilicon has a lower Seebeck coeffi-
cient of -176 uV/K (for a sheet resistance8 of 100 fi/sq at 300 K) and the gold has a
standard value of +194 uV/K. However, these are not standard IC process materials and
so polysilicon-based thermocouples are not the preferred fabrication route for low-cost
temperature microsensors.
8.2.3 Thermodiodes and Thermotransistors
The simplest and easiest way to make an integrated temperature sensor is to use a diode
or transistor in a standard IC process. There are five ways in a bipolar process and three
ways in a CMOS process to make a p-n diode (see Table 4.2). The I-V characteristic
of a p-n diode is nonlinear (Figure 4.19) and follows Equation (4.14), which is repeated
here for the sake of convenience:
(8.8)
where IS is the saturation current, typically 1 nA and X is an empirical scaling factor that
takes a value of 0.5 for an ideal diode. Rearranging Equation (8.8) in terms of the diode
voltage gives
V =
(8.9)
Therefore, when the diode is operated in a constant current I0 circuit (see Figure 8.9(a)),
the forward diode voltage Vout is directly proportional to the absolute temperature9 and

Let us suppose that the forward current is 0.1 uA and about 100 times the diode saturation
current of approximately 1 nA; then, the expected temperature sensitivity is +0.2 mV/K.
However, in practice, the temperature-dependence of a diode depends on the strong
temperature-dependence of the saturation current itself. The actual value can be obtained
experimentally from the temperature-dependence of the forward junction voltage of a
silicon diode10, that is, -2 mV/°C, and therefore Vf0 oc T.
In a similar way, a bipolar transistor can be used as a temperature sensor. For example,
Figure 8.9(b) shows an n-p-n transistor in a common-emitter configuration and constant
current circuit. From our basic theory, the base-emitter voltage VBE is proportional to the
absolute temperature and simply related to the collector current Ic by

where AE is the area of the emitter, Js is the saturation current density, and IC0 is the
reverse saturation current. More accurate models can be developed from, for example,
those discussed previously for a bipolar transistor (Equation (4.20)), but the base-emitter
current approximates well in practice to
VBE ^ VBEO + AT 
(8.13)
where A. is an empirical constant that depends on the current density and process param-
eters and the offset voltage VBEO has a typical value of 1.3 V when the base-collector
voltage VBC is set to zero.
To make a truly PTAT sensor, it is necessary to fabricate two transistors - one with an
emitter area AEI and the other with AE2. Then the difference in their base-emitter voltages
is directly proportional to the absolute temperature and is given by

When the two transistors are identical, the collector currents and saturation current densi-

Transistors are the most attractive elements for measuring temperature either in a
discrete device or in a part of a standard 1C. For example, Figure 8.10(a) shows a simple
PTAT circuit that uses two identical p-n-p transistors to divide the current equally into
two11 n-p-n transistors with different emitter areas. The voltage dropped across the resistor
R is simply the difference in base-emitter voltages for the n-p-n transistors; therefore,
the current Io flowing out is
Figure 8.10(b) shows a commercially available integrated temperature IC based on the
PTAT circuit. In the temperature IC (RS 590kH), the output current Io has been set by
laser-trimming of the resistor to 298.2 ± 2.5 uA for a temperature of 298.2 K, and the
temperature sensitivity ST is 1.0 uA/°C over the range of —55 to +150°C.
There are a number of variations in this type of PTAT circuit, such as using a set
of eight identical n-p-n transistors of equal emitter area and adding a reference offset
voltage to have an output closer to zero at room temperature. However, this type of
temperature sensor is simple to make in a standard IC process and has a good sensitivity
and low dependence upon process variation because of the ratiometric principle employed.
Therefore, it is an attractive option in many cases.

8.2.4 SAW Temperature Sensor
In certain circumstances, it may be cost-effective to use other technologies. For example,
the remote wireless sensing of temperature - perhaps on a rotating part - requires a
temperature IC, radio frequency (RF) transmitter, and a battery power supply. An alter-
native approach would be to use a wireless SAW temperature sensor. Figure 8.11 shows
a schematic drawing of such a device. The SAW sensor consists of a thin lithium niobate
piezoelectric layer on top of a ceramic, glass, or silicon substrate (Bao et al. 1994). A
thin aluminum film is patterned using optical lithography (1-mask process) to form a pair
of interdigital electrodes connected to a small microwave antenna and a pair of reflectors.
The basic principle is that a frequency modulated (FM) electromagnetic signal is trans-
mitted remotely and is picked up by the small antenna, which then drives the SAW via
the interdigital electrodes down to the reflectors. The reflectors return the wave that then
drives the FM antenna and sends back two signals to the remote location. The time-delays
of the two signals are measured using suitable electronic circuitry, for example, a mixer
to obtain the phase differences from the reference signal and a microcomputer to interpret
the output.
The difference in phase angle A<p between the two signals is linearly related to the
temperature by the two time delays T\ and 12 (Bao et al. 1994),
(8.16)
where the original FM signal has a frequency (ITCCDQ] equal to 905 MHz, the time-delays
of the reflected signals are 1 us and 1.1 us at room temperature, and the temperature
coefficient of lithium niobate is 9.4 x 10-5/°C. The temperature sensitivity of the SAW-
IDT microsensor is calculated to be 3.1 degrees/°C. Experimental results are shown in
Figure 8.12 and it can be seen that they agree well with the theory. The resolution of the
sensor is about 1 degree of angle or 0.33 °C.

This temperature microtransducer has great practical value in that the sensing part is
passive, that is, it requires no power supply; second, it is wireless and therefore can be
embedded in rotating or moving parts, such as car tyres, turbine blades, helicopter rotors,
and so on; and finally, it is very inexpensive to make. SAW-IDT microsensors have many
more important applications than simply acting as a temperature sensor. Consequently, the
microsensors are subsequently covered in further detail; Chapter 12 provides fabrication
details and Chapter 13 summarises the possible applications of IDT microsensors.
8.3 RADIATION SENSORS
Radiation sensors can be classified according to the type and energy of the measurand,
as illustrated in Figure 8.13, in which the energy ER in electron volts (eV) of the elec-
tromagnetic radiation is simply related to its frequency / in Hertz, and wavelength A. in
meters by
ER (in eV) = - = -
e 
Xe
(8.17)
where h is Planck's constant, c is the velocity of light in a vacuum (i.e. 3.0 x 108 m/s),
and e is the charge on an electron (i.e. 1.60 x 10-19 C).
Radiation can come in the form of particles, such as neutrons, protons, and alpha and
beta particles, emitted from the decay of nuclear material. However, the detection of
nuclear particles and high-energy electromagnetic radiation (i.e. gamma rays and X rays)
generally requires sophisticated instrumentation that cannot be readily integrated into a
miniature device. The exception to this general observation is perhaps the detection of
low-energy X rays or electrons through a solid-state photoelectric detector, the principle
for which is covered in Section 8.3.2.
The most common types of radiation microsensor detect electromagnetic radiation with
energies or wavelengths from the ultraviolet-to-near-infrared (UV-NIR) region, which
includes visible, through the NIR and thermal-infrared region and into the microwave
and radio regions. The most important regions are the visible light region and the NIR

Classification of radiation sensors according to their electromagnetic energy
region because these are the wavelengths at which signals are transmitted down fibre-optic
cables in modern telecommunication systems. Readers interested in the general field of
fibre-optic sensors are referred to Udd (1991) and those interested in the field of biosensing
and chemical sensing are referred to Boside and Harmer (1996). The real interest to us
here is whether the optical components and any optical interconnects can be integrated
into a microtransducer or MEMS device (see Tabid-Azar 1995). In this book, we have
concentrated on devices that have electrical outputs (sensors), electrical inputs (actuators),
and on electrical interconnects, as described earlier on in Sections 4.5 and 4.6 (e.g. printed
circuit boards (PCBs) and multichip modules (MCMs)). This was done as it reflects the
bulk of past developments, but it is now becoming increasingly evident that the optical
signal domain will become the more significant for both land-based signal transmission
and for the operation of sensors within hazardous environments.
Radiation microsensors can be distinguished by their underlying operating principle,
namely, photoconductive, photovoltaic (or Photoelectric), pyroelectric, and microantenna.
We will employ this distinction to discuss these four types of radiation sensor in turn.
8.3.1 Photoconductive Devices
The basic principle of a photoconductive cell (or conductive radiation device) is shown
in Figure 8.14. The radiation excites a number of electrons from the valence band of
a semiconductor material into its conduction band and thus creates both electrons and

holes that can contribute to the conduction process. This Photoconductive effect is the
dominant process when the energy of the radiation is above the band gap energy of the
semiconducting material. At higher energies, of 100 keV and above, other effects, such as
Compton scattering, occur but these only apply for detecting hard X rays and gamma rays.
If the radiation produces Nt carriers per second in a slab of material of length /,
width w, and depth d, its change in electrical conductivity Aa and change in electrical
conductance G is given by
Aa =
+
and so AG =

(8.18)
where /nn and /xp are the mobilities of the electrons and holes and rn and rp are their
lifetimes. The conductance I/Vo can be measured in a constant voltage Vo circuit with
the cell resistance typically falling almost linearly with illuminance from megaohms in
the dark (band gap exceeds the 1/40th eV of thermal energy at room temperature) to a
few ohms.
The response of a photoconductive cell to radiation is determined by the choice of
semiconducting material. Figure 8.15 shows the various materials used to cover the UV
to IR range. Cadmium sulfide is commonly used to make a photoconductive cell for the
visible region (0.4 to 0.7 u.m) because it is inexpensive and easy to process, although other
materials are used for IR photoconductors, such as PbS with a peak response at 2.2 um,
PbSe with a peak response at 2.2 u.m, and HgCdTe (MCT) with a response tailored within
the range of 12 to 16 um.
Photoconductive cells are commercially available at low cost and are commonly
employed in a wide range of applications; examples include light-activated switches for
night lights, dimmers, and children's toys.
8.3.2 Photovoltaic Devices
Photovoltaic, or photoelectric, sensors form the second class of radiation microsensors
and are potentiometric radiation sensors. The basic principle is that the radiation (i.e.
photons) induces a voltage across a semiconductor junction; this effect is known as the
photovoltaic effect. The materials most commonly used to make photovoltaic sensors are
Si for the visible/NIR region, and Ge, InGaAs, InAs, or InSb for the NIR-to-IR region.

dynamic range within the UV-to-IR spectrum
The most obvious advantage of a photovoltaic cell over a photoconductive cell is that it
is compatible with a bipolar process (e.g. Si or GaAs). However, the reduced size and
integrated electronics lead to a higher sensitivity, faster response time (us instead of ms),
and better stability.
Photosensitive diodes, known as photodiodes, can be made in a standard vertical bipolar
process (see Section 4.3.4) such as a p-n diode, or variations on this process, such as
a /7-Si/insulator/n-Si PIN diode, Schottky-type diode, and silicon avalanche diode (see
Figure 8.16).
The basic principle of all these photodiodes is that the photon creates an electron-hole
pair in the space-charge region of the junction. These charges are then separated by the
local field to the different doped regions, and they modify the diode voltage Vd. The diode
voltage is the open circuit voltage Voc and can be measured by reverse-biasing the diode
and finding the voltage dropped across a high external load resistor RL. Then the output
voltage is given by
In
— I and so Voc a In(IR)
(8.19)
where IR is the photocurrent and is proportional to the intensity of incident radiation
and, as usual, Is is the reverse saturation current. Indeed, this equation is the same one
that applied to a thermodiode (see Section 8.2.1 and Equation (8.9)), and so the device
will normally be temperature-sensitive. Thus, the performance of a photodiode can be
improved by either running it at a constant voltage - as low as possible to reduce junction
noise - or it must be temperature-compensated.
An alternative approach is to fabricate a phototransistor rather than a diode. Like
a PTAT device, an IC can be built using two identical transistors; the first produces a
photoinduced collector current ICR and the other produces a reference collector current IC0.

(8.20)
Thus, photodiodes and phototransistors not only have fast response times but can also have
integrated circuitry with, for example, a linearised output voltage or internal temperature
compensation.
8.3.3 Pyroelectric Devices
A pyroelectric material can also be used to make a coulombic radiation sensor and it works
on the principle that the radiation heats up the surface of a pyroelectric crystal (usually
LiTaO3) and reduces the normal polarisation state of the crystal, thereby inducing the
charge to flow off its surface and creating a voltage. Pyroelectric sensors are not very
sensitive to the wavelength of the radiation and cover a wide dynamic range in the IR
spectrum, as illustrated in Figure 8.15. Their dynamic response depends on the thermal
time constant of the device and the electrical time constant of the associated circuit. The
read-out circuit needs to have a very high input impedance and so is usually CMOS
technology.
Pyroelectric sensors are best-suited for detecting short-term changes in the IR signal,
and the most popular application is to detect the slow movement of a human body in

Photoelectric and pyroelectric sensors are made using a relatively mature technology
and so there is a very wide variety of commercially available devices based on different
semiconductor materials, processes, and packages. Table 8.3 gives our choice of the
discrete devices that are commercially available together with their typical characteristics.
The prices shown are based on a one-off price for 1999 and depend on the choice of
package (e.g. metal can versus plastic package). The rise times are often a function of
radiation intensity, with higher levels producing faster responses.
Figure 8.17 shows a photograph of three different radiation microsensors: a CdS photo-
conductive sensor (NORP12) that has a relatively large active area of 12 mm2 and a slow
response time; a p-n photodiode (OSI5K) with an active area of 5 mm2 and an integrated
operational amplifier, and a pyroelectric sensor.
Radiation microsensors, together with temperature ICs, are a relatively mature tech-
nology and, therefore, can be readily employed within an integrated optoelectronic system.
In fact, the technology has advanced to such an extent that arrays of photovoltaic sensors
can be fabricated with associated electronics to make digital line-scan and array cameras.
These devices may be regarded here as smart microsensors because they usually have
integrated digital read-out electronics.
8.3.4 Microantenna
Finally, microwave or short-wavelength radio waves can be detected using a small metal
strip patterned using UV lithography onto a planar surface. The miniature antenna can

detect low-energy microwave signals with a suitable design of the loop. The signal can
then be used, for example, to generate a SAW in a piezoelectric material for a wireless
mechanical sensor or simply to sense the electrical signal and pass it onto a decoder
(Figure 8.18).
As the microstrip can be made of aluminum, it is compatible with standard microtech-
nology and can be deposited along with the aluminum interconnects. However, the
microantenna can also be used as a transmitter, in which case it is acting as a radiation
microactuator.
The use of microantennae in SAW-IDT microsensors is described in Chapter 13 and
again in the concept of a smart electronic tongue in Chapter 15.
The way in which a machine interfaces with a person is important and is likely to
be a key issue in the future when microsensors and MEMS devices become smaller and
more autonomous. Therefore, the integrated microwave antenna may prove to be a very
useful tool in which a human operator can communicate with and remotely control a
small MEMS structure implanted in some inaccessible environment, such as inside the
human body!
8.4 MECHANICAL SENSORS
8.4.1 Overview
Mechanical microsensors are, perhaps, the most important class of microsensor because
of both the large variety of different mechanical measurands and their successful appli-
cation in mass markets, such as the automotive industry. Table 8.4 lists some 50 or so of
the numerous possible mechanical measurands and covers not only static and kinematic
parameters, such as displacement, velocity, and acceleration, but also physical properties
of materials, such as density, hardness, and viscosity.

Classification scheme for mechanical microsensors. From Gardner (1994)
The most important classes of mechanical microsensors to date is a subset of only six or
so and these constitute the majority of the existing market for micromechanical sensors.12
Thus, the main measurands of mechanical microsensors are as follows in alphabetical
order:
• Acceleration/deceleration
• Displacement
• Flow rate
• Force/torque
• Position/angle
• Pressure/stress
12 See Chapter 1 for details of the main markets for mechanical and other types of microsensor.

249
Therefore, we describe in detail here four of the most important types of mechanical
microsensors, namely,
• Pressure microsensors 
(Section 8.4.5)
• Microaccelerometers 
(Section 8.4.6)
• Microgyroscopes 
(Section 8.4.7)
• Flow microsensors 
(Section 8.4.8)
8.4.2 Micromechanical Components and Statics
There are a number of micromechanical structures that are particularly important because
they are used as the basic building blocks for a whole host of different microsensors (and
for microactuators and MEMS). In their simplest form, these micromechanical structures
are simply
• A cantilever beam
• A bridge
• A diaphragm or a membrane13
Figure 8.20 shows a schematic diagram of each of these three types of microstructures
in both plane view and in cross section. The physical dimensions of the structures are
defined in the figures, such as length l, width w, thickness d, and breadth b. In this
example, the bridge is shown on the top of the supporting structure, which as we shall
see subsequently, is a common feature of microbridges.

13 A membrane is formed by tension and a diaphragm is formed by stiffness; therefore, if a structure exhibits
elasticity, it is a diaphragm.

MICROSENSORS
If we assume that these microstructures are made of a uniform, homogeneous, and
elastic material, we can apply a simple theory to describe the way in which they deform
when a mechanical load is applied, such as a force, torque, stress, or pressure.
For example, the free end of a cantilever beam14 will deflect by a distance AJC when
a point load Fx is applied to it (Figure 8.21 (a)). If we ignore gravitational forces and
assume that there is no residual stress in the beam, then the deflection is simply given by
AJC =
/3
3£m/n
(8.21)
where Em is the Young's modulus of the material and lm is the second moment of area
of the beam and related to its width and thickness by
Im = wd3
(8.22)
Equation (8.21) may be rewritten as,
Fx = km Ax where km = 3EmIn
(8.23)
where the constant of proportionality km is called the stiffness or spring constant.
The simple cantilever beam can thus be used to convert a mechanical force into a
displacement. In a similar way, a cantilever beam, bridge, and diaphragm can be used to
measure not only a point force but also a distributed force, such as stress. In addition,
a diaphragm can be used to measure a hydrostatic or barometric pressure. However, in
all these cases, the deflection of the structure has a more complex analytical form, which
depends on the precise nature of the built-in supports.
Basic theory assumes that there is no inherent stress in the microstructure itself because
that would cause movement in the absence of an applied load. However, the structure
could itself be regarded as a sensor for material stress, and so cantilever beams are often
used as test structures on silicon wafers to show that the film deposited has no residual
stress. In fact, bridges can be used to measure the axial compressive load Fy rather than the
Figure 8.21

a beam by an axial compressive load Fy

transverse load shown earlier (Figure 8.2l(b)). In this case, the deflection is not linearly
related to the applied load but a solution can be obtained from the buckling equation of
Euler where
(8.24)
dy2 
EmIm
The solution for a bridge of length / fixed at both ends is a sinusoidal one where
AJC = A sin(y/Fy/EmImy) 
(8.25)
where A is a constant. The beam will buckle when the load reaches a critical value of
Fc = 7i2EmIm/l2 
(8.26)
In a similar manner, analytical equations that relate the static deflection of a microstructure
of different geometry to point and distributed loads and indeed rotations caused by an
applied moment or torque can be found.
Therefore, the important mechanical parameters and properties in the design of static
microstructures can be summarised as shown in Table 8.5.
8.4.3 Microshuttles and Dynamics
The dynamics of microstructures are also very important for several reasons. First, the
dynamic response of a cantilever beam, microbridge, or diaphragm determines the band-
width of the microsensor, that is, the time taken for the structure to respond to the applied
static load or follow a dynamic load. Second, the kinetics of the structure can be used in
inertial sensors to measure linear and angular accelerations. Finally, there is a class of
mechanical sensors based on a microstructure or a microshuttle that is forced to resonate
at some characteristic frequency.
In an inertial or resonant sensor, the cantilever beam (or bridge) is redesigned so that
the mass is more localised and the supports more convoluted. Figure 8.22 shows the
basic design of an inertial or so-called microflexural type of structure together with its
equivalent lumped-system model.

The dynamic equation of motion of a simple microflexural structure can be approxi-
mated to a one-dimensional lumped-system model and is given by
mx
bmx + kmx = Fx(t)
(8.27)
where bm is the damping coefficient, km is the stiffness constant (see Equation (8.23)),
and m is the end mass (ignoring the thin support). Equation (8.27) can readily be solved
using the method of Laplace transforms, provided the three coefficients are constant and
hence independent of both displacement x and time t. The Laplace transform of the
displacement X(s) is related to the Laplace transform of the applied force F(s) by the
characteristic transfer function H(s) of the structure. Hence, the dynamical response of
the structure is described using the complex Laplace parameter s by
X(s) = H(s)F(s) =
1
ms2
bms
•F(s)
(8.28)
The application of a sinusoidal force at a drive frequency (angular) w causes the mass to
oscillate; its characteristic curve, obtained from Equation (8.28), is shown in Figure 8.23.
The resonant frequency w0 and damping factor £ of the simple microflexural system are
given by
coo = v/fcm/m and £ = bm/2^/kmm 
(8.29)
Thus, the response or gain15 of the structure varies with the stiffness and damping of the
structure as well as the nature of the applied load, including a gravitational or inertial
force.
There are a number of different designs of microflexural structures and three of the
basic types - the hammock, folded, and crab-leg - are shown in Figure 8.24. The folding
of the supports changes its effective stiffness and so extends the linear range of deflection.
Here the gain is the ratio of the amplitudes of the output to the input signals.

Table 8.6 provides the characteristic properties of these flexures, in which their dynam-
ical response is much more complicated than that of a simple end mass and is often
determined using computational methods, for example, a finite-element or finite-difference
analysis.
When designing dynamic structures, we need to consider some additional parameters,
which are listed in Table 8.7.
8.4.4 Mechanical Microstmctures
The two most important questions that now need to be asked by the designer are as follows.
First, if these mechanical structures can be made on the micron scale and second, if they
still follow classical theory, for example, the linear theory of elasticity.
We know that microbeams, microbridges, and microdiaphragms can all be made in
silicon using the bulk- and surface-micromicromaching techniques, which were described
in Chapters 5 and 6. In fact, a number of worked examples of the process flow to fabricate
the following microstructures were given:
• A cantilever beam made of undoped silicon 
(WE 5.1)
• A thin cantilever beam 
(WE 5.4)
• A free-standing polysilicon beam 
(WE 6.1)
• An array of thin diaphragms/membranes 
(WE 5.3)
• A comb resonant structure 
(WE 6.7)

[110], and 79 GPa for [100]
Clearly, the microstructures can then be fabricated from single-crystal silicon, polycrys-
talline silicon, and also from metals and other types of material. The processes shown also
demonstrate that the residual strain is negligible because the cantilevers and diaphragms
shown are neither curling nor buckling when free from any external load.
Table 8.8 summarises the mechanical properties of some of the materials that have
been used to make micromechanical structures and are important in their practical design
and usage. Other important physical properties of these materials, such as density, thermal
conductivity, and heat capacity, may be found in the Appendices F (metals), G (semicon-
ductors), and H (ceramics and polymers).
As stated in Table 8.8, the question that must be asked is whether a material behaves
on the micron scale in the same way as it does on the macro scale? The answer to this
important question is 'yes' for pure single-crystal silicon. In this case, there are very few
defects and so structures on the micron scale have the same fundamental properties as on
the large scale. In fact, the same rule also applies for polycrystalline materials provided
the average grain size is much smaller than the smallest dimension of the microstructure.
As the typical grain size in low-pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD) polysilicon
is 50 to 80 nm, the material will behave elastically down to about the micron level. The
same rule can be applied to other polycrystalline materials, such as metals.
Accordingly, we can apply classical geometric scaling rules to structures down to a
few microns in size without a breakdown in the laws. For example, a reduction in the
size of a cantilever structure will increase its resonant frequency by a factor K but reduce
its mass by K3, deflection by K, spring constant by K, and so on.
Finally, we must consider the types of transducer for a microstructure that convert its
deflection into an electrical quantity. There are a number of different ways in which the
movement could be detected such as
• Capacitive (electrostatic) pickup
• Resistive (conductive) pickup
• Inductive (amperometric) pickup
The two most commonly used forms of transduction are capacitive and resistive.
Figure 8.25 shows a microflexure in which its end is capacitively coupled to a stationary
sense electrode.

Therefore, a change in capacitance is related to changes in the plate separation d, area
of overlap A, and dielectric permittivity e. The capacitance of a structure with a 200 urn
square area and a separation of 4 urn is about 0.1 picofarads. Therefore, it is necessary
to measure changes in capacitance to a resolution on the order of 10 fF or less!
Many silicon mechanical microsensors use this principle to measure a vertical deflec-
tion (with A and e constant) because the area can be made relatively large and the gap
size small, that is, a few microns. This means that the change in capacitance can be
measured using integrated electronics with an acceptable sensitivity. Another advantage
of a capacitive pickup is that the input impedance is high and so little current is consumed;
hence, the method is suitable for use in battery-operated devices with integrated CMOS
circuitry. However, it is difficult to sense lateral deflections of silicon structures fabri-
cated by standard surface-micromachining techniques because the resulting structures are
only a few microns high. Comb structures are often used to increase the area of overlap,
and the change in area of overlap is used to measure the deflection. Even so, very large
structures are needed to achieve useful values of the capacitance. That is why lithography,
electroplating, and moulding process (LIGA) and other techniques, such as deep reactive
ion etching (RIE), are required to make much thicker structures and therefore measure
lateral deflections in a more practical way. However, this basic problem applies whether
one tries to sense the deflection of a microflexural structure or drive it electrostatically in
a microactuator.
The other important type of pickup is through a piezoresistor (see Figure 8.26). Piezore-
sistors can be made easily either as a region of doped single-crystal silicon (SCS) in a
bulk-micromachined structure or as a doped polysilicon region in a surface-micromachined
structure. The gauge factor Kgf of a strain gauge defines its sensitivity and simply relates
the change in fractional electrical resistance A/? to the mechanical strain em

Doped silicon resistors (piezoresistors) can be made at a very low cost and have a strain
gauge factor that is much higher (~50 to 100) than that for metals (~2). However, it is
harder to control the exact resistance of the silicon piezoresistor and, more importantly,
its actual gauge factor is strongly dependent on both the doping level and the ambient
temperature. Consequently, an embedded temperature sensor is essential for a precise
measurement of the strain and hence any static displacement by this method. This problem
is not so critical in a dynamic structure where it is only necessary to measure the frequency
of oscillation; however, care is still needed because the deposition of the piezoresistor
may itself induce stress in the microstructure and cause a shift in its natural resonant
frequency!
8.4.5 Pressure Microsensors
Pressure microsensors were the first type of silicon micromachined sensors to be devel-
oped in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Consequently, the pressure microsensors represent
probably the most mature silicon micromechanical device with widespread commercial
availability today. The largest market is undoubtedly the automotive, and Table 8.9 shows
the enormous growth in the world market for automotive silicon micromachined sensors
from 1989 to 1999. The two most important silicon sensors are the pressure and microac-
celerometer (Section 8.4.6) sensors, with substantial growth expected for gyrometers
(Section 8.4.7), which will be used for navigation.

Figure 8.27 Basic types of silicon pressure sensors based on a vertical deflection: (a) piezo-
resistive (polysilicon) and (b) capacitive (single-crystal silicon)
The two most common methods to fabricate pressure microsensors are bulk and surface
micromachining of polysilicon. Silicon diaphragms can be made using either technique
as described earlier. Figure 8.27 illustrates the basic principles of a piezoresistive sensor
and a capacitive pressure sensor.
The deflection in the diaphragm can be measured using piezoresistive strain gauges
located in the appropriate region of maximum strain, as shown in Figure 8.27(a). The
strain gauges are usually made from doped silicon and are designed in pairs with a read-
out circuit such as a Wheatstone bridge. The change in strain can be related to the applied
pressure (P — P0) and stored in a lookup table. The precise relationship depends on the
relevant piezoresistive coefficient n of the diaphragm material.
Voutoc A/?ocn(/>-/> 0)
(8.32)
A single crystal of silicon is a desirable material to use for the diaphragm because neither
creep nor hysteresis occurs. The piezoresistive constant (044) is typically +1–138.1 pC/N
and that makes measuring pressure in the range of 0 to 1 MPa relatively straightforward.
Figure 8.27(b) shows the general arrangement of a single-crystal silicon pressure sensor
with capacitive pickup. In this case, a capacitive bridge can be formed with two reference

capacitors and the output voltage is related to the deflection of the membrane A* and
hence the applied pressure (P — P0).
Vout a AC a AJC a (P - P0) 
(8.33)
In this case, the accurate positioning of the pickup electrodes is crucial.
By controlling the background pressure P0, it is possible to fabricate the following
basic types of pressure sensors:
• An absolute pressure sensor that is referenced to a vacuum (P0 = 0)
• A gauge-type pressure sensor that is referenced to atmospheric pressure (P0 = 1 atm)
• A differential 
or relative type (P0 is constant).
There are advantages and disadvantages of capacitive against piezoresistive pressure
sensors and these are summarised in Table 8.10.
The main advantage of using bulk micromachining is that the electronic circuit can
be more readily integrated. There are many examples of capacitive pressure sensors with
digital readout. Readers are directed toward Worked Example 6.8 for the process flow of
an air gap capacitive pressure sensor with digital readout. An example of a capacitive
pressure sensor is shown in Figure 8.28 with a 100 urn polysilicon diaphragm and inte-
grated capacitance circuit (Kung and Lee 1992). The output voltage from the integrated
n-type metal oxide semiconductor (nMOS) circuit is also shown against air pressure in
non-Si units of PSI. This design achieves a high resolution by using integrated electronics.
An alternative approach to enhance the sensitivity of silicon pressure sensors was
proposed by Greenwood in 1988 and comprised the use of a resonant microstructure.
Figure 8.29 shows the micromechanical structure bulk-micromachined out of single-
crystal silicon (Greenwood 1988).
The basic principle is the change of resonant frequency of oscillation of this structure
when the pressure on the diaphragm causes it to curve. In turn, this curvature creates
tension in the shuttle mass supports and this shifts its resonant frequency. The dynamical
equation that governs the behavior is a modified version of Equation (8.27) to include
a tension term, which affects the effective spring constant km. The resonant (torsional)

(parts per million (ppm) per year) through the running of the resonator in a partial vacuum.
Accordingly, it is possible to achieve a high mechanical Q factor, here about 18 000 at a
pressure of approximately 1 Pa, and hence achieve very high pressure sensitivities.

Further efforts have been made to fabricate a lateral resonant capacitive sensor
employing thin film polysilicon technology. Figure 8.30(a) shows a resonant capacitive
sensor fabricated in polysilicon along with its response (Figure 8.30(b)). The nonlinear
response is fitted using a high-order polynomial and temperature effects are
compensated for.
Here, the microstructure behaves as a nonlinear resonator and Equation (8.27) is
extended to describe a hard spring (Duffin's equation) so that

MICROSENSORS
The solution to Equation (8.34) is interesting because it has two possible deflections
at certain frequencies. However, running the oscillator at low deflections using closed-
loop feedback avoids this stability issue. The problem with this structure is that the
capacitances for drive and sensing are too low because the microshuttle is only 1 to 5 um
thick. However, recent developments of LIGA and deep RIE now make resonant lateral
structures a practical device. The resonator has now been redesigned by Welham et al.
(2000) to overcome these problems together with a piezoresistive pickup. Figure 8.30(c)
shows the new silicon process and the fabricated device is shown in Figure 8.30(d). These

devices have an accuracy of 0.01 percent root-mean-square (rms) or better, which, so far,
exceeds that for static pressure sensors. The product is being commercialised by Druck
Ltd (UK) as a precision pressure sensor because it is relatively expensive to make.
Nevertheless, the preferred technology today is bulk silicon-micromachined piezo-
resistive pressure sensors because of low cost, robustness and ease of circuit integration.
Table 8.11 summarises the current automotive pressure sensor applications (Madou 1997).
Clearly, the automotive market for pressure sensors is enormous and commercial
devices are available today from Motorola, NovaSensor, SSI Technologies, and other
manufacturers. As costs are driven down, the move toward piezoresistive polysilicon is
desirable but creates some stability and precision issues. Therefore, we may see the appear-
ance of alternative technologies to make diaphragms such as silicon on insulator (SOI).
8.4.6 Microaccelerometers
The second most important type of mechanical microsensors is inertial and measures, for
example, linear acceleration and angular velocity. Inertial sensors are again a mass market
in the automotive industry, second only to pressure sensors.
Microaccelerometers are based on the cantilever principle in which an end mass (or
shuttle) displaces under an inertial force. Thus, the dynamics can be described in simple
terms by the second-order system of a mass-spring damper described earlier.
Figure 8.31 shows the basic principle of the two most important types: capacitive
pickup of the seismic mass movement and piezoresistive pickup.
The capacitive polysilicon surface-micromachined and single-crystal-micromachined
devices are probably the most prevalent and generally come with high g and low g varia-
tions. Microaccelerometers are now produced in their millions with sophisticated damping
and overload protection. For example, Lucas Novasensor make a bulk microactuator for
self-testing. Analog Devices introduced a capacitive polysilicon surface-micromachined
device in 1991 (AXDL-50).
The main markets of microaccelerorneters are in automatic braking system (ABS) and
suspension systems (0 to 2 g) and air bag systems (up to 50 g). Table 8.12 gives the
data about the US market in automotive accelerometers over the past decade. The market
today is worth some €200 M in the United States alone. It should be noted that the

risen.
The more recent ADXL 250 (Analog Devices) employs a folded flexure structure for
improved linearity and provides two-axis measurement. In contrast, Figure 8.32 shows
the CSEM MS6100 precision low-power capacitive accelerometer (170 uA at 3 V) with
high dynamic stability (2 mg for 2 g sensor) but poor low-temperature stability (typical
offset is 200 ug/°C).
Table 8.13 provides a comparison of the specification of some commercially available
microaccelerometers.
Through increasing the damping and stiffness of the microresonators, it is possible
to increase the dynamic range further; therefore, microaccelerometers are also used in
military applications, such as missile control.

8.4.7 Microgyrometers
The second type of inertial sensor is the gyroscope that measures the change in orientation
of an object. Silicon-micromachined gyroscopes have been fabricated on the basis of
coupled resonators. The basic principle is that there is a transfer of energy from one
resonator to another because of the Coriolis force. Thus, a simple mass m supported by
springs in the x- and y-axes and rotated around the z-axis at an angular velocity Q has
the following equations of motion.
mx + bx + kxx — 2m£2y = Fx
(8.35)
my + by + kyy + 2m£2jc = Fy
where the terms 2mfii and 2mQy describe the Coriolis forces and the resonant frequen-
cies are
w0x = ^/kx/m 
and aty = Jky/m 
(8.36)
Now assume that the resonators are excited and behave harmonically with the amplitudes
a(t) and b(t). By fixing the amplitude of one oscillator (a0) by feedback and then for
synchronous oscillators (w0x = w0y), the equations simply reduce to
db 
/ c \
— + ( — U + Qoo = 0 
(8.37)
dt 
V2m/
Under a constant rotation, the steady-state solution to Equation (8.37) is a constant ampli-
tude b0 where
(
>j \
— JaoQ 
(8.38)
Therefore, the amplitude of the undriven oscillator is linearly proportional to the rotation
or precession rate £2.
The first silicon coupled resonator gyrometer was developed by Draper Laboratory
in the early 1990s and its arrangement is shown in Figure 8.33. The device is bulk-
micromachined and supported by torsional beams with micromass made from doped
(p++) single-crystal silicon (SCS). The outer gimbal was driven electrostatically at a
constant amplitude and the inner gimbal motion was sensed. The rate resolution was only
4 deg s-1 and bandwidth was just 1 Hz.
More advanced gyroscopes have been fabricated using surface micromachining of
poly silicon. There are a number of examples of coupled resonator gyroscopes such as the
MARS-RR1 gyroscope reported by Geiger et al. (1998). The performance of this device
is provided in Table 8.14.
There are reports of a number of other types of device to measure precision rates; the
IDT MEMS device described in Chapter 14 is one such example. Another is the ring
gyroscope that again works by the Coriolis force transferring energy from one mode into
another at 45° (Ayazi and Najifi 1998). The basic approach is attractive but does require
a deep etch to produce viable devices. Figure 8.34 shows two ring gyroscopes. The first
was made at the University of Michigan (Ayazi and Najifi 1998), whereas the second is
a prototype made by DERA Malvern, (UK).

There is considerable interest in silicon gyroscopes in the defence industries for control-
ling missiles, but low-cost commercial devices for nonmilitary applications (e.g. automo-
tive) are now appearing.
8.4.8 Flow Microsensors
The measurement of the flow rate of a gas (or liquid) is important in a number of
different fields from automotive and aerospace to the chemical industries. For example, it
is important to know the amount of fuel flowing into an engine or domestic gas supplied to
boilers in homes. Indeed, there are a number of traditional ways to measure flow directly
(e.g. a rotating vane) and indirectly through the differential pressure (orifice plate, Venturi
tube, and Pilot tube). Here, we are interested in the measurement of flow using novel
micromechanical sensors. One possible method is to use an ultrasonic technique such as
a SAW device but, as these are covered elsewhere, we will focus here on other types of
micromechanical devices.
The most commonly used principle to detect flow in gases and liquids using microsen-
sors is based on the concepl of a ihermal flow sensor lhat was first postulated by Thomas
in 1911. The basic principle is shown in Figure 8.35 in which the heat transferred per
unit time (Ph) from a resistive wire heater to a moving liquid is monitored at two points
via ihermocouple temperature sensors.
When a steady state has been achieved, the mass flow rate Qm is related to the differ-
ence in the temperalures (T2 — T1) and is given by
G« = ^ = —(Ti-r,) 
(8.39)
dr 
cm
where cm is the specific heat capacity of the fluid, assuming that there is no heat loss from
the wall of the tube. The mass flow rate of the liquid can be converted to the volumetric
flow rate Qv via its density pm:
Qv = — = — 
(8.40)
The placing of the heating coil and temperature sensors within the walling of a
pipe (Figure 8.35(b)) makes more practical sense and the embodiment is the so-called

boundary-layer flow meter. Unfortunately, the relationship between the flow rate and
temperature difference is more complex and the precise relationship should be determined
experimentally for different fluids. For more details on boundary layer thermal sensors,
readers are referred to Meijer and van Herwaarden (1994).
A number of different silicon-micromachined flow sensors have been reported since the
late 1980s. For example, Johnson and Higashi reported in 1987 on the use of bulk micro-
machining to make a pair of silicon microbridges. There is a thermistor on top and each
rnicrobridge and a resistive heater is split between the two as shown in Figure 8.36(a).
The silicon rnicrobridge structure is advantageous because it is thermally isolated and,
therefore, the power loss of the heater is minimised. In this case, 1 mW of power produces
a 15 °C rise in temperature in a gas. The temperature difference is measured in a Wheat-
stone bridge and the voltage output is shown in Figure 8.36(b) for air, carbon monoxide,
and methane.
The device can be used to measure flow velocities of up to 30 m/s in a 5 urn by 250 um
channel. The mass flow rate is related to the velocity v by
Qm = PmAv 
(8.41)
In a slightly different approach, Stemme (1986) replaced the rnicrobridge by a cantilever
beam and incorporated a layer of polyimide to help thermally isolate the heater from the
substrate. In this case, the thermistors have been replaced by thermodiodes and the sensor
has integrated CMOS circuitry. Flow velocities of up to 30 m/s can again be measured
but this time with about half the power consumption.
Since the late 1980s, commercial silicon flow-rate sensors have been manufactured in
large numbers. For example, Honeywell make several different air flow-rate sensors using
the thermal flow silicon microbridge approach. Table 8.15 summarises the specification
of two current products that can be used to measure the volumetric flow rate of gases. The

commercial flow-rate microsensor has onboard thermal compensation but the unit must
be calibrated for different gases (or gas mixtures) because of their different densities and
thermal capacities.
There are now a number of other types of flow sensors that have been reported.
They range from relatively simple devices, for example, a low-cost CMOS-based wind
meter, which was first described by Oudheisen and Huijsing in 1990 to the more complex
devices, for example, a recently improved version, which has a thermal sigma-delta
modulation system (Makinwa and Huijsing 2000). However, the application of silicon
flow sensors is likely to increase significantly over the next few years because of the
growing importance of the field of microfluidics in MEMS. There is a need to monitor
the flow-rate of different compounds - when they flow inside microfluidic systems that
are now referred to as micro total analysis systems (u-TAS). These systems permit entire
chemical reactions to take place on the silicon wafer and are pioneering by a number
of research laboratories such as the Institute of Microtechnology in Neuchatel, Switzer-
land. The advantages of making reactions take place on silicon are clear in that the
volumes of expensive reagents are very low and the process can be fully automated
on chip - an approach that is commonly referred to these days as 'laboratory-on-a-
chip.'
8.5 MAGNETIC SENSORS
In this section, we focus on the basic principles of these different kinds of magnetic
microsensors together with some examples of commercial products and research devices.
Figure 8.37 shows the various kinds of magnetic microsensors that can be used to measure
the magnetic flux density B. The devices are classified here according to the form of the
output signal rather than the energy domain of the input signal used earlier.
Clearly, some of these magnetic microsensors are also employed within other types
of sensors; for example, a Hall effect device can be used to measure the proximity of a
magnet and it then becomes a mechanical (magnetic) sensor, and so on.
The typical characteristics of magnetic microsensors are summarised in Table 8.16 and
the details are discussed in the subsequent sections.

8.5.1 Magnetogalvanic Microsensors
The magnetogalvanic effect was first discovered by Hall in 1879 and is the fundamental
principle that governs the operation of a Hall plate magnetic sensor. Figure 8.38 shows the
schematic drawing of a Hall device. When a current Ix is passed down a slab of material
of length / and thickness d and a perpendicular magnetic flux density Bz is applied, a
voltage VH appears across the slab perpendicular to Ix and B, and can be measured.
The theoretical Hall voltage VH can be obtained from the simple transport theory and
is given by
ne
d
(8.42)
where n is the carrier density and RH is called the Hall coefficient. The Hall coefficient
of metals is rather small and has a typical value of approximately —1 x 10-4 cm3/C that
is close to the theoretical value. The Hall coefficient is much larger in a semiconducting
material, and Figure 8.39 shows the variation of the Hall voltage with carrier concentration
for n- and p-type materials.
The Hall voltage of a semiconducting slab is generally defined as
-^
ne
ne
(P-Si)
(8.43)
rn/p is the first correction factor that depends on the carrier scattering process and energy-
band structure and varies from about 1.15 for n-Si to about 0.7 for p-Si, whereas kg is a
second correction factor that corrects for the finite geometry of the slab and takes a value
of 0.7 or so. Equation (8.43) then shows the approximate Hall voltage for an extrinsic
semiconductor, from which the sensitivity S1 can be found, that is,

Figure 8.40 Schematic layout of a Hall effect magnetic microsensor fabricated in (a) a bipolar
IC process and (b) an nMOS C process
A Hall plate sensor can be fabricated using standard 1C processes and generally employs
an n-type material that has higher carrier mobility. For example, Figure 8.40 shows the
layout of a substrate Hall plate sensor made from a bipolar process and a CMOS process.
The lateral bipolar Hall effect IC has an n-type epilayer plate isolated by a deep p-type
diffusion to be about 200 um square with an electron density n of 1015 cm-3 and thickness
of 5 um or so. The Hall contacts are then defined by a shallow n+ diffusion region and
the metal interconnect (not shown) is patterned on top. The design of the nMOS Hall
effect IC device is similar except that the plate is defined by an N-well. Both ICs measure
the horizontal magnetic flux density (i.e. in the plane of the 1C).
Therefore, Hall devices can be made using either a standard bipolar IC process or a
standard N-well CMOS process (see Chapter 4). Bipolar devices tend to have a sensitivity
SI of about 50 V/AT, whereas nMOS devices can be as high as 1000 V/AT. The higher
value is achieved by using an ultrathin Hall layer d of around 10 nm, which more than
compensates for lower carrier mobility.

274 
MICROSENSORS
A large variety of Hall effect devices are commercially available (e.g. from Siemens)
with different designs, packages, and output signals. For example, a general-purpose linear
Hall effect IC (RS 304–267) is available in a 4-pin dual-in-line (DIL) plastic package
to detect magnetic flux densities of ±40 mT. The supply voltage is 4 to 10 V direct
current (DC) with a current output in the milliampere range and a sensitivity of about
10 V/T. Linear Hall effect devices are also commercially available and these have an
integrated transconductance amplifier to provide a linear output voltage. For example,
the RS 650–532 (RS Components Ltd) comes in a 3-pin in-line surface-mounted package
with its thick film resistors laser-trimmed in a hybrid16 (ceramic) circuit to give a voltage
sensitivity of 75 ± 2 V/T.
One problem associated with a Hall plate device is that the offset voltage becomes
significant at low magnetic flux densities and, therefore, an alternative is to use a magne-
toresistive device (see next section) that has a higher sensitivity. This offset problem can
be reduced by spinning the Hall plate and averaging the signal (Bellekom 1998), but a
more practical solution is to employ a magnetoresistor or, when needing a standard IC
process, to employ a magnetodiode or magnetotransistor instead (see Section 8.5.3).
8.5.2 Magnetoresistive Devices
The resistance of a semiconducting material is influenced by the application of an external
magnetic flux density Bz. In this effect, known as magnetoresistivity, the resistance R of
a slab of the material (see Figure 8.38 for basic layout) depends on the Hall angle 9\\ and
is given by
R = R0(1 + tan2 #H) and OH « k^2B\ 
(8.45)
R0 is the resistance of the slab at zero flux density. The Hall angle is the angle by which
the direction of the current Ix is rotated as a result of the Lorentzian force that acts on
the charge carriers and is related to the mobility n of the carrier. The ideal, theoretical
value is corrected by a geometrical factor kg that depends on the actual aspect ratio of
the slab. Ideally, the slab should be much wider than longer and the Hall voltage must
be shorted out.
The low carrier mobility in silicon (nn ~ 1600 cm2/Vs) makes the effect rather small
and so other materials are used that exhibit a giant magnetoresistive effect. For example,
InSb has a very high electron mobility of 70000 cm2/Vs and when doped with NiSb can
produce a high sensitivity of about 700%/T as illustrated in Figure 8.41.
The strong temperature-dependence of the response of a giant magnetoresistor needs
compensation. Magnetoresistors are relatively inexpensive to make but are not compat-
ible with an IC process like a Hall effect IC or magnetodiode/transistor. Therefore, the
integration of a giant magnetoresistor into a silicon MEMS structure would be diffi-
cult. More recently, research has been directed toward perovskite materials that exhibit
a so-called 'colossal' magnetoresistance and may also be used as the dielectric mate-
rial in submicron ICs because of their high dielectric constant and high breakdown field
strength.

8.5.3 Magnetodiodes and Magnetotransistors
Figure 8.42 shows the schematic layout of two types of diode. The first is made using a
silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) IC process in which carriers are injected from both the n+ and
p+ junctions and drift under the action of the electric field. The magnetic flux density is
applied perpendicular to the carrier flow, and a difference in the recombination rates at
the two junctions occurs (Suhl effect). The difference in recombination rates modifies the
I-V characteristics of the diode, and the forward voltage sensitivity is given by,
Sv =
dVf
dB
•v;
(8.46)
where ^n and IJLP are the electron and hole mobilities, reff is the effective lifetime of the
carrier, v\ and v2 are the recombination rates at the two junctions, and the thickness d
of the n– diffusion region is less than the ambipolar diffusion length. The SOS structure
provides high recombination on one side (Si—Al2O3) and low on the other (Si—SiO2) to
give a sensitivity Sv of about 5 V/T (Lutes et al. 1980). However, this device is highly
nonlinear and has an output that depends strongly on temperature or the roughness of
the two surfaces. The second structure can be made from a standard IC process, for
example, CMOS. The device looks like a transistor but is operated as a diode, and the
reversed biased p-n (collector) junction becomes the high recombination surface. When
the magnetic field is applied, the collector current IC changes and so does the base
resistivity and hence the base-emitter voltage VBE This can produce a forward voltage
sensitivity of about 25 V/T (Popovic et al. 1984) that is five times greater than that of
the SOS device.

Gardner (1994)
The poor control of the recombination rates in a magnetodiode makes them problematic.
A better approach is to fabricate a magnetotransistor. Two effects can take place in a
magnetotransistor as a result of the effect of the Lorentz force on the current carriers;
first, generation of a Hall voltage in the active region, such as a Hall plate device, causes
a modulation of the emitter injection current; and second, the deflection of the injected
minority carrier current can be measured using a split collector. The domination of one
process or another depends on the design of the device. For example, Figure 8.43 shows
the structures of two different devices. The first device is a drift-aided lateral p-n-p
transistor fabricated using a standard bipolar process with two collectors, C1 and C2. A
voltage applied between the base contacts b1 and b2 causes it to behave like a Hall plate;
the emitter current IE deflected by the Lorentz force causes a difference in the collector
currents according to
= (IC1 —
(8.47)

MAGNETIC SENSORS 
277
In the second device, the collectors are now outside the base pads and the Lorentz force
creates opposing Hall fields in the emitter and base areas. Therefore, the injected emitter
current is modulated differently and so is the current flowing through the collectors. The
second device has a higher sensitivity (7%/T) than the first device (0.5 to 5%/T).
A bipolar device can also be designed in which both processes occur. Figure 8.44(a)
shows a photograph of such a device together with a plot of the difference in the collector
current against magnetic flux density (Avram et al. 1998). The plot shows that, when in
a common-base configuration, the collector current difference of the magnetotransistor is
a linear function of the applied flux density, as predicted by Equation (8.46), and has a
sensitivity of about 250 uA/T.
Magnetotransistors, like magnetodiodes, can also be made from a standard lateral or
vertical CMOS or diffusion-channel MOS (DMOS) process, which has the advantage of
higher sensitivities. Interested readers are referred to Middelhoek and Audet (1989) for
further details. Despite the promise of these latter devices, the most successful commercial
device is the Hall effect IC, which is simple and inexpensive to process.
8.5.4 Acoustic Devices and SQUIDs
Although a Hall effect IC is of practical use in many situations, there is a general problem
of low sensitivity. One possible solution, that is rather attractive, is to use magnetic
microsensors based on a delay-line SAW device. Figure 8.45 shows the basic structure
of a SAW magnetic sensor (Hanna 1987).

Ge0.9Fe4.1O12) is grown.
2. This step is followed by the thermal evaporation of a layer of aluminum of about
100 nm thick.
3. A thin layer of ZnO is then sputtered down to improve the electromechanical coupling
of the Love waves to the magnetic garnet film.
4. Finally, an IDT metallisation layer is deposited by thermal evaporation18 and the elec-
trode structure is patterned using UV photolithography and a wet etch. The distance
between the IDT transducers is set to be 6000 um.
The propagation of the SAW is modified by the magnetoelastic coupling between the
magnetic spin and the strain fields. In other words, the SAW device is operating simply
as a strain sensor in which the strain is induced in the garnet film by magnetostriction.
17 Love waves, and other surface acoustic waves, are explained in Chapter 10.
18 An alternate lift-off process is described in Chapter 12.

The shift in oscillator frequency is a nonlinear function F(.) of the magnetic flux density

frequency of 105 MHz. The sensitivity of the SAW device is high and is enhanced by a
DC magnetic field with a value of about 250 Hz/mT, and the resolution is therefore on
the order of microtesla. The high sensitivity of a SAW magnetic sensor is a significant
advantage over a Hall effect IC or magnetodiode, and the process could be made compat-
ible with SOI. Furthermore, the addition of a microantenna and reflectors would enable
the creation of a wireless magnetic sensor similar to the wireless SAW temperature sensor
(Bao et al. 1994).
The most sensitive of all magnetic sensors is known as a superconducting quantum
interference device (SQUID). A SQUID comprises a ring structure made from a supercon-
ducting material (e.g. a high-temperature superconductor) that is interrupted by either one

Ibias is applied, with currents passing through each Josephson junction. The magnetic flux
inside the loop 0jnt must be quantised in units of the quantum flux 0o, which takes a
value of h/2e or 2.07 fWb. Thus, the internal flux is a measure of the external flux <£ext

voltage can be averaged and the typical V-I characteristic of a DC SQUID is shown in
Figure 8.47(a), where I0 is the peak current flowing through the junctions and R is the
junction resistance.
An integrated DC SQUID has been reported (Koch 1989) and the basic layout is shown
in Figure 8.47(b). The SQUID ring is made of a thin superconducting film that is shaped
like a square washer, a large pickup coil and a smaller input coil. The washer acts as a
ground plane to the input coil and hence improves the coupling between the spiral input
coil and the SQUID ring. The input coil has an inductance of 100 nH, whereas the SQUID
loop is about 1000 times less at only 100 pH. The integrated SQUID can then be run in
an AC bridge with the deflection as a measure of the external magnetic flux and hence
the flux density. Flux densities as low as 10-14 T can be measured, which is comparable
with those emitted from the human heart or brain. Moreover, as the SQUID can be run
at radio frequencies, it is possible to power and measure the flux density in a wireless
fashion.
To sum up, magnetic microsensors are currently employed in a range of other mechan-
ical sensors, such as proximity sensors, speed sensors, flow sensors, and so on. Therefore,

their main use is when they can be integrated into another microcomponent, such as a
MEMS device. For example, a magnetic microsensor could be used in a micromotor to
either monitor or control the movement of the rotor. Ideally, the magnetic microsensor
should be placed within the feedback arm of the closed-loop control of a microactuator
or MEMS device.
8.6 BIO(CHEMICAL) SENSORS
The general topic of chemical sensors is well covered in the standard literature on sensors
(Madou and Morrison 1989; Gopel et al. 1989–1998; Taylor et al. 1996).
The basic components of a bio(chemical)19 sensor are illustrated in Figure 8.48 and
comprise a chemically sensitive layer interfaced to a sensing transducer. The analyte
molecules interact with the chemically sensitive layer and produce a physical change that
is detected by the transducer and are converted into an electrical output signal.
The nature of this interaction is determined by the type of material used and can be
either a reversible process or an irreversible reaction (see Figure 8.49). In a reversible
binding reaction, the analyte is typically bound to specific sites within the sensitive layer,
and when the external concentration is removed, the analyte molecules dissociate and
there is no net change. An example of this would be the adsorption and desorption
of an organic vapour in a polymeric material. In an irreversible reaction, the analyte
undergoes a chemical reaction catalysed by the sensitive layer and therefore is consumed
in the process. In this case, removal of the external analyte concentration still reverses
the process but the associated time-constant may be considerably longer. The irreversible
19 A bio(chemical) sensor can be either a biosensor or a chemical sensor. In general, a biosensor either detects
biological material or uses it in the active layer.

reaction is in fact more common and its sensitivity and selectivity varies with the shape
and charge distributions of the analyte molecule and sensitive layer. The most selective
reactions tend to be those like the key-lock mechanism that operates in a biological sensor
(biosensor), such as a glucose sensor. However, the poor stability of biological materials
makes them unsuitable for use in a real sensor that operates many thousands or millions
of times with a lifetime of a year or more but more suited to a single measurement, that
is, a disposable sensor. For this reason, we concentrate predominantly here on the field
of chemical sensors; anyone interested specifically in biosensors is referred to books by
Cass (1990) and Taylor and coworkers (1996).

Here, we are going to discuss the two most important types of chemical microsensor, their
commercial availability, and the developments associated with current research devices.
The topic of mechanical bio(chemical) microsensors is already covered elsewhere in this
book with the principles of acoustic sensors described in Chapters 9 to 12 and that of
chemical acoustic microsensors in Chapter 13. Moreover, we expand upon and introduce
new concepts of chemical sensors through a description of electronic noses and electronic
tongues in Chapter 15 on smart sensors.
8.6.1 Conductimetric Devices
Conductimetric gas sensors are based on the principle of measuring a change in the
electrical resistance of a material upon the introduction of the target gas. The most common
type of gas sensor employs a solid-state material as the gas-sensitive element (Moseley
and Tofield 1987). The principal class of material used today is semiconducting metal
oxides, with tin oxide (SnO2) being the most popular. For example, Figure 8.51 shows
the structure of a Taguchi-type tin oxide gas sensor; millions of these are sold by Figaro
Engineering Inc. (Japan). Complete details of Taguchi devices can be found in a book on
stannic oxide gas sensors by Ihokura and Watson (1994).
The device consists of a wire-wound platinum heater coil inside a ceramic former onto
which a thick layer of porous tin oxide is painted manually. The film is then sintered at a
high temperature so that the appropriate nanocrystalline structure is formed. The electrical
resistance of the sintered film is then measured by a pair of gold electrodes and basic
potential divider circuit.

BIO(CHEMICAL) SENSORS

series-8 commercial gas sensor (Courtesy of Figaro Engineering, Japan)
Tin oxide devices are operated at various high temperatures and doped with different
materials to enhance their specificity. The response of a tin oxide sensor, in terms of its
relative conductance Gs/G0, where Gs is the conductance of a gas of fixed concentration
and GO is the conductance in air, is shown in Figure 8.52 (Yamazoe et al. 1983). The
devices are operated at high temperatures (typically between 300 and 400 °C) for several
reasons. First, and most important, the chemical reaction is more specific at higher temper-
atures, and, second, the reaction kinetics are much faster, that is, the device responds in
just a few seconds. Finally, operating the device well above a temperature of 100 °C
ameliorates the effect of humidity upon its response - a critical factor for many chemical
sensors.
The basic reactions that occur within the porous sintered film can be represented by
the following reactions. First, vacant sites within the nonstoichiometric tin oxide lattice
react with atmospheric oxygen to abstract electrons out of the conduction band of the tin
oxide creating chemisorbed oxygen sites such as O-, O2, and so on.

Next, this reversible reaction is disturbed when the analyte molecule X reacts with the
chemisorbed oxygen species to release electrons and promulgate further reactions:
(8.51)
In a simple physical description, the tin oxide behaves like an n-type semiconductor and,
therefore, there is an increase in the electron carrier density n, and hence in the electrical
conductivity cr, of the material with increased gas concentration where
Aa =
(8.52)
where /zn is the electron mobility.
In fact, changes in the order of magnitude in device conductance that is observed (see
Figure 8.53) cannot be explained by the very small change in carrier concentration and,
therefore, the common model is one in which the electrons modulate a space charge region
(depletion region) that surrounds nanometer-sized grains within the sintered material. It
is then a reduction in the height of the intergranular barriers Vs that increases the electron
hopping mobility and hence the conductance of the tin oxide film (Williams 1987).
This change in device conductance can be approximately related to the gas concentra-
tion C from the chemical rate constants k1 and 2 defined in Equations (8.50) and (8.51).

Table 8.17 lists some tin oxide gas sensors that are commercially available together
with their properties.
The requirement to run this type of gas sensor at a high temperature causes the power
consumption of about 0.8 W of a Taguchi-type device to be a problem for handheld
units. Consequently, there has been considerable effort since the late 1980s toward the
use of silicon planar technology to make micropower gas sensors in volume at low cost
(less than €5). Designs of silicon planar microhotplates started to appear around the
late 1980s when Demarne and Grisel (1988) and later Corcoran et al. (1993) reported
on the first silicon-based tin oxide gas microsensors. There are two basic configurations
of a microhotplate; these are illustrated in Figure 8.54. The first comprises a resistive
heater (e.g. platinum) embedded between layers that make up a solid diaphragm (Gardner
et al. 1995) or a resistive heater (e.g. doped polysilicon) embedded between layers in a
suspended microbridge configuration.

MICROSENSORS
We now provide, via a worked example, the process sequence for a resistive gas
microsensor.
Worked Example E8.2: Silicon-Resistive Gas Sensor Based on a Microhotplate
Objective:
To fabricate a resistive planar gas microsensor from bulk silicon micromachining tech-
niques based on a solid diaphragm microhotplate. The small thin diaphragm (less than
1 urn thick) should result in low power consumption.
Process Flow:
A five-mask process has been used to fabricate a resistive gas microsensor with the
main steps shown in Figure 8.55 (Pike 1996). The initial substrate was a 3", 280 nm
thick, single-sided polished, (100) oriented, SCS wafer. Before processing, the wafers
were given an identity mark with a diamond scribe and then subjected to a standard
multistage cleaning process, which removed any organic contaminants, adsorbed layers,
and particulates. A standard cleaning process was used before each thin film deposition
to ensure adequate adhesion20.
1. An 80 nm dry SiO2 film was thermally grown on the wafer at 1100 °C. Note that the
intrinsic stress in the thermally grown SiO2 films must be negligible at 1100 °C - an
essential requirement for mechanical stability of the membrane structure.
2. A 250 nm thick layer of low-stress SiN21
x was then deposited by LPCVD.
3. The microheaters were defined by patterning a thin platinum film with Mask 1
using a lift-off technique. Specifically, a photoresist was first spin-coated onto the
wafer and exposed to UV light using Mask 1. Before the photoresist was developed,
it was exposed to chlorobenzene to harden the photoresist surface. Hence, during
developing, the photoresist was undercut slightly because of the surface modifi-
cation. This profile ensures that no side coverage occurs during the metallisation
deposition, so that when the photoresist was removed, it did not interfere with
the metallisation that had bonded to the substrate. The photoresist layer acts as a
sacrificial layer, which was removed later with acetone, revealing the mask image
patterned into the metallisation22. To improve metal adhesion to the substrate, it is
common to use a thin adhesion layer of a more reactive metal. Therefore, before
sputtering down 200 nm of Pt, a 10 nm tantalum (Ta) adhesion layer was first
deposited.
4. A standard cleaning process prepared the substrate for a second 250-nm layer of
LPCVD low-stress SiNx, which insulates the microheater electrically from the elec-
trodes deposited in a later stage. Mask 2 was used to open up the contact windows
in the SiNx. This required the plasma etching of the SiNx to reveal the Pt heater
contact pads. The patterned photoresist layer used was then stripped off before
another cleaning stage.
20 See Chapter 4 for details of wafer cleaning.
21 The nitride is slightly silicon-rich and so nonstoichiometric.
22 This is a lift-off process such as that used to make SAW IDT microsensors (Chapter 12).

287
Figure 8.55 
Example of the steps required to fabricate a resistive gas microsensor
5. The next step involved the deposition of the gold (Au) thin film and patterning with
Mask 3 to define the sensing electrode structure. A lift-off technique was again
used; therefore, a 10 nm titanium (Ti) adhesion layer followed by 300 nm Au film
was sputtered over the patterned photoresist. The photoresist was then removed with
acetone to leave the electrodes on the surface.
6. To create the ultrathin membrane structure required an anisotropic KOH back-etch
through the SCS. Most photoresists are inappropriate for defining features any deeper
than 20 urn in KOH etch conditions; therefore, the SiNx and SiO2 on the wafer
underside were patterned with Mask 4 using plasma etching to form a suitable
KOH mask.

288 
MICROSENSORS
7. Before KOH anisotropic etching, the topside protection resist had to be processed.
The wafers were held onto a spinner by a vacuum and a layer of Shipley Microposit
181323 was spin-coated over the wafers. This protecting layer was then photolitho-
graphically patterned with Mask 5 to expose the active diaphragm area and the four
contact pads. The photoresist was hard-baked for 1 hour at 180 °C after developing,
which made it more resistant to chemical attack. Clearly, the resist will not stand
up to attack by organic solvents or high temperatures. This layer has been replaced
recently by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) nitride, which
permits the definition of a precise gas-sensitive area above the sensing electrodes.
Moreover, the nitride passivation layer can withstand the high operating tempera-
tures created by the heater.
8. The final processing stage was a KOH anisotropic bulk back-etch that creates the
diaphragm (membrane) structure and a thermal SiO2 as an etch stop on the topside.
To prevent the wafer topside from being exposed to the etchants, the wafer was
mounted in a suitable holder during etching.
9. The back-etch also opened up V-grooves (not shown) in the wafer that allows the
wafer to be easily snapped up into individual silicon dies. This method is a much
more gentle a method than dicing up with a diamond saw.
10. Finally, the gas-sensitive layer is drop-deposited across the electrodes and sintered24.
Figure 8.56 shows two silicon micromachined resistive gas sensors with embedded plat-
inum resistive microheaters. The first design comprises an array of three microhotplates,
each with two sets of resistive gold-sensing electrodes (referred to here as device no.
SRL 108, Gardner et al. (1995)). The second design (IDC 50) comprises a single cell with
one microhotplate and one set of resistive electrodes. A small drop of doped tin oxide
has been carefully deposited on the surface at Tubingen University (process details are
in Al Khalifa (2000)). Both devices were fabricated at the Institute of Microtechnology
(Switzerland).
The platinum microheater has a resistance RPt that depends linearly on its absolute
temperature T, namely,
= R0[l + aT(T - TQ)] 
(8.54)
where R0 is the resistance of the heater at room temperature T0 and UT is the linear
temperature coefficient of resistance, the values of 190 SI and 1.7 x 10~3/°C25, respec-
tively, were measured for the device SRL108, which is shown in Figure 8.56(a). The
platinum heater not only supplies the power to heat up the diaphragm but also acts as an
accurate linear temperature sensor.
Figure 8.57(a) shows the total electrical power required to heat up the microhotplates
of a microdevice (SRL108) to temperatures of up to 350 °C above ambient (T0 = 22 CC).
A simple quadratic fit to the data is shown.
Heat losses are caused in general by thermal conduction through the membrane, convec-
tion/conduction to air, and radiation. The power loss of a microhotplate PH based on these
23 Shipley 1816 has now replaced 1813.
24 Other methods include sputtering of thin oxide films and sol-gel.
25 The bulk value for platinum is higher at 3.8 x 10-3/°C.

with a, b and c being constants. The actual contributions from each of these three mecha-
nisms has been determined by running a device (SRL108) in a vacuum, and Figure 8.57(b)
shows that the results are a good fit to the terms in Equation (8.51) (Pike and Gardner
1997).
It can be seen that devices operated at about 350 °C lose most of their heat through
convection to air and a negligible amount in radiation. In this case, the DC power
consumption of the microhotplate is typically 120 mW at 300 °C or 60 mW per resis-
tive sensor. The thermal response time of the microhotplate was measured to be 2.8 ms
for a 300 °C change in operating temperature (Pike and Gardner 1997). Both the power
consumption of the device and its thermal time constant will scale down with the size of
the diaphragm; hence, power consumptions and time constants of less than 10 mW and
1 ms, respectively, are quite realizable.
Figure 8.58 shows the characteristic response of an undoped and a doped tin oxide
resistive gas microsensor operated at a constant temperature of 367 °C to ppm pulses of
NO2 in air at 38% relative humidity (RH). The doped devices clearly show a higher
response to NO2 and it should be noted that the resistance here increases in the presence
of the oxidising gas. The resistance falls in the presence of reducing gases such as CO or
hydrogen. The rise time of a tin oxide sensor tends to be faster than its decay time; this
becomes more apparent when detecting larger molecules such as ethanol. The response is
also not well approximated by a first-order process; therefore, an accurate model of the
dynamic response requires a multiexponential model (Llobet 1998).
However, the fast thermal response time of the microhotplate permits the rapid modula-
tion of its operating temperature - this can be used to reduce the average power consump-
tion of the device by a factor of approximately 10 when powering up for only 100 ms

SRL108 or below 1 mW for smaller hot plates. An interesting and alternative approach is
to modulate the heater temperature with a sinusoidal AC drive voltage26 and then relate
the harmonic frequency content of the AC tin dioxide resistance signal to the gas present.
This approach has been successfully demonstrated by researchers (Heilig et al. 1997; Al-
Khalifa et al. 1997); in this approach, the coefficients of a Fourier analysis are learnt in

a simple back-propagation neural network. It is particularly exciting to note that, using
this dynamical approach, a single microsensor can predict the concentration of a binary
mixture of gases from the different rate kinetics.
In the past few years, there has been an enormous increase in the number of research
groups from Germany, Korea, and China reporting on the fabrication of microhotplate-
based resistive gas sensors. These show some general improvements in the device perfor-
mance, such as a lower power consumption, greater robustness, and so on. Much of this
recent interest has stemmed from the fact that Motorola (USA) set up a fabrication facility
to make a low-cost CO gas sensor with Microsens (Switzerland) in the mid-1990s that
was based on a suspended poly silicon microhotplate design (Figure 8.54(b)). The device
was aimed at the automotive market with a nominal price of €1. Since then, the company
has been relocated to Switzerland and become independent. The main competition to
such silicon gas sensors is from the commercial screen-printed thick-film-based planar
devices, such as those sold in medium volume by Capteur Ltd (UK).
A variety of different materials have been studied for use in solid-state resistive gas
sensors. These materials are not only semiconducting oxides (e.g. SnO2, ZnO, GaO, and
TiO2) that tend to operate at high temperatures but also organometallic materials such
as phthalocyanines that operate around 200 °C and organic polymers that operate near
room temperature (Moseley and Tofield 1987; Gardner 1994). However, the successful
application of these other materials in gas sensors has not yet been realised. Instead, some
of these materials - conducting polymers, in particular - are being used as nonspecific
elements within an array to detect vapours and even smells (Gardner and Bartlett 1999).
Details of these devices, or so-called electronic noses, are given in Chapter 15 on Smart
Sensors.

8.6.2 Potentiometric Devices
There is a class of field-effect gas sensors based on metal-insulator semiconductor struc-
tures in which the gate is made from a gas-sensitive catalytic metal (Lundstrom 1981).
There are two basic devices, as illustrated in Figure 8.59, in which the structure is config-
ured as either field-effect transistor or gas-sensitive capacitor.
The most common device is an n -channel metal oxide semiconductor field-effect
transistor (MOSFET) device configured in a common source mode, as shown in
Figure 8.59(b). When the device is in saturation, the drain current I'D is simply related to
the gate voltage VGS by

0.7 V for silicon). Lundstrom discovered that when the gate was made of a thin layer of
palladium, the atmospheric hydrogen would dissociate and diffuse through to the interface,
creating a dipole layer and causing a shift in the threshold voltage. Using a circuit to drive
a constant current through the device with common gate and drain terminals leads to a
characteristic voltage response (equal to the shift in threshold voltage) of this type of
device to hydrogen

where k is a constant and CH is the partial pressure of the hydrogen in air.
The solid palladium gate has subsequently been replaced by an ultrathin discontinuous
metal film so that larger, less diffuse, molecules can reach the oxide surface and be sensed.

This allowed catalytic gate materials (e.g. platinum, palladium, and iridium) to be used
to sense gases such as ammonia, ethanol, hydrogen sulfide, and so on. The devices are
typically operated at temperatures around 180 °C to increase the activity of the catalyst and
rate kinetics. The most recent MOSFET devices use silicon micromachining techniques to
define a silicon microplatform and thermal plug (Briand et al. 2000). Figure 8.60 shows
a schematic cross section of the device and a photograph of the FET device showing
a set of four FET sensors with an integrated heater and temperature sensor. A shift in
threshold voltage of about 220 mW is observed for a 20-ppm pulse of ammonia in air.
The power consumption of the device is greatly reduced to about 100 mW at 200 °C,
and again commercial arrays of these devices are being produced by a Swedish company
(Nordic Sensors) for gas and odour detection.
There has also been some research effort toward the use of polymeric materials as
the gate material to detect organic vapours at room temperature. A similar principle
has been developed by Janata (1992) using suspended gate structures to detect the shift
in work function of nonconducting polymers. But more recently, the metal gate is no
longer suspended, like the catalytic FET device, and is made of a thin porous conducting
polymer film (Hatfield et al. 2000). Figure 8.61 shows the structure (a) and layout (b) of

The main advantages of PolFETs are that they can be operated at ambient temperatures
(and therefore require little power) and that they are compatible with CMOS technology.
However, the polymers do exhibit a significant humidity dependence and so their future
success, as gas (vapour) sensors, will depend on either employing hydrophobic films or
on-chip compensation for the humidity variation.
To date, the greatest commercial success of a polymeric potentiometric device has been
in the field of biosensors (Scheller et al. 1991). The device consists of an enzyme, such
as glucose oxidase, which is then attached to an electrode and senses potentiometrically,
amperometrically, or impedimetrically. Perhaps the most successful device has been a
glucose detector. The device is able to detect the level of glucose in blood by using a

disposable single-shot sensing element - the enzyme is coupled to a conducting polymer
in an electrochemical cell. The sensing strips are fabricated using screen printing, rather
than silicon microtechnology, and sold in their millions by companies such as Medisense
(UK). Other coatings can be used to detect lipids, peptides, and so on, but to date, their
commercial success has been somewhat limited by either the long-term stability of the
electrode or the selectivity of the biological coatings.
Finally, there is considerable need in the automotive industry for gas sensors that
can monitor the engine combustion process either in-line or at-line — this is extremely
demanding and rules out conventional CMOS devices that operate only up to a temperature
of about +125°C. However, there is a field-effect diode made from SiC that can be
operated at more than 700 °C and responds in milliseconds (Svenningstorp et al. 2000,
2001). Figure 8.62 shows the response of a MISiC Schottky diode to the exhaust gases
from a car engine (Savage et al. 2000). This device enables the real-time monitoring of
the combustion process in each cylinder as it fires in turn and could well be used as a
diagnostic sensor.
8.6.3 Others
There are a number of other principles of transduction that can be used to make chemical
microsensors. For example, the most obvious type of sensor to make is a capacitive one
because the device requires little power and fits in well with CMOS technology. Early
work by Gopel on polymeric capacitors had a limited success because of the relatively

Brand 2000) and (b) two electrode geometries to discriminate between polymer dielectric constant
and swelling changes

poor sensitivity and high noise levels. However, more recent research by Baltes (Baltes
and Brand 2000) at ETH (Zurich) has been reported in which polymeric capacitors are
integrated on to a CMOS chip to enhance the signal gain, and, with different electrode
geometries (Figure 8.63(a)), improve the selectivity.
Interestingly, they report on the use of a pair of electrodes, as shown in Figure 8.63(b),
to enhance the selectivity - an approach similar to that proposed by Gardner (1995) with
resistive microsensors, and which is based on the fact that there are two mechanisms
by which the polymers can work. When the analyte dissolves into the nonconducting
polymer, it changes the dielectric constant of the material and hence the capacitance
changes. However, the polymer also swells as it absorbs the analyte, which provides a
second competing mechanism. Now, the capacitor with the narrow electrodes will not
measure the swelling effect as the electric field is contained within the film, whereas the

capacitor with the wide electrodes will measure the entire swelling that is taking place.
Therefore, the selectivity of the capacitive gas microsensor is enhanced.
There is also potential in the development of microcalorimetric gas sensors. For
example, conventional pellistors are made in large quantities to detect the presence of
combustible gases, such as methane in air (Figure 8.64(a)). They work by sensing a
change in temperature of a small catalyst-coated bead held at around 450 °C via a plat-
inum heater or temperature sensing coil. There have been efforts to make a silicon planar
pellistor (Gall 1991) but the demands on the silicon technology are considerable because of
their very high operating temperatures of around 500 °C. However, recent improvements
in microhotplate technology have led to stable operating temperatures of 600 °C, and
combined with novel nanoporous gas-sensitive membranes pioneered by Southampton
University (Lee et al. 2000), Figure 8.64 shows both (b) a schematic cross section of
a silicon micromachined microcalorimeter (micropellistor) and (c) a photograph of the
actual device. The heater can be seen faintly below the solid gold electrode with a

The power consumption of the device, shown in Figure 8.64(d), is about 150 mW at
an operating temperature of 450 °C. The microheater has an active area of 570 u,m
square.
The catalyst-coated bead was formed electrochemically using a lyotropic27 self-
assembling material as a template (Attard et al. 1997). The resulting structure is made
up of a regular array of 5.5-nm pores in palladium and has a very high surface area,
approximately 1000 m2/g (Figure 8.65 (a,b)). Preliminary results of the micropellistor
are shown in Figure 8.65(c). Its response to 2.5 percent methane in air (Lee et al.
2000) suggests that commercial silicon micropellistors may become available in the near
future.
In conclusion, there are a wide variety of different materials and different types of
microsensors reported, which respond to gases and vapours - including those based on
acoustic principles and described in other chapters. Table 8.18 summarises some of the key
characteristics of the different types of gas microsensors and their potential for integration
into a standard process.

8.7 CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this chapter, we have presented an overview of some of the different types of microsen-
sors in the literature, such as mechanical, magnetic, and chemical. Most of these devices
are fabricated using silicon technology with the addition of either bulk or surface micro-
machining techniques. However, there are three other important classes of microsensors,
and these are discussed elsewhere in the book. First, IDT microsensors, based on acoustic
materials, are described in Chapter 13 and offer the attractive possibility of remote wireless
communication. Second, IDT-based MEMS sensors can be found in Chapter 14, which
describes the use of non-silicon-based micromechanical structures with IDTs. Finally,
Chapter 15 explores the expanding field of smart and intelligent devices that will become
commonplace in the next few years.

Introduction to SAW Devices
9.1 INTRODUCTION
Physical and chemical sensors have and will continue to play an ever-increasing role in the
measurement of both physical (pressure, temperature, acceleration, strain etc.) and chem-
ical (ion or gas concentrations, chemical potential, etc.) properties. Sensors are important
for many processes, and it is impossible to imagine a world without their impact on some
part of our daily lives.
Sensors based on surface acoustic waves (SAWs) form an important part of the sensor
family, and in recent years, these have seen diverse applications ranging from gas and
vapour detection to strain measurement (Campbell 1998). A new generation of SAW-based
actuators modeled on microactuators based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)
have also been recently announced (Campbell 1998). The advantages of using SAW-based
devices in microsensors are that SAW devices are amenable to wireless interrogation, and
by the application of a suitable modification in the form of an onboard antenna, they
can be converted into sensors for use in remote and inaccessible locations. As the sensor
frequency increases, its physical size scales down, resulting in smaller devices permitting
a greater variety of applications. Consequently, we have dedicated several chapters in this
book to the topic of SAW devices and their sensing applications.
9.2 SAW DEVICE DEVELOPMENT AND HISTORY
Pierre and Jacques Curie discovered the piezoelectric nature of quartz in 1880, when
they observed that some crystals1 they were studying would electrically polarise when
deformed by an applied force (Smith 1976). For 30 years, this phenomenon remained a
scientific curiosity. In 1910, Voigt published a book on the properties and theory of piezo-
electricity. The first practical applications using piezoelectric devices began during the
First World War of 1914 to 1918 (Grate et al. 1993a). In 1917, motivated by submarine
problems, P.1 Langevin of France and A. M. Nicholson of United States worked indepen-
dently on using piezoelectric devices as echo-detectors for detecting compressional waves
in seawater. Although too late for the war effort, these devices proved useful in shipping
as detectors in depth-sounding equipment (Smith 1976).
Acoustic sensors offer a rugged and relatively inexpensive means for the develop-
ment of wide-ranging sensing applications. A valuable feature of acoustic sensors is their

INTRODUCTION TO SAW DEVICES
direct response to physical and chemical parameters, including surface mass, stress, strain,
liquid density, viscosity, permittivity, and conductivity (Grate et al. 1993a). Furthermore,
the anisotropic nature of piezoelectric crystals allows for various angles of cut, each cut
having different properties. Applications such as a SAW-based microaccelerometer, for
example, utilise a quartz crystal having a stable temperature (ST) cut because the reso-
nance frequency is almost independent of temperature (Bechmann et al. 1962). Again,
depending on the orientation of the crystal cut, various SAW sensors having different
acoustic modes may be constructed, which have a mode ideally suited toward a partic-
ular application. Other advantageous attributes include very low internal loss, uniform
material density, and elastic constants (Bechmann et al. 1962). Owing to these proper-
ties, many different sensors can be designed and optimised to meet the needs of specific
sensing applications, leading to their increasing role as chemical and physical sensors
(Grate et al. 1993a,b). Since the early 1960s, research and development in the acoustic
sensor field has increased significantly and has shown increased diversity.
The principal means of detection of a change of physical property follows from the
transduction mechanism of a SAW device, which involves the conversion of signals
from the physical (acoustic wave) domain to the electrical domain. Small perturbations
affecting the acoustic wave manifest themselves as large-scale changes when converted to
the electromagnetic (EM) domain because of the enormous difference in their velocities
(Varadan and Varadan 1997). This can be understood from the following calculations:
The SAW wavelength A is given by the ratio v/f 0. The velocity v of a SAW wave on a
piezoelectric substrate depends on the material and is typically2 3490 ms–1, whereas the
synchronous frequency f0 is set by the AC voltage applied to the interdigital transducer
(IDT) and is typically 1 GHz. Thus, the SAW wavelength A is 3490/109 or about 3.5 urn.
The EM wavelength Xc is given by the ratio c/fo, where c is the velocity of light, that is,
3 x 108 m/s; in this case, Xc is 0.3 m. The ratio of the two wavelengths is /AC, which takes
a value of 1.1 x 10–5 here. The sensing action of such transducers involves any influences
that will alter the acoustic wave velocity v and, consequently, the associated properties
of the wave, such as frequency and time to travel between the sensor and the detector.
The slower acoustic velocity enables the use of simple, low-cost IC circuitry to transduce
the sensing signals that have a high level of precision as demonstrated in later chapters.
The attributes of an ideal sensor should include the following (d' Amico and Verona
1989):
1. High sensitivity
2. Fast and linear response
3. Fully reversible behavior
4. High reliability
5. Selectivity
6. Compact
7. High signal-to-noise ratio
8. Insensitive to surrounding environmental conditions

9. Easy to calibrate
10. Low cost
11. No moving parts that can suffer from wear mechanisms
However, in practice, sensors are less than ideal, and suffer from problems associated
with cross-sensitivity caused by poor selectivity.
To understand the fundamental sensing mechanism of a SAW-based acoustic sensor
better, a brief description follows (Morgan 1978): The sensing mechanism of a SAW
sensor relies on a change in the acoustic velocity of a bulk (or surface) wave within
(or on) the surface of the piezoelectric substrate. After transduction from acoustic to the
electrical domain, the frequency of the acoustic wave is measured. Another parameter that
can also be measured is the amplitude of the acoustic wave, or to be more precise, the
amplitude of the electrical oscillator frequency. This measurement is usually associated
with a decrease in acoustic wave amplitude, and this reduction is a measure of crystal
damping, thus giving an indication of viscous-damping effects.
In the development of acoustic wave sensors and their corresponding oscillators,
complementary instrumentation or systems must be developed in order to measure both
the dynamic and steady state sensor response. Specialised and expensive instrumenta-
tion, such as network analysers or vector voltmeters, can give a very detailed analysis of
acoustic transducers or their sensor configurations. However, this type of instrumentation
is far too sophisticated for general-purpose routine laboratory use. Moreover, it not only
requires highly qualified personnel for its operation but also is very limited in that only one
acoustic sensor can be monitored at a time. In addition, analysis of the data is extremely
time consuming, thus making it impractical to use such instrumentation for measuring
the signals from a microsensor array. Consequently, the vast majority of research papers
have based measurements of the frequency of acoustic wave sensor oscillators on the use
of frequency counters and chart recorders.
Other important design goals that concern advanced measurement systems are sensor
response and data analysis. In the present system design, this involves the transfer of data
directly to disk file, where postprocessing and analysis is carried out using commercial
software packages, such as MathCAD or Matlab. In the case of data from an oscilloscope,
the data are downloaded, and standard conversion software is invoked to convert the
resulting data from a waveform format to a form that can be used as suitable input for the
software packages mentioned earlier. As experimental data can be saved on disk, this will
contribute toward the ease of documentation. Future directions for the system are aimed
at processing and analysis being completed in real time. These can be achieved by the
inclusion of the necessary software classes into the existing system software program or
through dynamic data linked with other commercial software packages. In addition, system
calibration has to meet the requirements of the specific application. This can be achieved
by making use of the mathematical models of the sensor response. A calibrated system
will aid the user, as both the graphical and numerical display will present data in the
appropriate and more meaningful physical units rather than frequency (Campbell 1998).
Before any attempt is made to initiate a proposed system design for acoustic microsen-
sors, it is mandatory to thoroughly understand the sensing mechanisms and limitations of
acoustic devices for each particular sensing application. Using equivalent electronic circuit
models, a greater understanding of these transducers can be achieved. External factors that
cause changes to the circuit model also have to be considered. Some equivalent circuit

models can be run with commercial SPICE software, which helps in the design of better
acoustic microtransducers.
9.3 THE PIEZOELECTRIC EFFECT
Piezoelectric crystals play a dominant role in the communications and electronics industry
where they are commonly used as filters, precision timers, and for frequency control in
oscillator circuits (Mason 1942). The piezoelectric effect can be demonstrated by applying
either a compressive or tensile stress to the opposite faces of a piezoelectric crystal.
Figure 9.1 shows that when the equal and opposite forces, F1 and F2, (generating tensile
stresses) are applied, the resulting deformation of the crystal lattice produces a separation
of the centres of gravity of positive and negative charges3.
This effect results in electrical charge appearing on the surface of the electrodes.
When the force (tensile or compressive) is removed, the strain within the crystal lattice is
released causing charge (and hence current) to flow, thus reestablishing a zero potential
difference between the electrodes. If a sinusoidal stress alternating between the tensile
and compressive forces is applied to opposite crystal faces, a sinusoidal piezoelectric
voltage will appear across the electrodes. In this case, electrical energy is produced from
mechanical energy (generator action). This process of crystal deformation can be reversed.
In other words, when an external voltage is applied to the electrodes, the crystal lattice
will deform by an amount proportional to the applied voltage. In this case, electrical
energy is transformed into mechanical energy (motor action) (Campbell 1998). Therefore,
it is effectively a piezoelectric microactuator.
There are essentially three important properties of piezoelectric transducers that justify
their use for sensing applications (Morgan 1978):
1. An ideal coupling mechanism between the electric circuit and the mechanical properties
of the crystal, ensuring that the frequency of the mechanical acoustic wave is identically
equal to the electrical frequency, that is, a distortion-free interface having extremely
low dissipation.
2. The anisotropic nature of piezoelectric crystals allows for different angles of cut with
respect to the crystallographic axis, which, therefore, allows the use of crystals with a
range of frequencies.

3. The model of the acoustic wave can be changed, for example, from compressional to
shear, or the angle of propagation can be varied.
9.3.1 Interdigital Transducers in SAW Devices
Acoustic waves propagating along the surface of a piezoelectric material provide a means
of implementing a variety of signal-processing devices at frequencies ranging from several
MHz to a few GHz (Campbell 1998). The IDT provides the cornerstone of SAW tech-
nology. Its function is to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, and vice versa,
for generating and detecting the SAW.
An IDT consists of two metal comb-shaped electrodes placed on a piezoelectric
substrate (Figure 9.2). An electric field created by a voltage V applied to the electrodes
induces dynamic strains in the piezoelectric substrate, which, in turn, launch elastic waves.
These waves contain, among others, the Rayleigh waves that run perpendicular to the
electrodes with velocity vR.
When an AC voltage V(t) [Vo exp(jwt)] is applied across the electrodes, the stress
wave induced by the finger pair travels along the surface of the crystal in both direc-
tions. To ensure constructive interference and in-phase stress, the distance d between two
neighbouring fingers should be equal to half the elastic wavelength A.R whence
d = AR/2
(9.1)
The associated frequency is known as synchronous frequency, f0, and is given by (d' Amico
and Verona 1989)
f0 = VR AR 
(9.2)
At this frequency, the transducer efficiency in converting electrical energy to acoustical,
or vice versa, is maximised. The exact calculation of the piezoelectric field driven by the
IDT is rather elaborate (Smith 1976). For simplicity, the analysis of an IDT is carried out
by means of various numerical models. The frequency response of a single IDT can be
simplified by the delta-function model (Campbell 1998).
The simplest SAW device is the nondispersive delay line depicted in Figure 9.3. One
IDT is connected to an electrical source and the other to a detector. The source IDT sets

9.4 ACOUSTIC WAVES
The propagation of acoustic waves in solids will be described in the next chapter. It is seen
that the type of acoustic wave generated in a piezoelectric material depends mainly on the
substrate material properties, the crystal cut, and the structure of the electrodes used to
transform the electrical energy into mechanical energy. The possibilities of various types
of acoustic devices for sensor applications are explored in this section, which focuses
primarily on Rayleigh and shear horizontal surface acoustic wave (SH-SAW), Love wave
mode, acoustic plate mode (APM), and flexural plate wave (FPW).
9.4.1 Rayleigh Surface Acoustic Waves
SAWs were first described by Lord Rayleigh, and the Rayleigh Wave has by far become
the most widely known and used (Viktorov 1967). The propagation of a Rayleigh SAW is
described in detail in Section 10.5. Ripples in calm water caused by a physical disturbance
can be used as an excellent analogy to describe the Rayleigh wave. The disturbance in
quartz originates from the IDTs and was first described by White and Voltmer (1965). The
radio frequency (RF) signal generates the SAW propagation through selective deformation
of the quartz surface, as illustrated in Figure 9.4.
The elastic Rayleigh wave has both a surface-normal component and a surface-parallel
component with respect to the direction of propagation. The Rayleigh wave has two
particle displacement components in the sagittal plane. Surface particles move in elliptical
paths having a surface-normal and a surface-parallel component. The EM field associated
with the acoustic wave travels in the same direction. The wave velocity is determined by
the substrate material and the crystal cut. The energy of the SAW is confined to a zone
close to the surface and is of a few wavelengths thick (Morgan 1978)4. A SAW delay
line consists of two IDTs on the surface of a piezoelectric substrate - one to launch the
SAW and the other to detect it. If the SAW delay is connected to an RF amplifier in a
closed loop, the system oscillates at a frequency determined by the wave velocity vR and
4 That is why they are called surface acoustic waves rather than bulk acoustic waves.

Example of a SAW device having a feedback amplifier

using a frequency counter or a voltage meter (Figure 9.5).
A SAW can also be generated by a network analyser sweeping across a range of signals
in the region of the oscillation frequency of the SAW. Changes in the physical nature of
the wave due to perturbations in its velocity can be manifested as a phase shift detectable
in the output of the network analyser. The disadvantage of the output of the network
analyser is that the minimum resolution possible in the sensing of a dynamic signal is
limited by the minimum time taken by the network analyser to sweep across a range
of frequencies defined for oscillation. The present common practice is to use real-time
dynamic data-acquisition systems, for example, Labview (National Instruments, USA), in
conjunction with a network analyser response to obtain the dynamic data that may be
useful in measurements involving a change in the dynamic phase of the signal. This has
been demonstrated with the Love wave ice sensor5 in which the oscillator connected to
the device measured the peak frequency of oscillation after and before the perturbation,
whereas the device parameters such as the insertion loss and amplitude-attenuation were
obtained from the network analyser results.
5 This is a sensor that detects the formation of ice on the substrate surface.

INTRODUCTION TO SAW DEVICES
Using a second set of matched IDTs, the electromechanical wave can be received and
converted back into an electrical signal. Therefore, using a transmitting and receiving set
of electrodes connected in a feedback loop of a suitable feedback amplifier, sustainable
oscillation can be achieved (Avramov 1989). The IDT finger spacing d relates to the
frequency of the device (see Section 9.2).
The electrode structures are usually made from a combination of an ultrathin 10–20 nm
layer of chromium (Cr), followed by a thin layer of approximately 150 nm of gold (Au) or
a thin layer of aluminum (Al) of a standard thickness of 150 nm (Atashbar 1999). In the
case of a Cr—Au electrode, the chromium not only forms an ohmic contact with the quartz
but also acts as an adhesion layer for the gold. Gold is used as the final interface to the
environment because of its relatively inert characteristics compared with chromium and
other metals. In the case of the aluminum electrode, the adhesion between aluminum and
quartz is sufficiently high to prevent the need for a chromium layer to link the substrate
to the metallisation layer.
SAW devices typically operate in the range of 30 MHz to 1 GHz on ST-quartz and
various cuts of lithium niobate. There are two ways to perturb the device. One is to
perturb the electrical field above the propagation path length and the other is to perturb
the actual mechanical wave traveling across the propagation path. The latter is followed
in this case. The perturbing agent tends to alter the characteristics of the wave that is
propagated between the two IDTs, leading to a change in the phase or the frequency of
the wave, which may then be measured by suitable application of a measurement device
such as a network analyser or a frequency counter or meter (Figure 9.6).
A change of the phase velocity is related to a change in the oscillation frequency by

where Au is the change in the velocity of the wave and Af is the corresponding
frequency change. vR is the propagation velocity of the Rayleigh wave and f0 is the
design frequency.
The particle displacement components and the quasi-static electrical potential of the
SAW are described in Section 10.4 for both Rayleigh waves and Love waves.
9.4.2 Shear Horizontal Acoustic Waves
The selection of a different crystal cut can yield SH surface waves instead of vertical
Rayleigh waves (Nakamura et al. 1977). The particle displacements of this type of wave
are transverse to the wave propagation direction and parallel to the plane of the surface.
The frequency of operation is determined by the IDT finger-spacing and the SAW velocity
for the particular substrate material (Table 9.1). These crystals have shown considerable
promise in their application as microsensors in liquid media (Kovacs and Venema 1992;
Shiokawa and Moriizumi 1987). In general, the SH-SAW is sensitive to mass-loading,
viscosity, conductivity, and permittivity of the adjacent liquid. The configuration of SH-
APM devices is similar to the Rayleigh SAW devices, but the wafer is thinner, typically
a few acoustic wavelengths. The IDTs generate SH waves that propagate in the bulk at
angles to the surface. These waves reflect between the plate surfaces as they travel in the
plate between the IDTs. The frequency of operation is determined by the thickness of the
plate and the IDT finger-spacing. SH-APM devices are mainly used in liquid-sensing and
offer the advantage of using the back surface of the plate as the sensing active area. In this
manner, the IDTs can be isolated from the liquid media, and so the potential problem of
a chemical attack can be avoided. Applications of these microdevices are directed mainly
toward biosensor implementation (Kondoh et al. 1993). The particle motion is transverse,
relative to the direction of wave propagation. Displacements at the surface are almost
entirely in-plane (Atashbar 1999). Figure 9.7 illustrates the wave propagation through the
material and the reflections at the air and liquid boundaries. It is important that these

interfaces be kept undamaged and to a sufficient grade of polish because irregularities
will introduce additional noise signals owing to multiple and nonsymmetrical reflections
(Shiokawa and Moriizumi 1987).
The sensitive areas of such devices are on both faces. This allows the use of the
nonelectrode face for sensing and isolates the transducers from the sensing media. As the
SH-APM wave does not have any surface-normal wave components on the sensitive area
of either face of the quartz, it will oscillate in the feedback loop with minimal interferences
in both the liquid and gas media (Atashbar 1999; Shiokawa and Moriizumi 1987). This
is important when considering the sensitivity (Q-factor) of resonant oscillators. By the
very nature of the interface-sensitive mode, interface parameter changes can be sensed.
If conditions at these interfaces are changed, a change in the frequency will result. The
increase of mass at the interface still causes the expected shift in the device's resonant
frequency, and variations in the interface properties such as viscosity and density are also
detectable.
9.4.3 Love Surface Acoustic Waves
Love waves may be considered as SAWs that propagate in a waveguide made of a layer
of a given material M2 (Figure 9.8) deposited on a substrate made of another material M1
with different acoustic properties and infinite thickness when compared with the original
layer (Love 1934). These waves are transverse and they bring only shear stresses into
action. The displacement vector of the volume element is perpendicular to the propagation
X-direction and is oriented in the direction of the Z-axis. Because the Love wave is a
surface wave, the propagating energy is located in the M2 layer and in the part of the
substrate that is close to the interface. Its amplitude decreases exponentially with depth
(Ewing et al. 1957). In comparison, SH waves are limited by high noise levels and
diffraction of the acoustic signal into the crystal bulk and background interference from
the reflection off the lower surface. The layer of M2 (usually SiO2) has the effect of
confining and guiding the wave over the top layer of the device and hence circumvents
the disadvantages (usually reduced sensitivity at the interface) associated with a similar
SH device (Gizeli et al. 1992).
Figure 9.9 shows the geometry that supports a Love wave and the polarisation usually
associated with a Love wave device. A necessary condition for the existence of a Love
wave is that the shear acoustic velocity in the layer (v2) must be smaller than the same
in the substrate (v1). This condition is proven in Chapter 10 (Tournois and Lardat 1969).
The larger the difference, the larger the guiding effect (Du et al. 1996).

ACOUSTIC WAVES

SiO2)

Figure 9.9 Wave generation on Love wave mode devices
The basic principle behind the generation of the waves is quite similar to that presented
in the description of an SH-SAW sensor. The only difference would be the fact that the
Love wave mode would be the same SH-SAW mode propagating in a layer that was
deposited on top of the IDTs. This layer helps to propagate and guide the horizontally
polarised waves that were originally excited by the IDTs deposited at the interface between
the guiding layer and the piezoelectric material beneath (Du et al. 1996). The particle
displacements of this wave would be transverse to the wave-propagation direction, that is,
parallel to the plane of the surface-guiding layer. The frequency of operation is determined
by the IDT finger-spacing and the shear wave velocity in the guiding layer. These SAW
devices have shown considerable promise in their application as microsensors in liquid
media (Haueis et al. 1994; Hoummady et al. 1991).
In general, the Love wave is sensitive to the conductivity and permittivity of the
adjacent liquid or solid medium (Kondoh and Shiokawa 1995). The IDTs generate waves

314 
INTRODUCTION TO SAW DEVICES
that are coupled into the guiding layer and then propagate in the waveguide at angles to
the surface. These waves reflect between the waveguide (which is usually deposited from
a material whose density would be lower than that of the material underneath) surfaces
as they travel in the guide above the IDTs. The frequency of operation is determined by
the thickness of the guide and the IDT finger-spacing (Tournois and Lardat 1969). Love
wave devices are mainly used in liquid-sensing and offer the advantage of using the same
surface of the device as the sensing active area. In this manner, the loading is directly
on top of the IDTs, but the IDTs can be isolated from the sensing medium that could,
as stated previously, negatively affect the performance of the device (Du et al. 1996). It
is again important that interfaces (guiding layer, substrate) be kept undamaged and care
taken to see that the deposition process used gives a fairly uniform film at a constant
density over the thickness (Kovacs et al. 1993).
Love wave sensors have been put to diverse applications, ranging from chemical
microsensors for the measurement of the concentration of a selected chemical compound
in a gaseous or liquid environment (Kovacs et al. 1993; Haueis et al. 1994; Gizeli et al.
1995) to the measurement of protein composition of biologic fluids (Kovacs et al. 1993;
Kovacs and Venema 1992; Grate et al. 1993a,b). Polymer (e.g. PMMA) layer-based
Love wave sensors (Du et al. 1996) are used to assess experimentally the surface mass-
sensitivity of the adsorption of certain proteins from chemical compounds. It has also
been shown recently that a properly designed Love wave sensor is very promising for
(bio)chemical sensing in gases and liquids because of its high sensitivity (relative change
of oscillation frequency due to a mass-loading); some of the sensors with the aforemen-
tioned characteristics have already been realised (Kovacs et al. 1993). As is discussed in
the next chapter, the main advantage of shear Love modes applied to chemical-sensing in
liquids derives from the horizontal polarisation, so that they have no elastic interactions
with an ideal liquid. It is also sometimes noticed that viscous liquid loading causes a
small frequency-shift that increases the insertion loss of the device (Du et al. 1996).
9.5 CONCLUDING REMARKS
This chapter should provide the reader with the necessary background to the basic prin-
ciples governing waves and SAW devices7.
Figure 9.10 summarises the different types of waves that can propagate through a
medium. These are waves that travel through the bulk of the material (Figure 9.10 (a)
and (b)). The compressive (P) wave is sometimes called a longitudinal wave and is well
known for the way in which sound travels through air. On the other hand, the S wave is a
transverse bulk wave and looks like a wave traveling down a piece of string. In contrast,
waves can travel along the surface of a media, (Figure 9.10 (c) and (d)). These waves are
named after the people who discovered them. The Rayleigh wave is a transverse wave that
travels along the surface and the classic example is the ripples created on the surface of
water by a boat moving along. The Love wave is again a surface wave, but this time the
waves are SH or vertical. This mode of oscillation is not supported in gases and liquids,
and so produces a poor coupling constant. However, this phenomenon can be used to a
great advantage in sensor applications in which poor coupling to air results in low loss
(high Q-factor) and hence a resonant device with a low power consumption.
7 Some of the material presented here may also be found in Gangadharan (1999).

CONCLUDING REMARKS

Figure 9.10 
Pictorial representation of different waves
From these fundamental properties of waves, it should be noted that for applications
considered here, such as ice-detection, there are a variety of possible options. Because
ice-detection primarily involves sensing the presence of a liquid (e.g. water), it is obvious
that Rayleigh wave modes and flexural plate (S) modes cannot be used because of their
attenuative characteristics. Therefore, it is imperative that only those wave modes are used
whose longitudinal component is small or negligible compared with its surface-parallel

device for the higher sensitivity toward any perturbation at the liquid interface.

Surface Acoustic Waves in Solids
10.1 INTRODUCTION
Acoustics is the study of sound or the time-varying deformations, or vibrations, in a gas,
liquid, or solid.
Some nonconducting crystalline materials become electrically polarised when they are
strained. A basic explanation is that the atoms in the crystal lattice are displaced when it is
placed under an external load. This microscopic displacement produces electrical dipoles
within the crystal and, in some materials, these dipole moments combine to give an average
macroscopic moment or electrical polarisation. This phenomenon is approximately linear
and is known as the direct piezoelectric (PE) effect (Auld 1973a). The direct PE effect
is always accompanied by the inverse PE effect in which the same material will become
strained when it is placed in an external electric field.
A basic understanding of the generation and propagation of acoustic waves (sound) in
PE media is needed to understand the theory of surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors.
Unfortunately, most textbooks on acoustic wave propagation contain advanced mathe-
matics (Auld 1973a) and that makes it harder to comprehend. Therefore, in this chapter,
we set out the basic underlying principles that describe the general problem of acoustic
wave propagation in solids and derive the basic equations required to describe the prop-
agation of SAWs.
The different ways of representing acoustic wave propagation are outlined in Sec-
tions 10.2 and 10.3. The concepts behind stress and strain over an elastic continuum
are discussed in Section 10.4, along with the general equations and concepts of the
piezoelectric effect. These equations together with the quasi-static approximation of the
electromagnetic field are solved in Section 10.5 in order to derive the generalised expres-
sions for acoustic wave propagation in a PE solid. The boundary conditions that restrict the
propagation of acoustic waves to a semi-infinite solid are included, and the general solu-
tion for a SAW is presented. An overview of the displacement modes in Love, Rayleigh,
and SH-SAW waves are finally presented in Section 10.5. Consequently, this chapter is
only intended to serve as an introduction to the displacement modes of Love, Rayleigh,
and SH waves.
The components of displacements have been shown only for an isotropic elastic solid.
The equations for the complex reciprocity and the assumptions used to derive the pertur-
bation theory are elaborated in Appendix I.
More advanced readers may wish to omit this chapter or refer to specialised text-
books published elsewhere (Love 1934; Ewing et al. 1957; Viktorov 1967; Auld 1973a,b;

Slobodnik 1976). This chapter on the basic understanding of wave theory, together with
the next chapter on measurement theory, should provide all readers with the neces-
sary background to understand the application of interdigital transducer (IDT) microsen-
sors and microelectromechanical system (MEMS) devices presented later in Chapters 13
and 14.
10.2 ACOUSTIC WAVE PROPAGATION
The most general type of acoustic wave is the plane wave that propagates in an infinite
homogeneous medium. As briefly summarised at the end of Chapter 9 for those readers
omitting that chapter, there are two types of plane waves, longitudinal and shear waves,
depending on the polarisation and direction of propagation of the vibrating atoms within
the medium (Auld 1973a). Figure 10.1 shows the particle displacement profiles for these
two types of plane waves1. For longitudinal waves, the particles vibrate in the propaga-
tion direction (y-direction in Figure 10.1 (a)), whereas for shear waves, they vibrate in a
plane normal to the direction of propagation, that is, the x- and z-directions as seen in
Figure 10.1(b) and (c).
When boundary restrictions are placed on the propagation medium, it is no longer an
infinite medium, and the nature of the waves changes. Different types of acoustic waves
may be supported within a bounded medium, as the equations given below demonstrate.
Surface Acoustic Waves (SAWs) are of great interest here; in these waves, the traveling

the Love wave mode, which is important for one class of IDT microsensor.

REPRESENTATION
Before a more detailed analysis of the propagation of uniform plane waves in piezoelectric
materials in the following sections, a pictorial representation of the concept of shear wave
propagation is presented. Figure 10.2 illustrates shear wave propagation in an arbitrary
cubic crystal medium. An acoustic wave can be described in terms of both its propagation
and polarisation directions. With reference to the X, Y, Z (x, y, z) coordinate system,
propagating SAWs are associated with a corresponding polarisation, as illustrated in the
figure.
10.4 INTRODUCTION TO ACOUSTICS
10.4.1 Particle Displacement and Strain
As stated earlier, acoustics is the study of the time-varying deformations or vibrations
within a given material medium. In a solid, an acoustic wave is the result of a deformation
of the material. The deformation occurs when atoms within the material move from their
equilibrium positions, resulting in internal restoring forces that return the material back
to equilibrium (Auld 1973a). If we assume that the deformation is time-variant, then

322
SURFACE ACOUSTIC WAVES IN SOLIDS
Figure 10.3 Equilibrium and deformed states of particles in a solid body
these restoring forces together with the inertia of the particles result in the net effect
of propagating wave motion, where each atom oscillates about its equilibrium point.
Generally, the material is described as being elastic and the associated waves are called
elastic or acoustic waves. Figure 10.3 shows the equilibrium and deformed states of
particles in an arbitrary solid body - the equilibrium state is shown by the solid dots and
the deformed state is shown by the circles.
Each particle is assigned an equilibrium vector x and a corresponding displaced position
vector y (x, t), which is time-variant and is a function of x. These continuous position
vectors can now be related to find the displacement of the particle at x (the equilibrium
state) through the expression
u(x, t) =y(x, t)— x 
(10.1)
Hence, the particle vector-displacement field u(x,t) is a continuous variable that
describes the vibrational motion of all particles within a medium.
The deformation or strain of the material occurs only when particles of a medium are
displaced relative to each other. When particles of a certain body maintain their relative
positions, as is the case for rigid translations and rotations2, there is no deformation of the
material. However, as a measure of material deformation, we refer back to Figure 10.3
and extend the analysis to include two particles, A and B, that lie on the position vector x
and x + dx, respectively. The relationship that describes the deformation of the particles

between these two points after a force has been applied may be written as
(x,f) 
= 2Sij(x, t)dxi dxj 
(10.3)

with the subscripts of i, j, and k being x, y, or z.
For rigid materials, the deformation gradient expressed in Equation (10.4) must be
kept small to avoid permanent damage to the structure; hence, the last term in the above
expression is assumed to be negligible, and so the expression for the strain-displacement
tensor is rewritten as

10.4.2 Stress
When a body vibrates acoustically, elastic restoring forces, or stresses, develop between
neighbouring particles. For a body that is freely vibrating, these forces are the only ones
present. However, if the vibration is caused by the influence of external forces, two types
of excitation forces (body and surface forces) must be considered. Body forces affect the
particles in the interior of the body directly, whereas surface forces are applied to material
boundaries to generate acoustic vibration. In the latter case, the applied excitation does not
directly influence the particles within the body but it is rather transmitted to them through
elastic restoring forces, or stresses, acting between neighbouring particles. Stresses within
a vibrating medium are defined by taking the material particles to be volume elements,
with reference to some orthogonal coordinate system (Auld 1973a). In order to obtain a
clearer understanding of stress, we make the use of the following simple example. Let us
assume a small surface area AA on an arbitrary solid body with a unit normal n, which is
subjected to a surface force AF with uniform components AFi. The surface AA may be
expressed as a function of its surface components AAj and the unit normal components
nj as follows:
A j = n j A A 
(10.6)
with the subscript j taking a value of 1, 2, or 3.
The stress tensor, Tij, is then related to the surface force and the surface area through
AFi
with the subscripts i and j taking a value of 1, 2, or 3.
3 A tensor is a matrix in which the elements are vectors.

324
SURFACE ACOUSTIC WAVES IN SOLIDS
Moreover, if we consider the stress tensor Tijto be time-dependent and acting upon
a unit cube (assumed free body), the stress analysis may be extended to deduce the
dynamical equations of motion through the sum of the acting forces. Thus,
= p-dt2
(10.8)
where p is the mass density, Fi are the forces acting on the body per unit mass, and ui,
represents the components of particle displacements along the i-direction.
10.4.3 The Piezoelectric Effect
Within a solid medium, the mechanical forces are described by the components of the
stress field Tij, whereas the mechanical deformations are described by the components
of the strain field Sij. For small static deformations of nonpiezoelectric elastic solids,
the mechanical stress and strain fields are related according to Hooke's Law (Slobodnik
1976):
Tij=cijk,Sk, 
(10.9)
where Tij are the mechanical stress second-rank tensor components (units of N/m2), Skl
are the strain second-rank tensor components (dimensionless), and cikl is the elastic
stiffness constant (N/m2) represented by a fourth-rank tensor. Taking into account the
symmetry of the tensors, the previous equation can be reduced to a matrix equation using
a single suffix. Thus, the tensor components of T, S, and c are reduced according to the
following scheme of replacement (Auld 1973a; Slobodnik 1976):
(32) = (23)
(22) 
2;
(13) = (31)
(33) 
3 
5; 
(21) =
(10.10)
Therefore, the elastic stiffness constant can be reduced to a 6 x 6 matrix. Depending on
the crystal symmetry, these 36 constants can be reduced to a maximum of 21 independent
constants. For example, quartz and lithium niobate, which present trigonal symmetry, have
their number of independent constants reduced to just 6 (Auld 1973b):

(10.11)
In piezoelectric materials, the relation given by Equation (10.8) no longer holds true.
Coupling between the electrical and mechanical parameters gives rise to mechanical
deformation and vice versa upon the application of an electric field. The mechanical
stress relationship is thus extended to
– ekijEk
(10.12)

ACOUSTIC WAVE PROPAGATION 
325
where ekij is the piezoelectric constant in units of C/m2, Ek is the kth component of the
electric field, and cE
ijkl is measured either under a zero or a constant electric field.
In nonpiezoelectric materials, the electrical displacement D is related to the electric
field applied by
D=sre0E 
(10.13)
where er is the relative permittivity, formerly called the dielectric constant, and e0 is the
permittivity of vacuum, now known as the electric constant. For piezoelectric materials,
the electrical displacement is extended to:
Di = eiklSkl+eS
ikEk 
(10.14)
where eS
ik is measured at constant or zero strain.
Equations (10.12) and (10.14) are often referred to as piezoelectric constitutive
equations. In matrix notation, Equations (10.12) and (10.14) can be written as (Auld
1973b):
[T] = [c][S]–[eT]E
D = [e][S ] + 
[e]E 
(10.15)
where, [e] is a 3 x 6 matrix with its elements depending on the symmetry of the piezo-
electric crystal and [eT] is the transpose of the matrix [e]. For quartz having a trigonal
crystal classification, the [e] matrices are

The difference between poled and naturally piezoelectric materials is that in the former,
the presence of a large number of grain boundaries and its anisotropic nature would lead
to a loss of acoustic signal fidelity at high frequencies. This is one of the reasons SAW
devices are, usually, only fabricated out of single-crystal piezoelectrics.
10.5 ACOUSTIC WAVE PROPAGATION
10.5.1 Uniform Plane Waves in a Piezoelectric Solid:
Quasi-Static Approximation
For the numerical calculations of acoustic wave propagation, the starting point is the
equation of motion in a piezoelectric material (Auld 1973a)
pui = Tij.j 
i, j = 1,2, 3 
(10.17)
where, p is the mass density, and ui is the particle displacement.
In tensor notation, the two dots over a symbol denotes a2/at2 and a subscript i
preceded by a comma denotes a/axi. The piezoelectric constitutive equations in (10.15)
are rewritten in tensor notation:

SURFACE ACOUSTIC WAVES IN SOLIDS
+ eE
k k
(10.18)
(10.19)
with i, j, k, and / taking the values of 1, 2, or 3.
The strain-mechanical displacement relation is:
The absence of intrinsic charge in the materials is assumed; therefore,
Dj.j=0
(10.20)
(10.21)
The quasi-static approximation is valid because the wavelength of the elastic waves is
much smaller than that of the electromagnetic waves, and the magnetic effects generated
by the electric field can be neglected (Auld 1973a):
Ek = -<f>.k 
(10.22)
where </> is the electric potential associated with the acoustic wave.
The problem of acoustic wave propagation is fully described in Equations (10.17) to
(10.22). These equations can be reduced through substitution to
*i — cjklul.jk
0 = ejki
- efkbjk
(10.23)
(10.24)
The geometry for the problem of SAW wave propagation is shown in Figure 10.4. It has
a traction-free surface (x3 = 0) separating an infinitely deep solid from the free space.
The traction-free boundary conditions are (Viktorov 1967; Varadan and Varadan 1999)
r,-3 =0 
for x3 = 0
(10.25)
where i takes a value of 1, 2, or 3.
The solutions of the coupled wave Equations (10.23) and (10.24) must satisfy the
mechanical boundary conditions of Equation (10.25). The solutions of interest here are
Figure 10.4 
Coordinate system for SAW waves showing the propagation vector

ACOUSTIC WAVE PROPAGATION 
327
SAWs that propagate parallel to the surface with a phase velocity uR and whose displace-
ment and potential amplitudes decay with distance away from the surface (X3, > 0). The
direction of propagation can be taken as the x1-axis, and the (x1, x3) plane can be defined
as the sagittal plane.
Note that the propagation geometry axes depicted in Figure 10.4 do not always corre-
spond to the axes in which the material property tensors are expressed. There are transfor-
mation formulae that can be applied to the property tensors so that all the above equations
hold for the new axes. The elastic constants (Q/M), the piezoelectric constants (e,-^/), and
the dielectric constants (e,-7) can be substituted by c'ijkl, e'ijkl, s'^. The primed parameters
refer to a rotated coordinate system through the Euler transformation matrix (Auld 1973a).
The solutions for Equations (10.23) and (10.24) have the form of running waves: the
surface wave solution is in the form of a linear combination of partial waves of the form
(Auld 1973a)
ui = Ai exp(—kx3) exp -jco \t-~\\ 
(10.26)
(p — B exp(— kxj) exp —jco I t -- - I 
and x > 0 
(10.27)
L 
V 
VR / J
Here, co is the angular frequency of the electrical signal, k is the wave number, given by
27T/A,, and A. is the wavelength, given by 2nvR/co.
When the three particle displacement components exist, the solutions are called gener-
alised Rayleigh waves. The crystal symmetry and additional boundary conditions (elec-
trical and mechanical) impose further constraints on the partial wave solutions. If the
sagittal plane is a plane-of-mirror symmetry of the crystal, x\ is a pure-mode axis for
the surface wave, which involves only the potential and the sagittal-plane components of
displacement.
Because the Rayleigh wave has no variation in the X2 -direction, the displacement
vectors have no component in the x2 -direction and the solution is given as follows
(Varadan and Varadan 1999):
Assume displacements u\ and u3 to be of the form A exp(— bx3) exp[jk(x 1 — ct)] and
B exp(— bxT,} exp[jk(x 1 — ct)], and u2 equal to zero, where the elastic half-space that
exists for x3 is less than or equal to zero, B and A are unknown amplitudes, k is the
wave number for propagation along the boundary (x1-axis) and c is the phase velocity
of the wave. Physical consideration requires that b can, in general, be complex with a
positive real part. Substitution of the assumed displacement into Navier— Stokes equation
gives (Varadan and Varadan 1999)
V - T - / t ) 
= 0 
(10.28)
and use of the generalised Hooke's law for an isotropic elastic solid yields two homoge-
neous equations in A and B. For a nontrivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient
matrix vanishes, giving two roots for b in terms of the longitudinal and transverse veloc-
ities. Substitution of the roots of b obtained, as shown earlier, into the homogeneous
equations in A and B gives the amplitude ratios. Thus, we obtain the general displacement
solution (Equation 10.28) (Varadan and Varadan 1999).

These displacements are as shown in Figure 10.5. It is seen that as u$ is in phase
quadrature with MI, the motion of each particle is an ellipse. Because of the change
in sign in u1 at a depth of about 0.2 wavelengths, the ellipse is described in different
directions above and below this point. At the surface, the motion is retrograde, whereas
lower down it is prograde.

where the Lames' constants G is given by Em/2(l + v) and A is given by vEm/[(l + v)
(1 — 2v)] with v being Poisson's ratio and Em being Young's modulus.
10.5.2 Shear Horizontal or Acoustic Plate Modes
Acoustic plate modes (APW) or shear horizontal (SH) waves in a half-space utilise single-
crystal quartz substrates. These act as an acoustic waveguide by confining the acoustic
energy between the upper and lower surfaces of the plate. Such a mechanism is used to
confine waves traveling between an input and output IDT. SH modes may be thought
of as those waves with a superposition of SH plane waves, which are multiply reflected
at some angle between the upper and lower surfaces of the quartz plate. These upper
and lower faces impose a transverse resonance condition, which results in each SH mode
having the displacement maxima at the surfaces, with sinusoidal variation between the
surfaces.
The solution is simply a plane shear wave propagating parallel to the surface, with its
amplitude independent of X3, within the material. The phase velocity is equal to v,. The
particle displacement associated with the nth order SH plate mode (propagating in the

ACOUSTIC WAVE PROPAGATION 
329
x\-direction) has only an x2-component and is given by the following equation (see Auld
1973a,b):
u2= wo cos — I x2 + - J exp[j (cat - pnx\)] 
(10.30)
where b is the plate thickness, u2 is the particle displacement at the surface, n is the
transverse modal index (0,1,2,3...), and t is time. The exponential term in the equation
describes the propagation of the displacement profile down the length of the waveguide
(along the x1 -direction) with angular frequency w and wave number Bn given by
(10.31)
where VQ is the unperturbed propagation velocity of the lowest-order mode.
The cross-sectional displacement profiles (in the x2 — x3 plane) for the four lowest-
order isotropic SH plate modes are shown in Figure 10.6. It is also noticed that each
mode has equal displacements on both sides of the acoustic plate mode (APM) sensor,
allowing the use of either side for sensing measurements.

10.5.3 Love Modes
Ewing and co-workers (1957) were one of the first to point out from long-period seismo-
graphs that in addition to measuring the characteristic horizontal motion during the main
disturbance of the earthquake, the seismographs also showed a large amount of transverse
components. This early established fact in seismology was explained in 1911 by Love,
and he easily showed that there could be no SH surface wave on the free surface of a
homogeneous elastic half-space (Love 1934). Hence, this simple model could not explain
the measurements. Love, however, showed subsequently that the waves involved were
SH waves, confined to a superficial layer of an elastic half-space and the layer having
a different set of properties from the rest of the half-space. Following Love's treatment
here, Love waves can be considered as SAWs that propagate along a waveguide made
of a layer of a given material M2 (e.g. glass) deposited on a substrate made of another
material M1, (e.g. stable temperature (ST)-cut quartz), with different acoustic properties
and, effectively, an infinite thickness when compared with the original layer.
These waves are transverse and they bring only shear stresses into action. The displace-
ment vector of the volume element is perpendicular to the propagation direction O-x1 and
is oriented in the direction of the O-x2 axis. Because the Love wave is a surface wave, the
propagating energy is located in the layer and in that part of the substrate that is close to
the interface. Its amplitude decreases exponentially with depth. However, it should also
be noted that materials should have appropriate properties to propagate and carry a Love
wave, as shall be discussed in the section hereby.
10.5.3.1 Existence conditions of Love waves dispersion equation
The case in which the two propagating media are isotropic is examined first. The coor-
dinate origin is chosen on the interface; the O-x1 axis is oriented in the direction of
propagation and the jcs-axis is oriented vertically upwards (see Figure 10.7). The plane

x3 = h represents the free boundary of the layer. Let us assume that displacements are
oriented along the x2-axis and are independent of x1. Then, let us consider a monochro-
matic progressive wave of frequency a> propagating along the x1-axis.
Using the symbols p1, G1, u1 and P2, G2, and u2 for the density, the shear modulus
and the displacement vector of the volume elements for the substrate and the layer,
respectively; VT\ and k\ (equal to CO/VTI), the phase velocity of the transverse waves
and the wave number in medium M1; and vj2 and k2 (<v/VT2), the same quantities in
medium A/2, let us finally call c and k (equal to cafe) the phase velocity and the wave
number of the Love wave, whose existence is postulated (see Figure 10.8).
The solutions of the propagation's Equation (10.29) can now be written in the following
way (Varadan and Varadan 1999):
jkx\
u2x2 = (B1 + B2) exp (jcot - jkx 1 + a2x3) 
(10.32)
where
- c2/4i 
<*2 = -k\ - c2/v2
T2 
(10.33)
It can be verified that the above equation satisfies the Naviers Equation (10.28) in the
two media and further that u3 ->• 0 as x3 -> — oo (Varadan and Varadan 1999). uT1 and
VT2 are the transverse wave velocities, as defined earlier by Equation (10.28).
The three constants A, B1, and B2 are determined by the boundary conditions that
require not only that the tangential stresses 023 cancel out in the plane X3, = h but also
that they are continuous as well as the displacements u1x2 and u2x2 in the plane Jt3 = 0
(Ewing et al. 1957; Slobodnik 1976).

332 
SURFACE ACOUSTIC WAVES IN SOLIDS
The first of these conditions leads to
B1 exp (—a2h) - B2 exp (+a2h) = 0 
(10.34)
and the two other conditions lead to A = B\ + B2 and
a1 G1A = a2 G 2(B 1 — B2) 
(10.35)
This system of three linear equations has a solution different from zero (Tournois and
Lardat 1969) if
G1a1
tan(a2 h = — — - 
(10.36)
The roots of this equation have a real value when k1 < k < k2, that is, when c2 < c < c\.
Therefore, a necessary condition of existence of Love waves is that the propagation
velocity of transverse waves in the layer must be smaller than the propagation velocity
of the transverse waves in the substrate.
It is easy to deduce from Equation (10.36) that there are infinite modes owing to the
periodicity of the tangential function; when c tends to c1, tan(a2h) tends toward the value
of nn (with n being 0, 1, 2, . . .), and for the first mode, the wavelength becomes infinite
compared with the thickness.
The particle displacements occurring during the propagation of Love waves are easily
obtained from Equation (10.35).

,,ni-n
u2x2 = A -

exp[y(wf - kx\)] 
(10.37)

where A is a propagation constant determined by the excitation signal.
The equations in ( 10.37) show that the displacement amplitude u1x2 decreases exponen-
tially in the substrate. It also shows that the different modes u2x2 correspond to 0, 1,2,...
nodal planes in the layer. Figure 10.9(a) gives the shape of particle displacements in the
layer and the substrate for the first three modes.
The displacement amplitude also depends on the frequency, and Figure 10.9(b) shows
its variation for the first mode. Therefore, it could be noticed that the energy is entirely
located in the substrate for very low frequencies and that the Love wave propagates
at a velocity c\ as if the layer does not exist. Its thickness is, in fact, negligible when
compared with the wavelength. Conversely, the acoustic energy is concentrated in the layer
for very high frequencies, and the phase velocity of the Love waves tends toward c2, the
wavelength being very small with respect to the thickness of the layer. Between these
two limits, the energy progressively transfers from the substrate to the layer, whereas the
phase velocity varies between c\ and c2 (Tournois and Lardat 1969).
Having obtained the nature of the displacement and the similarity between the SH-SAW
waves and Love modes, we can derive an expression for the change in the velocity and
frequency shift for a Love wave device using perturbation theory. The derivation for
the frequency shift and the corresponding change in velocity have been presented in
Appendix I using the basic equations derived in this chapter.

10.5.3.2 Discussions of the characteristics of the Love waveguiding
materials
It may be noticed from earlier discussions, that the two most important parts of a Love
wave sensor are the overlayer material and the piezoelectric substrate. Our discussion now
focuses on the salient points of the waveguide, particularly with respect to the properties
of the material.
Love waves propagate near the surface of a suitable substrate material when the
surface is overlaid by a thin film with appropriate properties for a guiding layer. An
essential condition for the propagation of a Love wave is that the shear velocity in
the film is less than that in the substrate. Sensitivity to mass-loading is enhanced by
the low density of the film as well as a large difference between the shear velocities.
For a particular guiding-layer material, an optimum layer thickness exists, which results
in maximum acoustic energy density close to the surface and maximum sensitivity to
mass-loading.
Love wave devices incorporating guiding layers of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)
and sputtered SiO2 overlaid on single-crystal quartz have been successfully demon-
strated (Du et al. 1996). PMMA has a density of about 1.18 kg/m3 and has a shear
acoustic velocity of 1100 m/s (Kovacs et al. 1993; Jakoby and Vellekoop 1998; Du et al.
1996), whereas sputtered silicon dioxide has a density of about 2.3 kg/m3 and a shear

acoustic velocity4 of 2850 m/s (Auld 1973a). Gizeli and coworkers (1995) utilised PMMA
layers of thickness up to 5.6 |im spun onto Y-cut quartz with IDTs of periodicity of
45 um at the quartz-PMMA interface. A network analyser was used to monitor the
phase of the wave. The maximum thickness reported by Gizeli and coworkers (1995)
(~1.6 um) is considerably less than the estimated optimum thickness of approximately
3 urn of PMMA (Shiokawa and Moriizumi 1988). Kovacs and co-workers (1993) have
utilised sputtered silicon dioxide on ST-cut quartz. Acoustic losses in SiO2 are low when
compared with polymers such as PMMA. SiO2 is more resistant to most chemicals and,
when sputtered under optimal conditions, has excellent wear resistance. Because of tech-
nical reasons, it was reported that the maximum thickness of SiO2 that was utilised was
5.46 urn - considerably less than the optimum value of approximately 6 um (for devices
of wavelength 40 um).
Another criterion for the choice of a suitable waveguiding material would be the
absorption coefficient. It essentially depends on the material structure, which can be poly-
crystalline, crystalline, or amorphous. In polycrystalline materials, when the wavelength
becomes comparable to the grain size because of the phenomenon of Rayleigh scattering
(Rayleigh 1924), the energy absorption increases proportionally to frequency to the fourth
power (Tournois and Lardat 1969). At higher frequencies, it is obvious that the materials
employed will have to be without loss-inducing grain boundaries, that is, either single-
crystalline or amorphous. Amorphous bodies, such as certain glasses and fused silica, will
allow propagation with a limited absorption at frequencies much higher than 100 MHz.
10.6 CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this chapter, the basic equations that describe the propagation of different types of
waves in an elastic solid have been presented and expressions for the displacement of
particles therein5 have also been obtained. The emphasis has been directed toward the
fundamental differences between the Rayleigh and SH modes and SH of vibration. The SH
and Love wave modes have been examined from the point of view of waveguide structure,
that is, the nature of the overlayer and the substrate. This mathematical discourse should
help readers to understand the nature and application of SAW microsensors and MEMS
devices in other chapters.

IDT Microsensor Parameter
Measurement
11.1 INTRODUCTION TO IDT SAW SENSOR
INSTRUMENTATION
There is no specific design procedure for interdigital transducer (IDT) microsensors based
on surface acoustic wave (SAW) delay lines. Although substantial work has been done
on delay line designs for filtering and signal-processing applications, the requirements
for SAW-based devices are essentially different from those for commercial non-SAW
oscillator-based sensors (Avramov 1989). The SAW device should not only have the
appropriate frequency-transfer characteristics, but its physical dimensions should also
allow for miniaturisation and remote-sensing of a variety of physical and chemical media.
This chapter deals with the instrumentation and measurement aspects of a typical
IDT-SAW sensor during the course of its operation and so covers the different measure-
ment techniques available and makes a comparison between them.
Specifically, Section 11.3 describes the basic principles of a 'network analyser,' whereas
subsequent sections describe its use to measure the amplitude (Section 11.4), phase
(Section 11.5), and frequency (Section 11.6) of signals. Finally, a brief overview of a
network analyser system is given with particular emphasis on the topics of forward-
matching, reverse-matching, and transmission (see Gangadharan 1999).
11.2 ACOUSTIC WAVE SENSOR INSTRUMENTATION
11.2.1 Introduction
Acoustic wave sensors convert the physical or chemical property of interest into a signal
suitable for measurement. Ultimately, the measured sensor data must be processed so that
they can be presented to the user in both a sensible and meaningful way. The role of
system instrumentation is to implement this task.
Ever since the early work by Sauerbrey and King (Avramov 1989), and many of
those that have followed, the vast majority of acoustic-sensing applications has involved
acoustic sensors being used as the active frequency-control elements in oscillator circuits.
The oscillator output frequency is then used as the (desired) measured parameter. This is

338 
IDT MICROSENSOR PARAMETER MEASUREMENT
not so surprising, as acoustic sensors are digital by nature1 with a good dynamic range
and linearity. Therefore, state-of-the-art system instrumentation can readily exploit the
digital acoustic microsensor. One of the main advantages digital instrumentation has
over the earlier system technologies is that there is no requirement to perform any
frequency to voltage (for output) conversion - a process that often causes a consider-
able loss of resolution. In the state-of-the-art systems, frequency to digital conversion
takes place without loss2 through the use of simple electronic counters. However, other
measuring system instrumentation must be considered and compared in terms of its
viability, functionality, and suitability. Having accepted that either frequency or multiple-
period measurements (timing signal) is the most appropriate parameter to measure, consid-
eration will now be given to past and current forms of such instrumentation (Campbell
1998).
There are three electronic configurations that may be used to measure the response of
a SAW (two-port) microsensor:
1. Where the microsensor is connected to a network analyser (or vector voltmeter) and
scanned by a narrow radio frequency (RF) band on either side of its fundamental
resonant frequency (see Section 11.3).
2. Where the microsensor is used as the passive element, being driven from a fixed RF
source (amplitude or phase measurements) (see Sections 11.4 and 11.5).
3. Where the microsensor is used as the active feedback-determining element, controlling
the frequency of an oscillator circuit (frequency measurement) (see Section 11.6).
11.3 NETWORK ANALYSER AND VECTOR
VOLTMETER
Primarily, the network analyser and vector voltmeters are used by radio and electronic
engineers for network analysis and design. Although SAW resonators have equivalent
electric circuit analogues, network analysis is usually performed on the basis of the idea
of electrically matching resonators with then- corresponding oscillator circuits. This is
particularly true for the SAW-sensor oscillator design. From either the network analysers
or the vector voltmeters, the characteristic admittance Y or impedance Z can be measured.
These measurements will produce a locus of the admittance or impedance parameters over
a set of discrete frequency data points. The admittance (or impedance) can be expressed in
either rectangular (real and imaginary) or polar (magnitude and phase) coordinates. Anal-
ysis from such instruments will deliver the most information possible about an acoustic
transducer or the sensor that is under load, detailing shifts in resonant frequency and any
changes in the quality factor Q (Subramanian 1998; Piscotty 1998).
Despite the advantages that either the network analyser (or vector voltmeter) has in
delivering very detailed information on a number of important parameters, both these
instruments are impractical as general-purpose laboratory tools. The reasons for this are
that the resonator setup is:
1 Digital in the sense that they are active frequency elements in oscillator circuits where frequency counters
are used to measure the output frequency.
2 High resolutions are achieved through long counting periods.

ANALOGUE (AMPLITUDE) MEASURING SYSTEM 
339
1. Far too time-consuming
2. Restricted, as only one acoustic sensor can be measured at a time
3. Allows only steady state measurements; no dynamic response measurements are
possible
4. Very expensive to operate, in terms of both the instrument price and the need for highly
qualified personnel
5. Unable to offer remote-sensing
6. Too cumbersome and not portable
Nevertheless, there are instances in which it is useful to use a network analyser to under-
stand an IDT-SAW problem. For example, most of the work described here on the device
referred to previously as an ice microsensor has been more of a characterisation study,
so it is sensible to employ a network analyser in order to measure the relevant phase
difference parameters3. This is despite the fact that the network analyser carries with it
all the relevant disadvantages just listed.
Before choosing the configuration to employ, the following question should always be
asked:
'What is the most practical and appropriate form of instrumentation or system to be used
for measuring and analyzing acoustic-based microsensors?'
Wohltjen and Dessy (1979) answered the question by describing three general methods
for measuring the response of a SAW microsensor - amplitude, phase, or frequency
measurements. The following three sections provide typical examples of such measuring
systems (Wohltjen and Dessy 1979) based on these methods.
11.4 ANALOGUE (AMPLITUDE) MEASURING SYSTEM

producing a negative direct current (DC) level from the acoustic device and a positive
DC level from the attenuator arm. A potentiometer is used to set the signal to zero for
the unperturbed acoustic resonator. A subsequent low-pass filter restricts the bandwidth
of the resultant analogue output signal.
11.5 PHASE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM
In a phase measurement system, the initial stages are the same as in an amplitude measure-
ment system, but a double-balanced mixer (Figure 11.2) replaces the diode detectors and
low-pass filter. The two RF signals from the acoustic and attenuator branches are fed
into the mixer and a potential difference appears at the mixer intermediate frequency (IF)
port, which corresponds to the phase difference. The output voltage is then applied to an
instrument amplifier through a simple resistance capacitance (RC) filter. Under normal
operation, the RF attenuator is adjusted to match the RF output level from the acoustic
device. Wohltjen and Dessy (1979) reported that changes in the amplitude of the acoustic
wave of several percent did not introduce any significant error; however, substantial
attenuation occurs, which makes it difficult to interpret measurements.
Unlike the vector voltmeter and network analyser, the amplitude and phase measure-
ment systems are portable. They also have the advantage of being driven from an external
fixed RF source, where the amplitude of the source can be adjusted to compensate for
heavy damping conditions. However, a number of reasons make amplitude (or phase
measurements) a poor choice for monitoring acoustic sensor response. The most signif-
icant is the much-reduced dynamic range, typically between 10000:1 and 1000:1. It is
well known that the use of amplitude signals by instruments, such as a voltmeter or
chart recorder, is neither as precise nor as accurate as measurements based on frequency
or the time domain. The dynamic range for frequency or time measurements is on the
order of 10 million to 1. Furthermore, the use of a potentiometer to preadjust for a zero
baseline unnecessarily complicates the amplitude system, as it will most likely require
readjustment from time to time because of the drift. Grate and coworkers (1993) describe
several mechanisms that will contribute to shifts in the unperturbed resonance frequency,
namely, environmental contaminants, for example, oxidation, changes in the piezoelectric
material, mounting stresses, thermal gradients, hysteresis, and deterioration through aging.
Both systems require the user to adjust the RF step attenuator in order to match the RF
level from the acoustic device. In our opinion, good engineering design should at best
eliminate the need for preset adjustments or, at worst, limit the requirement, in order to
allow system instrumentation to be used by nonexperts.

FREQUENCY MEASUREMENT SYSTEM 
341
11.6 FREQUENCY MEASUREMENT SYSTEM
Figure 11.3 shows a typical configuration in which a SAW resonator is used as the feed-
back element in an oscillator circuit. Oscillation will be sustained, provided the gain of
the RF amplifiers exceeds the insertion loss of the resonator. Unfortunately, measuring the
acoustic oscillator frequency alone provides no information regarding signal amplitude
because it is a measure of mechanical-loading (damping effects) and gives an estimate of
the quality factor Q. Furthermore, under heavy loading conditions, oscillation may cease.
To partially overcome this limitation, some researchers have used oscillator circuits using
automatic gain control (AGC) techniques. Measurement of the AGC feedback permits
an estimate of the oscillator frequency amplitude (damping) levels to be made. The sole
purpose of AGC is to maintain oscillation under heavy loading by maintaining the magni-
tude of acoustic wave within the crystal substrate constant (Smith and Gerard 1971). AGC,
however, will not restore any loss of circuit quality factor.
The authors believe that the acoustic resonator oscillator design should be optimised so
as to match the nominal environmental quiescent feedback characteristics of the acoustic
sensor. By adhering to this design philosophy, the simple frequency-measurement system
should be more than adequate to meet most sensing application needs (Grate et al. 1993).
To sum up, the measurement of frequency provides the simplest and most cost-effective
solution for the processing of acoustic resonator responses because of the following
reasons:
1. It has the greatest dynamic range 107:1.
2. It is less complex and costly compared with the amplitude or the phase measurement
systems.
3. No manual preset adjustments required, making operation easier for the user.
4. There are fewer component parts and, therefore, potential sources of noise are reduced.
In the majority of applications, a SAW microsensor serves as a feedback element that
controls the oscillator frequency. Oscillators constructed from transistor transistor logic
(TTL), logic inverter chips, and transistors have been reported (Shiokawa and Moriizumi
1988).
Figure 11.4 is a representation of such an oscillator circuit, in which the electronic
circuit not only delivers the necessary driving signal to sustain oscillation but also provides
the output port in which the resonant frequency can be monitored.

SAW device oscillator circuit
Non-AGC oscillator circuits, such as the Brukenstein and Shay (see Smith el al.
(1969)), are a viable alternative. These circuits feature high output voltage and will
drive under high viscous load conditions. Advantages of their design include fewer circuit
components making less-possible noise and drift sources and are, therefore a much simpler
and compact alternative.
11.7 ACOUSTIC WAVE SENSOR OUTPUT FREQUENCY
TRANSLATION
Typically, the unperturbed resonant frequency of acoustic resonators used for sensing
applications ranges between 30 and 300 MHz for SAW devices. As sensors, typical
sensing effects constitute relatively small frequency deviations from their unperturbed
resonance, from several kHz to a few MHz. However, measuring such frequencies in the
very high frequency (VHF) and ultrahigh frequency (UHF) bands requires very expensive
RF instrumentation. Therefore, moves from the RF spectrum down to the audio spectrum
has proved a popular alternative. This is achieved by a mixing process that involves
heterodyning the reference and sensing oscillator frequencies. A low-pass filter ensures
that only the difference frequency is passed on. Figure 11.5 shows the schematic diagram
of a typical mixing circuit.
The circuit consists of a dual-oscillator system in which the frequency of each oscillator
is controlled by reference and sample resonators.
The difference frequency f is the output from the low-pass filter
= (fref — f sample)
(11–1)
Digital mixing circuits offer a viable alternative to classical analogue circuit techniques
(Smith et al. 1969). The digital technique has advantages over analogue methods in that
it removes the need for both the low-pass filter and the RF mixing transformer. This
substantially lowers cost and size. However, irrespective of whether analogue or digital
mixing is used, there will always exist some finite difference frequency between the

sensor and reference oscillators, producing some degree of baseline offset. Although the
mixing circuit technique will significantly reduce the effects of common mode interfer-
ence, there is always the possibility that interference could compound and, therefore,
increase measurement errors.
Another option is to use an environmentally isolated precision reference oscillator.
As the frequency from this protected reference oscillator will remain fixed, the mixed
frequencies from the reference and indicator sensor oscillator will not contain frequency
contributions from any interfering source (Crabb and Lewis 1973).
11.8 MEASUREMENT SETUP
The vector network analyser and associated calibration techniques make it possible to
accurately measure the transmission parameters of the devices under test. The measure-
ment schematic is shown in Figure 11.6. The network analyser consists of a synthesized
sweeper (10 MHz-40 GHz), test setup (45 MHz-40 GHz), HP8510B network analyser,
and a display processor (Subramanian 1998; Piscotty 1998). The sweeper provides the
stimulus and the test setup provides signal separation. The display panel of the HP8510B
is used to define and conduct various measurements. The system bus is instrumental in
controlling various other instruments. The device to be tested is connected between the
test Port 1 and Port 2. The point at which the device is connected to the test setup is
called the reference plane. All measurements are made with respect to this reference
plane. The measurements are expressed in terms of the scattering parameters referred to
as S parameters (Subramanian 1998). These describe the signal flow within the network.
S parameters are defined as ratios and are represented by Sinn/out, where the subscripts in
and out refer to the input and output signal, respectively. Figure 11.7 shows the energy
flow in a two-port network. It can be shown that (see HP 8510B Network Analyser
Manual 1987)
b1 = a1S11 = a2S12 and b2 = a1S21 = a2S22 
(11–2)
where S11 is b\la\ and 521 is b2la1 when a2 is zero; 512 is b\la2 and 522 is b2/a2 when
a\ is zero. S\\ and 521 (5i2 and 522) are the reflection and transmission coefficients for
Port 1(2), respectively.

11.9 CALIBRATION
Calibration of any measurement is essential in order to ensure the accuracy of the system.
The errors that exist in systems may be random or systematic. Systemic errors are the
most significant source of measurement uncertainty. These errors are repeatable and can
be measured by the network analyser. Correction terms can then be computed from these
measurements. This process is known as calibration. Random errors are not repeatable
and are caused by variations due to noise, temperature, and other environmental factors
that surround the measurement system.

REFERENCES 
345
A series of known standards are connected to the system during calibration. The
systemic effects are determined as the difference between the measurand and the known
response of the standards. These errors can be mathematically related by solving the
signal-flow graph (Subramanian 1998). The frequency response is the vector sum of all
test setup variations in magnitude and phase and the frequency. This is inclusive of all
signal-separation devices, such as test setup and cabling.
The mathematical process of removing errors is called error correction. Ideally, using
perfectly known standards, these errors should be completely characterised. The measure-
ment system is calibrated using the full two-port calibration method. The four standards
that are commonly used are shielded open circuit, short circuit, load, and through. This
method provides full correction of directivity, source match, reflection and transmission-
signal path, frequency response, load match, and isolation for S11, S12, S21, and S22. The
procedure involves taking a reflection, transmission, and isolation measurement.
For the reflection measurement (S 1 1, S22), the open, short, and load standards are
connected to each port in turn and the frequency response is measured. These six measure-
ments result in the calculation of the reflection error coefficients for both ports.
For the transmission measurement, the two ports are connected and the following
measurements are carried out forward through transmission (S21 -frequency response),
forward through match (S21-load), reverse through transmission (S12-frequency response),
and reverse through match (S12-load). The transmission error coefficients are computed
from these four measurements.
Loads are connected to the two ports and the S12 and S21 noise floor level is
measured. From these measurements, the forward and reverse-isolation error coefficients
are computed. The calibration is saved in the memory of the network analyser and the
correction is turned on to correct systemic errors that may occur.
By making these measurements, it is possible to identify the critical acoustic parameters
and thus design the optimal IDT-SAW microsensor. The SAW microsensor may now be
fabricated, and the process is provided in the following chapter.

12.1 INTRODUCTION
Surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices are fabricated using processes that have been
primarily developed for integrated circuit (1C) technology in the microelectronics industry.
In this chapter, we describe all the steps required to fabricate an interdigital trans-
ducer (IDT) SAW microsensor from a stable temperature (ST) cut quartz wafer. A basic
overview of this process is given in Figure 12.1. Specifically, there are two processes that
are commonly used to define the IDTs: etching and lift-off 
(Hatzakis et al. 1980). Both
methods1 are suitable for the fabrication of IDT-SAW delay-line sensors, but the ultimate
choice of either the etching or the lift-off process mainly depends on the minimum feature
size (resolution and accuracy) of the patterned structure required. Although the etching
procedure is relatively easy to realise and acceptable resolution is achievable, it is more
susceptible to electrical shorts between features than that of the lift-off process. This is a
major concern, especially for minimum feature sizes approaching 1–2 um, where the influ-
ence of contaminants, such as large dust particles, becomes more significant (Vellekoop
1994). However, for larger minimum feature sizes, of 5 um or greater, it is recognised
that the etching process is acceptable and comparable in terms of device fabrication yield
and quality to that of the lift-off process.
Section 12.2 provides full details of the steps required to make an IDT microsensor
through either an etching process or a lift-off technique. The process given here is meant
to serve as an example, and variations in the precise choice of materials and equipment
used will vary from laboratory to laboratory.
Next, the steps required to make a Rayleigh-SAW microsensor from the IDTs are
shown, together with a waveguiding layer of SiO2 (Section 12.3) to fabricate a Love
wave microsensor.
Finally, in Section 12.4, we provide tables that summarise the etching and lift-off
processes and present their relative merits.

of electron-beam (E-beam) lithography. The SAW designs are first created using a

computer-aided design (CAD) system (e.g. L-Edit from Tanner Tools Inc.) and then
the electronic design files are exported in a standard format (e.g. GDS II) that offers
compatibility with the E-beam writer. The IDT structures are thus written on a positive
resist material that coats the mask plate on which a thin chromium layer has already
been deposited. The resist is developed and the chrome is etched away to leave the
desired IDT structures. It is common practice to make an inverse mask, or negative, from
the master positive mask plates using a quicker and more inexpensive ultraviolet (UV)
optical lithographic process. It is these copies that are then used in the silicon run and,
if damaged, can be replaced immediately. Figure 12.2 shows a typical IDT design that
would be written onto the positive and negative mask plates.
12.2.2 Wafer Preparation
Effective cleaning of the quartz wafers is a vital procedure, which is an essential require-
ment for the successful fabrication of IDT microsensors. In order to obtain good adhesion
and a uniform coating of the metallic film used to make the IDTs, a thorough cleaning of

the wafer surface is essential. The cleaning of the wafers should be performed in a fume
cupboard (in a clean room) to allow the safe and fast removal of any possible harmful
fumes produced during the cleaning process (Campbell 1998; Atashbar 1999).
The wafers are initially cleaned of any surface contaminants, such as dust, grease,
or any other soluble organic particles, by immersion in trichloroethylene2 at 60 °C for
10 minutes, followed by an acetone bath at 60 °C for 10 minutes. The wafers are then
rinsed with methanol and finally with deionised water. It is best to avoid the use of
nitrogen gas for drying the sample during the aforementioned procedure so as to minimise
further surface contaminants. Instead, a slow evaporation in a protected fume cupboard
is employed. Further cleaning is then undertaken for the removal of the more obstinate
contaminants. The wafers are immersed in a mixture of three parts of deionised water
(3H2O), one part ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), and one part of 30 percent unsta-
bilised hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at 75 °C for 10 minutes. Caution is required because
the mixture is harmful, and it is recommended that the hydrogen peroxide is added last
so as to minimise any reaction side effects. Next, the wafers are placed in a solution of
industrial grade detergent and subjected to ultrasonic agitation at 60 °C for ten minutes.
Following a rinse in deionised water, the wafers are placed in a circulating deionised
water bath for 30 minutes. The wafers are then dried using compressed filtered nitrogen
and stored in an appropriate container and environment.
12.2.3 Metallisation
A metal layer now needs to be deposited, from which IDT structures are to be formed. In
general, aluminum is evaporated using, for example, a Kurt Lesker™ E-beam evaporator.
Aluminum is employed because it is commonly used in IC foundries and exhibits chemical
resistance to many different liquids3.
Typically, a 100 to 150 nm layer of aluminum is deposited on the clean surface of a
quartz wafer. For example, the beam voltage of an E-beam evaporator is set to 6 keV
during the deposition of 150 nm of aluminum, the pre-evaporation pressure is set at
10-6 torr, and the beam current is set to almost 100 mA. This gives an evaporation rate
of 0.2 nm/s. It is to be noted that aluminum could have also been evaporated onto the
' Caution needs to be exercised since trichloroethylene fumes are toxic.

device using thermal evaporation instead of using the E-beam technique. The E-beam
technique, however, allows more control over the deposition rate, and the films tend to
be more uniform and to possess fewer stacking faults and dislocations.
E-beam evaporation of aluminum is, indeed, compatible with both the etching and the
lift-off processes used later on.
12.2.4 Photolithography
The photolithography process is conducted in a clean room environment at a constant
temperature of, typically, 25 °C ± 1 °C and at a relative humidity of 40 ± 5 percent.
The IDT structures need to be oriented correctly with respect to the quartz wafer in
order to generate the required Rayleigh (or Love) waves. Figure 12.3 shows the correct
orientation of the wafer and the SAW-IDTs4.
12.2.4.1 Etching process
The etching process begins with the initial cleaning of the metallised wafers, followed by
the deposition of a positive photoresist. The wafers are first rinsed in a bath of acetone and
then in isopropanol to remove any possible loose surface contaminants that could have
appeared during storage since the initial wafer-cleaning procedure. Next, the wafer is
thoroughly rinsed in a deionised water bath for 5 minutes, followed by an oven bake
at 75 °C for 20 minutes. This removes any moisture from the surface of the wafer.
Using a Headway Research Inc.® spinner, hexamethyl disilazane (HMDS) is spun on
the wafer at 3000 rpm for 60 seconds to improve the adhesion of the resist to the wafers.
After allowing the HMDS thin film to sit for 2 minutes, AZ-1512® positive photoresist
(Hoechst) is then spun at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds. A photoresist layer, approximately
1.2 n,m thick, is formed. The wafer is then baked in an oven at 90 °C for 30 minutes to

remove any excess solvents from the photoresist. Then, it is cooled to room temperature
for approximately 15 minutes before exposing it to UV light in the mask aligner.
A contact mask aligner (Karl Suss MRK-3) is used to align the positive chrome mask
plate with the quartz that is wafer-coated with the photoresist. A UV light exposure of
6 seconds is subsequently required. The exposed wafer is then developed in a mixture of
(ratio 1:4) AZ–450® developer (Hoechst) and deionised water for 40 seconds. Great care
should be taken at this stage because under or overdeveloping the photoresist layer will
degrade the fabrication success. It is strongly recommended that an immersion style is
adopted, so that the wafer is slowly agitated during the developing process at 10 second
intervals, followed by a deionised water rinse and a close inspection using a microscope.
This will provide for greater control in the important developing stage of fabrication. A
'soft' post bake is then performed at 75 °C for 10 minutes, which assists in the hardening
and formation of sharp features of the photoresist. The wafer is then allowed to cool to
room temperature for approximately 15 minutes. At this stage, the IDT pattern should
have been successfully transferred to the wafer; if not, the photoresist can be stripped off
in acetone and the entire procedure repeated before the etching of the wafer.
Chemical wet-etching of the unwanted aluminum is then performed. The aluminum
layer is first etched in a solution of a commercial etchant and deionised water (3.25 g of
etchant in 50 ml of deionised water) at room temperature for approximately 60 seconds.
The etching time is extremely critical because undercutting of the structure walls may
occur if prolonged times are employed. It is strongly recommended that etching is
performed at 10 second intervals, followed by a deionised water rinse and close inspection
with a microscope.
The temperatures of the etchant solutions, together with the thickness of the metal
layers, are important factors that have a significant influence on the etching times. It is
recommended that the etching procedure is inspected for assurance before the processing
of valuable quartz wafers.
Once the IDT design has been successfully transferred to the metallised wafer via the
etching process, the wafer is ready for dicing (Campbell 1996, 1998). The dicing process
is described briefly in Section 12.2.5.
12.2.4.2 Lift-off process
The lift-off process begins with an initial cleaning of the wafers, followed by the deposition
of a positive photoresist. A similar cleaning procedure to that used for the etching process
is used to remove any possible loose surface contaminants that may have appeared during
storage since the initial wafer-cleaning procedure. Similarly, HMDS is spun on to the
wafer using, for example, a Headway Research Inc.® spinner at 3000 rpm for 60 seconds
to improve the adhesion of the resist to the wafer. After allowing the HMDS thin film
to sit for 2 minutes, AZ-1512® positive photoresist (Hoechst) is then spun at 3000 rpm
for 30 seconds. A photoresist layer of approximately 1.2 um is formed. The wafers are
then baked in an oven at 75 °C for 30 minutes to remove any excess solvents from the
photoresist. The wafers are cooled to room temperature for approximately 15 minutes
before UV light exposure.
After aligning the negative IDT chrome mask plate with the photoresist-coated wafer
having a similar orientation to that used in the etching process, the wafer is exposed to

352 
IDT MICROSENSOR FABRICATION
UV light for 6 seconds. To improve the lift-off capability, the wafer is then immersed in
a chlorobenzene bath at room temperature for 3 to 3.5 minutes. It is important to note
that this time varies depending on the intensity of the UV exposure lamp; typically, for
an intensity of 21 W/cm2, the characteristic time in chlorobenzene ranges from about 220
to 280 seconds. This is an extremely critical step, and the procedure should be validated
before it is applied to the set of SAW wafers.
Chlorobenzene modifies the surface of the photoresist by developing a characteristic
'lip' in the developed pattern. This creates a discontinuity at the edges of the patterned
photoresist when a metal is evaporated on the surface of the wafer; thus, unwanted metal
is subsequently removed more easily. The wafer is then baked in an oven at 75 °C for
30 minutes to remove any excess solvents from the photoresist and allowed to cool to
room temperature for approximately 15 minutes. The wafer is then developed in a mixture
(ratio 1:4) of AZ-450® developer (Hoechst) and deionised water for 40 seconds.
Again, great care should be taken at this stage, as under or overdeveloping the photore-
sist layer will degrade the fabrication success. As in the etching process, an immersion
method is strongly recommended, whereby the wafer is slowly agitated during the devel-
oping process at 10 second intervals, followed by a deionised water rinse and then
close inspection with a microscope. It is important to prevent damage to the photoresist-
patterned structures at this stage, so extremely gentle agitation is required in the immersion
step, and the use of compressed filtered nitrogen for drying the wafer should be avoided.
Close inspection of the wafer surface using an optical microscope is then performed to
examine the transferred SAW-IDT pattern. The edges of the photoresist patterns should
be well defined and sharp to facilitate the lift-off process. Again, if found unacceptable,
the photoresist can be removed using acetone and the entire procedure can be repeated
before the metallisation of the wafer.
After the metallisation of the photoresist-patterned wafer using the metal evaporation
technique (Section 12.2.4), the photoresist is removed by immersing the wafers in an
acetone bath at room temperature for 30 minutes. Ultrasonic agitation may be used to
assist in the removal process but caution is advised as damage to small patterned structures
(feature sizes <2 nm) may occur.
Once the IDT designs have been successfully transferred to the wafers via the lift-off
process, the wafers are then ready for dicing (Section 12.2.5).
A summary of the photolithography process for both the etching and lift-off procedures
is shown in Figure 12.4.
12.2.5 Wafer Dicing
The wafers are finally cut into small, individual chips using, for example, a Deckel™ wire
saw, together with a diamond impregnated wire and slurry. The slurry is made from a
mixture of silicon, glycerol, and deionised water (3:5:1) and has a particle size of 25 um.
Before cutting the wafer, a thick layer of AZ-4562® positive photoresist (Hoechst) is
spun at 2000 rpm for 30 seconds, following the deposition of a thin HMDS layer spun on
to improve the photoresist adherence on the wafer. The wafer is then baked in an oven at
75 °C for 30 minutes and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The resulting thick
layer protects the delicately patterned IDT structures during the debris cutting.

12.3 DEPOSITION OF WAVEGUIDE LAYER
12.3.1 Introduction
Love wave sensors require the deposition of a guiding layer made from an acoustic
material that has a shear wave velocity less than that of the quartz wafer. Described next
are the process conditions and steps that should be followed to deposit SiO2 as a guiding
layer on top of a quartz wafer.
Steps that occur during a typical chemical deposition process include (Campbell 1996)
the following:
1. The transport of precursors from the chamber inlet to the proximity of the wafer
2. Reaction of these gases to form a range of daughter molecules
3. Transport of these reactants to the surface of the wafer
4. Surface reaction to release the SiO2
5. Desorption of the gaseous by-products
6. Transport of the by-products away from the surface of the wafer
7. Transport of the by-products away from the reactor

354 
IDT MICROSENSOR FABRICATION
12.3.2 TMS PECVD Process and Conditions
One of the necessary conditions for the deposition of SiO2 is that the temperature of
deposition should be as low as possible. This is desirable because higher temperatures
can adversely affect the poling characteristics of quartz (in spite of the fact that quartz
is a naturally piezoelectric material) and because the melting point of the metallisation
layer (aluminum is 650 °C) should not be exceeded.
We should therefore choose SiO2 that is either sputtered or deposited by plasma-
enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) from silane gas. The sputtering process
provides better step-coverage than evaporation and far less radiation damage than E-
beam evaporation (Campbell 1996). A simple sputtering system consists of a parallel-plate
plasma reactor in a vacuum chamber and the target material (SiO2) placed on the electrode
such that it receives the maximum ion flux. An inert gas (at a pressure of 0.1 torr) is usually
used to supply the chamber with high-energy ions that strike the target at high velocities
and dislodge the SiO2 molecules, which deposit conformal to the wafer (the SAW-IDT
device). The only disadvantage in this process is that on account of the physical nature
of the process, sputtering could also bombard and damage the delicate IDT fingers on the
surface of the quartz. Sputtering can also introduce a variety of contaminants from the
substrate holder because of the physical nature of the process. Hence, sputtering is not
the ideal means of depositing SiO2, despite the fact that the process can be carried out
under conditions of low temperature.
An alternative approach is to use chemical vapour deposition (CVD). A simple CVD
process is shown in Figure 12.5. The reactor consists of a tube with a rectangular cross
section, and the walls of the tube are maintained at a temperature Tw. A single wafer rests
on a heated susceptor in the centre of the tube.
This susceptor is maintained at a temperature Ts (where Ts Tw). The obvious choice
is to use oxidised silane gas (SiH4) (also referred to as tetraethoxysilane TEOS) to form
SiO2 in the presence of an oxidising agent, such as O2, and an inert carrier gas, such as
H2 (to improve the uniformity of deposition). Excessive homogeneous reactions occurring
spontaneously in the gas above the wafer will result in the deposition of large Si particles
in the gas phase, and their subsequent deposition on the wafer will cause poor surface
morphology and inconsistent film properties.

Some of the other problems associated with PECVD (TEOS) are that (7) quality
plasma-enhanced chemical vapour-deposited tetraethoxysilane (PETEOS) SiO2 films are
difficult to achieve at temperatures below 250 °C (Alaonso et al. 1992; Itani and Fukuyama
1997) and (2) TEOS has a low vapour pressure of approximately 2 mTorr (25 °C and
1 atm), which necessitates the heating of all delivery lines and chamber surfaces to
prevent TEOS condensation and prevents gas metering with conventional mass-flow
controllers, thus rendering the resulting process prohibitively expensive (Ballantine et al.
1997). Conventional mass-flow controllers, on the other hand, easily meter silane gas,
but great care must be used because silane is a toxic and pyrophoric gas and constitutes
an explosion hazard at high SiFU concentrations. These limitations add to the cost and
complexity of TEOS and silane-based silicon deposition equipment. To achieve a low
temperature, good quality oxide, and for the circumvention of the safety issues associ-
ated with silane-based oxides and the manufacturing complexities inherent with TEOS,
an alternative precursor needs to be employed.
Potential organo-silicon precursors are compiled and their critical physical and chemical
properties are tabulated for comparison with the properties of silane and TEOS. Of all
the precursors listed in Table 12.1, tetramethylsilane (TMS) can be chosen as the best
precursor for the current low-temperature application for several reasons.
TMS is known to be nontoxic and nonpyrophoric, and its high vapour pressure
(580 mTorr) allows for the use of conventional mass-flow controllers at room temperature.

IDT MICROSENSOR FABRICATION
Also, each parent TMS molecule (Si(CH3)4) contains half as much carbon and three-
fifths as much hydrogen as a TEOS molecule (Si(OC2H5)4), and it is hypothesised
that carbon and hydrogen-free films will be obtainable at lower temperatures from this
precursor. Additionally, the lower molecular weight of TMS might allow for higher surface
mobility than TEOS at any given temperature, thereby resulting in better-quality films at
temperatures lower than those obtainable by PETEOS (~250 °C). Finally, it is thought that
PECVD TMS oxide (PETMS-Ox) deposition conditions could mimic very closely those
conditions found to produce high-quality PETEOS and silane oxides in the semiconductor
industry (Campbell 1996; Ghandi 1994). Such deposition is carried out using a cluster
tool that is specifically fabricated for this process, and the four-chamber showerhead
Vactronics PDS-5000 S cluster tool PECVD reactor (Figure 12.6) is used.
The deposition procedures and conditions involve units 3 and 4 as follows: initially,
in the deposition chambers, TMS, 02, and He gas lines are evacuated of residual gas
and then a sample is placed in a load-lock chamber (unit 3), which is evacuated from
atmosphere to a low pressure (typically 10—5-10—6 torr). This preinsertion vacuum time
is held at 30 minutes. The SAW-IDT wafer is then placed on the preheated sample stage
(unit 4) in the deposition chamber, which is maintained at 10—6 to 10—7 torr, by the
robotic loading mechanism. A period of 1 hour is allotted for the sample to come to
temperature, after which 02 and He gases are input via the gas-dispersion showerhead
and a period of 5 minutes is allotted for the flows to stabilise. A plasma is struck with
the same pressure, RF power, and gas flow rates. This 10-minute preclean plasma purge
serves three purposes:
1. It removes any residual carbonaceous matter left on the SAW device
2. It helps to form a stable interface oxide
3. It provides a high flow, stable plasma into which a miniscule flow of TMS can be
injected

At the end of this preclean, the plasma remains and TMS vapour is introduced. It is
metered using a conventional 10 cubic centimeter per second (cc/s) mass-flow controller
(MFC) to the desired volumetric flow rate. The oxide deposition begins at this point and
is continued for a predetermined time to achieve an oxide film of the desired thickness.
Following the deposition, the TMS gas is turned off, but the O2-He plasma is kept on

for postdeposition cleaning. Once the 15 minute postdeposition cleaning is completed,
the plasma is extinguished, the gases are turned off, and the chamber is evacuated for
3 minutes. Finally, a robotic transporter can shuttle the SAW-IDT wafers to the load-lock
chamber (unit 3), where they are subsequently removed.
12.4 CONCLUDING REMARKS
This chapter has described in detail two process runs that can be followed to fabricate a
Rayleigh wave IDT microsensor or a Love wave IDT microsensor (Gangadharan 1999).
The main steps for the etching process are given in Table 12.2 and for the lift-off
process in Table 12.3. These tables provide the reader with a list of the key steps of the
two processes described in Section 12.2.4 earlier.
A summary of the main advantages and disadvantages of the etching and lift-off
processes is given in Table 12.4. They are relevant to the fabrication of SAW-IDT
microsensors and are taken from a number of sources (Campbell 1996, 1998; Atashbar
1999).
The next chapter describes the use of SAW-IDT devices in a number of different
sensing applications.

IDT Microsensors
13.1 INTRODUCTION
Surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices possess several properties such as high reliability,
crystal stability, good reproducibility, and relatively small size that make them suitable
for many sensing applications. They can be used to sense many different properties, for
example, strain, stress, force, pressure, temperature, gas concentration, electric voltage,
and so forth. Readers are referred to a recent article by Hoummady et al. (1997) for a
review of their applications.
One attractive feature of some types of SAW sensor is that they can be read remotely.
The operating frequency of a SAW device typically ranges from 10 MHz to a few GHz,
which corresponds to the operating frequency range of radio and radar communication
systems, respectively. Thus, when an interdigital transducer (IDT) sensor is directly
connected to an antenna, the electromagnetic waves received by wireless transmission
can excite SAW in the piezoelectric material. The fundamentals of both SAW devices
and acoustic waves in solids were considered in Chapters 9 and 10, and it was evident
that passive, wireless (or remotely operable) SAW devices can be made. The latter is an
attractive proposition when low-power sensors are needed and are even more attractive
for use in remote, inaccessible locations, for example, when buried in concrete or in the
ground. Wireless SAW-based microsensors are described in detail in Section 13.3.
The sensing mechanism of SAW- IDT microsensors is based on a change in the prop-
erties of the SAW (e.g. amplitude, phase, frequency, or velocity) when the measurand
changes. Basic descriptions of the acoustic parameters that can be used in a generalised
measurement system have been given in Chapter 11.
In this chapter, we present a number of different applications of SAW microsensors
together with the equations that govern their behaviour. For example, in chemical sensors,
the SAW couple into a thin chemically sensitive coating and its properties perturb the
nature of the waves. Several different properties of the film coatings can affect the acoustic
waves, namely, mass, density, conductivity, electrical permittivity, strain, and viscoelas-
ticity. In general, the change in acoustic velocity ua can be related by the total differential
theorem to the change in any property or properties. The following equation applies for
changes in mass, electrical, mechanical, and environmental parameters (Hoummady et al.
1997).

IDT MICROSENSORS
Because the change in acoustic velocity of a SAW microsensor is a combination of these
different parameters, care must be taken in the choice of IDT design and signal processing
techniques so that only changes in the desired parameter, such as mass, are measured and
not the cross-interfering signals from, for example, mechanical strain or environmental
temperature. The coupled-mode theory of SAW devices helps us to understand the nature
of these types of microsensors.
13.2 SAW DEVICE MODELING VIA COUPLED-MODE
THEORY
The use of coupled-mode theory on SAW devices for different geometric designs and
choice of piezoelectric material is clearly described by Pierce (1954) and Campbell (1998).
The benefit of this approach is that a SAW device can be represented by a set of transfer
matrices corresponding to its basic elements.
There are generally three elements of a SAW device: IDT, spacing, and reflector. These
can be described by the transfer matrices of T, D, and G, respectively. T matrix is a 3 x 3
matrix, whereas D and G are 2 x 2 matrices. The T matrix describes the IDT input and
output of SAWs as well as the electromechanical conversion between the electrical signal
and the SAW. Thus, the T matrix has three ports of which two are acoustical ports and one
is an electrical port. The transfer matrix D describes a SAW propagation path between two
representative sections, while matrix G represents a reflector array. Detailed mathematical
forms of these transfer matrices are given in Appendix J.
Depending on the precise configuration of a SAW device, any number of T, D, and
G matrices can be used, but their basic forms remain the same. For example, a SAW
microsensor comprising an IDT and a reflector (Figure 13.1) can be modeled simply by
using three transfer matrices TI, D2, and G3, as illustrated in Figure 13.2.
Figure 13.1 
Basic elements of a SAW-IDT microsensor: IDT (left), spacing and reflector (right)
Figure 13.2 
Schematic representation of a SAW device using transfer matrix elements

SAW DEVICE MODELING VIA COUPLED-MODE THEORY
361
Figure 13.1 shows the actual device layout that has a metallic IDT, metallic reflector,
and spacing in between on top of a piezoelectric substrate1. Thus, they can be represented,
as shown in Figure 13.2, with transfer matrices T, D, and G for each element of the SAW
device (the numbers 1, 2, and 3 are shown for bookkeeping purposes when dual devices
or even array devices are modeled).
The electrical signals passing in and out of the IDT are represented by the scalars a
and h. The SAWs coming in and out of each representative element are described by the
symbols +W and ~W - one for each propagation direction. Thus, any (n — l)th SAW
amplitude coming in and out of the nth section (T, D, or G) has the following relation,
where the components of the transfer matrices are represented by italic typeface.
(13.2)
This matrix representation of a lumped system model of a SAW device allows other
SAW structures to be modeled as well. As long as the SAW device is a combination
of IDT, reflectors, and spacings, corresponding transfer matrices can be used in the
same order as the actual device layout. Figures 13.3 and 13.4 show the structures and
models of an IDT-IDT pair and a two-port SAW resonator. More complex structures of
SAW devices can also be modeled by just adding more transfer matrices at appropriate
locations.
The acoustic part and the electrical part of the signals Wi can be conveniently sepa-
rated for the IDT equations and hence solved to determine the SAW amplitudes. Then,
the overall acoustic part can be represented by the simple product of each acoustic
transfer matrix in turn. For example, the overall acoustic matrix for the resonator shown

where [T3] and [75] are 2 x 2 acoustic submatrices of a 3 x 3 T matrix, and an overall
acoustic matrix [M] (or M) can be defined as
[M] = [G1] • [D2] • [T3] • [D4] • T5 • [D6] • [G7]
(13.4)
Likewise, the acoustic part of other SAW devices can also be modeled in a straightforward
manner.
The SAW amplitudes associated with an IDT have an electrical part as an input or
output power. For example, from Figure 13.4,
(13.5)
where 03 is the scalar input power to IDT 3 and [t3] is a 2 x 1 submatrix of the 3 x 3 T

substituting Equations (13.6) and (13.7) into Equation (13.5) gives an overall transfer
matrix of the SAW device in terms of W0'S and W7's for a given input #3, as shown in
the following equation:
[M]
a 3 - [ G i ] - [ D 2 ] ' [ T 3 ]
(13.8)
By applying the appropriate boundary conditions, Equation (13.8) becomes soluble with
two subequations and two unknown parameters. Usually, the boundary conditions are
W0 = 0 and — W7 = 0 because there are no external sources to SAWs, that is, from
outside the device. Any reflections of the SAWs from the substrate edges, or other struc-
tures outside the SAW device, are suppressed by using an acoustic absorber and/or serrated
(or slanted) edges.
The basic form of the transfer matrices remains the same for other devices, whereas
some of the parameters inside the transfer matrix are changed according to the choice of
material and geometric constants. For example, a SAW gyroscope is a combination of a
SAW resonator (Figure 13.4) and a SAW sensor (Figure 13.1) placed orthogonal to each
other, as shown in Figure 13.5.
By providing a known power to an IDT of the resonator, the response of the resonator
part can be solved in just the same way as before. The only difference in solving the
sensor part is the boundary condition on each IDT because secondary waves are generated
upon device rotation and they become an input SAW to the passive IDT that acts as a
Coriolis sensing element. The secondary SAWs are +W2 and —W1 and +Wo and — W3
and are again zero, provided there are no external SAW sources. Outputs b\ and b3 are the
resultant electrical signals because of the secondary SAW (Figure 13.6). Again, different
SAW devices can be modeled in similar ways and solved by applying the appropriate
boundary conditions.

13.3 WIRELESS SAW-BASED MICROSENSORS
In order to obtain a high sensitivity, SAW microsensors are usually constructed as
electric oscillators2 using the SAW device as the frequency control component. By
accurately measuring the oscillation frequency, a small change in the physical variables
can be detected by the sensors. A typical SAW oscillator sensor schematic is shown in
Figure 13.7.
Briefly, an amplifier connects two DDTs on a piezoelectric wafer so that oscillations of
the SAW propagating from one IDT to the other are set up by feedback. The oscillation
frequency satisfies the condition that the total phase shift of the loop equals 2n 
and
varies with the SAW velocity or the distance (spacing) between the IDTs. The oscillator
includes an amplifier and so requires an external electrical power supply and, therefore,
cannot be operated in a passive wireless mode.
As stated earlier, the operating frequency of SAW devices ranges from 10 MHz to a
few GHz. When an IDT is directly connected to an antenna, the SAW can be excited
remotely by electromagnetic waves. Thus, it is possible to construct passive, wireless,
remotely operable SAW devices. The applications of remote sensors was first reported by
Bao et al. (1987). The temperature of a passive SAW device with a small antenna can be
remotely read out by a microwave communications system (Suh et al. 2000).
2 Acoustic wave oscillators are described in Section 11.7.

Figure 13.8 Schematic diagram of a remote reading sensor system with passive SAW sensor
The schematic diagram of IDT and reflectors in Figure 13.8 shows the basic operating
principle of an IDT with a wireless communication interface. One IDT and two reflectors
are fabricated on the surface of a piezoelectric crystal wafer. These micro IDT and SAW
sensors can be fabricated using the microlithographic process described in the previous
chapter.
The IDT connects directly to a small antenna called the device antenna. This antenna-
IDT configuration is able to convert the microwave signal from air to SAW signal on
the wafer surface and vice versa. The reading system has a linear frequency-modulated
(FM) signal generator with a system antenna that transmits these FM signals. The signals
are then received by the device antenna and converted by the antenna-IDT to SAWs that
propagate along the surface of the piezoelectric wafer.

366
IDT MICROSENSORS
The echoes from the two reflectors are picked up by the antenna-IDT and sent back to
the system antenna. The echo signals are delayed copies of the transmitted FM signal. The
delay times mainly depend on the velocity of the SAW and the distance between the IDT
and the reflectors. A mixer, which takes the transmitted FM as a reference signal, outputs
the signals of frequency difference between the reflected and the transmitted signals.
Because the transmitted signal is linearly FM, the frequency difference is proportional to
the time delay. By using a spectrum analysis technique, such as a fast fourier transform
(FFT), the two echo signals can be separated in the frequency domain because the delay
times are different.
Figure 13.9 shows the layout of a transceiver telemetry system developed by a small
US company (HVS Technologies).
This system operates in the range of 905 to 925 MHz. The circuit operates as follows:
The input signal is pulsed FM. A pulser synchronises the direct current (DC) voltage
ramp circuit, voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) output, and the A/D converter during
pulses of typically 16 ms duration. During the pulse, the DC voltage ramp circuit linearly
tunes the VCO from 905 to 925 MHz. The VCO output is controlled by a diode switch
and then amplified to 50 mW by a high isolation amplifier. A coupler diverts a sample
of the signal to the LO input of the mixer. A circulator sends the transmitted signal to
the antenna and also the reflected signal, through an automatic gain control amplifier, to
the radio frequency (RF) input of the mixer. Then, a low-pass filter removes any high-
frequency noise and signals and then the signal is digitised at 10 M samples per second
at 10 bit resolution. Finally, a programmable digital signal processing (DSP) chip, such
as the TI TMS320C3X, is used to extract the delay information and compute the desired
parameter. This value is then shown on a liquid crystal display (LCD).

13.4 APPLICATIONS
In this section, we present in detail some examples of the applications of SAW-IDT
devices as temperature, strain, pressure, torque, rotation rate (gyroscope), humidity, and
so forth sensors. In the next chapter, the applications are extended to include micro-
electromechanical system (MEMS) IDT structures along with IDTs for remote sensing of
acceleration.
13.4.1 Strain Sensor
In this section, a remote MEMS-IDT strain sensor system is employed to study the
deflection and strain of a 'flex-beam' type structure of a helicopter rotor (Varadan et al.
(1997)). The system is based on the fact that the phase delay is changed because of the
strain in the sensor substrate. The system consists of a remote passive SAW sensor read
by a fixed microwave system station.
The FM signal sent by the system antenna is expressed as
S(t) = A COS(O)Q + fit/2)t 
(13.9)
where COQ is the initial frequency of the FM signal, /JL is 2n times the rate of modulation,
and t is time.
The echoes from the two reflectors, S\(t} and 82(1), are the same as the transmitted
signal S(t) but with different amplitudes and time delays t\ and t2, respectively. These
may be written as
Si(0 = A1 cos(w0 + V>t/2)(t - fi) 
(13.10)
and
S2(t) = A2cos(o)0 + l^t/2)(t -t2) 
(13.11)
with
+ Te 
(13.12)
+ re 
(13.13)
where v is the SAW velocity, d\ and d2 are the distances from the IDT transducer to
the two reflectors, and re is the total of other delays (such as the delay in the electronic
circuit and devices and the traveling time of the electromagnetic wave3) that is the same
for both echoes.
Through the mixer that uses the transmitted signal as a reference and low-pass filter,
frequency differential signals are obtained as
Ei(t) = BI COS\JJLtit + (cOQti - fJLti)] = BI COS[(i>it + <pi] 
(13.14)
and
E2(t) = B2 cos[/Ltf2f + (co0t2 - nt] = B2 cos[co2t + (p2] 
(13.15)
3 For short distances, this time is negligible.

368 
IDT MICROSENSORS
with different amplitudes B and angular frequencies. The frequencies and phases of these
two signals depend on the delay times. The two signals can be separated in the frequency
domain. Because (wo is usually much greater than , the phase shift is more sensitive to
the variation of the delay time than the frequency.
The difference of the two phases can be written as
<P = (<Pi- <P2) = N) - M('i + '2)/2][/2 - ti] 
(13.16)
where the extra delay time of the second echo compared with the first is equal to the
round trip time of the acoustic wave traveling from the first reflector to the second and
is given by
T = (t2-ti) = — 
(13.17)
v
where d is the distance between the two reflectors.
The phase difference is sensitive to the change in the delay time. The variation of the
phase difference because of the change in the delay time is expressed as
and 
Ar = 2AJ/U 
(13.18)
Because COQ is usually much larger than the other term, the equation reduces to
(13.19)
The wave traveling time T is proportional to the distance between the two reflectors and
is inversely proportional to the velocity. If the possible velocity variation of the SAW
under stress is neglected and we take into account only the direct effect on the distance,
we have
2sd
(13.20)
where e is the mechanical strain (Ad/W) and r0 is the traveling time when the strain
is zero.
Thus, the sensitivity of this wireless sensor system depends on the operating frequency
and the round traveling time of the SAW between the two reflectors.
13.4.1.1 Sensor dimensions and reading system
A strain sensor was developed by Varadan et al. (1997), wherein YZ-cut lithium niobate
(LiNbO3) crystal of dimensions 3.7 mm x 6.7 mm x 0.5 mm was used. An IDT was
designed with a central frequency of 912.5 MHz. The IDT is connected directly to a
small antenna of dimensions 25 mm x 75 mm x 0.3 mm. The distance between the two
reflectors was 0.15 mm and the round trip traveling time of the surface waves was 0.1 us
at zero stress. The wireless reading system had a patch antenna to send out FM microwave
signals and to receive the echoes coming from the reflectors through the antenna-IDT.
The transmitted signal was linearly modulated from 905 to 920 MHz in a pulse lasting
1760th of a second. The resolution of the phase detector of the system is 1°. According

APPLICATIONS 
369
to Equation (13.20), the strain sensitivity of the system is estimated to be an impressive
2 x 10—5 per phase degree.
13.4.1.2 Calibration
The calibration was done on an uniform cantilever beam. The sensor was glued to a
fibreglass cantilever beam of length 172 mm, width 25 mm and thickness 1.5 mm. The
centre of the piezoelectric wafer is 53.3 mm from the root of the beam and the SAW
propagating direction is along the beam length. In order to reduce the effect of the substrate
in the deformation of the structure, a relatively soft plastic epoxy was used to mount the
sensor substrate. The softness of the bonding layer and the wall of the package of the
sensor make the strain on the crystal wafer surface less than the strain on the beam surface.
Therefore, a calibration is required to determine the actual sensitivity of the sensor to the
strain on the beam surface.
If we neglect the effect of the bonded piezoelectric wafer, the strain on the surface of
the beam can be calculated by simple beam theory and written as (Gere and Timoshenko
1990),
., 3rb(/ - *)
£x = -ds——3 
(13.21)
where / is the length of the beam, jc is the distance of the location of the piezoelectric
wafer from the root, ^ is the thickness of the beam, and ds is the displacement at the tip
of the beam. In this experiment, a force at the tip bends the beam and a dial indicator
measures the tip displacement.
The wireless IDT microsensor system successfully detects the shift of the phase differ-
ence 
between the two echoes with respect to the variation of the tip displacement.
The strains sx are calculated, using Equation (13.21), from the tip displacements, and the
results are plotted in Figure 13.10.
The data show that the phase shift varies almost linearly with the strain when the
strain is less than 0.0012. For larger strains, nonlinearity and larger fluctuations appear.
The nonlinearity may be due to the glue used to bond the sensor substrate, the large
deformation of the beam, or some other cause.
13.4.1.3 Dynamic strain measurement test
In a dynamic strain measurement test, the beam was extended to 750 mm in length. A
mass of 200 g was mounted at the tip to reduce the vibration frequency. The beam was
tilted off the vertical axis because of the inclination of the beam support itself, as shown in
Figure 13.11. A static strain was developed on the surface of the beam from gravitational
forces. The end of the original beam was shifted a distance w of 6 mm from the neutral
line. The theoretical strain at this sensor position was calculated from Equation (13.21) to
be about —224 microstrains. The sensor detected an actual strain of —276 microstrains.
The difference between the theoretical and experimental values is less than the resolution
of the sensor system, that is, about 51 microstrains.
Then, a force applied at the tip further deformed the beam, resulting in an additional
deflection of the beam by 15 mm. A free vibration was established by releasing the tip.

strain of the beam was found to vary periodically corresponding to the vibration time
period of 1.4 second and decayed because of damping effects. The initial maximum
strain was found to be —1100 microstrains, which agrees with the calculated value of
strain. The sensor wirelessly measured the strain caused by both the static and dynamic
loads.

13.4.2 Temperature Sensor
An IDT and two reflectors are patterned onto the surface of a YZ-cut lithium niobate
wafer, as shown in Figure 13.13. This transducer connects directly to a small antenna. In
the remote reading system, an FM generator sends a linearly FM signal to an antenna and
to a mixer. The signal transmitted by the system antenna is received by the small antenna
connected to the LiNbOa wafer and converted into a SAW by the transducer. The echoes
from the reflectors are received by the IDT and are transmitted back to the system antenna
and mixed with the original FM signal in the mixer. The echoes are delayed copies of the
original FM signal. The time delays depend on the SAW velocity, which is a sensitive
function of the ambient temperature. The difference in frequency signals, usually called
the intermediate frequencies (IPs), appear at the output of the mixer. The frequencies
and the phase shifts of the IFs vary with the time delays. Because the changes in time
delay with temperature are very small, the phase shifts, which are more sensitive than the
frequency, are preferred. In order to avoid the effects of time delay variations other than
temperature changes (e.g. the changes of distance between the two antennae), the temper-
ature is determined by the difference in the phase shifts of the two IFs corresponding to
the two reflectors (Bao et al. 1987, 1994).
As stated earlier, the initial FM signal is expressed as
S(t) = A cos[0(f)] = A cos[(wo + 
2)t + 00]
(13.22)
The echo from the first reflector input (SO to the mixer is the same as the original FM
signal, but with a time delay t\ and different amplitude, so that it is written as

where
f i = Te +
(13.24)
and TI is the time delay corresponding to the surface wave traveling from the transducer
to the first reflector and back. This delay can be written as
T}=2di/v 
(13.25)
where d\ is the distance between the IDT and the first reflector, i> is the SAW velocity,
and Te is the time delay due to the electronic circuit and signal propagation.
The IF corresponding to S1(t) is expressed as
(13.26)
Both the frequency t1 and the phase shift 1 = a>0t\ - n\t2/2 depend on the time delay
ri. Because CDQ is usually much greater than 
, the phase shift, as stated earlier, is more
sensitive than the variation of the frequency.
From Equation (13.24), we know that the total delay t\ depends not only on the trav-
eling time of the surface wave that is a function of the temperature but also on the
microwave propagation path. The latter varies with the distance between the transmitted

excitation and the SAW device. To eliminate the error from the variation of re, a second
reflector is put on the wafer. The corresponding time delay is 12- Similar to the first
reflector, we have the IF corresponding to the second reflector as
h(t} = B2 cos[0(f) - 02(01 = B2 cos[+^t2t + co0t2 - ^2t/2] 
(13.27)
where
t2 = re + T2 
and 
T2 = 2d2/v 
(13.28)
and d2 is the distance between the IDT and the second reflector. The difference between
the two phase shifts can now be written as
<Pd = (<P2 - <p\) = No - M/2fe + ti)](t2 -t1) = Kr 
(13.29)
where
K = a>o - fJL/2(t2 + t\)**a)0 
(13.30)
Since O>Q ^> pL/2(t2 + 1\ ) as can be seen from the values calculated and
(13.31)
where TO is the total travel time of the surface wave from the first reflector to the second
and back. This time being inversely proportional to the surface wave speed is very sensi-
tive to the temperature in the vicinity of the SAW device and we propose the following
relationship between the travel time t and the temperature T
T = T0[l+a(T -To)] 
(13.32)
where a is the temperature coefficient of the time delay of the SAW device and TO is the
ambient temperature.
From Equation (13.29),
+ KTO(! - T0) 
(13.33)
= aT +b
a = KaiQ 
and b = KTQ(\ - 7b) 
(13.34)
If the resolution of phase shift difference in degrees is A<p, then the resolution of the
temperature reading will be
AT = A<p/a 
(13.35)
The wafer is made of YZ-cut lithium niobate with
a = 94xlO~ 6/°C 
(13.36)

374 
IDT MICROSENSORS
The two reflectors are located such that the time delay at room temperature TQ is
T\ = 1 us 
and 
T2 = 1.1 us 
(13.37)
Then,
TO = 0.1 us 
(13.38)
The transmitted FM signal is pulse-modulated with a time duration of 1760th of a second.
The carrier frequency varies linearly from 905 MHz to 925 MHz during the period. The
parameters in Equation (13.22) for the FM signal are
= 905 MHz 
(13.39)
fi/2n = 1.2 x 10~3 MHz/us 
(13.40)
In operation, the distance between the two antennas is 1 to 2 meters so that re can be
neglected compared with x\ or 12- The temperature variation can be in the range 0 to
200 °C. The first and second terms in Equation (13.30) can now be calculated
= 2n x 905 x 106 - 1.2 x 10-3 x 1.05/2 
(13.41)
= 2n x 905 x 106
So, the approximation in Equation (13.30) is clearly justified. From Equations (13.34),
(13.36), and (13.38), the constant a is
a = 3.06 angular degrees/°C 
(13.42)
The resolution of the phase shift is 1° so that the resolution of the temperature reading is
given by Equation (13.35) as
= 0.33°C 
(13.43)
The experimental calibration is done in a temperature-controlled chamber called a Delta
9023, (Figure 13.14).
A digital hand-held thermometer (Keruco Instruments Co.) with an accuracy of ±0.2 °C
is taken as the temperature standard. The temperature range in the experiment is from
room temperature (near 20 °C) to a maximum of 140 °C. The straight line theory, as
shown in Figure 13.15, fits well the experimental points of phase against temperature.
The equation for the line in Figure 13.15 is obtained by the least mean square method
and is given by
?> = 2.897-49.1 
(13.44)
The value of the slope coefficient a (2.89) is in good agreement with that (3.06) estimated
from Equation (13.42). The root mean square (rms) error of the phase difference is equal
to 0.78°, which corresponds to an rms error of 0.26 °C.

The SAW-based pressure sensors use the strain principle described in Section 13.4,1. To
illustrate this principle, let us consider a circular quartz membrane with thickness h. The
deflection of the plate, w, under uniformly distributed pressure (P) is assumed to be
smaller than h/5. The differential equation describing the elastic behaviour of the middle

13.4.4 Humidity Sensor
There is a need for the development of a remote, wireless, and passive sensor system
for humidity measurement that is more accurate than conventional methods. Here, such
a system is discussed on the basis of a SAW device.
The following sections describe a wireless sensor system that can remotely interrogate
a passive SAW sensor for the measurement of relative humidity (RH) (Hollinger et al.
1999). The principle of operation of the wireless SAW-based sensor system was described
earlier. The FM generator continuously emits pulses with duration of 16.7 ms that are
linearly frequency modulated from 905 to 925 MHz.
The original FM signal is expressed as
= Acos[0(t)]
(13.48)

APPLICATIONS 
377
where
0(t) = (w0 + 
ut)t+00 
(13.49)
Consider a simplified SAW device with only two reflectors. The echo from the first (S\)
input to the mixer is the same as the original FM signal, but with a time delay t\ and a
different amplitude
(13.50)
01 (0 = [w0 + u(t — t 1)/2](t - t1) + 00 
(13.51)
The IF corresponding to S 1(t) is expressed as
I1(0 = B1 cos[ut1t + w0t1 - 
ut2
1/ 
2] 
(13.52)
Both the frequency ut1 and the phase shift <p1 = (wnt1 — ut1
2)/2 depend on the time
delay t1 . Once again, because wn is usually much greater than ut1 , the phase shift is more
sensitive than the variation of the frequency.
The total delay t\ depends not only on the travel time of the surface wave that is a
function of the physical parameter being sensed but also the RF propagation time, which
is a function of separation between the sensor and the reader. To eliminate this error, a
second reflector is used that has a different time delay t2 and results in the following IF.
I 2(t) = B2 cos[ut2t + 
w0t2 
—ut2/2] 
(13.53)
The difference between the two phase shifts can be written as
<pd = [w0 — u /2(t2 + t1)](t2 — t1) = KT 
(13.54)
where
K = w0— u/2(t2 + 
t1)~ 
W0 
(13.55)
because W0 » U / 2(T2 + t1) for the values of the present system.
Now r = T2 - t1 = 2d /v 
(13.56)
where r is the total travel time of the surface wave from the first reflector to the second
and back, d is their physical separation, and v is the SAW velocity.
For the design of the humidity sensor, the difference in delay between two reflectors
(r) is 1.40 us. The differential phase shift can be written as
(13.57)
v
The change in the differential phase shift due to a change in humidity is then

From preliminary measurements of humidity, it is seen that

Although the change in velocity is small, we can replace v1 in the denominator of the
last term in Equation (13.58) by u0. Then, using Equations (13.56), (13.58), and (13.59)
we have

Therefore, because the wireless system has a phase difference measurement resolution of
1°, this system should provide a resolution of 0.72 percent RH for measurements.
The substrate material for the SAW device is made of YZ-LiNbO3, which is a Y-axis
cut and Z-axis-propagating lithium niobate crystal. The size of the piezoelectric substrate
is approximately 4.3 mm by 8 mm and 0.5 mm thick. The IDTs and reflectors are made
of aluminum and are deposited by sputtering using appropriate masks.
Because the SAW sensor response can be affected by both the temperature and humi-
dity, a design has been developed that allows for the simultaneous measurement of
temperature and humidity. As shown in Figure 13.17, four IDTs are arranged in a stag-
gered manner along the centre of the piezoelectric substrate with reflectors on both sides
of the IDTs. On one side, between the IDTs and the right set of reflectors, a moisture-
sensitive coating (SiO2 in this case) is deposited. The substrate between the IDTs and the
left set of reflectors is left bare, as lithium niobate shows very little response to changes

in humidity. Therefore, the uncoated side is used for measuring the temperature, which is
then used to compensate for temperature changes in the humidity measurement from the
coated side. There are up to three phase shifters (not shown) in front of each reflector.
The unique arrangement of these phase shifters gives the sensors their unique identifica-
tion number, which can also be determined by the wireless system based on the reflected
electromagnetic signal. The bus is connected to the two terminals of each IDT and this
is inductively coupled with the sensor antenna through an air gap.
The SiO2 coating used on the wireless humidity sensor is 40 to 50 nm thick and was
deposited using plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD). A glass mask
was prepared to deposit the film only on the area indicated in Figure 13.17. The coating
is amorphous and porous to give it a high sensitivity to water vapour.
In order to protect the IDTs and reflectors, they should be coated with a very thin
(about 1 um) layer of a passivation layer that is not affected by moisture. One candidate
is amorphous silicon nitride (SiNxHy). SiNxHy has excellent passivation properties, which
make it ideal for use in the semiconductor industry as an insulator and as a protective
layer for silicon devices. SiNxHy can be deposited from the reaction of silane (SiH4)
with either ammonia (NH3) or nitrogen (N2). Using plasma to assist in the deposition,
these films are deposited at much lower temperatures than by any other techniques (about
350 °C instead of more than 750 °C).
Figure 13.18(a) shows the experimental setup for remote humidity measurement using
wireless and passive SAW sensors. The main components of the system consist of the
SAW sensor, the transceiver, central interface unit (CIU), and computer. A commercial
RH sensor (Omega RH82) is also placed inside the humidity chamber for calibration and
verification.
SAW devices based on a LiNbO3 substrate with part of the substrate coated with a thin
layer of humidity-sensitive silicon dioxide are used. The delay line in the SAW sensor
is now sensitive to changes in humidity as the silicon dioxide adsorbs moisture from the
humid air. The transceiver emits RF pulses that are picked up by the SAW sensor; these
pulses are converted to acoustic waves on the surface of the sensor, which are further
reflected by the uniquely spaced reflectors. The reflected signal received back by the
transceiver contains the sensor information. This signal passes through the CIU in which
all the signal processing takes place and then the processed data is sent to the computer
through the serial interface.
The phase difference between two reflectors along the coated part of the propagation
path can be used as a measure of the humidity. The RH of the enclosed chamber is
changed by pumping nitrogen into the chamber through a bubbler. The bubbler wets the
nitrogen gas, which when introduced into the chamber, causes the humidity inside the
chamber to increase.
The following graph, Figure 13.18(b), shows the plot between RH, as measured by the
commercial humidity sensor, and the phase change in the humidity sensor, as measured by
the transceiver and computer system. It can be seen that the phase change varies linearly
with RH.
The straight line, shown in Figure 13.18(b), has been fitted to the experimental data
using least squares. The equation of the fitted line is <p = 1.4 percent RH + 75.9. There-
fore, as stated earlier, because the wireless system has a phase difference measurement
resolution of 1°, this system is able to provide an excellent resolution of 0.69 percent RH
measurements.

13.4.5 SAW-Based Gyroscope
In general, gyroscopes have a wide range of applications. They are
• Consumer electronics - picture stabilisation in three-dimensional (3D) pointers, cam-
corders, geostationary positioning system (GPS)
• Industrial products - robots, machine control, guided vehicles.
• Medical applications - wheel chairs, surgical tools
• Military applications - smart ammunition, guided missiles and weapon systems (Soder-
kvist 1994; Yazdi et al. 1998)

APPLICATIONS 
381
As technology matures, the market for low-cost angular sensors will extend into high
volume of micromachined sensors for complete automotive pitch and roll control, which
is the final step toward realisation of integrated chassis control (Eddy and Soarks 1998).
This includes sensing the steering, suspension, power train and breaking systems for real-
time vehicle control. All these systems require an application-specific low-cost sensor
and actuator. Future air bag systems will be equipped with a low-g accelerometer and a
gyroscope. Low-cost and low-g accelerometers are already in use, whereas gyroscopes that
are compatible with the automotive industries' requirements, are not yet on the market.
The construction of the gyroscope is based on integration of a SAW resonator (Bell
and Li 1976; Staples 1974) and a SAW sensor (White 1985; Ballantine et al 1997)
that operates primarily in the Rayleigh mode. The Rayleigh wave is a SAW that has its
energy concentrated within one wavelength of the substrate surface (Achenbach 1973).
The displacement of particles near the surface, due to the Rayleigh wave, has out-of-
surface motion that traces an elliptical path (Slobodnik 1976). The Rayleigh wave can
be generated at the surface of a piezoelectric material by applying a voltage to an IDT
patterned on the substrate (White and Voltmer 1965). Lao (1980) derived theoretically the
dependence of SAW velocity on the rotation rate of the wave-propagating medium and
it is established that, for an isotropic medium, the rotation rate is a function of Poisson's
ratio. Kurosowa et al. (1998) proposed a SAW gyroscope sensor based on an equivalent
circuit simulation. He concluded that the angular velocity could not be detected because
of the mismatch of resonant frequencies. Whereas Varadan et al. (2000a,b) presented the
design, proof of concept through fabrication, and performance evaluation of a SAW gyro-
scope using a two-port resonator and a sensor. In this section, we present the equivalent
circuit model analysis and experimental evaluation of a SAW gyroscope (Varadan et al.
2000b). The SAW resonator is designed and optimised using the coupled-mode theory.
The gyroscope is optimised using a cross-field circuit model for numerical simulation.
This gyroscope has the added capability that it can be used as a wireless gyroscope that
can be easily integrated onto a SAW accelerometer (Subramanian et al. 1997).
13.4.5.1 Principle of SAW-based gyroscope
Any mechanical gyroscope must have a stable reference vibrating motion (V) of a mass
(m) such that when subjected to a rotation, the angular rotation (£2) perpendicular to the
reference motion would cause Coriolis forces at the frequency of the reference motion.
The strength of the Coriolis force F is a measure of the rotation rate and is given by
F = 2mV 
X& 
(13.62)
It is well known that in a standing Rayleigh surface wave, the particle vibration will
be perpendicular to the surface. This particle vibration can be cleverly utilised for the
creation of a reference vibratory motion for the gyroscope.
The concept of utilising a SAW for gyroscopic motion is illustrated in Figure 13.19.
It consists of IDTs, reflectors, and a metallic dot array within the cavity, which are
fabricated through microfabrication techniques on the surface of a piezoelectric substrate.
The resonator IDTs create a SAW that propagates back and forth between the reflectors
and forms a standing wave pattern within the cavity because of the collective reflection

382 
IDT MICROSENSORS
from the reflectors. A SAW reflection from individual metal strips adds in phase if the
reflector periodicity is equal to half a wavelength. For the established standing wave
pattern in the cavity, shown in Figure 13.19, a typical substrate particle at the nodes of
the standing wave has no amplitude of deformation in the z-direction. However, at or
near the antinodes of the standing wave pattern, such particles experience large amplitude
of vibration in the z-direction, which serves as the reference vibrating motion for this
gyroscope. To amplify acoustically the magnitude of the Coriolis force in phase, metallic
dots (proof mass) are positioned strategically at the antinode locations. The rotation (ft,
x-direction) perpendicular to the velocity (V in ±z-direction) of the oscillating masses (m)
produces Coriolis force (F = 2m V x ft, in +y-direction) in the perpendicular direction,
as illustrated in Figure 13.19. This Coriolis force establishes a SAW in the y-direction
with the same frequency as the reference oscillation. The metallic dot array is placed along
the j-direction such that the SAW, because of the Coriolis forces, adds up coherently.
The generated SAW is then sensed by the sensing IDTs placed in the v-direction.
The operating frequency of the device is determined by the separation between the
reflector gratings, periodicity of reflectors, and the IDTs. The separation between reflectors
was chosen as an integral number of half-wavelengths such that standing waves are created
between both reflectors. The periodicity of IDT was chosen as a half-wavelength (A./2)
of the SAW. Therefore, for a given material, the SAW velocity in the material and the
desired operating frequency f0 define the periodicity of the IDT.
The substrate used for the present gyroscope is 128YX LiNbO3 because of its high
electromechanical coupling coefficient. For such materials, the wave velocities in the

x- and y-directions are different because of its anisotropy. The effective SAW velocities
were experimentally measured in the x- and y-directions because the device utilises wave
propagation in these directions and the effect of the metallic dot array on the velocities
in both directions is not fully known. To measure the effective velocities of the waves in
both directions, two narrow-band IDT sets with the same periodicity were placed in the
x- and y-direction so that they included the dot array in the middle. Hence, the response
measured using IDTs in x- and y-directions were different for the same periodicity of
these IDT sets, and the velocities of both directions were measured as 3961 m/s and
3656 m/s, respectively. The difference between published values (Campbell and Jones
1968) (3980 ~ 4000 m/s) and these experimental results is mainly due to the effect of
metallisation and the metallic dot array. The width of IDT fingers and its spacing for the
SAW gyroscope were determined by these velocities, as shown in Table 13.1.
Changes in wave velocity, frequency, or amplitude indicate physical property changes
occurring at the device surface. To reduce the effect of the metallic dot array inside the
SAW resonator, the size of each dot in the array was chosen such that it is sufficiently
smaller than the wavelength in both directions. Because the amplitudes of the standing
waves are dependent on material damping and electromechanical transduction losses,
the transmitting and sensing IDTs are located at the standing wave maxima in order to
reduce the transduction loss. To obtain a good resonator performance with this high-
coupling coefficient substrate, the aperture of the IDTs and the number of IDT fingers
were minimised but were large enough to avoid acoustic beam diffraction. Also, a larger
spacing between the IDTs was chosen compared with conventional resonators because
electromagnetic coupling between IDTs has to be avoided and sufficient metallic dots
were accommodated within the cavity to induce the Coriolis effect. The number and
aperture of IDTs, electromechanical coupling coefficient, and dielectric permittivity of
the substrate determine the electrical impedance of the gyroscope. Thus, the spacing,
aperture, and number of IDTs had to be chosen as a compromise between the differing
requirements.
13.4.5.2 Design of a SAW gyroscope
It is important to know the characteristic impedance, admittance, bandwidth, and sensi-
tivity near the operating frequency of the SAW gyroscope because the sensing IDTs have
to be designed such that they efficiently pick up the SAW waves generated from Coriolis
force. As stated earlier, the numerical simulation of the SAW resonator is done using
coupling-of-mode (COM) theory because a SAW device can be easily represented by
several basic elements that are transfer matrices of representative sections of a SAW

384
IDT MICROSENSORS
device. The sensor is modeled using Mason's equivalent circuit concept. For the effective
numerical calculation of the gyroscope output, a cross-field equivalent circuit model was
chosen because then Coriolis force can be directly related to input force on the SAW
sensor model.
Various SAW devices have been modeled using COM theory. The application of
coupled-mode theory on SAW devices for given geometry and material data is well
documented by Cross and Schmidt (1977), Haus and Wright (1980), and Campbell (1998).
Figures 13.20 and 13.21 show a modeling example of an IDT—IDT pair and a two-port
SAW resonator, respectively. Different complex layouts of SAW devices can be modeled
by adding more transfer functions at appropriate locations.

matrices. The G matrix represents SAW reflectors, T matrix represents the relation

there are no incoming waves from outside the reflectors and output impedances are

mission line matrices for appropriate sections. The amplitudes of the waves are represented
by scalar electric potential 3>, which can be written in terms of SAW velocity v(x) as

The total acoustic matrix [M] for a two-port resonator can be now obtained as
[M] = [G l][D 2][t3][D 4](t 5][D 6][G 7] 
(13.82)
Here, [G1] and [G 7] are related to two SAW reflectors at the end and [D2] and [D6] are the
spacings between the gratings and adjacent IDTs. [D4] is the separation between the IDTs.
[t3] and [t5] are the acoustic submatrices as shown in Equation (13.79). Equation (13.82)
can be solved for the frequency response of the resonator by applying the boundary
conditions.
w0+ = w7-=0

which assumes that there is no external SAW at the input reference side.
It is also noted that the source and load impedances determine the electrical properties
of the transmission line. It can be seen from Figure 13.22 that
[W2] = t3[W3] + a3T3 
(13.84)
Applying the foregoing boundary conditions for the transducer [t3], the first-order response
of two-port resonator can be obtained by solving the following equations:
[W5] = [D6][G7][W7] 
(13.85)

By applying the aforementioned boundary conditions, 2 x 2 matrix equation could be
solved:
The output voltage Vout (S21) from the IDT can be written as
Vout = b5 =

(13.86)
(13.87)
The output voltage is computed for different frequencies and is compared with the
measured data from 65 to 85 MHz obtained from the SAW resonator using an HP 85 I0C
Network Analyzer. Figure 13.23 presents the measured and computed voltages using
Equation (13.87) for a resonator with five IDT pairs and a period of 52 um.
The voltage on the transmission line, which is related to the surface potential, mainly
shows the behaviour of the particle displacement at the surface. The surface electrical
potential can then be computed after determining all the W vectors. The magnitude of
surface potential in the cavity region of the resonator is an indication of the formation of
standing waves, as shown in Figure 13.24.
There is a fixed ratio between the SAW displacement components and the surface
electrical potential depending on the crystal cut. 128YX lithium niobate has the ratio of
0.2 nm z-displacement per unit surface potential (Datta 1986). For the present gyroscope,
the z-displacement is of extreme importance because the SAW standing wave has the
maximum z-displacement at antinodal points. Any mass at these antinode points has
maximum amplitude of vibration, which is utilised as a reference vibration. When these

particles are subjected to a rotation vector, a Coriolis force will be generated perpendicular
to their vibration velocity vectors, as mentioned earlier. The velocity and the displacement
of a particle at the antinode points are studied from the calculated surface potential using
COM theory and are presented in Figures 13.25 and 13.26, respectively.
The velocity of a particle in the middle of the resonator at the antinode point is
calculated for the resonant frequency. Using this velocity value and the mass at the
antinodal points, the Coriolis force is calculated for different input rates. This Coriolis
force is the input to the gyroscope sensor, which is discussed later.
After modeling the resonator, it is imperative to know the sensor characteristics. The
cross-field model was chosen to simulate the sensor and gyroscope. Various SAW sensors
have been successfully represented and simulated using the cross-field equivalent circuit
model derived from the Mason circuit. In order to model the SAW gyrosensor, which
generates a voltage output owing to rotation, the induced SAW due to the Coriolis force
has to be modeled as an input force through the transformer ratio in the SAW equivalent
circuit. In this model, the electric field distribution under the electrode is approximated
as normal to the piezoelectric substrate, which is equivalent to a parallel-plate capac-
itor. Each IDT is represented by a three-port network, as shown in Figure 13.27. Here
port 1 and 2 represent the electrical equivalent of acoustic ports and port 3 is a true
electrical port.
Using an RF transmission line analogy, the three-port network circuit can be repre-
sented as shown in Figures 13.28 and 13.29. Figure 13.28 is the representation of one
pair of IDTs and Figure 13.29 for that of a pair of reflectors. The acoustic forces F are
transformed to electrical equivalent voltages V and particle velocities at the surface v are
transformed to equivalent currents /. These transformations can be written in terms of a
proportionality constant 0 as

Once the unit cell of IDT pair is modeled, each model can be cascaded, depending on the 
number of pairs for the sensor IDTs. For the present case, we used 30 pairs. The Coriolis 
force is the input force, that is, the input voltage at one end of the constructed equivalent 
circuit, as shown in Figure 13.28. 
The other end of the model is shorted with a substrate impedance, assuming no 
incoming wave. Simulation of this model has been achieved by using commercial 
RF circuit simulator, HP EESOF. Figure 13.30 shows a typical half-wavelength circuit

The SAW values generated by a Coriolis force are associated with a 3-D problem, which
contains three vectors (reference vibration vector, input rotation vector, and resulting
Coriolis vector) in three mutually perpendicular directions. Because the Coriolis force
has been approximated by a one-dimensional analogy, the secondary SAW, generated by
the Coriolis force, has also to be approximated using a one-dimensional analogy. If this

by the rotation rate (see Figure 13.33). The gyroscopes were fabricated by both the lift-
off4 and reactive ion-etching (RIE) techniques using the Pennsylvania State University
Nanofabrication facility. The lift-off technique was adequate for 75 MHz gyroscopes,
which have a minimum feature size of about 6 um.
The response of the SAW gyroscope was evaluated using a rate table. The output
response was measured using an HP dynamic signal analyzer fed by an RF lock-in ampli-
fier. The gyroscope is fixed to a rate table, which, when excited at a constant frequency,
causes the rate table to oscillate, and the gyroscope is measured for each setting. Both the
frequency and the amplitude of the driving signal controls the amplitude of oscillations
of the table, which in turn varies the rotation rate. Figure 13.33 presents the measured
and computed output voltages from the SAW gyroscope for different rotation rate.
13.5 CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this chapter, we have described some of the many sensing applications to which a SAW-
IDT microsensor may be applied. The principles that govern these IDT sensors have been
presented along with the input-output equations. The versatility of this technology is very
impressive and permits a wide variety of different sensing applications, such as strain,
pressure, temperature, conductivity, and dielectric constant.
The next chapter is dedicated to the topic of IDT-MEMS sensors that represent an
exciting development combining the fields of MEMS and SAW-IDT devices. The final
example of a SAW-IDT device is described in Section 15.2 and is associated with a type
of smart sensor called an electronic tongue. It complements the description of another
smart sensor also given in the final chapter called the electronic nose.

MEMS-IDT Microsensors
14.1 INTRODUCTION
The combination of a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) device with an interdigital
transducer (IDT) (surface acoustic wave (SAW)) microsensor is a relatively new concept.
MEMS-IDT-based microsensors can offer some significant advantages over other MEMS
devices, including the benefits of excellent sensitivity, surface conforaiability, greater
robustness, and durability. These new MEMS-IDT combinations have fewer moving
mechanical parts that ultimately gives rise to these valuable benefits. Indeed, the superior
performance removes not only the need for associated electronic circuitry to balance (or
measure) the movement of moving structures but also leads to even smaller devices.
In this chapter, we give a detailed description of the fabrication, characterisation, and
testing of MEMS-IDT microsensors for inertial navigation systems. Inertial accelerometers
generally consist of a suspended seismic mass that is displaced from its rest position under
the influence of an external load. Thus, the position of the seismic mass depends on the
momentary acceleration applied to the device. This displacement is usually transduced
into either a change in resistance (in piezoresistive accelerometers) or a change in capac-
itance (in capacitive accelerometers). Each of these two basic electrical parameters has
its own relative advantages and disadvantages: piezoresistive accelerometers tend to have
a wide frequency range, low cost, and low precision, whereas capacitive accelerome-
ters have high sensitivity but a small dynamic and frequency range. The topic of silicon
microaccelerometers has already been discussed in Chapter 8 and further details on iner-
tial devices may be found in the following references: Esashi (1994), Roylance and Angell
(1979), Rudolf etal (1987), Suzuki et al. (1990), Seidel et al. (1990), and Matsumoto
and Esashi (1992).
Conventional accelerometers incorporate a large amount of electronics within the sensor
package. They also require an internal battery to drive the associated electronics. These
requirements result in sensors that are relatively bulky and require regular maintenance.
The size of the sensors is a major drawback in applications in which the sensors need to
be conformal to the structure and should not add excessive amounts of weight.
We now provide a detailed description of two worked examples of MEMS-IDT micro-
sensors, namely, an accelerometer and a miniature inertial navigation system. The inertial
navigation system uses both gyroscopes and accelerometers to measure the state of
motion of an object (i.e. its kinematics) by sensing the changes to that state caused
by the accelerations. The characteristic features required for many applications are a
high level of precision and wide dynamic and frequency ranges. We also show that it

is possible to create a wireless MEMS-IDT microsensor in a manner similar to that was
shown as possible to make a wireless IDT microsensor in Chapter 13 (Subramanian et al.
1997).
14.2 PRINCIPLES OF A MEMS-IDT ACCELEROMETER
The Rayleigh wave is a surface wave in which the wave energy is almost completely
confined within a distance of one wavelength above the substrate (Ballantine et al. 1997).
There are basically two types of boundary conditions applicable with the surface of the
piezoelectric being mechanically free. In one form, the surface has a thin conductive layer.
This layer does not alter the mechanical boundary conditions but causes the surface to
be equipotential and the propagating potential to be zero at the surface of the substrate.
The other case is the one in which the surface is electrically free and the potential above
the surface follows Laplace's equation. The potential vanishes as the distance above the
substrate approaches infinity1.
In a MEMS-IDT accelerometer, a conductive seismic mass is placed close to the
substrate (at a distance of less than one acoustic wavelength). This serves to alter the
electrical boundary condition discussed earlier. The seismic mass can be fabricated from
polysilicon and incorporates reflectors and flexible beams (Figure 14.1).
The MEMS device functions as follows: An incoming electromagnetic wave at the
IDT creates a radio frequency electrical field between the transducer fingers. Owing to the
piezoelectric effect, mechanical deformations follow the signal and propagate along the
surface of the piezoelectric substrate. The array of reflectors sends back this wave to the
IDT. The phase of the reflected wave is dependent on the position of the reflectors. If
the position of the reflectors is altered, the phase of the reflected wave also changes. As
can be seen from the figure, the reflectors are part of the seismic mass. In response to an
acceleration, the beam flexes, causing the reflectors to move. This can be measured as a
phase shift of the reflected wave. By calibrating the phase shift measured with respect to
Figure 14.1 Basic arrangement of a MEMS-IDT accelerometer

the acceleration, the MEMS device can be used as an acceleration sensor. Alternatively,
the measurement can be done in the time domain, in which case the delay time of the
reflection from the reflectors is used to sense the acceleration.
14.3 FABRICATION OF A MEMS-IDT
ACCELEROMETER
We now illustrate the principles from the Worked Example 14.1 of a MEMS-IDT
accelerometer.
Worked Example E14.1: MEMS-IOT Accelerometer Objective:
There are three steps involved: First, a Rayleigh wave device consisting of an IDT on
a piezoelectric film is easily fabricated using conventional metal deposition or etching
techniques. These techniques are standard in integrated circuit (1C) processing and details
of SAW-IDT fabrication are provided in Chapter 12. Next, the reflector arrays can be
fabricated using silicon micromachining techniques. Finally, flip-chip bonding can be
used in order to reduce the handling of the substrate and hence maintain the performance
of the SAW substrate. The specific details are as follows (see Varadan et al.):
The substrate chosen was silicon with a ZnO coating. The IDTs were then sputtered on
the substrate. The fabrication steps involve mask preparation, lithography, and etching.
The thickness of the metal for the IDTs should be at least 200 nm to make an adequate
electrical contact. However, a very thick layer of metal can cause significant mass
loading effects and so is detrimental to the device performance. The metallisation ratio
used for the IDTs, that is, the ratio of finger width to repetition distance is 0.5. The
number of fingers of the IDT and their aperture is chosen such that the IDTs have an
impedance of nominally 50 £2. Figure 14.2 shows a cross section of the basic design
with the critical dimensions (in um).

Basic steps in the fabrication of the seismic mass
Process Flow of Seismic Mass:
The steps involved in the fabrication of the seismic mass are outlined here and involve
the sacrificial etching of silicon dioxide (see Figure 14.3)2.
1. A sacrificial oxide is thermally grown on the silicon wafer.
2. A polysilicon (structural layer) is then deposited by low-pressure chemical vapour
deposition (LPCVD) on the sacrificial layer. Polysilicon has good structural properties
and is commonly used. This structural layer is thick enough (1 um) to support itself.
The polysilicon is patterned and etched using ethylenediamine pyrocatechol (EDP).
2 Full details of lithography and etching techniques are described in earlier chapters.

3. The sacrificial layer is then etched with hydrofluoric acid (HF) to release the
seismic mass.
4. The seismic mass is now ready to be flip-chip bonded to the SAW substrate.
These steps are only one of the many possible methods of realising these structures.
After the sacrificial oxide is removed in HF, the wafers are rinsed in deionised (DI)
water and dried. The surface tension of the water under the structures tends to pull them
down to the surface of the wafer, and in some cases, causes them to stick permanently.
This problem can be avoided by using thick structural and sacrificial layers and short
structures. There are several other methods of adhesion prevention that rely on avoiding
the problem of surface tension. These include the following:
• Freeze drying (sublimation) of the final rinsing solution (DI water, t-butyl alcohol)
• Using an integrated polymer support structure during release etching and then ashing
in oxygen
• Gradually replacing acetone with photoresist, then spinning and ashing the resist
• Electrically fusing (vaporising) micromechanical support structures
14.3.1 Fabrication of the SAW Device
The SAW device consists of a piezoelectric substrate on which IDTs are deposited. The
IDTs can be sputtered through a mask or they can be etched using the lift-off technique as
described in Chapter 12. The choice of the method is dependent on the minimum feature
size to be fabricated and adhesion of the electrode metal to the piezoelectric substrate.
The fabrication of the IDTs is essentially a single mask process.
For example, in the lift-off technique, fabrication begins with standard photolitho-
graphy using standard equipment such as a wet bench, resist spinner, hot plates, and
an evaporator. The lithium niobate wafers are cleaned using acetone, isopropanol, and
trichloroethylene (in turn) at about 60°C for about 10 minutes. The wafers are then
thoroughly rinsed in DI water for about 5 minutes and subsequently heated at 125°C
(on a hot plate) for about 10 minutes to remove surface moisture. Upon cooling the
wafer on a heat sinking plate, Shipley 1813 photoresist is spin-coated (at 4000 rpm
for 55 seconds) on the wafer after soaking the top face with an adhesion agent called
hexamethyl disilazane (HMDS). The wafer is then heated at 125°C for 2 minutes in
what is commonly referred to as the soft-bake. The wafer is then exposed to ultravio-
let (UV) light (of 15 mW/cm2) for 1.2 seconds such that the regions of the resist that
are exposed become soluble to the developer (DI water and MF3 12 in a 1:1 ratio). A
negative mask, whereby the patterns are glass set against a background of chrome, is
used for this purpose. The wafer is developed until the sections that have been exposed to
UV light and therefore soluble are etched away. The wafer is then hard-baked at 125 °C
for 1 minute 30 seconds. The patterned wafer is coated with 20 nm of chromium using
electron gun evaporation, which is deposited to improve the adhesion of the subsequent
thermally evaporated 120 nm gold layer. The wafer is then submerged into acetone to
facilitate the lift-off process.

14.3.2 Integration of the SAW Device and Seismic Mass
14.3.2.1 Wafer bonding
If two wafers with surface oxide layers are immersed in sulfuric acid or nitric acid and
then brought into contact, they will stick immediately. If these wafers are subsequently
annealed at high temperature, the resulting bond can be essentially perfect. The quality of
the bond depends on the types of oxides used, the temperature, and the cleanliness of the
process. If the wafers can be annealed at 1000°C, any common (thermal, phosphosilicate
(PSG), etc.) oxide will do. Because the oxide, rather than the silicon, is involved in
the bonding, it is also possible to bond silicon to quartz or other glass substrates. This
technique is often used in what is known as a 'dissolved wafer process.' Further details
of silicon-bonding techniques may be found in Sections 5.6 and 5.7.
14.3.2.2 Incorporation of electronics into the accelerometer
When the electromagnetic signal is converted to an acoustic signal on the surface of a
piezoelectric, the initial wavelength is reduced by a factor of about 105. This results in
the dimensions of acoustic wave devices becoming compatible with IC technology. Use
of silicon substrates sputtered with piezoelectric zinc oxide instead of other piezoelectric
materials, such as lithium niobate and stable temperature (ST)-quartz, makes it feasible to
integrate electronics on the sensor substrate. This combination has the following distinct
advantages:
• Onboard signal processing and data manipulation is possible
• The need for signal amplification may be eliminated in certain cases
• Information loss by transmission is eliminated
• The overall system is miniaturised and a smart sensor is created.
However, there are some drawbacks to this approach and these are as follows:
• Production processes must be compatible with each other
• The number of production steps (mask levels) may increase, which may make the
yield low
• The contrasting demand that the electronics must be protected from the environment,
while the sensor must be exposed to the environment. This complicates the packaging
requirements
• Optimisation of the sensor and the electronics may involve conflicting requirements
14.4 TESTING OF A MEMS-IDT ACCELEROMETER
The MEMS-IDT accelerometer needs to be tested so that its design can be optimised. We
will first describe, discuss, and evaluate the measurement setup and calibration procedure

of the microsensor (Section 14.4.1–14.4.4). Then we will discuss the incorporation of a
seismic mass to produce an inertial accelerometer (Section 14.4.5).
14.4.1 Measurement Setup
The vector network analyser and associated calibration techniques make it possible to
measure accurately the reflection and transmission parameters of devices under test3.
The basic arrangement of such a measurement system is illustrated in Figure 14.4. The
network analyser system consists of a synthesized sweeper (10 MHz–20 GHz), the test set
(40 MHz-40 GHz), HP 8510B network analyzer, and a display processor. The sweeper
provides the stimulus and the test set provides the signal separation. The front panel of
the HP 8510B is used to define and conduct various measurements. The various other
instruments are also controlled by the network analyser through the system bus. The
device to be tested is connected between the test Port 1 and Port 2. The point at which

the device is connected to the test set is called the reference plane. All measurements are
made with reference to this plane. The measurements are expressed in terms of scattering
parameters referred to as 5 parameters. These describe the signal flow (Figure 14.5)
within the network.
5 parameters are defined as ratios and are represented by Sin/out, where the subscripts
in and out represent the input and output signals, respectively. Figure 14.5 shows the
energy flow in a two-port network. It can be shown that
b1 = a1S11 + a2S12 and b2 = a1S21 +

(14.1)
and, therefore,

(14.2)
where S11 and S21 (S12 and S22) are the reflection and transmission coefficients for
Port 1(2), respectively.
14.4.2 Calibration Procedure
Calibration of any measurement system is essential in order to improve the accuracy
of the system. However, accuracy is reduced because errors, which may be random or
systematic, exist in all types of measurements. Systematic errors are the most significant
source of measurement uncertainty. These errors are repeatable and can be measured by
the network analyser. Correction terms can then be computed from these measurements.
This process is known as calibration. Random errors are not repeatable and are caused
by variations due to noise, temperature, and other environmental factors that surround the
measurement system.
A series of known standards are connected to the system during calibration. The system-
atic effects are determined as the difference between the measured and the known response
of the standards. These errors can be mathematically related by solving the signal-flow
graph. The frequency response is the vector sum of all test setup variations in magni-
tude and phase with frequency. This is inclusive of signal-separation devices, test cables,
and adapters. The mathematical process of removing systematic errors is called error
correction. Ideally, with perfectly known standards, these errors should be completely
characterised. The measurement system is calibrated using the full two-port calibration

TESTING OF A MEMS-IDT ACCELEROMETER 
405
method. Four standard methods are used, namely, shielded open circuit, short circuit, load,
and through. This method provides full correction for directivity, source match, reflec-
tion and transmission signal path frequency response, load match, and isolation for S11,
S12, S21, and S22. The procedure involves taking reflection, transmission, and isolation
measurements.
For the reflection measurements (S11, S22), the open, short, and load standards are
connected to each port in turn and the frequency response is measured. These six measure-
ments result in the calculation of the reflection error coefficients for both the ports. For the
transmission measurements, the two ports are connected and the following measurements
are conducted: forward transmission through (S21 -frequency response), forward match
through (S21-load), reverse transmission through (S12-frequency response) and reverse
match through (S12-load). The transmission error coefficients are computed from these
four measurements. Loads were connected to the two ports and S21 noise floor and S12
noise floor levels were measured. From these measurements, the forward and reverse
isolation error coefficients are computed. The calibration is saved in the memory of the
network analyser and the correction function is turned on to correct systematic errors that
may occur.
14.4.3 Time Domain Measurement
The relationship between the frequency domain response and the time domain response
is given by the Fourier transform, and the response may be completely specified in
either domain. The network analyser performs measurements in the frequency domain
and then computes the inverse Fourier transform to give the time domain response. This
computation technique benefits from the wide dynamic range and the error correction of
the frequency domain data.
In the time domain, the horizontal axis represents the propagation delay through the
device. In transmission measurements, the plot displayed is the actual one-way travel time
of the impulse, whereas for reflection measurements the horizontal axis shows the two-way
travel time of the impulse. The acoustic propagation length is obtained by multiplying the
time by the speed of the acoustic wave in the medium. The peak value of the time domain
response represents an average reflection or transmission over the frequency range.
The time band pass mode of the network analyser is used for time domain analysis. It
allows any frequency domain response to be transformed to the time domain. The Hewlett
Packard (HP) 8510B network analyser has a time domain feature called windowing, which
is designed to enhance time domain measurements. Because of the limited bandwidth
of the measurement system, the transformation to the time domain is represented by a
sin(x)/x stimulus rather than the ideal stimulus. For time band pass measurements, the
frequency domain response has two cutoff points fstart and fstop. Therefore, in the time
band pass mode, the windowing function rolls off both the lower end and the higher
end of the frequency domain response. The minimum window option should be used to
minimise the filtering applied to the frequency domain data.
Because the measurements in the frequency domain are not continuous but, apart from
Af (in Hz), are taken at discrete frequency points, each time domain response is repeated
every 1/Af seconds. The amount of time defines the range of the measurement. Time
domain response resolution is defined as the ability to resolve two close responses. The

406 
MEMS-IDT MICROSENSORS
response resolution for the time band pass, using the minimum window, can be expressed
as a parameter r:
1.2
r = -— 
(14.3)
fspan
where the frequency span fspan is expressed in Hz. Thus, if a frequency span of 10 MHz
is used, the measurement system will not be able to distinguish between equal magnitude
responses separated by less than 0.12 us for transmission measurements.
Time domain range response is the ability to locate a single response in time. Range
resolution is related to the digital resolution of the time domain display, which uses the
same number of points as that of the frequency domain. The range resolution can be
computed directly from the time span and the number of points selected. If a time span
of 5 us and 201 points are used, the marker can read the location of the response with
a range resolution of 24.8 ns (5 us/201). The resolution can be improved by using more
points in the same time span.
14.4.4 Experimental
We now evaluate the suitability of using S11 measurement for the measurement of reflec-
tions in SAW delay line.
The operating principle of the device is based on the perturbation in the velocity of the
acoustic wave due to the changes in the electrical boundary conditions. The two extreme
electrical boundary conditions were applied in turn. An attempt was then made to detect
these in various measurement options that are available in the vector network analyser.
These electrical conditions represent the maximum change possible for the device designed
and hence are useful in evaluating suitability of any measurement technique. The details
of this device are given in the following paragraph. Split finger electrodes were used in
order to reduce reflections from the electrodes:
• Number of finger pairs is 10
• Propagation path length is 6944 urn
• Operating frequency is 82.91 MHz
Two devices representing the two extreme electrical boundary conditions were used:
1. A SAW delay line with split finger IDTs and with an aluminum layer in the propagation
path. This device represents the electrical boundary condition in which the electric field
is shorted on the substrate surface.
2. A SAW delay line with split finger IDTs and without an aluminum layer in the prop-
agation path. This device represents the electrical boundary condition in which the
electric field decays at an infinite distance from the substrate surface.
Both these devices have a propagation path length of 6944 urn. The SAW propagation
velocity on the substrate is 3980 m/s and the crystal size is (10 x 10) mm2. The equipment

TESTING OF A MEMS-IDT ACCELEROMETER 
407
Figure 14.6 Measurement of the S11 parameter
used for the measurement was an HP Network Analyzer Model No.8753A operating in
the range 300 kHz to 3 GHz.
The two ports are calibrated using test standards in the method described earlier.
The devices are connected in turn and the reflection coefficient (S11) was measured (see
Figure 14.6). In the S11 measurement, the wave propagates from one set of IDTs to the
other set of IDTs and the reflections due to the second set are measured at the first set.
It was also found that in the linear magnitude format, the reflection peak was more
sharply defined than the one in the log magnitude format. The measurements were trans-
formed into the time domain as the interpretation of the observations are much easier.
The gating function of the network analyser was used to filter out the electromagnetic
feed through. It also allows appropriate scaling of the desired signal.
In the case of the device with aluminum between the IDTs, the first reflection from the
IDT occurred at 3.799 us. The next peak beyond 3.799 us is the reflection from the crystal
edge. For the device without aluminum, a reflection was measured at 3.535 us. It can be
seen that for the same distance traveled, the wave velocity is greater in the case of the
device without aluminum. The time difference between these two measurements (3.535 us
and 3.799 us) is a measure of the coupling efficiency of the substrate as well as mass
loading because of the aluminum layer between the IDTs. The theoretical calculations
for this substrate leads us to expect the velocity of the wave to slow down by 136 m/s
because of the change in the electrical boundary conditions. The observed slowing down
of the wave was around 281 m/s. This difference is probably due to the mass loading
effects of the aluminum.
The results of these experiments indicate that the effect of an aluminum conductor
placed close to the surface should be seen in the region between 3.535 us and 3.799 us
in the time domain measurement of S11.
The experimental validation of the design and the concept was done in stages. The first
step in this process was to conduct an experiment to qualitatively examine the effect of
a conductor close to the surface and to devise a measurement method. The three samples
used for the experiment are described here:
1. For the gross or qualitative evaluation of the effect, it is sufficient to place a conductor
close to the surface. Three samples were prepared for this experiment. The sample
consisted of a micromachined silicon trough in which aluminum was deposited. The

408 
MEMS-IDT MICROSENSORS
Figure 14.7 Measurement of the (Sj 2) parameter
trough is 1 \im deep. Within this trough, 600 nm of aluminum was deposited. This
device allows the conductor to be placed 400 nm from the substrate.
2. This sample is the same as the one discussed earlier, except that there is a silicon
dioxide layer 1 um thick on the substrate. This sample allows the conductor to be
placed 1.4 um from the substrate.
3. The third sample is similar to the first sample. It consists of a micromachined trough
that is 1 um deep. Silicon is to serve as a conductor. This sample can be used to
evaluate the suitability of silicon as a conductor for this application.
These samples are shown in Figure 14.8. These samples are flipped over and are placed
on the substrate. They rest on spacers. The spacers lie outside the propagation path of the
Rayleigh wave. The trough was big enough such that when it was placed on the substrate,
it still left the substrate mechanically free. This can be easily tested by doing the S\2
measurement (Figure 14.7). These observations were carried out in both the frequency
and the time domain.
The following conclusions have been derived from the set of experiments mentioned
previously. The arrangement of the spacer performs adequately in the placing of the
conductor within one wavelength of the surface. Silicon instead of aluminum could be
used for this device. For this application, it can almost be considered to be a conductor.
The perturbation in the velocity of the wave is too small to be measured as a shift in the
amplitude response in both frequency and time domain with the given resolution of the
network analyser.
14.4.5 Fabrication of Seismic Mass
Following the aforementioned evaluation of the performance of the IDT microsensor, we
will now discuss the addition of a seismic mass to the wafer to produce an accelerometer.
The fabrication of a seismic mass is a two mask process. Here, the masks were designed
for the process using the commercial software package of L-Edit (Tanner Tools Inc.). A

Figure 14.8 Basic steps in the fabrication of the spacers
4" silicon wafer was chosen and four different wafers were processed, as each spacer
height requires a separate wafer.
The first step in the fabrication process was the creation of the spacer of the desired
height. The next step is the fabrication of the reflector arrays. These two stages are
described with the help of Figures 14.8 and 14.9. The basic steps in the process involve
the growth and patterning of an oxide mask, followed by dry etching of silicon by plasma.
The steps required to fabricate the spacers are as follows:
Four p-type wafers of silicon (100) of resistivity between 2 and 5 ohm.cm were used.
1. A 500 nm thick silicon dioxide is grown. This oxide layer will act as a mask for the
dry etching (Figure 14.8(a)).
2. Photoresist is spun on the oxide layer (Figure 14.8(b)). The resist is baked to improve
adhesion.
3. The first mask is aligned with respect to the flat of the wafer and the photoresist is
patterned (Figure 14.8(c)). The oxide is then etched away in all areas except where
it was protected (Figure 14.8(d)). The etching automatically stops when the etchant
reaches silicon. The etchant is highly selective and etches only silicon dioxide. The
above process of exposing and patterning the photoresist along with oxide etching is
referred to as developing.
4. Silicon is dry-etched in plasma. The four wafers are etched to different depths, namely,
100 nm, 400 nm, 1 urn, and 2 um (Figure 14.8(e)). This step results in the protected

are called spacers.
5. The wafers are cleaned and the oxide mask is then etched away. This completes the
fabrication of spacers. The view of a single device after the aforementioned steps are
completed is shown in Figure 14.8(f).
The process steps for the fabrication of reflectors are as follows:
1. A thin layer (20 nm) of silicon dioxide is grown in preparation for ion implantation
(Figure 14.9(a)). Ion implantation on the wafer before the fabrication of the reflectors
was done to make the reflectors more conductive with respect to the base of the wafer.

TESTING OF A MEMS-IDT ACCELEROMETER 
411
Ion implantation uses accelerated ions to implant the surface with the desired dopant.
This high-energy process causes damage to the surface. The implantation was done
using an LPCVD oxide in order to reduce the surface damage, as the surface planarity
of the reflector is desired (Figure 14.9(b)).
2. Boron ions are implanted into the silicon wafer at 150 keV. The concentration of the
dopant is 5 x 1015/cm2. Both the front and the back of the wafer are ion implanted.
This dosage of ions will serve to make the doped region approximately ten times more
conductive than the undoped region.
3. The wafers are then annealed to release any stress in the wafer. This is followed by
plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) of a 1 um thick oxide layer.
This oxide layer will serve as a mask for the dry etching step to follow (Figure 14.9(c)).
4. The oxide is patterned and developed as described in the fabrication of the spacers
(Figure 14.9(d)). The second mask is aligned to alignment marks that were put down
during the fabrication of the spacers. This will ensure that the spacers and the reflectors
are properly aligned with respect to each other.
5. The silicon is dry-etched in a plasma. The depth of the etch is 1 urn. This results in
the formation of 1 um thick reflectors (Figure 14.9(e)).
6. The backside of the wafer is sputtered with aluminum (0.6 um) to allow grounding of
the wafer (Figure 14.9(f)).
7. The oxide is finally stripped from the front (Figure 14.9(g)). The completed device is
shown in Figure 14.9(h).
An array consisting of 200 reflectors is placed between the two IDTs. These reflectors
cover nearly the entire space between the two IDTs. The spacer height was 100 nm. This
allows the reflectors to be placed 100 nm above the substrate on which the Rayleigh wave
propagates.
A study of this device showed the following:
1. The reflections from this set of reflectors was clearly seen in the region between 0 and
3.5 us (Figure 14.10). The reflection is about 5 dB above the reference signal. The
reflection is broadband because of the large number of reflectors in the array.
2. The purely electrical reflections are due to a suspended array of reflectors that can be
detected, validating the design concept.
3. The spacer is able to place the reflector array adequately close to the substrate, allowing
the electric field to interact with the reflectors. This is achieved without perturbing the
mechanical boundary condition.
4. The reflection from a reflector array can be easily measured using the reflection coef-
ficient (S11) measurement of the network analyser.
With this experiment, the effect of moving the reflector array has been clearly demon-
strated. In an accelerometer, this effect is due to the instantaneous acceleration sensed at
that moment. Thus, the same method can be used to measure acceleration. Now, we are
ready to build the accelerometer.

14.5 WIRELESS READOUT
The wireless accelerometer is finally created by the flip-chip bonding of the silicon seismic
mass with 200 reflectors to that of the silicon substrate with 100 nm height above the
SAW device. The IDTs are inductively connected to an onboard antenna, which is a
dipole that communicates with the interrogating antenna, as shown in Figure 14.11. The
inductive coupling permits an air gap between the SAW substrate and the antenna, which
prevents stresses on the antenna from affecting the SAW velocity. Depending on the
mounting and reader configuration, several techniques can be used to increase the gain
of this antenna. For a planar configuration, a miniature Yagi-Uda antenna can be formed
by adding a reflector and/or a director as in Figure 14.11. For a normal reader direc-
tion, a planar reflector behind the dipole can be used. In the case where the sensor
is mounted on a metal structure, the structure itself is the reflector. By increasing the
gain of the sensor antenna, the effective sensing range can be significantly increased.
For example, doubling the gain will quadruple the signal strength sent back to the
reader.
For the acceleration measurement, a simple geophone setup was used from Geospace.
Figure 14.12 illustrates the layout of a geophone. The acceleration in the geophone causes
relative motion between the coil and the magnet. This relative motion in a magnetic field
causes a voltage that can be calibrated for the acceleration measurement. The geophone
is attached to a plate on which the MEMS-IDT accelerometer is mounted. The plate is

then subjected to acceleration. The acceleration is recorded from the output voltage of
the geophone. Simultaneously, the phase shift of the SAW signal is also measured, as
described earlier. The phase shift of the acoustic wave signal is then a measure of the
acceleration of the device, and the results are plotted in Figure 14.13.
Programmable accelerometers can be achieved with split-finger IDTs as reflecting struc-
tures (Reindl and Ruile 1993). If IDTs are short-circuited or capacitively loaded, the wave
propagates without any reflection, whereas in an open circuit configuration, the IDTs
reflect the incoming SAW signal (see Figure 14.14). The programmable accelerometers
can thus be achieved by using external circuitry on a semiconductor chip using hybrid
technology.

14.6 HYBRID ACCELEROMETERS AND GYROSCOPES
The design of a MEMS device incorporating both an accelerometer and a gyroscope on
a single silicon chip is shown in Figure 14.15. It consists of
1. IDTs for generating SAW waves
2. A floating seismic mass for sensing acceleration and a perturbation mass array for
sensing the gyro motion
Again, silicon with a ZnO coating is chosen as the SAW substrate. The IDTs are sputtered
on the substrate. The fabrication steps involve mask preparation, lithography, and etching.
The thickness of the metal for the IDTs should again be at least 200 nm in order to make
adequate electrical contact. The metallisation ratio for the IDTs is still 0.5.
The fabrication of the seismic mass is again realised by the sacrificial etching of silicon
dioxide. The steps involved are as follows:

1. A sacrificial oxide is thermally grown on a second silicon wafer.
2. A polysilicon (structural layer) is then deposited by LPCVD on the sacrificial layer.
The polysilicon is patterned to form the seismic mass and etched with EDP.
3. The perturbation mass array for gyro sensing is deposited on this seismic mass.
4. The sacrificial layer is then etched with HF to finally release the seismic mass and the
perturbation mass array.
5. The seismic mass is then flip-chip bonded to the SAW silicon substrate.
The floating reflectors (seismic mass) can move relative to the substrate, and this displace-
ment is proportional to the acceleration of the body to which the substrate is attached.
This displacement is then measured as a phase difference of the reflected acoustic wave,
which can be calibrated to measure the acceleration. This phase shift can be detected at
the accelerometer sensor port of the device. It should also be noted that the strategically
positioned metallic mass arrays on the underside of the seismic mass would change the
coupling between the SAW at the Gyro sensor port because of the rotation and Coriolis
force generation. This is sensed as the rate information for the gyroscope. When the elec-
tromagnetic signal is converted to an acoustic signal on the surface of a piezoelectric, the
wavelength is reduced by a factor of 105. This allows the dimensions of acoustic wave
devices to be compatible with IC technology.
The main advantages of a single device for the measurement of both angular rate and
acceleration is the reduction in power requirements, signal-processing electronics, weight,

416 
MEMS-IDT MICROSENSORS
and overall cost. These advantages are also important for its use in many commercial,
military, and space applications. Thus, it has a number of advantages over the tuning
fork and ring microgyroscopes, which were described in Chapter 8. Indeed, this type
of MEMS-IDT device could revolutionise the MEMS industry with widespread applica-
tion, for example, in geostationary positioning system (GPS), guidance systems, industrial
platform stabilisation, tilt and shock sensing, motion-sensing in robotics, vibration moni-
toring, automotive vehicle navigation, automatic braking systems ABS, antiskid control,
active suspension, integrated vehicle dynamics, three-dimensional mouse, head-mounted
display, gaming, and medical products (wheel chairs, body movement monitoring).
14.7 CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this chapter, we have introduced the concept of combining a micromachined mechanical
structure with an DDT microsensor to make a so-called MEMS-IDT microsensor. Accord-
ingly, we have shown how to fabricate a MEMS-IDT accelerometer and gyroscope. This
type of MEMS device is particularly attractive because it offers the possibility of a simple
wireless and batteryless mode of operation. Such sensing devices will be needed in a wide
variety of future applications from military through to the remote interrogation of surgical
implants.

15.1 INTRODUCTION
The adjective 'smart' is widely used in science and technology today to describe many
different types of artefacts. Its meaning varies according to its particular use. For example,
there is a widespread use of the term smart material, although functional material is also
used and may be a more accurate description. A smart material may be regarded as
an 'active' material in the sense that it is being used for more than just its structural
properties. The latter is normally referred to as a passive material but could, perhaps,
be called a dumb material. The classical example of a so-called smart material is a
shape memory alloy (SMA), such as NiTi. This material undergoes a change from its
martensitic to austenitic crystalline phase and back when thermally cycled. The associated
volumetric change induces a stress and so this type of material can be used in various
types of microactuator and microelectromechanical system (MEMS) devices (Tsuchiya
and Davies 1998). Another example of a smart material is a magnetostrictive one, which
is a material that changes its length under the influence of an external magnetic field.
This type of smart material can be used to make, for example, a strain gauge as provided
in the Worked Example 8.2 in Chapter 8 on Microsensors.
The term smart is also applied in the field of structures. However, a smart structure is,
in general, neither a small structure nor one made of silicon. In this case, as we shall see
later on, the term really implies a form of intelligence and is applied to civil buildings
and bridges (Gandhi and Thompson 1992). A classic example of a smart structure is
that of a building that contains a number of motion sensors together with an active
damping system. Therefore, the building can respond to changes in its environment (e.g.
wind loading) and modify its mechanical response appropriately (e.g. through its variable
damping coefficient). Perhaps, a more familiar way that engineers would describe this
type of structure is one with a closed-loop control system (Bissell 1994).
In this chapter, we are interested, specifically, in the topic of smart devices rather than
either smart materials or smart structures. Readers interested in these other topics are
referred to a book on 'Smart Materials and Structures' (Culshaw 1996). The term smart
sensor was first coined in the 1980s by electrical engineers and became associated with
the integration of a silicon sensor with its associated microelectronic circuitry. Figure 15.1
shows the basic concept of a smart sensor in which a silicon sensor or microsensor (i.e.
integrated sensor) is integrated with either a part or all of its associated processing elements
(i.e. the preprocessor and/or the main processing unit). These devices are referred to here,
for convenience, as smart sensor types I and II. For example, a silicon thermodiode could

for one or more of the elements
be integrated with a constant current circuit to make a simple three-terminal voltage
supply (+5 V DC), ground and output (0 to 5 V DC) smart device. Of course, this is a
trivial example and barely deserves the title of smart; nowadays, the term tends to imply
a higher degree of integration, such as the integration of an eight-bit microcontroller
or microprocessor. This would be referred to here as a type II smart sensor. When the
technologies and processes employed to make the microsensor are incompatible with the
microprocessor, it is possible to make a hybrid rather than a true smart chip, as described
earlier in Chapter 4. In this case, the term smart is sometimes used in a less formal sense,
but hybrid would be a more accurate term.
The integration of part (type I) or all (type II) of the processing element with the
microsensor in order to create a smart sensor is highly desirable when one or more of the
following conditions are met:
• Integration reduces the unit manufacturing cost of the device.
• Integration substantially enhances the performance.
• The device would not work at all without integration.
These prerequisites make integration feasible when there is either a large potential market
(i.e. millions or more units per year) demanding that the unit cost be kept low, or there is
a specialised 'added value' market that can absorb the higher unit costs associated with
smaller chip runs. Sometimes, these so-called market drivers are combined to define a
performance-price (PP) indicator. This concept was introduced in Chapter 1 in which it
was shown that there has been an enormous increase in the PP indicator during the past
20 years - first with silicon sensors (i.e. microsensors) and then with smart sensors.
The successful commercialisation of pressure and other smart sensors (see the following
text) has led to a whole host of other types of smart devices, such as smart actuators,
smart interfaces, and so on. Figure 15.2 gives a schematic representation of both a smart
actuator and a smart microsystem. Of course, a MEMS device is one type of smart

Some examples of these are given later.
Table 15.1 summarises the different uses of the term smart of today together with its
meaning and an example of such a material, device, or other artefact.
Finally, we must draw a distinction between a smart device and an intelligent device.
To the average person, the term smartness suggests a high level of intelligence rather than
a high level of chip integration. Yet, there are a number of researchers who have used
the term intelligent instrument to be one in which a microprocessor is used to control a
piece of equipment (Barney 1985; Ohba 1992). For example, they would regard a large
drilling machine controlled by a microprocessor as an intelligent instrument. This is quite
different from the meaning of intelligence used by either cognitive scientists or, probably,

420
SMART SENSORS AND MEMS
the average person. Clearly, the term intelligent is a relative one, and so here we prefer
to consider intelligence associated more with functionality than form, thus differentiating
its usage from the term smart. This is consistent with an early definition of intelligent
sensors proposed by Breckenbridge and Husson (1978):
'The sensor itself has a data processing Junction and automatic compensation function, in
which the sensor detects and eliminates abnormal values or exceptional values. It incorpo-
rates an algorithm, which is capable of being altered, and has a certain degree of memory
function. Further desirable characteristics are that the sensor is coupled to other sensors,
adapts to changes in environmental conditions, and has a discrimination function.'
Nowadays, many of these so-called intelligent features are incorporated into smart sensors.
So, this early definition of Breckenbridge and Husson (1978) can be updated by drawing
upon more recent ideas published by others, such as Brignell and White (1994). The
different possible forms (or classes) of an intelligent sensor are provided in Table 15.2,
together with a working definition and an example of such a device.
The meaning of the term intelligent appears to be changing with time and it is generally
used to describe a new device that is demonstrably superior in performance to those
existing currently. Thus, the meaning of the word itself is subjective and evolving (or
adapting) over the course of time. Consequently, the ability of a device simply to respond
to its changing environment (e.g. temperature compensation) appears to be of relatively
low level of intelligence today and hardly deserves the title. Instead, we tend to compare
the intelligence of a device with the workings of a biological organism. Consequently,
intelligent devices may now have embedded artificial intelligence algorithms, such as
artificial neural networks (Fausett 1994) or expert systems (Sell 1986). These algorithms
imbue the devices with humanlike features, such as fault-tolerance, adaptive learning, and
complex decision making.

15.2 SMART SENSORS
There are many different types of smart sensor today, as defined by a microsensor that
has had part, or all, of its processing unit integrated with it. We have already described in
this book a number of different silicon micromachined sensors, and some of these possess
on-chip (integrated) electronics, and so could merit the title of smart sensor. Here, we
will describe some different examples of smart sensors and thus demonstrate some of the
reasons for making smart sensors.
The most successful types of microsensors today are those that have been developed
for the high-volume automotive industry. An important class is the silicon-based pressure
sensors employed to measure manifold, barometric, exhaust gas, fuel, tyre, hydraulics,
and climate control pressure (Section 8.4.5). The current market alone is estimated to be
worth more than 750 million euros. The market for silicon pressure sensors is, perhaps,
the most mature, and since it involves many different manufacturers, it has become very
competitive. Consequently, there has been an enormous effort in recent years toward
both cost reduction and added functionality of these devices through the integration of
many processing functions onto a single chip. For example, Figure 15.3 shows the layout
of a bulk micromachined pressure sensor with its analogue custom interface, eight-bit

SMART SENSORS AND MEMS
analogue-to-digital converter, microprocessor unit (Motorola 68HC05), and the memory
and serial port interface (SPI) in a single package (Frank 1996).
Front-side bulk silicon micromachining is now available with integrated complementary
metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics. So, much of the CMOS circuitry can be
integrated either before the CMOS process (pre-CMOS) or after the CMOS process (post-
CMOS). In this way, it is possible to import the latest microprocessor dye and miniaturise
the silicon chip still further.
The silicon pressure sensors available today not only cost a few euros but also have
fewer connectors and so have enhanced their 'smartness.' Worked Example (6.8) has been
presented in an earlier chapter and describes the integration of a capacitive pressure sensor
with a local digital readout. The reduction of the pad count may seem trivial but is not
since much of the cost to manufacture a chip is associated with its area (and so number
of pads) and packaging requirements (wire/tab bonding).
The same incremental improvement in the other major type of smart automotive
sensor - the microaccelerometer (Section 8.4.6) - has also been observed in recent years.
The current US market is worth some 250 million euro and uses smart microaccelero-
meters in air bag, automatic braking, and suspension systems. For example, major
manufacturers, such as Motorola, Analog Devices, Lucas NovaSensor and Bosch, make
increasingly smart microaccelerometers with intelligent features.
• Damping and overload protection (fault-tolerance)
• Compensation for ambient temperature (e.g. –40 to +80 °C)
• Self-testing for fault-diagnostics
Figure 15.4 shows an interim two-chip solution to an accelerometer with the g-cell
having a self-test facility and separate interface integrated circuits (ICs) (Frank 1996).

This solution provides both a shorter design cycle and lower initial cost for the sensor.
Of course, larger price-driven markets favour a one-chip solution. The self-test feature
provides a certain level of intelligence and is important in applications in which sensor
failure is regarded as safety-critical.
Several books have been published on the topic of smart sensors, and automotive
sensors feature strongly in many of them. Interested readers are referred to recent books
by Chapman (1996), Frank (1996), Madou (1997) and van der Horn and Huijing (1998).
Another type of smart sensor is one that requires the integration of its associated
electronics for functional rather than cost reasons. The most obvious case of this is the
charge coupled device (CCD) array device. In a CCD, there is a large number of identical
silicon elements (e.g. 1024 pixels1) that sense the level of light falling on them and
because of their small size, produce a relatively low strength of signal. Consequently,
on-chip electronics are needed to measure, first of all, the very small amounts of charge
located on each silicon element and, secondly, this charge on a large number of identical
elements in the array (e.g. 1 million).
Figure 15.5(a) shows a photograph of a commercial colour frame-transfer CCD image
sensor (FXA1012 Philips) that is used in a CCD camera. The smart chip has two million
active pixels. The integrated electronics use shift registers to output the light levels and
then convert the signal to a standard format, for example, a data rate of up to 25 MHz
and 5 frames per second. These chips are then used in various consumer electronic
items, for example, digital cameras, videos, and so forth. Digital cameras are now manu-
factured in large quantities for a variety of applications, from security surveillance to
robot vision2. The low-cost end of the market with low-resolution black and white chips
(~100 euros) has now expanded enormously with the advent of cameras attached to
the personal computer (PC) - the so-called web camera - that are rapidly becoming in
common use in many offices and homes (Figure 15.5(b)).
Table 15.3 lists some commercially available optical CCD chips and some low-cost
web cameras for PC mounting with an integrated digital serial (RS-232) or, increasingly,
universal serial bus (USB) interface.
The latest and, perhaps, smartest type of optical array sensor being made today is the
silicon retina. In this device, a large number of optical elements (pixels) are configured
in an axisymmetric geometry to create a silicon eye (see Figure 15.5(c)). This geometry
does not fit well with the rectilinear design rules used to layout most silicon chips but is
an interesting concept and permits radially based pattern-recognition (PARC) algorithms.
Another smart sensor is the so-called electronic nose (Gardner and Bartlett 1999). An
electronic nose has been defined by Gardner and Bartlett (1994) as follows:
"An electronic nose is an instrument, which comprises an array of electronic chemical
sensors with partial specificity and an appropriate pattern-recognition system, capable of
recognising simple or complex odours'
The electronic nose first aroused serious attention in the early 1980s with the first
commercial versions beginning to appear in the mid-1990s. Figure 15.6 shows the basic
architecture of an electronic nose in which an unknown complex odour j has a set
of different odour concentrations cj and these are detected by an array of n nonspecific
1 A pixel is a 'picture element.'
2 The topic of robot vision is well established and is described by Pugh (1986).

Basic architecture of an electronic nose. From Gardner and Bartlett (1999)
sensors (Gardner and Bartlett 1999). The signals from this sensor array are then processed
through a number of stages via associated analogue and digital electronic circuitry before
sophisticated algorithms classify the odour in a PARC system.
Figure 15.7 shows one of the first commercial electronic nose systems called the Fox
20003 and manufactured by Alpha MOS (France). It uses an array of the Taguchi-type
resistive gas sensor described in Chapter 8. A modified unit has been applied recently
to the problem of identifying an algae bloom called cyanobacteria from its odorous
headspace. This bloom is found in lakes and reservoirs and can produce toxins that are a
hazard to the health of both cattle and humans (Shin 1999). The electronic nose was used
to analyse the headspace of both a toxin-producing strain and a nontoxin-producing strain
of cyanobacteria. The output from the multidimensional array is shown as a principal
components plot and a clear separation is observed between the two strains (i.e. PCC
7806 and 7941).
Today, there are more than 10 companies making electronic nose instruments that range
from handheld units costing 8000 euros to large bench-top instruments costing more than
100000 euros. Table 15.4 lists some of these commercial e-noses together with the type
of sensors employed.
The most recent (1999) launch is a handheld electronic nose by Cyrano Sciences (USA)
that incorporates an array of 32 carbon-polymer composite resistive sensors on a hybrid
sensor substrate (Figure 15.8). The black polymer materials (dots on substrate) were first
developed at Caltech and then the technology was transferred to Cyrano. A stand-alone
unit costs around 8000 euros and is used to identify unknown odours or vapours.
Possibly, the most advanced smart e-nose is that reported by Baltes and Brand (2000)
that uses CMOS technology to fabricate arrays of chemical microsensors and to integrate
the associated electronics. Figure 15.9 shows two examples of CMOS chemical sensors.
The first is an array of polymer-coated capacitors with integrated CMOS electronics,
whereas the second shows two cantilever beams with a piezoresistive pickup element.
The cantilever beams are coated with different vapour-absorbing polymer coatings, and
the deflections are calibrated against known compounds such as n-octane, ethanol, and

materials is that the chip is both CMOS-compatible and requires low power.
For some applications, metal oxide materials are often appropriate and these require
a high operating temperature (above 300 °C). Work on silicon micromachined hotplates
has akeady been discussed in the section on Chemical Sensors in Chapter 8, and these
have been used to fabricate low-power resistive gas sensors for electronic noses (Pike

1996; Pike and Gardner 1998). However, these cannot be readily integrated with the
electronics to make a smart sensor. An alternative approach, proposed by Udrea and
Gardner, is to use silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology to make gas and odour sensors
(Udrea and Gardner 1998). Figure 15.10 shows the basic principle of using a field-effect
transistor (FET) microheater and SOI membrane to form a low-power platform with an
integrated thermal management system. Multiple trench isolation can be used to reduce
the heat lost by conduction through the SOI membrane. Simulations suggest that a p-type
metal oxide semiconductor (p-MOS) FET heater permits higher operating temperatures
(about 50°C more) than an n-type metal oxide semiconductor (n-MOS) heater. Recent
simulations have shown that temperatures of 350°C are achievable with a FET heater

SMART SENSORS AND MEMS
Much of the research effort in the field of electronic noses today is directed toward
making smaller, smarter, and more intelligent units. Some success has been achieved
through the use of artificial neural networks (Gardner and Hines 1996) and, more recently,
dynamical signal-processing techniques (Hines et al. 1999). These algorithms are required
to overcome some of the undesirable problems that gas sensors currently tend to suffer
from, such as
• Long-term drift in the baseline (in air) sensor signal
• Sensitivity to variations in ambient temperature and humidity
• Poisoning of the sensors by airborne contaminants (e.g. silicones, sulphur based
compounds etc.)
These problems are not trivial and are a real issue in the practical application of elec-
tronic nose technology today. As mentioned earlier, researchers are increasingly applying
methods employed by the human system to solve the problems encountered in sensors

various parts of the human olfactory system

today - especially in the field of environmental monitoring. For example, Pearce and
Gardner have proposed a neuromorphic analogue, a very large-scale integration (VLSI)
chip (Figure 15.11) that mimics the functions of the olfactory epithelium and cortex. The
silicon microchannel mimics the mucous coating of the olfactory epithelium, whereas
ChemFETs (Chapter 8) are used to represent the olfactory cells. Integrate-and-fire elements
are well known in the field of analogue VLSI and are used here to generate a spike train
(cf. action potentials) and then the equivalent of the olfactory bulb. Although it is imprac-
tical today to emulate the 100 million olfactory neurones present in the entire human
olfactory bulb, chips such as this, with added intelligence, help researchers to solve the
complex odour classification problems faced.
There have already been reports of some silicon implementations of biological neurones
in the field of analogue VLSI. Moreover, there are also some commercial products such
as the Motorola MCI4315 Neuron™ chip (Frank 1996). This chip is a communications
and control processor with embedded LonTalk protocol for multimedia networking envi-
ronments (Figure 15.12). To date, neither analogue VLSI chips nor neuronal chips have
yielded the increase in processing speed envisaged originally. Moreover, because a single
neurone comprises several transistors and capacitors, the need for relatively large areas
of silicon has so far limited their exploitation because of the high production cost.

Frank (1996)

432
SMART SENSORS AND MEMS
Nevertheless, there are many areas in which the process speed can be sacrificed for
functionality and thus provide a role for VLSI chips.
Communication is an important aspect of smart sensors, and different types of interfaces
have been integrated, ranging from a simple single port to J2058 (Chrysler, US), CAN
(Bosch, Germany), A-Bus (Volkswagen AG, Germany), D2B (Philips, Netherlands) and
Mi-Bus (Motorola, US) in the automotive industries. Interested readers are referred to
Frank (1996) for a discussion of this topic.
For smart sensors, the most important development is likely to be wireless communi-
cations in which a radio frequency (RF) signal is used to both sense and communicate
with other devices. Figure 15.13 shows the wide variety of applications of RF in the auto-
motive industry covering the frequency range from 20 MHz to 100 GHz. The single most
important one, probably, is the vehicle navigation and warning system (VNAW) based
on geostationary positioning system (GPS) from satellite links and miniature gyroscopes
and microaccelerators. Readers interested in silicon micromachined inertial devices are
referred to Chapter 8.
One other example of a smart sensor employing wireless communication is the wireless
IDT SAW device described in an earlier chapter. Figure 15.14(a) shows the basic arrange-
ment of a passive interdigital transducer-surface acoustic waves (IDT-SAWs) sensor with
an integrated antenna. The acoustic waves are excited by an RF pulse, which is then
reflected back and the antenna transmits a return signal. This basic idea is being put to
use to create a 'smart tongue' - that is, an electronic device that mimics the human sense
of taste (Varadan and Gardner 1999). Figure 15.14(b) shows the classification of different
liquids in terms of the relative amplitude and phase of the acoustic waves in a Love wave

IDT sensor.4 The device may be regarded as an 'electronic tongue' because the sweetness
(sugar level) and saltiness (ion concentration) will affect the electrical conductivity and
dielectric permittivity of the liquid, whereas the mouth feel and, possibly, the freshness
will relate to the viscoelasticity of the liquid. The use of a second Love wave can help to
improve the discrimination process by removing (screening out) the effects of electrical
coupling from the measurement system. The advantage of this type of liquid sensor is that
it does not require a biological coating but relies upon a physical principle. This greatly
enhances the lifetime of the sensor, although its specificity is clearly reduced. However,
we think that the low cost and rapid response makes the development of a passive wireless
smart tongue extremely attractive.

Silicon micromachining techniques are used to fabricate various micromechanical struc-
tures and many of these form micromechanical actuators. Throughout this book, we have
described a large number of different types of microactuators and some of these are,
perhaps, rather loosely referred to as MEMS devices. Table 15.5 lists some of the different
types of microactuators and MEMS described in the worked examples (WE) in this book.
A more comprehensive list of micromechanical structures is provided in the following
Table (15.6) and has been taken from Frank (1996). These include microvalves, microp-
umps, microgears, and so on.
MEMS devices can be considered as smart devices because they integrate sensors with
actuators (i.e. a smart microsystem), but the degree of integration can vary significantly.
There are many different types of MEMS devices being made today, but two of the most
exciting ones are used in optical and chemical instrumentation. The former is sometimes
referred to as microoptoelectromechanical system (MOEMS), and this is being driven
by the optical telecommunications and biotechnology industries. One example shown
in Figure 15.15 is a picture of an adaptive mirror IC. This array device permits the
electronic correction of an optical system in an adaptive manner. Clearly, the ability to

focusing, beam direction and so forth.
A second example of a smart optical MEMS chip is a visible light microspectrom-
eter based on a monolithic dielectric slab waveguide with monolithic integrated focusing
echelle grating produced by a micromoulding process, as in Figure 15.16. The spectrum
is generated by coupling the light through a silica fibre into a three-layer waveguide. The
light is split by a self focussing reflection grating (d = 0.2 urn, g = 2 um) with 625 lines
per mm, and the different wavelengths are read out by a 256-element photodiode array.
The device is small and has a wavelength reproducibility better than 0.1 nm. Measuring
wavelength content is important in many sensing applications, from security labeling
through to biological assays.
In the chemical analytical instrumentation area, Stanford reported the first silicon micro-
machined gas chromatography system as early as 1974. Figure 15.17(a) shows the basic
layout of a gas chromatography system (Madou 1997) in which a gaseous sample is
made to travel along a long capillary column. The various components in the sample
have different retention times within the column and so appear at the far end as indi-
vidual compounds. The chemical components are detected using, for example, a flame
ionisation detector and the peak is identified according to known retention times. Both
the capillary column and detector cavity has been mieromachined. Figure 15.17(b) shows
a minigas system, manufactured by MTI, which is a chromatograph that is essentially
portable and so suitable for remote fieldwork.

tesy of MicroParts, Germany)
Efforts have also been made to make another miniature analytical chemical instru-
ment, namely, the mass spectrometer. This instrument ionises the molecules after they
have passed through an orifice and then separates the masses out in a mass filter by
deflecting their motion with a quadrupole electrostatic or any other type of lens. Finally,
the abundance of mass ions are measured using an ion detector (Figure 15.18(a) from
Friedhoff et al. (1999)). Figure 15.18(b) shows a plot of the mass content of the headspace
above a bacteria hazardous to human health, Escherichia coli, in two of its growth phases
(Esteves de Matos et al. 2000). The measurements were taken with a conventional Agilent
Technologies quadrupole mass spectrometer 4440. The difference between these mass
spectrograms shows up when a pattern analysis technique, such as principal components

analysis or a neural network, is applied to the data. Thus, the growth phase of the bacteria
can be identified and hence its response to antibiotics can be predicted. In fact, the Agilent
4440 system may be regarded as an 'intelligent instrument' because it couples the mass
spectrometer together with sophisticated PARC software.
Conventional quadrupole mass spectrometers (e.g. Agilent Technologies Inc.) sell for
20 000 euros, are heavy (>50 kg), consume considerable power (> 1 kW), and so there is a

considerable demand for smaller, lighter, and portable units. Miniature mass spectrometers
can be made using conventional precision machining techniques, but there have been
recent efforts to make one using silicon micromachining techniques. Figure 15.19(a)
shows an arrangement of a quadrupole lens employing silicon micromachined parts
(Friedhoff et al. 1999). An optical microscopic view of the cross section is shown
in Figure 15.19(b) (Syms et al. 1996). Making a complete silicon version is not
straightforward because the device requires a good uniform field and vacuum. However, a
unit that analyses a small mass range (up to 40 daltons) has been demonstrated successfully
by Friedhoff et al. (1999) (Figure 15.19(c)), and further advances are expected shortly
on ion sources and detectors. Biotechnology companies, such as Sequenome (USA),
are developing MassArray™ chips to screen genetic defects called single nucleotide

polymorphisms (SNPs). These require a mass spectrometer capable of detecting masses
in the range of 5000 to 9000 daltons, and work is underway in DARPA (USA).
The advantages of carrying out chemical analysis and (bio)chemical reactions are
primarily
• Small, portable, low-power units
• Small amounts of chemical reagents are required (microlitres or less)
• Rapid screening of multiple experiments (assay microarray chips)
The last reason is, probably, the most compelling, namely, that it is possible to perform
hundreds, thousands, and, possibly, millions of (bio)chemical reactions on a single wafer,
and thus the cost can be low for a large number of trials. This is essential in the
rapidly emerging fields of genomics, proteomics, and pharmacogenomics. For example,
Figure 15.20(a) shows the basic arrangement of a DNA probe. Here, light is shone on
the elements and the observation of the activation of fluorescent markers permits the
identification of the presence of certain genes. Figure 15.20(b) shows the biochip made
using a 0.8 (im CMOS process with 128 DNA probes. The chip can be used in clinical
diagnostics, for example, in screening for cancer.
There are now a plethora of emerging technologies and products in the Bio-MEMS
area, and most of these do not involve silicon but use glass and polymers. These must
tackle the problems of sample preparation, sample movement, and readout when potential
is required to detect hundreds of thousands of genetic defects or SNPs. For example,
disposable microtitration plates with a capillary fill of 96 reaction wells are now being
manufactured by MicroParts in Germany (Figure 15.21), and when coupled with off-
chip optical readout, they can be used to screen drugs (pharmacogenomics). There is
also a rapid development in the area of a Lab-on-a-chip - a microfluidic chip to perform
microbiology - that is to grow bacteria in microcells, challenge antibiotics, and analyse
on-chip and various other Bio-MEMS chips such as Nanogen™, which is an APEX chip
system, Spectrochip™, which is a microarray assay chip, and e-Sensor Systems (Motorola),
which is a clinical microsensor. Such diagnostic Bio-MEMS chips permit rapid bacterial
identification and antibody susceptibility.
In a related method, the use of combinatorial analysis makes it possible to try out, liter-
ally, millions of different chemical reactions on a single chip, and so help in synthesizing
new compounds in a type of rapid prototyping.
Therefore, the rapid screening of biochemical reactions, identification of genetic
defects, and testing of new drugs with a biochip are exciting prospects for smart MEMS
devices. Such developments could revolutionise the field of medicine because it may be
possible to individualise drug therapy; in other words, the rapid screening of people in
clinics (and, perhaps, eventually at home) will result in the tailoring of both the choice
of drug and its quantity delivered to them. It is essential when you consider the natural
diversity in the response of individuals to both pathogenic agents and drug therapies. A
medical advance like this should improve the targeting of drugs and, thereby, reduce the
time for patient recovery. In addition, there are other medical applications of MEMS in
surgery to enhance manipulators and catheters for better minimum access intervention
(i.e. keyhole surgery) in smart drug delivery systems to control dosage, and in human
implants to replace and augment body parts (e.g. cochlea, heart valves, pacemakers).

15.4 CONCLUDING REMARKS
This chapter has described some of the recent advances in silicon micromachining tech-
niques that seek to integrate the processor electronics with the sensor and actuators.
These so-called smart sensors and MEMS are becoming increasingly sophisticated as the
power of the processing unit increases from that provided by a simple eight-bit micro-
controller (e.g. a 6805) through CISC technology (68 000-based) to RISC and digital
signal-processing (DSP) technologies. It is now possible to perform on-chip a lot of intel-
ligent features such as self-testing, fault-diagnostics, and adaptive control. Furthermore,
there has been an increased use of artificial intelligence on sensors with the incorporation
of artificial neural networks, expert systems, and fuzzy logic. Fuzzy controller ICs are
already used today, for example, in buildings to operate lifts - we are just not aware
of them!
Looking to the future, it seems that there are two areas that will develop further. The
first is that we will be able to make increasingly sophisticated micromachines that parallel
the human senses, such as the microgrippers, micronoses, microtongues etc. presented in
this book. The second area is the way in which we communicate with these microdevices
and especially micromachines, such as microrobots, microcars, and microplanes (Fujimasa
1996). The human-machine interface will probably become a limiting step and there will be
a need to communicate remotely, perhaps via speech, with these intelligent micromachines.
Perhaps, we will even see the day in which we implant these microdevices in our own body
to augment our own limited senses, that is, we could have infrared (or night) vision, detect
poisonous and toxic biological agents, and feel magnetic or electric fields. We could also have
speech translators implanted in our ears, and so understand foreign languages, and, perhaps,
attach devices that monitor our health and automatically warn us of imminent problems. It

is hard to say how rapidly the development of technology will take us in the next few years.
Let us hope that it is beneficial to our quality of life and is not misused.

I1 THE COMPLEX RECIPROCITY RELATION
The propagation of waves in a waveguide structure, such as the SAW substrate, with
a thin film overlay can be accomplished using the technique of modal analysis. Any
waveguide can support the propagation of an infinite number of solutions, or waveguide
modes. As long as the set of modes is mathematically complete, any function can then
be expressed as an infinite sum of these waveguide modes. Modal analysis also requires
that the individual modes must be orthogonal, just as the sine and cosine functions in
Fourier analysis are orthogonal. The proof of orthogonality requires the derivation of the
complex reciprocity relation. The quasi-static and electromagnetic field equations needed
derive the reciprocity. If an acoustic force vector F is included, the tensor equation given
in Chapter 10 may now be written as follows
Tij.j = pui - Fi, 
(I.1)
and
T
ij = Cijkluk,l + 
eijk<t>,k 
(I.2)
Another necessary equation is the time derivative of the electrical displacement equation
Di = eikluk,l - £ij<l>j 
(I.3)
A second solution to the equations can be denoted by primed field quantities
(T', u', f', . . .) and the complex conjugate of the field equations can be written
(I.5)
(I.6)

468 
APPENDIX I: COMPLEX RECIPROCITY RELATION AND PERTURBATION ANALYSIS
If Equations (I.l),(I.2) and (I.3) are multiplied by u*, u*j and —0 * added, then we have
Tijju',* + Tijufj - Drf*
' 
(1.7)
Similarly, Equations (I.4),(I.5) (I.6) can be multiplied by ui, ui,j and — <£,/ added to give
(I.8)
In a lossless material, the material constant matrices are real and symmetric and therefore
satisfy the relations,
P = P*, 
Cijkl 
=Cklij, 
Sij = e*ij 
and eijk - e*kij
Under these conditions, Equations (I.7) and (I.8) can be added to get
(I.9)
Tijju'i* + T^UIJ + T^jiii } =
+TUij - D.-0J - D'fa \
(I.10)
By combining various derivative terms, it is possible to rewrite the preceding equation as
+
- F'*Ui
(I.11)
In order to take into account an electrical forcing function, it can be assumed that some
free charge distribution (q) is present. The equation Di,i = q simply describes Gauss's
Law. This can be brought into the equation preceding by presenting equation in the
following form:
(I. 12)

The preceding equation is known as complex reciprocity relation.
On the right-hand side of the Equation (I.14), each of the term inside the parentheses
contains the product of a conjugated function with a nonconjugated function. Because the
functional form of eia>t is assumed in modal analysis, any term of the form A * B will
have no time dependence (e-J
wrgV^f = 1); therefore, the derivative term will be zero.
The complex reciprocity relation for el(at variations is then reduced to
t'? + F'fui + 40'* + q*<t>\ 
(I.15)
I2 PERTURBATION THEORY
The perturbation analysis begins with the complex reciprocity relation with the added
assumption that no sources (body force or charge density variations) are present within
the substrate.
The unperturbed structure that will be analysed is shown in Chapter 10, Figure 10.3. The
semi-infinite piezoelectric slab extends to infinity in the ± x1 and ± x2 and — x3 directions.
The electromagnetic quantities extend out of the substrate into vacuum that extends to
infinity in the +x3 direction. The field quantities are independent of X2 and propagation is
in the +x1 direction. Under these conditions, all j = 2 terms in Equation (I.16) are zero
and integration with respect to x3 can be performed across the substrate resulting in
/

/ —T*i'j' —

> +
The unprimed quantities represent the unperturbed field quantities in the bare substrate,
whereas the primed quantities will represent the perturbed field quantities in the layered
structure. The unperturbed quantities have the functional form ejkxl because the substrate
is lossless, and the perturbed quantities vary as ejk'xl. If Ak is defined as
Ak = k' - k,

470 
APPENDIX I: COMPLEX RECIPROCITY RELATION AND PERTURBATION ANALYSIS
then Equation (I.17) becomes
or
J I''
f ^(-
./-oo dxj
In order to calculate the change in the propagation constant Ak, using Equation (I.19),
it is necessary to know the perturbed field distributions. Without this knowledge, it is
necessary to make several approximations to simplify the analysis. The first approximation
can be made by replacing the perturbed quantities in the denominator with unperturbed
quantities - because the perturbation is small. The denominator can then be simplified
using the power flow equation for piezoelectric media that is given by
1 
r0
= -Re / 
(-TnuJ
*• 
J -00
+ Dfad*3 
(I.20)
where P is the average power flow in the x\ direction per unit width. Because the real
part of any complex variable x can be calculated using
Re(jc) = 
(I.21)
Equation (I.20) can be written as
(I.22)
The assumption that all quantities in the denominator are unperturbed quantities allows
Equation (I. 10) to be written as
(I.23)
4P
The next assumption that greatly simplifies the calculation of Equation (I.23) is that small
mechanical and electrical perturbations are independent and can therefore be calculated
separately. For mechanical boundary perturbations, the electrical boundary conditions are
assumed to be unperturbed, and for electrical boundary perturbations, the mechanical
boundary conditions are considered unperturbed. When both types of boundary perturba-
tions are present, the perturbations are calculated separately and added.
When perturbation involves only mechanical effects, the last two terms in the numerator
of Equation (I.23) are ignored. In addition, unperturbed situation includes a stress free
surface at x3 = 0 (i.e. Ti3 = T3i, = 0) and all field quantities disappear at x3 = — oo;

APPENDIX I: COMPLEX RECIPROCITY RELATION AND PERTURBATION ANALYSIS 
471
therefore, only the second term evaluated at x3 = 0 is nonzero. Because u* has the time
dependence ejwt the equation reduces to
4P
At this point, it is helpful to eliminate the stress terms by calculating T'i3 in terms of
particle displacements.
If the perturbed SAW propagation is in the Love wave layer structure, the surface at
x = h is stress-free. If the film is isotropic, the Lame constants A. and /x, can be used to
define the elastic constants as,
c11 = c22 = c33 = 
+ ^
c12 = c21 = c13 = c31 = c23 = c32 = A.
c44 = c55 = c66 = U
and all other cij = 0
where the subscripts are Voigt index subscripts. Under these conditions and in the absence
of external body forces, Equation (I.1) becomes
T'
13,3 + J k ' T '
1 1 = ~v2pu'1
T'23,3 
+ 
Jk'T'21 
= 
~v2pu'2 
(1.24)
T'
33,3 + Jk'T'
31 = ~v2pu'3
where p is the density of the film.
At this point, it is beneficial to describe the field quantities in the film as Taylor
series about x3 = h, the film surface. Any quantity / that is a function of x3 is then
approximated by
f (x3) =
a
2f
2! 
dxl
(1.25)
where only first two terms will be significant when h is small. Because the boundary is
stress-free at x3 = h and the stress tensor is symmetric in the absence of external body
torques, it is also true that
T'13(h) = T'31(h) = T'23(h) = T'32(h) = T'33(h) = 
0 
(I.26)

472
APPENDIX I: COMPLEX RECIPROCITY RELATION AND PERTURBATION ANALYSIS
If the Equations (I.25) and (I.26) are substituted for the field quantities in Equation (I.17)
and all terms containing x3 = h are ignored (x3 — h is small), Equation (I.24) becomes
T'23,3(h) + jk'T'2l(h) =
T'33,3(h) =
-a>2pu\(h)
-a>2pu'2(h)
-co2pu'3(h)
(I.27)
In order to simplify Equation (I.27), it is necessary to calculate T'11 and T'2l in terms of
the particle displacements. Using Equations E.2, the elastic constants in terms of Lame
constants and (I.26) the Voigt index notation described in [31], it can be shown that
(I.28)
T'11(h) = -jk'fr + 2n)u\(h) + Xu'33(h)
T33(h) = 0 = jk'Xu\(h) + (A + 2fi)u'33(h)
If the last two equations are solved simultaneously to eliminate u'33(h), the result is
(I.29)
The use of Equations (I.25) and (I.26) leads to the following derivation for the stress
derivative terms
T'i3(0) = T'i3(h) - 
hT'i33(h) 
(I.30)
Therefore,
T'i3(0) = -hT'i33(h)
(I.31)
Substituting Equations (I.28) and (I.27) determines Ti33(h) and therefore T'i3(0). The resul-
tant equations are
(I.32)
and
T'33(0) = ha>2pu'3(h)
where v = CD/K = co/k' = the velocity of the wave.
Equation (I.28) can be used to rewrite T'33(0) = ha)2pu'3(h) as

(1.33)

APPENDIX I: COMPLEX RECIPROCITY RELATION AND PERTURBATION ANALYSIS 
473
Equation (I.33) can still not be used to calculate the perturbation to the film because it
requires knowledge of the particle displacements within the perturbing film. The equation
can be simplified by making two further assumptions. The first assumption is that the
addition of the thin film does not change the particle displacements at the surface of the
substrate. The second assumption is that the particle displacements in the film are constant
with respect to x3. The result of these two assumptions can be written,
With these assumptions made, Equation (I.33) takes the form
Ak 
vhco2
k 
4p
(I.34)
when Equation (I.34) defines the changes in propagation constant, when a lossless SAW
substrate is coated by a thin, lossless, isotropic film.
For a Love wave device, u1 would typically be 0 (because of the absence of a longitu-
dinal component of displacement), and rearranging the equation using the aforementioned
fact gives
Av 
v
Equation (I.35) is the expression for the elastic mass-loading effect of the ice film on
the Love wave device. The ice film overlay is described as an isotropic film with a density
of p', Lame constant of /z', and a thickness of h uniformly loading the propagation path.
Frequency shift because of acoustic-electric perturbation
To obtain the frequency shift because of an electrical perturbation, the first and second
terms of Equation (I.23) (indicating the mechanical characteristics) are made zero and
the wave is considered to be perturbed only by the third and fourth terms (indicating
electrical characteristics). Hence, the perturbation solution the electrical perturbation due
to as obtained from Equation (I.16) neglecting mechanical perturbation is as follows:
(I.36)
The electrical perturbation in air has been derived by Auld from Equation (I.36) and is
given as
AV\ 
1-/Z;(0)
—J 
£ogQ+ grz/(Q) 
(I.37)
where ((AV/V/)SC) is the velocity change rate when the substrate surface loaded by air

is the effective permittivity of the substrate.
Now we could extend this to electrical perturbation in a liquid. The relevant parameters
for the electrical characteristics of the liquid are the conductivity a and the relative
permittivity er. These parameters are expressed by the complex permittivity as
£water = erl£0 
(I.38)
O)
where ewater is equal to ^perturbed and er1 is equal to the relative permittivity of the liquid.
The unperturbed air is assumed to have e^air = era£0 and the conductivity is zero, where
era is the relative permittivity of air and fair is equal to ^unperturbed.
In terms of these parameters, the normalised surface impedance after perturbation is

Suggested Further Reading
Readers may find the following list of books available of interest to them. Some of the
books listed are rather introductory in nature and are intended as exemplars for background
or supplementary information - these are labelled by the letter 'I.' Other books are more
advanced in nature and provide further technical detail to the reader than that given in
our book - these are labeled by the letter 'A.'
The list of books coming under the topics of microsensors, MEMS, and smart devices
is intended to be comprehensive - that is all of the ones that we could find through
library and database searches. A number of these are the published, edited proceedings of
technical conferences and so may not be suitable to the less knowledgeable reader - these
are labeled by the letter 'P.'
