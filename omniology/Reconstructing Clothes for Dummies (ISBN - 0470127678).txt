About the Author
Miranda Caroligne Burns (San Francisco, CA) has donned a variety of hats 
in her young years: physical therapist, event producer, community activist,
installation artist, author, performance artist, philosopher, and fashion
designer. Mentored by her mother, Miranda has been sewing and creating her
own clothing since she could hold a needle. Over time she developed a zest
for re-use and heartfelt desire for truly unique design. This ethos is master-
fully woven together to recall the forms of yesteryear with an otherworldly
edge — a philosophy she calls “neoarchaic.”
Miranda’s life has been a bi-coastal artistic evolution. She became active in
the alternative arts scene in Boston, where she introduced “living construc-
tion,” a live sewing performance piece staged in gallery window fronts. 
Relocating to San Francisco in 2005, she quickly emerged as a bright new 
star in a constellation of provocative artist-designers. Her fashion shows are
known for their performance-art quality, embodying political, artistic, and
personal statements. These shows include Catwalk on the Wild Side (U.N.
World Environment Day Gala “Walk the Talk”), Love Fest VIP Event (San
Francisco City Hall), and Maker Faire (Swaporamarama and Make magazine).
She has also had various individual performance art appearances at
Supperclub San Francisco, San Jose Museum of Art, and Burningman.
Meander through San Francisco’s Mission-Deco Ghetto neighborhood and
you’ll find Miranda reconstructing in the window-front of her boutique,
miranda caroligne — a living construction boutique (www.mirandacaroligne.
com), 485 14 Street @ Guerrero. You’re sure to be delighted by the local art and
design, and step forward with the inspiration to do it yourself!


Dedication
This book is dedicated to you. Yes, you! You are a living, breathing work of art
in full construction and reconstruction every day. Shed your fear and take off
the blinders. Live fully in truth, clarity, and consciousness. Free yourself of
waste and find time for your passion in life. Be inspired by the re-use artists
and entrepreneurs in this book. Be an inspiration for others.
Author’s Acknowledgments
The rebel in me is pulled to write something unusual but I honestly must
express immense gratitude to my parents. Not only did they teach me about
sewing and textiles, but also how to create a livelihood from “hobbies.” They
never restricted my creativity and exploration of new ideas, even when I cut
up my turtlenecks for miniskirts! Still they managed to instill a core ethic of
hard work, humanity, and environmental responsibility. Thank you.
Much thanks to the trail of wonderful people who made this book happen:
Lindsay Lefevere and Jennifer Connolly, my editors at Wiley Publishing, for
your ever-positive spirit, guidance, and advocacy; Wendy Tremayne of
Swaporamarama, for sending Lindsay my way; Steven Raspa for introducing
me to Wendy (as well as being his inspiring self!); and the folks at Make maga-
zine for supporting the Swap and DIY textile arts at their Maker Faire.
Thank you to my fellow artists for ideas, help in the boutique, signature hair-
coloring breaks, coffee, and emergency computer aid: Anastazia Louise of 
Bad Unkl Sista, Dida Cudrnak of Dida Jewelry, Marc Scheff of Dangermarc,
Mariefrance of Madusalon, Rachel Hospodar of Medium Reality, Rebecca
Vandersteen of Venus Superstar, and Tammy “Tamo” Hulva of Greengirl and
Wildlife Works. To Del Greger and Honne Heller; you are the divas of graceful
play and I am truly humbled to receive your wisdom, brownies, and old
clothes.
I owe my eyes to Loren Earle-Cruickshanks for his photographic genius in
making the boring projects appealing and the good ones infinitely better. 
On the other side of the lens, thanks to Tamara Ja, Amy Leblanc, Lauren
Borowski, Chris Ray Collins, and Ocean for your strength of character. 
Much thanks to the following artists for accessorizing the shoots: www.
aikojewelry.com, www.didajewelry.com, www.fluidance.com,
www.orelafey.com, www.rengaarts.com, www.venussuperstar.com,
and www.zacharypryor.com.

We all owe a debt of gratitude to the people behind the shoot locations: Building
Resources and for keeping building materials in circulation of use rather than in
our landfills; Jens-Peter Jungclaussen, The Teacher With The Bus, for his veggie
oil fueled mobile classroom; artist Nome Edonna for his work in found objects
as an artist-in-residence at Sunset Scavenger; artists and all-around exemplary
human beings Marcus Guillard, Melvin Occasio, and Chris Ray Collins for creat-
ing beauty with the scraps in their own backyard. Thank you for allowing me to
share your work with others and to show the variety of ways we can all dimin-
ish waste for a more sustainable future. 
Thanks to my community for being fantastic beings of inspiration and end-
less support. So many others to thank for their smiles, patience, needles,
adventure kidnappings, healing hands, glitchy beats, hugs ’n clown kisses,
open hearts, and bright eyes to swim in . . . you know, all that gushy stuff!

Reconstructing Clothes For Dummies

Introduction
T
he projects in this book all develop from one essential story. Let me 
illustrate: Have you ever kept a sweater because it had some significant
meaning to you? Maybe at one time it carried the scent of a loved one, or it
reminded you of adventures you had in Paris? It may have even been passed
down from your favorite grandpa. The clothes you wear are an extension of
yourself and all that happens to you. The projects in this book are my way of
recycling those moments and integrating them together into a new form. Just
as we individuals are transformed by these life-altering experiences, our
clothes can be a reflection of those transformations as well.
Although reconstructing clothing is a new hot trend these days, I really hope
it sticks. I have been chopping up my clothes since I was a kid and have
always been showered with compliments from people of all walks of life. In
both my commission work as well as my “living construction” live sewing
performances, I have interacted with everyone from CEOs to people living on
the street. Everyone I come across is intrigued in some way by this concept.
Reconstructing existing clothes is an easy and affordable way to customize
and individualize a garment to your own special size and style needs.
Reconstructing clothes is truly for everyone
Beyond the practical perks of reconstructing old clothing, there are many
environmentally sound aspects as well. With every piece you reconstruct, you
are helping to diminish waste in a world overflowing with it. On top of that,
every time you wear a reconstructed garment you are promoting re-use and
sustainable living philosophies to every person you meet and even the ones
who just pass by you on the street. While it may seem cliché, it’s true that we
never know the full impact we have on this world. Make it a positive one!
About This Book
I think of this book as a group effort. I like to learn something from everyone I
meet, and then put my own spin on it. Reconstructing Clothes For Dummies is a
culmination of my experience up to this point, with so many avenues yet to
explore.

This book provides you with the basics of taking things apart and reworking
them to yield a brand new look. There are a slew of projects, and oh-so-many
more in my head. The project instructions are simplified to provide you with
the basics. Honestly it was a struggle for my creative self to keep it as bare-
bones as possible for you. But I did this intentionally to allow for your own
creativity to rise to the occasion. Part of reconstruction is, after all, making
something unique and fully individualized. 
I’ve included a list of decorative variations, either variations to the instruc-
tions or decorative touches to finish off the project. The variations I list are
just my ideas so please don’t think of this list as complete. 
Most of the projects in this book require sewing. Whenever applicable, no-
sew options to certain steps within the directions have been emphasized.
There are also lots of decorative variations that do not involve sewing at all.
Additional variations touch on other needlecraft and textile art techniques
that you might be interested in exploring further. I encourage you to take this
as a platform to spring off of with your own ideas and creativity. Always feel
free to expand on the variations with your own personal talents and inter-
ests. The possibilities are endless!
Beyond the basics and practical projects, I’ve plugged in conscious
reminders of sustainable living practices. I think it’s important to have fun
with what you’re doing, but also know why you’re doing it. While Chapter 2
discusses some of the reasons to reconstruct clothing, I’ve also embedded
my own experiences and intentions throughout the book. I don’t necessarily
just want you to regurgitate my feelings, but I hope to inspire you to look into
yourself and figure out your own intentions and aspirations for living a fulfill-
ing life. It won’t necessarily change the look of your piece, but will certainly
affect how good you feel in it! 
How to Use This Book
This book is not meant to be read cover to cover. If you are anything like me,
you just don’t have the time or patience for that! Personally, I like to figure
things out with logical thought and what seems to me as common sense. With
that, I completely understand others who work in the same manner and don’t
feel compelled to read anything more than the directions of their chosen proj-
ect. While you might be able to swing this, it will make your life a lot easier 
to take a quick glance through the chapter in which your project is located.
While mistakes and mishaps can be fun adventures to lead you in a new
direction, they can also be daunting, especially to the perfectionist. I want
you to find success in this reconstruction adventure so I urge you to read a
bit and learn new lessons from my mistakes rather than having to make them
on your own.

Reconstructing Clothes For Dummies 

If you are a proficient sewer, have a solid handle on textiles and how to care
for them, feel free to just dive right into the projects. In doing so, it’s helpful to
refer to the Part of Tens for some quick tips, do’s and don’ts that are special to
reconstructing clothing. If you are new to sewing, reconstruction, or just need
a refresher, I recommend reading Part I before you begin the projects.
Whenever I talk to people about reconstructing clothes, often a light of realiza-
tion comes across their eyes. Just about everyone seems to have something in
their closet that they don’t wear anymore but can’t bear throwing or giving
away for whatever reason. Because of this, I’ve organized this book by the
starting garment. This may be pants, a skirt, or an old favorite sweater. On the
flip side, there are before/after photos, as well as a color photo insert for you
to check out and choose a desired project. From that point, you can either
search your own closet or your local thrift store for the starting garment.
Conventions Used in This Book
In the throes of creation, you can easily lose attention with a tangential idea.
Not all of us have the luxury of a private studio or workspace free of distrac-
tions: ringing phones, hungry pets, playful children and other loved ones.
With this in mind, I’ve used a few conventions to help keep your mind and
projects organized.
 Every chapter starts off with care instructions. This care section often
references Chapter 4 for general care instructions, but I note within each
chapter individual differences among the garments that are important to
take note of. 
 Every project includes a before photo and ends with an after photo.
The before photo is located after the introductory paragraph of each
project, while the after photo is located after the instructions and before
the list of variations for that project. Please note that these project
photos are for the barebones basic version with no variations. In other
words, some of them are ugly. The artist in me apologizes. The teacher
in me hopes that you appreciate the clarity. In some cases, some “fix-a-
stain” or “making the most of wear and tear” tricks have been imple-
mented to create a functionally sound piece. 
 Every project includes a list of necessary materials presented in bulleted
format for easy reference and check-off. I confess that I don’t use all of
these materials. If you are proficient with these tools and feel okay substi-
tuting, go for it! If not, it’s best to have everything on the list ready to go,
and wait to fudge it until you have more practice with reconstructing.

Introduction

 Directions for each project are listed in numbered steps, making it
easy to keep your place. Each step begins with boldface text telling you
the general action for that step — the text following the boldface text
explains the step in more detail. Feel free to write in this book, make
your own notes in the white space and margins, and check the steps off
as you go along. This book is for using, not putting on a shelf somewhere
to look pretty.
 At the end of each project is a bulleted list of variations for that proj-
ect. These can be repetitive and in no way include all of the possibilities
for decorative variations. I’ve simply compiled some creative ideas that 
I tend to use and plugged them into the projects that they work best
with. Do not let this list limit you. If you are compelled to try the stripey
spray-paint technique on a knit — go for it! Just because it isn’t listed in
the variations, don’t assume that it’s not an option. You are always free
to try new things as long as you are willing to accept the consequences
that it might not turn out so hot.
 The projects photographed for this book have been completed with an
overlock machine whenever this method is an option. While I love using
an overlock because of its capacity to create the visibly constructed look
that I prefer, I in no way want you to feel that you have to go out and buy
an overlock just to complete these projects. I chose to use the overlock
for these projects so that it was easier for you to see the seams and better
understand how things are constructed. It is my primary tool, and thus I
must apologize for the horrific sewing on the regular sewing machine. I am
not exactly what you would call a good sewer! 
Foolish Assumptions
I’ve assumed a few things about you in writing this book: 
 You are open-minded, creative, and excited to try new things!
 You are not a complete novice to sewing. While this book provides brief
sewing lessons, it is not a “how-to” book for sewing skills. It is about using
those skills, as well as a collection of other techniques, in a novel way.
 You either are familiar with the tools, materials and verbiage of this 
craft or
 You are capable of becoming familiar with the tools, materials and verbiage
of this craft via the Internet, library, local craft/fabric store, and so on.
 You have heard about reconstructing clothing and want to play around
with it in your own personal wardrobe.

Reconstructing Clothes For Dummies 

 You want some clear and simple instructions to get you started on
reconstructing clothing. You may even have a particular garment in
mind already. 
 You live on this planet and care about its future.
 You’re tired of your sweetie’s holey T-shirts and underwear and are
determined to do something with them besides making them into rags.
Sound like you? Great . . . let’s get on with it!
How This Book Is Organized
I have broken this book up into seven parts. The first part includes introduc-
tory chapters for sewing basics, deconstructing and reconstructing. The 
following five parts are organized by the type of garment you are starting
with in your reconstruction project. Finally, the Part of Tens is a For Dummies
staple that provides you with some quick tips to refer to in a pinch. 
Part I: Let the Reconstruction 
Begin! But First . . .
This is the part in which you will find out the who, what, where, when, why,
and how about reconstructing. Okay, well maybe not the “who,” because
that’s you and you know that already. As far as “when,” well, that’s easy too . . .
right now.
Part I lays out the basics of this book. In it you will find the reasons behind
reconstructing, how to find good stuff to start with, what to look for, where 
to find it and how to take it apart. Last is a quickie sewing review of the tech-
niques you can use to put it all back together in a new form.
Part II: Shirts: Sluggish to Spectacular
What a better place to start than at the top! This part is all about reconstruc-
tion projects you can do with commonplace shirt styles: T-shirts, button-
downs, and pullovers.

Introduction

Part III: Breathing Life into Dead Pants
Pants come in all shapes and sizes, and this part lets you know what you can
do with all of them. Jeans are turned into all sorts of creations, while basic
slacks and stretch pants find new life in your wardrobe.
Part IV: Salvation for Your 
Sweaters and Other Knits
Sweaters and knits provide unique sewing challenges. I present these chal-
lenges and show you how to conquer them, amid a slew of projects for both
cardigans and pullover sweaters. I even include a chapter to help you figure
out what to do with those old afghans!
Part V: Skirts and Dresses (re)Done Right
This part is all about revamping old skirts and dresses. I show you some proj-
ects for several styles of skirts, that hideous bridesmaid dress, and multiple
options for any old dress.
Part VI: Now What to Do 
with All These Scraps?
If you are a sewer, or just an all-around pack-rat, you likely have lots of fabric
scraps taking up space in your life. Being both of these things, I have not only
gotten my own collection, but a virtual family tree of scraps passed down
from generation to generation. In this part, you can find lots of ideas for lots
of different sizes and types of scraps. It includes chapters on home décor
projects and accessories for your own personal wardrobe.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is a good quickie referral section of this book. Bring it along
with you on thrift-store scavenging trips to find out what to avoid. Trust me,
after years of perusing thrift stores there are some definite trends and pit-
falls, and I’ve got stacks of them in storage unable to be used but too fantas-
tic to cut up for scraps! It’s often hard to say no when you should. Having this
book on hand can help you sort it all out. It’s also a succinct reference for
general tips and clever ways to fix stains.

Icons Used in This Book
These cute little drawings are not just here for your entertainment. They
serve to emphasize important points. Think of them as a big flashing sign
begging for your attention.
The Tip icon points out just that, tips! Next to this icon you will find addi-
tional suggestions for either doing something better, faster or beyond the
basics in some way.
Eeek! Forget to read this and you may lose a finger! But seriously, there are
some dangers in reconstructing clothing, whether to yourself, your tools or
your garment. Read this to avoid injury!
Sometimes we forget, being human and all. This icon points out areas in
which this might be common, and helps keep you on track!
There are few projects that can be completed without at least some sewing.
Many, however, have components in the main pattern and even more varia-
tions that can be done without a needle and thread. You can find all of these
easily just by keeping your eyes peeled for this icon.
Three cheers for recycling! Saving your scraps from these projects can propel
you onto yet another project. This icon is next to every opportunity to do
this. It lists at least one suggestion for the particular scrap. The option is
always open to use your scraps in any way you choose as long as they are
kept in circulation and out of our landfills as long as possible! 
Where to Go from Here
While there are a growing number of books with ideas and patterns for recon-
structing clothing, I encourage you to explore your own ideas. Think about
what is lacking in clothing for you, either in the fit or the style. Are sleeves
always too short? Do you love fleece but the styles are always too sporty? 
Or do you find yourself saying, “I love this top but I just wish it was <insert
adjective here>.” Well find those garments and then plop open the pages to
the applicable chapter to find some projects to get started on pronto.

Introduction

If you’re wanting to know more about reconstructing clothes before you
begin hacking away at your own pieces, just turn to Part I. This book is a
great way to get a hold of some basics and get a running start on inspiration.
My other hope with this book is that it will get you thinking about all sorts 
of ways you can re-use and diminish waste in your daily life. While the prob-
lems of the environment can seem overwhelming and just too much to make
a difference as an individual, every little bit helps. Wearing reconstructed
clothing is a publicly visible reminder of re-use ethics. It’s also a great trigger
for conversations about creative re-use. I’ve included lots of references, 
especially within the color photo insert, to re-use facilities, programs and
individuals: an artist-in-residence program at my local dump, two facilities
that sell salvaged building materials (great stuff like antique claw-foot bath-
tubs!), a revamped veggie oil school bus, and a variety of artists working with
recycled materials. These types of things are within your reach to take part
in, if not establish, in your own community. Your children will thank you.

B
efore I knew what reconstructing clothing was, I was doing it. Heck, I
was doing it as soon as I knew how to use a pair of scissors and thread 
a needle! Just as my dolls all had crew cuts, they also had tricked-out recon-
structed clothing.
Like most reconstruction creatrixes, my initial impetus for heading down this
path was a desire to do things differently. Patterns bored me and made me
feel boxed in tight to someone else’s rules. Existing clothes that I found at the
mall (my only choice for shopping) were always lacking. They were especially
lacking the individuality that I was compelled to express. I wasn’t a rebellious
troublemaker, the opposite in fact. I was a little bit of everything and thus not
fully able to be defined or stereotyped. I like to think of my clothing in the
same way. 
Reconstructed clothing is not limited to a certain style, culture, or peer
group. Reconstructed clothing is for each and every individual. It is a mish-
mash of styles. It is about dismantling mass-production, both in what we put
on our bodies and how we function as a community unit, as well as an indi-
vidual in that same community.

Reconstructed Clothing Defined
As reconstructed clothing is becoming more widespread, it is also subject to
definition. Personally, I think we should all have our own personal dictionaries
that express our own unique use of language. While definitions provide clarity
in communication, they also have an inherent tendency towards limitation.
Limitation is blasphemy in the dictionary of the creative mind! Blow it open!
Clothing is a very accessible form of art and self-expression. Think about it.
You sculpt and paint yourself every day with the clothing you put on your
body. Clothing defines who we are to the outside world, as well as to our-
selves. At times there is comfort to be found in dressing in a manner that
defines you as part of a commonly-known stereotype. However, on the path of
life and self-actualization, shouldn’t you start defining this for your true self?
While not everyone can be their own fashion designer, you can start making
more conscious choices. You can start demanding more of what you want to
express yourself. You can start supporting local designers in your community
over mass-produced mirror images of your neighbor. You can start combining
clothes in unique ways. And finally, you can start cutting up those clothes
and re-making them into completely unique clothes that work for you!
12
Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 
Sample sales a.k.a. trunk shows!
When I lived in Boston I attempted, in vain, to put
together a trunk show. I soon realized that
nobody even knew what this was. Because of
this experience, I feel that it is important to share
this amazing thing with you in hopes that you can
produce and/or support them in your own com-
munity. Trunk shows, also known as sample
sales, can range in size and location but gener-
ally involve local clothing and accessory design-
ers gathering to present and sell their creations
to the public. Word on the underground design
street is that they started as true “sample” sales,
a sample being the initial garment that a designer
sews together to test out the design prior to 
production. This has broadened to designers
bringing their entire collections, samples or not.
The perks to this are beneficial to not only the
designer, but the consumer as well. It provides a
means for even the smallest designer to test the
waters on selling their work. It also allows for
them to clear out their samples and other pieces
that aren’t suitable for retail shops for whatever
reason. For the consumer, it’s a great way to get
good deals (usually half of the retail price) on
fantastic stuff. Typically the designers present
their work in person, which allows for a direct
relationship to form, increasing support for the
artist and customization for the consumer.

Clothes of a different color
The most common definition of reconstructed clothing is the practice 
of creating new clothes from existing garments. This can take on a wide 
variety of extremes. Many of the projects in this book fall into this category
of reconstruction.
Some examples of this include the following:
 Adding a simple hood to a jacket
 Cutting the sleeves off a T-shirt
 Shredding your sheets and turning them into a ruffled skirt.
 Cropping a sweater
 Creating a couture evening gown from an old duvet cover
 Cutting the pant legs of your jeans to create “Daisy Dukes”
 Doing the same thing, with a bit more discretion, to create long shorts/
short pants a la Dirty Dancing
This is a good method for people of all levels of sewing skill. It is especially
helpful for creative types who don’t like to use patterns, like me! It is also
helpful for those who have yet to figure out how to make patterns for their
own designs.
By starting with an intact garment, the framework is already in place. It is this
framework that is often boring for me in creating clothes from flat fabric (the
“normal” way). Even with my own patterns, when I have to cut the same shape
and sew the same seams repeatedly I feel like my soul is being sucked out of me.
My pseudo-mass production limit is 10 pieces. I’m not much of a sweatshop!
13
Chapter 1: The Ins, Outs, and Inside-Outs of This Book
Shop therapy!
I had a really bad breakup in my early twenties.
Really bad! I found myself in a sea of not know-
ing who I was without my “boyfriend” and our
pre-planned life together all spelled out for me.
Ugh, even that sentence alone is just filled with
societal definitions, expectations, and limita-
tions! How did I handle it? Shopping! With my
girlfriend in tow, or vice versa, I spent a ma-
jor chunk of my student loan money for the
semester in a single corporate-owned chain
store! I walked out with nearly an entire new
wardrobe, a virtual replica of the TV sitcom star-
let of the times, as well as just about every other
mainstream female age 18–35. I needed it. I
needed the stability of some sort of definition of
who I was, even if it wasn’t truly me! Clothing
can provide this therapeutic function at times.
There’s nothing wrong with that!

Don’t be fooled into thinking that starting with an intact garment makes
clothing construction any easier! Patterns and instructions are laid out in a
certain systematic order, like engineering. For this reason, it is actually much
harder to alter a garment after its initial construction is complete. On the flip
side, it is a lot more fun! 
Mind-altering alterations
Sometimes clothing is just fine in its present form, but it just needs a little
something. I usually come across people who just want a little pizzazz and
individuality added to their garment. However, this may also be your choice
of reconstruction to fix a poor fit, hide away stains or spruce up a worn ’n
torn favorite piece. 
With my sewing machine in the window front of my boutique, I am often
asked that dreaded question, “do you do alterations?” While I like to help my
neighbors and friends out with most quick-fix-its, it’s not all that exciting to
my creative spirit to just take up a regular hem. My compromise has been to
do what I call “creative alterations.” These types of interesting alterations are
visible and thus take the garment to a new level of style. Some tricks to push
it up a notch include:
 Sewing a hem with contrasting color thread
 Taking in a seam with the seam placed externally
 Decorative patching on wear ’n tear
 Decorative stitching on patches as well as on hems
 Decorative painting over stains
This type of reconstructing clothing is exciting for all levels of skill and cre-
ativity. It is the best way for the novice to get started and get some practice
with the basics of reconstruction. There are a lot of no-sew options with this
method. For those who don’t have a machine, this type of reconstruction can
allow for a little bit of hand-sewing to go a long way.
These little reconstruction touches are perfect for those pieces that you are
on the fence about cleaning out of your closet!
Lots of clothing is functionally well-made and practical. But it can also be
boring, not to mention looking exactly like every other piece that was mass-
produced from the same factory! These types of less intense reconstruction
techniques serve to elevate your ho-hum hoodie to a truly unique piece of
self-expression!
14
Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 

Clothing for cloth
I very rarely use this type of reconstruction, but it is a valuable option. This
type involves dismantling the existing garment and salvaging the cloth for
other projects. You may choose to do this for a variety of reasons:
 The fabric is gorgeous but the garment is horrible
 The garment shape is unable to be maintained due to style or other pitfalls
 The garment is excessively large
 The fabric is an oh so precious vintage
 The fabric is of high quality, such as silks
 The fabric has extensive beadwork or other embellishments that you
would like to save
 The garment has sentimental significance, but the style and fit are not
for you 
In taking apart existing clothing to make use of the fabric, the skill level
needed depends highly on the intended project for it. Because the garment is
being transformed first to flat fabric, the use of a flat pattern is appropriate,
and thus familiarity with using patterns is helpful. However, there are several
projects in this book that make use of flat fabric scraps in this way. Here’s a
list to refer to:
 Renaissance Repairs Pants — Chapter 9
 Detachable Bustle Skirt — Chapter 9
 Repetition Editions Jeans — Chapter 10
 From Flat to Hat — Chapter 11

Chapter 1: The Ins, Outs, and Inside-Outs of This Book
Regretful give-aways
A couple friends of mine have a playful banter
back and forth about clothing. They tease each
other on who got the hottest new thing off the
rack first (all local designer racks mind you!)
They also hand things off to each other from
time to time. Yay! Hand-me-downs for adults!
Recently I did some creative alterations on a
zip-up fleece for one of them. It was a beautiful
color but huge and boxy and altogether boring!
Turns out it was a hand-me-down from the other
woman. A few weeks later she taunted her
friend, “how’s that big old fleece working out for
you?” She was utterly dismayed to hear about
the fantastic new form it had taken. She, herself,
could have been the proud new owner of this
tricked-out fleece if only she’d remembered
about reconstructing. Don’t let this happen to
you — always remember the possibilities with
creative alterations.

 Whip Up a Wine Bag — Chapter 15
 Freeform and Frill Skirt — Chapter 16
 Casing Your Cozies Pillowcases — Chapter 18
 Quintessential Quilt — Chapter 18
 Sachet Simplicity — Chapter 19
 Pragmatic Potholders — Chapter 19
 Put Your Money Where Your Scraps Are Wallet — Chapter 20
What do you do when your heart can’t let go of a piece, but it can’t bear to
watch it hang wastefully in the storage closet? In creating flat fabric from
these pieces you can incorporate them into a quilt to curl up with and cher-
ish those memories. I’ve heard examples of this done with retired work shirts
and special occasion dresses.
This type of reconstructing clothing is actually a great way to learn about 
garment construction. By taking things apart you can figure out how they
were put together!
Trash to treasure
There is still yet another form of reconstruction that takes it all to a whole
new level. Turning trash into garments is a much more extreme form of recon-
structing clothes. Basically, this technique involves recycling non-clothing
items, trash, and refashioning it into articles of clothing and accessories.
For a variety of reasons, this particular method is not explored much among
the projects of this book. From Garbage to Gorgeous in Chapter 20, is the only
project that even remotely comes close to characterizing this method. Even
then, its inclusion is debatable since the trash component is textile scraps.
While I have seen found objects and other “trash” items recycled into the
decoration of a wearable clothing item or accessory, I have yet to see a fully
recycled trash piece that is functionally wearable. Hence the reason why I
haven’t presented projects of this sort for you in this book. The projects in
this book are for wearing, using and re-using as much as possible!
Reconstructed trash pieces fall in a range closer to artwork than clothing.
They make statements on recycling, often using small items that we never
even think twice about tossing away:

Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 

 Plastic grocery bags
 Candy wrappers
 Music cassette tapes
 Bottle tops
 Paperclips
 CAUTION or DANGER tape used by police, firemen, and construction workers
 Bicycle tire inner tubes
I must say that while these reconstructed pieces are intriguing and often
whimsical, their lack in functionality leaves me wanting something more. I’d
like to see functional pieces and practical uses of these recycled materials.
Accessories and outerwear hold more hope for this, as their need for wash-
ing is significantly less than daily wear. I don’t mean to discourage you from
experimenting with this method, but I do encourage you to make it as viable
as you possibly can.
Just Who Do You Think You Are?
This book is written to reach a wide variety of people while still maintaining
and honoring my own unique self and my community. In this section I will 
discuss a bit of my assumptions about who you might be as well. In this, you
can read this book in a different light of understanding, taking pleasure in the
points that are catered to your special needs, and thus having tolerance for
seemingly unnecessary points meant for others. This section holds some 
specific messages for you that might not apply to every reader of this book.
So pay close attention!
You are not a fixed entity! You may move between these groups at different
points in your life, or you may be a combination of several at any single point
in time!
The dabbler
You are a creative sort. You likely have a career, be it a job or other responsi-
bility, that doesn’t necessarily make full use of your creative spirit. Therefore,
you spend your extracurricular time doing things that fulfill this part of you.
You are a hobbyist. You like to dabble in lots of different activities, or maybe
specialize solely in textiles and crafts.

Chapter 1: The Ins, Outs, and Inside-Outs of This Book

Your sewing skills may be limited, out-of-practice, or nonexistent. In the next
few chapters I provide a brief refresher of these skills. I also mention a variety
of other options in the “Variations” section of each project. You, in particular,
are encouraged to explore the realm of these variations. If there is a new
technique, such as silk-screening, that you are learning, I want you to feel free
to play with it in these projects even if it is not mentioned. Heck, I don’t know
everything!
The environmentalist
You are concerned about this planet and the waste we lay upon it. You live
consciously. You continue to explore and make changes in your life to dimin-
ish waste. You recycle. You purchase products with minimal packaging to
avoid even having to recycle it from the start. You are familiar with the terms
“living green” and “sustainability.” This is a way of life for you, not just a hip
new trend with a cute logo!
You likely know a lot more about the environment than I do. For a variety of
reasons, I choose for my education to come from person-to-person sources
and thus I am not always on top of the latest goings-on. Therefore I can
almost guarantee that the points in this book are incomplete. Forgive me 
and feel free to inform me about it!
You may be a complete novice to sewing and crafts. For this reason I have
included quick reference instructions on basic sewing skills and tools of the
trade. I have made reference to a lot of techniques that you may not be famil-
iar with, such as embroidery. I did this not to confuse you, but to open the
door of possibility. I am a firm believer in awareness. If you don’t know what
you don’t know you are unable to learn it.
The student
You are interested in clothing design as a career path. You may or may not
have sewing and design skills yet. You see self-taught designers like myself
and wonder “is fashion school necessary?” I am often asked this question and
here are my responses (The following statements come only from my own
experience. I am certain that there are exceptions):
 It depends on your philosophy, heart and intent.
 Personally, I don’t see an absolute need for fashion school. Ages ago,
mentoring and apprenticing were the means of learning. Why they aren’t
valued just as highly in our society is beyond me.
18
Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 

 I’ve been sewing ever since I could hold a needle. My mom and grandma
taught me. What they didn’t teach me, I taught myself. I figure things out.
And someday, I might just take a pattern-making class to check in on
those skills. I might just read that “Complete Book of Sewing” that I
received last Christmas.
 But is it necessary?
Obviously you need to learn certain skills, but school is just one of many
ways to do this. I think that the difference (self-taught versus school) is in the
comprehension and resulting adaptation of the skill. When one is taught in
school, usually things are presented and perceived as the correct way with
little exception. This applies to any area of study, not just fashion design.
Lessons are like a recipe book of step 1, step 2, and so on. You just do it and
get graded on how much you adhere to the rules. So within those hard and
fast rules, where does the creativity come in?
A fashion school graduate once said to me, “the first thing they teach you in
design school is that nothing is original. Everything has been done before.”
Logically this argument is false. Unfortunately it yields ethical permission to
copy. To further compound this, I’ve heard many students say that their fash-
ion school teaches them to find inspiration and ideas by looking at other
clothing. We certainly influence and inspire each other, but to be taught to
seek it out and duplicate it in such a way really disturbs me.
This type of “inspiration” prohibits the evolution of fashion as an art form. I
believe that clothing can be the most accessible form of art to the masses.
Not only that . . . but it is a means of self-expression. Thus it needs to breathe
and evolve rather than be stuck in a box of re-visitation and reinterpretation
of design.
In the end, make sure you have a means to feed yourself, pay for shelter, 
and so on. Then follow your heart and create your heart’s vision. You will 
be happy.
The artist-designer
You have made clothing for yourself and for other people. You are well-
versed in sewing and clothing construction skills. You may be in fashion
school or a fashion school graduate and thus I may have insulted you in the
previous section. Whoops! Like I said, I am certain that there are exceptions
to what I have been exposed to. No hard feelings, eh?

Chapter 1: The Ins, Outs, and Inside-Outs of This Book

You are reading this book to learn more about reconstructing clothing. You
may be practiced in this and just looking for new ideas to play with. On the
other hand, you may work strictly in pattern-drafting and therefore recon-
structing clothing is completely new to you.
The patterns in this book are kept intentionally basic. This is done not only to
make it easier for the novice, but also so that you can put your own creative
spin on it. Whether you have a style all your own that you can incorporate, or
you are interested in playing with variations to develop this style, I wholeheart-
edly encourage this personalization. With your unique clothing construction
skills, you can even vary the patterns themselves to suit your own style. 
The projects in this book are meant for individual use only, not for mass-
production and/or for-profit! 
Perusing This Book for Your Best Interest
This book is intentionally set up for easy use. It is most important to me that
you leave it with an understanding of individual expression and conscious
living. The projects are merely icing on the cake of reconstruction temptation!
Seriously, I hope for you to use this book in whatever way serves you best. In
that, my goal of inspiring your individuality is achieved. Whether you choose
to read it cover to cover is up to you.
There are a fair bit of anecdotal stories inserted within the text. These stories
serve to provide examples from my life of the information being presented.
They are “extra” and while not essential to completing the project, they are
what drives and feeds me to continue creating this form of art. The people
I’ve worked with express much appreciation for these stories and how they
can relate to them. It helps to make this process human and well within your
reach of success.
In this book I’ve presented some of the basics of taking things apart, washing
care and sewing skills. If you are already competent in this, you are well-
equipped to jump into the projects. If not, give it a good review and maybe
even supplement your knowledge with Sewing For Dummies (Wiley).
Amid the project chapters you will find a color photograph insert. This pho-
tography was done with much conscious intent and thus I hope for you to pay
specific attention to it. The photographs represent many of the projects in this
book, including their variations. They serve to demonstrate how to wear some
pieces and how to combine them together in fun and functional ways.
20
Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 

Beyond this, it is important for me to share some points with you about how
these photos were completed:
 I used a local photographer, supporting my local artist community.
 I used local artists’ work to accessorize the outfits.
 I didn’t use mannequins because these clothes are made for real
bodies . . . your bodies!
 I used real people, actually very intelligent and strong women, rather
than models. I must confess here that in deciding this, the possibility of
having one model was considered. In researching that option, I found a
prevalent underweight trend even among amateur models! As a designer,
I can understand the ease of having this clothes-hanger-type frame to
drape clothes on and not worry about “real” flaws. But also, as a
designer, I feel a responsibility not to promote this unrealistic and
unhealthy trend.
 All locations of the photo shoots are working in “green” ways:
• Building Resources is San Francisco’s only source for reusable and
recycled building materials, supplied with donations exclusively
from the local community. It is a source of inspiration for artists and
contractors alike, as well as a place to donate tax deductible mater-
ial from building and demolition (www.buildingresources.org).
• Teacher With The Bus a.k.a. DasFrachtgut is a veggie oil converted
school bus, pioneered by Jens-Peter Jungclaussen, with an environ-
mental message that fosters education, entertainment, and sustain-
ability (www.TeacherWithTheBus.com).
• Sunset Scavenger Artist-in-Residence Program uses art to inspire
people to recycle more and conserve natural resources. The 
company provides selected local artists, such as Nome Edonna,
with the opportunity to create art using materials they gather 
from San Francisco’s refuse (www.nomeedonna.com and www.
sunsetscavenger.com/AIR).
• San Francisco artists Marcus Guillard and Chris Ray Collins with
visiting artist Melvin Occasio (Atlanta) are the innovative creators
of The Pegicorn, an interactive sculpture made from scraps in
their own backyard (www.marcusguillard.com).

Chapter 2
Reconstruction Reasons
In This Chapter
 Feeling good about reconstructing clothes
 Understanding the environmental ethics of reconstructing clothes
 Feeling the financial perks
 Salvaging sentimental items
T
he reconstructed look is becoming increasingly popular across all walks
of life. While I have a tendency to rebel against most things deemed
“trendy” or “popular,” I think I’ll stick with reconstructing clothing for all the
same reasons that I originally got into it. I hope you come away from this
book feeling the same way.
Be aware that even if something looks reconstructed, it may not be. Read
your labels and know your design companies. Many designers are just mass-
producing this style without encompassing the environmental ethos of it.
However, there are other design companies that are working hard to create
environmentally sustainable products. It is important to support and shop
wisely!
This chapter explores a variety of reasons behind why I like to reconstruct
clothing. I started out with just making use of the materials available to me.
These materials would have otherwise just gone to waste. As years passed by, I
developed more of a sentimentality towards reconstructing. Special pieces that
no longer fit suddenly came to life again with just a bit of creative assistance.
The financial savings in this process were obvious, although not always the
number one draw for me. Above and beyond any reason, I have always been
compelled to do this for purposes of self-expression and individualization.
I don’t give you these reasons as a means to preach any particular agenda.
Instead, my reasons serve to inspire you to begin or do more reconstructing
of clothes as well as encourage you to develop your own intentions and rea-
sons for why you choose to reconstruct. After all, it’s all about you!

Reduce
Reducing waste is the first chain in the link of sustainable living. It is the most
important. By reducing the demand for new “stuff,” the initial production of
that “stuff” will be reduced.
It is especially important to avoid stuff in lots of unnecessary packaging
meant to make you “ooh” and “ahh” and “look how pretty” and “Mommy I
want” and buy it, whether you need it or not. Don’t fall prey to marketing
schemes!
By reducing this production, energy is saved and raw materials are sustained.
You will also be reducing its eventual waste by the lack of its production in
the first place! Why fluster over how to best deal with waste after-the-fact
when you can eliminate it from the beginning?
In reconstructing clothing, you are reducing waste by choosing alternate
ways of clothing yourself. You are reducing demand for new clothing produc-
tion by reusing and recycling clothing that has already been manufactured.
You are creating a new style from this clothing, and making a statement in
doing so.
In wearing reconstructed clothing, you are supporting these philosophies
and helping to create awareness in everyone you meet. Trust me, you will 
get compliments on your creations! You will have a precious opportunity to
share these reasons and educate others.
While “recycle” is the most common mainstream buzzword when it comes 
to sustainable living, it is actually the third step in the desired hierarchy of
sustainability:
 Reduce
 Reuse
 Recycle
What does this hierarchy mean? The first step in sustainable living, a neces-
sary practice for all of us, is to reduce the amount of waste we produce. Is
your recycling bin overflowing every week? Take a look at the amount of
garbage you produce and try to imagine where it goes. Try to imagine what
in that garbage bag or recycle bin could have been avoided in the first place.
Here are some ideas:
24
Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 

 Using rags rather than paper towels
 Using cloth napkins rather than paper ones
 Using cloth diapers rather than disposables
 Bagged foods rather than boxed and bagged, a double whammy!
 Using refillable containers
 Using your own coffee mug rather than paper “to go” cups
 Using a sturdy water bottle, such as a Nalgene, rather than disposable
containers.
 Re-using grocery bags, or even better, bringing your own re-usable bags
for your groceries
 Reading newspapers and magazines online rather than producing 
the paper
 Using e-bills (electronic billing) rather than paper bills
 Avoiding junk mail with one of several services like greendimes.com
Reuse
Reuse is the second best way to diminish waste. It involves reusing manufac-
tured materials in their original form. Some common examples of this include
refilling water bottles and re-using grocery bags. Reuse is different from recy-
cling in that it does not involve reprocessing of the product, nor the energy
consumed and the waste created from that reprocessing.
In regards to clothing, the practice of reuse can take several forms:
 Hand-me-downs among siblings, friends with children of the same size,
and even among adult friends as well!
 Clothing exchange parties with your community of friends, neighbors,
family and/or other community organization.
 Donating to thrift/second-hand stores
 Shopping at thrift/second-hand stores
 Holding onto old clothes for rags, play-clothes, paint smocks, and so on.
Depending on your point of view, the projects in this chapter may be consid-
ered “reuse” or “recycling.” While an entirely new product is created, its 
production does not entail the standard reprocessing techniques involved 
in recycling. The energy consumed in their reprocessing is primarily your
energy. And I don’t think you put off hazardous waste when you sew, do you?
25
Chapter 2: Reconstruction Reasons

Recycle
What is recycling? The general definition of recycling involves taking an exist-
ing product and reprocessing it into a completely new and different product.
Common recyclables include:
 Glass
 Paper
 Aluminum
 Asphalt
 Iron
 Textiles
 Plastics
 Biodegradable waste (food waste) via composting
Recycling is important not only to reduce waste but also to save energy in
the production of new materials. Reducing the amount of waste needing 
disposal reduces the harmful environmental effects of common disposal
processes. These processes include incineration, pyrolysis (heat process),
and landfill.
26
Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 
An unfortunate outcome
I was recently asked to attend a critique at a
local art school fashion program. Their project
was to investigate the re-use clothing processes
involved at a major nonprofit organization. Lead
members of this organization were also present
to brainstorm, critique, and share information
and ideas. While the intentions of the organiza-
tion are wonderful, the students unveiled some
unfortunate outcomes of their process. Being
such a large donation center, they receive mas-
sive amounts of clothing. After several levels of
providing this clothing for local use, the leftovers
are packed up into giant bins and donated to
underdeveloped countries. While this seems like
a charitable thing to do, it is actually quite detri-
mental to the local culture and economy. The
students who saw these bins, which are packed
and sent weekly, were utterly shocked at the
quantity of clothing being sent off. Together we
brainstormed ways to reduce this, including
implementing methods of reconstructing the
clothing into more viable garments that could be
used by the local community.

If you have never seen a landfill, dump, or barge filled with garbage sent out
to sea, you should make an effort to do this. If you can’t experience it in
person, try looking up “landfill” online or at your local library. Putting a
visual meter on this helps reinforce the need to reduce your own personal
waste. You can make a difference!
However, there are some prevalent arguments that recycling does not in fact
save energy. The energy demanded by the reprocessing is debatable as to 
its environmentally sound practice. This is not to say that it is worthless. It
merely should not be used as a crutch in lieu of other means of dealing with
waste, such as reduce and reuse, as discussed previously in this chapter. 
How does all of this relate to reconstructed clothing? Many of the projects 
in this book fall into the category of “recycled.” Clothing items that have
already been manufactured and used, are reprocessed into a new and differ-
ent item of clothing, accessory or other product.
From an environmental standpoint, clothing should be reconstructed repeat-
edly. You might start with a button-down shirt, turn it into a pillowcase and
finally the stuffing for the pillowcase. In its last breath, textiles can be recy-
cled into paper, yarns and other products.
Reaping Financial Gain
When it comes to saving cashola, re-using and reconstructing clothes just
can’t be beat. You can still spend a pretty penny for pieces in a fancy vintage
store, and even some of the more boutique-like thrift or second-hand stores
in the city. But in comparison to what you would be paying for new clothes at
boutiques and major stores, it’s a bargain bonanza!
The savings just keep racking up when you reconstruct your own clothes!
Keep your mind open and your closet organized to make this easy to bring 
to fruition. If you’re just too bored with your own clothes, trade them with 
a friend!
Rather than sticking stuff in storage, get into the habit of reconstructing it
right away. It’s easy to forget about pieces once they are hidden away. There’s
truth to the old saying “Out of sight, out of mind!”
If you are really into the financial perks of reconstructing clothes, here are
some tips to get the most for your money when shopping outside of your
own closet!
27
Chapter 2: Reconstruction Reasons

 Take advantage of yard sales. Get ’em before they get donated!
 Know your price points. Arm yourself with knowledge of what common
items usually sell for in your area. Pieces generally fall into the following
categories:
• Pants
• Skirts
• Sweaters
• Dresses
• Suits
• Outerwear/coats
• Men’s shirts
• Linens
• Blouses
• T-shirts
• Children’s clothing
• Undergarments
 Hold your ground. Don’t be afraid to ask for a discount, especially if 
you really need it. You are also more likely to get a discount when you
are buying multiple items, and when you are familiar with pricing as
described above.
 Hit the small towns over big cities. In my shopping experience, the city
shops charge double the price of suburban shops. More trendy city
shops, vintage boutiques, and antique shops are even more expensive!
 Take a run through the children’s section. Children’s clothes are
always cheaper! Kids playful T-shirts and pullovers are especially fun to
reconstruct! Other adorable pieces might make a sweet little handbag a
la the It’s in the Bag project (Chapter 10) and the Bag Ladies project
(Chapter 13.)
 Remember the linens. The linens section has some fantastic treasures
for mere pocket change!
 Stock up on seasonal sales. Like any other store, second-hand shops
tend to display garments related to the current season. They also usually
have sales and discounted prices for items that are going out of season.
Feel free to ask about these types of sales at your local shop. Don’t worry
about being perceived as cheap. You might just be giving them a great
idea of a way to avoid the trouble of storing it for a whole year!
 Give estate sales a go. Get it before the vintage dealers do!
28
Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 

I find that I save the most money by not spending it at all. Lots of people are
happy to bring me their old clothes as opposed to giving them away to thrift
store never-never land! Put the word out to friends and neighbors that you’ve
got a new hobby and the clothes will come rolling in!
My personal philosophy is about balance. In saving money on clothing from
second-hand stores, I then have more money to spend on local designers,
artists, organic food, and even mass-produced clothing made in an ethically
responsible way (such as Wildlife Works) as opposed to sweatshop labor
(such as Wal-mart and Nike) just to save a buck.
Rescuing Old Favorites 
It might be scary to take the scissors to that sentimental piece. Okay, it’s
downright frightening! But it will do the both of you lots of good. Fond 
memories are not meant to be hidden away in a closet time capsule. Live 
in the present and relish in their beauty! Holding onto the past is a sure-fire
way to get stale and prickly!
But what can you do when your favorite old boyfriend’s sweater is two sizes
too big? Don’t let your memory turn frumpy or forgotten. By reconstructing it
you can give it life. Integrate it into your present life and your current needs.
Let it evolve in the same way that you evolve as a human being.
Here’s a list of some sentimental pieces that you might have hanging around
just waiting for a second chance at strutting their stuff:
29
Chapter 2: Reconstruction Reasons
I once was lost . . .
. . . but now I’m found by someone else who
needs me! Did you ever wonder what happened
to the item you lost but can’t remember where?
Chances are, it’s in an ambiguous lost and found
somewhere in your travels. When I was still in
school I worked at a movie theater in a rather
touristy area. Our lost and found box was over-
flowing with items that would never find their
rightful owner halfway across the country!
Because of this, lots of places have a timeframe
on the amount of time they will hold onto some-
thing awaiting the owner’s return. I don’t rec-
ommend randomly asking around to peruse
through these things. But if you happen to have
a friend that works in such a place, why not put
the word out?

 Inherited items
• Cozy grandpa sweaters
• Vintage dresses
• Suits
• Linens and dainty things
• Costume jewelry (make it deco!)
 Concert or event T-shirts
 Gifts from loved ones
 Children’s clothes
 Special occasion clothes
• Wedding gown
• Bridesmaid dress
• Prom dress
• Graduation gown
• Baptismal, Bar and Bat Mitzvah, or other religious ceremonial
clothing
• Interview suit
Redeeming Closet Space
Are you just dying for new clothes but your closets are overflowing?
Reconstructing your own clothes can help this common fashionista foible!
Depending on the projects that you choose, you can add more breathing
room in your closet. At the very least, it’s an even trade!
Here’s some clever ways to redeem the most space with reconstructing 
clothing projects:
 Upside-Down Skirt in a Topsy-Turvy World (Chapter 6): Use one T-shirt
for the waistband, one T-shirt for the skirt body, and frill up the bottom
edge with a few more.
 Bridging the Sweater Gap (Chapter 7): Turn two garments into one with
a sweater and a button-down shirt.
 So-Easy Split Skirt (Chapter 9): Free up a pants hanger by taking two
pairs of pants and reconstructing them into a single new skirt.
30
Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 

 Detachable Bustle Skirt (Chapter 9): Transform those extra pieces into
scrap fabric for this project.
 Surprise Fly Top (Chapter 9): Turn two garments into one with a
pullover and a pair of pants.
 Bare and Flare Skirt (Chapter 11): Keep the frills coming by chopping up
more T-shirts, pullovers and stretch pants for this project.
 Making a Case for Pillowcases (Chapter 12): Get that cardigan out of
your closet and onto your couch by turning it into a pillowcase to be
proud of.
 A Twist on The Upside-Down Skirt (Chapter 12): Turn a T-shirt, cardigan
and additional sweaters into this one fantastic skirt.
 Upside-Down Skirt (Chapter 13): Yet another version of the upside-
down skirt, making use of a T-shirt, pullover sweater and as many 
other sweaters as you can manage to frill up.
 Split Skirt Stick-Up (Chapter 15): Get rid of that gown you’ll never wear
again by pairing it with a pair of pants or jeans to make room for some-
thing that will actually get worn.
 Freeform and Frill Skirt (Chapter 16): Make use of those blouses and other
forgotten items by chopping them up for decorative frills on this skirt.
 Cutting Edge Cowl Necks (Chapter 16): Another two-for-one, or one-for-
two. A skirt and any old top make a great space-saving combination with
this project.
 Save-It-All Stuffing and Casing Your Cozies Pillowcases (Chapter 18):
Make more room in your closet and more comfort elsewhere in your
home by turning old clothes into pillows, coverings and cases.
 Quintessential Quilt (Chapter 18): This project is the ultimate creator 
of space! With layers of patchwork you can not only use up a lot of old
clothes, but bring it out of the closet and onto the bed as well.
Representing Your Self
My reasons for reconstructing all come together with this one. In reconstruct-
ing your own clothes you create something entirely unique for you and you
alone! In wearing this you demonstrate much more than your own style and
personality. You also demonstrate all the ideals, philosophies and reasons
discussed in this chapter!
31
Chapter 2: Reconstruction Reasons

The real new trend is consciousness! Wearing clothing is one thing that all
human beings have in common. Being conscious about what you wear and
encouraging the same thing in others can make a huge difference in this world!
Many people are making the choice to go entirely re-used in their wardrobe!
Think about the volume of shopping bags you bring home every week, every
month, every year. Think about what this amounts to in a lifetime. Now think
about that same quantity being buried in landfills? Or tied up in bins and 
sent off to developing countries. Think about tribal dress replaced by Nike
track suits!
Others who can’t quite manage to have an entire re-used wardrobe can still
be smart about where their money goes. Buying local is important for your
community. Did you know that for every $100 you spend at a locally owned
independent business, $68 of that goes back into your local economy?
National chains only return $43 of that $100! Who do you want to give your
money to?
Another trend that is here to stay is being aware about how your clothes are
made. In reconstructing your own clothes you can thwart any possibility of
supporting sweatshop labor. In buying local you also have some assurance in
this. Still it’s always good to educate yourself. The easiest way to do this is to
find a list of businesses that adhere to sustainable living practices. Once you
know where to shop, it’s easy to have confidence in where your money is
going, and what it is going to support. Sites like www.greenopia.com work
hard to compile lists to help you in this process. Make sure your clothes
aren’t coming from a sweatshop!
Check out the National Labor Committee Web site www.nlcnet.org for the
latest on human and labor rights.
In stepping off the soapbox, I accept that you may not be as hyped up about
the environmental and ethically responsible perks of reconstructing clothing.
But at the very least, I want you to be aware that it’s icing on the cake of a
cool way to express yourself.
In making the leap to chop up clothes that don’t work for you, you are open-
ing a door. You are now able to take positive action in your self-expression.
You no longer have to make due with what you can find. You are no longer
victim to someone else’s style. You can make it yourself, and make it how 
you want it to be!

stuff for reconstruction. Even with this knowledge, it’s often hard to stay
focused when presented with a bevy of reconstruction treasures at your fin-
gertips. Feel free to bring this book along with you on your shopping trips.

Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 
Shopping Your Own Shelves
Are your drawers difficult to shut? Are your shelves overflowing with who
knows what? Is half of your closet a virtual never-never land? Or are you one
of those lucky, or unlucky, clothes mongers with enough storage space in
your cedar closet to hold onto things for centuries?
If you have answered yes to even just one of these questions, it is time to
stop buying and start shopping in your own wardrobe. Forget perusing
through the second-hand stores! You are a perfect recruit for reconstruction
rehab!
A good rule to follow is that if you haven’t worn it in a year, it’s time to do
something about it. If it’s not a good candidate for reconstruction based on
the tips in this chapter, be sure to donate it to a charitable organization that
you would like to support.
I prefer small local charitable organizations that accept clothing rather than
the large-scale ones. These larger entities often receive such massive quanti-
ties of stuff that they are forced to do all sorts of not-so-great stuff with the
leftovers. 
Lifting the Thrifting Veil
In case you’ve been living under a rock for the past few years, here’s a tip:
Shopping at thrift stores is no longer just for people on a budget! The vintage
look came into vogue quite some time ago, almost to the point that it’s “out”
now. Whatever! In or out, who cares. Your look is your own, and recycling is
always in style.
Even if the vintage look isn’t your thing, you can still find gobs of interesting
and always unique pieces at thrift stores. It could be as simple as a black T-
shirt to go underneath that crocheted top, or a hoodie for that random back-
packing trip. On the other hand, this might be just the place to find a
goldmine of mismatched bridesmaid’s dresses. Halloween costume-hunting is
always made easier with one simple shopping trip. The creative costumer
need not be reminded of the inspiration that lies beyond the front door of the
local thrift shop!
Often when starting a new job, you don’t get paid for some time due to the
accounting cycle. In the meantime, especially in an office, you are expected
to have a whole new wardrobe of appropriate work attire! Instead of racking
up your credit cards on a slew of new clothes that will only see the fluores-
cent light of a cubicle, hit your local thrift store for all your office-wear needs!

With the reconstruction tips and fun new projects right here waiting, your
second-hand shopping adventures are sure to take on new meaning. You will
soon be able to scan things with a discerning eye as well as an air of inspiration!
One point of caution: Thrift-store shopping can be addictive!
The ease of city selection
My first experience with thrift-store shopping in a city occurred in Boston.
There was only one place to go but it was huge! I was amazed at the selection
and the organization of it all. Like most things in a fast-paced city, it was
quick and easy to find exactly what I was looking for. Instant gratification!
Here in San Francisco there’s a myriad of thrift stores to choose from, large
and small, charitable and, egads, for profit! Some are packed with a wide vari-
ety of stuff. Other shops specialize in vintage with a pretty price tag to boot!
For the ease of city thrift-store shopping, you do pay the price. For those of
us without transportation, time, and energy to head outside of the city, this is
often an even exchange. You just pay more for someone else to hand-pick the
good stuff, organize it, and even make it look pretty in a fancy window-front
display.
But what happens when you just want to browse? Where’s the adventure of
digging through heaps of random stuff? What fun is it to discover fantastic
new things when they are all utterly fantastic! It’s fairly obvious that this fun
is had by professional shoppers with a keen eye for rummaging the less pop-
ular thrift stores of the suburbs.

Tag-a-longs!
Here in San Francisco, it’s commonplace to put
your unwanted items out on the street for scav-
enging. On the same note, scavenging is fairly
common, even among more affluent members
of the population. While the bedbug bonanza in
Boston has reduced me to a squirming germa-
phobe in regards to picking up clothes on the
street, I’m certainly not opposed to accepting
stuff from friends and neighbors, and neighbors
of friends. Such was the case not too long ago
when a friend of mine arrived with four gigantic
bags full of clothes from a neighbor. It was
enough to start my own thrift store! What
appalled us was that most of the clothes looked
as though they’d never been worn. Many of
them even still had tags on them! While I’m sure
we’ve all purchased something, or received
something as a gift, that we’ve never worn, the
massive quantities of this particular shop-a-
holic collection simply blew my mind!

Here’s a quick reference list of the perks and poohs of city thrifting:
 Perks:
• Good selection.
• Well organized.
• Clean clothes (usually).
• Easy to find what you are looking for.
• Easy to get to without a car.
 Poohs: 
• More expensive than the suburbs.
• Lacking in that treasure-hunting adventure.
• For stocking up on large loads with no car, public transport can be
a nightmare.
Stocking up in the suburbs
Being a country girl at heart, I tend to stick to my roots and keep my major
thrift-store shopping extravaganzas, at least for the fun stuff, in the small
towns. I think it is nice to walk into a place, spend money, and know where it
goes. Small locally-run places tend to have defined organizations that they
support such as the local senior center, high school band or after-school 
programs.
It’s good to spend your hard earned cash on local businesses. Local busi-
nesses give more money back to their community than nationally-owned
businesses!
Not only are the suburban and small-town thrift stores more affordable, but
in my opinion they are just more fun! Of course, I like the Russian roulette
adventure of these disheveled and overstuffed nooks. I like finding treasures
amid nasty old sweatshirts and golf pants. Actually, the golf pants are pretty
cool too!
You may disagree with me. I’ve met others who prefer to find what they want
when they go shopping. This is not guaranteed when you step into a small-
town shop. You will likely be rummaging through a whole lot of old clothes,
maybe even your own. The smell is often reminiscent of mothballs or your
grandmother’s attic. Items likely haven’t been washed, so you might have to
make a judgment call with stains. Some come right out with simple washing,
and others are candidates for more intensive care and repair. It’s an adventure!

Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 

Here’s a quick reference list of the perks and poohs of suburban and small-
town thrifting:
 Perks: 
• Great prices!
• Getting there by car, you can stock up on larger loads.
• Fun to find treasures among the trash.
• Your money is typically pushed forward to local charitable causes.
 Poohs: 
• No guarantees that you’ll find exactly what you seek.
• Clothes aren’t always cleaned.
• The adventure of rummaging is often accompanied by odors of
extraordinary proportion.
• For city dwellers, you need a car to get here.
You’d be surprised what you’d find here
After years of thrift-store shopping, this fantastic opportunity had never
dawned on me. I was stuck in a pattern of checking out certain sections. I
looked for certain things. I kept focused on the basics of these reconstruction
projects.
Then one day a friend came with me on my thrift-store adventure. He led me to
a whole new section of the store that never made sense to me. A new light was
shed upon me on that day. It was the day I discovered the linens department!

Chapter 3: Scoping Stuff with an Eye for Design
Cut-throat thrifting!
One of my new favorite spots in the city is
quickly becoming my most dreaded experience.
Professional shoppers have taken over the
place and developed their own set of rules. Bins
of unsorted clothes are guarded heavily. Fierce
stares and sharp tongues await anyone daring
to step inside this gang-like cult. On several
occasions I have stood in the middle of it all,
utterly frustrated, “you mean I can’t even look
at the clothes?” The last time I was there I
dared to touch an old Singer put aside by a
woman. I merely wanted to show her the bobbin
case, a beautiful piece of engineering. She took
no gratitude in this gesture. In fact, I think I was
lucky to leave alive!

Who needs to buy fabric when you can cut up old curtains? For fancier or
more costumey fashionistas, the ruffling and decorative details are to die for!
Personally, I found a window dressing with giant grommets that made a hot
new belt-like thing. Quilters can’t go wrong with the plethora of sheets, dainty
hankies and other beautiful bits of wonderfulness to work with!
Here’s some other novel ways to get your hands on some good stuff!
 Yard sales
 Online community boards such as www.craigslist.org and www.
freecycle.org.
 Swaporamarama events: www.swaporamarama.org
 Organize your own clothing exchange among friends or open it up to
your larger community.
 Put the word out to fashionista friends that you’re on the hunt for 
reconstructables.
People love to give stuff away when they know where it’s going. You may
soon get overwhelmed with donations. Try to encourage your friends to
reconstruct as well, keeping your storage down and more clothes in recon-
struction circulation!
Updated Optimism on Dated Styles
Do you like to strut your stuff in the hottest new styles? Do you pour through
stacks of fashion magazines for the latest trends? While this in itself is a fun
pastime, it can get rather expensive to replace your entire wardrobe with the
“must-haves” of every passing season. Meanwhile, what do you do with all of
last season’s clothes that, in the blink of an eye, are suddenly “have-nots?”
When you create your own aesthetic that fully expresses yourself, rather than
mimicking the fashion magazines, you are always in style. I find that no matter
what I wear, as long as I carry it with confidence I get compliments galore!
Most “trends” are often reminiscent of a previous style or time period. In
perusing thrift stores or your own bevy of forgotten clothing, you can often
find pieces that with just a little repair and updating can be hip once again!
Isn’t it always better to be in an original, rather than some washed out dis-
counted, or overpriced, knockoff?
Mixing and matching the old and new, the vintage with the trendy staples,
can give you a look to hold your head high. 
38
Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 

Playing the Numbers
Personally I do not like to haggle over prices, especially when that money is
going to a charitable cause. It just feels insulting. But if you are on an hon-
estly tight budget, you can often work out an acceptable discount at the
smaller second-hand shops. Unfortunately, the for-profit stores, the ones that
I would feel okay haggling with, generally are not amenable to this mode of
purchase. Pooh!
Get to know the general price range for common items in your area so you
have some bargaining ground to stand on.
It’s hard to put a price on used clothing. It depends highly on the knowledge
of the person doing the pricing, as well as their own personal taste. When our
society is built around dollar number representation of value, it’s only natural
to price an item that you like higher than something you don’t.
It’s also natural to price something lower when you don’t have an under-
standing of how it was made. I think there was a period of time in which the
knowledge of textile arts and crafts was dwindling in our culture, as machines
developed to do these things faster and cheaper. Thankfully, with the resur-
gence of DIY (do-it-yourself) these skills are finding their way back into main-
stream culture!
I commonly find the following hand-made pieces in thrift stores at absurdly
low prices.
 Afghans
 Doilies
 Handkerchiefs
 Ladies’ gloves
 Embroidered blouses
It breaks my heart to see an afghan that took someone months to make by
hand, on sale for $2! Linen hankies for a quarter! I encourage everyone to
make good reconstruction use of these handiworks, not just because of their
inexpensive price, but in order to bring some appreciation back to the fact
that a real person worked very hard to create them!

Giving Ill-Fitting Clothes 
a Second Chance
When shopping for clothes, no matter how much you like it, if it doesn’t fit
quite right it doesn’t make it into the shopping bag. If you’re shopping for
new clothes you might not want to take the pricey risk of buying it anyway
and having it altered, either by yourself or a professional tailor. However,
with less expensive re-used clothing this risk is not such a huge leap of faith.
Sometimes reused garments do not fit so well based on the size. They may be
from a vintage era in which sizing standards were different, or they might
have just been thrown in the dryer too long.
Other times the fit is a wee bit off due to the style. In either predicament you
can fix it up to fit you right on with the tips and tricks in this book. When it
comes to sizing, I like to use the term “creative alterations” to describe my
self-taught tailoring techniques.
It’s important to realize that many of these tricks are visible alterations, and
thus the garment will not look like a tailored version of its former self. Go to a
tailor for that! This isn’t Tailoring for Dummies, it’s Reconstructing Clothes For
Dummies.
When it’s the style that is thwarting your fit, it might be time to get out the
scissors for some serious transformation. Flaws in a garment can spur your
creativity to new levels. Many projects in this book take existing pieces and
turn them into other things. Feel free to play with the components you like,
and leave out steps that don’t work for you based on your starting garment.
Have fun!
Damaged But Not Done Yet
Even the smallest tear or stain can send a garment packing. Personally, I like
to keep these as-is for “play clothes” like I had as a kid. Actually, I think most
all of my clothes have turned into play clothes by now! If they are too nice to
play in, I generally don’t ever wear them!
For most people, however, life doesn’t allow for you to walk into the office
with a torn suit. I understand and sympathize. But instead of giving up on
that garment, give it a whirl through the world of reconstruction! What’s the
worst that can happen?
40
Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 

Good stains versus bad stains
Some stains are great left as is. Paint stains are a perfect example. I often
have people mistakenly compliment me on my hand-painted skirt. Certain
liquid spills and splatters can also be enhanced with the techniques in this
book to create an intentional look.
However, one of the greatest skills in reconstructing clothes is knowing the
limit to this raw look. Some stains should only be covered up or cut out!
Here’s a good list to refer to:
 Food spills down the front of a shirt will always make you look like a
messy eater.
 Grease and dirt only work for an overall grungy style.
 Bodily fluids, especially armpits, collars, and cuffs stained over time are
never worthy of salvage!
Deals on decent damages
Because some people just don’t have the technical skill, or the artistic eye, to
see how to repair or make a damaged garment work for them, they deem it
worthless. As with any seemingly worthless thing, they thus price it accord-
ingly. This is where you can pick up some great stuff for minimal pocket-
change! Your knowledge of reconstruction can work to your favor not only at
second-hand shops, but in regular shops as well. Even larger discount stores
tend to have a standard markdown for damaged items, so be sure to ask for
this!
I hate to promote shopping at a large retail chain store. But for things like this
it can be tolerable. Besides, not every part of the country, or the world for
that matter, has the variety of shopping choices that I have within walking
distance from my own front door. Large discount chains may be the only
place for you to go, at least until you demand something better to support
your local economy and community. Maybe you should start your own thrift
store, eh?
Wear ’n tear worn well
At some point in our fashion history, the worn ’n torn look became stylish. It
was no longer reserved for “work clothes” or children’s “play clothes.” From
rock stars and rebels to models and fashion magnates, the intentionally dis-
tressed look seems to be sticking around.
41
Chapter 3: Scoping Stuff with an Eye for Design

Nowadays you can pay astronomical amounts of money for a team of people
to sand-blast, stone-wash, paint and otherwise destroy a once perfect pair of
jeans. One option is to wait until the person who spent gobs on that pair has
to jump on the newest trend and thus gives away their “old” pair. But even
more fun than that is to become your own sand-blasting distress designer
team!
You can start out with any garment in any stage of perfection or destruction.
It can be from your own closet or handed down from someone else’s. Keep it
as is, further distress it, or visibly repair it with a variety of techniques right
here in your hot little hands!
Feel-Good Fabric
There is one characteristic of clothing that softens me to any other flaws it
may possess. Fabric that feels good to the touch is an all-around winner. So
how do you determine this?
You could take a class on textiles and memorize the fiber content and meth-
ods of weaving that create a pleasingly soft texture. Then peruse each and
every clothing label, assuming they’re intact, to find out what the garments
are made from.

Dropping jaws
In my last year of school I had a job hand-paint-
ing clothing in the window front of a shop
located on busy Thames Street in Newport,
Rhode Island. It was fascinating and beautiful
and inspiring to both myself, customers, and the
tourists passing by. Years later I had another job
painting murals in a gigantic theater-turned-
nightclub/concert venue in Boston. Due to a
ridiculously tight timeframe, my friend Ryan and
I often had to paint during the events and con-
certs, always to the dismay of the management.
I still find it funny that what I once was paid to
do as a public display, was deemed a nuisance
by these less-than-artistically-minded folks.
Anyway, one night during a fashion show the
area in which we were painting was turned into
a dressing area for the models. This was no
local indy designer show, but rather a major-
label presentation with lots of bright white
smiles directed my way “oh, you’re painting!”
followed by audible whispers to staff, “but the
paint . . . and the clothes . . . what if they get
ruined?” Again I found it hilarious that what this
woman deemed “ruined,” other people actually
paid me money to create for them. So how did I
respond to this complete ignorance and false
bright smile? I turned directly towards the
woman, getting her attention, and smeared my
brush-full of black paint clear across the front
of my white shirt. She just about fell over! 

On the flip side, the side called common sense, here is a neat little trick. Take
your hand and put it on the garment. Feel it with your fingers. Ask yourself
“does this feel good?” If the answer is yes, it’s a winner! Simple as that!
To save time, close your eyes or just fleetingly glance at the rack of clothes.
Run your fingers along each hanger or sleeve as you walk along. Pull out any-
thing that feels good. Do this through the entire shop. When you’re done,
peruse through the pile, checking price tags, condition and other deciding
factors in your purchase.
Best Bet Basics
I have amassed bins and bins of vintage treasures that I either adore too
much to tear up, or just don’t have the time to brainstorm a brand new cre-
ation from them. But they do serve as inspiration, not just for other projects,
but for keeping focused on the best basics for reconstruction. So now I have
also amassed bins and bins of basics as well!
If you are not sure where to begin and what to salvage, here are a few sure
things:
 Sweaters, especially thinner ones
 Pants and skirts that fit in the waist
 Anything in a fabric that feels good
 Large-sized items in a fabric that you like
Keep similar items, such as those listed above, packed together in clear plas-
tic bins. Label the bins with the items inside so that you can find exactly what
you need with relative ease!
ABC’s to Avoid 
If you are used to shopping at regular stores you are not accustomed to
checking for some of the flaws typically found in re-used clothing. Normally
you would look at the style, the color, the size and the price. Now you can
add a few things to that checklist of essentials. Just as there are sure things in
life, there are sure things to steer clear of as well. Here’s a list of issues to
avoid at all costs.
43
Chapter 3: Scoping Stuff with an Eye for Design

Armpit issues 
Second-hand shops hold a plethora of tempting tops that just beg for you to
take them home. But before you succumb to this common “whoops!” take a
peek at what lies beneath that sleeve.
 Torn underarm seam
 Sweat stains
 Deodorant stains
 Pills (not drugs, I’m talking about that yucky balled-up effect that clothes
get when they’re rubbed together)
 Stinky pit
There are lots of vintage tops in gorgeous prints from the ’60s and ’70s.
However, many of these are made from polyester, a big contributor to stinky
pit syndrome!
Beadwork and other tempting adornments
When it comes to reconstruction, it’s nice to start with a clean slate. This
book gives you instructions for basic versions of a myriad of projects. If you
are just starting out, this is enough to comprehend. Throwing curve balls into
the mix, like working around decorative beadwork, is just too much to expect
of yourself.
You might be wondering why this is a problem. The problem doesn’t neces-
sarily lie in the beadwork but in its potential interference with the cut lines
and its proximity to sewing lines. Cutting through a section of beadwork typi-
cally cuts through the thread and knots that keep it secure. Not only will this
result in a loss of beads, but a loss of continuity in the beading design as well. 
Cutting through beadwork can ruin your good sewing scissors.
Just as there are precautions with sewing multiple thick layers of fabrics due
to potential needle breakage, the same reasoning applies to sewing thickened
areas of beadwork. On top of that, beads can also get stuck in the foot of your
machine, preventing forward movement of the stitching. These points may
seem obvious, but the ramifications are just too ugly to let it go unmentioned. 
44
Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 

Here are some other things to avoid for similar reasons:
 Sequins
 Thick embroidery
 Embroidery with metallic thread
 Embedded mirrors
Unless the adornments are well out of range of any area that I might be cutting
up, I tend to steer clear of these garments. Honestly, it’s rare that I even find
beadwork that is attractive to me so it’s never too much of a temptation. Still,
sometimes these items find their way into my hands, whether by exception,
donation or just plain oversight. In that case, I find that the best use is to cut
the entire beaded section out and use it as a patch on another garment.
Critters and creepies
I am fairly germaphobic. I admit it. I wash my hands vigorously after touching
door handles, being on public transportation and shaking hands with some-
one who seems to be under the weather. I also rarely get sick, likely because
of these precautions!
But in my own defense, there are nasty things out there that can get at you
and infest your home via used clothing! Just as I have tried and true rules to
my health, I have these rules to live by when it comes to scavenging for used
clothing:
 Never pick clothes up off the street!
 Be savvy of your thrift stores and how they handle donations
 Know what’s going on in your neighborhood. If there’s a bedbug problem,
play it safe and hold off on any used clothing from an unknown source.
 Wash all clothing before handling or storing it away for future projects
Bedbugs are not the only critters that can make a nightmare of your recon-
struction dream. Boxes, bags and undisturbed piles of clothing, fabric and
scraps are a virtual palace for mice. Here are some tips to thwarting the four-
legged furries:
 Keep storage to a minimum. The longer something sits idle, the more
safe and homey it becomes to mice.
 Pack items in tight-sealing hard plastic containers free of cracks.
45
Chapter 3: Scoping Stuff with an Eye for Design

It only takes an open area the size of a pencil eraser for a mouse to
makes its way in!
 Keep storage containers on shelves, making them harder to reach (for
the mice, not for you!)
 Keep storage in a well-lit, well-traveled area
 If your storage is in a dark, undisturbed place, check on it at least once a
week.
 Make your home mice-unfriendly by keeping it free of entry, tidy and clean,
especially of food waste. If the mice have no reason to be there (in other
words, no food, water, or safe shelter) they’ll find someplace else to go.
Depilatory delusions
It’s easy to have grand plans, hopes and dreams when you are still in the
second-hand shop. It’s a whole other ball of wax when you get stuff home.
Often things don’t look so bad on first sight, especially if there’s bad lighting.
But upon further consideration, sometimes too late, you’ll be wishing you
thought twice about it. Sweaters and fleece with pills (that balled-up look
where the fabric rubs together) easily and often fall into this category for me.
The best advice I can give you is to take a good look at the garment. A once-
over glance is not enough. Trust me! Pills are most common in the following
locations
 Underarm area where the sleeve brushes the side of the garment.
 Under the breast
 On the back where the back rests on a chair
 For pants: between the thighs
Sometimes a sweater or fleece is particularly prone to pilling. Other times it
has been washed improperly. In these cases it may be covered with pills.
There’s really no hope of remedy for the complete pill. Chances are you’ll
probably come down with a case of carpal tunnel syndrome before you’re
even halfway through.
For the partial pills, give it a test-fix. Pinch one of the pills between your fingers
and see if it pulls off easily. If so, the garment might be worthy of salvaging!
Sometimes pills are a different color than the original garment. Such is often
the case with dark sweaters and fleece washed with lighter fluffy items such
as socks. In these cases, once you get pulling at the pills you will soon realize
the infinite array of fuzz attached to your garment. Keep an eye out for these
particularly pilly problems and try to avoid falling into this predicament in
the first place!

Expectations of supernatural proportion
Be realistic. You are just starting out. It’s easy to get excited about a new idea
and forget about the work involved. It’s also easy to get daunted by a project
that is just beyond your beginner capacity and throw in the towel completely!
I don’t want you to give up that easy!
Getting the basic sewing skills and concepts under your belt with some
simple projects will help get the ball rolling. Once you’ve got a good handle
on this you can start pushing yourself a bit further. Here’s a good list of
beginner projects to start you off on the right foot:

Fragrant fabrics — if you have 
to hold your nose, put it back!
Second-hand clothes sometimes are ridden with odors that you just can not
get rid of. Even after repeated runs through the wash cycle and dousing them
with all sorts of odor removing miracles, there is still no hope for your nose.
47
Chapter 3: Scoping Stuff with an Eye for Design

Whether the odors are reminiscent of the wearer or from eons of storage in 
a damp basement, these pieces are worthy of investigation by the Clean Air
Act!
Don’t kid yourself. Odors on re-used clothes hold no guarantee whatsoever
for departure. It’s best just to steer clear of them. Save your sense of smell
and keep your friends close by!
Here’s a list of some odors that are particularly difficult to get rid of, and best
to leave behind:
 Mildew
 Mothballs
 Perspiration
 Perfume
 Pets

Deconstructing 101: 
Taking Stuff Apart
In This Chapter
 Setting up your workspace to work for you
 Tooling up
 Prepping garments
 Getting started: Ready, set, rip
I
’m not sure why cutting up my precious clothing was never a problem for
me. Maybe it was because I started so young, before I was buying my own
clothes and had an understanding of their monetary value. But then again, I
was like this with everything! I once asked my mom why this was so, and she
told me that I’d always been like that — if there was something I wanted to do
I just did it.
But with age and “maturity” this openness has waned. Thus I have developed
tricks and techniques to make deconstruction more doable, which often
breaks down to a few simple words to live by.
If a garment is not being worn, it’s just going to waste. No matter what some-
thing costs, or how sentimentally valuable it is to you, don’t let it sit idle and
unappreciated. 
Okay so ripping stuff apart may not sound so hard to you. But you’d be sur-
prised by the sentimentality that blocks you when it’s just you, the scissors,
and your grandpa’s old sweater. “What if I screw it up?” are words often spoken
by the reconstruction novice. Here’s where I can give you a lot of tips to make
it easier. This chapter gets you over that initial hurdle of deconstructing a
garment and makes you comfortable with taking the scissors to your special
old clothes. 

Creating Space to Minimize Waste
Your workspace can make all the difference in your enjoyment of the recon-
struction process. You may have a studio of your own to let your projects sit
safely midway through reconstruction. Or you may be working out of your
bedroom in which everything has to be packed up and put away every night
in order for you to sleep with out becoming a human pincushion.
Whether you are working in a spacious loft or a tiny nook, it is helpful to 
consider the conditions in which you work best. Accept these conditions
and don’t judge yourself for being overly messy or incredibly anal with 
cleanliness. You are who you are. As long as you don’t impose it on others,
life is good!
Communicate your particular style with the people you share your space
with. Being open about your style helps them understand your, well, let’s call
them quirks, and communication always helps to minimize potential frustra-
tion over the clashing of organizational style — or lack thereof.
In the next sections, I provide you with methods to work with your space and
organizational style whether your prefer to keep things clean and tidy, to let
it all hang out, or to take a little from both sides of the organizational fence.
Neat freak
So you’re a neat freak. There are worse things in life that you could be. The
important thing to remember in being clean conscious is to balance your 
creation time with your cleaning time. If you are cleaning more than you are
creating, it’s time to get a housecleaner, or pick up a part-time job doing this
yourself!
I thoroughly enjoy cleaning. More exactly, I thoroughly enjoy accomplishing
things. Cleaning gives immediate feedback for your efforts. This bursting
sense of accomplishment often can spur you on to new ideas and fresh
energy for your creative projects . . . coffee helps, too!
Here are some tips for the neat freak to minimize waste in their space:
 Keep all clothing and fabric in clear plastic bins with visible labels as to
what is inside:
• T-shirts
• Pullovers
• Button-downs
• Pants
50
Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 

• Jeans
• Stretch pants
• Cardigans
• Pullover sweaters
• Other knits
• Dresses
• Skirts
• Large scraps (for projects)
• Small scraps (for filling pillows or decorative touches)
• Flat fabric (by type of course!)
 Store these bins on shelves so that you can easily grab the bin you want
without having to unstack them. Shelving units on wheels make this
even easier, as you can stack items double wide and still get to all the
bins with just a little push.
 Write your name on your tools with a sharpie marker.
 Keep tools organized in clear plastic boxes or in labeled drawers —
rolling clear plastic sets of drawers are great for tool storage.
 Keep three garbage cans next to your workspace for:
• Garbage
• Small scraps
• Large scraps
 Keep decorative touches, buttons and beads, in labeled containers —
pill boxes are great for this.
 Keep thread visible, accessible and pretty by making a display board of
nails for them to slide on to.

Pre-clean prep!
When I first moved to San Francisco I lived in a
closet. It was a beautiful closet with a window
and everything, but still it was a closet. And
being that the house was filled with the most
smelly animals you could ever imagine, I spent
most of my time in my “room.” I sewed in there,
slept in there and often ate meals in there as
well, usually as I was sewing. Obviously it had to
be kept neat, being such a small space. But
more pressing, I found that I needed a delin-
eation of some sort from sleep time to creation
time. Cleaning served this function. Cleaning
helped me to not only prepare the space for
work, but prepare myself to be in a different
headspace. It is a habit that I have carried on,
even living outside of the closet. 

Chaos theory
The opposite of the neat freak, some people work best in what would be
deemed by most as a messy environment. At times, I fluctuate towards this.
I find myself saying those words often uttered by teenagers “I know where
everything is. Don’t touch (a.k.a. clean) my stuff!”
My reasoning for working in this manner is to create a palette. The larger the
space I have the larger my palette becomes. I work best when I can lay out
fabric and clothing in a visual array. I then mix and match pieces, brainstorm-
ing ideas as I move through the masses.
Just as neat freaks are often criticized for their compulsive cleanliness, those
adhering to the chaos theory also fall under a discerning eye. My dad once
shared with me a fun comparison to make light of it all: In answer to the
seemingly clever criticism of “a cluttered desk indicates a cluttered mind,”
my dad replied, “What then does an empty desk indicate?” 
Here are some tips for the chaos theorist to minimize waste in their space:
 Keep all clothing and fabric in clear plastic garbage bags.
Watch out for mice. They can get through garbage bags easily and will
just love making nests inside. Refer to Chapter 3 for more information.
 Make your tools easy to spot in a mess:
• Spray paint them orange.
• Tie something large to them (like the bathroom key at a diner or
gas station).
 Keep a garbage can next to your workspace. Put everything in it and
separate it later into:
• Garbage
• Small scraps
• Large scraps
 Keep thread, notions, decorative touches, buttons and beads, in visible
containers — save your spaghetti jars for this.
Organized chaos
Somewhere between the creative madness and the diligent do-gooder is a
wonderful concept of organized chaos. Functioning in organized chaos allows
for acceptance of imperfections and thus an opening of one’s mind to new
ideas. It is a less rigid way of working, while still functional for most people.
52
Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 

In this manner of working, there are different styles in and of themselves.
You may start out a project organized and get progressively messy as the 
creative ideas come into fruition. You may start out each work session with
a cleaning and organizational frenzy, followed by the ensuing creative brain-
storm. Or you may live in a constant state of organization that may only be
navigable by you.
Organizing in a way recognized only by you isolates you and your work. If
nobody else can find her way around your things, it’s hard for anyone to help
you when you need it. And if you’re anything like me, if someone doesn’t put
something back where they found it, or hand it to you directly, it can be lost
in the abyss for centuries! When you can’t find your tools, it’s immensely
frustrating to everyone involved!
For tips on minimizing wasted space in organized chaos, look through the
preceding sections and pick out what works best for your particular space
and style of working.
Getting the “Gotta-Have-Its”
When you are embarking on your hobby of reconstructing clothes, there are
a few things that you just can’t get by without. These are things that it’s
important not to be stubborn about. I’m sure there are MacGyvers out there
who want to make do with whatever tools happen to be within reach, but
please, I beg you, just get these few small things!
The seam ripper — a holistic alternative 
in anger management
The seam ripper is a fun tool, while still having a dangerous edge to it. I find
that men especially like to use this tool, possibly due to its similarity to the
knife and thus the whole hunter-gatherer thing. But seriously, the satisfaction
in ripping a clean cut seam can’t be beat!
This tool is quite useful for a number of tasks. Obviously, its intended pur-
pose is for quickly ripping out seams without risk to cutting or tearing the
fabric. It is also great for removing buttonholes, beads, patches and other
decorative embellishments. Minimal embroidery can disappear in a snap
with your seam ripper. For creating that worn-’n-torn look, the seam ripper
can achieve that naturally jagged look you’re looking for!
Always point the seam ripper away from you and anyone else nearby! It is
quite sharp, despite its seemingly innocent appearance.

Chapter 4: Deconstructing 101: Taking Stuff Apart 

Scissor happy
You need scissors. Real scissors! Don’t fool yourself into thinking you can get
by with that old crappy pair in your desk drawer. You can’t bother with the
safety scissors from your child’s art kit either. You need to get yourself a real
pair of scissors that you only use for fabric. Trust me. Do it and you’ll see the
difference immediately.
You have two options. Ideally you can afford to splurge $30 on a good pair of
fabric scissors from your local fabric or craft store. If you’re not up for this kind
of investment, you can get a less expensive but still decent pair for under $7.
Either way, these scissors are special and are only to be used on fabric.
Safety pins to save your soles
Always have safety pins on hand. Not only do safety pins help you make
quick adjustments, but you can leave them in without worrying about them
falling out when you pack up your projects halfway through the reconstruc-
tion process.
I grew up in a house with a mom who sewed often. Between her sewing and
my brother and my fascination with the brightly colored common pins, there
were more than a few stuck in our carpet. Considering how we tended to walk
around in bare feet most all of the time, I’m sure my dad would have much
preferred for me to come to the understanding of “safety” pins much earlier
in my life!
Taking It Up a Notch with More Tools
The novice reconstructrix may not need these tools, but I bet it won’t take
too much prodding for you to recognize how the tools in the following sec-
tions will make your life oh-so-much easier.
The rolling cutter — a 
love/hate relationship
I received a rolling cutter and cutting mat as an unrequested gift. I had no
idea what it was or how to use it. I soon learned that this is the best thing in
the world!
54
Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 

The rolling cutter is similar to a pizza cutter. It’s a round blade with a handle
that you roll along the flat fabric (on the cutting mat) for a clean and easy
cut. It cuts through several layers at one time (for mass-production). It is
sharp and it is fast!
The rolling cutter can rival any samurai sword in its sharpness. Always keep
the safety on when not in use. Warn any others who might come in contact
with it. Keep it out of reach of small children. I’m serious on this one!
Suck it up!
Having a vacuum on hand and ready to use makes clean up a breeze! Shop vacs
in particular are very useful as they don’t have a rotating brush mechanism
that is often tangled, twisted and jammed up by long threads and shreds of
fabric!
Clean your vacuum brush regularly to free it of the threads that bind up the
mechanism.
No fuss lint brush
When you are done with your reconstruction, you’ll likely be in a bit of a
fuzzy field of threads and shreds of fabric. To make your new piece look like a
new piece, having a lint brush on hand can come in handy! Lint brushes are
also a lifesaver if your fabric is accessible to furry four-legged friends. There
is nothing they love better than to curl up in a cozy pile of clothes ready to
reconstruct!
55
Chapter 4: Deconstructing 101: Taking Stuff Apart 
Don’t deny the danger
A fellow designer once asked me for some help
in cutting some pants (flat pattern). I offered to
bring over my rotary cutter and mat, which she
discouraged in preference of scissors. I still
brought it over, wanting to share this fantastic
thing with her, and preferring not to threaten
carpal tunnel syndrome with repeated scissor-
ing. After some time, she acknowledged the
effectiveness of this method. I could even keep
up with her, the queen of quickness! Within a
week she had herself her own brand new cut-
ting mat and rotary cutter! Within another week
I saw her with hands bandaged — she had cut
herself with the rotary cutter . . . both hands. Be
careful with this thing, folks! Even the profes-
sionals can get nicked now and then! 

Leaving Caution (and Washing) 
to the Wind
Your best bet with washing is to stick to the laundering instructions on the
label. If you have to cut it out either by personal choice or because of the
reconstruction pattern, be sure to read it thoroughly and make a mental note
of the instructions. If there’s a chance you might forget, keep the label intact
and in a safe place for future reference when the time comes to clean your
reconstructed garment.
Pin the laundering instruction label onto an index card with a description of
the reconstruction project. Keep this card posted by your washer.
Washing woes
If your garment contains any of the following materials, it should always be
professionally cleaned:
 Bead-work, sequins or other appliqué: These dainty details may fall off,
break, or melt in the washer or dryer. This is not only bad for your gar-
ment, but for your machine as well.
 Fancy or fragile buttons: Vintage, painted, leather, woven, glass, or other
fragile buttons could be destroyed by agitation in the washing machine.
 Animal products: Suede, leather, fur, feathers, or other animal products
that make up any part of the garment are not safe in water unless you
want to look like beef jerky.

Washing inspiration!
I lived in Boston when I first started making
clothes for other people. I soon found that my
style was much too outrageous and playful for
such a conservative city. Daunted, I turned to
muted tones of black, grey, and brown for the
bulk of my creations. I was thoroughly unin-
spired. Then, during the neighborhood open stu-
dios, I came across a rack of clothing by a local
art student. I left with a T-shirt, paying the young
woman at least $30 more than what she was
asking because it was so amazing! However, it
had a large splotch of water-based paint on the
back, laden with glitter. It was fun and lovely but
I knew it wouldn’t survive the washer. I wore the
shirt as long as I could without washing it.
When the day finally came to throw it in the
washer, I did so reluctantly. When it came out, I
was even more amazed. Beneath the paint, the
young woman had scrawled a message onto
the T-shirt: The remaining lyrics of the sentiment
she had patched and stitched into the front of
the shirt. It blew my mind and immediately made
me stop second-guessing the art that I was
drawn to create.

Making your life, and allergies, 
a whole lot easier
Often times your old clothes have been sitting idle for some time. They may
have been in storage and collected a bit of the musties. Second-hand clothes
can come to the same fate. Second-hand clothes may have also been subject
to nuisances and noses unlike yours. They can sometimes reek of perfume
and mothballs as well as pets.
Washing old clothes before you start handling them can clear them of this
not-so-delightful odor. Working with a freshly laundered garment will keep
your head clear and fresh as well. For those of you with allergies, this is
a must!
The miraculous marvels 
of modern washing
You might be working with vintage clothes that haven’t seen the light of day
for decades! Remember that washing was different back then before you give
up on a seemingly stained garment. Make these modern advances work for
you! Throw on some stain remover and give it a go through your newfangled
washing machine. You might just be amazed at what comes out!
Dryer be damned
The dryer can be the downfall of many a garment! It generally adds life, as in
“aged,” in an exponential way. Some items shrink while others pill. Stretchy
fabrics can lose their elasticity with a single spin! The general rule is to avoid
it whenever possible!
57
Chapter 4: Deconstructing 101: Taking Stuff Apart 
If you’re in that gambling mood . . .
My personal philosophy regarding labels and
laundry is fairly low maintenance and highly
experimental. I tend to throw caution to the
wind, throwing almost everything in a cold
gentle wash cycle. But I must also confess that
I often throw my knits, even my woolens, into
the dryer on a low setting for 15–20 minutes
before laying them out to completely dry. There
is almost always an evolution of the piece which
I find to be rather charming.

Making the Most of Flaws
I find flaws exciting. They push your creative boundaries, giving you a chance
to do some creative problem-solving. You can revitalize your garments by
keeping them as is and just doing one or more of the tricks listed in this 
section to fix the flaws. However, if you are going to be using a garment as
a base for one of the projects, it’s a lot easier to fix the flaws after you’ve
reconstructed it. Who knows, that nasty spaghetti stain that wouldn’t come
out in the wash might just be in exactly the right spot to be cut out of the 
pattern anyway!
Stains
Generally, you can either cover up or enhance stains. Take your pick!
Some stains you just can’t work with, unless you’ve got a high tolerance for
ickiness. For shirts, this includes armpit and collar stains. For bottoms, ahem,
stains in the crotch area. These stains may be more tolerable if you’re working
with your own garment, but when the garment is second-hand, it’s just too
yucky for me to stomach. I recommend either cutting these parts out com-
pletely, or scrapping the whole project.
In covering up a stain, here are a few ideas:
 Patch it. Sew a patch on that is large enough to cover the stain. Your patch
can be any shape. Don’t feel boxed in to the standard square! Sew it on
by stitching around the edges or get creative by randomly stitching in a
decorative pattern over the patch.
 Sew it. This technique is most appropriate with a small stain less than
an inch in diameter. With hand sewing, machine sewing, or even embroi-
dery floss, decoratively sew repeatedly over the stain. Use swirls,
zigzags, circles, flowers, or other shapes.
 Paint it. Using a fabric paint or marker, cover up the stain with a draw-
ing. Swirls, zigzags and other abstract shapes are easy and look great.
Using a stamp and embossing powder is another option. Visit your local
craft, fabric or art supply store for materials and instructions on these
techniques.
When painting on a garment be sure to have a scrap surface directly
beneath the layer you are painting, thus protecting the opposite layer, as
well as the table you are working on. A good re-use idea for a scrap sur-
face is old magazines or junk mail catalogs. Also make sure that as the
paint dries it doesn’t stick to the paper. Nonstick options are plastic
wrap or metal.
58
Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 

 Cut it. Literally cut the stain out of the garment. This will leave a hole
that you can either patch from behind, or leave as is. 
Cut several holes in the same area for a tattered & worn look. Instead of
holes, you can also cut several parallel slits through the stain (1⁄2 inch apart
and 1–3 inches long), giving it a slashed effect while disguising the stain. 
 Dye it. Dyeing is my favorite method simply because it’s so obvious, yet
so shocking, whenever I tell people. Dyes were originally made from
organic matter, some of the same organic matter that people deem
“stained.” So why not just dye, or stain, your entire garment in the same
stuff it was stained with! This works with wine, juice, tea, and other liq-
uids. Of course, you can also dye it with a commercial product.
Be sure to wash the garment both before and after dyeing!
In my experience the stains take on commercial dye more than other
parts of a garment. Therefore it’s best to keep the dyeing process imper-
fect, such as with tie-dyeing or bleach-work after dyeing.
 Do them all. If you can’t decide which technique to use, feel free to do a
couple, three, or all of them. I like to do multiple layers of all of the flaw-
disguising tricks. I start with a fabric patch or two. Next I do a patched
layer of ribbon or a scrap of bias tape. I top that off with some decora-
tive stitching, either by machine or by hand. Finally I finish up with a
stamp or hand-painted detail. Feel free to mix it up and find what tricks
and techniques you like to mix and match most often.
Tears and holes
You may be able to incorporate certain tears and holes into your design.
For example: 
 Cutting a tear through to the edge of the garment might make a good slit. 
 Holes, which can often occur along the edges of garments, can just be
cut out to make a wavy neckline, bottom edge, or cuff.
 Tears along seams can be restitched along the seam to maintain the orig-
inal garment. 
But these fixes are boring. To rev up your look, use one of the following tech-
niques for any tear, regardless of its location:
 Patch it. Sew a patch on either side of the garment as described above
for “stains.” Sewing a patch on top will hide the tear, while sewing it
beneath will create a little window of fabric peeking out from within the
tear. This little window technique works well with lots of decorative
stitching on top of it. See Figure 4-1.
59
Chapter 4: Deconstructing 101: Taking Stuff Apart 

 Hand stitch. Using a complimentary colored thread or embroidery floss,
make visible stitches of 1⁄4-inch length across the tear to sew it closed.
Making the stitches messy gives it a fun child-like look.
 Machine stitch. Create a zigzag or decorative stitch across the length of
the tear. Add additional stitching detail for decorative effect.
 Use the overlock. Create a decorative external seam by serging a seam
along the length of the garment, incorporating the tear.
Using this technique of running a serged seam along the length of a gar-
ment will make the garment smaller! Also, this technique only works if
the tear is in a straight line. For tears with a curved shape, use another
technique, or cut it open to make it into a hole and use one of the tech-
niques for creatively repairing holes.
When repairing holes, it is best to try on the garment to determine where the
hole falls and whether it’s an area that needs to be covered or not. If it needs
to be covered, you can do any of the patching techniques described above.
If it doesn’t need to be covered, you can make it decorative (see the section
“Stains,” earlier in this chapter and follow the “cut it” option).

Deconstructing Like a Pro
By now you’ve got your work space prepped, your tools in hand and your
garment clean and ready to go. So what’s next? Rip it all up . . . the smart way.
Sightseeing seams
The seam is where the pieces of a garment are sewn together, and thus where
you can take it apart (see Figure 4-2). The easiest way to spot a seam is to
turn the garment inside-out. Seams are typically found in these locations:
 For shirt body:
• At side: Armpit to waist
• At shoulder: From neck to top of shoulder
 For shirt sleeve:
• Under arm: Armpit to wrist
• At shoulder: In a circle around the shoulder and under the armpit
 For pants: 
• At side of leg: waist to ankle
• At inside of leg: crotch to ankle
• At belly and buttocks: waist to crotch
 For skirts: waist to hem
 For dresses: same as shirt but extending to hem of dress

Chapter 4: Deconstructing 101: Taking Stuff Apart 

To be or not to be a seam
When determining whether to open up a seam, read through the next sec-
tions, which give you a few things to take into consideration. 
Repair, reshape, or rip it out!
Sometimes a seam just needs to be repaired. In this case leave the seam
intact and just sew up the hole, overlapping with the existing stitching.
Ironing the seam flat will make it easier to stitch a new seam cleanly.
Sometimes the seam just needs to be taken in to fit better, or give the gar-
ment an updated shape. In this case, turn the garment inside out and pin
a new seam according to your needs. You can keep the old seam intact and
just cut it out after sewing your new seam.
Other times, you’ll want to rip the seam out altogether to completely trans-
form the piece into something else. Seam-rip all seams and then iron the
fabric flat to start fresh!
Clean-cut and easy going
Rather than seam-ripping a seam open, you can cut it off. This is especially
handy when converting a garment into flat fabric scraps. Using a rolling
cutter and mat is immensely helpful in this; however, good scissors can work
just as well to cut through both layers at once. 
When a top is just a wee bit tight in the armpit, upper arm and body, you can
rip open the seam and sew in a length of fabric (2–4 inches wide as needed).
This not only gives you more breathing room, but creates a sharp sporty stripe! 
Get over it and get started
With the basics of taking things apart and getting them prepped for recon-
struction, it’s time to just do it. One of the biggest hurdles is your own head,
really. Don’t worry about screwing up. What’s the worst that can happen?
If your intended desire for reconstructing your mother’s wedding dress is
thwarted by a slip of the scissors, that’s okay! Maybe it was meant to happen
that way!
Use mistakes to your advantage. Change your point of view and see them as
challenges and even guides to push you in new directions with your creativity.
At the very least you can always take a screwed up project and reconstruct it
into a pillowcase, quilt, wine bag or one of the many other scrap projects pre-
sented in Part VI of this book!

Chapter 5
Reconstructing 101: The Very
Basics of Sewing
In This Chapter
 Getting started with sewing — reconstruction style
 Creating an environment conducive for creation
 Exploring all your sewing options with quickie instructions
I
got my first sewing machine in 5th grade. I vaguely remember using it.
However, I do remember getting very annoyed with the tension controls
and jamming threads. Not so ironically, this is about the same time that 
raw edges came into vogue for my wardrobe. I stuck to hand-stitching small
projects for quite some time, about 15 years in fact. It actually wasn’t until 
I finished graduate school and got a full-time job that I pulled out my old
sewing machine again. I soon found that with regular use and annual tune-ups
it zipped along without any of its former issues. I must say, fully free of my
stubborn tendencies, that it also really helps to read the instruction manual
and do what it says!
While there are some projects in this book that are completely of the “no-
sew” variety, most of them require some basic sewing skills. In this chapter, 
I not only give you the basics of sewing, but I also give you instructions for
sewing by hand, by machine, as well as with an overlock. Of course, the
better your skills are, the easier these projects become. Using a machine
makes things easier, but is not essential for any of the projects. So do not get
daunted early on. With more sewing practice, both you and your machine will
run more smoothly.
Balance the enjoyment of a new challenge with your capacity for mastering it.
If it is not fun, it is not worth your energy!

Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 
Stocking Up On Sewing Essentials
There is nothing more daunting than trying to do a project without the correct
tools. You are extremely limited in your capabilities unless you have the tools
you need to do the job right. Trust me, there is only so much you can rig up.
Getting a bunch of new stuff may seem like a commitment, but this chapter will
ease your mind and wallet, filling you in on the essentials and not so essentials.
Trying to sew without the right tools is like trying to cook a nice dinner with
only canned tuna and ketchup in your cupboards!
Thread in your head
No surprise. In order to sew you will need thread. While certain types of
thread work best with certain types of material, I tend to stick with the all-
purpose dual duty, especially for hand and machine sewing.
Do not try to get away with one of those travel sewing kits. They are meant
for sewing up a tear or a button, not for an actual sewing project! You can find
thread at fabric and most craft stores of course. If you are not picky about
the color, you can also typically get the standard white at major pharmacies
and grocery stores.
However, if you are using an overlock, you need cone thread. No question
about it! Cone thread can be found at fabric stores. It is special because it
pulls straight off of the top of the spool rather than with the spinning motion
of regular thread.
You might have a collection of old thread at your disposal. You might also
come across some at yard sales or in thrift stores. In these cases, be sure to
check the thread quality carefully. It might be frayed, rotted, or decayed from
exposure to the sun or other nasty elements. Bad thread will cause you more
problems that you can imagine!
Think of thread as compared with flossing your teeth. The floss needs to move
smoothly between your teeth, just as thread needs to move smoothly between
the parts of the machine. Fuzzy or unevenly woven (lumpy) thread can bind
up, break, and cause all sorts of tension problems in your machine. Ouch!
On pins and needles
Personally, I am pretty frugal when it comes to pins. I hang on to them all, bent
out of shape or not! However, I do not recommend this practice. I have broken
many a needle in my stubbornness. Using straight common pins will help hold

your fabric in place, flat and easy to run through the machine. Bent pins tend
to get caught up in the machine, break needles, and cause all sorts of havoc. 
Always place pins perpendicular to the line of sewing so the machine can sew
over them easier. If you choose not to sew over your pins, this method of
placement makes them easy to remove as you are sewing. 
Regarding hand-sewing needles, use a needle appropriate to the project you
are working on. In general the finer needles are used for fine fabric, and vice
versa. However, you can really use any needle as long as it does not pierce
the thread of the fabric, causing a hole or pull in the material. Craft needles
are larger in size as well as having a larger eye for threading ribbon, yarn, and
other crafty cording.
I usually buy a variety pack of needles. I keep one pack on hand for regular
stitching and another pack for crafts.
Regarding machine-sewing needles, the same general sizing rules apply as for
hand sewing: fine needles for fine fabric and more heavyweight needles for
heavyweight fabric. Now pay close attention. This can make or break, literally,
your sewing experience. Here are a few “for sure” tips in choosing needles:
 Write down the machine brand and model number to bring with you
when choosing a needle.
 Take out the needle that is currently in the machine and bring it with you.
 Pack up your project or swatches of fabric from your project and bring it
along as well.
 Ask a salesperson for help in choosing a needle.
Do not be afraid to ask “why” the salesperson is choosing a particular needle.
This is a great way to learn how to do it yourself the next time you’re in need
of needles!
Here’s a quick list to refer to when figuring out what kind of needle is best for
your project:
 For general sewing, use a Universal needle
• Size 12/80 for most fabric types
• Size 70/10 for lighter weight fabrics
• Size 90/14 for heavyweight fabrics (such as the sweater projects) 
 For sewing stretch fabrics, use a stretch needle. It really does make a 
difference! 
 For sewing thin leather, use a leather needle. 
Both of these specialty needles come in the same packaging as the Universal.
Look closely and ask for help as you need it.

Keeping it clean
While annual servicing by a professional is needed, it is also important to
keep your machine clean on your own. Refer to your owner’s manual for full
instructions on this. Generally you will want to keep moving parts oiled and
free of dust (thread buildup). The feed dogs do not need to be oiled but they
definitely need to be kept dust-free. Be sure to keep areas that are in contact
with the fabric free of oil.
When oiling your machine, only use oil made for sewing machines.
Setting Up Your Workspace
Having a workspace that works for you can make your life a lot easier. This
does not mean you need a separate room, or a private studio to get some
good sewing done. But there are some key elements that will make any space
much more conducive for you.
Don’t rock the boat
Your machine can get off balance, whether working on a tilted surface or on a
surface that wiggles while the machine is running. Therefore, you will need a
sturdy table for your machine. If you find your machine moving or rotating
from its original position while you are sewing, this is a sure sign that some-
thing is off balance. First check your table for any tilt or rocking motion. Try to
fix the table as best as possible. Next, check your owner’s manual for ways
that you can make adjustments on the machine to further correct any tilt.

“I don’t know why but it does . . .”
This is what I told my friend about the stretch
needle. He was my only designer-ish friend in
Boston. We bonded immediately when we met,
falling into an hour-long discussion about, what
else, making clothes! In telling me about his
latest projects involving some sweet stretchy
fabric he complained about threads breaking
and bunching up in to massive tangles . . . all the
typical symptoms. I was very familiar with this,
and like him, was once very resistant to using a
stretch needle. I didn’t see how it could make a
difference. It looked just like the other needles.
But one day I caved and it was a day of salva-
tion! I shared this with him, just as I’m sharing it
with you now. I don’t know why it works but it
just does!

If your table is not able to be fixed, I hate to break the news but you will have
to get a new one. 
When seeking out a new sewing table, place your hands flat on the top and
try to wiggle it. If it moves, check the legs to see if there are any screws that
can be tightened in order to increase the stability. Tighten these. If the table
still wiggles, it is not any good for your sewing machine. You’ll need to con-
tinue on your search for the perfect table.
Once you have a sturdy table, set it up where you would like it to be. Check
for any tilt in the floor or table. A fun and easy trick to do this is to place a
marble or other smooth, round object on the table top in various locations. 
If it rolls, the table is not level. Fix the tilt by placing padding under one or
more legs. Some machines also allow you to fix the tilt on the machine itself!
Posture perfect
I couldn’t write this book without some sort of nod to the other “hat” I wear 
as a Physical Therapist. Extended sewing can cause overuse injuries, such as
carpal tunnel syndrome, tension headaches, and a myriad of back problems.
Having good posture at your machine can help immensely in the prevention of
these ailments. Here are the basics of good working posture, refer to Figure 5-1
for a visual representation of these.
 Chair characteristics
• Lumbar support
• Back rest at least the height of your shoulders
• Seat length so that there is 2–4 inches between the edge of the seat
and the back of your knees when sitting properly
 How to sit properly in your chair
• Hips all the way at the back of the chair
• Hips and knees at the same height
• Shoulders resting on backrest
• Feet flat on the floor (lower seat or raise floor with a book)
• Room for feet to move freely
 Table characteristics
• Table top is at the height of your elbows
• 2–3 inches between the table top and the tops of your thighs
67
Chapter 5: Reconstructing 101: The Very Basics of Sewing

Do not rely on good posture to solve all your aches and pains. It is also
important to take regular breaks to change position, walk around and stretch
your muscles:
 Touch your toes, or close to it. Keep your knees straight.
 Stretch your arms over your head.
 With arms over your head, lean side to side.
 Move your head side to side (ear to shoulder), left to right, front and
back (tucking chin).
 Roll your shoulders in circles.
Listen to your body. It will tell you what needs to be stretched. Sit down on a
warm floor and just move around. If a muscle needs to be stretched it will feel
like a good pulling. If something causes you pain that makes you wince, don’t
push it! Stretching should feel good!

Happiness (and everything else) 
is within your reach
It will make your sewing move more smoothly if you have everything you need
nearby. I tend to keep this pile of necessities close at hand on my sewing table:
 Scissors
 Needles
 Pins
 Sewing machine tools
• Tweezers
• Cleaning brush
• Oil
• Screwdrivers
 Thread
 Threaded bobbins
 Tape measure
If your table is not big enough to achieve this, there are a couple other good
solutions. You may choose to store these items on shelves within arm’s reach
of your workspace. Be sure these shelves are at the level of your table and
higher so that you are not hunching over to get to things.
Another handy solution is to keep items in a rolling storage cart. You can
hide this away when not in use. Just roll it out in a good position next to your
workspace when you’re ready to sew.
Going Unplugged — Sewing By Hand
I really enjoy sewing by hand. It is utterly meditative for me. However, it is
slow-going, which can often be daunting when facing a more involved project.
If you are sewing by hand, choose your projects wisely and plan your time
accordingly! It is not impossible, but it is important to have appropriate
expectations!

Third eye of the needle
Threading a needle can be difficult for the novice. But once you get some prac-
tice under your belt, you will be able to do this basic sewing task in your sleep!
1. Cut a length of thread 18–24 inches long. Use sharp scissors!
2. Wet the tip of the thread in your mouth to make a clean point.
3. Hold the thread approximately 1⁄4 inch away from the tip, holding 
with your thumb and forefinger.
4. Poke the tip of the thread through the eye of the needle. The tip,
being a bit wet, should be easy to grab and pull through the eye 
completely.
If you have trouble threading needles, have no fear. A needle threader can
help save the day, and your eyesight! To use this terrific tool, start by push-
ing the pointed part of the wire through the eye of the needle. Poke the end
of the thread through the loop of wire. Pull the needle threader wire back out
of the eye, pulling the thread along with it. Refer to Figure 5-2 for a visual of
these instructions.
Figure 5-2:
Threading a
needle with

70
Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 

You may also choose to use a self-threading needle to make this task easier.
Hold the thread taut in the notch of the needle’s eye. Snap the thread into 
the eye and voila! You’ve threaded it! Refer to Figure 5-3 for a visual of these
instructions.
When threading yarn or embroidery floss, it is often difficult to get a clean
cut edge that you can poke easily through the eye without fraying the ends. A
nice trick to avoid this futile threading attempt is to fold the end of the yarn
or floss and push the folded part through the eye. Refer to Figure 5-4 for a
visual of these instructions.

Knot enough
I recently learned a new trick to knot tying. I had always tied knots in my
sewing thread just as you would any other pretzel shaped knot. Then a friend
came into my shop one day and ever-so-proudly showed me a trick passed
down from his mom. Ironically, it is the same method described in Sewing For
Dummies! Guess I missed out on this one as a kid! What happened there, mom?
If you have a method of knot tying that works for you, stick with it. No need
to fix something that is not broken!
After threading your needle, always tie a knot at the end of your thread. 
This will prevent the thread from slipping through the fabric as you start
hand sewing. It also serves to secure the first stitch as you start hand sewing
your seam.
I typically knot the two ends of the thread together after threading the
needle. This allows for double strength in your thread and in your stitches.
For fine fabrics and blind hems, just use one strand of thread and thus tie a
knot in only one end of the thread.
The instructions listed below are for both right and left-handed knot tying.
Choose your hand according to what feels most comfortable for you.
1. Hold the thread between your thumb and index fingers and wrap a
loop of thread around the tip of your opposite index finger, as shown
in Figure 5-5.
2. Roll the loop between your finger and against your thumb so that the
loop twists, as shown in Figure 5-6.
Figure 5-5:
Make a
loop.
72
Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 

3. Slide your index finger back while rolling the thread until the loop is
almost off your finger, as shown in Figure 5-7.
4. Bring your middle finger to the twisted end of the loop, remove your
index finger, and firmly place the middle finger in front of the twisted
thread against the thumb, as shown in Figure 5-8.
5. Pull on the thread with the opposite hand to close the loop and form
the knot.

73
Chapter 5: Reconstructing 101: The Very Basics of Sewing

Do not forget to tie a knot at the end of your thread when you are done with
your seam as well! It is best to make the knot by passing the needle through
and catching the loop of the last stitch you made. Repeat this step for extra
security.
Basic basting
Basting is a quick stitch used to temporarily hold layers of fabric together.
Basting stitches are removed after permanent stitches are completed. Basting
is also used in the knit projects of this book to assist in preventing runs in the
knit while you are working with it.
Basting layers together, such as quilt pieces, is an essential part of the process. 
Use a contrasting color thread to make the basting stitches apparent when it
comes time to take them out. Weave the needle in and out of the fabric, with
stitches approximately 1⁄4 inch in length. Refer to Figure 5-9 for a visual of
these instructions. No worries if these stitches are messy. This is just a 
temporary fix.
Run with the running stitch
The running stitch may look similar to the basting stitch in its instruction,
but it is very different. Not only is this a permanent stitch, but the stitches
are shorter in length (about 1⁄16-inch), even and clean. You can weave the
needle in and out of the fabric in the same manner as basting, but only if you
are in a hurry, as in the case of a quick seam repair. Refer to Figure 5-10 for a
visual of these instructions. 
For the cleanest stitching, pass the needle completely through the fabric
before re-entering the fabric on the other side. In this manner, the needle is
perpendicular to the fabric and thus pierces each layer of fabric in exactly
the same place. This results in less visibility of the thread when the seam is
ironed, as well as a stronger stitch.

Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 

Blanket stitch or bust
This is my favorite hand-sewing stitch. It is not only a strong and secure stitch,
but it involves weaving the threads in a way that can be used as a decorative
external seam. I typically stitch 1⁄4-inch-long blanket stitches, but you can make
them closer together for a more secure stitch (such as needed for knits).
The blanket stitch is completed by piercing the fabric through the same side
on each stitch. This creates a loop that goes over the edge of the fabric. After
piercing the fabric front to back, catch this loop with the needle (from the
back of the thread to the front) and pull the stitch taut. Refer to Figure 5-11
for a visual of these instructions.
Hemming and hawing
Knowing how to sew your own hems is a valuable skill. Once you are well-
versed in this technique, you too will be appalled at the money you have
spent having a tailor or seamstress do this for you! It is about time that you
take it into your own hands, literally!

Blinded by the hem
Blind hems are invisible (ish) on the outside layer of the garment. This invisi-
bility, or blind appearance, is enhanced by using a fine needle and a single
strand of fine thread.
Start by ironing your hem. Fold the hem allowance back 3⁄8-inch. Start stitch-
ing on the hem allowance, 1⁄4-inch from the cut edge. Take a short stitch in the
hem allowance, then move the needle to catch a single thread of the outside
layer (the facing layer of the garment). Repeat with stitches approximately 
1⁄2-inch apart. Refer to Figure 5-12 for a visual of these instructions.
This skill comes in really handy for those bridesmaid dress alterations! Save
yourself from wasting even more cashola on a dress you’ll never wear again
by taking up your own blind hem!
Quick ’n slanted
This is typically the type of hemming that I do, for time-saving reasons only.
This is not a very durable hem, but for me the ease and quickness make up
for this.
Secure your stitch at the hem allowance. Then, in one motion, catch a single
thread of the outside layer (the facing layer of the garment) and continue the
needle into the hem allowance for another stitch. Refer to Figure 5-13 for a
visual of these instructions.
If you’re really in a hurry, make several stitches before pulling the thread
completely through.
Slippery little slipstitch
Do not let the heading fool you, there is nothing slippery about this slip-
stitch. It is a durable stitch that is used when hemming a folded edge. Start
and secure your stitch in the folded hem allowance. Move the needle to catch
a single thread of the outside layer (the facing layer of the garment). Take
another stitch in the folded hem and repeat. Refer to Figure 5-14 for a visual
of these instructions.

Moving Up To Machine Sewing
You will greatly increase your speed of working with machine sewing.
However, with the advent of modern machinery is the increased risk for mis-
takes and machine mishaps. Make sure you know a bit about what you’re
doing on a machine before you jump in blindly.
Get your machine in good working order before you start messing around with a
project that you’re excited about. Feel free to practice on scrap cloth to get the
tension set correctly. Don’t be stubborn about this. It does make a difference!
Key features
I am a fan of the basics. Sometimes the more you have to choose from, the
more complicated life can become. Here is a basic list of must-haves for your
sewing machine:
 Backstitch or reverse control: For stitching backwards to secure the
start and end of a length of stitching.
 Free arm: For stitching around tubular areas such as cuffs.
 Metal parts: Be a metal head and avoid plastic parts at all costs.

Tried and true tricks for affordability
Especially for beginners, I recommend getting a used machine. Not only is
this affordable, but in my opinion you have a better chance of getting some-
thing that will last. I often hear stories about people happily using their
grandmother’s machine, or like me, the machine I got for Christmas in 5th
grade. They made stuff that lasted back then. It wasn’t the disposable society
that we live in today!
You can find very good old machines at second-hand stores, yard sales and
even online for as little as $10–$25. I have found this to be true on both
coasts! My little collection of machines, like my clothing, is a mish-mash of
gifts, hand-me-downs, salvaged finds, and thrift-store treasures. With a little
TLC they all work beautifully!
Be sure that the machine has the key features listed above. Give it a test run
before buying, or at least ask the person selling it about its working condi-
tion. Accept that you are taking a chance with this. Don’t be naïve. Never
spend more money than you are willing to part with.
Bring your “new” machine to your local repair shop for a tune-up. Let them
know that you bought it used so that they can check its functionality first.
This way they can order any necessary parts ahead of time. On the other
hand, they might tell you it is a dud and unable to be repaired. Prepare to
spend approximately $70 on the tune-up. At this point your machine, and
you, should be ready to go!
Sewing machine repair shops are often listed under “sewing and vacuum” in
the yellow pages.
Salvation through servicing
Just as you go to the doctor for regular checkups, it is important to bring
your machine in for regular servicing. While you can keep it clean over the
course of the year, it’s essential to still give it a good annual overhaul by a
professional.
The pros can let you know how your machine is doing, what is wearing out
and what you might be doing wrong with it. Like I said, it is just like going to
the doctor!

Stitch essentials
Lots of new machines have all sorts of fancy stitches, at all sorts of fancy
prices. With computers coming into play, good old-fashioned sewing is being
taken to a whole new level of geekdom. Maybe I am a stick in the mud or
maybe I am just jealous, but I prefer to keep it simple. The projects in this
book just require the straight stitch and the zigzag, the bare necessities that
you can find on any old machine (see Figure 5-15 for examples).

Dirty little secrets
So I’m a rather aggressive sewer. So what! So
I tend to break needles before they’re ready to
be replaced. What of it? Well, at one point I
found that I was having some annoyingly
unidentifiable problems with my machine. By
the time I took it in for service it was at its last
breath. I remember standing there with the
technician across the counter. He held some-
thing in his hand, my needleplate, and tapped it
in his hands knowingly. I dare say he even
swaggered as he said, “you break a lot of nee-
dles, eh?” I felt like a kid who had just been sent
to the principal’s office (an experience that I
never actually had as a kid!) That man was like
a detective! In one quick glance at my machine,
the trail of the unidentifiable problem was iden-
tified, and I was at the end of it!

Straight up
The straight stitch is the basic sewing machine stitch found on even the
oldest machines. You can make the stitches longer and shorter, but other-
wise, it is just straight and simple. This stitch is used for basting (long
stitches), seaming and topstitching.
Zig my zag
The zigzag stitch looks exactly how it sounds. On older machines, this stitch
is created by increasing the width. Oh how I have spent many a befuddled
moment figuring this one out! On other machines, it often has its very own
spot on the dial. This stitch is used for adhering patches, decorative top-
stitching, rough-edged seams, securing the edges of knit fabric, making but-
tonholes and even sewing buttons on!
Beyond the basic stitch
While you can complete any of the projects in this book with just a simple
straight and zigzag stitch, it is likely that your machine has many more to
choose from. Feel free to substitute these other stitches according to your
skill and comfort level.
One stitch forward, two stitches back
Backwards, or reverse, stitching is usually noted by a button or lever on your
machine. It is an essential component to securing the start and finish of any
line of stitching. But it is also useful when doing decorative stitching to work
yourself out of corners and other tight nooks.
Function and form
The stretch blind hem stitch not only looks really cool as a decorative stitch,
but as the name implies it is very functional for stitching blind hems in knits
and other stretchy fabrics.
Three times your average zigzag
The three step zigzag stitch achieves the functionality of a zigzag stitch with-
out the tunneling effect created by too-tight tension with a too-wide-zigzag
stitch setting. This stitch is good for finishing raw edges as well as for decora-
tive effects.
Blinding hemlines
The blind hem stitch is another functional stitch that makes a decent decora-
tion as well. In case you could not tell by the name, this stitch is used for
machine sewing blind hems.
80
Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 

Over the top overlock
The overlock stitch found on regular sewing machines is meant to mimic the
stitch and finish effect of the overlock machine. I do not recommend using
this in lieu of an overlock machine, especially if this is a desired technique 
for your style.
Do it up deco style
Decorative stitches can vary widely. Try out the types on your machine 
with a piece of scrap fabric before giving it a go on your garment, quilt, 
or potholder.
Oh Holy Overlock Machine
I praise the day I got my overlock! It was a very serendipitous occasion. 
My mom had been prompting me to get one for some time, after seeing the
type of work I was creating. Prior to my overlock I was zigzagging patches
together in a rather painfully tedious sort of way. Still I was stubborn about
“needing” something else. Then I came across a man who was in the middle
of changing his career and getting rid of a brand new overlock. His story was
a beautiful one and thus I was honored to be part of his evolution from
designer to painter.
What is this thing?
An overlock machine stitches and finishes the seam all in one. It cuts the
fabric as it goes along, as threads wrap around the cut edge as well as create
a straight stitch. It is commonly found in the interior seams of sweatshirts
and other ready-to-wear garments.
Key features
What key features do you want to look for in an overlock machine? The
biggest pitfall I hear about is difficulty in threading. Therefore, the best
advice I can give you is to get a machine that claims to be easy to thread, 
has a color-coded diagram of how to thread it and in what order it should 
be threaded.
81
Chapter 5: Reconstructing 101: The Very Basics of Sewing

Never take a marketing claim to be truth. Ask for personal recommendations
either from friends or from the salespeople in the store. Sewing machine
salespeople are not like car salespeople. They generally want you to find a
machine that works for your skill level so that you can enjoy sewing as much
as they do!
Another key feature for a good overlock, especially for these projects, is the
ability to sew heavyweight fabrics. Do not be fooled by cheapo machines
making “heavyweight” claims. Make sure you get a good personal referral 
on this!
Making the financial plunge 
with buoyancy
My best advice in buying a serger is to find one that you like either by test-
driving at a store or searching online by searching the keyword “overlock
reviews.” Look at the machines in the $600 range and choose a couple brand
and model options from that list based on the reviews and personal recom-
mendations.
The next step in finding an overlock that fits in your budget is to search
online shopping Web sites. Search for your desired brand and model. There
are often lots of machines that are up to a couple hundred dollars cheaper,
even when purchased brand new! Be patient and diligent with this process
and you will come up a winner!
Stay smart and service me
Your overlock machine needs to be kept clean and oiled between projects. If
you are working on a particularly long project, or a rather dusty one (knits),
you may have to give it a cleaning mid-way. Refer to your owner’s manual for
how to do this. It is not hard and it will save you such headache and money
in the long run.
Overlock repairs are pricey. A cleaning brush and oil are much cheaper!
Beyond your regular cleaning, the overlock will need an annual tune-up at
your local repair shop. Be sure to call ahead to make sure they have the
capacity to do overlock machines. Don’t mess around with people that don’t
know what they’re doing. This is a serious machine that needs proficient pro-
fessionals to take care of it!
82
Part I: Let the Reconstruction Begin! But First . . . 

Starting and stopping with security
The overlock stitch is often referred to as a chain, as it looks like a chain
when run off the fabric. If the beginning and end points of your serged stitch-
line are going to be finished, either with the overlock or by hemming, don’t
worry about starting and stopping securely. Otherwise, you will need to learn
a few tricks of the trade to take care of this.
To secure the start of your serged seam, make just two to three stitches with
the machine. With the needles raised, lift the presser foot and bring the chain
around to the front of the needles and cutter. Bring the presser foot back
down and resume serging. The chain will be bound in the stitching and cut 
off by the blade. Refer to Figure 5-16 for a visual representation of this.
To secure the end of your serged seam, stitch one stitch off the edge of the
fabric and stop. With the needles raised and presser foot lifted, gently pull
the fabric to allow for some slack in the threads. Move the fabric forward
enough so that you can serge over your serged seam again 2-3 stitches.
Continue stitching off the fabric. Cut the chain close to the fabric for a 
clean look.
There’s a chance that this could still unravel a bit depending on your tension,
stitch length, and other stitch characteristics.
Depending on your tension and other variables, this method of finishing a
serged seam may still unravel a bit. I like to play it double safe by tying a knot
in the end of my seam. Do this by cutting the chain just a bit further away
from the edge of the fabric, approximately 1⁄4 inch. Untangle the chain by
gently pulling the two threads that wrap around the edge of the fabric (the
upper and lower looper threads). Tie a double knot with these two threads.
Cut off excess thread.

seam. 
83
Chapter 5: Reconstructing 101: The Very Basics of Sewing

If you are an avid overlock user and finishing a lot of seams with double
knots, it’s a good tip to keep your thumbnails a bit on the long side so that
you can maneuver the knotting with ease. 
Hungry puckers and differential feeding
Some overlock machines have a feature called differential feeding. This fea-
ture changes the way the fabric feeds in the machine, thus eliminating the
overstretched wavering edges that occur in some knits as well as eliminating
puckers.
By some perspectives, differential feed is meant to fix imperfections. I like to
use it to push the limit further in creating these “imperfections” as a decora-
tive effect. 
Go raw
The raw look is “in” and an overlock machine is one of many ways to achieve
this. For me, I like to use the overlock seams as visible decoration and sculpt-
ing effects. Others choose to do solely the inside-out look with their seams.
Either way, it is definitely a new technique that you can have lots of fun play-
ing around with!

In a Pinch Tricks
So you don’t really care about perfect seams and invisible hems. You are in 
a hurry! You are either on-the-go or too busy to even think about whether 
you are coming or going. No fear, there are tricks to do for your fast-paced 
life as well!
The heat is on
A heat gun is normally used for embossing and other craft projects. However,
it can also be a quick trick to seal the edge of synthetic fabrics. Keep in mind
that this is a very rough look meant only for costuming or rather edgy dress-
ing individuals.
Warm up your heat gun according to the instructions that came with it.
Taking care to keep your hands out of the direct line of the heat gun, aim it 
at an angle towards the cut edge. Keep the heat gun at least 3 inches from the
fabric. Keep it moving back and forth within an inch along the edge. This area
should start to melt within a few seconds. When it starts to melt, move the
heat gun smoothly along the edge, continuing the melting process as you go.
Be sure to work in a well-ventilated area. Your work surface should be heat
resistant and free of other items that might melt while you are working with
the heat gun. Keep the area free of other hazards, children, and animals that
may trip up the cord and cause your heat gun to move or fall off the work 
surface.

Not so self-explanatory
I’ve been doing this exposed external seam and
decorative stitching bit for a while now. Lots of
independent designers are doing it. On top of
that I’ve even seen it in the flashy fashion mag-
azines in waiting rooms (the only times I even
glance at them). So when I sent a box of clothes
out for a fashion show, with pictures of how
they should be worn, I never thought there
would be a problem. When the clothes were
returned to me, they were all inside out. I
thought to myself, “no, they wouldn’t have worn
them like this. They just must have taken them
off quickly.” But sure enough, when the pictures
came in the faux-pas was revealed. All the girls
were on the runway, tags sticking out of the
clothes with seams on the inside! Sacrilege!

No sew hems
Finding yourself in need of a hem repair on the go! No thread and needle at
your disposal? No-sew hem tape is your new best friend. This tape can be
found at any fabric store, but it’s good to keep it handy in your travel sewing
kit for emergency occasions. You just cut the amount you need and iron it on
to affix it to your hem.
Decorative cover-up
If you have got a stain with no hope of washing out, there are some solutions
for you. These ideas can be done in a jiffy for a temporary fix, or serve as a
permanent alteration.
 Iron-on patch
 Sew-on patch
 Put on a patch with safety pins (on the outside for an obviously 
rough look)
 Beads and buttons sewn on over the stain
 Painting or drawing over the stain

Chapter 6
Transforming T-shirts 
In This Chapter
 Caring properly for your T-shirt — before and after you rip it to shreds
 Bringing out the beauty in flaws
 Discovering sweet new clothes and practical ideas for old T-shirts
O
kay, admit it: You’ve got at least one old T-shirt, probably more. It could
be from a favorite concert or left behind by an old love. Or better yet, it
might just be the softest darn thing you’ve ever felt, but you’ve worn it to the
point that even your dog cringes at the sight of it! 
In this chapter you can find ways to revitalize this prized possession. I’m not
talking just making it sleeveless or fringed (eek!) or any number of the stan-
dard simple tricks. The projects in this chapter give you a fresh idea to run
on and explore your own creativity.
These projects include a top, bottom, and the stuff in between. The Upside-
Down Skirt is a clever and easy way to keep the coziness of your T-shirt close
to you. The No-Stop Halter Top has lots of variations to perfectly express and
flatter yourself. Finally, a use for that T-shirt that’s too beat up for anything
else, but too loved to scrap: Diminishing Waste with Waistbands! 
Giving Your T-shirt Some TLC
Whether you’re starting out with your own T-shirt or one you bought from a
thrift shop, you may discover some surprises about its laundering care. In
this section, I give you the ins and outs of how to take care of your tee, before
and after reconstruction.
Part of your prep may include fixing flaws. Refer to Chapter 4 to make the
most of the flaws. You may choose to do only these techniques to recon-
struct your T-shirt. However, if you do plan on proceeding with a project,
hold off on fixing flaws until you are done with the project.

Pre-construction care
Typically, T-shirts turn out just fine in a regular washer and dryer (check out
Chapter 4 for the exceptions to this general rule). Still, refer to the laundering
label for exact instructions. Some newer styles with spandex or lycra mixed
with the cotton of the fabric require special attention to keep them in tip-top
shape. If your label is missing, play it safe by washing the T-shirt in cold
water on the gentle cycle and no dryer!
In reconstructing, sometimes you forget why you put that old T-shirt away in
the first place. So be sure to check every inch of your T-shirt thoroughly for
stains and other wear and tear before you wash it. You may be able to get rid
of some of the stains with a spot treatment, and washing on the gentle cycle
may prevent further wear and tear to T-shirts that have seen a better day. So
keep an eye out for the following to save yourself a bit of time and energy
working around the flaws later: 
 Stains and other wear and tear on the cuffs of long-sleeved T-shirts
 Collar tearing away from the body of the T-shirt
 Armpit and collar stains
 Spill stains. You can usually find spill stains on the front of the T-shirt,
but you also may find some around the hip area where some people
have a habit of wiping their hands (ew!!!) or leaning up against a counter.
For ways to work with stains, see Chapter 4.
Post-construction care
After you’ve done all this repairing and/or reconstructing, how in the world
do you clean it? Unless you’ve used leather, fragile vintage buttons or other
appliqué that is obviously not machine-washable, I recommend throwing it a
gentle cold wash and flat dry to see what happens. This is always an exciting
part of the process for me as the materials have a way of blending together
and becoming one. But if you’re not such a risk taker, have your recon-
structed T-shirt dry cleaned.
One thing I can tell you for certain is that if you have used red embroidery
floss on a light colored shirt, or red fabric to patch your garment, it will bleed
and turn your garment a pinkish hue. Avoid this pitfall by dry cleaning.

Upside-Down Skirt in 
a Topsy-Turvy World
The Upside-Down Skirt is a T-shirt turned upside down and worn as a skirt.
Okay, there’s a bit more to it than just that. One of my favorite things about
this project is how it preserves every bit of the original fabric, as well as how
it can incorporate scraps of other fabric.
I first made this skirt a while back and grabbed it off the clothing rack in my
boutique in a mad frenzy of needing something to put on quick to head out
for the night. I’m thrilled that I gave myself such a treat because I absolutely
live in it! It’s as comfy as a T-shirt, but has a flare to it that puts it on the
dressy side depending on what you pair it with. I layer it with tights and
boots on chilly days. On its own it’s as breathable as a summer sundress!
Overall, this project is fairly easy. You start by cutting open the shoulders
from the neck down to the hem of the sleeve on each side. Turn it upside
down. Take it in or let it out if you need to. Add a waistband and voila! You’ve
got a new skirt!
Check out the T-shirt prior to reconstruction in Figure 6-1.

Chapter 6: Transforming T-shirts

Materials
 T-shirt
 1 yard of stretchy fabric or another T-shirt of complementary color
 Safety pins
 Common pins
 Tape measure
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread that matches the T-shirt
 Waistband material: 
• Drawstring (allow 20 inches of additional length for tying) 
• 3⁄4-inch-wide elasticized band or 1⁄4 yard of stretch fabric that 
measures the width of your waist
 Scissors
Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your T-shirt according to the label instructions, or, 
if the shirt has no laundering label, use a gentle wash and dry it flat.
2. Orient yourself. While your T-shirt is still intact, take a look at it. When I
use the word length I am referring to the distance and direction from neck
to waist on the body, and from shoulder towards hand on the sleeve.
Width is the distance and direction from side to side across the body and
across the arm (for the sleeve). See Figure 6-2 for a visual representation.
Width
Length
Figure 6-2:
T-shirt
length and

92
Part II: Shirts: Sluggish to Spectacular 

When referring to fabric, length is the yardage and the direction in which
that yardage is measured (also referred to as “with the grain”). Width is
the distance and direction perpendicular to this, running from selvage
(finished edge) to selvage (also referred to as “against the grain”). Note
that I have come across some very rare and odd fabrics that are woven
opposite to this, so it is helpful to be able to determine this by visual
inspection. Functionally, it’s even more important to feel the fabric and
stretch it in each of these directions. The direction that stretches more
is the width. See Figure 6-3 for assistance in identifying length and width
in reference to the T-shirt fabric.
3. Cut. Cut along the shoulder seams, starting at the neck and continuing
in a straight line along the length of the sleeve. Cut off the collar and
hem of the sleeve. If you don’t feel comfortable cutting free-hand, mark
each of the cuts with tailor’s chalk prior to cutting.
4. Turn it out and try it on. Turn the T-shirt inside out. Hold it upside
down and step into it. Pull the waist edge of the T-shirt up to your waist.
Does it fit comfortably over your bottom, hips and belly?
If you are sewing by hand or standard machine, your options for waist-
bands are limited to a drawstring or elasticized band. Be sure to leave 
an extra 21⁄2-inch length at the waist for this. Also, be sure that the width
of the fabric at the waist is at least the width of your hips. Measure the
largest part of your hips using the tape measure.
5. See how it fits.
If it’s too big: 
1. Fold the extra fabric and pin it with your safety pins as shown in
Figure 6-4.

Chapter 6: Transforming T-shirts

2. Take off the skirt and cut off extra fabric that you have just folded
and pinned, 1⁄2-inch away from the pinning. 
Save your scraps to add frill to the bottom of the skirt!
If it’s too small, you have to fit and pin the T-shirt (see Figure 6-5 for a
detailed view of the following steps):
1. Cut the entire shirt open along the length. 
2. Starting at the waist, line up a length of stretchy fabric (or a length of
fabric from another T- shirt) with the cut edge of the original T-shirt. 
3. Safety pin together with right sides facing and a 1⁄2-inch seam
allowance. 
4. Wrap the T-shirt around your waist (inside out as in Step 4). 
5. Safety pin the edges together to fit you comfortably, right sides
facing and a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance. 
6. Take off the skirt and cut off any extra fabric from the seam that
you have just pinned, as well as any extra length of fabric.
Save your scraps for Renaissance Repairs in Chapter 9!

This technique for too-small T-shirts also comes in handy to get rid
of logos. Cut out the entire length of the piece with the logo. Refer
to Figure 6-6. Proceed with the directions for “too small” T-shirts.
6. Replace safety pins. Replace the safety pins with common pins, placing
them perpendicular to the cut edge every 2 inches.
7. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing, or using an overlock machine.
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Running stitch all vertical seams with a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance.
Hem the bottom edge using the quick-hem technique.
• Sewing by machine: Straight stitch all vertical seams using a 1⁄2-inch
seam allowance. Hem the edge using the quick-hem technique
described in Chapter 5.
• Sewing with an overlock: Serge all vertical seams using a 1⁄2-inch
seam allowance. Hem the edge using the quick-hem technique
described in Chapter 5.
Instead of sewing a finished hem, you can use no-sew hem tape. This
tape is just ironed on. You can find it in your local fabric or craft store,
online, or even in major supermarkets and department stores.
8. Repair. Refer to Chapter 4 to repair any tears, holes, and stains as
needed.

9. Make the waistband. If you are using an overlock machine, refer to
another project in this chapter, “Diminishing Waste with Waistbands.”
Otherwise, do the following:
1. Fold 11⁄2 inches of the top edge towards the inside of the garment. 
2. Using common pins, pin the two layers together, with the pins
placed perpendicular to and 1 inch in from the folded edge. 
3. Using a running stitch (hand sewing) or a zigzag stitch (machine
sewing), sew the waist 1 inch from the folded edge. (See Figure 6-7.)
4. Remove pins and proceed with the waistband by referring to the
directions for elasticized waistbands and drawstring waistbands in
the project, “Diminishing Waste with Waistbands” later in this
chapter.

Variations
For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas:
 Raw look: For external seams, skip Step 4, keeping the T-shirt right side
out. Instead of finishing the edge with a hem, leave out this step and
blanket stitch (hand sewing), zigzag stitch (machine sewing) or serge
the edge (overlock) for a raw finish.
 Bias tape: Instead of hemming the edge or leaving it raw, you can cover
it with a decorative bias tape. This can be found in any sewing goods or
fabric store, usually near the zippers in the “Notions” area. Bias tape
comes in a variety of colors and can be either hand-sewn or machine
sewn on to cover the edge (follow the instructions on the package).
 More frill: Add more length and frill to your skirt by adding scraps of
material onto the bottom edge prior to hemming. Pleating (folding) or
ruffling the scrap piece makes this extra fun! See Figure 6-9 for a visual.
 Thick stitches: Complete all stitches by hand sewing with embroidery
floss.
 Thicker stitches: Hand sewing over pre-sewn and secured edges with
yarn or ribbon.
 Mix colors: Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements the
color of the skirt. With a sewing machine you can also use a different
color for the bobbin thread. With an overlock machine, you can get
really creative and use four to five different colors.
 No-sew deco techniques: You can leave the edge completely unstitched
and raw. Running it through the washer and dryer will help the edges
fray and bind together to complete the “unfinished” look. Other no-sew
ideas include painting, grommeting, riveting, bedazzling, dyeing, and
drawing with fabric markers or even a sharpie marker. Make stripes on
your skirt with gaffer’s or masking tape. Spray a light coat of spray paint
over it, let dry and remove the tape to reveal super-hot stripes!

Powerful perspective
When fitting for this or any of the projects in this
book, it is not you who is too small or too big, it
is the garment! Don’t let the garment, and some
arbitrary number assigned to it, have power
over how you feel about yourself!

No-Stop Halter Top
The No-Stop Halter Top is a clever way to alter your T-shirt just enough to
take it from plain to pretty in just a few easy steps. It’s a perfect piece for a
beach or poolside cover-up. With a quick change you can add a skirt and
head right out for dinner or a sunset stroll.
This project is easy. You just cut up your T-shirt and bind the edges. 
Extra decorative effects add fun to both the piece and to the process of
making it.

Materials
 T-shirt that fits you well
 Safety pins
 Common pins
 Tape measure
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread that matches the T-shirt
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Scissors
Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your T-shirt according to the label instructions, or, 
if the T-shirt has no laundering label, use a gentle wash and dry it flat.
2. First cut. Cut your T-shirt across the back, armpit to armpit, and along
the inside of the sleeve up to the shoulder seam. You will continue this
cut line in Step 4. See Figure 6-11. (If you don’t feel comfortable cutting
free-hand, mark each of the cuts with tailor’s chalk prior to cutting.)
3. Second cut. Cut lengthwise from the center of the top back piece, up
through the collar. Cut the collar off with a scoop at the neck as shown
in Figure 6-12.

4. Third cut — making dangles. Cut off the underarm seam, from armpit
down to the hem of the sleeve. Then continue the cut from the shoulder
(Step 2) through the material in a spiral, creating a long dangling strap
for your halter top. Do this on each side. See Figure 6-13.
5. Try it on. Put your T-shirt halter on, tying the dangles behind your neck
comfortably. Is the collar too tight or too high on your neck? If so, cut off
more fabric in front of the neck, using Figure 6-14 as a guide.
If you started out with a T-shirt that fit well, the halter top should fit
well. If it does not, you can use the same techniques for fitting a too-
small or too-big skirt in the project earlier in this chapter, “Upside-
Down Skirt in a Topsy-Turvy World.”
6. Repair. Refer to Chapter 4 to repair any tears, holes, and stains as needed.

• Sewing by machine-for a rough look: Zigzag stitch all cut edges
with a 1⁄4-inch seam allowance.
• Sewing with an overlock for a rougher look: Serge all cut edges
with a 1⁄4-inch seam allowance.
Instead of sewing a finished hem, you can use no-sew hem tape. This

sew deco: You can find instructions for these options in the “Variations”
section for the “Upside-Down Skirt in a Topsy-Turvy World” project ear-
lier in this chapter. 
 More dangles: Get creative with Step 4. Cut multiple dangles, either
along the length of the strap or from the point where it attaches to 
the body of the halter top. Sew on more scraps of fabric for even more
dangles! See Figure 6-16 for ideas.
 Necklines: Alter your neckline by altering the cut line, adding more

Chapter 6: Transforming T-shirts

Directions
There are three waistbands presented in this project: an elasticized waist-
band, a drawstring waistband, and a stretchy fabric waistband. All are easy
but depend highly on the material and your method of sewing. The elasti-
cized waistband and drawstring waistband can be done with any method 
of sewing and any type of T-shirt fabric. The stretchy waistband can only be
done with an overlock machine and with stretchy fabric. Read the instruc-
tions thoroughly prior to starting to make sure that you are choosing a pro-
ject that works for you.
Elasticized waistbands
1. Cut. Cut a 3-inch strip across the T-shirt, yielding a tube of T-shirt mater-
ial 3 inches wide.
2. Fold. Fold this piece in half, raw edges together, resulting a folded tube
piece of 11⁄2 inches wide.
3. Pin. Pin the two layers of this piece together, with the pins placed 
perpendicular to and 1 inch in from the folded edge.
4. Sew. Refer to Chapter 5 for instructions on hand sewing. Using a running
stitch (hand sewing) or a zigzag stitch (machine sewing), sew the waist 1
inch from the folded edge. 
5. Insert elastic. Cut a small 1⁄2-inch slit into the inside of the waistband. Pin
a safety pin to the end of the elastic. Insert the elastic, using the safety
pin as a needle to guide the elastic through the waistband. When you
reach the other end, pin them together, making sure that the elastic lies
flat within the waistband.
Tie a knot in the end of the elastic to be sure it doesn’t slip through.
6. Fit. Try on the waistband. Cinch the elastic to a tightness that is com-
fortable for you. Pin the elastic together at this point. 
7. Sew. Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques. Using a running
stitch, hand-stitch the elastic together where it is pinned. Cut off any
extra length. Blanket stitch the slit you cut in Step 5.
Drawstring waistbands
1. Refer to Steps 1 through 4 in the earlier section “Elasticized waistbands.” 
2. For Step 5, cut two slits in the outside of the waistband, 1 inch apart
from each other. 
3. Blanket stitch around the edges of each of these slits from Step 3. 
4. Thread the drawstring as described in Step 5 of “Elasticized waist-
bands,” starting it through one hole and bringing it out the second hole.
104
Part II: Shirts: Sluggish to Spectacular 

Stretchy waistbands
Stretchy waistbands can only be done with an overlock machine. They require
fabric that stretches along the width. Old workout tops are great for this!
1. Cut. Cut the entire shirt horizontally, from armpit to armpit. You will 
be using the bottom piece for your waistband. It should be at least 
6 inches long. 
2. Fit. Try on the waistband. If it is too big, cinch it to a tightness that is
comfortable for you. Pin it together at this point. Remove the waistband
and serge a seam along the length at this point, removing pins as you go.
3. Fold. Fold this piece in half, raw edges together.
4. Sew. Serge the raw edges of the waistband directly onto your garment.

Redefining Boring Button-downs
In This Chapter
 Caring for and handling of your button-down
 Making multiple items from a single shirt
B
utton-downs are plentiful in thrift shops. Most are men’s style, although
there are some tailored versions for women in fewer numbers. Many of
the button-downs that I have come across are fairly standard and downright
boring. On occasion, especially in more vintage-oriented thrift stores, you
can find some fabulous colors, interesting collars, and other detail work. But
for the most part, they are white, or at least they used to be. 
In this chapter, you can find solutions and salvation for button-downs in any
condition. Creative accessories for the neck and wrists make use of one part
of the shirt, while the remaining body of the shirt can be paired with a
sweater for a unique twist on the boring old button-down. 
Prepping, Primping, and Post 
Care for Your Button-downs
Button-downs are generally cotton and thus wash just fine in the washing
machine. Check the laundering label and wash the shirt prior to your recon-
struction project, being sure to take special spot-cleaning care of “the usual
suspects” listed below. If your label is missing, refer to Chapter 4 for guide-
lines on when to have the shirt professionally cleaned. You can also play it
safe by washing your shirt in cold water on the gentle cycle and laying it flat
to dry.
Personally, I’m very picky about starting with items in good condition, partic-
ularly when it comes to body stains. Button-downs are generally low on my
list of “good finds” in respect to this. It’s difficult to find one that doesn’t have
these usual suspects but most of the projects in this chapter are very forgiv-
ing of these things. Still, be aware of these common flaws and choose within
your comfort zone.

Always check for these common button-down flaws:
 Armpit and collar stains
 Stains and other wear and tear on the cuffs
 Torn underarm seams
Refer to Chapter 4 for what to look for and how to make it work for you. Some
button-downs do well with just a bit of patching and sprucing up with some
decorative stitching. If it has a decent shape, consider this an option.
Busting Out the Neck Bustles
The neck bustle was requested by a friend and fellow shop-owner in San
Francisco. We both adore a romantic aesthetic, expressing the strength, 
mystery, and beauty of women. Bustling is a vision of elegance and decorum
that has gone lacking in our current society. I love bringing back the bustle in
whatever way that I can. Sometimes it takes on a more traditional form with a
modern functionality (Detachable Bustles in Chapter 9), and other times it’s
much more subtle (Tails of Two Crops in Chapter 8.)
This project can vary in difficulty, depending on whether you keep it simple
or dive into decorating with the variations. Generally it involves removal of
the collar from the button-down, finishing the edges and decorating it! 
Check out the button-down prior to reconstruction in Figure 7-1.

Re-addressing the business dress code!
Men just don’t have a lot of options, especially
when it comes to dressing for business. I seem
to have a fair amount of friends these days who
are leaving their desk jobs to pursue a career
that is more devoted to their art. In the midst of
this shift, they are left with clothes, particularly
button-downs, that have absolutely no use to
them in the outside world. With just a quick trip
under the sewing machine needle, they are fit
for viewing in a whole new light. This trick, that
ironically I refer to as “tricking out,” allows for
individuality to be expressed while still retain-
ing some semblance of professionalism.

Materials
 Button-down
 Safety pins
 Common pins
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with a laundry marker)
 Tape measure
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread that matches the button-down 
 Scissors
Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your button-down according to the label instruc-
tions, or have it professionally cleaned if there’s no label.
2. Mark and cut. Turn up the collar of your button-down. Locate the seam
of the collar with the body of the shirt. Using your tape measure, mea-
sure 11⁄2 inches from the seam into the body of the shirt. Mark this point
with your tailor’s chalk. Repeat this measurement every 1–2 inches
around the collar in order to mark an even cut line. Connect the dots
with your tailor’s chalk. Cut along this line. Refer to Figure 7-2.
Save the cuffs for projects later in this chapter, and save the scrap of 
the shirt body as a case for Save-It-All Stuffing or Making a Case for
Pillowcases, both in Chapter 18.

3. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock machine. 
• Sewing by hand — for a clean look: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-
sewing techniques. Hem the cut edge using the quick hem technique.
• Sewing by machine — for a rough look: Zigzag stitch the entire
cut edge with a 1⁄4-inch seam allowance.
• Sewing with an overlock — for a rougher look: Serge the entire
cut edge with a 1⁄4-inch seam allowance.
Instead of sewing a finished hem, you can use no-sew hem tape. This
tape is just ironed on! You can find it in your local fabric or craft store,
online, or even in major supermarkets and department stores.

Variations
For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas:
 Bias tape: Instead of hemming the edge or leaving it rough, you 
can cover it with a decorative bias tape. This can be found in 
any sewing goods or fabric store, usually near the zippers in the 
Notions area. Bias tape comes in a variety of colors and can be 
either hand sewn or machine sewn on to cover the edge (instructions 
on package).
 More ruffling: Cut further away from the collar for a longer ruffle.
 Thick stitches: Complete all stitching by hand sewing with embroidery
floss.
 Thicker stitches: Hand sewing over pre-sewn and secured edges with
yarn or ribbon.
 Mix colors: Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements the
color of the shirt. With a sewing machine you can also use a different
color for the bobbin thread. With an overlock machine, you can get
really creative and use four to five different colors.
 Stitching everywhere: Decoratively stitch on the neck bustle, marking
with tailor’s chalk first if necessary. Decorative stitches include embroi-
dery or deco stitches on your machine (see Figure 7-4).
 Buttons: Sew decorative buttons onto the neck bustle. This is a great
way to make use of those odds and ends buttons. Keep within a color
scheme, or within a certain style (art deco, fabric, glass, carved) for a
complete look.
 No-sew deco techniques: You can leave the edge completely unstitched
and raw. Running it through the washer and dryer will help the edges
fray and bind together to complete the “unfinished” look. Some other
no-sew ideas include hot gluing items (nonwashable), painting, grom-
meting, riveting, bedazzling, dyeing, drawing with fabric markers or even
sharpie markers. Make stripes on your neck bustle with gaffer’s or mask-
ing tape. Spray a light coat of spray paint over it, let dry and remove the
tape to reveal super-hot stripes! 
Of course, constructing the neck bustle is one thing . . . wearing it is another.
See Figure 7-5 for how to wear a neck bustle.

Bridging the Sweater Gap Top
This project recycles two pieces into one. Sometimes things have unfixable
flaws in certain areas, but in chopping them up and putting them together
you can make good use of both!
The Bridging the Sweater Gap project utilizes the body of the button-down
and pairs it with the sleeves and other parts of a cardigan sweater. It’s great
as a cozy piece on its own, and even better for layering under a coat. It
reduces the bulk of wearing a full sweater, while keeping you warm in all 
the right places.

Chapter 7: Redefining Boring Button-downs

Materials
 Button-down that fits well
 Cardigan sweater with long sleeves
 Common pins
 Safety pins
 Tape measure
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread that matches the button-down
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Scissors
Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your button-down and sweater according to the
label instructions, or have it professionally cleaned if there’s no label.
2. Mark the cut line for the cardigan. Lie your cardigan flat. Using it as a
straight-edge, run your tape measure from armpit to armpit. Mark this
line with your tailor’s chalk. Measure the sleeve length, marking the
point 14 inches from the cuff. Mark a line at this point that runs parallel
to the cuff. Refer to Figure 7-8.

3. Mark the cut line for the button-down. Measure and mark the sleeve
length of the button-down as you did for the cardigan. Refer to Figure 7-8.
4. Secure edges of cardigan. Refer to Running Wild in Chapter 12 and
hand-baste or zigzag machine stitch on each side of the cut lines to 
prevent runs.
5. Cut. Cut the material along the lines you just made with the tailor’s chalk.
Save your cardigan scrap for a choker chop-up in Chapter 20. Save your
button-down sleeves for the cuff projects later in this chapter.  
6. Fit and pin the sleeve. Turn the button-down inside out. Place the 
cardigan sleeves (right side out) inside the sleeves of the button-down,
aligning the cut edges and underarm seams (see Figure 7-9).
Does your cardigan sleeve fit perfectly inside your button-down sleeve?
Can it be stretched so that the two fabrics lie flat against each other? If
the answer is “yes,” continue pinning it every 1 inch and then proceed to
Step 7. If not, see either of the following steps depending on your partic-
ular circumstance:
1. Fitting a “too big button-down”: If the button-down is too big,
gather the extra fabric within an inch around the folded point you
pinned in Step 6.
2. Fitting a “too big cardigan”: If the cardigan sleeve is too big, you
have two choices. You can make it more narrow by taking it in,
being sure to secure the stitches of the knit (Running Wild, Chapter
12). An easier method is to unpin the cut edge, flip the cardigan
sleeve around and re-pin (Step 6) at the cuff edge.

Chapter 7: Redefining Boring Button-downs

If you flip the cardigan sleeve around you will have a cut edge of
sweater at the new cuff. Finish this edge in the same manner
described in Step 6 for the Bad Unkl Sista Sweater in Chapter 12.
7. Fit and pin the collar. Lay your button-down flat. Lay the body of the
cardigan above it, cut edge closest to the button-down collar. Locate the
button side of the button-down collar. Pin the corresponding cut edge
corner of the cardigan to the base of the collar at the button side.
Continue to pin the cut edge of the cardigan around the base of the
button-down collar. Let the remaining part of the cardigan hang free.
Refer to Figure 7-10.
For this project, you can not use an overlock machine to adhere the
cardigan to the collar of the button-down. But it is useful to serge the cut
edge of the body of the cardigan before pinning it to the button-down
collar. This will help prevent runs in the knit.  
8. Repair. Refer to Chapter 4 to repair any tears, holes, and stains as
needed.
9. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method.
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Running stitch the edge of the button-down collar to the cardigan
as shown in Figure 7-11. Blanket stitch the free hanging cut edge of
the cardigan. Hem this free hanging piece using the quick hem
technique. Blanket stitch the pinned seam on each sleeve, securing
the cardigan sleeve to the button-down.

• Sewing by machine: Zigzag stitch the edge of the button-down
collar to the cardigan as shown in Figure 7-11. Continue this zigzag
stitch along the free hanging cut edge of the cardigan. Hem this
free hanging piece using the quick hem described in Chapter 5.
Zigzag stitch the pinned seam on each sleeve. 
• Sewing with an overlock: You cannot adhere the collar using an
overlock machine. You must use either the hand or machine-
sewing techniques described above. Be sure to serge the cut edge
of the cardigan body before pinning and sewing it. This will secure
the knit, including the free hanging piece. Serge the pinned seam
on each sleeve, removing the pins before running it through the
machine.

Chapter 7: Redefining Boring Button-downs

Variations
For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas:
 Raw look: For external seams, skip Step 6, keeping the button-down
right side out, and turn the cardigan sleeve inside out instead.
 Bias tape: Instead of hemming the edge or leaving it raw, you can cover
it with a decorative bias tape. This can be found in any sewing goods 
or fabric store, usually near the zippers in the Notions area. Bias tape
comes in a variety of colors and can be either hand sewn or machine
sewn on to cover the edge (instructions on package).
 Thick stitches: Hand sewing with embroidery floss.
 Thicker stitches: Hand sewing over secured edge with yarn or ribbon.
 Mix colors: Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements the
color of the button-down or cardigan. With a sewing machine you can
also use a different color for the bobbin thread. With an overlock
machine, you can get really creative and use four to five different colors.
Getting Crafty With Cuffs
Cuffs are a great accessory for both men and women. Reconstructing them in
this way is not only affordable, but personal and completely unique! You can
stud it with rivets for a businessman gone bad-boy look; or embroider it with
rosettes for your sweet grandmother. I like to layer cuffs over other sleeves,
such as the Sleek ’n’ Sneaky Sleeves in Chapter 13. However, cuffs are just as
good on their own, worn as a set, two on one wrist or just a solo cuff on one
wrist as you would typically wear a watch or bracelet.
Preciously Painted Cuffs
These painted cuffs are a great project for nonsewers. The minimal sewing
involved can easily be replaced by no-sew hem tape or by just leaving a raw
edge! Years ago I actually used to seal my raw edges by painting them. The
look is hot, but sacrifices some comfort as painted edges are often a bit
scratchy!
This project is very easy. All you have to do is cut the cuff from the button-
down, finish the cut edge and decorate. Being such a small project, this one is
great for parties and crafty get-togethers! Have everyone bring an old button-
down and random craft supplies (have the essentials stocked up). Throw it
all in a big heap, put on some music, and have a blast.

I have witnessed a few near-misses when mixing finger-foods and craft sup-
plies in the same area. People get really focused and next thing you know
someone has a mouthful of yarn. Be careful!
Check out the button-down prior to reconstruction in Figure 7-13.

 Fabric paint
Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your button-down according to the label instruc-
tions, or have it professionally cleaned if there’s no label.
2. Mark and cut. Locate the seam of the cuff with the sleeve of the button-
down. Using your tape measure, measure 11⁄2 inches from the seam into
the body of the shirt. Mark this point with your tailor’s chalk. Repeat this
measurement every 1–2 inches around the cuff in order to mark an even
cut line. Connect the dots with your tailor’s chalk. Cut along this line.

3. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock machine.

cut edge with a 1⁄4-inch seam allowance.
• Sewing with an overlock — for a rougher look: Serge the entire
cut edge with a 1⁄4-inch seam allowance.
4. Paint. Using your brush and fabric paint, paint your design onto the cuff.
I like to do abstract and asymmetric designs freehand. You can buy or
make your own stencils as well. Paper doilies also make a great stencil
to achieve a lace-like effect. 
Pay attention to the instructions on the paint. Some paints need to be heat
set and others are fine without setting.

spray paint. Use repeated coats for a darker shade, letting the cuff dry
completely in between. Other paint ideas include fabric paint pens, puffy
paints and other craft paints in applicator tubes, stamping and emboss-
ing (you will need a heat gun for this).
Buttoned-Up Bracelets
Buttoned-up Bracelets, like Preciously Painted Cuffs (see the project earlier
in this chapter), is a fun and easy project to do with friends. This project can
be a little more difficult because it requires a fair bit of hand sewing, but gen-
erally this project is impossible to screw up!

 Thread that matches the button-down
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Scissors

Directions
1. Prep and then some! Follow Steps 1 through 3 for Preciously Painted
Cuffs (see project earlier in this chapter). 
2. Choose and place buttons. Some ideas for decorating with buttons
include keeping to a color theme (such as a particular color and its
shades, warm tones, cool tones) or within a certain style (such as art
deco, fabric, glass, antique.) Lay your cuff flat. Arrange buttons as you
would like them sewn onto the cuff. Slide them off the cuff, keeping 
them in place.
If you have a digital camera, take a photo of the arrangement on the cuff.
If you have a good view window, you won’t even need to load the photo
onto the computer to view it for reference when you are sewing the but-
tons on.

3. Sew. Using a hand needle and matching thread, sew buttons in place.
Since these buttons are not functional, you can get away with a quick
trick. Thread two lengths of thread through the needle, doubling it over
so that you are sewing with four strands. With such a thickness, you
only need to make one or two passes through the button to secure it. 
Check out the button-down after reconstruction in Figure 7-16. 
Variations
For a decorative effect, refer to the Variations for the preceding project,

Chapter 8
Pullover Overhaul
In This Chapter
 Prepping before cutting, cropping, wrapping, and twisting
 Picking out a good one
 Sealing up the loose ends in your wardrobe
P
ullovers come in all types, shapes, and sizes. They range from a long
sleeved T-shirt to a velvet holiday top to a near sweater-like ribbed
turtleneck. All of these have a use that is far better than filling the garbage
can, and all of them can be incorporated into the projects in this chapter. 
No fear, the solution to your overflowing closet is here!
For me, pullovers tend to be a staple item worn often with lots of different
variations and layers. Thus, being worn often, it shows wear and becomes
stale more quickly than other things. This chapter will provide you with 
solutions to alleviate any feelings of mediocrity in your pullover.
These projects include several variations of fun crops as well as a wrap to
layer over the pullovers you have yet to reconstruct. The All-Season Crop is 
a basic crop while the Crop Inversion gives a little more coverage, as well as
making good use of the entire pullover. Let your creativity shine with Tails 
of Two Crops, a crop with a bit more to flaunt in the back. A Wrap to Write
Home About is a simple way to convert your pullover into something you 
can throw on and fun-up just about anything. 
Prepping, Primping, and Post 
Care for Your Pullover 
Pullovers can vary widely in fabric content and construction. Check the 
laundering label and wash it prior to your reconstruction project. If your
label is missing, play it safe by washing in cold water on the gentle cycle 
and no dryer! Refer to Chapter 4 for guidelines of when to have it profession-
ally cleaned.

The usual suspects
Depending on the style of the pullover and where you got it, you can expect
some typical wear and tear trends. Check it over thoroughly in order to
determine whether it’s perfect, needs some repairs, or if it’s just too much 
to salvage.
Always check for these common pullover flaws:
 Stains and other wear and tear on the cuffs 
 Armpit stains
 Collar stains
 Spill stains. These are usually on the front of the pullover, but you also
might find some around the hip area where someone might have a habit
of wiping their hands (ew!!!)
 Fraying or torn hems at collar, cuff and bottom hem
 Torn underarm seam
Circumventing circumstantial 
stains and such
Stains and such flaws might be the downfall of your beloved pullover in its
current state of affairs. But when reconstructing, these things serve as divine
inspiration! Pullovers are very similar to T-shirts in regards to ways to fix up
flaws. Refer to Chapter 4 for details and ideas on this.
Running Circles Around Crop Tops
I am a big fan of crop tops layered over longer, more tailored or snug-fit tops.
They are also great over vintage slips and similar styled slim-fit and mid-
length dresses. This allows for extra warmth and style without adding extra
bulk to your mid-section.
All-Season Crop Top
The All-Season Crop is a basic cropped version of your existing pullover. 
I started making these as an active pedestrian in the cold Boston winter.
Merely walking a few blocks on the snow-laden sidewalks was sometimes 
126
Part II: Shirts: Sluggish to Spectacular 

a major hiking expedition! Such a workout while wearing my warm winter
duds often resulted in a lovely “drowned rat” look by the time I finally made it
to my destination. By cropping my sweater, I was able to easily take it off and
tie it onto the straps of my bag. My other favorite option was to pull it over
my head while leaving the sleeves on to form a sort of “shrug.” 
This project is a cinch. All you have to do it cut your pullover short and finish
the cut edge. Voila! You’re a reconstruction genius!
Check out the pullover prior to reconstruction in Figure 8-1.

Chapter 8: Pullover Overhaul

Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your pullover according to the label instructions, or
have it professionally cleaned if there’s no label.
2. Identify the cut line. For most women, a flattering length for crops is 
1 inch below the lowest border of the breast. Some men can pull off the
cropped look as well, particularly with slim-fit pullovers. My personal
preference for men is to go shorter, at least one inch above the nipple
line, which sometimes requires the cut line to arch up from the under-
arm seam. Refer to Figure 8-2. To help determine where your cut line
should be, put the pullover on and mark the desired length with a safety
pin. Take the pullover off. Add another inch to this length, moving the
safety pin down an inch, in order to account for the hem.
If you are unsure of how long to make your crop, err on the longer side.
You can always cut off more fabric and make it shorter. However, if you
cut it too short, it’s not so easy to make it long again.
3. Mark the cut line. Using your tape measure, measure the length from
the bottom of the pullover to the safety pin. Note this length, and mark
this point with tailor’s chalk. Measure and mark the pullover every 5
inches along the bottom of the pullover. Connect the dots made by the
tailor’s chalk to draw a straight horizontal line.
4. Cut. Cut the material along the line you just made with the tailor’s chalk.
Save your scrap for extra frill in the Upside-Down Skirt in a Topsy-Turvy
World project in Chapter 6, or Quintessential Quilt pieces in Chapter 18.
5. Repair. Refer to Chapter 4 to repair any tears, holes, and stains as
needed.

6. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock machine. 
• Sewing by hand — for a clean look: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-
sewing techniques. Hem the cut edge using the quick hem technique.
• Sewing by machine — for a rough look: Cut 3⁄4 inches off the bottom
edge. Zigzag stitch the cut edge with a 1⁄4-inch seam allowance. 
• Sewing with an overlock — for a rougher look: Cut 3⁄4 inches off
the bottom edge. Serge the cut edge with a 1⁄4-inch seam allowance.
Instead of sewing a finished hem, you can use no-sew hem tape. This
tape is just ironed on! You can find it in your local fabric or craft store,
online, or even in major supermarkets and department stores.
Check out the pullover after reconstruction in Figure 8-3.
Variations
For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas:
 Raw look: You can also get a rough look by cutting off the extra inch of
fabric and blanket-stitching the cut edge.
 Bias tape: Instead of hemming the edge or leaving it raw, you can cover
it with a decorative bias tape. This can be found in any sewing goods or
fabric store, usually near the zippers in the Notions area. Bias tape
comes in a variety of colors and can be either hand-sewn or machine-
sewn on to cover the edge (instructions on package).

Chapter 8: Pullover Overhaul

 Flared edge: When machine or overlock sewing, gently stretch the
fabric as it is feeding into the machine for a flared edge. 
It is important not to pull too hard when stretching the fabric or you 
will break a needle. This trick is for experienced sewers who are very
familiar with the feeding of their machine. Refer to your sewing manual
for tips on your machine’s capacity to create this flared edge on its own
(in other words, differential feeding mechanism on some overlock
machines).
 Thick stitches: Complete all stitching by hand sewing with embroidery
floss.
 Thicker stitches: Hand sewing over pre-sewn and secured edges with
yarn or ribbon.
 Mix colors: Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements the
color of the pullover. With a sewing machine you can also use a different
color for the bobbin thread. With an overlock machine, you can get
really creative and use four to five different colors.
 Stitching everywhere: Decoratively stitch other areas of the crop, mark-
ing with tailor’s chalk first if necessary. Decorative stitches include
embroidery or deco-stitches on your machine
 Buttons: Sew decorative buttons onto the edge or neckline of the crop.
This is a great way to make use of those odds and ends buttons. Keep
within a color scheme, or within a certain style (art deco, fabric, glass,
carved) for a complete look.
 No-sew deco techniques: You can leave the edge completely unstitched
and raw. Running it through the washer and dryer will help the edges
fray and bind together to complete the “unfinished” look. Some other
no-sew ideas include creatively cutting the bottom edge, hot-gluing
items (nonwashable), painting, grommeting, riveting, bedazzling, dyeing,
drawing with fabric markers or even a sharpie marker. Use a heat gun to
seal raw edges (for synthetic fabrics), referring to the instructions on
the heat gun project in Chapter 15. Make stripes on your crop with
gaffer’s or masking tape. Spray a light coat of spray paint over it, let dry
and repeat until you get the desired color saturation. Remove the tape
to reveal super-hot stripes! 
Crop Inversion Top
The Crop Inversion project is a nice way to add some dimension and warmth
to your crop. Essentially, the body of the pullover becomes a cowl neck. If
your pullover is long, the neckline might even extend far enough to become 
a hood!
130
Part II: Shirts: Sluggish to Spectacular 

This project is just a bit more difficult than the All-Season Crop, taking just a
wee little bit of measuring skill and patience to fit the neckline in just right. 
Check out the pullover prior to reconstruction in Figure 8-4.
Materials
 Pullover that fits well 
 Common pins
 Safety pins
 Tape measure
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread that matches the pullover
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Scissors
Directions
1. Prep and then some! Follow Steps 1 through 4 for the All-Season Crop
project. Hold off on any repairs and save your scrap piece.
2. Measure. Using your tape measure, measure the circumference of the
neckline. Measure the circumference of the scrap piece of the body.
Refer to Figure 8-5.
Figure 8-4:

Chapter 8: Pullover Overhaul

3. Design decision. Can the body of the pullover fit into the neckline as it
is? In other words, is the circumference measurement of the neckline
equal to the circumference measurement of the body? Can the neckline
be stretched to the circumference measurement of the body? If the
answer is “no,” get out your scissors and follow Step 1 below. If the
answer is “yes,” proceed to Step 2 below.
Always make the neckline bigger when you are starting with a turtle-
neck, mock turtleneck, or other neckline that fits tight to the base of
your neck. 
1. Cut. Cut open the neckline by making it wider and lower in the
front. Use Figure 8-6 as a guide.
Save this little scrap for From Garbage to Gorgeous in Chapter 20.
Be conservative! You can always cut more to make the neckline
bigger, but if you cut too much you’ll be stuck with an off-the-
shoulder 80’s version of the All Season Crop.
2. Turn it out. Turn the pullover inside out. Keep the scrap piece
from the body right side out.

4. Finding centers. Fold the neckline of the pullover in half, lining up the
shoulder seams. The folds designate the center front and center back of
the pullover. Fold the body of the pullover in the same manner, lining up
the side seams. Mark the centers with tailor’s chalk.
I like to mark the centers by putting a safety pin in at each folded edge.
Just make sure to remove the safety pins before sewing!
5. Line up. Place the body inside the crop so that the right sides are facing
each other. Line up the centers.
6. Pin. Pin the center front of the neckline to the center front of the body. Pin
the center back of the neckline to the center back of the body. Refer to
Figure 8-7 for a schematic of this process. Be sure to place pins perpendic-
ular to the cut edge and continue pinning every 1 inch along the edge.
7. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock machine. 
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Blanket stitch the entire cut edge, attaching the neckline to the
body. Hem the cut edge using the quick hem technique. Turn the
crop right-side-out.
• Sewing by machine: Zigzag stitch the entire cut edge, attaching
the neckline to the body. Hem the cut edge using the quick hem
technique described in Chapter 5 (hand sewing). Turn the crop
right-side out. 
Use a zigzag as opposed to a straight stitch so that the neckline
can stretch a bit. 
• Sewing with an overlock: Serge the entire cut edge, attaching 
the neckline to the body. Hem the cut edge using the quick hem
technique described in Chapter 5 (hand sewing.) Turn the crop
right-side out.

• No sew: Instead of sewing a finished hem, you can use no-sew hem
tape. This tape is just ironed on! You can find it in your local fabric
or craft store, online, or even in major supermarkets and depart-
ment stores. 
8. Repair. Refer to Chapter 4 to repair any tears, holes, and stains as needed.
Check out the pullover after reconstruction in Figure 8-8.
Variations
For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas:
 Raw look: For external seams, keep the pullover right side out in Step 5
and turn the body of the pullover inside out instead. Instead of finishing
the edge with a hem, leave out this step and blanket stitch (hand
sewing), zigzag stitch (machine sewing) or serge the edge (overlock) 
for a raw finish.

In a pinch!
Okay, I know this is a little gross but it works.
When marking spots that don’t have to be exact,
such as the neckline centers for the Crop
Inversion, you can use what nature gave you,
your saliva. Especially when folding edges like
this, it’s easy and quick to just take the fabric
between your teeth and wet it a bit to mark the
spot. It’s marked with both the wetness, which
often darkens the fabric, and sometimes even
holds the fold where you held it in your teeth. 

 Bias tape: Instead of hemming the edge or leaving it raw, you can cover
it with a decorative bias tape. This can be found in any sewing goods 
or fabric store, usually near the zippers in the Notions area. Bias tape
comes in a variety of colors and can be either hand-sewn or machine-
sewn on to cover the edge (instructions on package).
 Flared edge: When machine or overlock sewing, gently stretch the
fabric as it is feeding into the machine for a flared edge. 
It is important not to pull too hard when stretching the fabric or you will
break a needle. This trick is for experienced sewers who are very famil-
iar with the feeding of their machine. Refer to your sewing manual for
tips on your machine’s capacity to create this flared edge on its own 
(as in, differential feeding mechanism on some overlock machines).
 Thick stitches: Complete all stitching by hand sewing with embroidery
floss.
 Thicker stitches: Hand sewing over pre-sewn and secured edges with
yarn or ribbon
 Mix colors: Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements the
color of the pullover. With a sewing machine you can also use a different
color for the bobbin thread. With an overlock machine, you can get
really creative and use four to five different colors.
 Stitching everywhere: Decoratively stitch other areas of the crop, 
marking with tailor’s chalk first if necessary. Decorative stitches include
embroidery or deco stitches on your machine
 Buttons: Sew decorative buttons onto the edge or neckline of the crop.
This is a great way to make use of those odds and ends buttons. Keep
within a color scheme, or within a certain style (art deco, fabric, glass,
carved) for a complete look.
 No-sew deco techniques: You can leave the edge completely unstitched
and raw. Running it through the washer and dryer will help the edges
fray and bind together to complete the “unfinished” look. Some other
no-sew ideas include creatively cutting the bottom edge, hot-gluing
items (non-washable), painting, grommeting, riveting, bedazzling,
dyeing, drawing with fabric markers or even a sharpie marker. Use a
heat gun to seal raw edges (for synthetic fabrics), referring to the
instructions on the heat gun project in Chapter 15. Make stripes on your
crop with gaffer’s or masking tape. Spray a light coat of spray paint over
it, let dry and repeat until you get the desired color saturation. Remove
the tape to reveal super-hot stripes!

Chapter 8: Pullover Overhaul

Tails of Two Crops Top
This is a really fun top for those who prefer a little more flair in their wardrobe.
It’s also a fun piece to get creative with, both in its construction, as well as the
various ways to wear it! The basic shape is cropped in the front, with the
remaining fabric left dangling in the back for a bustling or tailed effect.
This project is fairly easy. It requires a lot of tedious finishing of edges,
depending on how intricate your cut line is. Otherwise, the most difficult
component of it is getting over the fear of screwing up the cut line.
You cannot screw up the creative process. Go for it and accept the result
gracefully. If you hate it, you can always reconstruct it into something else!
Check out the pullover prior to reconstruction in Figure 8-9.
Materials
 Pullover
 Common pins
 Safety pins
 Tape measure
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread that matches the pullover
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Scissors

Part II: Shirts: Sluggish to Spectacular 

Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your pullover according to the label instructions, or
have it professionally cleaned if there’s no label.
2. Identify the cut line. For most women, a flattering length for crops is 1
inch below the lowest border of the breast. To help determine where
your cut line should be, put the pullover on and mark the desired length
with a safety pin. Take the pullover off. Add another inch to this length,
moving the safety pin down an inch, in order to account for the hem. 
If you are unsure of how long to make your crop, err on the longer side.
You can always cut off more fabric and make it shorter. However, if you
cut it too short, it’s not so easy to make it long again.
3. Mark the cut line on the front of the pullover. Using your tape mea-
sure, measure the length from the bottom of the pullover to the safety
pin. Note this length, and mark this point with tailor’s chalk. Measure
and mark the pullover every 5 inches along the bottom of the pullover.
Do this only across the front of the pullover. Connect the dots made by
the tailor’s chalk to draw a straight horizontal line.
4. Mark the cut line on the back of the pullover. Refer to Figure 8-10 for
sample cut lines. Mark your desired cut line with your tailor’s chalk.
5. Cut. Cut the material along the chalk line you just made with the 
tailor’s chalk.
Save your scraps for the Bare and Flare Skirt in Chapter 11, or sew them
onto your tails before finishing the edges to get more frills!
6. Repair. Refer to Chapter 4 to repair any tears, holes and stains as
needed

or craft store, online, or even in major supermarkets and depart-
ment stores.
• Sewing by machine — for a rough look: Cut 3⁄4 inches off the 
front bottom edge. Zigzag stitch the cut edge with a 1⁄4-inch seam
allowance. 
• Sewing with an overlock — for a rougher look: Cut 3⁄4 inches off
the front bottom edge. Serge the cut edge with a 1⁄4-inch seam
allowance.
Check out in the pullover after reconstruction in Figure 8-11.
Variations
For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas:

 Get creative with the cut line: While Figure 8-10 gives you an idea for
the cut line, feel free to experiment with your own ideas. Get creative
with curves and other shapes, as well as the placement of the dangling
tails of your pullover.
 More frill: Add more length and frill to your tails by adding scraps of
material prior to finishing the edges.
 Thick stitches: Complete all stitching by hand sewing with embroidery
floss.
 Thicker stitches: Hand sewing over pre-sewn and secured edges with
yarn or ribbon.

swing to the motion of the tails. This is a great way to make use of those
odds and ends buttons. Keep within a color scheme, or within a certain

Wrap to Write Home About
Some pullovers, while great in so many ways, just get boring after a while.
Turning your pullover into a wrap is a fantastic way to give it new life. Wraps
are a wonderful way to spruce up an outfit, adding just a bit more warmth
and coziness. Depending on the fabric and style of your original pullover, this
can be a rather elegant piece suitable for a fancy dinner, or it can be casual
enough for the gym.

In this part . . .
I
n Part III, I delve into the dilemma of old pants. Be 
it tears, bad pleats, or the workout pants you never
wear . . . you can find the solution for these pant problems
right here!
Do you have a tendency to work your butt off, or party it
off for that matter? Your pants can have a second life with
some quick repair tricks, or a full overhaul. You can find
lots of options in these projects.

Chapter 9
Basic Slacks Brought Back
In This Chapter
 Caring for your pants
 Watching out for pant problems
 Exploring a plethora of projects
P
ants get a lot of wear. Unfortunately, they’re not so forgiving when it
comes to wear and tear. While we can skin the knees of jeans and con-
tinue to wear them, slacks just can’t swing it. But that doesn’t mean their life
is over just yet! The projects in this chapter range from creative repair, to a
bevy of skirts to a combo piece that will bust your mind wide open!
Prepping, Primping, and 
Post Care for Your Pants
Pants vary widely in their fabric content. Check the laundering label and
wash prior to your project. If your label is missing, refer to Chapter 4 for
guidelines of when to have it professionally cleaned, and when it might be
safe to just gentle wash it in cold water and dry flat (no dryer).
The usual suspects
The biggest flaw for pants is often the fit and style, particularly in the waist.
Start with pants that fit well, and use those that don’t for the Detachable
Bustle and Surprise Fly Top, as well as for the extra fabric for the So Easy
Split Skirt. All of these projects can be found later in this chapter.

Always check for these common flaws in pants:
 Torn inseam (crotch), rear end and knees
 Stains and other wear and tear on the cuffs
 Stains on the knees and rear end (be sure to check inside too)
 Broken zipper, missing snap, button or other closure
 Bad pleats. Yes, this is a flaw in my book!
Wearing to watch out for
Refer to Chapter 4 for ways to make the wear and tear work for you. Some
pants do well with just a bit of patching and decorative stitching, such as 
discussed in Renaissance Repairs. Others, particularly those with issues in
the rear end, are best left for scrap additions for other projects such as those
discussed in Part VI.
Renaissance Repairs Pants
I can’t even begin to count the number of people who have come to me,
sometimes near tears, telling me about how much they love a certain pair of
pants but have worn them to the point of mutilation, Velveteen Rabbit-style. 
This project can be difficult depending on the location of the worn spot. It is
important to realize that this is a visible repair job turned decorative. 
Check out the pants prior to reconstruction in Figure 9-1.
Materials
 Pants
 Stretchy fabric large enough to cover the tear and/or worn spot
 Common pins
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread that matches the pants
 Scissors

Part III: Breathing Life into Dead Pants 

Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your pants according to the label instructions, or
have them professionally cleaned if there’s no label. Turn the pants
inside-out and lie flat so that the worn spot is fully visible.
2. Cut. Cut a patch of stretchy fabric to completely cover the tear and/or
worn spot. It should be at least an inch larger than any visible tear.
It’s best to orient the fabric to stretch along the stress lines of the pants.
Typically this is lengthwise at the knee and widthwise at the rear end.
3. Pin. Pin the patch into place. Place pins diagonally at each corner and
perpendicular to the edge every 1⁄2 inch.
4. Hand sew for security. Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Using a hand-sewing needle and matching thread, sew a running stitch
along the edge of the patch as well as along the edge of the tear or
perimeter of the worn area. Turn the pants right side out.
5. Decorative sewing using the method below that matches your sewing
method. The instructions depend on whether you are hand sewing or
machine sewing. An overlock machine is not useful for this project. 
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Use any of these techniques to decoratively sew around the patch,
while extending the stitching pattern beyond the patch and
throughout the pants. You can even sew a faux patch in another
area to disguise the repair work. Refer to Figure 9-2 for ideas. 
Figure 9-1:

• Sewing by machine: Use any stitch you like to decoratively sew
around the patch, while extending the stitching pattern beyond the
patch and throughout the pants. You can even sew a faux patch in
another area to disguise the repair work. See Figure 9-3.

Skirts and Such
I’m a huge fan of skirts. They are comfortable, easy to wear, fun to layer and
they always look “dressed up” no matter how scruffy they are! 
So Easy Split Skirt
The only bad thing about skirts is the stigma against men wearing them. With
this in mind, I made a version of the So Easy Split Skirt using men’s pants.
While the barrier hasn’t been totally broken, it’s enough for more adventur-
ous men to make the plunge. They look simply gorgeous.
This project easy. You just cut the inseam of two pairs of pants, using one for
the base and the other for filler. Sew them together and you’re done! 
Check out the two pairs of pants prior to reconstruction in Figure 9-5 
and 9-6.

 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Seam ripper
 Scissors
Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your pants according to the label instructions, or
have them professionally cleaned if there’s no label.
2. Locate the inseams. Refer to Figure 9-7 to locate the inseam.
3. Rip it. Using your seam ripper, rip open the inseams of both pairs of
pants. Also rip open or cut off any cuffs on the pants.
Save your cuff scraps for Save-It-All Stuffing in Chapter 18.
4. Marking the cut line. Using the pair of pants that will become the scrap
fabric, fold them in half and lie them flat as shown in Figure 9-8. Using your
tape measure as a straight edge, and your tailor’s chalk, draw a line per-
pendicular to the length of the pants (parallel to the cuff) at the height
of the crotch. Using the pair of pants that will become your base skirt,
also fold them in half and lie them flat. Using your tape measure as a
straight edge, and your tailor’s chalk, draw a line from a point 1 inch
below the base of the zipper to the corner of the cuff. Draw a similar line
on the back side, from the back seam before it starts to curve out, to the
bottom cuff.

5. Cut and turn. Keeping both pairs of pants folded, cut through both
layers along the lines you just made. Turn both pairs of pants inside-out. 
Save your waist scraps for the Surprise Fly Top later in this chapter.
6. Align and pin. Line up the bottom cuff corner of a scrap pant leg with
the wedge-shape (formerly the inseam) beneath the zipper of the base
pants/skirt. With right sides facing each other, pin the cuff edge to one
side of the wedge, and the long pant-leg length edge to the other. Place
pins perpendicular to the edge every 1 inch. Repeat with the backside
and remaining pant-leg. Refer to Figure 9-9.

8. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock machine.
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Blanket stitch the pinned seams. Hem the edge using the quick
hem technique.
• Sewing by machine: Straight stitch the pinned seams with a 1⁄2-inch
seam allowance. Hem the edge by hand using a quick hem tech-
nique described in Chapter 5. 
• Sewing with an overlock: Serge the pinned seams, removing the
pins before running it through the overlock. Hem the edge by hand
using a quick hem technique described in Chapter 5. 
• No sew: Instead of sewing a finished hem, you can use no-sew hem
tape. This tape is just ironed on! You can find it in your local fabric
or craft store, online, or even in major supermarkets and depart-
ment stores.
Check out the pants after reconstruction in Figure 9-10.
Variations
For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas:
 Raw look: For external seams, keep the pants right-side-out in Step 5.
Instead of finishing the edge with a hem, leave out this step and blanket
stitch (hand sewing), zigzag stitch (machine sewing) or serge the edge
(overlock) for a raw finish.
Figure 9-10:
After —
So Easy
Split Skirt.
157
Chapter 9: Basic Slacks Brought Back

 Bias tape: Instead of hemming the edge or leaving it raw, you can cover
it with a decorative bias tape. This can be found in any sewing goods
or fabric store, usually near the zippers in the Notions area. Bias tape
comes in a variety of colors and can be either hand-sewn or machine-
sewn on to cover the edge (instructions on package).
 Thick stitches: Complete all stitching by hand sewing with embroidery
floss.
 Thicker stitches: Hand sewing over pre-sewn and secured edges with
yarn or ribbon
 Mix colors: Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements the
color of the pants. With a sewing machine you can also use a different
color for the bobbin thread. With an overlock machine, you can get
really creative and use four to five different colors. 
Detachable Bustle Skirt
The Detachable Bustle is a more traditional yet functional version of the
bustle. I just love the giggle when people try these on. There is some tedious
finishing work on this project, but otherwise it’s moderately easy. You just
cut the pants away from the front waistband, add fabric, and bustle it all.

Part III: Breathing Life into Dead Pants 

Materials
 Pants with a waistband that fits
 Scrap fabric of complementary colors and/or 1 yard of tulle/netting
 Common pins
 Safety pins
 Tape measure
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread that matches the pants 
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Scissors
Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your pants according to the label instructions, or
have it professionally cleaned if there’s no label.
2. Mark the first cut line. Locate the seam of the waistband with the body
of the pants. Using your tape measure, measure 11⁄2 inches from the seam
into the body of the pants. This measure may be made longer in order to
avoid cutting through belt loops. 
3. Mark this point with your tailor’s chalk. Repeat this measurement on
the front half of the pants every 1–2 inches around the waistband in
order to mark an even cut line. Connect the dots with your tailor’s chalk.
Refer to Figure 9-12.
If your pants do not have a waistband, draw a line such as described in
Step 2, 2 inches below the button or other closure. If your pants have no
closure (elastic or drawstring waist), draw a line 1.5 inches below the
band holding the elastic or drawstring. For any other type of pant, a safe
bet is to draw a line 4 inches from the top border of the waist.

4. Cut and trim. Cut the fabric along the cut line you just made on the front
half of the pants. Cut around the top of the zipper, removing it from the
waistband portion. For the lower portion, the body of the pants, cut out
the fly completely and open the inseams from crotch to cuff. Cut the
thick inseams and cuffs off of the pants. Refer to Figure 9-13.
5. Mark the second cut line. Using your tape measure, measure the width
of the cuff. Divide this number by three to get the width of the strips you
will be marking along the pant legs. Using your tailor’s chalk, mark the
cuff at these points. Measure the width of the pant-leg at the height of
the crotch. Repeat the same division by three and marking. Repeat this
entire step on the other pant leg. Draw two lines on each pant leg, con-
necting the cuff dots to the dots at crotch height. Refer to Figure 9-14.

6. Cut. Cut the fabric along the cut lines you just made. If you are using
scrap fabric as filler, cut it in similar width strips. Tulle and/or netting 
do not need to be cut!
7. Repair. Refer to Chapter 4 to repair any tears, holes, and stains as
needed.
8. Sew. Hem the cut edges by hand using a slant hem technique described
in Chapter 5. Do this for any scrap fabric you are using as well. Tulle
and/or netting do not need to be hemmed. Alternatives for a rough edge
are hand sewing a blanket stitch, machine sewing a zigzag stitch, or serg-
ing the cut edges with an overlock machine. 
Instead of finishing the cut edge with sewing, you can use no-sew hem
tape. This tape is just ironed on! You can find it in your local fabric or
craft store, online, or even in major supermarkets and department
stores.
9. Pinning with scrap fabric. Lie the pants flat, with the back on top.
Arrange the scrap pieces lengthwise, with half of the length of each
piece above the waistband, and half below, so that the center point of
the length lies on the waistband. Arrange them evenly, overlapping as
necessary along the back of the waistband. Using common pins, pin the
scrap fabric to the waistband, placing pins perpendicular to the waist-
band every inch. Refer to Figure 9-15.
Be sure to keep roughly the same thickness of fabrics along the waist-
band, especially if you are machine sewing. It is best to use lightweight
scrap fabrics in order to make this easier.

10. Pinning with tulle/netting. Lie the pants flat, with the back on top.
Arrange the tulle/netting lengthwise, with a 1⁄2 yard above the waistband,
and 1⁄2 below, so that the center point of the length lies on the waistband.
Pin the side edges of the tulle/netting 3 inches in from the side seams.
Gather the width of the tulle/netting evenly and pin to the waistband, plac-
ing pins perpendicular to the waistband every inch. Refer to Figure 9-16.
Instead of pinning with common pins, pin with safety pins so that you
can try the bustle on. Dance, jump, wiggle, and do whatever you need to
do to see if it moves well and looks good!
11. Pin the pant-leg strips. With the pants still lying flat, fold the pant-leg
strips back up to the waistband. Pin the outermost strips to the waistband
with 5–10 inches of the strip lying above the waistband. Pin the center
two strips to the waistband at the cuff edge. Place pins perpendicular
to the waistband every 1 inch.
12. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing or machine
sewing. An overlock is not appropriate.
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Running stitch along the waistband to secure the strips of fabric,
tulle and/or netting to the waistband.
• Sewing by machine: Refer to your sewing manual for instructions
on sewing multiple thicknesses. Straight stitch along the waistband
to secure the strips of fabric, tulle and/or netting to the waistband.

Surprise Fly Top
Apparently there’s something unusual about one’s head coming out of the
waist of a pair of pants! This is a great project to make use of those pants you
love but they just don’t fit right, simply paired with just about any shirt that
fits well. 
The construction of this project is similar to the Crop Inversion in Chapter 8,
taking a bit of measuring skill and patience to fit the neckline just right.

Be sure to avoid cutting through any pockets.
3. Cut. Cut through all four thicknesses along the line you just made with
your tailor’s chalk. Open the pants up and make the cut line even by cut-
ting off any angular points made by the curve of the crotch seam. 
Save the scrap pant legs to make a Pragmatic Potholder in Chapter 19.
4. Measure. Using your tape measure, measure the circumference of the
piece you just cut. Also measure the circumference of the neckline of the
pullover. Refer to Figure 9-21.
5. Design decision. Can the cut edge of the pants fit into the neckline? Can
the neckline be stretched to fit the circumference of the pants? If the
answer is “no,” see Step 1 below. If “yes,” see Step 2 below.

1. Cut and turn. Cut open the neckline by making it wider and lower
in the front. See Figure 9-22. Turn the pullover inside out.
Be conservative! You can always cut more to make the neckline
bigger.
2. Line up. Place the pants inside the crop so that the right sides are
facing each other. I like to have the fly (center front of pants) a few
inches off to the side as shown in Figure 9-23, but you can choose
to align this wherever you like.

instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock machine. Turn the top right-side out when
you are done.
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Blanket stitch the entire cut edge, attaching the neckline to the
pants/collar. 
• Sewing by machine: Zigzag stitch the entire cut edge, attaching
the neckline to the pants/collar.
• Sewing with an overlock: Serge the entire cut edge, attaching the
neckline to the pants/collar. 
Check out the pants and pullover after reconstruction in Figure 9-24.
Variations
For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas:
 Raw look: For external seams, instead of turning the pullover inside
out, turn the pants inside out. This will result in an external raw seam
at the neck.
 Thick, thicker, mixed: Refer to the “Variations” section for the first pro-
ject in this chapter for ideas on these deco stitching techniques.

Regenerating Jeans
In This Chapter
 Caring for your jeans
 Finding flaws and pitfalls
 Laying new looks on your jeans
W
hat would life be like without our tried and true denim friend? Jeans
are a wardrobe staple in most closets. Sturdier than slacks, they hang
on through tougher times. But when they finally go it tends to be in a dra-
matic fashion. At one time, ripped jeans were “in.” Even I was known to layer
leggings or boxers under a pair of dilapidated denims with a big old hole in
the butt! No more!
I’ve had many people come to me, jeans in hand, with a desperate look on
their face, wondering whether can anything be done. This is usually followed
by an embarrassing story of how their trusty jeans finally “went.” Thankfully
something can be done, lots of things actually. But if you want to save your
jeans before the breaking point, check out the Repetition Editions project in
this chapter. Beyond that, you still have many options to convert your jeans
into a variety of items, none of which involve your rear-end or knees exposed
to the elements!
Prepping, Primping, and 
Post Care for Your Jeans
In reconstructing jeans you will likely be dealing with jeans that have already
been washed and dried, and therefore any potential shrinking is minimal. A reg-
ular wash cycle and dryer is typically fine for jeans. However, some jeans may
have some stretch to them, detail work, or other adornments that would
render special attention. Therefore, always check the laundering label to wash
your jeans prior to your reconstruction project. If your label is missing, refer to
Chapter 4 for guidelines of when to have it professionally cleaned, and when it
might be safe to just gentle wash it in cold water and dry flat (no dryer).

170
Part III: Breathing Life into Dead Pants 
The usual suspects
Based on your project of choice, different flaws may be ok or not. Some 
projects, such as the Oh-So-Hip Hip Belt cut off the entire pant legs, while
others make use of every last bit of the jeans. Review the list below to figure
out where to begin and what hurdles you may have to jump over before
embarking on your reconstruction project.
Always check for these common flaws in jeans:
 Torn or worn rear end, fly and knees
 Stains and other wear and tear on the cuffs
 Stains on the knees and rear end
 Broken zipper
 Torn belt loop
 Holes in pockets (or other forgotten goodies)
Potential pitfalls to prepare for
Denim, the fabric that jeans are made from, is thick. Even just two layers are
difficult to sew through. When sewing through an existing seam it’s even 
more difficult, if not impossible. When working with these or other jean 
reconstruction projects, try to arrange the fabric so that you have minimal
layers to sew through. For example, don’t line up two seams so that you have
to sew through four or more layers at a time! Be sure to use a thimble if you
are hand sewing, and needles of appropriate thickness. Don’t push or pull
fabric through the machine. In general, be gentle with yourself and your
machine.
Don’t be afraid to ask questions, especially when shopping for needles. It 
can be confusing, especially with machine needles. In looking at them with
the naked eye they don’t seem all that different, but they are! Having the right
needle will save you a world of trouble in the end. Make sure you have several
needles on-hand with these projects as the likelihood is great that you will
break at least one!
Repetition Editions Jeans
This project is a “repetition” of “Renaissance Repairs” in Chapter 9, with spe-
cial instructions for denim. Blow-outs are part of the life expectancy of any
pair of jeans. Ideally you can use this technique before the full blow-out and
save yourself a lot of effort and embarrassment.

This project can be somewhat difficult depending on where the tear and/or
worn spot is located. Blowouts in the crotch area are rather difficult, some-
times requiring multiple patches. It is important to realize that this is a visible
repair job with a decorative twist. 
Check out the jeans prior to reconstruction in Figure 10-1.
Materials
 Jeans
 Stretchy fabric scrap large enough to cover the tear and/or worn spot
 Common pins
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread that matches the jeans, or complements decoratively
 Scissors
Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your jeans according to the label instructions, or
gentle wash and dry flat if there’s no label.
2. Turn it out. Turn the jeans inside out. Lie them flat so that the tear or
worn area is fully visible.
Figure 10-1:
Before —
Repetition
Editions
Jeans.
171
Chapter 10: Regenerating Jeans

3. Cut. Cut a patch of stretchy fabric to completely cover the tear and/or
worn spot. It should be at least an inch larger than any visible tear, worn
or threadbare areas. Being sure to cover any threadbare areas will save
you the trouble of repairing yet another denim blow-out in the future.
It is best to orient the fabric with the stretch running along the stress
lines of the jeans. Typically this is perpendicular to the tear, and length-
wise at the knee and widthwise at the rear end.
4. Pin. Pin the patch to the denim. Place pins perpendicular to the edge of
the patch, and thus, perpendicular to the stitch line in Step 3.
5. Hand sew for security. Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Using a hand-sewing needle and matching thread, running stitch along
the edge of the patch as well as along the edge of the tear or perimeter
of the worn area.
6. Turn it out. Turn the jeans right side out. Remove the common pins.
7. Decorative sewing using the method below that matches your sewing
method. The instructions depend on whether you are hand sewing or
machine sewing. An overlock machine is not appropriate for this project. 
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Use any of these techniques to decoratively sew around the patch,
while extending the stitching pattern beyond the patch and through-
out the jeans. You can even sew a faux patch in another area to dis-
guise the repair work. Refer to Figure 9-2 in Chapter 9 for ideas.
• Sewing by machine: Use any stitch you like to decoratively sew
around the patch, while extending the stitching pattern beyond the
patch and throughout the jeans. You can even sew a faux patch in
another area to disguise the repair work. Refer to Figure 9-3 in the
Chapter 9 for ideas.
This is a decorative stitch and therefore should be visible. Use a
contrasting but complementary color thread when completing the
decorative part of this project. 
Check out the jeans after reconstruction in Figure 10-2.

Oh-So-Hip Hip Belt
One thing that is great about jeans is their ability to go with almost anything!
This is why it makes a perfect transition into an accessory. Hip belts, which
are simply the waistband of the jeans with the pockets still attached, com-
bine function and style in a way that “fanny packs” never quite achieved. It
might just have been the name. Who really wants to pack their fanny? But a
hip reconstructed hip belt is whole different story!
This project easy. I’ve kept the instructions for a rough look because sewing
through multiple layers of denim, especially around all the seams of the
waistband is not only difficult on you, but on your machine as well. I also 
find that finishing jeans with a clean edge just plain looks funny! So for this
project, you just cut the waistband of the jeans, keeping the pockets you
want attached and cutting off the pockets you don’t want! Leave it raw (no
sew!) or finish with a rough stitching technique as described. 
Check out the jeans prior to reconstruction in Figure 10-3.

Materials
 Jeans with a waistband that fits on your hips
 Common pins
 Tape measure
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread that matches the jeans 
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Scissors
Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your jeans according to the label instructions, or
gentle wash and dry flat if there’s no label.
2. Design decision. Decide which pockets you want to keep.
If undecided, keep more pockets on. If you change your mind, you can
always cut more off, but sewing them back on is much more difficult.
3. Turn it out. Turn your jeans inside out and lie flat. Flatten and pin down
all pockets with interior lining.

4. Measure and mark the first cut line. Locate the lowest border of the
pockets. Using your tape measure, measure 1 inch below this point.
Mark this point with your tailor’s chalk. Using your tape measure as a
straight edge, draw a line at this point that runs across the pant leg and
parallel to the cuff. Do this on both legs. Refer to Figure 10-4.
5. Cut. Cut the entire pant leg at the line you just made. Then cut out the
inseam, cutting on each side of this thick seam. Refer to Figure 10-5.

6. Measuring and marking the second cut line. With your jeans still
turned inside out, locate the seam of the back pockets, as well as the
border of the front pockets that you have pinned down, With your tape
measure and tailor’s chalk, measure and mark 1⁄2 inch around the borders
of the pockets that you are keeping. Using your tailor’s chalk, continue
the vertical lines to the seam of the waistband (or the closest horizontal
seam depending on the style of your jeans). Continue marking your cut
line horizontally, 1⁄2 inch below the seam/waistband. This 1⁄2-inch measure
is flexible, depending on the style of your jeans. It might have to be
longer to get around belt loops, and it might have to be shorter to avoid
cutting through the zipper. See Figure 10-6.
7. Cut and stuff. Cut along the line you just made in Step 6. Remove the
common pins. Turn the jeans right side out.
Save the pant leg scraps to use for Put Your Money Where Your Scraps
Are in Chapter 20.
8. Repair. Refer to Chapter 4 to repair any tears, holes, and stains as needed.
Be sure to check for holes in the pockets and fix them up before you lose
your stuff!
9. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock machine. 
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Blanket stitch the entire cut edge.
• Sewing by machine: Be sure to use a needle made for denim. Don’t
force multiple thicknesses of the jeans through the machine. In an
area such as the zipper and seams, either run the machine manually,
or just leave this area unstitched as shown in Figure 10-7. Zigzag
stitch the entire cut edge, getting as close to the edge as possible. 
• Sewing with an overlock: Serge the entire cut edge, taking caution
in areas of multiple thicknesses.

Part III: Breathing Life into Dead Pants 

You can leave the edge completely unstitched and raw. Running it
through the washer and dryer will help the edges fray and bind together
to complete the “unfinished” look.
Check out the jeans after reconstruction in Figure 10-8.
Variations
For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas:
 Bias tape: Instead of hemming the edge or leaving it raw, you can cover
it with a decorative bias tape. This can be found in any sewing goods or
fabric store, usually near the zippers in the Notions area. Bias tape
comes in a variety of colors and can be either hand-sewn or machine-
sewn on to cover the edge (instructions on package).
 Thick stitches: Complete all stitching by hand sewing with embroidery
floss.

Chapter 10: Regenerating Jeans

 Thicker stitches: Hand sewing over pre-sewn and secured edges with
yarn, ribbon or cord.
 Mix colors: Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements the
color of the jeans. With a sewing machine you can also use a different
color for the bobbin thread. With an overlock machine, you can get
really creative and use four to five different colors.
 Stitching everywhere: Decoratively stitch other areas of the jeans,
marking with tailor’s chalk first if necessary (pocket edges, seams
and/or patching holes or other wear and tear). Decorative stitches
include embroidery or deco stitches on your machine. 
 Buttons: Sew decorative buttons onto hip belt. This is a great way to make
use of those odds and ends buttons. Keep within a color scheme, or
within a certain style (art deco, fabric, glass, carved) for a complete look.
 Get creative with the cut line. Instead of keeping the cut line tight to
the perimeter of the pocket and waist seams, get creative with curves
and other shapes. Refer to Figure 10-9 for ideas. 
 No-sew deco techniques. You can leave the edge completely unstitched
and raw. Running it through the washer and dryer will help the edges
fray and bind together to complete the “unfinished” look. Some other
no-sew ideas include creatively cutting the bottom edge, painting, grom-
meting, riveting, bedazzling, hot-gluing items (nonwashable), bleaching,
dyeing, drawing with fabric markers or even a sharpie marker. Make
stripes on your hip belt with gaffer’s or masking tape. Spray a light coat
of spray paint over it, let dry and repeat until you get the desired color
saturation. Remove the tape to reveal super-hot stripes!

It’s in the Bag Shoulderbag
Jeans are so durable, it only makes sense that they would make a great day-
bag to throw your stuff in and head off on an adventure. This bag takes your
every-day jeans and turns them upside down to make an over the shoulder
bag with fly access.
This project is easy, requiring no cutting and very little hand or machine
sewing. All you do is sew the waist shut, sew the cuffs together, turn it
upside-down and there you have it: It’s in the bag!
Check out the jeans prior to reconstruction in Figure 10-10.

lar to the edge every 1 inch. 
4. Folding the cuffs. Fold each cuff so that the inseam and outside seam
are just approximately centered as shown in Figure 10-12.
5. Cuff pinning. Place one cuff inside the other, overlapping 2 inches.
Arrange the seams just off-center to minimize the thicknesses of denim.

keeping the look playful, athletic, and functional.
The projects in this chapter range from frilly dancing skirts and leggings, to a
hat to keep you warm when you step out of the studio.
Prepping, Primping, and Post 
Care for Your Stretch Pants
Stretch pants need special care. The materials that make them stretchy are
especially delicate and susceptible to harsh washing as well as the heat of
the dryer. Always gentle wash your stretch pants in cold water and dry flat.
Do not put your stretch pants in the dryer no matter how much of a hurry
you are in! Check the laundering label for complete instructions, but this is an
item that I wouldn’t take any chances with. The results of improper care, as
discussed below, are simply frightening!

The usual suspects
Stretch pants generally show their wear pretty quickly. With the nature of
their use (in other words, working out) it’s not something I personally seek
out in a thrift store to reconstruct. Instead, think of these projects as creative
ways to evolve the stretch pants that already exist in your wardrobe. With that
in mind, you will not only be making use of your own item, but keeping it out
of the masses of clothing in thrift stores that go unclaimed, and then sent off
to an unspeakable fate. However, if you are looking for a pair in a thrift store,
keep your eyes out for common flaws. The projects listed in this chapter are
flexible with flaws in a focused area. Even the leggings are feasible to com-
plete with stretch pants that have overall damage and wear.
Always check for these common flaws in stretch pants:
 Places that have lost their stretch (knees, rear end)
 Torn inseam (crotch)
 Overstretched and torn waistband
 Stains on the knees and rear end (be sure to check inside too, these are
a tight-fitting item)
 Pilling in specific areas and even over the entire garment
Pulls and pills in all the wrong places
Depending what the stretch pants were worn for and worn with, they may have
a fair bit of pilling. Check them over carefully. Areas of particular attention
include the crotch and inner thigh, where activities like walking or running
would cause some wear. Also check around the waist, where certain jackets
or, eek, fanny-packs might have caused some damage.
Bare and Flare Skirt
The Bare and Flare Skirt can be as short or as long as you like it. The basic
pattern is for a shorter, “bare” version, however you can easily continue adding
more scrap fabric to make it longer. Like the Upside-Down Skirt, one of my
favorite things about it is how it makes use of every bit of original material,
while having the capacity to incorporate even more scrap material. The mini-
mal version of this skirt is great over a leotard for dance class, then layered
over longer skirts or pants on other occasions.

Part III: Breathing Life into Dead Pants 

This project is moderately easy. You just cut off the legs, cut up the scraps
and sew them back on for some flare. Hem the edge, or even leave it raw, and
you’re done. 
Check out the stretch pants prior to reconstruction in Figure 11-1.
Materials
 Stretch pants with an intact waist that fits well
 Common pins
 Tape measure
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread that matches the stretch pants 
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Scissors
Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your stretch pants according to the label instruc-
tions, or gentle wash and dry flat if there’s no label.

Chapter 11: The Existential Stretch Pant

2. Marking the cut line. Fold the pants in half, hip to hip, and lay them flat.
Using your tape measure as a straight edge and your tailor’s chalk, draw
a horizontal line (parallel with the waistband) 1 inch above the crotch.
Refer to Figure 11-2.
3. Cut. Cut through all four thickness along the line you just made with
your tailor’s chalk. With the remaining scrap leg pieces, cut off the
crotch, inseam and cuffs to yield two pieces of fabric. Cut each of these
pieces of fabric in half lengthwise.
4. Repair. Refer to Chapter 4 to repair any tears, holes, and stains as needed.
5. Turn it out. Turn the waist portion of the stretch pants inside out.
6. Align and pin. Line up one corner of a scrap piece with the center front
(crotch) point of the waist portion as shown in Figure 11-3. Be sure that
the right sides are facing each other and pin together. Continue pinning
the length of the scrap piece to the cut edge of the waist portion. Place
pins perpendicular to the edge every 1 inch.
7. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand-sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock machine. 
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Blanket stitch the pinned seams with a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance.
Remove the pins.

• Sewing by machine: Use a stretch needle for this project. Zigzag
stitch the pinned seams with a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance. Remove
the pins.
• Sewing with an overlock: Serge the pinned seams, removing the
pins before running it through the overlock. 
8. Cut. Cut off any excess fabric, either from the scrap or from the waist
portion, whichever is longer. Cut in a direction that will keep an even
line with the remaining edge. Refer to Figure 11-4 for each of these 
techniques.
Save your scraps for From Garbage to Gorgeous in Chapter 20.

9. Repeat Steps 6 through 8. Repeat Steps 6 through 8 with each of the
three remaining pieces of scrap fabric. Refer to Figure 11-5 to line up the
next piece of scrap fabric with the bottom corner of the first piece you
sewed in. 
10. Turn it out. Turn your skirt right-side out.
11. Finish the hem, using the method below that matches your sewing
method. The instructions depend highly on whether you are hand-
sewing, machine sewing or using an overlock machine.
Instead of hemming the edge, you can leave it raw. Many stretch pants
are made of a material that will hold its finish without a hem, and even
do a cool curled edge effect when stretched. You can also avoid sewing a
hem by using no-sew hem tape. This tape is just ironed on. You can find
it in your local fabric or craft store online, or even in major supermar-
kets and department stores. 
• Sewing by hand — for a finished look: Refer to Chapter 5 for
hand-sewing techniques. Hem the bottom edge with a quick hem
technique.
• Sewing by machine — for a rough look: Zigzag stitch the bottom
edge with a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance. 
• Sewing with an overlock — for a rough look: Be sure to use the
appropriate needle size and pressure for optimal feeding. Serge the
entire bottom edge.
Check out the pants after reconstruction in Figure 11-6. Note that the skirt is
worn sideways in this photo, but you can wear it any way that you like.

Variations
For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas:
 Raw look: For external seams, skip Step 5, keeping the waist portion of
the stretch pants right side out. Pin wrong sides together in Step 6, as
well as successive pinning of the scraps.
 Hand-stitched raw edge: Stitch the bottom edge with a blanket stitch
instead of a finished hem.
 Bias tape: Instead of hemming the edge or leaving it raw, you can cover
it with a decorative bias tape. This can be found in any sewing goods or
fabric store, usually near the zippers in the Notions area. Bias tape
comes in a variety of colors and can be either hand-sewn or machine-
sewn on to cover the edge (instructions on package).
 Get creative with the cut line: Instead of keeping the bottom edge cut
straight, get creative with curves and other shapes.
 More frill: Add more length and frill to your skirt by adding scraps of
material onto the bottom edge prior to hemming. Pleating (folding) or
ruffling the scrap piece makes this extra fun!
 Flared edge: When machine or overlock sewing, gently stretch the
fabric as it is feeding into the machine for a flared edge.
It is important not to pull too hard when stretching the fabric or you will
break a needle. This trick is for experienced sewers who are very famil-
iar with the feeding of their machine. 
Figure 11-6:
After —

Flare Skirt.
189
Chapter 11: The Existential Stretch Pant

Refer to your sewing manual for tips on your machine’s capacity to create
this flared edge on its own (as in, differential feeding mechanism on
some overlock machines.)
 Thick stitches: Complete all stitching by hand-sewing with embroidery
floss.
 Thicker stitches: Hand-sewing over pre-sewn and secured edges with
yarn or ribbon
 Mix colors: Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements the
color of the stretch pants. With a sewing machine you can also use a dif-
ferent color for the bobbin thread. With an overlock machine, you can
get really creative and use four to five different colors.
 Stitching everywhere: Decoratively stitch other areas of the skirt, par-
ticularly on the scrap pieces prior to sewing them into place. Mark the
decorative design with your tailor’s chalk first if necessary. Decorative
stitches include embroidery or deco-stitches on your machine.
 No sew: You can leave the edge completely unstitched and raw. Some
other no-sew deco techniques include creatively cutting the bottom
edge, weaving ribbon or cord through the edge of the skirt, painting,
grommeting, riveting, bedazzling, drawing with fabric markers or even a
sharpie marker. Use a heat gun to seal the raw edges of synthetic fabrics,
referring to the instructions on the heat gun project in Chapter 15. Make
stripes on your skirt with gaffer’s or masking tape. Spray a light coat of
spray paint over it, let dry and repeat until you get the desired color sat-
uration. Remove the tape to reveal super-hot stripes!
Layering the Leggings
While stretch pants as a single item are utterly unattractive, somehow with a
snip of the scissors and a slouch of the fabric, leggings are created to not
only keep you warm but look incredibly hot under layers.
This project is easy. All you do is cut the stretch-pant legs off, and maybe the
cuffs as well, finish the cut edges and you’re done!
Check out the stretch pants prior to reconstruction in Figure 11-7.

3. Cut. Cut through all four thickness along the line you just made with
your tailor’s chalk.
Save the waist portion of this project and use it for either the Bare
and Flare Skirt earlier in this chapter, or leave it as is for a pair of hot
pants.
4. Repair. Refer to Chapter 4 to repair any tears, holes, and stains as
needed.
5. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method.
Because this is a casual piece that needs to maintain its ability to
stretch, all of the instructions below are for a rough look. The instruc-
tions depend highly on whether you are hand-sewing, machine sewing
or using an overlock machine. 
Instead of finishing the edge, you can leave it raw. Many stretch pants
are made of a material that will not fray or run. It is a good idea to just
hand-sew the edges of the cut seam, or tie a knot in the existing threads
of the seam so that it doesn’t open up. You can also avoid sewing a hem
by using no-sew hem tape. This tape is just ironed on! You can find it in
your local fabric or craft store online, or even in major supermarkets
and department stores.
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Using a hand-sewing needle and matching thread, blanket stitch
the entire cut edge. Keep the stitches close together and a bit
loose so that the fabric can still stretch. Check the capacity for
stretching as you go. 
Hand-sewing is not a preferred method for this project since the
edge you are sewing needs to stretch.

• Sewing by machine: Using a stretch needle, zigzag stitch the entire
cut edge with a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance. Refer to the variations listed
below for ideas on decorative techniques. 
Use a zigzag as opposed to a straight stitch so that the legging can
stretch a bit. 
• Sewing with an overlock: Serge the entire cut edge. 
Check out the stretch pants after reconstruction in Figure 11-9.
Variations
For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas:
 Bias tape: Instead of hemming the edge or leaving it raw, you can cover
it with a decorative bias tape. This can be found in any sewing goods or
fabric store, usually near the zippers in the Notions area. Bias tape
comes in a variety of colors and can b either hand-sewn or machine-
sewn on to cover the edge (instructions on package).
 Thick stitches: Complete all stitching by hand-sewing with embroidery
floss.
 Thicker stitches: Hand-sewing over pre-sewn and secured edges with
yarn or ribbon.
 Mix colors: Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements the
color of the leggings. With a sewing machine you can also use a different
color for the bobbin thread. With an overlock machine, you can get
really creative and use four to five different colors.

Chapter 11: The Existential Stretch Pant

 Stitching everywhere: Decoratively stitch other areas of the leggings,
marking with tailor’s chalk first if necessary. Decorative stitches include
embroidery or deco-stitches on your machine.
 No sew: You can leave the edge completely unstitched and raw. Running
it through the washer and dryer will help the edges fray and bind together
to complete the “unfinished” look. Some other no-sew ideas include
weaving ribbon or cord through the fabric, painting, grommeting, rivet-
ing, bedazzling, bleaching, dyeing, drawing with fabric markers or even a
sharpie marker. Make stripes on your leggings with gaffer’s or masking
tape. Spray a light coat of spray paint over it, let dry and remove the
tape to reveal super-hot stripey leggings.
Figure 11-10 shows you how to wear your leggings. 
From Flat to Hat
It might seem a little strange to put your pants on your head, but this is 
a project that will do it up right! Stretch pants can be transformed into a 
variety of hat shapes, so feel free to play around with this concept. This 
particular project is not only simple but versatile. It can be kept simple or made
extravagantly creative with just a few easy alterations. In its most basic form,
it resembles a skull cap, while the creative version incorporates a long tail of
treasures!
This project is easy and can even be done without a bit of sewing! You just
cut off the pant leg and tie off one end. Cut off the extra length for a skull cap
or keep it in long strands. Add in more fabric and other adornments if you
like, creating a fantastic ponytail. One of the great things about this project is
that if you screw up, you have another pant leg to try again!

Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your stretch pants according to the label instruc-
tions, or gentle wash and dry flat if there’s no label.
2. Marking the cut line. Fold the stretch pants in half, hip to hip, and lay
them flat. Using your tape measure as a straight edge and your tailor’s
chalk, draw a horizontal line (parallel with the waistband) just below the
crotch. Refer to Figure 11-12.
3. Cut. Cut through all four thickness along the line you just made with
your tailor’s chalk.
Save the waist portion of this project and use it for either the Bare and

5. Try it on. Put the cut edge of the pant leg on your head like a hat, fold-
ing the edge for style and security. A standard stretch pant should fit
fine; however, if it is too small or too big you can either add in a length
of fabric or take in a seam. Refer to Chapter 6, Upside-Down Skirt in a
Topsy-Turvy World, Step 5 for instructions on how to do this. 
6. Fit the crown. With the hat on (inside out for a skull cap, right side out
for a fun hat), gather the extra fabric on the top into a ponytail of sorts
and secure with a rubber band. Remove the hat.
7. Cut for skull cap. For a skull cap, cut 2 inches away from the rubber
band as shown in Figure 11-13.
Be sure to cut the ponytail side of the rubber band, not the skull cap side!
8. Cut for both caps. Cut the length of fabric tied off with the rubber band
into 4 equal lengths, stopping 1⁄2 inch from the rubber band. Refer to
Figure 11-13.
9. Tie. With the rubber band still in place, make two knots in the fabric
lengths, tying opposite sections together. Pull the knot tight.

Variations
For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas: 
 Get creative with the cut line: Instead of cutting straight lines in the
lengths of fabric of the ponytail version, get creative with curves and
other shapes.
 Thick stitches: Complete all stitching by hand-sewing the edge with

ribbon.
 Mix colors: Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements the

color for the bobbin thread. With an overlock machine, you can get
really creative and use four to five different colors.
 Stitching everywhere: Decoratively stitch other areas of the hat, espe-
cially the dangles of the ponytail version, marking with tailor’s chalk first
if necessary. Decorative stitches include embroidery or deco-stitches on
your machine.
 Buttons: Sew decorative buttons onto the edge of the hat, in a cluster, or
on to the ends of the ponytail dangles. This is a great way to make use of
those odds and ends buttons. Keep within a color scheme, or with in a
certain style (art deco, fabric, glass, carved) for a complete look.
 No Sew! You can leave the edge completely unstitched and raw. Running
it through the washer and dryer will help the edges fray and bind
together to complete the “unfinished” look. Some other no-sew ideas
include weaving ribbon or cord through the hat, hot-gluing items (non-
washable), painting, grommeting, riveting, bedazzling, dyeing, drawing
with fabric markers or even a sharpie marker. Use a heat gun to seal the
raw edges of synthetic fabrics in the ponytail scraps, referring to the
instructions of the heat gun project in Chapter 15. Make stripes on your
hat with gaffer’s or masking tape. Spray a light coat of spray paint over
it, let dry and repeat until you get the desired color saturation. Remove
the tape to reveal super-hot stripes!

In this part . . .
I
n Part IV, I present to you some of my favorite 
projects. I just love working with sweaters, although
my machines would beg to differ. Whether you’re starting
with a cardigan, a pullover, or those ever-so-memorable
afghans . . . you’re sure to find a project you can enjoy
right here!
Read on and discover some tricks to working with 
knits and their particular pickiness to being cut apart.
Personally, I’m drawn to the tattered look of a frayed
sweater, moth-eaten holes, and dangling threads. But 
not everyone is, so I’ve shared with you the how-to’s 
on how to prevent these issues from cropping up.

here is just something wonderfully comforting about wrapping yourself
up in a cardigan. It’s like a big hug from a dear old friend. But when that
hug comes with moth-eaten holes and makes you look like a sack of potatoes,
there’s nothing comforting about it!
In this chapter you will take that nasty old cardigan to new levels. No longer
will it remain hidden in the drawer, only to be taken out for those most cozy
moments curled up with a good book and a box of tissues. After reading this
chapter, your cardigan will take on new visibility not only in your wardrobe,
but in your home as well.
The projects in this chapter range from something for your top as well as
your bottom, and even a place to rest your head when you are finished. For
your top, there is the Bad Unkl Sista Sweater, a year-round staple in my per-
sonal wardrobe. For your bottom, a twist on the Upside-Down Skirt presented
in Chapter 6. For a simple project, a pillowcase, which not only allows you a
good place to begin learning, but a great place for a nap when you are done.
Prepping, Primping, and Post 
Care for Your Cardigan 
While all garments have their peculiarities, knits, particularly cardigans, have
some special considerations to take note of. 

The usual suspects
When picking out your cardigan, check it over thoroughly in order to determine
whether it’s perfect, needs some repairs, or if it’s just too much to salvage.
Chapter 4 will help you decide which of these pitfalls you are willing to take
on for repairs, and which are just beyond saving.
Always check for these common cardigan pitfalls, using Figure 12-1 for reference:
 Missing, mismatched or poorly replaced buttons
 Stains and other wear and tear on the cuffs
 Armpit and collar stains
 Spill stains. These are usually on the front of the cardigan, but you also
might find some around the hip area where someone might have a habit
of wiping their hands (ew!!!)
 Overall pilling and pulls, especially under the arms & sometimes on the
back if the wearer sat in a chair often.
 Holes and runs. Stretching the material along the width can make these
easier to find (see arrows in Figure 12-1)
Cleaning your cardigan
Even after years of handling fabrics and knits, I still stumble across garments
from time to time that surprise me. Knits are especially particular! Because of
this, I recommend sticking to the laundering instructions on the label. If the
laundering instruction label is missing, check for a material content label.
Woolens need to be professionally cleaned. Angora, cashmere or other 
Stretch to look for holes and runs

pitfalls.
202
Part IV: Salvation For Your Sweaters and Other Knits 

softy-knits are highly susceptible to pilling and therefore should also be 
professionally cleaned. Refer to Chapter 4 for other special cases. All other
materials are okay to hand-wash in cold water and dry flat (no dryer). 
Knits hold their shape best when dried on a flat surface as opposed to hang-
ing on a line or drying rack. 
Buttons be gone
Yikes! You’ve got the perfect cardigan but it’s missing a button! Or the but-
tons are just so hideous that you can’t bear the sight of them! Easy fix!
For a missing button, first check the inside seam for extras. If not, you can
usually fudge it with the bottom-most or top-most button. Here’s how: 
1. Remove the button with your seam ripper. Insert the sharp point of
the seam ripper into the thread loop holding the button in place. See
Figure 12-2. Be careful not to catch any parts of the sweater in the blade
hook of the seam ripper. Push the blade hook against the thread to cut
the button free.
Point the seam ripper away from you so as not to gouge yourself. Ouch! 
2. Remove loose threads from the sweater. Carefully cut any knots with
scissors or your seam ripper. Pull threads from the material.
3. Locate the new location for the button. Button the sweater and mark
the missing button location revealed by its complementary buttonhole.
4. Sew. Hand sew the button into place, referring to Chapter 5. Sew the
extra buttonhole shut by hand or machine zigzag stitch.

Chapter 12: Do It Again with Your Cardigan

If you have to shop for replacement buttons, it is easiest to bring an old
button along with you to check for size, just like light bulbs!
Running Wild
After prepping your cardigan for take-off, you have one essential point to 
consider before getting started: will the sweater run when you cut it?
Wool holds together better than synthetic, more slippery, yarns. Looser knits,
the ones with larger holes, run more than tighter knits. Elaborate knit-work
such as Irish knit sweaters, also tend to run easily.
If there is any uncertainty, hand-baste or machine sew a zigzag stitch line just
inside your cutting line. See Chapter 5 for sewing how-tos. Next, cut the mate-
rial outside of the zigzag line away from the remaining body of the sweater.
See Figure 12-3.
Baste or zigzag stitch on each side of the cutting line when saving your cut
scraps for other projects!
This technique will help prevent runs while you are working on your project —
it’s not a substitute for the edge-securing instructions within each pattern.
The pattern instructions will all include a “hand baste or machine sew the cut
edge to avoid runs” step, but you can choose to opt out of this step if your
knit doesn’t run easily based on the tips described above. 
Stretching the cut material will cause it to run so be careful with your han-
dling of the sweater, Don’t stretch it and don’t leave it uncut and unattended,
especially among pets, children or other potential pullers.

Bad Unkl Sista Sweater
The Bad Unkl Sista Sweater, a design by my friend and fellow designer
Anastazia, is a cropped sweater that retains the button closures along the full
length of the original sweater. This results in a piece with the function of ties
or belting. Not only does it retain the coziness of its former cardigan self, but
you can wear it in a variety of ways to keep wardrobe boredom at bay. It func-
tions equally well accompanied by fleece sweatpants and a cup of hot choco-
late as it does paired with a cocktail dress at an art opening.
Overall, this project is fairly easy. Basically, you mark a cutting line, baste it,
cut it and bind it by sewing. From that point, you can elaborate with sug-
gested variations or decorative repair. 
Check out the cardigan prior to reconstruction in Figure 12-4.

Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your cardigan according to the label instructions,
or have it professionally cleaned if there is no laundering label. Replace
and/or move any buttons (See “Buttons be gone” above).
2. Identify the cut line. For most women, a flattering length for cropped
sweaters, including this one, is 1 inch below the lowest border of the
breast. Add another inch to this length in order to account for the hem. 
For thicker sweaters, add another half inch to this length to account for
the difference.
Put the sweater on, and then put a safety pin in the sweater to mark this
point. Take the sweater off.
If you are unsure of how long to make your sweater, err on the longer side.
You can always cut off more fabric and make it shorter. However, if you
cut it too short, it’s not so easy to make it long again.
3. Mark the cut line. Using your tape measure, measure the length from the
bottom of the sweater to the safety pin. Note this length, and mark this
point with tailor’s chalk. Measure and mark the cardigan every 5 inches
along the bottom of the sweater. Connect the dots made by the tailor’s
chalk to draw a straight horizontal line, starting 1 inch in from the edging
of the buttonholes, and ending 1 inch in from the edging of the buttons.
Buttons and buttonholes are almost always centered on an edging that
is distinctively different from the rest of the cardigan. If your sweater is
not like this, you can still find the edge. Using your tape measure, measure
the distance from the button center to the border edge of the cardigan.
Note this distance. Measure the same distance from the center of the
button toward the body of the cardigan. This is the point in which the
edging would typically end, and where you will measure an inch further
in towards the body of the cardigan to mark your cutting line.
Using the guide in Figure 12-5, extend the line down along the edges of
the buttons and buttonholes. This is the cut line. 
4. Baste edge. Using the guideline of your tailor’s chalk line, hand-baste
or machine sew a zigzag stitch just inside the cutting line shown in
Figure 12-5 before cutting it in order to prevent runs.
5. Cut. Cut the material outside of the zigzag line away from the remaining
body of the sweater. 
Save your scrap for Choker Chop-Ups in Chapter 20. 
6. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock machine. Regardless of the method, the goal
is to bind the cut edge completely, catching every loop of the knit in
order to avoid runs. 
206
Part IV: Salvation For Your Sweaters and Other Knits 

This step is in addition to basting the edge. Basting and a single zigzag
stitch are temporary solutions to runs, while this is a more precise and
finished step.
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Blanket stitch the entire cut edge. Hem the edge using the quick
hem technique described in Chapter 5. 
• Sewing by machine: Zigzag stitch the entire cut edge. Try to get the
stitch as close to edge as possible without the stitches falling off the
edge. Check the edge to be sure you’ve caught all loops of the knit
securely. If not, run it through the machine again until this is secure.
Hem the edge using the quick hem technique described in Chapter 5.
• Sewing with an overlock: Serge the entire cut edge. Hem the edge
using the quick hem technique described in Chapter 5.

Variations
For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas:
 Raw look: Instead of finishing the edge with a hem, leave out this step
and blanket stitch (hand sewing) for a raw finish.
 Bias tape: Instead of hemming the edge or leaving it raw, you can cover
it with a decorative bias tape. This can be found in any sewing goods or
fabric store, usually near the zippers in the Notions area. Bias tape
comes in a variety of colors and can be either hand-sewn or machine-
sewn on to cover the edge (instructions on package).
 Get creative with the cut line: Change the look and feel of the sweater
by altering the cut line. See Figure 12-7. 
 Thick stitches: Complete all stitching by hand sewing with embroidery
floss.
 Thicker stitches: Hand sewing over pre-sewn and secured edges with
yarn or ribbon.
 Mix colors: Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements the
color of the cardigan. With a sewing machine you can also use a different
color for the bobbin thread. With an overlock machine, you can get
really creative and use four to five different colors.
Now that you’ve completed this fabulous creation — how do you wear it? Tie it
in the front. Cross the ties, wrap and button behind your back. Cross them on a
diagonal, one over the shoulder, and button behind your back. See Figure 12-8.

Not all of these methods will work will all sweater styles and all body types.
It’s important, and fun, to find what works best for you! 
Making a Case for Pillowcases
Cardigans make great pillowcases because they already have the closures
built in! No longer do you have to pain over nostalgic pieces. With a few
stitches you can turn that baby sweater into a tooth fairy pillow!
This project is very easy. You can make either a square or rectangular pillow
case. First you determine the size of the pillow based on a pre-made pillow
form, or a customized pillow that you make yourself (Chapter 18). Then you
mark, baste, cut, bind and sew four straight seams.

Materials
 Cardigan
 Common pins
 Tape measure
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread that matches the cardigan 
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Scissors
Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your cardigan according to the label instructions, or
have it professionally cleaned if there’s no label. Replace and/or move
any buttons (see “Buttons be gone” earlier in this chapter). Keeping it
buttoned, turn your cardigan inside out and flatten it to prep for cutting.
2. Identify the pillow and case size. A store bought pillow form will have
the dimensions listed on the packaging. In all other cases, pull the seams
of the pillow taut and use your measuring tape to find the dimensions.
Add one inch to each of these numbers to determine the dimensions of
the pillow case. This allows for a 1⁄2-inch-wide seam.

For thicker sweaters, add another half inch to this length to give your-
self some breathing room.
3. Mark the cut line. With the buttons centered as shown in Figure 12-10,
use your measuring tape, pillowcase dimensions found in Step 2, and
tailor’s chalk to mark the square or rectangular shape of the pillow. 
You can only make a pillow case as large as your cardigan is. Measure the
length and width of your cardigan (buttoned up) as shown in Figure 12-10
before you purchase or make a pillow that’s too big for the case.
4. Pin. Pin both layers together. Place common pins diagonally at each
corner and every 1 inch along the inside of the cutting line.
5. Baste edge. Using the guideline of your tailor’s chalk line, hand-baste or
machine sew a zigzag stitch through both layers just inside the cutting
lines before cutting it in order to prevent runs. Remove pins.
6. Cut. Cut through both layers along the cutting line.

 Buttons. Sew decorative buttons along the edge of the pillow or clustered
in the corners. This is a great way to make use of those odds and ends
buttons. Keep within a color scheme, or within a certain style (art deco,
fabric, glass, carved) for a complete look. You can also have fun posi-
tioning the buttons of the cardigan by cutting your cardigan with the
buttons off center or even running on a diagonal.
A Twist on the Upside-Down Skirt
While the T-shirt upside-down skirt in Chapter 6, and the sweater version in
Chapter 13 are fun, they don’t have the capacity for a peek-a-boo effect when
you’re feeling flirty. By un-buttoning just a few buttons, you’ll suddenly go
from solemn to seductress!
This project is a bit hard. You will primarily refer to the instructions for the
upside-down skirt in Chapter 6, with a few variations. First you determine the
size. Then you sew the button edge partially closed, and make and attach a
waistband. Then you mark, baste, cut, bind and sew the bottom edge.

 Cardigan 
 Common pins
 Tape measure
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread that matches the cardigan 
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Scissors
Directions
1. Size it up. The easiest way to check the size is to try it on. Turn your
buttoned up cardigan upside down so that your feet step through the
neckline. Does it fit around your hips? If it doesn’t, you’ll need to forgo 
it for this particular project. Find another cardigan that is at least the
width of your hips, preferably 3-6 inches larger.
Sometimes our dimensions, ahem, shift a bit when we sit down. If you have
some curves in this area, be sure to test fit in sitting as well!
2. Prep. Wash and dry your cardigan according to the label instructions, or
have it professionally cleaned if there’s no label. Replace and/or move
any buttons (see “Buttons be gone,” earlier in this chapter).
3. Sew buttons closed. Using a running stitch (Chapter 5), hand sew the
buttons closed, starting at the waist edge and finishing where you would
like your slit to begin. You can also use a zigzag machine stitch with a
zipper foot to get as close as possible to the buttons.
4. Make and attach waistband. Refer to Upside-Down Skirt in a Topsy-
Turvy World (Chapter 6).
5. Identify the cut line. Refer to Upside-Down Skirt in a Topsy-Turvy World
(Chapter 6).
6. Mark the cut line. Refer to Upside-Down Skirt in a Topsy-Turvy World

In This Chapter
 Prepping and preventing pitfalls
 Projects that revisit the tees
 Accessories to warm your precious parts
P
ullover sweaters are one of those basics that you either love or hate.
Either way, it will have its day suitable for reconstruction. I like the one
year rule: “if you haven’t worn it in a year, it’s time to get rid of it.” But instead
of getting rid of it, you now have a choice, many choices in fact!
My most favorite of these projects is also the easiest: Sleek and Sneaky
Sleeves. After my hands had a frightening reaction to being overworked in
San Francisco’s damp and cold winter, I started wearing woolen sleeves
over vintage gloves. Paired with a little acupuncture and traditional Chinese
medicine and voila! My hands were back in action! The combo looked so
adorable (the sleeves, not the needles) that I soon got into the habit of wear-
ing them literally all the time! Thankfully they are so easy to make that I can
whip another pair up in a few minutes whenever I feel the need for a fresh
new(ish) pair!
The projects in this chapter revisit several of the T-shirt projects from
Chapter 6, as well as including a variety of accessories to curl up with!

Prepping, Primping, and Post Care 
for Your Pullover Sweaters
Pullover sweaters vary widely in their fabric content. Read the tips in
Chapter 12 for more information on knit content, laundering foibles, and 
pre-cutting prep. Check the laundering label and wash your sweater prior to
your reconstruction project. If your label is missing, refer to Chapter 4 for
guidelines of when to have it professionally cleaned, and when it might be
safe to just gentle wash it in cold water and dry flat (no dryer).
The usual suspects
You are likely working from your own sweater, and are well-aware of its flaws.
In fact those flaws are probably the reason you’re not wearing it anymore! But
if you are looking for a sweater to reconstruct from a thrift store, keep a keen
eye on the fit, especially if you are making a garment as opposed to an acces-
sory. Always be aware of some usual suspects to watch out for.
Always check for these common flaws in pullover sweaters:
 Stains and other wear and tear on the cuffs
 Collar ripping away from its binding
 Armpit stains
 Collar stains
 Spill stains. These are usually on the front of the sweater, but you also
might find some around the hip area where someone might have a habit
of wiping their hands (ew!!!)
 Overall pilling and pulls, especially under the arms and sometimes on
the back if the wearer sat in a chair often. Also think about the material’s
tendency in general to pilling.
 Holes and runs. Stretching the material along its width can make these
easier to find.
A bad pill you don’t have to swallow
Pullover sweaters are aplenty in any large thrift store. Certainly if there’s a
darling little vintage find that you’ve just got to have, you’ll take it home flaws
and all. However, if you are just looking on a more broad spectrum, the number
one thing to look out for is pilling. Mild pilling and pills in a focused area can
218
Part IV: Salvation For Your Sweaters and Other Knits 

be taken care of. However, if a sweater has major pilling all over it there’s not
much you can do to make it look clean and fresh again. Sometimes the fiber
content of the sweater is simply prone to pilling. In this case, it’s best to
move on to another sweater, or use the bad pill to make a smaller accessory.
For badly pilled sweaters, try turning it inside out! If you’re ok with external
seams, this is sometimes a clever option to the pilling dilemma.
Take Two On the Tees
Pullover sweaters function very much like T-shirts in their capacity for recon-
struction, and therefore can be incorporated into many of the same projects
with just some minor changes and prep to prevent runs in the knit.
Upside-Down Skirt
This sweater skirt is not only cozy but also very flattering! It’s a fitted skirt
with a flare from knee to mid-calf. While it is rather flirty, the sweater material
makes it more elegant and fun than slinky and seductive.
This project is moderately easy. It is just a bit more difficult and time consum-
ing than the T-shirt version because the edges need to be basted to prevent
runs in the knit. Otherwise, it’s snip, flip, and finish for a brand new Upside-
Down Skirt . . . sweater style!

 1 yard of stretchy fabric or another sweater of complementary color
 Safety pins
 Common pins
 Tape measure
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread that matches the sweater 
 Waistband material: drawstring, 3⁄4-wide elasticized band or 1⁄4-yard of
stretch fabric that measures the width of your waist. For drawstring,
allow 20 inches of additional length for tying.
 Scissors
Directions
Follow the directions for the Upside-Down Skirt in Chapter 6. Baste or zigzag
stitch, referring to “Running Wild” in Chapter 12, on each side of the cutting
lines prior to cutting. This will prevent runs in the knit. Only use a drawstring
waist or elastic waistband if your sweater is very thin. Another alternative is
to weave the drawstring through the loops of the knit rather than folding the
edge over.
Be sure to use appropriate needle and pressure for knits. Minimize the thick-
nesses you put through your machine, and always precut before putting
sweaters through the overlock.
Check out the sweater after reconstruction in Figure 13-2.
No Stopping the Halter Top
A halter top made out of a sweater couldn’t be the more perfect thing for
warm summer evenings! If the sweater is made of cotton it’s even better as
a swimsuit cover-up in the day. Put it away for the winter or pair it under
layers, using the dangles of the halter ties as a scarf. I love surprising people
with all the ways you can weave and play with these dangles!
This project is more tedious than it is difficult. It requires a lot of basting and
hemming of the edges, but otherwise it has much room for your own creativ-
ity to creep in and have fun with!

New Cut on Crops
Let me just say how much I love crop sweaters. I can still remember the one
I had in 7th grade and I still love it! Of course back then I wore it with a bare
belly, while now the look has graduated to a shorter crop with a longer slim
top or vintage slip underneath.
For years I’ve been playing with different versions of crops, changing it up as
the seasons go by. And for years people have been telling me, “I wear this all the
time.” You’ve got to love clothes that just become a part of you like that!
The difficulty of this project varies from easy (basic crop) to more tedious
(tails crop). Either way, it’s worth it. You will love your new crop.

Sleek ’n’ Sneaky Sleeves
Sleek ’n’ Sneaky Sleeves are a staple in my everyday attire. They are a simple
thing, merely cut off sleeves of a sweater. But when finished off and decorated
up a bit they can be unique statement all their own. 
These sleeves are more than just a stylish accessory. Who needs those
anyway? As discussed in the beginning of this chapter, I rely on mine for
warmth in lieu of gloves when working with my hands. They are also great for
biking, and for long days when you don’t know where you’ll end up! Pull them
out from too-short jacket sleeves to cover cold hands when there’s a sudden
change of weather, or when you cross the street here in San Francisco!
This project is easy. You just cut off the sleeves and bind the edge. The hard-
est part is figuring out what to do with the rest of the sweater.

For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas:
 Raw look. Leave out the hemming for a raw finish.
 Bias tape. Instead of hemming the edge or leaving it raw, you can cover
it with a decorative bias tape. This can be found in any sewing goods or
fabric store, usually near the zippers in the Notions area. Bias tape comes
in a variety of colors and can be either hand-sewn or machine-sewn on
to cover the edge (instructions on package).
 Get creative with the cut line. Instead of cutting a straight line, get cre-
ative with curves and other shapes.

 Flared edge. When machine or overlock sewing, gently stretch the knit
as it is feeding into the machine for a flared edge.
For knits, this trick only works well on thin material. It is important not
to pull too hard when stretching the fabric or you will break a needle.
This trick is for experienced sewers who are very familiar with the feed-
ing of their machine.
Refer to your sewing manual for tips of your machine’s capacity to
create this flared edge on its own (as in, differential feeding mechanism
on some overlock machines).
 Thick stitches: Complete all stitching by hand sewing with embroidery
floss.
 Thicker stitches. Hand sewing over pre-sewn and secured edges with
yarn or ribbon.
 Mix colors: Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements the
color of the sweater. With a sewing machine you can also use a different
color for the bobbin thread. With an overlock machine, you can get
really creative and use four to five different colors.
 Stitching everywhere: Decoratively stitch other areas of the sleeves,
marking with tailor’s chalk first if necessary. Decorative stitches include
embroidery or deco-stitches on your machine.
 Buttons: Sew decorative buttons onto the sleeves. This is a great way to
make use of those odds and ends buttons. Cluster a few together at the
cuff or resemble a vintage glove with a row of tiny buttons and the wrist.
 No-sew deco techniques: For wool sweaters, you can leave the edge
completely unstitched and raw. These cut edges can be bound by felting
the sweater: washing it in hot water. Note that this will shrink the sleeve,
so start with a piece that is too big, or take care to stretch it to size
while it’s still wet. Some no-sew ideas include weaving ribbon or cord
through the knit, grommeting, riveting, bedazzling and hot-gluing items
(nonwashable). 
Bag Ladies Shoulderbag
Bag Ladies is a softie shoulder bag perfect for your knitting projects! Bring it
traveling and it doubles as a pillow! It’s a simple bag, similar to the one in
Chapter 10 in that the cuffs are sewn together to form a single strap while the
waist is closed up to form the bottom of the bag. The neckline serves as easy
access to get to your lovely cozies inside!
This project is a cinch! There’s no cutting and minimal sewing. Just line it up,
sew the waist together, sew the cuffs together and maybe add a little deco to
make it a bit more unique and you’re done.

Materials
 Pullover sweater
 Common pins
 Tape measure
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread that matches the sweater 
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Scissors
Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your sweater according to the label instructions, or
have it professionally cleaned if there’s no label.
2. Repair. Refer to Chapter 4 to repair any tears, holes, and stains as needed.
3. Waist pinning. Lay the waist of your sweater flat with the left and right
side seams together and the waistband level as shown in Figure 13-14.
Pin the seams together, slightly off center so as not to have multiple
thicknesses at the seam. Continue pinning every 2 inches, placing pins
perpendicular to the waistband edge.

4. Folding the cuffs. Fold each cuff so that the underarm seam is approxi-
mately centered as shown in Figure 13-14.
5. Cuff pinning. Place one cuff inside the other, overlapping 2 inches.
Arrange the seams just off-center to minimize the thicknesses of knit.
Pin into place, with pins perpendicular to the cuff edge. Refer to
Figure 13-15.
6. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing or machine
sewing. An overlock machine is not appropriate for this project.
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Blanket stitch along the edge of the waistband, securing both
sides of the waistband together. At the cuffs, also use a running
stitch parallel to the cuff edge to sew the cuffs together at the 
midline of their overlap. Refer to Figure 13-15 for a visual on where
to sew.

• Sewing by machine: Be sure to use the appropriate needle size
and pressure for optimal feeding. Refer to your sewing manual for
instructions on sewing multiple thicknesses. Using a zigzag stitch and
a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance, sew along the edge of the waistband, secur-
ing both sides of the waistband together. At the cuffs, use a zigzag
stitch parallel to the cuff edge to sew the cuffs together at the midline
of their overlap. Refer to Figure 13-16 for a visual on where to sew.
• Sewing with an overlock: Be sure to use the appropriate needle
size and pressure for optimal feeding. Serge along the edge of the
waistband, securing both sides of the waistband together. Remove
the cuffs from their overlapped position and sew edges together in
a circle, forming a long tube of one sleeve running into the other.

A
fghans are something that we’re all familiar with but their value often goes
overlooked. They are typically knitted or crocheted by hand, thus requir-
ing hours of craftsmanship. Because its a bit of a lost art, the afghans that you
find in thrift stores or in your grandmother’s house are often in a color scheme
that’s wretchedly dated. But revisiting this old treasure and giving it a new
form can update this piece and finally evoke the appreciation it so deserves!
The projects in this chapter include fix-it tricks, as well as a couple lovely
pieces to nuzzle into, ideally next to a cozy crackling fire!
Prepping, Primping, and Post 
Care for Your Afghan
Most afghans that I come across are made from acrylic yarns, but there’s no
guarantee. Since these pieces are likely hand-made, they won’t have fabric
content or laundering labels either. So its best to start off by reading some of
the care tips in Chapter 12 for more information on knit content, laundering
foibles, and pre-cutting prep. Then bring your afghan to a dry-cleaner unless
you are absolutely certain of its content and tolerance to washing in the
machine. The dry-cleaner may also have some expertise and suggestions for
future care of your afghan. 

The usual suspects
The afghans that I have found thrift shopping are generally in great condition.
Still check for these pitfalls and decide whether it’s worth the plunge or not.
Always check for these common flaws in afghans:
 Smell (musty, smoke, or animal smells in particular)
 Torn or unraveled areas
 Stains and other wear and tear
Bang for your buck
It’s a sin really. Afghans, while taking so many hours to create by hand, are
generally one the least expensive things I’ve found in thrift stores. Typically
I’ve seen them priced between $2 and $5! From a reconstructing standpoint,
this is a huge amount of raw material for virtually no cost!
Fringe fallout
Some afghans have fringe on the edges. It’s typically composed of short
lengths of yarn. If you will be using the fringed edge for your project and
it’s either old or has fallen out, you’ll need to replace it. Unravel or untie
one of the fringe sections and bring the yarn to the store with you to find a
matching skein of yarn. If you can’t find one that matches, you will have to
replace all the fringe with a different, but complementing yarn. Cut the new
yarn in lengths equivalent to the piece you unraveled. Use at least 3 pieces of
yarn for each fringe section. Fold the yarn in half and insert the folded end
through the edge of the afghan. Pull the loose ends of the yarn through the
loop created by the fold. Pull tight. Refer to Figure 14-1.

Pimping the Poncho
Fear not! This is not your ordinary poncho. I dared for a moment to give you
instructions on the standard poncho, but thankfully I smartened up and came
up with a whole new design just for the readers of this book! This is a short
poncho that can be slumped around the shoulders with a hood to snuggle up in! 
This project easy. You start by basting and cutting a length of your afghan off.
Spiral it around in a tube, pin and sew and that’s it! All you have to do after
that is enjoy it!
Check out the afghan prior to reconstruction in Figure 14-2.
Materials
 Afghan with minimum dimensions of 17 x 60 inches
 Safety pins
 Tape measure
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread that matches the afghan 
 Tailor’s chalk
 Scissors

Chapter 14: Afghan Today, What Tomorrow? 

Directions
1. Prep. Have your afghan professionally cleaned.
2. Locate edge. Lay the afghan out flat and find the edges (typically oppo-
site edges) that have interesting detail such as fringe or scalloped
(wavy) edges.
3. Marking your cut line. Using your measuring tape, measure 17 inches
along the fringed edge on each side. Mark these point with your tailor’s
chalk or a safety pin. Using your measuring tape as a straight edge, draw
a line between the two points, fringed edge to fringed edge. Again substi-
tute marking with safety pins if your tailor’s chalk doesn’t leave a mark
on your afghan. Refer to Figure 14-3.
I like to use safety pins instead of common pins in afghans because of
the loose knit. I find that common pins tend to slip out. They also have
a tendency to get caught up in the bulk of the afghan while you are han-
dling it.
4. Baste. Refer to Chapter 5 for instructions on basting. Hand-baste or
machine zigzag stitch on each side of the line you marked in Step 3.
5. Cut. Cut along the line you just made.
Save the remaining piece of the afghan for a vestcoat later in this chap-
ter, another poncho, or Sleek ’n’ Sneaky Sleeves in Chapter 13.

6. Repair. Refer to Chapter 4 to repair any tears, holes, and stains as
needed
7. Pin in a spiral. Lay the afghan flat with the basted edge closest to you.
Measure 50 inches along the basted edge, starting at the left side. Mark
this point with a safety pin. Fold the top left corner to the safety pin. Pin
together. Continue rolling the top edge along the bottom edge and safety
pinning every 5 inches until you reach the opposite fringed edge. Refer
to Figure 14-4.
If you are particularly narrow or wide in the shoulders, try the poncho
on while it’s pinned before you put in all the effort to sew it into place.
Tighten up the spiral to make it smaller, or loosen it up to make it bigger. 
8. Sew using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock machine. 
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Blanket stitch the pinned seam with a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance,
making sure to catch every loop of the knit to prevent runs. 
• Sewing by machine: Zigzag stitch the pinned seam with a 1⁄2-inch
seam allowance, making sure to catch every loop of the knit to 
prevent runs. 
• Sewing with an overlock: Be sure to use the appropriate needle
size and pressure for optimal feeding. Serge the pinned seams,
removing the pins before running it through the overlock. Be sure
to catch every loop of the knit to prevent runs.

Variations
 Bias tape: Cover your stitched seam with a decorative bias tape. This
can be found in any sewing goods or fabric store, usually near the zip-
pers in the Notions area. Bias tape comes in a variety of colors and can
be either hand-sewn or machine-sewn on to cover the edge (instructions
on package).
 Thick stitches: Complete all stitching by hand-sewing with embroidery
floss.
 Thicker stitches: Hand sewing over pre-sewn and secured edges with
yarn or ribbon.
 Mix colors: Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements the
color of the afghan. With a sewing machine you can also use a different
color for the bobbin thread. With an overlock machine, you can get
really creative and use four to five different colors.
 Stitching everywhere: Decoratively stitch other areas of the dress,
marking with tailor’s chalk first if necessary. Decorative stitches include
embroidery or deco-stitches on your machine.
 Buttons: Sew decorative buttons onto the poncho. This is a great way to
make use of those odds and ends buttons. Cluster a few together at the
bottom corner or at the neckline. Sew a line of buttons on along the
seam to emphasize the spiraling effect of the poncho! Keep within a
color scheme, or within a certain style (art deco, fabric, glass, carved)
for a complete look.
 No-sew deco techniques: Some no-sew ideas include weaving ribbon or
cord through the knit, grommeting, riveting, bedazzling and hot-gluing
items (non-washable). 
Vestcoat Investments
In reconstructing and design, I love to take seemingly dissimilar things and
blend them together. This project is a perfect example of this. Vestcoat
Investments is a full-length sleeveless sweater that somehow brings the
old country-looking afghan to new heights of elegance. 
This project is moderately easy. It involves some fitting of the afghan first.
But once you have that all set you can seam up the shoulders, then baste,
cut and finish the arm-holes and you’re all done!

3. Finding center. Fold the afghan in half, front edges (found in Step 2)
together. The fold is the center of the afghan. Mark this point at the top
edge by putting a safety pin in it. Unfold the afghan.
4. Measuring shoulder width on you. Using your tape measure, measure
the width of your shoulders, armpit to armpit across the back. Divide
this number in half and make note of it.
It’s much easier to have a friend measure your shoulders!
5. Measure shoulder width on the afghan. Using your tape measure and the
number you found in Step 4, measure this amount from each side of the
afghan center. Fold the afghan towards the center at each of these points.
Safety pin the layers together at the fold and every two inches towards
the center until you are three inches from the center. Refer to Figure 14-9.
6. Try it on. Drape the afghan over your shoulders, the folded points being
at the tip of your shoulder. There are two questions to answer with this.
Is there too much fabric left in the front, as in, more than 1 foot on after
the last pin? If so, use your tape measure to measure how much excess

length you would like to remove on each side. Is it too long? If so, mark
the length at which you would like it to be by placing safety pins on the
sides and back. Take the afghan off. Refer to Figure 14-10.
1. Too long? Remove the pins running between the two layers at the
shoulders and lay the afghan flat. 
Do not remove the pin that marks the center of the afghan!
Note the safety pins you placed to mark the desired length.
Using your tape measure, measure each of these and determine
an average number between them. Remove the pins. Measure
the amount you determined from the bottom at two points.
Mark each of these points with your tailor’s chalk (or with a
safety pin if tailor’s chalk won’t work on your afghan). Using your
tape measure as a straight edge, draw a line across the entire
width of the afghan, through these two points. If the tailor’s chalk
doesn’t work to mark this line, place safety pins every 5 inches.
Hand-baste or machine-zigzag stitch on each side this line, remov-
ing the safety pins as you go. Cut along the line to remove the
excess fabric.
Save this lower edge scrap and turn it into Sleek ’n’ Sneaky Sleeves
(Chapter 13) or leave it as is for a fun scarf!

2. Too wide (too much fabric in front?) If you haven’t done so
already, remove the pins in the shoulders, leaving the center point
marked with a pin. Fold the afghan in half again as you did in Step 3.
Using your tape measure, measure the half the total excess amount
determined in Step 6 from the folded edge. Place a safety pin at
this point. Make the same measure further down the length, mark-
ing with a safety pin through both layers Using your tape measure
as a straight edge, draw a line across the entire length of the afghan,
through these two points. Mark the line by placing safety pins
every 5 inches through both layers. Hand-baste or machine-zigzag
stitch on this line, removing the safety pins as you go. Cut excess
fabric off on the fold side of the line.
Save this scrap and use it as flare for the Upside-Down Skirt
(Chapter 13) or finish the edges for a fun scarf!
7. Make arm holes. Using your tape measure and the number you found in
Step 4, measure this amount from each side of the afghan center. Mark
each of these points with a safety pin. Mark a 6-inch vertical line at this
point. Hand-baste or machine zigzag stitch around this line as shown in
Figure 14-11. Cut along this line.
8. Make shoulders. Repeat Steps 5 and 6, pinning the shoulders as close to
the neck as you like.
9. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock machine.

• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
First blanket stitch the edge of the arm hole, then the back seam
and then the bottom edge. Hem each of these in the same order,
being sure to keep all seams on the inside. Finish by blanket stitch-
ing the shoulder seams. When sewing, be sure to catch every loop
of the knit to prevent runs. 
• Sewing by machine: Be sure to use the appropriate needle size
and pressure for optimal feeding. Refer to your sewing manual for
instructions on sewing multiple thicknesses. First zigzag stitch the
edge of the arm hole, then the back seam and then the bottom
edge. Refer to the hand-sewing techniques in Chapter 5 to hem
each of these in the same order, being sure to keep all seams on
the inside. Finish by zigzag stitching the shoulder seams together.
When sewing, be sure to catch every loop of the knit to prevent
runs. Run the knit through the machine twice to be sure. 
• Sewing with an overlock: Be sure to use the appropriate needle
size and pressure for optimal feeding. First serge the edge of the
arm hole, then the back seam and then the bottom edge. Refer to
the hand-sewing techniques in Chapter 5 to hem each of these in
the same order, being sure to keep all seams on the inside. Finish
by serging the shoulder seams together. When serging, be sure to
catch every loop of the knit to prevent runs.

Variations
For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas:
 Raw look: Leave out the hemming for a raw finish.
 Bias tape: Cover your seams and hems with a decorative bias tape. This
can be done to just neaten up the interior, or turn the seams inside out
for a decorative seam. Bias tape can be found in any sewing goods or
fabric store, usually near the zippers in the Notions area. Bias tape
comes in a variety of colors and can be either hand-sewn or machine-
sewn on to cover the edge (instructions on package).
 Get creative with the cut line: Instead of keeping the edges of your vest-
coat straight, get creative with cutting curves and other shapes into it.
Cut it short, asymmetrical or with tails as in the Tails of Two Crops in
Chapter 8.
 More frill: Add frill to the edge of a short vestcoat by adding scraps of
material on to the bottom edge prior to hemming.
 Thick stitches: Complete all stitching by hand-sewing with embroidery
floss.
 Thicker stitches: Hand-sewing over pre-sewn and secured edges with
yarn or ribbon.
 Mix colors. Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements the
color of the afghan. With a sewing machine you can also use a different
color for the bobbin thread. With an overlock machine, you can get
really creative and use four to five different colors.
 Stitching everywhere: Decoratively stitch different areas of the vest-
coat, marking with tailor’s chalk first if necessary. Good areas to focus
on include the collar and edges. Decorative stitches include embroidery
or deco-stitches on your machine.
 Buttons: Sew decorative buttons onto the edges of the vestcoat. This is
a great way to make use of those odds and ends buttons. Keep within a
color scheme, or within a certain style (art deco, fabric, glass, carved)
for a complete look.
 No-sew deco techniques: Some no-sew ideas include weaving ribbon or
cord through the knit, grommeting, riveting, bedazzling and hot-gluing
items (non-washable).

some reason to wear it again. Trust me, you can have

In addition to the projects for the bridesmaid dress, you

go for it!

Chapter 15
Bridesmaid’s Redemption
In This Chapter
 Handling that bridesmaid dress before and after you give it a new look
 Keeping a keen eye out for mishaps
 Completing projects to wear yourself and give away
T
he bridesmaid dress, and its equivalently horrible mother-of-the-bride,
mother-of-the-groom and prom dresses are, more often than not, very
expensive one-wear-wonders. It’s unfortunate that such lovely occasions are
tainted with such wastefulness. No more! It’s time to release these old dresses
from the shackles of their garment bags stuffed at the far end of the closet.
Why make them continue to wait in vain for another public viewing that will
never come, at least not in their present shape? It’s downright criminal!
I’ve personally had my fill of pastel wonders in satin. I’ve also had some 
fantastic Halloween costumes as a result! I find the dominating obstacle in
reconstructing these prized pieces is the idea of ripping apart something that
cost so much money. But if it’s only hanging in the closet anyway, there’s only
profit to be gained in reconstructing it. At the very least, even if you screw it
up beyond any salvation, it will give you more closet space. The other obsta-
cle is the sentimental connection. But like all connections, things evolve.
Your dress is welcome to evolve as well. On the other hand, if it was a hideous
dress, or a hideous engagement, tearing it up can be immensely therapeutic! 
The projects in this chapter range from costume to conventional, both simple
to complete and completely pleasurable to rip to shreds!
Prepping, Primping, and 
Post Care for Your Dress
These dresses can be rather high maintenance. But with a little knowledge
and flexibility, they don’t always have to be this way. 

The usual suspects
These dresses are aplenty in larger thrift stores. I’ve even heard of entire
bridal parties finding matching dresses in a single thrift shop! Now that’s a
clever alternative to forking out mad cash on something you only wear once!
Whether you are working from your own dress or seeking one out elsewhere,
you’ll need one that fits well for the A Little Heat Gun Goes A Long Way pro-
ject. Everything else is forgiving in regards to fit, so just keep in mind some
usual bridesmaid mishaps.
Always check for these common flaws in bridesmaid dresses:
 Torn or dirty hem (especially for outdoor weddings)
 Stains (makeup, wine and food are most prevalent on the front of the
dress, or lipstick might be on the inside as well)
 Armpit stains
 Missing or loose decorative beading and appliqué
 Snags and pulls (usually at hips or rear-end from sitting)
Dry clean or bust
I have yet to come across a bridesmaid dress that wasn’t “dry clean only.”
However, I haven’t always paid heed to that, especially when I plan to recon-
struct it into something intentionally distressed. Projects that have this
capacity include the Split Skirt Stick-Up and Whip Up a Wine Bag. For these
projects you may be okay with hand-washing in cold and drying flat (no dryer).
Refer to Chapter 4 for more specific guidelines on when it might be okay to
get away with passing over professional cleaning.
A Little Heat Gun Goes a Long Way Dress
I got a heat gun a few years ago for purposes of embossing stamped effects
into my garments. Through a fortunate accident, I discovered its capacity for
gently melting synthetic fabrics and thus heat-sealing seams! Soon this devel-
oped into a decorative effect resembling a war-ravaged version of the dress’s
former design.

3. Design decision. Decide whether you would like to raw up just the
bottom edges or scrap up more of the garment.
4. Cut. Using your scissors, cut the hem off. Continue to cut any other edges
you would like to heat-seal. Refer to Figure 15-2 for ideas on more simple
looks. Refer to Figure 15-3 for ideas on more ravaged costume looks.
5. Prep work area. Be sure to work in a well-ventilated area. Your work
surface should be heat resistant and free of other items that might melt
while you are working with the heat gun. Keep the area free of other haz-
ards, children, and animals that may trip up the cord and cause your
heat gun to move or fall off the work surface.
6. Heat seal. Warm up your heat gun according to the instructions that cam
with it. Taking care to keep your hands out of the direct line of the heat

gun, aim it at an angle towards the edge you just cut. Keep the heat gun
at least approximately 3 inches from the fabric. Keep it moving back and
forth within an inch along the edge. This area should start to melt within
a few seconds. When it starts to melt, move the heat gun smoothly along
the edge, continuing the melting process as you go. Refer to Figure 15-4.

Variations
For a decorative effect, try cutting holes in the middle of the fabric to heat
seal. You can also point the heat cut directly onto the solid fabric to create
crimping and holes. I like to create a crimped area and then stretch it out to
tear open a hole.
Split Skirt Stick-Up
Being that the fabrics of bridesmaid dresses are so lovely and fancy, I like
to blend them with less formal fabrics to balance them out. The Split Skirt
Stick-Up is a good example of this. An all-pants version of the split skirt is in
Chapter 9. This version makes use of the pants as a base, with a length of
dress fabric sewn into both the front and back.
This project is moderately easy. You just cut the inseam of a pairs of pants,
trimming off the crotch. Then you patch in the scrap fabric from the brides-
maid dress, hem the whole skirt and you’re done!

 Common pins
 Tape measure
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread that matches the dress
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Seam ripper
 Scissors
Directions
1. Prep. Have your dress professionally cleaned. Wash and dry your pants
according to the label instructions, or have them professionally cleaned
if there’s no label.
If you are feeling daring, you can try hand-washing in cold and flat-dry
(no dryer). Refer to Chapter 4 for more information on whether this is a
feasible option for you.
2. Cut. Cut two rectangles of material from the dress, approximately 20
inches wide by 30 inches long.
In choosing where to cut these rectangles, you can work your way
around stains, snags and other mishaps.
Save your scrap pieces for Wine Bags later in this chapter.
3. Repair. Refer to Chapter 4 to repair any remaining tears, holes, and
stains in the dress material.
4. Locate the inseam. Refer to Figure 15-8 to locate the inseam of the pants.

5. Rip it. Using your seam ripper, rip open the inseams of the pants. Also
rip open any cuffs on the pants, or cut them off completely.
6. Marking the cut line. Fold the pants in half and lie them flat. Using your
tape measure as a straight edge, and your tailor’s chalk, draw a line from
a point 1 inch below the base of the zipper to the corner of the cuff.
Draw a similar line on the back side, from the back seam before it starts
to curve out, to the bottom cuff. Refer to Figure 15-9.
7. Cut. Keeping the pants folded, cut both layers along the lines you made
with your tailor’s chalk.
8. Repair. Refer to Chapter 4 to repair any tears, holes, and stains in the
pants as needed. 
9. Turn it out. Turn the pants inside out.

10. Align and pin. Line up the corner of the dress material with the wedge-
shape (formerly the inseam) beneath the zipper of the pants. With right
sides facing each other and a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance, pin the edges
together. Place pins diagonally at each corner and perpendicular to the
edge every 1 inch. Repeat with the back side and second piece of dress
material. Refer to Figure 15-10.
Corners such as this are tricky. The safest bet is to leave extra dress mate-
rial (approximatley 1 inch) in this corner so that you have something to
work with. And never be afraid to ask a more experienced sewer for help.
11. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock machine.
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Blanket stitch the pinned seams with a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance.
Then hem the edge using the quick hem technique. Turn the skirt
right side out.
• Sewing by machine: Straight stitch the pinned seams with a 1⁄2-inch
seam allowance. Hem the bottom edge by hand using a quick hem
technique described in Chapter 5. Turn the skirt right-side out. 
• Sewing with an overlock: Be sure to use the appropriate needle
size and pressure for optimal feeding. Serge the pinned seams,
removing the pins before running it through the overlock. Hem the
bottom edge by hand using a quick hem technique described in
Chapter 5. Turn the skirt right side out.
Instead of sewing a finished hem, you can use no-sew hem tape.
This tape is just ironed on! You can find it in your local fabric or craft
store, online, or even in major supermarkets and department stores.

Variations
For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas:
 Raw look: Skip Step 9 and pin with wrong sides facing. This will result in
an external raw seam. Instead of finishing the edge with a hem, leave out
this step and blanket stitch (hand sewing), zigzag stitch (machine
sewing) or serge the edge (overlock.)
 Bias tape: Instead of hemming the edge or leaving it raw, you can cover
it with a decorative bias tape. This can be found in any sewing goods or
fabric store, usually near the zippers in the Notions area. Bias tape
comes in a variety of colors and can be either hand-sewn or machine-
sewn on to cover the edge (instructions on package).
 Get creative with the cut line: Instead of keep the bottom edge straight,
get creative with curves or other shapes.
 Thick stitches: Complete all stitching by hand sewing with embroidery
floss.
 Thicker stitches: Hand sewing over pre-sewn and secured edges with
yarn or ribbon.
 Mix colors: Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements the
color of the pants and/or dress. With a sewing machine you can also use
a different color for the bobbin thread. With an overlock machine, you
can get really creative and use four to five different colors.

 Stitching everywhere: Decoratively stitch other areas of the skirt, mark-
ing with tailor’s chalk first if necessary. Decorative stitches include
embroidery or deco-stitches on your machine.
 No-sew deco techniques: Some no-sew ideas include painting, grommet-
ing, riveting, bedazzling, dyeing, bleaching, drawing with fabric markers
or even sharpie markers. Make stripes on your skirt with gaffer’s or
masking tape. Spray a light coat of spray paint over it, let dry and repeat
until you get the desired color saturation. Remove the tape to reveal
super-hot stripes!
Cape — from Costume to Couture
Capes are an elegant evening cover-up for those dressy occasions when you
just don’t have the right coat. They also make great superhero/heroine acces-
sories! This particular cape incorporates a wrapped method of wearing it, for
increased elegance.
This project is fairly easy. You start by cutting the dress at the waist. Then
cut off a length of the bottom, reattaching it at the more narrow waist part.
Finish the seams and you’ve got a new cape!

 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread that matches the dress
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Scissors
Directions
1. Prep. Have your dress professionally cleaned.
2. Mark the cut-line. Lie the dress flat. Using your tape measure, measure
from the armpit down to a point at the waist on each side. Mark these
points with your tailor’s chalk. Using the tape measure as a straight
edge, draw a horizontal line connecting the two points. Next, measure
10 inches from the bottom seam and mark the point with your tailor’s
chalk. Repeat this measure every 5 inches from the bottom edge. Using
your tape measure as a straight edge, draw a line connecting these
points. Refer to Figure 15-13.
By laying the dress flat with the bottom hem even, you can cut your
work time in half by measuring and marking the top half of the dress,
and then carefully cutting through two layers at a time.
3. Cut. Cut along the lines you just made. Cut open the back seam.

4. Finding centers. Fold both pieces of the skirt in half. Mark the fold, the
center of each piece, using your tailor’s chalk. Mark the waist edge of the
larger piece, and the cut edge of the 10-inch-wide piece. 
5. Pin. Pin the marked points of each piece together, right sides facing as
shown in Figure 15-14. Place pins diagonally at each corner and perpen-
dicular to the edge every 1 inch. 
6. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock machine. 
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Quick hem the vertical seams (formerly the back seam) first. Then
use a running stitch (1⁄2-inch seam allowance) to sew the two pieces
together at the pinned seam. Hem the cut edges (the lower portion
of the wrap and the bottom of the cape). 
• Sewing by machine: Quick hem the vertical seams (formerly the
back seam) first, referring to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Then use a straight machine stitch (1⁄2-inch seam allowance) to sew
the two pieces together at the pinned seam. Hem the cut edges
(the lower portion of the wrap and the bottom of the cape). 
• Sewing with an overlock: Quick hem the vertical seams (formerly
the back seam) first, referring to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing tech-
niques. Then serge the two pieces together at the pinned seam.
Hem the cut edges (the lower portion of the wrap and the bottom
of the cape).
Instead of sewing a finished hem, you can use no-sew hem tape.
This tape is just ironed on! You can find it in your local fabric or

the area with your tailor’s chalk first if necessary. Decorative stitches
include embroidery or deco-stitches on your machine.
 Buttons: Sew decorative buttons onto the edges or wrap portion of your
cape. This is a great way to make use of those odds and ends buttons.
Keep within a color scheme, or within a certain style (art deco, fabric,
glass, carved) for a complete look.
 No-sew deco techniques. Some no-sew ideas include painting, grommet-
ing, riveting, bedazzling, dyeing, bleaching, drawing with fabric markers or
even sharpie markers. Use a heat gun to seal the raw edges of synthetic
fabrics, referring to the instruction on the heat gun project earlier in this
chapter. Make stripes on your cape with gaffer’s or masking tape. Spray
a light coat of spray paint over it, let dry and repeat until you get the
desired color saturation. Remove the tape to reveal super-hot stripes!
Whip Up a Wine Bag
The Whip Up A Wine Bag project is not only a good use of your scraps, but
it’s a good incentive to give a gift! This particular wine bag is a very basic
tube of fabric sealed at the bottom and tied with a ribbon. With such elegant
fabric you can pull off simplicity with grace! 
This project is easy. Basically you just cut a rectangle of fabric, fold it and
sew together two of three edges. Add a ribbon (or cluster of deco scraps if
you’re feeling crafty) and you’re ready to be the hit of the party. Oh, and
don’t forget to put the wine bottle in first!

Second Life For Your Skirt
In This Chapter
 Caring for and handling of your skirt
 Making pleasing things from unsightly flaws!
 Perusing projects from head to toe
I
love skirts! On rare occasions, usually close to laundry day, I can be found
wearing a pair of pants. But most every morning I climb into layers of
skirts. Not only are they comfortable, but for some reason everyone thinks
you’re “dressed up” in a skirt, even when it’s torn to shreds and covered in
paint like most of mine.
While there are certain items that can be found en masse in thrift stores, the
quality is not always top notch. Skirts, however, are generally in great condi-
tion. The problems with them lie more in their outdated style and fit. This
chapter will help solve these problems and expand your wardrobe.
The projects in this chapter include two ways to flare up your skirt and one
to wrap your head around!
Prepping, Primping, and Post 
Care for Your Skirt
Skirts vary widely in their fabric content. Check the laundering label and
wash it prior to your reconstruction project. If your label is missing, refer to
Chapter 4 for guidelines of when to have it professionally cleaned, and when
it might be safe to just gentle wash it in cold water and dry flat (no dryer).

The usual suspects
When thrift shopping for skirt, the fit, particularly in the waist, can be the biggest
flaw. Skirts are constantly changing styles and most can be reckoned with in
reconstruction. But a too-high or too-low fitting waist is not something you want
to mess with. Start with one that fits well, and then take a peek for flaws that
you may or may not be able to work with. When all fails in the fit, you always
have the option of turning it into a cowl neck, the last project in this chapter.
Always check for these common flaws in skirts:
 Torn or worn rear end (check the lining too!)
 Holes in pockets
 Distorted and worn waist
 Torn hem on long skirts
 Stains at the hips and hem
 Broken zipper
 Missing snap, button or other closure
Freeform and Frill Skirt
This skirt is basically permission for you to play! There’s really no wrong way
to screw it up. Experimenting is encouraged within the guidelines of the sim-
plest form: a skirt with slits of other fabric patched into it.

Working your butt off!
Every so often a friend gives me a rather senti-
mental piece of their clothing to “do my thing”
with. It usually comes with a story, and I involve
that story into what I create from it. I honor
clothing that represents our evolution in it, even
when the result appears tattered to the naked
eye. One such example occurred with a friend
and her old business suit. It was a beautiful
custom-tailored red suit that she was forbidden
to wear after her employer of many years sold
out to a big corporation. From that point on she
was required to wear a boxy dark suit, stripped
of personality, similar to the new format of the
company. After continuing to wear the red suit,
soon enough my friend was fired from her posi-
tion. When she gave me the suit I noticed that
the lining had been worn to nearly nothing in
some parts. She had literally worked her butt off
for a company for 20 years, only to be shut out
when it sold out and didn’t care about people
anymore. In reconstructing the suit I removed
the worn sections and patched them onto the
front of the coat to fully honor her life’s work and
the beauty she created with it. 

This project easy. You start by cutting out rounded sections of the skirt, sewing
in lengths of fabric, and continue cutting and sewing in fabric as you like!
Check out the skirt prior to reconstruction in Figure 16-1.
Materials
 Skirt that fits well in the waist
 Scrap fabric, minimum of 3 lengths at least twice the length of the skirt
and 10 inches wide
 Common pins
 Tape measure
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread that matches the skirt 
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Scissors
Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your skirt according to the label instructions, or
have it professionally cleaned if there’s no label.
2. Mark the cut line. The number of lengths of scrap fabric you have, and
your own design decision, will determine the number rounded sections
you cut out of the skirt. Using your tape measure, measure around the
width of the bottom hem. Divide this number by the number of sections
you wish to make. This number is the bottom width of each section.

Chapter 16: Second Life For Your Skirt

Using your tailor’s chalk, mark a point on the hem of the skirt where
you would like to start a section. I usually start this on the side seam.
Measure the section width from this point and mark a second point.
Repeat until all the points are marked. Using your tailor’s chalk, draw an
arch into the skirt, starting at one point and ending at the next point.
The top of the arch should be no more than 5 inches below the waist.
Continue drawing arches between all points. Refer to Figure 16-2. 
Five inches from the waist is a minimum measure. If you would like a
more conservative skirt, or would like your frills concentrated at the
bottom, make the top of the arch lower (further from the waist.)
3. Cut. Cut the lines you just made.
Save your scrap for Sachet Simplicity in Chapter 19.
4. Turn it out. Turn the skirt inside out.
5. Align and pin. With right sides facing each other, line up the bottom
corner of a cut arch with the corner of the scrap fabric. Pin the two
layers together. Continue pinning the length of the scrap piece to the cut
edge of the arch, placing the pins perpendicular to the cut edge every
1 inch as shown in Figure 16-3.
6. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock machine. 
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Running stitch the pinned seam with a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance.
Remove the pins. 
• Sewing by machine: Straight stitch the pinned seam with a 1⁄2-inch
seam allowance. Remove the pins.
• Sewing with an overlock: Serge the pinned seam, removing the
pins before running it through the overlock.

Variations
For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas:
 Raw look: For external seams, skip Step 4 and pin the wrong sides
together. Instead of finishing the edge with a hem, leave out this step
and blanket stitch (hand sewing), zigzag stitch (machine sewing) or
serge the edge (overlock) for a raw finish.
 Bias tape: Instead of hemming the edge or leaving it raw, you can cover
it with a decorative bias tape. This can be found in any sewing goods or
fabric store, usually near the zippers in the Notions area. Bias tape
comes in a variety of colors and can be either hand-sewn or machine-
sewn on to cover the edge (instructions on package).
 Get creative with the cut line: Instead of keeping the bottom edge as is,
get creative with curves and other shapes.
 More frill: Add more length and frill to your skirt by adding scraps of
additional material on to the bottom edge prior to hemming. Pleating
(folding) or ruffling the scrap piece makes this extra fun! 
 Thick stitches: Complete all stitching by hand sewing with embroidery
floss.
 Thicker stitches: Hand sewing over pre-sewn and secured edges with
yarn or ribbon.
 Mix colors: Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements the
color of the material. With a sewing machine you can also use a different
color for the bobbin thread. With an overlock machine, you can get
really creative and use four to five different colors.
 No-sew deco techniques. Some no-sew ideas include painting, grommet-
ing, riveting, bedazzling, dyeing, drawing with fabric markers or even
sharpie markers. Use a heat gun to seal the raw edges of synthetic fab-
rics, referring to the instruction on the heat gun project in Chapter 15.
Make stripes on your skirt pieces with gaffer’s or masking tape. Spray a
light coat of spray paint over it, let dry and repeat until you get the
desired color saturation. Remove the tape to reveal super-hot stripes!
Business Skirt Gone Badass
The Business Skirt Gone Badass project is a simple way to add subtle or not
so subtle personality to your office-wear. This skirt is a decked out, stitched,
patched, painted version of your former skirt. 
This project is easy. It merely involves adding stitching or other decorative
variations to your existing skirt.

Materials
 Skirt that fits well
 Common pins
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread in a color that complements the skirt
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Scissors
Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your skirt according to the label instructions, or
have it professionally cleaned if there’s no label.
2. Mark the stitching. Using your tailor’s chalk, mark the areas of the skirt
that you would like to decorate. The simplest version is to just stitch
along the hem. Refer to Figure 16-8 for ideas.
3. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock machine.

• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques. Use
any stitch you like to decoratively stitch in the areas you’ve marked.
The simplest version is to blanket stitch along the bottom hem. 
• Sewing by machine: Use any stitch you like to decoratively stitch
in the areas you’ve marked. The simplest version is to zigzag stitch
along the bottom hem. 
• Sewing with an overlock: Serge the entire bottom hem.
When sewing with an overlock, you can only serge the bottom
hem for decoration.

Variations
For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas:
 Raw look: Open the bottom hem or cut it off to leave a raw edge that
you can then blanket stitch (by hand) or zigzag stitch (by machine).
 Bias tape: Cover the bottom hem with decorative bias tape. This can be
found in any sewing goods or fabric store, usually near the zippers in
the notions area. Bias tape comes in a variety of colors and can be
either hand-sewn or machine-sewn on to cover the edge (instructions
on package).
 Thick stitches: Complete all stitching by hand sewing with embroidery
floss.
 Thicker stitches: Hand sewing over pre-sewn and secured edges with
yarn or ribbon.
 Buttons: Sew decorative buttons onto the edge of the skirt. This is a
great way to make use of those odds and ends buttons. Keep within a
color scheme, or within a certain style (art deco, fabric, glass, carved)
for a complete look.
 No-sew deco techniques: Some no-sew ideas include painting, grommet-
ing, riveting, bedazzling, dyeing, drawing with fabric markers or even a
sharpie marker. Make stripes on your skirt with gaffer’s or masking tape.
Spray a light coat of spray paint over it, let dry and repeat until you
get the desired color saturation. Remove the tape to reveal super-hot
stripes!
Cutting-Edge Cowl Neck Top
This project is very similar to the Surprise Fly Top in Chapter 9 except it is
even easier! With no messy pant legs or crotches to work around, you can
make the cowl neck (the skirt) part of your pullover as long as you like. 
This project is moderately easy. The hardest part is fitting the skirt into the
pullover neckline. You start by cutting the skirt to the length you’d like for
your cowl. Make sure the neckline of your pullover is wide enough and then
sew the skirt into for a surprisingly chic look!

Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your skirt and pullover according to the label
instructions, or have them professionally cleaned if there’s no label.
2. Marking the cut line for your skirt. Decide how long you want your
cowl neck to be. I usually do 24 inches to be able to wear it as a hood.
Lay the skirt flat. Measure this amount down from the waist on each side
and mark the points with your tailor’s chalk. Using your measuring tape
as a straight edge, draw a line connecting the two points.
3. Cut. Cut the skirt through both layers along the line you just made.

Chapter 17
Addressing That Tired Old Dress
In This Chapter
 Doing right by your dress
 Protecting yourself against pitfalls
 Update your outdated dilemma of a dress with a variety of projects
I
’m sure you have at least one dress in your closet that you never wear 
but hold on to just in case you need it for something! Dresses can get 
dated quickly, especially if you’re a trendy buyer. While vintage dresses are
adorable, the fit is not always quite right and you can often end up looking
like you raided Grandma’s closet.
This chapter will help you fix up these dilapidated darlings. The projects
range from some simple seam realignment to complete redesigns. Whether
you are looking for a subtle change or a whole new piece for your wardrobe,
you’ll find the solution in the next few pages.
Prepping, Primping, and 
Post Care for Your Dress
Dresses vary widely in their fabric content. Check the laundering label and
wash it prior to your reconstruction project. If your label is missing, refer to
Chapter 4 for guidelines of when to have it professionally cleaned, and when
it might be safe to just gentle wash it in cold water and dry flat (no dryer).
The usual suspects
Dresses, particularly vintage dresses, can have some typical dilemmas to be
aware of. Whether you are using your own old dress, or thrift shopping for a
great reconstruction find, keep your eyes peeled for a few things. Note that
the fit is important for the following reconstruction projects. So unless you
are particularly handy with alterations, stick to a dress that fits well already.

Always check for these common flaws in dresses:
 Torn hem
 Spill stains (especially in party dresses!)
 Armpit stains
 Broken zipper or other closure
 Smell, especially in vintage and polyester pieces
Showing Some Skin Dress
Changing the neckline and hem on a dress can significantly change the look
of it. While it doesn’t affect how it fits you, it can have a significant effect on
how often you wear it! My favorite neckline alteration is turning things into
halters, which this project does. I just love the draping dangles of fabric that
hang down the back.
This project is moderately easy, depending on the style of your dress. You
start off by cutting the dress into a halter by cutting across the back and
making straps. Finish the cut edges and you’re done. 
Check out the dress prior to reconstruction in Figure 17-1.

Part V: Skirts and Dresses (re)Done Right 

Materials
 Dress that fits well
 Safety pin
 Common pins
 Tape measure
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread that matches the dress 
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Scissors
Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your dress according to the label instructions, or
have it professionally cleaned if there’s no label.
If you don’t feel comfortable cutting free-hand, mark each of the follow-
ing cuts with tailor’s chalk prior to cutting.
2. First cut. Cut your dress across the back, armpit to armpit, and continue
under the arm and around the front of the shoulder. See Figure 17-2.
If your dress has a zipper, unzip it before cutting. Keep it from zipping back
up, and losing your zipper-pull, by safety-pinning the zipper-pull in place. 
3. Second cut. Next, cut a vertical line through the center of the upper
back piece. See Figure 17-3.
Cut

Back
Figure 17-2:

283
Chapter 17: Addressing That Tired Old Dress

4. Third cut — making dangles. If your dress has sleeves, cut open the
underarm seam. Next continue the cut from the shoulder in a spiral
through the remaining material, creating one long piece measuring
approximately 2 inches wide. Do this on each side. These are the ties
that will tie around your neck to hold your halter top up. See Figure 17-4
for a cutting diagram.
5. Try it on. Put your halter dress on, tying the dangles behind your neck
comfortably. Is the neckline too tight or too high on your neck? If so,
proceed with Step 6 and/or refer to the Variations section of this project.
Otherwise, continue on to Step 7.
6. Neckline issues? Cut off more fabric in front of the neck, using Figure 17-7
as a guide, if necessary.

7. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock machine.
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Hem all cut edges using the quick hem technique. If you have cut
through a zipper, stitch the cut edge down securely, making multiple
wraps around the teeth edge so that the zipper-pull cannot be pulled
off. You may have to sew on a hook-and-eye closure if your zipper
does not self-lock. You can use the hook-and-eye on the original por-
tion of the dress. Use the original placement as a guide in placing
and sewing the hook-and-eye into its new location.
• Sewing by machine — for a rough look: Zigzag stitch all cut
edges, stitching as close to the edge as possible without the
stitches falling off the edge. Refer to the instructions on hand
sewing to fix the top of a zipper. 
• Sewing with an overlock — for a rougher look: Serge all cut edges.
Refer to the instructions on hand sewing to fix the top of a zipper. 
8. Repair. Refer to Chapter 4 to repair any tears, holes, and stains as needed.
Check out the dress after reconstruction in Figure 17-5.
Variations
For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas:
 Raw look: When hand sewing, instead of finishing the edge with a hem,
blanket stitch the cut edge for a raw finish.
Figure 17-5:
After —

285
Chapter 17: Addressing That Tired Old Dress

 Bias tape: Instead of hemming the edge or leaving it raw, you can cover
it with a decorative bias tape. This can be found in any sewing goods or
fabric store, usually near the zippers in the Notions area. Bias tape
comes in a variety of colors and can be either hand-sewn or machine-
sewn to cover the edge (instructions on package).
 Get creative with the cut line: Make the bottom hem of your dress more
interesting by cutting a curvy cut line and then hemming. 
 Thick stitches: Complete all stitching by hand sewing with embroidery
floss.
 Mix colors: Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements the
color of the dress, or its decorative components. With a sewing machine
you can also use a different color for the bobbin thread. With an overlock
machine, you can get really creative and use four to five different colors.
 Stitching everywhere: Decoratively stitch other areas of the dress,
marking with tailor’s chalk first if necessary. Decorative stitches include
embroidery or deco-stitches on your machine.
 More dangles: Get creative with Step 4. Cut multiple dangles, either
along the length of the strap or from the point where it attaches to the
body of the halter top. Sew on more scraps of fabric for even more dan-
gles! See Figure 17-6 for ideas.
 Necklines: Alter your neckline by altering the cut line, adding more
straps or even sewing on some ruffling scraps. See Figure 17-7 for ideas.
 No-sew deco techniques: You can leave the edge completely unstitched
and raw. Running it through the washer and dryer will help the edges
fray and bind together to complete the “unfinished” look. Some other
no-sew ideas include painting, grommeting, riveting, bedazzling, dyeing,
drawing with fabric markers or even a sharpie. Make stripes on your
dress with gaffer’s or masking tape. Spray a light coat of spray paint over
it, let dry and repeat until you get the desired color saturation. Remove
the tape to reveal super-hot stripes!

Raw the Right Way Dress
This is a good solution for a dress you like but are just bored with. It’s also a
great option for those vintage frocks that need some sprucing up. The dress
looks the same, except the seams, certain seams mind you, are inside out.
This project is easy. All you do is rip open the desired seams and restitch
them with the wrong sides facing each other. Adding decorative touches 
can be fun with this project as well.

Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your dress according to the label instructions, or
have it professionally cleaned if there’s no label.
2. Identify desired seams. Find the seams on your dress. Turn it inside 
out if necessary. Pick out the ones that you would like to expose. I like 
to keep things elongated by working only with the vertical seams, not
the horizontal seams. Refer to Figure 17-9.
3. Rip. Using your seam ripper and scissors as needed, rip open the
desired seams carefully.
4. Pin. Pin the seams back together with the wrong sides facing. Start pin-
ning at one edge and place pins diagonally at each corner and perpen-
dicular to the edge every 1 inch. Be sure to line up any obvious points
that should be in line, such as a waist seam. Refer to Figure 17-10. 
5. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock machine.

Looking inward, or outward . . .
My personal design aesthetic involves expos-
ing the construction and development by expos-
ing the seams. It’s a style that some people
understand, but still trips others up. I once sent
a few outfits out for a fashion show, complete
with pictures to demonstrate how to wear them.
When I got the clothes back they were all inside
out. I hoped that this was just an oversight in
sending them back in a rush. It wasn’t. When
the pictures finally came through, sure enough,
all the clothes were shown inside out, complete
with tags hanging out and everything!

• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Blanket stitch the pinned seams with the same seam allowance as
the original seam. Remove pins. 
• Sewing by machine: Zigzag stitch the pinned seams with the same
seam allowance as the original seam. Remove pins. 
• Sewing with an overlock: Serge the pinned seams, removing the
pins before running them through the overlock. Refer to the varia-
tions listed below for ideas on decorative techniques.

Sets of All Sorts Top/Skirt
Sometimes it’s hard to find things that match. But when you are cutting a
dress into two pieces, it can’t not match! The simplest version of this project
involves making the dress into a top and skirt that look fairly similar to their
previous form. However, with other options you can get creative with other
projects in this book.
This project varies in difficulty depending what you choose to do. The sim-
plest version is easiest. Other versions depend on the project you choose to
incorporate.

Directions
1. Prep. Wash and dry your dress according to the label instructions, or
have it professionally cleaned if there’s no label.
2. Mark cutting line. Try your dress on. Decide how long you would like
the top. Put a safety pin in this point at the side seam. Take the dress off
and lay it flat. Using your measuring tape, measure the distance from the
armpit to the pin. Mark this point with your tailor’s chalk. Repeat on the
other side seam. Using your measuring tape as a straight edge, draw a
horizontal line connecting the two points.
3. Cut. Cut through both layers on the line you just made.
4. Waistband. Refer to the Diminishing Waste With Waistbands project in
Chapter 6 for instructions on making a waistband for the skirt portion of
your dress.
5. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock machine.
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Hem the bottom edge of the top. 
• Sewing by machine for a rough look: Zigzag stitch the entire
bottom edge of the top. 
• Sewing with an overlock for a rough look: Serge the entire
bottom edge of the top.
Instead of sewing a finished hem, you can use no-sew hem tape. This
tape is just ironed on! You can find it in your local fabric or craft
store, online, or even in major supermarkets and department stores.
6. Repair. Refer to Chapter 4 to repair any tears, holes, and stains as needed.
Check out the dress after reconstruction in Figure 17-13.
Variations
If the simplest version doesn’t quite work for your dress, or you just want a
different look, try these options:
 Skirt options: Use the remaining skirt part of the dress as scraps in an
upside-down skirt (Chapters 6, 12, 13), split skirt (Chapter 9), Bare and
Flare Skirt (Chapter 11) or Freeform and Frill Skirt (Chapter 16) 
 Top options: Turn your top into a No-Stop Halter Top (Chapter 6), 
crop it (Chapter 8), or get creative with cowl necks (Chapter 16).

Chapter 18
Brand New Bedding
In This Chapter
 Bedecking your bedroom with recycled scraps
 Stuffing, casing, and covering your bed
B
edding and bedding accessories are great projects for beginners. These
projects are especially perfect because they are made from scraps! So
there’s really no risk of ruining a piece! The size and fit of bedding is forgiving,
and realistically who is going to see it if you mess up? You can always put that
not-so-perfect side of the pillow on the bottom, or hide it behind other pillows. 
For the same unseen reasons, these projects also allow for more creativity
than you can sometimes get away with in your clothing. You can make use 
of those sentimental pieces, favorite colors and prints that are simply unsuit-
able for your daily attire!
The projects in this chapter cover most bed linen basics. Not only will you
learn how to make a pillow, but a case for it as well. You will also learn how 
to make a scrap quilt, and quick hints for duvet covers!
Save-It-All Stuffing
The more you reconstruct, the more you learn that scraps come in all shapes,
sizes, and textures. For this project you can use it ALL! Actually, the only
exception is anything hard, such as thick leather, buttons, or other decora-
tive components that you wouldn’t want to rest your head on. 
This project easy. All you have to do is sew together a casing from a large
scrap, leave a hole and stuff it with the rest of the scraps. Oh, and don’t
forget to sew the hole back up when you’re done.
Sometimes in reconstructing items, pins are forgotten and left in the scraps.
Be sure to check your scraps for pins before stuffing. With this project in par-
ticular, you are sure to get pricked!
Check out the scraps prior to reconstruction in Figure 18-1.

Materials
 Scrap material large enough for a casing
 Scrap material of soft texture
 Common pins
 Tape measure
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Scissors
Directions
1. Identify the pillow size. This project is for a square of rectangular
pillow. Your pillow size is determined by either the decorative pillow
case your are putting it in, such as in the “Casing Your Cozies” project 
in this chapter, your personal preference, or the size of the scrap you
have to make a casing for your stuffing. 
You need two pieces of fabric of the same size, one for each side of 
the pillow.
2. Mark the cut line. Using your measuring tape and tailor’s chalk, mark a
square or rectangle on one layer of the scrap fabric equal to the pillow-
case dimensions found in Step 1.
Figure 18-1:

298
Part VI: Now What to Do with All These Scraps? 

3. Line up. Place the marked fabric on top of the second piece of scrap
fabric, keeping the markings visible.
4. Pin. Using common pins, pin both layers together just inside of the cut-
ting line. Place the pins diagonally at each corner and perpendicular to
the cut-line every 1 inch. 
5. Cut. Cut both layers of fabric along the marked cutting line.
Save scraps for more pillow stuffing.
6. Sew using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock machine:
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Using a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance, blanket stitch both layers together
along the entire cut edge. Leave 4 inches at the center of a seam
unsewn. Refer to Figure 18-2.
• Sewing by machine: Using a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance, straight stitch
both layers together along the entire cut edge. Leave 4 inches at
the center of a seam unsewn. Refer to Figure 18-2. 
• Sewing with an overlock: Serge both layers together along the 
cut edge. Leave 4 inches at the center of a seam unsewn. Refer to
Figure 18-2.
7. Turn it out. Turn the casing right-side out. Poke out the corners.
8. Stuff it. Stuff the casing, starting with smaller scrap material stuffed
solidly into the corners. This will give the corners shape. From that
point on, stuff the casing as loosely or as solidly as you like.
The more full you stuff the casing, the harder it will be to sew. I like to
stuff it to my desired amount, then push the stuffing as far away from
the open seam as possible.

Variations
Try some of these ideas:
 Scented pillows: Add scent to your pillow. Visit your local herb shop, 
or research online for the variety of ways you can do this.
 Playful pillows: This is great for kids and pets. Stuff the pillow casing
with crunchy plastic grocery bags, squeak toys, or caged bells for a

So you’ve made a pillow, now it’s time to make it a case. Using scraps to do
this creates a fun and interesting look that not only looks great in your home,
but makes an extra special homemade gift as well.
I have a pillow that I made out of scraps years ago. I have a ribbon sewn onto
it, not just for decoration but also to tie it onto my bags when I travel. It saves
room in my luggage and is super-easy to get to, not to mention being the envy
of every weary traveler’s eye!

Part VI: Now What to Do with All These Scraps? 

This project is moderately easy. It is very similar to the first few steps of the
previous project, while keeping one side open to slip the pillow in and ribbon
closures to seal it up tight. Note that these instructions are for a square or
rectangle pillow case only. 
Check out the scraps prior to reconstruction in Figure 18-4.
Materials
 2 pieces of scrap material larger than the pillow or scrap material sewn
together that is larger than the pillow
 Ribbon of complementary color (20 inches)
 Common pins
 Tape measure
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Scissors
 Iron

Directions
1. Identify the pillow and case size. A pre-made pillow form bought from a
store will have the dimensions listed either on the packaging or the tag.
In all other cases, pull the seams of the pillow taut and use your measur-
ing tape to determine the dimensions. Add one inch to each of these
numbers to determine the dimensions of the pillow case you will be
making. This allows for a 1⁄2-inch-wide seam.
2. Measure. Is your scrap big enough? Using your measuring tape, measure
the dimensions of each piece of your scrap material. Referring to the
dimensions determined in Step 1, determine whether the pieces are big
enough as they are or if you need to sew more fabric on to make them big
enough. If you do, you have two choices, straight lines (Step 3) or patch-
work (Step 4). If you do not need to sew on more fabric, proceed to Step 5.
Patching in additional scraps of material can add an interesting look to
your pillowcase. While the instructions refer to it as a solution for size,
this may also be a design choice!
3. Sewing on more fabric — straight lines. The easiest way to add more
fabric is to sew straight edges together. Place your scrap pieces together,
right sides facing, lining up existing straight edges whenever possible. 
Pin the pieces together along the straight edge, pins perpendicular to the
edge and 2 inches apart. If the edges are not straight, use your measuring
tape as a straight edge, and your tailor’s chalk to draw a straight line. 
Pin the pieces together just inside the line (pins perpendicular to the line,
2 inches apart). Cut through both layers along the line. Sew the pieces
together along the straight edge using the method below that matches
your sewing method. The instructions depend highly on whether you are
hand sewing, machine sewing or using an overlock machine. Open up the
pieces and iron the seam flat (for hand and machine sewn.) 
Refer to Figure 18-5. Measure again and sew on more fabric in the same
manner until the piece is at least the dimensions found in Step 1.
Proceed to Step 5.
Save your scraps for additional patching of the case, for stuffing (earlier
in this chapter), or for a myriad of other projects in Part VI.

Part VI: Now What to Do with All These Scraps? 

Remember that the pillow case has two sides, so be sure to have two
pieces prepared to the correct size. 
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Using a hand-sewing needle, matching thread and 1⁄4-inch seam, 
running stitch the seam.
• Sewing by machine: Using a 1⁄4-inch seam, straight stitch along 
the seam.
• Sewing with an overlock: Be sure to use the appropriate needle
size and pressure for optimal feeding. Remove the pins from the
edge and serge the layers together along the seam. 
4. Sewing on more fabric — patchwork style. While this method of adding
fabric makes use of the whole scrap and yields a rough constructed look
that I like, it is more difficult. Start by finding scraps that almost fit
together as puzzle pieces. Overlap their edges by at least 1⁄2 inch and pin
together. Place the pins at every corner and at least 1 inch apart. Be sure
to pin along the edge of each scrap layer. Refer to Figure 18-6. Sew the
pieces together along each edge using the method below that matches
your sewing method. The instructions depend highly on whether you
are hand sewing, machine sewing or using an overlock machine.
Measure again and sew on more fabric in the same manner until the
piece is at least the dimensions determined in Step 1. 
Remember that the pillow case has two sides, so be sure to have two
pieces prepared to the correct size. 
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Using a hand-sewing needle and matching thread, secure each
edge with a stitch similar to the slant hem, but do a full stitch on
the underside rather than just catching a single thread.

Chapter 18: Brand New Bedding

• Sewing by machine: Zigzag stitch through both layers just inside
the cut edge of each edge.
• Sewing with an overlock: The overlock is not appropriate for
sewing the scrap pieces together for this project. However, serging
along the edges of each piece will not only help keep the fabric
from fraying, but it will be a nice decorative effect as well. 
5. Mark the cut line. Using your measuring tape and tailor’s chalk, mark
one layer of the scrap fabric equal to the dimensions found in Step 1. Be
sure to mark the wrong side of the fabric.
6. Line up. Place the marked fabric on top of the second piece of scrap
fabric, keeping the right sides together and the markings visible. 
7. Pin. Using common pins, pin the layers together just inside of the cut-
ting line. Place the pins diagonally at each corner and perpendicular to
the cut-line every 1 inch.
8. Cut. Cut both layers of fabric along the marked cutting line.
Save any scrap for stuffing (earlier in this chapter) or other projects in
Part VI.
9. Prep open edge. Remove the pins from one edge of the pillow case. This
is the edge that will remain open to insert the pillow. Using your measur-
ing tape, fold the edge of each layer back 1⁄2 inch. Pin the folded edge of
each layer. Remove the pins from the other edges. Iron the folded edges
flat. Pin a length of ribbon at least 10 inches long, to the center of each
folded edge. Refer to Figure 18-7.
10. Sew the open edge using the method below that matches your sewing
method. The instructions depend highly on whether you are hand
sewing, machine sewing or using an overlock machine.
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Hem the folded edge of each layer, using one of the hem stitches
described in Chapter 5. Secure the ribbon in place by sewing it
down in a square pattern with a running stitch. Refer to Figure 18-8.
• Sewing by machine: Using a 1⁄4-inch seam, straight stitch the folded
edge of each layer, sewing over the ribbon as well. Further secure the
ribbon by sewing it down in a square pattern. Refer to Figure 18-8.
• Sewing with an overlock: Remove the pins from the folded edge
on each layer. Unfold the edge and cut off the extra 1⁄2 inch on each
layer. Serge along the cut edge of each layer. Sew the ribbon into
place using either the hand sewing or machine sewing technique
described above.
11. Realign. With the right sides facing and hemmed edges together, put the
layers together so that the edges are even.
304
Part VI: Now What to Do with All These Scraps? 

12. Pin. Using common pins, pin the layers together. Place the pins diago-
nally at each corner and perpendicular to the cut edge every 1 inch.
Since you will not be sewing the hemmed edges together, you do not
need to pin this side together.
13. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock machine.
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
With a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance, running stitch along pinned edges,
securing both layers together. Turn your pillow case inside-out. 
• Sewing by machine: Be sure to use the appropriate needle size
and pressure for optimal feeding. With a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance
straight stitch along the pinned edges, securing both layers
together. Turn your pillow case inside-out.

• Sewing with an overlock: Using a 1⁄2-inch seam, serge along the cut
edges, cutting off the extra fabric as you serge. Be sure to remove
the pins prior to running them through the machine. Turn your 
pillowcase inside-out. 
Check out the scraps after reconstruction in Figure 18-9.
Variations
For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas:
 Raw look: When realigning in Step 8, keep the wrong sides of the fabric
together for an external raw seam. It can be stitched raw with a blanket
stitch (hand sewing), zigzag stitch (machine sewing) or serged edge
(overlock.) You can also incorporate raw edges into any patchwork you
might be doing in creating a large enough piece for your pillow case.

Part VI: Now What to Do with All These Scraps? 
Exponentially expanding dimensions . . .
This might be obvious, but sometimes obvious
things can be overlooked in this ever-stimulating
world. With this, and all the projects in this book,
I encourage you to open your mind to new adap-
tation and ideas. In regards to the pillow and
pillow case project in this chapter, increasing the
dimensions can yield a whole new world. At
about 4 feet square you will have a wonderful
floor pillow for you or your furry friends. Making
the pillow case even larger suddenly turns it into
a duvet cover! 

 Bias tape: Cover the external raw seam with decorative bias tape. This
can be found in any sewing goods or fabric store, usually near the zip-
pers in the Notions area. Bias tape comes in a variety of colors and can
be either hand-sewn or machine-sewn on to cover the edge (instructions
on package).
 Thick stitches: Complete all stitching by hand sewing with embroidery
floss.
 Thicker stitches: Hand sewing over pre-sewn and secured edges with
yarn or ribbon.
 Mix colors: Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements 
the color of the pillow case. With a sewing machine you can also use a
different color for the bobbin thread. With an overlock machine, you 
can get really creative and use four to five different colors.
 Stitching everywhere: Decoratively stitch on other parts of the pillow-
case, marking with tailor’s chalk if necessary. Decorative stitches
include embroidery or deco-stitches on your machine.
 Buttons: Sew decorative buttons onto the pillowcase. This is a great 
way to make use of those odds and ends buttons. Keep within a color
scheme, or within a certain style (art deco, fabric, glass, carved) for a
complete look.
 More ribbons: Rather than just having one ribbon, sew on several pairs.
You can even leave the opposite side of the case open to sew on even
more ribbons for a more symmetrical look.
 No-sew deco techniques: Some no-sew ideas include painting, grommet-
ing, riveting, bedazzling, dyeing, drawing with fabric markers or even a
sharpie marker. Make stripes on your pillowcase with gaffer’s or masking
tape. Spray a light coat of spray paint over it, let dry and repeat until
you get the desired color saturation. Remove the tape to reveal super-
hot stripes!
Quintessential Quilt
Quilting is an art unto itself. I am always awed by the work, the precise 
and patient skill of the quilter. Some quilts I’ve seen have boggled my mind 
in regards to the intricate blending of color palettes and fractal patterns.
However, quilting, like brain surgery, is a talent that I do not expect to ever
possess in my lifetime, and therefore I bow down humbly to the quilter. 
So what does a crafty girl do when she’s got a pile of scraps and no patience
to make a “real” quilt? While you can pick up a book on quilting and use 
your scraps to make a variety of quilts, this project is a little more freeform.
Choosing color palettes is just about the only thing the Quintessential Quilt
has in common with these other quilts. 
307
Chapter 18: Brand New Bedding

This project is rather difficult and time-consuming, even in its simplest form.
Basically you start by patching together small sections and back them to
make mini-quilts. Then you sew these mini-quilts together and finish by lining
the entire piece. 
Check out the scraps prior to reconstruction in Figure 18-10.
Materials
 Large pieces of scrap fabric (minimum 4 inch diameter)
 Fabric for backing (10 x 10 squares; total dimensions equal to the size 
of your finished quilt)
 Batting (10 x 10 squares; total dimensions equal to the size of your 
finished quilt)
 Fabric for lining (size of finished quilt)
 Blanket binding or long strips of 6-inch-wide scrap fabric equal to the
perimeter measurement of your quilt)
 Common pins
 Tape measure
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Matching thread
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Iron
 Scissors

Part VI: Now What to Do with All These Scraps? 

Directions
1. Make a design decision. Decide how large you want your quilt to be.
Being made up of 10 x 10 inch squares, determine how many squares
you will need to make your quilt. For example, for a 60 x 50 inch quilt
you will be laying 5 rows of 6 squares across, totaling 30 squares.
2. Creating the top layer of the square — straight edges. Refer to Step 3 
in the previous project “Casing Your Cozies.” Proceed to Step 4 of this
project.
3. Creating the top layer of the square — patchwork style. Refer to Step 4
of the previous project “Casing Your Cozies.” Proceed to Step 4 of this
project.
4. Mark the cut line. Using your measuring tape and tailor’s chalk, mark a
10 x 10 inch square on the right side of the patched fabric. 
5. Line up. Sandwich the batting between the marked fabric and the back-
ing fabric, wrong sides facing the batting. Line up any corners and edges
with the marked line, so as not to waste fabric. 
6. Pin. Using common pins, pin the layers together just inside of the cut-
ting line. Place the pins diagonally at each corner and perpendicular to
the cut-line every 1 inch.
7. Cut. Cut through all layers along the cut line.
Save your scraps for pillow stuffing (earlier in this chapter) or other 
projects in Part VI.
8. Baste. Refer to Chapter 5 for instructions on hand sewing. Baste the
square from the center out with a vertical line, horizontal line, and two
diagonal lines (connecting opposite corners). Refer to Figure 18-11.

9. Sew your square, using the method below that matches your sewing
method. The instructions depend highly on whether you are hand
sewing or machine sewing. An overlock machine is not appropriate for
this step. 
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Running stitch a desired pattern through all three layers. Be sure
that the layers are bound together along the edges and across the
center, as the basting stitches bind it together. Refer to Figure 18-12
for examples. Remove the pins and basting stitches.
• Sewing by machine: Using any of the stitches on your machine,
stitch a desired pattern through all three layers. Be sure that the
layers are bound together along the edges and across the center,
as the basting stitches bind it together. Refer to Figure 18-12 for
examples. Remove the pins and basting stitches. 
10. Repeat. Repeat Steps 2–9 for additional squares.
11. Line up and pin. Lay out your squares into a pleasing arrangement. Pin
squares together into rows with the right sides of the patchwork layer
facing, pins placed perpendicular to the edge every 1 inch. Refer to
Figure 18-13.

13. Pin rows. Pin rows together into the full quilt with the right sides of 
the patchwork layer facing, pins placed perpendicular to the edge every
1 inch.
14. Sew rows together, using the method below that matches your sewing
method. The instructions depend highly on whether you are hand
sewing or machine sewing. An overlock machine is not appropriate 
for this step. 
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
With a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance, running stitch through all layers
along the pinned edge. Remove the pins.
• Sewing by machine: Straight stitch with a 1⁄2-inch seam through all
layers along the pinned edge. Remove the pins.
15. Line up and pin the lining. Lay your quilt face down. Lay the lining
fabric on top, aligning the edges and corners. Pin from the center out,
placing a pin at each corner of the squares. Refer to Figure 18-14.
16. Sew. Using a hand-sewing needle and matching thread, stitch through all
layers at each pin location (corner of the squares). Make your stitches in
a star shape with each stitch starting and finishing at the center as
shown in Figure 18-15.

17. Place and pin the binding. If you are using strips of scrap fabric, fold
the long edges in 1 inch and iron. Then fold the scrap strip in half length-
wise and iron flat to create a binding strip. Line up your binding along
the edge of the quilt, with the folded crease at the edge of the quilt and
the binding wrapping around either side of the quilt. Fold the binding
neatly at the corners. Refer to Figure 18-16. Pin as you go, placing pins
diagonally at each corner and perpendicular to the edge every 1 inch.

or serge to create an external raw seam. 
 Thick stitches: Complete all hand sewing with embroidery floss.
 Thicker stitches: Hand sewing over pre-sewn and secured edges with
yarn or ribbon.
 Mix colors: Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements the
color of the quilt. With a sewing machine you can also use a different
color for the bobbin thread. 
 Buttons: Sew decorative buttons onto the quilt, ideally where you have
sewn the stars in Step 16. This is a great way to make use of those odds
and ends buttons. Keep within a color scheme, or within a certain style
(art deco, fabric, glass, carved) for a complete look.

U
sing scraps for home décor is ever so much more practical than putting
them in the garbage and consuming more new stuff made by someone
you will never lay eyes upon in your lifetime. Take it a step further and bring
your friends and neighbors together for a scrap craft party! For those times
when you’ve over-committed your creative talents, bring a personal touch to
mass production with a group of friends, bottle of wine and pile o’ craft sup-
plies. You’ll have those bridal shower sachets made in no time, and with no
distressing thoughts of “if I have to make another one of these %^#@$ sachets
I’m going to gag on this scrap fabric!”
The projects in this chapter are small enough and quick enough to do in 
the midst of conversation, tea, and nibbles. I find it a fascinating way to see
new characteristics of people, get to know each other better and develop a
deeper level of friendship and understanding. You can learn new tricks, share
your own skills and make cool recycled projects all at the same time!
The projects in this chapter include two extremes: a decorative sachet to
indulge your luxurious side; and a practical potholder to keep your mitts safe
while slaving over a hot stove. At the end of the chapter you will also find
helpful hints and warm encouragement to take these projects to new levels 
of creative home décor.
Sachet Simplicity
As a child I had such a fondness for all things ladylike and romantic. On breaks
from seaweed wars with my brother and cousins, I was enamored with wild
roses, hand-made lace, and lavender sachets we’d find at local craft shows.

Sachets, while once seeming a rare and indulgent treat to the senses, are now
prevalent not only to hold scoops of lavender, but bath salts, candies, jew-
elry, crystals and just about anything that can fit in a 3-x-5-inch drawstring
baggie. So with this surging popularity, why not jump on the luxury train and
give it a recycled twist? 
This project easy. The hardest part is finding scraps of fabric that are pretty
enough for such a delightful project. The construction is simple, involving
only some simple folding, ironing and stitching. After the sewing is complete
all you do is run a ribbon through the top and you’re done!
Check out the scraps prior to reconstruction in Figure 19-1.

Part VI: Now What to Do with All These Scraps? 

Directions
1. Mark the cut line. Using your tape measure and tailor’s chalk, measure
and mark a rectangle of 6 x 5 inches.
2. Cut. Cut along the line you just made with the tailor’s chalk.
Save your scrap for Save-It-All Stuffing in Chapter 18.
3. Fold. Fold the rectangle scrap in half lengthwise, right sides facing so
that it measures 3 x 5 inches.
4. Pin. Pin the edges of the folded rectangle together, place pins diagonally
at each corner and perpendicular to the edge every 1 inch.
5. Sew using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock machine.
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Blanket stitch the pinned seams with a 1⁄4-inch seam allowance,
leaving a 3 inch wide side open. Refer to Figure 19-2.
• Sewing by machine: Straight stitch the pinned seams with a 1⁄4-inch
seam allowance, leaving a 3-inch-wide side open. Refer to Figure 19-2. 
• Sewing with an overlock: Serge the pinned seams, removing the
pins before running it through the overlock. Leave a 3-inch-wide
side open. Refer to Figure 19-2. 
6. Fold top edge and pin. Keeping the sachet inside out, fold down the
open top edge 1 inch. Pin the edge, placing pins perpendicular to the
edge every 1 inch.
7. Iron. Iron the folded edge flat.

8. Sew using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing or machine
sewing. An overlock is not appropriate for this step.
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Running stitch the folded layers together along the pinned edge.
Leave a 3⁄4-inch seam allowance.
• Sewing by machine: Using a straight stitch and a 3⁄4-inch seam, sew
the folded layers together along the pinned edge.
This step might be easier to complete by hand, depending on your
sewing machine features as well as your experience in using the machine.
9. Turn it out. Turn the sachet right-side-out.
10. Rip it. Using your seam ripper, cut through the few stitches on the outer
layer of the upper edge. Refer to Figure 19-3.
11. Sew for security. Refer to Chapter 5 for tips on hand sewing. Using a
hand-sewing needle and matching thread, blanket stitch around the
opening you just created with the seam ripper. Refer to Figure 19-4.

Part VI: Now What to Do with All These Scraps? 

Lots of decorative sachets are made with fabric that doesn’t run when
you cut it. If your fabric is like this, you can save time and skip Steps 10
and 11. Instead, just cut a hole in the fabric on either side of the seam
for the ribbon to enter and exit the top edge.
12. Lacing the ribbon. Put a safety pin through the end of the ribbon. Use
the safety pin as you would use a needle to guide the ribbon into the
opening, through the folded seam along the upper edge of the sachet,
and out of the same opening. Remove the safety pin.
13. Tie off. Tie a knot in each end of the ribbon to prevent it from fraying.
Refer to the variations listed below for other decorative ideas on finish-
ing the ribbon ends.
14. Fill it. You may choose to fill your sachet with a variety of different
things: lavender, potpourri, bath salts, travel-size bath products, or 
even small food items.
Lavender buds will eventually lose their fresh scent and need occasional
drops of oil to refresh them. Start out by adding a few drops of lavender
oil to the lavender in your sachet.
Check out the scraps after reconstruction in Figure 19-5.
Variations
For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas:
 Thick stitches: Hand sew the top edge with embroidery floss.
 Thicker stitches: Hand sew over pre-sewn and secured top edge with
yarn or ribbon.

Chapter 19: Deck the Halls with Lots of Scraps

 Mix colors: Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements the
color of the sachet. With a sewing machine you can also use a different
color for the bobbin thread. With an overlock machine, you can get
really creative and use four to five different colors.
 Stitching everywhere: Before you start sewing the sachet together,
stitch decoratively throughout the lower part of the fabric. You can do
this by hand or regular machine. With an overlock it will be best to do
the decorative stitching before cutting your piece to size.
 Lace: Sew on lace to the uppermost part of the top edge, leaving enough
room for the ribbon to still go through.
 Buttons: Sew small decorative buttons onto the sachet. This is a great
way to make use of those odds and ends buttons. Keep within a color
scheme, or within a certain style (art deco, fabric, glass, carved) for a
complete look. Sew them in clusters, in a line up the edge or across the
bottom, or just have one especially beautiful button centered at the top
edge (leaving room for the ribbon to go through).
 Beads and buttons on the ribbon: String a bead or button onto the ends
of the ribbon. Make sure the hole in the bead or button is large enough
for the ribbon to pass through.
To help pass the ribbon through the button/bead hole, you can thread it
onto a large craft sewing needle. I have also had luck with knotting a
double strand of thread (on small needle) through the edge of the
ribbon and threading it through the bead or button in that way. 
Pragmatic Potholders
I seem to have inherited a knack for destroying dishtowels and potholders. I
make good use of them and thus turn them into rags fairly quickly. But still
there are those times when you want to have something nice and pretty in
your kitchen. My mom always just bought new ones, hiding the old rags under
the sink for backup, or giving them to my dad for his own messy projects. So
where does the cycle of consumption end? How many car-washing rags does
one really need?
Starting the cycle with reconstructed scrap material, as discussed in this proj-
ect, will take a bit of the burden off of things. And as long as your potholder
doesn’t start to smell, you can always just give it a fresh look by sewing on a
new layer of fabric! Give them as gifts with the caveat of doing the same updat-
ing for your friends. Not only will you be creating a beautiful homemade gift
and promoting re-use ethics, but it will provide an opportunity for you to
have a creative moment with your friend in the future when their potholder
needs revamping!

Part VI: Now What to Do with All These Scraps? 

This project is moderately easy. You are basically making a small quilt with
layers of heat-resistant fabric. 
Check out the scraps prior to reconstruction in Figure 19-6.
Materials
 Scrap material that won’t melt (at least two 6-x-6-inch pieces)
Not sure it if will melt? Hold it with an oven mitt or potholder to protect
your hand. Push it against a hot pan as you would if you were using it as
a potholder. Natural materials, such as cotton, linen, and especially
wool, are ideal for this project.
 Cotton batting (minimum 6 x 6 inches; can substitute with thick scrap
material such as cotton sweaters)
 Bias tape (minimum 25 inches)
 Common pins
 Tape measure
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Matching thread
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Scissors
 Iron

Chapter 19: Deck the Halls with Lots of Scraps

Directions
1. Measuring scraps. Using your measuring tape, measure the dimensions
of each piece of your scrap material. Are the pieces at least 6 x 6 inches
square? If so, proceed to Step 4. If not, you need to patch together addi-
tional scraps to make it big enough. You have two choices, straight lines
(Step 2) or patchwork (Step 3). 
Patching in additional scraps of material can add an interesting look to
your potholder. While the instructions refer to it as a solution for size,
this may also be a design choice!
2. Sewing on more fabric — straight lines. Refer to Step 3 of “Casing Your
Cozies” in Chapter 18. Proceed to Step 4.
3. Sewing on more fabric — patchwork style. Refer to Step 4 of the
“Casing Your Cozies” project in Chapter 18. Proceed to Step 4. 
4. Mark the cut line. Using your measuring tape and tailor’s chalk, mark a
6-x-6-inch square on the right side of the patched fabric. 
5. Line up. Sandwich the batting between the marked fabric and the
second piece of fabric, wrong sides facing the batting. Line up any 
corners and edges with the marked line, so as not to waste fabric. 
6. Pin. Using common pins, pin the layers together just inside of the cut-
ting line. Place the pins diagonally at each corner and perpendicular to
the cut line every 1 inch. 
7. Cut. Cut through all layers along the cut line.
Save your scraps for pillow stuffing (Chapter 18) or other projects in
Part IV.
8. Baste. Refer to Chapter 5 for instructions on hand sewing. Baste the
square from the center out with a vertical line, horizontal line and two
diagonal lines (connecting opposite corners). Refer to Figure 19-7.

9. Sew your square, using the method below that matches your sewing
method. The instructions depend highly on whether you are hand
sewing or machine sewing. An overlock machine is not appropriate for
this step. 
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Running stitch a desired pattern through all three layers. Be sure
that the layers are bound together along the edges and across the
center, as the basting stitches bind it together. Refer to Figure 19-8
for examples. Remove the pins and basting stitches.
• Sewing by machine: Using any of the stitches on your machine,
stitch a desired pattern through all three layers. Be sure that the
layers are bound together along the edges and across the center,
as the basting stitches bind it together. Refer to Figure 19-8 for
examples. Remove the pins and basting stitches. 
10. Place and pin the bias tape. Line up your bias tape along the edge of
the potholder, with the folded crease at the edge of the potholder and
the bias tape wrapping around either side of the potholder. Fold the bias
tape neatly at the corners. Refer to Figure 19-9. Pin as you go, placing
pins diagonally at each corner and perpendicular to the edge every 1
inch. Overlap the ends of the bias tape 1 inch.
11. Sew using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing or machine
sewing. An overlock machine is not appropriate for this step.
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Running stitch along the edge with a 1⁄4-inch seam allowance, secur-
ing the bias tape to the potholder. Remove the pins.
• Sewing by machine: Straight stitch along the edge with a 1⁄4-inch
seam allowance, securing the bias tape to the potholder. Remove
the pins.

Next level
In the same way you can turn a pillow case into
a duvet cover (Chapter 18), you can do the same
with the potholder. Always feel free to take it to
the next level. Following the same instructions
for the potholder, but at approximately 12 x 16
inches gives you a lovely placemat. Leaving out
the batting with yield a napkin, or dish towel.
Making this even larger, similar to the quilt in
Chapter 18, will give you a tablecloth. Take the
tablecloth vertical and either add grommets or a
top seam such as in the sachet project earlier
in this chapter, and you’ve got a curtain. Don’t
ever fear your imagination!

Variations
For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas:
 Raw edge: Skip Step 11, adhering bias tape to the edge. Instead, create 
a raw edge by sewing the edge with a blanket stitch (hand sew), zigzag
stitch (machine sew) or serge it with an overlock.
 Scrappy raw edge: Skip Steps 5 through 8, cutting the potholder into 
a square. Instead, just pin the layers together, baste and stitch for a
scrappy-edged potholder.
Be careful when using this potholder. The edges beyond the 6-x-6-inch
square will be of varying thickness and will not protect from heat 
effectively.
 Thick stitches. Complete all stitching by hand-sewing with embroidery
floss.
 Thicker stitches. Hand-sewing over pre-sewn and secured edges with
yarn or ribbon.
 Mix colors. Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements the
color of the potholder. With a sewing machine you can also use a differ-
ent color for the bobbin thread. With an overlock machine, you can get
really creative and use four to five different colors.
 Bias stripes. Sew on leftover lengths of bias tape to create random
stripes on the potholder.
 Ribbon stripes. Sew on leftover lengths of ribbon to create random
stripes on the potholder.
 Hang it. Using a length of bias tape or heat-resistant ribbon, sew a loop
on to one corner of the potholder. This will make a nice way to hang it
up. Make it even easier by just sewing on the midpoint of a 10-inch
length of ribbon or bias tape. Then you can tie the potholder onto any
open handle or door pull as well . . . no hook needed!

D
on’t sweat the small scraps! There’s hope for them yet! While stuffing
pillows is a great solution (Chapter 18), there’s only so many pillows
you really need. This chapter gives you fresh ideas to make use of these
scraps. In writing this, I’ve rediscovered old ideas and fun techniques
inspired by digging through my sewing trash. It’s a good idea to keep a sepa-
rate wastebasket just for this purpose. At my shop I’m often at odds over
what to throw in, knowing that my 7-year-old neighbor could come in at any
time and relinquish me of my scrap treasures in the blink of an inspired eye! 
The projects in this chapter include decorative ideas serving no function
other than to make a visible statement on recycling. Other projects will keep
your neck warm and body healthy, and still others will remind you of dimin-
ishing waste in our society each and every time you pull out your wallet!
Deco from Garbage to Gorgeous
Someone once proposed “if you could make your own fabric, what would it
look like?” This project is what it would be: scraps and bits of thread and
fabric (see Figure 20-1 for the before shot) sewn together in an amalgamation
of textiles reminiscent of all the creative ideas that they came forth from. Yea,
that would be my fabric of life! 
This project is easy. The hardest part is being okay with making a mess. It 
can also get a bit tricky on the machine to keep your foot from catching loops
of scraps. But this project is very forgiving in its mash-up of textile scraps.
You start by sprinkling and arranging a thin layer of scraps onto the desired
flat fabric that you wish to decorate. Then sew it on to keep it in place.

Materials
 Small scraps of material, no larger than 3 x 3 inches, although long thin
pieces are okay
 Item you wish to decorate
 Common pins
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread of a complementary color
 Scissors
Directions
1. Make a design decision. Choose the area on the item that you want to
decorate. Try it on to make this easier. Use your tailor’s chalk to outline
areas or designs.
2. Arrange scrap material — messy. Take a pinch of scrap material and
sprinkle it onto the item in the location chosen in Step 1. Arrange it so
that the layers are approximately even in thickness, and it is within any
boundaries that you drew with your tailor’s chalk. Proceed to Step 4.
3. Arrange scrap material — intentionally. Place a larger scrap, right side
up, on the item in the location chosen in Step 1. Place 3–5 smaller pieces
on top with minimal overlap between them. Refer to Figure 20-2 for an
approximation of this. Proceed to Step 4.
Figure 20-1:
Before —
Deco from
Garbage to

328
Part VI: Now What to Do with All These Scraps? 

4. Pin. Pin the scraps to the item, focusing on edges that you want to keep
in place and overlapped areas.
5. Sew, using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing or machine
sewing. An overlock is not appropriate for this project.
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Running stitch a decorative pattern throughout the messy scrap
pile, or along the edges of the intentional arrangement. 
• Sewing by machine: Using any decorative stitch on your machine,
stitch a decorative pattern throughout the messy scrap pile, or
along the edges of the intentional arrangement.

 Thick stitches: Complete all stitching by hand sewing with embroidery
floss.
 Thicker stitches: Hand sewing over pre-sewn and secured edges with
yarn or ribbon.
 Mix colors: Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements the
color of the item and scraps. With a sewing machine you can also use a
different color for the bobbin thread.
 Buttons: Sew decorative buttons within the scrap deco. This is a great
way to make use of those odds and ends buttons. Keep within a color
scheme, or within a certain style (art deco, fabric, glass, carved) for a
complete look.
 Beads: Sew on beads in the same way described above for buttons.
 Stripes: Make stripes with ribbon or bias tape scraps.
 No-sew deco techniques: Some no-sew ideas include painting, grommet-
ing, riveting, bedazzling, dyeing, drawing with fabric markers or even a
sharpie marker. Hot-glue all sorts of things on, as long as you don’t have
to wash it. Make stripes on your choker with gaffer’s or masking tape.
Spray a light coat of spray paint over it, let dry and repeat until you get
the desired color saturation. Remove the tape to reveal super-hot stripes!
Choker Chop-Up
I have an obsession with keeping my neck warm. It started on a trip to Paris
when I got a chill that I just couldn’t shake. I soon noticed that nearly every-
one had a scarf on, even if they were just wearing a T-shirt. I grew up in New
England where you only wore a scarf to go sledding, and even then your mom
had to stealthily lasso it around your neck as you were heading out the door.
But in letting go of my stubborn assumptions, I got myself a scarf and
enjoyed the rest of the trip in comfort. I’ve been addicted ever since.
This project is fairly easy. You just wind a long strip of sweater material (or
other stretchy material) into a spiral, sewing it together and binding the edges.
Check out the scraps prior to reconstruction in Figure 20-4.
330
Part VI: Now What to Do with All These Scraps? 

Materials
 Long strip of sweater/stretchy material (minimum 2 inches wide and 
35 inches long)
The material must be able to stretch along the length or you will not be
able to pull it over your head!
 Common pins
 Safety pins
 Tape measure
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Thread that matches the scrap 
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)
 Scissors
Directions
1. Baste. When using knits (sweater fabric) they sometimes run. Securing
the edges with basting or other stitching can prevent this. If the edges of
your scrap are not already secured, hand-baste or machine zigzag stitch
along the edge. Refer to Chapter 5 for instructions on basting.
2. Measure length. Using your tape measure and tailor’s chalk, measure 18
inches from the edge of the scrap and mark this point.
If the tailor’s chalk doesn’t mark the scrap, place a safety pin there instead.
Figure 20-4:
Before —
Choker
Chop-Up.
331
Chapter 20: Decorative (re)Touches

3. Pin in a spiral. Lay the scrap flat. Bring the corner opposite the mark/
pin to it. Pin right sides facing together. Continue spiraling the edges
together, safety pinning every 2 inches until you reach the end of the
scrap. Refer to Figure 20-5.
I like to use safety pins instead of common pins in sweater scraps
because of the loose knit. I find that common pins tend to slip out. They
also have a tendency to get caught up in other parts of the scrap while
you are handling it.
If you have a particularly large head that needs to pass through the
choker, try it on before sewing. Tighten up the spiral to make it smaller,
or loosen it up to make it bigger. 
4. Sew using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock machine. 
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Blanket stitch the pinned seam together as well as the along the
cut edges, making sure to catch every loop of the knit to prevent
runs. Remove any basting. Turn the choker right side out.
• Sewing by machine: Zigzag stitch the pinned seam together as
well as along the cut edges, making sure to catch every loop of the
knit to prevent runs. Run it through the machine a second time to
be sure. Remove any basting. Turn the choker right side out.
• Sewing with an overlock: Serge the pinned seam together, remov-
ing the pins before running it through the overlock. Serge the
edges as well. Be sure to catch every loop of the knit to prevent
runs. Remove any basting. Turn the choker right side out.

Step 3.
 Thick stitches: Complete all stitching by hand sewing with embroidery
floss.
 Thicker stitches: Hand sewing over pre-sewn and secured edges with

 Buttons: Sew decorative buttons onto the choker. This is a great way to
make use of those odds and ends buttons. Keep within a color scheme, or
within a certain style (art deco, fabric, glass, carved) for a complete look.
 Lace and ribbon: Sew in a length of lace or ribbon along the seam
and/or edges of the choker.
 No-sew deco techniques: You can leave the edge completely unstitched
and raw. Running it through the washer and dryer will help the edges
fray and bind together to complete the “unfinished” look. Some other
no-sew ideas include painting, grommeting, riveting, bedazzling, dyeing,
drawing with fabric markers or even a sharpie marker. Make stripes on
your choker with gaffer’s or masking tape. Spray a light coat of spray
paint over it, let dry and repeat until you get the desired color satura-
tion. Remove the tape to reveal super-hot stripes!

Put Your Money Where Your 
Scraps Are Wallet
This project, a wallet, is a great way to re-use scraps from those old jeans as
well as bring a conscious reminder to how you choose to spend your money.
You can trick it out in lots of different ways to give it a personal touch.
This project is moderately easy. You start by making a change pocket on one
layer of denim, and then sew it to another layer, leaving one seam open to put
in your wads of cash. 
Check out the scraps prior to reconstruction in Figure 20-7.
Materials
 Denim scrap material measuring at least 9 x 6 inches (2 pieces), and 21⁄2 x
4 inches (1 piece)
 Bias tape (approximately 35 inches long)
 Common pins
 Tape measure
 Needle (for hand sewing) or sewing machine
 Matching thread
 Tailor’s chalk (substitute with laundry marker)

Directions
1. Mark the cut line. Using your tape measure and tailor’s chalk, measure
and mark a 9-x-6-inch rectangle on two pieces, and a 21⁄2-x-4-inch rectan-
gle on the smaller piece of denim.
2. Cut. Cut along the lines you just made with the tailor’s chalk.
3. Place and pin the bias tape. Line up your bias tape along the edge of
the small rectangle, with the folded crease at the edge and the bias tape
wrapping around either side of the denim. Fold the bias tape neatly at
the corners. Refer to Figure 20-8. Pin as you go, placing pins diagonally
at the corners and perpendicular to the edge every 1 inch. Overlap the
ends of the bias tape 1⁄2 inch.
4. Sew using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing or machine
sewing. An overlock machine is not appropriate for this step.
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Using a hand-sewing needle and matching thread, running stitch
along the edge with a 1⁄4-inch seam, securing the bias tape to the
denim. Remove the pins.
• Sewing by machine: Straight stitch along the edge with a 1⁄4-inch
seam, securing the bias tape to the denim. Remove the pins.
5. Place and pin the pocket. Place the pocket on the large scrap of denim
that you will be using for the inside of the wallet (wrong side of pocket
facing right side of wallet). Place the top edge of the pocket 1⁄2 inch from
the top of the inside-wallet piece. Move the pocket to one side, 1 inch
from the edge. Pin the pocket to the denim scrap, placing pins diago-
nally at each corner and perpendicular to the edge every 1 inch. Refer to
Figure 20-9.

sewing. An overlock machine is not appropriate for this step.
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Secure the pocket to the denim using a running stitch along the
same line you stitched to adhere the bias tape. Remove the pins.
• Sewing by machine: Using a straight stitch, secure the pocket to
the denim along the same line you stitched to adhere the bias tape.
Remove the pins.
7. Crease it. Fold the other piece of denim in half, wrong sides facing.
8. Pin. Pin at the fold with pins placed perpendicular to the folded edge
and 1 inch apart.
9. Sew using the method below that matches your sewing method. The
instructions depend highly on whether you are hand sewing, machine
sewing or using an overlock. 
• Sewing by hand: Refer to Chapter 5 for hand-sewing techniques.
Blanket stitch along the folded crease with a 1⁄8-inch seam
allowance. Remove the pins.
• Sewing by machine: Straight stitch along the folded crease with a
1⁄8-inch seam allowance. Remove the pins.
• Sewing with an overlock: Be sure to use the appropriate needle
size and pressure for optimal feeding. Serge along the folded
crease, removing the pins before running it through the overlock.
10. Place and pin the wallet pieces. Place the two large rectangles together,
edges even and right sides facing. Pin corners and along sides and
bottom edge, placing pins diagonally at each corner and perpendicular
to the edge and every 1 inch. 
The side of the wallet with the crease in the center will be slightly shorter
than the other piece. Keep it centered and make seam measurements
from the longer piece.

of the wallet, arranging and sewing it in place as you did in Steps 3 and 4. 
Check out the scraps after reconstruction in Figure 20-10.
Variations
For a decorative effect, try some of these ideas:
 Raw look: For external seams, pin with the wrong sides facing in Step 10.
Instead of binding the edge with bias tape, leave out this step and blan-
ket stitch (hand sewing), zigzag stitch (machine sewing) or serge the
edge (overlock) for a raw finish. 
 Thick stitches: Complete all stitching by hand sewing with embroidery
floss.

 Thicker stitches: Hand sewing over pre-sewn and secured edges with
yarn or ribbon.
 Mix colors: Use a thread color that doesn’t match, but complements the
color of the wallet. With a sewing machine you can also use a different
color for the bobbin thread. With an overlock machine, you can get
really creative and use four to five different colors.
 Stitching and tricking everywhere: Before sewing the large rectangles
together (Step 10), decorate the outside, creased wallet piece. Trick it
out with decorative stitching, (see the Garbage to Gorgeous project ear-
lier in this chapter) or any of the other variations listed.
 No-sew deco techniques: Some no-sew ideas include painting, grommeting,
riveting, bedazzling, dyeing, drawing with fabric markers or even a sharpie
marker. Hot-glue all sorts of things on, as long as you don’t have to wash it.
Make stripes with gaffer’s or masking tape. Spray a light coat of spray paint
over it, let dry and remove the tape to reveal super-hot stripes!

Experienced sewers and trained professionals may

In this part, I share some general tips and emotional sup-
port for common hurdles. I understand it’s not always
easy to start cutting up your family heirlooms. I’m there
for you . . . with scissors in hand! I’ve also listed tips to 
fix stains in ways you’d never expect. I like to think that
nothing is ever ruined, stains and other wear and tear are
merely a challenge to your creativity.

I
f you’re stubborn, like me, and like to figure things out on your own, here’s
a quickie list to start you off in the right direction. These quick tips will
help you avoid the downhill spiral of frustration while still allowing you cre-
ative license to do it your own way. This chapter touches on some things that
I’ve learned over the years and encourage others to take mind of. During my
course of time in live sewing performances and alternative reconstructive
sewing lessons, these are the things that come up consistently.
Don’t Be Afraid to Cut It
A good part of my commissions for reconstructions are from people who are
simply afraid to cut up the original garment. Regardless of their skill level or
complexity of the project, that first step prohibits them from ever starting.
My rule of thumb is that if the garment isn’t being worn or appreciated in
some way, it’s just taking up the space of something that could.
Let Go of Your Inner Perfectionist
Reconstruction is not about being perfect. It’s about being creative. It’s about
being you. In my eyes, nobody is perfect without at least one imperfection. So
it’s okay if your clothes aren’t so perfect either. Changing your perspective on
things can make all the difference.

My own clothes tend to be tattered rags. I find something I like and I wear it
to shreds. Of course, these remnants and hand-me-downs are usually layered
with my own designs, equally full of imperfections, or those of other local
designers. Typically the whole ensemble comes together with a slew of paint
stains and safety pins, not as a style choice but more out of function and 
laziness to change my clothes before embarking on painting projects. But
because I embrace the imperfections and feel as though they reflect who I am
and the adventures I embark upon in life, often it is mistaken for a purposeful
“look.” I suppose it is in a way, but no, I didn’t lay that skirt down and paint it
messy on purpose. It became like that while I was working on some murals
and didn’t have a paint rag!
Get in the Groove of a 
Good Pair of Scissors
Don’t kill yourself over a dull pair of scissors! A decent sharp pair is only a
few dollars. Splurge on a new pair and save your hands from all sorts of hor-
rible fates. If you are doing a lot of sewing, I recommend getting good scissors
made specifically for cutting fabric. You can find these for $20 to $30 at your
local fabric store, or on the Internet.
Regardless of the type of scissors you choose, make sure they are only used
on fabric. I know, it still baffles me too. How does something as thin as paper
dull your scissors? I do not know but it does! If your scissors are at the mercy
of other hands grabbing them up in a hasty cutting need, hide them! In addi-
tion to hiding them, label them with your name or a clever warning, “not
yours!” Of course it is of utmost importance to communicate directly with
any potential guilty parties and make it absolutely clear that the fabric scis-
sors cannot be used on anything but fabric.
This may seems like a silly thing that you could overlook. But in reality, the
comparison is phenomenal. It is like putting on glasses after not seeing
clearly all of your life. The ease of a good pair of scissors is not only better
for your hands, but better for your fabric as well. Having a clean straight cut
to start with makes a world of difference!
Enjoying Evolution
One of my favorite things is working with flaws and other mishaps. What
most people think of as “ruined” I see as an adventure in creativity. In recon-
structing clothing, it is important to realize that you are not fixing or mending
342
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

the garment so that it looks like it used to. You are not tailoring an old style
to be an updated version of its former self. You are changing it. You are creat-
ing something new. You are creating sometimes drastic change in the piece. It
will not look like it used to and that’s okay. Change is part of life! 
You Are Your Own Model
I don’t size things. People ask me, “how do I know if it fits?” I respond simply
with, “try it on and see how it feels.” Different pieces fit different people in dif-
ferent ways. It’s important to get in touch with yourself, accept yourself, and
get an understanding of what flatters you.
It’s the same thing when making and reconstructing clothes. The best way to
see how something is going to fit is not to read it in a book or from a pattern.
Just put it on your body! Feel it! Are you comfortable? Can you move as you
like to?
Don’t let a number box you in. Sizes change greatly over time and even at the
same time between different manufacturers. They are merely a guideline and
they do not define you! Define yourself and decide for yourself what looks
good on you as opposed to letting some stranger in a magazine tell you what
looks good.
Stains Can Be Your Guide
Stains are often seen as the grand finale to a garment’s existence. I am 
actually really excited, with some exceptions, when I have a starting piece
that is stained. It breaks the standard step by step process and challenges 
my creativity.
Using the stain as your guide and inspiration on a piece is a fun way of
accepting its evolution. Depending on where the stain is and how it came
about, you may want to either cover it up or incorporate it into the piece. 
For example, I once spilled wine on a very special one-of-a-kind silk vest. The
standard response would be to freak out, head straight for the dry-cleaners
and hope for the best. Instead, I decided that I loved how the stain came
about, at a friends’ wedding celebration. So instead of hiding it, I enhanced 
it by dying the entire vest in wine!

Chapter 21: Ten General Tips

Clever Closures
My personal style is for garments to be variable in their size, style and fit. I
like to change things up. I like pieces that I can wear in different ways. I like
layers that I can take off mid-stride and tie onto my purse, backpack, or other
accessory.
Closures such as zippers tend to lock in a size and method of wearing a 
garment. Because of this, I rarely use zippers. Snap tape and buttons can
achieve the same fit as a zipper with a little more variability in how to wear it.
This variability comes in buttoning or snapping asymmetrically, achieving a
sculptural swoop at the neckline and an asymmetrically flattering triangle of
fabric at the bottom.
My favorite methods of closure are long dangling lengths of fabric or ribbon
that double in function and style. These pieces can either be tied, wrapped
around (a la wrap-around skirt style), or woven through D hooks for an
adjustable fit! Still another favorite is using giant safety pins, diaper pins, 
vintage hat pins, brooches, or any other similar pinning mechanism to
achieve a perfect fit that perfectly varies with your ever-changing body.
Pinning for Winning
Common pins are the common way to tailor garments. I’m a little too aggres-
sive for that! They can fall out or get pulled out by getting stuck on other
things. After sticking my old landlord with a pin forgotten in a floor pillow, I
learned my lesson. Common pins are just not for me!
Safety pins, however, are my best friend. As you are trying on a garment to
test the fit, you can pin and re-pin them easily. They are great for test-fitting
the movement of a piece before you sew it, something that is just not realistic
with common pins. They are also, according to their name, just plain safer to
play around with.
There are some drawbacks to safety pins that you should be aware of. They
are generally thicker than common pins and therefore should be used care-
fully, or not at all, with delicate fabrics such as silks. Also, unlike common
pins, you cannot sew over them with a regular machine. For this reason,
whenever it’s necessary to do this I will replace the safety pins with common
pins when it’s time to sew. Of course, neither common pins or safety pins can
go through an overlock! 
344
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Lock into a Good Overlock
People often ask me for recommendations on machines, where to buy them,
what to look for, good brands, etc. When it comes to overlocks, you just do
not want to mess around with a mediocre one, even if you are on a budget. I
made this mistake once and the darn thing busted the second time I used it! I
confess to being hard on my machines, but that is just unacceptable! Knowing
it was a $200 repair, the same price I paid for the machine, I promptly returned
it to the store. So think of it this way, for the cost of what it takes to repair the
cheapo overlocks, you can get a good one from the very beginning.
While I do have certain brands and models that I like, and don’t like, I refrain
from recommending any particular one because I have not used every brand
available. It just wouldn’t be fair. There are some good Web sites that you can
refer to with “overlock reviews.” My rule of thumb is to look at the machines
in the $600 range and choose a couple options from that based on the
reviews. The next step is to search for your desired brand and model online.
If you are not Web-savvy, try your local library for some help! Shopping auc-
tion Web sites, you can find lots of machines that are generally up to a couple
hundred dollars cheaper, even when purchased brand new!
If you are purchasing a used machine, get a warranty or return policy that
you can live with. Remember that a standard tune-up can be up to $80 and a
common repair, at least for me, runs at about $200. So if you are taking a leap
of faith, budget this possibility into a price that you can live with. You don’t
want to be one of those people with a broken machine in their closet or
trying to hock it on an auction Web site to screw some other poor sucker. Be
smart and treat yourself fairly!
No Salvation for Armpit Stains
Please, I beg of you, let me save you from this fate. There are some fantasti-
cally tempting treasures out there: vintage print shirts, sweet little sweaters
and tons of button-downs! Trust me, I’ve got loads of them! But unless you
are going to completely cut out the entire armpit area, do not ever fool your-
self into believing that you can salvage, sanitize, de-stinkify or cover up
armpit stains!
Armpit stains are not only unsightly, but fairly disturbing when it comes to
vintage. It’s bad enough to have your own sweat stain a shirt, but someone
else’s is just plain disgusting. Often times they still stink, too! Ew! I’ve tried all
different means of cleaning, covering up, transforming into a different gar-
ment and it’s still just bad news. 
345
Chapter 21: Ten General Tips

Even my favorite fix-a-flaw tricks don’t work on this nasty business. While
dyeing is a great cover up for most stains, when it comes to the armpit it’s
still obviously an armpit stain. It actually just gets worse by taking on the dye
bath more than the rest of the shirt. Ick! My other tried and true technique of
chopping up into a halter doesn’t even work. In order to get the stain out you
just have to cut too much to get a good line for the halter.
So unless you’re steering clear of this area in your reconstruction projects,
don’t kid yourself. There’s no salvation for armpit stains!

M
y mother and I used to have a knack for wearing white whenever we
went out for Italian food, red sauce in particular. While some stains
can be cleaned up and cleared out entirely, others hang on for dear life. Red
sauce on a white shirt is just one of these, albeit a common dilemma in my
own childhood experience. As I grew older, this culprit changed to red wine.
But with age comes wisdom, and thus in more recent years I have learned to
appreciate the stain-free salvation of sake!
But aside from changing your lifestyle, what else can you do to save your
clothes from the ruin of stains? This chapter lists ten creative tips to disguis-
ing that stain you just can’t get out in the wash. I actually like to think of
stains as a guide. They are a challenge to one’s creativity, depending on their
location, size, and shape. Some can be incorporated into the reconstructed
garment. Others might be small enough to erase or cover up entirely with a
slew of tactical maneuvers enough to rival any spaghetti-toting ninja army.
Brushing Up on Your Painting
From fine art to finger paint, regardless of your skill level, painting over a
stain is a sure-fire way to cover it up completely! Even just a single splotch or
brushstroke can add super-style to your piece. Many of my clothes have dou-
bled as paint rags in their lifetime, and they are often mistaken for purposeful
decorative techniques. Fancy that!
Start off with fabric paint in a desired color. Follow the instructions on the
paint in regards to any heat-setting that might be required. If you have a spe-
cific design in mind, it’s best to practice it on paper or scrap fabric first.

I recommend keeping things abstract, such as swirls, dots and stripes.
Another key point is to be careful of covering too large an area with your
deco-paint masterpiece. Paint can stiffen up a garment, even fabric paint, 
and who wants to look stiff!? 
Dye Do-Overs
This is not your ordinary tie-dye! Dying a garment or a portion of a garment is
a fun experiment in covering up stains. In my experience, most often the stain
takes on the dye bath more than the rest of the fabric. In other words, the
stain comes out darker than the whole garment.
For this reason, I play around with a lot of different dyeing techniques. I 
confess that I am a self-taught novice with this, so feel free to seek out your
own techniques as well. My favorite is grading the shades of the dye bath 
by suspending the garment partway in the bath, and slowly removing it, or
lowering it further, in successive time increments. This is also fun to do with
two colors. Twisting, knotting, and tying with rubber bands, the standard “tie-
dye” techniques can be altered in such a way to not scream “hi, I’m tie-dyed!”
I like to twist the whole garment and tie it into a knot on itself before placing
it in the dye bath. Dyeing it a second time without twisting further subdues
the tie-dye effect, but leaves variations in shades that mask most any stub-
born stain!
Drawing 101 — Sharpie Style
I love sharpie markers! But really, you could use any permanent marker to
achieve this effect. I’ve found that black works best to cover up stains and
still look good. The colored markers, even fabric markers, tend to fade and
look dull even from the start. Besides, a clean black outline drawing just
looks so hot!
Like painting, if you have a specific design be sure to practice it first. Unlike
painting, there’s no need to keep this artistic feat simple! Go nuts graffiti-
style! Personally, I generally keep to my basic abstract lines and dots. I’ve
even nonchalantly outlined stains with my sharpie (oh the things you do
when you’re on hold with customer service!) and ironically this emphasis 
of the stain has drawn some surprising compliments.
You want a really good idea? Throw a stain cover-up party with friends.
Commission a local artist to do it up. Even your idle-handed teenager could
give it a whirl! 
348
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Patchwork Pride
This cover-up technique makes good new use of your old scraps. Just plop
on a patch large enough to cover the stain and you’re good to go. Layer multi-
ple patches, smaller ones on top of larger ones, for a layered effect. Who
knows, people may never even suspect what lies beneath!
This trick can get a bit scrappy if that’s a look you want to play with. In
Chapter 20 I’ve included a project, “From Garbage to Gorgeous,” that tells 
you some fun ways to mash up even your smallest scraps into a decorative
adornment. 
Some stains are in locations that you don’t necessarily want to emphasize 
with a patch. In this case, feel free to extend the patching technique to create a
stripe of several patches along the garment. Another option is to sew on addi-
tional patched areas to take the emphasis away from the singular stained area. 
Turning the Dial to Decorative Stitching
I was a big fan of decorative stitching. I emphasize “was.” One afternoon I was
dragged into a mall and blam, there it was: a mass-produced uber-designer shirt
almost identical to one I had just done for a friend! From that point on, any deco-
rative stitching that I do is generally intentionally messy and over-the-top, using
massive amounts of thread, which actually works perfectly to cover up stains.
Go deco all over the place, either combined with a patch or solely on its own
merits. Play around with layering different colors of thread. At the same time
you can layer different types of stitches in those different colors. Another
eye-catching (or stain-distracting) trick is using an alternate color bobbin
thread while tightening the upper tension of the machine, and loosening the
bobbin tension if needed. The bobbin thread will pull through to the top,
leaving surprise dots of color in its wake.
Seemingly a Mere Seam
For small stains, such as those lovely spaghetti splatter stains, taking up the
fabric in a faux external seam is a neat trick. You run the seam evenly through
the whole garment, avoiding difficult angles like the armpit. Another option is
to go extreme and only run the seam through the actual stain, tying the threads
off midway through a garment. This will result in a puckered look, which is fun
to combine with other elements: patchwork and decorative sewing especially.
It’s important to remember that taking in a faux seam will make your garment
smaller! Be careful! 
349
Chapter 22: Ten Fix-a-Stain Tricks

Deco-Serge Splurge
This fix-a-stain trick is very similar to the above technique but with the use of
an overlock machine rather than a regular sewing machine. I like to use this
when I have several small stains . . . connect the dots! It’s also useful to cover
up splatters from a larger stain. Combine it with some of the other tech-
niques to cover the large stain as well as the splattering.
These lines can travel anywhere within the garment . . . on angles, vertically
and horizontally. Cross these lines to create a patchwork effect in the gar-
ment. You can have even more fun by painting or drawing in the different 
windows made with these intersecting serge lines!
Worn with Purpose
Cut your stain out of the picture with a worn look. I know this is trendy nowa-
days. I’ve had people ask me to hem their absurdly overpriced “designer” jeans
that look astonishingly similar to a pair my dad used to wear to work in the
garden. It’s so silly what a little marketing will do to empty people’s pockets.
Stepping off that soapbox, here’s some tricks and tips to do it yourself at
home, without wasting your money on nonsense and manipulation! What’s
even better is that at the same time you’ll be salvaging that stained garment
from its garbage can destiny. 
How to? Well, it’s time to hit my favorite place for inspiration: the hardware
store! Combining these tools and techniques works best to achieve the
amount of wear and tear, and stain repair, that you’re looking for. For thick
fabric such as denim, cut all or part of the stain with dull scissors or rough
up the edges of a cut with the scissor blade or other sharp-edged tool.
Rubbing the area, cut or not, with rough sandpaper on a hard surface
achieves a very natural worn ‘n torn look. If you’ve got one lying around, or
can wrangle one up from your local handy-person, an electric palm-sander
will ease the hard labor, scrapes and finger cramping sometimes involved in
this creative endeavor.
Exemplary Embroidery
I just love embroidery. While there are fancy machines that do this, it is actu-
ally one of the first textile arts I learned to do by hand as a child. It’s actually
very odd for me to think of it as a machine technique when doing it by hand
was so beautiful. When I was a kid, it was pretty limited to flowers and
scrolling and other kitschy scenes that I soon grew tired of. But now, it’s
350
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

making a comeback in a whole new way. Embroidery mavens are expressing
their skill and creative license with skulls, hand-lettered phrases, and just
about whatever they feel like.
Embroidery can be used to cover up stains or disguise them via enhance-
ment. You can try to give it a shot freehand, but it’s easiest to avoid puckers
by using an embroidery hoop. Stitch around the border of a stain to create a
circle or odd shape. French knots are handy for little stains and splatters.
Combined with beading, sewing on sequins or other adornments, embroidery
stitchwork can bring about a whole different look to your otherwise useless
garment.
Buttons and Beads That Can’t Be Beat
Depending on where your stain is, sewing on some decorative adornments
can be a fun solution. This is also a great way to make use of those odds ’n
ends buttons and beads that have fallen off other garments.
Keep in mind the thickness of your material and the weight of the buttons
and beads. If necessary, place a scrap of backing fabric or interfacing on the
inside of the area you are working on.
Some beads have tiny holes that are much too small for a sewing needle to
pass through. In this case, alternate your stitching through the fabric with
threading through the bead with a beading needle. This is rather tedious and
thus you should mete out your beading expectations accordingly. If you’re
really into gobs of beads, try recycling sections from old wedding gowns or,
egads, buying a pre-beaded appliqué to sew on as you would for a patch.
I like keeping buttons clustered together in some sort of thematic presenta-
tion. I have a drawer full of buttons collected and handed down from genera-
tions. There are definite trends in which to play with: cloth covered, glass,
braided leather, vintage, and of course color!
Combining buttons with embroidery can yield fun looks, especially for kids,
or the kid in us! Buttons make great eyes for fun animal faces, wheels for cars
and even leaves on a tree! Have fun with it!
