M
icrosoft Office 2007 is by far the most 
popular suite of productivity applications 
in the world, and with good reason. Its appli-
cations are powerful enough for business and 
professional use, and yet easy enough that a 
beginner can catch on to the basics with just a 
few simple lessons.
If you’re new to Office 2007, this book can 
help you separate the essential features you 
need from the obscure and more sophisticated 
ones that you don’t. For the four major Office 
applications I cover in this book — Word, 
Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook — I walk you 
through the most important and common fea-
tures, showing you how to put them to work 
for projects in your job, everyday life, and 
home.
About This Book
This book is written specifically for mature 
people like you, who are relatively new to 
using Office applications and want to master 
the basics. In this book, I tried to take into 
account the types of activities that might inter-
est you, such as investment planning; personal 
finance; e-mail; and documents and presenta-
tions you might need for work, clubs, volun-
teer opportunities, or other organizations that 
you participate in.
➟
 
Introduction
Conventions used in 
this book
This book uses certain conventions to help you 
find your way:
➟ Wherever possible, I use labels on figures to 
point out what you should notice on them. 
These labels reinforce something I say in the 
text or contain extra tips and hints.
➟ When you have to type something, I put it in 
bold type.
➟ For menu and Ribbon commands, I use the ➪ 
symbol to separate the steps. For example, if 
I say to choose Home➪Copy, click the Home 
tab and then click the Copy button.
➟ The big round button in the upper-left corner 
of most Office applications (Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint) is the Office button. That’s what 
I call it in commands such as Office➪Print.
 Tip icons point out extra features, 
 special insights and helps, or things to 
 look out for.
 Warning icons indicate potential 
 problems to avoid that are difficult to 
 fix or make bad things happen.

Microsoft Office 2007 For Seniors For Dummies
Foolish Assumptions
This book assumes that you can start your computer and use the key-
board and mouse (or whatever device moves the pointer onscreen).
 
 If you’re using a computer for the first time, Computers 
For Seniors For Dummies shows you the essential skills 
that all computer applications use.
Office 2007 runs on Windows Vista (the newest version of Windows) 
and Windows XP computer operating systems, so I assume you’re 
using one of these. Most of the examples in this book show Office 
2007 running in Vista, but Office works the same in both systems.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into several handy parts to help you find what 
you need and skip stuff you don’t use.
Part I: Getting Started with Office
In this first part of the book, I explain some basics that apply to all 
the Office 2007 applications generically, such as saving, opening, and 
printing files. I also show you some features that all Office 2007 appli-
cations have in common, such as selecting and formatting text, using 
the Clipboard, and applying formatting themes.
Part II: Word
This part explores the most popular application in the Office suite, 
Microsoft Word. This word processing program helps you create let-
ters, reports, envelopes, and myriad other text-based documents. You’ll 
see how to format text, change page size and orientation, insert graph-
ics, and more.
Part III: Excel
In this part of the book, you can read about Excel, the Office spread-
sheet application. See how to enter text and numbers in a worksheet, 

➟
3
 Introduction
how to write formulas and functions that perform calculations, and 
how to format worksheets attractively. You can also find out how to 
create charts and use Excel to store simple databases.
Part IV: Outlook
Outlook is the e-mail, contact management, and calendar application 
in Office. In this part of the book, discover how to send and receive 
e-mail in Outlook, and also how to use Outlook to track appoint-
ments and store your personal address book.
Part V: PowerPoint
In this part of the book, I show you the basics of PowerPoint, the 
Office presentation application. You can read how to create presenta-
tions that include text and graphics; create cool animation and transi-
tion effects; add a musical soundtrack; and share your presentation 
with others, either in a live-action show or on CD.
 
 The Appendix shows some simple ways to customize 
how Office applications work when you start them.
Time to Get Started!
This is your book; use it how you want. You can start at the beginning 
and read it straight through, or you can hop to whatever chapter or 
topic you want. For those of you who are pretty new to computers, 
you might want to start at the beginning. If you’re new to Office, the 
beginning part will give you a good foundation on what features work 
similarly in all the programs.
 
 If you’ve used older versions of Office, Office 2007 
looks and functions very differently from earlier ver-
sions. Start at the beginning for a primer of the new 
screens and where your favorite buttons and features 
are located now.

The Two-Dollar 
Tour
S
tep right up for a tour of Microsoft Office, 
the most popular suite of applications in 
the world! 
Here are some of the things you can do with 
Office:
 ➟ Write letters, reports, and newsletters.
 ➟ Track bank account balances and 
investments.
 ➟ Create presentations to support speeches 
and meetings.
 ➟ Send and receive e-mail.
The Office suite consists of several very power-
ful applications (programs), each with its own 
features and interface, but the applications also 
have a lot in common with one another. 
Learning about one application gives you a 
head start in learning the others.
In this chapter (and Chapter 2), I take you on 
a quick tour of some of the features that multi-
ple Office applications have in common, 
including the tabbed Ribbon area. In this chap-
ter, I show you how to insert text and graphics 
in the various applications, and how to move 
around and zoom in and out.

Part I: Getting Started with Office 
 
 This book shows Microsoft Office in the Windows 
Vista operating system, not Windows XP. Office 
works the same way in both versions of Windows 
except for minor differences in the dialog boxes 
where files are saved and opened. Those differences 
are covered in Chapter 3.
Start an Office Application
All the Office applications are available from the Start menu in 
Windows, as shown in Figure 1-1. 
Office applications are in 
the Microsoft Office folder
Figure 1-1

➟

 Chapter 1: The Two-Dollar Tour
To start any of the applications, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Start button.
 
2. Click All Programs.
 
3. Click Microsoft Office.
 
4. Click the Office application you want to start.
Explore the Office Ribbon and Tabs
All Office 2007 applications (except Outlook) have a common system 
of navigation called the Ribbon, which is a tabbed bar across the top of 
the application window. Each tab is like a page of buttons. You click 
different tabs to access different sets of buttons and features.
Figure 1-2 shows the Ribbon in Microsoft Word, with the Home tab 
displayed. Within a tab, buttons are organized into groups. In Figure 
1-2, the Home tab’s groups are Clipboard, Font, Paragraph, Styles, and 
Editing.
This tab is currently active
Click a different tab to activate it
You might not have this tab
Help button
Figure 1-2
Each Office application has a set of tabs for the tasks it performs. For 
example, Word has a Mailings tab that holds the commands for doing 
mail merges. Excel has a Formulas tab that holds the commands for 
setting up calculations. 

➟
10
Part I: Getting Started with Office 
 
 You might find tabs that were added by third-party 
(non-Microsoft) software. For example, Figure 1-2 
has an Acrobat tab. A program called Adobe Acrobat 
is installed on this computer.
The buttons and controls on the tabs operate in different ways. Figure 
1-3 points out some examples on the Paragraph group on Word’s 
Home tab.
Click the button face to apply 
the most recent setting...
...or click the arrow to open
a menu of other settings
A command button
An on/off toggle
A button set
Click here to open the
Paragraph dialog box
Figure 1-3
 
➟ On/off toggles: When the button is selected (it turns 
orange), the feature is on. Each time you click the 
button, it switches between on and off.
 
➟ Command buttons: When you click the button, the 
command executes. If you click a command button 
again, the command repeats.
 
➟ Connected button sets: In connected sets of but-
tons, selecting a button deselects (cancels) the previ-
ous selection in the set. 

➟
11
 Chapter 1: The Two-Dollar Tour
 
 For example, Figure 1-3 has four buttons in the bot-
tom row for paragraph alignment. The leftmost one 
is selected; if you clicked one of the others, it’s auto-
matically canceled.
 
➟ Menu buttons: Buttons with arrows on them open 
menus or color palettes. 
 
 You can hover the mouse pointer over a button to 
see a pop-up box, called a ScreenTip, that tells the 
button’s name and/or purpose. 
 
 With some buttons that contain arrows, you can 
click anywhere on the button face — directly on the 
arrow or not — to open the menu or palette (an array 
of colored squares from which you can choose a 
color). With others, the button face and the arrow 
are separate clickable areas. Clicking the arrow opens 
the menu, but clicking the button face applies what-
ever setting was most recently chosen from the 
menu.
 
 To tell the difference between the two types of menu 
buttons, point the mouse at the button. If you see a 
thin line separating the arrow from the button face, 
it’s the type where you have to click directly on the 
arrow to get the menu. If there’s no separator line, 
you can click anywhere on the button.
In the bottom-right corner of many of the groups is a small square 
with an arrow. Clicking this button opens a dialog box related to that 
group. For example, the one for the Paragraph group in Figure 1-3 
opens the Paragraph dialog box, which contains controls for every but-
ton in that group plus more options not available on the Ribbon.
At the far right of the Ribbon is a question mark button, the Help but-
ton. You can click Help at any time to open the Help system for the 
application you have open.

➟
12
Part I: Getting Started with Office 
When you resize the application’s window so the window is narrower 
than normal, or when you run the application on a computer that has 
low-resolution video settings, the controls on the Ribbon compress 
(squeeze together). Some of the groups turn into single buttons with 
drop-down lists for accessing the individual controls within that 
group. For example, in Figure 1-4, most of the groups are compressed, 
and one of the groups has been opened as a drop-down list.
Click the button for a collapsed group...
...to expand the group and
select a command from it
Figure 1-4
Above the main part of the Ribbon is a small toolbar called the Quick 
Access toolbar. This is the only customizable area of the Ribbon. You

Understand the Office Button and Office Menu
The Office menu provides access to commands that have to do with 
the data file you are working with—things like saving, opening, print-
ing, mailing, and checking its properties. Open the Office menu by 
clicking the big round button (the Office button) at the upper left.
 
 The Office menu is similar to the File menu in older 
Office applications. 
The Office menu is organized in two columns, as shown in Figure 1-6:
 
➟ Left column: Commands you can select. 
 
➟ Right column: Shortcuts to recently used files. Click 
any of these shortcuts to reopen that data file.

Some commands on the Office menu have arrows to their right. These 
open submenus with more options on them. For example, when you 
point to the Send command, a submenu of commands related to 
sending documents appears.
Some of the commands that have arrows next to them, such as Print 
and Save As, are dual function:

Create a Document
In Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, a new document (or workbook, or 
presentation) opens automatically when you start the program. You 
can just start typing or inserting content into it. 
You can also create additional new documents. An easy shortcut to do so 
is to press Ctrl+N. You can also choose Office➪New. That latter method 
has the advantage of opening up a dialog box where you can choose a 
template, if you don’t want a totally blank document to start with.
Type Text
Putting text on the page (or onscreen) is a little different in each of the 
three major Office applications: Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.
 
➟ Word: The main work area of the program is a blank 
slate on which you can type directly. Just click in the 
work area and start typing! Chapter 2 explains more 
about typing and editing text. See Figure 1-7.
In Word, there is a single work area

work with text in Excel cells.
In Excel, text is entered into individual cells
Figure 1-8
 
➟ PowerPoint: The work area is divided into three 
panes. The largest one, in the center, is where you 
insert content on a slide.
 
• If a slide has a text placeholder on it, you can click 
in the placeholder and type, as in Figure 1-9. 
 
• If there isn’t a placeholder on the slide, or if the 
placeholder doesn’t meet your needs, you can 
place a text box on the slide manually. (That’s cov-
ered in Chapter 11.)
Insert a Picture
All Office applications accept various types of pictures. Here’s how to 
insert a photo (or other graphic file) into Word, Excel, or PowerPoint:
 
1. Click the Insert tab.
 
2. Click the Picture button. The Insert Picture dialog box 
opens. See Figure 1-10. The default location that opens is 
the Pictures folder for the user currently logged into 
Windows.

3. Select the picture you want to insert. (You might need to 
change to a different location. That’s covered in Chapter 3.)
 
4. Click the Insert button.
The preceding steps apply to picture files, such as images from a digital 
camera or that you downloaded from the Internet. There are lots of 
other graphic types, such as clip art, WordArt (stylized text), and 
drawn lines and shapes. Each of these has its own procedure for inser-
tion. Later chapters discuss these in more detail.
 
 You can drag and drop pictures directly into any doc-
ument in an Office application.
Move Around in a Document
As you add content in one of the applications, there might be so much 
content that you can’t see it all onscreen at once. You might need to 
scroll through the document to view different parts of it.
The simplest way to move around is by using the scroll bars with your 
mouse:
 
➟ In Excel, a vertical (up and down) and a horizontal 
(left to right) scroll bar are always available. 
 
➟ In Word and PowerPoint, the vertical scroll bar is 
always available. The horizontal scroll bar disappears 
if there is no undisplayed text from side-to-side.
Figure 1-11 shows several ways to use a scroll bar:
 
➟ Click the arrow at the end of a scroll bar to scroll the 
display slowly in the direction of the arrow (a small 
amount each time you click).
 
➟ Drag the box in the scroll bar to scroll quickly. 

➟
19
 Chapter 1: The Two-Dollar Tour
 
➟ Click in the empty space on the bar to one side or 
the other of the scroll box to move one screenful at a 
time in that direction. 
Click an arrow to scroll a small
amount in the arrow direction
Drag the scroll box to scroll quickly
Click above or below the scroll box

Figure 1-11
 
 The size of the scroll box (the blank rectangle you 
drag in the scroll bar) indicates how much content 
you can’t see at the moment. For example, in Figure 
1-11, the scroll bar occupies most of the scroll bar; 
this means that there isn’t much undisplayed con-
tent. In a very large spreadsheet, the scroll bar might 
be very small.

➟
20
Part I: Getting Started with Office 
 
 You can also move around by using keyboard short-
cuts. As you gain experience with the applications, 
you might find using keyboard shortcuts more con-
venient than using than the scroll bar. Chapter 4 lists 
shortcuts for Word, Chapter 7 lists shortcuts for 
Excel, and Chapter 14 lists shortcuts for PowerPoint.
Select Content
Selecting content is an essential skill for any Office application. Many 
commands in Office applications apply to whatever text or graphics 
you select. For example, to make some text bold, select it first, and 
then click the Bold button. Figure 1-12 shows some selected text.
Selected text
Figure 1-12
To select text in Word or PowerPoint, you can either 
 
➟ Drag the mouse pointer across it (holding down the 
left mouse button).
 
➟ Click where you want to start and then hold down Shift 
as you press the arrow keys to extend the selection. 
When text is selected, its background changes color. The color depends 
on the color scheme in use; with the default color scheme, it’s light 
blue.
In Excel, you usually want to select entire cells rather than individual 
bits of text; when the cell is selected, any formatting or other com-
mands that you issue applies to everything in that cell. To select a cell, 

➟
21
 Chapter 1: The Two-Dollar Tour
click it. You can extend the selection to multiple cells by dragging 
across them or by holding down Shift and pressing the arrow keys.
 
 You can also select text by using keyboard shortcuts. 
Chapter 4 lists shortcuts for Word, Chapter 7 lists 
shortcuts for Excel, and Chapter 14 lists shortcuts for 
PowerPoint.
To select a graphic, click it with the mouse. Selection handles appear 
around the outside of it. Depending on the graphic type, these handles are 
blue circles or black squares. Figure 1-13 shows a selected graphic in Word.
Selection handles
Figure 1-13
When a graphic is selected, you can do any of the following to it:
 
➟ Move it. Position the mouse pointer on the graphic 
(not on the border) and drag.
 
➟ Copy it. Hold down the Ctrl key while you move it.
 
➟ Resize it. Position the mouse pointer on one of the 
selection handles and drag.
 
➟ Delete it. Press the Delete key.
Zoom In and Out
While you’re working in an Office application, you might want to 
zoom in to see a close-up view of part of your work, or zoom out to 

➟
22
Part I: Getting Started with Office 
see a bird’s-eye view of the whole project. The lower the zoom percent-
age, the smaller everything looks — and the more you can see onscreen 
at once, without scrolling.
Word, Excel, and PowerPoint all have the same Zoom controls, 
located in the bottom right of the window. (There are also zoom con-
trols on the View tab in each application.) Figure 1-14 shows the 
Zoom controls on the status bar. 
 
➟ Drag the slider to adjust the zoom (to the left to 
zoom out, and to the right to zoom in). 
 
➟ Click the minus or plus button (at opposite ends of 
the slider) to slightly zoom out (minus) or in (plus). 
 
➟ Clicking the number of the current zoom percentage 
opens a Zoom dialog box, which shows more zoom-
ing options. 
 
 Zooming doesn’t affect the size of printouts. It is 
only an onscreen adjustment.

Each Office application has a variety of viewing options available. 
Each view is suited for a certain type of activity in that application. For 
example, in Word, you can choose Draft view, which is speedy to work 
with and presents the text in a simple one-column layout. Or, you can 
choose a Print Layout view, where you can see any special layout for-
matting you applied, such as multiple columns.

➟
23
 Chapter 1: The Two-Dollar Tour
Each application has shortcut buttons to the most common views. You 
can find these buttons to the left of the Zoom slider, as pointed out in 
Figure 1-14. Hover your mouse over a button to find out which view 
it selects. These views are available:
 
➟ Excel
 
• Normal: Displays a regular row-and-column grid
 
• Page Layout: Displays the content as it will appear 
on a printed page
 
➟ Word
 
• Print Layout: Shows the document approximately 
as it will be printed, including any layout features, 
such as multiple columns
 
• Full-screen Reading: Displays the document in a for-
mat that’s easy to read onscreen
 
• Web Layout: Displays the document as it will 
appear if saved as a Web page and published on a 
Web site
 
• Outline: Displays the document as an outline, with 
headings as outline levels
 
• Draft: Displays the document in simple text form, 
in a single column
 
➟ PowerPoint
 
• Normal: This default view provides multiple panes 
for working with the content.
 
• Slide Sorter: All of the slides appear as thumbnail 
images, which is useful for rearranging the order of 
slides.

Office 2007
T
ext handling is quite standardized in Word, 
Excel, and PowerPoint. The same com-
mands that you use to edit and format text in 
one program work almost exactly the same 
way in another. So, after you master them in 
one application, you’ll be off and running in 
the others.
Some of these standardized features include
 ➟ The Clipboard, which lets you copy and 
move content seamlessly between 
applications
 ➟ Text formatting, which you use to for-
mat text with the same set of Font tools, 
no matter which application you’re in
 ➟ Themes, which help you apply consistent 
formatting to documents created in dif-
ferent programs
 ➟ The spell checker, which you use to cor-
rect your spelling and grammar in all 
applications, and even maintain com-
mon custom dictionaries between them

This chapter looks at each of these standard tools plus a few other handy stan-
dardized tools.
Edit Text
In Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, you just click where you want the 
text to go, and begin typing. (Chapter 1 covers the basics.)
The insertion point is the flashing vertical marker (cursor) that shows 
where the text that you type will appear. You can move the insertion 
point with the arrow keys, or you can click where you want to place it.
When the mouse pointer is over an area where you can place text, it 
turns into an I-shaped pointer called an I-beam. The shape of the 
I-beam is easy to precisely position, even between two tiny characters 
of text. Figure 2-1 shows the insertion point and the I-beam mouse 
pointer.
To insert new text, position the insertion point where you want to 
insert it, and then type the new text.
To remove text, you can use any of these methods:
 
➟ Backspace it. Position the insertion point and then 
press the Backspace key to delete text to the left of 
the insertion point.
 
➟ Delete it. Select the text and then press the Delete 
key, or position the insertion point and then press 
the Delete key to delete text to the right of the inser-
tion point.
 
➟ Type over it. Select the text and then type new text 
to replace it. Whatever was selected is deleted.

 In Word, you can’t move the insertion point past the 
end of the document. If you want the insertion point 
in the center of the document, for example, you 
would normally have to press Enter to create extra 
blank paragraphs until it arrived where you wanted 
it. Here’s a way around that: Double-click where you 
want the insertion point. Even if it’s beyond the end 
of the document, it moves there (and the end of the 
document moves down past the new location).

➟
28
Part I: Getting Started with Office 
Move and Copy Content
For large-scale editing (such as whole paragraphs and pages of text), 
you can easily move or copy text and graphics within the same appli-
cation (even different data files) or from one application to another.
For example, suppose you want to create slides for a presentation at a 
club meeting. You could write the outline in Word, and then copy the 
text over to PowerPoint for graphics and animation.
Here are two ways of moving and copying:
 
➟ Drag and drop: Use the mouse to drag selected text 
or graphics from one location to another.
 
 To drag and drop between applications, both appli-
cation windows must be onscreen at once. You may 
need to move and resize windows to make that hap-
pen. To move a window, drag its title bar. To resize a 
window, drag the bottom right corner of the 
window.
 
➟ The Clipboard: Cut or copy the content to the 
Clipboard (a temporary holding area in Windows), 
and then paste it into a different location.
To use the copy-by-dragging method, select the content to be dragged, 
and then hold down the left mouse button while you drag it to the 
new location. Then release the mouse button to drop it there.
 
➟ Dragging and dropping within a document: If 
you’re dragging and dropping content within a docu-
ment but the source and the destination locations 
are too far apart to see at the same time, you might 
want to open another window that contains the 
same file, and then scroll them to two different 
spots. To do this in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, 

➟
29
 Chapter 2: Exploring the Common Features of Office 2007
choose View➪New Window. Because you need to be 
able to see both the starting and ending points at the 
same time, you might have to arrange and resize 
some windows onscreen.
 
 If you open a new window with View➪New Window, 
the second window will have the same name but will 
have a number appended to it, such as Budget.xls:2. 
The second window is an alternate view of the first; 
any changes made in one are reflected in the other. 
 
➟ Dragging and dropping between documents: Open 
both documents at the same time. You must be able 
to see both the starting and ending points at the 
same time, so you might have to arrange and resize 
some windows onscreen.
 
 You aren’t limited to copying content between docu-
ments in the same application. That is, you can copy 
from Word to Word, Word to PowerPoint, and so on. 
Figure 2-2 shows an example where I dragged con-
tent from a Word document to an Excel spreadsheet.
 
 To make a copy of the selected text or graphic, hold 
down Ctrl while you drag. You’ll notice as you drag 
that the mouse pointer shows a tiny plus sign, indi-
cating that you’re making a copy.
If setting up the display so that both the source and the destination 
appear onscreen at once is awkward, you’re better off using the 
Clipboard method of moving content. This method places the source 
material in a hidden temporary storage area in Windows, and then 
pastes it from there into the destination location. Because the 
Clipboard is nearly universal, you can use it to move or copy data 
from (almost) any application to any other application, even non-
Microsoft programs. For example, you could copy text from Word and 
paste it into a graphics program like Photoshop, and it would appear 
there as a graphic. Or, you could copy spreadsheet cells from Excel and 

➟
30
Part I: Getting Started with Office 
paste them into a Web site–building application, such as 
Dreamweaver, and it would turn into a Web table.
Figure 2-2
The three Clipboard operations are Cut, Copy, and Paste.
 
➟ To move something: Use Cut and then Paste.
 
➟ To copy something: Use Copy and then Paste.
 
 Moving or copying via the Clipboard method is 
always a two-step process.
Table 2-1 summarizes the ways of issuing the Cut, Copy, and Paste 
commands. The Home tab’s Clipboard group on the Ribbon provides 
buttons for the commands (see Figure 2-3), but you can also use key-
board or mouse methods if you find them easier.

Choose Fonts and Font Sizes
Across all the Office programs, you can choose different fonts and font 
sizes for your work.

➟
32
Part I: Getting Started with Office 
 
➟ A font is a standard way of making each letter. (It’s 
also called a typeface.) The letters in this paragraph 
use the Times New Roman font.
 
➟ The font size controls the height of the letters. The let-
ters in this paragraph are size x, which usually is a 
good size for documents in Microsoft Office.
 
 The font size is based on the distance from the top of 
the tallest letter to the bottom of the lowest letter, 
measured in points. One point (pt) is 1⁄72 of an inch.
The default font and size in Word is Calibri 11. If that isn’t what you 
want, you can choose a different font or size.
To choose a font or resize it, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the text to affect.
 
2. Open Font or Font Size drop-down list on the Home tab 
(in the Font group).
 
3. Make your selection. See Figure 2-4.
 
 If you don’t select any text to affect before you 
choose a font or size, the new setting applies to the 
spot where the insertion point is at the moment. Any 
new text you type there will have that new setting.
 
 Different computers have different size monitors, so 
screen size isn’t a reliable indicator of how large the 
text will print. Also, adjusting the Zoom feature in 
the applications can affect how large the text looks 
onscreen. (Read about the Zoom tool in Chapter 1.)

button. In the confirmation box that appears, click 
Yes.
Word, Excel, and PowerPoint all have Grow Font and Shrink Font but-
tons on the Home tab (Font group), immediately to the right of the 
Font Size drop-down list. The Grow Font button increases the font size 
each time you click it, and the Shrink Font button decreases the font 
size.
You can also specify a custom font size. Open the Font Size drop-
down list box and type the size you want. See Figure 2-5.

Apply Text Formatting
You can modify the appearance and pick the color of text.
 
 The default setting for text color is Automatic, which 
changes the text color so that it contrasts well with 
the background. On a light background, text is black; 
on a dark background, text is white.
Select text, and then use the Font Color button to change its color. 
When you click the arrow to the right of the Font Color button on the 
Home tab (see Figure 2-6), a palette of color choices appears. Choose 
any of the following:

➟ Automatic: This resets the text color to the default.
 
➟ Theme Colors: You can choose one of the color 
placeholders defined by the current theme. If you 
later change the theme applied to the document, this 
color might change.
 
➟ Standard Colors: You can choose a standard fixed 
color that will not change even if you apply a differ-
ent theme later.
 
➟ More Colors: You can choose a different fixed color 
than the ones in the Standard Colors section.
 
➟ Recent Colors: This section appears only if you 
select a color with More Colors in this document. It 
provides shortcuts for reselecting a color that has 
already been used.

➟

Besides text color, you can also apply text attributes, such as bold (like 
this) and italic (like this).
Some text attributes can be clicked on and off from Home tab buttons 
(in the Font group). Figure 2-7 points out the attributes for Word.

The mini toolbar provides a version of the Font group on the Home 
tab, plus a few extra buttons from other groups, as you can see in 
Figure 2-8. Hover your mouse over each button to find out what it 
does.

In Word and PowerPoint, the mini toolbar also is available when you 
select text; a faint, partly transparent version of it appears above the 
selected text. If you move the mouse over it, it becomes solid and 
usable. If you find it annoying that the mini toolbar appears for 
selected text (some people do), choose Office➪Word Options (or 
PowerPoint Options, as the case may be) and then deselect the Show 
Mini Toolbar on Selection check box.
Work with Themes
A theme is a set of three types of placeholders:
 
➟ Fonts
 
➟ Colors
 
➟ Graphic effects

➟
38
Part I: Getting Started with Office 
Themes are useful when you want to standardize the formatting across 
multiple documents, or between applications. For example, you might 
want your resume and the cover letter that you send with it to be con-
sistent in formatting. Applying the same theme to both would ensure 
that they use the same fonts and colors.
Or, bigger picture, you can use a Theme to apply consistent formatting 
across lots of documents, and even between applications. For example, 
you could have a Word document that uses the same theme as your 
PowerPoint presentation on the same subject, so they match.
When I use the word “theme” in a general sense in this book, you can 
assume that I mean a combination of those three types of placehold-
ers: fonts, colors, and effects. However, you can also apply more spe-
cific themes that just cover one of those: font themes, color themes, 
and effect themes. This is great because it lets you combine the parts of 
different themes to create your own special look. For example, you 
might use the fonts from one theme and the colors from another.
Instead of choosing a specific font, color, or graphic effect for an item 
in one of the Office applications, you can instead choose to apply one 
of the theme placeholders. This formats the item with whatever defini-
tion the current theme specifies. Then if you change to a different 
theme later, the item changes its appearance. This is a great help in 
allowing you to quickly change the look of an entire document, 
spreadsheet, or presentation.
To apply a theme in Word or Excel, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Page Layout➪Themes.
 
2. Choose a theme from the menu that appears. See 
Figure 2-9.

Part I: Getting Started with Office 
To apply a theme in PowerPoint, you have two methods:
 
➟ On the Design tab, click one of the samples in the 
Themes group.
 
➟ On the Design tab, click the down arrow in the 
Themes group and select a theme from the menu 
that appears. See Figure 2-10.
Click one of these themes
Click this arrow to see more themes
Figure 2-10
Each theme on the menu has a name, but you can’t get a very good 
overall sense of a theme without seeing it in action. Fortunately, 
there’s a quick way to do this. Just hover the mouse pointer over a 
theme, and the document behind the open menu shows a preview of 
how the theme will affect it.
 
 Make sure you have some text in the document, in 
an area that isn’t obscured when the menu is open.
If you apply a theme (or preview one) and it doesn’t seem to have any 
effect, you probably have specific fonts and/or colors selected that are 
overriding the theme choices. Earlier in the chapter, where I show you 
how to choose a font, I mention the Theme Fonts section at the top of 
the Font menu. If you choose anything other than what was in the 
Theme Fonts section, any theme changes you make will not affect 
that text.
So, say you applied various fonts to a document, but now you decide 
that you’d rather let a theme handle the font choice. Here are some 
possible ways to fix that:

➟
41
 Chapter 2: Exploring the Common Features of Office 2007
 
1. Reselect the text.
 
2. On the Home tab, reopen the Font drop-down list and 
choose the Body font from the Theme Fonts section. Do 
this for all the body text.
 
3. Repeat this process by choosing the Heading font for any 
headings.
Or, reselect the text and press Ctrl+spacebar. This strips any manually 
applied formatting from the text. As long as you haven’t applied any

theme’s font choices to be in effect.
You can also apply color themes, font themes, and effect themes. To 
the right of the Themes button in each of the applications are smaller 
buttons for each of those things. Figure 2-11 points them out. Each 
button opens a drop-down list from which you can choose a different 
theme of the corresponding type.

Check Your Spelling and Grammar
All the Office apps share a common spell-check feature that tells you 
what words don’t appear in its dictionary. You can decide what to do 
with each one.
While you work in an application, your words are compared against 
the dictionary, and anything that doesn’t appear in the dictionary is 
marked with a red wavy underline. See Figure 2-12.
Suggestions

Right-click any red-underlined word to see a menu of choices. From 
this menu, you can
 
➟ Click one of the suggestions, and Word immediately 
changes the word to that.
 
➟ Click Ignore to mark this instance only as okay, and 
Word does nothing.

➟

 Chapter 2: Exploring the Common Features of Office 2007
 
➟ Click Ignore All to mark all instances of the word as 
okay in this document only.
 
➟ Click Add to Dictionary to add this word so that it’s 
never marked as misspelled again on your computer, 
in any document.
 
 Add to Dictionary is useful when you frequently 
write a word that the dictionary doesn’t recognize, 
like an unusual last name or the name of a company 
whose name is intentionally misspelled, like Kool 
Kottage. Adding the word to the dictionary helps you 
get it right and cuts down on the annoyance of 
approving it every time it pops up.
 
➟ Point to AutoCorrect; from the menu that opens, 
click one of the suggestions to always correct this 
misspelling with the chosen suggestion in the future, 
without asking.
 
➟ Point to Language; from the menu that opens, click a 
different language to mark this word as being in a 
foreign language so that it’s checked with a different 
dictionary (the one for that language).
 
 You can’t do this unless you have foreign language 
dictionaries installed.
 
➟ Click Spelling to open the full-blown spell checker, 
covered in a bit.
 
➟ Click Look Up to look the word up in an online ref-
erence source. (I don’t cover this feature in this book, 
but give it a try on your own.)
If you’d rather not check your spelling by paging through your work, 
looking for the red underlines, and then right-clicking each one as you 
find it, I have a better way. Go for full Spell Check feature instead. It 
asks you to choose from a similar set of options as I just listed, but it 

➟
44
Part I: Getting Started with Office 
automatically moves you from one potential error to the next so you 
don’t have to hunt for the underlines.
 
 One difference when you use the full Spell Check is 
that a Change All command is available. It enables 
you to change all instances of the misspelling at once 
in the document. But be careful, because you might 
accidentally make some changes you didn’t intend.
To start a spell check, choose either
 
➟ Review➪Spelling (in Excel or PowerPoint)
 
➟ Review➪Spelling and Grammar (in Word)
 
 Word also has a built-in grammar checker in addi-
tion to the spell checker.

found. (It looks nearly the same in the other applications.)

 Opening, Saving, 
and Printing 
Files
A
ll Office apps can create, open, save, and 
print data files. A data file stores your work 
in a particular application. If you don’t save 
your work, whatever you have entered disap-
pears when you close the application or turn 
off your computer. Not good.
Each Office 2007 application has its own data 
file format. For example
 ➟ Word: Document files, .docx
 ➟ Excel: Workbook files, .xlsx
 ➟ PowerPoint: Presentation files, .pptx
 ➟ Outlook: Personal folders files, .pst
Word, Excel, and PowerPoint use a separate 
data file for each project you work on. Every 
time you use one of these programs, you open 
and save data files.
Outlook uses just one data file for all your 
activities. This file is automatically saved and 
opened for you, so you usually don’t have to 
think about data file management in Outlook.

The steps for saving, opening, and printing data files are almost exactly the 
same in each application, so mastering it in one program gives you a big head 
start in the other programs. In this chapter, you’ll see the basic skills that will 
serve you well for working with data files no matter which program you are 
using.
In this book, I’m assuming you’re using Windows Vista as your operating sys-
tem. I point out some differences between Vista and its predecessor — 
Windows XP — but the majority of what I talk about is in Vista.
Save Your Work
As you work in an application, the content you create is stored in the 
computer’s memory. This memory is only temporary storage. When 
you exit the application or shut down the computer, whatever is stored 
in memory is flushed away forever — unless you save it.
If you want to keep what you’re working on, here are some ways 
to save:
 
➟ Click the Office button and click Save.
 
➟ Press Ctrl+S.
 
➟ Click the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar.
The first time you save a file, the application prompts you to enter a 
name for it in the Save As dialog box. You can also change the save 
location if you want something other than the defaults. See Figure 3-1.
 
 For Windows Vista users, the default save location is 
a folder called Documents. For Windows XP users, 
look in the My Documents folder.

➟

 Chapter 3: Opening, Saving, and Printing Files

Click Save
(Optional) Change the file type
Type the file name here
Figure 3-1
When you re-save an already saved file, the Save As dialog box doesn’t 
reappear; the file saves with the most recent settings. If you want to 
change the settings (such as the location or file type) or save under a 
different name, choose Office➪Save As to make the Save As dialog box 
appear.
To change the file type, open the Save as Type list and make another 
selection. In each of the applications, there are three important file 
types to know about:
 
➟ Default: The default format in each application 
supports all Office 2007 features except macros. The 
file extension ends in the letter X for each one: Word 
is .docx; Excel is .xlsx; PowerPoint is .pptx.
 
➟ Macro-enabled: This format supports all Office 2007 
features, including macros. The file extension ends in 
the letter M for each one: .docm, .xlsm, and .pptm.

➟
50
Part I: Getting Started with Office 
 
 Macros are recorded bits of code that can automate 
certain activities in a program, but they can also carry 
viruses. The default formats don’t support macros for 
that reason. If you need to create a file that includes 
macros, you can save in a macro-enabled format.
 
➟ 97-2003: Each application includes a file format for 
backward compatibility with earlier versions of the 
application (versions 97 through 2003). Some minor 
functionality may be lost when saving in this format. 
The file extensions are .doc, .xls, and .ppt.
In Windows Vista, each user has his own Documents folder (based on 
who is logged into Windows at the moment). In Figure 3-1, the loca-
tion is Faithe➪Documents. That means that the Documents folder is 
located in a folder called Faithe, because Faithe is logged in right now.
To understand how to change save locations, you should first under-
stand the concept of a file path. Files are organized into folders, and 
you can have folders inside folders. For example, you might have
 
➟ A folder called Retirement
 
➟ Within that folder, another folder called Finances
 
➟ Within that folder, an Excel file called 
BankAccounts.xlsx
The path for such a file would be
C:\Retirement\Finances\BankAccounts.xlsx
The C at the beginning is the drive letter. The main hard disk on a 
computer is called C. The backslashes (\) are separators between folder 
levels.

➟
51
 Chapter 3: Opening, Saving, and Printing Files
At the top of the Save As dialog box, the parts of a path are separated 
by right-pointing triangles rather than by slashes. You can click any of 
the triangles to open a drop-down list containing all the subfolders 
(that is, the folders within that folder), and then click one of those 
folders to quickly switch to it. See Figure 3-2.
Click a folder in the path to see a list of its subfolders
Figure 3-2
If you’re using Windows XP, the Save As dialog box looks a little dif-
ferent than what’s shown here, the regular file path (with the slashes) 
appears at the top of the Save As dialog box rather than the version 
with the triangles shown in Figure 3-2, and the folder tree (from 
Figure 3-3) is permanently expanded.
 
 If the Save As dialog box doesn’t show any folders or 
locations, click the Browse Folders button at the bot-
tom left of the dialog box. Conversely, if you want to 
hide the folders/locations (for example, if you always 
save in the default location and have no interest in 
other locations), click the Hide Folders button. 
(Those two commands, Browse Folders and Hide 
Folders, are a toggle. You’ll see one or the other.)
Paths are also shown as a collapsible/expandable tree, with the drive 
on the top and all its folders and subfolders beneath. You can double-
click a folder to collapse (hide) or expand (show) its contents. In 
Windows Vista, the folder tree can be either displayed or hidden in the 
lower left corner of the Save As dialog box. Figure 3-3 shows the folder 
tree displayed.

➟

Figure 3-3
You have several ways to navigate between folders:
 
➟ Click a shortcut in the Favorite Links list to jump to 
a certain folder.
 
➟ Click Computer in the Favorite Links list to display a 
list of all the drives on your PC. From there, double-
click to move through the levels of folders to the 
area you want.
 
➟ Open the Folders list. Collapse or expand folders as 
needed to find the folder you want, and then 
double-click it.

➟
53
 Chapter 3: Opening, Saving, and Printing Files
 
➟ From the Address bar at the top, open the list for the 
folder level you want to see the subfolders of, and 
then click the one you want.
 
➟ Click in the Address bar. This changes its display to a 
traditional path (like C:\Foldername); you can 
manually type in a path and then press Enter.
If you find yourself changing the save location frequently, you can set 
a different location to be the default. Follow these steps:
 
➟ In Word: Choose Office➪Word Options. Click 
Advanced, and then scroll down to the bottom of 
the options and click File Locations. Click Documents, 
click Modify, choose a different save location, and 
then click OK.
 
➟ In Excel: Choose Office➪Excel Options. Click Save, 
and then enter a different path in the Default File 
Location box.
 
➟ In PowerPoint: Choose Office➪PowerPoint Options. 
Click Save, and then enter a different path in the 
Default File Location box.
Open a Saved File
Saving your work stores it for later use. When “later” comes, you can 
open the file in any of a variety of ways.
In each application, links to the most recently used files appear on the 
Office menu, on the Recent Documents list. Click the Office button, 
and then click any of the Recent Documents names to quickly reopen 
the file. Figure 3-4 shows the list of Recent Documents on the Office 
menu. As you open and save more files, the list of recently used files 
changes. If you want to make sure that a particular file remains on the 
list, click the pushpin icon to its right.

If the file you want to open doesn’t appear on the Recent Documents 
list, click the Open command (Office➪Open) to display the Open dia-
log box. From there, you can select the file you want; then click Open. 
See Figure 3-5.
 
 If you want to open a file in a different location than 
the default folder, you can change to different storage 
locations in the Open dialog box the same way you 
do in the Save As dialog box.
 
 You can create a new folder in which to save files. 
Just click the New Folder button in the Open dialog 
box, type a name for the new folder, and then press 
Enter.

available views. This list has a slider on it; drag the slider up or down to 
a different setting, or click directly on the choice you want. See Figure 3-6.
E-Mail Your Work to Others
One way to share your work with others is to send them a copy via 
e-mail. There are a couple of different ways you can send copies:
 
➟ Open your e-mail application (such as Outlook), 
start composing a message, and then use the applica-
tion’s Attach command to add one or more files to 
the message before you send it.

➟
56
Part I: Getting Started with Office 
Views button
Figure 3-6
 
 You can attach any file — not just Office data files. 
For example, you can send family photos that way, 
or even video clips. I show you how to do this in 
Chapter 11, where I cover the basics of Outlook.
 
➟ Start composing the e-mail from within one of the 
Office apps. When you do that, a new message opens 
in your default e-mail program (which could be 
Outlook) and the active data file is automatically set 
as an attachment.
This works the same in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint:
 
1. Open the data file that you want to send, in whatever 
Office app you created it.

➟
57
 Chapter 3: Opening, Saving, and Printing Files
 
2. Choose Office➪Send➪E-mail. A new message window 
appears, with that data file as an attachment.
 
3. Fill in the e-mail recipient(s) in the To box.
 
4. The subject line is prefilled with the filename. Change it 
if you want, as I did in Figure 3-7. The file is listed as an 
attachment in the Attached field.
 
5. (Optional) If you want to type some explanation of the 
file, do so in the message body area.
 
6. Click Send.
Click here to send

Figure 3-7

➟
58
Part I: Getting Started with Office 
 
 You can also copy and paste data from one of the 
apps directly into the body of an e-mail message that 
you’re composing. This lets you avoid sending an 
attachment, which might be helpful if you’re sending 
a document or a photo to someone who isn’t very 
experienced with e-mail and might not understand 
about attachments. Chapter 2 shows how to copy 
and paste between applications.
Share Your Work in Other Formats
When you’re sharing an electronic copy of your work, such as via 
e-mail attachment, there’s a problem if your recipient doesn’t have the 
same application in which to view it. For example, if you send 
PowerPoint presentation to a friend who doesn’t have PowerPoint, he 
won’t be able to open it.
There are some ways around this. For example, your recipient can go 
to the Microsoft Office Web site (http://office.microsoft.
com), search for Viewer, and download a free viewer application for 
that file type. Viewers are available for Excel, Word, and PowerPoint 
there. Alternatively, as I mention earlier, you can copy and paste the 
content of the document directly into the body of an e-mail message, 
rather than sending it as an attachment.
 
 Even though previous versions of Office don’t sup-
port the new file formats in Office 2007, users of 
older versions of Office can download a free compat-
ibility pack for Office 2007 that enables them to 
open the newer files. Go to http://office.
microsoft.com and search for compatibility pack.
Another workaround is for you to save your work in another format 
that your intended recipient has an application for. You do this via the 
Save As dialog box, by selecting a different file type. For example, the 
Rich Text Format (.rtf) is a near-universal format that almost any 
word processing program can open, and Word users commonly save 
in that format when they want to exchange documents with someone 
who uses a very old or obscure word processing program that doesn’t 

➟
59
 Chapter 3: Opening, Saving, and Printing Files
support Word files. Figure 3-8 shows RTF being selected as the file 
format.
Choose a different file type
Figure 3-8
 
 Changing to a different file format can result in the 
loss of some formatting. Some features in Office 
2007 applications work only when documents are 
saved in the native Office 2007 format, such as fill-in 
fields, macros, certain types of editable artwork, and 
formatting themes. That’s why most people don’t 
save in other formats unless it is necessary.
Perhaps a better way, though, is to create a version of your work in a 
special format designed for read-only sharing of laid-out pages: a page 
description language. That way, the recipient sees the page exactly as you 
intended it, without having to find and download a separate viewer 
for that specific file type.

➟
60
Part I: Getting Started with Office 
Office 2007 supports two major page description languages:
 
➟ PDF: A format created by Adobe, widely used all 
over the Internet for distributing documents. It 
doesn’t come with Windows, but a reader for this 
format — Adobe Reader — is free to download from 
www.adobe.com. Yes, the recipient does still have 
to download Reader, but it’s just one program, and it 
will work for the content from all Office apps, plus 
many other documents.
 
➟ XPS: A format created by Microsoft, supported 
natively in Windows Vista and higher. Anyone who 
has Windows Vista already has this viewer available.
The add-ins needed to save in PDF and XPS formats don’t come with 
Office 2007, but they’re easy to download and install for free. Here’s a 
one-time procedure for doing so:
 
1. Open a Web browser and navigate to http://r.
office.microsoft.com/r/rlidMSAddinPDFXPS.
 
2. On that page, click the Download button.
 
3. In the File Download - Security Warning dialog box, click 
Run.
 
4. Wait for the installer to download.
 
5. In the Internet Explorer - Security Warning dialog box, 
click Run.
 
6. In the setup program that runs, mark the check box to 
accept the terms of agreement; then click Continue.
 
7. At the Installation Complete message, click OK.
From that point on, you can save in PDF or XPS format directly from 
within an application. Follow these steps:

➟
61
 Chapter 3: Opening, Saving, and Printing Files
 
1. Choose Office➪Save As➪PDF or XPS. A Publish as PDF 
or XPS dialog box opens. It’s very similar to the Save As 
dialog box, as you can see in Figure 3-9.
Choose between XPS and PDF
Figure 3-9
 
2. (Optional) Change the filename if desired. By default, it’s 
the same name as the data file you’re working with.
 
3. (Optional) Change the file type. The default type is what-
ever type you saved as last, XPS or PDF. If you want the 
other type instead, open the Save as Type drop-down list 
and make your selection.
 
4. Click Publish. The saved file opens in its native program, 
which is either Adobe Reader (PDF format) or Internet 
Explorer (XPS format).

Print Your Work
To print from within any Office applications, choose Office➪Print or 
press Ctrl+P. That opens the Print dialog box. Set any print options 
desired and then click the Print button.
The exact settings found in the Print dialog box vary slightly between 
the applications. Figure 3-10 shows the dialog box for Word. Later 
chapters of this book cover each application’s printing process. The 
common features are
 
➟ Name: Choose from a drop-down list of the printers 
installed on your system. (If you have only one 
printer, it’s used automatically.)
 
➟ Page Range: Specify which page(s) you want to 
print, if not the whole thing.
 
➟ Copies: Specify how many copies of each page you 
want.
Check out the arrow to the right of the Print command on the Office 
menu. Point to that arrow to open a menu of other printing choices:
 
➟ Print: This opens the Print dialog box, just like click-
ing the Print command directly from the menu.
 
➟ Quick Print: This option bypasses the Print dialog 
box and prints one copy of the entire document on 
the default printer. You forego the options available 
in the Print dialog box. What you see is what you 
print.
 
➟ Print Preview: This option opens a special view for 
examining a print job before it is actually printed, as 
described in the next section.

 You might want to add the Quick Print command to 
the Quick Access toolbar to make it easier to print 
draft copies of your work. Chapter 1 shows you how 
to add buttons to this toolbar.
Use Print Preview Before You Print
Sometimes when you print something, it doesn’t look exactly how you 
expected. The view that you work with onscreen isn’t the same as the 
view that will be printed in many cases. (That’s especially true in Excel, 
for example.)
Print Preview is a special view in which you can see your pages exactly 
as they will appear when printed. This can help you avoid needlessly 
printing extra copies, and wasting ink and paper.
To access Print Preview, choose Office➪Print➪Print Preview. The 
options available on the Ribbon in Print Preview are different depend-
ing on the application, but you will always see the following.

➟
64
Part I: Getting Started with Office 
 
➟ Print: Opens the Print dialog box
 
➟ Zoom: Changes the magnification at which you see 
the preview
 
➟ Close Print Preview: Returns you to whatever view 
you were in previously
In specific applications, you can do more in Print Preview than simply 
look. For example, in Excel (shown in Figure 3-11), note the Show 
Margins check box. When you select this check box, black lines appear 
on the preview: one for each column divider, and one for each mar-
gin, plus more lines for header and footer boundaries. You can drag 
these lines to adjust the positioning of the data on the page.

 Chapter 3: Opening, Saving, and Printing Files
Recover Lost Work
Computers lock up occasionally, and applications crash in the middle 
of important projects. When that happens, any work that you haven’t 
saved is gone.
To minimize the pain of those situations, Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint all have an AutoRecover feature that silently saves your 
drafts as you work, once every ten minutes or at some other interval 
you specify. These drafts are saved in temporary hidden files that are 
deleted when you close the application successfully (that is, not 
abruptly due to a lockup, crash, or power outage). If the application 
crashes, those temporary saves files appear for your perusal when the 
program starts back up. You can choose to either
 
➟ Save them if their versions are newer than the ones 
you have on your hard drive.
 
➟ Discard them if they contain nothing you need.
To change the interval at which AutoRecover versions are saved, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Choose Office➪Word Options (or Excel Options or 
PowerPoint Options). See Figure 3-12.
 
2. In the left column, click Save.
 
3. In the window that opens, make sure that the Save 
AutoRecover Information Every xx Minutes check box is 
marked.
 
4. If desired, change the value in the Minutes box to 
another number.

Composing Your 
Thoughts in 
Word
I
f you’ve read this book to this point, you’ve 
seen the common features across the various 
Office applications, in a general way. In this 
chapter, it’s time to get down to brass tacks 
with one particular application: Microsoft 
Word.
Word is a word processing program. That’s a 
fancy way of saying that it specializes in creat-
ing and formatting (that is, processing) text. 
Word is ideal for projects that are primarily 
text-based: in other words, where the text is the 
main attraction, and the formatting (how text 
looks) plays a supporting role. Suitable proj-
ects in Word include correspondence, club 
newsletters and minutes, flyers and signs, fax 
cover sheets, mailing labels, brochures, award 
certificates, and stationery.
That’s a pretty broad list of projects!
Because Word is good for so many things, it’s 
usually the first application in the Office suite 
that a person learns how to use. In this chap-
ter, I show you how to get around in Word; 
and how to type, edit, and format text.

Examine the Word Interface
Word differs from the other Office applications primarily in the depth 
of its text-handling tools. Whereas PowerPoint is all about graphics 
and Excel is all about numbers, Word is all about — well, words! 
Almost every tab on the Ribbon in Word has a text focus.
Some of Word’s strongest unique features include:
 
➟ A complete set of proofreading tools: You’ll find 
not only a spelling checker, but also a grammar 
checker, thesaurus, translation utility, and word 
counter. All these tools are on the Review tab. The 
spelling and grammar checkers are covered in 
Chapter 3.
 
➟ Several features for quickly and consistently apply-
ing formatting to text: Word offers convenient 
themes, styles, and style sets. Styles are on the Home 
tab, and themes are on the Page Layout tab. Chapter 2 
discusses themes in a generic, multi-application 
sense, and Chapter 5 covers styles and themes specif-
ically in Word.
 
 A style applies to an individual paragraph, or a block 
of selected text. A theme applies to the entire 
document.
 
➟ A full-featured Mail Merge utility: Use this feature 
(found on the Mailings tab)to create customized 
copies of letters, mailing labels, envelopes, and so 
on. Chapter 6 covers mail merge.

 Chapter 4: Composing Your Thoughts in Word
Move Around and Select Text
In Chapter 1, I cover how to move around in a document and select 
blocks of text. In a nutshell, whatever you type in Word appears at the 
insertion point, which is the blinking vertical line on the page. You can 
move the insertion point by clicking with the mouse where you want 
it placed, or by using the arrow keys. There are also shortcut keys for 
moving the insertion point.
 
 Scrolling the document with the scroll bars moves 
the display (for example, from page 1 to page 2) but 
does not move the insertion point.
A lot of people are surprised, for example, when they scroll to another 
page and start typing, but the text appears back on the previous page! 
That’s because the typing appears at the insertion point, which is still 
back where it was before.
To perform an action upon text — say, make it bold, or move it — 
you have to select the text first. To select text, drag across it with the 
mouse, or you can hold down the Shift key and then press the arrow 
keys to extend the selection. What you selected is highlighted, so that’s 
a good sign. You can also select an entire word by double-clicking it, 
an entire paragraph by triple-clicking it, or the entire document by 
pressing Ctrl+A.
Choose Paper Size and Orientation
The default paper size in Word is 8.5 x 11 inches. That’s the standard 
size (called Letter), which conveniently fits in most printers and copy 
machines in the United States. (Legal size is the other major size used 
in the United States: 8.5 x 14 inches.) In other countries, though, stan-
dard paper size is different. For example, in Europe, A4 paper is the 
standard size, at 8.27 x 11.69 inches.
Whenever Word starts a new document, it does so based on a group of 
settings stored in a template called Normal. A template is a configura-
tion file that governs the default settings for the documents that are 

➟
72
Part II: Word 
based on it. These settings include specifications for a paper size of 8.5 
x 11 inches. If you want the document to have a different paper size — 
say, for a brochure — choose Page Layout➪Size and then choose a dif-
ferent paper size from the drop-down list. See Figure 4-1.
Paper size is controlled from the Page Layout tab
Choose a paper size
Figure 4-1
Page orientation determines whether the height or the width of the page 
is greater. If the text is parallel to the narrow edge, that’s Portrait. If it’s 
parallel to the wide edge, that’s Landscape.
Portrait (taller than wide) is the more common orientation, used for 
most correspondence and reports. Landscape orientation (wider than 

➟
73
 Chapter 4: Composing Your Thoughts in Word
tall) is used for brochures, certificates, and calendars, all of which fit 
naturally into the wider format.
To change the page orientation, choose Page Layout➪Orientation and 
then click Portrait or Landscape.
Set Margins
A document’s margin is the space between the edge of the paper and 
where the text begins. Ideal margins depend on many factors, includ-
ing the document type, the need to limit the number of pages (for 
example, if you’re paying by the page to fax or copy a document), and 
the audience’s needs. Adjusting the margins can also control the per-
ception of your document, making it look like it is longer or shorter 
than it actually is. Many a student who has been assigned a “three-
page paper” has tried to get away with writing less by using large mar-
gins! (Of course, that generally doesn’t work because teachers know 
that trick.)
Word offers several sets of standard margin settings. Choose Page 
Layout➪Margins and then choose from the list. See Figure 4-2.
Each preset has a value assigned to the four page sides. Usually, a doc-
ument uses the same margin setting for opposite sides (the same value 
for top and bottom, and the same value for left and right). This isn’t a 
hard-and-fast rule, though. You might, for example, want extra space 
at the top of a page when you’re printing on stationery with a name 
and address preprinted at the top. And, if you’re going to bind your 
pages or use a three hole–punch for pages presented in a binder, you 
might want a larger margin.
If none of the choices on the list match what you want, choose 
Custom Margins from the bottom of the Margins menu (Figure 4-2) 
and enter precise values in the Page Setup dialog box that appears, as 
in Figure 4-3.

Select the Right Screen View
Like with all the Office applications, Word gives you a variety of views 
to choose from. In Chapter 1, I cover views as a general concept; here, 
I talk about the specific views in Word.
At different points in the document creation process, you might want 
to see your document differently. For example, when you’re hammer-
ing out the text, you might want to see your work in a very plain way, 
without the distraction of multiple columns and page breaks. Later, 
when you’re fine-tuning the final look, you might want to see the doc-
ument in a format closer to how it will appear when printed or pub-
lished on the Web.

➟

Enter values for each side separately here
Figure 4-3
As I mention in Chapter 1, the View tab provides access to all the 
viewing options, and View buttons are also available in the bottom 
right of the Word window.
The available views in Word are
 
➟ Draft: A plain-text view. You don’t see the edges of 
the page nor any multicolumn layouts. Page and sec-
tion breaks appear as codes rather than as actual 
breaks. Some graphics don’t appear, and others don’t 
appear in the exact spots they will be in when the 
document is printed.
 
➟ Print Layout: The default view. You see each page 
approximately as it will look when printed, includ-
ing graphics, multicolumn layouts, and breaks. This 

➟
76
Part II: Word 
view is appropriate for most documents and work 
situations.
 
➟ Outline: A hierarchical view. Paragraphs are marked 
as headings (via the Styles feature, covered in 
Chapter 5) and appear in outline format. You can 
expand and collapse the outline to show more or 
fewer outline levels. Outline view is great in the early 
stage of a project, when you are planning the head-
ings for a long document.
 
➟ Web Layout: A view of the document approximately 
as it will look when saved in Web format. Use this 
view when you are using Word to create content des-
tined from the Web.
 
 Word isn’t the most powerful tool for Web page 
design, but Word does enable you to create and save 
simple Web content.
 
➟ Full Screen Reading: A view that simulates an elec-
tronic book-reading program, laying out text in an 
easy-to-read, book-like format. Text can’t be edited in 
this view. This view is good for reviewing someone 
else’s work.
 
➟ Print Preview: Not really a view per se but an 
adjunct to the Print feature. Whereas Print Layout 
view displays the page approximately as it will look 
when printed, Print Preview displays it exactly as it 
will look when printed. To access Print Preview, 
choose Office➪Print➪Print Preview rather than 
going through the View tab.
In most cases, you will probably be happiest with Page Layout view or 
Draft view. I use Page Layout view most of the time, and switch to 

➟
77
 Chapter 4: Composing Your Thoughts in Word
Draft view when I need to edit a multicolumn document. I find it eas-
ier to scroll through the text when I don’t have to skip from column to 
column onscreen.
 
 On some slower computers, you might notice a dif-
ference in Word’s performance depending on the 
view you choose. For example, when you page down 
or move the insertion point with the arrow keys, you 
might experience a brief delay, especially in Print 
Layout view. If you find delays occurring as you edit, 
switching to Draft view should solve the problem.
Align and Indent Paragraphs
In Chapter 2, I cover text formatting at the individual character level: 
font, font size, and the like. Now take a look at some formatting that 
applies to entire paragraphs.
Paragraphs are the building blocks of documents. Every time you press 
Enter, you create a new paragraph.
You can see the paragraph markers (which never print) by clicking the 
Show/Hide (¶) button on the Home tab (Paragraph group). This but-
ton toggles on/off the display of hidden characters such as spaces, 
paragraph breaks, line breaks, and tabs. Figure 4-4 shows a document 
with the display turned on.
 
 Some folks find seeing these characters very distract-
ing. However, showing them can be very helpful 
when you’re trying to make sure you have only one 
space between words, or when you accidentally press 
the Tab key and make text skip 
like 
this — and 
then fix it.

➟
78
Part II: Word 
Figure 4-4
Each paragraph has a horizontal alignment, which determines how 
each line aligns between the right and left margins. The default is left 
alignment, where each line begins at the left margin. Left alignment is 
appropriate for most situations; the text in this book is left-aligned. 
The alternatives are
 
➟ Right alignment: Each line ends at the right margin. 
You might use this to right-align the date in some 
styles of business letters.
 
➟ Center alignment: Each line is centered evenly 
between the margins. You might want to center your 
name and address on stationery you create.
 
➟ Justified: Each line has additional space added to it 
as needed so that it begins at the left margin and 
ends at the right margin. With justified alignment, 
all lines of the paragraph except the last one are 
spaced that way; the final line of the paragraph is 
left-aligned. If the paragraph consists of only a single 

➟
79
 Chapter 4: Composing Your Thoughts in Word
line, it is left-aligned.Newsletter text is often justified, 
making for a tidier-looking page.
Figure 4-5 shows some examples of the four types of alignment.
Right alignment

➟ To change one paragraph’s alignment: Move the 
insertion point into it, or select any (or all) text 
within it. Then click the paragraph alignment button 
you want. See Figure 4-6.
 
➟ To apply a different alignment to multiple para-
graphs at once: Select multiple paragraphs (or any 
part of them). Then click the paragraph alignment 
button you want.
By default, each paragraph starts in relation to the right and left mar-
gins, depending on what alignment you choose. For example, a left-
aligned paragraph starts at the same position as the left margin, like 
this text. Sometimes you might want to indent one or more para-
graphs, though: that is, shift their position in relation to the left and/
or right margins. For example, in some styles of correspondence, it’s 
customary to indent the first line of each paragraph by one-half inch 

➟

(or five spaces). Or, when citing a quotation, it’s common to indent a 
paragraph by one-half inch at both the right and the left.

Here are the possible types of indents in Word. Each is demonstrated 
in Figure 4-7.
 
➟ First-line indent: The starting position of the first 
line of the paragraph is shifted (usually inward) in 
relation to the left margin. 
 
➟ Left indent: All lines of the paragraph are shifted in 
relation to the left margin.
 
➟ Right indent: All lines of the paragraph are shifted 
in relation to the right margin.
For a simple left indent, use buttons on the Home tab (Paragraph 
group): Increase Indent and Decrease Indent. See Figure 4-7. Each time 
you click one of those buttons, it changes the left indent for the 
selected paragraph(s) by 0.5".
If you want to specify the amount of indent or if you want to apply an 
indent to the right side, use the Indent controls on the Page Layout 
tab, as shown in Figure 4-8. You can increment the amount of indent 
up or down in the Left and Right text boxes.

If you want a special indent (hanging or first-line), use the Paragraph 
dialog box. To do so, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the paragraph(s) to which the setting should apply.
 
2. On the Home or the Page Layout tab, click the small 
icon in the bottom right of the Paragraph group. (It’s 
pointed out in Figure 4-8.)
 
3. In the Paragraph dialog box that opens, enter values in 
the Left and/or Right text boxes as desired to create over-
all indents for the paragraph(s). See Figure 4-9.
 
4. (Optional) If you want a special type of indent (such as 
hanging, or first-line), open the Special drop-down list 
and make your selection. Then enter the amount of the 
special indent in the text box to the right.
 
 In Figure 4-9, for example, a hanging indent has been set 
of 0.71". That means all lines except the first one will be 
left-indented by 0.71".
 
5. Click OK. The indent settings are applied.
Change Line Spacing
If you’ve used a typewriter, you’re probably familiar with the terms sin-
gle spacing and double spacing. You know, do you want one line of 
space between every line of type, or two? Most typewriters have a 
switch that allows you to switch between those two modes. The 
Spacing feature in Word is just like that but with many more choices. 
You can fine-tune the spacing between lines to any precise amount 
you want.

Three settings in Word control line spacing:
 
➟ Before: The space before each paragraph
 
➟ After: The space after each paragraph
 
➟ Line Spacing: The space between the lines of each 
paragraph
In Word 2007, the default settings are to include a blank line between 
paragraphs and to use a line spacing value of 1.15: in other words, just 
a little more vertical white space than single spacing.

➟
84
Part II: Word 
 
 If you’ve used earlier versions of Word, you might 
remember the defaults as different: single-spaced 
paragraphs with no extra space between them.
For basic spacing, you can use the Line Spacing button’s drop-down 
list on the Home tab, as shown in Figure 4-10. The numbers at the top 
of the list refer to line spacing between the lines of paragraphs; the 
commands at the bottom of the list add or remove spacing before or 
after the paragraphs.

Create Bullet and Numbered Lists
Word makes it easy to create bulleted and numbered lists in your doc-
uments. Use a bulleted list for lists where the order of items isn’t signifi-
cant, and the same “bullet” character (such as • or ➪) is used in front 
of each item. You might use a bulleted list for a packing list for a trip, 
for example, or a go-forward list. In contrast, use a numbered list for 
lists where the order of items is significant, and a sequential step num-
ber is used to indicate order. A numbered list might contain the steps 
for a recipe or a meeting agenda.

➟
86
Part II: Word 
You can create a list of existing paragraphs, or you can turn on the list 
feature and type the list as you go. Either way, you’re working with the 
Bullets button or the Numbering button on the Home tab.
It’s just this easy:
 
➟ Click the Bullets or the Numbering button to apply a 
default bullet or number, respectively. The default 
bullet looks like this (•) and the default numbering 
treatment uses standard 1., 2., 3., and so on.
 
➟ Click the arrow to the right of either button to open 
a palette of additional choices. Figure 4-13 shows the 
Bullet Library and its choices.
If you go the palette route, here’s the drill for bullets or numbered 
lists:
 
➟ Bullets: Pick one of the bullet characters on the pal-
ette (refer to Figure 4-13). If you don’t find what you

➟ Numbered lists: Choose from a variety of numeral 
styles, including Arabic (1, 2, 3) and Roman (I, II, 
III); or uppercase or lowercase Arabic and Roman 
letters (A, B, C; i, ii, iii). Clicking the Define New 
Number Format option opens a dialog box where 
you can set up your own number formats.
 
➟ For each numbered list, Word automatically incre-
ments the number. It isn’t always perfect at guessing 
your wishes, though. For example, sometimes you 
might have a regular paragraph (not numbered) 
between two paragraphs that are consecutively num-
bered, or you might want to restart the numbering 
back at 1 when Word guesses that you want the 
numbering continued from the previous list.
 
 To change between continuing the previous list and 
starting a new one, right-click the paragraph where 
you want the change to be made, and then choose 
either Restart at 1 or Continue Numbering. See

In this chapter, I show you how to take advan-
tage of some of Word 2007’s user-friendly fea-
tures for improving a document’s appearance 
and readability.
In this chapter, I start with the Styles feature,

a final look. With styles, you can easily switch 
between looks without having to worry about 
maintaining consistency.
Then I show you how to insert two kinds of 
graphics: clip art and photos. 
I also explain how to make a page more color-
ful and attractive by adding a border around 
the edge of the page, and by coloring its 
background.
Finally, I walk you through the basics of 
creating tables that hold multiple columns 
of information in an orderly way.

Apply Styles and Style Sets
Using a style — a named set of formatting specifications — makes it 
easy to apply consistent formatting throughout a document. For exam-
ple, you might apply the style named Heading 1 to all headings in the 
document and the style named Normal to all the regular body text. 
Here are the advantages of this approach:
 
➟ Ease: Applying a style is easier than manually 
applying formatting. And, changing the formatting 
is a snap. If you want the headings to look different, 
for example, you can modify the Heading 1 style to 
change them all at once.
 
➟ Consistency: You don’t have to worry about all the 
headings being formatted consistently; because 
they’re all using the same style, they’re automatically 
all the same.
 
 Of the several types of styles in Word, the most com-
mon type (by far) is a paragraph style. A paragraph 
style can contain formatting specifications, such as 
font, font size and color, indentation, alignment, and 
line spacing. 
Unless you specify otherwise, each paragraph is assigned a style called 
Normal. In Word 2007, this default uses a Calibri 11 point (pt) font, 
and left-aligns your text. (Calibri is a font that comes with Office 
2007.)
 
 Points (pt) measure how large the text is. Read more 
about this in Chapter 4.

Insert Clip Art
Clip art is generic, predrawn artwork, like a simple drawing of a coffee 
cup or graphics related to holidays. You can use any of the free art in 
the Office 2007 clip art library to dress up your Word documents or 
any Office application.
You use the Clip Art feature to import and embed clip art proper, but 
you can also use it to import other types of media types of clips. 
Here’s what you can add with this feature:
 
➟ Clip art: Resizable line drawings
 
➟ Photos: Pictures taken with a digital camera
 
➟ Sounds: Digital clips that play sounds
 
➟ Movies: Digital clips that play movies
Sounds and movies aren’t used very often in Word because most Word 
documents are printed for distribution, and sounds and movies can’t 
be printed. PowerPoint, on the other hand, makes great use of sounds 
and movies because its output is designed to be shown on a computer 
screen. (Read all about PowerPoint in Part V of this book.)
When you install Office 2007, a few clip art images are installed on 
your hard drive, but the majority of the Microsoft clip art, photo, 
sound, and movie collection is stored online. When you use the Clip 
Art feature in an Office application, it automatically connects to 
Microsoft’s online database.
 
 If you don’t have an Internet connection, or aren’t 
connected to the Internet when you use the Clip Art 
feature, you can’t access this library.
Follow these steps to insert clip art:
 
1. On the Insert tab, click Clip Art. The Clip Art task pane 
opens at the right.

which collections to search. Most of the time, you will 
want to search all these locations. Your choices are
 
• My Collections: Clips you downloaded and saved 
via the Clip Organizer feature
 
• Office Collections: Clip art on your hard drive that 
came with Office
 
• Web Collections: Downloadable online clips from 
Microsoft
 
5. Click the Go button. Thumbnail images of the found 
clips appear in the task pane.
 
6. Position the insertion point in the document where you 
want the clip to be inserted.
 
 The picture will be placed wherever the insertion 
point is. If the insertion point is in the middle of a 
paragraph, the picture will split the paragraph in two, 
creating a possibly awkward look that you did not 
intend. For best results in most cases, position the 
insertion point on its own line, between two 
paragraphs.
 
7. Click the desired clip to place it in the document.
Right after you embed the clip art, it appears with selection handles, 
which you can click and drag to resize it. If you click anywhere in the 
document right after you embed the clip art, these handles disappear. 
To make them show again, just click the clip art.
After inserting a clip art image, you might want to resize it. To do so
 
1. Position the mouse pointer over one of the selection 
handles on the image’s border. You see different direc-
tional arrows depending on what kind of handle you

hover over. (Don’t worry about the green circle at the top 
just yet.)
 
• Round, corner handle: A double-headed, diagonal 
arrow
 
• Square, side handle: A double-headed, horizontal 
arrow
 
2. Click the directional arrow and drag in the direction you 
want. The arrow turns into a crosshair, and the clip art 
expands or contracts as much as you make it.
You might notice some distortion when you resize the clip art. For 
example, when you drag a side handle, the clip art does indeed get 
wider, but it might look like a Silly Putty rendition. To maintain the 
height-to-width ratio so that the picture doesn’t get distorted, hold 
down the Shift key while you drag one of the corner selection handles.

To rotate clip art, click the graphic and then use the green circle at the 
top of the image.
 
1. Hover your mouse on the green circle until it turns into a 
clockwise arrow.
 
2. Click and hold the mouse. You get a circle of four, black 
clockwise arrows.
 
 If your mouse slips and you lose the circle of four 
arrows, just start over.
 
3. Drag the circular arrow left or right to skew the image 
how you want.
To move an image in a document, click the image and drag it. Or, you 
can cut and paste it by using the Clipboard. (See how in Chapter 1.)
Insert Photos
Clip art is generic. Sometimes, you might want to insert a more per-
sonal picture, like a digital photo you took or a picture that a family 
member sent you via e-mail.
To insert a picture, use the Insert tab, as follows:
 
1. Position the insertion point where you want the picture 
to appear.
 
2. From the Insert tab, click Picture (in the Illustrations 
group).
 
3. In the Picture dialog box that opens, navigate to the 
folder containing the picture.
 
4. Click the picture you want.
 
5. Click Insert. The picture appears in the document.

 Chapter 5: Dressing Up Your Documents
You can resize the picture just like with a piece of clip art. See the 
preceding section to see how to do this.
When you click a picture in a Word document (select it), a Format tab 
appears on the Ribbon (upper right). This tab contains a variety of 
buttons for working with the picture, such as adding a matte or a bor-
der. Tinker with the options there. If you don’t like what you’ve done, 
press Ctrl+Z to undo the last action. Or, just delete the figure (select it 
and then press Delete) and start over.
Change the Text Wrap Setting for a Picture
The default wrapping is In Line with Text. This type of alignment 
makes Word treat the picture like an individual character of text, wher-
ever you put it. As the text floats, the picture floats, too. In this mode, 
the options are limited as to where you can place the picture because 
it has to remain associated with a paragraph.
On the Format tab is the Text Wrapping button, which opens a menu 
of alternative text wrap choices. Here, you can specify how the picture 
should interact with the adjacent text. This works on both clip art and 
photos. Here are the choices:
 
➟ In Line with Text: The picture is a part of the 
paragraph; the text doesn’t wrap around it.
 
➟ Square: Text wraps around the picture’s rectangular 
outer frame.
 
➟ Tight: If the picture is clip art that doesn’t have a col-
ored background, the text wraps around the edges of 
the image itself, not of its rectangular frame. 
Otherwise, it’s the same as Square.
 
➟ Behind Text: The text appears as an overlay on top 
of the picture.
 
➟ In Front of Text: The image appears over the top of 
the text, partially obscuring it.

➟
102
Part II: Word 
 
➟ Top and Bottom: The picture interrupts the text, 
which flows above or below it. The picture is on a 
line all by itself.
 
➟ Through: Mostly the same as Tight.
In Figure 5-8, the text wrapping is set to Square.

Add a Page Border
A page border can make a page look more festive and colorful; this fea-
ture is great for family newsletters, invitations, and holiday greetings. 
Page borders can be plain or fancy lines, or can consist of tiny pictures 
repeated in a pattern (Border Art).
To choose a page border, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Page Layout➪Page Borders. The Borders and 
Shading dialog box opens with the Page Border tab 
displayed. See Figure 5-9.

➟
103
 Chapter 5: Dressing Up Your Documents
These buttons turn on/off the 
border for individual sides
Figure 5-9
 
2. Choose one of the presets at the left side to describe the 
type of border you want:
 
• Box: The border is the same on all sides.
 
• Shadow: The border is thicker at the left and 
bottom.
 
• 3-D: A 3-D effect is applied to the border. (The 
effect is not always obvious, depending on other 
choices you make.)
 
• Custom: You can specify different settings for each 
side of the border individually.
 
3. Choose a line style from the Style list.
 
4. Choose a line color from the Color list.
 
5. Choose a width from the Width list.

6. Check the sample in the Preview area to make sure it’s 
how you want it. Make any changes needed.
 
7. Click OK to apply the border.
You can also create a border by using artwork. This is where it gets 
really fun! For example, for a Christmas letter, you could have a 
border made of holly leaves or trees; for a birthday party, you could 
have a border made of slices of cake.
 
1. Choose Page Layout➪Page Borders. The Borders and 
Shading dialog box opens with the Page Border tab 
displayed.
 
2. Open the Art drop-down list and select the picture you 
want to use.
 
3. In the Width box, enter the size (in points; pt) you want 
for the border’s width. An average size border might be 
30pt, for example.
 
4. Click OK. Figure 5-10 shows an art-based border.

 Chapter 5: Dressing Up Your Documents
Apply a Background Color to a Page
Besides page borders, another way to dress up a page is to give it a 
colored background. Be aware, though, that if you print a page with 
a colored background, one of two things will happen:
 
➟ Word will print it without the background, and 
any special formatting that relies on the background 
might not look right. For example, if you have a 
black background and set the text color to yellow, 
you might end up with a barely readable document 
with yellow text on a white page.
 
➟ Word will print it with the background, meaning 
that you’ll use a lot of ink in your printer.
 
 Background colors are most useful in documents that 
will be distributed online — such as via e-mail — 
rather than printed.
Background colors do not print by default. If you want to make them 
print, choose Office➪Print. Then click the Options button. Mark the 
Print Background Colors and Images check box, and then click OK. 
To set a background color (and “set” can mean to add or remove), 
follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Page Layout➪Page Color. A color palette appears.
 
2. Make your choice:
 
• Click the color you want to use for the page 
background.
 
• Choose No Color to remove any existing 
background.

➟
106
Part II: Word 
Like with many parts of Office, the color palette contains theme colors 
and fixed colors. As you can read in Chapter 2, theme colors are the 
color placeholders defined by the document’s theme; they change if 
you choose a different theme. Comparatively, fixed colors don’t change. 
See Figure 5-11.
More Colors provides
additional standard color choices
Figure 5-11
You can also choose Fill Effects from the color palette. This opens the 
Fill Effects dialog box, where you can set up any of four types of fill 
effects:
 
➟ Gradient: A gradual blending between one color and 
another, like with a vibrant sunset
 
➟ Texture: A repeating graphic that looks like a certain 
type of surface, such as wood, concrete, or paper
 
➟ Pattern: A pattern of lines and/or dots in one color, 
with a contrasting background color
 
➟ Picture: An image (that you pick from the images 
stored on your hard drive) that fills the entire 
background

➟
107
 Chapter 5: Dressing Up Your Documents
The details of using each of these fill effects is beyond the scope of 
this book, but you can experiment with them on your own. And don’t 
forget, you can use the Help system in Word (press F1 or click the 
question mark button) to get more information about any feature.
Create Tables
A table is a grid of rows and columns, somewhat like a spreadsheet in 
Excel. Tables are useful for displaying information in multicolumn lay-
outs, such as address lists. Figure 5-12 shows a table in a document.
Figure 5-12
You can create two kinds of column-based layouts in Word. One kind 
is a multicolumn table, which I describe here. The other kind is the 
newspaper style, where text flows all the way from the top of the page to 
the bottom in one column, and then loops up to the next column. I 
don’t cover that feature in this book, but you can play with it on your 
own by choosing Page Layout➪Columns.
Here’s one way to insert a table:
 
1. Position the insertion point where you want the table to 
appear.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Table. A menu opens that includes a grid 
of squares.
 
3. Drag your mouse across the grid until you highlight how 
many rows and columns you want. For example, in 
Figure 5-13, I’m selecting three columns and two rows.

➟
108
Part II: Word 
 
4. Release the mouse button. The table appears in the 
document.
Drag across the number of cells you want
Preview of table appears in this document
Figure 5-13
 
 If you have trouble selecting the right number of 
squares on the grid, choose Insert➪Table➪Insert 
Table. In the dialog box that appears, you can type a 
number of rows and columns you want.
To enter text into the table, just click inside the desired cell and start 
typing. You can move the insertion point from one cell to the next by 
pressing the Tab key, or move to the previous cell by pressing 
Shift+Tab.
When a table is active (that is, when the insertion point is anywhere 
within it), two extra tabs appear on the ribbon, under the heading 
Table Tools:

➟
109
 Chapter 5: Dressing Up Your Documents
 
➟ Design: Contains commands and buttons for for-
matting the table
 
➟ Layout: Contains commands and buttons for chang-
ing the structure of the table
To change the number of rows or columns in the table, use the Layout 
tab, shown in Figure 5-14. 
Insert rows or columns
Delete rows or columns
Change cell height
Change cell width
Figure 5-14
 
➟ To delete a row or column: Select it (drag across its 
cells) and then choose Layout➪Delete.
 
➟ To insert a row or column: Click in a row or col-
umn that is adjacent to where you want the inser-
tion, and then click one of the buttons on the Layout 
tab that describes the insertion you want: Insert 
Above, Insert Below, Insert Left, or Insert Right.
 
 If you have trouble dragging to select a row or col-
umn to work with, try using the Select button on the 
Layout tab. Clicking it opens a menu of things you 
can select: Cell, Row, Column, or Table.
The height of each cell changes automatically depending on the cell 
contents. You don’t have to change the size unless you want extra 
vertical blank space in the cell. You can specify a cell height in the 
Cell Size group on the Layout tab (refer to Figure 5-14).

➟
110
Part II: Word 
More commonly, you’ll need to change a column’s width instead of a 
row’s height. Here’s how:
 
➟ Position the mouse pointer over one of the table’s 
vertical gridlines. The mouse pointer turns into an 
I-beam with arrows on each side. Then drag to adjust 
the width.
 
➟ Click in a cell and then enter a number (in inches) 
in the Cell Width box on the Layout tab.
 
➟ Click AutoFit on the Layout tab to open a menu of 
AutoFit options. From there, click AutoFit Contents 
to automatically adjust the column width to fit the 
widest entry in that column.
Format a Table
You can manually format a table and its content in much the same 
way you format any other text: Use the formatting commands on the 
Home tab, for example. But the Design tab also has special formatting 
controls that apply specifically to tables.  
For example, you can apply table styles to a table to automatically 
apply border and shading colors and styles, to automatically autofit 
the content, and to automatically apply different font formatting for 
the heading rows.
To apply a table style, follow these steps:
 
1. Click anywhere in the table. You don’t have to select the 
whole table.
 
2. On the Design tab, click the down arrow to the right of 
the Table Style samples to open the full list of table 
styles.

➟
111
 Chapter 5: Dressing Up Your Documents
 
3. While the list is open, point to a style. You can see a pre-
view of it applied to your table, behind the open list. 
Figure 5-15 shows an example of that.
 
4. Click the style you want to apply.
Table Style Options fine-tune the way table styles are applied
Figure 5-15
The check boxes in the Table Style Options group enable you to 
specify how the table style will be applied. For example, you can 
choose whether the header row is formatted differently than the rest 
of the table. If you choose Banded Rows, every other row will have a 
different color background, for easier reading.

Taking Word to 
the Next Level
W
ord has so many features and capabilities 
that most people don’t even scratch the 
surface of what it can do. And that’s okay! 
Word is a good tool partly because it’s accessi-
ble at a variety of levels. I won’t try to trans-
form you into a Word guru, but I do want to 
show you some fairly simple features that you 
can use to make a big difference in your 
documents.
I start this chapter by showing you how to 
number the pages of a document, and also 
how to create headers and footers that repeat 
the same text at the top or bottom of each 
page. Then I show you how to insert cover 
pages and other special-purpose elements — 
building blocks — that can add style and beauty 
to your documents with a minimum of effort.
And when you print a letter, you also often 
need an envelope, so I show you how to gener-
ate envelopes in Word (and how to feed them 
into your printer).
Finally, I tackle mail merge: merging a form 
letter with a list of addresses. This helpful 
Word tool really isn’t as hard as some people 
make it out to be.

Number the Pages
Have you ever dropped a stack of papers that needed to stay in a cer-
tain order? If the pages were numbered, putting them back together 
was fairly simple. If not, ugh: what a frustrating, time-consuming task.
Fortunately, Word makes it very easy to number your document pages. 
And you can choose from a variety of numbering styles and formats.
When you number pages in Word, you don’t have to manually type 
the numbers onto each page. Instead, you place a code in the docu-
ment that does the numbering for you automatically. Sweet!
Here’s how it works. Each document has a header and footer area 
where you can place information you want repeated on every page. 
I explain more about headers and footers later in this chapter, but 
the important thing to know here is that when you use the Page 
Numbering feature in Word, it automatically inserts the proper code in 
either the header or the footer so that each page is numbered consecu-
tively. These page numbers are visible only in Print Layout view, Full 
Screen Reading view, Print Preview, and on the printouts themselves. 
You won’t see the page numbers if you are working in Draft view, even 
though they are there. 
For simple page numbering at the bottom of each page (the footer), 
follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Insert➪Page Number. (Look in the Header & 
Footer group.)
 
2. In the menu that appears, point to Bottom of Page. A 
submenu appears showing various samples of bottom-of-
page numbering. See Figure 6-1. There are many samples; 
use the scroll bar on the list to see them.

➟
115
 Chapter 6: Taking Word to the Next Level
Figure 6-1
 
3. Click a sample to select it. The code for the page number-
ing is placed in the document footer, in the format you 
choose.
 
 For a plain page number, select one of the first three 
samples: Plain Number 1, Plain Number 2, or Plain 
Number 3. They are all identical except for the posi-
tioning of the number (at the left, center, or right, 
respectively).
 
4. To return to editing the main document (leaving the 
footer), double-click anywhere within the body of your 
document.

➟
116
Part II: Word 
Notice in Figure 6-1 the other page number position options besides 
Bottom of Page:
 
➟ Top of Page: Places the page number code in the 
header (top of the page). The page numbers appear 
on every page.
 
➟ Page Margins: Places the page number code on the 
side of the page. The page numbers appear on every 
page.
 
➟ Current Position: Places the page number code at 
the insertion point in the document (as a one-time 
thing). Because the code is not in the header or 
footer, it doesn’t repeat on each page. It’s a one-time 
thing. You might use this to create a cross-reference 
to content that’s on another page, for example.
 
➟ Format Page Numbers: Opens a dialog box where 
you can fine-tune the formatting of the page num-
bering code, such as using roman numerals or letters 
instead of digits.
 
➟ Remove Page Numbers: Removes existing page 
numbering code(s).
Use Headers and Footers
In addition to a page number, you can put other content in the header 
and footer areas of your document. For example, if you’re typing the 
minutes of a club meeting, you might want to put the club’s name in 
the header so that it appears across the top of each page.
Every document has a header and footer area, which are both empty 
by default. The header and footer appear in Print Layout view, Full 
Page Reading view, and Web Layout view, and also on the printed 
page. (If you are in Draft view, you might want to switch to Print 
Layout view to follow along in this section more easily.)

➟
117
 Chapter 6: Taking Word to the Next Level
Here are two ways of putting content into them:
 
➟ Manually: In Print Layout view, double-click in the 
header or footer of the page. (Choose View➪Print 
Layout; see Chapter 1.) This puts you in the Header 
and Footer editing mode, where you can type text 
directly into those areas. See Figure 6-2.
 
 The body of the document cannot be edited while 
you are in this mode. To resume working within the 
main part of the document, double-click the main 
document (anywhere below the header or above the 
footer).
Double-click top of page to enable Header area
When insertion point is in Header, main document is read-only

➟ Let Word help: Choose Insert➪Header or Insert➪
Footer and then select a preformatted header or 
footer placeholder. This also places you in Header

and Footer editing mode automatically, and you can 
edit the text in the placeholders that were inserted. 
Depending on the sample you pick, there might be 
not only a text placeholder but also a page-number-
ing code. This saves you the step of inserting the 
page-numbering code separately. Figure 6-3 shows 
the Footer menu and an inserted footer.

➟
119
 Chapter 6: Taking Word to the Next Level
You can manually insert a page-numbering code into a header or 
footer as well as codes for the current date, time, and other informa-
tion. When the insertion point is in the header or footer area, the 
Design tab appears on the Ribbon. On that tab are buttons for insert-
ing various types of codes like that. See Figure 6-4.
Also in Figure 6-4, notice the check boxes in the Options group. Here, 
you can specify that you want a different header and footer for the first 
page (for example, so you can have a cover page without header and 
footer text), or that you want separate headers and footers for odd and 
even pages (for example, for a double-sided booklet where the page 
numbers should always be on the outside edge).
Finally, notice in Figure 6-4 that in the Position group, you can con-
trol the amount of space allotted to the header and footer. By default, 
each is one-half inch tall. You can change these values in the Header 
from Top and Footer from Bottom list boxes.

Insert Cover Pages and Other Building Blocks 
Many different document types can benefit from a good-looking cover 
page: a committee report, a proposal for a home business, or a family 
album. Word 2007 offers a large gallery of sample cover pages that 
you can insert into your document and then customize.

➟
120
Part II: Word 
Cover pages are automatically placed at the beginning of the document, 
before the current first page. You don’t have to position the insertion 
point at the beginning of the document before you insert them.
To insert a cover page, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Insert➪Cover Page. A palette of cover page 
samples appears. See Figure 6-5.
Figure 6-5
 
2. Click the cover page you want to insert. It is placed at the 
beginning of the document. 
 
3. Fill in the placeholders on the cover page as desired.

➟
121
 Chapter 6: Taking Word to the Next Level
To delete a cover page, choose Insert➪Cover Page➪Remove Current

Cover pages are just one of several types of preformatted sample con-
tent that Word collectively calls building blocks. The page numbering 
samples I show you earlier in this chapter are building blocks, as are 
preformatted headers and footers.
To see all the building blocks that Word offers in one convenient 
place, choose Insert➪Quick Parts➪Building Blocks Organizer. This 
opens the Building Blocks Organizer dialog box, shown in Figure 6-6.

Print an Envelope
Envelopes are the natural companions of business and personal letters. 
Most of the time, when you print a letter, you also want an envelope 
for it. You can address the envelope by hand, of course, but printing 
an envelope is quick and easy in Word.
One nice thing about the Envelopes feature in Word is that it can 
automatically extract the mailing address from the letter, so you don’t 
have to retype it. It also stores your return address, and recalls it for 
you each time you print an envelope.
If your letter contains the recipient’s name and mailing address, follow 
these steps to create an envelope for it:
 
1. Open the letter in Word.
 
2. Choose Mailings➪Envelopes. The Envelopes and Labels 
dialog box opens. If the letter contains a valid address, 
that address is automatically filled into the Delivery 
Address field, as shown in Figure 6-7.
Figure 6-7

➟
123
 Chapter 6: Taking Word to the Next Level
 
3. (Optional) Type your return address in the Return 
Address field if it doesn’t already appear there.
 
 If the return address appears but you don’t want to 
use it (this time only), mark the Omit check box. 
(This keeps the return address on file for later use.) 
You wouldn’t want to use a return address if you’re 
using envelopes with the return address preprinted, or 
if you’re going to use stick-on return address labels.
 
4. Feed an envelope into your printer.
 
5. Click Print. The envelope prints.
If the envelope printing doesn’t go as you expected — say, it prints on 
the wrong side, or it’s not lined up correctly — you might need to try 
again and change the orientation at which you feed it into the printer. 
For example, you might need to feed it in sideways, rotated 180 
degrees, or upside-down.
 
 To avoid wasting an envelope, do a test print using 
plain paper. Draw an arrow on a piece of paper, and 
put it into your printer’s paper tray, face up, arrow 
facing in. Then print an envelope on that paper. The 
relationship between the printout and the arrow can 
tell you how to orient the envelopes you feed in. For 
example, if the arrow is on the reverse side from the 
printing, you know that envelopes need to be fed 
into the printer flap-up.
Perform a Mail Merge
A mail merge combines a list of names and addresses (that is, mailing 
information) with a form letter, a label, or an envelope template to 

➟
124
Part II: Word 
produce customized copies of the letter for each person. Big companies 
use mail merge to mail customized advertisements, but it’s not just for 
businesses. Home users can take advantage of mail merge for Christmas 
card mailing labels, party invitations, club newsletters, and more.
The three steps to a mail merge are
 
1. Create (or identify) the data source.
 
2. Create the main document and then insert the merge 
codes in it.
 
3. Perform the merge operation between the data source 
and the main document.
Start with the options for data sources. The data source must be a 
delimited file. In other words, there has to be some consistent way that 
it distinguishes between one column or row of data and the next.
 
➟ Excel, Word table: If the data source is an Excel 
spreadsheet, as in Figure 6-8, each type of informa-
tion is in a separate column. The same goes if the 
data source is a Word table.
Figure 6-8
 
➟ Plain text: If the data source is a plain text file, each 
column is delimited by a specific character, such as 
tab or a comma. In Figure 6-9, I used a comma. 

➟
125
 Chapter 6: Taking Word to the Next Level
(When a delimited text file uses commas, it’s called a 
Comma Separated Values, or CSV, file.)
Commas represent the column breaks
Figure 6-9
 
➟ Outlook: If the data source is an Outlook Contacts 
list, each type of information is in a separate field. 
Outlook Contacts are covered in Chapter 12.
 
➟ Word list: If you don’t have a data source already, 
you can use the Type New List feature in Word to 
create one. Choose Mailings➪Select Recipients➪
Type New List. See upcoming Figure 6-10.
 
 A data file shouldn’t contain anything except the data 
(and perhaps a single row of field labels, as in Figure 
6-9 with Name, Address1, and Address2). There 
shouldn’t be any blank rows or titles at the top of the 
page because that confuses the Mail Merge utility. 
Check your data file to remove extraneous rows 
before using the file as your mail merge source.
After preparing the data file, you set up the main document. You can 
either create the main document from scratch, or you can start with an 
existing document and convert it to be a mail merge main document.
 
 Of the different kinds of main documents you can 
have, letters, envelopes, and labels are the most com-
mon. In this chapter, I show you how to do a letter.

➟
126
Part II: Word 
Follow these steps to set up your main document:
 
1. Start a new document, or open an existing one that you 
want to use.
 
2. Choose Mailings➪Start Mail Merge➪Letters.
Next, attach the data source file to the main document.
 
1. Choose Mailings➪Select Recipients.
 
2. Choose the type of data source:
 
• Type New List: This command opens the New Address 
List dialog box. Use this dialog box (see Figure 6-10) 
to create new address book entries. (Click the New 
Entry button after each one.) When you’re finished, 
click OK. Then in the Save Address List dialog box 
that opens, assign a name to the new address list. You 
can reuse it for other mail merges.
 
• Use Existing List: This command opens the Select Data 
Source dialog box. Use this dialog box to select the 
Excel, Word, Notepad, or other file where you saved 
your data source. Then click Open to confirm your 
selection. If you choose a data source file that has 
multiple sheets or tables, a dialog box might prompt 
you to pick which one you want.
 
• Select from Outlook Contacts: This command opens the 
Select Contacts dialog box. Click the contact folder you 
want to use (there might be only one listed) and then 
click OK. Then in the Mail Merge Recipients dialog box 
that opens (see Figure 6-11), clear the check box for

Insert the Date and Time
You can just type the current date and time into a document, such as 
when you are writing a letter, so you don’t need a special feature for 
that. However, Word can insert the current date and/or time in your 
choice of many standard formats so that you don’t have to worry 
about whether you’ve got the punctuation in the right place.

➟
130
Part II: Word 
The best part is that you have the option of making the date/time 
a field code, which is a fancy way of saying that the document 
knows to update the date/time information. So, for example, say 
you start a letter one day and don’t finish it until a week later. 
If you make the date/time a field code, the date on the letter will 
reflect the date when you save or print it, without you having 
to manually change it. This is a handy feature when you always 
want the document to display today’s date, no matter what day 
you open it.
To insert a static (doesn’t change) date or time, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Insert➪Date & Time.
 
2. In the Date and Time dialog box that opens, (see Figure 
6-13), choose the format you want. The actual date or 
time will come from the system clock (the date/time 
clock in Windows).
To insert a date or time that updates automatically, follow these steps:
 
1. Do Steps 1 and 2 in the preceding step list.
 
2. In the Date and Time dialog box that opens (see Figure 
6-13), select the Update Automatically check box. 
 
3. Click OK to complete the insertion.
If you choose to insert the date/time as a code, it updates automati-
cally whenever you save or print the file. If you want to update it any 
time other than that, click the date/time so that a pop-up appears with 
an Update button in it. Click the Update button to update the code. 
You can also press F9, which updates all field codes in the document.

Creating Basic 
Spreadsheets 
in Excel
M
icrosoft Word works great for typing text, 
but sometimes you want something a lit-
tle more structured for data. When you have 
more complex needs for column-based orga-
nizing than what Word’s tables can provide, 
Excel is a great step up to the next level. Excel 
is much more than just a column organizer, 
though; it enables you to write formulas that 
perform calculations on your data. This makes 
Excel an ideal tool for storing financial infor-
mation, such as a checkbook register and 
investment portfolio data.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the Excel inter-
face and show you some of the concepts you 
need to know to work with a spreadsheet. Some 
of projects that Excel works great for include
 ➟ Tracking a stock portfolio
 ➟ Recording checkbook transactions
 ➟ Storing an address book list
 ➟ Charting progress toward a goal
Using the skills this chapter covers, you can 
build all these types of spreadsheets and more.

Understand Excel’s Unique Features
Excel shares many elements with the Microsoft Office interface. Figure 
7-1 and the following list, however, show you the features that are 
unique to the Excel program. (If you need a refresher on the Microsoft 
Office interface in general, including features such as the Ribbon, 
Quick Access toolbar, and Office button, take a few minutes to review 
Chapter 1.)
Formula bar
Column letters
Name box
Cell cursor
Worksheet tabs
Row numbers
Cells
Figure 7-1
As you examine Figure 7-1, you’ll see
 
➟ Row numbers: Each row has a unique number. To 
select an entire row, click its number.

➟
137
 Chapter 7: Creating Basic Spreadsheets in Excel
 
➟ Column letters: Each column has a unique letter. To 
select an entire column, select its letter.
 
➟ Cells: At the intersection of each row and column is 
a cell. You enter content into a cell by clicking the 
cell and then typing.
 
➟ Active cell indicator: This thick outline indicates 
which cell is the active cell — where your cursor is 
located at the moment. Whatever you type next 
appears in the active cell, and whatever commands 
you issue apply to that cell.
 
➟ Name box: The active cell’s name appears here. For 
example, if the selected cell is at the intersection of 
column A and row 1, A1 appears in the Name box.
 
➟ Formula bar: The contents of the selected cell 
appears here. If the content is text, that text shows 
here as in the cell itself. If the content is a formula, 
the formula appears here, and the result of the for-
mula appears in the cell. For example, if the cell con-
tains the formula =2+1, the formula bar shows =2+1 
and the cell itself shows 3.
 
 A formula is a math expression, beginning with an 
equals sign, such as =2+1. Formulas can also contain 
cell references. For example, =A2+B2 adds the amount 
found in cell A2 to the amount found in B2.
 
➟ Worksheet tabs: By default, each workbook file has 
three sheets. They’re like pages in a notebook. Each 
sheet is shown as a tab; click a tab to switch to that 
sheet.
 
 Sheets are also called worksheets. A workbook is the 
entire data file, containing one or more worksheets.

➟
138
Part III: Excel 
Get Familiar with Spreadsheet Structure
Each cell has a unique cell address consisting of its column letter and 
row number. In Figure 7-1, for example, the active cell is at the inter-
section of column A and row 1. So, its cell address is A1. See the 
Name box in Figure 7-1. Each cell must have its own unique address 
so that you can refer to it when you create a formula. For example, 
suppose you want to sum (add) the values in cells B3 and B4. You can 
write a formula like this: =B3+B4.
 
 When you copy a formula that refers to cells by their 
addresses, the references to those cells automatically 
adjust to take into account the new position. For 
example, suppose you have the formula =A1+1 in 
cell A2. If you copy that formula into cell B2, the 
copy of the formula reads =B1+1.
A range is a group of one or more cells. You refer to a range by the 
address of the upper leftmost cell in the range, followed by a colon, and 
then followed by the lower rightmost cell in the range. For example, the 
range consisting of cells A1, A2, B1, and B2 is written as A1:B2.
 
 Technically, a single cell can be a range, but usually it 
isn’t called a range.
 Move the Cell Cursor
As I show you in Figure 7-1, the active cell indicator is the dark outline 
around the active cell. To change which cell is active, you can do either 
of the following:
 
➟ With your mouse: Click the cell you want to be 
active.
 
➟ From the keyboard: Press one of the arrow keys on 
the keyboard to move the active cell indicator one 
cell at a time in the direction the arrow is pointing 
until you reach the cell you want to be active.

➟

range A1:F1 bold, select that range and then issue the command for 

➟

Part III: Excel 
applying Bold (by clicking the B button on the Home tab or by press-
ing Ctrl+B). You can select a range by using either the keyboard or the 
mouse.
To select a range by using the mouse, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the upper leftmost cell in the range.
 
2. Click and hold down the left mouse button and drag to 
the lower rightmost cell in the range.
To select a range by using the keyboard, follow these steps:
 
1. Use the arrow keys to move the cell cursor to the upper 
leftmost cell in the range.
 
2. Press and hold down the Shift key while you press the → 
or ↓ keys to extend the selection until all the cells in the 
range are selected.
 
3. Release the Shift key.
 
 You can also select a range in reverse order: that is, 
starting with the lower rightmost cell and dragging 
upward and to the left or pressing the ← or ↑ keys.
You can also use a hybrid method involving both keyboard and 
mouse:
 
1. Select the first cell in the range using any method: either 
clicking it with the mouse or using the arrow keys to 
move the cell selector to it.
 
2. Hold down the Shift key and click the last cell in the 
range.
 
3. Release the Shift key.
Table 7-2 provides some shortcut keys to help you select ranges.

Although less common, you can also select a noncontiguous range (cells 
that don’t border each other). For example, suppose you want to apply 
a certain type of formatting to cells A1, A5, and A9. Select those three 
cells before issuing your formatting command, so that the formatting 
is applied to the three discrete cells at once:
 
1. Select the first cell in the range.
 
2. Hold down the Ctrl key and click more individual cells 
to be in the range. Or, click and drag across more multi-
cell blocks to be in the range. The additional selected 
cells appear highlighted with a very pale gray.
 
3. Release the Ctrl key.
An entire row or column can also be a range. Here’s how to select a row 
or column (for example, to delete it, or to format it a certain way):
 
➟ To select an entire row: Click its row number to the 
left of the row.

➟
142
Part III: Excel 
 
➟ To select an entire column: Click its column letter 
at the top of the column.
 
➟ To select multiple contiguous rows or columns: 
Select the first row/column and then click and hold 
down the left mouse button while you drag to 
include more rows or columns.
 
➟ To select multiple noncontiguous rows or col-
umns: Select the first row/column and then hold 
down Ctrl while you click more individual row num-
bers or column letters. A pale highlight is applied to 
each row or column you select.
Sometimes, you might want to apply a particular command to every 
cell on the entire worksheet. For example, you might want all the text 
in the entire worksheet to be a certain color or font. To select all cells 
at once, you can drag to create a range that encompasses the entire 
sheet; but that’s somewhat cumbersome. Here are a couple of easier 
alternatives:
 
➟ Click the Select All button, which you can find in the 
upper-left corner of the sheet at the intersection of the 
row numbers and column letters (see Figure 7-2).
 
➟ Press Ctrl+A.
Select All
Figure 7-2

➟

 Chapter 7: Creating Basic Spreadsheets in Excel
Type and Edit Cell Contents
To this point in the chapter, I’ve introduced you to some spreadsheet 
basics. Now, it’s time to actually do something: enter some text and 
numbers into cells.
To type in a cell, you simply select the cell and begin typing. Whatever 
you type appears both in the cell and in the formula bar. (Refer to 
Figure 7-1 to see where the formula bar is located.) When you finish 
typing, you can leave the cell in any of these ways:
 
➟ Press Enter (moves you to the next cell down).
 
➟ Press Tab (moves you to the next cell to the right).
 
➟ Press Shift+Tab (moves you to the next cell to the 
left).
 
➟ Press an arrow key (moves you in the direction of 
the arrow).
If you need to edit what’s in the cell, you have these choices:
 
➟ Click the cell to select it, and then click the cell again 
to move the insertion point into it. Edit like you 
would in Word or any text program.
 
➟ Click the cell to select it, and then type a new entry 
to replace the old one.
If you make a mistake when editing, you can press Esc (top left of 
your keyboard) to cancel the edit before you leave the cell. If you need 
to undo an edit after having left the cell, press Ctrl+Z or click the 
Undo button on the Quick Access toolbar.
Now try typing some text into your spreadsheet. I entered the text 
shown in Figure 7-3 to create a simple mortgage calculator. Feel free to 
enter your own information or type the same text I entered.

➟
144
Part III: Excel 
Figure 7-3
If you decide you don’t want the text you typed in a particular cell, 
you can get rid of it in several different ways:
 
➟ Select the cell; then right-click the cell and choose 
Clear Contents from the menu that appears.
 
➟ Select the cell; then choose Home➪Editing➪Clear➪
Clear Contents.
 
➟ Select the cell, press the spacebar, and then press 
Enter. This technically doesn’t clear the cell’s content, 
but it replaces it with a single, invisible character — 
a space.
 
 Don’t confuse Clear with Delete. They are two separate 
things. There is a Delete command on the Home tab 
(Home➪Cells➪Delete), but using this doesn’t clear the 
cell content; instead, it removes the entire cell. You find 
out more about deleting cells in the upcoming section, 
“Inserting and Deleting Individual Cells.”
And while I’m on the subject, don’t confuse Clear with Cut, either. The 
Cut command works in conjunction with the Clipboard. It moves the 

➟
145
 Chapter 7: Creating Basic Spreadsheets in Excel
content to the Clipboard, from which you can then paste it some-
where else. In Excel, though (unlike in other applications), using the 
Cut command doesn’t immediately remove the content. Instead, it 
puts a flashing dotted box around the content and waits for you to 
reposition the cell cursor and issue the Paste command. If you do 
something else in the interim, the cut-and-paste operation is cancelled, 
and the content that you cut remains in its original location.
 
 You can also clear only the formatting from a cell by 
choosing Home➪Editing➪Clear➪Clear Formatting. 
To clear both the content and the formatting, choose 
Home➪Editing➪Clear➪Clear All.
Try clearing some content from the text you entered in your spread-
sheet. Select a cell and use any of the three methods from the preced-
ing bullet list to remove the contents of the cell. From the text I typed 
earlier, I chose to clear the text from cell A14.
Save Your Work
After you type some text in a worksheet, save your work! Don’t wait 
until you type a lot of text. Always save early in the process in case 
something bad happens — like a power outage — that causes your 
computer to shut down unexpectedly.
To save your work, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Office➪Save As.
 
 If this is the first time saving this particular file, 
Office➪Save is the same as Save As. During subse-
quent saves, Save keeps your changes with the same 
name, type, and location, whereas Save As reopens 
the dialog box.
 
2. In the Save As dialog box that opens, type a name for the 
file in the File Name text box.

➟
146
Part III: Excel 
 
3. Choose the Excel Worksheet (*.xlsx) format from the 
Save as Type drop-down list.
 
4. (Optional) To change the save location, navigate to a dif-
ferent folder and/or drive.
 
5. Click Save.
 
 Excel 2007’s native file format uses a four-letter 
.xlsx extension. This is different from earlier Excel 
versions, which use a three-letter .xls extension.
 
 If you save an Excel 2007 document as-is, you cannot 
open it (nor can anyone else) in any version of Excel 
prior to Excel 2007 (say, Excel 2003). This is a big 
deal. Unless you’re sure that the document will be 
used only by people who have Excel 2007, consider 
“down-saving” the document to an earlier version so 
that folks not using Office 2007 can open it.
To share an Excel 2007 file with people who use an older version, you 
can down-save your file: that is, in the earlier-version format. Think of 
this as being “backward compatible.”
To down-save your work, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Office➪Save As➪Excel 97-2003 Workbook.
 
2. (Optional) To change the save location, navigate to a dif-
ferent folder and/or drive.
 
3. Click Save.
Insert and Delete Rows, Columns, and Cells
Even if you’re a careful planner, you’ll likely decide that you want to 
change your spreadsheet’s layout. Maybe you want data in a different 

➟
147
 Chapter 7: Creating Basic Spreadsheets in Excel
column, or certain rows turn out to be unnecessary. Excel makes it 
easy to insert and delete rows and columns to deal with these kinds 
of changes.
 
 Instead of inserting rows and columns, you can move 
the content between rows or columns. In Chapter 8, 
read how to move content in a worksheet.
To insert a row or column, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the row above or the column to the right of where 
the insertion should occur. Or, click in any cell in that 
row or column.
 
2. Choose Home➪Insert to open the drop-down list for the 
Insert button. See Figure 7-4.
 
3. From the menu, choose Insert Sheet Rows or Insert Sheet 
Columns.
Figure 7-4
Here’s another way to insert: from the right-click (contextual) menu:
 
1. Select a row or column adjacent to where the insertion 
should occur.
 
2. Right-click the selection and choose Insert from the 
menu that appears. Excel inserts either a row or a col-
umn, whichever you select in Step 1.

➟
148
Part III: Excel 
 
 To insert multiple rows or columns at once, select a 
corresponding number of contiguous rows or col-
umns in Step 1 in the preceding step list. For exam-
ple, if you select three columns, you get three new 
blank columns when you choose Insert.
Deleting a row or column works in a similar way:
 
1. Select the row(s) or column(s) you want to delete.
 
2. Choose Home➪Cells➪Delete.
 
 The Delete button has a drop-down list, just like the 
Insert button does. From it, you can choose what you 
wanted to delete: cells, rows, or columns. However, 
in Step 1, you select what you want to delete, so that 
isn’t necessary in this case; you could simply click the 
button to delete what was selected.
Try your hand at deleting a row from your spreadsheet. Earlier, I 
cleared the contents from cell A14. Now, I’m deleting rows 13 and 14. 
You can see how this looks in Figure 7-5.
Figure 7-5

➟
149
 Chapter 7: Creating Basic Spreadsheets in Excel
You can also delete individual cells from a worksheet.
 
 Deleting a cell is different from clearing a cell’s con-
tent! When you clear only the content, the cell itself 
remains. When you delete the cell itself, the cells to the 
right or below shift to the left or up to fill in the gap.
Here’s a way to envision what deletion does. Imagine that each cell is a 
cardboard box, stacked one on top of another in a grid. Each box opens 
to the front, so you can put things in it and take things out of it. When 
you delete a cell, you pull the box out of the stack. Gravity dictates that 
the boxes on top of the space fall down to fill it in. However, in Excel, 
gravity is backward: The cells fall up (or to the right if you specify that).
 
 Excel is smart enough that it tries to guess which 
direction you want existing content to move when 
you delete cells. If you have content immediately to 
the right of a deleted cell, for example, it shifts it left. 
If you have content immediately below the deleted 
cell, it shifts it up. You can still override that, though, 
when needed.
To delete individual cells, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell(s) to delete.
 
2. Choose Home➪Cells➪Delete. Excel attempts to guess 
how you want the adjacent cells shifted, and then per-
forms that operation.
If Excel didn’t shift the other cells in the direction you expected, try 
again using this slightly longer, but more controllable, alternative 
procedure.
 
1. Select the cell(s) to delete.
 
2. Choose Home➪Cells and then click the arrow on the 
Delete button to open its menu.

➟

3. Click Delete Cells. A Delete dialog box opens, as shown 
in Figure 7-6.
 
4. Select the radio button for the shift you want: Shift Cells 
Left or Shift Cells Up.
 
5. Click OK.
Figure 7-6
Inserting individual cells works in much the same way. You can 
choose from an easy method that guesses how you want the shift of 
adjacent content to occur, or a more controllable method where you 
get to specify how.
Here’s the easy method for cell insertion:
 
1. Select the cell(s) above or to the left of where you want 
them to appear.
 
2. Choose Home➪Cells➪Insert. Excel attempts to guess 
how you want the adjacent content shifted and performs 
that action.
This method gives you direct control:
 
1. Select the cell(s) above or to the left of where you want 
them to appear.
 
2. Choose Home➪Cells and click the arrow on the Insert 
button to open its menu.
 
3. Click Insert Cells. An Insert dialog box appears.

Work with Worksheets
Each workbook contains three sheets by default: Sheet1, Sheet2, and 
Sheet3. Most people don’t even notice at first that there are three 
sheets; they’re focused solely on the spreadsheet that’s in front of 
them. The extra sheets can come in every handy, though, for alterna-
tive versions of the same spreadsheet or for storing different spread-
sheets in the same data file. For example, you could have separate 
sheets for your holdings at each investment firm, or separate sheets for 
the membership rosters of several different clubs.

➟
152
Part III: Excel 
To switch from one sheet to another, click the sheet’s tab at the bot-
tom of the Excel window.
With a normal Excel window size and the default three tabs, with their 
default names, you should have no trouble seeing all three tabs at 
once. However, if you add a lot more sheets to the workbook (covered 
shortly) or rename the tabs so that some of them have very long 
names (also covered shortly), and/or if you resize your Excel window 
so it’s fairly narrow, not all the tabs may be visible at once. When this 
happens, you can use the tab scroll arrows to the left of the tabs to 
scroll the tabs to the left and right. See Figure 7-8.

To create a new sheet, click the Insert Worksheet button shown in

default settings (formatting, column width, and so on).
To delete a sheet, right-click its tab and choose Delete from the right-
click menu that appears. If that sheet has no data, it’s deleted immedi-
ately. If the sheet does contain data, you’re prompted to confirm the 
deletion.
 
 Make sure you really want to delete a sheet because 
this is an action you cannot undo with the Undo 
(Ctrl+Z) command.

➟
153
 Chapter 7: Creating Basic Spreadsheets in Excel
 
 You don’t have to delete unused sheets in a work-
book, but it also doesn’t hurt anything to do so. You 
can always add new sheets later if you decide you 
need more sheets. Just click the Insert Worksheet 
button.
Give it a whirl. In your spreadsheet, delete all the unused sheets 
(Sheet2 and Sheet3). You should be left with only Sheet1, the sheet 
holding the text you’ve entered so far.
The default names for the sheets aren’t particularly helpful in terms of 
describing what they contain. In a workbook that uses multiple sheets, 
you will probably want to rename each sheet’s tab so that it’s mean-
ingful to you.
To rename a sheet, follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click the sheet’s tab. The current name is selected.
 
2. Type a new name.
 
3. Press Enter.
If you want, rename the Sheet1 tab in your spreadsheet to something 
that’s easy to remember. I renamed Sheet1 in my Mortgage spread-
sheet to Mortgage.
 
 You can use up to 255 characters for a sheet name, 
including most punctuation, but think twice before 
you use long, fancy names. When creating references 
to cells on a sheet, you must include the sheet’s 
name in the formula, and long names can be cum-
bersome to type. In addition, names that include 
spaces and punctuation can sometimes require spe-
cial handling to avoid tripping up certain Excel fea-
tures. Best bet: Stick with single-word sheet names 
with no punctuation.

Here’s a formatting trick to keep your work organized. Each worksheet 
tab can have a different color, or you can color several tabs all the 
same to indicate that they’re somehow related. The coloring is all up 
to you!
To assign a color to a sheet tab, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the tab and hover your mouse over Tab Color 
on the contextual menu.
 
2. In the Theme Colors palette that appears, click the 
desired color (see Figure 7-9).
Figure 7-9
 
 When a colored tab is active (that is, when that par-
ticular sheet is displayed), the color appears slightly 
washed out in a soft gradient. But when you select a 
different tab, the inactive tab(s) appear in their full 
colorful glory. To remove the color, repeat the pre-
ceding steps and click No Color in Step 2.

Doing the Math: 
Formulas and 
Functions
T
he main reason why people choose Excel is 
that it “excels” at storing and calculating 
numeric data. With Excel, you can create a grid 
of numbers, then insert formulas that perform 
math calculations on them. That capability 
makes it possible to build complex worksheets 
that calculate loan rates and payments, keep 
track of your bank accounts, and much more.
In this chapter, I show you how to build formu-
las and functions in Excel, and how to put them 
to work to do several types of calculation-based 
jobs.
Learn How Formulas 
Are Structured
A formula is a math calculation, like 2 + 2 or 
3(4 + 1). In Excel, formulas are different from 
regular text in two ways:
 ➟ They begin with an equal sign, like 
this: =2+2

➟ They don’t contain text (except for function names, 
covered later, and cell references). They contain only 
symbols that are allowed in math formulas, such as 
parentheses, commas, and decimal points.
Just like in basic math, formulas are calculated by using an order of 
precedence. Table 8-1 lists the order.

Write Formulas That Reference Cells
One of Excel’s best features is its ability to reference cells in formulas. 
When a cell is referenced in a formula, whatever value it contains is 
used in the formula. When the value changes, the result of the formula 
changes, too.
For example, suppose you enter 7 in cell A1 and 8 in cell A2. Then in 
cell A3, you put the following formula:
=A1+A2
The result of that formula appears in cell A3 as 15. See Figure 8-1. You 
could have just as easily entered =7+8 in cell A3 and gotten the same 
result. However, because you reference the cells — rather than the fixed 
values — you can modify the result by changing what either A1 or A2 
contains. For example, if you change the value in A1 to 4, the result in 
A3 changes to 12.

➟
157
 Chapter 8: Doing the Math: Formulas and Functions
The cell itself shows the result, not the formula
Formula in the active cell
Figure 8-1
 
 You can use a formula to repeat a value between one 
cell and another. For example, the formula =A1 
repeats whatever value is in cell A1 wherever you 
put it.
You can combine cell references with fixed numbers in cells, too. Here 
are some examples:
=A1+2
=(A1*A2)/4
=(A1+A2+B1+B2)/4
Move and Copy Cell Content
When you’re creating a spreadsheet, it’s common to not get everything 
in exactly the right cells to begin with. Fortunately, moving content 
between cells is easy.
Here are the two methods you can use to move content. Remember to 
first select the cell(s).
 
➟ Clipboard: Choose Home➪Cut or press Ctrl+X. 
Then click the destination cell and choose Home➪

➟
158
Part III: Excel 
Paste or press Ctrl+V. If you want to copy rather than 
move, choose Copy (Ctrl+C) rather than Cut.
 
 If you’re moving or copying a multicell range with 
the Clipboard method, you can either select the same 
size and shape of block for the destination. Or, you 
can select a single cell, and the paste will occur with 
the selected cell in the upper-left corner.
 
➟ Mouse: Point at the dark outline around the selected 
range, and then drag to the new location. If you 
want to copy rather than move, hold down the Ctrl 
key while you drag. See Figure 8-2.
Drag to desired location
Plus sign appears (for Copy) 
when Ctrl key is held down
Position mouse pointer on selection border
Figure 8-2
When you move or copy a formula, Excel automatically changes the 
cell references to work with the new location. For example, suppose 

➟
159
 Chapter 8: Doing the Math: Formulas and Functions
you copy the formula in cell A3 (from Figure 8-1) into cell C3. The 
original formula was =A1+A2. When it arrives at C3, it changes to 
=C1+C2. This happens by design, as a convenience to you, because 
often when you copy formulas, you want them to work relative to 
their new locations. This is called a relative reference.
Sometimes, you might not want the cell references in a formula to 
change when you move or copy it. In other words, you want it to be 
an absolute reference to that cell. To make a reference absolute, you add 
dollar signs before the column letter and before the row number. So, 
for example, an absolute reference to C1 would be =$C$1.
You can mix relative and absolute references in the same formula. For 
example, in Figure 8-3, if I copy the formula from D4 to D5, the ver-
sion in D5 will appear like this:
=C5*(1+$B$1)
The C4 reference changed to C5 because it didn’t have any dollar signs 
around it, but the B1 reference stayed the same because it did have the 
dollar signs.
Figure 8-3

➟
160
Part III: Excel 
Reference a Cell on Another Sheet
In a multisheet workbook, you might want to refer to a cell on a dif-
ferent sheet. To do this, you put the sheet name and an exclamation 
point in front of the cell reference. For example, to refer to cell A1 on 
Sheet2, you would write it like this:
=Sheet2!A1
 
 The default sheet names (Sheet1, Sheet2, and Sheet3) 
have no spaces in the names. If you rename a sheet 
with a name that includes spaces, you have to put the 
sheet name in single quotation marks, like this:
=’Home Budget’!A1
Understand Functions
Sometimes, it’s awkward or lengthy to write a formula to perform a 
calculation. For example, suppose you want to sum the values in cells 
A1 through A10. You would have to write out each cell reference indi-
vidually, like this:
=A1+A2+A3+A4+A5+A6+A7+A8+A9+A10
In Excel, a function refers to a certain math calculation. Functions can 
greatly shortcut the amount of typing you have to do to create a partic-
ular result. For example, instead of the using preceding formula, you 
could sum, using the SUM function like this:
=SUM(A1:A10)
With a function, you can represent a range with the upper-left corner’s 
cell reference, a colon, and the lower-right corner’s cell reference. In 
the case of A1:A10, there is only one column, so the upper left is A1 
and the lower right is A10.

➟
161
 Chapter 8: Doing the Math: Formulas and Functions
Each function has one or more arguments. An argument is a place-
holder for a number, text string, or cell reference. For example, the 
SUM function requires at least one argument: a range of cells. So in 
the preceding example, A1:A10 is the argument. The arguments for a 
function are enclosed in a set of parentheses.
Each function has its own rules as to how many required and optional 
arguments it has, and what they represent. You don’t have to memo-
rize the sequence of arguments (the syntax) for each function; Excel 
asks you for them. It can even suggest a function to use for a certain 
situation if you aren’t sure what you need.
To find a function and get help with its syntax, follow these steps:
 
1. Click in the cell where you want to insert the function.
 
2. Choose Formulas➪Insert Function. The Insert Function 
dialog box opens.
 
 If you don’t know what function you want, type a 
few keywords (in the Search for a Function field) that 
represent what you want to do. For example, if you 
want to find the minimum value in a range of cells, 
you might type Find the minimum value. Then click 
Go to see a list of functions that might be what you 
want. See Figure 8-4. Click each function on the list 
and read the description of it that appears.
 
3. When you find the function you want, click OK.
 
4. In the Function Arguments dialog box that opens, fill in 
the arguments in the field provided. The arguments will 
be different depending on the function you choose. 
Figure 8-5 shows the arguments for the MIN function, for 
example.

 Here are some ways to fill in the arguments:
 
• Type a number or a cell reference (or range) directly into the box.

➟
163
 Chapter 8: Doing the Math: Formulas and Functions
 
 Even though the argument is named Number1 in 
Figure 8-5, you can still enter a range for it. The 
Number2 argument is optional; you can tell 
because its name is not bold. This particular func-
tion can have an unlimited number of optional 
arguments; more boxes appear automatically as 
needed.
 
• Click the Selector button to the right of the text box. This 
collapses the dialog box temporarily. Select the cell or 
range in the worksheet, and then press Enter to return 
to the dialog box.
 
5. Click OK.
After you get comfortable with a particular function, you might prefer 
to type it directly into the cell rather than going through the Insert 
Function dialog box. As you type, Excel helps you by providing 
prompts for the arguments in a ScreenTip. See Figure 8-6.

Take a Tour of Some Basic Functions
Excel has hundreds of functions, but most of them are very special-
ized. The basic set that the average user works with is much more 
manageable.
Start with the simplest functions of them all: those with no arguments. 
Two prime examples are
 
➟ NOW: Reports the current date and time
 
➟ TODAY: Reports the current date

➟
164
Part III: Excel 
Even though neither uses any arguments, you still have to include the 
parentheses, so they look like this:
=NOW( )
=TODAY( )
Another basic kind of function performs a single, simple math opera-
tion and has a single argument that specifies what cell or range it oper-
ates on. Table 8-2 summarizes some important functions that work 
this way.
Table 8-2 
Simple One-Argument Functions

Example
SUM
Sums the values in a range of 
cells
=SUM(A1:A10)
AVERAGE

=AVERAGE(A1:A10)
MIN
Provides the smallest number in 
a range of cells
=MIN(A1:A10)
MAX
Provides the largest number in 
a range of cells
=MAX(A1:A10)
COUNT
Counts the number of cells in 
the range that contain numeric 
values
=COUNT(A1:A10)
COUNTA
Counts the number of empty 
cells in the range
=COUNTA(A1:A10)
COUNTBLANK
Counts the number of non-
empty cells in the range
=COUNTBLANK(A1:A10)
Table 8-3 shows some functions that change how numbers are 
presented.

What It Does
Example
ABS
Presents the absolute value of the number
=ABS(B1)
ROUND
Rounds the number up or down by a specified 
number of decimal points
=ROUND(B1,0)
EVEN
Round a positive number up, or a negative 
number down, to the next even whole number
=EVEN(B1)
ODD
Round a positive number up, or a negative 
number down, to the next odd whole number
=ODD(B1)
Here are some things to note about the items in the preceding table:
 
➟ Absolute value: This is the positive version of a 
number. For example, the absolute value of –15 is 
15. If the number is already positive, it stays positive.
 
➟ Multiple arguments: See the entry for ROUND. 
There are two arguments: the cell address or number 
to operate on, and the number of decimal places. A 
value of 0 for the decimal places results in rounding 
to the nearest integer.
 
 When a function has more than one argument, the 
arguments are separated by commas. You can see this 
in the ROUND example: ROUND(B1,0).
 
 Two other functions, ROUNDUP and ROUNDDOWN, 
work just like ROUND except they specify which way 
the rounding will always occur.
Explore Financial Functions
Financial functions are some of the most useful tools for home and 
small business worksheets because they’re all about the money: bor-
rowing it, lending it, and monitoring it. Here’s the basic set.

➟
166
Part III: Excel 
 
➟ PV: Calculates the present value or principal amount. 
In a loan, it’s the amount you’re borrowing; in a sav-
ings account, it’s the initial deposit.
 
➟ FV: The future value. This is the principal plus the 
interest paid or received.
 
➟ PMT: The payment to be made per period. For exam-
ple, for a mortgage, it’s the monthly payment; in a 
savings account, it’s the amount you save each 
period. A period can be any time period, but it’s usu-
ally a month.
 
➟ RATE: The interest rate to be charged per period (for 
a loan), or the percentage of amortization or depreci-
ation per period.
 
➟ NPER: The number of periods. For a loan, it’s the 
total number of payments to be made, or the points 
in time when interest is earned if you’re tracking sav-
ings or amortization.
These financial functions are related. Each is an argument in the oth-
ers; if you’re missing one piece of information, you can use all the 
pieces you do know to find the missing one. For example, if you know 
the loan amount, the rate, and the number of years, you can deter-
mine the payment.
Take a look at the PMT function as an example. The syntax for the 
PMT function is as follows, with the optional parts in italics:
PMT(RATE, NPER, PV, FV, Type)
 
 The Type argument specifies when the payment is 
made: 1 for the beginning of the period or 0 at the 
end of the period. It’s not required. (I don’t use it in 
the examples here.)

➟
167
 Chapter 8: Doing the Math: Formulas and Functions
So, for example, say the rate is 0.833% per month (that’s 10% per 
year), for 60 months, and the amount borrowed is $25,000. The Excel 
formula looks like this:
=PMT(.00833,60,25000)
Enter that into a worksheet cell, and you’ll find that the monthly pay-
ment will be $531.13. You could also enter those values into cells, and 
then refer to the cells in the function arguments, like this (assuming 
you entered them into B1, B2, and B3):
=PMT(B1,B2,B3)
Here is the syntax for each of the above-listed functions. As you can 
see, they’re all intertwined with one another:
FV(RATE, NPER, PMT, PV, Type)
PMT(RATE, NPER, PV, FV, Type)
RATE(NPER, PMT, PV, FV, Type)
NPER(RATE, PMT, PV, FV, Type)
Here are some common ways to use Excel functions in everyday life:
If I borrow $10,000 for 3 years at 7% yearly interest, what will my monthly 
payments be?
Use the PMT function. Divide the interest rate by 12 because the rate 
is yearly, but the payment is monthly. Here is the syntax:
=PMT(0.07/12,36,10000)
If I borrow $10,000 at 7% interest and I can afford to make payments of 
$300 per month, how many months will it take to pay off the loan?
Use the NPER function. Again, divide the interest rate by 12 to convert 
from yearly to monthly. Here’s the syntax:
=NPER(0.07/12,300,10000)
If I deposit $10,000 into a bank account that pays 2% interest per year, 
compounded weekly, how much money will I have after 5 years?

➟
168
Part III: Excel 
You want the future value of the account, or FV. The period is weekly, 
so the interest rate should be divided by 52, and the length of the loan 
is 260 periods (52 weeks multiplied by 5 years). The PMT amount is 0 
because no additional deposits will be made after the initial deposit. 
The initial deposit is expressed as a negative number because the cal-
culation is from the perspective of the interest earner, not the interest 
payer. Here is the syntax:
=FV(0.02/52,260,0,-10000)

Creating Visual 
Interest with 
Formatting 
and Charts
L
arge spreadsheets with many rows and col-
umns of numbers can be confusing or bor-
ing to look at. What do the numbers really 
mean? Which number goes with what descrip-
tive text?
You can make a spreadsheet less boring and 
more informative by applying formatting. You 
can change font and text size, apply background 
shading, add borders, and lots more. You can 
also adjust the row and column sizes to create 
space between columns or rows of text.
To help users interpret the data, you can also 
add charts that summarize the data and/or 
show trends in the data. Excel offers a wide 
variety of chart types, enabling you to custom-
ize virtually every aspect of a chart’s 
formatting.

Part III: Excel 
Adjust Row Height and Column Width
By default, each column is the same width. If you type text that 
exceeds the column width, one of two things happens:
 
➟ If the cell to the right is blank: The text overflows 
into it.
 
➟ If the cell to the right is not blank: The text appears 
cut off (truncated). The full text is still stored there, 
though.
Figure 9-1 illustrates each case.
Text overflows when adjacent cells are empty
Text is truncated when adjacent cells are not empty
Figure 9-1
To fix such a problem, you must widen the column. Here are some 
ways how:
 
➟ To widen the column exactly enough to hold the 
longest entry in it: Double-click the divider between 

➟
171
 Chapter 9: Creating Visual Interest with Formatting and Charts
the column headers, or choose Home➪Format➪
AutoFit Column Width.
 
➟ To widen the column manually: Drag the divider 
between the column headers. See Figure 9-2.
Drag or double-click here
Figure 9-2
 
 You can also make a column narrower; just drag to 
the left, rather than to the right.
This process also works with row heights. You can drag the divider 
between two row numbers to change the row height, or double-click 
the divider to autofit to the content.
Row heights adjust automatically to fit the tallest text in them, so you 
don’t have to worry about text being vertically truncated in rows — 
usually. If you manually adjust the height of a row and then put some 
larger text into it, the larger text might become truncated because the 
row height has been fixed. To make it autofit again, choose Home➪
Format➪AutoFit Row Height.
Wrap Text in a Cell
Sometimes, rather than making a row wider to make its content fit, 
you might want the content to wrap to multiple lines within the cell 
(like a paragraph in a Word document). To do this, select the cell and 
then choose Home➪Wrap Text. (See Figure 9-3.)

 Wrapping is handy for column headings and long

Apply Gridlines or Borders
When you look at your worksheet onscreen, you see faint, gray-blue 
lines — gridlines — that separate the rows and columns.
By default, gridlines appear onscreen but not in print. To control how 
gridlines appear, display the Page Layout tab and then mark or clear the 
View and/or Print check boxes in the Gridlines group. See Figure 9-4.
Control gridline display

➟
173
 Chapter 9: Creating Visual Interest with Formatting and Charts
You can also apply other lines around one or more sides of each cell: 
borders. These lines can be any color or thickness you want. Borders 
always display onscreen and always print, regardless of settings. 
Borders are useful for helping the reader’s eyes follow the text across 
the printed page, and for identifying which parts of a spreadsheet go 
together logically.
The easiest way to apply and format borders is to use the Borders but-
ton’s drop-down list on the Home tab. (It’s in the Font group, as 
shown in Figure 9-5.) Here’s how:
Figure 9-5
 
1. Select the range of cells to which you want to apply the 
border.
 
2. Choose Home➪Borders.

➟
174
Part III: Excel 
 
3. From the list of borders that appears, choose one that 
best represents the side(s) to which you want to apply 
the border.
 
 The border will apply to the outside edges of the 
range you select. So, for example, choosing Top 
Border applies a top border only to the cells in the 
top row of the range, not to the top of every cell in 
that range.
 
• To add a border on all sides of each cell in the range: 
Choose All Borders.
 
• To remove the border from all sides of all cells in the 
selected range: Choose No Border.
 
• To add borders on more than one side but not all sides: 
Repeat the process several times, each time choosing 
one individual side.
If you want to choose a specific color, style, or weight for the border, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Home➪Borders➪More Borders (the bottom 
command on the menu from Figure 9-5). The Format 
Cells dialog box appears with the Border tab displayed. 
See Figure 9-6.
 
2. In the Style area, click the desired line style.
 
3. In the Color area, open the drop-down list and click the 
desired color.
 
4. In the Presets area, click the preset for the sides you want 
to apply the border to: None, Outline, or Inside.
 
 If you want the border around each side of each cell, 
click both Outline and Inside.

 In the Border area, click the button(s) for individual 
sides, or click directly on the sample area in the desired 
spots, which applies the border to only certain sides.
 
 Step 4 is necessary. If you choose a border style and 
color but don’t apply it to any sides of the range, 
that’s like selecting nothing at all.

Apply Fill Color
Fill color — also called shading — is the color or pattern that fills the 
background of one or more cells.

➟
176
Part III: Excel 
 
 Shading can help the reader’s eyes follow informa-
tion across a page, and can add color and visual 
interest to a worksheet. In some types of spread-
sheets, such as a checkbook register, it’s common to 
shade every other line, for easier reading.
The fill color you choose can be any of the following (see Figure 9-7):
 
➟ A standard color: These colors don’t change if you 
apply a different theme to the workbook.
 
➟ A theme color, or a tint/shade of a theme color: 
These colors do change if you apply a different 
theme.
 
➟ No Fill: This removes all existing fill from the 
selected cells.
Figure 9-7
To apply fill color, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell(s) to be filled.

➟
177
 Chapter 9: Creating Visual Interest with Formatting and Charts
 
2. On the Home tab, click the down arrow to the right of 
the Fill Color button, opening its menu.
 
 Clicking the Fill Color button applies whatever color 
is selected (that is, the color that currently appears on 
the button’s face) without opening the menu.
 
3. Choose your color:
 
• Click one of the color swatches in the Theme Colors 
palette.
 
• Click one of the colors in the Standard Colors palette.
 
• Click More Colors to open a dialog box of additional stan-
dard colors. Choose one and then click OK.
 
 To change the workbook’s theme, choose Page 
Layout➪Themes. Changing themes changes the fonts 
and colors used. To change only the colors, choose 
Page Layout➪Colors.
Format Text in Cells
Text formatting within a cell works very much like it does in Word and 
PowerPoint. To change the font, font size, color, or attributes (such as 
bold or italic) for an Excel spreadsheet cell or range
 
1. Select the cell(s).
 
2. On the Home tab, use the buttons and drop-down lists 
in the Font group to apply text formatting. Figure 9-8 
points them out.
Text alignment controls how the text lines up within cells. Figure 9-9 
points out the controls on the Home tab for working with cell align-
ment, and also shows some examples. Cell alignment refers to how the 
text interacts with the available space in the cell.

button on the Home tab. For example, you could use vertical or 
slanted text so that labels in a heading row take up less space 
horizontally.
 
1. Select the cell(s).
 
2. Click the Orientation button.
 
3. Make a selection from its menu.
Figure 9-10 shows the menu but also some rotated text.

 Excel differentiates between angled and rotated text 
on the Orientation menu (Figure 9-10). Angled text 
is diagonal; rotated text is straight up-and-down.

Format the Spreadsheet as a Whole
The Page Layout tab contains various formatting controls that affect 
the entire worksheet. These controls affect the worksheet when it’s 
printed (see Figure 9-11):
Figure 9-11
 
➟ Margins: Here, you can set the page margins for 
printing your worksheet. Choose from among the 
presets or choose Custom Margins to set your own.
 
➟ Orientation: Choose from Portrait (tall) or 
Landscape (wide) for printing your worksheet.
 
➟ Size: Choose the paper size. The default is regular 
letter size (8.5" x 11").
 
➟ Print Area: Use this to set only a portion of the 
worksheet to print. This is a handy option if you 
don’t want everything on the sheet to print. For 
example, you have two tables of data on the same 
sheet, but you want to print only one.
 
➟ Background: Use this to place a picture behind the 
cells of the sheet, such as a logo. (This is uncommon 
because pictures tend to interfere with the readability 
of the data.)
 
➟ Print Titles: Click this button to open the Page Setup 
dialog box with the Sheet tab displayed. From there, 
you can select certain rows and columns to repeat on 
every page of a multipage printout (such as a row 
containing column headings, for example).

➟ Scale to Fit group: Options here enable you to force 
your printout to fit on a certain number of pages by 
automatically decreasing the size as needed. You can 
scale to a certain number of pages (with the Height 
and Width lists), or you can set an overall scale per-
centage. Refer to Figure 9-11.
Create a Basic Chart
When you have a lot of numeric data on a sheet, it can be difficult to 
discern its meaning. See Figure 9-12 to see what I mean. Even though 
this worksheet is attractively formatted, there are still a lot of numbers. 
Using a chart might help make more sense out of them.
Figure 9-12
Excel offers various chart types, each suited for a different type of data 
analysis. For example, Figure 9-13 shows two different charts created 
from portions of the data from Figure 9-12.

To create a chart, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the data to include on the chart. Include any cells 
that contain text labels that should be in the chart, too.
 
 You might need to select a range of cells that don’t 
touch each other (noncontiguous) for Step 1. If that’s 
the case, hold down the Ctrl key while you select the 
cells you want.
 
2. On the Insert tab, click a chart type (Charts group). A 
menu opens showing the chart subtypes. For example, 
Figure 9-14 shows the subtypes of column charts 
available.
 
3. Click the subtype you want. A new chart is created and 
placed on the current sheet as a floating object.
After you create the chart, you can
 
➟ Resize it. Drag one of the corners of its frame, or 
one of the selection handles on a side (represented 
by several dots).

the chart (for example, a single bar or point)
 
➟ Chart title: A text label that describes the entire chart
 
➟ Axis: A line on which data is plotted
 
 A column chart has both a vertical and a horizontal 
axis.
Format a Chart
Nearly every aspect of a chart can be formatted differently. You can 
change the color of every data series, for example, and change the font 
and size of each text item. You can adjust the rotation of a 3-D chart, 
move the legend to different positions, add or remove the chart title 
and various types of labels, and much more.
The easiest way to change the look of a chart is to apply a chart style 
to it. Chart styles are located on the Design tab. With the chart 
selected, open up the Chart Style gallery and select one of the style 
presets. See Figure 9-16.
 
 The chart style colors come from the color theme 
that you applied to the workbook. To choose a differ-
ent color theme, choose Page Layout➪Themes or 
Page Layout➪Colors.

➟
186
Part III: Excel 
Figure 9-16
The Layout tab provides controls for many of the individual elements 
of a chart, such as the Chart Title, Axis Titles, Legend, and so on. Click 
one of those buttons, as shown in Figure 9-17, and then make a selec-
tion as to how (or if) you want that element to appear.
 
 If the Layout tab isn’t available, make sure you have 
selected the chart.
Each element of the chart is also selectable for formatting. For exam-
ple, you can click the legend and then apply formatting to only that.
 
 Sometimes it’s difficult to select a tiny element of a 
chart so Excel offers some assistance. On the Format 
tab, the leftmost group is called Current Selection. 
It has a drop-down list from which you can select a 
chart element, as an alternative to clicking a chart 
element.

➟

After you select a chart element, use tools on the Format tab (Figure 
9-18) to apply formatting:

➟ Use any of the controls here to apply a color, border, 
special effect, or other formatting option to it. For 
example, a Shape Styles gallery provides shapes and 
formatting presets, and a WordArt Styles gallery pro-
vides presets for various types of text formatting.
 
➟ Choose Format➪Format Selection to open a dialog 
box for formatting that element. See Figure 9-19.
 
 Alternatively, you can right-click the selected element 
and choose the format command from the menu 
that appears. The exact name of the command varies; 
for example, when a data series is selected and right-
clicked, the command is Format Data Series.
When you open the Format dialog box for a particular element (select 
the element and then choose Format➪Format Selection), the choices

Using Excel as a 
Database
B
esides calculations, the other main reason 
people use Excel is to store tabular data. 
For example, Excel works great to store the 
names and addresses of the people you send 
holiday cards to every year, or to store a home 
inventory that you create for insurance 
purposes.
Although spreadsheet programs like Excel 
weren’t originally created for this purpose, soft-
ware designers quickly figured out that a lot of 
people were using Excel to hold lists of data, so 
they built in features to help do that more effec-
tively. In this chapter, you can read about sev-
eral Excel 2007 features — such as tables and 
filtering — for entering and manipulating data.
Understand Databases
A database is an organized collection of infor-
mation about a subject. Examples of databases 
include an address book, a telephone book, or 
a home inventory.
Database data is stored in tables, which are 
row-and-column grids. Although Excel isn’t a 
full database program, the row-and-column 
format of its worksheets is easily adaptable 
to a simple database.

Part III: Excel 
Each row is a record: a set of details about a specific item. For example, 
a record for a friend in your address book likely contains his name, 
mailing address, and phone number. A record about a possession in 
your home could include a name, description, acquisition date, and 
retail value. Each piece of information you store for each record is a 
field. Field names always appear in the first row of the table. See 
Figure 10-1.
Each column is a field
Field names occupy the first row
Each row is a record
Figure 10-1
Prepare a List for a Mail Merge
One reason why you might create a database in Excel is to store names 
and addresses for a mail merge — perhaps with a letter you created in 
Word, for example. (Read all about mail merges in Chapter 6.)
Excel is a great tool for creating such a list. There are just a couple of 
basic rules:
 
➟ The first row (row 1) must contain the field names.
 
➟ The data must start immediately beneath the field 
names (row 2).

➟
193
 Chapter 10: Using Excel as a Database
 
 When storing lists in Excel, some people like to put 
a descriptive title in row 1. That’s fine if you’re just 
going to be working in Excel, but it wreaks havoc with 
a mail merge, so you must delete any such rows in 
Excel before you use the Excel file for a merge. To 
delete a row, select it and then choose Home➪Delete.
Store Data in a Table
To create a database in Excel, type the field names in row 1, and then 
type the records in the subsequent rows. Nothing else is required. You 
can format the data any way you want it.
However, if you choose to turn a range of cells into a table (Excel’s 
term for a database listing), you get some special benefits, such as 
easy-to-apply automatic formatting and easier sorting and filtering. 
A table in Excel is entirely different from a table in Word. In Excel, a 
table is a range of cells defined as a database structure. In Word, a 
table is a simple row-and-column grid for holding text.
To convert a range of cells into a table and apply automatic formatting 
at the same time, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the range, including the field names in row 1.
 
2. Choose Home➪Format as Table. A palette of table styles 
appears. See Figure 10-2.
 
3. Click the desired style. The Format as Table dialog box 
appears.
 
4. Confirm the range that appears in the box, and then click 
OK. Excel applies the formatting, and also sets up the 
data range as a table.
 
 If you want just the formatting — and not the other fea-
tures that a table provides in Excel — choose Design➪
Convert to Range after performing these steps.

➟

Figure 10-2
Setting up a range as a table has many benefits, including
 
➟ Sorting and filtering: Click the down arrow that 
appears next to each field name to open a menu 
from which you can sort and filter the data easily. 
(This is covered in more detail later in this chapter.)
 
➟ Automatic table formatting: Additional records 
(rows) you add to the table after its initial creation 
will be automatically formatted in the same way.
 
➟ Other formatting options: You can apply different 
formatting at any time with the Design➪Table Styles 
command. (The Design tab is available only when 
working with a table.)
The drop-down arrow buttons that appear on each field name are for 
your convenience; you can click one to open a menu for that column 

➟
195
 Chapter 10: Using Excel as a Database
for sorting and filtering the data (described later in this chapter). If 
you don’t want to see the arrows, you can turn off their display by 
choosing Data➪Filter. (That’s an on/off toggle; choose that same com-
mand again to make the arrow buttons redisplay.)
If you ever want to revert to a regular range (as opposed to a table), 
you can easily convert the data back to normal cells. Click anywhere in 
the table and choose Design➪Convert to Range.
Sort a Table
Sorting rearranges the order of the records to meet criteria you specify. 
For example, you might sort an address list on the person’s last name 
or city.
If you convert the range to a table, as in the previous section, each col-
umn heading has a drop-down arrow button on it. Click that arrow to 
open a menu. From that menu, you can choose to Sort A to Z or Sort 
Z to A on that column. See Figure 10-3.
If you don’t want to use the drop-down menu on the column, you can 
instead click anywhere in the column and use buttons on the Ribbon:
 
➟ Home➪Sort & Filter➪Sort A to Z
 
➟ Home➪Sort & Filter➪Sort Z to A
 
➟ Data➪Sort A to Z
 
➟ Data➪Sort Z to A
The method I just showed you works great for single-field sorts. 
Sometimes, though, you might want a multifield sort:
 
➟ You sort the list by one field.
 
➟ If two or more records have the same value for that 
field, you choose a tie-breaker field to determine the 
order.

➟
196
Part III: Excel 
Sort ascending (A to Z) or descending (Z to A)

For example, you might sort by the Last Name field; and if two people 
have the same last name, you break the tie by sorting on the First 
Name field.
To do a multilevel sort, follow these steps:
 
1. Click anywhere inside the table.
 
2. Choose Data➪Sort, or Home➪Sort & Filter➪Custom 
Sort.
 
3. That the Sort dialog box opens, open the Sort By list and 
choose the field by which to sort first. For example, you 
might sort an address list by Last Name.
 
4. Leave the Sort On box set to Values.

➟
197
 Chapter 10: Using Excel as a Database
 
5. Leave the Order box set to A to Z, or change it to Z to A.
 
6. Click the Add Level button to add another set of controls. 
See Figure 10-4.
Add more sort levels
Arrow buttons rearrange the levels
Figure 10-4
 
7. Repeat Steps 3–5 to complete the second set of controls.
 
8. Add other levels if needed. When you’re finished, 
click OK.
 
 You can sort a regular range of cells (that is, not a 
table), but you have to select the entire range before 
performing the sort. It’s much easier if you convert 
the range to a table first, as I show you how to do 
earlier in this chapter.
Filter Data in a Table
Filtering data enables you to temporarily hide certain records so that 
the ones you do want to see become easier to find. Filtering is based 
on criteria that you specify. For example, you might want to see only 
items of a certain category or only people who live in a certain state.

➟
198
Part III: Excel 
The simplest way to filter is to choose which of the existing values for 
a particular column to include. Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the down-arrow button to the right of the column 
name to open its menu.
 
 If you don’t see down-arrow buttons on the column 
names, choose Data➪Filter to make them appear.
 
2. A list of all the entries in that column appears, with check 
boxes for each one. Mark or clear the check boxes as needed 
to choose which values to include. See Figure 10-5.
Figure 10-5
 
3. Click OK at the bottom of the menu. The list is filtered as 
you specified.

➟
199
 Chapter 10: Using Excel as a Database
If you want to turn off the filtering, you can do any of the following:
 
➟ Reopen the menu and mark the Select All check box.
 
➟ Choose Data➪Clear.
 
➟ Choose Data➪Filter to toggle off the filtering (and 
also the down-arrow buttons).
 
 Choose Data➪Filter again to turn the button display 
back on.
If your filtering needs are more complex than a simple inclusion or 
exclusion, use one of the filters from the Text Filters submenu. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the down-arrow button to the right of the column 
name to open its menu.
 
 If you don’t see down-arrow buttons on the column 
names, choose Data➪Filter to make them appear.
 
2. Depending on the field type, the command you want 
next will have different names. To open a submenu, 
point to the appropriate command:
 
• Text fields: Text filters
 
• Numeric fields: Number filters
 
• Date fields: Date filters
 
3. Choose the filter that most closely matches what you 
want to do. For example, if you’re working with a Date 
field, after pointing to Date Filters in Step 2, you might 
choose Before. See Figure 10-6.

➟
200
Part III: Excel 
Figure 10-6
 
4. The Custom AutoFilter dialog box appears for you to fin-
ish filling in the desired filter information. For example, 
if you choose Before in Step 2, it looks like Figure 10-7, 
prompting you to specify the date that all included 
records must be prior to.

➟
201
 Chapter 10: Using Excel as a Database
 
5. Type the value you want. Depending on the field type, 
helpers might also be available. For example, in Figure 
10-7, you can click the Date Selector button to open a 
calendar from which you can choose a date.
 
6. Click OK. The filter is applied to the table.
To remove the filter, choose Data➪Clear, or reopen the field’s drop-
down list and choose Clear Filter from fieldname.
Split a Column’s Content
As you’re entering data into Excel, you might not give much thought 
to how that data will be used later. For example, when entering peo-
ple’s names, perhaps you used a Name field that contained both the 
first and last name of each person, as in Figure 10-8.
You can’t sort by last
name if the first and
last names aren’t in
separate fields
Figure 10-8
Suppose that you then decide that you want to sort the list by the last 
name of the person. You can’t do that with the data shown in Figure 
10-8 because sorting takes place according to the first characters in the 
cell, and that’s the first name.
Your best bet is to split the content into two separate cells, so that 
every field you want to sort or filter on is in its own separate cell. If 
there are only a few names, like in Figure 10-8, you could easily retype 
them. But what if there were hundreds?

➟
202
Part III: Excel 
Excel offers a feature called Text to Columns that can do a split for you 
automatically. It requires there to be a consistent indicator of where 
the split should occur, though: a delimiter. For example, in Figure 10-8, 
each first and last name are separated by a space, so the space is the 
consistent delimiter (separator) character.
 
 The Text to Columns feature doesn’t work on data 
that’s in a table in Excel. If your data is in a table 
(from previous work in this chapter), convert it back 
to a range with the Design➪Convert to Range com-
mand before you go any further.
Have a look at the column you want to split, and decide what the 
delimiter character is. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Make sure there is an empty column to the right of the 
one you are going to split. Insert a new column if needed 
(Home➪Insert➪Insert Sheet Columns).
 
2. Select the range containing the data you want to split. In 
Figure 10-8, for example, the range would be A2:A5.
 
3. Choose Data➪Text to Columns. The Convert Text to 
Columns Wizard Step 1 of 3 dialog box opens.
 
4. Leave the Delimited option selected and then click Next.
 
5. In the next page of the wizard, select the appropriate 
check boxes to indicate what delimiter character(s) to 
use. (For example, in Figure 10-9, Space is chosen as the 
only allowed delimiter character.) Then click Next.
 
6. In the final page of the wizard, leave the default choices 
for field types and destinations, and then click Finish. 
Excel splits the data into the adjacent blank column. 
Figure 10-10 shows the split data from Figure 10-8.

7. Type a new field name in the first row of the new col-
umn, and change the field name for the split column if 
needed. For example, in Figure 10-10, I might change the 
text in cell A1 to First, and I might type Last in A2.
Merge the Contents of Columns
You can start with data in two columns (first and last names, for 
example) and then combine all the data in one column. The process 
of combining the columns is merging, or concatenating.

➟
204
Part III: Excel 
 
 Concatenating doesn’t work with data that’s in a 
table in Excel. If your data is in a table (from previ-
ous work in this chapter), convert it back to a range 
with the Design➪Convert to Range command.
Concatenating two or more columns is a four-step process:
 
1. Use the =CONCATENATE function to combine the values 
from two or more cells in the same column.
 
2. Copy the function to other cells so that the whole list is 
processed.
 
3. Use the Paste Values feature to paste the values from the 
functions into a new column.
 
4. Delete the original columns containing the split data, 
and you delete the column containing the functions.
Here’s the process in detail.
In the first step, the =CONCATENATE function combines the values 
from two or more cells into a single cell. So, for example, if you want 
to combine the value from A2 with the value from B2 with a space 
between the two values:
=CONCATENATE(A2,” “,B2)
the commas separate the pieces to be combined. The space in quota-
tion marks (“ “) creates the space between the two values.
After creating the function, copy it into the other cells in that column. 
For example, in Figure 10-11, I have a CONCATENATE function in cell 
C2, ready to copy into C3:C5. You can use any of the standard copy-
ing methods to do this, including the Copy and Paste buttons on the 
Home tab, the Copy and Paste shortcut keys (Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V), or 
dragging the fill handle (the black square in the bottom-right corner of 
the selected cell).

➟
205
 Chapter 10: Using Excel as a Database
You can drag fill handle
(black square) to copy
function to adjacent cells
CONCATENATE function combines values
Figure 10-11
Now you have a concatenated column, but you also have a problem: 
You can’t delete the original two columns because the functions are 
based on their contents. You could hide them, but that would make it 
awkward later when you added new records.
To work around this problem, you can use the Paste Values feature to 
copy the value (that is, the result) of the formula to yet another new 
column. Then you can delete both the original columns and the col-
umn containing the function. Follow these steps:
 
1. If the column to the right of the one containing the func-
tions is not empty, insert a new blank column there.
 
2. Select the range of cells that contain the CONCATENATE 
functions.
 
3. Copy them (press Ctrl+C or choose Home➪Copy).

➟
206
Part III: Excel 
 
4. Click in the first cell where you want to begin pasting the 
values.
 
5. On the Home tab, click the down arrow under the Paste 
button, opening a menu.
 
6. Click Paste Values.
 
7. Select and delete the columns that contained the original 
data and the column that contained the CONCATENATE 
functions. (Choose Home➪Delete.)

3. At the E-mail Accounts screen, you’re asked whether you 
want to configure an e-mail account. You do, so click Next.

 Outlook attempts to determine the name of your mail 
server and then contact it to set up your accounts, using 
an encrypted connection.

• If the encrypted connection doesn’t work, a message to 
that effect appears. Click Next, and it tries to connect 
unencrypted.
 
 If Outlook can determine the right settings (and it does 
in most cases), it logs into the mail server and sends a 
test message to you. Wait while all this goes on.
 
 If the test message fails, see the upcoming section, 
“Troubleshoot Mail Setup Problems.”
 
5. Click Finish.
 
6. Next, depending on what other Office programs you have 
run already, Outlook might prompt you for a User Name 
(see Figure 11-2). If so, enter your name and initials in 
the boxes provided and then click OK.

7. Outlook next offers that your RSS feeds in Outlook be 
synchronized with the Common Feed List. Click Yes.
 
 RSS stands for really simple syndication. One of 
Outlook’s features is to manage messages you receive 
via RSS.
 
8. Depending on what Office programs you’ve already run, 
the Privacy Options window might appear with three 
check boxes (see Figure 11-3). Mark or clear the check 
boxes as desired. If you have an always-on connection 
(like cable or broadband Internet access), mark all three; 
if you use a dialup connection, you might want to clear 
the check boxes so your PC doesn’t try to dial up to get

Set Up Additional Mail Accounts
If you have other e-mail accounts, you can set them up in Outlook, 
too. If you have a separate account for a home-based business or 
hobby, for example, you might want to be able to get the mail for that 
address at the same time you retrieve the mail for your main account.

 Chapter 11: Managing E-Mail with Outlook
 
 There are different kinds of e-mail servers, such as 
POP3, IMAP, and HTTP, but most of the differences 
are transparent to you as an Outlook user. A “regu-
lar” e-mail account that you get from your Internet 
service provider (ISP) is likely a POP3 account. A 
Web-based account is HTTP. IMAP accounts are 
uncommon for home users.
To set up another mail account (or to set up your first one, if you 
didn’t do that when you started Outlook for the first time), follow 
these steps:
 
1. Choose Tools➪Account Settings. The Account Settings 
dialog box opens.
 
2. On the E-Mail tab, click New. The Choose E-Mail Service 
options appear.
 
• Microsoft Exchange, POP3, IMAP, or HTTP
 
• Other
 
3. Make your selection and then click Next.
 
 Almost all types of e-mail accounts are POP3, IMAP, 
or HTTP, so the first option is the right choice 99 
percent of the time.
 
4. Fill in the information for the Auto Account Setup. (It’s 
the same as in Figure 11-1.) Then click Next.
 
5. Complete the setup by following the prompts that 
appear. If you have any trouble with it, see the next 
section.
 
6. When you finish setting up the account, click Close to 
close the Account Settings dialog box.

Part IV: Outlook 
Troubleshoot Mail Setup Problems
Each e-mail service has its own quirks in how the account has to be set 
up in Outlook (or any mail program) to properly send and receive. 
Outlook can automatically detect the settings in many cases, but it 
can’t always detect every service correctly.
If Outlook wasn’t able to successfully send a test message (see the ear-
lier section, “Set Up Outlook”), you need to do some troubleshooting. 
Don’t panic, though. It’s not that difficult. If you get stuck, you can 
always call your ISP’s tech support line and get help.
 
 If you’re using a Web-based e-mail provider like 
Yahoo!, gmail, or Hotmail, it might not work with 
Outlook. This is a known issue. Some services have 
workarounds that you can follow to make them work 
in Outlook; check the tech support section at the 
Web site where you get your Web-based mail to see 
whether there is anything you can do.
To troubleshoot mail problems, make sure you have the following 
information handy. If you don’t have it, contact your ISP. It might also 
be available on the ISP Web site.
 
➟ Your e-mail address and password: You probably 
have this already from your earlier attempt.
 
➟ The incoming and outgoing mail server addresses: 
They both might be the same.
 
 The server address is usually whatever comes after the 
@ sign in your e-mail address, preceded by the word 
mail. For example, if your e-mail address is tom@
myprovider.com, the mail server might be mail.
myprovider.com. If there are separate servers for 
incoming and outgoing mail, the incoming one 
might be pop.myprovider.com, and the outgoing 
one might be smtp.myprovider.com. Those are 

➟
215
 Chapter 11: Managing E-Mail with Outlook
just guesses, though; you will need to get that infor-
mation from your ISP.
 
➟ Information about whether an encrypted connec-
tion should be used
 
➟ Information about whether your outgoing mail 
server requires authentication: And if so, whether 
the outgoing server requires a different username 
and password than your regular one.
Armed with all that information, do the following to troubleshoot:
 
1. Choose Tools➪Account Settings. The Account Options 
dialog box opens.
 
2. Double-click the e-mail account you want to trouble-
shoot. The Change E-Mail Account dialog box opens.
 
3. Check all the information in the dialog box to make sure 
that it matches the information you have about your 
mail account. In particular, check the Account Type, 
Incoming Mail Server, and Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP).
 
4. Mark or clear the Require Login Using Secure Password 
Authentication (SPA) check box, whichever is different 
from the current setting. Then click Test Account Settings 
to see whether that fixed the problem. If it didn’t, go 
back to the original setting.
 
5. Click More Settings. On the Outgoing Server tab, mark 
the My Outgoing Server Requires Authentication check 
box. See Figure 11-4. From here, try each of the three 
options. After each one, click OK and then click Test 
Account Settings to check whether it helped.

➟

Part IV: Outlook 
Figure 11-4
 
 If you select the Log on Using radio button, fill in your 
user name and password in the boxes provided. For 
the user name, use your complete e-mail address. If that 
doesn’t work, try using only the part of your e-mail 
address before the @ sign. Try it with the Require Secure 
Password Authentication (SPA) check box cleared, and 
then try it with that check box marked.
 
6. Click More Settings. On the Advanced tab, drag the 
Server Timeouts slider closer to the word Long (that is, 
farther to the right). This can help give more time to a 
mail server that is slow to respond. A timeout delay of 
more than two minutes isn’t usually needed. Then click 
OK, and click Test Account Settings.
 
7. If you got Outlook to successfully complete a test mes-
sage, great. Close all dialog boxes.
 
 If not, contact your e-mail service provider’s tech support 
and find out what setting you need to change to make it 
work.

Take a Quick Tour of Outlook’s Mail Feature
After you configure Outlook for e-mail, take a quick look around the 
Outlook interface as it pertains to e-mail. It’s different from most of 
the other Office applications, in that it uses the older-style Office sys-
tem of menus and toolbars rather than the tabbed Ribbon of Office 
2007. Figure 11-5 points out the following features:
 
➟ Menu bar: Like in most Windows applications, the 
menu bar contains drop-down menus from which 
you can select commands.
 
➟ Toolbar: The toolbar is equivalent to the Ribbon in 
other Office 2007 applications; click a button on the 
toolbar to execute a command. (Point to a button to 
see a ScreenTip that tells its name.)
 
➟ Navigation pane: This pane shows different things, 
depending on the part of Outlook you’re working 
with. When working with mail, it shows the Mail 
Folders list (see Figure 11-5). You can move to a dif-
ferent folder by clicking its name here.
 
➟ Inbox: Whatever folder is selected on the Mail 
Folders list appears here. In Figure 11-5, that’s the 
Inbox. New mail arrives in the Inbox, so it’s the 
folder you work with most of the time.
 
➟ Reading pane: Whatever e-mail message is selected 
in the Inbox appears here in preview. That way, you 
don’t have to open each message (by double-clicking 
it) to see what it contains.
 
 By default, the Reading pane appears to the right of 
the Inbox. You can have it appear below the Inbox 
window, though; choose View➪Reading Pane➪
Bottom.

 The Navigation pane, To-Do bar, and Reading pane 
can all be turned on or off from the View menu.
Receive and Read Your Mail
After you configure your e-mail account(s) in Outlook, receiving mail 
is an automatic process. Outlook automatically sends and receives 
mail when you start it, and also at ten-minute intervals whenever 
Outlook is running. Your incoming mail comes automatically into the 
Inbox folder.

➟
219
 Chapter 11: Managing E-Mail with Outlook
You can also initiate a manual send/receive operation at any time. Just 
click the Send/Receive button on Outlook’s main toolbar.
Here’s how to change the interval at which Outlook automatically 
sends and receives mail.
 
1. Choose Tools➪Send/Receive➪Send/Receive Settings➪
Define Send/Receive Groups; or, press Ctrl+Alt+S.
 
2. In the text box next to the Schedule an Automatic Send/
Receive Every check box (which should be marked), 
change the number of minutes for the interval.
 
3. Click Close.
To read a message, click it in the Inbox. Its content appears in the 
Reading pane. Many people read their mail exclusively in the Reading 
pane, and never “open” a message formally. To open a message (that 
is, to display it in its own window, as in Figure 11-6), double-click it. 
Notice the Office 2007–style Ribbon
Figure 11-6

➟
220
Part IV: Outlook 
 
 When you open a message in its own window, the 
toolbar changes to the Ribbon-style toolbar, like in 
Word 2007 and other Office 2007 applications. The 
main Outlook interface is a hybrid of the older 
menu-and-toolbar style that you see in its main win-
dow and this Office 2007–style that you see in some 
of the data windows like this one.
View Photos and Other Attachments
E-mail messages can contain file attachments. The most common type 
of attachment is a photo; family members can send you photos that 
they took with their digital cameras, for example. The message in 
Figure 11-6 has a photo attached to it.
 
 Some types of attachments can carry viruses. (Pictures 
are generally safe, though.) If you have any doubts 
about the safety of any file you receive, do not open 
it. At the end of this chapter are some tips for dis-
cerning which attachments are risky.
You can tell that a message has an attachment by the paper clip icon 
next to it in the Inbox, as shown in Figure 11-7. Then in the Reading 
pane, note the icons and text (at the top of the message) representing 
each attachment. Click the attachment name in the Reading pane to 
see a preview of it. To get back to the message itself in the Reading 
pane, click the Message button.
You can also open the attachment in its original program by double-
clicking it.
If you want to save the attachment — download it — any of these ways 
will work:
 
➟ Right-click the attachment and choose Save As from 
the menu that appears. In the Save Attachment dia-
log box that opens, enter a file name and location, 
or accept the defaults. Then click Save.

➟ Double-click the attachment to open it in its native 
program. Then save the file from there, using that 
program’s Save command (probably File➪Save As or 
some variation of that).
Reply to a Message
Replying to a message is quick and easy because you don’t have to 
look up the recipient’s e-mail address. It’s already filled in for you.

➟
222
Part IV: Outlook 
To reply to a message, click the Reply button on the toolbar, choose 
Actions➪Reply, or press Ctrl+R. A message composition window 
appears with the original message quoted in the body of the message 
and the original sender’s e-mail address in the To field. See Figure 
11-8. Type your reply at the top of the message box, and then click 
Send to send your reply.

Clicking the Reply All button/command sends the reply to the original

 Using Reply All is useful for an ongoing e-mail dis-
cussion with a group of people. Be careful, though, 
that you don’t accidentally use Reply All and send a 
sensitive message to a wider audience than you 
intended.

➟
223
 Chapter 11: Managing E-Mail with Outlook
Compose a Message
When you compose a new e-mail message, you (not Outlook) fill in 
every piece of information: the recipient(s), the subject, and the body. 
Unlike with replying (see the preceding section), none of that infor-
mation is filled in for you automatically.
 
➟ Recipient: This is the information in the To field. 
You need the e-mail address of each person you 
want to send your message to. The Contacts section 
of Outlook provides storage for e-mail addresses; 
Chapter 12 addresses the Contacts list. For now, 
though, assume that you know the address and will 
type it in.
 
➟ Subject: You can type anything you want as the sub-
ject (or nothing at all), but your recipients will be 
appreciative if you keep the subject descriptive and 
to the point.
 
➟ Body: This is the main part of the message. It can be 
plain or formatted text.
 
 You can format the text in the message using the for-
matting controls on the Ribbon. These are the same 
as the formatting controls in Word; see upcoming 
Figure 11-9. Read all about Word formatting in Part 
II of this book.
To compose an e-mail message, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the New button on the toolbar, choose Actions➪
New Mail Message, or press Ctrl+N.
 
2. In the new message window that appears, type the e-mail 
address(es) for the recipient(s) in the To field.
 
 If you have more than one recipient, separate the 
addresses with a comma.

➟

3. (Optional) To send a courtesy copy to someone other 
than a main recipient, type the e-mail address in the Cc 
(carbon copy) field.
 
 You can also send a blind carbon copy (Bcc) to 
someone. A Bcc differs from a regular Cc in that none 
of the other recipients see the Bcc person’s name 
listed. To send a Bcc, click the To or Cc button, open-
ing a Select Names box. At the bottom of that box is 
a Bcc line. Type the cloaked recipient’s address there.
 
4. (Optional) If you have more than one e-mail account set 
up in Outlook, click the Account button and select the 
account from which you want to send.
 
5. Type a subject in the Subject line.
 
6. Type the message body in the body area (below the 
Subject line). Figure 11-9 shows a message ready to send.
Use these formatting tools, the same as in Word
Figure 11-9
 
7. Click Send to send the message.

➟
225
 Chapter 11: Managing E-Mail with Outlook
When you send a message, it’s immediately moved to your Outbox 
folder. There it waits until the next Send/Receive operation. You can 
send it immediately by clicking Send/Receive on the toolbar, or let it 
go out during the next scheduled Send/Receive.
If you click Send and then immediately realize you made a mistake 
and want to call back the message, here’s the fix:
 
1. Double-click the Outbox folder in the folder list at the 
left. 
 
2. Immediately double-click the unsent message to open it. 
As long you have the unsent message open, it won’t be 
sent. With the unsent message open, you can edit it or 
delete it.
If Outlook won’t let you open it because it already started transmit-
ting, do the following:
 
1. Click the Send/Receive indicator in the bottom right-
corner of the Outlook window to open a menu.
 
2. From that menu, choose Cancel Send/Receive as quickly 
as you can.
 
 Another workaround is to quickly exit from Outlook. 
A prompt will appear that you still have messages in 
your Outbox; click Yes to exit anyway. Then disable 
your Internet connection before you reopen Outlook.
Attach a File to a Message
You might sometimes want to send pictures from your own computer 
to other people via e-mail attachment, such as a photo, a document, 
or a spreadsheet. It’s easy to do!
After you compose the e-mail message (or reply to a message), click 
the Attach File button.

➟
226
Part IV: Outlook 
 
 The Attach File button doesn’t have a name on it, like 
Send or To. Instead, it’s an icon of a paper clip; see 
Figure 11-10.
This opens the Insert File dialog box. From here, you can navigate to 
the file you want and then click Insert. The attachment appears on the 
Attached field in the message composition window. See Figure 11-10.

If you change your mind about sending that attachment, you can 
delete it from the message by selecting it and pressing the Delete key.
Avoid Frauds, Scams, and Viruses
You might have heard horror stories about people whose computers 
became infected with viruses, worms, and all sorts of other nasty 
things, and who had to pay a lot of money to get it cleaned up – if 
they could. These stories are real, and so is the threat. However, you 
can do some very basic things to minimize your exposure to such 
risks.

➟
227
 Chapter 11: Managing E-Mail with Outlook
First, look at what the threats are:
 
➟ Spoofing/phishing: These legitimate-looking e-mail 
messages contain bogus links to Web sites that can 
trick you into providing confidential information, 
such as passwords and bank account data. Thieves 
then use this information to steal your identity and 
empty your bank accounts.
 
➟ Viruses: These executable files (that is, program files) 
do destructive things to your computer, such as 
delete files or corrupt a disk. Watch out for files with 
an EXE extension.
 
➟ Worms: These program files or scripts use your com-
puter to send out mass-mailings of spam without 
your knowledge or consent.
 
➟ Exploits: These program files or scripts target weak-
nesses in your computer’s security to use it to send 
out spam or do other harmful things. These usually 
come from hidden utilities built into some Web 
sites.
 
➟ Spyware: These hidden programs spy on your usage 
habits (including passwords you type, in some cases) 
and report them back to their owner via the Internet.
 
➟ Adware: These hidden programs pop up ads on your 
screen, or change the behavior of your Web browser 
to display its own ads.
 
➟ Unwanted search toolbars: These add-on toolbars 
replace your default search tools with the search 
database sponsored by a certain company, so that 
the results of your searches bring up their sponsored 
sites. 

➟
228
Part IV: Outlook 
Those are the threats you face. Now, look at how to face them down. 
Here are my top ten tips:
 
1. Because Windows XP and Vista don’t come with an anti-
virus program, you need one. Two of the most popular 
are Symantec (Norton) Antivirus and McAfee VirusScan. 
Install one, and keep it updated.
 
2. Most good-quality antivirus programs include incoming 
and outgoing e-mail scanning. Keep that feature turned 
on. It will protect you from most viruses and worms 
attached to e-mails.
 
3. Use the built-in, free Windows Vista program called 
Windows Defender, which protects against most spyware 
and adware. It is enabled by default. Do not turn it off.
 
4. If you get an e-mail with an attachment, be suspicious of 
it. Do not open the attachment until you verify the 
following:
 
➟ Is the attachment from someone you know?
 
➟ Were you expecting a file from that person?
 
 If the answer to either question is No, contact the person 
who sent it to you and find out what it is before you 
open it.
 
5. Never open any attachments that have any of these exten-
sions (file types): EXE, COM, BAT, VBS.
 
6. If you get an e-mail with an attachment with a ZIP exten-
sion, be extra suspicious. (A ZIP file contains other files.) 
One common worm infection distributes itself in a ZIP 
file that’s marked as an online greeting card, for example.
 
7. If you get an e-mail message that appears to be from your 
bank, be very suspicious. Most banks don’t do important 
business via e-mail. Instead, go directly to the bank’s 

➟
229
 Chapter 11: Managing E-Mail with Outlook
Web site directly, by typing its address into your Web 
browser. Whatever you do, do not click the link in the 
message.
 
8. If you get an e-mail message that appears to be from 
PayPal or eBay, be suspicious. These companies do 
send out legitimate e-mails, but phishing sites often 
impersonate those sites. Go directly to PayPal or eBay 
those sites via your Web browser; do not click the links 
in the e-mails.
 
 If a message from PayPal or eBay doesn’t address you 
by name, it’s more likely to be a fake. However, this 
isn’t a reliable way to tell.
 
9. If you’re not sure about a link in an e-mail, point the 
mouse pointer to the link. A ScreenTip appears showing 
the actual address that the link is pointing to. If it doesn’t 
match the text on the link, it’s probably a fake.
 
10. Some unwanted search toolbars trick you into installing 
them as you install other software. You can usually get 
rid of them via Control Panel in Windows. (Choose 
Start➪Control Panel➪Programs➪Uninstall a Program.) 
Scroll through the list of installed programs there and 
look for anything with toolbar in the name — and 
remove it.
 
 The Yahoo! and Google toolbars are okay to keep; 
these are legitimate.

O
utlook has a lot more to offer than just 
e-mail! Outlook is a full-fledged, personal 
information management program. It does a 
great job as an address book, a to-do list, and a 
storage cache for all the miscellaneous info 
that you might have “organized” on sticky 
notes all over your desk. Whatever information 
you need to organize, Outlook can help.
In this chapter, I show you how to use the 
Contacts part of Outlook to store and look up 
names and addresses, both e-mail and postal 
mailing addresses, which is a handy substitute 
for a standard paper address book. I also intro-
duce you to the Tasks list (which helps you pri-
oritize and manage your responsibilities) and 
the Notes database (where you can store every-
thing from confirmation numbers for your 
next vacation to passwords for the Web sites 
you visit).

Store Contact Information
Outlook refers to the information you store about people and 
organizations as contact information, which stores it in a folder called 
Contacts. To access the Contacts folder, click Contacts in the lower 
part of the navigation pane, on the left side of the Outlook window.
The Contacts folder, shown in Figure 12-1, shows each contact that 
you’ve entered.
 
 Although Figure 12-1 shows a lot of contacts, you 
don’t have any when you start out. You must enter 
each one individually.

 Chapter 12: Managing the Details: Contacts, Notes, and Tasks
To store someone’s contact information, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Contacts folder, do any of the following to 
open an Untitled - Contact window:
 
• Click the New button on the toolbar.
 
• Choose File➪New➪Contact.
 
• Press Ctrl+N.
 
2. In the Untitled - Contact window that appears, fill in the 
information you want to store for the person or organiza-
tion. You can fill in as much or as little as you like. For 
example, you can omit the Company if it’s not a business 
contact. Figure 12-2 shows an example.

 None of the fields are mandatory, but if the File 
As field is blank, Outlook displays a warning 
when you save, asking whether you intended that. 
 
 The more complete you make an entry for a per-
son, the more helpful Outlook can be. However, 
it takes more time to enter all the details required 
for a complete record than to just enter a name 
and e-mail address.
 
3. Click the Save & Close button on the Ribbon. The con-
tact is added to your Contacts list.
Here are some tips when entering contact information.
 
➟ Whatever you type in the Full Name field replaces 
Untitled in the dialog box’s title bar immediately.
 
➟ In the File As field, specify how this entry is alpha-
betized. The default is by last name, so it reverses 
whatever you put in the Full Name field. For exam-
ple, if you enter John Doe in the Full Name field, 
the File As appears as Doe, John. For people’s names, 
this is usually the best way to go. For a company 
name, though (such as ACME Industries), you prob-
ably don’t want it alphabetized as Industries, ACME. 
To fix that, open the File As drop-down list and 
choose ACME Industries.
 
➟ If you enter a company name (in the Company 
field), even more choices are available from the File 
As list. For example, you can choose to alphabetize 
by the company name rather than the individual, 
and to put the individual or company name in 
parentheses, like these:
 
• ACME Industries (Joe, John)
 
• Doe, John (ACME Industries)

also a drop-down list. Open the list and choose 
E-mail 2, E-mail 3, and so on for additional 
addresses.
 
➟ All Phone Numbers fields also have drop-down lists 
associated with their labels. You can store four 
phone numbers for a person, and you can choose 
which labels each of those will carry. For example, 
you could assign the label Mobile to one of the 
phone numbers.
 
➟ You can have three addresses for a person: Business, 
Home, and Other. Switch between them with the 
drop-down list in the Addresses section.
 
➟ When you enter an address but don’t enter it in 
proper mailing format (address, city, state, and zip 
code), a dialog box will prompt you to fill those in. 
This is for your own protection: to make sure every 
address you enter is usable.
 
➟ Use the Notes pane to store any additional informa-
tion about the person that doesn’t match up with 
any of the fields.
 
➟ To customize how your Contacts appear, choose 
from sets of fields other than the defaults. The ones 
in Figure 12-1 are the General fields. On the Ribbon, 
click the Details button for additional fields.
Edit and Delete Contacts
People move, get new phone numbers, and change e-mail providers. 
In a paper address book, you have to cross out the old address and 
write new information. (That sloppy look is a big part of what I hate 
about paper address books!) With Outlook, though, you can simply 
edit the stored information onscreen.

Editing a contact is a snap.
 
1. Double-click the Contact.
 
2. When that Contact’s dialog box opens (refer to Figure 
12-2), make any changes, and then click the Save & Close 
button.
To delete a contact from the list, do the following:
 
1. Select the contact.
 
2. Press the Delete key on the keyboard, or right-click it and 
choose Delete, or click the Delete button on the toolbar.
If you delete a Contact by mistake, you can retrieve it from the Deleted 
Items folder.
To restore an accidentally deleted Contact
 
1. In the navigation pane, click Mail. (No, it’s not really 
mail you’re after, but the Mail area provides easy access 
to the Deleted Items folder.)
 
2. In the navigation pane, under Mail Folders, click Deleted 
Items.
 
3. Locate the deleted contact in the list of items. See 
Figure 12-3.
 
4. Drag and drop the deleted contact onto Contacts in the 
lower part of the navigation pane. It’s restored.
 
 If you want to completely delete a contact, so it is 
irretrievable, delete it from the Deleted Items folder.

than a substitute for your paper address book.
To quickly locate a specific contact by filtering
 
1. Click in the Search Contacts field (upper-right corner).
 
2. Type a word that the contact information contains. (It 
doesn’t need to be the person’s name. For example, you 
could enter a town to find everyone who lives there.) The 
Contacts list is temporarily filtered to show only entries 
that contain that word.
 
 To clear the filter, click the Clear Search (X) button to

To address e-mail messages
 
1. When composing an e-mail message, click the To button, 
opening the Select Names: Contacts dialog box.
 
2. Click in the To field at the bottom of the dialog box.
 
3. Double-click a contact to add that person as a recipient.
 
 You can do the same thing with the Cc and Bcc 
fields.
 
4. Click OK when finished. See Figure 12-5.

Dial
Figure 12-6
If your PC uses a dialup modem connected to a live phone line, you 
can use Outlook to dial the phone for you.
To place a phone call
 
1. Select the contact and then click the Dial button on the 
toolbar. Refer to Figure 12-6.
 
2. In the New Call dialog box that opens, confirm the 
contact name and address and then click Start Call.
 
3. Lift the phone receiver, click Talk, and begin your call.
 
 Dialing a telephone isn’t a big chore, so why use 
Outlook to dial? For one thing, Outlook doesn’t 
make any dialing mistakes. That can be a great help if 
you have a disability. Another reason is that if you let 
Outlook manage the call, it adds a record of the call 
(and its length) to the Journal area of Outlook. The 
Journal is a tool for tracking your activities in 
Outlook. It’s used frequently by people who bill 
customers by the hour.
Create Notes
Lots of people use sticky notes to create reminders for themselves 
of bits of information: everything from Web site passwords to memo-
rable quotations. Outlook includes Notes, which are the electronic 
equivalent of these sticky notes. You can store anything you want on 
a note, but they are best used for small bits of data, like reservation

confirmation codes or membership ID numbers. You can leave a note 
open (as long as Outlook is open) so you will be reminded every time 
you see it, or you can close the note so that it isn’t in your way. Figure 
12-7 shows a couple of open notes, with the rest of them closed.

2. Do any of the following to start a new note:
 
• Click the New Note button on the toolbar.
 
• Press Ctrl+N.
 
• Choose File➪New➪Note.
 
 A new blank note appears.
 
3. In the new, blank note that appears, type whatever 
you want.
 
 The first few words of the first line will appear as an 
icon title, so try to be descriptive there. Unless, of 
course, you’re trying to camouflage information, like 
a password; then you might want some misleading 
text as the first line. I have a friend who keeps her 
passwords note that is titled Family Birthdays, think-
ing that someone snooping to steal her passwords 
would not care about family birthdays and would 
pass that by.
 
4. Close the note by clicking the X button in its upper-right 
corner. It’s saved automatically.
Here are some handy Note tips:
 
➟ To reopen a note: Double-click it. It remains open 
until you close it, or until you exit Outlook.
 
➟ To move a note: Drag it around by its title bar (the 
colored bar at the top of it), placing it anywhere 
onscreen, even outside boundaries of the Outlook 
window. It stays there until you close Outlook.
 
➟ To edit a note: Open it and edit away.

➟ To delete a note: Select it and do one of the follow-
ing: Click Delete on the toolbar, press the Delete key 
on the keyboard, or right-click the note and choose 
Delete from the menu that opens.
 
 Just like with a deleted contact, a deleted note is 
moved to the Deleted Items folder.
To retrieve a deleted note, open the Mail section of Outlook, display 
the contents of the Deleted Items folder, find the note, and drag it 
back to the Notes area. You can also right-click it, choose Move to 
Folder, and then specify where you want to move it.
Categorize Notes
Because a note is such a multipurpose item, you might find it useful to 
create categories to differentiate one type of note from another.
Outlook provides six color categories: Blue, Green, Orange, Purple, 
Red, and Yellow. By assigning a color to a note, you can indicate what 
type of information it contains. For example, you might choose to 
make financial notes green and make family notes blue.
To assign a color category to a note
 
1. Select the note.
 
2. On the toolbar, click the Categorize button. A menu of 
color choices appears.
 
3. Click the desired color. See Figure 12-8. The note’s icon 
and background turn that color.

➟

Outlook doesn’t affix any special meaning to a color; you do that on 
your own. Here’s how to assign text descriptions to each color:
 
1. Select a note.
 
2. On the toolbar, click the Categorize button.
 
3. Click All Categories. The Color Categories dialog box 
opens.
 
4. Click a category and then click the Rename button.
 
5. Type the new name for the category and then press Enter. 
See Figure 12-9, where I renamed the Blue Category as 
Registrations.
 
6. Repeat for each category; then click OK.
 
 You can also add more colors/categories. Click the

Use Tasks and the To-Do List
The Tasks feature in Outlook helps you create and manage action 
items for yourself and others. Not only can Outlook keep track of 
what you need to do, but it can remind you of upcoming deadlines, 
record what percentage of a large job you’ve completed, and even send 
e-mails out that assign certain tasks to other people.
To view the Tasks area of Outlook, click Tasks in the lower-left part of 
the navigation pane. See Figure 12-11.

Pay attention to the subtle difference in Outlook between Tasks and 
the To-Do List:
 
➟ Tasks are specific items you created in the Tasks sec-
tion of Outlook. Something isn’t technically a task 
unless it was created in the Tasks section.
 
➟ The To-Do List contains everything from the Tasks 
list, plus other items you have marked for action, 
such as e-mail messages you flag for follow-up.
 
 In the Inbox section of Outlook, you can flag a mes-
sage for follow-up by selecting it and then clicking 
the red flag button on the toolbar.

➟

In the upper part of the navigation pane, in the My Tasks section, you 
can click either To-Do List or Tasks to specify which set of activities 
you want to look at. For the purposes of this book, I assume that you 
chose Tasks. I describe how to work only with to-do items that are true 
tasks, not other items for follow-up.
To create a task, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Tasks in the navigation pane to display the Tasks 
area of Outlook.
 
2. Start a new task by doing any of the following:
 
• Click the New button on the toolbar.

 Tasks might appear differently on the list, depending 
on their statuses and due dates. For example, overdue 
tasks appear in red. Tasks that are 100-percent com-
plete appear in gray with strikethrough in some 
views, and do not appear at all in other views 
(because they’re no longer active).

Update the Status of a Task
As you make progress on a task, you can update its status in Outlook 
to reflect that.
 
➟ If the view you’re using contains a Status field 
(column), as in Figure 12-13: Click the task’s cur-
rent status to open a drop-down list, and then select 
a new status from there. Your choices are Not 
Started, In Progress, Waiting on Someone Else, 
Deferred, or Completed.
 
➟ If the view doesn’t contain a Status field: Double-
click the task to open it in its own window, and then 
use the Status drop-down list there.
You can also provide additional information about an in-progress 
task by entering a number in the % Complete field. If you set the 
% Complete value to 100%, Outlook automatically changes the 
Status to Completed.
 
 Use the Priority field to prioritize tasks. All tasks have 
Normal priority by default. The other choices are 
Low and High. You can then sort or filter the task list 
according to task priority if the view you are using 
includes the Priority field. (Switch to another view if 
it doesn’t.) The Priority field’s symbol is an exclama-

Set a Task Reminder
To help you remember to work on a task, you can set an alarm for it: 
a reminder. A reminder pops up onscreen at a certain date and time 
you specify.
To set a reminder for a task, follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click the task to open it.
 
2. Mark the Reminder check box.
 
3. Set the date and time for the reminder.
 
 A default-assigned sound plays when the reminder 
occurs. To change the sound, click the Sound button

Figure 12-14 shows a reminder being set for 8:00 a.m. on the task’s 
Due Date, for example.
 
 Set your reminder to occur before the task’s actual 
due date to give yourself some time to work on it. 
For example, set a budget’s reminder for two weeks 
prior to the date.
When the date and time come for the reminder, it pops up in a box 
within Outlook (if Outlook is running), and a sound plays, if 
assigned. If Outlook isn’t running at that date/time, it pops up the

Your Busy Life: 
Using the 
Calendar
You probably have a paper calendar you use 
to keep track of your appointments, meet-
ings, and events. The problem with a paper cal-
endar, though, is that it’s, well, paper. It’s 
limited.
The Calendar in Outlook offers everything a 
paper calendar does, and much more. You can 
easily switch between different views (daily, 
weekly, or monthly), and you can edit and 
delete calendar items without any messy pencil 
edits. You can even set up Outlook to remind 
you of an event shortly before it occurs. This 
chapter covers all that and more.

in Calendar to reopen this same dialog box. Then 
make your changes and click Save & Close.
To delete an event from Calendar, select it and press Delete, or right-
click it and choose Delete, or click Delete on the toolbar.
Set an Event to Recur
Some events happen on a regular schedule. For example, birthdays 
come every year (whether we like it or not!), organizations have 
monthly meetings, and religious services happen the same day and 
time every week.
Rather than setting up each occurrence as a separate event, you can 
create a recurring event. Outlook then puts all the occurrences on the 
calendar for you automatically.
To set up recurrence for an event, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the event, if it’s not already open, by double-click-
ing it in Calendar. The Event window opens (refer to 
Figure 13-2).
 
2. On the toolbar, click Recurrence. The Appointment 
Recurrence dialog box opens.
 
3. In the Recurrence Pattern area, select a radio button that 
best represents the type of recurrence you want. For 
example, in Figure 13-3, I chose Weekly.
 
4. Use the controls to the right of the option you just chose 
to specify the details of the pattern. For example, in 
Figure 13-3, the event recurs every week on Thursday.

➟
258
Part IV: Outlook 
These options change if you make a different selection at the left
Figure 13-3
 
 Notice in Figure 13-3 that a Weekly event can actu-
ally occur on multiple days of the week, and does 
not have to occur every week. If you set it to occur 
every four weeks, that’s basically once per month, but 
it’s different from choosing Monthly because it deter-
mines the next occurrence by counting weeks, not by 
counting months. In some months that have five 
weeks, an event that occurs every four weeks would 
happen twice, for example.
 
5. In the Range of Recurrence area, specify how many times, 
or for how long, the recurrence will continue. In Figure 
13-3, there is no end date specified, so the recurrence will 
continue indefinitely.
 
6. Click OK to accept the recurrence settings.
 
7. Click the Save & Close button to save your changes to the 
event.

➟
259
 Chapter 13: Your Busy Life: Using the Calendar
From this point on, when you double-click the event on the calendar, 
a dialog box asks whether you want to open that one occurrence or 
the series. If you choose to open the series, the changes you make to 
the event affect all occurrences.
If you want to edit or remove the recurrence, reopen the event, and 
then click the Recurrence button again. In the Appointment 
Recurrence dialog box that reopens (refer to Figure 13-3), you can 
make any changes you like. To remove the recurrence entirely, click 
the Remove Recurrence button.
Configure Event Reminders
Outlook can remind you of an event by popping up a Reminder box. 
The default lead time is 15 minutes, but you can set any amount of 
lead time you want. For example, if it takes you 45 minutes to drive to 
the meeting place, you might set the reminder for one hour prior to 
the meeting time.
To set a reminder for an event, follow these steps:
 
1. If the event isn’t already open, double-click to open it.
 
2. In the Options section of the event dialog box, open the 
drop-down list for the Reminder box and choose a time 
interval. See Figure 13-4. Or, to turn off the Reminder 
feature, choose None.
 
 At the bottom of the drop-down list is a Sound com-
mand, which you can use to change the sound that 
plays when the reminder occurs. The default sound is 
reminder.wav, which is a simple chime.

Getting Started 
with PowerPoint
PowerPoint is best known for creating busi-
ness presentations — slide shows, if you 
will — but it’s actually a much more versatile 
tool. PowerPoint is great tool for almost any 
situation where you need to convey a visual 
message. For example
 ➟ An overview of an organization or club 
for new members
 ➟ Posters and signs with large lettering, 
such as Please Help Yourself or Sign In 
Here
 ➟ A photo tribute for an anniversary 
celebration or memorial service
 ➟ Lyrics for a group sing-along
 ➟ Information about meeting rooms and 
activities at a seminar
This chapter offers you some basics for work-
ing with PowerPoint, including how to use 
slide layouts and content placeholders that 
make it easy to create all these types of 
materials and more.

 Explore the PowerPoint Interface
In PowerPoint, you work with slides and presentations rather than 
documents (as in Word) or worksheets (as in Excel). A slide is an indi-
vidual page of the presentation. The term page isn’t a perfect descrip-
tor, though, because PowerPoint slides are designed to be displayed 
on a computer screen or with a projector rather than printed. A presen-
tation is a collection of one or more slides saved in a single data file.
At a big-picture level, PowerPoint’s interface is very similar to that in 
Word and Excel: It has a Ribbon, an Office button, and a status bar. 
The default view of the presentation, called Normal view, consists of 
three panes, as shown in Figure 14-1.
Slide pane
Click here for Slides pane
Outline pane
Notes pane
Figure 14-1

➟
269
 Chapter 14: Getting Started with PowerPoint
 
➟ The Outline/Slides pane is the bar along the left 
side. It has two tabs: Outline and Slides. When the 
Outline tab is selected, a text-based outline of the 
text from the slides appears here. When the Slides 
tab is selected, thumbnail images of the slides 
appear here.
 
 The Outline tab doesn’t always show all text on all 
slides. It only shows text that has been entered using 
the text placeholders in the slide layouts. (More 
about this shortly.) If you add text to a graphic, or 
add a manually placed text box to a slide, that text is 
not included in the Outline tab.
 
➟ The Slide pane (that’s singular, not plural) in the 
middle shows the active slide in a large, editable 
pane. Here’s where you will do most of your work 
on each slide.
 
➟ The Notes pane runs along the bottom of the screen. 
Here you can type any notes to yourself about the 
active slide. These notes don’t show onscreen when 
you display the presentation, and don’t print (unless 
you explicitly choose to print them).
Work with PowerPoint Files
When you start PowerPoint, it automatically starts a new blank 
presentation for you, with a single slide in it. You can work with 
this presentation, and then save it in any of these ways, the same as 
in Word and Excel:
 
➟ Choose Office➪Save.
 
➟ Press Ctrl+S.
 
➟ Click the Save icon on the Quick Access toolbar.

➟
270
Part V: PowerPoint 
Or, if you prefer, you can open an existing presentation file, just like 
in other Office applications:
 
➟ Choose Office➪Open.
 
➟ Press Ctrl+O.
 
➟ Click the Office button and then choose one of the 
recently opened files on the right side of the Office 
menu.
Figure 14-2 points out these controls.

 Chapter 14: Getting Started with PowerPoint
 
 You can also start PowerPoint and open an 
existing file at the same time by double-clicking 
the filename from any file management window 
(such as Computer or Documents) in Windows 
Vista.
Understand PowerPoint Views
Like other Office applications, PowerPoint provides several different 
views for you to work with. Each view is useful for a different set of 
activities. Normal view (see Figure 14-1) — the default — is the most 
commonly used view. You can choose between the other views in 
either of these ways:
 
➟ Click one of the View buttons in the bottom-right 
corner of the PowerPoint window. (Not all the views 
are represented there.)
 
➟ On the View tab, click a button for the view you 
want.
Figure 14-3 shows Slide Sorter view, and also points out the two places 
where you can switch views.
Table 14-1 summarizes the available views and tells what each 
view is good for. I show you many of these views in more detail 
later, when I discuss how to do activities that these views are 
well suited for.

Create New Slides
Each new presentation begins with one slide in it: a title slide. You can 
easily add more slides to the presentation in any of these ways:
 
➟ Select the slide that the new slide should come after 
and then choose Home➪New Slide.
 
➟ In the Outline/Slides pane, click the Slides tab. Then 
click the slide that the new slide should come after, 
and then press Enter.
 
➟ In the Outline/Slides pane, click the Outline tab. 
Click at the beginning of the title of the slide that the 
new one should come before, and then press Enter.
When you add a new slide in any of these ways, you get the Title and 
Content layout. This is the default slide layout for all slides in the pre-
sentation except the first one. (The first slide’s default layout is Title 
Slide.) The next section covers slide layouts in more detail.
If you want a different slide layout when inserting a new slide, click 
the down arrow under the Home➪New Slide button. A palette appears 
showing various layouts. Click the one you want. See Figure 14-4.

➟
274
Part V: PowerPoint 
 
 To duplicate an existing slide, including all its con-
tent, select it and then choose Duplicate Selected 
Slides from the New Slide button’s menu.
Figure 14-4
Use Slide Placeholders
A slide layout is a combination of one or more content placeholders. 
For example, the default slide layout — Title and Content — has two 
boxes: a text box at the top for the slide’s title, and one multipurpose 
content placeholder in the middle that can be used for text, a graphic, 
or any of several other content types. See Figure 14-5.

➟
275
 Chapter 14: Getting Started with PowerPoint
Title placeholder
Content placeholder
Figure 14-5
Some placeholders are specifically for text. For example, the place-
holder for each slide’s title is text-only. Click in such a placeholder and 
type the text you want. A content placeholder, such as the large place-
holder on the default layout, can hold any one type of content: text, 
table, chart, SmartArt graphic, picture, clip art, or media clip (video or 
sound). Later chapters explain some of these other types of content in 
more detail.
To add text to a content placeholder, click the Click to Add Text area 
and type what you want. To add any other type of content, click the 
icon in the placeholder for the type you want. These are identified in 
Figure 14-6.
 
 Use placeholders whenever possible rather than man-
ually placing content on a slide. If you change the 
presentation’s design (covered in Chapter 15), any 
content in placeholders is automatically shifted and 
reformatted to match the new design.

Turn Text AutoFit Off or On
If you type more text than will fit in that text box (especially common 
for a slide title, for example), the text automatically shrinks itself as 
much as is needed to allow it to fit. This feature — AutoFit — is turned 
on by default. AutoFit is very useful because it prevents text from being 
truncated.
Sometimes, however, you might not want text to AutoFit. For example, 
it might be important to you that all the titles on your slides be exactly 
the same font size, for consistency.
To control whether AutoFit is in effect in a particular text placeholder, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the text box and choose Format Shape from 
the menu that appears.
 
2. In Format Shape dialog box that appears, click Text Box 
(on the left).
 
3. In the AutoFit section of the dialog box (Figure 14-7), 
select the Do Not AutoFit radio button.
 
4. Click the Close button.

➟
277
 Chapter 14: Getting Started with PowerPoint
Figure 14-7
If you don’t want to use AutoFit at all, you can turn it off at a global 
level. To do so, do the following:
 
1. Choose Office➪PowerPoint Options.
 
2. Click Proofing (on the left).
 
3. Click the AutoCorrect Options button. The AutoCorrect 
dialog box opens.
 
4. Click the AutoFormat As You Type tab.
 
5. In the Apply as You type section (see Figure 14-8), clear 
the following check boxes:
 
• AutoFit Title Text to Placeholder
 
• AutoFit Body Text to Placeholder
 
6. Click OK.

➟
278
Part V: PowerPoint 
Figure 14-8
Change Slide Layouts
The Title and Content layout is very versatile. You can place any one 
type of content on the slide, in addition to a text title. Sometimes, 
though, you might want something different: for example, two differ-
ent content types on the same slide (like a bulleted list on one half 
and a picture on the other) or just a title with an empty space under-
neath it (for manually inserted content).
To change a slide’s layout, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the slide for which you want to change the layout.
 
2. Choose Home➪Layout. A palette of the available layouts 
appears, as shown in Figure 14-9.
 
3. Click the layout you want.

 Chapter 14: Getting Started with PowerPoint

Move or Resize Slide Content
Each placeholder box on a slide is a separate object. It can be moved 
or resized freely.
To resize a box, select it and then drag a selection handle. A selection 
handle is a circle or square on the border of the box. Each box has 
eight selection handles: one in each corner, and one on each side. 
(The green circle handle at the top of the selected box rotates it when 
dragged.) To maintain the height-width proportion for the box — its 
aspect ratio — hold down the Shift key while you drag one of the 
corner selection handles. See Figure 4-10.

➟
280
Part V: PowerPoint 
Corner selection handles resize both height and width at once
Side selection handles resize only one dimension
Figure 14-10
To move a placeholder box, position the mouse pointer over the 
border of the box, but not over a selection handle. The mouse pointer 
changes to a four-headed arrow. Click and drag the box to a new 
location.
 
 If you resize the placeholder(s) on a slide and then 
apply a different layout or design to the slide, every-
thing snaps back to the default size and location. 
So make sure you have the right layout and design 
chosen before you spend a lot of time resizing or 
moving placeholders.
 
 If you want to move or resize a certain placeholder 
on every slide in your presentation, do so from Slide 
Master view (covered in Chapter 15). That way, you 
can make the change to the layout’s template, and 
the change is applied automatically to every slide 
that uses that layout.
Manually Place Text on a Slide
Whenever possible, you should use the layout placeholders to insert 
slide content. However, sometimes you might not be able to find a 
layout that’s exactly what you want. For example, maybe you want to 
add a caption or note next to a picture, or you want to create a collage 
of text snippets arranged randomly on a slide.

➟
281
 Chapter 14: Getting Started with PowerPoint
 
 The text in such a text box doesn’t appear in the 
Outline, so use this type of text box sparingly.
Here’s how to create a manual text box on a slide:
 
1. Display the slide.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Text Box. The mouse pointer turns into a 
vertical line.
 
3. Click where you want the text to appear, and then start 
typing.
Manually placed text boxes behave somewhat differently from place-
holder text boxes.
 
➟ The text box widens as you type. The text doesn’t 
automatically wrap to the next line. You can press 
Enter to create a new paragraph, or press Shift+Enter 
for a line break within the same paragraph.
 
➟ Manually placed text boxes aren’t resizable. The 
box resizes itself to fit whatever text is inside it.
If you want a manual text box to behave more like a placeholder, 
adjust its AutoFit setting:
 
1. Right-click the text box and choose Format Shape from 
the menu that appears.
 
2. Click Text Box.
 
3. In the AutoFit section, select one of these options:
 
• Do Not AutoFit: Turns off all AutoFit properties, which 
allows you to manually resize the text box. Text 
doesn’t resize if it doesn’t fit in the box.

➟
282
Part V: PowerPoint 
 
• Shrink Text on Overflow: Turns on AutoFit. You can 
manually resize the text box. Text resizes if it doesn’t 
all fit in the box.
Navigating and Selecting Text
As in Word and Excel, you might find using keyboard shortcuts more 
convenient than using the scroll bar (shown in Chapter 1). 
 
 The function of some PowerPoint keyboard shortcuts 
depends on whether you’re editing in a text box or 
navigating in a presentation.

Part V: PowerPoint 
Understand and Apply Themes
A theme is a design set that you apply to a PowerPoint presentation to 
change several elements at once, including background, color scheme, 
fonts, and the positions of the placeholders on the various layouts. 
Word and Excel also use themes, but in PowerPoint, the theme feature 
is exceptionally strong and full featured.
All presentations have a theme, but the default theme — literally 
named Blank — is so plain that it’s almost like it’s not there at all. 
Blank uses a white background, black Calibri text, and no background 
or design graphics.
To switch to a different theme, display the Design tab and then do one 
of the following:
 
➟ Click one of the themes in the Themes group. See 
Figure 15-1.
 
➟ Open the Themes menu (by clicking the arrow 
pointed out in Figure 15-1) and then click the one 
you want.
Click a theme
Click here to see more themes
Figure 15-1

➟
287
 Chapter 15: Dressing Up Your Presentations
Notice the several categories on the Themes menu (see Figure 15-2). 
The Built-In themes — the ones that come with PowerPoint — are 
always available. The theme under This Presentation is the one in use. 
The Custom section contains any themes you created yourself.
Figure 15-2
 
 For even more themes, click More Themes on 
Microsoft Office Online (bottom of the Themes 
menu). Browsing additional themes requires an 
Internet connection.
 
 To create your own theme, set up a presentation’s 
formatting how you want by formatting the Slide 
Master (covered later in this chapter), and then use 
the Save Current Theme command on the Themes 
menu (see Figure 15-2) to save it.

➟
288
Part V: PowerPoint 
Change the Presentation Colors
Each theme can be applied in a variety of color combinations, so you 
don’t have to choose between a theme that has the right style and one 
that has the right colors.
When you apply a theme, it appears with its default colors. Here’s how 
to choose different colors for it:
 
1. Choose Design➪Colors.
 
2. Click the color combination you want. See Figure 15-3.
Figure 15-3

➟
289
 Chapter 15: Dressing Up Your Presentations
 
 If none of these color combinations appeal to you, 
create your own combination. At the bottom of the 
Colors menu, click Create New Theme Colors, and 
then choose the exact colors you want from the 
Create New Theme Colors dialog box that appears.
Edit Slide Masters
When you choose a theme, the theme is applied to the Slide Master, 
which is a template that affects the look of all slides in the presenta-
tion. Formatting the Slide Master automatically formats every slide, 
and that’s a big bonus because a presentation looks more professional 
when all the slides match.
After applying a theme, if the appearance isn’t exactly the way you want 
it, you could change the formatting on each individual slide, but it’s 
much more consistent and easy to simply make the change once to the 
Slide Master and let that change trickle down to the individual slides.
To edit the Slide Master, choose View➪Slide Master. The slide that 
appears isn’t an actual slide in your presentation, but rather a tem-
plate. Or, more precisely, a series of templates: one for each of the dif-
ferent layouts. You can make changes in two ways, depending on the 
scope of change you want to make:
 
➟ To make a change that affects every slide, regard-
less of its layout: Click the top left slide in the left 
pane. This top slide is the master for the entire 
presentation.
 
➟ To make a change that affects only a certain 
layout: Select that layout’s thumbnail image from 
the left pane. See Figure 15-4.

➟
290
Part V: PowerPoint 
Select the topmost slide to affect all slides
Change the fonts and sizes of the sample text to change the text on all slides
Select one of the individual layouts to affect only slides with that layout
Figure 15-4
Here are some of the edits you might want to make:
 
➟ Select a different set of fonts from the Slide 
Master➪Fonts list.
 
➟ Change the font used for an individual bullet level 
by selecting the text sample representing that level 
and then choosing a different font from the Home 
tab’s Font drop-down list.
 
➟ Apply a different bullet type to each line of sample 
text (from the Home tab) to change the bullet char-
acters used at each level.

➟
291
 Chapter 15: Dressing Up Your Presentations
 
➟ Move a placeholder on the slide by dragging its 
border.
 
 To move a placeholder, drag its border — not the 
selection handle. See the next bullet.
 
➟ Resize a placeholder by dragging one of its selection 
handles.
 
➟ Delete, resize, or recolor the background graphic 
provided by the theme (if any).
When you’re finished working with the slide master, choose Slide 
Master➪Close Slide Master to return to Normal view. (I talk about the 
different views in PowerPoint in the preceding chapter.)
Format Text Boxes and Placeholders
In most cases, presentations look best when they’re consistently for-
matted. That means that usually your best bet is to apply formatting to 
the Slide Master, as I discuss in the preceding section.
Sometimes, however, you might want to format an individual text box 
or object differently from the rest, to make it stand out.
The easiest way to apply formatting to an object is with the Shape 
Styles command. Shape Styles are formatting presets that use the theme 
colors in the presentation. Depending on the style you choose, a 
Shape Style can include a border, a fill color, and special effects that 
make the shape look shiny, matte, or raised.
To apply a Shape Style to an object
 
1. Select the object. If it’s a text box, click its outer border to 
select the box itself (not text inside it).
 
2. Click the Format tab.

➟
292
Part V: PowerPoint 
 
 If you don’t see a Format tab, you don’t have an 
object selected.
 
3. Open the Shape Styles palette by clicking the down arrow 
in the Shape Styles group. See Figure 15-5.
Click here to open palette of Shape Styles
Figure 15-5
 
4. Click the desired shape style.
 
 If none of the Shape Styles is what you want, you can 
also choose the background and an outline for an object 
separately. Use the Shape Fill, Shape Outline, and Shape 
Effects button menus on the Format tab (see Figure 
15-5).
 
 To quickly change text formatting within a text box, 
use the WordArt Styles button, also on the Format 
tab. It works just like the Shape Styles feature except 
that it applies to text.
Insert Clip Art
Clip art is predrawn generic artwork, and Microsoft provides many clip 
art files for free with its Office products.
The easiest way to insert clip art is by using one of the placeholders 
on a slide layout. (I talk about placeholders in Chapter 14.) Follow 
these steps:

➟
293
 Chapter 15: Dressing Up Your Presentations
 
1. Display a slide that contains a Clip Art icon on one of its 
placeholders. You can see this icon in Figure 15-6.
 
 If the current layout doesn’t contain a Clip Art icon 
as a placeholder, switch to a different layout, or 
delete the existing content from the Content place-
holder so that the Clip Art icon is available in it.
 
2. Click the Clip Art icon to open the Clip Art task pane, 
which you can see on the right side of Figure 15-6.
 
3. In the Search For box, type a word that describes the art-
work you want; then click the Go button. Samples of the 
available clips appear. See Figure 15-6. If your Internet 
connection is active, PowerPoint includes clips from the 
Internet in the search results.
Type search word here
Click one of the found clips
Clip Art icon
Figure 15-6

➟
294
Part V: PowerPoint 
 
4. Click the clip you want. It’s inserted in the placeholder.
 
5. (Optional) Move or resize the image as desired.
 
• To move the image: Drag it by its center.
 
• To resize the image: Drag a selection handle around 
the edge.
 
 You can also insert clip art as independent objects on 
slides, separate from the layout placeholders. To do 
that, do not select a placeholder on the slide. Instead, 
just display the slide and then choose Insert➪Clip Art 
to open the Clip Art task pane, and go from there.
Insert Pictures from Files
One of the most common uses for PowerPoint is to display digital 
photos. There are a couple of ways to do that.
 
➟ Insert individual photos into presentations. I show 
you how to do it in this section.
 
➟ Create a special Photo Album presentation. I 
explain this in the next section.
First, look at how to put an individual photo on an individual slide:
 
1. To insert the picture into a layout placeholder, click the 
Picture icon on the placeholder. See Figure 15-7.
 
 If you want the picture to be independent of any 
placeholder, choose Insert➪Picture when no place-
holder is selected.
 
2. In the Insert Picture dialog box that appears, select the 
picture you want to insert. Change the location if needed.

➟
295
 Chapter 15: Dressing Up Your Presentations

3. Click Insert. The picture appears on the slide.
 
4. (Optional) Move or resize the image as desired.

• To resize the image: Drag a selection handle around 
the edge.
Create a Photo Album Presentation
If you want to create a presentation that is primarily (or exclusively) 
photos, there’s a special feature just for you! The Photo Album feature 
makes it easy to create photo-centric presentations with special features 
such as picture edging, framing, and captions.
 
 Before you get started, find your photos. Know where 
on your computer they are stored. (Check the 
Pictures folder! That’s where many digital camera 
management programs put them by default.)

Follow these steps to create a photo album:
 
1. Choose Insert➪Photo Album. The Photo Album dialog 
box opens. See upcoming Figure 15-8.
 
2. Click the File/Disk button. The Insert New Pictures dialog 
box opens.
 
3. Select the pictures you want to include.
 
 To select more than one picture at a time, hold down 
the Ctrl key while you click each one.
 
4. Click Insert. The pictures you select appear in the 
Pictures in Album list of the Photo Album dialog box.

7. In the Album Layout section of the dialog box, select the 
following options:
 
• Picture Layout: Choose how many pictures you want 
per slide.
 
• Frame Shape: Choose a frame shape/style for each 
photo.
 
• Theme (optional): Click the Browse button and then 
select a presentation theme to apply to the photo 
album.
 
 You don’t have to choose the theme now; you can 
apply a theme change to the presentation after its 
creation (Design➪Themes).
 
8. Click the Create button. A new presentation is created 
using your photos.
The resulting presentation is like any other presentation, except for 
one small extra: Because it is a photo album, you can return to the 
Photo Album dialog box at any time to manage the photos and effects. 
To do so, on the Insert tab, click the down arrow below the Photo 
Album button, and then choose Edit Photo Album from the menu 
that appears.

Adding 
Movement 
and Sound
R
emember slide projectors? Maybe you still 
even have one in the back of your closet. 
They show one slide after another on a screen, 
with a ker-chunk sound as the next slide pushes 
the previous one out the chute. Not very glam-
orous or exciting.
In PowerPoint, though, because your slides are 
electronic, a presentation can have much more 
exciting animation. You can assign any sounds 
or music you want, and you can create interest-
ing animations when one slide replaces 
another or when content appears on a slide. A 
bulleted list can appear one line at a time, a 
graphic can “fly” in separately from the text, or 
a trumpet sound can announce an important 
slide’s appearance.
In this chapter, I show you how to create ani-
mation and transition effects on slides. I also 
show you how to add a musical soundtrack 
from an audio CD to a presentation.

Animate Objects on a Slide
By default, all the objects on a slide appear at once. Say you have a 
title, some text, and perhaps a graphic on a slide: They all show up 
together.
To add more visual interest to the presentation or to reveal bits of 
information at a time, you can use animation in PowerPoint. For 
example, you can pose a question in the title of the slide and then 
provide the answer in the body. Or, you can have each item in a bul-
leted list appear one at a time.
You can control when the delayed content shows up by setting
 
➟ A time delay: The additional content appears after a 
certain number of seconds. This technique is good 
for autonomous presentations (without human 
interaction).
 
➟ A mouse click delay: Additional content appears 
only when you click the mouse or press a key on the 
keyboard. This technique is good for presentations 
with a live speaker because if someone asks a ques-
tion or you get off-schedule, the animation won’t 
occur at the wrong time — you control its timing.
For simple animation, pick an animation style from the Animation 
tab. Follow these steps:
 
1. Select the object to be animated. For example, if you 
want to animate a bulleted list on a slide, select the text 
box that contains those bullets. Or if you want to ani-
mate a graphic, select the graphic.
 
2. Choose Animations➪Animate. A drop-down list opens. 
The three effects available are

➟
301
 Chapter 16: Adding Movement and Sound
 
• Fade: The object gradually fades into view.
 
• Wipe: The object is painted onto the screen in a wip-
ing motion.
 
• Fly In: The object flies onto the slide.
 
 If the object you chose is a text box, those three effects 
appear as category headings, as in Figure 16-1. The 
choices underneath each category are
 
• All at Once: The text appears when you click the 
mouse, all paragraphs at once.
 
• By 1st Level Paragraphs: The first paragraph of the text 
appears when you click the mouse, and then next 
paragraph when you click again, and so on.
Figure 16-1
 
 If the object you choose is a graphic, Fade, Wipe, and 
Fly In are simple choices on the menu.
 
3. Choose the option you want for the animation.
 
4. (Optional) To see a preview of the animation you chose, 
choose Animations➪Preview.

➟
302
Part V: PowerPoint 
If you want animation other than one of these defaults, you must use 
the Custom Animation task pane. To do this
 
1. Choose Animations➪Custom Animation.
 
2. In the Custom Animation task pane (on the right), any 
animations you created via the presets already appear. 
See Figure 16-2.
The most common custom animation is to set the animation to occur 
automatically on a time delay rather than having it execute on mouse 
click. To make this change, do the following:
 
1. Select the animation in the Custom Animation task pane.
 
2. In the task pane, open the Start drop-down list and 
choose After Previous.
 
3. Right-click the animation in the task pane and choose 
Timing. A dialog box appears for the effect with the 
Timing tab displayed. See Figure 16-2.
Figure 16-2

➟
303
 Chapter 16: Adding Movement and Sound
 
 Instead of performing Step 2, you can wait until you 
open the dialog box (in Step 3) and then set the Start 
value to After Previous there in the dialog box.
 
4. Enter a number of seconds of delay in the Delay field.
 
5. Click OK.
Another common change you might want to make is to change how 
text is animated (all at once, or paragraph by paragraph). To do that
 
1. Double-click the animation in the task pane. A dialog 
box for the effect appears.
 
2. Click the Text Animation tab.
 
3. Open the Group Text drop-down list and choose the 
grouping for the animation (All at Once, By 1st Level 
Paragraphs, or some other choice.)
 
4. Click OK.
You can also set up your own custom animation effects from scratch. 
This is where the real power of custom animation comes into play!
Follow these steps to create your own custom animation for an object:
 
1. Select the object.
 
2. Open the Custom Animation task pane if it’s not already 
open (choose Animations➪Custom Animation).
 
3. Click Add Effect. A fly-out menu appears.

➟
304
Part V: PowerPoint 
 
4. Point to Entrance on the fly-out menu. Several common 
entrance effects appear.
 
5. Click More Effects. The Add Entrance Effect dialog box 
opens. See Figure 16-3.
Figure 16-3
 
6. Click the effect you want.
 
 Notice that the effects are grouped according to the 
intensity of the effect. The ones categorized as Basic 
or Subtle are not too showy; the Moderate and 
Exciting ones will make your audience smile! 
(Beware, though, that if the audience is too involved 
with the style of the presentation, it could distract 
them from its content.)
 
7. Click OK.

➟
305
 Chapter 16: Adding Movement and Sound
After creating the effect, you can edit it the same as other effects. 
From the task pane, click the effect and then use these drop-down 
lists above it:
 
➟ Start: Choose to start on a mouse click, or with or 
after the previous animation effect.
 
➟ Property: This choice isn’t always available. It is 
available if the animation effect you choose has 
options, such as flying in from a particular direction. 
The options available here vary.
 
➟ Speed: This choice controls the speed of the anima-
tion effect.
 
 When the Custom Animation task pane is displayed, 
numbers appear on the objects on the slide to tell 
what order their effects will execute in. You can con-
trol the order in which objects animate by using the 
up and down Re-Order arrow buttons at the bottom 
of the task pane.
Add Slide Transition Effects
Transition effects are much like animations except that they apply to 
entire slides. A transition effect is the flourish that occurs when you 
transition between one slide and another. The default transition effect 
is No Transition, which means one slide simply goes away and 
another appears, with no flourish at all.
Some of the transition effects you can use include fades, cuts, dis-
solves, and wipes. It’s difficult to explain each of these effects, but if 
you see them, you’ll immediately understand them, so try them out:
 
1. Click the Animations tab.

➟
306
Part V: PowerPoint 
 
2. In the Transition to This Slide group, point at one of the 
transition effects (see Figure 16-4). Its name appears in a 
ScreenTip, and a preview of it appears on the active slide.
Point to a transition to see a preview of it
Click here for more choices
Apply same transition to every slide in the presentation
Figure 16-4
 
 For more choices, click the More button (the down arrow 
with a line across its top) to open a palette of more tran-
sition effects.
 
3. When you’re ready to select a transition for a slide, click 
the transition you want (rather than just pointing at it). 
It’s immediately applied to the active slide.
 
 Use the Speed and Sound drop-down list boxes to 
the right of the transitions to customize the speed at 
which the transition occurs and the sound that plays 
when the transition occurs (if any). Be wary of 
assigning sounds to transitions, though; in a long 
presentation, audiences might find them annoying.
Set Slides to Automatically Advance
By default, slides transition from one to another on mouse click, not 
automatically. If you want the slide show to progress automatically, 
with a certain amount of pause between slides, choose Animations➪
Automatically After, and then enter a number of seconds. See 
Figure 16-4.

➟
307
 Chapter 16: Adding Movement and Sound
That setting applies only to the active slide, but you can easily apply it 
to all slides by doing the following:
 
1. Click in the Slides/Outline pane in Normal view, or 
switch to Slide Sorter view.
 
 Read about views in Chapter 14.
 
2. Press Ctrl+A to select all slides.
 
3. Choose Animations➪Automatically After and enter the 
number of seconds. The change will apply to all slides.
 
 At any time, you can test your presentation by going 
into Slide Show view (choose View➪Slide Show). 
Press Esc to return to Normal view.
Add a Musical Soundtrack
As your presentation plays, you might want to have music in the back-
ground. PowerPoint enables you to load an audio CD on the PC that’s 
being used to show the presentation and play the CD in synchroniza-
tion with the presentation.
 
 Musical soundtracks work best for self-running 
presentations: that is, those presentations where the 
slides are set to advance automatically after a certain 
number of seconds. In a presentation with a live 
speaker manually advancing the slides, that live 
speaker is probably also speaking to the audience, 
and the speech can interfere with the music (and 
vice versa).
To set up an audio CD track, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the first slide in the presentation, or the slide on 
which the music should start playing.
 
2. Insert the audio CD in your computer’s CD drive.

➟
308
Part V: PowerPoint 
 
3. On the Insert tab, click the down arrow below the Sound 
button, displaying a menu.
 
4. Click Play CD Audio Track. The Insert CD Audio dialog 
box opens.
 
5. Enter track numbers in the Start at Track and End at 
Track list boxes. See Figure 16-5.
Figure 16-5
 
6. (Optional) To have the chosen song(s) repeat if the pre-
sentation runs longer than the song, select the Loop Until 
Stopped check box.
 
7. Select the Hide Sound Icon During Slide Show check 
box.
 
8. Click OK. A prompt asks whether you want the music to 
play automatically or when clicked.
 
9. Click Automatically.
 
 At this point, the music is attached to the first slide 
in the presentation. The rest of the steps here are nec-
essary to make the music continue to play after you 
move past the first slide.

10. Display the Custom Animation task pane (choose 
Animations➪Custom Animation).
 
11. Double-click the CD Audio animation in the task pane. 
The Play Audio CD dialog box opens. See Figure 16-6.

13. Click OK.
 
14. Check your work by viewing the presentation in Slide 
Show view (View➪Slide Show).
 
 The music you pick isn’t stored with the presentation: 
the music is linked to it. If you show this presentation

Presenting 
the Show
Presenting . . . your show!
The whole point of a PowerPoint presentation 
is to deliver a show to an audience. That audi-
ence might be in the same room with you or a 
thousand miles away. Folks might watch it 
simultaneously or pull it up on their own PCs 
at their convenience.
This chapter explains how to display a presen-
tation on your own computer screen. That’s 
useful if you’re going to be there in-person 
when the audience views the show, like during 
a club meeting or religious service. I also show 
you how to pack a presentation to move it to a 
different PC as well as how to make printouts 
for yourself and your audience.
You also discover here how to make a self-
running CD that you can send to people so 
they can view the presentation on their own 
computers. Finally, I show you how to distrib-
ute a presentation over the Internet.

Display a Slide Show Onscreen
Slide Show view is the view that you use when showing the presenta-
tion to others. (Read more about PowerPoint views in Chapter 14.) 
One slide appears onscreen at a time, completely filling the screen. 
You might have used this view already — to check your work — while 
you were creating the presentation.
You can start Slide Show view from the first slide or from the current 
slide. Table 17-1 summarizes the methods of doing each.

 From the Pen menu, you can annotate a slide by 
drawing on it. You can use this tool to underline or 
circle important content, for example. Click the Pen 
button and then click one of the pen styles (such as 
Felt Tip). Then hold down the mouse and drag across 
the slide to “draw” on it. You can also change the ink 
color from the Pen menu. Give it

 Chapter 17: Presenting the Show
PowerPoint allows you to lock down or disable certain navigation 
methods in Slide Show view so that people interacting with your 
presentation at an unattended computer won’t inadvertently (or 
purposely) disable or damage the presentation. When one method is 
disabled, you might need to rely on another method.
Print Copies of a Presentation
There are many uses for printouts of a presentation. You might want 
to print the slides themselves, for example (one big slide per page), to 
use as a kind of low-tech delivery system. If you don’t have a computer 
or projector available, you can just hold up each slide, one by one! 
When you print in PowerPoint, you’re given a choice of the type of 
printout you want. Here are the choices available:
 
➟ Slides: A full-page copy of one slide per sheet.
 
➟ Handouts: Multiple slides per page (2 to 9, depend-
ing on your choice of settings), suitable for giving to 
the audience to take home.
 
➟ Notes Pages: One slide per page, but with the slide 
occupying only the top half of the page. The bottom 
half is devoted to any speaker notes you typed into 
PowerPoint.
 
➟ Outline View: A text-only version of the presenta-
tion, structured as an outline, with the slide titles as 
the top-level outline items.
To print any of these types of printouts, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Office➪Print. The Print dialog box opens.
 
2. Open the Print What drop-down list and choose what 
you want to print (handouts, slides, and so on).
 
3. Set any other print options desired:

➟
316
Part V: PowerPoint 
 
• Name: Choose the printer you want to use (if you 
have more than one).
 
• Print Range: The default is All.
 
 (Optional) You can enter specific slide numbers in 
the Slides field if desired.
 
• Number of Copies: The default is 1; enter another num-
ber here if desired.
 
• Handouts: If you choose Handouts in Step 2, choose 
the number of slides per page. See Figure 17-3.
 
 Different numbers of slides per page have different 
layouts. For example, if you choose 3 slides per page, 
the layout has lines next to each slide for the audi-
ence to take notes on.

 Chapter 17: Presenting the Show
Package a Presentation on a CD
The PC you play your presentation on might not always be the one 
you create it on. For example, if you’re traveling to different clubs or 
organizations to give the same speech, each one might have its own 
computer system attached to its projector. If you have a laptop, you 
can bring your presentation with you, but you might find it easier to 
simply bring the presentation on a flash drive or a CD.
If your presentation consists only of text and pictures, it’s self-contained 
in a single PowerPoint file (with a .pptx or .ppt extension), so you 
can just copy that file to your flash drive — or e-mail it to yourself as an 
e-mail attachment, or use some other method to carry it with you.
However, if you have multimedia content, such as video clips, those 
are not embedded in the PowerPoint file: They are linked. They are not 
stored in the main data file, but rather a link is created from their file 
to the data file, so that when the presentation plays, the content from 
the linked file is accessed. That means if you copy the PowerPoint file, 
you won’t automatically copy the linked content. If you didn’t know 
that in advance, you could run into a situation where you arrive at the 
site where you’re going to give your speech only to find out that you 
didn’t have all the presentation available!
There are other little gotchas as well about showing a presentation on 
a PC other than the one it was created on. For example, any fonts that 
the presentation uses must be available on the PC on which you’re 
showing it. If those fonts aren’t available, PowerPoint will try to sub-
stitute a similar font, but its definition of “similar” and yours might 
not be the same!
You can get around these problems by allowing PowerPoint to “pack” 
and copy the presentation file to another location. When it does so, it 
automatically also copies all the fonts, linked files, and other associ-
ated content needed to ensure a trouble-free show. You can package it 
to a folder on your hard drive and then copy that folder anywhere you 
like, or you can burn the package directly to a CD. 

➟

Here’s how to pack a presentation to a CD:
 
1. Choose Office➪Publish➪Package for CD. The Package 
for CD dialog box opens. See Figure 17-4.
 
2. In the Name the CD field, type the label you want to 
assign to the CD.
 
3. Insert a blank, writeable CD into your PC’s CD drive.
 
4. Click the Copy to CD button. If a warning appears about 
linked files, click Yes.

5. Wait for PowerPoint to copy the presentation to the CD.
 
6. A message appears asking whether you want to copy the 
same files to another CD. If so, insert another CD and 
click Yes. Otherwise, click No.
 
7. Click Close to close the Package for CD dialog box.
 
 When you make a CD or copy to a folder (coming 
up next), the PowerPoint Viewer utility is included. 
This utility allows the presentation to run without 
PowerPoint being installed on the computer.
Here’s how to pack a PowerPoint presentation if you want to copy the 
files to a folder, rather than to a CD:

➟

1. Choose Office➪Publish➪Package for CD. The Package 
for CD dialog box opens. Refer to Figure 17-4.
 
2. Click the Copy to Folder button. The Copy to Folder 
dialog box opens.
 
3. In the Folder Name field, type the name of the folder you 
want to create.
 
4. In the Location field, type the path to the location where 
you want to store the new folder.
 
 Click Browse to select a location by browsing if you 
prefer.
 
5. Click OK to accept the location. The files are copied to 
that location.
 
6. Click Close to close the Package for CD dialog box.
Save a Web Version of a Presentation
One way to distribute your presentation to other people remotely is to 
copy it to a CD or folder (as I describe in the preceding section) and 
then share that with other people. However, the person receiving the 
presentation must either have PowerPoint or the PowerPoint Viewer 
utility in order to see the show. (Read about this utility earlier in this 
chapter.)
An alternative is to publish the presentation in Web format so that 
anyone can see it in an ordinary Web browser such as Internet 
Explorer or Firefox, the same way they view Web sites on the Internet.
Some of the more complex features of PowerPoint don’t work exactly 
the same in a browser as they do in PowerPoint. In most cases, 
though, the differences are very minor, and you won’t notice them.
To create a Web-usable version of the presentation, follow these steps:

➟

Part V: PowerPoint 
 
9. (Optional) If you want compatibility with much older 
Web browsers, choose one of the following:
 
• Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0, Netscape Navigator 3.0, 
or Later: This saves the presentation in a more basic, 
backward-compatible format. It’s not an issue for 
those of us using a modern version of Windows (XP 
or Vista), but if you will show the presentation to 
people with much older computers, it might help.
 
• All Browsers Listed Above: This saves the presentation 
in a hybrid Web format that supports both older and 
newer browsers. With a newer browser, the presenta-
tion uses all the available features; with an older 
one, the presentation’s more basic. The file size will 
be larger than normal, though, because there are two 
different versions of the presentation stored in the 
same file.
 
10. (Optional) If you want to see the presentation in your 
default browser (to check how it looks), mark the Open 
Published Web Page in Browser check box.
 
11. Click the Publish button.
The files are “published” to whatever location you specified in Steps 
3-4. You can then transfer them to an Internet location (enlist the 
help of a techie friend if needed) or put the files on a flash drive or 
CD and share them with others.

People have different ideas about what 
constitutes the “best” way for a program 
to operate. For every feature that one person 
finds ideal, someone else might find that same 
feature very annoying. That’s why Microsoft 
Office 2007 has a variety of options that you 
can customize to make the applications work 
more like you want.
In this appendix, I show you how to customize 
the Quick Access toolbar and the status bar in 
all the Office applications. (It works basically 
the same in all of them.) Then I go through 
some of the most common program options in 
each application.

Customize the Quick Access Toolbar
The Quick Access toolbar is the small toolbar immediately to the right 
of the Office button in each of the Office applications (except 
Outlook). See Figure A-1. By default, the Quick Access toolbar 
contains only a few buttons:
 
➟ Button name: What it does
 
➟ Button name: What it does
 
➟ Button name: What it does
One of the handiest things about the Quick Access toolbar is that it’s 
available no matter which tab you’re on.
 
 If you find yourself using a button frequently (other 
than one of the default buttons), consider placing it 
on the Quick Access toolbar so you don’t have to 
switch tabs all the time.
Here’s how to add a command to the Quick Access toolbar:
 
1. Right-click the button or other control. A shortcut menu 
opens.
 
2. Choose Add to Quick Access Toolbar.
Another use for the Quick Access toolbar is to add buttons for com-
mands that don’t appear on any of the tabs. (Yes, there are many such 
commands. Most of them are carryovers from previous versions of the 
software, but some are new 2007 features that are rather obscure.)
To browse the available commands and add any to the Quick Access 
toolbar (including commands not already on the Ribbon), follow 
these steps:

➟
325
 Appendix: Customizing Office Applications
 
1. Choose Office➪application Options where application is 
the program. For example, in Word, you choose Word 
Options. A dialog box appears.
 
2. Click Customize in the bar at the left. Two columns of 
commands appear in the middle of the window. The 
left column holds the commands you can add, and the 
right column holds the commands already on the Quick 
Access toolbar. See Figure A-1.
choose commands to display
Relocate the Quick Access Toolbar below the Ribbon if desired
Figure A-1

➟
326
Microsoft Office 2007 For Seniors For Dummies 
 
3. At the top of the left list, open the drop-down menu and 
choose what commands you want to see on the list:
 
• Popular Commands: A selection of the most commonly 
used commands.
 
• Commands Not in the Ribbon: Commands that have no 
equivalent on any tab.
 
 Many of these are shortcuts to commands that 
were in previous versions of the application but 
are no longer featured in the 2007 version.
 
• All Commands: A list of all available commands.
 
• Macros: Any macros (recorded scripts) that have been 
stored in the active file or template.
 
4. Click a command in the left list and then click the Add 
button in the middle to move it to the list on the right. 
Repeat as desired to add more commands.
 
5. When finished, click OK.
To remove buttons from the Quick Access toolbar, return to the 
Customize lists (refer to Figure A-1), click a button’s name in the right 
column, and then click the Remove button in the middle. Or, take the 
easy way. Just right-click the button on the Quick Access toolbar and 
then choose Remove from Quick Access Toolbar from the menu that 
appears.
Customize the Status Bar
The status bar is the thin bar along the bottom of the application win-
dow. It contains View buttons (for switching between views), the Zoom 
slider, and perhaps a few other items, depending on the settings.

➟
327
 Appendix: Customizing Office Applications
Just like the Quick Access toolbar, you can customize the status bar:
 
1. Right-click the status bar. On the shortcut menu that 
appears is a list of all the items that the status bar can 
contain. The ones with check marks next to them are 
already displayed.
 
2. Click an item to toggle it on or off. See Figure A-2.

Set Word, Excel, and PowerPoint Options
So many options are available in each application that it would take a 
much larger book to cover them all. In this appendix, I review a few of 
my favorite options in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. (I cover Outlook 
options separately because they are so different.)

➟
328
Microsoft Office 2007 For Seniors For Dummies 
For each application, access the options by clicking the Office button 
and then click the application Options command, where application is 
the name of the app. For example, in PowerPoint, it’s PowerPoint 
Options. Then click a category at the left to display a page of options. 
See Figure A-3.
Figure A-3
Use Table A-1 as a handy guide to customize Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint. Note that options are listed on the different tabs at the 
left. For example, maybe what you’re looking for is on the Popular 
tab, or perhaps it’s on the Proofing tab. Open each tab to explore what 
they hold.
