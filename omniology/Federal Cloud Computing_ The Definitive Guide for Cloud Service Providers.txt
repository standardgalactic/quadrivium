This book is dedicated to my wonderful wife. Her support in giving me the oppor­
tunity to write this book cannot be expressed in simple words. For her continuous 
patience, encouragement, and for those times of sacrifice. For her inspiration and 
incredible love for reading and editing, even when the subject matter may not have 
been of interest to her.
To my dear, loving wife Erin.  
Thank you for tirelessly standing by my side and supporting me every step of the 
way. There are many times in one’s life where the task may seem too difficult, but 
having someone like you there as a guiding arm to encourage and to consult has 
been a blessing.
You have always been there when the times were challenging. It is with great honor 
to share this accomplishment with you.
To my wife, with love.

In recent years “cloud computing” has emerged as a model for providing IT infra­
structure, resources and services that has thepotential to drive significant value to 
organizations through increased IT efficiency, agility and innovation.  However, Fed­
eral agencies who were early adopters of cloud computing have learned that there are 
many challenges and risks that must be addressed in order to realize these benefits.  
These early adopters have learned that the use of a Cloud Service Provider 
(CSP) represents a fundamental shift in how IT assets are deployed and delivered 
on a day-to-day basis.  Successful adoption of cloud computing requires a change 
in approach to (among other things) security, privacy, end-user support, operations, 
acquisition and contract management.Challenges exist for CSPs as well.  Many 
players in this emerging marketplace are new to doing business with the Federal 
government.  As a result, they not only need to learn the nuances of the Federal 
acquisition processes, they must also address a myriad of security, privacy and cer­
tification requirements that are specific to Federal customers.
In order to mitigate these challenges and to catalyze the adoption of cloud 
computing within the Federal government, the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy 
was released on February 8, 2011.  The National Institute of Standards and Tech­
nology (NIST) and the General Services Administration (GSA) have key roles in 
the implementation of this “Cloud First” strategy.  NIST has developed a number 
of Special Publications that provide definitions, architectural standards and road­
maps for cloud computing.  GSA has developed the Federal Risk and Authoriza­
tion Management Program (FedRAMP) to define security, auditing, continuous 
monitoring and other operational requirements for Federal agency use of cloud 
computing.
I admire the groundbreaking initiatives that have been spearheaded by NIST 
and GSA.  And yet, these efforts have created a new landscape with its own set of 
twists and turns that must be navigated by both Federal agencies and CSPs wish­
ing to serve the Federal marketplace.  What has been missing so far is a definitive 
reference guide that will allow anyone with a stake in Federal IT to quickly ascend 
the learning curve associated with the goals, objectives, implementation and opera­
tional aspects of the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy. Mr. Metheny’s book fills 
this gap by providing a comprehensive view of how and where cloud computing 
fits in the Federal government and how the critical components of the Cloud First 
strategy will work together in a complementary fashion.  
I believe that this book will prove to be an invaluable resource to anyone who 
needs to successfully navigate the brave new world of Federal cloud computing. 
Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) will gain an understanding of the security and op­
erational requirements that must be met in order to provide cloud-based services to 
Federal agencies.  Cloud auditors who wish to provide services to Federal agencies 
or CSPs will learn the detailed requirements for becoming a Third Party Assessment 
Organization (3PAO).  Federal agency CIOs, CTOs and CISOs will benefit from

greater clarity regarding the impacts that the move to cloud computing will have on

underway to transform Federal IT in the 21st century. This book will provide excel­
lent guidance to everyone who wishes to undertake that journey.

Cloud computing is an epochal change in the use of technology by mankind.  Broad­
ly considered, it represents the transition towards the use of compute as a utility, with 
profound implications.  Just as when nations became electrified, the dawn of new in­
dustries, reorganization of societies and other unexpected outcomes are surely at our 
doorstep.  Access to supercomputer capabilities, previously only available to small 
groups of people with millions of dollars, is now available to all.
The ability for individuals, small businesses and large enterprises to have “on 
demand” access to a virtually unlimited supply of compute power and storage chal­
lenges our ability to innovate.  From discovering new drugs to unlocking the myster­
ies of the universe to finding better solutions for the human condition, we are only 
limited by our imagination. 
Governments are no different than any other organization in their propensity to 
be impacted by, and leverage the cloud.  The very largest problems facing govern­
ments have the potential to be solved in large part by the cloud.  Cloud will also force 
government agencies to be more transparent and collaborative with the information 
that forms the backbone of their services.  At the same time, a rush to adopt cloud 
computing without a sound understanding of its potential and risks could prove a 
devastating setback.  This book, “Federal Cloud Computing: The Definitive Guide 
for Cloud Service Providers” is a timely addition to our shared knowledge of what 
cloud computing is, the inherent risks, regulatory requirements and the ecosystem of 
standards and best practices. 
Cloud Security Alliance is a not-for-profit organization that is the leading global 
force in building trust within cloud computing.  We congratulate author and CSA 
member Matthew Metheny for his excellent contribution to the topic of cloud com­
puting within the US Federal government.  We feel this book is must reading for any­
one interested in information technology within our government.  Both government 
consumers and providers must understand the regulatory requirements, the processes 
for making cloud services available and best practices to mitigate risks and operate 
cloud systems securely.
Cloud computing is not only in our future, but is here today.  Whatever role you 
play in this topic, you have a mandate to find strategies to securely adopt cloud in an 
agile manner.  “Federal Cloud Computing: The Definitive Guide for Cloud Service 
Providers” is an excellent coach to help define those strategies.

INTRODUCTION
In February of 2011, the former US Chief Information Officer (CIO), Vivek Kundra, 
published the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy, herein referred to as the “Cloud 
Strategy.”1 The Cloud Strategy, as illustrated in Figure 1.1, was one of six major 
components of the US CIO’s roadmap to the cloud as defined in the 25 Point Imple­
mentation Plan to Reform Federal Information Technology Management.
In the Cloud Strategy, the federal government’s strategic approach for the adop­
tion of cloud computing technologies was described, including the potential benefits, 
considerations, and trade-offs [1]. The strategy also provided a decision framework 
for federal agencies to use in outlining their plan for using cloud computing to 
improve their efficient use of information technology (IT) investments to support 
their missions by leveraging shared infrastructures and economies of scale. This 
framework focused on changing how the government approaches IT and how it could 
effectively integrate cloud services into its existing IT portfolio.
The Cloud Strategy established a set of basic principles and guidelines through 
which decision-makers within federal agencies could use it to accelerate their secure 
adoption of cloud services. Through the strategy, federal agencies were empowered 
with the responsibility for making their own decision on “what ” and “how” to migrate 
to the cloud in support of the government-wide Cloud First policy. The Cloud First 
policy was established to create the momentum for federal agencies to proactively adopt

cloud computing services by requiring them to begin with the selection of three “cloud-
ready”2 IT services that could be migrated to secure and reliable cloud solutions.
In the section Decision Framework for Cloud Migration, a three-step framework 
described the foundational elements that were identified as being necessary for build­
ing a successful migration plan.3 In addition, the Cloud First policy gave federal 
agencies the opportunity to exercise their migration plans4 and develop and share 
“lessons learned ” from their experiences. The policy also established the require­
ment for a program5 to be developed that would encourage Cloud Service Providers 
2Cloud readiness was one dimension for making risk-based decisions when determining which IT 
service to migrate to the cloud. Readiness included factors such as: security, service characteristics, 
market characteristics, network infrastructure, application, and data readiness, government readiness, 
and technology lifecycle.

ident, Office of Management and Budget; 2011. Each migration plan includes: major milestones, 
execution risks, adoption targets, resource requirements, and retirement plans for legacy services after 
the cloud service is online.

Introduction
(CSPs) to meet federal security and privacy requirements through the development of 
“government-ready” cloud services.6
The federal government’s shift, from a traditional asset-based model focused on 
acquiring IT, to a service-based model offered by cloud computing is not only a 
change in the technology, but also a cultural change in the organization itself. The 
“shift” towards cloud services also requires organizational changes for managing the 
people and processes that are needed for procuring and provisioning cloud services. 
Cloud computing places an increased importance on how technology is planned, 
selected, and integrated.7 The new service-based approach to IT requires federal 
agencies to learn how to manage services rather than assets. To effectively provision 
cloud services so that there can be an achieved optimization of resources, federal 
agencies will have to link the benefits of cloud computing to their strategic plans.8 
6“Government-ready” cloud services refer to those that can satisfy a broad range of federal security 
and privacy requirements to include: statutory compliance, data security, protection of privacy-related 
information, integrity, access controls, and governance and security management.

In addition, federal agencies will also have to establish new governance processes 
and practices to ensure the adoption of secure cloud services adheres to the federal 
information security and privacy requirements.
NOTE
Importance of Federal IT Strategic Planning in the Adoption of Cloud Computing
Government-wide IT strategic planning for information and information technology 
management has been highlighted as a systematic challenge almost since federal agencies 
began using IT. As early as 1960,9 the US General Accounting Office (GAO)10 “ … call(ed) 
attention to the need for more positive central planning of a long-range nature within the 
executive branch of the government to promote the maximum degree of efficiency, 
economy, and effectiveness in the administration and management of costly automatic 
data processing facilities” [2].
However, it was not until 198011 that the management of federal IT authority was 
centralized within the federal government. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
was given government-wide responsibility to “oversee the use of information resources to 
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of governmental operations to serve agency 
missions” [3]. Federal agencies were also required to designate a senior agency official 
(also known as the Agency Chief Information Officer (CIO)) to be responsible for 
information resource management (IRM)12 at the department and agency level. As the 
government-wide IRM activities evolved, Agency CIOs were also given additional 
responsibilities in developing “strategic plans13 for all [departmental and agency] 
information and information technology management functions” [4].
IT Strategic Plans14 play an important role in the adoption of cloud computing 
specifically when planning the expected improvements in productivity, efficiency, and

Accounting Office was changed to the Government Accountability Office.

A Historical View of Federal IT
A HISTORICAL VIEW OF FEDERAL IT
In the Cloud Strategy, the federal IT environment was characterized as having “low 
asset utilization, a fragmented demand for resources, duplicative systems, environ­
ments which are difficult to manage, and long procurement lead times” [1]. This 
characterization was the result of an accumulation of issues stemming from years of 
mismanagement and the over-capitalization of IT.
In this section, we will focus on introducing several key historical points within 
the federal government where the adoption of IT produced trends that led to the 
growth in the federal IT budget. Figure 1.2 provides a high-level illustration that 
depicts how the federal government’s IT budget and portfolio changed with the tran­
sition to newer technologies.
Our review will begin with mainframe computing (a highly centralized envi­
ronment) and end with the federal government’s transition to mobility (a highly 
decentralized environment). For completeness, the review will also include a brief 
discussion of the evolution of federal IT laws and policies developed over time to 
manage issues across the federal government such as acquisition, governance, pri­
vacy, and security.

with Agency Strategic Plans15 that enable the development and monitoring of performance 
metrics used to evaluate the business value of cloud services. Therefore, the IT strategic 
planning process used by Agency CIOs will need to emphasize the establishment of criteria 
that are more focused on objectively and quantitatively measuring the benefits of the 
investment of cloud computing technologies across the department and agency.

one of the primary sources for most of the funding for the innovation and research in 
computing technology. In the early years, computers were very expensive, slow, inef­
ficient, and took up a sizeable footprint,18 making them impractical for use outside of 
the U.S. government or research facilities. Despite limitations, the U.S. government 
continued to finance the development and advancement of computer technologies. 
Originally, computers were only used for military applications.19 However, this ini­
tial investment would serve to establish the beginnings of an industry that would 
shape how the federal government would use and operate computers today.
The first digital computers20 used by the federal government before the 1950s 
were primarily used for scientific and defense purposes.21 Although from the late 
1940s to early 1950s the federal government’s interest began to change their focus on 
using computers to address broader business challenges. In 1951, the emergence of 
the UNIVersal Automatic Computer (UNIVAC) I22 created opportunities to use com­
puters for application outside of the US Department of Defense (DoD), and the UNI­
VAC became the first business computer purchased by the Bureau of the Census23 to 
be used for the population and economic censuses. During the remainder of the 
1950s, several other civilian federal agencies also began to acquire24 and use main­
frames to supplement and support mission-specific operations. Federal agencies saw 
these computers as a useful tool for improving the productivity of more resource-
intensive business support functions. For example, mainframes were used to more 
efficiently and accurately calculate tax returns (Internal Revenue Service), to calcu­
late social security benefits (Social Security Administration), and to generate labor 
statistics (US Department of Labor).
The federal government’s acquisition activity for computers began to increase 
significantly as the shift changed from using mainframes for basic business

support functions to more complex mission-specific applications.25 As a result, 
the federal government increased its purchasing of computers from 531 computers 
(or $464 million) in 1960 to over 5277 computers (or an estimated $4 to $6 bil­
lion26 in capital expenditures) in 1970 [5]. The significant increase in the com­
puter inventory was primarily the result of federal agencies having the purchasing 
power to procure resources needed to support their own individual needs and 
requirements.
As the federal government’s mainframe inventory grew, federal agencies began to 
face challenges associated with vendor and technology lock-in.27 As was customary 
in industry pricing practices at that time, software and engineering support services 
were bundled with the hardware [5]. This bundling resulted in federal agencies being 
locked into their mainframe vendors, making the migration between technologies a 
challenge because the manufacturer had full control over the entire stack, from the 
proprietary mainframe hardware platform to the software applications. In the 1980s, 
after the pricing practices began to change as major mainframe manufacturers started 
to unbundle the hardware, software, and engineering support services, the federal 
government was faced with a limited number of companies in the mainframe mar­
ket.28 This made it even more difficult for federal agencies to modernize their legacy 
applications.29
Shifting to Minicomputer
The advancement in hardware technology introduced the integrated circuit and the 
market evolved to midsized computers. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the federal 
government also began to shift away from using mainframes and began acquiring 
minicomputers. For the federal government, minicomputers provided a more effi­
cient improvement in central processing and “time sharing” capabilities offering a 
much lower cost and size, thereby enabling them to be more broadly available across 
the federal government. By 1974, as illustrated in Figure 1.3, more than fifty (50)

percent of the computers in the federal government cost less than $50,000 and the 
inventory exceeded 8600.
Minicomputers offered the federal government greater opportunities to use tech­
nology to increase productivity through the use of automation to lower economic 
costs in areas where repetitive activities were being performed manually. As an 
example, minicomputers were used by the National Weather Service to automate 
forecast offices [6], the Internal Revenue Service for electronically preparing indi­
vidual tax returns [7], the Federal Aviation Administration to automate air traffic 
control functions, and the US Department of Justice to automate legal information 
and retrieval [8].
Decentralization: The Microcomputer (“Personal Computer”)
By the mid-1970s, the emergence of the microcomputer decentralized computing 
and empowered end-users within the federal government. The significantly lower 
cost gave federal agencies the ability to extend microcomputers to a broader work­
force with hopes of improving productivity across the federal government. For exam­
ple, in 1983, the US General Services Administration (GSA) began opening Office 
of Technology Plus (OTP) stores (“GSA microcomputer stores”) to make it easier 
for federal agencies to procure microcomputers by streamlining the buying process.
FIGURE 1.3  Comparison of Computers Purchased Between 1967 and 1975 [6]

A Historical View of Federal IT
Microcomputer adoption continued to gain significant momentum in the mid-
1980s. By 1986, the federal government had amassed the largest inventory of 
computer equipment in the world, with a cumulative IT budget of over $60 bil­
lion between fiscal years 1982–1986.30 As illustrated in Figure 1.4, the govern­
ment-wide microcomputer inventory increased from 2307 in 1980 to 99,087 
in 1985.
The accelerated growth in the IT inventory was also challenged with an under­
developed information resource management (IRM) practice31 that began to 
impact the overall value and performance of the federal government’s return on its 
IT investment. The federal government saw impacts in areas such as the efficiency 
in delivering citizen services; maintaining the security and privacy of information 
stored in computerized form; and the quality of government IT management [2].

CHAPTER 1  Introduction to the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy
Transitioning to Mobility
Fast forwarding to today, the federal government operates in a more complex world 
that includes a mix of technologies. The emergence of different types of platforms 
(e.g., smartphones and tablet computers) offers the federal government new opportu­
nities to improve its efficiency, while at the same time it faces the challenge of ensur­
ing the security and privacy of vast amounts of digital information. With a broad 
array of mobile devices available, the federal government is starting to embrace the 
investment32 in mobility. The expansive adoption of technologies that enable mobil­
ity will require the federal government to confront potential new challenges relating 
to the management of these different devices, the supporting infrastructures, and the 
software applications. In addition, federal agencies will need to learn to manage the 
continued growth in mobile applications33 and services34 to optimize the efficient 
use of these technologies and make their “business case” for mobility.
Many federal agencies have already become accustomed to using mobile com­
puting devices (e.g., laptops) through their experience in teleworking.35 Federal 
agencies are also continuing to explore opportunities that would maximize the ben­
efits gained through the use of other mobile devices to enable them to operate more 
cost-effectively and efficiently. Therefore, as federal agencies make the transition to 
be more mobile36 and increase their usage of mobile computing devices, they will be 
required to be more proficient at both managing and securing different types of 
devices. This also means federal agencies will need to learn how to select, provision, 
and manage secure cloud services that will be leveraged as more information is 
moved into digital services so they can be accessed by endpoint devices anytime, 
anywhere.

A Historical View of Federal IT
Evolution of Federal IT Policy
In the previous section we briefly explored the history of IT adoption within the fed­
eral government from mainframes to mobility. In this section, the focus will include 
highlights of key federal IT laws and policies. Many of the laws and IT policies were 
developed to govern the general practices for using IT within the federal government; 
others addressed more specific topics such as security and privacy. Tables 1.1 and 1.2 
provide a detailed timeline of how the current IT policy framework evolved over time 
to address government-wide oversight and the management of IT-related issues and 
challenges. However, the policy framework established by Congress and the execu­
tive branch to control, oversee, and encourage the effective management and efficient 
use of IT was overtaken by the rapid pace at which new technology applications, 
issues, and opportunities were being generated or were not envisioned at the time of 
enactment or development of the policies [2].
The early adoption of IT was a significantly small portion of the annual budget in 
the 1960s. Therefore, purchasing power was performed in an isolated, decentralized 
manner, where each federal agency was given the flexibility to make its own buy­
ing decisions, including determining the types of technologies that were needed to 
meet its requirements. It was not until the mid-1960s that Congress took actions to 
improve the efficiency and effective use of IT across the federal government.
The enactment of the Brooks Act of 196537 was the first significant legislation 
focusing specifically on federal IT issues by establishing an oversight and manage­
ment structure. The Brooks Act38 outlined the major roles and responsibilities for the 
government-wide management of IT, which mostly operate under the same functions 
today (with an exception (*) noted):
• 
the US General Services Administration (GSA)* was given the authority and 
responsibility over the purchase, lease, maintenance, operation, and utilization 
of automated data processing (ADP) equipment;
• 
OMB was given the fiscal and policy control; and
• the Secretary of Commerce, through the National Bureau of Standards 
(NBS), now known as the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST), was directed with setting technical standards and guidelines.
The Brooks Act was established to reform federal IT by addressing three main issues: 
(1) competitiveness and “best value” through centralized government purchasing, (2) 
acquisition and IT management, and (3) common computing standards that would 
enable federal agencies to share information. In 1996, the enactment of the Informa­
tion Technology Management Reform Act (ITMRA) of 1996 (now known as the 
Clinger-Cohen Act) repealed the Brooks Act, effectively eliminating GSA’s role as the 
primary federal agency for setting policy and regulations for federal IT procurements. 
Instead, the Clinger-Cohen Act delegated this authority to the newly created role of the 
37Brooks Act. Available from: www.itl.nist.gov/History%20Documents/Brooks%20Act.pdf.

CHAPTER 1  Introduction to the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy
Agency CIO.39 In addition to the decisions of IT procurement, the Agency CIO was 
required to establish goals and report on efforts to reduce costs and increase efficiency 
through improved information management [9]. In 2011,40 the role of the Agency CIO 
was further expanded to include four additional areas: governance (IT investment 
review and portfolio management), commodity IT (IT infrastructure, enterprise-wide 
IT systems, and business support systems), program management (IT program man­
agement resource identification, and hiring), and information security (direct or dele­
gated authority and primary responsibility). The Federal CIO Council41 was also 
established in 199642 to provide a central focal point for coordinating issues across the 
federal government and to make recommendations for IT management policies.
Today, multiple federal laws and government-wide policies provide the foundation 
for the federal IT policy framework used to manage and control IT issues within the 
federal government. The IT policy framework consists primarily of four main sources:
1.	 Federal statutes, written and enacted by Congress to address major IT issues;
2.	 Government-wide executive directives and mandates issued by the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) to guide implementation of federal statutes;
3.	 Department or agency IT-level policies that address department or agency-
specific needs and requirements; and
4.	 IT policies that reflect the requirements of a specific community of interest 
(COI).43
Through this policy framework the government-wide governance manages IT-
related issues such as information security, capital planning and investment manage­
ment, IT strategic planning, enterprise architecture, privacy, records management 
and retention, and information use (e.g., dissemination, collection, and disclosure).

Cloud Computing: Drivers in Federal IT Transformation
CLOUD COMPUTING: DRIVERS IN FEDERAL IT 
TRANSFORMATION
The federal IT environment is transforming. As discussed previously, the Cloud 
Strategy set forth the strategic direction for approaching the adoption of cloud ser­
vices. However for this cloud transformation to be successful and long-lasting, cul­
tural changes will need to occur to overcome potential resistance of cloud adoption 
due to obstacles and to establish mitigations to address security and privacy concerns 
and other challenges that impede44 the realization of the benefits of cloud solutions. 
The institution of the federal government’s culture towards IT needs to be oriented to 
considering IT as a service. Through a collaborative partnership between the federal 
government and industry, the investment in changing individual federal agency busi­
ness processes will serve as an accelerator in the transformational drivers to improve 
federal IT. In addition to a change in mindset, Agency CIOs responsible for develop­
ing IT strategic plans need to be cultivated to think of cloud services as increasing the 
efficiency and effectiveness that enable them to address their strategic objectives, 
goals, and performance measures.
44From Badger, L., Bernstein, D., Bohn, R., de Vaulx, F., Hogan, M., Mao, J., et al. NIST Special 
Publication (SP) 500-293 (Draft) US Government Cloud Computing Technology Roadmap, Volume 
I Release 1.0. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2011. The US Government 
Cloud Computing Technology Roadmap was developed to foster adoption of cloud computing, improv-
ing information made available to decision makers, and facilitate development in the cloud computing 
model.
WARNING
One can easily justify how cloud services, if appropriately planned and integrated, could 
present potential benefits for cost-savings and improve federal IT by maximizing efficiency, 
improving agility, and enabling innovation. Through the right mixture of cloud computing 
services, the federal government’s IT investment portfolios can achieve better optimization. 
However, the adoption of cloud computing technologies will likely face ongoing 
impediments45 as “there continues to be a need for a more thorough understanding of the 
cloud’s deployment models, unique security implications, and data management 
challenges” [10]. Example impediments could include:
• Cultural resistance.
• Security and privacy concerns.
• Network access, availability, and resiliency limitations.
• Data portability and standardization.
• Liability and regulations.
Therefore, federal agencies will continue to carefully navigate these challenges to 
ensure there is a limited impact to their mission and business.

CHAPTER 1  Introduction to the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy
Drivers for Adoption
Before proceeding with a discussion of the potential benefits offered to the federal 
government through the use of cloud computing, it is essential that we gain some 
basic understanding of some of the possible drivers for cloud adoption. As previously 
highlighted, the Cloud Strategy characterized the federal government’s IT environ­
ment as: low asset utilization, fragmented demand and duplicative systems, environ­
ments which are difficult to manage, and long procurement lead times [1]. This 
characterization was largely the result of the way the federal government has acquired 
and operated over the years in independent silos.46 “Federal IT change efforts are 
typically managed in isolation from business operations, so those working on long-
term solutions are too often not concerned with, or even aware of, the evolution of 
day-to-day business considerations” [11]. These silos have led to the continued 
decentralization of the federal IT environment, mostly because the federal agencies 
have developed overlapping, duplicative, and, in many instances, fragmented pro­
grams that are not always shared across the federal government or community 
boundaries. However, these are not necessarily new issues. The scope of federal IT 
may have changed (i.e., size and complexity of programs, services, and systems), but 
46A self-contained organizational structure that can operate independent of others within the larger 
organization.
NOTE
• In May 2002, OMB identified ten potentially redundant systems across the federal 
government that related to the rule making process.47 As a result, OMB focused on 
“consolidating redundant IT systems relating to the President’s on-line rulemaking 
initiative” [12].
• The GAO reported in May 2004, “the duplicative and stovepiped nature of DOD’s [US 
Department of Defense] systems environment is illustrated by the numerous systems 
it has in the same functional areas. For example, DOD reported that it has over 200 
inventory systems. These systems are not integrated and thus have multiple points of 
data entry, which can result in data integrity problems” [13].
• In a March 2011 GAO report, “Opportunities to Reduce Potential Duplication in 
Government Programs, Save Tax Dollars, and Enhance Revenue,” the GAO “identified 
81 areas for consideration—34 areas of potential duplication, overlap, or fragmentation 
as well as 47 additional cost-saving and revenue-enhancing areas” [14]. Although not 
all specifically related to the duplication of IT resources, since IT plays a critical role in 
supporting most government programs and mission-specific operations, many areas of 
duplication would include the underlying IT capabilities.

Cloud Computing: Drivers in Federal IT Transformation
the lack of strategic alignment and functional integration48 between federal agencies 
has existed long before the Cloud Strategy. This misalignment has led to expensive 
and overly redundant development and maintenance costs. Across the federal gov­
ernment, multiple instances of similar shared services49 have been developed, IT 
48From Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The Common Approach to Federal Enterprise 
Architecture. Washington, DC: Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget; 
2012. “Functional integration means interoperability between programs, systems, and services, which 
requires a meta-context and standards to be successful.”
49From VanRoekel, S. Federal Information Technology Shared Services Strategy. Washington, DC: 
Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget; 2012. “The Federal Information 
Technology Shared Services Strategy provides organizations in the Executive Branch of the United 
States Federal Government (Federal Agencies) with policy guidance on the full range and lifecycle of 
intra- and inter-agency information technology (IT) shared services, which enable mission, adminis-
trative, and infrastructure-related IT functions.”
NOTE
On January 14, 2010, the White House held “The Forum on Modernizing Government” 
where the forum noted the following conclusion:
The Federal Government has difficulty managing large-scale technology efforts. 
The Forum made it clear that there are best practices in industry for the design 
and ongoing review of these types of technology efforts that increase their 
likelihood of success. By comparison to these industry best practices, most Federal 
Government IT projects are too large and not sufficiently integrated into business 
unit operations. Multi-year Federal IT efforts are typically driven by technology 
managers—who often turn over during the life of the project—rather than agency 
business leaders. Agency business leaders are not held accountable for project 
success, and in turn do not adequately invest in IT project management. As a 
result, in comparison to industry best practices, Federal IT projects are too often 
marked by milestones spaced too far apart and deliverables that fail to deliver 
tangible end-user value [16].
NOTE
It is important to note, the challenges within the federal IT were not created overnight. 
GAO, OMB, and other organizations within the federal government have repeatedly 
highlighted weaknesses in required federal IT processes and controls to address IT reform 
challenges, and the ineffective government-wide and federal-agency-specific IT oversight 
and management. As early as 2000, the GAO highlighted OMB’s role as being “responsible 
for providing direction on government-wide information resources and technology 
management and overseeing agency activities in these areas, including analyzing major 
agency information technology investments” [18]. Although not limiting the governance 
over IT investments within each federal agency, a central focal point was noted as lacking 
to serve as this catalyst, working in conjunction with other executive officials to ensure 
that information resources and technology management issues were addressed within the 
context of the government’s highest priorities and not in isolation from them [18].

22
CHAPTER 1  Introduction to the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy
modernization efforts have been independently executed, and information security 
programs have been operated with little or no intra- and inter-agency coordination.
The duplication, coupled with the low utilization of IT resources, has continued 
to increase federal IT costs. Federal agencies (and even program management 
offices) have worked independently to procure new hardware to satisfy their need 
for additional capacity, rather than optimizing the existing IT resources, either 
across an agency or between multiple agencies (for multi-agency programs). As an 
example, in 2010, as an output of the initial findings of the Federal Data Center 
Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI),50 average server utilization rates were noted as 
low as 7% [15]. The absence of an effective IT management structure within the 
federal government has led to this underutilization of computing and storage 
resources. In the course of the initial phases of the FDCCI project, metrics similar 
to those included in Figure 1.5 were established to assist federal agencies in making 
more informed IT management decisions for improving utilization within their con­
solidation plans.51
Another potential driver that is related to adoption of cloud computing includes 
issues associated with the IT acquisition process. Federal IT acquisition has been 
stagnant and largely unchanged for years. For example, in 1995, the GAO conducted 
a statistical analysis of the time taken to complete an IT acquisition, and noted that 
the time can vary depending on the dollar value, procurement type, and whether a bid 
protest was filed [17]. These same challenges still exist today.
50From Kundra, V. The Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative. Washington, DC: Executive 
Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget; 2011. “The FDCCI seeks to curb this 
unsustainable increase in the number of data centers by reducing the cost of data center hardware, 
software, and operations; shifting IT investments to more efficient computing platforms; promoting the 
use of Green IT by reducing the overall energy and real estate footprint of government data centers; 
and increasing the IT security posture of the government.”

23
Cloud Computing: Drivers in Federal IT Transformation
The continued delays in streamlining the acquisition process have limited the 
potential benefits in the investment of IT. However, streamlining the acquisition pro­
cess is not enough. Federal agencies will need to make improvements in their federal 
IT management practices to learn how to effectively leverage the cost-savings pro­
vided by technologies such as virtualization and cloud computing and make changes 
to their practices to accommodate acquiring IT as a Service.52
Cloud Benefits
The Cloud Strategy offered the following key benefits to improved operational effi­
ciency, agility, and innovation through the use of cloud computing.
• 
Efficiency—better use of existing resources through a service-based model with 
a focus on improving utilization and to use technologies that would reduce 
duplicative services across the federal government.
• 
Agility—ability to deliver service faster and provision new resources based 
on the federal agencies’ prioritization. For example, existing services that 
require long lead times to upgrade or increase/decrease capacity would receive 
high priority over services that are easier to upgrade, not sensitive to demand 
fluctuations, or unlikely to need upgrade in the longer term [19].
• 
Innovation—more access to innovation delivered through private sector 
services.
A summarization of the benefits provided in Table 1.3 describes how dif­
ferent characteristics of the federal IT environment can be improved through 
cloud adoption. Through these improvements, the Cloud Strategy suggested 
federal agencies could benefit because they could redirect their “focus on 
mission-critical tasks instead of purchasing, configuring and maintaining redundant 
infrastructure” [19].
The 25 Point Implementation Plan to Reform Federal Information Technology 
Management highlighted similar benefits offered through the adoption of cloud com­
puting, through a service-based model as:
• 
Economical: Pay-as-you go approach to IT offers a lower initial investment, 
while allowing the ability to add investments as system usage increases [19].
• 
Flexible: Fluctuations in user demand and capacity can be added or subtracted 
without acquiring additional hardware and software [19].
• 
Fast: Long procurement times can be eliminated, while also enabling access to 
a continuously growing selection of services [19].
52In February 2012, the Federal CIO Council and the Chief Acquisition Officers Council in coordina-
tion with the Federal Cloud Compliance Committee published the best practices to assist federal agen-
cies in acquiring cloud services. Available from: http://www.cio.gov/cloudbestpractices.pdf.

24
CHAPTER 1  Introduction to the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy
However, to achieve sustainable benefits, the federal government will require 
more than just adopting new services and technologies. Federal stakeholders will 
need to commit to long-term transformational change in both the federal IT environ­
ment and culture.
Cloud computing reinvents the federal government’s IT business model, from 
capital expenditures (CAPEX) to operational expenditures (OPEX). With any sig­
nificant change in business operations, there is an upfront cost required to support 
IT transformation. Federal agencies will need to understand that these costs may 
not be recaptured immediately, and will likely have to wait months, if not years, 
before savings are fully realized. Therefore, the benefits previously described will 
need to be weighed against the maturity of current federal IT processes and prac­
tices already established to determine if changes need to be made. Federal agencies 
will need to ensure the transformation benefits match their expectation of improved 
operational efficiency, resource optimization (e.g., data center real estate, compute, 
storage, etc.), and increased security through the delivery of IT as a service, some­
thing that will require change in the way the federal government plans for IT.

Decision Framework for Cloud Migration
Improving Efficiency
The transition to cloud services is more than a change in technology delivery models. 
It is also a shift in the focus from a federal government driven by IT asset ownership to 
service management. By exploiting the benefits of on-demand resource provisioning, 
federal agencies can learn to better understand their capacity requirements by scal­
ing their usage, thereby improving overall utilization. Compared to fragmented and 
duplicative IT environments created by the investment in heterogeneous infrastruc­
tures in data centers across the country and around the world, the federal government 
can leverage cloud computing capability as a means to enable them to efficiently con­
solidate, transitioning the total cost of ownership (TCO) of data centers and offering 
the ability to repurpose the savings to support their mission and business.
Improving Agility
Agility in cloud computing provides federal agencies with the capability to rapidly 
provision/de-provision resources (e.g., compute, storage) as changes occur in their 
business requirements, making them more responsive and provides an opportunity to 
focus on identifying sources for improving their overall agency performance.53
Improving Innovation
Federal agencies have operated in a mode that has focused on avoidance of risk, 
rather than managing risk. This has largely kept the federal government from inno­
vating at a pace similar to the private sector. Cloud adoption will enable federal 
agencies to become more innovative through better service delivery by leveraging 
existing cloud services and emerging technologies that would increase their opera­
tional effectiveness.
DECISION FRAMEWORK FOR CLOUD MIGRATION
The Cloud Strategy presented a three-step structured framework. As depicted in 
Table 1.4, federal agencies can use the tool for assisting them when considering the 
migration to cloud services. As previously discussed, cloud transformation requires 
a shift in mindset. Federal agencies have been cultured to manage assets because it 
enables them to have more control over their IT infrastructure. The shift in mindset 
to managing IT as a service will require federal agencies to rely more on CSPs, a 
significant first challenge to overcome in cloud transformation.
53The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) 
focuses improving performance and management to include information technology. Available from:

CHAPTER 1  Introduction to the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy
Throughout the remainder of this section, we will briefly discuss each of the steps 
in the decision framework to demonstrate how they can be applied to a “Federal 
Agency” (a generic reference to a federal agency cloud service customer).54
Selecting Services to Move to the Cloud
First the “Federal Agency” needs to decide if it is ready to migrate to the cloud. In 
addition to the “Federal Agency” readiness, the Cloud Strategy identified several 
factors when performing a risk-based55 evaluation of the readiness of CSPs as a 
preliminary activity to considering cloud services such as security requirements, 
service characteristics, market characteristics, network infrastructure, application 
and data, government readiness, and technology lifecycle [1]. After the “Federal 
Agency” has decided it is ready to migrate some of its services to the cloud, the next

important question is: “What services to move?” This determination calls for a full 
understanding of its IT investment portfolio and risk tolerance, among other things. 
Preliminary activities may include the “Federal Agency” CIO in collaboration with 
other key stakeholders to establish a clear set of criteria that will be used as a part of 
evaluating CSPs. Part of this process may include “identifying security, privacy, or 
other requirements for cloud services to meet, as a criterion for the selection of a 
cloud provider” [20].
Next, the “Federal Agency” should conduct a full evaluation of the current IT 
portfolio for potential services that are candidates to be included in its cloud adoption 
roadmap and plans. The services might be prioritized based on the “expected values” 
and “cloud readiness.” Since the federal government tends to operate with a predomi­
nately risk-adverse mindset, the “Federal Agency” may need to develop additional 
metrics. These metrics could be used to measure the expected value by the “Federal 
Agency,” and the readiness of both the “Federal Agency” and CSPs (commercial or 
federal government). By evaluating short- and long-term benefits (i.e., efficiency, 
agility, and innovation) the “Federal Agency” can seek to properly align its migration 
planning with its governance and risk management functions that place an empha­
sis on identifying mitigations that would assist the “Federal Agency” in minimizing 
potential risks during the migration process.
Provisioning Cloud Services Effectively
The federal government has had a history of “IT outsourcing.” However, most IT 
outsourcing has been conducted by a “single” federal agency or multiple federal 
agencies through a joint program management office (PMO) using traditional pro­
curement methods to contract services from providers to build and host services, 
applications, and information. In these types of outsourcing arrangements, the fed­
eral government mostly maintained control over IT assets and their information. By 
purchasing IT “on-demand,” unique requirements may arise that federal agencies 
will need to address when contracting with CSPs [21]. Therefore, provisioning cloud 
services will require a change in the “Federal Agency” acquisition processes and 
practices. This new model of provisioning IT service will also enable the “Federal 
Agency” to be more cost-effective by pooling together the purchasing power through 
an aggregation of demand to the greatest extent possible before migrating services 
to the cloud [1].
Additionally, the Cloud Strategy outlined several other considerations [1] the 
“Federal Agency” should consider to reduce the risk associated with migrating to the 
cloud and to maximize efficiency such as:
• 
Integration of the IT service into the IT portfolio and functions that support 
business processes.
• 
Effective implementation of contract provisions that ensure portability and 
encourage competition (limit vendor lock-in); explicitly include service level 
agreements (SLAs) for security, continuity of operations, and service quality

based on specific agency needs; and specific metrics that clearly state how and 
when they will be collected.
• 
Realizing the value through the appropriate use of cloud services through the 
decommissioning and release of assets used to support legacy applications and 
servers.
Managing Services Rather Than Assets
When the “Federal Agency” has successfully migrated to the cloud, differences 
may exist in the relationship between the “Federal Agency” and the CSP, which 
will require adopting new governance processes. The “Federal Agency” will need 
to ensure it can effectively manage SLAs based on the metrics defined previously as 
part of cloud service selection activity. “SLAs should clearly define how performance 
is guaranteed (such as response time resolution/mitigation time, availability, etc.) and 
require CSPs to monitor their service levels, provide timely notification of a failure 
to meet the SLAs, and evidence that problems have been resolved or mitigated” [21]. 
SLA monitoring will also require the “Federal Agency” to actively evaluate the met­
rics to ensure they are enforced and usage charges are accurate. Since portability, 
interoperability, and security are key requirements for cloud service selection, the 
“Federal Agency” can periodically re-evaluate the market to identify opportunities 
that maximize capabilities offered by changes in technologies, new cloud services, 
and private-sector innovations.
SUMMARY
In this chapter a brief overview of the Cloud Strategy was presented to highlight 
the key drivers for the federal government’s adoption of cloud computing. In addi­
tion, the introduction provides CSPs with a basic understanding of how the strat­
egy may be used by federal agencies considering cloud services as an extension of 
their IT portfolio. We briefly reviewed the history of federal IT with the purpose 
of understanding the potential challenges that may be a force behind the cloud 
adoption. We also discussed the key drivers for federal IT transformation and the 
expected benefits received through cloud computing. Lastly, a brief examination 
of the three-step decision framework offered insight into its application for cloud 
migration.

INTRODUCTION
Standardization can be characterized as the process by which new standards are 
developed or new products are brought to market implementing standards. A stan­
dard (or technical standard) can be classified differently and published by many dif­
ferent organizations. In Table 2.1 the generally accepted definitions are provided for 
what constitutes a standard for use by the US government.
Standards play a critical role for cloud adoption, both by the federal government1 
and the private sector. As we will discuss later in this chapter, the federal government 
has a unique responsibility to ensure voluntary consensus standards are adopted in 
lieu of government-unique standards.
The Federal Cloud Computing Strategy identified the importance of standards 
development to ensure the federal government’s adoption and effective use of cloud 
computing and related technologies is supported by broad standardization. For fed­
eral agencies to leverage the capabilities and achieve the benefits offered by cloud 
computing, as described Chapter 1, the development of standards will need to focus

on three major areas2: interoperability,3 portability,4 and security.5 For example, 
standards “ensure clouds have an interoperable platform so that services provided by 
different providers can work together, regardless of whether they are provided using 
public, private, community, or a hybrid delivery model” [3].
To support the interests of the federal government, NIST was charged with pro­
viding technical guidance and support in the standards development efforts relating 
to cloud computing. The NIST Cloud Computing Program,6 through the Cloud Com­
puting Standards Roadmap Working Group,7 focused on the development and 
­maintenance of a Cloud Computing Standards Roadmap8 that bolstered the federal 
government’s ability to adopt cloud computing. In addition, NIST was also 
­responsible for directing and managing the strategic and tactical programs to ensure 
standards that already existed or are in development are integrated into the US 
2The first edition of the NIST Cloud Computing Standards identified expanded consideration in other 
areas such as maintainability, usability, reliability, and resiliency.

management, governance, and compliance.

Introduction
government’s Cloud Computing Technology Roadmap.9 For the roadmap to be suc­
cessful, NIST’s participation was important to ensure standards development sup­
ported acceleration by the private sector that would implement those new standards 
in products and services that could be procured by federal agencies.
Cloud computing is supported by many existing and emerging standards. 
Although not all of them were specifically developed with cloud computing in mind, 
many of them do directly support cloud services delivery. NIST and many leading 
industry groups and associations10 have focused on identifying the technology 
­standards gaps for the development of cloud-specific standards, including broad 
­standardization. When a significant gap within standards exists, standards organiza­
tions, industry groups, and the cloud communities are faced with the challenge of 
coordinating their efforts to ensure interoperability between standards and to limit 
the impact associated with too many standards.11 For example, overlapping and 
duplicative standards efforts may attempt to solve the same problem, inadvertently 
causing competition for the “best” standard to fill the gaps. Therefore, standards 
convergence is important to ensure standards are developed to address the need for 
compatibility.

NOTE
NIST [4] defined Cloud Computing Deployment Models as:
• Private cloud—the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single 
organization comprising multiple consumers (e.g., business units). It may be owned, 
managed, and operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination of 
them, and it may exist on or off premises.
• Community cloud—the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a 
specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., 
mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be 
owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, 
a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.
• Public cloud—the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general 
public. It may be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or 
government organization, or some combination of them. It exists on the premises of the 
cloud provider.
• Hybrid cloud—the cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud 
infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities, but are 
bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and 
application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds).

CHAPTER 2  Cloud Computing Standards
STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT PRIMER
Standards development organizations (SDOs) typically have a process they follow for 
developing standards. As an example, the International Organization for Standardiza­
tion (ISO)12 follows a six-step standards development process13 that includes: pro­
posal, preparatory, committee, enquiry, approval, and publication. In Figure 2.1, the 
NIST Cloud Computing Standards Roadmap provided a “high-level conceptualization 
of how IT standards are developed and standards-based IT products, processes, and 
services are deployed” [1]. Although only exemplary, the lifecycle does offer a useful 
reference to understand the workflow within the standards development process as it 
relates to standards maturity and market adoption into products and services.
The US standardization system is based on a set of globally accepted principles 
for standards development [5]. Voluntary consensus is a critical part of this standard­
ization system. A consensus-based process ensures standards meet the needs of both 
public and private sector14 stakeholders before being finalized. The federal govern­
ment’s adoption of standards needs to be consistent with the objectives of the Techni­
cal Barrier to Trade (TBT)15 Committee. By leveraging an “international” focused 
set of principles such as transparency, openness, and consensus, the federal govern­
ment can ensure that standards development increases the likelihood of standardiza­
tion in cloud computing.
As standards mature and broader market acceptance begins to see more participants, 
an emphasis will need to be placed on ensuring products and services are conform­
ing to the standards and requirements for implementation. Therefore, standardization 
requires a process known as conformity assessment, to demonstrate “that products, 
processes, systems, services or personnel fulfill the requirements that are identified in 
a specified standard. Conformity assessment forms a vital link between standards that 
define product characteristics or requirements and the products themselves” [5].
The conformity assessment process provides both the federal government and 
industry with the confidence that a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) has implemented 
standards that meet the interoperability, portability, and security requirements 
necessary to maximize the benefit offered by cloud computing. It also provides a

framework for CSPs to use when assessing their own products and services against 
standards, potentially making them more competitive within industry based on con­
sumer requirements for specific standards.
TIP
Standards adoption is an evolutionary process. Throughout the process, standards grow in 
both acceptance and maturity, and it could take years for standards to mature. Most 
standards can be generally classified as one (or more) of the following types at some point 
within the standards development lifecycle.16
• Open standards are open to anyone to participate in developing and implementing 
(e.g., royalty-free).
• Proprietary specifications are privately developed and are usually licensed for 
implementation. Sometimes, although not always, once they receive enough industry 
acceptance, they evolve into de facto standards.
• De facto standards are considered industry norms through broad adoption and “in 
practice” application. They have gained acceptance and are therefore expected rather 
than required to be part of a product roadmap.
• De jure standards are formalized through a standards body, thereby making them widely 
approved because of their formal acceptance.
16Sometimes standards maintain their status as either “de facto” or “de jure” throughout their entire 
lifetime.

CHAPTER 2  Cloud Computing Standards
CLOUD COMPUTING STANDARDIZATION DRIVERS
The key driver for the federal government in supporting the standardization of cloud 
solutions is to address security, portability, and interoperability requirements. For 
example, without commonly implemented standards addressing interoperability and 
portability, federal agencies may be required to make significant changes to their 
software or adapt their code to work within a specific cloud service environment 
through proprietary Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).17 This potentially 
could increase the cost of migrating between CSPs, creating a scenario that may 
become a barrier for a particular federal agency that has a concern about being locked 
into a specific cloud service.
Many standards used in cloud computing are a convergence of existing standards. 
As cloud computing technologies mature, consensus within the industry will begin to 
establish new standards specifically developed for cloud environments. The NIST 
Standards Acceleration to Jumpstart Adoption of Cloud Computing (SAJACC)18 ini­
tiative was established to support the acceleration of adopting these new standards by 
developing tests that show the extent to which specific use cases can be supported by 
cloud systems through a set of documented and public cloud system specifications [6].
Federal Laws and Policy
The federal government is directly concerned with setting and implementing stan­
dards through legislation, regulation, or contractual obligations for sales to govern­
ment purchasers [7]. In its roles, supporting standards development accelerates the 
broader adoption of cloud computing within the federal government and also assists 
federal agencies in satisfying their responsibility under federal laws and policies. 
This responsibility requires them to use voluntary consensus standards, where practi­
cal, in their procurement activities.
Trade Agreements Act (TAA)
The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (TAA)19 governs trade agreements negotiated 
with other countries. Under the TAA, federal agencies are prohibited from engaging 
“in any standards-related activity that creates unnecessary obstacles to the foreign 
commerce of the United States” [8] and are required to consider international stan­
dards. However, the TAA also could prohibit data housed in cloud computing servers

and storage devices reside within the countries20 not covered under the Act.21 NIST 
supports the implementation of the TAA, including educating federal, state, and local 
governments on the fundamentals of standards, conformity assessment, and technical 
regulations.
National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA)
The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (NTTAA) estab­
lished a requirement that federal agencies use technical standards that are developed 
or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies and participate with such bodies 
in the development of technical standards [9]. NIST, through the Standards Coordi­
nation Office (SCO),22 directly supported the requirement of the NTTAA by coordi­
nating within the federal government, and state and local governments, the adoption 
of voluntarily developed standards.
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-119
The OMB Circular A-119 “directs agencies to use voluntary consensus standards in 
lieu of government-unique standards except where inconsistent with law or other­
wise impractical” [10]. The circular focused on minimizing the reliance on unique 
government standards. Consistent with the requirements of OMB Circular A-119, 
the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy established requirements for a cooperative 
effort between public and private sector organizations for the development of stan­
dards that would enable the federal government to securely adopt cloud computing 
technologies.
America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010
The America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Tech­
nology, Education, and Science (COMPETES) Act directs NIST to collaborate with 
industry in the development of standards supporting trusted cloud computing infra­
structures, metrics, interoperability, and assurance; and support standards develop­
ment with the intent of supporting common goals [11]. In addition, the National 
Science Foundation (NSF) was directed to “support a national research agenda in 
key areas affected by the increased use of public and private cloud computing” [11].
Adoption Barriers
Cloud computing as defined by NIST is “a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, 
on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g. 
networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned

and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction” [12]. 
With different cloud deployment and service models available (including derivatives 
classifications), standards development is an essential part of ensuring the federal 
agencies’ adoption of cloud computing technologies is not hindered by potential bar­
riers such as poorly defined, or a lack of market acceptance of, standards. These 
barriers limit federal agencies from maximizing their cost-savings through the use 
of cloud services, impacting their ability to deliver results and produce opportunities 
for value creation.
As cloud computing matures, open and proprietary standards will co-exist within 
the cloud computing ecosystem. As illustrated in Figure 2.2, usage scenarios driving 
Cloud Computing Standards development will be different at each of the service lay­
ers (i.e., data portability at the Software as a Service layer and VM portability at the 
Infrastructure as a Service layer).
The requirements for each of the usage scenarios will need to support well-
defined and documented standards or specifications to ensure the federal govern­
ment’s interoperability, portability, and security requirements can be satisfied.
TIP
The Federal Cloud Computing Strategy highlighted the need for federal agencies to 
consider the market characteristic (i.e., the competitiveness and maturity) for selecting 
services as part of their decision process for moving to the cloud. The strategy stated that 
“agencies should consider the availability of technical standards for cloud interfaces which 
reduce the risk of vendor lock-in” [3]. It also highlighted the important of considering, 
in addition to security, the interoperability and portability requirements as an aspect to 
address in the development of contracts to procure cloud services.

Identifying Standards for Federal Cloud Computing Adoption 
IDENTIFYING STANDARDS FOR FEDERAL CLOUD 
COMPUTING ADOPTION
The NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture Working Group generated a 
consensus conceptual reference model. The conceptual reference model, illustrated 
in Figure 2.3, provides a “high-level” model to assist in understanding, discussing, 
categorizing, and comparing cloud services to communicate and analyze security,23 
interoperability,24 and portability25 candidate standards and reference implementa­
tions [13].
In addition, the Conceptual Reference Model provides a useful tool for mapping 
and a common frame of reference for identifying the standards that will be required to 
facilitate adoption. By understanding the underlying business or technical use cases,26 
specific emphasis can be placed on those areas where gaps in standards exist based on 
the cross-cutting requirements. Federal agencies, as a cloud computing actor,27 
are the most likely sources for usage scenarios and for identifying requirements. 
23Examples include authentication and authorization, confidentiality, integrity, and identity and access 
management.
24Examples include the interoperability of services through the service management (consumer APIs) 
and functional interfaces.
25Examples include data and workload portability.

CHAPTER 2  Cloud Computing Standards
Federal  agencies’ participation in the standards development process helps in the 
­acceleration of the development and use of Cloud Computing Standards and standards-
based products, processes, and services [14]. 
Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) 
and Other Community-Driven Organizations
Standards development for cloud computing requires the active involvement of 
multiple standards bodies. Standards bodies are standards setting organizations that 
usually consist of stakeholders such as organizations or companies that produce tech­
nical standards to address the market’s needs for standardization. Table 2.2 lists some 
of the international and national standards bodies involved in developing cloud com­
puting standards.
Standards Inventory
Standards for cloud computing will continue to evolve, mature, and gain acceptance. 
This chapter does not attempt to provide a comprehensive catalog of standards sup­
porting cloud computing, as harmonization of standards could take many years. 
Instead, it attempts to address the importance for cloud standards to promote open­
ness and flexibility of choice by the federal government, while also supporting the 
minimum requirements of interoperability, portability, and security. This requires a 
focus on continued development of cloud computing use cases to anticipate where 
cloud technologies will be used, so that standards organizations, industry groups, 
and associations can coordinate their efforts to define existing standards, and identify 
where new standards will need to be developed.
The US Government Cloud Computing Technology Roadmap28 required the 
development of a Cloud Computing Standards Roadmap for prioritizing standards 
developed to support the federal government’s interoperability, portability, and secu­
rity requirements. As part of the Cloud Computing Standards Roadmap develop­
ment, the NIST Cloud Computing Standards Roadmap Working Group conducted a 
survey, included in Tables 2.3–2.5, to identify existing industry standards. The results 
included an inventory of standards that provides a starting point for mapping to

CHAPTER 2  Cloud Computing Standards
SUMMARY
This chapter provided an overview of the standards activities and the importance of 
standards development to the adoption of cloud computing within the federal gov­
ernment. By briefly reviewing the standards development process, we can begin to 
characterize standards supporting cloud computing and their maturity based on the 
evolutionary standards life cycle. We then discussed the federal legislative and policy 
drivers that address the federal government’s role in supporting standards activities 
and the drivers affecting cloud computing adoption. We concluded our discussion by 
looking at the NIST Conceptual Reference Model and how the reference architecture 
can be used to facilitate the identification of standards that would meet specific usage 
scenarios.

INFORMATION IN THIS CHAPTER:
•	 Introduction
•	 Open Source and the Federal Government
•	 OSS Adoption Challenges: Acquisition and Security
•	 OSS and Federal Cloud Computing
INTRODUCTION
There has been a continued growth in the use of open source software or OSS1 and 
cloud computing, both in the public and private sector. In this chapter, we will focus 
our discussion on the impact of OSS and the federal government’s adoption of cloud 
computing technologies. Both cloud computing and OSS2 individually offer poten­
tial benefits for federal agencies to improve their efficiency, agility, and innovation, 
by enabling them to be more responsive to new or changing requirements in their 
missions. OSS improves the way the federal government develops and also ­distributes 
software and provides an opportunity to reduce costs through the reuse of existing 
source code, whereas cloud computing improves the utilization of resources and 
enables a faster service delivery. This chapter does not attempt to differentiate OSS 
from proprietary software, but instead focuses on highlighting the importance in the 
federal government’s experience with OSS in the adoption of cloud computing.3

US Department of Defense; 2009. “Open software is software for which the human-readable source 
code is available for use, study, reuse, modification, enhancement, and redistribution by the users of 
that software.”

fish), databases (MySQLP, PostgreSQL), applications (Firefox, Thunderbird), and programming lan-
guages (Perl, Python, PHP).

CHAPTER 3  A Case for Open Source
Over the years, the private sector4 had encouraged the federal government to 
consider OSS by making a case for open source options. Many federal agencies have 
approached OSS with cautious interest because of challenges and concerns associ­
ated with its adoption. For example, transition costs, limited or in consistent skillset 
for open source software developers within the federal workforce, a lack of knowl­
edge regarding procurement or licensing, and the misinterpretation of acquisition 
and security policies and ­guidance are some of the challenges and concerns that have 
limited a broader-scale adoption. However, some federal agencies have directly or 
indirectly made considerations for OSS as a viable enterprise-wide ­alternative to 
proprietary commercial off the shelf (COTS) software.
Interoperability, portability, and security standards6 have already been identified7 
as critical barriers for cloud adoption by the federal government. OSS facilitates sup­
porting standards development through the “shared” development and industry 
implementation of open standards.8 In some instances, the federal government’s 
experience with standards development had enabled the broader adoption and use of 
open standards–based, open source technologies and platforms.9 The primarily driver

ernment about the benefits of open source software. Available from: http://opensourceforamerica.org/.
6Standards were discussed in detail in Chapter 2, Cloud Computing Standards.
7From Kundra, V. Federal Cloud Computing Strategy. Washington, DC: Executive Office of the President, 
Office of Management and Budget; 2011. Standards will be critical for the successful adoption and delivery 
of cloud computing, both within the public sector and more broadly. Standards are also critical to ensure 
clouds have an interoperable platform so that services provided by different providers can work together, 
regardless of whether they are provided using public, private, community, or a hybrid delivery model.
8Open standards, in general terms, is a technical specification which is developed openly (participation 
and publication) and is vendor neutral with limited cost (or free availability) to implementers.
9Examples include GSA’s Apps.gov. Available from: https://www.apps.gov/cloud/cloud/category_
home.do?&c=SA.
NOTE
Example cases where OSS was identified as a viable option to support federal government 
programs:
• In May 2011, the US Department of Veterans Affair (VA) CIO stated to avoid costs, and 
to find a way to involve the private sector in modernizing Veterans Integrated System 
Technology Architecture (VistA; electronic medical records system), the VA turned to 
open source [1]. In response, the VA launched the Open Source Electronic Health 
Record Agent (OSEHRA) in August 2012 “as a central governing body of a new open 
source Electronic Health Record (EHR) community” [2].
• In January 2012, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched 
a new website, the NASA Open Government Initiative,5 to expand the agency’s open 
source software development. The NASA Open Government co-lead stated “We believe 
tomorrow’s space and science systems will be built in the open, and that code.nasa.gov 
will play a big part in getting us there” [3].

Open Source and the Federal Government
is to enable solutions to be developed through the integration of multiple frameworks 
and products while at the same time easing concerns over interoperability and porta­
bility. For example, in Chapter 2, interoperability, portability, and security standards 
were identified as critical barriers for the broader cloud adoption, both in the federal 
government and the private sector. OSS facilitates overcoming these standards 
­obstacles through the development and implementation of open standards.
In addition, OSS also enables agility within the software development by sup­
porting an agile procurement process where the federal agencies can more rapidly 
acquire/deploy technologies and capabilities. For example, many modernization 
projects have identified the use of open source software as a more economical value 
for the federal government. Through the use of smaller, agile procurements, federal 
agencies can achieve a higher yield and greater return on investment (ROI) compared 
to slower, inefficient long-term investments that use traditional ­procurement methods 
that tend to be outpaced by private sector innovations due to lengthy development 
cycles. Additionally, federal agencies are required to consider multiple factors when 
defining the overall business case10 for an IT investment.11 Some such factors that 
must be considered as part of the IT investment decision-making process12 includes 
the total cost of ownership and lifecycle maintenance costs, the costs associated with 
mitigating security risks, and the security and privacy of data [4]. OSS also requires 
transitioning to a subscription-based model, there by reducing the burden for federal 
agencies to invest in upfront costs which lock them into capital expenses that may be 
unrecoverable if the requirements change or a program is canceled or rescoped.
OPEN SOURCE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
The US government’s use of OSS has its beginning in the 1990s.13 During this 
period, OSS was used primarily within the research and scientific community where 
collaboration and information sharing14 was a cultural norm. However, it was not 
until 2000 that the federal government began to seriously consider the use of OSS as 
a model for accelerating innovation within the federal government. As illustrated in 
Figure 3.1, the federal government has developed a list of OSS-related studies, poli­
cies, and guidelines that have formed the basis for the policy framework that has

guided the adoption of OSS. This framework tackles critical issues that have ­inhibited 
the federal government from attaining the full benefits offered by OSS. Although 
gaps15 still exist in specific guidelines relating to the evaluation, contribution, and 
sharing of OSS, the policy framework serves as a foundation for guiding federal 
agencies in the use of OSS by reducing barriers that have limited a broader adoption. 
In this ­section we will explore the policy framework with the objective of describing 
how the current policy framework has led to the broader use of OSS across the fed­
eral government, and more importantly how this framework has enabled the federal 
­government’s adoption of cloud computing by overcoming the challenges with 
acquisition and security that will be discussed in detail in the next section.
The President’s Information Technology Advisory Committee (PITAC),16 which 
examined OSS, was given the goal [5] of:
• 
Charting a vision of how the federal government can support developing open 
source software;
• 
Defining a policy framework;
• 
Identifying policy, legal, and administrative barriers to the widespread adoption 
of OSS; and
• 
Identifying potential roles for public institutions in OSS economics model.

Open Source and the Federal Government
The PITAC published a report17 concluded that the use of the open source devel­
opment model (also known as the Bazaar model18) was a viable strategy for produc­
ing high quality software through a mixture of public, private, and academic 
partnerships [6]. In addition, as presented in Table 3.1, the report also highlighted 
several advantages and challenges. Some of these key issues have been at the fore­
front of the federal government’s adoption of OSS.
Over the years since the PITAC report, the federal government has gained 
­significant experience in both sponsoring and contributing to OSS projects. For exam­
ple, one of the most-widely recognized contributions by the federal government spe­
cifically related to security is the Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) project.19 The 
SELinux project focused on improving the Linux kernel through the development of 
a reference implementation of the Flask security architecture20 for flexible mandatory 
access control (MAC). In 2000, the National Security Agency (NSA)21 made the

Advantages •	
Potentially improved security because programmers have developed 
access to source code that allows them to examine it for potential 
embedded trap doors and/or Trojan horses
•	
Increase in the number of programmers searching for software bugs and 
developing fixes
Challenges
•	
Limitation in the project management and funding models to support 
“fiscal flexibility” for open source development
•	
Lack of policies or guidance governing export control and national 
security considerations
•	
Potentially incompatible licensing agreements used within the open 
source community may cause delays due to the lack of education of 
how to use them
•	
Poorly defined procurement rules do not explicitly authorize competition 
between open source alternatives and proprietary software
•	
Lack of clear guidance regarding the decision-making authority and/or 
responsibility of the federal agency to use open source software
•	
Lack of a single repository for warehousing open source projects

Starting in 2001, the MITRE Corporation, for the US Department of Defense 
(DoD), published a report34 that built a business case for the DoD’s use of OSS. The 
business case discussed both the benefits and risks for considering OSS. In MITRE’s 
conclusion, OSS offered significant benefits to the federal government, such as 
improved interoperability, increased support for open standards and quality, lower 
costs, and agility through reduced development time. In addition, MITRE ­highlighted 
issues and risks, recommending any consideration of OSS should be carefully 
reviewed.
Shortly after the MITRE report, the federal government began to establish 
­specific policies and guidance to help clarify issues around OSS. The DoD Chief

The Open Source Definition (OSD)23 had its beginning as free software24 in the early 
1980s during the free software movement25 starting with the GNU26 project27 which 
implemented the GPL. Although the early uses of the term “open source” and “free 
software” had been used interchangeably during that period, it was not until 1998 that 
Netscape Communications Corporation released28 their Netscape Navigator Web browser 
source code as Mozilla. At this time, the distinction of the “open source”29 concept 
became more mainstream within the broader commercial software industry. The Free 
Software Foundation30 and Open Source Initiative (OSI)31 have similar goals, but there 
was a notable difference in respect to their philosophies32 and approved licenses.33

Open Source and the Federal Government
Information Officer (CIO) published the department’s first official DoD-wide mem­
orandum to reiterate existing policy and to provide clarifying guidance on the acqui­
sition, development, and the use of OSS within the DoD community [7]. Soon after 
the DoD policy, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) established a memo­
randum to provide government-wide policy35 regarding acquisition36 and licensing 
issues.
Since 2003, there were multiple misconceptions, specifically within the DoD 
regarding the use of OSS. Therefore, in 2007, the US Department of the Navy (DON) 
CIO released a memorandum37 which clarified the classification of OSS and directed 
the Department to identify areas where OSS can be used within the DONs ­Information 
Technology (IT) portfolio. This was followed by another DoD-wide memorandum in 
2009, which provided DoD-wide guidance and clarified the use and development of 
OSS, including explaining the potential advantages of the DoD reducing the 
­development time for new software, anticipating threats, and response to continual 
changes in requirements [8].
In 2009, OMB released the Open Government Directive38 which required federal 
agencies to develop and publish an Open Government Plan on their websites. The 
Open Government Plan39 provided a description on how ­federal agencies would 
improve transparency and integrate public participation and collaboration [9]. As an 
example response to the directive support for openness, the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration (NASA) in furtherance of its Open Government Plan released 
the “open.NASA”40 site which was built completely using OSS, such as the LAMP 
stack41 and Wordpress content ­management system (CMS).

CHAPTER 3  A Case for Open Source
More recently, the White House’s release of the Digital Government Strategy 
complemented42 other initiatives and established principles for transforming the fed­
eral government. More specifically, the strategy outlined the need for a “shared plat­
form” approach. In this approach, the federal government would need to leverage 
“sharing” of resources such as the “use of open source technologies that enable more 
sharing of data and make content more accessible” [10].
In this section we discussed key milestones that have impacted the federal 
­government’s cultural acceptance of OSS. It also discussed the current policy 
­framework that has been developed through a series of policies and guidelines to 
support ­federal agencies in the adoption of OSS and the establishment of processes 
and policies to encourage and support the development of OSS. The remainder of 
this chapter will examine the key issues that have impacted OSS adoption and briefly 
examine the role of OSS in the adoption of cloud computing within the federal 
government.
OSS ADOPTION CHALLENGES: ACQUISITION AND SECURITY
The adoption of OSS as previously mentioned, has faced a number of roadblocks 
within the federal ­government. In this section, we will focus our examination specifi­
cally on the acquisition and security challenges that have been key inhibitors in the 
broad adoption of OSS. In addition, through our review we will obtain a better under­
standing of how the federal government’s relationship with OSS has changed over time 
and gain some insight into how this experience has eased the path to cloud computing.
42From The White House. Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the 
American People. Washington, DC: Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and 
Budget; 2012. “The Digital Government Strategy complements several initiatives aimed at building 
a 21st century government that works better for the American people. These include Executive Order 
13571 (Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service), Executive Order 13576 
(Delivering an Efficient, Effective, and Accountable Government), the President’s Memorandum on 
Transparency and Open Government, OMB Memorandum M-10-06 (Open Government Directive), the 
National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), and the 25-Point Implementation Plan 
to Reform Federal Information Technology Management (IT Reform).”
NOTE
In a blog post titled “Streaming at 1:00: In the Cloud” [11], former US CIO Vivek Kundra 
noted three critical challenges facing the federal government in deploying new IT services 
and products:
• Procurement processes can be confusing and time-consuming.
• Security procedures are complex, costly, lengthy, and duplicative across agencies.
• Our (federal government) policies lag behind new trends, causing unnecessary 
restrictions on the use of new technology.

61
OSS Adoption Challenges: Acquisition and Security
Acquisition Challenges
In the past, federal agencies have relied upon limited acquisition policy guidance43 
when considering the procurement and the use of OSS. In the PITAC report [12] 
discussed previously, two specific acquisition-related findings were highlighted:
• 
Licensing agreements—numerous licensing agreements, incompatible licensing 
requirements, and educating federal managers on open source licenses and 
conditions.44
• 
Federal procurement rules—no explicit authorization of competition between 
open source alternatives and proprietary software, and lack of guidance on 
applicability and usage of open source software.
Even with the limited policies guidance, federal agencies were required to ­understand 
how federal laws and regulations applied to the acquisition of OSS. Table 3.2 pro­
vides several references within federal laws and regulations that must be considered 
by federal agencies when procuring OSS (and other proprietary) COTS products.
In addition, federal agencies are also required to understand how to select and 
apply the various types of software licenses, specifically “where future ­modifications 
by the US government may be necessary” [13]. Guidelines in developing license 
criteria [14] used in ­determining which OSS license to use could include:
• 
Using an existing OSS license; not creating a new OSS license.
• 
Making sure it is actually OSS.
• 
Using a GPL-compatible license.
• 
Choosing a license that meets the expected uses of the OSS.
• 
Using a common OSS license.
In order to dispel concerns over these license issues, several policy documents were 
issued to govern acquisition and provide guidance on the use of OSS within the 
­federal government. The OSS acquisition policy framework, outlined in Table 3.3, 
consists primarily of the existing OMB and DoD policies; however, some federal 
agencies have issued additional guidance45 to provide specific ­guidance on how OSS 
could be used to support their specific mission and business requirements.

“The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) classifies open source software as commercial computer 
software” (or “commercial item means”)—(1) customarily used by the general public or by non-

CHAPTER 3  A Case for Open Source
In addition to the policy documents, several frequently asked questions (FAQs) 
have been developed to facilitate understanding key acquisition-related issues 
(see Table 3.4).
Security Challenges
OSS has previously been characterized as offering a number of potential security 
advantages. The security advantages include the ability for developers to access 
the source code, allowing for a more thorough examination and identification of 
­security vulnerabilities, and an increased number of availability of programmers 
searching for bugs and subsequently developing fixes [12]. However, some of the 
same advantages have also been overshadowed by hindrances such as uncertainty of 
the ­trustworthiness of code repositories and the availability of source code to allow 
­malicious attackers the ability to identify security vulnerabilities.
Challenges associated with security in OSS have also existed because there has 
been a lack of clarification and education of the processes and certifications required 
to ensure software is validated for use within the federal government. Some of the 
commonly used processes46 and certification methodologies that are required for 
46Certification and accreditation processes are discussed in detail in Chapter 7, Comparison of Federal 
and International Security Certification Standards.

gies and identify viable and sustainable approaches that support national cyber secu­
rity objectives” [17]. For example, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), 
Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate Cyber Security Research and Develop­
ment Center (CSRDC) manages the Homeland Open Security Technology (HOST)51 
program which is an information portal for open-source security tools and applica­
tion. In addition, the DHS also initiated the Open Source Hardening Project to main­
tain a database of analyzed OSS using the Coverity scan.52 The Scan website offers

OSS and Federal Cloud Computing
OSS AND FEDERAL CLOUD COMPUTING
Open source technologies have played a significant role in the federal government’s 
adoption of cloud computing. From the inception of the 25-Point Implementation 
Plan to Reform Federal Information Technology Management, which introduced the 
key components of the federal government’s adoption of “light technologies” and 
“shared solutions,” the federal government has initiated the shift toward more 
­openness and shared platforms. Openness and shared platforms support the ability of 
the federal government to deliver agility and innovation. OSS has served as the 
enabler, spawning incubations54 in technologies across the industry and public sector 
that have formed the foundation of many of the cloud computing platforms.
The Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) is a federal consolida­
tion effort focused on reducing physical space by shifting IT investments to more 
efficient computing platforms and technologies [21]. These computing platforms and 
54Examples include python (http://www.python.org/), Java (http://www.java.com), Springsource 
(http://www.springsource.com/), Apache Software Foundation (http://projects.apache.org/indexes/
alpha.html), and Linux (http://kernel.org/).
NOTE
In 2003, NASA began “assessing the formal barriers to distributing software they 
developed as open source and began reviewing the state of open source licenses”55 [19]. 
Open source56 directly addressed NASA’s needs of the rapid and wide dissemination of 
software with minimal overhead and cost, supporting its functions under the National 
Aeronautics and Space Act.57 However, it was not until September 15, 2009, when the 
former US CIO Vivek Kundra announced the launch of Apps.gov58 at the NASA Ames 
Research Center (ARC),59 did it set the stage for the next phase in the federal 
government’s adoption of public cloud computing services. During this time, NASA ARC 
had already begun an effort in the development of a cloud environment through the Nebula 
project.60 NASA Nebula, “which started out as a Web consolidation exercise” [20],

technologies leverage virtualization to support the ability to consolidate and improve 
government-wide IT utilization through shared infrastructures. The Cloud First and 
Shared First policies were established to increase the return on investment (ROI) 
associated with the federal government’s use of its IT investment. The optimization 
of IT investment requires the use of the economies of scale offered by cloud commut­
ing and other shared service64 platforms. By leveraging reuse offered by OSS and the 
consolidation of redundant missions, through cross-organizational cloud services, 
efficiency can be delivered through more “economical” and “shared” delivery ser­
vice models. The Digital Government Strategy, as illustrated in Figure 3.2, 
reiterated the need to deliver more efficient customer-centric services at a lower cost 
point through technologies that support the information,65platform,66 and presenta­
tions67 layers. In addition, cloud computing and related technologies offer a shared

platform to support the federal government’s ability to manage information68 in an 
organized manner and deliver the information using multiple accessibility modes 
(e.g., websites and mobile applications). A shared platform approach also provides 
an efficient and low-cost mechanism to develop and deliver services and information 
that support the strategy through three strategic objectives:
• 
Securely architect for interoperability and openness.
• 
Develop governance structure for digital services69 (e.g., procurement and 
security policies and processes).
• 
Spur innovation by providing the federal government’s data in open and 
machine-readable formats.

CHAPTER 3  A Case for Open Source
OSS, as an enabler for cloud computing and other shared platforms, has acceler­
ated the shift in technology delivery models, both in the public and private sectors. 
OSS has also produced many of the key technology innovations that are built into the 
foundation of this technology shift, such as different virtualization70 technologies 
and cloud computing71 platforms. These technologies and platforms can be lever­
aged to support the federal government’s digital strategy through an open, standards-
based approach that provides a more efficient use of rapidly ­evolving technologies. 
In addition, many OSS projects utilize a shared development methodology. This 
methodology promotes agility by bringing together a ­community of developers that 
can deliver innovative solutions faster and with fewer ­dedicated resources.
SUMMARY
In this chapter a case for open source was presented with a focus on ­understanding 
how the accelerated pathway to the cloud was, in part, contributed to by the broader 
government-wide acceptance of OSS. Challenges faced by the federal ­government 
in addressing acquisition were examined, which included licensing and ­federal 
­procurement policies. Security was also discussed with specific focus on the ­processes 
and certification methods that provide risk-based approaches to verify OSS as part 
of the system development life cycle (SDLC). Finally, the chapter concluded with 
a brief discussion on how OSS is an enabler that supports the federal government’s 
objectives of embracing technologies to promote efficiency and improved service 
delivery in a secure, standards-based approach.

•	 Federal Privacy Laws and Policies

•	 Security and Privacy Issues
INTRODUCTION
We have already learned in Chapter 1 that public cloud computing presents the fed­
eral government with significant opportunities for reduced cost and improved opera­
tional efficiency. In this chapter, the discussion will focus specifically on security and 
privacy within the context of public cloud computing. Public cloud services can pro­
vide benefits for improved information security, and even enhance privacy practices. 
But the benefits of public cloud computing can be outweighed by potential security 
and privacy issues, concerns, or risks1 if there is not a comprehensive “due diligence” 
process. The due diligence process helps ensure the issues, concerns, or risks are 
integrated into the preliminary cloud service selection and assessment activities.
Security and privacy are distinct and independent disciplines in which aspects of 
privacy, as will be discussed later in this chapter, include specific principles and con­
siderations that do not necessarily overlap with security. But foundational security 
practices are required for privacy to be effective in a public cloud computing environ­
ment. Therefore, the information that will be hosted within a public cloud service 
needs to be designed and operate to meet the same security and privacy requirements

and recommendation for information security provides a list of 35 risks that cover areas such as policy  
and organizational, technical, legal, and traditional IT. Available from: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/

as traditional federal information systems. Federal agencies will likely base their 
analysis in the context of their own use cases2 for a public cloud service to ensure the 
Cloud Service Provider (CSP) has addressed all applicable laws, regulations, and 
policies. Their analysis could leverage existing practices when considering general 
security and privacy issues (e.g., data location, data ownership, risk, visibility, etc.) 
for privacy-related information that will be stored, processed, or transmitted through 
the use of public cloud services.
The transition to a public cloud service requires federal agencies and CSPs to 
review their governance practices (i.e., policies, procedures, and processes) to ensure 
from an organizational perspective the existing roles and responsibilities can operate 
effectively in the context of privacy. Federal agencies may also have to introduce new 
risk management3 processes. Risk assessments performed in a traditional computing 
environment where the federal agency has more control over the risks mitigations 
may not be possible to achieve within a public cloud service, and will instead require 
a close coordination with the CSP to ensure mitigations are appropriately integrated 
and managed. Therefore, the consistency between the federal agencies’ and the 
CSPs’ risk management process is essential to ensure risks identified are adequately 
prioritized and mitigated through the selection and implementation of security

3From Kundra, V. Federal Cloud Computing Strategy. Washington, DC: Executive Office of the President,  
Office of Management and Budget; 2011. “Risk management entails identifying and assessing risk, 
and taking the steps to reduce it to an acceptable level.”
The Federal Cloud Computing Strategy [1] highlighted several potential security benefits 
that can be achieved through the use of cloud services, to include:
• Staff specialization—the ability to focus resources on areas of high concern as more 
general security services are assumed by the cloud provider.
• Platform strength—potential platform strength resulting from greater uniformity and 
homogeneity, and resulting improved information assurance, security response, system 
management, reliability, and maintainability.
• Resource availability—improved resource availability through scalability, redundancy, 
and disaster recovery capabilities; improved resilience to unanticipated service 
demands.
• Backup and recovery—improved backup and recovery capabilities, policies, procedures, 
and consistency.
• Data concentration—ability to leverage alternate cloud service to improve the overall 
security posture than that of traditional data centers.

73
Security and Privacy in the Context of the Public Cloud
controls that minimize the “significant privacy concerns associated with the [public] 
cloud computing environment” [2].
The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP),4 
which will be discussed in more detail in later chapters, provides a common 
framework that uses existing processes and practices already used by federal 
agencies to verify the security and privacy requirements.5 For example, a Privacy 
Impact Assessment (PIA)6 is a tool already required by federal agencies7 and is 
used to determine the type of privacy-related information stored, processed, or 
transmitted through the use of the target public cloud computing environment. In 
addition, the PIA helps guide the determination of the types of protections that are 
required for selecting appropriate security and privacy controls that need to be 
implemented by CSPs to adequately mitigate identified risks to privacy informa­
tion. In addition, the Federal Enterprise Architecture Security and Privacy Profile 
(FEA-SPP)8 can be used by federal agencies (and CSPs) in the context of public 
cloud computing to address the identification of information security and data 
privacy requirements [3].
SECURITY AND PRIVACY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PUBLIC 
CLOUD
Public cloud computing by definition is a service that is owned, managed, and oper­
ated by a service provider (e.g., private company, federal or state government, etc.) 
on its premises and is consumed by the general public [5]. Cloud computing delivery 
models are comparably different from what is commonly used by many federal agen­
cies where their information systems are hosted within traditional, dedicated infra­
structures located within a federal data center or in a contractor’s data center. New 
types of technologies and delivery models will likely introduce new definitions, mak­
ing it difficult and important to have a common context9 for federal agencies to use

when determining how the public cloud service will be used to store, process, or 
transmit sensitive data collected to support their mission and business requirements.
For the purpose of this chapter, the NIST definition provides a good starting point 
for discussing security and privacy issues in public cloud computing. The basic char­
acterization by NIST of public cloud computing only intended to serve as a means 
for a broad comparison [4]. This definition is supported by a conceptual reference 
architecture, depicted in Figure 4.1, (and taxonomy) that provides a high-level illus­
tration of security and privacy as cross-cutting and existing across all architectural 
layers.
In addition, the conceptual reference architecture provides a useful tool for focus­
ing on the security and privacy requirements for what CSPs need to provide rather 
than describing a specific solution that needs to be designed and implemented [5]. 
When federal agencies begin to plan for security and privacy considerations in public 
cloud services, the generalization of the NIST definition can be further expanded 
to include a definition of specific security and privacy security requirements. This 
elaboration of the basic NIST definition enables the selection of a common group 
of public cloud services based on an examination of the context given by the federal 
agency’s requirements. In contrast, the CSP can perform a similar activity by identi­
fying a target group of federal agencies, and reflect their requirements in the context 
of their cloud service to determine if any additional security and privacy controls 
need to be applied to make it acceptable for use.

Federal Privacy Laws and Policies
FEDERAL PRIVACY LAWS AND POLICIES
Privacy is a core value of American society. The importance of protecting privacy 
information is already a part of many industries in which US federal privacy laws 
span. Table 4.1 provides an example of some of the types of regulatory and legisla­
tive frameworks that exist that might be relevant when considering the collection and 
storage of privacy-related information in a public cloud service.
In 1972, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HW) formed the Advi­
sory Committee on Automated Personal Data Systems, “to analyze the consequences 
of using computers to keep records about people” [7]. The committee produced a 
report in which it was concluded that “safeguards for personal privacy based on our 
TIP
The Federal Cloud Computing Strategy [1] identified several key security considerations to 
guide federal agencies in assessing the risk in the context of the public cloud computing 
environment and improve confidence in the use of cloud services:
• carefully define security and privacy requirements during the initial planning stage at 
the start of the systems development life cycle;
• determine the extent to which negotiated service agreements are required to satisfy 
security requirements; and the alternatives of using negotiated service agreements or 
cloud computing deployment models which offer greater oversight and control over 
security and privacy;
• assess the extent to which the server and client-side computing environment meets 
organizational security and privacy requirements; and
• continue to maintain security management practices, controls, and accountability over 
the privacy and security of data and applications.
WARNING
Federal agencies are obligated through the Federal Information Security Management Act 
(FISMA) with a number of requirements that include, although not specifically limited 
to, OMB policies, FIPS standards, federal agency-specific policy requirements and 
authorization, and continuous monitoring requirements. Therefore, when federal agencies 
make the decision to choose a public cloud service for their agencies’ outsourcing needs, 
they have been encouraged to carefully consider the following types of factors:
• statutory compliance (laws, regulations, and agency requirements);
• data characteristics (fundamental protections an application’s data set requires);
• privacy and confidentiality (protect against accidental and nefarious access to 
information);
• integrity (ensure data is authorized, complete, and accurate);
• data controls and access policies (where data can be stored and who can access 
physical locations); and
• governance (ensure that cloud computing service providers are sufficiently transparent, 
have adequate security and management controls, and provide the information 
necessary for the agency to appropriately and independently assess and monitor the 
efficacy of those controls) [1].

concept of mutuality in record-keeping would require adherence by record-keeping 
organizations to certain fundamental principles of fair information practice” [7]. The 
report recommended the adoption of a federal Code of Fair Information Practices 
(FIPs)10 for the protection of information within computers [referred to as automated 
personal data systems]. In 1980, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) revised and adopted the original FIPs and extended them to 
create a set of eight Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs)11 listed in Table 4.2.
Many of the US privacy laws are based on the FIPPs as an industry recognized a 
set of practices for protecting data and privacy.
The federal government has the legal responsibility to ensure governance and 
accountability of personally identifiable information (PII).12 Safeguarding PII in the 
possession of the federal government and preventing its breach are essential to ensure 
the trust of the American public [9]. Therefore, before we can effectively discuss 
potential security and privacy issues, a basic understanding is required of some of the

framework balances the federal government’s need to maintain information about 
individuals with the rights of individuals to be protected against unwarranted inva­
sions of their privacy stemming from the collection, maintenance, use, and disclosure 
of personal information about them [10].
The Privacy Act is based on the internationally recognized FIPPs previously dis­
cussed. The Act protects certain federal government records14 pertaining to individu­
als,15 collected, maintained, used, and disseminated by federal agencies. The records 
containing PII are stored in a system of records (SOR) which is “a group of any 
records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the 
name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying 
particular assigned to the individual” [11].
In accordance with the Privacy Act,16 federal agencies are required to give public 
notice through a Systems of Records Notice (SORN) in the Federal Registrar,17 that 
includes information about the SOR such as
• 
System name.
• 
Security classification.
• 
System location(s).18
• 
Categories of individual covered by the system.
• 
Categories of records covered by the system.
• 
Authority for maintenance of the system.
• 
Disclosure to consumer reporting agencies.
• 
Routine use of records maintained in the system, including categories of users 
and the purpose of such uses.

Federal Privacy Laws and Policies
The extension of Privacy Act requirements for the collection and storage of PII to 
a public cloud service will likely need to be carefully evaluated by the CSP and the 
federal agency for a cloud service operating as the federal agencies’ SOR. “Once 
an agency chooses a cloud computing provider to collect and store information, the 
individual is no longer providing information solely to the government, but also to 
a third party who is not necessarily bound by the same laws and regulations” [13]. 
Since federal agencies are “ultimately accountable for the security and privacy of 
data held by a cloud provider on their behalf” [5], the requirements of the Privacy Act 
and the responsibility for the implementation of privacy controls will be discussed 
later in this chapter. Therefore, assistance or requirements by the CSP to support the 
federal agency meeting requirements under the Privacy Act will need to be clearly 
addressed through a contractual obligation (e.g., protecting privacy information, and 
reporting breaches or disclosures).

Under Section (m) of the Privacy Act, a government contractor’s information system is 
subject to the requirements of the Act, if under contract, the federal agency contracts for 
the operation by or on behalf of the agency, a SOR to accomplish an agency function [11]. 
Since CSPs may store records covered under the Privacy Act, the CSPs’ cloud service 
could be considered a SOR and be subject to the same requirements19 as federal 
agencies. In addition, a cloud service operated by a CSP that is covered by the Privacy Act 
could be subject to civil and criminal implications if the CSP knowingly and willfully acts 
or fails to act as described in the Privacy Act [21].

system.22 In addition, federal agencies are required to identify and assess the risk to 
their PII, and to ensure security controls are implemented to enable adequate secu­
rity. Therefore, CSPs that collect, store, or process PII on behalf of the federal gov­
ernment may have a responsibility to meet specific security requirements. These 
security requirements are based on the confidentiality,23 integrity, and available 
objectives for the information identified as a result of a security categorization con­
ducted by the CSP or the federal agency.
NIST was given the responsibility for developing standards and guidelines for 
information systems. These standards and guidelines include providing federal agen­
cies with guidance24 on categorizing PII. The Privacy Act requires federal agencies 
to establish administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to insure the security 
and confidentiality of records and to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards 
to their security or integrity which could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, 
inconvenient or unfairness on whom information is obtained [9]. Harm is the adverse 
effects that would be experienced by an individual whose PII was the subject of a loss 
of confidentiality, as well as any adverse effects experienced by the organization that 
maintains the PII [14]. Therefore, the loss (or breach) of confidentiality would likely 
need to be evaluated against the unauthorized disclosure of the PII and the “effect on 
the organizational operations, organizational assets, or individual” [15] against the 
different confidentiality impact levels (see Table 4.3).
FISMA also required federal agencies to establish procedures for the detection, 
reporting, and response of security incidents. In addition, OMB requires federal 
agencies to report incidents involving PII to the US Department of Homeland Secu­
rity (DHS), US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT).25 Incidents that 
involve breaches to PII are categorized by the US-CERT as a Category 1 and require 
reporting within one hour of the discovery/detection. The CSPs’ incident response 
plan26 will need to reflect any new requirements for notification and reporting by 
ensuring service agreements address the requirements and responsibility for notifica­
tion, reporting, and any costs associated with an incident involving the compromise 
of PII.

Privacy and security can mean different things to different people because they are 
identified as distinct disciplines. Privacy and security do overlap in many aspects, but 
privacy includes more than security and confidentiality and includes the principles 
of transparency and notice and choice [16]. However, it is widely agreed upon that

Safeguarding Privacy Information
some aspects of privacy require a sound security practice (e.g., accountability, integ­
rity, confidentiality, and data destruction). Therefore, it is important to recognize that 
“organizations cannot have effective privacy without a solid foundation of informa­
tion security” [16].
Privacy can be summarized as the need to protect certain information about indi­
viduals and organizations and “involves the right to control when, where, how, to 
whom, and to what extent an individual shares their own personal information, as 
well as the right to access personal information given to others, to correct it, and to 
ensure it is safeguarded and disposed of appropriately” [6]. Security, on the other 
hand, provides the safeguards (e.g., administrative, technical, and physical) for 
achieving the confidentiality, integrity, and availability objectives for protecting the 
privacy information.
Confidentiality refers to what data may be disclosed and to whom the data may 
be disclosed, thereby ensuring that only legally authorized and appropriate disclo­
sures are made. Integrity is the assurance that information and information sys­
tems are protected against improper or accidental modification. Availability is the 
assurance of timely and reliable access to information and information systems 
by authorized persons [17]. Figure 4.2 provides an illustration that depicts the 
relationship that exists between privacy (FIPPs) as and security (Safeguards) and 
which might require implementation within a public cloud computing environment 
FIGURE 4.2  Relationship between FIPPs and Safeguards

to prevent the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, and destruction 
of PII.
As we already discussed, FIPPs provide an internationally accepted framework, 
reflected in many US laws for addressing privacy requirements. FIPPs also serve as 
the basis for analyzing privacy risks and determining appropriate mitigation strate­
gies [16].
NIST and the Federal CIO Council’s Privacy Committee developed a comprehen­
sive set of privacy controls31 for federal agencies to use for ensuring they develop and 
implement appropriate privacy protection and practices to achieve the organization’s 
privacy objectives. Privacy controls32 provide “a roadmap for organizations to use in 
identifying and implementing privacy controls concerning the life cycle of PII” [16] 
and when to “address potential risks when moving to a cloud computing environ­
ment” [18]. In addition, the privacy control can be used within existing federal gov­
ernment frameworks33 such as the Federal Risk and Authorization Management 
Program (FedRAMP) when specifying the federal privacy requirements for govern­
ment-wide use of public cloud services when privacy-related information is involved.
Privacy Controls
The privacy controls included in this section are based on those identified in the 
Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations. 
Table 4.5 provides a description of each of the privacy control families. These pri­
vacy controls provide the safeguards (i.e., administrative, technical, and physical) 
to be implemented by the CSP or within the public cloud service when it has been 
determined PII is being collected and stored.

Safeguarding Privacy Information
Table 4.5  Summary of Privacy Control Families [16]
Control Family
Description
Authority and Pur­
pose (AP)
This family furthers compliance with the Privacy Act by ensuring 
that organizations: (i) identify the legal bases that authorize a 
particular PII collection or activity that impacts privacy; and 
(ii) specify in their notices, the purpose(s) for which PII is collected
Accountability, 
Audit, and Risk 
Management (AR)
This family enhances public confidence through effective controls 
for governance, monitoring, risk management, and assessment 
to demonstrate that organizations are complying with applicable 
privacy protection requirements and minimizing overall privacy risk
Data Quality and 
Integrity (DI)
This family ensures compliance with Section 552a (e)(2) of the 
Privacy Act of 1974 and enhances public confidence that any PII 
collected and maintained by organizations is accurate, relevant, 
timely, and complete for the purpose for which it is to be used, as 
specified in public notices
Data Minimization 
and Retention (DM)
This family helps organizations implement the data minimization 
and retention elements of the Privacy Act, which requires 
organizations to collect, use, and retain only PII that is relevant 
and necessary for the specified purpose for which it was originally 
collected. Organizations retain PII for only as long as necessary to 
fulfill the specified purpose(s) and in accordance with a National 
Archives and Records Administration (NARA)-approved record 
retention schedule
Individual 
Participation and 
Redress (IP)
This family addresses the need to make individuals active 
participants in the decision-making process regarding the collection 
and use of their PII, as required by the Privacy Act. By 
providing individuals with access to PII and the ability to have their 
PII corrected or amended, as appropriate, the controls in this family 
enhance public confidence in organizational decisions made based 
on the PII
Security (SE)
This family supplements the security controls in Appendix F to 
ensure administrative, technical, and physical safeguards are 
in place to protect PII collected or maintained by organizations 
against loss, unauthorized access, or disclosure, as required by 
the Privacy Act, and to ensure that organizational planning and 
responses to privacy incidents comply with OMB policies and 
guidance. The controls in this family are implemented in 
coordination with information security personnel and in accordance 
with the existing NIST Risk Management Framework
Transparency (TR)
This family implements Sections 552a (e)(3) and (e)(4) of the Privacy 
Act and Section 208 of the E-Government Act, which require 
public notice of an organization’s information practices and the 
privacy impact of government programs and activities
Use Limitation (UL)
This family helps organizations comply with the Privacy Act, which 
prohibits the use of PII that is either not specified in notices, 
incompatible with the specified purposes, or not otherwise 
permitted by law. Implementation of the controls in this family will 
ensure that the scope of PII use is limited accordingly

Data Breaches, Impacts, and Consequences
Data breaches34 involving PII extend beyond the individual35 (e.g., identity theft36) 
involved and can produce significant impacts for the CSP and/or the federal agency. 
The organizational impacts can include lost revenue and unbudgeted costs associated 
34From Wood, D. GAO Report 07-737, Data Breaches Are Frequent, but Evidence of Resulting Iden-
tity Theft Is Limited; However, the Full Extent Is Unknown. Washington: US General Accountability 
Office; 2007. “An organization’s unauthorized or unintentional exposure, disclosure, or loss of sensi-
tive personal information, which can include personally identifiable information such as Social Secu-
rity numbers (SSN) or financial information such as credit card numbers.”

with responding to the incident, or even a loss of credibility, confidence, and trust 
from existing customers or the public.
Data breaches can also occur for a variety of reasons. Some occur due to intentional 
actions such as theft of information; others are due to negligence or accidents. Intentional 
actions involve breaches such as hacking, employee theft, theft of physical equipment, 
or deception or misrepresentation to obtain unauthorized data. Negligence or accidental 
losses include loss of laptop computer or other hardware, loss of data tapes, unintentional 
exposure on the Internet, or improper disposal of data [19].
Consequences and accountability are important aspects to ensure compliance 
with federal privacy laws and policies that lead to the adequate handling and safe­
guarding of PII. To address this necessity, OMB requires federal agencies to develop 
and implement a rules and consequences policy that facilitates the training and 
enforcement of adherence by employees, contractors, or others involved in handling 
PII collected and stored by the federal government, other federal government agen­
cies, or service providers on a federal agency’s behalf.
NOTE
On May 10, 2006, Executive Order 13402, “Strengthening Federal Efforts to Protect 
Against Identity Theft,” was issued to create a Presidential Identity Theft Task Force to 
review and advise on the execution of the policy37 set forth by the President of the United 
States for “Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable 
Information.” As a result of the Task Force, OMB issued a policy reiterating the privacy 
and security requirements for federal agencies under the Privacy Act (and other laws, 
executive orders, regulations, and policies), and required federal agencies to develop and 
implement breach notification policies.
In addition, it highlighted new technical controls that were to supplement those already 
required under US laws and policies. For example, OMB established additional security 
requirements for the protection of all federal information (regardless of whether it was 
covered under the Privacy Act). These security requirements included:
• encryption using NIST-certified cryptographic modules38 to mobile computers/devices,
• two-factor authentication for remote access,
• enforcement of a “time-out” capability requiring re-authentication after 30 minutes of 
inactivity, and
• logging and verification of all data extracts from database containing sensitive 
information, including the verification of destruction after 90 days (if no longer being 
used).

Data Security Breaches
On May 7, 2007, the Congressional Research Services (CRS) reported on personal data 
security breaches to Congress through a report title “Data Security Breaches: Context and 
Incident Summaries.” The breaches were not only due to illegal activity such as hacking or 
unauthorized employee accesses, but also due to poor security and privacy practices such 
as lost laptops and posting of personal data to public websites. Highlights of the report [20] 
that covered business, education, financial, government, and healthcare industries included:
Business
• March 2007—Hacker broke into the website of Johnny’s Selected Seeds (Winslow, ME) 
and stole credit card information in which 20 were used fraudulently.
• February 2007—TJ Maxx computer systems were hacked which resulted in drivers’ 
license numbers, names, and addresses being compromised.
Education
• April 2007—Ohio State University’s firewall was bypassed by hackers using foreign 
Internet in which the names, Social Security numbers, employee identification 
numbers, and birthdates of current and former staff members was stolen.
• April 2007—University of California, San Francisco’s campus server was compromised 
over a two-year period in which the names, Social Security numbers, and bank 
accounts for students, faculty, and staff were allegedly affected.
Financial
• December 2006—TD Ameritrade’s computers were hacked by criminals using stolen 
customer accounts requiring them to cover approximately $4 million in fraudulent 
transactions.
• December 2005—Scottrade Inc. was hacked through the internet in which the 
customers’ names, birth dates, driver’s license numbers, phone numbers, bank names, 
bank routing information, bank account numbers, and Scottrade account numbers were 
allegedly stolen.
Government
• February 2007—Personal information (names and Social Security numbers) were 
inadvertently posted to Connecticut State Administrative Services Department’s 
website.
• November 2006—Bowling Green Ohio Police Department inadvertent published 
personal data (names, Social Security numbers, and phone numbers) to website.
Healthcare
• March 2007—Westerly Hospital in Westerly, RI, allegedly posted patients’ confidential 
information (name, Social Security number, and insurance information) posted on 
public website.
• Ohio Board of Nursing posted the names and Social Security numbers of nurses to 
their website twice in one month.

and privacy requirements that need to exist. Using situational analysis techniques 
such as SWOT39 (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats), a federal 
agency can analyze the different public cloud service offerings from various CSPs. 
The analysis can be used to determine if privacy and security-related issues, identi­
fied in Table 4.6, believed to have long-term significance for cloud computing [5] 
exist. In addition, any applicable service agreements (or a separate contract)40 used 
can be updated to ensure the CSP satisfies the federal agency’s security and privacy 
requirements.
39The European Network Information Security Agency (ENISA) Security & Resilience in Govern-
ment Clouds provides an example of using SWOT as a tool as an initial analyzes of different cloud 
models. Available from: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/act/rm/emerging-and-future-risk/deliverables/

SUMMARY
Public cloud computing presents many opportunities for the federal government to 
reduce costs and improve operational efficiency. But it requires clear understand­
ing of the security and privacy requirements and examining the risks of the types 
of information that will be placed in the cloud and requiring an appropriate level of 
assurance through the application of security service and privacy controls. Although 
cloud computing is evolving, the application of appropriate frameworks such as the 
FEA-SPP and tools such as PIAs can assist in predicting the implications and conse­
quences of collecting and storing privacy in a public cloud service.

INFORMATION IN THIS CHAPTER:
•	 Introduction to FISMA
•	 Risk Management Framework Overview
•	 NIST RMF Process
INTRODUCTION TO FISMA
The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) was signed into law on 
December 17, 2002 as part of the E-Government Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-347). 
FISMA permanently reauthorized the framework laid out in the Government Infor­
mation Security Reform Act (GISRA) of 2000,1 which expired in November 2002 
[1]. FISMA is divided into multiple sections, each of which will be briefly described 
in this section.
Purpose
FISMA was built upon several existing federal laws designed to ensure the security 
of federal information and information systems. These federal laws include the Com­
puter Security Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-35),2 Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
1GISRA directed federal agencies to conduct annual IT security reviews and Inspectors General 
(IGs) to perform annual independent evaluations of agency programs and systems and report their 
results to OMB. Available from: http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/omb/
inforeg/2002gisra_report.pdf.
2From 100th Congress. Public Law 100-235, Computer Security Act of 1987 (40 U.S.C. 759 note). 
Washington: US Congress; 1987. “To provide for a computer standards program within the National 
Bureau of Standards to provide for Government-wide computer security, and to provide for the train-
ing in security matters of persons who are involved in the management, operation, and use of Federal 
computer systems, and for other purposes.”
CHAPTER
Applying the NIST Risk 
Management Framework 5

104
CHAPTER 5  Applying the NIST Risk Management Framework
(Public Law 104-13),3 and Information Technology Management Reform Act of 
1996 (i.e., Clinger-Cohen Act, Public Law 104-106, Division E).4 The purpose of 
FISMA, as outlined in Section 3541,5 is covered in six major objectives. In this chap­
ter, the focus will be on 1–4:
1.	 Establishment of a framework for ensuring the effectiveness of security 
controls;
2.	 Development of mechanisms for effective government-wide management and 
oversight of security-related risks;
3.	 Development and maintenance of a minimum set of required security controls;
4.	 Improvement of oversight of information security programs;
5.	 Utilization of commercially developed information security products for pro­
tecting critical information infrastructures; and
6.	 Selection of commercially developed information security solutions should be 
left to individual federal agencies.
Role and Responsibilities
The assignment of roles and responsibilities for information security within the 
federal government was clarified or reiterated within FISMA to cover policy, pro­
curement, standards, and incident response. Although FISMA was the last major leg­
islative framework, over the years the foundation has been built upon by a series of 
Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards and guidelines. Within 
FISMA, several specific roles were identified:
• 
Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
• 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
• 
Federal Agencies:
•	
Head of Agency or equivalent.
•	
Chief Information Officer (CIO).
•	
Senior Agency Information Security Officer (SAISO).
3From 104th Congress. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. Washington: US Congress; 1995. In part it 
ensured “the creation, collection, maintenance, use, dissemination, and disposition of information by 
or for the Federal Government is consistent with applicable laws, including laws relating to the privacy 
and confidentiality, including section 552a of title 5, security of information, including the Computer 
Security Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-235); and access to information, including section 552 of title 5.”
4Public Law 104-106, Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 (also known as the 
Clinger-Cohen Act) directed the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop 
standards, guidelines, and associated methods and techniques for federal computer systems. The stan-
dards and guidelines issued by NIST, known as Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), are 
used government-wide and developed when there are compelling federal government requirements and 
there are no existing voluntary standards to address the federal requirements for the interoperability of 
different systems, the portability of data and software, and computer security.
5Section 3541 defined the purpose of the Subchapter III—Information Security.

Introduction to FISMA
• 
Secretary of Defense (SecDef).
• 
Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
In this section, each role will be discussed as it relates to the responsibilities 
described in FISMA.
Director of OMB
OMB has as one of its key roles6 the responsibility to implement and enforce govern­
ment-wide policies. Through FISMA, the Director of OMB was given the authority 
for overseeing the federal agency implementation and enforcement of security poli­
cies and practices. The authorities included:
• 
Developing and overseeing the implementation of policies, principles, stand­
ards, and guidelines on information security (including ensuring timely adop­
tion and compliance by federal agencies);
• 
Requiring federal agencies to identify and provide for the information security 
protection for federal information systems and information;
• 
Coordinating and developing standards and guidelines;
• 
Overseeing federal agency compliance with FISMA requirements;
• 
Reviewing (approving/disapproving), at least annually, federal agency informa­
tion security programs;
• 
Coordinating information security policies and procedures with related infor­
mation resources management policies and procedures;
• 
Overseeing the operation of the federal information security incident center;7 and
• 
Reporting annually to Congress on compliance by federal agencies with 
FISMA requirements (no later than March 1).8
These authorities were limited with respect to national security systems (NSSs),9 
except as they relate to budgetary actions and annual reporting to Congress. In this

Homeland Security (DHS), National Cyber Security Division (NCSD), Information Analysis and 
Infrastructure Protection (IA&IP) Directorate. For more information on the IA&IP, see http://www.
dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/CII_Act.pdf.
8The annual FISMA report includes: summary of findings of annual independent evaluations (e.g., 
Office of Inspector General Audits), assessment of adoption and compliance with the NIST standards 
and guidelines, significant deficiencies in federal agency information security practices, any planned 
remediation actions to address deficiencies, and summary of a report developed by the NIST.

Any information system whose function, operations, or use involves intelligence activities, involves cryp-
tographic activities related to national security, involves command and control of military forces, involves 
equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system, is critical to the fulfillment of military 
or intelligence missions (excluding any system that is used for administrative and business applications), 
or is protected at all times by procedures established for information that have been specifically authorized 
under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept classified in the interest 
of national defense or foreign policy.

CHAPTER 5  Applying the NIST Risk Management Framework
chapter, only those aspects of NSSs related to the NIST Risk Management Frame­
work (RMF) will be discussed.10
NIST
NIST, under FISMA, was assigned the responsibility to develop standards, guide­
lines, and associated methods and techniques for federal agencies. These standards 
and guidelines include the minimum requirements for providing adequate informa­
tion security for federal information systems (excluding national security systems):
• 
Standards to be used for categorizing information and information systems 
based on objectives of providing an adequate level of information security 
(Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) PUB 199, Standards for 
Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems);
• 
Guidelines recommending the types of information and information systems (NIST 
Special Publication (SP) 800-60 Revision 1, Volume I and II: Guide for Mapping 
Types of Information and Information System to Security Categories); and
• 
Minimum information security requirements (Federal Information Processing 
Standard (FIPS) PUB 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal 
Information and Information Systems and NIST Special Publication (SP) 
800-53 Revision 3, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information 
Systems and Organizations).
NIST was also given the responsibility for developing guidelines for the detection and 
handling of information security incidents (NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-61 Revi­
sion 2, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide), and guidelines for identifying an 
information system as a national security system (NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-
59, Guideline for Identifying an Information System as a National Security System).11
Federal Agencies
Federal agencies are required to comply with the provisions defined in FISMA. As 
part of their obligation, they must ensure for the protection of federal information

and information systems commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm result­
ing from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruc­
tion [2]. This includes complying with information security standards12 for non-NSSs 
and standards and guidelines13 for NSSs. Federal agencies must also ensure informa­
tion security is an integrated part of their strategic planning and operational planning 
processes so there is alignment of goals and objectives.
Head of Agency or Equivalent
The Head of the Agency (or the highest-level senior official), in an effort to estab­
lish commitment and accountability for information security, was given the respon­
sibility for ensuring senior agency officials (e.g., authorizing officials) provide for 
the protection of federal information and information systems for which they have 
budgetary oversight, or which support the mission and/or business operations [3]. 
Protections include:
• 
Conducting risk assessments;
• 
Categorizing information and information systems;
• 
Implementing security policies and procedures; and
• 
Periodically testing and evaluating security controls and techniques.
The Head of the Agency must ensure security policies, procedures, and practices 
are adequate. To support this requirement, the Head of the Agency is required to 
designate a Federal Agency CIO with the authority for the compliance of FISMA. 
The Federal Agency CIO, in turn, designates his or her IT security responsibilities to 
a Senior Agency Information Security Officer (SAISO),14 who is both qualified and 
trained in information security. These IT security responsibilities include:
• 
Developing and maintaining an information security program;
• 
Developing and maintaining information security policies, procedures, and 
controls;
• 
Training and overseeing personnel with significant information security respon­
sibilities; and
• 
Assisting authorizing officials.

Telecommunications and Information Systems.”
14In most federal agencies the title for this role is the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

108
CHAPTER 5  Applying the NIST Risk Management Framework
Federal Agency Information Security Program
Federal agencies are also required to establish an agency-wide information security 
program. The program developed by the federal agency must address the following 
requirements:
• 
Security awareness training;
• 
Risk assessments;
• 
Policies and procedures;
• 
Integration of security into the system development lifecycle;
• 
Compliance programs that include security planning, testing, and remediation;
• 
Incident response capability; and
• 
Continuity of operations planning.
Federal Agency Independent Evaluations and Reporting
On an annual basis, federal agencies are required by law to conduct an independent 
evaluation of their information security program to ensure its effectiveness. The inde­
pendent evaluations involve the testing of the effectiveness of the organization’s poli­
cies, procedures, and practices, and an assessment compliance with FISMA, 
including any supporting federal policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines. The 
results of the independent evaluations are sent through the Head of the Agency to the 
Director of OMB. The Director of OMB includes information from all independent 
evaluations across the federal government and develops a comprehensive summary 
in a government-wide report that is submitted to Congress.15
15OMB reports to Congress no later than March 1st of each year.
TIP
To support federal agencies in evaluating their programs, NIST developed the Program 
Review for Information Security Management Assistance (PRISMA).16 The PRISMA 
methodology uses “a standardized approach to review and measure the information 
security posture of an information security program” [4]. The PRISMA process includes 11 
steps that cover both preparation and execution.
Preparation Steps:
• Review initiation.
• Review scope definition.
• Planning.
• Kickoff meeting.
Execution Steps:
• Review execution.
• Review documentation.

Risk Management Framework Overview
RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW
The NIST RMF17 is a flexible, risk-based approach that is driven by the organiza­
tion’s information security program, and supports the management of risk18 by facili­
tating the sharing19 of information. The NIST RMF objectives [4] include:
• 
Building information security capabilities into federal information systems;
• 
Maintaining awareness of the security state of information systems through 
ongoing continuous monitoring; and
• 
Providing essential information to key stakeholders to facilitate decisions 
regarding the acceptance of risk.
Risk management is an essential element of the NIST RMF, which requires linking 
risks to an organization-wide information security program. This enables the organi­
zation to have a broader view of risks, including those across all information systems 
within the enterprise. Since the NIST RMF is a more technical approach, organiza­
tions will need to ensure risk-based decisions are considered from a strategic view­
point where the impact to the organization’s goals and objectives is more visible.
For the NIST RMF to be effective, the organization needs to identify and commu­
nicate program-level security requirements that all information systems within the 
enterprise should meet. This also limits the duplication of risk management activities 
17The NIST RMF was developed by the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative (JTFTI) Working 
Group, a partnership with stakeholders from the US Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Com-
munity (IC), and NIST, as a common framework for government-wide risk management.

lication (SP) 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal 
Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and 
Technology; 2010. “Risk management can be viewed as a holistic activity that is fully integrated into 
every aspect of the organization—from senior leaders providing the strategic vision and top-level goals 
and objectives for the organization, to mid-level leaders planning and managing projects, to individu-
als on the front lines developing, implementing, and operating the systems supporting the organiza-
tion’s core missions and business processes.”

CHAPTER 5  Applying the NIST Risk Management Framework
where common capabilities can be integrated or even shared by each information 
system within the overall organization-wide information security program. In this 
section, we will briefly discuss the role of the risk management when applying the 
NIST RMF and how closely aligning the system development life cycle (SDLC) pro­
cesses enables security-related information produced during the SDLC to be reused 
to support the risk management process.
The Role of Risk Management
The effective application of the NIST RMF requires the integration of risk manage­
ment20 activities at different levels within an organization. As illustrated in Figure 5.1, 
the risk management process begins at the organizational level (Tier 1) where the 
governance structure and risk management strategy are developed.
The risk management strategy21 supports the organization’s strategic goals and objec­
tives. To link the risk management strategy with the mission and business processes (Tier 2), 
risk management should be addressed as a part of the enterprise architecture.22 Finally, at the 
information system level (Tier 3), the appropriate safeguards and countermeasures are 
applied to the information and information system through the selection, implementation, 
and assessment of security controls that have traceability to the security requirements estab­
lished by the organization and allocated within the information security architecture. This 
alignment between the NIST RMF and the SDLC is critical to ensure there is an early inte­
gration of security with the appropriate inputs from stakeholders across the organization.
The NIST RMF and the System Development Life Cycle
As previously discussed, the alignment of activities included in the NIST RMF with 
a traditional SDLC23 ensures risk management becomes an integrated part of the

information system life cycle. At each phase of the SDLC, as illustrated in Figure 5.2, 
specific security considerations are integrated, starting at the initiation phase where 
requirements definition begins.
Security requirements24 addressed later within the SDLC instead of including them 
in the original system design could unnecessarily increase costs and delay the authori­
zation process. By defining NIST RMF activities within the context of the system 
development process, weaknesses and deficiencies identified early in the SDLC could 
improve the effectiveness of security testing performed later in the NIST RMF (e.g., 
assessing and monitoring security controls). Since information systems typically exist 
at some phase of the SDLC and will continue to evolve throughout their life cycle, 
integrating the NIST RMF into the life cycle process enables risks to be mitigated or 
eliminated through information security and risk management–related activities. For 
example, the security-related information produced through development security test­
ing may be reused later in SDLC (e.g., implementation/assessment or the operation/
maintenance phases).
NIST RMF PROCESS
The NIST RMF is a task-oriented process that is driven by the risk management 
activities applied at all levels of the organization. The tasks addressed within the 
NIST RMF include different risk-related activities that support the organization’s 
risk management strategy. Since Chapter 6 will cover enterprise-wide risk manage­
ment in more detail, this chapter will limit the focus of risk management as it relates 
to the information system (Tier 3), as shown in Figure 5.1. The risk management 
activities included in Figure 5.3 involve applying the steps included within the NIST 
RMF as a part of a security life cycle approach. The steps performed within the NIST 
RMF include:
• 
categorize the information and information system,
• 
select the security control baseline,
• 
implement the selected security controls,
• 
assess the security controls,
• 
authorize information system operation, and
• 
monitor the security controls.

NIST RMF Process
Information System Categorization
The categorization of the information system is the first step in the NIST RMF 
(Step 1), and one of the most essential activities25 required for the selection of a 
baseline set of security controls (and privacy controls, where applicable). As dis­
cussed earlier in the chapter, FISMA tasked NIST with the responsibility to develop 
standards and guidelines. The standards included procedures for categorizing infor­
mation and information systems, and the guidelines for categorizing the different 
types26 of federal information that will be processed, stored, or transmitted within 
the information system. The first step in the NIST RMF (Step 1), as shown 
in Table 5.1, includes three major tasks. In this section, the discussion will primar­
ily focus on the first task (1-1).
The security categorization process is driven by the need for federal agencies (or 
others operating on behalf of federal agencies) to identify the types of information27 
that will be processed, stored, or transmitted in the information system, a critical 
requirement for understanding the security objectives (confidentiality,28 integrity,29 
and availability30). In addition, the security categorization process also ensures the

selected security controls implemented provide the adequate security31 to meet the 
organization’s security objectives. As will be discussed in detail in this chapter, the 
application of a standardized approach to categorizing information systems enables a 
common framework to be used across the federal government for the management 
and oversight of information systems and in reports relating to agency-specific infor­
mation security to OMB and government-wide information security to Congress.
The application of the security categorization process becomes complex when 
external information system services32 are used by federal agencies in processing, 
transmitting, or storing information collected or maintained on behalf of the federal 
government. In these instances, a federal agency’s reliance upon an external service 
does not limit its overall responsibility for ensuring the security categorization of the 
external service being used is consistent with the different types of information that 
will be used within the service to support its mission or business needs. Without an 
understanding of the security categorization of the information being used in the exter­
nal service, the federal agency will not be able to determine the necessary requirements

level consistent with the federal agency’s minimum assurance requirements.
Relationship Between the NIST RMF and the Federal Enterprise 
Architecture
The enterprise architecture is a management practice employed to maximize the effec­
tiveness of mission/business process and information resources [5]. As illustrated in 
Figure 5.4, the enterprise assets identified within the enterprise architecture are mapped 
to the individual federal agency’s mission and business processes through the reference 
models provided in the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA)33 and the resulting seg­
ment architecture.34 The application of the mapping ensures the information resources 
are properly aligned with each federal agency’s strategic goals and objectives.
The relationship between the federal agency’s enterprise architecture35 and the 
application of the NIST RMF begins with the initial security categorization. Security 
categorization provides a vital step in integrating security into the business and infor­
mation technology management functions and establishes the foundation for infor­
mation security standardization.36 The security categorization process is largely 
dependent upon the knowledge of the information supporting the federal govern­
ment. By utilizing a framework similar to the one depicted in Figure 5.5, the security 
categorization process is adopted as an enterprise-level viewpoint for “each type of 
information as identified from the FEA Performance Reference Model (PRM)37 and 
Business Reference Model (BRM)38 analysis” [6]. This produces a government-wide

NIST RMF Process
Shared Responsibility and the Chain of Trust
In general, the application of the NIST RMF requires a shared responsibility and a 
chain of trust.39 The relationship between federal agencies and service providers 
requires operating through terms and conditions defined in a contract, which includes 
detailed security control requirements, or managed through a service level agreement 
(SLA).40 Service providers handling federal information or operating information 
systems on behalf of the federal government must meet the same security require­
ments as federal agencies [3]. Therefore, the security categorization of the informa­
tion can provide a common understanding of the security objectives that drive the 
selection and compensation of security control requirements that need to be imple­
mented. The security categorization process also ensures service providers have 
some knowledge of the types of information that will be processed and the potential 
overall impact to the federal government should certain adverse events occur.
Service providers have a responsibility in maintaining an adequate level of secu­
rity to protect the information throughout the service life cycle. However, the overall 
responsibility to ensure that sufficient security exists to meet the information protec­
tion requirements falls on the authorizing official.41 For a chain of trust, operating 
under a shared responsibility model, to exist between the federal government and 
service providers, confidence needs to be gained through an understanding of the 
security controls implemented in the service and its environment. This confidence is 
achieved by verifiable and credible evidence that the security controls are operating 
effectively. Trust becomes even more important under complex consumer-provider 
relationships that are introduced such as multi-vendor situations. By establishing a 
clear definition of the security objectives, an analysis42 can be performed to determine

which participant, consumer or provider, would be most appropriate to implement 
the necessary security controls based on the differing degrees of ownership and con­
trol over the information system.
Overview of the Security Categorization Process
The goal of the security categorization process is to understand, identify, and catego­
rize both the information and information systems used to process, store, or transmit 
the information, so that an appropriate level of information security can be applied. 
The level of information security is determined, in part, through an assessment of the 
potential impact43 to the information in the event that there was a compromise (e.g., 
breach of security) which caused a loss in confidentiality, integrity, or availability. 
The results of this process enable federal agencies to understand and communicate 
their protection requirements as a consequence (e.g., degradation of primary mission 
functions or capabilities, financial loss, etc.) to an adverse impact to their mission 
and business processes. In addition, by managing the risk at the enterprise level, the 
information security needs can be applied more effectively across the federal govern­
ment by an aggregation of the sensitivity/criticality of information using a standard­
ized and common language. This ensures information systems supporting multiple 
federal agency mission areas or supporting federal agencies as a shared business 
service44 operate based on the highest level of impact to the federal government.
The security categorization process requires input from across all stakeholders. For 
this process to be successful the federal agency needs to ensure coordination and col­
laboration exist among all parties involved (e.g., information owners, information secu­
rity practitioners, enterprise architects, capital planning, etc.). Since the output of this 
process will be an input to the remaining steps in the NIST RMF (Steps 2–6), oversight 
is critical to ensure any errors can be validated to prevent or minimize overprotection or 
potentially increasing organizational risk by underprotecting the information resources.
Before the categorization process can begin, information to support the categori­
zation process needs to be collected, including the specific organizational-specific 
policies, procedures, and other relevant documentation relating to risk management 
that would help the organization understand impacts associated with the loss of con­
fidentiality, integrity, and availability. As depicted in Figure 5.6, the categorization 
process is a multi-step activity that begins with the identification of information types 
and concludes with the assignment of security categories and impact levels to

information and information systems45 that will be used as the basis for establishing 
the initial baseline set of security controls.
Identify Information Types
In July 2001, OMB issued Citizen-Centered E-Government: Developing the Action 
Plan,46 which established an E-Government Task Force to “identify priority actions 
that achieve strategic improvements in government and set in motion a transformation 
of government around citizen needs” [9]. The task force published the E-Government 
Strategy47 which focused on achieving improvements across multiple business areas 
of service within the federal government and reforming the efficiency and effective­
ness of the federal government’s interaction with individual citizens, businesses, 
other state and local governments, and even internally within the federal government 
itself. As part of the assessment48 performed by the task force, a business architecture, 
shown in Figure 5.7, was created as a framework to “describe how the federal govern­
ment interfaces with citizens, what functions and lines of business the government 
performs, and the key business processes used” [9].
As the foundation for the FEA BRM,49 the FEA Program Management Office 
(FEAPMO) “leveraged previous Federal architecture efforts, in particular the business 
architecture designed as a part of the 2001 e-government Task Force’s effort, as starting 
points for designing the government-wide model” [10]. Since its initial release, the busi­
ness architecture has been through multiple revisions. The BRM version 2.0, depicted 
in Figure 5.8, reflects four business areas (functions): services for citizens, mode of 
delivery, support delivery of services, and management of government resources. The 
BRM is a framework that uses a structured tiered hierarchical representation for describ­
ing the common business areas within the federal government.
The federal government’s dependence on information technology (IT) to support 
various mission and business functions requires federal agencies to understand the 
appropriate security controls that need to be implemented. The security controls are

security (i.e., a loss of confidentiality) [7]. Therefore, the first step in the security 
categorization process requires the identification of information types be processed, 
transmitted, or stored in the information system. Since the BRM is periodically

CHAPTER 5  Applying the NIST Risk Management Framework
functions across the federal government, NIST used the BRM as the basis for the 
taxonomy of information types51 for federal agencies to reference52 when mapping 
the information types used in the information system. The integration of the enter­
prise architecture developed by the federal agency can provide a useful starting 
point to ensure the categorization is consistent with the mission and business 
objectives.
Select Provisional Impact Values for Each Information Type
Once the information types have been identified and documented, the provisional 
impact levels need to be selected and assigned to the security objectives of each 
information type. The provisional impact levels53 are based on the potential impacts 
included in Table 5.2. From the provisional impact levels, an initial security catego­
rization is characterized using the following format:
51From Stine, K., Kissel, R., Barker, W., Fahlsing, J., Gulick, J. NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-60 
Revision 1, Volume I: Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security 
Categories. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2008. NIST Special Publica-
tion (SP) 800-60 (Volume I & II) provides guidelines for agencies to use in categorizing information 
and information systems by “recommending the types of information and information systems to be 
included in each such category of potential impact.”
52There are instances where information used in an information system may not be captured in the 
BRM, which will require federal agencies to conduct additional research when characterizing the 
information so that appropriate impact levels can be assigned to the security categories.
53The provisional impact for each information type is documented in Volume II of NIST SP 800-60.
TIP
The types of activities [8] associated with the identification of information types are:
•  Document the agency’s business and mission areas.
•  Identify all of the information types that are input, stored, processed, and/or output 
from each system.
•  Identify Mission-based Information Type categories based on supporting FEA Lines 
of Business.
•  As applicable, identify Management and Support Information Type categories based 
on supporting FEA Lines of Business.
•  Specify applicable sub-functions for the identified Mission-based and Management 
and Support categories.
•  As necessary, identify other required information types.
•  Document applicable information types for the identified information system along with 
the basis for the information type selection.
Security Category information type = {(confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability, 
impact)}

the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the 
effectiveness of the functions is significantly reduced; (ii) result in 
significant damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in 
significant financial loss; or (iv) result in significant harm to 
individuals that does not involve loss of life or serious life-
threatening injuries
High
•	
The potential impact is high if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, 
or availability could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic 
adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational 
assets, or individuals
•	
A severe or catastrophic adverse effect means that, for example, 
the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability might: (i) cause 
a severe degradation in or loss of mission capability to an extent 
and duration that the organization is not able to perform one 
or more of its primary functions; (ii) result in major damage to 
organizational assets; (iii) result in major financial loss; or (iv) 
result in severe or catastrophic harm to individuals involving loss 
of life or serious life-threatening injuries
NOTE
The types of activities [8] associated with the selection of provisional impact levels are:
• Select the security impact levels for the identified information types from the 
recommended provisional impact levels for each identified information type or from 
FIPS 199 criteria.
• Determine the security category (SC) for each information type: SC information type =

• Document the provisional impact level of confidentiality, integrity, and availability 
associated with the system’s information type.

CHAPTER 5  Applying the NIST Risk Management Framework
Adjust the Information Type’s Provisioning Impact Value and Security 
Category
After the provisional impact levels have been selected, adjustments can be applied 
(as required) to the information types using information about the information sys­
tem’s environment such as the federal agency’s mission, how the information will be 
used, and interfaces with other systems outside of the authorization boundary54 (or 
information system boundary). Other considerations might also include special fac­
tors specific to each security category as it applies to the organization or individuals55 
should a specific breach of security occur. When all of the adjustments to the provi­
sional impact levels have been made for an information type, the highest impact 
value from each of the selected security objectives becomes the overall security 
categorization for the information type. As an example, the security categorization 
for the following information type would be Moderate (see Table 5.3).

The types of activities [8] associated with the review of the provisional impact levels and 
the adjustment and finalization of the information impact levels include:
• Reviewing the appropriateness of the provisional impact levels based on the 
organization, environment, mission, use, and data sharing.
• Adjusting the impact levels (as necessary) based on confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability factors, situational and operational drivers (timing, lifecycle, etc.), and legal 
or statutory reasons.
• Documenting all adjustments to the impact levels and providing the rationale or 
justification for the adjustments.

Determine the System Security Impact Level
The final step in the security categorization process is the assignment of an overall 
security impact level56 to the information system using the high-water mark.57 As an 
example, the security categorization for the following information system would be 
Moderate.
However, similar to the focus on adjusting security categories for information 
types, the system security objectives can also be adjusted based on the application 
of several factors such as the aggregation of different types of data (change of the 
information sensitivity when integrated with other information types) and critical

system functionality (interconnection of the system with other information sys­
tems and the dependence of the information by other information systems to sup­
port a specific mission/business function). In addition, there are other factors that 
relate to the specific context of the information and the information system (e.g., 
information that would be subject to privacy laws and policies, supporting infra­
structure that stores, processes, or transmits (flows) information within or across 
the network or system components).
Security Control Selection
The security control selection is the next step in the NIST RMF (Step 2) and 
includes three major tasks, included in Table 5.4. In this section, most of the focus 
will be spent on the second and third task. The second task includes the security 
control selection process which begins with the initial security control baseline58 
and concludes with a final set of security controls that will be implemented.59 The 
third task involves the development of a strategy to monitor the selected security 
controls as part of an information security continuous monitoring (ISCM)60 
program.
The initial security control baseline consists of a minimum set of security require­
ments derived from among the 1761 security-related areas included in Table 5.5. “The 
17 areas represent a broad-based, balanced information security program that 
addresses the management, operational, and technical aspects of protecting federal 
information and information systems” [13]. The determination of which require­
ments from within each area will be included in the initial security control baseline 
is based on the impact level for the information system following the security 
categorization process in the NIST RMF (Step 1).

selection of the initial security control baseline. Once the baseline has been ­determined, 
the next step involves tailoring the initial security control baseline. As illustrated in

part of the organization’s risk management process.62,63 In addition, any changes to the 
baseline need to be supported by documentation64 that addresses decisions made for 
adjusting the initial security control baseline such as through an assessment of risk 
within the information system and operating environment.
Tailoring the Initial Baseline
The tailoring process involves the customization of the initial security control baseline. 
This process uses three mechanisms to adjust the baseline to more closely align the secu­
rity control requirements to the actual information system and/or operating environment:
• 
Scoping guidance—specific terms and conditions on the applicability and 
implementation of specific security controls;
• 
Compensating security controls—management, operational, and technical 
controls implemented in lieu of an identified security controls in the initial 
security control baseline;
• 
Organization-defined parameters—parameters applied to portions of a security 
control to support specific organization requirements or objectives.
In addition, the concept of overlays65 provides a process for tailoring based on an 
organizational-specific set of security controls that have been identified to supple­
ment the baseline for a community-wide use or to address specialized requirements, 
technologies, or unique missions/environments of operation [20]. For example, the 
Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) utilizes the secu­
rity controls for low- and moderate-impact information systems and contains con­
trols and enhancements above the NIST baseline that addresses the unique elements 
deemed necessary for the government-wide use of cloud computing [21].
Applying Scoping Considerations
Scoping ensures security requirements are identified for providing an adequate level of 
protection by providing specific security terms and conditions for addressing the imple­
mentation of security controls based on the organization’s mission and business processes 
supported by the information system. In addition, the application of scoping guidance can

63Tailoring decisions should be documented in the security plan (or a related document).

4 (Initial Public Draft), Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information System and Organiza-
tions. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2012. “The level of detail required 
in documenting tailoring decisions in the security control selection process is at the discretion of orga-
nizations and reflects the FIPS 199 impact levels of the respective information systems implementing 
or inheriting the controls.”

set of security controls, control enhancements, and supplemental guidance derived from the applica-
tion of tailoring guidance.”

135
NIST RMF Process
ensure security controls are cost-effectively and efficiently applied by eliminating unnec­
essary security controls. There are several scoping considerations that can be applied 
when adjusting the initial security control baseline to the environment of operation:
• 
Use of common controls;66
• 
Downgrading security controls for those that do not uniquely attribute to high-water 
mark for the security objectives (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, or availability);
• 
Allocation of security controls applicable to specific information system 
components;
• 
Removal of security controls that are technology dependent;
• 
Application of security control for those areas that support the physical infra­
structure used to provide direct protection;
• 
Employment of security controls based on the laws, directives, policies, etc. 
that govern the information types and the information system;
• 
Employment of security controls that are consistent with the assumption about 
the operational environment;
• 
Implementation of security controls based on the scalability associated with the 
specific impact level; and
• 
Application of security controls where public access is granted.
Selecting Compensating Security Controls
Compensation is the function of implementing one or more security controls in lieu 
of a security control in the initial security control baseline. Although there are many 
circumstances that could occur where compensation would be required, the most 
important aspect of using compensation is to have a clear understanding of the risks 
66From Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative Interagency Working Group. NIST Special Pub-
lication (SP) 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal 
Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and 
Technology; 2010. “Common controls are security controls that are inherited by one or more organi-
zational information systems.”
NOTE
Compensating controls should only be employed if [12]:
• The organization selects the compensating control from NIST Special Publication 800-
53, or if an appropriate compensating control is not available, the organization adopts 
a suitable compensating control from another source;
• The organization provides supporting rationale for how the compensating control 
delivers an equivalent security capability for the information system and why the 
related baseline security control could not be employed; and
• The organization assesses and formally accepts the risk associated with employing the 
compensating control in the information system.

136
CHAPTER 5  Applying the NIST Risk Management Framework
associated with not implementing the recommended security control. The compen­
sating security control(s) should provide, at minimum, a comparable level of protec­
tion and mitigate any risk introduced through the removal of the control from the 
initial security control baseline.
Assigning Security Control Parameter Values
Organization-defined parameters are included in portions of security controls to 
offer flexibility in the implementation. The parameters enable the security control 
requirements to be completed with specific values that could come from within the 
organization or as prescribed by federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, and poli­
cies that govern the type of information or information system, or other sources 
such as industry “best practices.” In situations where the prescribed parameters are 
more restrictive, they should be applied to the maximum extent possible. In addi­
tion, if there are variations to recommended parameters, the differences should be 
documented to ensure the organization has some understanding of the risk and can 
apply the necessary compensating controls to mitigate risks that are determined to 
be unacceptable.
Supplementing the Tailored Baseline
Once the initial baseline has been tailored (if necessary), the tailored baseline (or 
initial baseline if no tailoring was performed) should be reviewed to ensure it ­provides 
the adequate protection and any identified organization risk67 that exists is mitigated. 
Enhancing security control baselines by selecting additional security controls or sup­
plementing the baseline security controls with enhancements can be accomplished 
through the definition of requirements or conducting a gap analysis. Requirements 
definition involves an evaluation of the risk assessment to establish requirements. 
Therefore, a gap analysis focuses on characterizing the security requirements through 
an assessment of the existing security capabilities and ­determining the types of 
threats that can likely be prevented. As an example, Figure 5.10 provides an illustra­
tion of the framework in which “to effectively withstand cyber attacks from adversar­
ies with the stated capabilities or attack potential, the organization strives to achieve 
a certain level of security capability or cyber preparedness”68 [12]. However, in either 
approach, the goal is to use the information from the analysis to identify security 
67From Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 
3, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information System and Organizations. Maryland: 
National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2010. The risk assessment provides important inputs 
to determine the sufficiency of the security controls.
68Cyber preparedness, in general, is the process of characterizing the threat source’s intent and motiva-
tions to ensure a commensurate level of security capabilities exists to defend against an attack. NIST 
Special Publication (SP) 800-30 Revision 1, Appendix D (“Threat Sources”) provides an example of a 
threat taxonomy that can be used as a starting point for building a tailored list of threat sources.

137
NIST RMF Process
controls and/or enhancements which will be required to attain the appropriate level 
of preparedness.
Documenting the Tailoring and Supplementation Process
The rationale for the decisions made throughout the tailoring and supplementation 
process resulting in an adjustment to the initial security control baseline should 
be documented. Table 5.6 provides an example of the type of information that 
should be used when tailoring the security control baseline and for determining if 
any impacts would occur to a federal agency’s mission or business based on the 
changes in the security control baseline. In addition, the information documented 
could be used by the authorizing official to make a credible, risk-based decision as 
part of the authorization step of the NIST RMF (Step 5). This information is also 
important for understanding any risk-based decisions that were made so they can 
be evaluated if any changes occur during the monitoring step of the NIST RMF 
(Step 6).

CHAPTER 5  Applying the NIST Risk Management Framework
Continuous Monitoring Strategy
Continuous monitoring planning69 starts with the development of a continuous monitor­
ing strategy70 during the security control selection process. During this step, the strategy 
focuses on defining “how changes to the information system will be monitored and how 
the security impact analyses will be conducted” [3]. In addition, the strategy includes 
the identification of any volatile security controls and the frequency at which those secu­
rity controls should be monitored over time. This also requires establishing the approach 
for conducting assessments (e.g., automated techniques and tools such as Secure Con­
tent Automation Protocol (SCAP),71 architectures to support dynamic monitoring and 
reporting such as the Continuous Asset Evaluation, Situational, Awareness, and Risk 
Scoring (CAESARS)72 Framework Extension (FE),73 and manual assessments).
Allocating Security Controls
Defining the information system boundary74 during the security categorization pro­
cess requires understanding the scope of protection for the system components allo­
cated to the information system and interfaces between interconnected systems. This 
boundary definition activity is critical for fully understanding and clarifying any

a high-level illustration of the potential flow of information when allocating security 
controls, and when assigning ownership for common capabilities that support more 
than one information system (i.e., common controls or portions of controls in a 
hybrid controls situation). In addition, establishing a definition of the authorization 
boundary and the level of control of the resources can provide a clear delineation of 
the specific security controls being inherited such as system components which may 
be used by an organization, but may be outside the direct control of the authorizing 
official. For security control allocation to be successful, in most cases it requires 
building trusted relationships based on the sharing of evidence that specific security 
controls are implemented correctly and operating effectively, including any 
assessment results (or a summary) and information collected as part of an ongoing 
continuous monitoring program. The sharing of information ensures changes that 
could impact the information system inheriting the common controls (or hybrid 
portions) are understood and any identified risks through the risk management 
process can be accepted or mitigated through the application of compensating 
controls.
Decomposition
Decomposition enables complex information systems and security controls to be 
allocated among more manageable subsystems,77 thereby enabling subsystems to be 
viewed independently78 and security controls can be allocated based on security 
objectives or common capabilities or functions in the information system architec­
ture. This type of approach could also more effectively focus security controls to 
achieve a more cost-effective application of the risk management processes such as 
conducting assessments79 and ongoing continuous monitoring. Subsystems may be 
dynamic, where they may be provisioned or de-provisioned rapidly as required, or 
may not reside within the information system but only at a specific point in the infor­
mation system lifecycle. In other cases, the subsystems may be controlled and

managed by a service provider outside of the authorization boundary or outside of 
the control of the organization. In these situations, establishing subsystems enables 
parts of the information system that are more volatile or not within the control of the 
federal agency or service provider to be monitored differently based on the federal 
agency’s assurance requirements to ensure required security controls continue to 
operate at an acceptable level of risk over time.
Security Controls Implementation
In this step of the NIST RMF (Step 3), both the tasks included in Table 5.7 will be 
covered together due to their close relationship (i.e., implementation of the security 
controls and documentation of their implementation may occur concurrently). To 
enable the efficient and cost-effective implementation of security controls, some 
NOTE
What is the purpose of the system security plan?
“The purpose of the system security plan is to provide an overview of the security 
requirements of the system and describe the controls in place or planned for meeting 
those requirements. The system security plan also delineates responsibilities and expected 
behavior of all individuals who access the system. The system security plan should be 
viewed as documentation of the structured process of planning adequate, cost-effective 
security protection for a system” [3].

CHAPTER 5  Applying the NIST Risk Management Framework
knowledge of the existing and target information security architecture80 may be 
required. The information security architecture serves to influence security controls 
allocated to system components within the information system during the security 
control selection process. In addition, the allocation of security controls should be 
based on “best practices” focused on identifying specific system components for pro­
viding a security capability. 
Documenting the security control implementation in the security plan provides a 
functional description of the security controls (i.e., planned inputs, expected behavior, 
and expected outputs) both from an organizational perspective (management and oper­
ational security controls) and a system perspective (operational and technical security 
controls). In addition, the security plan documents a description of any inheritance 
(common security controls), shared ownership (hybrid security controls), and the sys­
tem-specific security controls allocated to system components within the information 
system boundary. The level of detail for documenting security controls implementa­
tion should commensurate with the impact level assigned to the information system, 
but should at least provide traceability of decisions prior to and after deployment of the 
information system and be sufficient to support control assessment [3].
Implementing and Documenting Security Controls
As discussed earlier in the chapter, the integration of security early in the SDLC enables 
architects and engineers to integrate security controls into the information security 
architecture81 by applying overlapping, defense-in-depth protective layers,82 through 
the use of security engineering principles,83 and secure coding ­methodologies.84 Addi­
tionally, the implementation of risk management activities (e.g., ­development testing

tions. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2012. “The information security 
architecture includes an architectural description, the placement/allocation of security functionality, 
security-related information for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the inter-
faces, and the protection mechanisms associated with each interface.”
81In a legacy information system, a “gap analysis” can be used to understand any limitation in the 
existing information security architecture where security controls are not functioning properly so that 
corrective actions can be planned and compensating controls can be identified to provide adequate 
protection for any unacceptable risks.

and evaluation85) ensures information security planning is performed in parallel with 
the information system development to identify any weaknesses and deficiencies that 
will need to be mitigated, thereby maximizing the reuse of the assessment results in 
later phases of the SDLC and achieving a more cost-effective balance between the 
implementation of security controls and the management of risk. In addition, security 
control allocation, both between the security control owners (e.g., common control 
providers) and information system components, requires identifying any dependencies 
from the security control selection process. This activity is essential to ensure any 
changes to the planned security controls resulting from the infeasibility or impractica­
bility of their implementation can be updated in the security plan documentation to 
capture any risk-based decision-making and accurately describe compensating 
security controls that will be implemented to minimize the impact associated with 
unacceptable risks.
Security Controls Assessment
The security controls implemented and documented in the previous steps are essen­
tial components for conducting an effective assessment.86 The security controls 
assessment step in the NIST RMF (Step 4) involves the preparation, execution, and 
reporting of the security controls effectiveness in the information system. This sec­
tion will summarize the assessment-related tasks in Table 5.8. The assessment tasks 
are dependent on the close collaboration and cooperation of the security assessor87 
and the organization to ensure there is an appropriate level of depth88 and coverage89

Assessment Preparation
Prior to beginning the assessment activities, expectations should be appropriately set 
through the development of a security assessment plan. Preparatory activities should 
be planned together, by the organization undergoing the assessment and the pro­
vider conducting the assessment, to limit any unexpected issues and to gain a clear 
understanding of the level of effort required. Figure 5.12 provides an example list of 
preparatory activities that guide the completion of the assessment plan. In addition, 
the organization should also provide the security assessor with the following types 
of information:

Security Assessment Plan
Planning activities are critical for the success of the security assessment. The security 
assessment plan (SAP), 91 developed by the security assessor, should be reviewed 
and approved by the organization based on an agreement of what is in scope for the 
assessment. Similar to Step 2, where the organization selects, tailors, and supple­
ments security controls to be implemented, the security assessor should also perform 
similar activities by selecting, tailoring, and supplementing assessment procedures 
that address specific assurance requirements by the organization.

TIP
Select, Tailor, Customize, Optimize
As a guide, and to improve the effectiveness in executing assessments, an assessor should 
seek to find ways to save time and money when conducting assessments through the 
following steps [17]:
• Select assessment methods92 and objects that match the assurance requirements.
• Select the appropriate depth and coverage attributes.93
• Identify common controls to reduce redundancy and duplication of effort.
• Customize security-specific assessment procedures to closely match the operating 
environment (and utilizing supplemental guidance in the NIST Security Controls 
Catalog to establish an intent of the security control).
• Identify assessment results that are applicable for reuse (previous assessments) or 
through more efficiency in sequencing the current assessment.
• Adjust assessment procedures to accommodate external service providers based on 
contracts or service level agreements.
• Develop assessment procedures94 for custom security controls.
• Identify areas where assessment procedures can be combined and consolidated to 
maximize cost savings without compromising quality.
92Examine, interview, and test.
93Basic, focused, and comprehensive.
94In situations where security controls not included in Security Control Catalog (NIST Special Publica-
tion (SP) 800-53, Appendix F) were included in the security control baseline, the assessor may have 
to develop custom security assessment procedures. In these situations, NIST Special Publication (SP) 
800-53A can be used as a guide.

147
NIST RMF Process
Assessing Security Controls
Conducting security assessments,95 which will be discussed in more detail in 
later chapters, is described briefly in this section. The security assessment 
­execution is primarily organized and executed by the security assessor, with the 
organization’s support. Therefore, the key focus will be on making the assurance 
case.96
When conducting the security assessment, the security assessor needs to obtain 
evidence97 to facilitate the security assessor in making an objective determination of 
security control effectiveness, based on the criteria (i.e., expect input, behavior, and 
outcome) identified in the assessment procedures. Since the key focus will be on 
making the assurance case, the evidence should come directly from the information 
system or operating environment, or from a third-party evaluation of the product or 
technology such as a common criteria evaluation.98 In addition, automated tools and 
techniques could be used to improve the quality of the security assessment through 
an increase in the sampling size and coverage.
Reporting Assessment Results
Reporting on the security control assessment results, including any issues, weak­
nesses and deficiencies, and recommendations, is performed through the security 
assessment report (SAR).99 The SAR works together with the security plan (includ­
ing risk assessment) and POA&Ms to provide an overall picture of the security state 
and risk posture for the information system. The specific reporting format for secu­
rity assessment results is organizationally dependent, but should provide enough 
detail to enable the authorizing official to establish a credible, risk-based decision. In 
addition to findings, the SAR also includes key recommendations for addressing the 
findings.100 Evidence produced during the security assessment should be retained by

the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the 
desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the information system.”

Information System Authorization
The next step in the NIST RMF (Step 5) concludes with an authorization decision102 
for the information system to operate (or continue to operate, for legacy systems). 
This section will present the tasks outlined in Table 5.9, with primary emphasis being 
placed on planning corrective actions and the authorization process.
Corrective Action Planning
The POA&Ms103 receive input from the SAR, and is one of three key documents 
presented in the authorization package to the authorizing official. The POA&Ms 
include a set of tasks focused on correcting weaknesses or deficiencies discov­
ered during the security controls assessment,104 or security testing (e.g., periodic 
­vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, etc.). In addition, POA&Ms docu­
ment corrective actions for security weaknesses and deficiencies found during 
other types of reviews done by, for, or on behalf of the federal agency, including 
GAO audits, financial system audits, and critical infrastructure vulnerability 
­assessments [18].

Developing a Risk Mitigation Strategy
A strategy for risk mitigation105 planning is important when prioritizing corrective 
actions as part of an organization-wide risk management function. The prioritiza­
tion106 should take input from other activities within the NIST RMF, such as security 
categorization. In addition, other inputs can also influence the risk mitigation strat­
egy, such as the security controls (i.e., where the security weaknesses or deficiencies 
exist), impacts of the weaknesses and deficiencies on the overall security state of the 
information system, and the risk mitigation approach used by the organization to 
address weaknesses and deficiencies [3].

CHAPTER 5  Applying the NIST Risk Management Framework
Documenting POA&Ms
The authorizing official uses POA&Ms as an oversight management tool for tracking 
corrective actions for a specific information system. In addition, the organization can 
also use consolidated POA&Ms from across all of the information system to identify 
common weaknesses and deficiencies to effectively allocate resources for organiza­
tion-wide security improvements. Therefore, POA&Ms should provide enough 
details107 to enable the organization to identify, assess, prioritize, and monitor the 
correction of weaknesses and deficiencies both in federal and contractor systems.108 
POA&M details109 should include:
• 
Brief description of the weakness.110

NIST RMF Process
Security Authorization Approaches
The security authorization process is based on three different approaches.113 The 
first, and most commonly used, is the traditional approach, which involves only one 
authorizing official. In this approach, a single authorizing official has both the 
responsibility and accountability for accepting security risks. 
Next is the joint authorization114 approach, which includes a shared interest, usually 
between multiple authorizing officials because the information system ties directly 
into the strategic mission or business processes. In this approach, the authorizing 
officials are collectively responsible and accountable for accepting the security risks.
The final approach is used when the mission or business processes are supported 
by more than one federal agency. This approach is known as the leveraged authoriza­
tion approach and can be used to authorize an information system, commonly a shared 
service,115 that can be used by more than one agency based on the original authoriza­
tion package without requiring reauthorization by the leveraging organization.
Due to the complexity in implementing the leveraged authorization approach, it 
is the one used least often of the three, but offers the most cost savings.116 The lever­
aging organization, usually through an assigned authorizing official, leverages the 
original authorization117 by accepting the risks, and assesses only those additional

lication (SP) 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal

Technology; 2010. Organizations can choose from three different approaches when planning for and 
conducting security authorizations to include: (i) an authorization with a single authorizing official;

requirements beyond the original security control baseline established by the origi­
nal.118 For example, if the leveraging organization determines there is insufficient 
information in the authorization package or inadequate security measures in place for 
establishing an acceptable level of risk, the leveraging organization may negotiate for 
additional security measures119 and/or security-related information [3].
Another option that may be used by an organization when multiple instances of 
the same information system (or subsystem) are deployed in a number of different 
operational environments is the application of a type authorization [3]. In a type 
authorization a single authorizing package is used to reflect a common view for all of 
the instances deployed across all locations where the information system is hosted 
(also known as site-specific controls120).
Security Authorization Process
The security authorization process is the most involved step in the NIST RMF (Step 
5) because it requires the direct or indirect input from each of the previous steps 
in the NIST RMF (categorization, security control selection, security control 
implementation, and security control assessment) to make the authorization deci­
sion. This process begins with the assembly of the authorization package, where 
the key and supporting documents needed to make the authorization decision 
are prepared. After the security authorization package has been assembled, the 
determination of risk involves an analysis of information gathered from across the 
organization to provide the authorizing official with enough credible information 
to support a risk-based decision.
The authorization package includes both key and supporting documents.121 
Figure 5.13 illustrates the three key minimum documents that are required by the

authorizing official: security plan, SAR, and POA&Ms. These three documents are 
considered the most accurate representation of the security state of the information 
system and are based on information derived from activities performed throughout 
the execution of the NIST RMF.
For security controls inherited in whole or in part by another organization (com­
mon control provider) or an external service provider, security risk–related informa­
tion122 may be shared with the authorizing official to supplement the authorization 
package and assist in making an authorization decision. For all of the key documents 
included in the authorization package, the owner of the information system or pro­
vider of common controls generally has the responsibility of the packaging and sub­
mitting the security authorization package.
Risk determination is a critical activity in the authorization process that involves 
reviewing the documents in the security authorization package. During this activity, 
the authorizing official will likely place significant importance on the security 
assessment report [22], but will also use information gathered through other risk 
management activities to understand the organization’s overall risk exposure123 
from operating the information system. In addition, the authorizing official will 
likely rely upon additional input from the other parts of the organization such as the

assist in making the final determination, in addition to the documents in the security 
authorization package. “The information system-related security risk information 
derived from the execution of the NIST RMF is available to the risk executive 
(function) for use in formulating and updating the organization-wide risk manage­
ment strategy” [3].
The risk determination concludes in a final determination of an authorization 
­decision as defined in Table 5.10. The authorization decision is achieved through a 
balance of the security considerations identified through the execution of the NIST 
RMF, with mission and operational needs for the information system [3]. The security 
considerations are based on the contents of the authorization package, input from the 
risk executive, and any other supporting information as determined by the authorizing 
official.
After the final authorization decision has been made, the decision is communi­
cated to the system owner or common controls provider. The authorization decision 
document includes not only the authorization decision, but may also include any 
applicable terms and conditions125 and a termination date. As an alternative, instead 
of establishing a termination date (time-drive reauthorizations126), the organization 
could also require the implementation of a continuous monitoring program (event-
driven reauthorization127) that provides the capability to continuously make risk

determinations and acceptance. For example, “if the maximum authorization period 
for an information system is three years, then an organization establishes a continu­
ous monitoring strategy for assessing a subset of the security controls employed 
within and inherited by the system during the authorization period. This strategy 
allows all security controls designated in the respective security plans to be assessed 
at least one time by the end of the three-year period” [3].

NOTE
As discussed in OMB Memorandum 11-33, FY 2011 Reporting Instructions for the Federal 
Information Security Management Act and Agency Privacy Management, OMB waived the 
requirements for a reauthorization every three years.
20. Is a security reauthorization still required every three years or when an information 
system has undergone significant change as stated in OMB Circular A 130?128
No. Rather than enforcing a static, three-year reauthorization process, agencies 
are expected to conduct ongoing authorizations of information systems through the 
implementation of continuous monitoring programs. Continuous monitoring programs thus 
fulfill the three year security reauthorization requirement, so a separate re-authorization 
process is not necessary. In an effort to implement a more dynamic, risk-based security 
authorization process, agencies should follow the guidance in NIST Special Publication 
800-37, Revision 1. Agencies should develop and implement continuous monitoring 
strategies for all information systems. Agency officials should monitor the security state 
of their information systems on an ongoing basis with a frequency sufficient to make 
ongoing risk-based decisions on whether to continue to operate the systems within their 
organizations. Continuous monitoring programs and strategies should address: (i) the 
effectiveness of deployed security controls; (ii) changes to information systems and the 
environments in which those systems operate; and (iii) compliance to federal legislation, 
directives, policies, standards, and guidance with regard to information security and risk 
management. Agencies will be required to report the security state of their information 
systems and results of their ongoing authorizations through CyberScope in accordance with 
the data feeds defined by DHS.

157
NIST RMF Process
If a management-driven continuous monitoring strategy is applied during the con­
tinuous monitoring step, the authorization decision can be streamlined. For example, if 
reauthorization actions result in either a time-driven (termination date) or event-driven 
(significant change131) trigger, and information produced as a result of the ongoing 
assessment activities continued to demonstrate the effectiveness of the security con­
trols, the only action required for reauthorization might include making updates to the 
original authorization package and resubmission to the authorizing official for risk 
acceptance.
Security Controls Monitoring
The final step in NIST RMF (Step 6) focuses on those activities that support the 
ongoing authorization of the information system. Through the integration of risk 
management in an organization-wide information security continuous monitor­
ing (ISCM) program, the security state can be monitored on an ongoing basis. The 
discussion on development and maintenance of an ISCM program and on specific 
types of tools, techniques, and technologies will be presented in more detail in later 
chapters. Therefore, this section limits the discussion to cover only those activities 
included in Table 5.11 as they relate to the continuous assessment of security controls 
and updates to risk management documents to support the ongoing risk determina­
tion, mitigation, and acceptance.
Managing information risk on an ongoing basis requires a rigorous organizational 
continuous monitoring132 strategy and program designed to maintain a security 
authorization over an extended period of time. Continuous monitoring is a concept in 
which the security impacts to changes in the information system and the operating 
environment are managed and controlled. In addition to conducting security impact 
analyses, the organization can also use automated tools to provide security status-
related information to organizational officials in “near real-time” in order to assist the 
authorizing official in making cost-effective, risk-based decisions regarding the use 
and operation of the information system. Through a disciplined approach to continu­
ous monitoring, the organization can more efficiently determine the affects on

assessing the impact135 on changes (proposed or actual). The assessment of the 
impact to the security state of the information throughout the SDLC is an important 
part of maintaining an ongoing security authorization. However, not all changes (e.g., 
routine changes or scheduled maintenance) will impact the security state of the infor­
mation system or the environment. Through a consistent application of configuration 
management and controls processes similar to Figure 5.14, all changes going through 
the continuous monitoring process will be required to undergo an assessment of risk 
to support an ongoing authorization based on an understanding of the impacts to 
those changes.
Ongoing Security Controls Assessments
The monitoring strategy is developed during the security control selection step of the 
NIST RMF (Step 2). The strategy is focused on establishing criteria136 for selecting 
which security controls employed within or inherited by the information system 
should be monitored as part of the continuous monitoring program. The determina­
tion of which security controls to assess and the frequency of monitoring requires 
obtaining input from a variety of sources [3] to include:
• 
Risk assessments (including current threat and vulnerability information),
• 
History of cyber attacks,
• 
Results of previous security assessments, and
• 
Operational requirements.
In addition, factors such as security control volatility137 and POA&Ms138 can also 
be useful. For example, “security controls that are subject to the direct effects or side

information system would, therefore, likely be controls with higher volatility” [3].
The continuous assessments of security controls identified for ongoing monitoring 
could produce weaknesses or deficiencies in addition to those discovered during the 
initial security authorization process. These corrective actions (and recommendations) 
will follow a similar strategy for risk mitigation139 planning discussed in the NIST 
RMF (Step 5), including updates in the POA&Ms.140
Key Updates and Status Reporting
During continuous monitoring, results of security control assessments modifications 
to security control implementations, or changes to the information system may 
require updates to key documents in the authorization package.141 Figure 5.12 pro­
vides recommendations on when potential updates may be required for each docu­
ment to support the ongoing authorization of the information system or to facilitate 
near real-time risk management.
On an ongoing basis, results of the continuous monitoring activities are reported 
to the authorizing official by the system owner (or common controls provider). The 
frequency of updates through security status reports may be based on the monitoring 
strategy, and could occur more frequently when significant changes occur to the 
information system or significant deficiencies142 (or material weaknesses) are identi­
fied (see Table 5.12).

Ongoing Risk Determination and Acceptance
The status update reports by the system owner (or common controls provider) are 
reviewed by the authorizing official on an ongoing basis. The status reports are 
coordinated with the organization’s senior information security officer and the risk 
executive that provide input to the authorizing official in determining if the risk to the 
information system continues to be acceptable. The use of automated tools can assist 
in capturing, maintaining, and presenting (i.e., quantifying and visually displaying) 
security status information to support “near real-time” risk management, by com­
municating the overall risk posture. If automation is not available, a summary of the 
key changes to the documents included in the authorization package should be used 
by the authorizing official to understand and determine if changes would affect the 
original authorization decision (i.e., affects on the mission or business) for using and 
operating the information system.
SUMMARY
In this chapter, FISMA was introduced as a basis for understanding the key require­
ments for federal information security programs, including the roles and respon­
sibilities for managing information security risks. The implementation of FISMA 
requires the application of organization-wide risk management activity. The manage­
ment of risk is a complex and multifaceted activity requiring risks to be addressed 
at the strategic and tactical levels, and through different viewpoints. Integrating risk 
management into the organization’s SDLC will result in the consistent application 
of risk management processes and procedures. Although this chapter limited the dis­
cussion of risk management process and decision making at the organizational level 
(which will be covered in the next chapter), the NIST RMF and related risk manage­
ment and security tasks were covered in detail for managing risks from an informa­
tion system perspective.

INTRODUCTION TO RISK MANAGEMENT
The role of risk management within the federal government has evolved from focusing 
primarily on the assessment of risk1 associated within a single information system2 to 
an integration of risk-related activities that involves all levels3 of the organization.4 
1From Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative Interagency Working Group. NIST Special Publica-
tion (SP) 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments. Maryland: National Institute of 
Standards and Technology; 2011. “Risk is a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a 
potential circumstance or event, and is typically a function of: (i) the adverse impacts that would arise 
if the circumstance or event occurs and (ii) the likelihood of occurrence.”

800-12, An Introduction to Computer Security: The NIST Handbook. Maryland: National Institute of 
Standards and Technology; 1995. “Risk management is made up of two primary and one underlying 
activities; risk assessment and risk mitigation are the primary activities and uncertainty analysis is the 
underlying one.”

functions, image, reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, 
and includes: (i) establishing the context for risk-related activities; (ii) assessing risk; (iii) responding 
to risk once determined; and (iv) monitoring risk over time.”

CHAPTER 6  Risk Management
By recognizing that organizations5 are operating in highly complex, interconnected 
environments using state-of-the-art and legacy information systems [1], the ­application 
of the risk management process becomes more important to ensure the responsibility 
for information security risk management exists as an organization-wide activity. This 
organization-wide activity extends from those responsible for the strategic planning to 
those that operate the information systems in support of the mission and business 
operations. In Chapter 5, risk management was discussed from the perspective of the 
information system through the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)6 to inte­
grate risk management activities into the NIST system development lifecycle (SDLC).7 
Risk management in this chapter will examine risk management from a broader 
­perspective. By discussing risk management as a holistic process which can include 
multiple perspectives (i.e., organization, mission and business process, and informa­
tion system), we can obtain an understanding of how it would be applied across the 
entire organization or across multiple organizations.
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)8 is facilitated through the organization’s risk 
management processes9 to ensure the management of risk is applied consistently

­Publication (SP) 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and Infor-

organization describes an entity of any size, complexity, or positioning within an organizational 
structure (e.g. a federal agency or, as appropriate, any of its operational elements) that is charged 
with carrying out assigned mission/business processes and that uses information systems in support 
of those processes.

View. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2011. The Risk Management Frame-
work (RMF) provides a structured process that integrates risk management activities into the system 
development life cycle. The RMF operates primarily at tier 3 but also interacts with tier 1 and tier 2 
(e.g. providing feedback from authorization decisions to the risk executive (function), disseminating 
updated risk information to authorizing officials, common control providers, and information system 
owners).
7The NIST SDLC process includes five phases: initiation, development/acquisition, implementation, 
operation/maintenance, and disposal.

effected by an entity’s board of directors, management and other personnel, applied in strategy setting 
and across the enterprise, designed to identify potential events that may affect the entity, and manage 
risk to be within its risk appetite, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of entity 
objectives.”

Introduction to Risk Management﻿
across the enterprise. An ERM program is integrated across the organization through 
a comprehensive set of processes and practices that focus on managing organizational 
risk.10 For risk management to be effective in managing security risks, it is essential 
that those with the responsibility for executing the mission and business operations 
have a clear understanding of their associated roles and responsibilities within the 
information security program.
An effective risk management program is driven from a “top-down” approach 
where the commitment and support for the program is enabled through the 
­prioritization and allocation of resources needed for the program. In addition to 
resourcing risk management, the risk management strategy needs to be developed 
and communicated by the organization’s senior management to ensure the risk 
management processes and practices are supported by the governance structure 
which links information system security risks to organizational impacts.11 The 
organization’s senior management/executives play a critical role to ensure infor­
mation security risks are considered from an organizational perspective. Their 
role includes [1]: 
• 
Assigning risk management responsibilities;
• 
Recognition and understanding that management of information security risks 
is an ongoing activity;
• 
Establishing and communicating the risk tolerance12 throughout the organiza­
tion; and
• 
Ensuring accountability for risk management decisions and effective, 
organization-wide risk management programs.

risk can include many types of risk (e.g. program management risk, investment risk, budgetary risk, 
legal liability risk, safety risk, inventory risk, supply chain risk, and security risk).”

­Publication (SP) 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and Informa-
tion System View. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2011. “Information 
systems are subject to serious threats that can have adverse effects on organizational operations 
(i.e. missions, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organiza-
tions, and the Nation by exploiting both known and unknown vulnerabilities to compromise the 
­confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information being processed, stored, or transmitted 
by those systems.”

the level of risk or degree of uncertainty that is acceptable to organizations and is a key element of the 
organizational risk frame.

CHAPTER 6  Risk Management
FEDERAL INFORMATION SECURITY RISK MANAGEMENT 
PRACTICES
Risk management is not a new concept within the federal government. As early as 
1974, guidelines have been developed to support federal agencies in integrating risk 
management practices into federal security programs. For example, the National 
Bureau of Standards (NBS)13 published the Guidelines for Automatic Data Process­
ing Physical Security and Risk Management for the purpose of assisting automatic 
data processing (ADP) facility managers in developing physical security programs. 
These guidelines provided procedures for risk management–related activities such as 
conducting a risk analysis (risk assessment) and the selection and implementation of 
security measures (risk mitigation). This early risk management philosophy became 
the foundations by which federal information security programs were built.14 As 
chronicled in Table 6.1, over the years, the federal government’s viewpoint on risk 
management has changed, requiring the practices to evolve from a tactical to a stra­
tegic focus.
Risk management practices are a critical part of federal information security that 
require addressing continuous changes in the sophistication and complexity of the 
threat environment. In the past, federal agencies have been required to rely upon only 
risk assessments as a tool for integrating risk management activities within their 
certification and accreditation (C&A)15 processes [9] and as the foundation16 for 
managing risks within their information security programs. However, federal risk 
management processes are maturing. By adopting a government-wide approach, fed­
eral risk management programs are becoming more comprehensive through the use 
of continuous monitoring tools and techniques to gather security-related information 
to manage risks. Therefore, throughout the remainder of this chapter, the focus will 
shift to discussing a holistic, enterprise perspective to managing risk and the role of 
risk management in supporting a government-wide approach to security assessment, 
authorization, and continuous monitoring.
13NBS became the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1988.

Overview of Enterprise-Wide Risk Management
OVERVIEW OF ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT
Enterprise-wide risk management consists of a structured approach for consistently 
and continuously applying risk management practices for managing risk17 beyond 
the information system boundary. By examining the components that make up the 
federal government’s viewpoint of an organization-wide risk management program, 
a model can be established that will be useful for integrating these components into 
existing federal government and private sector risk management programs. As previ­
ously discussed, risk management within the federal government has primarily 
focused on managing risk at the information system level. This system level approach 
is not adequate when risks need to be communicated across the different levels of the 
organization or between multiple organizations. For risk management to be effective 
as a strategic and tactical tool used by the organization(s) in making risk decisions, it 
needs to be able to manage risk across the complex environments in which informa­
tion systems operate. In this section, an overview will be provided of the integrated, 
enterprise-wide risk management18 methodology, and how it is applied in the context 
of the organization(s)19 supported by the information system. In addition, to provide 
a broader context, the next section will include a brief comparison of both the prac­
tices and processes used in the federal government and in the private sector using 
international risk management standards.
Components of the NIST Risk Management Process
The risk management process (or cycle)20 consists of four components that provide 
a structured, process-oriented approach for managing risks. Each of the four

risk-based decisions), (2) assess risk, (3) respond to risk once determined, and (4) monitor risk on 
an ongoing basis, using effective organizational communications and an iterative feedback loop for 
­continuous improvement in the risk-related activities of organizations.”

CHAPTER 6  Risk Management
components of the risk management process ensures risk is managed in an integrated 
process that requires the involvement of the entire organization. Historically, the fed­
eral government included only two of the four components of risk management—
risk assessment and risk response. In this approach to risk management, as illustrated 
in Figure 6.1, two additional components have been added: risk framing and risk 
monitoring.
Risk Framing
Establishing a risk context (or framing) is a critical first step in risk management that 
requires describing the risk environment, including any boundaries for making risk-
based decisions. The environment includes risk assumptions,21 risk constraints,22 
risk tolerance,23 priorities/trade-offs,24 and the trust model.25 Framing the risk can 
also include information about any tools or techniques that are used by the organiza­
tion to support the risk management activities. The output of risk framing is a risk 
management strategy26 which provides the organization with a common perspective 
for managing risks (i.e., assessment, response, or monitoring).

Overview of Enterprise-Wide Risk Management
Risk Assessment
The assessment of risk is based on the organization’s risk context, and includes activ­
ities focused on supporting the identification and determination of risk, and monitor­
ing risk factors.27 Risks are identified based on a characterization of threats28 (threat 
sources and events), vulnerabilities29 and predisposing conditions.30 The risk deter­
mination is based on the impact that would result from an event and the likelihood 
the event would occur. Monitoring risk factors is the maintenance aspect, and includes

an ongoing situational awareness of the changes to information used by the organiza­
tion when making a risk-based decision.
A risk assessment is a tool that can be used organization wide. Depending on the 
organizational structure, risk-related information captured at the strategic level (tier 1), 
as illustrated in Figure 6.2, can be used at the tactical level (tier 3). By conducting 
risk assessments as a continual risk management activity, threats, ­vulnerability, likeli­
hood, and impact information can be refined and updated with information at each of 
the three levels within the organization (governance, mission/business process, and 
information system). However, to effectively integrate risk assessments at the differ­
ent levels within the organization, the involvement in the risk assessment activities 
must extend beyond those responsible for information security. By using an organi­
zational approach to conduct risk assessments, information security risks become an 
integral part of the organization’s overall decision-making process.
Risk Response
After risks have been identified and analyzed, the organization focuses on developing 
responses31 to risk. When responding to risks, the organization needs to ensure the 
response is consistent with the risk context defined in the risk framing component of 
risk management. Depending on the level of the organization, the risk response may 
be different due to the types of risk-related information being evaluated for impact 
and the specific interpretation of the risk management strategy. For example:
• 
The focus of risk response at the strategic, organizational level might focus on 
the actions (e.g., accept risk, avoid risk, and transfer risk) that would be avail­
able to the organization based on the risk framing.
• 
Risk responses from the perspective of the mission/business process owners 
might consider impacts on the ability of the specific organization to accomplish 
a specific business function which could result in changes to the information 
security architecture or processes that support the information security program.
• 
Risk response at the tactical, information system level might focus on specific 
tasks (plans of action and milestones) that would be undertaken to correct any 
weaknesses or deficiencies found in security controls to ensure risk is mitigated 
to an acceptable level.
A key part of risk response that cannot be overlooked is how the responses to risk are 
communicated outside of the organization such as with external service providers (or 
31From Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative Interagency Working Group. NIST Special Pub-
lication (SP) 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and Information 
System View. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2011. “The purpose of the 
risk response component is to provide a consistent, organization-wide, response to risk in accordance 
with the organizational risk frame by: (i) developing alternative courses of action for responding to 
risk; (ii) evaluating the alternative courses of action; (iii) determining appropriate courses of action 
consistent with organizational risk tolerance; and (iv) implementing risk responses based on selected 
courses of action.”

179
Overview of Enterprise-Wide Risk Management
even between organizations) who may share some or all of the risks. This may require 
those service providers (or organizations) to be part of the risk response decision-
making process, specifically if it relates to contractual or service-level obligations 
that have already been established and formalized prior to the risk response decisions.
Risk Monitoring
The purpose of risk monitoring is to address how risk will be monitored. This includes 
verifying compliance with the risk response decisions by ensuring the organization 
implements the risk response measures (and any information security requirements), 
determines the ongoing effectiveness of risk response measures, and identifies any 
changes that would impact the risk posture [1]. Risk monitoring activities at the vari­
ous levels of the organization (or with other organizational entities) should be coordi­
nated and communicated. This can include sharing risk assessment results that would 
have an organization-wide impact to risk responses being planned or implemented. 
The organization should also consider the tools and technologies that will be needed 
to facilitate monitoring and the frequency necessary for effectively monitoring risks, 
including the changes that would impact responses to risks.
Multi-Tiered Risk Management
Most organizations, regardless of the size or type, have a similar structure that includes 
executive leadership (addressing risk as it relates to the organization’s mission and 
FIGURE 6.2  Multi-Tiered Integration of the Risk Management Process

CHAPTER 6  Risk Management
business functions), mission and business management (addressing risk as it relates to 
the organization’s operations), and system management (addressing risk as it relates 
to the security controls). As illustrated in Figure 6.2, the integration of the risk man­
agement process focuses on the risk management activities32 at each tier.
The information flow between the organizational tiers should be bi-directional. 
By offering a feedback loop, results of monitoring activities can be shared between 
organizational tiers at each level within the governance structure (or model33). For 
example, tier 3 outputs can be used by tier 2 to improve policies, procedures, and 
practices, and tier 2 outputs can be used to by tier 1 to improve organizational poli­
cies that govern the risk management program and are articulated through the risk 
management strategy. Not only is the information flow important for the facilitation 
of internal risk-related information, it can also serve to communicate information 
from external sources (e.g., peer organizations, service providers) that may improve 
the strategy to ensure it is comprehensive.
Tier 1 Risk Management Activities
The organization’s governance34 structure and practices are generally developed 
from a “top-down” approach. This ensures the organizational governance (i.e., 
responsibilities and practices) addresses risk from an organizational viewpoint that is 
consistent with the strategic goals and objectives. In addition, risk management pro­
cess should be directed from the senior management (head of a federal agency, cor­
porate executive, etc.) to align the risk decision with the organization’s strategic 
direction. Senior management may also have the overall responsibility for overseeing 
the achievement of the business objectives and thus they may have the ability to 
ensure resources are available and used effectively to manage risk.
32Activities related to framing risk, assessing risk, responding to risk, and monitoring risk executed at 
each tier within the context of the organization’s governance structure and risk management program.
33There are three basic types of security governance models: centralized, decentralized, and hybrid.
34Applying a consistent and unified governance approach facilitates cost-savings when applying risk 
management activities and translating risks between business functions.
NOTE
Five potential outcomes of the governance-related risk management activities [1] include:
• Strategic alignment of risk management decisions consistent with the organization’s 
goals and objectives.
• Execution of risk management processes (i.e., frame, assess, respond to, and monitor).
• Effective and efficient allocation of risk management resources.
• Performance-based outcomes (e.g., risk management metrics) that ensure 
organizational goals and objectives are being achieved.
• Optimizing risk management investments to support organizational objectives.

181
Overview of Enterprise-Wide Risk Management
In tier 1, the risk executive (or function) also plays an important role in supporting 
the risk management in determining how decisions made regarding risk are carried 
through the organization governance.35
Tier 2 Risk Management Activities
At tier 2, the business/mission processes36 manage risk based on the components 
defined in the risk management strategy. Since these processes support the mission/
business functions, they must have an awareness of impact. As an example, if a 
sophisticated cyber attack occurred, the mission/business processes need to be 
designed to achieve an anticipated level of resiliency. Therefore, a key consideration 
when defining the mission/business processes is the selection of a risk response strat­
egy that is within the constraints defined in the risk management strategy37 [1].
Tier 3 Risk Management Activities
The NIST SDLC integrates risk management activities through the application of the 
NIST RMF. The specific risk management activities at tier 3 are guided by the output 
of the risk management activities conducted at tier 1 and tier 2, (i.e., where the risk 
management strategy and the risk response strategy that is supported by an informa­
tion security architecture).38 In addition, the output of the risk management activities

from the other tiers also ensures the information system operates consistently with 
the information system resiliency40 requirements.
NIST RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
The risk management process can be applied as a tiered model as represented in 
Figure 6.3, in which each of the four risk management components, previously dis­
cussed, is applied at each tier. Each tier plays a role in the execution of the risk 
management process where information flows across the tiers bi-directionally. In this 
section each risk management process will be described and the specific interactions 
between the tiers will be highlighted. Although there is no specific order for applying 
the risk management processes within an organization, this section does address each 
process within each tier based on the presumption that a “top-down” approach will 
be used. The approach starts with tier 1 where the risk framing step begins in the risk 
management cycle and concludes with monitoring risk before moving to the next tier 
(i.e., tier 2 and tier 3).
40From Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative Interagency Working Group. NIST Special Pub-
lication (SP) 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and Information 
System View. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2011. Information system 
resiliency is the ability of an information system to continue to operate under adverse conditions and 
recover within a time frame consistent with the operational need.
TIP
Cloud computing is one example where trust and trustworthiness39 between cloud 
service providers (CSPs) and a federal agency is critical for the effective application of 
the NIST RMF. The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) 
“introduces an innovative policy approach to developing trusted relationships between 
Executive departments and agencies and cloud service providers (CSPs)” [10]. However, 
for a trusted relationship to exist, transparency into the risk management and 
information security activities must include operational visibility based on the adequate 
level of confidence needed by the federal agency using the cloud services. “Establishing 
a level of confidence about a cloud service environment depends on the ability of the 
cloud provider to provision the security controls necessary to protect the organization’s 
data and applications, and also the evidence provided about the effectiveness of those 
controls”[13]. This might require documenting the risk information needed to address 
the trust requirements in contracts, service level agreements (SLAs), or other forms of 
legal agreements.

NIST Risk Management Process
Framing Risk
In the risk management process, risk framing establishes the risk management strat­
egy which provides a common organization-wide strategy for executing the other 
steps (assessment, response, and monitoring) of the process that are supported by 
the commitment of the organizations, senior management. As illustrated in Figure 
6.4, input to risk framing can include laws, policies, directives, regulations, contrac­
tual relationships, financial limitation’s or information that explicitly (MOUs/MOAs, 
governance processes) supports key activities in the risk framing step.
Risk framing activities produce guidance that enables the development of a com­
mon perspective on how the organization manages risk. This perspective is estab­
lished through the assumptions and constraints, level of risk tolerance, and priorities 
and trade-offs that drive the organizations’ decision-making process, and the type/
size of the organization. Since risk framing may initially be high level or undefined, 
a feedback loop should exist to ensure information from the other steps of the risk 
management process are used to adjust the original risk factors that contribute to the 
organization’s risk management policies, procedures, standards, and guidance.
The risk framing step also produces the risk framework and risk methodologies41 
that will be used by the organization in tier 2 and tier 3 of the risk management hier­
archy and in the execution of the other risk management steps. For example, if the

organizational governance structure is centralized,42 only one framework and meth­
odology may be required, whereas if the organization is decentralized,43 multiple 
frameworks and methodologies may be required. By having a common framework 
and methodology for organization-wide tailoring, it ensures at least there is a consis­
tent evaluation standard used by the entire organization for assessing risk and priori­
tizing risks as they are aggregated (or consolidated) from across the organization. 
This standard can then be applied in the risk assessment step when assessing risks 
and in the risk response step when courses of action are prioritized and implemented 
to achieve the most cost-effective strategy for risk mitigation.44

NIST Risk Management Process
Risk Assessment
The risk assessment step of the risk management process, as shown in Figure 6.5, 
involves two major activities: identifying threats and vulnerabilities and risk deter­
mination. This step receives input from the other risk management processes to help 
the decision-makers at each level of the risk management hierarchy identify, priori­
tize, and estimate risks. The inputs to the risk assessment step include, for example, 
the risk assessment methodology (risk framing), different courses of actions (risk 
response), and new threats and vulnerabilities identified (risk monitoring).
Risk assessments can be a useful source of input for risk-related information when 
conducted at each of the organizational tiers. Tier 1 and tier 2 apply risk ­assessments 
based on information security related risks associated with organizational gover­
nance and management activities, mission/business processes (or enterprise archi­
tecture), and funding of information security programs [10]. Tier 3 risk assessment 
activities focus primarily on support information system related activities conducted 
during the implementation of the NIST RMF as discussed in Chapter 5 (i.e., security 
categorization, security control selection, security control implementation, security 
control assessments, security authorization, and security control monitoring). Previ­
ously, risk assessments were only conducted at tier 3 (information system level). 
Although, some risk information cannot be assessed effectively at tier 3, such as tier 
1 risks associated with the organization-wide security program or tier 2 risks associ­
ated with common controls shared across the organization or between entities that 
have a trusted relationship.
FIGURE 6.5  Risk Assessment—Inputs, Activities, and Outputs

186
CHAPTER 6  Risk Management
As previously noted, inputs to the risk assessment can come from a variety of 
sources. As illustrated in Figure 6.6, one of the most important sources is the organiza­
tional risk frame which establishes the context for the risk management strategy. The 
risk management strategy includes “information regarding policies and requirements 
for conducting risk assessments, specific assessment methodologies to be employed, 
procedures for selecting risk factors to be considered, scope of the ­assessments, rigor 
of analyses, degree of formality, and requirements that facilitate consistent and repeat­
able risk determinations across the organization” [11]. The risk assessment methodol­
ogy, a component of the risk management strategy, includes the definition of the risk 
assessment process, risk model (risk factors and relationships among risk factors), 
assessment approach (quantitatively,45qualitatively,46 or semi-quantitatively47), and an 
analysis approach (threat-oriented, asset/impact-oriented, or vulnerability-oriented).
Responding to Risk
The risk response step in Figure 6.7 includes multiple activities for responding to 
risk such as identifying courses of actions, evaluating alternative courses of action, 
and selecting and implementing courses of action. As with risk assessment, the risk 
response is performed at each level of the risk management hierarchy, with activities 
performed at specific tiers. For example, risk response identification could require

WARNING
According to NIST:“… risk assessments are often not precise instruments of measurement 
and reflect:
(i)  the limitations of specific assessment methodologies, tools, and techniques employed;
(ii) the subjectivity, quality, and trustworthiness of the data used;
(iii) the interpretation of assessment results; and
(iv)  the skills and expertise of those individuals or groups conducting the assessments.
Since cost, timeliness, and ease of use are a few of the many important factors in the 
application of risk assessments, organizations should attempt to reduce the complexity 
of risk assessments and maximize the reuse of assessment results by sharing risk-related 
information across their enterprises, whenever possible.”

considering organization-wide impacts and therefore might be performed at tier 1, 
whereas evaluation of alternative courses of action could require an evaluation of 
impacts to mission/business processes and therefore might be performed at tier 2. 
Regardless at which tier the activity is performed, the risk decisions receive input 
from the other risk management processes that are shared and communicated.
Monitoring Risk
The last step in the risk management process involves monitoring risk. Figure 6.8 
illustrates the two activities performed during the risk monitoring step: risk monitor­
ing strategy and risk monitoring. Risk monitoring strategy includes defining the pur­
pose of the risk monitoring program, type of monitoring to be performed (e.g., 
automated vs. manual) and frequency of monitoring activities. Risk monitoring pro­
vides organizations with the means to verify compliance,48 determine the ongoing

COMPARING THE NIST AND ISO/IEC RISK MANAGEMENT 
PROCESSES
Risk management methodologies50 have been published by many organizations. In 
this section, a brief examination will be provided on the methodologies published by 
NIST and the International Organization for Standards /International Electrotechni­
cal Commission (ISO/IEC). As a reference, Table 6.2 provides a list of risk manage­
ment–related standards and guidelines published by NIST and the ISO/IEC, and can 
be useful as a basis for understanding how each approaches risk management.
Risk management practices are the foundation by which the risk management 
strategy is communicated through the governance structure. By understanding the 
general similarities and differences between each approach, it will enable federal 
agencies following the NIST methodology and private sector organizations follow­
ing the ISO/IEC methodology to more consistently apply risk management practices 
across the organizational boundaries. As an example, Figure 6.9 provides a “high-
level” comparison of the key processes included in the NIST and ISO/IEC risk man­
agement methodologies.
In Step 1, outlined in Table 6.3, both NIST and the ISO/IEC address framing the 
risk (or establishing the risk context).51 In the NIST process, risk framing requires 
the organization to develop a risk management strategy that meets its unique gover­
nance structure, mission, and business operations. Although the NIST process

TIP
NIST plays a critical role in aligning standards where possible with those developed 
internationally or nationally. Risk management is no exception. The goal of harmonization 
efforts performed by NIST is to limit “the burden on organizations that must conform to 
both ISO/IEC standards and NIST standards and guidance” [1].

191
Comparing the NIST and ISO/IEC Risk Management Processes
In the next step, the NIST and the ISO/IEC processes include similar activi­
ties for supporting risk identification and risk determination activities. As shown in 
Table 6.4, both focus on the determination of risk through the identification of threats 
and vulnerabilities and the analysis of the risk-related information to support a risk 
determination. One specific difference is an additional activity in the ISO/IEC risk 
assessment process for evaluating risks to determine if any actions should be taken 
based on the output of risk analysis and risk prioritization. Additionally, both pro­
cesses apply the context established in Step 1 as an input into the assessment of risk 
within the risk management process.
In Table 6.5, the risk response (or risk treatment) options are selected for deter­
mining which courses of action (e.g., acceptance, avoidance, mitigation, etc.) to apply 
as a response to a particular risk. During the risk decision process in Step 3, both the 
NIST and the ISO/IEC recognize that regardless of the decision, there still remains a 
degree of residual risk that must be addressed and compared against the organization’s 
risk tolerance [1]. However, as shown in Table 6.6, the ISO/IEC process (Step 4), 
includes an additional activity for the explicit and formal acceptance of residual risk.

CHAPTER 6  Risk Management
The NIST process also includes risk acceptance, but as a separate course of action 
(i.e., acceptance of risk in the NIST RMF Step 5 and Step 6) when responding to risk 
that has been determined to be within the organizational risk tolerance.
Both NIST and the ISO/IEC processes address the ongoing communications and 
sharing of risk-related information with decision makers and stakeholders impacted 
by the risk response decisions. This activity uses the bi-directional pathway to com­
municate risk information to ensure those with responsibility for implementing the 
risk decisions understand the actions that must be taken. Unlike the ISO/IEC process 
shown in Table 6.7, the NIST process does not specifically identify the communi­
cation, sharing, and exchanging of risk information as a separate step, rather it is 
linked to other risk management activities such as risk monitoring where risk-based 
decisions are made as an integral part of every tier within the organization’s risk 
management hierarchy, i.e. governance level, mission/business process level, and 
information system level.
In the final step outlined in Table 6.8, monitoring (Step 6), both the NIST and 
the ISO/IEC processes focus on monitoring risks (and risk factors) for any changes.

193
Comparing the NIST and ISO/IEC Risk Management Processes
The NIST process includes an additional requirement for the development of a for­
mal risk monitoring strategy that serves as a separate function within the monitoring 
strategy for facilitating monitoring activities through a risk monitoring program. The 
risk monitoring program includes features such as monitoring for compliance, effec­
tiveness, changes, and type (automated vs. manual) and frequency of monitoring. In 
the ISO/IEC risk management process, an emphasis is placed on not only monitor­
ing risks and their factors, but also monitoring the risk management process itself to 
ensure it is consistently applied and improvements in the process or relevance of risk 
criteria are integrated into the risk management approach.
SUMMARY
This chapter introduced the topic of organization-wide risk management. Risk 
management plays a critical role within the federal government, and the cultural 
adoption of information technology. The adoption of cloud services will need to be 
addressed by a government-wide approach in which risk management is integrated 
into the federal information security programs to achieve a “do once, use many 
times” approach.
In this chapter we were also introduced to the federal risk management practices, 
and how over time, the maturity of these practices evolved. Since both federal agen­
cies and service providers may adopt different risk management processes, under­
standing where the differences might exist is important to cost-effectively implement 
risk management programs. Therefore, we concluded with a brief comparison of the 
harmonization between the federal risk management practices and the international 
risk management standards.

INTRODUCTION
Managing information security and compliance requirements on an audit-by-audit 
basis can be a challenging and difficult task, specifically where security control 
assessment results and evidence are gathered, analyzed, and reported simultaneously. 
This duplication of effort can result in significant inefficiencies and an unproductive 
use of resources. However, the ability to leverage reuse and satisfy multiple compli­
ance and contractual obligations requires a comprehensive information security and 
compliance framework. Additionally, the framework needs to be able to harmonize 
compliance requirements across both the federal government and industry.
Federal agencies, contractors, and service providers are required to adhere to 
a variety of mandates that cut across multiple federal laws, directives, regulations, 
standards, and policies. In addition to the federal requirements, some service provid­
ers are required to support other compliance obligations from a number of differ­
ent industry security laws, regulations, and standards. The overlap in the security 
requirements and compliance obligations has resulted in service providers establish­
ing multiple, and sometimes concurrent, information security and risk management 
programs. Some of these programs even operate independently due to the inferred 
incapability, resulting in unnecessary redundancies.
The federal government has, itself, struggled with similar problems. Federal infor­
mation security programs are often complex and continuously changing. In addition, 
the increasing reliance on external service providers for information technology (IT) 
services, and the duplication of certification and accreditation (C&A) processes have 
required the federal government to transform existing processes to one that is more 
unified, agile, and streamlined. One of the goals of the new process is to unify the dif­
ferent information security frameworks across the federal government and establish a

foundational set of common information security standards and guidelines. This new 
process would also require the involvement of a government-wide effort to continue 
to identify gaps and standardize federal security requirements, in addition to harmo­
nizing with existing international security standards. Thereby creating consistency in 
security standards and practices to support reciprocity by enabling the federal govern­
ment to leverage existing authorizations, a necessary requirement for the success of 
the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP).
OVERVIEW OF CERTIFICATION AND ACCREDITATION
The concept of C&A is a well-defined security methodology used both within the US 
government and internationally.1 For illustrative purposes, Table 7.1 provides defini­
tions for both certification and accreditation included in various security standards (and 
guidelines) used over the years from across the different federal communities (i.e., 
Civilian Agencies, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Intelligence Community 
(IC)).2 In reviewing the definitions, one can identify a common definitional purpose for 
the C&A process, even though the policies, procedures, and practices may be uniquely 
developed to desribe how the different C&A processes are implemented for use within 
each of the federal communities. Therefore, a common definition of the C&A process 
can be summarized as follows:
A process for evaluating (or assessing) the technical and non-technical security safe­
guards (or controls) implemented to protect the information technology systems or 
applications against threats and vulnerabilities to achieve an acceptable level of risk.
In the next section, we will examine each of the federal C&A processes to gain a 
better understanding of how the federal government’s security practices have evolved 
over time. In addition, the examination will serve to provide an insight into the sig­
nificant challenges that exist for establishing and maintaining a standardized process 
that will be necessary to achieve reciprocity required for the cost-effective use of 
FedRAMP provisionally authorized cloud services.3

the BSI Group’s British Standards) BS7799-2:1998 in February 1998, an internationally recognized 
certification process for an organization’s Information Security Management System (ISMS).

security assessments in order to reuse information system resources and/or to accept each other’s assessed 
security posture in order to share information. Reciprocity is best achieved by promoting the concept of 
transparency (i.e., making sufficient evidence regarding the security state of an information system).”

Overview of Certification and Accreditation
Evolution of the Federal C&A Processes
Federal agencies are continuing to improve the ways to which they interconnect 
information systems. In recent years, federal agencies have begun to use more agile 
development methodologies to maintain pace with quickly evolving technology 
architectures. Using agile methodologies also enables the federal government to be 
more adaptable and better equipped to support changes in their mission and business 
requirements. Similar to the technology changes discussed in Chapter 1, as early as 
the 1970s, C&A processes used by the federal government have also evolved. The 
evolution of C&A processes and practices has been established through the develop­
ment of a number of different standards (and guidelines). However, these processes 
and practices have also been applied differently, both between federal communities 
and federal agencies within the same community.4
In the remainder of this section, we will focus our discussion through a brief 
overview of the different C&A processes that have been used across the federal 
­government with the intent of gaining an understanding into how they evolved and 
were changed. However, this section is not meant to be a comprehensive tutorial of 
the federal C&A processes, but instead it will serve to provide a summary of how 
information security and risk management practices have evolved and were imple­
mented ­independently across the different federal communities.
Civilian Agencies
In 1983, the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), now known as National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (NIST), published the Federal Information Processing 
Standard (FIPS) PUB 102, “Guideline for Computer Certification and Accredita­
tion.” This publication provided federal agencies with a guide for establishing and 
carrying out a program and a technical process for computer security C&A.5 [1] The 
key purpose of the publication was to achieve two main objectives:
• 
Establishing a program for certification and accreditation (e.g., policies and 
procedures, and roles and responsibilities); and
• 
Performing a certification and accreditation (e.g., planning, data collection, 
evaluation, and reporting findings).
4From Wilshusen, G. Progress Made on Harmonizing Policies and Guidance or National Security and 
Non-National Security Systems. Washington: US Government Accountability Office; 2010. “Prior to 
efforts to harmonize information security guidance, federal organizations had developed separate, and 
sometimes disparate, guidance for information security. For example, the National Security Agency 
used the National Information Systems Certification and Accreditation Process, the intelligence com-
munity used DCID 6/3, and DOD used the Department of Defense Information Technology Security 
Certification and Accreditation Process, which later became the DIACAP.”

puter Security Certification and Accreditation. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technol-
ogy; 1983. “The quality exhibited by a computer system that embodies its protection against internal 
failures, human errors, attacks, and natural catastrophes that might cause improper disclosure, modi-
fication, destruction, or denial of service.”

CHAPTER 7  Comparison of Federal and International Security
The FIPS PUB 102 C&A process became the standard of practice for use by 
civilian federal agencies until 2004, when NIST published the first version of the 
Special Publication (SP) 800-37, “Guide for the Security Certification and Accredi­
tation of Federal Information Systems.”
During the period between the publication of FIPS PUB 102 and NIST SP 800-37, 
the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)6 became law (2002). As 
a result of the gap in guidance, OMB released a memo through the Federal Chief Infor­
mation Officers (CIO) Council to provide interim guidance for federal agencies until 
NIST published SP 800-37. This memo gave federal agencies the freedom to use 
another comparable security certification methodology provided it addressed the 
requirements covered in NIST SP 800-26 [10].7
When the first version of NIST SP 800-37 was published, it became the stan­
dard guidance used by civilian federal agencies for non-National Security Sys­
tems (NSSs) until the C&A process was revised in February 2010 through an 
updated version of NIST SP 800-37 (Revision 1). Although this new publication, 
led by NIST, was created through the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative 
(JTFTI) Interagency Working Group. As will be revisited in a later section, the 
goal of the JTFTI was the development of a common set of core standards and 
guidelines that would be part of a government-wide C&A transformation effort. 
This new effort aimed at modernizing the traditional C&A process through the 
elimination of separate processes and the implementation of a risk-based security 
authorization approach. This new approach focused on creating a common infor­
mation security framework that could be used across the federal government.8 In 
addition, the focus was to make the process more dynamic by enabling near, real-
time risk management and continuous monitoring through a single Risk Manage­
ment Framework (RMF).9
6FISMA was discussed in detail in Chapter 5, Applying the NIST Risk Management Framework.
7NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-26, Security Self-Assessment Guide for Information Tech-
nology Systems, published in 2001, built upon the Federal IT Security Assessment Framework 
published by the Federal CIO Council in 2000 as a tool for use by federal agencies when evaluat-
ing their IT security programs. NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-26 was superseded by Federal 
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 200/NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 (specification 
of security controls) and NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53A (assessment of security control 
effectiveness).

lication (SP) 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal 
Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach. Maryland: National Institute of Standards 
and Technology; 2010. “NIST in partnership with the Department of Defense (DoD), the Office 
of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), and the Committee on National Security Systems 
(CNSS), has developed a common information security framework for the federal government and its 
contractors.”
9The RMF was discussed in detail in Chapter 5, Applying the NIST Risk Management Framework.

Overview of Certification and Accreditation
Department of Defense (DoD)
In 1994, the National Computer Security Center (NCSC),10 originally known as the 
DoD Computer Security Center (CSC), a part of the National Security Agency (NSA), 
published the “Introduction to Certification and Accreditation” (or the “Blue Book”). 
This book was one of many standards and guidelines included within the “Rainbow 
Series”11 and provided a high-level introduction for both the DoD and non-DoD com­
munities on the basic concepts and policies associated with C&A, including roles and 
responsibilities and the risk management process. Following the publication of the 
“Blue Book,” the “Certification and Accreditation Process Handbook for Certifiers” 
was published to provide more focused guidance on creating a “structured process by 
which to perform a C&A of a system” [10].
However, it was not until 1997 through the Defense-wide Information Security 
Program (DISSP)12 that a DoD-wide C&A process was created. This new process, 
which became known as the Department of Defense Information Technology Secu­
rity Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP), was expected to be the stan­
dard C&A process for use across the DoD. DITSCAP not only established a standard 
process to certify and accredit information systems, but was also to be used to main­
tain the security posture of the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) through an 
infrastructure approach to C&A [11].
After FISMA became law, the DoD C&A process changed again. In 2006, through 
an interim instruction, DITSCAP began the transition to a new dynamic process 
known as the Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process 
(DIACAP). DIACAP, through a final official issuance in 2007, was designed as the 
DoD-wide C&A process to be used to support the transition of DoD information sys­
tems to Global Information Grid (GIG)13 standards and a net-centric environment. In 
addition, this new process had the objective of enabling improved information sharing 
across the DoD through a standard C&A approach that focused on providing specific 
DoD-wide guidance on managing and disseminating enterprise standards and guide­
lines for IA design, implementation, configuration, validation, operation sustainment, 
and reporting [12].

CHAPTER 7  Comparison of Federal and International Security
Intelligence Community (IC)
The Director of Central Intelligence Directives (DCID), issued by the Director of Cen­
tral Intelligence (DCI), were formerly used to provide intelligence community-wide 
policies and guidance, including governing information systems that stored, processed, 
or transmitted intelligence information. In 1983, DCID 1/16 was published (and later 
updated in 1988) by the DCI to establish a security policy for the processing, storage, 
and transmission of US foreign intelligence and counterintelligence in automated infor­
mation systems (AIS) and networks. Additionally, the criteria in the DoD Trusted Com­
puter System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC), published by the NCSC in 1985, was 
identified by DCID 1/16 as the protective measures (administrative, environmental, and 
technical security requirements) that were required to be met by the AIS to protect sen­
sitive information. However, DCID 1/16 later became superseded by DCID 6/314 in 
1999, with an implementation manual being published in 200015 (and an update in 
2002). DCID 6/3 became the first C&A process documented for use by the IC.
DCI policy was used within the IC until the establishment of the Office of the 
Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) in 2005. In 2008, the ODNI published the 
Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 503, which was to supersede DCID 6/3.16 
The ICD 503 was established to implement the strategic goals17 agreed upon by the 
IC CIO, the DoD CIO, OMB, and NIST. ICD 503 and other transition guidance in 
the form of directives and standards directed the use of CNSS policy and guidance, 
which in turn pointed to the harmonized NIST guidance [13].
Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS)
The CNSS18 published the National Information Assurance Certification and Accredita­
tion Process (NIACAP) in 2000. The NIACAP process, with similarities to the DITSCAP, 
was used by Civilian Agencies for NSS19 for both national telecommunication and 
14DCID 6/3 was developed to be a harmonization with DITSCAP.

April 2002.
16Although ICD 503 directed the use of polices and guidance created by the CNSS and NIST, respec-
tively, DCID 6/3 is still widely used within the IC.

cers Announce Certification and Accreditation Transformation Goals. Washington, DC: Office of the 
Director of National Intelligence; 2007. One of the goals was the institute of a common C&A that “will 
ensure system certifications and accreditations accomplished by one agency are valid for all agencies.”
18From Office of the Director of National Intelligence [Internet]. Maryland: Committee for National 
Security Systems, [cited 2012 Febraury 15]. Available from: http://www.cnss.gov/history.html. “The 
Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS), formerly named the National Security Telecommuni-
cations and Information Systems Security Committee (NSTISSC), provides a forum for the discussion 
of policy issues, and has the responsibility for setting national-level Information Assurance policies, 
directives, instructions, operational procedures, guidance, and advisories for US Government (USG) 
departments and agencies for the security of National Security Systems (NSS).”
19NSSs were briefly discussed in Chapter 5. However, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-59, “Guide 
for Identifying an Information System as a National Security System,” provides additional guidance for 
the identification of NSSs.

203
Overview of Certification and Accreditation
information systems. In 2005, the CNSS issued the “National Policy on Certification 
and Accreditation of National Security Systems” to give civilian federal agencies the 
flexibility to use NIACAP or an alternative C&A process. Since the CNSS is also a 
part of the JTFTI Interagency Working Group, it is “working with representatives from 
the Civil, Defense, and Intelligence Community to produce a unified information secu­
rity framework” [14]. As a first step, CNSS Policy No. 2220 was issued, establishing a 
requirement for the use of an organization-wide IA risk management program for all 
NSSs that is consistent with the NIST standards and guidelines.
20From Takai, T. CNSSP No. 22, Policy on Information Assurance Management for National Security Sys-
tems. Maryland: Committee on National Security Systems; 2012. “Upon this revision of CNSSP No. 22, CNSS 
Policy No. 6, “National Policy on Certification and Accreditation of National Security Systems,” dated Octo-
ber 2005, and National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Instruction (NSTISSI) 
1000, “National Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (NIACAP)” were canceled.
NOTE
Outside of the application of C&A processes on traditional information systems, there also 
exist C&A processes for interfaces used to control access or transfer information between 
differing security domains. The Secret and Below Interoperability (SABI) and the Top 
Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and Below Interoperability (TSABI) 
processes have been developed by the DoD and IC for addressing risk associated with 
operating cross-domain solutions (CDS)21 that control the connection between networks of 
different classification levels.
• SABI C&A process follows the DIACAP C&A principles.
• TSABI C&A process follows the DCID 6/3 C&A principles.
In an effort to unify the two processes, the Unified Cross Domain Management Office 
(UCDMO), was created “to more effectively share information between security domains—
that is, to move information between networks at different clearance (classification) levels 
throughout the federal government” [15]. The UCDMO, in an effort to unify the security 
requirements, published the CDS Overlay in December 2011, which provides a single 
comprehensive set of security control guidance for CDS. The CDS Overlay is based on the 
NIST SP 800-53 Revision 3 and the CNSS-1253.
In addition, the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 (IPD) described CDSs as potential 
situations where additional conditions and controls might be required:
“Security control baselines do not assume that information systems have to operate 
across multiple security policy domains. The baselines assume a flat view of information 
flows (i.e. the same security policies in different domains when information moves across 
authorization boundaries). To address cross-domain services and transactions, some 
subset of the AC-4 security control enhancements can be considered to ensure adequate 
protection of information when transferred between information systems with different 
security policies” [16].

CHAPTER 7  Comparison of Federal and International Security
Towards a Unified Approach to C&A
As previously mentioned, the JTFTI, led by NIST, with participating members 
from the Civilian, Defense, and Intelligence Communities, is a joint partnership 
focused on transforming the federal government’s C&A processes. One of the 
primary goals is to establish a “unified information security framework that har­
monizes security standards and guidelines for NSSs and non-NSSs” [13]. This 
harmonization effort not only eliminates the duplication among the various federal 
C&A processes, but is also aims at reducing the cost associated with managing 
and operating multiple overlapping C&A processes.
In addition, the unified process will enable the government to more effectively 
share information when responding to the growing number of advanced cyber 
threats.
These cyber threats have led to challenges within the federal government’s ability 
to seamlessly share information and authorizations through reciprocity, effectively 
limiting the reuse of evidence when verifying the implementation of security controls 
between interconnected systems. As depicted in Figure 7.1, the unification of C&A 
processes establishes a bridge across the various federal communities by harmoniz­
ing policies and guidance. This harmonization process focuses on using the NIST 
standards and guidelines currently applied to non-NSSs, leaving the DoD and IC to

shift their focus to addressing the unique security requirements through community-
specific23 policies and guidance.
NIST AND ISO/IEC INFORMATION SECURITY STANDARDS
In the last section we discussed an effort to transition towards a common govern­
ment-wide foundation for information security using the NIST standards (and 
guidelines). In this section, the discussion will focus on the harmonization between 
the NIST standards (and guidelines) and the International Organization for Standard­
ization and the International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) information 
23From Wilshusen, G. Progress Made on Harmonizing Policies and Guidance or National Security and 
Non-National Security Systems. Washington: US Government Accountability Office; 2010. “FISMA 
provides a further exception to compliance with NIST standards. It permits an agency to use more strin-
gent information security standards if it certifies that its standards are at least as stringent as the NIST 
standards and are otherwise consistent with policies and guidelines issued under FISMA.”
NOTE
There are several key differences between the information and system categorization steps 
and the control selection processes described between the CNSS policies and the NIST 
standards and guidelines. These differences [13] include:
• System Categorization—different methodologies24 are used to categorize the impact 
associated with information that is stored, processed, or transmitted.
• Security Control Selection—selection of control baselines or control profiles will be 
conducted differently within each of these communities.
• Program Management Controls—program management controls required for non-
national information security programs will be optional for national security system 
information security programs.
24From Shaeffer, R. CNSS Instruction No. 1253, Security Categorization and Control Selection for 
National Security Systems. Maryland: Committee on National Security Systems; 2009. In the National 
Security Community, the potential impact levels determined for confidentiality, integrity, and availability 
are retained, meaning there are 27 possible three-value combinations for NSI or NSS, as opposed to the 
three possible single-value categorizations obtained using the guidelines in FIPS 200. Retaining the dis-
crete impact levels for each of the three security objectives is done to provide a better granularity in allocat-
ing security controls to baselines, and should thereby reduce the need for subsequent tailoring of controls.
NOTE
The DoD Cloud Computing Strategy, published by the DoD CIO,22 directed leveraging efforts 
such as FedRAMP, which prescribes the use of the NIST standards and guidelines as a 
standardized and streamlined C&A process for commercial and federal cloud providers [18].
22The DoD CIO is also a permanent member of the FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB), along 
with the CIO of the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the US General Services Admin-
istration (GSA). Available from: http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/staffoffices/FedRAMP_JAB_Charter_

security standards, 25 which are widely adopted for use within the private sector26 for 
addressing information security and risk management. The NIST security standards 
(and guidelines)27 provide a framework for a mandatory certification process directed 
by FISMA28 to authorize information systems for use by both federal agencies and 
contractors. Whereas, the ISO/IEC standards provide a voluntary certification pro­
cess for use by non-government organizations to confirm their management system 
incorporating generally-accepted information security best practices. For compari­
son, Table 7.2 provides a list of major references that have been published by NIST 
and the ISO/IEC for implementing the different components of a comprehensive 
information security and risk management program.
In previous chapters we examined both the NIST RMF29 and the NIST Risk Man­
agement30 process. In this section, the discussion will shift to provide a basic under­
standing of the relationship between the different information security and risk 
management standards, focusing on highlighting their compatibility, but limiting the 
discussion of recommending any specific methods and methodologies for aligning or 
integrating the different processes. To support the discussion, Figure 7.2 provides a 
point of reference for use by service providers that have already invested in becoming 
certified or are currently operating under the ISO/IEC standards. By defining the 
relationship between the different information security and risk management stan­
dards, service providers will be better positioned to align their information security 
programs, and enabling them to reuse their exiting investment.
Boundary and Scope Definition
The NIST RMF and the ISO/IEC “Plan-Do-Check-Act” (PDCA) focuses on apply­
ing a structured, risk-based approach for the integration of information security. Both 
NIST (800-37 Revision 1—RMF Step 1) and the ISO/IEC (27001—Clause 4.2.1.a)

International Organization for Standardization (ISO), through a joint technical committee (JTC), have 
developed information security standards for all types of organizations, including commercial enter-
prises, government agencies, and not-for-profit organizations.”
26The Information Security Management System (ISMS) is a systematic approach that includes the 
policies, peoples, processes practices, and technologies for managing information security risks affect-

and the information system which maintains and has control over the information sys­
tem. To effectively characterize the boundary and scope of protection,33 processes 
require the organization to define the associated policies,34 assets, technologies, loca­
tions, and personnel.
Security Policy
After the boundary and scope have been defined, the organization creates an informa­
tion security policy (addressed through the NIST SP 800-53 XX-1 controls and the 
ISMS policy35in ISO/IEC 27001), which establishes the management’s direction and 
principles for governing the information system. In addition, the security policy36 
should, at a minimum, include a purpose and scope (SP 800-53 XX-1 controls), iden­
tify the roles and responsibilities (SP 800-53 XX-1 controls and 27001—A.6.1.3), 
address a statement of compliance that is supported through a management commit­
ment (SP 800-53 XX-1 controls and 27001—A.6.1.1), and coordinate among organi­
zational entities (SP 800-53 XX-1 controls and 27001—A.6.1.2).

NOTE
The NIST FISMA Implementation Project includes several initiatives under the second 
phase (Phase II: Implementation and Assessment Aids) of the project. The ISO 
Harmonization Initiative focuses on identifying common relationships and mappings 
of FISMA standards, guidelines, and requirements with: (i) ISO/IEC 27000 series 
information security management standards; and (ii) ISO/IEC 9000 and 17000 series 
quality management, and laboratory testing, inspection and accreditation standards. This 
harmonization is important for minimizing duplication of effort for organizations that must 
demonstrate compliance to both FISMA and ISO requirements [19].

CHAPTER 7  Comparison of Federal and International Security
Risk Management Strategy (Context)
Both NIST and ISO/IEC require an organizational policy (or ISMS policy) that aligns with 
the risk management strategy40 (or context). The risk management strategy is developed as 
an output of the risk framing (or context definition). The framing41 (context) definition is 
established as a part of the risk management process42 discussed in Chapter 6.
Risk Management Process
Before the allocation43 of the security controls, the organization needs to understand 
the risks by conducting a risk assessment. Both NIST (800-37 Revision 1—RMF

ronment in which risk-based decisions are made.”
42See Chapter 6 for a comparison of the NIST and ISO/IEC Risk Management processes.
43Allocation of security controls can occur by assigning responsibility for security controls at each of 
the three tiers (governance, mission/business process, or information system levels) in the risk manage-
ment hierarchy.
NOTE
In NIST SP 800-53, “Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems 
and Organizations,” the first control in each control family37 (e.g., Access Controls, 
Identification and Authentication, Incident Response, etc.) requires identifying the policies 
and procedures that are implemented by the remaining security controls (and control 
enhancements) included in the family of controls.
The policies may be inherited completely (common control38) from the organizational 
policies or may be derived partially (hybrid control39) from an organizational policy that is 
further defined in an information system-specific policy.

3, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information System and Organizations. Maryland:

class based on the dominant characteristics of the controls in that family.”

information system in part as a common control and in part as a system-specific control.”

211
NIST and ISO/IEC Information Security Standards
Step 2) and the ISO/IEC (27001—Clause 4.2.1.d-g) address the selection of security 
controls before and after the risk assessment. In addition, NIST and the ISO/IEC 
have a separate function within the risk management process (discussed in Chapter 
6) where the risks are evaluated based on criteria established during the framing (or 
context definition) step. This criterion assists in determining which of the risk 
response (or risk treatment) options in Table 7.3 would be appropriate as a treatment 
for the risk.
One notable difference between the NIST and ISO/IEC processes is the explicit 
requirements for the acceptance of risk defined in the risk treatment plan and the 
residual risk acceptance. For example, NIST does specify the acceptance of risk; it is 
performed as a result of the approval of the system security plan (800-37 Revision 
1—RMF Step 3) and authorization to operate (800-37 Revision 1—RMF Step 5). 
However, both the NIST and ISO/IEC risk management processes include the ongo­
ing monitoring where risk management becomes a continual process.44
Security Objectives and Controls
The selection (and implementation) of control objectives and controls is a similar 
activity under both the NIST and ISO/IEC processes. The selection process focuses 
on identifying those control objectives and controls that meet the requirements of 
the organizational assessment of risk identified during the execution of the risk 
assessment, in addition to requirements derived from other sources such as busi­
ness requirements, regulatory requirements, legal requirements, and contractual 
obligations. One significant difference that exists is in the scope and organization 
of the security controls included in NIST security control families (800-53—Appen­
dix F) and the ISO/IEC security control clauses (27001—Annex A). In Figure 7.3, a

The NIST SP 800-53 AC-1 security control requirement states:
AC-1 ACCESS CONTROL POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and reviews/updates [Assignment: 
organization-defined frequency]:
a.	 A formal, documented access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, 
responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, 
and compliance; and
b.	 Formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control 
policy and associated access controls.
Supplemental Guidance: This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures 
that are required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control 
enhancements in the access control family. The policy and procedures are consistent with 
applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, 
and guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need 
for additional specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The access control policy 
can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. 
Access control procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a 
particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy 
is a key factor in the development of the access control policy.

The mapping illustrates the distinct differences between the organization of con­
trol objectives and controls included in ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST SP 800-53. For 
example, the AC control family is defined as follows: “Organizations must limit 
information system access to authorized users, processes acting on behalf of autho­
rized users or devices (including other information systems) and to the types of trans­
actions and functions that authorized users are permitted to exercise” [17].
When expanding the mapping of the AC family of controls, the AC controls are 
distributed among the various security topics (27001—Annex A). Some of the AC 
controls (e.g., AC-1) are covered in multiple ISO/IEC security objectives.
The AC-1 control requirement, as depicted in Table 7.4, provides a mapping with 
the ISO/IEC standards covered in the multiple control objectives and controls in 
Figure 7.3.
Once the control objectives and controls have been selected, they need to be doc­
umented through a System Security Plan (800-37 Revision 1—RMF Step 2) and the 
Statement of Applicability (27001—Clause 4.2.1.j). Although the specification of 
the formats may differ, the specific scope as outlined in Table 7.5 provides a general 
comparison of the requirements.

SUMMARY
This chapter introduced the federal C&A processes. These processes, which have 
evolved over time, have been used by federal agencies to certify and accredit their 
information systems. More recently these processes have followed a multi-year pro­
cess of convergences into a single unified process, led by NIST and supplemented by 
community-driven requirements to accommodate specific security requirements and 
information sensitivity.
In addition to the federal certification standards, the ISO/IEC has developed a 
comparable set of standards which have been used by the private sector and interna­
tionally, and includes a similar process for certifying the organizations’ information 
systems. The ISO/IEC process requires the implementation, operation, monitoring, 
review, and maintenance of an ISMS that is adequately protected based on infor­
mation security requirements determined by a risk assessment and other applicable 
requirements (e.g., business, regulatory, contractual, and legal).
As the security and compliance requirements consistently grow and change, orga­
nizations will have to adjust their approaches, tools, and techniques to ensure not 
only their security programs can respond to the changes in the threat environment, 
but can also leverage the efficiency and effectiveness of unified information secu­
rity frameworks to assist them in addressing multiple security laws, regulation, and 
standards.

INTRODUCTION TO FEDRAMP
In mid-2009, an inter-agency effort,1 created under the Federal Cloud Computing 
Initiative,2 was established to focus on solving a single problem statement—How do 
we best perform security authorization and continuous monitoring for outsourced 
and multi-agency systems? [1]. This problem included addressing barriers to the 
adoption of cloud computing solutions and the cost-effective consolidation of data 
centers and applications. Traditionally, federal agencies have independently con­
ducted risk management activities through the certification and accreditations 
(C&As) of their information systems (either residing within the federal agency 
1The inter-agency effort was conducted within the Cloud Computing Security Working Group that 
included members from across the government to include: the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST), US Department of Defense (DoD), US Department of Education (ED), US 
Department of Energy (DOE), US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), US Depart-
ment of Homeland Security (DHS), US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), US 
Department of Justice (DOJ), US Department of Labor (DOL), US General Services Administration 
(GSA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Social Security Administration (SSA), and the 
United States Postal Service (USPS).

Federal Cloud Computing Initiative (FCCI) a part of the Information Technology Infrastructure Line of 
Business (ITI LoB), is focused on implementing cloud computing solutions for the Federal Government

accreditation boundary or operated by a contractor on their behalf. Applying this 
same model to shared services could greatly reduce the overall cost benefit ­associated 
with conducting risk management. In addition, there are other issues and challenges 
associated with applying a singular authorization model such as the incompatibility 
between different federal agency security policies, differences in acquisition and 
compliance processes, and an inconsistent and variable application of federal 
­information security and privacy requirements. These issues and challenges are not 
necessarily new to the federal government, and they existed in the lifecycle of tradi­
tional federal IT environments. However, the issues and challenges become more 
amplified when applied at a larger scale to shared and outsourced information sys­
tems, such as a shared services approach which focuses on improving ­government-wide 
­operational efficiency and effectiveness. Without adopting a more centralized meth­
odology the benefits become less achievable and could potentially inhibit adoption of 
cloud computing solutions.
The solution—an initiative that would provide joint authorization and continuous 
security monitoring services using a unified, government-wide risk management 
approach that federal agencies across the government could leverage [1]. This initia­
tive, known as the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP),3 
was designed to focus on three main areas: authorization, continuous monitoring, and 
federal security requirements. The initial goal of FedRAMP was to establish a unified 
risk management process that:
• 
Increased security of cloud solutions through a common assessment approach.
• 
Eliminated duplication of effort and achieved cost-savings through efficiency.
• 
Enabled rapid acquisition through leveraged authorizations.
• 
Improved reuse of authorization packages based on a common set of security 
requirements.
• 
Facilitated use of shared services across multiple federal agencies.
• 
Integrated a government-wide security approach.
In addition to the benefits of unifying under a common risk management framework, 
commercial service providers also benefited because they only had to perform a sin­
gle assessment to obtain a provisional authorization to operate (ATO). Since the 
FedRAMP program also included a single government-wide governance body, fed­
eral agencies could leverage the provisional ATOs, greatly reducing their effort 
because they do not have to individually initiate independent risk management 
activities.4
In November 2010, the FedRAMP PMO released the Proposed Security Assess­
ment & Authorization for US Government Cloud Computing. This initial framework 
was based on 18 months of collaboration with stakeholders across the public and 
3FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO). Available from: http://www.fedramp.gov.

private sector. However, the proposed solution was also developed for the purpose of 
encouraging a discussion around the “best” approach by gathering “input, knowl­
edge, and experience” [2] necessary for framing the security control requirements 
and processes for cloud computing environments. The FedRAMP program contin­
ued to evolve for the next 13 months until December 8, 20115 when the Federal Chief 
Information Officer (CIO)6 published a memo titled Security Authorization of Infor­
mation Systems in Cloud Computing Environments, which established the federal 
policy for the protection of federal information in cloud services. The memo also 
described the component of the FedRAMP effort, and established milestones for the 
program and the policy governing the adoption by federal agencies [3].
FEDRAMP POLICY MEMO
The OMB FedRAMP “Policy Memo” established the governing federal policy for 
the secure adoption and government-wide use of cloud services. The memorandum 
describes the framework for implementing the FedRAMP components that includes:
• 
A standard set of security requirements for provisional7 authorization and 
ongoing monitoring;
• 
A conformity assessment program for third-party assessment;
• 
An assembly of security experts from across government to review authoriza­
tion documents8 to support the risk-based decisions by the Joint Authorization 
Board (JAB)9;
• 
Standardized contract language that integrates FedRAMP requirements into the 
federal government acquisition process, and
• 
An authoritative central repository for storing authorization documents.
As illustrated in Figure 8.1, the FedRAMP “Policy Memo” is represented at the top 
of the FedRAMP document hierarchy, providing the highest level of governance. The 
governance processes defined in the FedRAMP Concept of Operations (CONOPS)

gram Management Office, US General Services Administration; 2012. “A provisional authorization is 
an initial statement of risk and approval of an authorization package by the JAB pending issuance of 
a final authorization to operate by the Executive department or agency acquiring the cloud service.”
8Documents included in the authorizing package include: Security Plan, Security Assessment Report, 
Plan of Action and Milestones, and Continuous Monitoring Plan.
9As discussed in Chapter 5, Applying the Risk Management Framework, the authorization package 
includes three key documents, the Security Plan, Security Assessment Report, and the Plan of Action 
and Milestones. The authorizing official defines additional supporting documents are required.

are supported by the foundational elements, which include: (i) security assessment 
templates and guidelines; (ii) the Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) pro­
gram description and application; and (iii) the three parallel ongoing monitoring 
mechanisms (automated/manual data feeds, annual attestation, and event/incident 
handling). The foundational elements provide the FedRAMP PMO with the key 
functions needed to meet the operating capability for the program.
The scope of coverage for the FedRAMP “Policy Memo” is inclusive of almost 
all cloud services, regardless of the service and deployment models10 or whether the 
cloud service is commercial11 or non-commercial.12 In addition, the memo is applied

Primary Stakeholders
The four key primary federal government stakeholders for FedRAMP include the US 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board 
(JAB), the FedRAMP PMO, and the federal agencies. Each of the primary stake­
holders shares some responsibility for implementing the FedRAMP “Policy Memo.” 
Figure 8.2 presents a high-level overview of the stakeholders and a workflow that 
highlights the interactions and relationships existing between each participating 
Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and 3PAO.
DHS
The DHS National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD)18 includes several 
divisions, but one specifically, the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications 
(CS&C), focuses on the “security, resiliency, and reliability of the nation’s cyber and 
communications infrastructure.”19 The CS&C includes the National Cyber Security

Division (NCSD),20 which has the primary objective of protecting and securing 
cyberspace and cyber assets, and includes a function specifically focusing on the 
security of federal networks.
In July 2010, through the Director of OMB, the Special Assistant to the President 
and Cybersecurity Coordinator, published OMB Memorandum 10-2821 to clarify the 
cybersecurity responsibilities and activities. This memo set out the lines of responsi­
bility and authority to reduce overlap and ensure the cost-effective ­application of 
resources needed for the government-wide coordination of cybersecurity efforts. In 
addition, the memo aligned cybersecurity-related roles and responsibilities (see (a)), 
including limitations (see (b) and (c)) for the implementation of FISMA22:
• 
Section 3543(a)—The Director of OMB “shall oversee agency information secu­
rity policies and practices, including developing and overseeing the implementa­
tion of policies, principles, standards, and guidelines on information security” [5].
• 
Section 3543(b) and (c)—Limitations associated with National Security 
Systems (NSSs) and Department of Defense (DoD) and Intelligence 
Community (IC) information systems.
The responsibilities assigned under this memo were inherited by the FedRAMP 
“Policy Memo” and gave the DHS the responsibility under FedRAMP for four key areas:
• 
Government-wide and agency-specific cybersecurity assistance;
• 
Cybersecurity operations and incident response coordination;
• 
Continuous monitoring standards development23;
• 
Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) program implementation.24
JAB
The JAB was chartered under a joint agreement25 between the Chief Information 
Officers (CIOs) of GSA, DHS, and DoD with the objective of:
• 
Defining and regularly reviewing the security authorization requirements;
• 
Approving accreditation criteria for the Third Party Assessment Organizations 
(3PAOs);
20Functions within the NCSD include the national cyberspace response system which seeks to protect the 
national cyber infrastructure, the federal network security branch, and cyber risk management programs.

23In September 2010, the DHS Federal Network Security branch published the Continuous Asset 
Evaluation, Situational Awareness and Risk Scoring (CAESARS) architectural reference framework 
which has been adopted by NIST through Interagency Reports as an Enterprise Continuous Monitoring 
Reference Model (also known as the CAESARS Framework Extension).
24The TIC program was original published as an OMB Initiative in Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) Memorandum 08-05 with the focus of optimizing federal network services into a common 
solution for the federal government.

The JAB is comprised of Authorizing Officials (AOs) and AO-designated tech­
nical representatives from GSA, DHS, and DoD, and is supported through the 
FedRAMP PMO that operates within the GSA, Office of Citizens Services and Inno­
vative Technologies (OCSIT).
FedRAMP PMO
The FedRAMP PMO is a critical operational function that provides most of the 
administrative and technical support for FedRAMP processes and frameworks,26 to 
include facilitating the implementation of the assessment and authorization (A&A) 
processes in the NIST RMF,27 excluding the actual authorization. In addition, the 
FedRAMP PMO operates most of the programmatic functions of the FedRAMP pro­
cesses and activities that support the key components included in Figure 8.1 of the 
FedRAMP operating model such as:
• 
3PAO conformity assessment program.
• 
Authorization package queue.
• 
Education and outreach.
• 
Authorization repository.
• 
Security assessment templates and guidelines, to include Memorandums of 
Understanding (MOUs)/Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs) and standard 
contract language and Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
Federal Agencies
The role of the federal agency in FedRAMP is as a federal customer which uses the 
processes (e.g., CONOPS, NIST RMF, etc.), and documentation (e.g., FedRAMP tem­
plates, NIST standards and guidelines, FedRAMP authorization packages, etc.) to pro­
cure and use cloud services to meet the objectives of the “Cloud First” policy, originally 
discussed in the 25 Point Implementation Plan to Reform Federal Information Technol­
ogy Management 28 and further defined in the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy. 29

FedRAMP Concept of Operations
The federal agency, as a party within a contract30 for cloud services, is to use FedRAMP 
as a cost-effective mechanism for the secure adoption of cloud services that are within 
the scope of the FedRAMP “Policy Memo.”
FEDRAMP CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS
The initial version of the FedRAMP Concept of Operations (CONOPS) was pub­
lished on February 7, 2012. The CONOPS leveraged the initial draft of the FedRAMP 
A&A processes31 and similarly included: security assessment, security authoriza­
tion, and continuous monitoring. However, through the maturity of the program, the 
initial processes were expanded to address those core process elements that will be 
governed by FedRAMP to support several important outputs:
• 
Adequacy of information security for cloud services.
• 
Implementation of a common risk management approach.
• 
Improved procurement of cloud services.
As previously illustrated in Figure 8.2, FedRAMP requires the interaction of mul­
tiple participants. The FedRAMP CONOPS further elaborated on the role of each 
participant in Table 8.1.
30Cloud services can be a “public cloud” or a federal “community cloud” that provides shared services. 
For example, the Bureau of the Public Debt, Administrative Resource Center (BPD-ARC), a part of the 
US Treasury, provides Government-to-Government Shared Services that provides services ­leveraged by 
other federal agencies. For more information on the BPD-ARC, visit: https://arc.publicdebt.treas.gov/.

Cloud-Computing.pdf.
NOTE
The FedRAMP process provides a structured approach for use by the federal government. 
The FedRAMP process also offers a catalyst for developing similar processes and practices 
that will be used by the private sector when adopting cloud services. By offering a 
similar model for conducting due diligence when evaluating the information security, 
risk management, and compliance of cloud services, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) 
developed the Open Certification Framework (OCF), a program for flexible, incremental, 
and multi-layered cloud provider certification according to the CSA’s industry-leading 
security guidance and control objectives. The FedRAMP operates under a “do once, use 
many times” concept, where the CSA OCF operates under a “certify-once, use-often” 
concept. However, both models can also be used as options by cloud service providers, 
saving both time and cost associated with consumer due diligence activities. In addition, 
by leveraging cloud services that have been reviewed under the FedRAMP and OCF model, 
cloud consumers can reduce the need to perform their own due diligence, potentially 
accelerating the development and deployment of new products and services.

226
CHAPTER 8  FedRAMP Primer
The FedRAMP CONOPS provides the high-level overview and operating model 
that encompasses three key process areas that govern the life cycle of a cloud com­
puting service within FedRAMP. As shown in Figure 8.3, the FedRAMP operational 
capability focuses on processes that include: conducting security assessments, lever­
aging of provisional authorizations, and continuous monitoring. To support the oper­
ational capability the FedRAMP CONOPS describes the relationship between the 
document hierarchy in Figure 8.1 and a structured application of the processes (i.e., 
the relationship between the conceptual operation of FedRAMP and the various roles 
and responsibilities within each of the processes).
Operational Processes
FISMA requires federal agencies to ensure the protection of federal information and 
information systems. The accountability for this requirement cannot be transferred to 
the FedRAMP PMO, but instead, as illustrated in Figure 8.2, it is shared between the 
FedRAMP PMO and the federal agency based on the scope of the evaluation (i.e., 
FedRAMP security requirements baseline vs. the agency-specific security and pri­
vacy requirements). The FedRAMP processes used in conducting the A&A of cloud 
services are designed to be compatible with the existing risk management practices 
already defined by NIST and used in traditional IT environments or FedRAMP-
exempt cloud solutions. Therefore, only the differences within the FedRAMP pro­
cesses and the NIST RMF32 will be discussed in this section.
32NIST RMF was discussed in detail in Chapter 5, Applying the NIST Risk Management Framework.

CHAPTER 8  FedRAMP Primer
Security Assessment Process
The FedRAMP JAB, in collaboration with the Federal CIO Council and Federal Chief 
Information Security Officer (CISO) community, defined two additional sets of secu­
rity control baselines that extend the existing NIST security control baselines33 for 
Low- and Moderate-Impact cloud-based information systems. As will be discussed in 
more detail in Chapter 9, these minimum security controls have been tailored and 
supplemented to establish a standardized set of security requirements considered to 
provide adequate protection for federal information within cloud computing environ­
ments. In addition to the initial tailoring of the NIST security control baselines by the 
JAB (i.e., applying the scoping guidance and specifying government-wide organiza­
tion-defined parameters), CSPs also have the responsibility for completing additional 
tailoring for the application of security controls that may differ from the FedRAMP 
security control requirements (i.e., specifying compensating security controls). For 
example, in Table 8.2, the security controls selection process (NIST RMF Step 2) maps 
to two additional FedRAMP deliverables: Control Tailoring Workbook (CTW) and 
Control Implementation Summary (CIS). The CTW is used by the CSPs to document 
their “control implementation and define their implementation settings for FedRAMP 
defined parameters and any compensating controls” [6]. The CIS is used by the CSP to 
summarize the control ownership and indicate which controls are owned and managed 
by the CSP and which are owned and managed by the leveraging federal agency.
Initiating a Request
The first process area of the FedRAMP security assessment process, initiating a 
request,34 involves the definition of the scope of the cloud service. The four steps 
included in Table 8.2 provide a mapping to similar types of steps performed within 
the NIST RMF as applied by federal agencies for traditional IT environments or 
FedRAMP-exempt information systems. In addition, this process area applies spe­
cific adaptations of the NIST RMF for the purpose of enabling a more programmatic 
interaction when performing the risk management activities; however, the intent of 
the NIST-defined processes are maintained.
Identified below are the outputs from the steps included within the security 
assessment control process area when initiating a request:
Major Milestone Outputs:
• 
Categorization of the cloud service, including the information to be processed, 
stored, or transmitted.
33From Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 
3, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information System and Organizations. Maryland: 
National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2010. “Organizations have flexibility in applying the 
baseline security controls in accordance with the guidance provided in Special Publication 800-53. 
This allows organizations to tailor the relevant security control baseline so that it more closely aligns 
with their mission and business requirements and environments of operation.”
34The FedRAMP initiation can be performed by both the sponsoring federal agency and the CSP.

CHAPTER 8  FedRAMP Primer
Documenting the Security Controls
Documenting security controls, described in Table 8.3, maps to the corresponding 
NIST RMF Step 3 (Implement Security Controls). In this process area, the CSP imple­
ments the required security controls and documents the implementation in the System 
Security Plan (SSP). The SSP provides the JAB with the necessary visibility through 
the functional descriptions of how the security controls have been integrated into the 
cloud service and the operating environment. “The functional description of the security 
control implementation includes planned inputs, expected behavior, and expected out­
puts where appropriate, typically for those technical controls that are employed in the 
hardware, software, or firmware components of the information system” [7]. The SSP 
describes the controls implemented, and also provides a method for communicating to 
the JAB those security controls which have been planned or compensated by the CSP.
Before the security control implementations can be described, the CSP needs 
to identify the information system components included within the operating envi­
ronment. Since cloud environments can be configured differently and encompass 
different layers (e.g., a single provider operates the IaaS layer, a single or different 
provider operates the IaaS and PaaS layers, or a single provider operates all layers 
or only the SaaS layer), it is important for the CSP to accurately reflect the security 
control boundary layer to ensure gaps do not exist between each layer.
Identified below are the outputs from the steps included within the security 
assessment control process area when documenting security controls.
Major Milestone Outputs:
• 
Documentation of the security controls implemented in the cloud service as 
included within the approved baseline security controls allocated and described 
in the CTW and the CIS.
TIP
The FedRAMP PMO identified the following list of questions [13] to assist CSPs in 
describing the scope of the boundary for their cloud service. Below is a subset of those 
questions:
• Does the cloud service leverage an existing Provisional Authorization?
• Do tenants share the same VLAN(s)?
• Are virtual machine zones isolated on unique network segments?
• Are separate physical network adapters used to isolate virtual machine zones?
• Is layer-2 isolation performed?
• Are firewalls used to provide isolation between tenants?
• Are router ACLs used to provide isolation between tenants?
• Are network zones used, and if so, how are those zones defined?
• Do you have the capability to identify the geographic location where the customer data 
is stored?
• Do you have the capability for a federal agency customer to identify the geographic 
location where its data are stored?
• Is live migration used, and if so, is it performed manually or automatically?
• If live migration is automated, what rules are used to govern the migration?

CHAPTER 8  FedRAMP Primer
Performing the Security Assessment
In this step of the security assessment process area, as outlined in Table 8.4, the CSP 
works directly with a contracted accredited35 Third Party Assessment Organization 
(3PAO). The 3PAO is responsible for performing an independent and qualified 
assessment of the security controls using the artifacts included in the security assess­
ment package. The assessment-related activities performed in this step are consistent 
with those included within the NIST RMF Step 4 and involve a collaborative rela­
tionship between the CSP and the 3PAO to ensure assessor independence is main­
tained. The output of this task involves making a determination of the extent to which 
the controls are implemented correctly, operate as intended, and produce the desired 
outcome with respect to meeting the FedRAMP security requirements [7].
In addition to the assessment activities included in NIST RMF Step 4, the CSP 
also has responsibility in documenting a remediation plan (or plan of action and 
milestones (POA&Ms)),36 which is performed in NIST RMF Step 5. After reviewing 
the security assessment report (SAR) generated by the 3PAO, the CSP is required to 
prepare POA&Ms37 that require establishing the tasks, resources required to com­
plete the task, and the schedule for remediating any findings of weaknesses and defi­
ciencies. The 3PAO SAR and the POA&Ms are two of the three key documents in the 
security authorization package submitted and reviewed by the JAB when making a 
risk-based decision for granting a Provisional Authorization.
Identified below are the outputs from the steps included within the security 
assessment control process area when performing the security assessment.
Major Milestone Outputs:
• 
Approved security assessment plan used to assess the security control 
employed within or inherited by the cloud service.
• 
SAR that identifies the findings and recommendations based on an assessment 
of the security controls implemented within the cloud service.
• 
POA&Ms that include remediation action for correcting weaknesses and 
deficiencies in the cloud service.
35List of accredited 3PAOs can be found at FedRAMP.gov. Available from: http://www.gsa.gov/portal/
content/131991.
36From FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO), FedRAMP Plan of Action and Milestones 
Template. Washington: US General Services Administration; 2012. “The plan of action and mile-
stones (POA&M) is one of three key documents in the security authorization package and describes 
the specific tasks that are planned: (i) to correct any weaknesses or deficiencies in the security con-
trols noted during the assessment; and (ii) to address the residual vulnerabilities in the information 
system.”
37From FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO), FedRAMP Plan of Action and Milestones 
Template. Washington: US General Services Administration; 2012. “All High and Moderate findings 
from the Security Assessment Report should be mapped into the POA&M. High impact vulnerability 
needs to be mitigated within 30 days, and Moderate impact vulnerabilities need to be mitigated within 
90 days.”

Finalizing the Security Assessment
The final step in the security assessment process area, as outlined in Table 8.5, is the 
assembly of the documentation by the CSP into a security authorization package that 
includes the Supplier’s Declaration of Conformation.38 The JAB reviews the security 
authorization package and makes the final risk-based decision when granting a Pro­
visional Authorization. This risk determination is based on an accumulation of risk-
related information that is used by the JAB when assessing the risk to the federal 
government when using the cloud service.

Identified below are the outputs from the steps included within the security 
assessment control process area when finalizing the security assessment:
Major Milestone Output:
• 
Security assessment package that includes the key documents used in making 
an authorization decision—the SSP, SAR, and POA&Ms.
• 
Provisional ATO letter that includes the risk determination and acceptance 
decision by the JAB for cloud service.
Leveraging the ATO
Leveraging is an authorization approach,39 previously discussed in Chapter 5, 
which is used when one federal agency accepts the authorization package of 
another federal agency. The leveraging federal agency’s AO reviews and accepts 
the risk based on a determination of the risk for using the cloud service to support 
their specific mission and business processes and use the cloud service to store, 
39Three authorization approaches are available by AOs when conducting authorizations: (1) traditional 
single AO ATO, (2) multiple AO ATO, and (3) leveraged ATO.

process, or transmit their information. In this FedRAMP process area, the final 
acceptance of risk (or ATO) is granted by the leveraging federal agency40 accept­
ing the provisional ATO for cloud service. This includes the agreement of the 
control responsibility as allocated by the CSPs in the CIS, as discussed earlier in 
this chapter.
Continuous Monitoring
In the final process area, ongoing assessment and authorization (also known as con­
tinuous monitoring), the JAB determines if the security controls implemented are 
still effective and the Provisional Authorization should be maintained.41 This deter­
mination is based on three keys areas: operational visibility, change control process, 
and incident response. The operational visibility focuses on periodic assessment of a 
select subset of security controls to ensure security controls implemented by CSPs 
continue to be effective. The change control process relates to the CSPs’ ability to 
understand security impacts associated with changes to the cloud service. Incident 
response focuses on identifying new threats and vulnerabilities and the response and 
mitigate activities for incidences. Continuous monitoring will be discussed in detail 
in later chapters. However, in this section, a high-level overview will be provided as 
it relates to the FedRAMP CONOPS.
Operational Visibility
Operational visibility focuses on three sources of information for determining the 
security and risk posture of cloud services to demonstrate continued compliance 
through the automation to enable oversight and monitoring. Originally included in 
the reporting instructions42 to federal agencies in April 2010, a three-tiered 
approach43 was introduced as a method for federal agencies to effectively and 
40There are four types of security assessment package categories that will be maintained in the 
FedRAMP repository.

CHAPTER 8  FedRAMP Primer
­“continuously monitor security-related information across the enterprise in a 
­manageable and actionable way” [8]. To enable near-real-time monitoring, Cyber­
Scope was introduced as the platform for submitting data feeds (automated and 
manual) and to enable OMB and DHS44 to conduct government-wide benchmark­
ing through a set of questions/metrics45 that describe each on the federal agencies’ 
security posture.
As part of the continuous monitoring requirements, CSPs are required to submit 
similar types of data elements to federal agencies to use in meeting their reporting 
requirements and to give the FedRAMP PMO operational visibility into the security 
posture of cloud services. In addition, CSPs are required to conduct an annual re-
assessment of a subset of the security controls identified in the FedRAMP baseline 
and submit an annual self-attestation report.
Change Control
Changes to an operational environment are inevitable as a system undergoes routine 
maintenance. However, some changes may cause significant impacts to the security 
posture of the cloud service.46 Therefore, the CSP is required to report “changes in 
the CSP’s point of contact with FedRAMP, changes in the CSP’s risk posture, 
changes to any applications residing on the cloud system, and/or changes to the cloud 
system infrastructure” [6], and submit any residual artifacts associated with signifi­
cant changes such as the SSP, security impacts analysis, and a re-assessment by a 
3PAO to the FedRAMP PMO.
Incident Response
Incident response plans ensure there is bi-lateral communication on incidents 
between the CSP and the federal government. Depending on the type of incident and 
the scope of the impact, a single incident could impact multiple federal agencies 
leveraging the cloud service [9]. The notification of incidents and coordination with 
the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT)47 and federal 
agency Security Operations Centers (SOCs) ensures there is a managed response and 
escalation of incidences.
44In July 2010 through the responsibilities outlined in OMB Memorandum 10-28, Clarifying Cyber-
security Responsibilities and Activities of the Executive Office of the President and the Department of 
Homeland Security, DHS was given the primary responsibility for operational aspects of cybersecurity 
with respect to the federal information system covered under FISMA as defined in Section 3545.
45In February 2012, DHS published the FY 2012 Chief Information Officer Federal Information Secu-
rity Management Act Reporting Metrics, which requires federal agencies to report on cloud services. 
Available from: http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/nppd/ciofismametricsfinal.pdf.
46Depending on the cloud service and deployment model, changes to the cloud service could affect 
other services or applications within the cloud stack.

Third Party Assessment Organization Program
THIRD PARTY ASSESSMENT ORGANIZATION PROGRAM
Conformity assessments48 are not new to the federal government. As discussed in 
Chapter 2, the federal government has a role in supporting standards development.49 
For example, NIST,50 which chairs the Interagency Committee on Standards Policy 
(ISCP),51 has the responsibility52 of coordinating public and private sector standards 
and conformity assessment activities. In the 3PAO Program, the FedRAMP PMO in 
coordination with NIST designed “a conformity assessment process for use with 
FedRAMP to ensure the independence of and the management and the technical 
quality of 3PAOs uses a standard and consistent security assessment process” [10]. 
The conformity assessment process53 gives the federal government the confidence of 
the security in using cloud services through:
• 
the conformance with an established set of security standards and requirements;
• 
a consistently applied security assessment process; and
• 
the use of a structured approach when granting provisional ATOs.
In the FedRAMP process, the 3PAO54 plays a critical role in providing the 
FedRAMP JAB with an independent evaluation (or inspection55) to ensure the cloud

service meets FedRAMP security requirements through a conformity assessment56 
process. To ensure assessments of cloud services are conducted in a unified and stan­
dard approach, enabling a “do once, use many times” approach, organizations con­
ducting the security assessments will need to be accredited to ensure they meet the 
minimum requirements of independence and competence.57
SUMMARY
In this chapter, FedRAMP was introduced through a detailed discussion of the pro­
gram goals and objectives, and its role in supporting the secure adoption of cloud com­
puting services. The program’s governing documents (i.e., Policy Memo, CONOPS) 
provide insight into how the program operates. In addition, the primary stakeholders 
were also briefly discussed as it relates to their roles and responsibilities for the gover­
nance and execution of FedRAMP process areas. Through a review of the FedRAMP 
process areas defined within the FedRAMP CONOPS, a mapping to NIST RMF 
provides context into the similarities and differences between the FedRAMP imple­
mentation of those processes defined in NIST standards and guidance references. 
56From Global Standards Information, Conformity Assessment [Internet]. Maryland: National Insti-
tute of Standards and Technology [cited 2012 Mar 17]. Available from: http://gsi.nist.gov/global/ 
index.cfm/L1-5/L2-45. “Conformity assessment procedures provide a means of ensuring that the 
products, services, systems, persons, or bodies have certain required characteristics, and that these 
­characteristics are consistent from product to product, service to service, system to system, etc.”
57Breitenberg, M. NISTIR 6014, The ABC’s of the US Conformity Assessment System. Maryland: 
National Institute of Standards and Technology; 1997. “A prescribed set of rules, conditions, or 
requirements concerning definitions of terms; classification of components; specification of materials, 
performance, or operations; delineation of procedures; or measurement of quantity and quality in 
describing materials, products, systems, services, or practices.”
TIP
Independent assessors or assessment teams must be capable of conducting an impartial 
assessment. What qualifies an assessor or assessment team as being capable of presenting 
results in a manner that would enable the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) in making 
a “credible, risk-based decision” is determined through the Third Party Assessment 
Organization (3PAO) Program. In addition to the 3PAO program, “CSPs should establish 
minimum personnel requirements such as the CCSK with other credentials like the CISSP, 
CAP, CSSLP, etc. the CSP could have some level of assurance that the assessor conducting 
the assessment has evidence of cloud security knowledge” [11].
“The criteria of an independent assessor(s) or assessment team within the Cloud 
should include a mix of skills and proficiencies … ”
“… a key criteria that should be included as part of the selection criterion when 
identifying qualified and “capable” independent assessors or members of an assessment 
team is certifications that establish a baseline of cloud security knowledge” [12].

INFORMATION IN THIS CHAPTER:
•	 Security Control Selection Process
•	 FedRAMP Cloud Computing Security Requirements
SECURITY CONTROL SELECTION PROCESS
The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) Joint Authori­
zation Board (JAB) selected security controls from the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53 low and moderate security 
control baselines and supplemented with additional security controls and enhancements 
to address the unique risks to cloud computing environments. These risks included 
multi-tenancy, visibility, control/responsibility, shared resource pooling, and trust [1]. 
The FedRAMP security control baselines were developed through a multi-step process 
focused on defining a standardized set of security requirements for the cost-effective 
authorization of cloud services for use by the federal government. As discussed in 
Chapter 5, the security control selection process involved the application of three steps:
• 
Selecting the initial security control baseline.
• 
Tailoring the security control baseline.
• 
Supplementing the security control baseline.
Since the FedRAMP program is meant to be a consistent, government-wide 
approach to security assessment and authorization, the final security control base­
lines creates a government-wide overlay1 that identifies specific security require­
ments for “cloud-based information systems that are uniformly applied to all federal 
agencies procuring or implementing cloud services” [2].

CHAPTER 9  The FedRAMP Cloud Computing Security Requirements 
Selecting the Security Control Baseline
The FedRAMP security control baselines operates at the low- or moderate-impact 
level, where low and moderate categorization is equally applied across all of the 
security objectives (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) for the cloud service.
For cloud services applying the FedRAMP low baseline, the security control 
baseline was developed based on the following security categorization:
where the value for potential impact to the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and avail­
ability is low.
For cloud services applying the FedRAMP moderate baseline, the security con­
trol baseline was developed based on the following security categorization:
where the value for potential impact to the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and avail­
ability is moderate.
Tailoring and Supplementing Security Control Baseline
The FedRAMP security control baselines2 were developed through the application of 
the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)3 tailoring process. As discussed pre­
viously, the tailoring process is the second step of the security control selection pro­
cess and includes the assignment of specific values to the organization-defined 
security control parameters.4 Some security controls included within NIST SP 800-
53, Appendix F—Security Control Catalog, have embedded parameters5 that are

designed to provide flexibility when defining the specification for the security control 
and enhancement(s) necessary to support the definition of government-wide security 
requirements for the secure use of cloud computing services.
After the initial security control baseline was tailored, the FedRAMP JAB sup­
plemented the baseline with additional security controls and enhancements identified 
as necessary to sufficiently protect federal information within a cloud computing 
environment. In addition to the requirements defined in the FedRAMP security con­
trols, the FedRAMP JAB defined additional requirements through security control 
addendum [2].
FedRAMP Cloud Computing Overlay
The FedRAMP cloud computing overlay6 is a government-wide set of security con­
trols that are based on a focused look at the security capabilities and requirements 
needed to protect federal information within low- and moderate-impact cloud ser­
vices. The application of an overlay does not limit Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) 
or federal agencies from tailoring or supplementing the FedRAMP security control 
baselines, rather it creates a “ community-wide or specialized set of security controls 
for information system and organizations” [2] based on a consensus7 of those within 
the community that the requirements should be broadly applied to multiple informa­
tion systems (and cloud services) that meet a specific target characteristic (i.e., the 
FedRAMP control baselines can be further refined based on a specific service or 
deployment model).
FEDRAMP CLOUD COMPUTING SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
The FedRAMP “Policy Memo,” as discussed in Chapter 8, is the overarching policy 
that covers all commercial and non-commercial cloud services, including all cloud 
deployment and service models with the exception8 of a private cloud operating

­on-premise, and which provides services to only the owning organization (i.e., no 
external users, including other organizational entities within the same federal 
agency). Since CSPs can operate as either a public (i.e., federal or state government) 
or private sector organization or both, potentially complex cloud relationships can be 
created where security control assignment and ownership can be difficult to deter­
mine. Therefore, all stakeholders should participate in planning and coordinating the 
development of cloud-specific contracts (or other end-user agreements).9
The scope of the contracts (or agreements) should provide a clear definition of 
the governance over the cloud service environment (i.e., the policies, procedures, 
standards, guidelines, and roles and responsibilities that would be applied). In addi­
tion, the contracts (or agreements) should provide a clear delineation of the security 
control responsibility,10 similar to Figure 9.1, including any applicable policies and 
procedures that would satisfy the requirements for the security controls. As an exam­
ple, the FedRAMP CONOPS requires CSPs to submit information security policies

nification arising out of a Federal agency’s use of a CSP environment must align with Federal statutes, 
policies, and regulations; and compliance should be defined before a contract award. This may be done 
through a separate document or be included in the actual contract.”

governing their cloud service, as described in the System Security Plan (SSP),11 to 
the FedRAMP PMO as part of the FedRAMP security authorization process.
The delineation should include any applicable policies and procedures that would 
apply to the implementation of the FedRAMP security controls. Since CSPs are 
required to submit information security policies and procedures governing their 
cloud service as described in the FedRAMP SSP12 Template to the FedRAMP PMO 
as part of the FedRAMP security authorization process, CSPs should at minimum 
have established security policies that govern all of the FedRAMP security require­
ments that are applicable to their cloud service layer.
The assignment of responsibility for security controls is an essential activity that 
requires identifying situations where there is potential shared responsibilities (or 
hybrid controls). For example, a CSP may implement the Incident Response Policy 
and Procedures security control (IR-1) as a hybrid control with the policy portion of 
the control deemed to be common and applied as a corporate responsibility, and the 
procedures portion of the control deemed to be system-specific [4]. The FedRAMP 
PMO established the Control Implementation Summary (CIS) document to be com­
pleted by the CSP to aid in communicating the ownership and responsibility of the 
security controls between the CSP and the federal agency  customer.
Policy and Procedures
The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)13 requires the highest-
level senior executive within an organization (e.g., head of the federal agency, chief 
executive officer) with the overall responsibility to provide for the information security 
protections and to ensure the development, implementation, and maintenance of infor­
mation security policies, procedures, and control techniques. The policies, procedures, 
and control techniques must address all applicable requirements, including those issued 
by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (NIST), except where authority is delegated to other organizations (e.g., 
the Secretary of Defense for US Department of Defense (DoD) information systems).

tion, configuration management, access control), the first control, identified as the

the requirements that must be implemented within the information system or by the 
organization.15 CSP security policies should include at minimum the purpose16 of 
the policy, the scope,17 the roles and responsibilities,18 and compliance.19 The 
FedRAMP “Policy Memo”20 issued by the OMB defines the government-wide secu­
rity program,21 and the security and authorization policy for addressing the security 
and authorization of cloud computing environments. Through the implementation of 
an information security program plan,22 the organization can effectively centralize 
those security controls deemed independent of a particular cloud service and instead 
manage them as part of the overarching information security program.

FedRAMP Cloud Computing Security Requirements
Harmonizing FedRAMP Requirements
The FedRAMP “Policy Memo” established a standard set of security requirements 
that would be used for the authorization and ongoing continuous monitoring of cloud 
services.32 In addition, the FedRAMP security requirements could be supplemented 
with additional federal agency-specific security and privacy requirements, or even 
32At the time of the FedRAMP memo publication, only NIST-defined low-and moderate-impact  
information systems were considered within the scope of FedRAMP.
TIP
Standards, Guidelines, and Procedures
To assist CSPs and federal agencies in implementing policies, standards, guidelines, and 
procedures should be used. Standards and guidelines, such as those developed by NIST 
under a statutory responsibility, establish minimum requirements promulgated from 
legislative mandates “to support the implementation of and compliance with the Federal 
Information Security Management Act” [5]. Whereas other standards and guidelines such 
as the NIST SPs, Defense Information System Agency (DISA) Security Technical 
Implementation Guides (STIGs),23 or National Security Agency Information Assurance (IA) 
Mitigation Guidelines24 focus on providing specific methods or techniques for ensuring the 
security of a solution. Standards and guidelines can focus on a general concept such as 
sever security,25 secure communication26 or secure operations,27 while others may target a 
specific technology (i.e., virtualization28 or IPv629 or security feature (i.e., encryption30 or 
security automation31). Procedures are more scoped to the operating environment (i.e., 
operational personnel, facility, and system operations) and provide the detailed steps that 
address how the policies, standards, and guidelines are applied within an operational 
context such as credential management or performing audit log management.

incur changes through updates to NIST SP 800-53 and by the JAB33 review process. 
Therefore, a harmonization governance process,34 similar to Figure 9.2, may be used 
by the FedRAMP PMO to maintain and elicit changes to the FedRAMP security 
controls, to include changes in security control requirements.
Through a continual review process,35 input from multiple sources can be used by 
the JAB to harmonize the FedRAMP security controls as part of a review and adju­
dication. Example input could include feedback from federal agencies on the ade­
quacy of the FedRAMP security control requirements, an evaluation by JAB 
Technical Representatives (TRs) of CSP environments, or the reconciliation with 
federal agency–specific security and privacy requirements. In addition, all federal

agencies (and contractors)36 are required to be in compliance with NIST publica­
tions37 one year38 from date of publication. Therefore, changes to the NIST SP 800-
53 could also require changes and updates to the FedRAMP security controls.
Assurance of External Service Providers Compliance
FISMA requires agencies to provide security protections “... commensurate with the 
risk and magnitude of harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, dis­
ruption, modification, or destruction of information collected or maintained by or on 
behalf of the agency; and information systems used or operated by an agency or other 
organization on behalf of an agency” [7]. In addition, OMB requires federal agencies 
to ensure appropriate information security oversight capabilities exist for contractors 
and other users with privileged access to federal data and systems.
CSPs, regardless of the deployment and service model, are required to meet 
the same requirements when processing, storing, or transmitting federal information 
or are operating on behalf of the federal government. The integration of FedRAMP 
security requirements into the terms and conditions of contracts and service 
level agreements (SLAs)39 provides mechanisms when defining roles and responsi­
bilities. The FedRAMP PMO provides standard contract clauses,40 control-specific 
contract clauses,41 and accompanying SLA guidance42 covering all FedRAMP

requirements [3]. Although CSPs are responsible for ensuring compliance with the 
FedRAMP security requirements the overall responsibility for mitigating risks in 
using cloud services is retained with the federal agency customer.
Approaches to Implementing FedRAMP Security Controls
Decisions made as part of the security control selection process are driven by the 
organization’s determination of the adequate protection for a given information 
NOTE
The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) covers the acquisition of IT supplies and services 
used by federal agencies. The requirements within the FAR include applicable provisions 
with references to address information security and privacy as part of the acquisition 
process. These requirements include
• FAR 7.103(u)—“Ensuring that agency planners on information technology 
acquisitions comply with the information technology security requirements in 
the Federal Information Security Management Act (44 US C. 3544), OMB’s 
implementing policies including Appendix III of OMB Circular A-130, and guidance 
and standards from the Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards 
and Technology” [8].
• FAR 11.102—“Agencies shall select existing requirements documents or develop 
new requirements documents that meet the needs of the agency in accordance with 
the guidance contained in the Federal Standardization Manual, FSPM-0001; for 
DoD components, DoD 4120.24-M, Defense Standardization Program Policies and 
Procedures; and for IT standards and guidance, the Federal Information Processing 
Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS)” [9].
• FAR 39.101(d)—“In acquiring information technology, agencies shall include the 
appropriate information technology security policies and requirements, including use of 
common security configurations available from the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology’s website at http://checklists.nist.gov. Agency contracting officers should consult 
with the requiring official to ensure the appropriate standards are incorporated” [10].
• FAR 52.239-1(a) “Contractor shall not publish or disclose in any manner, without the 
Contracting Officer’s written consent, the details of any safeguards either designed 
or developed by the Contractor under this contract or otherwise provided by the 
Government.” [13].
• FAR 52.239-1(b) “To the extent required to carry out a program of inspection to 
safeguard against threats and hazards to the security, integrity, and confidentiality of 
Government data, the Contractor shall afford the Government access to the Contractor’s 
facilities, installations, technical capabilities, operations, documentation, records, and 
databases.” 
• FAR 52.239-1(c) “If new or unanticipated threats or hazards are discovered by either 
the Government or the Contractor, or if existing safeguards have ceased to function, 
the discoverer shall immediately bring the situation to the attention of the other 
party.”

FedRAMP Cloud Computing Security Requirements
system within a target operating environment. The decisions made during the risk 
management activities aid in establishing the risk-based information such as 
assumptions, constraints, and rationale needed for addressing security within the 
information system. This information supports the implementation of security con­
trols based on a risk-based approach that requires an understanding of the potential 
impacts to the organization’s mission or business processes and those organizations 
that rely upon the information system. The potential impact is based on the com­
promise of one or more security objectives43 (i.e., loss of confidentiality, integrity, 
or availability).
Some information systems are in the development process (i.e., new develop­
ment), while others may already be in production (i.e., legacy). Depending on the 
state of the information system, security controls may be part of the initial require­
ments definition or applied as part of the change management function. If the infor­
mation system is in the development process, the integration of security controls 
can be applied as part of the normal system development lifecycle (SDLC).44 How­
ever, if the information system is already in production, a gap analysis approach 
can be used to assist the organization in fully understanding what is in place and 
what additional security controls will need to be applied to address the differences 
in the requirements gap. In some circumstances, compensating security controls 
may even need to be identified and applied where existing security controls that are 
already in place have been determined to be insufficient to effectively mitigate 
potential risks.
CSPs can apply similar techniques when implementing the FedRAMP security 
controls. Since cloud services may present different risks than traditional IT environ­
ments, the CSP should conduct an additional analysis to identify where the gaps exist 
(i.e., within the different cloud service models and technology implementations) and 
who has the overall responsibility (CSP or federal agency) for addressing the weak­
nesses or deficiencies. As an example, Figure 9.3 illustrates a high-level gap analysis 
exercise that CSPs could use to identify the gaps in their security capabilities and 
features based on what is built in.

deployed as a unified set to achieve a desired security capability. The loss of one security objective (e.g. 
integrity) can adversely affect the other objectives (e.g. confidentiality and availability). When select-
ing security controls for nondisclosure purposes, organizations consider the security categorization 
of user data and system-level data—where system data may require stronger protection in the form of 
additional security controls.”

FedRAMP Cloud Computing Security Requirements
The gap analysis exercise include the following three steps [11]:
1.	 Classifying the service against the cloud model (e.g., IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS).
2.	 Map the existing security architecture against the cloud model.
3.	 Map the FedRAMP security requirements (identified as the compliance model) 
against the security architecture and the cloud model.
Using the steps in the gap analysis exercise, CSPs can use the preliminary infor­
mation to complete the first 3 steps of the NIST RMF,47 including determining the 
potential gaps in achieving the target FedRAMP security control baselines (low- or 
moderate-impact) based on their own application of the information security catego­
rization process when completing the Federal Information Processing Standards 
(FIPS) 199 worksheet. In addition, this information can help them begin the process 
of documenting the Control Tailoring Workbook (CTW) and CIS, both discussed in 
Chapter 8.
FedRAMP Security Control Requirements
The FedRAMP security control requirements provide the minimum security control 
baseline requirements for cloud computing environments. These security controls 
were based on the minimum assurance requirements included in the NIST SP 800-53 
[4] and the FedRAMP Security Controls [12].
47Chapter 5 discussed the risk management activities involved in the application of the Risk Manage-
ment Framework (RMF).
TIP
Some CSPs have already aligned with other regulatory or industry control frameworks such 
as ISO/IEC/27001 27002, ISACA COBIT, PCI DSS, and NIST 800-53. Therefore, the 
Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Control Matrix (CCM)45 provides an industry 
consensus framework that has been developed as a tool46 for use by CSPs to integrate 
FedRAMP into their existing integrated security framework and to assist CSPs in 
conducting a crosswalk to determine the differences in their existing security and 
compliance program with the FedRAMP security requirements.

CHAPTER 9  The FedRAMP Cloud Computing Security Requirements 
SUMMARY
This chapter provided a detailed discussion of the FedRAMP security controls, 
including the security selection process used by the JAB. In addition, specific issues 
regarding to roles and responsibilities were highlighted at they relate to the delinea­
tion of responsibility for security controls and situations where shared responsibili­
ties would require defining the scope that would need to be addressed in governing 
policies and procedures. The governance and maintenance of the FedRAMP security 
requirements were briefly discussed, focusing on the application of a harmonizing 
process to incorporate industry feedback and agency-specific security and privacy. 
Finally, the FedRAMP security control requirements were described, to include 
potential approaches for implementing the security controls, both in existing or 
new cloud services with an emphasis on applying a gap analysis or integrating them 
through a traditional SDLC.

INFORMATION IN THIS CHAPTER:
•	 Introduction to the Security Assessment Process
•	 Governing the Security Assessment
•	 Preparing for the Security Assessment
•	 Executing the Security Assessment Plan
INTRODUCTION TO THE SECURITY ASSESSMENT PROCESS
The security assessment process is a key component of the NIST Risk Management 
Framework (RMF)1 and the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program 
(FedRAMP).2 FedRAMP3 enables the adoption and use of cloud services through a 
cost-effective, risk-based approach that ensures security assessments are an integral part 
of the system development life cycle (SDLC).4 FedRAMP also enables federal agencies 
to benefit from the application of a security risk model that allows them to leverage the 
authorization through a unified, consistent security assessment framework.
The goal of a security assessment is to establish confidence that the security con­
trols employed within the information system (or those inherited) have been effec­
tively implemented and are operating as intended. Security assessments conducted at 
1Chapter 5 discussed the risk management activities involved in the application of the Risk Manage-
ment Framework (RMF).

ing for cloud products and services.”

land: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2008. “Security planning in the initiation phase 
should include preparations for the entire system life cycle, including the identification of key security 
milestones and deliverables, and tools and technologies. Special consideration should be given to 
items that may need to be procured (e.g. test/assessment tools).”

different stages throughout the SDLC,5 can benefit organizations by reducing costs 
through the reuse of evidence produced through the design, implementation, and 
testing of the required security controls. By identifying the gaps in security require­
ments early in the SDLC process,6 some security controls can be more cost-effec­
tively designed and implemented within the information security architecture,7 and 
tested8 prior to being fully integrated into the production operating environment.
The authorization step relies upon the quality of the evidence and the results of 
the security assessment documented in the security assessment report (SAR). The 
SAR is one of the three key documents presented to the authorizing official (AO)9 
when making a credible, risk-based decision. The AO uses the information from the 
security assessment results10 as a factor for assuming responsibility for the informa­
tion systems operation and the information that will be processed, stored, or trans­
mitted within the information system. Through an analysis of the risk associated with 
the weaknesses and deficiencies identified during the security assessment, the AO 
can use the judgment of the assessor to make a determination if they are deemed to

in parallel with the development/acquisition and implementation phases of the life cycle permits the 
identification of weaknesses and deficiencies early and provides the most cost-effective method for 
initiating corrective actions. The results of security control assessments carried out during system 
development and implementation can also be used (consistent with reuse criteria) during the security 
authorization process to avoid system fielding delays or costly repetition of assessments.”

generic system development life cycle: (i) initiation; (ii) development/acquisition; (iii) implementation; 
(iv) operations and maintenance; and (v) disposition (disposal).”

National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2008. For example, “testing of basic security controls 
during functional testing may reduce or eliminate issues earlier in the development cycle (e.g. manda-
tory access controls, secure code development, and firewalls).”
9The FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB) only grants a provisional authorization for cloud 
services that have undergone a FedRAMP assessment with an accredited Third Party Assessment 
Organization (3PAO) which enables federal agencies to accept the risk-based decision for granting 
their own authorization, or federal agencies can conduct their own assessment utilizing the FedRAMP 
assessment process and a 3PAO for making a risk-based decision.

ments carried out during system development and implementation can also be used (consistent with

be acceptable. This reliance on the quality and reliability of the results of the security 
assessment places a significant importance on the selection of the independent secu­
rity assessment provider (or security assessor).11 The security assessment provider 
must be qualified and competent in conducting security assessments and capable of 
assessing the security controls, including compiling the evidence needed to demon­
strate the effectiveness of the security controls employed within the information sys­
tem. In addition the security assessor must be able to effectively present the evidence 
in a manner that enables a risk-based decision to be made.
In this chapter, the NIST RMF Step 4 (Assessment) and Step 5 (Authorization) 
steps will be discussed, with the focus on assisting organizations in developing their 
organization-wide strategy by presenting a framework for managing security assess­
ments. The framework includes three key areas:
• 
Governance.
• 
Preparation.
• 
Execution.
GOVERNANCE IN THE SECURITY ASSESSMENT
The security assessment policy establishes the governance for the security ­assessment 
process. The policy, at a minimum, should cover the requirements for the security 
assessment preparation and execution, the methodology by which the security assess­
ment is directed and guided, and the roles and responsibilities. The security assess­
ment methodology establishes a repeatable framework for conducting security 
assessments through the consistent and structured application of assessment proce­
dures, processes, methods, and practices [4]. The methodology12 also addresses the 
11From Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53A Revision 
1, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems and Organizations. Mary-
land: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2010. “An independent assessor is any indi-
vidual or group capable of conducting an impartial assessment of security controls employed within or 
inherited by an information system.”

Assessment, Appendix E includes some example methodologies. Available from: http://csrc.nist.gov/­

NOTE
The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) provides a 
structured, policy-driven process for building a trusted relationship between Cloud Service 
Providers (CSP) and federal agency customers. In addition, it supports the acceleration, 
and secure adoption and use of commercial and non-commercial cloud services through 
a cost-effective, risk-based approach to security authorization by integrating security 
assessment as a part of the system development life cycle (SDLC). FedRAMP also enables 
federal agencies to benefit from the application of a security risk model that allows them 
to leverage the authorization through a unified, consistent security assessment framework.

CHAPTER 10  Security Assessment and Authorization
approach the organization will use for determining the reuse of security assessment 
results and how the security assessment will be conducted.
There are generally two primary roles in security assessments, the security assess­
ment customer and the security assessment provider.13 Security assessment customers 
and providers can be from the same organization or the provider can be contracted 
from a public or private entity outside of the customer organization. However, to ensure 
the effectiveness and efficiency of security assessments, a degree of independence is 
critical, specifically for reusing previous assessment results.14 For example, security 
assessment-related documentation and evidence could be produced from testing con­
ducted as an integrated part of the SDLC15 or from third-party testing 16 [5]“if an 
information system component product is identified as providing support for the 
implementation of a particular security control” [1].
Security assessments can also include assessment results from other security 
assessments performed from outside of the organization. In these situations, factors 
relating to the security assessment results for security controls outside of the boundary 
for the information system being assessed must consider the credibility of the results 
being inherited,17 partially or completely, at the organization-level (i.e., information 
security program) rather than the information at system-level to preserve impartiality. 
13From Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative Interagency Working Group. NIST Special Publication 
(SP) 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information 
Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 
2010. The security assessment provider can be an “individual, group, or organization responsible for 
conducting a comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and technical security controls 
employed within or inherited by an information system to determine the overall effectiveness of the con-

appropriate level of independence to ensure the segregation of responsibilities and 
accountability for maintaining security assessment results.

In the FedRAMP Policy Memo, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defined four 
key stakeholders:
• Joint Authorization Board (JAB)—US Department of Defense (DoD), US General 
Services Administration (GSA), and US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
• FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO).
• DHS.
• Federal Agencies.
The FedRAMP PMO described the role of these four stakeholders in the Frequently Asked 
Question (FAQ) [8]. “Who are the key organizations involved in FedRAMP?” In addition, 
several other roles described in the FAQ were indentified as having a direct and indirect 
responsibility within FedRAMP. The other roles include:
• National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
• Federal CIO Council.
• Third Party Assessor Organizations (3PAO).
• Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).
The JAB approves the accreditation criteria for third-party assessment organizations 
(3PAOs) to provide independent assessments of CSPs’ implementation of the FedRAMP 
security authorization requirements [6]. NIST, which has been given responsibilities under 
FISMA,19 is responsible for developing the standards and guidelines used within 
FedRAMP. NIST also plays a supplementary support function indirectly supporting 
FedRAMP through the establishment of training frameworks20 and education programs.21 
The FedRAMP PMO coordinated and collaborated with the NIST to develop and implement 
a formal conformity assessment program22 to accredit 3PAOs to provide independent 
assessments of how CSPs implement the FedRAMP requirements [7].

CHAPTER 10  Security Assessment and Authorization
PREPARING FOR THE SECURITY ASSESSMENT
Security assessments can be a challenging, time-consuming, and costly activity if the 
security assessment customer does not appropriately plan and prepare for the security 
assessment activities. Even before selecting the security assessment provider, the secu­
rity assessment customer needs to understand its objectives and the information needed 
to support decisions regarding the impact associated with using an information system. 
In addition, security assessments can become even more complex, specifically in multi-
level or multi-service provider relationships, where security assessment activities may 
be distributed between more than one service provider. Thereby more focus is required 
to be placed on the coordination activities, to ensure sufficient information is made 
available to the security assessor. This situation may also require either working through 
requests from the other service providers to participate in a security assessment of all of 
the security controls or to obtain the security assessment results23 to be included within 
the current security assessment to inform the security assessment customer.
From the initiation of the security assessment,24 both parties’ involvement is 
essential to ensure the preparatory (pre-assessment) activities conclude with an exe­
cutable plan for the assessment. As illustrated in Figure 10.1, the security assess­
ment process requires the participation from both the assessment customer and 
the security assessment provider. During the security assessment,25 the security

24Process for determining how effectively an object of the assessment meets identified security 
objectives.
25From Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53A Revision 
1, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems and Organizations. Mary-
land: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2010. “Security control assessments are not 
about checklists, simple pass-fail results, or generating paperwork to pass inspections or audits-rather, 
security controls assessments are the principle vehicle used to verify that the implementers and opera-
tors of the information system are meeting their state security goals and objectives.”
NOTE
Why is FedRAMP accrediting 3PAOs? [8]
Although there currently is no standard or guidance for choosing a 3PAO, the FedRAMP 
PMO and NIST have designed a conformity assessment process to ensure the 
independence of and the management and technical quality of 3PAOs using a standard 
and consistent security assessment process.
When is a 3PAO required? [8]
CSPs that go through FedRAMP must use a 3PAO to provide an independent verification 
and validation of the security implementations required by FedRAMP. FedRAMP 
provisional authorizations must include an assessment by a FedRAMP-accredited 3PAO to 
ensure a consistent assessment process.

Preparing for the Security Assessment
assessment team will rely heavily on the participation and knowledge of the security 
assessment customer to ensure there is an impartial and objective report of the secu­
rity control effectiveness, and also a quality assessment, which provides key infor­
mation needed for decision-makers. This information includes details about the 
deficiencies and weaknesses that, if compromised (i.e., security controls designed to 
assure the level of confidentiality, integrity, and availability), could impact mission 
and business functions supported through the use of the information system. After 
the security assessment (post-assessment), the SAR is generated to build an

assurance case.26 The SAR provides a summary of the security-related information 
needed for establishing a credible, risk-based decision.
Security Assessment Customer Responsibilities
The customer of the security assessment plays an essential role in the proper planning 
of the security assessment activities. The security assessment customer is responsible 
for implementing the security controls, but also has the responsibility of appropriately 
selecting a qualified security assessment provider, and in determining the objective and 
scope of the security assessment. In parallel with the preparation activities, the security 
assessment customer should, at minimum, conduct its own security readiness review. 27 
The security readiness review ensures the appropriate security-related information has 
been organized in a manner that can easily be evaluated by the security assessor. The 
security assessor uses the security-related information to gain an understanding of the 
organization’s mission and business functions, how those functions are supported by 
the information system, and how the security controls have been implemented to meet 
the minimum assurance requirements. The information provided by the security assess­
ment customer should also include a description of any security controls that have not 
been fully implemented or are planned to ensure the necessary scope is clearly under­
stood for developing an effective security assessment plan (SAP).28
Selecting a Security Assessment Provider
The security assessment customer must use its “best judgment” when selecting a 
security assessment provider to ensure there is an adequate level of indepen­
dence or there is no conflict of interest, and the security assessment provider has 
the necessary technical expertise (i.e., knowledge,29 skills,30 and abilities31).

337
Preparing for the Security Assessment
The independence32 is critical when multiple organizations are responsible for 
the security control implementations. Therefore, the security assessment cus­
tomer should determine the most appropriate approach to ensure there is a neces­
sary separation33 between the security assessment provider and those involved in 
the development, operations, and management of the information system. This is 
specifically important when the security assessment customer used a different 
security assessment provider to develop evidence that will be reused in the cur­
rent security assessment, or uses the same provider for other security-related 
services such as implementing remediations/mitigations. In these situations, 
having the security assessment results reviewed by an independent expert could 
assist in verifying they are accurate and complete to ensure they are still valid as 
an objective determination of the state of the security control implementation 
and effectiveness.

CHAPTER 10  Security Assessment and Authorization
Security Assessment Planning
The security assessment customer also plays a central role in ensuring the security 
assessment is conducted effectively and efficiently. In its role, the security assess­
ment customer must ensure that it is not only ready for the security assessment 
by performing its own readiness review, but it also needs to provide the necessary 
information (e.g., evidence of prior assessments and artifacts describing security 
control implementation) and make the resources (e.g., information system access 
and knowledgeable personnel) available to support the security assessment. The 
security-relevant information helps security assessors understand the scope of the 
information system and the security controls being assessed. The more complete 
and accurate the information, the more tailored the security assessor can make the 
SAP and supporting assessment procedures. Therefore, prior to the security assess­
ment, the security assessment customer should identify the scope of the assessment 
and the system components that will be the target of the security assessment. For 
example, scoping the security assessment could include identifying the number 
and types of components (i.e., a homogeneous environment which has been con­
sistently configured generally may require less depth or coverage) and determining 
resource requirements (i.e., accessibility/complexity of the operating environment 
and use of automated tools versus manual evaluation or inspections techniques).
After the scoping has been completed, the security assessment customer should 
focus on gathering the security-relevant information for the security assessment pro­
vider to evaluate so that a realistic schedule can be developed for conducting the 
security assessment. Security-relevant information gathered and provided during the 
security assessment planning can include the following types of information:
• 
Organizational and system-specific security policies and procedures.
• 
Descriptions of security control implementation and roles and responsibilities 
for security controls (e.g., system security plan, standard operating procedures, 
system diagrams, design documents service level agreements, interconnection 
agreements, contracts, accreditation packages for common controls, etc.).
• 
Documents that were developed in support of security control implementa­
tion (e.g., contingency plan, risk assessments, incident response plans, plan of 
action, and milestones, etc.).
• 
Any extracts from the information system (e.g., audit logs, configuration set­
tings, firewall and intrusion detection/prevention rulesets,38 evidence generated 
from previous security assessments, etc.).
• 
Inventories and hardware/software specifications.

Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment. Maryland: National Institute of Stan-
dards and Technology; 2008. “A ruleset is a collection of rules or signatures that network traffic or 
system activity is compared against to determine what action to take.”

339
Preparing for the Security Assessment
During the security assessment, the security assessor may require assistance 
from security assessment customer personnel who may have knowledge about how 
security controls are managed or were integrated into the information system and 
the operational environment. The security assessment customer should make avail­
able key personnel who would need to be interviewed or participate (i.e., conducting 
security testing) in the security assessment. Depending on the scope of the assess­
ment, coordination and collaboration may be required to limit impacts on the secu­
rity assessment customer’s ongoing operations or existing customers that rely on 
the services provided by the target information system. Therefore, participation by 
the security assessment customer is essential to ensure security assessment activities 
being performed in support of the security assessment are aligned with the agreed-to 
schedule and milestones.
Security Assessment Provider Responsibilities
The security assessment provider should have a management structure that can 
deliver a quality security assessment and the technical capabilities to effectively 
execute the given security assessment. The results of the security assessment execu­
tion should provide key decision-makers within the security assessment customer 
organization (or organizational official(s) that are responsible for making the autho­
rization decision) with the needed security-related information (and supporting evi­
dence) to make a credible, risk-based decision. These security assessment results are 
compiled by the security assessment provider through the execution of a variety of 
methods40 and techniques and supported by the management structure41 and opera­
tional/management systems to ensure the consistency and reliability of the security 
assessment process, and the quality, accuracy, and completeness of the security-
related information.
40Assessment methods include testing (exercising an assessment object to compare results—expected 
vs. actual), examining (process used to facilitate understanding how a security control is implemented 
by examining an assessment object), and interviewing (process used to facilitate understanding how a 
security control is implemented by conducting interview with organizational personnel).

CHAPTER 10  Security Assessment and Authorization
Selection of Security Assessment Team Members
Similar to the security assessment customer role of selecting a security assessment 
provider, the security assessment provider has an obligation of conducting due dili­
gence when selecting team members that have the knowledge and expertise in con­
ducting an assessment of the target information system, including experience with 
the technologies, and also familiarity with the applicable governing federal informa­
tion security laws, directives, policies, standards, and guidelines.
Developing the Security Assessment Plan (SAP)
The SAP provides the roadmap for executing the security assessment. In the SAP, the 
rules42 by which the security assessment provider conducts the security assessment 
are documented to ensure the security assessment customer understands and agrees

tion security testing.”
NOTE
FedRAMP 3PAOs must maintain a management system and technical competence and 
capability to ensure assessment of cloud services are performed consistently and in 
compliance with the FedRAMP requirements. The FedRAMP management and technical 
requirements are summarized as follows:
Management Requirements [2]:
• Conducting inspections and maintain a quality management system in accordance with 
ISO/IEC 17020.
• Ensuring security assessment team members are competent in performing security 
assessments.
• Ensuring the protection of proprietary information received as part of the assessment.
Technical Requirements [2]:
• Maintaining knowledge, understanding, and competency in the application of the 
FedRAMP program security assessment standards, guidelines, and requirements and 
cloud-based information system-related technologies and practices.
• Maintaining knowledge and understanding in the use of NIST publications and 
programs.
• Selecting personnel that collectively have the relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities 
for conducting a security assessment on a given cloud-based information system.
• Preparing an SAP consistent with the FedRAMP requirement, including reviewing the 
SAP with the cloud service provider.
• Conducting a security assessment with the SAP and preparing a SAR consistent with 
the FedRAMP requirements.
The requirements established by the FedRAMP PMO ensure the resulting security 
assessment results and supporting evidence can be leveraged by multiple federal agencies 
through a single FedRAMP security authorization package.

Preparing for the Security Assessment
to the scope of the assessment and also the types of activities that will be performed. 
The SAP could also include any applicable assumptions and legal considerations 
(i.e., limitations of liability or non-disclosures to protect both the security assessment 
customer should any significant issues that occur during or after the assessment). 
Although the primary responsibility for the development of the SAP is usually the 
security assessment provider, it should be developed in collaboration with the secu­
rity assessment customer to ensure the following key points are covered:
• 
Scope—number of components and locations, the types of assessment (or 
objective), and the depth/coverage.
• 
Authorizations—networks and systems identified by IP address or range and 
hostname.
• 
Logistics—resource requirements, availability of the location and environment, 
and testing tools.
• 
Data handling—storage and physical/logical safeguards for data stored at-
rest and during transmission, and destruction/sanitization of data after the 
assessment.
• 
Incident response—definition of the incident and actions that should be taken 
or guidelines that should be followed by all parties.
The development of the SAP also requires completing several steps to address the 
key points are covered either within the SAP directly or referenced externally in other 
contractual documents (e.g., authorization memorandum, engagement or arrange­
ment letter, service agreement, rules of engagement (ROE), service contracts, etc.).
Identify In-Scope Security Controls
The security assessor in the development the SAP must first consider the type of 
assessment, complete or partial, and the security controls described in the system 
security plan (SSP), in-place or planned, for meeting the security assessment cus­
tomer’s security requirements. A complete assessment is usually performed during 
the initial authorization or where significant changes have occurred and the scope of 
the changes cannot be isolated to a specific set of controls and therefore all security 
controls will be in-scope for the security assessment. A partial assessment only 
focuses on a subset of security controls. The subset of security controls can be those 
selected as part of the continuous (or ongoing) monitoring activities, security testing 
performed as part of the normal SDLC which includes assessing a specific set of 
security controls implemented within the change control process (assuming the 
scope of the change can be bounded), or where previous assessment occurred and 
were leveraged, but additional security controls were included to supplement the 
security control baseline to address unique organizational security requirements. 
After the purpose of the security assessment has been determined, the SSP and the 
Continuous Monitoring Strategy43 are reviewed to select the security controls that 
43Continuous Monitoring is discussed in detailed in Chapter 11, Strategies for Continuous Monitoring.

342
CHAPTER 10  Security Assessment and Authorization
would be considered in-scope for the assessment and be used for the remainder of the 
steps in the SAP development.
Select Assessment Procedures
The security controls identified in the previous step are used by the security assess­
ment provider in selecting the initial set of security assessment procedures.44 Assess­
ment procedures provide a framework for building assurance cases by demonstrating 
the effectiveness of security controls implemented within the current operating envi­
ronment. For each security control selected in the SSP, a complementary assessment 
procedure is selected. For example, Table 10.1 provides the assessment procedure for 
CA-2 (Security Assessment).
Assessment procedures include one or more objectives for the assessment. The 
assessment objectives consist of a series of determination statements,45 which map to 
the functionality of the security control and assist the security assessor in demon­
strating the extent to which a security control is implemented correctly, operates as 
intended, and produces the desired outcome. In addition, within each assessment 
objective, methods and objects are used by the security assessment provider during 
the security assessment. The assessment methods 46 and objects 47 together define the 
specific actions taken and items selected by the security assessor to produce a finding 
(or determination of effectiveness) for the security assessment. In Table 10.1, the 
assessment method for the CA-2.2 assessment objective contains two different types 
of assessment methods, examine and interview. The security assessor can use one or 
both methods to make a determination if the assessment objective is achieved. For 
the examination assessment method, the security assessor can choose from the iden­
tified assessment objects (or other objects not included on the list) to produce the 
necessary information for the assessor to make a determination of the assessment 
objective.

CHAPTER 10  Security Assessment and Authorization
Tailor Assessment Procedures
Assessment tailoring involves customizing the assessment procedure to more closely 
reflect the characteristics of the information system and the operating environment. 
Customization may be conducted at the organizational level, information system level, 
or both. The goal of tailoring assessment procedures is to produce the most accurate 
representation of the security assessment actions necessary to make a determination 
in the most cost-effective manner. Some assessment procedures may require more 
tailoring than others or, depending on the phase of the SDLC in which the security 
assessment is being performed, the assessment procedures may be tailored to focus 
on a specific aspect of the information system. For example, security assessments 
conducted during the development/acquisition phase can be tailored to focus on test­
ing very specific functionality to identify deficiencies or weaknesses that may be 
more costly to remediate in later phases of the SDLC process.
Tailoring involves applying considerations50 to help guide the selection of poten­
tial activities focused on during the assessment. The security assessment customer 
may provide guidance to assist the security assessor in determining the level of the 
assessment tailoring that is appropriate for the given assessment. The level of tailoring 
could also depend on factors such as the available timing and scope for the security 
assessment. In this chapter we will only focus on two of the tailoring considerations:
• 
Selecting assessment methods and objects.
• 
Selecting depth and coverage attributes.
50NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53A Revision 1, Section 3.2.3 contains a list of consideration 
for tailoring assessment procedures that could include (1) selecting assessment method and object, (2) 
selecting depth and coverage attribute values, (3) identifying common controls, (4) developing infor-
mation system/platform-specific and organization-specific assessments, (5) incorporating assessment 
results from previous assessments, and (6) obtaining evidence from external providers.
TIP
Assessment procedures can form the basis for developing assessment cases.48 Assessment 
cases provide a tool for security assessment customers (e.g., federal agency, CSP, 
communities of interest, etc.) by providing a specific set of assessor actions. The 
assessment cases represent the specific viewpoint of the community that developed them 
and present the necessary actions that should be taken to cost-effectively conduct the 
security assessment. Similar to the security control selection process,49 tailoring and 
supplementation is applied to the baseline assessment cases.

Assessment Cases.

Risk Management Framework.

Preparing for the Security Assessment
Selecting Assessment Methods and Objects. Security assessors have various 
options available when selecting assessment methods and objects. Each assess­
ment procedure provides potential options. However, assessors are not necessar­
ily limited to those included in the baseline assessment procedures to obtain the 
evidence needed to support the determination of security control effectiveness. The 
actions performed by the security assessors and the types of objects selected for the 
assessment can be obtained by reviewing the information provided by the security 
assessment customer as part of the preparatory activities. For example, the SSP 
and supporting artifacts provided to the security assessors could provide valuable 
insight into how a particular security control was implemented and what types of 
methods (e.g., examine, interview, and test) and objects (e.g., specifications, mecha­
nisms, activities, and individuals) would be required for producing evidence and a 
determination of security control effectiveness.
Selecting Depth and Coverage Attributes. Security assessors also have options for 
defining the depth and coverage of assessment procedures. The depth and coverage 
attributes51 represent the rigor and scope of the assessment and impact the level of 
effort required for conducting the security assessment. The more detailed the assess­
ment activities, the more resource intensive and time-consuming. However, the more 
detailed the security assessment, the greater the level of assurance that a particular 
security control implemented within the information system meets the required secu­
rity objectives. Although not specifically identifiable52 in assessment procedures like 
the methods and objects, the depth and coverage become important factors when 
building the assurance case during the security assessment execution.
Supplementing Assessment Procedures
The security assessment provider may need to supplement the assessment pro­
cedures where security controls unique to an organization or information system 
do not exist in the baseline security controls (or the assessment procedures do not 
exist). This could occur where the organization has supplemented the baseline secu­
rity controls to adequately mitigate organizational-specific risks. In this situation, 
the additional security controls documented in the SSP would require the security 
assessor in collaboration with the security assessment customer to develop new 
assessment procedures.
51Basic, focused, and comprehensive.
52NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53A Revision 1, Appendix D contains detailed information on 
the depth and coverage. In addition, examples of how depth and coverage are applied are shown in the 
“Potential Assessors Evidence Gathering Actions” in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53A Revision 
1, Appendix H.

346
CHAPTER 10  Security Assessment and Authorization
Optimize Assessment Procedures
Optimizing security assessments involves the consolidation or sequencing of assess­
ment procedures to reduce the cost of an associated security assessment. In this activ­
ity, the security assessor organizes the assessment procedures in the most efficient 
way that would enable executing assessment methods and selecting the assessment 
objects in a manner most likely to produce the desired evidence. For example, some 
assessment procedures may focus on different aspects of the same control, or dif­
ferent security controls may be integrated into the same components or be related. 
Therefore, sequencing assessment procedures may facilitate efficiency and reuse of 
security assessment results.
Finalize and Approve Assessment Plan
Once the SAP has been completed and the assessment procedures have been selected, 
tailored, and optimized, the security assessment provider must obtain approval from 
the security assessment customer. This approval acknowledges acceptance and gives 
the security assessor permission to begin executing the SAP in accordance with the 
schedule and milestones.
EXECUTING THE SECURITY ASSESSMENT PLAN
The formal approval of the SAP gives the security assessment provider the authoriza­
tion to begin conducting the security assessment. The SAP utilizes a variety of meth­
ods, techniques, and tools during the course of executing the assessment procedures. 
The assessment procedure provides the necessary information for determining the 
depth and scope, and will enable the security assessor to select the appropriate testing 
methodology for the particular type of security assessment. For example, where the 
security assessment requires conducting penetration testing,53 the security assessor 
usually focuses on a scoped and controlled set of components that attempt to identify 
an attacker (or class of attackers). Since the attackers must operate under constraints, 
the characterization of the attacker and the tools and techniques54 will be very spe­
cialized to the assessment procedure being executed.

347
Executing the Security Assessment Plan
During the security assessment, results are produced and documented through 
actions associated with each assessment objective where selected methods and 
objects were applied. The security assessment results establish a conclusion about 
the determination of whether the objectives for the security control have been 
achieved. The evidence to support the determination is collected and a summary is 
documented by the security assessor that provides the basis for the finding. Since 
the findings are meant to be unbiased and objective, the security assessor must pres­
ent in detail the rationale for why a particular assessment objective was documented 
as either satisfied (S) or other than satisfied (O).55 The rationale for establishing an 
“O” finding may be due to issues other than the security control ineffectiveness. 
The other issues could include the inability of the security assessor to make a deter­
mination where information was insufficient or the unavailability of a particular 
information system component under examination that was needed for making the 
determination.
For the security assessment results produced, the security assessment customer 
should review the findings with specific emphasis on those determinations which 
result in an “O” finding to determine the significance and to assist in prioritizing 
findings when developing corrective actions based on the recommendation provided 
by the security assessor. In addition, the review of the findings may also give an 
indication there was a lack of understanding by the security assessor of how the

1, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems and Organizations. Mary-
land: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2010. “For each finding of other than satisfied, 
assessors indicate which parts of the security control are affected by the finding (i.e. aspects of the 
control that were deemed not satisfied or were not able to be assessed) and describe how the control 
differs from the planned or expected state.”
TIP
The FedRAMP Security Controls Baseline for Moderate-Impact cloud services requires 
the CSP in CA-7 (Continuous Monitoring) to plan, schedule, and conduct assessments 
annually that include unannounced penetration testing and in-depth monitoring to ensure 
compliance with all vulnerability mitigation plans [3]. In addition, in RA-5 (Vulnerability 
Scanning), the CSP is required to employ an independent penetration agent or penetration 
team to conduct a vulnerability analysis, perform penetration testing based on the analysis 
of the vulnerabilities to determine their exploitability [3].
The assessment procedures for CA and RA will likely evaluate compliance of the 
CSP by examining the risk assessment and security assessment policies and procedure, 
the continuous monitoring plan, vulnerability scan results, and records of vulnerability 
mitigations and penetration to determine if the CSP, given the existing vulnerabilities 
within the cloud service, conducted penetration testing (where applicable). The security 
assessor could conduct formal interviews with CSP personnel that would have the role and 
responsibility for coordinating and supporting penetration testing, and ensuring the testing 
was conducted in accordance with the vulnerability mitigation procedures.

security controls were implemented in the SSP and the security assessment customer 
may need to provide further clarification to ensure the most accurate reflection of the 
effectiveness of the security controls is documented in the SAR.
SUMMARY
This chapter provided an introduction to the application of the NIST RMF security 
assessment process. A three-step framework was presented that covered governing the 
assessment, preparing for the assessment, and executing the assessment. Additionally, 
the roles and responsibilities for the security assessment provider and security assessment 
customer were discussed as they relate to the assessment framework. Finally, the assess­
ment process was covered to address specific factors at each stage of the assessment, to 
include planning the assessment, executing the assessment, and reporting the security 
assessment results.

INTRODUCTION TO CONTINUOUS MONITORING
Continuous1 monitoring (CM)2 is an organizational-wide activity that supports risk 
management by enabling an organization to understand and maintain its information 
security and risk posture through the collection, analysis, monitoring, and reporting 
of security-related information. To be effective, CM needs to be driven by the orga­
nization’s management to ensure it is managed as a part of the enterprise-wide risk 
management activity. This ensures monitoring is considered outside the context of a 
single information system, but rather as an integrated part of the organization’s risk 
management function. CM begins by defining the CM strategy. The CM strategy 
links to the organizational strategies, goals, and objectives, and ensures there is a 
common understanding of organizational-wide risk tolerance. The risk tolerance is 
used when determining how to develop and execute a CM program that includes

tasks3 such as collecting and reporting on metrics, conducting and reporting security 
control assessments, planning, controlling, and maintaining change management and 
configuration control, conducting risk assessments and prioritizing risk responses.
The broader CM activity within an organization is implemented through the exe­
cution of three major foundational elements:
• 
Organizational governance.
• 
CM strategy.
• 
CM program.
These elements operate together to ensure CM is conducted as an organizational-
wide activity that includes the participation from both those responsible for defining 
the strategy for the organization and those responsible for the day-to-day manage­
ment of information systems. A common CM approach across the organization 
enables each level of the organization to more effectively communicate and share 
3Note, this is not a complete list of activities that can be included within an organization’s continuous 
monitoring program needed to maintain a situational awareness of the information system and operat-
ing environment.
NOTE
CM is not necessarily a new requirement for the federal government. Historically, as far 
back as 1995, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) introduced the 
concept, as one of two activities4 used to support operational assurance.5 At that time 
monitoring was simply defined as an “ongoing activity that checks on the system, its users, 
or the environment” [1]. In Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, 
Appendix III,6 a government-wide policy was established for federal agencies to review 
security controls on an ongoing basis through the use of technical tools and techniques.7 
The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) codified CM, by requiring 
federal agencies to monitor, test, and evaluate information security controls. However, it 
was not until the publication of the first revision of NIST SP 800-37 that the federal 
agencies had a systematic model for applying CM within the context of the System 
Development Lifecycle (SDLC). The NIST security certification and accreditation (C&A) 
process introduced CM in the forth phase.8
4The difference between system audits and monitoring focused on the notion of “real time.”

information that would support a cost-efficient, resilient, and timely9 risk manage­
ment strategy. The increasing reliance on information technology (IT) for supporting 
the organization’s mission and as a critical part of its business operations requires 
accurate and up-to-date information for making continuous risk-based decisions. 
Using a standardized CM approach enables the security- and risk-related information 
to be produced both cost-effectively and efficiently through a managed set of 
resources and processes.
Organizational Governance
The management of risk requires a “top-down” approach, led by management, with 
the establishment of the CM strategy. The CM strategy is implemented through a 
comprehensive CM program. The role of governance10 is to ensure the CM strategy 
is consistently applied through a CM program across the organization. The process 
for implementing CM, briefly introduced in this section and discussed in detail later 
in this chapter, requires an effective integration into the organization’s governance 
structure. Governance manages the CM strategy and program through the CM pro­
cesses, which include:
• 
Defining a strategy for continuous monitoring;
• 
Developing and implementing a CM program;
• 
Analyzing data and reporting findings;
• 
Responding to findings; and
• 
Reviewing and updating11 the ISCM strategy and program [2].
In Figure 11.1, the organization-wide view focuses on illustrating how CM sup­
ports the risk-based decisions made at the various levels within an organization. In 
the three-tiered model, tier 1 focuses on strategic CM activities that support gover­
nance12 decisions based on security-related information from the implementation of 
CM activities at tiers 2 and 3. The model also represents the alignment that must exist 
between the CM process and the risk management process, as discussed in

Publication (SP) 800-137, Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) for Federal Informa-
tion Systems and Organizations. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2011. 
Risk management decisions, assessment and responses need to be able to scale with emerging security 
issues, and any decision-making needs to be based on the most relevant and accurate information.
10Governance models are discussed in detail in Chapter 6, Risk Management.
11The CM strategy and program are viewed for relevance and are revised as needed to increase vis-
ibility into assets and awareness of vulnerabilities.

exercised by those responsible for an organization (e.g. the board of directors and executive management 
in a corporation, the head of a federal agency) with the express goal of: (i) providing strategic direction; 
(ii) ensuring that organizational mission and business objectives are achieved; (iii) ascertaining that risks 
are managed appropriately; and (iv) verifying that the organization’s resources are used responsibly.”

CHAPTER 11  Strategies for Continuous Monitoring
Chapter 6, so that the monitoring strategy produces information that is relevant and 
useful when making risk-related decisions at each organizational tier. Tier 1 addresses 
risk management from a strategic perspective by developing a governance policy that 
drives the CM strategy and communicates the organization’s risk management strat­
egy. In tier 2, CM security-related information is dependent on the specific impor­
tance of the mission/business processes to the overall organizational goals and 
objectives. Therefore, it is critical to have an understanding of the security impacts to 
ensure appropriate implementation of CM activities for information systems that 
support mission/business processes. In tier 3, CM activities focus on the information 
system-level security controls to ensure they implement the organization security 
requirements and continue to be effective over time.
Metrics13 developed at each tier guide the collection of security-related information 
used in making risk-based decisions. Therefore, it is important for organizations to 
select the most appropriate tools and techniques14 that present information in a format 
that will be useful for a specific organizational tier. The format also enables the data

that will be collected,15 correlated, analyzed, and reported to be effectively communi­
cated to provide stakeholders with the most accurate indication of the security pos­
ture.16 Since metrics are a key part17 of CM, the organization may need to refine and 
update18 the metrics so they “continue to be relevant, meaningful, actionable, and sup­
portive of risk management decisions made by organizational officials at all tiers” [2].
In addition, federal agencies have legislative and regulatory drivers for capturing 
metrics that enable them to measure19 the performance of security related to their 
program goals and objectives. The GPRA Modernization Act20 requires a quarterly 
performance assessment of all government programs to assess performance and 
improvement. The long-term strategic planning21 described in the GPRA Moderniza­
tion Act requires federal agencies to define performance goals22 and objectives, and 
the performance objectives that are reported on quarterly. Each performance plan 
includes “a balanced set of performance indicators to be used in measuring or assess­
ing progress toward each performance goal” [3]. FISMA23 requires federal agencies 
to report24 on the status of their information security programs. The annual FISMA

CM Strategy
The CM strategy aligns the CM activities with the organization-wide risk management 
strategy.25 Through an understanding of the organization’s strategic goals and objectives, 
the CM requirements can be developed to address the monitoring and assessment fre­
quency of security controls, and customize status reporting to ensure consistency across 
the organization. This further supports each of the organizational tier’s information needs 
required for making risk-based decisions. For the strategy to be effective and support the 
organization’s risk management function, it needs to be comprehensive, broadly encom­
passing the technology, processes, procedures, operating environment, and people [2].
The organization’s information requirements can be different at each of the orga­
nizational tiers, requiring strategies tailored specifically to a tier. Therefore, to meet 
the goal of maintaining consistency across the organization, the implementation of 
the organization-wide CM strategy needs to be driven by the leadership to ensure the 
CM strategy evolves as requirements for information change at each tier. In addition 
to enabling information reuse across the organization, a consistent understanding of 
the CM strategy ensures a cost-effective implementation of the processes, procedures, 
tools, and techniques to all organizational information systems, achieving a broad 
organization-wide situational awareness. The CM strategy can also help the organiza­
tion use an integrated approach to more efficiently react, such as by changes in a single 
information system or in the organization’s threat environment.
25From Dempsey, K., Nirali, C., Johnson, A., Johnston, R., Jones, A., Orebaugh, A., et al. NIST Special 
Publication (SP) 800-137, Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) for Federal Informa-
tion Systems and Organizations. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2011. 
“The ISCM strategy is developed and implemented to support risk management in accordance with 
organizational risk tolerance.”
TIP
The CM strategy [2] should:
• Reflect the organization’s risk tolerance (including helping set priorities and consistent 
management of risk);
• Include metrics that provide meaningful indications of security status at all 
organizational tiers;
• Ensure continued effectiveness of all security controls;
• Address verifying compliance with information security requirements derived from 
organizational missions/business functions, federal legislation, directives, regulations, 
policies, and standards/guidelines;
• Be informed by all organizational IT assets and aids to maintain visibility into the 
security of the assets;
• Ensure knowledge and control of changes to organizational systems and environments 
of operation; and
• Maintain awareness of threats and vulnerabilities.

Introduction to Continuous Monitoring
An organization-wide CM strategy provides a comprehensive view of the CM 
requirements of all organizational tiers. These requirements may be derived from 
­multiple sources including the key metrics and the frequency of security controls mon­
itoring and assessments deemed necessary to provide an indication of the information 
security and risk posture. CM strategies can also be developed at a specific tier26 to 
26From Dempsey, K., Nirali, C., Johnson, A., Johnston, R., Jones, A., Orebaugh, A., et al. NIST Special Pub-
lication (SP) 800-137, Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) for Federal Information Systems 
and Organizations. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2011. “A continuous monitor-
ing strategy for an individual system may also include metrics related to its potential impact on other systems.”
NOTE
In July 2010, OMB released a policy27 which clarified the roles and responsibilities for 
cybersecurity. In this policy, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)28 was identified 
as having the responsibility for implementing the operational aspects of the cybersecurity 
of civilian federal information systems as defined in FISMA under section 3543.29 The 
scope of responsibility as it relates to CM included the government-wide and agency-
specific monitoring and assessment of areas such cybersecurity operations and incident 
response [5]. In addition, DHS’s role was further clarified in a Federal Information Security 
Memorandum30 published in August 2011 in which federal agencies were required to 
report31 to DHS on metrics through automated32 or manual data feeds. For example, in 
February 2012, DHS33 identified Administrative Priorities (AP)34 that would be scored 
along with Key FISMA Metrics (KFM).35 Within the AP, CM was identified as a “key 
element to managing an information security program is having accurate information about 
security postures, activities and threats” [6].

CHAPTER 11  Strategies for Continuous Monitoring
address local requirements. However, to enable an organization-wide approach to CM, 
tier-specific strategies will need to be driven from a consistent application of the 
­methodologies and practices used at the higher organizational tiers (i.e., tier 3 strate­
gies should encompass tier 2 policies, procedures, and processes). This ensures that 
any condition that would require the tier-specific strategy to be updated also triggers 
additional updates to strategies in the higher tiers so that security-related information 
captured at the lower tiers maintains relevance in supporting organization-wide risk-
based decisions across the organization.
CM Program
Although more tactically focused, the organization’s CM program facilitates the 
implementation of the CM strategy. The scope of the program should be designed to 
address the sufficiency in security-related information to support risk-based deci­
sions. This can be accomplished by defining metrics and frequencies36 of monitoring 
and assessment that produce the needed information. The development of a Continu­
ous Monitoring Plan37 facilitates the implementation of the CM program. The Con­
tinuous Monitoring Plan also addresses the integration of CM activities and metrics 
to support the CM strategy through the identification of security controls necessary 
for monitoring to ensure their effectiveness38 over time.
As previously mentioned, metrics provide a guide for collecting security-related 
information. The types of metrics defined for the organization reflect the security objec­
tives for the organization, mission/business processes, and/or information system. In 
addition, metrics can be defined at any organizational tier. Therefore, the organization 
will need to ensure that the frequency of monitoring, if not consistent across the orga­
nizational tiers, has a linkage between the security-related information requirements.
THE CONTINUOUS MONITORING PROCESS
For CM to be an effective tool and operate as a source of information for supporting 
the management of risk, the organization needs to ensure the requirements and activi­
ties at each level of the organization are addressed in the CM strategy. This enables 
36The frequency of monitoring and assessment should be sufficient to meet the organization’s security 
assurance requirements. NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Appendix E, discusses security assurance.

risk management activities to more closely reflect the type of security-related infor­
mation collected as part of the CM program and used for making risk-based deci­
sions. As an example, Figure 11.2 provides a high-level illustration of the alignment 
that exists between the CM strategy and the organizational tiers. In addition, it also 
depicts the inputs that can be potential sources for deriving requirements that need 
to be addressed by the strategy for implementing an organization-wide CM program.
The CM process includes both strategic and programmatic activities. The strategic 
activities usually occur at the higher level within the organization where the overall 
organizational risk tolerance is defined. However, CM strategies can exist at individ­
ual tiers to address requirements specific to a mission or business process supported 
by the information system or information systems where stakeholders exist across 
more than one business unit or federal agency. To ensure security-related informa­
tion collected or resources required to support tier-specific requirements are reusable, 
organizations should make sure there is some consistency with higher-level tiers.
Defining a CM Strategy
The CM strategy reflects the organizational driver for CM within the organiza­
tion. The execution of the CM program is facilitated through requirements and 
activities included in the strategy. The requirements and activities are defined in 
policies, procedures, and templates that support the CM strategy such as metrics, 
FIGURE 11.2  Integration of CM Process with Organization-Wide Risk Management

358
CHAPTER 11  Strategies for Continuous Monitoring
review/updates, assessment and status monitoring and reporting, risk assessments, 
and configuration management. These policies, procedures, and templates are sup­
ported through processes that addresses the requirements at the most appropriate 
level within the organization to ensure risks can be managed at the organizational 
risk tolerance.
Strategies developed at the information system tier align more closely with the 
NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).39 CM within the NIST RMF will be 
discussed in more detailed later in this chapter. For the purpose of this section, it is 
important to understand that security-related information produced through tier 3 
strategies and programs supports the organizational CM strategy and program at 
tiers 1 and 2. Management responsible and accountable for risk-based decisions at 
tier 1 or 2 are informed with regards to organizational risk based on information 
produced at the lower tiers so that appropriate mitigation strategies can be developed 
and implemented. In addition, the tier 3 CM strategy also supports ongoing 
­authorizations [2].
Implementing a CM Program
The CM strategy is implemented through the CM program.40 The scope of the program 
should address the requirements41 defined in the strategy for the security-related informa­
tion needed by the organization for making risk-based decisions. These requirements can 
be across all tiers, or specific to a tier, but should include at a minimum [8]:
• 
Monitoring metrics.
• 
Frequency of monitoring and assessments.
• 
Security status reporting.

Agency Privacy Management. Washington: Executive Office of the President, Office of Management 
and Budget; 2010. “Agencies should develop an enterprise-wide strategy for selecting subsets of their 
security controls to be monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure all controls are assessed during the

cedures included in an agency’s security authorization package (e.g. as described in system security 
plans, security assessment reports, and [Plans of Actions and Milestones] (POA&Ms)) are updated 
as appropriate and contain the necessary information for authorizing officials to make credible risk-
based decisions regarding the security state of the information system on an ongoing basis.”

359
The Continuous Monitoring Process
The metrics defined by the organization can come from any tier across the 
­organization and encompass different sources of security-related information. In 
addition, the information can be collected either through manual procedures and 
techniques42 or automated tools and technologies.43 The frequency can also vary 
based on the source of the requirements used as an input to the CM strategy. As an 
example, in February 2012, US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published 
the FISMA metrics44 that were required by federal agencies to incorporate into their 
CM program for collection and reporting. Table 11.1 presents the current metrics 
related to CM.
Metrics used for measuring the organization’s security posture may also be deter­
mined to be different depending on the organizational tier (see Figure 11.1) where 
they are defined. For example, tier 1 metrics may be defined by the department/
agency CIO and/or Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) based on a CM strat­
egy that focuses on providing an organizational-wide view of the security posture at 
tiers 2 and 3, and to support security governance decisions. Whereas tier 3 metrics 
may be defined by the System Owner and/or Information System Security Officers 
(ISSOs) based on information collected for determining the security posture associ­
ated with the security control effectiveness in a specific information system and to 
support ongoing authorization decisions.
Defining the frequency of monitoring and assessment activities is essential 
for the implementation of an effective CM program. Establishing the frequency 
requires understanding the organization objectives for monitoring and assessments. 
42For manual CM processes to be effective, they must be repeatable.
43Automation can ensure process consistency and efficiency.
44Metrics to support FISMA reporting may be an aggregate of information that is from various levels 
and sources from across the organization (i.e., governance, operations, and information system).
NOTE
In August 2011, DHS released FISM 11-02, FY 2011 Reporting Instructions for the 
Federal Information Security Management Act and Agency Privacy Management. DHS 
was given the authority to provide direction on government-wide metrics and submit 
information according to the defined reporting activities and frequency. The activities [4] 
included:
• Data feeds;
• Security question responses;
• Cyberstat accountability sessions/agency interviews.
This government-wide CM strategy was developed through collaboration with the Federal 
Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council Information Security and Identity Management 
Committee (ISIMC) Continuous Monitoring Working Group (CMWG). The CMWG focused on 
the establishment of a government-wide continuous monitoring and risk-scoring capability 
and the technology, people, and processes used to implement the capability to enhance 
the overall security posture of the federal government [7].

CHAPTER 11  Strategies for Continuous Monitoring
For ­example, the following criteria [2] can assist an organization in determining the 
frequency:
• 
Security control volatility.
• 
System categorization/impact level.
• 
Security controls or specific assessment objectives providing critical functions.
• 
Security control with identified weaknesses.
• 
Organizational risk tolerance.
• 
Threat/vulnerability information.
• 
Risk assessment results.
• 
Output of monitoring strategy reviews.
•

CHAPTER 11  Strategies for Continuous Monitoring
The collection and reporting of security-related information is supported by the 
CM architecture. Security automation50 facilitates CM through an increase in the 
coverage and efficiency of information collection. To make the information useful 
and reusable, consideration should be given to ensure the data supporting the CM 
strategy and program is interoperable51 across the organization. Since accountability 
for the security posture may exist with different roles/functions within or between 
different organizations, the data needs to be portable when supporting different

The US Department of State established the iPost Risk Scoring Program to provide summary 
and detailed information on the current status of hosts45 at a particular site.46 In 2010, 
DHS released the Continuous Asset Evaluation, Situational Awareness, and Risk Scoring 
(CAESARS) Reference Architecture Report.47 CAESARS was based in part on iPost.48 DHS 
indicated that analyzing security-related information, defining and calculating risk, and 
assigning scores is a key part of the continuous monitoring process [10]. However, it is 
important to note that some management and operational controls cannot be effectively 
scored and some aspect of risk management cannot be automated. The Federal CIO 
Information Security and Identity Management Committee (ISIMC) established an initiative 
that would extend the DHS CAESARS. The goal of the CAESARS Framework Extension (FE)49 
was to present a technical reference model to allow organizations to aggregate collected data 
from across a diverse set of security tools, analyze that data, perform scoring, enable user 
questions, and provide overall situational awareness [11].

The Continuous Monitoring Process
­metrics or different monitoring and assessment frequencies [2]. Although briefly 
mentioned in this section, the next chapter discusses security automation in more 
detail as it relates to supporting CM requirements.
The implementation of the CM program involves operationalizing the organiza­
tional policies and procedures defined at tiers 2 and 3. The policies and procedures 
include identifying the types of reports,52 the recipients of the reports, the frequency 
of reporting, and any tools and methodologies. In addition, processes and capabili­
ties53 at tiers 2 and 3 should be designed to enable the effective collection, analysis, 
reporting, and response. The collection of security-related information can be man­
ual or automated, with emphasis placed on the assembly of the information to ensure 
it is in a format that makes it meaningful to stakeholders and provides the necessary 
visibility for making risk-based decisions.
The analysis and reporting of security-related information is conducted at tiers 
1 and 2 as an aggregate view of the security status of operational and system-level 
security controls from across the organization. Tier 3 analysis and reporting primar­
ily supports ongoing authorizations and system-level mitigations. The processes and 
capabilities support the analysis and reporting by enabling organizations to consis­
tently and efficiently measure security, determine the effectiveness of security con­
trols, and prioritize remediation actions.
A response to findings from CM analysis may require coordination with other 
stakeholders across the organization. Responses can occur at each organization tier 
(e.g., tier 1 responses focus on those aspects which mitigate risk54 through gover­
nance and policies and tier 3 responses mitigate risk associated with system-level 
security policies, procedures, processes, and security controls). Responses could also 
include changes to the CM strategy and program discussed in the next section.
Review and Update CM Strategy and Program
As previously discussed, the CM strategy and program evolves and must continue 
to be applicable to the organization’s mission/objectives and operation/threat envi­
ronment. CM is a recursive process in which the monitoring strategy is continually 
refined [2]. As changes occur to the strategy, the program may need to be reviewed 
and updated to support the organization’s risk tolerance and to ensure the security-
related information continues to be relevant and accurate.
52From Dempsey, K., Nirali, C., Johnson, A., Johnston, R., Jones, A., Orebaugh, A., et al. NIST 
Special Publication (SP) 800-137, Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) for Federal 
Information Systems and Organizations. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 
2011. Examples include reoccurring reports, automated reports, ad hoc reports, data feeds and data-
base views.
53Continuous monitoring capabilities are enabled through technologies and techniques that provide the 
organization with the most accurate picture of the security and risk posture, visibility into and near or 
real-time data through manual or automated data feeds.
54Risk responses are discussed in detail in Chapter 6, Risk Management.

364
CHAPTER 11  Strategies for Continuous Monitoring
The tier 1 and 2 policies and procedures should address the process for reviewing 
and updating the strategy. The process should consider potential aspects [2] of the 
strategy that ensure sufficiency of the information to support the organization risk 
management decisions55 such as:
• 
Measurements,
• 
Metrics,
• 
Monitoring frequencies, and
• 
Reporting requirements.
CONTINUOUS MONITORING WITHIN FEDRAMP
The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) Program 
Management Office (PMO) established a Concept of Operations (CONOPS)56 that 
included the framework for CM within FedRAMP.57 In addition, the FedRAMP PMO 
published a CM Strategy58 for use once the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) receives a 
Provisional Authorization.59 Although the specific aspects of CM implemented within 
FedRAMP are primarily limited to tier 3 CM activities, it is important to discuss how 
the organization-wide CM discussed earlier in this chapter supports the implementa­
tion of the FedRAMP CM process. Within the context of FedRAMP, the goal of CM 
is to enable visibility into the security posture of cloud services to support continuous 
risk management decisions. This visibility is achieved through reporting from the CSP 
in three areas: operational visibility, change control, and incident response.
55Risk management decisions include: risk response, ongoing authorization, and resource/prioritization.

visional Authorization from year to year, CSPs must monitor their security controls, assess them on a regu-
lar basis, and demonstrate that the security posture of their service offering is continuously acceptable.”
NOTE
Changes to the CM strategy could occur due to the following factors [2]:
• Mission/business processes,
• Enterprise architecture,
• Organizational risk tolerance,
• Threat/vulnerability information,
• Plan of action and milestones (POA&Ms),
• Security trends,
• Federal laws or regulations,
• Reporting requirements.

365
Continuous Monitoring within FedRAMP
The FedRAMP PMO, CSP, and federal agency each have organizational CM roles 
and responsibilities when executing CM activities within the context of FedRAMP. 
Table 11.2 outlines those FedRAMP CM roles and responsibilities.
Each operates as an essential stakeholder that supports the effective integration 
of organization-wide CM into the FedRAMP process. As illustrated in Figure 11.3, 
each stakeholder plays a role in the management of risk by ensuring CM is applied 
consistently across the organizational tiers through common CM policies, proce­
dures, processes, and templates.
In addition, FedRAMP establishes a methodology that enables the federal 
­government to leverage security-related ­information that can be applied over more 
than one cloud service, effectively improving government-wide security. However, it 
is important to note that the CSP’s role in CM is not a substitute for the federal gov­
ernment’s responsibility and accountability for the use of cloud services.
FedRAMP includes two primary components to CM: security documents and 
real-time operational feeds. These components enable ongoing authorization through 
the recurring updates of key security documents (i.e., system security plan, security 
assessment report, and POA&Ms) and operational visibility. The real-time opera­
tional feeds support CM by reducing the administrative barriers needed to demon­
strate compliance by shifting to real-time oversight monitoring [12].
Through the three-tiered approach, the FedRAMP PMO, CSP, and federal 
agency can ensure the CM strategy and program can be used to maintain the cloud 
service’s authorization to operate. The tasks outlined in Figure 11.4 support the 
three CM areas within the FedRAMP CM process by ensuring system information 
is kept up-to-date while also facilitating risk-based decisions on an ongoing basis 
through the assessment and monitoring of security controls (common, hybrid, or 
system-level) using security management and reporting tools.60 This transforms the

security controls assessment and risk determination process into a dynamic pro­
cess61 that is supported by timely risk response actions and a cost-effective, ongoing 
­authorization [2].
The FedRAMP security authorization process62 focuses on integrating information 
security and risk management into the SDLC through the application of the NIST RMF. 
After the initial authorization, evidence of security control effectiveness will need to be 
obtained continuously to support the changes63 within the cloud service and operating 
environment. The monitoring steps (Step 6) of the NIST RMF,64 when aligned with the 
organization’s CM and risk management activities, support the determination of risk at 
the organizational and mission/business tiers through system-level information.65
The operational visibility provides the transparency required by the FedRAMP 
PMO and federal agencies through the use of three sources of information: data feeds 
(automated/manual), annual security control assessment, and annual self-attesta­
tion.66 As we already discussed earlier in this chapter, federal agencies are required 
to submit monthly reporting on government-wide metrics to DHS. Data feeds pro­
duced by the CSP should be integrated into existing capabilities within the CSP’s 
existing monitoring environment to align with the federal agency’s reporting require­
ments. In addition to the CSP’s continuous monitoring activities, Table 11.3 identi­
fies an example list of artifacts that must be submitted to the FedRAMP PMO .
The change control process is enabled by monitoring and reporting activities. CM 
provides insight into the implementation of organizational- and information system–level 
policies, procedures, and secure configuration baselines. Monitoring67 also identifies

Incident response is a critical component of the FedRAMP CM process. A secu­
rity incident69 should be anticipated and response planned. The Incident Response 
Plan (IRP) documents the CSP’s implementation of the incident response life cycle70 
that includes activities for the detection and analysis of and response to a security 
incident. In the event of a security incident, the CSP has the responsibility to notify71 
the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) and the affected 
federal agency. The FedRAMP PMO and US-CERT will then coordinate response 
efforts across the impacted federal agencies, including conducting a forensic analy­
sis through a root cause determination and providing recommended remediation 
actions [12].
SUMMARY
In this chapter, CM was discussed from the perspective of the organization support­
ing the monitoring and assessment activities. CM includes both strategic and tactical 
components that enable it to be implemented cost-effectively. Beginning with a com­
prehensive and robust CM strategy, the organization can ensure alignment with the 
organization’s overall risk management strategy. The design and implementation of 
the CM program is supported through the definition of metrics, frequencies, and for­
mats for assembling and distributing security-related information. Within the context 
of FedRAMP, CM can be a complex activity that requires the appropriate coordina­
tion between multiple stakeholders. The interaction between the CSP, FedRAMP 
PMO, and federal agency relies upon the consistent implementation of policies, pro­
cedures, processes, and templates that support activities that enable operational vis­
ibility, change control, and incident response.

INFORMATION IN THIS CHAPTER:
•	 Introduction
•	 CM Reference Architectures
•	 Security Automation Standards and Specifications
•	 Operational Visibility and Continuous Monitoring
INTRODUCTION
Security automation is an essential part of an information security program, enabling 
organizations to achieve more efficiency in monitoring activities. Not all continuous 
monitoring (CM) can be accomplished through automation. However, where auto­
mation is applied, an organization can more cost-effectively monitor and continu­
ally assess security controls. The result of using security automation enhances the 
security-related information produced from monitoring activities, offering a more 
accurate measure of the state of the organization’s security posture. Security auto­
mation is supported by the metrics established by the organization for the collection 
and analysis of the needed security-related information. This information becomes a 
valuable input into the organization’s risk management function, thereby enabling the 
organization’s management to realize “near real-time,” risk-based decision-making.
Tools and technologies used in CM provide the organization with insight into 
the security controls that can be automated. However, in some circumstances man­
ual monitoring may still be required in the organization’s security program. This is 
important to note, because manual monitoring can still serve as a viable option, spe­
cifically in cases where the organization’s CM strategy is still maturing and metrics 
required for the collection of information are largely undefined.
The CM strategy should address the people, processes, technologies and the envi­
ronment. In addition, the CM strategy does not focus solely on the security-related 
information that is easy for an organization to collect or easy to automate [1]. 
­Therefore, where automation is used, the organization will also need to ensure the 
strategy reflects its role to ensure it achieves the desired efficiency in obtaining

outcome-oriented results. For example, where large volumes of security-related 
information are collected, automation augments existing processes by reducing the 
burden and potential errors associated with the human aspects1 of conducting analy­
sis. Automation also supports the organization by interpreting2 the collected data to 
enable stakeholders to make more informed, risk-based decisions.
Automation is not a replacement for the human element in an information secu­
rity program. The application of automation within an organization’s CM strategy 
should be linked to the existing processes (or new processes3 where gaps exist) to 
ensure the organization understands the associated impact in the potential loss of vis­
ibility and efficiency due to a compromise in the tools and technologies relied upon 
when making risk-based decisions. This will also guide the organization in ensuring 
any automation that is used to supplement monitoring capabilities4 within the infor­
mation security program is appropriately protected.
As illustrated in Figure 12.1, CM plays a critical role in the organization’s risk 
management strategy. The use of automated tools facilitates the collection of “a 
larger and more diverse pool of technologies, people, processes, and environments” 
[1]. However, the selection of the tools and technologies should be considered only 
after the organization has thoroughly defined the metrics that the organization will 
use as a basis for analyzing and responding5 to findings through the organization’s 
risk management processes. Through the development of metrics, the organization

“Automation serves to augment the security processes conducted by security professionals within an 
organization and may reduce the amount of time a security professional must spend on doing redun-
dant tasks, thereby increasing the amount of time the trained professional may spend on tasks requiring 
human cognition.”

can identify the tools and technologies that present the necessary information at a 
frequency consistent with those defined in the strategy.
This chapter will focus on CM reference architectures developed to support the 
identification of tools and technologies that enable organizations to automate differ­
ent aspects of CM (i.e., gathering, aggregating, analyzing, and reporting). Addition­
ally, existing and emerging security automation standards and specifications will be 
briefly discussed as a means of addressing the importance of standardization in the 
reporting and the exchange of data when organizations implement security automa­
tion in CM-related activities.
CM REFERENCE ARCHITECTURES
A CM reference architecture is an abstract depiction of the components and interfaces 
that must exist within a CM implementation. It operates as a template which can be 
customized through a specific set of CM solutions. In addition, using a CM reference 
architecture, such as those that will be discussed in this section, assists organizations

Tools and technologies enhance CM activities. Several considerations [1] when selecting 
tools and technologies to support automation capabilities include:
• Collection sources.6
• Open specification support (e.g., SCAP7).
• Interoperability.
• Reporting.
• Data aggregation.

Continuous Asset Evaluation, Situational Awareness, and Risk 
Scoring Reference Architecture
As mentioned in Chapter 11, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal 
Network Security (FNS) Branch, developed a reference architecture that provided an 
abstraction of a security posture monitoring and risk scoring system, that is informed 
by computing and network asset that can be used by other federal agencies seeking to 
apply risk scoring principles to their information security program [2]. The DHS FNS 
Continuous Asset Evaluation, Situational Awareness, and Risk Scoring Reference 
Architecture Report (CAESARS)8 provided the initial framework for implementing 
monitoring process and for establishing requirements for automated tool selection and 
integration. For completeness and for illustration purposes, Figure 12.2 provides a view 
of the CAESAR subsystems. In the next section, the follow-on reference architecture 
CAESARS Framework Extension (FE) developed by NIST, an enterprise continuously 
monitoring technical reference model, will be discussed with additional detail as it 
relates to supporting automation in a CM program.
CAESARS Framework Extension Reference Architecture
The CAESARS FE is an enhanced version of the CM reference architecture 
developed by DHS. The specific differences will not be discussed in this chapter, 
but it is important to note that the essential characteristics have remained the 
same, with differences focused on adding additional functionality, granularity 
within subsystem specifications, and to further leverage existing and emerging 
security automation standards [3]. The CAESARS FE is a conceptual model used 
to enable the real-time capabilities of the NIST Risk Management Framework 
(RMF)9 with specific emphasis placed on automating continuous monitoring 
Step 6 functions. Through an elaboration of a technical architecture using the 
model presented in the CAESARS FE, tools and technologies can be developed 
that facilitate CM within an enterprise and make information available to support 
risk-based decision-making.
In this section, the subsystems and components, and specifications will be briefly 
discussed, followed by a description of how the application of the CAESAR FE tech­
nical reference model supports each of the data domains.10 Although a specific

discussion of security automation domains11 is beyond the scope of this book, it is 
important to list those domains identified [1] that require support by the CM refer­
ence technical model12 as shown in Table 12.1.
Subsystems and Components
The CAESARS FE reference architecture consists of six subsystems. Each subsystem, 
as depicted in Figure 12.3, contains one or more components that provide a specific 
function or capability (e.g., analysis and scoring, collection, content management, etc.).

security automation domain is an information security area that includes a grouping of tools, technolo-
gies, and data. Data within the domains is captured, correlated, analyzed, and reported to present the 
security status of the organization that is represented by the domains monitored.”

The tools support these domains need to be instrumented to interface with CM solutions (i.e. external 
systems instrumented for CM integration).

CM Reference Architectures
The subsystems and components are meant to be independent and security tool and 
technology agnostic. Therefore, it is important to understand the intent of the subsys­
tems and components to enable organizations to apply the technical reference model in 
a way that will assist in identifying and implementing CM capabilities that result in a 
solution that cost-effectively supports the CM requirements. Below is an overview of 
each of the subsystems and components:
• 
The presentation/reporting subsystem, consisting of the dashboard engine, is 
the source for user input/outputs. Within the CM system instance, this subsys­
tem would primarily interface with the task manager subsystem using queries 
designed to fulfill user requests for security-related information.
• 
The task manager subsystem performs the orchestration in the CM system 
instance between the analysis/scoring, data aggregation, presentation/reporting, 
and collection subsystems. This subsystem performs the orchestration through 
use of several components, such as the query orchestration, collection control­
ler, and decision engine.
• 
The collection subsystem collects data based on a user query (task manager), 
using content that describes the organization’s policies (content), and stores the 
results (data aggregation). When a multi-tiered13 CM capability is used, as 
illustrated in Figure 12.4, a collection subsystem may not exist within all of the 
CM instances.14 It is also important to highlight that a collection subsystem is 
13From Mell, P., Waltermire, D., Feldman, L., Booth, H., Regland, Z., Ouyang, A., et al. NIST Inter-
agency Report (IR) 7756 (Second Draft), CAESARS Framework Extension: An Enterprise Continuous 
Monitoring Technical Reference Model. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 
2012. In a multi-tiered CM situation, a CM instance higher in the hierarchy may not have any assets to 
monitor, but instead rely upon data feeds from lower tier CM instances.
14More than one CM instance can be used in organizations that have a need to structure the CM imple-
mentation organization-wide to support the different tiers of decision-makers within the CM program 
(e.g., tier 1—governance, tier 2—mission/business processes, and tier 3—information system).

CHAPTER 12  Cost-Effective Compliance Using Security Automation 
not a core component of the CM implementation and could be an external 
system that interfaces with a CM instance.
• 
The data aggregation subsystem is the central repository for data (e.g., raw, 
analyzed, etc.). This subsystem consists of multiple repositories: system state, 
asset, metrics, and metadata. The data aggregation subsystem interfaces with 
other subsystems such as input from the collection subsystem for storage of 
raw collected data, raw data retrieval and analyzed data storage from the 
analysis/scoring subsystem, and query result storage from task managers that 
exist in lower-tiers in a multi-tiered hierarchical model [3] (see Figure 12.3).
• 
The analysis/scoring subsystem provides the analysis and scoring function within 
the CM implementation, potentially supporting multiple scoring methodologies 
analysis engine components. This subsystem is a critical component of the CM 
implementation. It receives queries from the task manager subsystem, retrieves 
and stores data in the data aggregation subsystem, and obtains scoring algo­
rithms, parameters, and associated scoring data from the content subsystem [3].
• 
Finally, the content subsystem maintains the organizational policies which are 
used to compare system state. The primary purpose of this subsystem is to 
maintain the policies (e.g., security baselines configurations) and supporting 
data (e.g., enumeration of products being evaluated, or vulnerabilities being 
identified) that are used by the collection subsystem(s) or the analysis/risk 
scoring subsystem(s). Since an organization may have a single source for storing 
organizational policies, only one content subsystem would be required for an 
entire CM implementation to enable sharing among the different CM instances.
Specifications: Workflows, Subsystems, and Interfaces
The CAESARS FE technical specification consists of the workflows, subsystems, 
and interfaces that enable the implementation of the CM reference model. The work­
flows specifications define the “coordinated operations of all the subsystems and 
components within the model” [4]. The subsystem specifications enable subsystems 
FIGURE 12.4  Multi-Tiered, Hierarchical CM Implementation [3]

385
CM Reference Architectures
to operate as independent and tool agnostic, “plug-in-play” modules that are interop­
erable between CM implementations. Since subsystems perform an independent 
role within the CM implementation, clearly defining the required functionality at 
a “generic” level enables easier integration of different products/services. The last 
specification, the interfaces, plays an essential role in bridging the communication 
between the individual subsystems and facilitating workflow interactions.
This section is not intended to provide a detailed description of these specifica­
tions, but instead to provide a general overview to expand the discussion of the CAE­
SARS FE as a technical reference model for identifying tools and technologies that 
can be integrated into CM solutions to assist CSPs in addressing the FedRAMP 
operational visibility and other CM requirements. Through the selection of CSPs that 
implement the specifications, federal agencies can focus on continuously monitoring 
security-related information across the enterprise (i.e., hardware, software, and ser­
vices) under a single governance structure to include those mission/business pro­
cesses that have been extended to the cloud service environment.15
Specification Layers
The CAESARS FE consists of multiple layers that extend from a high-level refer­
ence model description to a technical specification that links the CM implementation 
to a specific data domain (e.g., asset management, configuration management, and 
vulnerability management). As illustrated in Figure 12.5, the layers of the CM speci­
fications extend from layer 5 where the subsystem and interconnections16 are defined, 
to layer 4 which addresses specifications for describing the workflows, subsystems, 
and interfaces,17 to the actual binding of the technical reference model to data 
domains in layer 2.18 Layers 3 and 1 are beyond the scope of this book.
Workflows
As described earlier, workflows provide coordinated operations for moving data 
within the CM technical reference model. Workflows describe specific use cases that 
are driven by the necessity for different subsystems and components to interoperate 
15DHS/FNS is in the process of establishing technical requirements for the Continuous Diagnostic 
and Mitigation (CDM) Program which will provide federal agencies and state and local governments 
with the ability to enhance and automate their existing continuous network monitoring capabilities, 
correlate and analyze critical security-related information, and strengthen risk-based decision making 
at the agency and federal enterprise level. Available from: https://www.fbo.gov/utils/view?id=ae650d

to perform a specific function (e.g., acquiring data through collection and reporting, 
fulfilling queries requests). For example a workflow for the data acquisition involves 
the collection subsystem interacting with other subsystems to support the acquisi­
tion of data. Figure 12.6 provides an illustration for how this workflow would be 
FIGURE 12.5  CAESAR FE Specification Layers [4]
FIGURE 12.6  Example Data Acquisition Workflow

CM Reference Architectures
executed in a CM implementation. Omitted from the diagram is specific component 
interaction within the workflow. Since components within a subsystem collectively 
support the subsystem’s implementation of a specific requirement within a workflow 
(e.g., collection controller initiating a task to the collection subsystem to collect data 
would be sent by the task manager), the actions of components have been abstracted 
to the subsystem-level.
Subsystems
The subsystem specifications provide a detailed description of the requirements that 
must be supported by a specific subsystem to effectively implement the CM technical 
reference model. Since the specifications are data domain agnostic, they are not spe­
cifically linked with a specific monitoring domain (i.e., asset management, configu­
ration management, vulnerability management). Instead, the specifications describe 
the capabilities that must be supported by individual components. For example, the 
collection controller within the task manager subsystem provides the capability to 
process tasks (task processing19) and initiate data collection tasks (subtask propaga­
tion20) [4]. For the task manager to support the ability to initiate a task to request the 
collection of data from a user query, the task manager needs to be able to support 
multiple capabilities offered through these discrete services that interact within the 
CM implementation to support workflows.
Interfaces
Interface specifications provide the standardized mechanism in which subsystems 
can effectively communicate with each other and enable them to operate as indepen­
dent modules that, when collectively implemented, support the entire CM technical 
reference model. Interfaces are exposed through Web Services Definition Language 
(WSDL)21 that describes the web services implemented within the subsystem(s) 
where the interface exists. For example, Figure 12.7 provides an oversimplified illus­
tration of the “Results Reporting” interface that is implemented by the Data Aggrega­
tion subsystem which enables other subsystems and components to send asset 
information for storage [4]. The WSDL describes the services(s) that are supported

SECURITY AUTOMATION STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS
The implementation of CM requires using tools and technologies that are based on 
standards and specifications that are open and industry-supported. Standards and 
specifications provide a foundation for implementing automation that promotes por­
tability and interoperability across tool sets and domain boundaries. As discussed 
earlier, the layer 2 in the CAESARS FE technical reference model binds the refer­
ence model to data domains (e.g., asset management,24 configuration management,25

review of all security automation standards and specifications, but instead will pro­
vide a high-level overview that furthers investigation.
Security Content Automation Protocol
The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)27 provides the bindings for sup­
porting the layer 2 data domains through a series of specifications. SCAP provides a 
“suite of specifications that standardize the format and nomenclature by which soft­
ware flaw and security configuration information is communicated, both to machines 
and humans” [5] includes: languages (XCCDF,28 OVAL®,29 OCIL™30), reporting 
formats (ARF31), enumerations (CPE™,32 CCE™,33 and CVE™34), measurement 
and scoring systems (CVSS,35 CCSS36), and supports the preservation of integrity 
(TMSAF)37 of content and results. Table 12.2 provides a description of the five cate­
gories that cover the component specifications included within SCAP.
Cybersecurity Information Exchange Framework
Cybersecurity Information Exchange (CYBEX)38 was produced by the International 
Telecommunication Union (ITU) Study Group (SG) 17.39 CYBEX provides a model 
and technique for exchanging cybersecurity information (e.g., vulnerability and inci­
dent). It focuses on providing the means to support a trusted bi-directional exchange, 
but does not extend to the acquisition or use of the cybersecurity information which

is contained within the organization’s boundary. Although CYBEX is an interna­
tional specification, it is briefly mentioned here as it relates to supporting the CAE­
SARS FE where CM implementations within different organizational security 
boundaries are required to support the exchange of security-related information.
OPERATIONAL VISIBILITY AND CONTINUOUS MONITORING
The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)’s ongoing 
assessment and authorization process includes a requirement for operational visibil­
ity and continuous monitoring requirements. In Figure 12.8, the CAESARS FE (dis­
cussed earlier in this chapter) is shown alongside the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) 
Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC) Stack.
The purpose of this diagram is to illustrate how the GRC Stack can support many 
of the aspects of the operational visibility and continuous monitoring requirements. 
In this section, the focus will be on providing an introduction to the components 
of the GRC Stack and a description of how they collectively can be used by Cloud 
Service Providers (CSPs), Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs), and the 
federal government to achieve cost-effective compliance, and obtain security-related 
information to support CM activities.
Operational visibility focuses on demonstrating compliance on an ongoing 
basis through automated and manual processes. CSPs are required to provide data 
feeds (automated/manual), periodically assess security controls to determine 
continued effectiveness, and a report (annually) through a self-attestation certifi­
cation. The data feeds should be in a compatible format that can be consumed by

the CyberScope.40 CyberScope is an application that enables the federal govern­
ment to support an “on-demand” view of the government-wide security posture. 
To enable the ability to achieve near-real-time risk management, the CyberScope 
application must handle manual and automated inputs from federal agencies 
based on data feeds produced using SCAP for FISMA reporting [6]. The annual 
assessment requires a 3PAO to conduct an assessment and the CSP’s cloud ser­
vice environment to certify the accuracy of the results before being submitted to 
the FedRAMP PMO and the leveraging federal agency to assist in integrating the 
cloud service into the enterprise-wide risk management process when making 
risk-based decisions.
The GRC Stack, depicted in Figure 12.8, comprises four components: Cloud 
Control Matrix (CCM), Consensus Assessment Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ), 
CloudAudit, and Cloud Trust Protocol (CTP). The CCM “is specifically designed to 
provide fundamental security principles to guide cloud vendors and to assist prospec­
tive cloud customers in assessing the overall security risk of a cloud provider” [7]. 
The CCM provides a mapping between multiple compliance frameworks to include 
the FedRAMP security controls.41 The CAIQ “provides a set of questions a cloud 
consumer and cloud auditor may wish to ask of a cloud provider” [8]. The questions 
are aligned with the control requirements defined in the CCM. The next component 
is CloudAudit, which provides a common interface and namespace that enables 
streamlining the audit processes [9]. The last component, the CTP, is a mechanism by 
which consumers request for and receive information about the elements of transpar­
ency (EoT)42 as applied to CSPs [10].
The data feeds focus on obtaining information to enable federal agencies to report 
on the level of performance of FISMA metrics43 for asset management, configura­
tion management, and vulnerability management. The CTP Elements of Transpar­
ency (EoTs) 3–4 (configuration information) and 5–7 (vulnerability information) 
focus on collecting and returning information, in a SCAP-consistent format, about 
the assets being used by the federal agency within the cloud service environment. 
Table 12.3 provides a description of EoTs 3–7:
The periodic assessment of security controls may be performed by a CSP to 
support other obligations of compliance or to support contractual requirements (or 
service-level agreements). The CCM, CAIQ, and CloudAudit collectively enable 
CSPs to perform internal assessment and third-party assessors (i.e., 3PAOs) to

Operational Visibility and Continuous Monitoring
obtain evidence of security control implementation and continued effectiveness. As 
illustrated in Figure 12.8, the CCM includes mappings to multiple frameworks that 
address those requirements defined by FedRAMP. The CAIQ can be converted into 
an OCIL-compliant automated checklist (questionnaire) that can be used to col­
lect information through the assessment of security controls related to people and 
processes. This is specifically useful when assessing security controls that cannot 
be completely or fully monitored through security automation tools and technolo­
gies. CloudAudit provides a specification for a common namespace which aligns 
with the CCM to reduce the complexity of 3PAOs in collecting and storing evi­
dentiary artifacts that support a CSPs’ expression of its ability to meet compliance 
obligations.
SUMMARY
The use of security automation within information security programs focuses on 
achieving efficiency in the monitoring of security controls implemented within infor­
mation systems. Automating CM activities requires understanding the processes 
that will be used by the organization, including the tools and technologies to pro­
vide a more frequent collection and analysis of security-related information. There­
fore, the organization will need to ensure the CM strategy includes both a defined 
set of metrics and processes that will be used to monitor and respond to findings. 
Within FedRAMP the CSP’s continuous monitoring capability supports the ongoing 
authorization and reauthorization decisions. Through the implementation of secu­
rity automation, the CSP can more cost-effectively provide assurance of the security 
controls implemented and the confidence in their effectiveness. The CSA GRC Stack 
addresses many of the aspects of the operational visibility and continuous moni­
toring requirements of FedRAMP and supports federal agencies in reclaiming the 
transparency into the security posture of cloud services, enabling them to make more 
informed, risk-based decisions.

INFORMATION IN THIS CHAPTER:
•	 Case Study Scenario: “Healthcare Exchange”
•	 Applying the Risk Management Framework within FedRAMP
CASE STUDY SCENARIO: “HEALTHCARE EXCHANGE”
The Patient Privacy and Protection Act,1 recently signed into law, creates a new require­
ment for patient healthcare exchanges to be built, herein referred to as “Healthcare 
Exchange.” The “Federal Agency” responsible for implementing the requirements of the 
law has chosen to use an operating expense model instead of a capital expense model, 
and usage-based pricing for processing, storage, bandwidth, and license management, 
and to support elasticity as demand for computing resources may change over time.
Since the “Federal Agency” will require collaboration with external partners to 
support the development of State “Healthcare Exchanges,” the “Federal Agency” has 
chosen to acquire Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
environments from one provider to support the delivery of a computing platform 
and an application platform (similar to the cloud configuration use case included in 
Figure 13.1) where the States could build, test, deploy, and run portable, interoper­
able, and secure State “Healthcare Exchanges.” This enables the “Federal Agency” to 
quickly meet its requirements under the new law. In addition, the IaaS/PaaS environ­
ments will be used by other federal agencies to support the development of a Federal 
“Healthcare Exchange” and other functions required to share information between 
State and federal government entities.
The cloud computing environment will also be used to support a “Federal 
Agency” mission and will contain federal information and information systems. 
Therefore, the infrastructure and platform environment of the cloud computing stack 
will be required to address federal cloud computing security standards. To reduce the 
complexity, the scenario will be limited to a discussion of only the Federal “Health­
care Exchange.” The cloud computing infrastructure (IaaS/PaaS) will be required 
to address not only federal information security requirements under FedRAMP, but

also to meet all data management safeguard requirements required for the protection 
of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Personal Health Information (PHI), and 
Federal Tax Information (FTI) data.
In this chapter, we will discuss the application of the FedRAMP deliverable 
documents to the FedRAMP Security Assessment Process Area included within 
Figure 13.2 under the Cloud Service Provider column. The case study in this section 
will be used to support the discussion.
APPLYING THE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK WITHIN 
FEDRAMP
This section will focus on the application of Steps 1–5 of the NIST Risk Manage­
ment Framework (RMF), which corresponds to Steps 1.1–1.3 of the Federal Risk and 
Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) Security Assessment Process Area. 
The case study provided in the last section will be used as a basis for illustrating how 
to approach using the FedRAMP deliverables to support a FedRAMP Provisional 
Authorization. Figure 13.3 provides the roadmap for the topics that will be presented.
Categorize Information System
The Cloud Service Provider (CSP) must identify the applicable information types and 
conduct a security categorization2 of the cloud service to determine the impact level. 
As depicted in Figure 13.4, the CSP can use available federal governmental standards, 
guidelines, and regulations, and industry-specific “best practices” to assist in estab­
lishing a characterization of types of information currently stored, processed, or trans­
mitted in the cloud service environment. The Federal Information Processing Standard 
(FIPS) 199 analysis represents the information type and sensitivity levels of the CSP’s 
cloud service offering and is not intended to include sensitivity levels for federal

Applying the Risk Management Framework within FedRAMP
Once the CSP has identified all the potential information types, the CSP will need to 
document this information in the FIPS 199.3
In documenting the FIPS 199, the CSP will need to provide an overview of the cloud 
service (i.e., high-level system description). Cloud services generally operate through the 
concept of a shared responsibility model, where both the CSP and the “Federal Agency” 
consumer will share the responsibility4 for specific aspects of securing the cloud environ­
ment. Therefore the FIPS 199 completed by the CSP will need to address only5 the infor­
mation types and sensitivity levels of the cloud service for which the CSP is responsible. 
For example, Table 13.1 provides the information types that may be applicable to the IaaS 
and PaaS provider.
However, if the CSP operated a Software as a Service (SaaS) cloud service, all appli­
cable information types will need to be examined. This may require the CSP to become 
familiar with the specific business use cases6 and the types of information that the “Fed­
eral Agency” customer would process, store, or transmit in the cloud environment as a 
basis for determining the security categorization of the cloud service. This activity 
would be accomplished by using publicly available information from government-wide 
or agency-specific Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA)7 or Federal Segment Archi­
tecture (FSA) documentation.8 A segment architecture is a “detailed results-oriented 
architecture (baseline and target) and a transition strategy for a portion or segment9 
of the enterprise” [3]. Tables 13.2–13.4 provide a list of potential information

the determination of the security impact level for the cloud environment that may host any or all of

types and the recommended (provisional10) impact levels for the confidentiality, integ­
rity, and availability security objective of Low, Moderate, or High.11
In addition, the CSP will need to ensure the “Federal Agency” customer using the 
cloud service collects, processes, or stores information types that do not exceed the 
high-water mark of low- or moderate-impact level for the confidentiality, integrity, 
and availability security objectives [4].
The role of the “Federal Agency” in the security categorization process is the 
characterization of the information that it plans to store, process, or transmit in 
the cloud service. The application of the security categorization ­process by the 
“Federal Agency” will require an evaluation of multiple sources of informa­
tion,12 to include, but not limited to, the organizational input from key stake­
holders (e.g., other federal agencies and State partners), the architectural 
descriptions of the “Healthcare Exchange,” and EA reference models used to 
establish a business case13 as the basis for determining the security objectives 
for the types of information that will be processed, transmitted, or stored in the 
cloud service.
10From Stine, K., Kissel, R., Barker, W., Fahlsing, J., Gulick J. NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-60 
Revision 1, Volume I: Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security 
Categories. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2008. “Provisional security 
impact levels are the initial or conditional impact determinations made until all considerations are 
fully reviewed, analyzed, and accepted in the subsequent categorization steps by appropriate officials.”
11Note, FedRAMP does not currently address “high-impact” sensitivity levels.
12It is important to understand that not all information might be available, however, since the security 
categorization effects the other steps of the NIST RMF, a regular review may be required to identify 
any changes that would have impact.
13From Office of Management and Budget (OMB). FY13 Guidance on Exhibit 300—Planning, Bud-
geting, Acquisition, and Management of IT Capital Assets. Washington: Executive Office of the Presi-
dent, Office of Management and Budget; 2011. “The business case must demonstrate the relationship 
between the investment and the business, performance, data, services, application and technology 
layers of the agency’s EA.”
TIP
If the CSP determines, through a review of the recommended impact levels, that there 
are differences in the selected impact levels, the CSP will need to provide justification 
(rationale) for any changes. During the review, the following factors [5] can be used 
to assist the CSP in determining if the impact levels should be adjusted based on the 
applicable security objectives:
• Sensitivity of change of information when aggregated.
• Compromise in critical system functionality.
• Elevation based on extenuating circumstances.
• Integrity of public information, loss of system availability, privacy information, etc.

409
Applying the Risk Management Framework within FedRAMP
The “Federal Agency” established a business case14 for the “Healthcare 
Exchange” IT Investment. The “Healthcare Exchange” provides a platform for orga­
nizing health information. The “Federal Agency” identified two mission-essential 
functions ­supported by the IT Investment Exchange Systems and Data Services. 
Through an evaluation of the architectural descriptions (e.g., architecture reference 
models, mission, and business processes, etc.) and organizational inputs (laws, 
directives, policy guidance, etc.), specific mission-based information15 and manage­
ment and support information16 can be identified and categorized using information 
associated with the “Healthcare Exchange” as a point of reference to understand the 
potential impact due to a compromise in the confidentiality (C), integrity (I), and 
availability (A).
The “Federal Agency” established Exchange Reference Architecture,17 as illus­
trated in Figure 13.5, defines the key business information and technical areas and 
14A business case assists stakeholders in making decisions regarding the viability of a proposed project 
effort. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires a business case as part of Part 7, Section 
300. Additionally, business cases are considered standard practice throughout private and public indus-
try in addition to specific laws and regulations that mandate business cases for certain project types.

protection when conducting security categorization. In addition, a list of related laws, 
standards, guidelines, and organizational agreements for consideration was devel­
oped and mapped against the “Healthcare Exchange” participants as organizational 
inputs into the security categorization process.
Based on the case study used in this section, several potential information types 
may be selected by the “Federal Agency” such as:
• 
SC Access to Care Information Type22 = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), 
(availability, Low)}.
• 
SC Health Care Delivery Services Information Type23 = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, 
High), (availability, Low)}.
• 
SC Taxation Management Information Type24 = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, 
Low), (availability, Low)}.

TIP
Depending on which cloud service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and deployment model 
(public, hybrid, private, community) is chosen as part of the implementation, the cloud 
service may become part of or completely (in circumstances where the entire business and 
mission function is outsourced) integrated into federal agencies’ enterprise architecture 
(EA). This dependence by federal agencies can introduce many challenges when applying 
the RMF to cloud services.
The Federal Cloud Computing Strategy highlighted, as part of the “Decision Framework 
for Cloud Migration,” the need for federal agencies to provision cloud services by integrating 
them into their wider application portfolio. This will require federal agencies to evaluate 
architectural compatibility of the cloud services and other critical applications [6]. EA, as a 
tool, provides federal agencies with a structured approach for ensuring the interoperability, 
portability, and security of cloud computing adoption through coordination with the federal 
government EA programs. EA can also assist in determining the requirements for addressing 
governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) (see Figure 13.4).

412
CHAPTER 13  A Case Study for Cloud Service Providers 
Select Security Controls
The security control selection process relies on the definition of the security control 
boundary and a clear delineation of the security controls responsibility across service 
and deployment models. It also requires an understanding of any decomposition of 
cloud services into associated subsystems and the mapping of data flows to ensure 
adequate protective measures are applied cost-effectively to sensitive data through­
out the cloud service lifecycle.
The implementation of the “Healthcare Exchange” includes a complicated set of 
security and privacy requirements. Figure 13.6 illustrates the different requirements 
derived from various laws, requirements, standards, guidelines, and control frame­
works, in addition to any organization-specific requirements established by the infor­
mation-sharing agreement.25 For example, under the Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rule, covered entities 
“must comply with the Rules’ requirements to protect the privacy and security of 
health information and must provide individuals with certain rights with respect to 
their health information” [11]. These requirements could include the additional

administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that exceed the security control 
requirements defined in the FedRAMP baseline security controls.26
Defining the Boundary
The first step in the security control selection process is to define the boundary.27 
This provides the scope of protection for the system components and interfaces for 
interconnections and is critical for understanding and clarifying the shared responsi­
bilities for implementing, monitoring, and assessing security controls allocated28 
across the various cloud service and deployment models. Although only conceptual, 
Figure 13.7 provides a high-level illustration of the factors that might be considered 
when allocating security controls and assigning ownership between the CSP and the 
“Federal Agency.” For example, identifying those controls which are inherited from 
one or more organizations (common controls) or are shared between one or more 
organizations (hybrid controls), requires establishing roles and responsibilities based 
on the different deployment models and service models.
In addition, establishing a definition of both the authorization boundary and the 
level of control of the resources can help clarify the delineation of the specific aspects 
being inherited. For security control allocation to be successful, in most cases it 
requires building trusted relationships based on the sharing of evidence that specific 
security controls are implemented, including any assessment results (or a summary) 
and information collected as part of an ongoing continuous monitoring program. The 
Control Implementation Summary (CIS)29 will be used by the CSP to indicate who 
owns the responsibility (or the shared responsibility) to implement and manage the 
controls, and the implementation status of the controls [12].
In this scenario the CSP provides the implementation status (i.e., in-place, par­
tially implemented, planned, alternative implementation, and not applicable) for 
security control implementations that relates to the infrastructure and the platform, 
26NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-66 Revision 1, Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing 
the HIPAA Security Rule, discusses security considerations and resources for use when implementing 
the requirements of the Security Rule.

3, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information System and Organizations. Maryland:

protection for organizational information systems (i.e. what the organization agrees to protect under its 
direct management control or within the scope of its responsibilities) and include the people, processes, 
and information technologies that are part of the systems supporting the organization’s missions and 
business processes.”

hybrid, or common; and (ii) to assign security controls to specific information system components 
responsible for providing a particular security capability (e.g. router, server, remote sensor).”

and indicates where the security control originates (i.e., service provider corpo­
rate network, service provider cloud service-specific, shared between the cloud 
service and the corporate network, configured by the customer, customer-specific 
hardware/software, and shared management between the service provider and the 
customer).
Tailoring and Supplementing
The security controls selection process uses the security categorization to determine 
the appropriate initial baseline of security controls (i.e., Low or Moderate) that will 
provide adequate protection for the information and information systems that reside 
within the cloud service environment. A cloud service may require the implemen­
tation of alternative or compensating security controls not included in the initial 
baseline, or adding additional security controls or enhancements to address unique 
organizational needs based on a risk assessment or organization-specific security 
requirement. For this purpose, the Control Tailoring Workbook (CTW) provides the 
CSP with a listing of the FedRAMP security controls applicable for the cloud envi­
ronment and assists in identifying the exception scenarios for the service offering so 
that the platform can be pre-qualified before resources are used to develop all of the 
other requisite FedRAMP documentation requirements [12].
FIGURE 13.7  Security Control Allocation

415
Applying the Risk Management Framework within FedRAMP
Implement and Document Security Controls
Documenting security controls within the cloud service requires the CSP to 
describe how the security controls were implemented in the System Security Plan 
(SSP). In the previous section, security controls were allocated based on spe­
cific responsibilities (i.e., inherited by another organization, shared between orga­
nizations, or implemented by an organization). In the SSP, information system 
components will need to be described based on the authorization boundary. The 
SSP details how the implementations address each required security control and 
enhancement in the selected, tailored, and supplemented security control baseline, 
descriptions of roles and responsibilities, and expected behavior of individuals 
with system access [12].
In addition, some security controls may require developing support documenta­
tion. For example, Table 13.6 identifies some of the documents that would be imple­
mented by the CSP for FedRAMP.
Assessing Security Controls
The assessment of security controls is primarily driven by the security control asses­
sor. Within FedRAMP, an accredited third party assessment organization (3PAO) 
performs and independently tests the CSP’s cloud service to determine the effective­
ness of security control implementation [14]. A discussion of the 3PAO’s responsi­
bilities is beyond the scope of this section. Instead this section focuses on the Plan of 
Action and Milestones (POA&Ms).30 Once the 3PAO has completed conducting an 
assessment of the security controls, the Security Assessment Report (SAR)31 is 
developed, which is used by the CSP as a source for identifying, documenting, and 
managing the mitigation32 of “medium”33 and “high”34 risk security vulnerabili­
ties.35 The POA&M is a tool used by the CSP, FedRAMP, and the “Federal Agency” 
when tracking and reporting on the progress of remediating security weaknesses and 
deficiencies. The POA&M36 addresses the specific tasks and resources, including a 
schedule for completing the remediation activities.

31From FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO). Plan of Action and Milestones (Template). 
Washington: US General Services Administration; 2012. POA&Ms are based on the findings and rec-
ommendations of the SAR excluding any remediation actions taken.
32FedRAMP specifies 90 days for “medium” and 30 days for “high.”
33Vulnerabilities are labeled “medium” if they have a CVSS base score of 4.0–6.9.
34Vulnerabilities are labeled “high” if they have a CVSS base score of 7.0–10.0.
35The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) standard provides guidance on scoring vulner-
abilities. Available from: http://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-guide.html.
36The POA&M document is one of three key documents (SSP, SAR, and POA&M) used by the JAB to 
make a determination of a provisional authorization and the federal agency in making a determination 
for leveraging the cloud service.

SUMMARY
This chapter presented a short case study to illustrate how the NIST RMF can be 
applied within the context of FedRAMP. In addition, some of the various FedRAMP 
deliverables were discussed as they relate to the security categorization, security con­
trol selection, and the implementation of the security controls (including support­
ing documentation) and documenting corrective actions resulting from the security 
controls assessment. Since the NIST RMF is a continuous process, documents will 
require regular reviews and updates on a continuous basis to address changes to the 
cloud service information system and the operating environment.
