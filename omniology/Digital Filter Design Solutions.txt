Preface 
There are very many people who have unwittingly contributed to the idea and 
compilation of this book. They come from various walks of life and have made 
indelible impressions on me. I am thankful to the director of the Marine and 
Acoustic Centre, QinetiQ, Winfrith, John Wade, and group manager Michael Gill 
for allowing me the use of  QinetiQ’s facilities.  I am indebted to many colleagues 
of mine who have influenced the thinking behind the content of the book: Phil 
Nash, Dave Tyler, and Nick Middleton have been very supportive, perhaps 
without full knowledge of their influence during the writing of the book. 
I am thankful for the support of my wife, Carlotta, and children, Karen and 
Andrew. I hope they now understand that I do not know everything – this will 
soon be well known outside the family circle. They have been very kind and 
patient. My wider family and friends, past teachers, and mentors have all taught 
me how to keep going – many thanks.  
I hope and pray that this collection of digital filters will be a blessing to the 
many users who apply their trade with diligence.

List of Matlab® Functions 
 
Cascade2 
 
This function returns the convolution of FIR filters in vectors a and b. The length 
of the new filter h is length(a) + length(b) – 1. This function is also used for 
general multiplication of two polynomial functions whose coefficients are placed 
in vectors a and b. 
 
 
Usage  
 
[h] = cascade2(a,b) 
 
Input  
 
a  
filter coefficients 
 
 
 
 
b  
filter coefficients 
 
Output  
 
h  
cascaded filter coefficients 
 
Notes 
(1) Inputs a and b should be row or column vectors and linear 
phase. 
(2) If either a or b is a row vector, it is converted into a column 
vector. 
(3) Output vector h is a column vector whose length is length(a) + 
length(b) – 1.   
 
 
CompacBPF 
 
This function returns the compacted half-band band-pass FIR filter coefficients. 
All zero-valued coefficients are removed from the filter to half its original length. 
The output is further reduced by half due the symmetry of the linear phase filter, 
so that the final length is a quarter of the original length.  
 
Usage  
 
[hpac] = compacBPF(h) 
 
Input  
 
h  
full-length half-band coefficients 
 

 
Digital Filter Design Solutions 
xiv
Output  
 
hpac compacted half-band filter coefficients 
 
Notes  
 
(1) The input filter must be full length containing symmetry about  
the center coefficient h(L/2 + 1). 
 
 
 
 
(2) L must be even. 
 
 
 
 
(3) The output hpac uses the symmetry of h after removal of zero- 
valued coefficients. 
(4) h should be either a single column or row vector. 
(5) The center of the pass band needs to be at 0.5. 
 
 
CompacLPF 
 
This function returns the compacted half-band low-pass FIR filter coefficients. All 
zero valued coefficients are removed from the filter to half its original length. The 
output is further reduced by half due to the symmetry of the linear phase filter, so 
that the final length is a quarter of the original length.  
 
Usage  
 
[hpac] = compacLPF(h) 
 
Input  
 
h  
full-length half-band coefficients 
 
Output  
 
hpac compacted half-band filter coefficients 
 
Notes  
 
(1) The input filter must be full length containing symmetry about  
the center coefficient h(L/2 + 1). 
 
 
 
 
(2) L must be even. 
 
 
 
 
(3) The output hpac uses the symmetry of h after removal of zero- 
valued coefficients. 
 
 
 
 
(4) h should be either a single column or row vector. 
 
 
Decx2 
 
This function returns the filtered or downsampled (decimated) data using the 
compacted low- or band-pass filter h. The decimation factor is 2.  
 
If h is a compact half-band low-pass filter and the string 'LPF' is added to the 
input argument, the function implements the standard time domain low-pass 
filtering process. 
 
If h is a compact half-band band-pass filter and the string 'BPF' is added to the 
input argument, the function implements the standard time domain band-pass 
filtering process. 

 
List of Matlab® Functions 
 
xv
If h is a compact half-band band-pass filter and the string 'BPx' is added to the 
input argument, the function implements the decimation by 2 operation. 
 
The final data length is approximately half that of the original length when the 
decimation option is chosen. 
 
Usage  
 
[y] = decx2(h,x) to implement decimation by 2; low-pass filtering 
 
 
 
 
[y] = decx2(h,x, 'LPF') for low-pass filtering only; no decimation 
 
 
 
 
[y] = decx2(h,x, 'BPF') for band-pass filtering only; no decimation 
 
 
 
 
[y] = decx2(h,x, 'BPx') decimation by 2; band-pass filtering 
 
Input  
 
h  
compact half-band filter coefficients 
 
 
 
 
x  
input data 
 
Output  
 
y  
data decimated by factor of 2 or filtered without decimation 
 
Notes  
 
(1) Both h and x should be either a single column or row vector. 
 
 
 
 
(2) The output y is a single column vector. 
 
 
 
 
(3) Ensure that extraneous frequency components cannot fold back  
into the pass band when the 'BPx' decimation is chosen.

(3) The attenuation is determined by the first lobe in the rejection  
band

for minimum phase filters, although N could be up to 90 for larger 
Fc

PhaseShift  
 
This function introduces an arbitrary phase shift, theta into a real signal, s using 
the Hilbert transform and a low-pass filter. The signal is assumed to be

Usage  
 
[s] = PhaseShift(s,h,g,theta,str) 
 
 
 
 
[s] = PhaseShift(s,h,g,theta, 'Re') to generate real part of the phase  
         shifted signal

str  
specifies real or imaginary part; when str is replaced by 'Re',  
the function returns the real component of the phase-shifted 
signal, whereas when replaced by 'Im' the imaginary phase 
shifted component is returned 
 
Output

Notes  
 
(1) Theta must be a scalar. 
 
 
 
 
(2) If theta is positive a phase lag is introduced, whereas if theta is  
negative a phase lead is introduced. 
(3) h and g should have the same bandwidth. 
 
 
Shift 
 
This function shifts each element up or down n steps along vector A, treating the 
positions j as though they are on a circle. A(j) moves to position (j+n) and A(L–
n+1:L) occupy positions (1:n). L is the number of elements in A. If n is positive 
the shift is in the forward direction; that is, toward increasing elemental position, 
whereas if n is negative, the shift is backwards.  
 
Usage  
 
[A] = shift(A, n) 
 
Input  
 
A  
array whose elements will be shifted 
 
 
 
 
n  
number of shifts to perform. If n is noninteger it is rounded  
to the  nearest integer 
 
 
Output  
 
A  
array of shifted elements 
 
Notes  
 
(1) n cannot be a vector or a matrix. 
 
 
 
 
(2) A is restricted to either row or column vectors. 
(3) This function is similar to the function ‘circshift’ in recent 
versions of Matlab, except that ‘shift’ operates only on row or 
column vectors. 
 
Example  
A = [1 2 3 4]     
 
 
 
 
A = shift(A,2) 
 
 
 
 
A = [3 4 1 2], after shifting 2 places to the right.

coefficient values of the unity gain low-pass filter. The length of the differentiator 
is one less than its progenitor. Thus to design an odd-length first-order 
differentiator, the length of the progenitor should be even. 
 
Usage

frequency response to screen.

Ugc_diff2 
 
This function converts a unity gain filter h into the corresponding second-order 
differentiator, d2. This function is limited to the design of low-pass second-order 
differentiators. The length of the differentiator is one greater than its progenitor. 
Thus to design an odd-length second-order differentiator, the length of the 
progenitor should be even. 
 
Usage 
[d2] = ugc_diff2(h, 'p') to generate differentiator coefficients and 
plot frequency response to screen 
 
[d2] = ugc_diff2(h) to generate differentiator without plots.

h

Chapter 1 
Introduction 
1.1 BACKGROUND 
This collection of predesigned linear phase digital filters has been prepared to 
serve the category of users whose research or development applications require 
some form of digital filtering, but who do not have the time to explore the very 
wide range of digital filter design techniques available. Often, the research or 
development requirement is to demonstrate a fundamental operational principle 
where basic filtering is needed as part of a more complex operation. Moreover, in 
some large research and development departments the design process for key 
filtering tasks can be duplicated several times over, leading to loss of valuable 
time and a substantial cost to the delivery of the product. The product here is not 
limited to engineering prototypes, but extends to high value data in finance, 
meteorology, economics, and imaging. The aim of this working handbook 
therefore is to provide a collection of digital filters whose characteristics can be 
quickly determined, compared, and applied immediately, avoiding the sometimes 
intricate design process.    
This is a rather ambitious aim given the many excellent filter design software, 
textbooks, and research literature dedicated to digital signal processing. And 
furthermore, by the very nature of its coverage, a short collection of digital filters 
cannot possibly satisfy the wide filtering requirements found in practice. 
However, in a busy R&D department where time to market is challenging and 
aggressive, and where quick product demonstration is a priority, predesigned 
filters are believed to present a practical solution. In principle, the book is 
designed to match a predefined set of filtering solutions to a similarly predefined 
set of user requirements. In this context, the focus is removed from a more 
rigorous filter design exercise to product demonstration. This assumes that the 
collection of filters matches the functional domain of the user and that such a 
domain could be specified for general applications. This remains a primary 
limitation of this approach.

1.2 CHOICE OF FILTERS 
The choice of filters for general applications was based on three broad criteria, 
namely, that filters should: (a) provide as little distortion as possible to the signal; 
(b) be as flat as possible in the pass-band, and; (c) exhibit attenuation 
characteristics of better than –90 dB (~3x10-5 in absolute terms) in the stopband. 
Other desirable characteristics include short filter length, short frequency 
transition beyond the cutoff point, and possibly the ability to manipulate the 
attenuation in the stopband. These conditions are believed to be consistent with a 
wide range of general applications where one can make no assumptions about the 
end use of the filters. 
The conditions (a) to (c) are usually satisfied by linear phase filters. This class 
of filters is most easily designed using finite impulse response (FIR) techniques 
with appropriate windowing, known as the window technique. Although this 
technique is simple and satisfies most requirements, it tends to possess relatively 
long filter lengths and poor control of the sharpness of the filter edges. However, 
the main advantages are that FIR filters are always stable and they are least 
susceptible to round-off arithmetic errors as can occur in some shorter recursive 
filter types. More importantly, phase linearity is guaranteed in FIR filters, thereby 
avoiding signal distortion. 
To achieve our aim, the characteristics of each filter in the book are presented 
graphically. This takes the form of four graphs showing: (a) normalized frequency 
response; (b) impulse response; (c) step response, and (d) pass-band 
characteristics. 
The first (a), is the log magnitude plotted against normalized frequency F, the 
latter being the ratio of the frequency variable f to the Nyquist frequency, fN (i.e. F 
= f/fN). The second (b), are the actual filter coefficients, also referred to as the 
impulse response function, and represents the response of the filter to a pulse 
function of ideally zero duration. In this case, the coefficient values are plotted 
against index k. The step response function (c), is the response of the filter to a 
unit step function; again, this is plotted against index k, where the latter could be 
interpreted as time or some other spatial variable, depending on application.  The 
pass band characteristics (d), are a close-up view of the normalized frequency 
response around the pass band.  
1.3 OVERVIEW 
In Chapter 2, a description is given of how the filters presented in this book were 
designed. Moreover, some basic implementation algorithms are described. These 
cover time and frequency domain filtering; conversion to minimum phase filters; 
use of the low pass filters as a building block for high-pass, band-pass, band-stop 
and notch filters; cascading FIR filters; sampling rate change, including time and 
frequency decimation, and interpolation. All the algorithms given in this book

were tested in Matlab, and in situations where it was deemed significant enough, 
the corresponding Matlab function is provided. Many algorithms have been 
described in pseudocode; that is, a listing of logical steps that could be easily 
converted to most programming languages, such as FORTRAN and C and its 
derivatives, Pascal and Basic. Thus anyone with some background in any of these 
languages should be able to implement the algorithms. 
Chapters 3 to 5 are different in nature than Chapter 2. These give the filter 
coefficients as well as their performance features in a data sheet format. Each 
filter takes up a single page in these chapters. In fact, each filter is treated as an 
individual product with its associated data sheet. In this regard, the rest of the 
book should be seen as applications information. Some preliminary material is 
given at the beginning of each chapter that provides information on terminology 
and definitions of terms used to characterize the filters. The preliminary material 
in Chapter 3 (Low Pass Filters) contains discussions that are largely applicable to 
the other two chapters. As such, the introductory material in Chapters 4 (High 
Pass Filters) and 5 (Band Pass Filters) are short, as they are unique to their 
description and characterization. 
Chapter 6 provides coefficients for first and second order differentiating 
filters. There has been a reluctance to apply FIR differentiators because of the 
noise amplification associated with such filters. In Chapter 6, we show how to 
manage the noise and avoid its amplification. Again the coefficients are viewed as 
individual products with specific properties. The limitations of their use are also 
discussed there. 
Chapter 7 (Hilbert Transformers) is very different from any of the other 
chapters. It gives the Hilbert filter coefficients, but within the context of FM/PM 
demodulation. This is a natural progression since the Hilbert transform is about 
the management of phase and is best appreciated within this context. We chose 
two FM/PM demodulation schemes to characterize. For those not familiar with 
demodulation concepts, we recommend the use of a good text on communications 
theory, although some effort has been made to be self-explanatory within the 
chapter. The DC phase errors, AC phase errors, and demodulation bandwidth have 
been characterized for a given set of Hilbert and low-pass filters. As such, the data 
associated with a given set of filter coefficients covers two pages, with two 
additional pages giving the performance of the demodulation schemes mentioned 
above. In addition to this, the noise propagation through the demodulation 
schemes has also been provided. We believe that given this background, the 
Hilbert filter would be better appreciated and applied.  
1.4 FILTER COEFFICIENTS 
All digital filter coefficients given in this collection are stored and easily 
retrievable from the compact disc accompanying this book. The coefficients in 
this format form the embodiment of this offering, and as such are equally

important to the descriptive information that accompany it. The filter coefficients 
are also archived in print alongside the displayed characteristics. A traditional 
handbook style layout is used for quick filter identification and selection. We hope 
this format and approach bring much pleasure to a host of filtering applications.

Chapter 2 
Filter Design and Implementation 
The aim of this chapter is to show how the filters presented in this book were 
designed, thereby providing a basis for understanding the limitations of the 
design. The filters described here were designed using the well-known windowing 
technique. In this technique, the desired frequency response H(F), is first created 
in the frequency domain and then its inverse Fourier transform (IFT) is found. 
This yields the impulse response function H(k), which is then discretized, 
truncated, and windowed to form hk in the spatial or time domain k. Note that in 
the following discussion both H(k) and H(F) should be treated as continuous 
functions, whereas Hk and HF are their respective discretized forms. The 
windowing and truncation of Hk yield the finite impulse response (FIR) digital 
filter, hk. 
In principle, the domain of the impulse response function H(F) is infinite, but 
to be able to use it in a digital context it is truncated to some reasonable length. If 
an FFT is performed on the truncated form Hk, ringing is observed on the response 
HF in the frequency domain. Ringing is characterized by a damped oscillatory 
behavior at the transition edges of the filter; this is a consequence of the well-
known Gibbs phenomenon [1]. Moreover, truncation of the impulse response 
function distorts the ideal filter characteristics in the frequency domain, which 
were set initially at the beginning of the design process. In other words, the 
frequency response of the discretized filter HF bears only some resemblance to its 
template H(F). In fact, truncation induces an inadvertent convolution of H(F) with 
the rectangular window [2]. To truncate Hk with limited effects in the frequency 
domain, the said function is usually convolved with special window functions, Wk, 
which taper the ends smoothly to zero in the time domain. The latter functions 
tend to preserve the central portion, or main lobe, of the symmetric impulse 
response while carefully managing the values on the sides of the said response 
smoothly to zero. 
For discussion purposes, it is useful to distinguish between the filter order and 
the filter length. The filter order L, is the highest exponent of the z-transform of 
the FIR filter, and its length is always one greater than its order, that is, the filter 
length is (L+1). Occasionally, the filter order L is made slightly greater than the 

6 
Digital Filter Design Solutions 
design filter order LD, the latter being used in the actual fabrication of the filter. 
This will be explained later in Section 2.4, “Design Rules.” 
2.1 IMPULSE RESPONSE FUNCTION Hk 
The continuous impulse response function HLP(k) for the ideal low-pass filter in 
the time (or spatial) domain is the inverse Fourier transform of the unit step 
function H(F). HLP(k)  is well documented (see e.g. [2,3,9]) and is of the form

where fc is the design low-pass cut-off frequency, fN is the Nyquist frequency (= 
fs/2), fs being the sampling frequency, and K = 512 is a gain factor. Additionally, 
note that Hk  (or HLP(k)) is the basis for  development of  the high-pass, band-pass, 
and band-reject filters and will be used in the realization of such filters. Figure 
2.1(a) shows part of the impulse response function of (2.2) for N = 1024, and Fc  = 
0.4, whereas Figure 2.1(b) shows its FFT using a radix two algorithm and floating 
point arithmetic. The vertical scale in Figure 2.1(b) has been normalized to show 
value 1 in the pass band. There is a 10% overshoot (from ringing) clearly visible 
close to the transition point in Figure 2.1(a). Note that Figure 2.1(c) is the same as 
Figure 2.1(b) but with its magnitude converted to a logarithmic scale (i.e., 20 log 
|Hω|). 
2.2 WINDOW FUNCTION Wk 
Several window (or weighting) functions are available in signal processing [4] 
with the Kaiser, Blackman, Harris-Nutall, and Gaussian windows showing very 
good attenuation properties in the rejection band [4,5,10]. Additionally, the 
Blackman and Harris-Nutall windows are special cases of the short cosine series 
window. However, in practice, there is usually a trade-off between main lobe 
width and side lobe area. This usually translates into a trade-off between filter 
length and edge transition sharpness using the window technique. In this regard, 
the Kaiser window is optimal in terms of the trade-off between main lobe width 
and side lobe area. The  Gaussian  window  has the special property that it remains

quadratic profile shown for a given LD in the frequency domain of Figure 2.2(b) 
induces corresponding changes in the filter transition edge during convolution and 
is responsible for the smearing out of the transition region. In general, the shorter 
the design filter order LD in relation to the filter length, the sharper the filter 
transition edge for a given α.

(e.g., [5]). Figure 2.3 shows the design process and interrelationships between 
parameters. It is the L+1 values of hk that are compiled and presented in this book.  
The filter response hω is obtained by replacing the discarded values of hk with 
zeroes, then performing the FFT on the resulting sequence. Figure 2.4, curve (c), 
shows the resulting FFT response when Hk is Gaussian windowed, but not 
truncated. It is quite noticeable that the attenuation in the rejection band is close to 
–180 dB (i.e. a signal  power  rejection  by  a factor  of 10−9).  But how is the filter

response affected when both windowing and truncation are applied to Hk? In 
curve (b) of Figure 2.4, Hk is both Gaussian windowed and truncated to L + 1 = 
99, but zero-padded to array length N = 1024 for FFT purposes as noted earlier. 
Clearly, there is a significant loss of attenuation in comparison to (c) of about 80 
dB. Curve (a) in Figure 2.4 is identical to that given in Figure 2.1(c) and is used 
for comparison:  it represents a Gaussian window of infinite width which 
corresponds to an infinitely wide rectangular window.  Moreover, curve (a) serves 
to highlight the trade-off between filter edge transition sharpness and relatively 
poor attenuation on one hand, and the softer transition edge   with   relatively   
good attenuation on the other. Thus with standard precision floating-point 
arithmetic, Gaussian windowing and truncation give a good compromise between

a sharp filter edge with poor rejection, and a smeared-out filter edge with good 
rejection, notwithstanding the gains achieved with a longer filter length. In the 
discussion above for Figure 2.4 (b) and (c), LD = 90, Fc = 0.4, and precision 
floating-point arithmetic were used in the calculation. Other digital filter design 
techniques that optimize the filter transition width and the extent of ringing in the 
pass band are outside the scope of this selection of filters.  
One other important property of the filter designed in this way is that the 
impulse response is symmetric about the center element 
; that is,

Moreover, because the filter has an odd number of coefficients and is symmetric, 
the filter is classed as Type I [5]. With the exception of some of the differentiating 
filters, the rest of the filters in this collection are Type I. 
2.4 DESIGN RULES 
In this section we describe simple rules for the design of the filters given in this 
book. Before going through the design steps, it is worthwhile observing how the 
attenuation A behaves when the design length LD in (2.3) varies as a percentage of 
the filter length L+1. In other words, let the relationship between the design length 
LD and the final filter length L+1 be

where ROUND(x) means the integer part of x, and ε is a fudge factor that is allowed 
to vary arbitrarily, say between –0.5 and 0.5. When ε = 0, the design length and 
the final filter length are identical, however, if ε < 0, then the design length is 
smaller than the final filter length, and vice versa. Figure 2.5 shows a typical plot 
of attenuation against the percentage length of the filter. It is readily observed that 
when ε = 0, the attenuation is about –90 dB, but as the design length LD is 
reduced, the attenuation increases. Moreover, the fact that we have kept the design 
length as a ratio of the final length of the filter means that the wide variation in 
attenuation normally seen when LD is varied arbitrarily is now removed. 
Furthermore, the curve in Figure 2.5 is applicable to all filter types, lengths, and 
bandwidths, including high-pass, band-pass, Hilbert, and differentiating filters. 
This approach gives us a key advantage in manipulating the attenuation of a 
window-designed linear phase filter hitherto not encountered in practice. 
In order to design a filter using this approach, we need to consider only three 
parameters: the attenuation, the filter length, and the transition width. There are 
two design approaches:

(1) In the first option, if a low-pass filter of specified length, say L+1, and 
attenuation A is required, then the design length, or Gaussian window parameter 
LD is determined using both A and L+1. The empirical relation between LD, A, and 
L+1 is given by

Having obtained the design length, it is then fed into the Gaussian window 
function (2.3), and replacing N in (2.2) with L, the result is combined in (2.4) to 
get the desired filter coefficients. Note that the transition width ∆F is determined 
solely by the length of the filter, so choosing the latter automatically sets the 
former. The empirical relation between these two is given by

(2) In the second option, if a low pass filter of specified transition width, say ∆F, 
and attenuation A is required, then the filter length is determined by (2.8), 
whereupon it is substituted into (2.7) to yield the new design length. Equations 
(2.3), (2.2), and (2.4) are again employed to calculate the filter coefficients.

impulse response; (b) minimum phase impulse response; (c) phase response for (a); and (d) phase

There are a few points to note: (a) the transition width ∆F, is the normalized 
frequency width between the 10% and 90% value on the edge of the filter, (b) the 
attenuation A is in decibels (dB) and should be greater than –150 dB, (c) the 
attenuation A is determined by the height of the first lobe in the rejection band, 
and (d) the pass band ripple is determined primarily by the attenuation in the stop 
band, thus –100 dB attenuation would in principle correspond to about 2x10–5 
peak-to-peak ripple. Further details regarding (2.7) and (2.8) are given in Chapter 
3. 
Figure 2.6 gives a Matlab function to calculate low-pass FIR filter 
coefficients using the design rules given above. Note that to implement the second 
approach discussed there, we would need to calculate the filter length from (2.8) 
before using the LPFCoef function. Other filter types will be discussed later in this 
chapter where low-pass filters will be used as building blocks for them.

coefficients of the linear phase. 
 
In some applications, a minimum phase filter is required. The LPFCoef function 
will return low-pass minimum phase filter coefficients when the input argument is 
appended with the string 'min'. If 'min' is not present in the input argument, linear 
phase coefficients are returned. In general, to convert a linear phase filter into a 
minimum phase type, one may use the Matlab polystab function [7]: 
 
                                          hmin = polystab(h)*norm(h)/norm(polystab(h))                             (2.9)                 
 
where hmin is the vector of minimum phase coefficients and h is the linear phase 
input coefficients. Note that polystab stabilizes a polynomial with respect to the 
unit circle by reflecting roots residing on the outside to inside the circle. It has 
been observed that when the filter length approaches 90, and the cutoff frequency 
is less than about 0.15, polystab itself may fail, and as such this approach is limited 
to smaller filter lengths.  
Figure 2.7 shows the impulse response for a linear phase filter and its 
minimum phase counterpart using the LPFCoef function for a 55-tap filter with 
cutoff at 0.4. Notice that (a) the minimum phase filter coefficients are not 
symmetrical about its center like the linear phase, (b) the frequency responses of 
both filters are identical, (c) the minimum phase impulse response may need to be 
multiplied by –1 on occasions, and (d) the step response of the minimum phase is 
asymmetrical whilst its counterpart is symmetrical (see Figure 2.8). In the next 
section, we will consider how the filter is implemented. 
2.5 FILTER IMPLEMENTATION 
There are two ways of implementing the filter: (1) the direct, or time domain 
method and, (2) the frequency domain approach. The method chosen is usually 

16 
Digital Filter Design Solutions 
dictated by the application. For example, if high-speed real-time filtering is 
required and L is relatively small, say less than 150, then the time domain method 
may be attractive, whereas in offline applications, as can occur in some medical 
image reconstruction processes, the frequency domain approach may be a better 
option. The method is also determined by whether a dedicated FFT hardware 
processor is available. 
There is another more fundamental issue between these two approaches: in 
the time domain approach a significant amount of information is often lost at the 
beginning and end of the process unless some measure is taken to mitigate the 
filtering effects. This happens because implementation in the time domain is 
equivalent to carrying out a weighted average over a selected set of data points, 
equal to the length of the filter, then shifting the whole operation one datum step 
forward. The filter length spans a period in time, and the calculated average must 
correspond statistically to the center of the set of points. The first filtered result, 
therefore, occurs midway along the length of the filter, and thus there is no 
information on the data points that precede the first filtered datum. This point will 
be illustrated further below. 
       In the frequency domain approach, an FFT is performed on both the data set 
and the filter taps. The two sets are multiplied utilizing the scalar product then 
inverse Fourier transformed (IFFT) to give the desired result. This technique 
produces a signal in the time domain with the same length as that of the FFT 
thereby retaining the number of data points, or even interpolating to produce a 
longer data set. The disadvantage of this technique is that the data is partitioned 
into time blocks and may be of consequence in some applications. Furthermore, 
the number of operations and the use of additional memory may also be important. 
However, this also opens up other more interesting ways of interpreting the 
filtering process such as the use of overlapping time blocks for fast filtering (e.g., 
[6]). This is discussed in Section 2.5.3, “Frequency Domain Method.” 
2.5.1 Direct Method – Postprocessing 
In the postprocessing method, signal processing is usually carried out on a block 
of archived data of size N. The filtering process involves multiplying the filter 
coefficients with the corresponding archived signal elements stored in the data 
array. The mth-filtered output 
 is given by

essentially a weighted moving average filter. This process is demonstrated in 
Figure 2.9. Notice though that the last filtered value is at position N−L/2. In the 
direct approach utilizing this postprocessing method, we lose L data points (L/2 
from both ends) if the data length is fixed.

This means that only L/2+1 filter coefficients need to be stored, so that more 
memory becomes available. This procedure can also be expressed in pseudocode 
as shown in Figure 2.9(b). Within the Matlab environment, the filter function is 
used to realize the above operation as 
 
y = filter(h,1,x)                                             (2.12)  
 
where y is the filtered output, h is the filter coefficients, and x is the input data.  
A noteworthy point here is that any filter selected from our collection should 
be normalized by dividing by K = 512, unless otherwise indicated. This comes 
from the way in which the impulse response function is defined in equation (2.2). 
Although not a requirement, this gives us the benefit of recording the values in 
printed format to 4 decimal places with a resolution of 2×10−7, corresponding to 
22-bit precision. This is useful in most applications, but where higher resolution is 
required, these must be obtained from the accompanying compact disc. 
2.5.2 Direct Method – Concurrent  Processing 
The direct method is easily adapted to real time filter processing. In this 
adaptation, a new filtered value is clocked out at the same rate at which data is 
clocked in, where the data is assumed to have come from an analog-to-digital 
converter (ADC) or other processor. Of course, the maximum clock rate is limited 
by the processing time of the core filter operation as determined by the sum of the 
products of the filter coefficients and data (defined by (2.11)).  
This real time filtering procedure setting up a temporary data array whose 
length is the same as that of the filter involves array, say L+1. Data enter at 
position L+1 along the array. On each cycle, existing data are then shifted one 
position along the data array and the most recent datum added to the (L+1)th 
position. The oldest datum x1, corresponding to position 1 along the data array is 
shifted out and discarded. On each cycle, the coefficients in the filter array are 
multiplied with corresponding elements of the data array and summed to yield the 
current filtered output. Figure 2.10 illustrates this process and gives a pseudocode 
for its implementation. Note that this is identical to the offline procedure shown in 
Figure 2.9, except  that  the data  array for  concurrent  processing is  conceptually

A Matlab script that simulates concurrent processing is given in Figure

and is similar to the Matlab function circshift, except that the former operates 
only on single (1×N) rows or column vectors.

2.5.3 Frequency Domain Method  
This technique utilizes the FFT to achieve filtering in the frequency domain. To 
understand how this procedure is carried out, let x represent the data  set of  length 
M, and h, the filter coefficients of length L+1 as before. Furthermore, let the filter 
length be less than the data length. If y is the output array and its length is chosen 
to be N so that 
, then successful filtering can be carried out in the 
frequency domain [2,5,6]. The condition above is derived from an application of 
the convolution theorem and is required to avoid signal aliasing on the filter 
output. Generally, if a radix 2 FFT is used, N is chosen to be a minimum power of 
2, which is greater than or equal to M+L+1.  
+
≥
L
M
N
For the filtering procedure itself, x is chosen to be of length N and an N-point 
FFT is used to give the discretized output XF,j (j = 1,2,…, N). Likewise, the filter h 
is also zero-padded out to length N (i.e., 
j
 for j > L+1) and Fourier 
transformed to form the output H
0
=
F,j (j = 1,2,…, N). An inverse Fourier transform is 
performed on the complex scalar product of X and H to yield the filtered output y, 
i.e., y = IFFT{X.H}1. Note that if x is real then only the real part of the IFFT is 
used, although we can use the complex FFT to improve efficiency by a factor of 2 
(see e.g., [2] pp.211-219; [6] pp.307-315, [11]). 
If x itself streams continuously from, say, an ADC interface, then it is useful 
to take N samples to perform the convolution in the frequency domain with an 
overlap of length L with the next set of samples. This is often referred to as the 
overlap-save method. The procedure is as follows: 
 
1. Perform an N-point FFT on the filter coefficients, hj after zero-
padding to length N (i.e., 
 for j > L+1), to create H

ω. Save 
result for subsequent use.

6. Discard the last L data points from each successive cycle of filtering 
in 5.  
7. Append the remaining N−L filtered data points to the previous set of 
results, y(r−1). Repeat steps 2 to 7 until data exhausted. 
8. Shift all elements in total data set, y by L/2 forward in time to align 
with original data. 
 
The procedure given above could be set in pseudocode as shown in Figure 2.13. 
The implementation could take on several forms. For example, the method of 
updating the samples could be via a routine designed to read an interface and pass 
a predetermined set of values to the filter procedure. The output yout, could be 
saved directly to disk by appending to existing stored data, or displayed in real 
time. In Matlab, a second technique known as the overlap-add technique is 
achieved via  
y = fftfilt(h,x,N)                                               (2.14) 
 
where the symbols are as used above. It should be noted that if the filter order is 
less than about 45, the direct or time domain method is more efficient, whereas for 
larger orders, the frequency domain approach is preferred. The optimum FFT 
length N for frequency domain convolution is given in Table 2.1, bearing in mind 
that below about 45 the time domain approach is more efficient [6].

frequency component, 0.5sin(π0.02t), is passed while the upper is rejected.  
The pass-band performance of the filter could be determined by the extent of 
the difference between the expected lower frequency component 0.5sin(π0.02t) 
and the filter output. Figure 2.14(c) shows this error for the output shown in part 
(b). Note that the peak-to-peak error is 7.6×10–6. This matches well the predicted 
pass-band error of 6.7×10–6 at normalized frequency of 0.02, shown in part (d) of 
the figure. Although the low-pass filter has a specified cutoff at 0.2, the effective 
bandwidth for precision work is only 0.1. Note further that if the signal were 
corrupted with white noise, this second filtering operation as shown in (b), would 
remove 80% of the noise. Filtering of noisy data will be discussed later in Section 
2.9. In the next section, we will use the low-pass filter as a building block for 
other filter types, such as high-pass and band-pass filters. 
2.6 THE LOW-PASS FILTER AS A BUILDING BLOCK 
In this section, the low-pass filter is used as a fundamental building block to build 
common filters as well as more complex structures. Interestingly, when designing 
filters from low-pass blocks, it is customary to work with the impulse response 
functions (i.e., in the time domain), but to the untrained eye these functions do not 
convey much. In fact, the design is best understood in the frequency domain. The 
reason for this type of cross-referencing is that the impulse response is 
mathematically well defined in the time domain (2.2), but the filtering operation is 
best understood in the Fourier space in terms of signals that are blocked and those 
that  are  passed.  In  the following  subsections, the all-pass, high-pass, band-pass,

2.6.1 The All-Pass Filter  
The all-pass filter is derived directly from the low-pass filter. It has a cutoff at the 
Nyquist frequency, which means that it exhibits a flat characteristic in the pass 
band of magnitude 1 (0 dB). The phase characteristics are linear, as for all FIR 
filters, and cover the entire Nyquist half-space, 0 ≤ F ≤ 1. The discrete impulse 
response for the all-pass filter hAP is given in terms of the low-pass impulse 
response by

coefficients resemble the classic sinc function. Regardless of whether L is odd or

 where HF, AP is the discretized half-space frequency response of the filter. This 
will be used in subsequent filters as a new building block. The function LPFCoef 
will generate hAP, when Fc = 1, for both odd and even L; however, for the former, 
the frequency response exhibits a zero at the said frequency, and therefore an 
unwelcome transition edge at the Nyquist frequency. But this is one reason for 
using even L (i.e., odd filter length) for the filters presented throughout this book. 
2.6.2 The High-Pass Filter  
The design of high-pass filters follows the same windowing and truncation 
procedure described earlier for low-pass filters; however, the discrete impulse 
response function hHP(Fc) with cut-on  at Fc is given by

where hAP and hLP(Fc) are the all- and low-pass building blocks. Though not 
obvious, the difference between these two impulse response functions gives a 
high-pass filter with cut-on at Fc. This operation becomes more apparent in the 
frequency domain where it results in the difference between the magnitudes of the 
all-pass and low-pass filters.  This is shown in Figure 2.15 where the filter 
responses in the Fourier space have been normalized. 
2.6.3 The Band-Pass Filter 
In this case, a low-pass impulse response is subtracted from a second low pass set 
at a higher frequency to give the band-pass response. This process translates the 
lower   cutoff   frequency  into   the  cut-on   edge,  while   the  higher  of  the  two

–100 dB is readily realized. Figure 2.17 shows a 99-tap impulse response function 
and its frequency response characteristics for Fnotch = 0.35. If more attenuation is 
needed one should try a higher filter order, or cascade two notch filters. If two 
identical filters are cascaded, the result is a new filter whose decibel attenuation 
and length are doubled. Cascaded filters will be discussed in Section 2.7. 
2.6.5 A Low-Pass Filter with Gain Near Transition Edge 
In some instances, it is required to design a filter with uncommon shape in the 
pass band. Armed with an appropriate set of filter sections, the required filter 
could be assembled. As an  example, suppose a low pass filter is  desired with cut- 
off  at  say, Fc, and  with  peak  gain of α close to the transition  edge. This  can be 
made up from a low-pass filter with cut-off Fc and a band-pass section tailored so 
that its peak magnitude is α (linear scale), and one of its edges at Fc-off is identical 
to Fc. This picture is now readily transferred into the time domain by a linear

where α is the  linear gain  factor, and hBP(Fc-on, Fc-off) is the band-pass filter at the  
indicated  cut-on  and  cut-off  frequencies.  Figure 2.18 shows a  low-pass  filter 
derived in this way, where Fc-off = 0.55 and the number of coefficients for the low-
pass section is LLP = 99, whereas for the band-pass section its length LBP = 55, 
with cutoff edge at Fc-off = 0.55, bandwidth of 0.1, and α = 0.1. However, it is 
advisable that the length of major filter section, which in this case is the low-pass 
filter, should be longer than the other composite filter sections. Moreover, all filter 
coefficients should be center aligned before summing. A quadratic characteristic 
could be realized instead of the band-pass filter section by using a second-order 
differentiating filter.

2.6.5.1 Alternative Method 
An alternative method of producing a low-pass filter with gain near the transition 
edge is by using three low-pass sections. This is readily seen from (2.22) where 
the band-pass section already comprises two low-pass sections, so that by 
straightforward substitution of (2.19) into (2.22), the latter is reexpressed as

The use of one method in preference to the other depends on whether the resultant 
shape and filter lengths of the composites are crucial, since both relations do not 
necessarily give the same result for different lengths. 
2.7 CASCADED FILTERS 
If the output of one filter is fed into a second, then the filters are said to be 
cascaded. Filters are cascaded mainly to achieve frequency domain characteristics 
that cannot be achieved normally from a single-step design process. Moreover, 
cascading can be used to improve filter stability, such as those observed for 
cascaded integrator comb (CIC) filters in data conversion [6]. Although stability is 
not a problem for FIR filters, cascading the latter type provides interesting 
opportunities, particularly in improving the attenuation in the rejection band. 
The cascading of one FIR filter into another, really a two-stage filtering 
process, can be combined into a single filtering operation. Consider two FIR 
filters whose impulse responses are f and g, and whose lengths are each L+1. The 
filtered output uL+m after cascading f into g is given by

In most cases, only the first L+1 coefficients are needed for the filtering operation 
as demonstrated in (2.11). The following points should be noted regarding the 
cascade filter: (a) the cascading process can be continued successively on pairs of 
filters so that at each stage a new filter is cascaded with the previous result, 
; 
(b) the new length of the filter is doubled to 2L+1 if the lengths are identical; (c) if 
the lengths are not identical, say M+1 and L+1, where M < L, then zero-pad both 
sides of the shorter filter to the longer length, L+1, before cascading. This will 
result in M+L+1 nonzero coefficients.

filter and a truncated result. (b) Ripple in the pass-band. (c) Cascaded and original impulse response 
functions. (d) Frequency response comparison on linear scale. 
 
Take for example a low-pass filter of length 33 (i.e., L = 32), and with Fc = 0.5. 
Applying (2.24) and (2.25) so that the filter is cascaded into itself, we get the new 
length of 65. Figure 2.19 shows the effect of this convolution. Firstly, there is a 
marked increase in attenuation in the rejection band to around –200 dB. Note that 
the attenuation of a 65-point filter designed purely from the Gaussian window 
technique would at best be around –100dB for design length LD = 90. 
Second, there is a shift in the –6 dB point from 0.5 to Fc = 0.46 and if the 65-
point cascaded filter were truncated to 33, its original length, there would then be 
a significant loss in attenuation to about -75 dB. This is worse than the original 
attenuation, however, there is only a small loss in the edge transition width and 
may be significant for use as short sharp cut-off filters. Moreover, ripple in the 
pass-band is significantly increased for the truncated cascade filter, whereas there 
is only a marginal increase for the untruncated filter.

Figure 2.20   (a) Peak-to-peak ripple, and  (b) attenuation for some cascaded low- and band-pass filters 
as a function of their truncated lengths. 
 
Figure 2.20 (a) shows a plot of the peak-to-peak ripple against truncated filter 
length for the two low pass filters of the previous figure. Although the cascade 
lengths are 65 and 109 (for filters of original lengths 33 and 55 respectively), the 
lengths could be safely reduced to 50 and 80 without any significant increase in 
peak-to-peak ripple, while at the same time maintaining a reasonable attenuation 
to about –125dB. This is a gain of –25dB for an increase of 27 coefficients for the 
33-point filter, and 25 for the 55-point. Figure 2.20 (b) shows the relationship 
between attenuation in the rejection band and truncated cascade length for the 
filters cited. In general, this is expensive. It should be emphasized that the filters 
presented in this book are not optimized since design speed, simplicity, and 
availability were deemed important strategically, in terms of meeting the demands 
on product development throughput. Their use will eventually migrate to an 
optimized form as the product or project develops, for which more specialized 
techniques should be sought.  
2.7.1 The Cascaded Notch Filter 
As mentioned earlier, the rejection characteristics of the notch filter could be 
improved by cascading it with itself. Figure 2.21 shows the result of this 
procedure with the notch filter design in Section 2.6.4.1. The attenuation in the 
rejection band was increased from –35 dB to –90 dB at the new cascade length of 
65, with only a small increase in the –6 dB bandwidth. It is worthwhile pointing 
out that at certain frequencies of fN/2n, for n = 1,2,3,…, far better attenuation 
levels could be achieved, even without cascading these filters (fN is the Nyquist 
frequency). A Matlab function that returns the cascade filter given any two 
filters is presented in Figure 2.22. Note that this function should not be used for 
filtering in the time domain.

2.7.2 Alternative Cascade Technique 
The alternative technique to generate filter cascade coefficients is to apply (2.11) 
directly. To do this, we must first zero-pad the shorter of the two filters, say 
, to 
create an initial length of 2L+1. The parameter x in (2.11) is replaced by

This gives identical results to (2.25); however the number of operations associated 
with (2.25) is L(L+1) whereas in (2.27) it is (2L+1)(L+1). The reduction 
associated with (2.25) results from the exclusion of all operations involving the 
zero values that are used for zero padding in (2.27). 
2.8 DECIMATION 
In many applications, there is a requirement to reduce the number of data, or 
consequently, the sampling rate by a factor of say, M, for example, to a new 
sampling rate of fs/M.  The obvious way to do this is to discard (M – 1) samples 
from successive groups of M samples, a process known as decimation or 
downsampling. However, this process could lead to aliasing of higher frequency 
signals down into the working frequency band. To counter this effect, 
downsampling is usually combined with the filtering operation. Decimation of the 
measurements by M results in the lowering of the Nyquist frequency to fs/2M and 
consequently a shift in the position of the normalized frequency components. 
Downsampling could also be carried out in either the time or frequency domain. 
In this section, a very brief description of the decimation process will be given, 
but for further details, refer to reference works such as [3,5].

between samples is now doubled. The sampling period is changed from ∆t to 2∆t, 
and the decimated signal starts and ends at (L/2)∆t and (N-L/2)∆t, respectively. If 
the data are zero-padded at the front and back with L zeros, the filter output would 
align itself with the original data. However, there will be end effects due to the 
Gibbs phenomenon.

2.8.1.1 Compact Half-Band Coefficients 
If the zero values were to be removed from the filter, we could represent the half-
band filter as a compact filter 
, of one half the length of the original low-pass 
filter. Using the symmetry property as before, this yields a reduction in coefficient 
count to one quarter of the original filter length to L/4+1 or [L/4]+2, depending on 
whether L/4 is an integer, or not, as in the latter. The brackets [a/b] are interpreted 
as the integer part when a is divided by b. This is the recommended approach for 
×2 time domain decimation using symmetric FIR filters. The filter 
 is obtained 
from the original half-band filter 
for two conditions of L/4, using:

which carries out the ×2 decimation in (2.31). Figures 2.24 and 2.25 present these 
two functions. Note that in the implementation, we zero-padded L+1 zeros at the 
beginning and end of the data set, so that there is no need to implement the shift 
operation, as has been done previously. However, the consequence of this is the

37 
imposition of the Gibbs phenomenon onto the filter result. In some instances these 
may be unacceptable, in which case the first and last L samples are discarded. 
It is worthwhile pointing out that Matlab uses the function decimate to 
implement downsampling rate changes with a range of input variables. As 
mentioned above, the functions given here are used for illustrative purposes, but 
would be useful to non-Matlab implementations, since they are relatively easy to 
convert to other languages. Figure 2.26 shows the results when compac and decx2 
are used to decimate an input signal. The original half-band filter is of length 55. 
The length of 
turns out to be 15; that is, L/4 is not an integer.

2.8.2 Half-Band Band-Pass Filter 
The band-pass (and band-stop) half-band filter characteristics are slightly different 
to those of the corresponding low-pass filter. In particular, the –6 dB bandwidth 
could take any reasonable size but the filter must be symmetric about 0.5fN. 
Moreover, alternate coefficients are zero-valued throughout the length of the filter. 
This is in contrast to low-pass filters that exhibit alternate zero-valued coefficients 
throughout the filter with the exception of the three coefficients at the center of the 
filter. For example, the central portion of a 55-point 0.2-width band-pass half-
band filter has coefficients  
 
… ,-36.3066, 0, 66.252, -92.116, 0, 102.4, 0, -92.116, 0, 66.252, 0, -36.3066, …. 
 
In this case, as in the low-pass half-band filter, there are two situations 
corresponding to whether L/4 is an integer or not. These lead to the following 
conditions for even filter order, L

where [a/b] means  the integer  part of a divided by b. It turns out that apart from 
(2.32), the implementation procedure for band-pass decimation by 2 is identical to 
its 
low-pass 
counterpart 
except 
for 
the 
statements, 
y(1:floor(N/2))= 
s(2*L+3:2:2*floor(N/2)+2*L+1) and P = 4*L+1 in decx2. In fact, to be able to use (2.31) 
for band-pass decimation, P must be replaced by 4Lh – 3. By implication, (2.32) 
discards every other filtered data point in the time series. Refer to Figure 2.25 for 
details. However, as a cautionary note, the user should ensure that no extraneous 
signals can alias into the pass band when using the half-band, band-pass 
downsampling by 2 filter.  
This process can be useful for filtering without decimation since only one 
quarter of the original filter coefficients is used. In this case, the function decx2 
provides two other input options for ordinary time domain low- and band pass 
filtering. Refer to listing in Figure 2.25 for details.

2.8.3 General Decimation by Factor M 
For general decimation by factor M, the rule is to use a low pass filter with 
normalized cut off less than or equal to 1/M. The procedure involves first filtering 
with the said filter then extracting (M – 1) samples in every group of M samples. 
The order of operation is important since the filtering process removes potential 
signals that would normally alias into the pass band if samples are openly 
discarded. 
In practice, it is commonplace to carry out the decimation process in smaller 
stages to achieve larger decimation rates. Thus to achieve a decimation of 10, say, 
it might be best to do this in two stages consisting of a ×2 followed by ×5 
decimation. Further details could be obtained, for example, from [5] and [6]. The 
algorithm could be implemented as shown in Figure 2.27. Although time domain 
filtering is used in this case, the frequency domain technique is equally useful in 
executing the filtering process. The filtering approach used by the signal 
processing engineer will often reflect the nature of the application.

2.9 INTERPOLATION 
2.9.1 Sampling Rate Increase by Integer Factor M 
Interpolation is used in situations where there is a need to increase the sampling 
rate of the system. This means that the number of data points is increased for the 
same time duration of the original data set. To accomplish an increase in data rate 
by an integer factor M, we first introduce M–1, consecutive zeros after every data 
point  in the original data set. This is followed by low-pass filtering with a cut-off

     yL/2+m = yL/2+m + hL/2 +1x L/2 + m  
end

no greater than 1/M. Finally, the filter output is gained up by factor M. The latter 
operation results in the interpolation of the values where the zeros have been 
placed. This simple approach could be implemented as shown in Figure 2.27. 
Moreover, if the interpolation factor is 2, then the compact half-band algorithm 
given in Section 2.8 could be used to implement the filtering operation.

Moreover, if the interpolation factor is 2, then the compact half-band algorithm

Note that for successful signal interpolation, the filter length should be at least 
ten times greater than the interpolation (or rate change) factor, M.  This allows the 
filter to effectively use existing data to introduce the sampling rate change. High-
frequency oscillations would be observed if the filter length is comparable to the 
rate change factor.

There are several functions in Matlab that implement one or another version

Figure 2.28, however interp1 and spline are also available. The function interpft 
implements interpolation via the FFT algorithm.

2.9.2 Sampling Rate Change by Factor P/ M  
In some applications, we are required to change the sampling rate by a fraction 
M/P. The best way to do this is to implement a rate change increase by M 
followed by decimation by P.  We recall that in decimation the filtering operation 
is carried out before removal of the unwanted samples, whereas in interpolation, 
the filtering is carried out after zero insertion. These two functions could be 
carried out in a single operation by choosing a low-pass filter with cut-off Fc such

In the next section we will give some general rules for governing the passage 
of white noise through FIR filters. This gives a fairly reasonable reference point 
even in circumstances where the noise is colored. 
2.10 NOISE CONSIDERATION 
In many situations, we are interested in estimating the extent of noise attenuation 
through an FIR filter. Noise attenuation is often expressed in terms of the input 
noise power 
, this being the variance of the input noise fluctuations. In this 
section, a brief review of the noise propagation through low-pass, high-pass, band-
pass, and band-stop filters will be given. Noise propagation through differentiating 
filters and Hilbert transformers will be presented in Chapters 6 and 7, respectively. 
Further details on noise propagation in various filter types can be obtained from

These results assume an ideal brick-wall type filter with zero transition width. 
However, in practice, there are deviations that can be linked to the shape of the 
filter in the frequency domain, and to the fact that at very low cut-off frequencies, 
such filters are constrained by the shape of the window [8]. Figure 2.30 shows the 
output noise power from a 33- and a 55-tap low-pass filter for successive cut-off 
frequencies. The input noise was taken from a CCD spectrometer. It is clear that 
apart from very low frequencies, (2.34) is good working model of noise 
attenuation through a low-pass filter. A similar observation could be made for 
white noise propagation through high pass filters as modeled by (2.35). The  gain

Note that if all the filters are identical, then the first term on the right-hand side 
will result in the same pass band but with absolute attenuation raised to the Mth 
power, or correspondingly, the original decibel attenuation of the filter scaled up 
by M. If the filters are different, the output noise power will depend on the profile 
of the resultant cascaded filter. High-order polynomial Butterworth filter models 
can be used to estimate the right-hand side of (2.39) for various combinations of 
filters [8]. Figure 2.31 shows the SNR gain for several filter types. Note that for 
differentiators, which will be presented in Chapter 6, there is a 0 dB crossover. 
When the SNR gain is negative, the input noise is amplified through the filter. 
Table 2.2 summarizes the noise output and SNR gain for common filter types.

by M. If the filters are different, the output noise power will depend on the profile 
of the resultant cascaded filter. High-order polynomial Butterworth filter models 
can be used to estimate the right-hand side of (2.39) for various combinations of 
filters [8]. Figure 2.31 shows the SNR gain for several filter types. Note that for 
differentiators, which will be presented in Chapter 6, there is a 0 dB crossover. 
When the SNR gain is negative, the input noise is amplified through the filter. 
Table 2.2 summarizes the noise output and SNR gain for common filter types.

This small change introduces an all-pass filter with magnitude 0.5% and 5%, 
respectively and appears as a smooth response profile across the Nyquist 
bandwidth. When the change is +5%, for example, the pass band exhibits a 5% 
gain across it. The opposite occurs when the change is negative. This will be used 
in Chapter 6 to correct second-order differentiators that exhibit unusual magnitude 
offsets in the pass band.

2.12 SUMMARY 
This chapter discussed the method used to design the filters that will be presented 
in the following chapters. All filters were designed using the Gaussian window. In 
particular, the design rules were presented along with the limitations of the 
technique. However, it was suggested that in most product development 
applications, especially where there is little time to weigh the benefits of several 
filter designs, the window technique proves useful. Moreover, it was felt that 
some basic implementation tools should also form part of the presentation. This 
was done by reviewing actual filter designs that focused on time and frequency 
domain implementations, as well as decimation, cascading, and interpolation, 
along with their algorithms. Noise was also considered where white noise 
propagation through the filter was used as a good working model. In Chapters 3 to 
5, the coefficients for low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filters, in addition to 
their general performance features, will be given in a data sheet format. 
Differentiators and Hilbert Transformers will be treated separately in Chapters 6 
and 7.

Low-Pass Filters 
This chapter presents the important features of 66 predesigned low-pass filters. 
These features are presented in a data sheet format, which we believe allows easy 
filter cross-referencing and assessment. In addition to the frequency and impulse 
response functions, a table of pertinent performance attributes is provided for each 
filter. These capture the characteristics of the predesigned digital filter in its 
entirety. Apart from the visual representation of the filters and their tabulated 
performance data, the filter coefficients are listed in electronic format and 
appended to this book. 
3.1 GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS 
There are aspects of the characteristics of the Gaussian-windowed FIR filter 
family that are of general interest. These characteristics show trends that allow the 
user to predict the attributes of other members of the filter family if required.  
3.1.1 
F-3dB Frequency and Filter Length 
In many filtering applications the –3dB frequency F-3dB has become a 
recognizable parameter for defining the cut-off frequency of low-pass filters. In 
digital filtering though, it is easier to define the cut-off frequency Fc, as the 
frequency at which the magnitude attains an absolute value of 0.5, since this is 
guaranteed by design. The consequence of using the F-3dB measure is that it varies 
with filter length since the sharpness of the transition width is a function of the 
filter order. Additionally, as the filter order increases, the transition width 
decreases, and F-3dB approaches Fc asymptotically. Because of this, there is a fairly 
predictable relationship between these two measures. As such, for historical 
reasons we have tabulated the F-3dB frequency in this book. Figure 3.1 shows the 
effect of filter order on the –3 dB frequency for various cut-off frequencies Fc, as 
well as the relationship between these two parameters. The response for L+1 = 99 
and 155 have been removed as they are almost coincident with length 255.

3.1.2 
Transition Width and Slope 
The transition width of the low-pass filter is the frequency range over which the 
response of the filter changes from 0 dB (linear scale value 1) to a chosen 
attenuation level, ±δ. Figure 3.2 shows the transition width.  From a design point 
of view such a definition is useful, but the transition width becomes slightly 
dependent  on  the  maximum  attenuation  in  the  rejection  band. Another option,

Figure 3.3  Effect of filter length on 90%-10% transition width ∆F. 
though less standard, is to use the width ∆F, defined as the bandwidth between the 
90% and 10% positions on the frequency response curve. This is smaller in value 
than the standard transition width measure (shown in Figure 3.2) but is less 
dependent on the attenuation levels in the rejection band. Moreover, this approach 
works in our case because the ripples in the pass and rejection bands are free 
parameters and are not actively used in the design of the filter. If the slope of the 
transition region µT is required, this is readily recovered from

In the rest of the book, transition width should be taken to mean ∆F, unless 
otherwise stated.  
The gross features of the 90%-10% transition width ∆F are shown in Figure 
3.3. It is seen that to realize a ∆F less than 0.01, more than 500 taps are needed. 
Given there is an inverse proportionality between the transition width ∆F and 
filter length, L+1, this relationship takes on the form

where for Gaussian-windowed filters (α = 3.5, and LD ~ 90% of L+1), a = 6.2368. 
This empirical result (3.2) is valid for 0.15 ≤ F ≤ 0.9, and has been used to design 
low-pass filters. Filter design rules are given in Chapter 2.  This result however 
suggests that the rate of increase in edge sharpness is fastest for small L, but gets 
progressively slower for larger L. Thus, there is no optimum filter length for a 
given set of design requirements.

3.1.3 
Rise Time τR 
The rise time τR of a low-pass filter is defined as the time between the 10% and 
90% values of the step response of the filter. This is shown in Figure 3.4, and is 
somewhat nonstandard from a design perspective, but is consistent with the type 
of measurements carried out in an R&D laboratory.  
There is an inverse relationship between the rise time τR and the cut-off 
frequency Fc. The general rise time characteristic of the filters presented in this 
chapter is shown in Figure 3.5. The open circles in the figure are for all filters 
except those of lengths L+1 = 33. The least squares fit of these results suggests a 
relationship of the form

where for Gaussian designs as described above, γ = 0.9168. In general, there is 
very little dependence of rise time on filter length, apart from filters of length 33. 
Moreover, there is no more than a 5% difference in rise times for filters whose 
lengths are between 55 and 255. The theoretical underpinnings of these 
observations, that is (3.2) and (3.3), can be traced to the type of window used, the 
transition width of the main lobe, and the fact that for higher cut-off frequencies 
the faster the filter response (see e.g. [1], pp 189-190 and [8], pp 549-559).  
3.1.4 
Pass-Band Ripple R and Attenuation A 
The pass-band ripple R is shown in Figure 3.2, and is defined as the maximum 
excursion of the filter response from unity in the pass-band. This is usually written 
as  
p

p
max,
δ

R
+
=
                                         (3.4)      
where δmax,p and δmin,p correspond to the maximum and minimum values of the 
response in the passband. Thus R is the largest absolute peak to peak swing in the 
passband. For the filters given, R is usually between 10−5 and 10−6 in absolute 
terms, or 20log10R in terms of decibels. For example, Table 3.3 uses the latter for 
coefficient bit size effects. 
The attenuation A in the rejection band is given by

=
A
(dB)                                       (3.5)  
where in this case, δmax,s is the largest peak in the stopband. Because the filter 
design treats the passband and attenuation ripples as free parameters, they do not 
show any significant correlation with transition width, cut-off frequency, or filter 
length. At the design stage, once the attenuation A has been chosen, the passband 
ripple R will automatically follow. This happens because the symmetry of the 
window means that the nature of the ripple seen in the passband is identical to that 
in the rejection band (i.e., δmax,s = R). Thus, the filters given here will exhibit 
similar ripple and attenuation magnitudes. A is typically in the range of –95 to      
–105 dB. 
3.1.5 
Overshoot Q 
The overshoot Q of a low-pass filter is the maximum excursion of the output from 
a unit input step function (see Figure 3.6). An awareness of the overshoot helps us 
to appreciate the influence of the Gibbs oscillatory phenomenon on small signals. 
Figure 3.7(a) shows the relationship between Q and filter length. Q shows its 
lowest values at F = 0.5 and 0.9 for filter lengths greater than or equal to 99.

Figure 3.6  Definition of overshoot Q and settling time τS for a low pass filter. 
3.1.6 
Settling Time 
The settling time τS is the time taken for the step response oscillation to settle to a 
value less than 5% of the maximum overshoot value, Q (Figure 3.6). The settling 
time exhibits a family of fairly well behaved curves when plotted against filter 
length. Its response against normalized frequency is less well defined. Figure 
3.7(b) shows the characteristics of the filters for step response overshoot and 
settling time. In general, there is a linear increase in settling time with filter length 
for low frequencies while showing a nonlinear course towards saturation for 
frequencies closer to the Nyquist frequency.

3.2 FILTER COEFFICIENT QUANTIZATION   
In filtering applications involving microprocessors there is a need to convert the 
filter coefficients into a suitable quantized form. This could be for 14-bit, 16-bit, 
or 24-bit word size, and in principle, could take any word size. The conversion of 
floating-point filter coefficients to lower precision, say 16-bit, generally leads to a 
loss of attenuation in the stopband and larger peak-to-peak ripple in the passband. 
Quantization also leads to an increase in the noise power levels as a result of the 
repeated use of the truncated coefficient values in arithmetic operations. Although 
instabilities do occur in some filter types, FIR filters are relatively immune to 
instabilities associated with quantization. The effect of word size on filter 
performance has been thoroughly studied (e.g., [1–5]) and the user is referred to 
these references for further details. 
3.2.1 
Integer Representation of Filter Coefficients 
In the integer representation of the filter, the coefficients are assigned a value 
between –2B–1 and 2B–1−1. For the filters given in the following pages, the 
conversion formula from floating-point (usually 32-bit) precision to B-bit word 
representation is

cut-off frequency of the filter. This formula gives the largest possible range of 
values that can be used to represent the filter without clipping of the output from 
high slew-rate input signals. Moreover, good signal-to-noise ratio is achieved. By 
incorporating the step response overshoot factor Q, and the cut-off frequency Fc, 
(3.6) gives us some headroom at the upper limit, 2B-1−1, for signal overshoot. In 
practice, Q reaches a maximum of about 10% (Figure 3.7(a)). It should be noted 
that this method assumes adequate mechanisms are in place to handle register 
overflow should this occur.

3.2.3 
Scaling 
The problem of register overflow can be managed successfully by scaling 
operations in three main areas, namely, (a) scaling the input signal; (b) scaling the 
filter coefficients and (c) managing the register size.  If the input signal is full 
scale i.e. 2B–1–1, and the largest filter coefficient also has value 2B–1–1, then the 
output value would require a register whose size is at least 2B bits wide after 
multiplication. One may use any scaling factor to pre-scale the input signal so that 
2B bit-wide registers are adequate. However, this may lead to a loss of 
information if the input signal features are smaller than the digitization level after 
scaling [7]. And moreover, whatever scaling factor is used, the same must be used 
to renormalize the filter output to achieve unity gain. Alternatively, the filter 
coefficients may be scaled (i.e., divided) by 2B–1 to realize a fixed-point fractional 
representation so that they range from –1 to (1 – 1/2B–1); 2’s complement fixed-
point arithmetic offers several advantages and is common in many applications. 
Third, the register width may be further increased from 2B to 2B + k bits where k 
is the smallest power of 2 which is greater than the filter gain (i.e., 2k ≥ G).  Once 
filtering is completed, the output must be rescaled (i.e., multiplied) by (1 – 
Q/100)Fc to achieve unity gain. 
Other forms of scaling using L1, L2, or L∞ norms have been proposed and are 
popular (see e.g., [1,6]). One of the best known scaling factors is given by

Here the filter coefficients 
B
k
h ,  are multiplied by λ to achieve suitable scaling. 
This technique, known as sum scaling, is the most stringent of scaling policies and 
is entirely overflow-proof when the input signal is in the range –1 to (1 – 1/2B–1). 
Note however, that this relation is so stringent that it often leads to a suboptimal 
signal-to-noise ratio for the filter. 
In general, no rule can be given for scaling as the filter implementation, 
nature of the input signal, and arithmetic usually dictate the method of scaling. It 
is worthwhile to note though that some form of scaling should be carried out with 
the factor G, used either as subfactors or as a single factor, if unity gain filtering is 
to be achieved.

An Example in Converting LPF99F0.3 to 16-Bit Precision 
As an example of the use of (3.6) we will convert the coefficients of a 99-point 
low-pass filter with Fc = 0.3 to 16-bit integers. In this case, B = 16, and the filter 
coefficients corresponding to LPF99F0.3 are used. The  overshoot Q from the Perfor-

mance Features table corresponding to this filter is 8.8%, however we will also try 
the case when Q is 0, and compare the results for Q at 8.8%.  
Table 3.1 shows the integer representation of the coefficients using (3.6) 
when Q = 0 and where only the first 50 coefficients are given. You will 
immediately notice that the filter length has been reduced from 99 to 97 because 
h1 = h99 = 0. This will usually have a negative impact on the performance 
characteristics of the filter. For lower word sizes the length may drop significantly 
with a corresponding loss in performance.  
Figure 3.8 (a) shows the frequency response characteristics of the filter when 
Q = 0 and 8.8%. There is approximately a 4-dB difference between the maximum 
attenuation values in these two cases; the Q = 0 implementation shows a lower 
peak attenuation of –84.6 dB, whereas the other is –80.3 dB. However, looking 
more closely at the responses, we see they are not too dissimilar across the 
Nyquist  spectrum.  Furthermore, there is a 20 dB loss in  attenuation  between the

floating-point filter realization and its 16-bit derivative. In spite of this, it is clear 
that phase linearity is maintained on quantization (Figure 3.8(c)). 
In most instances, the gain of signals can be readily scaled up or down prior 
to filtering and therefore the benefits of using Q = 0 is viewed in the context of 
whether this scaling would impair the filter output. Moreover, if the application 
does not involve large, high slew-rate signals then Q should be made zero. 
3.2.5 
Stop-Band Attenuation after Filter Quantization 
The upper bounds of the stop-band attenuation after quantization Aq could be 
predicted in terms of the bit precision B, by the following relation 
 
c
bB
aB
Aq
+
+
≤
2
                                            (3.9) 
 
where a, b, and c are constants. The formula gives the worst-case attenuation 
when any low-pass filter is converted from floating-point to B-bit precision, and Q 
= 0. In principle, the stop-band attenuation is slightly sensitive to frequency; 
however, we have used data corresponding to the poorest (minimum) attenuation 
observed over the frequency range (0.1 ≤ F ≤ 0.8) to determine the upper bounds. 
Figure 3.9(a) shows the minimum attenuation over the mentioned frequency range 
in terms of coefficient quantization word size B for filters of starting length L+1 = 
99. Table 3.2 gives the parameters a, b, and c for various starting filter lengths.

slightly sensitive to frequency, and like the attenuation Aq above, the worst-case 
observations have been used to determine the upper bounds. As such, almost all 
filters will show a lower peak-to-peak ripple for a given word size than the linear 
relationship suggested by (3.10). Figure 3.9 (b) shows a typical plot of the upper 
bound peak-to-peak ripple against bit size. Table 3.3 gives the parameters α and β 
for various filter starting lengths.

Filter Length after Quantization 
In the process of quantizing the filter, several coefficients may be rounded to zero 
at the starting or ending of the filter; these must be discarded. The effective filter 
length Lq is the minimum number of consecutive nonzero coefficients after 
quantization. In this case, however, the lower bound Lq has been determined to be

where p, q, and r are constants, and B is the bit size. Again, Lq is somewhat 
sensitive to frequency, as above and we have used only those observations which 
would give the smallest number of nonzero coefficients after quantization. Figure 
3.9(a) shows a typical response between effective filter length and bit size.  Table 
3.4 gives the values for a range of filter starting lengths.

3.3 ASPECTS OF FILTER COEFFICIENT FORMAT AND LAYOUT 
Some aspects pertaining to the layout of the filter in the following pages are given 
in this section. A description of the identifier, step response, and impulse response 
function is noted.  
3.3.1 
Identifier 
The identifier is the name given to the filter. The filter identifier is found at the top 
of the page and follows the format: 
 
LPFnnnFm.m 
 
LPF  
Low-pass filter 
nnn   
Number of filter coefficients (i.e., its filter length) 
F 
 
Normalized frequency 
m.m  
Cut-off frequency value 
 

 
Low-Pass Filters 
61 
For example, the identifier LPF99F0.3 means a low-pass filter of length 99 with 
normalized cut-off frequency at 0.3. The cut-off frequency of a digital filter is the 
frequency at which the magnitude of the frequency response is 0.5. Thus, in this 
example, the frequency response exhibits a value of 0.5 at F = 0.3. 
3.3.2 
Impulse Response 
The impulse response is given in the second graph (first row, second column). 
This shows a graph of the unnormalized filter coefficients or impulse response 
amplitude against index k. The index, k is very commonly used to represent the 
kth sample in time, but in general, could represent the kth sample in any 
measurement space.  
3.3.3 
Step Response 
The step response is the response of the filter to a step input function. This is 
shown in the third plot (second row, first column) with amplitude plotted against 
index k. Note that the step response is normalized, whereas the impulse response 
is not.  
3.3.4 
Pass-Band Ripple 
The pass-band ripple is shown in the last figure where the magnitude of the 
frequency response is usually magnified by a factor of 103. This gives the nature 
of the filter in the pass band.  
3.3.5 
Filter Coefficients Table 
The filter coefficients are listed for all low-pass filters except for those of lengths 
255 and 511; this has been done chiefly for space reasons. All filters are archived 
in the accompanying compact disc (CD) to full precision in ASCII format. 
The coefficients listed on each page are to 4 decimal places and are closely 
linked to 10-bit processing. In fact, the 10-bit quantized filter is easily created by 
rounding the full-precision filter coefficients as given, however; there will be a 
loss in filter order because many coefficients will be rounded to zero, with 
consequential losses in attenuation and pass-band characteristics as noted above. 
Note that application of the filter in any precision requires that the filtered result 
be normalized with K = 29 to avoid undue amplification of the output signal. 
Moreover, only the first L/2 + 1 coefficients are given as the filter is symmetric 
about the L/2 + 1 coefficient. Note further that ∆T in the performance table is the 
sampling period and fN is the Nyquist frequency (= fs/2). The square brackets [∆T, 
fN] in the units column of the performance features table mean the units of ∆T or 
fN.

3.4 CONVERSION OF LOW-PASS TO HIGH-PASS FILTERS 
In order to maximize the range of filters available in this offering, the normalized 
cut-on values for the high-pass filters given in the following chapter have been 
chosen to be different to the cut-off values for low pass filters. There is a simple 
relationship between the low-pass and high-pass filter, and this has been utilized 
to extend the range of filters presented. To convert these low-pass filters into high-
pass filters, the following is carried out: 
 
1. Change the sign of all coefficients. 
2. Add 512 to the value of the middle coefficient; that is, hL/2+1. If the 
coefficients are normalized, add 1 to the said coefficient. 
3.5 LISTING OF LOW-PASS FILTERS 
Table 3.5 gives a list of low-pass filters presented in the following pages. The 
filters are listed in increasing order of frequency and filter length.

High-Pass Filters 
This chapter gives the filter coefficients and characteristics of a selection of high-
pass filters that are available in this offering. It is identical in format to those given 
in the last chapter on low-pass filters with some exceptions that are highlighted 
below. 
4.1 FILTER TERMINOLOGY 
4.1.1 
Step Response in High-Pass Filters 
The parameters given in the Performance Features table have the same meaning as 
before. However, note that since high-pass filters do not support the DC 
component in a given signal, the step response returns to zero after some 
oscillations. Moreover, the step response is with reference to unit step input, and 
as such the overshoot Q is given as a percentage of the input. For example, if a 2V 
step input is fed into the filter HPF99F0.175, the output peak response would attain 
±41% of 2V = ±0.82V before settling down to less than ± 41mV (i.e., 5% of 
0.82V) in 12 sampling periods. Note too that there is no rise time τR in 
comparison to its low-pass counterpart since there is no apparent step on the 
output. Figure 4.1 shows the relationship between the overshoot Q and settling 
time τS for the high pass filter.

the nearest integer to x, and Fc is the normalized cut-on frequency. Note that (4.1) 
does not include the overshoot Q, since it plays no part in determining the extent 
to which the filter output overshoots the maximum integer value 2B–1 when the 
step input involves the said value.

This is the amount by which the input signal will be amplified on the filter output. 
4.1.4 
Choice of Cut-on Frequencies Fc 
The choice of cut-on frequencies Fc for the filters presented here was dictated by 
the additional range of low-pass filters that it affords the user.  All the filters 
presented in this chapter can be converted to low-pass filters thereby extending the 
range given in Chapter 3. The conversion formula from high-pass to low-pass is

4.2 LISTING OF HIGH-PASS FILTERS 
Table 4.1 gives an overview of high-pass filters presented here. In general, the 
characteristics exhibited by their low-pass counterparts, such as transition width

versus filter length trends, are also evident in these filters and are therefore not 
discussed any further. Refer to Chapter 3 for details.

Chapter 5 
Band-Pass Filters 
The band-pass filters provided herein have been put into four groups, namely 
those with normalized bandwidths of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3. Given the large filter 
orders required to achieve a relatively narrow edge transition, filter lengths 
corresponding to L+1 = 33 and 55 have been left out of many groups for practical 
reasons.  
5.1 FILTER TERMINOLOGY 
5.1.1 
Identifiers 
The identifiers found at the top of the page take on a slightly different format in 
comparison to previous listings. In this case, it is given by 
 
BPFnnCm.mWp.p 
 
where BPF stands for band pass filter, nn represents the length of the filter, C 
stands for center frequency, m.m is its value, W stands for filter width measured at 
the cut-on and cut-off –6 dB points, and p.p the value of the width. So for 
example, BPF255C0.35W0.2 is the name of a 255-tap, band-pass filter, whose 
normalized center frequency is 0.35 and whose width at half height is 0.2 
(normalized frequency units). Note that all band pass filters designed as discussed 
in Chapter 2 are symmetric about the center frequency with identical edge 
transition widths. Moreover, the –6 dB width W is guaranteed in each filter. The 
normalized bandwidth W is easily converted to its corresponding working 
frequency w (Hz) by multiplying the former with the Nyquist frequency (Hz). 
5.1.2 
Band-Pass Filter Quantization 
For the band-pass filters given in the following pages, the conversion formula 
from floating-point precision to B-bit word representation is

and is the amount by which the input signal will be amplified on the filter output. 
5.1.4 
General Characteristics 
Some of the general filter characteristics have been alluded to in our discussion on 
low-pass filters. Like low-pass and high-pass filters, the bandwidth W for band-
pass filters is well defined as the normalized width at 0.5 (i.e. the –6 dB level). As 
Figure 5.1(a) shows for a given width W, the edge transitions of all band-pass 
filters cross at the –6 dB level, thereby guaranteeing this parameter.

The bandwidth ∆F-3dB, at the –3 dB level (i.e. amplitude of 0.71) depends on the 
filter order L. An increase in filter order means an increase in ∆F-3dB; however the 
rate of increase with respect to filter order decreases progressively leading to 
saturation for large L. This aspect is best captured by plotting 1/(W - ∆F-3dB) 
against filter length L+1, which is linear with a slope of 0.396 (see Figure 5.1(b)). 
5.1.5 
Conversion to Band-Stop Filters  
Every band-pass filter presented here can be converted into a band-stop (reject) 
filter with the pass-band becoming the stop-band. The following formula is used 
to convert band-pass into band-stop filters

Overview of Band-Pass Filter Coefficients 
Table 5.1 gives a listing of the band-pass filters available in this offering. They 
have been divided into groups with bandwidths of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3.  The 
filters are presented in increasing order of filter length but decreasing order of 
filter bandwidth in a similar manner to Table 5.1.

The ideal differentiator 
 is characterized by a linear transfer function in the 
frequency domain, and like all FIR filters, can be designed with either even or odd 
filter order. Its magnitude |

                                          (6.1) 
 
where F is the normalized frequency. It is clear from (6.1) that unlike non-
differentiating digital filters, the magnitude of the differentiator increases linearly 
in frequency, suggesting some form of amplification across its passband. When 
the input signal to the ideal differentiator is noiseless, it becomes apparent that the 
digital differentiator performs perfect differentiation. However, if white noise is 
added to the signal, the high-frequency components of the noise are nonlinearly 
amplified across the Nyquist range leading to gross distortion of the differentiated 
output. As such, full band differentiators are inherently noisy. To illustrate this 
point, Figure 6.1 shows the derivative of a signal without and with a small amount 
of added noise. Although the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the input signal is 
relatively high, the SNR of the output is markedly poor.  
Some effort has been expended in developing digital differentiators that avoid 
or reduce the deleterious effects of the non-linear amplification process. For 
example, based on white noise assumptions, Vanio and colleagues [1] optimized 
the differentiator by minimizing the output noise power, while Tseng and Lee [2] 
optimized theirs with respect to the signal-to-noise ratio of the process. Carlsson 
et al [7][3] on the other hand, developed a scheme for minimizing the said effects 
when colored noise is present.  
The technique we will use to minimize differentiator noise amplification 
assumes white noise contamination of the signal and combines low-pass filter 
characteristics  with  that  of  the differentiator. The  low-pass filter inherent in the

differentiator is designed to reject out-of-band noise thereby reducing the said 
adverse effects. The technique is not new but is perhaps the simplest approach as 
it could be designed using the window method. Moreover, given the cut-off 
frequency or bandwidth of a differentiating filter, it is possible to predict the noise 
amplification factor of the filter [4]. In fact, a foremost consideration in the choice 
of a differentiator is its noise amplification.  
Terminology 
The term differentiating filter will be used to describe a differentiator with low-
pass or band-pass characteristics as well as full-band differentiators. Furthermore, 
the term unity-gain  filter will be used to mean a filter in which the pass-band gain 
in the frequency domain is unity. Thus low-pass, band-pass, and high-pass filters 
would fall into this category. The term digital filter or filter will be used in the 
generic sense to mean the class of all filters possessing first, second, or mth 
derivative functions, unity-gain filters, integrators, and Hilbert transformers. 
These distinctions often arise when comparisons need to be made between a 
differentiator and its nondifferentiating counterpart. On the other hand, in the 
interest of mathematical clarity, the kth value of the mth order differentiating filter 
coefficient will therefore be denoted by

Second order differentiating filters will also be described and presented. 
Additionally, aspects of their application and gross performance features will be 
provided. 
6.2 FILTER CLASSIFICATION 
Digital differentiators are usually placed in one of four categories, namely, Types 
I, II, III, and IV (e.g., [5]). For reasons of consistency with the rest of the book, we 
opted to design and present only Type III differentiators. A differentiator is 
classified as Type III if it has an odd number of antisymmetric coefficients, and its 
magnitude response |
| is zero at both F = 0 and 1. However, note that the 
Type IV differentiator comes closest to the ideal differentiator because its 
magnitude response is zero at F = 0 and π at F = 1. Figure 6.2 shows typical 
Types III and IV differentiator response characteristics. 
D
Several classic methods can be used to realize a particular set of Type III 
differentiator coefficients. The technique used by Kumar and Dutta Roy [6] and 
Carlsson [7] is rather useful since the coefficients are recursively generated. This 
is similar to the maximally flat recursive approach of Khan and others [8,9]. The 
latter method of Khan and colleagues is principally a Type IV, but could be useful 
in noiseless data applications.  The least squares method of coefficient generation 
(e.g., [12]) is also useful when pass-band requirements are less restrictive but edge 
transition sharpness is important. The optimal design method of McClellan and 
Parks [10], also a least squares technique, produces differentiator coefficients

Digital Filter Design Solutions 
whose characteristics are the best against the performance requirements supplied 
to the algorithm.  
The Window technique is the simplest, but very little control is achieved over 
the filter design; there is usually a trade-off between transition width and filter 
length. Pass-band errors for the window technique are often small in comparison 
to other techniques. Moreover, the technique is particularly useful for 
instrumentation prototyping when quick demonstration of an operational principle 
is necessary. The filter design process often gravitates towards one with stringent 
filtering requirements as product performance limitations are understood and 
matched against performance goals. 
The window technique has been used to design the first-order differentiators 
presented in this chapter. In the case of second-order differentiators, these have 
been designed using both the former technique and a new algorithm based on the 
conversion of unity-gain filters (UGF). Although there is no strict requirement on 
the type of UGF coefficients to use apart from the fact that they must be stable, we 
have restricted the design of second-order differentiators to those derived from 
Gaussian windowed filter coefficients. 
6.3 FIRST-ORDER DIFFERENTIATING FILTERS 
In this section, a brief description of the design of first-order differentiators will be 
given. The discussion will be limited to the filters designed using the window 
technique. Some emphasis will be given to the practical aspects of the 
implementation of these filters.

where Fc indicates the low-pass cut-off of the differentiator, and Wk is the 
Gaussian weighting factor. The coefficients in (6.2) may be normalized by 
dividing by K = 29. Equation (6.2) above has been condensed into a few steps 
where, in comparison to unity-gain filters, N/2 has been replaced by L/2 to reflect 
the truncation process. In principle, the design process is identical to the design of 

 
Differentiators 
313 
unity-gain filters where subscript k was previously allowed to take on values, say 
between 1 and N, (which was 1024) then windowed and truncated to length L+1. 
Note that the center coefficient (i.e., the (L/2+1)th value), is zero when L is even. 
Moreover, since this is a Type III system, the coefficients are antisymmetric; that 
is,                          for                        and of odd length. This antisymmetry means 
that there is only a slight change in sign in the implementation involving the 
standard time domain filtering process, and as such only the first half of the 
coefficients are recorded in the tables that follow.

where K = 29 is a normalizing factor for our approach and m = 1 for the first 
derivative. The start position of the differentiated result is similar to that of unity 
gain filters for reasons discussed earlier in Chapter 2. Figure 6.3 describes an 
algorithm that implements this differentiation operation. The user is reminded of 
the antisymmetry if using coefficient values directly from the tables, or when 
using alternative implementations for the said filters. Filtering can also be carried 
out in the frequency domain as discussed in Chapter 2.

c. This forms the frequency response of the differentiator. It has become 
customary in using differentiating filters to plot the FFT magnitude divided by π 
against normalized frequency F.  Figure 6.4 (a) shows a 99-tap first-order 
differentiating filter with cut-off at 0.35 (DIFF99F0.35); while this gives us some 
quick information about the transition width, there is little information about the 
attenuation beyond 0.35. The attenuation information is recovered when 
20log(magnitude/π) is plotted against log F (Figure 6.4 (b)); however, the 
transition width is somewhat lost. As shown in Figure 6.4 (b), one must add 
9.94dB (i.e., 20log π) to the maximum attenuation to compensate for normalizing 
by π. This way of presenting the information allows for a clearer appreciation of 
filter performance at low frequencies. In spite of this, we opted to present first-
order differentiators as shown in (a), recognizing that additional information 
would need to be gathered from the accompanying table.  
It is worth noting that the maximum attenuation A, given in the tables 
associated with the differentiator, was calculated relative to the ideal differentiator

where R is evaluated between F = 0 and the last zero-crossing of R(F). In Figure 
6.5 (a), the peak-to-peak value R is 5.1x10–6, which must be multiplied by π to 
give the true error R = 1.6×10–5.  This calculation has already been done and given 
in the performance features table. Additionally, Figure 6.5 (a) gives a quick idea 
of the working range of the differentiator, which turns out to be F ≤ 0.25. 
However, since the errors are of the order of 10–5, and in some applications larger 
errors may be acceptable, the frequency at 0.001π error F003 has also been 
provided. This gives additional latitude in the use of the differentiator. In this case, 
F003 is 0.28, giving a modest increase of 0.03. Figure 6.5 (b) shows the output of

Thus, any unit step change in slope will yield an output similar to that shown in 
Figure 6.5 (b), and described by (6.7). The rise time, settling time, and overshoot 
have been tabulated.  
6.3.5 
DC Accuracy  
The dc accuracy ε of a first-order differentiator in the time domain is the 
difference between the ideal settling value of unity, and the actual settling value of 
the slope response function, UL+1. Thus, we have

For most differentiators, ε is a few parts in 104 (typically 0.03%) for standard 
floating-point precision coefficients. Furthermore, the dc accuracy was further 
investigated when 104 samples of the unit slope function are offered to the 
differentiator. For floating-point precision, first order differentiators show no 
appreciable error. However, in passing, the dc accuracy is usually sensitive for 
second-order differentiator operations and could display significant inaccuracies 
over long steady slopes. This will be discussed later. Note also that the ac 
accuracy of the differentiator is characterized by the pass-band ripple R(F).

respectively. Other classes of filters such as high-pass and band-stop 
differentiators can be designed in a similar manner to unity-gain filters. 
6.3.7 
Quantization of Low-Pass Filter Differentiator Coefficients 
The quantization of differentiator coefficients is slightly more involved that its 
unity-gain counterpart. Previously, we used the peak value attained by the impulse

corresponding integer values, so that the filter occupies full bit range capability of 
the processor. Applying a scaling factor in this way gives the best possible 
chances of maintaining the differentiating filter characteristics after quantization.

6.4 SECOND-ORDER DIFFERENTIATING FILTERS 
The ideal second-order differentiator D2(F) is proportional to (πF)2. There are 
several techniques for the design of higher-order differentiators, such as [14,15]. 
In this work, we will concentrate on the window technique with some minor 
modifications  to the coefficients.  The  approach is simple but problematic. As we

will see, the frequency response of the second-order differentiator exhibits a dc 
offset as well as a mismatch between the attenuation and zero positions.  
The coefficients of the second-order differentiator are found by taking the 
second derivative of the impulse response function of the unity-gain low-pass 
filter with respect to k. Alternatively, we can take the first derivative of the first 
order impulse response function. The second-order coefficients are therefore given

Unfortunately, this result leads to distortions in the response of the differentiating

2.11. The second distortion appears to be a mismatch between the response at dc, 
and that across the attenuation band. However, this second distortion cannot be 
removed by simple techniques. In principle, if a differentiator is to exhibit both 
frequency-based dc accuracy and good attenuation, then the magnitude in the 
attenuation band should not be less than the dc offset as happens in these

responses. To illustrate these effects, Figure 6.7 (a) shows the frequency response 
of a 55-tap differentiator for Fc = 0.3, using (6.14). In Figure 6.7 (b), the dc offset 
in the frequency domain has been corrected, using the procedure described in 
Section 2.11, so that the filter is dc accurate (i.e., D2(F) = 0 at F = 0). Once the dc 
accuracy has been restored, there is usually very good correlation between the 
design and the ideal second-order differentiator. However, because of the 
mismatch problem, the filter response in the rejection band is reflected in the x-
axis, showing poor attenuation in the passband (typically 50 dB).  
The consequence of the dc correction is a slight shift in the ripple function 
R(F) across the pass-band and appears asymmetric about zero error. This shift 
ensures that the error is zero at dc. Moreover, the peak-to-peak error is still of the 
order of 10-5. In general, the second-order differentiator designed in this way is 
both ac and dc accurate. However, it displays rather poor attenuation. Figure 6.8 
(a) shows the shift in pass-band error while (b) shows the corrected impulse 
response. Because of the attenuation problem, another second-order differentiator 
design has been provided. This will be discussed in Section 6.6. 
6.4.1 
Second-Order Slope Response and Stability  
The second order slope response of a differentiator is its response to the function 
x2/2, where ideally, its second derivative is unity. In fact, this concept could be 
extended to the mth order response via the input slope function xm/m!. In principle, 
the mth order slope response is similar in nature to the step response Uk in unity 
gain  filters.  The   approach  is  useful  because  it  allows  us  to compare  various

differentiators, manage overshoot, and have an appreciation for the dc accuracy 
and dynamic properties of the filter as well. It has been observed that second-order 
differentiators tend to be more sensitive to coefficient quantization than other 
filters. Whereas the frequency response may show excellent qualities, its 
performance as a differentiator may be quite different when the precision is 
relatively low. This phenomenon is illustrated in Figure 6.9, where 20-, 22-, and 
24-bit precision filter coefficients were used on 5,000 integer samples of the 
second-order input slope function. It is apparent that 20- and 22-bit precision 
exhibit a divergence from its target of unity. In practical terms, the filter would 
produce a derivative that drifts off into error when presented with a slowly 
curving signal over a few thousand samples.  
The reason for this instability is believed to be the magnification of the 
coefficient error by the large difference in data values presented between the first 
and last coefficients of the filter. Given a relatively long filter, as we have here, 
this difference could be significant for input slope functions and is expected to get 
worse for single-stage higher-order differentiators during dc processing. This 
analysis would suggest that the minimum word size for second-order 
differentiators working at dc should be 24 bits, the latter corresponding to a 
precision of 5×10−8. Moreover, we note that the step response is well behaved up 
to about 200 samples, before falling away sharply. This behavior could have been 
missed in a superficial examination of the slope response, and as such, it is 
advisable to test the filter before use. Additionally, it is useful to point out that the 
dc accuracy ε in the time domain is usually within ± 1% for typical 32-bit

floating-point processing. In general, this approach appears to be a reasonable test 
of performance for higher-order differentiators. If higher accuracy is required, it 
might be necessary to run a first-order differentiator twice over the data. 
6.4.2 
Quantization of Filter Coefficients and Implementation 
The quantization of second-order coefficients is dependent on the peak value 
attained by the impulse response function of the differentiator. In this case, the 
global maximum occurs at the origin. Thus, for second-order differentiating 
filters, the conversion formula from full precision to B-bit word size is

the input signal. 
6.5 NOISE CONSIDERATION 
6.5.1 
The Noise Amplification Factor  
The performance of filters in the presence of noise is an important consideration 
in digital signal processing.  In fact, the choice of cut-off frequencies for the 
differentiators presented in this work was determined solely on the nature of their 
noise attenuation characteristics. It was shown recently [4] that the output noise 
variance (power) σ  of an mth order differentiator is

The noise amplification factor is the amount by which the input noise power is 
amplified on the output of the filter. Thus for first-order differentiators (m = 1), 
the noise amplification factor becomes η = 3.29
. It is not difficult to see that η 
= 1 when F

c

c = 0.672. This is the highest normalized cut-off frequency a first-order 
differentiator could have without exhibiting noise amplification.  As such, most of 
the differentiating filters have been designed with a cut-off less than 0.67. 
Differentiation outside this bandwidth is accomplished using band-pass 
differentiators, which is also aimed at managing the output amplification process. 
Figure 6.10 shows experimental verification of (6.17) for a 55-point 
differentiating filter using various cut-off frequencies Fc.  The upper bound 
predicted by (6.17) is also plotted on the same figure for comparison. 
Choice of a particular differentiator is governed mainly by the bandwidth of 
the signal, the extent of noise amplification acceptable, and the matching band-
pass error of the filter. For example, the differentiator DIFF99F0.35 has a working 
bandwidth  of  0.25 when  the  pass-band  error is  of the  order of  10-5, or 0.28 for

pass-band error 0.003 (see Figure 6.4). The amplification factor is 0.141, or 14% 
of the input noise passes through the filter. As such, the input signal bandwidth 
into this filter should be no more than 0.28, if 0.003 error is acceptable, otherwise 
it should be 0.25. In the case of noiseless data, full-band differentiators could be 
used for signal frequencies up to the Nyquist frequency. Full-band differentiators 
have been provided for this purpose. 
6.5.2 
Noise Amplification in Band-Pass Differentiators  
Noise amplification in band-pass differentiators is found by calculating the 
difference in output noise power between the low-pass differentiator at Fc,off and 
that at Fc,on. Thus for mth-order band-pass differentiating filters

with the filter identifier (see Section 6.7.1). 
6.5.3 
Signal-to-Noise Ratio 
The fact that we can manipulate the noise amplification on a differentiator means 
there is some control over the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the filtered signal. 
Given a signal of strength S with rms noise σε, then its SNR is S/σε. If after 
filtering, the output noise is changed to σy, then the change in SNR is σε/σy.  
Furthermore, if σy is less than σε there will be an increase in SNR. This result 
assumes that the noise is white. In general, the change in SNR, GSNR from (6.17)

6.5.4 
General Performance in Noise 
The performance of band-limited differentiators in white noise has been 
investigated previously [4].  Figure 6.11 (a) shows part of a simulated spectrum of 
a white light interferometer to which noise was added. The noisy spectrum was 
differentiated first by a Type IV full-band differentiator and then a 55-point band- 
limited differentiator (Fc = 0.15). The noise-free spectrum was differentiated by 
the band-limited differentiator only. Figure 6.11 (b) shows a typical differentiating 
filter output in the presence of noise. The noise amplification factor η for the 
band-limited differentiator in this case is 0.01 (i.e., 1%) with an estimated increase 
in SNR of 40 dB. The extent of noise attenuation is clearly seen and apart from 
small discrepancies at the turning points, there is good general agreement with the 
noise-free derivative. In the next section, we will look at ways of producing first- 
and second-order differentiators from unity gain filters. This could be useful when 
time is a constraint.

6.6 CONVERSION OF UNITY GAIN FILTERS INTO 
DIFFERENTIATORS 
6.6.1 
First-Order Differentiating Filters 
The conversion of unity gain filters into differentiators is a quick and simple way 
of realizing low-pass differentiators. Given a low-pass unity-gain filter h for 
example, of length L+1, the corresponding first-order differentiator d(1) is given by

If the filter length L+1 of h is odd, then the differentiator d will be of even length 
and one shorter than its progenitor; that is, a new length of L. On the other hand, if 
the length of the unity gain filter is even, then the corresponding differentiator will 
be odd and one shorter than the filter. This approach is useful for fast generation 
of first-order low-pass differentiating filters up to Fc ≈ 0.15, showing no Gibbs 
ringing in the pass-band error R(F), good dc accuracy, and linear in phase if h is a 
linear-phase filter. However, for increasing Fc, it exhibits increasingly poorer ac 
accuracy than standard techniques across the differentiator passband. This has a 
straightforward explanation. 
In terms of the of the Z-transform, (6.23) could be written as

where H(F) and D(F) are the frequency responses of the unity gain low-pass filter 
and corresponding first-order differentiator, respectively. The result shows that 
(6.24) is the convolution of the sine approximation of a first-order differentiator 
and a low-pass filter. This explains why the pass-band of the new differentiator is 
modified by the envelope function 2sin(πF/2) and the ac error increases with 
frequency. Figure 6.12 shows the ideal full-band differentiator, the term in 
(2/π)sin(πF/2), and two low-pass differentiating filters with cut-off at 0.2 and 0.5 
determined from (6.23). Note that the magnitude of both differentiating filters 
follows the sine term, which results in large inaccuracies for relatively large cut-
off   frequencies.  As  such, it  is   recommended  that  the  said  differentiators  be

designed with bandwidths no larger than 0.15. In principle, they are maximally 
smooth and accurate only at dc. In this context, the realization of band-pass 
differentiators outside this region should also be avoided.  
The technique is similar in some respect to that developed by Kumar and 
Dutta Roy [6], Kumar et al [16], and Carlsson [7], with the exception that this 
approach could realize arbitrary low-pass filter characteristics. Because of the 
simplicity of the approach, we have not archived low-pass differentiators based on 
this method. With regard to pass-band errors, corrections could be made using 
methods similar to that described in [13].

Second-Order Differentiating Filters 
Second-order differentiators are more involved than their first-order forerunners, 
but they are still manageable. For second-order differentiators, a similar difference

their first-order counterparts.  Figure 6.13 shows two filters derived from unity 
gain low-pass filters with cut-off at 0.4 and 0.75. We note immediately that they 
overpredict the ideal second-order frequency response in comparison to that found 
for first-order differentiators. However, the acceptable bandwidth now extends to 
about 0.4 for the filters derived from (6.26).  
Whereas second-order differentiating filters designed using Fourier 
coefficients tend to show poor attenuation coefficients, the second order 
differentiators designed using this simple technique tend to imitate the attenuation 
characteristics of the seed filter, and furthermore show good dc performance. As 
such, this gives us a choice of second-order differentiators: (a) converted unity 
gain filters with excellent dc and attenuation characteristics, but relatively large ac 
error, and (b) window derived differentiators with excellent ac characteristics but 
poor attenuation. Both differentiator types have been archived in this work. A 
comparison of general filter properties is given in Table 6.1. A Matlab [17] 
function that performs the said conversion has been provided in Figure 6.14.

The layout of the differentiators presented in the rest of the chapter is perhaps best 
depicted as shown in Figure 6.15. It is worthwhile to note that (1) only low-pass 
second-order differentiators are given, and (2) second-order differentiators are 
divided into Types a and b. Type a differentiators are those designed by 
converting  unity  gain   filters  as  in   Section 6.6,   whereas  Type b   filters  were

designed using the Gaussian window technique described in Section 6.4. The seed 
filters for the Type a differentiators were the standard low-pass filters again 
derived from the window technique.  In that regard, second order differentiators 
display many properties as their parent filter. 
6.7.1 
Filter Identifier 
The filter identifier is the name given to the differentiating filter. The 
differentiator identifier is found at the top of the page and follows the format for 
unity gain filters: 
 
DIFFnnnFm.m 
 
DIFF  
First-Order Differentiator 
nnn   
Number of filter coefficients (i.e., filter length) 
F 
 
Normalized frequency 
m.m  
Cut-off frequency value 
 
For example, the identifier DIFF99F0.3 means a differentiating filter of length 99 
with normalized cut-off frequency at 0.3. Here, first-order differentiators were 
designed exclusively using the window (Fourier) technique. Band-pass 
differentiators have the following identifier structure:  
 
DIFFnnnCm.mWp.p 
 
DIFF  
First-Order Differentiator 
nnn   
Number of filter coefficients (i.e., filter length) 
C 
 
Center frequency of band 
m.m  
Center  frequency value with respect to width 
W 
 
Width of band measured at half height 
m.m  
Width value 
 
Thus for example, the identifier DIFF255C0.65W0.1 corresponds to a 255-tap, 0.1-
wide, band-pass differentiator with center frequency at 0.65. Note that the width 
and center values are in normalized frequency units. For second-order 
differentiators the following format is used:

6.7.2 
Filter Coefficients Table 
The filter coefficients are listed for all differentiators except for those of lengths 
255 and 511; this has been done chiefly for space reasons. All filters are archived 
in the accompanying CD to full precision in comma separated variable (CSV) 
format. The coefficients have all been multiplied by 29, and should be 
renormalized by this value when used in full-precision filtering. 
 
6.8 OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY 
The main driver for designing band-limited differentiators has been the 
management of noise amplification. Not much emphasis has been placed on edge 
transition width or on attenuation in the rejection band, although first-order 
differentiators are typically –100 dB. In this regard, two options have been given 
for second-order differentiators, in particular, Types a and b. These have been 
summarized  in Table 6.1. 
An overview of all first- and second-order differentiators designed and 
presented in this chapter is given in Table 6.2.  A total of 53 differentiators is 
provided consisting of 25 first-order, 8 band-pass, and 20 second-order filters. 
They have been designed with the widest range of applications and conditions in 
mind; however there may be situations when these filters will no longer be 
applicable. In such cases, the user may need to find alternative differentiator 
solutions.

Hilbert Transformers 
7.1 INTRODUCTION 
The Hilbert transform is a relatively well-known technique to convert a real signal 
into its analytic form [1,2]. An analytic signal is a signal whose imaginary part is 
the Hilbert transform of the real part. Thus given a real signal st sampled at time t, 
the analytic signal St is

where H{x} is the Hilbert transform of  x, and j is the complex term 
1
−. The 
Hilbert transform therefore imparts a π/2 phase shift to a real signal to make it 
analytic. The fact that we can create an orthogonal signal from an existing set of 
measurements means that it is possible to extract the frequency and phase 
information carried by the original signal. It is this property that is exploited in 
many phase and frequency demodulation applications in communications. To see 
this, we convert (7.1) into polar coordinates, assuming the signal st has angular 
frequency ω and phase ϕt at time t, and write

Thus, the amplitude and phase are readily recovered from a working knowledge of 
the Hilbert transform of a signal. Note that ϕt may itself be a function of time 
producing a wide range of spectral components. It is also useful to treat the rate of 
change of phase as an instantaneous frequency; this aspect will be discussed later.

Digital Filter Design Solutions 
The goal of such demodulation schemes is to determine either the frequency 
component ω or the time-dependent phase ϕt.  If the phase is required and the 
frequency is a carrier only of such information, then we would need a reference 
signal with identical frequency but uncorrupted phase information. The latter 
signal usually drives the whole frequency modulation (FM) process forward and, 
as is often the case in electrical or optical communications, forms part of the 
transmission system [4]. The aim of this chapter is to present the digital Hilbert 
transform within the context of digital demodulation, emphasizing typical errors 
inherent in utilizing the transform. Two techniques will be described.      
Terminology 
The terms Hilbert transforming filter or Hilbert transformer will be used to 
describe the said filter. In general, we treat these as one type of unity gain filter. 
7.2 HILBERT TRANSFORM REALIZATION 
The digital Hilbert transformer can be realized either as a finite impulse response 
(FIR) or infinite impulse response (IIR) system. We have chosen the FIR 
approach for its stability, phase linearity, and general simplicity. Furthermore, we 
will use the window technique, utilizing the Gaussian window for this purpose. 
One major reason for this approach is that in some applications involving the 
Hilbert transforming filter, it is useful to ensure that all filters are compatible in 
terms of their pass-band ripple, phase, and attenuation. The noncausal digital 
Hilbert transformer g in the time domain has the following form [1]

where L is the order of the filter, and is even for the implementation given in this 
chapter; K = 29 in the said filters. As such, all Hilbert transforming filters given 
here are odd in length. The Gaussian window function Wk has been given in 
Chapter 2. Figure 7.1 shows a 99-point Hilbert filter and its frequency response 
for Fc = 0.5. Interestingly, this is a half-band filter but could only be used to 
reduce the coefficient count by 25% since every fourth coefficient is zero. 
The Hilbert transformer in (7.3) is linear in phase; however, it is offset by 
−90o. Thus, over the bandwidth of the filter the phase changes, and in principle 
should be compensated for in the original real part of the signal by a filter of 
similar length and phase response.  In fact, the phase response θ(F) for the Hilbert 
filter in (7.3) is given for filter order L and normalized frequency F by

7.3 PHASE-FREQUENCY DEMODULATION SCHEME 1 
In this section we will review a frequency demodulation scheme employing the 
Hilbert transform. We mentioned earlier that a second reference signal is needed 
to recover the phase ϕt; we will show how this is employed. For all practical 
purposes, this process will also demodulate FM signals as well as phase 
modulated (PM) signals. Figure 7.2 shows the schematic of the first demodulation 
process.  The input real signal and its reference are all low-pass filtered and 
Hilbert transformed, then multiplied and summed to give the in-phase I and 
quadrature Q components. To see how this is achieved, let the initial signal and its 
reference be st and ct, and their Hilbert transforms       and,     , respectively. This 
creates two analytical signals St and Ct, which are then multiplied to form the 
demodulated signal Dt. This could be written as

The complex phase ϕt in (7.5) is the angle traced out in time between the in-phase 
component I and its quadrature Q. Clearly, the time-dependent demodulated phase 
is

It is worth pointing out that the use of ct and its transform is usually not necessary, 
since sine and cosine functions could be used instead. However, to avoid the 
introduction of an arbitrary phase lag between filtered and unfiltered signal 
components the above procedure is advisable. The drawback with this approach is 
that the processing may become intensive, but if our aim is to track absolute phase 
changes, then the extra processing may be justified. This aspect will be taken up 
further in the next section. Moreover, the reasons for using the low-pass filter will 
become evident as we look at the implementation and error propagation model. 
7.3.1 
Implementation  
The implementation of the Hilbert transformer is almost identical to that used for 
first-order differentiators. Given an input data sequence xj sampled at interval T, 
the Hilbert transforming filter g will produce an output y given by

where K = 29, is the normalizing factor. This implementation can be carried out in 
real time by employing the techniques discussed in Chapter 2, where the incoming 
data are sequentially stacked at the top and the oldest data discarded. The stacking 
corresponds to the length of the filter, although only half the filter coefficients are 
actually stored. Alternative implementations could utilize the select-save or select-
add methods [3]. The implementation of the Hilbert demodulation scheme is 
straightforward using standard Matlab filter functions. A Matlab procedure 
that implements the demodulation scheme in Figure 7.2 is given in Figure 7.3. In 
the event of the unavailability of a high-level programming environment, the 
products in (7.6) should be interpreted as a term-by-term operation (or the scalar 
product; see footnote on page 20) on values corresponding to time t.

From (7.11), and considering only the amplitudes of the time-dependent signals in 
(7.12), we observe that if the phase error δϕ is to be zero, then the numerator in 
(7.11) must necessarily be zero. This means that a = c = 0, and b = 1. By further 
implication, δϕ is zero only if

Equation (7.13) suggests that for ideal performance, the output amplitude of the 
Hilbert transform must be identical to the output amplitude of the companion low-
pass filter. Furthermore, this condition must be satisfied for both signal and 
reference. However, note that there is no requirement that the amplitude of the 
input phase modulated signal be equal to the reference; that is, the amplitude A 
does not have to be equal to B.  If (7.13) is not satisfied, we will observe 
oscillations in the measured phase that are not related to the Gibbs phenomenon. 
The oscillations are mainly at the second harmonic of the reference frequency. 
We have used the low-pass filter for two reasons: (1) to compensate for any 
phase change associated with the Hilbert transformer across the signal bandwidth, 
a situation that exists in all FIR filters (see (7.4)); and (2) to improve the noise 
filtering in both reference and measurement signal. The frequency response of the 
Hilbert transformer is by nature a band-pass filter and will not allow dc 
components through; however, its phase response behaves like a low-pass filter. 
In other words, the slopes of the phase response of the Hilbert transformer and 
low pass filter are identical when their orders L are equal, but note that their 
phases differ by π/2 up to the cut-off frequency. This means that low-pass filtered 
signals are ideally in quadrature with their Hilbert counterparts across the signal 
bandwidth.  
Therefore, to be fully compatible with the Hilbert transformer, the companion 
filter (LPF of Fig. 7.2) should have dc blocking capabilities, or alternatively, the 
input data into the digital demodulator should be ac. However, the use of band-
pass filters as a substitute for companion low pass filters will not necessarily lead 
to full quadrature across the signal bandwidth. In fact, we have observed an order 
of magnitude difference in dc phase errors, in favor of low-pass filters when band-
pass filters were substituted for the former in the given demodulation scheme. 
Thus, although a band-pass filter will guarantee ac signals in synchrony with the 
Hilbert transformer, it generally leads to other errors. One way around this 
problem is to pass the modulated signal through dc blocking filters1 before 
demodulation.

where yt and xt are the most recent output and input data to the filter, yt-1 and xt-1 are the previous output 
and input data respectively, and a is a constant. The constant a is generally between 0.995 and 0.999, 
tending towards unity, depending on application. The closer a is to unity, the sharper the high-pass 
transition edge. The nonlinear phase response of this filter is usually acceptable since the Hilbert filter 
yields the quadrature signal component for any given input.

Digital Filter Design Solutions 
If the reference is available as sine and cosine functions, then there is no need to 
use the Hilbert transform and low-pass filter along the reference path. In this case, 
ct is replaced by sinωt and        by cosωt.  This latter approach leads to a loss of 
absolute phase information but in many demodulation applications only the 
temporal change in phase is important. Absolute phase measurement is important 
in some metrology applications; for example, those involving optical 
interferometry where the optical beam is split beforehand into signal and reference 
beams. In fact, phase error relations similar to (7.11) and (7.12) have been derived 
for optical metrology applications [5,6], and could be considered generic to phase 
measurement techniques. 
In practice, the difference between the pre- and post-filtering amplitudes of A 
(and B) is typically of the order of 10-5, the latter being the peak-to-peak ripple of 
the filter, but depending on application, may be important. As such, the peak-to-
peak specification of both Hilbert and companion filters must be taken into 
consideration. In the following sections, we will show typical effects using the 
transformers presented in this chapter. In particular, we will look at the 
demodulated phase error δϕ when ϕt is constant (i.e., dc phase errors), its 
dependence on filter length, carrier frequency, carrier frequency mismatch, and 
similar effects when ϕt is sinusoidal (i.e., the ac phase errors).  
7.4 DC PHASE ERRORS 
7.4.1 
Evolution of Carrier Frequency 
The dc phase error is the error δϕ arising from the demodulation process when the 
input phase ϕt is constant. In a noise-free simulation we sampled an 800 Hz carrier 
signal at 4 kHz, the former corresponding to normalized carrier frequency of F = 
0.4. Figure 7.4 (a) shows the demodulated phase output ϕt,m using the scheme 
given in Figure 7.2, when the input phase was 90o and the filter lengths were all 
155. The frequency cut-off of both filters was 0.7. The output exhibits a periodic 
phase error with frequency at the second harmonic (F = 0.8) and a peak-to-peak 
error of ± 1.35×10-4 o (±2.36 µrad). This is consistent with the analysis in (7.11) 
and (7.13) for a small mismatch in amplitude where, although the simulated input 
amplitudes were identical (i.e., A = B = 1), the pass-band ripple errors of both 
filters were of the order of 10-5, thereby accounting for the error amplitude. In 
general, the error scales with magnitude of the input phase. Figure 7.4 (b) shows 
the peak- to-peak phase error plotted against input phase. Because of the linear 
relationship at low input phase values, in terms of the % error, this is highest for 
lowest values falling off gradually to lower % error at higher phase values. We 
also find that the largest peak-to-peak dc phase error occurs when the input phase 
is 90o. As such, in characterizing demodulation performance, we opted to look at 
the evolution of the peak-to-peak dc phase error at 90o, denoted by δϕ,max against 
carrier frequency F.

2 kHz). (b) Profile of peak-to-peak dc phase error over a range of input phases. Filter order L = 154. 
 
Figure 7.5 shows how this maximum error evolves with carrier frequency. We 
readily  observe  that  when  the  carrier frequency is well within the pass-band of 
the Hilbert transform and away from its transition edges, the errors tend to be 
much smaller than when on the edges. Thus, in this case, the working frequency 
range that will guarantee an error of 3×10-4 o or less using floating-point arithmetic 
is 0.1 to 0.6. From this viewpoint, it is advisable to arrange for the carrier 
frequency to be as central as possible in this frequency range and away from the 
transition edges of the transform. 
7.4.2 
Phase Step Response  
The phase step response is the analog of the unit step response propagating 
through a low-pass filter as discussed in earlier chapters. However, in this case, a 
unit phase step (measured in degrees) is introduced via ϕt into the Hilbert 
demodulation scheme and its response observed; this corresponds to an input 
phase step of 0.0175 radian. The phase step is between 90o and 91o since 
demodulation in this region tends to give the worst-case phase errors. The carrier 
frequency  is  chosen  to be at the center of the  usable range of the demodulation 
process, which in this case is 0.4. Figure 7.6 shows a typical phase step response 
for the said demodulation scheme. 
7.4.3 
Frequency Step Response  
If there is a simultaneous step change in carrier frequency in both signal and 
reference  there  is  evidence  of spiking on  the demodulated output. Figure 7.7(a)

7.5 INFLUENCE OF CARRIER FREQUENCY MISMATCH AND ITS 
COMPENSATION 
The influence of carrier frequency mismatch between reference and measurement 
signal is fairly well known for demodulation techniques. In general, for a 
normalized frequency mismatch of ∆F, the measured phase ϕt,m acquires an 
additional linear frequency-dependent term, and is given by

where ϕt is the ideal phase, fs is the sampling frequency, and δϕ is the error term 
that includes both random and systematic quantities. The slope π∆Ffs, is in rad/s. 
In many practical applications involving demodulation, there is usually some 
form of carrier frequency mismatch that must be stabilized over the course of the 
operation. This is often due to the fact that the reference may have been generated 
locally, whereas the signal may have traveled through various materials picking 
up thermal noise and other disturbances along its path. In high-precision 
applications, it has become customary to allow both the reference and signal to 
travel along similar paths so that both phase noise and drifts are common mode 
(i.e., the  noise  and  drifts  on  both  channels  are, or  nearly  identical so that they

cancel out on demodulation).  In the case where this is not possible, it is useful to 
feed back the slope information to the local oscillator and correct for drift. A 
schematic for carrier frequency mismatch, or temporal phase drift compensation, 
is shown in Figure 7.8.  
The slope can be determined in one of three ways: (1) by taking the average 
of the derivative of  ϕt,m (i.e.,                 = π∆Ffs), where the angled brackets should 
be interpreted as taking the time average of the quantity within the brackets; (2) by 
fitting ϕt,m  to a straight line and extracting the slope over a suitable period of 
time; and (3) using the scheme described in Section 7.9.1. The actual 
implementation may depend finally on the computing platform used. For example, 
in processors where hardware multipliers and adders are accessible, direct digital 
differentiation may be attractive, whereas in off-line applications, straightforward 
high-level computation via least squares fitting may be preferable. Note that if the 
slope is positive, then the signal frequency is greater than the reference frequency; 
therefore we need to use the slope information so as to increase the reference 
oscillator frequency, and vice versa, in order to correct the frequency mismatch.  
The schema shown in Figure 7.8 could be carried out on large blocks of data, 
or in real time using the stacking method mentioned earlier in Section 7.3.1. The 
limitation of the latter method, of course, is that the rate of clocking the data 
through the filter must be fast with regard to the end-user needs. Moreover, it 
would appear that this approach is more favorable to digital differentiation where 
a similar filtering operation could be carried out for slope determination. From 
this point of view, it is recommended that the differentiator cut-off frequency be 
0.2 or less for this application. In both methods, however, it is assumed that the 
rate of change of the frequency mismatch is constant or very slowly varying in 
relation to the loop processing time and the signal is narrowband. It should be 
noted too that this analysis is also applicable to ac phase demodulation. 
7.6 AC PHASE DEMODULATION

frequency. Figure 7.9 shows the output of the demodulation scheme of Figure 7.2 
for ϕo = 60o and 1×10-6 o and Fm = 0.025 in (7.15). Certainly, using floating-point 
arithmetic, the scheme is able to demodulate amplitudes of the order of one part in 
a 106. In general, the minimum detectable phase is more than 100 times smaller 
than the modulation amplitude when the former is larger than roundoff noise.  In 
the next subsection, we will investigate ac demodulation error limits when 
floating-point arithmetic is used. 
7.6.1 
AC Phase Errors  
The ac phase error is the error δϕ (see (7.11)) arising from the demodulation 
process when the input phase ϕt is an ac signal described by (7.15). Figure 7.10 
shows typical ac phase errors corresponding to the demodulated signals shown in 
Figure 7.9. We may readily observe that the errors exhibit the second harmonic 
component at F = 0.8, which is similar to dc phase errors, but carries an envelope 
at the modulation frequency Fm (=0.025). The peak-to-peak error for a modulation

amplitude ϕo of 60o is approximately 2.5×10-4o (4.4 µrad), whereas for an 
amplitude of 1×10−6 o, the peak-to-peak error is 5×10−12 o (87 femtorad). 
7.6.2 
AC Phase Error Dependence on Modulation Frequency 
In this case, the amplitude ϕo is kept constant while the modulation frequency Fm 
is varied. Figure 7.11 shows the peak-to-peak ac phase errors as a function of Fm. 
Notice that the errors are relatively flat or stable up to Fm ≈ 0.04 for amplitudes 
60o and 90o (part (a) of figure) before a steep rise in magnitude is observed. 
Although the observed feature is similar for the 0.001o amplitude (b), the steep 
rise occurs much later around 0.2. These are characteristic features of the ac peak-
to-peak errors encountered in the Hilbert demodulation process. This phenomenon 
could be understood by substituting (7.15) into (7.2) and using the well-known 
result [4,7]

 are the angular modulation and carrier 
frequencies, respectively. 
This result suggests that the spectrum of the signal St consists of the carrier 
frequency F, with an infinite number of side bands at multiples of ωm, and which 
depend on the magnitude of ϕo.  As pointed out by Carlson [4], the odd-order side 
bands are reversed in phase or inverted relative to the unmodulated carrier. Thus, 
negative frequencies are folded back into the positive side of the spectrum. 
Provided ϕoFm << F, the folded-back components will be negligible. However, as 
the modulation frequency increases, the folded-back components become 
significant and interfere with other frequency components leading to a decrease in 
the accuracy of the demodulation process. In fact, for some applications the side 
bands are considered significant if

considerable number of Bessel components in contrast to the latter. Note that the 
spacing between the components is equal to the modulation frequency Fm. For 
relatively small ϕo, the modulation frequency Fm could be relatively large without 
their product being significant in comparison to the carrier frequency F. This 
explains the observation (see Figure 7.11) that for small amplitudes ϕo, the 
apparent stable error range is more extended than for larger modulation 
amplitudes. Further discussion on these issues in relation to narrowband and 
wideband FM demodulation are to be found in Carlson [4] and Hahn [8]. We will 
discuss the influence of the carrier frequency on filter bandwidth in the following 
sections. 
7.6.3 
AC Phase Error and Demodulation Bandwidth 
From our previous discussion it is not too difficult to see that if the carrier 
frequency F is increased, then for a given modulation index, the condition ϕoFm 
<< F allows for a greater range on Fm. While this is true in general, the cut-off 
frequencies of both the Hilbert and low-pass filter and the band-pass nature of the 
demodulation process itself limit the overall demodulation bandwidth. Figure 7.13 
shows how the peak-to-peak error responds to changes in carrier frequency for a 
range of modulation frequencies. Although the shape of the response remains 
essentially the same, it is nevertheless shifted along the modulation frequency axis 
for various carrier frequencies F.  The loss in bandwidth for F > 0.6 and < 0.2 in

Figure 7.13 occurs because these carriers are on the transition edges of the filter 
pass bands (see Figure 7.5).  
If we define the stable flat error region as the demodulation bandwidth Bdem, 
where the error is less than 10−4 degrees (1.75 µradians), then we can write an 
empirical relation between the bandwidth and modulation index as

where Bdem is normalized with respect to the Nyquist frequency, and ϕo is 
measured in degrees. This relation is valid for carrier frequencies operating at the 
center of the Hilbert and low-pass filter bandwidths, being between 0.8 and the 
Nyquist. Note that the dependence of Bdem on filter length is minimal over the said 
range, showing only little influence in (7.18).  
Thus in order to obtain large demodulation bandwidths, it is necessary to 
have: (a) the widest possible pass bands for the Hilbert and low pass filters; (b) 
smallest possible modulation amplitudes; (c) highest possible carrier frequency; 
and (d) highest possible sampling rates. However, the widest possible filter pass-
band would imply a noisy output and a balance needs to be struck between 
demodulation bandwidth and noise feedthrough. A reasonably high carrier 
frequency is required so that all the Bessel components are properly formed 
around the carrier without folding at the Nyquist or at dc. In the next section we 
will look briefly at a second demodulation scheme. Most of the previous 
discussion also applies to the second scheme.

Figure 7.14 Schematic of a second phase/frequency demodulation process. 
7.7 PHASE-FREQUENCY DEMODULATION SCHEME 2 
A second and closely related phase/frequency demodulation technique is 
described here. The schematic is shown in Figure 7.14. In this method, the input 
signal st is low-pass filtered with LPF1 only, while the reference signal ct is made 
analytic via LPF1 and the Hilbert filter HTF. The resulting analytical signal is 
multiplied by the filtered real signal st, then low-pass filtered a second time to 
yield the in-phase I and quadrature component Q. This approach is based on the 
fact that a real signal is half the sum of an analytical signal and its complex 
conjugate. Thus, in multiplying the real signal st with the complex reference ct, we 
obtain a signal2 at twice the carrier frequency and a dc phasor term that depends 
only on the modulated phase ϕt. The high-frequency component at 2ω is readily 
low-pass filtered by LPF, so that the demodulated phase ϕt is given by

The numerator in (7.19) corresponds to the imaginary part of the phasor whose 
argument is ϕt, whereas the denominator is the real part of this low-pass filtered 
analytical signal. 
Note that replacing the analytical reference signal ct with its sine and cosine 
signals at the carrier frequency has no detrimental effect on performance of the 
scheme, since with appropriate sign changes, sine and cosine functions are Hilbert 
transforms of each other [8]. This could be useful in applications where an internal 
digital sin/cos generator is available. However, there may still be a need for 
correction of frequency drifts as discussed in Section 7.5.

Implementation 
The implementation of this phase-frequency demodulator using the discrete 
Hilbert transform in Matlab is similar to that given in Section 7.3.1. While it is 
recognized that in many microprocessor applications a completely different 
approach may be necessary involving possibly special adders and multipliers, the 
Matlab procedure given in Figure 7.15 could nevertheless be a useful starting 
point. In general, this second scheme is less demanding on resources than the 
former described in Section 7.3. Note that the Matlab function fftfilt or any other 
filter implementation could be used in place of filter in Figure 7.15.

ε is the amplitude error introduced by the postmixing filter (LPF) in the 
quadrature (Q) arm of the process, and α is the amplitude error introduced by the 
postmixing filter in the in-phase (I) arm. The quantities ε and α could be seen as 
leakage of the signal amplitude at the second harmonic through the post-mixing 
filter. It can be seen from (7.20) that for zero phase error, γ must be unity, which 
implies that both ε and α must be zero, and AH = ALP. These conditions are less 
restrictive than Scheme 1, and thus make Scheme 2 more attractive.  In practice, ε 
and α are of the order of 10-4, giving roughly the same error margin as Scheme 1.

error. When the said ratio is unity, and the leakage amplitude ε and α are 10-4, the 
peak-to-peak phase error is approximately ±0.01o. However, when the error 
between AH and ALP is only 0.1% (i.e., AH /ALP = 1.001 or 0.999), the phase error 
increases by a factor of 3 to ± 0.03o. Furthermore, when there is a difference of 
0.1% between AH and ALP and the leakage amplitudes ε and α differ by a factor of 
5, the peak-to-peak phase error creeps up to almost 0.1o. Certainly, in some optical 
metrology applications, this error is significant, but in the majority of applications 
this is unimportant. Note that the phase error at ϕt = 0o is

and could be used as a measure of the combined leakage in the demodulation 
system. This is done by offering up zero phase to the demodulation system and 
observing its output. A similar result could be obtained for the demodulation 
given in Scheme 1, by suppressing sin ω t and cos ω t (i.e., making them unity) in 
(7.12). Drawing on the similarity between (7.20a) and the phase error obtained for 
optical interferometers in [9], the peak error δϕ,max when there is a small leakage 
through the post-mixing filter is approximated by

Thus for example, if AH/ALP = 1.001, and ε =α = 0.0001 (i.e., −80 dB leakage), 
δϕ,max turns out to be ~ 0.035o. This may be compared with the full theoretical 
peak value of 0.036o; refer to the corresponding trace in Figure 7.16 for details. 
7.7.3 
Demodulation Bandwidth of Scheme 2 
The demodulation bandwidth of Scheme 2 exhibits similar characteristics to that 
shown for Scheme 1. The bandwidth Bdem, was defined earlier (Section 7.6.3) for a 
given modulation amplitude ϕo, as the flat stable region of the peak-to-peak phase 
error when the modulation frequency was varied (see Figure 7.11). However, in 
this case, since we are allowed to vary the two premixing filters (i.e., the Hilbert 
transformer and low-pass filter 1 (LPF1)), and the postmixing filter, LPF, there 
are several degrees of freedom with which to investigate filter effects on 
demodulation bandwidth. To make matters simple, we have chosen to observe the 
demodulation bandwidth by limiting the premixing filters to a single length and 
cut-off frequency, and only varying the cut-off of the postmixing filter, LPF. 
Figure 7.17 shows the modulation bandwidth when the pre-mixing filters are set at

Figure 7.17 Dependence of demodulation bandwidth on cut-off frequency of the postmixing filter, 
LPF, and modulation amplitude ϕo when the cut-off is 0.7 for both premixing filters. This refers to the 
scheme shown in Figure 7.14. The carrier frequency is at the center of premixing filter bandwidth. 
 
Fc = 0.7 and length 155. It is clear that as the modulation amplitude is increased, 
the bandwidth decreases. In general, the higher the cut-off of the postmixing filter, 
the larger the demodulation bandwidth as would be expected since more Bessel 
components become available to represent the modulated signal, and therefore 
less distortion in the demodulated signal. In this approach, the carrier frequency is 
positioned at the center of the premixing filter bandwidth. Given these conditions, 
we may write an empirical relationship between the demodulation bandwidth and 
modulation amplitude in the form

where A, a, and b are constants determined from least squares fits to the 
demodulated phase in a noise-free setting. We have determined these constants for 
premixing filters with cut-off frequencies of 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 and for filter lengths 
of 155 each. These are given in Table 7.1. Note that the demodulation bandwidth 
Bdem is normalized and must be multiplied by the Nyquist frequency to realize the 
correct bandwidth in Hertz. Moreover, the modulation amplitude ϕo in (7.23) is 
measured in degrees. Perhaps a quick comparison between demodulation Schemes 
1 and 2 in terms of the demodulation bandwidth is appropriate.  
In order to make a fair comparison between the said schemes, we compare the 
modulation bandwidth-amplitude profiles for a cut-off frequency of 0.7 for 
Scheme 1, and, 0.7 and 0.3 for the pre- (LPF1/HTF) and postmixing (LPF) filters, 
respectively,  for  Scheme 2.  The lengths  of  all  filters  were 155, and  the carrier

frequency was in the center of the premixing filter. This is shown in Figure 7.18. 
These results suggest that both schemes show similar performance levels. The 
accuracy of the demodulation bandwidths given in this work is ± 0.01 (normalized 
frequency).  
Note that the largest bandwidths for Scheme 2 occur when the postmixing 
filter cut-off Fout is about half that of the premixing bandwidth Fin. Thus a 
comparison between 0.7 for Scheme 1 and 0.7 and 0.3 for Scheme 2 is adequate. 
In general, as the modulation amplitude decreases the demodulation bandwidth 
increases exponentially. 
7.8 INTRODUCING AN ARBITRARY PHASE SHIFT INTO A SIGNAL 
In this section we will take a brief look at how to introduce a known phase shift 
into a signal using the digital Hilbert transform. This may be useful in situations 
where we want to rephase a signal in relation to a known reference. A simple way 
of doing this is to cast the analytical signal into the Argand plane, then rotate its 
axes through θ with the Cartesian rotator Rθ 
3. Let the real part of the signal be x 
and its imaginary part be H{x}. After  anticlockwise rotation of its axes through θ,

Moreover, since both real and imaginary parts of (7.24) involve the unshifted 
signal and its Hilbert transform (i.e., both x and H{x}), we can modify the Hilbert 
filter coefficients gk directly, so that the coefficients not only imparts 90o to the 
signal, but also imparts the additional phase delay θ.  This means that we need two

Let hθ represent the low-pass component of the phase-shifting filter with the same

The Hilbert transform of (7.29) is found by making the phase shift      . Figure 
7.20 shows typical results for a sinusoidal signal and a modulated signal using 
(7.29). The carrier frequency for the sinusoidal signal was 0.04. However, while 
the errors for the sinusoidal signal were relatively insignificant, for a modulated 
signal with low carrier frequencies the errors may be substantial. These are shown 
as failure points in Figure 7.20(b). In fact, this is responsible for the demodulation 
phase errors seen in both Schemes 1 and 2. The reasons for this are believed to be 
due to the loss in amplitude when the carrier frequency gets too close to dc, and is 
linked to the transition edge of the frequency response profile of the Hilbert 
transform at dc. 
If the carrier frequency is increased better results are obtained, provided the 
modulation  amplitude  is not too severe so that the signal is well  represented by a

the analytic signal will reflect an accurate model of the real system with 
dependable instantaneous frequency. Thus the signal should be as close as 
possible to that of a sinusoid. A Matlab function that implements (7.29) is given 
in Figure 7.22. In the next section, we will focus briefly on the instantaneous 
frequency and show how to extract the modulation frequency using the Hilbert 
transform. 
7.8.1 
The Phase between Two Narrowband Signals 
The phase between two narrowband signals could be retrieved using (7.7) or 
(7.19). This was implied in our discussion on dc phase errors in Section 7.4. Of 
course, if ϕt is constant then the signal is narrowband. Moreover, the frequency of 
the input signals into the demodulator could be different. If this is the case, the 
low-pass filters in both demodulation schemes must be capable of passing the 
difference frequency of the resulting signals. 
7.9 INSTANTANEOUS FREQUENCY 
In this section, a brief review of the connection between the instantaneous phase 
and frequency will be given. This will then be followed by straightforward 
techniques to extract the instantaneous modulation frequency. 
In the context of communications theory, the instantaneous frequency Finst 
determines the message signal completely, and is given by

                                              (7.30) 
 
where ϕt is the time-dependent phase demodulated output. This is based on the 
Carson-Fry model and has a specific interpretation [10,11], but is not strictly 
analytic as discussed by Hahn [8]. In fact, such models approach analyticity under 
narrowband conditions. As such, (7.30) is applicable to narrowband signals only, 
and barring this, may lead to a misapplication of the derived signal. We must 
emphasize though that in general, (7.30) gives the instantaneous frequency in 
Hertz when the instantaneous phase is measured in radians, and its interpretation 
is governed by the model used. 
In some other applications, a physical meaning could be attached to the 
instantaneous frequency. For example, in sensors involving optical interferometry, 
where the optical path-length is designed to respond sympathetically to changes in 
a physical property of interest, such as pressure or temperature, the instantaneous 
frequency is often linked directly to certain dynamic properties of the material 
forming the sensor. In optical Doppler flow measurements the instantaneous 
frequency is linked to the instantaneous velocity of the flow particles.

If digital differentiators are used in (7.30), an appropriate cut-off frequency should 
be chosen to avoid noise amplification as discussed in Chapter 6. 
7.9.1 
Determination of Instantaneous Modulation Frequency 
Based on the model used earlier in (7.15), we can determine the instantaneous 
modulation frequency Fm,t from the demodulated phase ϕt using the scheme shown 
in Figure 7.23. In this scheme, the demodulated phase is separately differentiated 
and Hilbert transformed, then mixed. The result is low-pass filtered to give                     
.               .  The cut-off of the low-pass filter should be low enough to reject the 
second harmonic at           , but large enough to accommodate small variations in 
Fm,t if necessary. Because the digital Hilbert transform is essentially an 
instantaneous process, the calculated quantities are also instantaneous. Thus, we 
can treat the modulation amplitude ϕo and modulation frequency Fm,t as 
instantaneous. The instantaneous modulation amplitude ϕo,t  at time t, is found 
from

The cut-off frequencies of the Hilbert and differentiating filters need to be 
properly managed. While the latter works well at dc, it is constrained by noise 
issues at high frequencies. The Hilbert transform on the other hand is constrained 
like a band-pass filter to operate at in-band frequencies only, exhibiting a cut-on 
typically 0.05. The useful frequency range over which the system works will be 
determined  by  the  low  pass cut-off  of  the  differentiator  and  the  cut-on of the

Hilbert transformer. One way of relaxing these constraints is to decimate the 
signal prior to Hilbert transformation in the first channel, while decimating after 
differentiation in the second channel, then postmixing the two channels. The result 
is then upsampled prior to low-pass filtering, to restore the original sampling rate 
if desired. Decimation will shift the signals closer to the Nyquist frequency, 
whereas upsampling (interpolation) causes signals to shift closer to dc.  This 
scheme is shown in Figure 7.24. We caution that this technique is valid only for 
slowly varying modulation frequencies      , say, implying narrowband signals of 
the form 
m
F ′  = (1 + αt)Fm, for some small α. A Matlab function is given in 
Figure 7.25, and could be used as an alternative procedure in Figure 7.8 to 
compensate for frequency mismatch. It is worthwhile noting that if ϕt is replaced 
by real modulated signal xt in (7.31) the result would be amplitude demodulation 
using the square law detection process. 
7.10 NOISE CONSIDERATION 
In this section we will look at the influence of the input phase noise and filter 
bandwidths on the output phase noise using both PM/FM demodulation schemes 
described earlier in this chapter. The mathematical derivations will be 
circumvented in favor of a more practical understanding of the results. We have 
used the phase noise in the following simplistic models, since any additive 
amplitude noise on a signal could be converted into phase noise and vice versa. 
And moreover, this approach facilitates interpretation of the PM/FM 
demodulation process in noise. 
7.10.1

Further, it is assumed that F3 is less than both F1 and F2. Note that if other unity 
gain filters (e.g., band-pass) are used, the normalized cut-off F in all cases should 
be replaced  by the overall  bandwidth of the new filter types. The output noise 
power  for  mth  order differentiators in the mixing process will be discussed in the

In a practical application, we could assume that the input phase noise in both 
the s and c channels are  identical so   that                       . Furthermore, by 
allowing the premixing filter bandwidths to be the same (i.e., F1 = F2 = Fin) and 
the postmixing bandwidth to be Fout, we can rewrite (7.33) as

We will show later that this result is identical to the PM demodulation output 
noise power for Scheme 2 when there is no noise on one pair of the input 
channels. We emphasize that (7.34) is an approximation of a wholly nonlinear 
process, and under extreme conditions the nonlinear terms will become 
significant.

Mixing Process Involving Pre- and Postmixing Differentiators 
In this case (Figure 7.27), one of the premixing filters is an mth order 
differentiator with cut-off at F1. Assuming for convenience that the second is a 
low-pass filter with cut-off at F2, and the postmixing filter has a cut-off at F3, then 
following the same principle above in (7.33), assuming statistical independence 
and using the results of Section 6.5, the output phase noise power is given by

Noise Performance of PM Demodulation Scheme 2 
We will use the results above to arrive at simple relations for the output phase 
noise power in PM demodulation Scheme 2. Consider again the schematic shown 
in Figure 7.14; the phase noise powers for the in-phase I  and quadrature Q signals 
can be modeled using (7.33) coming from the two processing arms, so that the 
variance at the output of the arc-tan function,

In order to demonstrate these results, we have carried out simulations for PM 
demodulation (Scheme 2) using various Gaussian white noise inputs. In the first 
instance, a range of input phase noise was created and added to (7.15). The c and s 
signal channels were created and passed to Scheme 2 for demodulation. The ideal 
demodulated signal was subtracted from the Hilbert demodulated phase output ϕt 
and the variance of the residuals calculated. The output phase noise power so 
determined was averaged over 25 such runs. 
Figure 7.28 shows the results of such a simulation under the conditions given 
in Table 7.2. Two cases are shown in the said figure; in the first, (a), the reference 
(or c-) channel was simulated without noise, whereas in the second, (b), both 
channels were supplied with different sets of white normalized deviates. Given 
that Fin = 0.7, and Fout = 0.25, a plot of the averaged output noise power σϕ

against  input  noise  power σε

2Fin Fout) for case (a) and 0.7 for case (b). The least squares slope from these 
results were 0.354 for case (a) and 0.712 for case (b). Clearly, these results are 
consistent with the relations presented above. A detailed analysis of the noise 
phenomena in PM/FM demodulation can be found in Carlson [4] (pp. 314-319). 
While these results demonstrate phase noise linearity at specific pre- and 
postmixing cut-off, it is worthwhile for us to probe demodulation system linearity 
across postmixing filter bandwidths. Again, the simulation conditions were the 
same as that given in Table 7.2. In order to do this, we plotted the ratio 
2
2 /

against Fout, shown in Figure 7.29 for various input noise powers. In this case, the 
predicted slope for (a) single channel noise input from (7.38) is 2Fin, or 1.4, 
whereas for (b), when both channels were supplied with the same noise variance, 
but from different noise realizations, the predicted slope is 2Fin, or 2.8. The single 
channel simulates the situation where the reference carrier (or c channel) is  
generated synthetically with very low noise and the measurement signal (or s 
channel) carries a reasonable amount of noise. Note that the input phase noise 
power varied from 0.03 deg2 (0.0005 rad2) to 5.7 deg2 (0.1 rad2). In part (a) of 
Figure 7.29, the simulated results show a slope that is consistent with that 
predicted up to Fout = 0.3. At this point there is a knee, where the slope changes to 
a smaller value; this generally continues up to Fin before taking off exponentially. 
There is a similar linear response profile for dual channel input noise in (b) 
showing the predicted response (slope of 2.8) up to Fout = 0.3.  
Since the PM demodulated output is readily converted into FM demodulated 
output   by   differentiating    the   former,   the  output  phase  noise power        for

Noise Performance of PM Demodulation Scheme 1 
The mixing concepts discussed earlier could be applied to the PM demodulation 
Scheme 1. However, because of the symmetry of the data paths, there is a 
significant amount of correlation between data on the in-phase and quadrature 
channels. If the correlation between these channels is ρ and the input phase noise 
on the c- and s-channels are respectively,        and       , then the output phase noise

1/4(1 − ρ) = 0.66, noise amplification occurs in (7.41). Unlike differentiators, 
noise amplification is linear and is not likely to be too much of an issue. For full-
band premixing filters, noise amplification is only 50%.  
As in Scheme 2, the output phase   , is converted to the demodulated FM 
output by differentiation, and in this case, if the cut-off of the differentiator is Fdiff, 
the output phase noise power        is given by

Since Fdiff is less than 1, this result could lead to significant increases in SNR for 
relatively low cut-off, especially if Fdiff is less than Fin.  
A comparison between Schemes 1 and 2 when both s- and c- channels have 
similar input noise powers, suggests that (1) Scheme 1 is equivalent to Scheme 2 
when the cut-off frequency Fout of the latter is replaced by (1 − ρ) = 0.38; (2) 
because the cut-off frequency of the postmixing filter could vary to values less 
than 0.38, means that Scheme 2 is more flexible than Scheme 1 and therefore 
capable of yielding less noise than the latter. In general, given that Scheme 2 has a 
wider bandwidth than Scheme 1 (see Figure 7.18) this implies that the former is 
better suited to demodulation than Scheme 1. However, Scheme 2 involves five 
filtering processes in comparison to four in Scheme 1; this may turn out to be 
useful under severe processing constraints. 
7.11   FILTER QUANTIZATION 
The filter coefficients provided in this chapter relate to the demodulator systems 
discussed. As such, specific combinations of Hilbert and low-pass filters will be 
given; the tables and charts displayed are associated exclusively as per 
demodulation system specification. Again as before, all filter coefficients are 
gained up by the factor K = 512. For Hilbert transforming filters, the conversion 
from floating-point to B-bit word size is given by

The recursion converges somewhat slowly for the first peak at p = 1, but is faster 
for other peaks. As such we have least squares fitted the peak values and this leads 
to the linear response given in (7.44).

7.12   CHARTS AND TABLES 
This chapter has focused on some of the applications of the Hilbert transforming 
filter. In the following pages several groups of graphs and tables are given; these 
give the general characteristics of the performance of demodulation Schemes 1 
and 2. The group consists of the Hilbert filter, a companion low-pass filter, and 
the performance features of PM/FM demodulation Schemes 1 and 2.  
Specific low-pass filters with relatively small ripple (~10−6) and 
correspondingly, high attenuation (−130 dB), have been used in both 
demodulation schemes. This approach follows directly from our analysis in 
Sections 7.3.2 and 7.7.2 on error propagation in the demodulation schemes, where 
the error in the pass band should ideally be zero. In an attempt to reduce the 
systematic errors to a reasonable level, we opted to make the ripple of the order of 
10−6. Additionally, the cut-off frequencies of the premixing filters at the input to 
both schemes were made identical for reasons of simplicity. Apart from this, any 
low-pass filter from those given earlier in this filter collection could be used for 
the postmixing stage with the Hilbert filters given here. 
7.12.1 
Filter Identifiers 
This is the name given to the Hilbert filter, associated low-pass filter, or 
performance characteristics of PM/FM demodulation Schemes 1 and 2. The 
Hilbert filter identifier is found at the top of the page and follows the format for 
unity gain filters: 
 
                              HILnnnFm.m 
 
                               HIL

                               nnn  
 
Number of filter coefficients (i.e., filter length) 
                               F m.m 
Normalized cut-off frequency value 
 
 
For example, the identifier HIL99F0.3 means a Hilbert transforming filter of length 
99 with normalized cut-off at 0.3.  
      The companion low-pass filters that were used to carry out the PM/FM 
demodulation in both schemes have similar identifiers to the other low-pass filter 
identifiers in this book. However, the letter H has been appended to the low-pass 
identifier to separate it from the regular low-pass filters. Thus, for example, the 
low-pass filter LPF155F0.8H is associated exclusively with the Hilbert filter 
HIL155F0.8.  
In order to identify the performance characteristics associated with a 
particular demodulation scheme, the following notation is used:  
 
PM/FM Demodulation Scheme 1 (or 2) 
HILnnnFm.m/ LPFnnnFm.mH 
 

428 
Digital Filter Design Solutions 
where the top part of the identifier gives the scheme used and the bottom gives the 
two filters used in the demodulation. The filters at the bottom will be presented in 
pages that precede the demodulation performance features. The Hilbert, low-pass, 
demodulation Schemes 1 and 2 are given in a four-page group of demodulation 
data. Note that for full-band Hilbert filters, there are no corresponding low-pass 
filters; a delay equal to L/2 is used instead of the said low-pass filter in the 
demodulation schemes. 
7.12.2 
Explanation of Additional Terms 
There are a few additional terms that are used in the rest of the work in relation to 
the Hilbert filter. These are the working bandwidth B and the meanings of the 
transition bands and center frequency Fcen. The working bandwidth B is the region 
over which the Hilbert filter gives the best results and correspondingly, the lowest 
demodulation errors. Figure 7.31 shows the working bandwidth in relation to the 
center frequency Fcen. The transition widths are defined similarly to band-pass 
filters, where the regions corresponding to the 90%-10% cut-on and cut-off 
frequencies are given as the transition widths ∆Fon and ∆Foff, respectively.

7.13 SUMMARY 
In this chapter we have touched briefly on the Hilbert transform and some of its 
many uses in demodulation. There are many other demodulation schemes that we 
have not mentioned. However, we believe that the information provided may help 
fertilize ideas on the use of the digital Hilbert transform. An attempt has been 
made to design filters in a simple manner while preserving precision. Much of 
what has been discussed here is directly applicable to high-precision signal 
processing within the fields of optical sensors and optical metrology. We believe 
there are many other applications that can benefit from the approach used here of 
specifying and characterizing filter performance in certain specialized contexts. 
The list of Hilbert and associated premixing low-pass filters presented here are 
given in Table 7.3. The postmixing filter cut-off frequencies are given in relation 
to Scheme 2 only.

Chapter 8 
Conclusion 
Perhaps the best place to end is where we started. In the beginning, we set out to 
prepare and present a collection of predesigned filters for development 
applications specifically for users who cannot find the time to explore the wide 
range of filter design techniques available. It is our belief that time to market is 
critical in product development and as such predesigned filters present 
themselves, perhaps not the best, but as an immediate solution. Given the wide 
range of filter applications and specialized solutions such an approach is 
ambitious and therefore remains a practical limitation.  
In order to maintain a manageable collection of filters we restricted ourselves 
to the simplest technique, the window method. The Gaussian window was chosen 
for its simplicity and resonance with scientists, engineers, statisticians, 
economists, and other product development practitioners. Hardly any theory was 
presented to back up any claims made, since there are several excellent texts on 
digital filters and signal processing. However, it was thought that a book of this 
nature should cover some basic filtering tools with suitable examples for a smooth 
transition into the approach. This was dreamt up to keep certain basic tools of the 
trade at hand and in one place. In this context, therefore, approximately 260 filters 
were characterized and presented both graphically and in tables. Some more 
contextual details were given for differentiators and Hilbert transformers. 
It is hoped that our approach brings many financial and other rewards to the 
scientific community at large, and a significant improvement to product 
development throughput.  This could also be an enjoyable, practical learning 
experience for many first-time users, as well as students who are keen to apply 
digital filters. Time will tell.
