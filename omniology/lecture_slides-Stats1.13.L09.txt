Sampling distributions

Review of histograms 
•  Histograms are used to display 
distributions 
•  For example, the body temperature of a 
random sample of healthy people

The normal distribution 
9 
The normal distribution & 
probability 
•  This allows for predictions about the 
distribution 
– Predictions aren’t certain 
– They are probabilistic 
10 
The normal distribution & 
probability 
•  If one person is randomly selected from 
the sample, what is the probability that his 
or her body temperature is less than Z = 
0? 
– Easy, p = .50 
11 
The normal distribution & probability 
•  If one person is randomly selected from 
the sample, what is the probability that his 
or her body temperature is greater than Z 
= 2? (100 F°, 38 C°)? 
– p = .02

The normal distribution & probability 
•  If this sample is healthy, then no one 
should have a fever 
•  I detected a person with a fever 
•  Therefore, this sample is not 100% healthy 
13 
Sampling distribution 
•  A distribution of sample statistics, obtained 
from multiple samples 
– For example,  
•  Distribution of sample means 
•  Distribution of sample correlations 
•  Distribution of sample regression coefficients 
14 
Sampling distribution 
•  It is hypothetical 
– Assume a mean is calculated from a sample, 
obtained randomly from the population 
– Assume a certain sample size, N 
– Now, assume we had multiple random 
samples, all of size N, and therefore many 
sample means 
– Collectively, they form a sampling distribution 15 
Sampling distribution & probability 
•  If one sample is obtained from a normal 
healthy population, what is the probability 
that the sample mean is less than Z = 0? 
– Easy, p = .50

•  If one sample is obtained from a normal 
healthy population, what is the probability

– p = .02 
17 
Sampling distribution & probability 
•  If this population is healthy, then no one 
sample should have a high mean body 
temperature 
•  I obtained a very high sample mean 
•  Therefore, the population is not healthy 
18 
Sampling distribution 
•  A distribution of sample statistics, obtained 
from multiple samples, each of size N 
– Distribution of sample means 
– Distribution of sample correlations 
– Distribution of sample regression coefficients

Lecture 9 ~ Segment 2 
The Central Limit Theorem 
21 
Central Limit Theorem 
•  Three principles 
–  The mean of a sampling distribution is the same as the mean 
of the population 
–  The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is the 
square root of the variance of sampling distribution σ2 = σ2 /N 
–  The shape of a sampling distribution is approximately normal 
if either (a) N >= 30 or (b) the shape of the population 
distribution is normal 
22 
NHST & Central limit theorem 
•  Multiple regression 
–  Assume the null hypothesis is true 
–  Conduct a study 
–  Calculate B, SE, and t 
–  t  = B/SE 
23 
NHST & Central limit theorem 
•  Multiple regression 
–  If the null hypothesis is true (B=0), then no one sample 
should have a very low or very high B 
–  I obtained a very high B 
–  Therefore, Reject the null hypothesis

NHST & Central limit theorem 
•  Multiple regression 
–  Assume the null hypothesis is true 
–  Conduct a study 
–  Calculate B, SE, and t 
–  t  = B/SE 
–  p-value is a function of t and sample size

NHST & the central limit 
theorem 
•  Multiple regression 
–  If the null hypothesis is true (B=0), then no one sample 
should have a very low or very high B 
–  I obtained a very high B 
–  Therefore, Reject the null hypothesis 
–  Very high and very low is p < .05
