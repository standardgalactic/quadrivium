Introduction
Introduction
This is the ﬁfth book containing examples from the Theory of Complex Functions. In this volume we
shall consider the Laurent series, which are, roughly speaking, complex power series in which we also
allow negative exponents. We shall only consider the the series and their relationship to the general
theory, and ﬁnally the technique of solving linear diﬀerential equations with polynomial coeﬃcients
by means of Laurent series. The importance of these Laurent series will be shown in the following
books, where we ﬁrst introduce the residues in the sixth book, and then examples of applications in
the seventh book. Thus these three books, the present one and the two following, form together make
up an important part of the Theory of Complex Functions.
Even if I have tried to be careful about this text, it is impossible to avoid errors, in particular in the
ﬁrst edition. It is my hope that the reader will show some understanding of my situation.

Some theoretical background
Deﬁnition 1.1 We deﬁne a Laurent series expanded from the point z0 ∈C a series of the form
+∞

n=−∞
an (z −z0)n :=
+∞

n=0
an (z −z0)n +
+∞

n=1
a−n (z −z0)−n .
The domain of convergence of the Laurent series is deﬁned as the intersection of the domains of
convergence of the series on the right hand side of the equation above.
If a−n = 0 for every n ∈N, then the Laurent series is just an usual power series, which domain of
convergence is of one of the following three types:
the empty set,
an open disc of centrum z0,
all of C.
If there exists an n ∈N, such that a−n ̸= 0, then the domain of convergence is either
the empty set,
or
an annulus {z ∈C | r < |z −z0| < R}.

If R = +∞, then the domain is the complementary set of a closed disc, and if r = 0, then the domain
is either an open disc with its centrum removed, or the complex plan with z0 removed, C \ {z0}. The
Laurent series expansion of an analytic function f(z) is always convergent in an annulus of centrum z0,
where this annulus does not contain any singularity of f(z), i.e. f(z) is analytic in all of the annulus.
The most important case, however, is when the inner radius is r = 0, i.e. when we consider a disc
with only its centrum removed, or the complex plane with the point of expansion z0 removed.
When we compute the coeﬃcients of a Laurent series in an annulus we may use the following theorem,
from which is also follows that if the annuli are as large as possible, given the point of expansion z0,
then the Laurent series expansions are diﬀerent in each of the possible annuli.
Theorem 1.1 Laurent’s theorem. Assume that f(z) is analytic in an open annulus
{z ∈C | r < |z −z0| < R} .
Then the corresponding Laurent series in this annulus is uniquely determined by
f(z) =
+∞

n=−∞
an (z −z0)n ,
where
an =
1
2πi

C
f(z)
(z −z0)n+1 dz,
for every n ∈Z,
and where C is any simple, closed curve separating |z −z0| = r from |z −z0| = R, run through in the
positive sense of the plane.
The series is uniformly convergent in every closed and bounded subset of the annulus.
It was pointed out in Complex Functions c-4 that the Laurent series may be used in the theory of
Fourier series. However, the most important applications are connected with the so-called Calculus of
residues, which we shall return to in Complex Functions c-6 and to the speciﬁc application in Complex
Functions c-7. In these cases in the next books we shall only consider the behaviour of the function
in the neighbourhood of an isolated singularity of f(z).
Assume that z0 is an isolated singularity of the analytic function f : Ω →C, i.e. there exists an R > 0,
such that the disc with the centrum removed B (z0, R) \ {z0} ⊆Ω is contained in Ω. Then we have
some Laurent series expansion,
f(z) =
+∞

n=−∞
an (z −z0)n ,
for z ∈B (z0, R) \ {z0} .
There are here three possibilities:
1) If an = 0 for all negative n, then the Laurent series is an usual power series, and we can extend
f(z) analytically to z0. Therefore, we call this case a removable singularity.
Theorem 1.2 If the analytic function f(z) is bounded in a neighbourhood of z0 (with the exception
of z0 itself), then z0 is a removable singularity, and f(z) is also bounded at z0.

2) If an ̸= 0 for some, though only a ﬁnite number of negative n, e.g. a−N ̸= 0 and an = 0 for every
n < −N, then z0 is called a pole of order N. In this case one sometimes write f (z0) = ∞(complex
inﬁnity).
Theorem 1.3 If f(z) →∞for z →z0, then f(z) has a pole at z0.
3) If an ̸= 0 for inﬁnitely many negative n, then z0 is called an essential singularitet of f(z). The
function behaves really wildly in any neighbourhood of an essential singularity,
Theorem 1.4 Picard’s theorem (1879). If z0 is an isolated essential singularity of the analytic
function f(z), and D(r) := B (z0, r) \ {z0}, r > 0, is any neighbourhood of z0 (with the exception
of z0 itself), then the image f(D(r)) is either C or C with the exception of one point w0, i.e.
C \ {w0}.
Finally, we mention that there is no principal diﬀerence if we also consider ∞as an isolated singularity.
We must, however, in this case, request that the analytic function f(z) is deﬁned in the complementary
set of a disc, |z| > R, where we always may choose z0 = 0 as the point of expansion. Thus we assume
that
f(z) =
+∞

n=−∞
an zn,
for |z| > R.
Then we have the same three possibilities as above for a ﬁnite isolated singularity, though it here are
the positive exponents which are causing troubles:
1) If an = 0 for every n ∈N, then ∞is a removable singularity for f(z). In this case we deﬁne by
continuous expansion,
f(∞) = a0.
We note that we in connection with the z-transform always consider Laurent series of this type.
2) If an ̸= 0 for some, though only ﬁnitely many n ∈N, e.g. aN ̸= 0 and an = 0 for every n > N,
then we call ∞a pole of f(z) of order N.
3) Finally, if an ̸= 0 for inﬁnitely many n ∈N, we call ∞an essentiel singularity of f(z).
We should here add that e.g sin z er 0 for z = nπ, n ∈Z, then z = nπ, n ∈Z, are poles of 1/ sin z.
However, since z = nπ →∞for n →±∞, we see that ∞is not an isolated singularity of 1/ sin z, and
it is not possible later on to speak about the residue at ∞for such functions.

Laurent series
.
Example 2.1 Find the Laurent series expansions of the function
f(z) =
1
z −2,
z ̸= 2,
from z0 = 0 in each of the domains in which there exists such an expansion.
The function is deﬁned in C \ {2}, and the point of expansion is z0 = 0. Therefore, we have an usual
Taylor expansion in the disc |z| < 2 and a Laurent series expansion in the complementary of a disc
|z| > 2. The denominator consists of two terms, so the strategy is always to norm the numerically
larger of the terms and then apply the usual geometric series expansion.
1) In the disc |z| < 2 the constant 2 is dominating in the denominator, and
z

 < 1. Hence,
f(z) =

n=0

2n+1 zn,
for |z| < 2,
which clearly is a Taylor series.
2) We have in the complementary of a disc, |z| > 2, that


z
 < 1, so in this case we instead use that
f(z) =

for |z| > 2.
Obviously, we cannot get any expansion when |z| = 2.
Example 2.2 Find the Laurent series expansions of the function
f(z) =
1
(z −1)(z −2),
z ∈C \ {1, 2},
from z0 = 0 in each of the domains where such an expansion exists.
The singularities are 1 and 2, and the point of expansion is z0 = 0. Thus, we get three domains, a
disc Ω1 = B(0, 1), and annulus Ω2 = {z ∈C | 1 < |z| < 2}, and ﬁnally a complementary set of a disc,
Ω3 = {z ∈C | |z| > 2}. Since the function is a rational function, we start by a decomposition,
f(z) =

(z −1)(z −2) =

and then the most easy method is just to expand each fraction separately. We may here even use
that the Laurent series of
1
z −2 already have been found in Example 2.1, so we shall skip these
computations.

Note in this case that the series expansion does not contain any positive exponents.
Example 2.3 Find the Laurent series expansions of the function
f(z) =
1
(1 −z)2 ,
z ̸= 1,
from z0 = 0 in each of the domains in which such an expansion exists.
The function f(z) is analytic in the unit disc Ω1 = B(0, 1) and in the complementary set
Ω2 = C \ B[0, 1]. Since z = 1 is a double pole, we ﬁrst consider the following auxiliary function
g(z) :=

Since f(z) = g′(z) for z ̸=, and since we may termwise diﬀerentiate the Laurent series in their domains,
we easily get,
f(z) =

n=1
n zn−1 =

Obviously, this technique may be used in general on rational functions, whenever the denominator
has a multiple root.

necessary condition of convergence is that the n-th term tends towards 0, i.e. we require that

for n →+∞.

2 for some n, then
| cos 2nθ| =

and it follows that cos nθ does not tends towards 0 for n →+∞, so the series is divergent. ♦

Clearly. the sum of the imaginary part alone is convergent for z /∈Z−∪{0}, because the terms are
asymptotically equal to a constant times 1
n2 . Concerning the real parts we get for the numerical
values,
x + n
(x + n)2 + y2 ↘0
for n →+∞and n ≥N(x).
The corresponding real sequence is alternating, hence it follows from Dirichlet’s criterion that
the real part of the series is also convergent. (A further analysis would of course show that the
convergence of the real part is conditional, but we shall not use this fact here). The series is clearly
not deﬁned for z ∈Z−∪{0}, so the series is convergent for z /∈Z−∪{0}.

(Note that the denominator is never 0, when |z| > 1). Hence, the domain of convergence is the

2 for m ≥N = N(z), hence

 ≤2 ·

Since  2 |z|n is convergent for |z| < 1, it follows that

If instead |z| > 1, we write

and since

Finally, if |z| = 1, then

and the necessary condition of convergence is not fulﬁlled, so we have divergence for |z| = 1.

Example 2.8 Prove that the power series
f(z) =
+∞

n=0
z2n
represents a function, which is analytic in the disc |z| < 1, and which cannot be continuously extended
across the unit circle.
Hint: Apply the equation
f(z) = z + z2 + z4 + · · · + z2k−1 + f

z2k
.
Prove that if ζ ∈C satisﬁes ζ2k = 1 for some k ∈N, then f(t ζ) →∞for t →1−.
Since
z2n ≤|z|n, whenever |z| < 1, it is obvious that f(z) is analytic in the open disc |z| < 1.
Then
f(z) = z + z2 + z4 + · · · + z2k−1 + f

z2k
.
If we choose ζ ∈C, such that ζ2k = 1, then
(t ζ)2k = t2k,
t ∈]0, 1[,
and we get
f

(t ζ)2k
= f

n=0
t2k+n →+∞
for t →1−,
where we have used that t is positive. Now
z + z2 + · · · + z2k−1
is bounded for z = t ζ, so we conclude that
f(t ζ) →∞
for t →1 −.
Since this holds for every k, and since the set of 2k-roots, k ∈N0, are dense on the unit circle, we
conclude that it is not possible to extend f continuously to any point on the unit circle |z| = 1.

Since sin z = 0 for z = 0 and z = ππ, and since sin z ̸= 0 for 0 < |z|π, the domain of convergence is
0 < |z| < π.
Since sin z is odd and has a zero of order 1 at 0, the structure must be

Example 2.24 Given the functions
f(z) =
ez
1 + z
and
g(z) = ez+1.
1) Find the ﬁrst ﬁve terms
a0 + a1z + a2z2 + a3z3 + a4z4
in the Taylor series of f with 0 as point of expansion.
Specify the radius of convergence of the Taylor series.
2) Find the Taylor series of g with z0 = −1 as point of expansion.
Determine the Laurent series of f i C \ {−1}.
1) The function f(z) =
ez
1 + z is analytic in C \ {−1}, where −1 is a simple pole. Hence the Taylor
series from 0 is convergent for |z| < 1, i.e. in the open unit disc.
The ﬁrst ﬁve terms of the Taylor series are found by termwise multiplication,

4) If c ̸= 6, then the Laurent series contains a term of the type c

A primitive is e.g. Log z, and this is only deﬁned in the plane with a branch cut along the negative

Example 2.28 Given the functions

and
g(z) = z2f ′′(z) + z f ′(z).
1) Find the Maclaurin series of f.
Find also the Maclaurin series of g and the coeﬃcients of this series.
2) Find the Laurent series of f in the annulus |z| > 1.
Also, ﬁnd the Laurent series of g in the same annulus and the coeﬃcients of this series.

We get by termwise integration,

3) A necessary condition for fc having a primitive is

|z|=1

Laurent series solution of diﬀerential equations
Example 4.1 Find all Laurent series from 0, which are a solution of the diﬀerential equation
z3f ′(z) + f(z) = 0,
and determine its domain of convergence.
Remark 4.1 It is actually possible to solve the equation by inspection. However, since the trick is
far from evident, we shall here start with the standard solution. ♦
Laurent series solution. Since z0 = 0 is a singular point of the diﬀerential equation, we can at most
expect a Laurent series solution (possibly non at all). When we put the formal series
f(z) =


n=−∞
anzn =

anzn =


n=0

n anzn+2 +

anzn
=

n anzn+2 +

an+2zn+2 =

{n an + an+2} zn+2.
According to the identity theorem this equation is satisﬁed, if and only if the following recursion
formula holds
n an + an+2 = 0,
n ∈Z,
thus
(1) an+2 = −n an,
n ∈Z.
Equations of this type are solved by ﬁrst identifying those values of n ∈Z, for which one of the
coeﬃcients degenerate to 0 and then split the summation domain into diﬀerent parts by means of
these exception values. We see that an obvious zero is n = 0, where
a2 = −0 · a0 = 0.
This proved that a2 = 0, while a0 can be chosen arbitrarily.
Then by induction of (1),
a2n = 0,
for n ∈N.
This means that the possible Laurent series solution is now reduced to
(2) f(z) =
+∞

n=0
a−nz−n +

a2n+1z2n+1.

This shows that if b0 ̸= 0, then all bn ̸= 0, n ∈N0, and we can determine the w-radius of convergence,

1
2n + 1 = 0,
so if b0 = a1 ̸= 0, the series is only convergent for w = 0. Therefore, we are forced for reasons of
convergence to put
a1 = 0.
If a1 = 0, then it follows from (1) that a3 = 0, and thus
a2n+1 = 0,
n ∈N,
by induction. The series is then reduced to
f(z) =
+∞

n=0
a−nz−n.
If we replace n by −n in (1), then
a−n+2 = n a−n,
n ∈Z,
so
(3) a−n = 1
n a−n+2,
n ∈Z.
If n = 1, then a−1 = a1 = 0. If n = 3, then
a−3 = 1
3 a−1 = 0,
hence by induction,
a−2n+1 = 0,
n ∈N.
The series is now reduced to
f(z) =
+∞

n=0
a−2nz−2n.
We now replace n by 2n in (3). Then we obtain the following recursion formula for a−2n:
(4) a−2n = 1
2n a−2n+2 = 1
2n a−2(n−1),
n ∈N.
Finally, we put cn = a−2n. Then we derive from (4) the following recursion formula,
cn = 1
2n cn−1,
n ∈N.
This is multiplied by 2nn! in order to get
2nn!cn = 2n−1(n −1)!cn−1,
n ∈N,

where we see that the right hand side is obtained from the left hand side by replacing n everywhere
by n −1. Therefore, by recursion,
2nn!cn = 2n−1(n −1)!cn−1 = · · · = 200!c0 = c0 = a0,
hence
a−2n = cn =

for z ∈C \ {0}.
Alternatively the diﬀerential equation can be solved by inspection. However, this solution is not
obvious, so we have postponed it to this place of the example. First assume that we for some reason
suspect that
an = 0
for n ∈N.
The previous computations show that this is actually the case. This means that

Here, either n = −1, i.e.

Second method. Change of variable. Since a0(z) = z3 is only 0 for z = 0, we see that z = 0 is
the only singular point, so we may expect that any possible solution must have the domain of
deﬁnition C \ {0}. Since C \ {0} is mapped into itself by the transformation w = 1

be to see what this equation is mapped into by this transformation.

The latter two expressions are the numerator of the derivative of a fraction of denominator w.
Thus, if the equation is divided by w2 ̸= 0, then

We have here chosen the sign in front of the arbitrary constant a ∈C in order to ease some later

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

This equation is fulﬁlled in the domain of convergence, so we obtain the following recursion formula
(6) (n + 1) {(n −1)an−1 + an} = 0,
n ∈Z,
where we must not cancel the common factor (n + 1).
If n = −1, then n + 1 = 0, and (6) is fulﬁlled, no matter the choices of the values of a−1−1 = a−2
and a−1. Hence we conclude that a−2 and a−1 are independent of each other, and we may for the
time being consider them as being arbitrary.
When n ̸= −1, formula (6) is reduced to
(7) (n −1)an−1 + an = 0,
n ∈Z \ {−1}.
When n = 1, we get a1 = 0, hence by recursion for n ∈N,
an = −(n −1)an−1 = · · · = (−1)n−1(n −1)! a1 = 0,
thus
an = 0

If n = 0, then a1 = 0. We continue by recursion to get an = 0 for all n ∈N, and we see that only
terms of non-positive indices are important.
We put bn = a−n, n ∈N0, and write −n, n ∈N0, instead of n in (8). Then we get the recursion
formula

We derive from this the recursion formula
(10) an+2 = −n(n + 1)an,
n ∈Z.
If n = 0, then we see that a0 is an indeterminate and a2 = 0. Then by recursion,
a2n = 0

If n = −1, then a−1 is an indeterminate and a1 = 0. By recursion we get
a2n+1 = 0

Summing up we have
an = 0

Thus we get by multiplying by −(n −2)!,
+n! bn = −(n −2)! bn−2,
n ∈N \ {1},
and then we have to split the investigation according to whether n is even or odd.
(a) If n = 2p is even, then
(2p)! b2p = −(2p −2)! b2p−2 = · · · = (−1)p0! b0 = (−1)pa0,
hence
a−2n = b2n = (−1)n
(2n)! a0,
n ∈N0.
(b) If n = 2p + 1, p ∈N0, is odd, then
(2p + 1)! b2p+1 = −(2p −1)! b2p−1 b2p−1 = · · · = (−1)p · 1! b1 = (−1)pa−1,
hence
a−2n−1 = b2n+1 =

It follows by the identity theorem that we have the recursion formula
(12) an+2 = n(n + 1)an,
n ∈Z.
If n = 0, then a2 = 0, and hence by induction,
a2n = 0
for n ∈N,
while a0 is an indeterminate.
If n = −1, then a1 = 0, and hence by induction,
a2n+1 = 0
for n ∈N0,
while a−1 is an indeterminate.
Summing up we have
an = 0
for n ∈N.
If we put bn = a−n, n ∈N0 and replace n by −n in (12), then we get
(13) bn−2 = a−n+2 = (−n)(−n + 1)a−n = n(n −1)bn,
n ∈N \ {1}.
If we multiply (13) by (n −2)!, we get
n! bn = (n −2)! bn−2.
Here there is a leap of 2 in the indices, so we must split into the cases of even or odd indices. We ﬁnd
(2n)! b2n = (2{n −1})!b2(n−1) = · · · = 0! b0 = a0,
(2n + 1)! b2n+1 = (2{n −1} + 1)! b2(n−1)+1 = · · · = 1! b1 = a−1,
hence
a−2n = b2n =
1
(2n)! a0
and
a−2n−1 = b2n+1 =

(2n + 1)! a−1,
n ∈N0.

Alternatively, the coeﬃcient a0(z) = z4 leads one the the idea of transforming the diﬀerential

Then apply the identity theorem on this in order to get the recursion formula
(14) (n −1)n an−2 + an = 0,
n ∈Z.
If n = 0, then a0 = 0, and a−2 is an indeterminate.
If n = 1, then a1 = 0, and a−1 is an indeterminate.
It follows from a0 = a1 = 0 and
an = −(n −1)n an−2

by recursion that
an = 0

Put bn = a−n. Then it follows from (14) for n ∈N that

The leap of the indices in (15) is 2, so we must split the following into the cases of even or odd indices.

Then it follows from the identity theorem that we get the recursion formula

for n ∈Z.
The coeﬃcients of the recursion formula have the obvious “zeros” n = −2, −1 and 0. These are
checked separately.
• If n = −2, then
0 · a−2 −a−3 = 0,
hence
a−3 = 0
and
a−2 is arbitrary.
• If n = −1, then
−a−1 + 0 · a−2 = 0,
hence
a−1 = 0
and
a−2 is arbitrary.
• If n = 0, then
0 · a0 + a−1 = 0,

n ≤−3,

• If n > 0, then it follows from (17) that
n(n + 2)an = −(n + 1)an−1,
n ∈N.
When we multiply this formula by (−1)n · (n −1)! ̸= 0, then we get the equivalent formulæ
(−1)nn! (n + 2)an = (−1)n−1(n −1)! ({n −1} + 2)an−1 = · · · = (−1)00! 2 a0 = 2a0,

However, the trick and the reformulations are somewhat sophisticated. We give for completeness a

Since z = 0 is a singular point, we assume in general in the following that z ̸= 0. The not so obvious
idea is then to multiply the diﬀerential equation by z ̸= 0. Then

Using the usual solution of a real, linear, inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order we at led
to guess on the following complete solution of (18):
g(z) = C1 · z e−z.
However, we cannot totally rely on the real solution formula in the complex theory, because the
principal logarithm occurs latently in the computations. Hence we shall check our guess of solution.
On the other hand, this is now trivial. When g(z) is given as above, then

Analogously, if n = 2p + 1, p ∈N0, is odd, then
(2p + 3)(2p + 2)a2p+1 = −a2p−1 = −a2(p−1)+1,
hence by a multiplication by (−1)p · (2p + 1)! ̸= 0, followed by a simple recursion,
(−1)p(2p + 3)!a2p+1 = (−1)p−1(2{p −1} + 2)! a2(p−1)+1 = · · · = (−1) · 1! a−1,
thus
a2p+1 = (−1)p+1

where we have recognized the sum functions of the series. Clearly, the domain of convergence
is C \ {0}, and only the zero solution can be extended to all of C.
Example 4.10 Given the diﬀerential equation
(21)

z2 −z

f ′′(z) + (4z −2)f ′(z) + 2 f(z) = 0.
1) We assume that (21) has a Laurent series solution f(z) = +∞
n=−∞anzn. Derive the recursion
formula for the coeﬃcients an.
2) Find all Laurent series solutions of (21) and their domains of convergence.
3) Then express each of the Laurent series solutions of (21) by elementary functions.
4) Explain why the solutions of (21) all can be extended to C with the exception of at most two points.
Find the type of singularity of each of these points.
First method. Inspection. The most important task is of course to ﬁnd all solutions of (21). We
shall here do it by inspection without applying any of the auxiliary questions in the formulation.
The coeﬃcient z2 −z = z(z −1) of the term of highest order of diﬀerentiation f ′′(z) is zero at the
singular points 0 and 1. Then we reformulate (21) in the following way:

z2 −z

f(z) = b z −a.
If z ∈C \ {0 , 1}, we get by a decomposition,
f(z) = b z −a
z2 −z = b z −a
z(z −1) = a
z + b −a
z −1,
where we have trivial analytic extensions if either a = 0 or b = a.
If a ̸= 0, then z = 0 is a simple pole, and if b ̸= a, then z = 1 is a simple pole.
Second method. The standard method.


(n + 1)(n + 2)an+1zn

(n + 1)(n + 2) {an −an+1} zn.
It follows from the identity theorem that we have the recursion formula
(n + 1)(n + 2) {an −an+1} = 0,
n ∈Z.
Note in particular that
(22) an = an+1
for n ∈Z \ {−1, −2},
while we have no condition for n = −1 or n = −2 whatsoever.
2) Then solve the recursion formula
(n + 1)(n + 2) {an −an+1} = 0.
n ∈Z.
If n = −1, there is no relationship between a−1 and a0.
If n = −2, there is no relationship between a−2 and a−1.
If n > −1, then we get by recursion of (22) that an = a0.
If n < −2, then we get by recursion of (22) that an = a−2.
Hence, all formal Laurent series solutions of (21) are given by

and we seemingly have three arbitrary constants of the solution of a linear diﬀerential equation
of only second order! However, there is nothing wrong here, which follows when we investigate

where f(z) at most has the simple poles at z = 0 and z = 1. By either an analytic extension of
f(z), or just by checking the diﬀerential equation it follows that this function f(z) is a solution
of (21) everywhere in its domain.

the investigation is postponed to the next variant).

(n + 2) {(n + 1)an −(n + 3)an+2} zn+1.
Since n + 2 ̸= 0 for n ≥−1, the recursion formula is reduced to
(24) (n + 3)an+2 = (n + 1)an,
n ≥−1,
and we see that there is a leap of 2 in the indices.
If n = 2p −1, p ∈N0, then it follows from (24) that
(2p + 2)a2p+1 = 2p · a2p−1 = · · · = 2 · 0 · a−1 = 0,
hence a−1 is an indeterminate, and a2p+1 = 0 for p ∈N0.
If n = 2p −2, p ∈N, then it follows from (24) that
(2p + 1)a2p = (2p −1)a2p−2 = · · · = 1 · a0,
hence
a2n =

Third method. Intuition. By reading the text of the example we see that g(z) = z f(z) occurs
somewhere as an auxiliary function. This is a latent hint of reformulating the diﬀerential equation
as an equation in g(z) instead. We get
g(z) = z f(z),
g′(z) = z f ′(z) + f(z),
g′′(z) = z f ′′(z) + 2 f ′(z),

sin z has simple poles at
the same points. Notice that since pπ →∞for p →+∞, we do not have ∞as an isolated singularity

Example 5.4 Indicate the order of the pole at z = 0 of

Determining the order of the pole at z = 0 of
(sin z + sinh z −2z)−2,

so f(z) = sin z + sinh z −2z has a zero of order ﬁve at z = 0. Hence we conclude that

has a pole of order 2 · 5 = 10 at z = 0.

Hence we conclude that ϕ(z) has simple zeros for z = 2i p π, p ∈Z, i.e.
f(z) =

ϕ(z) =

ez −1
has simple poles for z = 2i p π, p ∈Z.

Example 5.7 Indicate the type of the singular points in C of

(a) Clearly, z = 0 is a simple pole, and z = ±2i are double poles.
(b) The function
f(z) =

has the three simple poles 1, i and −i, and the double pole −1.

for z ∈C \ {1}.
Indicate the type of the singularity at z0 = 1, and ﬁnd res(F(z); 1).
Describe for every constant α > 0 the set of points z ∈C \ {1}, for which |F(z)| = α. Show in
particular on a ﬁgure the set
{z ∈C \ {1} | |F(z)| = α}
for representative values of α > 0.
Prove by choosing α > 0 conveniently that F(z) is bounded for |z| < 1, and indicate the smallest
constant C > 0, for which
|F(z)| ≤C
for |z| < 1.
It follows by a series expansion from z0 = 1 that

If α = 1, then ln α = 0, hence x = 1. We have furthermore required that (x, y) ̸= (1, 0), so y ̸= 0, and
we end up with two half lines.
If α ∈R+ \ {1}, then ln α ̸= 0. We get by a rearrangement of (27) that

Remark 5.1 We should of course compare this result with Picard’s theorem which says that the
function exp

takes on any value of C \ {0} in any neighbourhood of z0 = 1. Nevertheless, it
is seen that the function is limited at any point in a neighbourhood of z0 = 1, which also lies in the
open unit disc. ♦

The value of the line integral is obtained by Laurent’s theorem, because the coeﬃcient of z−1 is 1

and because we integrate along a closed simple curve in Ω, which separates the two boundary circles,

f(z) dz = 2πi · a−1 = πi.

Then compute the line integral

The given circle surrounds precisely one of the singularities. We compute the integral by the residue

and

z2(2 −z).
1) Indicate the isolated singularities and their types of f and g in C.
2) Find the Laurent series of f in the annulus 0 < |z| < 2 and in the set 2 < |z|.
3) Find the terms b1
z + a0 + a1z of the Laurent series of g in the annulus 0 < |z| < 2.
4) Explain why the function h(z) = z g(z) can be represented by a power series of radius of convergence
R = +∞. (One shall not ﬁnd the general term of the power series).
1) The function
f(z) =
1
z2(2 −z)
is a rational function with a double pole at z = 0 and a simple pole at z = 2 (and also a zero of
order 3 at∞).
The function
g(z) =
sin(πz)
z2(2 −z) = sin(πz) · f(z)
has the same (ﬁnite) singularities as f(z). However, their types are diﬀerent, because z = 0 and
z = 2 are both simple zeros of the numerator. This implies that z = 0 is a simple pole of g(z), and
that z = 2 is a removable singularity of g(z).

Example 5.12 Given the function
f(z) =
z2 −1
cos(πz) + 1.
1) Find all the isolated singularities of f in C, and indicate their type.
2) Find the radius of convergence of the Maclaurin series of f without determining the coeﬃcients.
Find the coeﬃcients a0, a1, a2 and the Maclaurin series of f.
1) The isolated singularities are given by the equation
cos(πz) + 1 = 0,
i.e. πz = π + 2pπ,
p ∈Z,
thus
zp = 2p + 1,
p ∈Z.
These are all at most poles of second order.
If p = 0, then z0 = 1 is also a zero of the numerator.
If p = −1, then z−1 = −1 is also a zero of the numerator.
We conclude that z0 = 1 and z−1 = −1 are simple poles.
Since
d2
dz2 {cos(πz) + 1}|z=zp ̸= 0,
any other singularity must be a pole of second order.
2) The closest singularities of 0, are z0 = 1 and z−1 = −1. They both have the distance 1 to 0, so
the radius of convergence is R = 1.
If |z| < 1, then
f(z) =
z2 −1
cos(πz) + 1 = a0 + a1z + a2z2 + · · · ,
and we conclude immediately that a1 = 0, because f(z) is an even function. If one does not see
this, we may still perform the following calculation, where we multiply by the denominator,
z2 −1 =

a0 + a1z + a2z2 + · · ·

Then by identiﬁcation of the coeﬃcients,
a0 = −1

a1 = 0,

We note that 0 is not an isolated singularity, because zp →0 for p →+∞, and for p →−∞, i.e.
0 is an essential (non-isolated) singularity.
It follows from
lim

1
cos 1
z
=
1
cos 0 = 1,
that ∞is a removable singularity.
(b) Here 1 −cos z has a zero of second order at z = 0, so the function

z6
has a fourfold pole at z = 0.
Finally, ∞is an essential singularity.

(b) We have a double pole at z = 0, which e.g. can be seen by a Taylor expansion of the denominator.
We have simple poles for z = 2p π i, p ∈Z \ {0}.
The singularity at ∞is not isolated, though the limit of a sequence of poles, hence ∞is an essential
(non-isolated) singularity.
