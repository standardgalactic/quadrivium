Preface
When I wrote the ﬁrst edition in the 1970s my goal was to present the state of
the art of a century old discipline that had recently undergone a revolutionary
transformation. After the book was reprinted in 1997 I started contemplating
a revised edition. It has soon become clear to me that in order to describe
the present day set theory I would have to write a more or less new book.
As a result this edition diﬀers substantially from the 1978 book. The major
diﬀerence is that the three major areas (forcing, large cardinals and descrip-
tive set theory) are no longer treated as separate subjects. The progress in
past quarter century has blurred the distinction between these areas: forcing
has become an indispensable tool of every set theorist, while descriptive set
theory has practically evolved into the study of L(R) under large cardinal
assumptions. Moreover, the theory of inner models has emerged as a major
part of the large cardinal theory.
The book has three parts. The ﬁrst part contains material that every
student of set theory should learn and all results contain a detailed proof. In
the second part I present the topics and techniques that I believe every set
theorist should master; most proofs are included, even if some are sketchy.
For the third part I selected various results that in my opinion reﬂect the
state of the art of set theory at the turn of the millennium.
I wish to express my gratitude to the following institutions that made
their facilities available to me while I was writing the book: Mathematical
Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences, The Center for Theoretical Study
in Prague, CRM in Barcelona, and the Rockefeller Foundation’s Bellagio Cen-
ter. I am also grateful to numerous set theorists who I consulted on various
subjects, and particularly to those who made invaluable comments on prelim-
inary versions of the manuscript. My special thanks are to Miroslav Repick´y
who converted the handwritten manuscript to LATEX. He also compiled the
three indexes that the reader will ﬁnd extremely helpful.
Finally, and above all, I would like to thank my wife for her patience and
encouragement during the writing of this book.

Part I
Basic Set Theory

1. Axioms of Set Theory
Axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel
1.1. Axiom of Extensionality. If X and Y have the same elements, then
X = Y .
1.2. Axiom of Pairing. For any a and b there exists a set {a, b} that
contains exactly a and b.
1.3. Axiom Schema of Separation. If P is a property (with parameter p),
then for any X and p there exists a set Y = {u ∈X : P(u, p)} that contains
all those u ∈X that have property P.
1.4. Axiom of Union. For any X there exists a set Y =  X, the union
of all elements of X.
1.5. Axiom of Power Set. For any X there exists a set Y = P(X), the
set of all subsets of X.
1.6. Axiom of Inﬁnity. There exists an inﬁnite set.
1.7. Axiom Schema of Replacement. If a class F is a function, then for
any X there exists a set Y = F(X) = {F(x) : x ∈X}.
1.8. Axiom of Regularity. Every nonempty set has an ∈-minimal element.
1.9. Axiom of Choice. Every family of nonempty sets has a choice func-
tion.
The theory with axioms 1.1–1.8 is the Zermelo-Fraenkel axiomatic set
theory ZF; ZFC denotes the theory ZF with the Axiom of Choice.
Why Axiomatic Set Theory?
Intuitively, a set is a collection of all elements that satisfy a certain given
property. In other words, we might be tempted to postulate the following
rule of formation for sets.

4
Part I. Basic Set Theory
1.10. Axiom Schema of Comprehension (false). If P is a property,
then there exists a set Y = {x : P(x)}.
This principle, however, is false:
1.11. Russell’s Paradox. Consider the set S whose elements are all those
(and only those) sets that are not members of themselves: S = {X : X /∈X}.
Question: Does S belong to S? If S belongs to S, then S is not a member of
itself, and so S /∈S. On the other hand, if S /∈S, then S belongs to S. In
either case, we have a contradiction.
Thus we must conclude that
{X : X /∈X}
is not a set, and we must revise the intuitive notion of a set.
The safe way to eliminate paradoxes of this type is to abandon the Schema
of Comprehension and keep its weak version, the Schema of Separation:
If P is a property, then for any X there exists a set Y = {x ∈X : P(x)}.
Once we give up the full Comprehension Schema, Russell’s Paradox is no
longer a threat; moreover, it provides this useful information: The set of all
sets does not exist. (Otherwise, apply the Separation Schema to the property
x /∈x.)
In other words, it is the concept of the set of all sets that is paradoxical,
not the idea of comprehension itself.
Replacing full Comprehension by Separation presents us with a new prob-
lem. The Separation Axioms are too weak to develop set theory with its
usual operations and constructions. Notably, these axioms are not suﬃcient
to prove that, e.g., the union X ∪Y of two sets exists, or to deﬁne the notion
of a real number.
Thus we have to add further construction principles that postulate the
existence of sets obtained from other sets by means of certain operations.
The axioms of ZFC are generally accepted as a correct formalization of
those principles that mathematicians apply when dealing with sets.
Language of Set Theory, Formulas
The Axiom Schema of Separation as formulated above uses the vague notion
of a property. To give the axioms a precise form, we develop axiomatic set
theory in the framework of the ﬁrst order predicate calculus. Apart from
the equality predicate =, the language of set theory consists of the binary
predicate ∈, the membership relation.

1. Axioms of Set Theory
5
The formulas of set theory are built up from the atomic formulas
x ∈y,
x = y
by means of connectives
ϕ ∧ψ,
ϕ ∨ψ,
¬ϕ,
ϕ →ψ,
ϕ ↔ψ
(conjunction, disjunction, negation, implication, equivalence), and quantiﬁers
∀x ϕ,
∃x ϕ.
In practice, we shall use in formulas other symbols, namely deﬁned pred-
icates, operations, and constants, and even use formulas informally; but it
will be tacitly understood that each such formula can be written in a form
that only involves ∈and = as nonlogical symbols.
Concerning formulas with free variables, we adopt the notational conven-
tion that all free variables of a formula
ϕ(u1, . . . , un)
are among u1, . . . , un (possibly some ui are not free, or even do not occur,
in ϕ). A formula without free variables is called a sentence.
Classes
Although we work in ZFC which, unlike alternative axiomatic set theories,
has only one type of object, namely sets, we introduce the informal notion
of a class. We do this for practical reasons: It is easier to manipulate classes
than formulas.
If ϕ(x, p1, . . . , pn) is a formula, we call
C = {x : ϕ(x, p1, . . . , pn)}
a class. Members of the class C are all those sets x that satisfy ϕ(x, p1, . . . , pn):
x ∈C
if and only if
ϕ(x, p1, . . . , pn).
We say that C is deﬁnable from p1, . . . , pn; if ϕ(x) has no parameters pi
then the class C is deﬁnable.
Two classes are considered equal if they have the same elements: If
C = {x : ϕ(x, p1, . . . , pn)},
D = {x : ψ(x, q1, . . . , qm)},
then C = D if and only if for all x
ϕ(x, p1, . . . , pn) ↔ψ(x, q1, . . . , qm).

6
Part I. Basic Set Theory
The universal class, or universe, is the class of all sets:
V = {x : x = x}.
We deﬁne inclusion of classes (C is a subclass of D)
C ⊂D if and only if for all x, x ∈C implies x ∈D,
and the following operations on classes:
C ∩D = {x : x ∈C and x ∈D},
C ∪D = {x : x ∈C or x ∈D},
C −D = {x : x ∈C and x /∈D},
 C = {x : x ∈S for some S ∈C} = {S : S ∈C}.
Every set can be considered a class. If S is a set, consider the formula x ∈S
and the class
{x : x ∈S}.
That the set S is uniquely determined by its elements follows from the Axiom
of Extensionality.
A class that is not a set is a proper class.
Extensionality
If X and Y have the same elements, then X = Y :
∀u (u ∈X ↔u ∈Y ) →X = Y.
The converse, namely, if X = Y then u ∈X ↔u ∈Y , is an axiom of
predicate calculus. Thus we have
X = Y
if and only if
∀u (u ∈X ↔u ∈Y ).
The axiom expresses the basic idea of a set: A set is determined by its ele-
ments.
Pairing
For any a and b there exists a set {a, b} that contains exactly a and b:
∀a ∀b ∃c ∀x (x ∈c ↔x = a ∨x = b).

1. Axioms of Set Theory
7
By Extensionality, the set c is unique, and we can deﬁne the pair
{a, b} = the unique c such that ∀x (x ∈c ↔x = a ∨x = b).
The singleton {a} is the set
{a} = {a, a}.
Since {a, b} = {b, a}, we further deﬁne an ordered pair
(a, b)
so as to satisfy the following condition:
(1.1)
(a, b) = (c, d) if and only if a = c and b = d.
For the formal deﬁnition of an ordered pair, we take
(a, b) = {{a}, {a, b}}.
We leave the veriﬁcation of (1.1) to the reader (Exercise 1.1).
We further deﬁne ordered triples, quadruples, etc., as follows:
(a, b, c) = ((a, b), c),
(a, b, c, d) = ((a, b, c), d),
...
(a1, . . . , an+1) = ((a1, . . . , an), an+1).
It follows that two ordered n-tuples (a1, . . . , an) and (b1, . . . , bn) are equal if
and only if a1 = b1, . . . , an = bn.
Separation Schema
Let ϕ(u, p) be a formula. For any X and p, there exists a set Y = {u ∈X :
ϕ(u, p)}:
(1.2)
∀X ∀p ∃Y ∀u (u ∈Y ↔u ∈X ∧ϕ(u, p)).
For each formula ϕ(u, p), the formula (1.2) is an Axiom (of Separation).
The set Y in (1.2) is unique by Extensionality.
Note that a more general version of Separation Axioms can be proved
using ordered n-tuples: Let ψ(u, p1, . . . , pn) be a formula. Then
(1.3)
∀X ∀p1 . . . ∀pn ∃Y ∀u (u ∈Y ↔u ∈X ∧ψ(u, p1, . . . , pn)).

8
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Simply let ϕ(u, p) be the formula
∃p1, . . . ∃pn (p = (p1, . . . , pn) and ψ(u, p1, . . . , pn))
and then, given X and p1, . . . , pn, let
Y = {u ∈X : ϕ(u, (p1, . . . , pn))}.
We can give the Separation Axioms the following form: Consider the class
C = {u : ϕ(u, p1, . . . , pn)}; then by (1.3)
∀X ∃Y (C ∩X = Y ).
Thus the intersection of a class C with any set is a set; or, we can say even
more informally
a subclass of a set is a set.
One consequence of the Separation Axioms is that the intersection and the
diﬀerence of two sets is a set, and so we can deﬁne the operations
X ∩Y = {u ∈X : u ∈Y }
and
X −Y = {u ∈X : u /∈Y }.
Similarly, it follows that the empty class
∅= {u : u ̸= u}
is a set—the empty set; this, of course, only under the assumption that at
least one set X exists (because ∅⊂X):
(1.4)
∃X (X = X).
We have not included (1.4) among the axioms, because it follows from the
Axiom of Inﬁnity.
Two sets X, Y are called disjoint if X ∩Y = ∅.
If C is a nonempty class of sets, we let
 C = {X : X ∈C} = {u : u ∈X for every X ∈C}.
Note that  C is a set (it is a subset of any X ∈C). Also, X ∩Y = {X, Y }.
Another consequence of the Separation Axioms is that the universal
class V is a proper class; otherwise,
S = {x ∈V : x /∈x}
would be a set.

Union
For any X there exists a set Y =  X:
(1.5)
∀X ∃Y ∀u (u ∈Y ↔∃z (z ∈X ∧u ∈z)).
Let us introduce the abbreviations
(∃z ∈X) ϕ
for
∃z (z ∈X ∧ϕ),
and
(∀z ∈X) ϕ
for
∀z (z ∈X →ϕ).
By (1.5), for every X there is a unique set
Y = {u : (∃z ∈X) u ∈z} = {z : z ∈X} =  X,
the union of X.
Now we can deﬁne
X ∪Y = {X, Y },
X ∪Y ∪Z = (X ∪Y ) ∪Z,
etc.,
and also
{a, b, c} = {a, b} ∪{c},
and in general
{a1, . . . , an} = {a1} ∪. . . ∪{an}.
We also let
X △Y = (X −Y ) ∪(Y −X),
the symmetric diﬀerence of X and Y .
Power Set
For any X there exists a set Y = P(X):
∀X ∃Y ∀u (u ∈Y ↔u ⊂X).
A set U is a subset of X, U ⊂X, if
∀z (z ∈U →z ∈X).
If U ⊂X and U ̸= X, then U is a proper subset of X.
The set of all subsets of X,
P(X) = {u : u ⊂X},
is called the power set of X.

10
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Using the Power Set Axiom we can deﬁne other basic notions of set theory.
The product of X and Y is the set of all pairs (x, y) such that x ∈X and
y ∈Y :
(1.6)
X × Y = {(x, y) : x ∈X and y ∈Y }.
The notation {(x, y) : . . . } in (1.6) is justiﬁed because
{(x, y) : ϕ(x, y)} = {u : ∃x ∃y (u = (x, y) and ϕ(x, y))}.
The product X × Y is a set because
X × Y ⊂PP(X ∪Y ).
Further, we deﬁne
X × Y × Z = (X × Y ) × Z,
and in general
X1 × . . . × Xn+1 = (X1 × . . . × Xn) × Xn+1.
Thus
X1 × . . . × Xn = {(x1, . . . , xn) : x1 ∈X1 ∧. . . ∧xn ∈Xn}.
We also let
Xn = X × . . . × X

An n-ary relation R is a set of n-tuples. R is a relation on X if R ⊂Xn.
It is customary to write R(x1, . . . , xn) instead of
(x1, . . . , xn) ∈R,
and in case that R is binary, then we also use
x R y
for (x, y) ∈R.
If R is a binary relation, then the domain of R is the set
dom(R) = {u : ∃v (u, v) ∈R},
and the range of R is the set
ran(R) = {v : ∃u (u, v) ∈R}.
Note that dom(R) and ran(R) are sets because
dom(R) ⊂  R,
ran(R) ⊂  R.
The ﬁeld of a relation R is the set ﬁeld(R) = dom(R) ∪ran(R).

1. Axioms of Set Theory
11
In general, we call a class R an n-ary relation if all its elements are n-
tuples; in other words, if
R ⊂V n = the class of all n-tuples,
where Cn (and C × D) is deﬁned in the obvious way.
A binary relation f is a function if (x, y) ∈f and (x, z) ∈f implies y = z.
The unique y such that (x, y) ∈f is the value of f at x; we use the standard
notation
y = f(x)
or its variations f : x →y, y = fx, etc. for (x, y) ∈f.
f is a function on X if X = dom(f). If dom(f) = Xn, then f is an n-ary
function on X.
f is a function from X to Y ,
f : X →Y,
if dom(f) = X and ran(f) ⊂Y . The set of all functions from X to Y is
denoted by Y X. Note that Y X is a set:
Y X ⊂P(X × Y ).
If Y = ran(f), then f is a function onto Y . A function f is one-to-one if
f(x) = f(y)
implies
x = y.
An n-ary operation on X is a function f : Xn →X.
The restriction of a function f to a set X (usually a subset of dom(f)) is
the function
f↾X = {(x, y) ∈f : x ∈X}.
A function g is an extension of a function f if g ⊃f, i.e., dom(f) ⊂dom(g)
and g(x) = f(x) for all x ∈dom(f).
If f and g are functions such that ran(g) ⊂dom(f), then the composition
of f and g is the function f ◦g with domain dom(f ◦g) = dom(g) such that
(f ◦g)(x) = f(g(x)) for all x ∈dom(g).
We denote the image of X by f either f“X or f(X):
f“X = f(X) = {y : (∃x ∈X) y = f(x)},
and the inverse image by
f−1(X) = {x : f(x) ∈X}.
If f is one-to-one, then f −1 denotes the inverse of f:
f −1(x) = y
if and only if
x = f(y).
The previous deﬁnitions can also be applied to classes instead of sets.
A class F is a function if it is a relation such that (x, y) ∈F and (x, z) ∈F

12
Part I. Basic Set Theory
implies y = z. For example, F“C or F(C) denotes the image of the class C
by the function F.
It should be noted that a function is often called a mapping or a corre-
spondence (and similarly, a set is called a family or a collection).
An equivalence relation on a set X is a binary relation ≡which is reﬂexive,
symmetric, and transitive: For all x, y, z ∈X,
x ≡x,
x ≡y implies y ≡x,
if x ≡y and y ≡z then x ≡z.
A family of sets is disjoint if any two of its members are disjoint. A par-
tition of a set X is a disjoint family P of nonempty sets such that
X = {Y : Y ∈P}.
Let ≡be an equivalence relation on X. For every x ∈X, let
[x] = {y ∈X : y ≡x}
(the equivalence class of x). The set
X/≡= {[x] : x ∈X}
is a partition of X (the quotient of X by ≡). Conversely, each partition P
of X deﬁnes an equivalence relation on X:
x ≡y
if and only if
(∃Y ∈P)(x ∈Y and y ∈Y ).
If an equivalence relation is a class, then its equivalence classes may be
proper classes. In Chapter 6 we shall introduce a trick that enables us to
handle equivalence classes as if they were sets.
Inﬁnity
There exists an inﬁnite set.
To give a precise formulation of the Axiom of Inﬁnity, we have to deﬁne
ﬁrst the notion of ﬁniteness. The most obvious deﬁnition of ﬁniteness uses the
notion of a natural number, which is as yet undeﬁned. We shall deﬁne natural
numbers (as ﬁnite ordinals) in Chapter 2 and give only a quick treatment of
natural numbers and ﬁniteness in the exercises below.
In principle, it is possible to give a deﬁnition of ﬁniteness that does not
mention numbers, but such deﬁnitions necessarily look artiﬁcial.
We therefore formulate the Axiom of Inﬁnity diﬀerently:
∃S (∅∈S ∧(∀x ∈S)x ∪{x} ∈S).
We call a set S with the above property inductive. Thus we have:

1. Axioms of Set Theory
13
Axiom of Inﬁnity. There exists an inductive set.
The axiom provides for the existence of inﬁnite sets. In Chapter 2 we
show that an inductive set is inﬁnite (and that an inductive set exists if there
exists an inﬁnite set).
We shall introduce natural numbers and ﬁnite sets in Chapter 2, as a part
of the introduction of ordinal numbers. In Exercises 1.3–1.9 we show an al-
ternative approach.
Replacement Schema
If a class F is a function, then for every set X, F(X) is a set.
For each formula ϕ(x, y, p), the formula (1.7) is an Axiom (of Replace-
ment):
(1.7)
∀x ∀y ∀z (ϕ(x, y, p) ∧ϕ(x, z, p) →y = z)
→∀X ∃Y ∀y (y ∈Y ↔(∃x ∈X) ϕ(x, y, p)).
As in the case of Separation Axioms, we can prove the version of Replace-
ment Axioms with several parameters: Replace p by p1, . . . , pn.
If F = {(x, y) : ϕ(x, y, p)}, then the premise of (1.7) says that F is
a function, and we get the formulation above. We can also formulate the
axioms in the following ways:
If a class F is a function and dom(F) is a set, then ran(F) is a set.
If a class F is a function, then ∀X ∃f (F↾X = f).
The remaining two axioms, Choice and Regularity, will by introduced in
Chapters 5 and 6.
Exercises
1.1. Verify (1.1).
1.2. There is no set X such that P(X) ⊂X.
Let
N = T{X : X is inductive}.
N is the smallest inductive set. Let us use the following notation:
0 = ∅,
1 = {0},
2 = {0, 1},
3 = {0, 1, 2},
. . . .
If n ∈N, let n + 1 = n ∪{n}. Let us deﬁne < (on N) by n < m if and only if
n ∈m.
A set T is transitive if x ∈T implies x ⊂T.

14
Part I. Basic Set Theory
1.3. If X is inductive, then the set {x ∈X : x ⊂X} is inductive. Hence N is
transitive, and for each n, n = {m ∈N : m < n}.
1.4. If X is inductive, then the set {x ∈X : x is transitive} is inductive. Hence
every n ∈N is transitive.
1.5. If X is inductive, then the set {x ∈X : x is transitive and x /∈x} is inductive.
Hence n /∈n and n ̸= n + 1 for each n ∈N.
1.6. If X is inductive, then {x ∈X : x is transitive and every nonempty z ⊂x has
an ∈-minimal element} is inductive (t is ∈-minimal in z if there is no s ∈z such
that s ∈t).
1.7. Every nonempty X ⊂N has an ∈-minimal element.
[Pick n ∈X and look at X ∩n.]
1.8. If X is inductive then so is {x ∈X : x = ∅or x = y ∪{y} for some y}. Hence
each n ̸= 0 is m + 1 for some m.
1.9 (Induction). Let A be a subset of N such that 0 ∈A, and if n ∈A then
n + 1 ∈A. Then A = N.
A set X has n elements (where n ∈N) if there is a one-to-one mapping of n
onto X. A set is ﬁnite if it has n elements for some n ∈N, and inﬁnite if it is not
ﬁnite.
A set S is T-ﬁnite if every nonempty X ⊂P(S) has a ⊂-maximal element, i.e.,
u ∈X such that there is no v ∈X with u ⊂v and u ̸= v. S is T-inﬁnite if it is not
T-ﬁnite. (T is for Tarski.)
1.10. Each n ∈N is T-ﬁnite.
1.11. N is T-inﬁnite; the set N ⊂P(N) has no ⊂-maximal element.
1.12. Every ﬁnite set is T-ﬁnite.
1.13. Every inﬁnite set is T-inﬁnite.
[If S is inﬁnite, consider X = {u ⊂S : u is ﬁnite}.]
1.14. The Separation Axioms follow from the Replacement Schema.
[Given ϕ, let F = {(x, x) : ϕ(x)}. Then {x ∈X : ϕ(x)} = F(X), for every X.]
1.15. Instead of Union, Power Set, and Replacement Axioms consider the following
weaker versions:
∀X ∃Y S X ⊂Y ,
i.e., ∀X ∃Y (∀x ∈X)(∀u ∈x) u ∈Y ,
(1.8)
∀X ∃Y P(X) ⊂Y ,
i.e., ∀X ∃Y ∀u (u ⊂X →u ∈Y ),
(1.9)
If a class F is a function, then ∀X ∃Y F(X) ⊂Y .
(1.10)
Then axioms 1.4, 1.5, and 1.7 can be proved from (1.8), (1.9), and (1.10), using the
Separation Schema (1.3).

Historical Notes
Set theory was invented by Georg Cantor. The ﬁrst attempt to consider inﬁnite sets
is attributed to Bolzano (who introduced the term Menge). It was however Cantor
who realized the signiﬁcance of one-to-one functions between sets and introduced
the notion of cardinality of a set. Cantor originated the theory of cardinal and
ordinal numbers as well as the investigations of the topology of the real line. Much of
the development in the ﬁrst four chapters follows Cantor’s work. The main reference
to Cantor’s work is his collected works, Cantor [1932]. Another source of references
to the early research in set theory is Hausdorﬀ’s book [1914].
Cantor started his investigations in [1874], where he proved that the set of
all real numbers is uncountable, while the set of all algebraic reals is countable.
In [1878] he gave the ﬁrst formulation of the celebrated Continuum Hypothesis.
The axioms for set theory (except Replacement and Regularity) are due to
Zermelo [1908]. The Replacement Schema is due to Fraenkel [1922a] and Skolem
(see [1970], pp. 137–152).
Exercises 1.12 and 1.13: Tarski [1925a].

2. Ordinal Numbers
In this chapter we introduce ordinal numbers and prove the Transﬁnite Re-
cursion Theorem.
Linear and Partial Ordering
Deﬁnition 2.1. A binary relation < on a set P is a partial ordering of P if:
(i) p ̸< p for any p ∈P;
(ii) if p < q and q < r, then p < r.
(P, <) is called a partially ordered set. A partial ordering < of P is a linear
ordering if moreover
(iii) p < q or p = q or q < p for all p, q ∈P.
If < is a partial (linear) ordering, then the relation ≤(where p ≤q if either
p < q or p = q) is also called a partial (linear) ordering (and < is sometimes
called a strict ordering).
Deﬁnition 2.2. If (P, <) is a partially ordered set, X is a nonempty subset
of P, and a ∈P, then:
a is a maximal element of X if a ∈X and (∀x ∈X) a ̸< x;
a is a minimal element of X if a ∈X and (∀x ∈X) x ̸< a;
a is the greatest element of X if a ∈X and (∀x ∈X) x ≤a;
a is the least element of X if a ∈X and (∀x ∈X) a ≤x;
a is an upper bound of X if (∀x ∈X) x ≤a;
a is a lower bound of X if (∀x ∈X) a ≤x;
a is the supremum of X if a is the least upper bound of X;
a is the inﬁmum of X if a is the greatest lower bound of X.
The supremum (inﬁmum) of X (if it exists) is denoted sup X (inf X).
Note that if X is linearly ordered by <, then a maximal element of X is its
greatest element (similarly for a minimal element).
If (P, <) and (Q, <) are partially ordered sets and f : P →Q, then f is
order-preserving if x < y implies f(x) < f(y). If P and Q are linearly ordered,
then an order-preserving function is also called increasing.

18
Part I. Basic Set Theory
A one-to-one function of P onto Q is an isomorphism of P and Q if
both f and f −1 are order-preserving; (P, <) is then isomorphic to (Q, <).
An isomorphism of P onto itself is an automorphism of (P, <).
Well-Ordering
Deﬁnition 2.3. A linear ordering < of a set P is a well-ordering if every
nonempty subset of P has a least element.
The concept of well-ordering is of fundamental importance. It is shown be-
low that well-ordered sets can be compared by their lengths; ordinal numbers
will be introduced as order-types of well-ordered sets.
Lemma 2.4. If (W, <) is a well-ordered set and f : W →W is an increasing
function, then f(x) ≥x for each x ∈W.
Proof. Assume that the set X = {x ∈W : f(x) < x} is nonempty and let z
be the least element of X. If w = f(z), then f(w) < w, a contradiction.
⊓⊔
Corollary 2.5. The only automorphism of a well-ordered set is the identity.
Proof. By Lemma 2.4, f(x) ≥x for all x, and f −1(x) ≥x for all x.
⊓⊔
Corollary 2.6. If two well-ordered sets W1, W2 are isomorphic, then the
isomorphism of W1 onto W2 is unique.
⊓⊔
If W is a well-ordered set and u ∈W, then {x ∈W : x < u} is an initial
segment of W (given by u).
Lemma 2.7. No well-ordered set is isomorphic to an initial segment of itself.
Proof. If ran(f) = {x : x < u}, then f(u) < u, contrary to Lemma 2.4.
⊓⊔
Theorem 2.8. If W1 and W2 are well-ordered sets, then exactly one of the
following three cases holds:
(i) W1 is isomorphic to W2;
(ii) W1 is isomorphic to an initial segment of W2;
(iii) W2 is isomorphic to an initial segment of W1.
Proof. For u ∈Wi, (i = 1, 2), let Wi(u) denote the initial segment of Wi
given by u. Let
f = {(x, y) ∈W1 × W2 : W1(x) is isomorphic to W2(y)}.
Using Lemma 2.7, it is easy to see that f is a one-to-one function. If h is
an isomorphism between W1(x) and W2(y), and x′ < x, then W1(x′) and
W2(h(x′)) are isomorphic. It follows that f is order-preserving.

2. Ordinal Numbers
19
If dom(f) = W1 and ran(f) = W2, then case (i) holds.
If y1 < y2 and y2 ∈ran(f), then y1 ∈ran(f). Thus if ran(f) ̸= W2 and
y0 is the least element of W2 −ran(f), we have ran(f) = W2(y0). Necessarily,
dom(f) = W1, for otherwise we would have (x0, y0) ∈f, where x0 = the least
element of W1 −dom(f). Thus case (ii) holds.
Similarly, if dom(f) ̸= W1, then case (iii) holds.
In view of Lemma 2.7, the three cases are mutually exclusive.
⊓⊔
If W1 and W2 are isomorphic, we say that they have the same order-type.
Informally, an ordinal number is the order-type of a well-ordered set.
We shall now give a formal deﬁnition of ordinal numbers.
Ordinal Numbers
The idea is to deﬁne ordinal numbers so that
α < β
if and only if
α ∈β,
and
α = {β : β < α}.
Deﬁnition 2.9. A set T is transitive if every element of T is a subset of T .
(Equivalently,  T ⊂T , or T ⊂P(T ).)
Deﬁnition 2.10. A set is an ordinal number (an ordinal) if it is transitive
and well-ordered by ∈.
We shall denote ordinals by lowercase Greek letters α, β, γ, . . . . The class
of all ordinals is denoted by Ord.
We deﬁne
α < β
if and only if
α ∈β.
Lemma 2.11.
(i) 0 = ∅is an ordinal.
(ii) If α is an ordinal and β ∈α, then β is an ordinal.
(iii) If α ̸= β are ordinals and α ⊂β, then α ∈β.
(iv) If α, β are ordinals, then either α ⊂β or β ⊂α.
Proof. (i), (ii) by deﬁnition.
(iii) If α ⊂β, let γ be the least element of the set β −α. Since α is
transitive, it follows that α is the initial segment of β given by γ. Thus
α = {ξ ∈β : ξ < γ} = γ, and so α ∈β.
(iv) Clearly, α ∩β is an ordinal, α ∩β = γ. We have γ = α or γ = β,
for otherwise γ ∈α, and γ ∈β, by (iii). Then γ ∈γ, which contradicts the
deﬁnition of an ordinal (namely that ∈is a strict ordering of α).
⊓⊔

20
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Using Lemma 2.11 one gets the following facts about ordinal numbers
(the proofs are routine):
< is a linear ordering of the class Ord.
(2.1)
For each α, α = {β : β < α}.
(2.2)
If C is a nonempty class of ordinals, then  C is an ordinal,  C ∈C
and  C = inf C.
(2.3)
If X is a nonempty set of ordinals, then  X is an ordinal, and  X =
sup X.
(2.4)
For every α, α ∪{α} is an ordinal and α ∪{α} = inf{β : β > α}.
(2.5)
We thus deﬁne α + 1 = α ∪{α} (the successor of α). In view of (2.4), the
class Ord is a proper class; otherwise, consider sup Ord + 1.
We can now prove that the above deﬁnition of ordinals provides us with
order-types of well-ordered sets.
Theorem 2.12. Every well-ordered set is isomorphic to a unique ordinal
number.
Proof. The uniqueness follows from Lemma 2.7. Given a well-ordered set W,
we ﬁnd an isomorphic ordinal as follows: Deﬁne F(x) = α if α is isomorphic
to the initial segment of W given by x. If such an α exists, then it is unique.
By the Replacement Axioms, F(W) is a set. For each x ∈W, such an α
exists (otherwise consider the least x for which such an α does not exist). If
γ is the least γ /∈F(W), then F(W) = γ and we have an isomorphism of W
onto γ.
⊓⊔
If α = β + 1, then α is a successor ordinal. If α is not a successor ordinal,
then α = sup{β : β < α} =  α; α is called a limit ordinal. We also consider 0
a limit ordinal and deﬁne sup ∅= 0.
The existence of limit ordinals other than 0 follows from the Axiom of
Inﬁnity; see Exercise 2.3.
Deﬁnition 2.13 (Natural Numbers). We denote the least nonzero limit
ordinal ω (or N). The ordinals less than ω (elements of N) are called ﬁnite
ordinals, or natural numbers. Speciﬁcally,
0 = ∅,
1 = 0 + 1,
2 = 1 + 1,
3 = 2 + 1,
etc.
A set X is ﬁnite if there is a one-to-one mapping of X onto some n ∈N.
X is inﬁnite if it is not ﬁnite.
We use letters n, m, l, k, j, i (most of the time) to denote natural numbers.

2. Ordinal Numbers
21
Induction and Recursion
Theorem 2.14 (Transﬁnite Induction). Let C be a class of ordinals and
assume that:
(i) 0 ∈C;
(ii) if α ∈C, then α + 1 ∈C;
(iii) if α is a nonzero limit ordinal and β ∈C for all β < α, then α ∈C.
Then C is the class of all ordinals.
Proof. Otherwise, let α be the least ordinal α /∈C and apply (i), (ii), or (iii).
⊓⊔
A function whose domain is the set N is called an (inﬁnite) sequence
(A sequence in X is a function f : N →X.) The standard notation for
a sequence is
⟨an : n < ω⟩
or variants thereof. A ﬁnite sequence is a function s such dom(s) = {i : i < n}
for some n ∈N; then s is a sequence of length n.
A transﬁnite sequence is a function whose domain is an ordinal:
⟨aξ : ξ < α⟩.
It is also called an α-sequence or a sequence of length α. We also say that
a sequence ⟨aξ : ξ < α⟩is an enumeration of its range {aξ : ξ < α}. If
s is a sequence of length α, then s⌢x or simply sx denotes the sequence of
length α + 1 that extends s and whose αth term is x:
s⌢x = sx = s ∪{(α, x)}.
Sometimes we shall call a “sequence”
⟨aα : α ∈Ord⟩
a function (a proper class) on Ord.
“Deﬁnition by transﬁnite recursion” usually takes the following form:
Given a function G (on the class of transﬁnite sequences), then for every θ
there exists a unique θ-sequence
⟨aα : α < θ⟩
such that
aα = G(⟨aξ : ξ < α⟩)
for every α < θ.
We shall give a general version of this theorem, so that we can also con-
struct sequences ⟨aα : α ∈Ord⟩.

22
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Theorem 2.15 (Transﬁnite Recursion). Let G be a function (on V ),
then (2.6) below deﬁnes a unique function F on Ord such that
F(α) = G(F↾α)
for each α.
In other words, if we let aα = F(α), then for each α,
aα = G(⟨aξ : ξ < α⟩).
(Note that we tacitly use Replacement: F↾α is a set for each α.)
Corollary 2.16. Let X be a set and θ an ordinal number. For every func-
tion G on the set of all transﬁnite sequences in X of length < θ such that
ran(G) ⊂X there exists a unique θ-sequence ⟨aα : α < θ⟩in X such that
aα = G(⟨aξ : ξ < α⟩) for every α < θ.
⊓⊔
Proof. Let
(2.6)
F(α) = x ↔there is a sequence ⟨aξ : ξ < α⟩such that:
(i) (∀ξ < α) aξ = G(⟨aη : η < ξ⟩);
(ii) x = G(⟨aξ : ξ < α⟩).
For every α, if there is an α-sequence that satisﬁes (i), then such a sequence is
unique: If ⟨aξ : ξ < α⟩and ⟨bξ : ξ < α⟩are two α-sequences satisfying (i), one
shows aξ = bξ by induction on ξ. Thus F(α) is determined uniquely by (ii),
and therefore F is a function. It follows, again by induction, that for each α
there is an α-sequence that satisﬁes (i) (at limit steps, we use Replacement
to get the α-sequence as the union of all the ξ-sequences, ξ < α). Thus F is
deﬁned for all α ∈Ord. It obviously satisﬁes
F(α) = G(F↾α).
If F ′ is any function on Ord that satisﬁes
F ′(α) = G(F ′↾α)
then it follows by induction that F ′(α) = F(α) for all α.
⊓⊔
Deﬁnition 2.17. Let α > 0 be a limit ordinal and let ⟨γξ : ξ < α⟩be
a nondecreasing sequence of ordinals (i.e., ξ < η implies γξ ≤γη). We deﬁne
the limit of the sequence by
limξ→α γξ = sup{γξ : ξ < α}.
A sequence of ordinals ⟨γα : α ∈Ord⟩is normal if it is increasing and
continuous, i.e., for every limit α, γα = limξ→α γξ.

2. Ordinal Numbers

Ordinal Arithmetic
We shall now deﬁne addition, multiplication and exponentiation of ordinal
numbers, using Transﬁnite Recursion.
Deﬁnition 2.18 (Addition). For all ordinal numbers α
(i) α + 0 = α,
(ii) α + (β + 1) = (α + β) + 1, for all β,
(iii) α + β = limξ→β(α + ξ) for all limit β > 0.
Deﬁnition 2.19 (Multiplication). For all ordinal numbers α
(i) α · 0 = 0,
(ii) α · (β + 1) = α · β + α for all β,
(iii) α · β = limξ→β α · ξ for all limit β > 0.
Deﬁnition 2.20 (Exponentiation). For all ordinal numbers α
(i) α0 = 1,
(ii) αβ+1 = αβ · α for all β,
(iii) αβ = limξ→β αξ for all limit β > 0.
As deﬁned, the operations α+β, α·β and αβ are normal functions in the
second variable β. Their properties can be proved by transﬁnite induction.
For instance, + and · are associative:
Lemma 2.21. For all ordinals α, β and γ,
(i) α + (β + γ) = (α + β) + γ,
(ii) α · (β · γ) = (α · β) · γ.
Proof. By induction on γ.
⊓⊔
Neither + nor · are commutative:
1 + ω = ω ̸= ω + 1,
2 · ω = ω ̸= ω · 2 = ω + ω.
Ordinal sums and products can be also deﬁned geometrically, as can sums
and products of arbitrary linear orders:
Deﬁnition 2.22. Let (A, <A) and (B, <B) be disjoint linearly ordered sets.
The sum of these linear orders is the set A ∪B with the ordering deﬁned as
follows: x < y if and only if
(i) x, y ∈A and x <A y, or
(ii) x, y ∈B and x <B y, or
(iii) x ∈A and y ∈B.

24
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Deﬁnition 2.23. Let (A, <) and (B, <) be linearly ordered sets. The product
of these linear orders is the set A × B with the ordering deﬁned by
(a1, b1) < (a2, b2) if and only if either b1 < b2 or (b1 = b2 and a1 < a2).
Lemma 2.24. For all ordinals α and β, α + β and α · β are, respectively,
isomorphic to the sum and to the product of α and β.
Proof. By induction on β.
⊓⊔
Ordinal sums and products have some properties of ordinary addition and
multiplication of integers. For instance:
Lemma 2.25.
(i) If β < γ then α + β < α + γ.
(ii) If α < β then there exists a unique δ such that α + δ = β.
(iii) If β < γ and α > 0, then α · β < α · γ.
(iv) If α > 0 and γ is arbitrary, then there exist a unique β and a unique
ρ < α such that γ = α · β + ρ.
(v) If β < γ and α > 1, then αβ < αγ.
Proof. (i), (iii) and (v) are proved by induction on γ.
(ii) Let δ be the order-type of the set {ξ : α ≤ξ < β}; δ is unique by (i).
(iv) Let β be the greatest ordinal such that α · β ≤γ.
⊓⊔
For more, see Exercises 2.10 and 2.11.
Theorem 2.26 (Cantor’s Normal Form Theorem). Every ordinal α >
0 can be represented uniquely in the form
α = ωβ1 · k1 + . . . + ωβn · kn,
where n ≥1, α ≥β1 > . . . > βn, and k1, . . ., kn are nonzero natural
numbers.
Proof. By induction on α. For α = 1 we have 1 = ω0 · 1; for arbitrary α > 0
let β be the greatest ordinal such that ωβ ≤α. By Lemma 2.25(iv) there
exists a unique δ and a unique ρ < ωβ such that α = ωβ · δ + ρ; this δ
must necessarily be ﬁnite. The uniqueness of the normal form is proved by
induction.
⊓⊔
In the normal form it is possible to have α = ωα; see Exercise 2.12. The
least ordinal with this property is called ε0.

Well-Founded Relations
Now we shall deﬁne an important generalization of well-ordered sets.
A binary relation E on a set P is well-founded if every nonempty X ⊂P
has an E-minimal element, that is a ∈X such that there is no x ∈X with
x E a.
Clearly, a well-ordering of P is a well-founded relation.
Given a well-founded relation E on a set P, we can deﬁne the height of E,
and assign to each x ∈P an ordinal number, the rank of x in E.
Theorem 2.27. If E is a well-founded relation on P, then there exists
a unique function ρ from P into the ordinals such that for all x ∈P,
(2.7)
ρ(x) = sup{ρ(y) + 1 : y E x}.
The range of ρ is an initial segment of the ordinals, thus an ordinal num-
ber. This ordinal is called the height of E.
Proof. We shall deﬁne a function ρ satisfying (2.7) and then prove its unique-
ness. By induction, let
P0 = ∅,
Pα+1 = {x ∈P : ∀y (y E x →y ∈Pα)},
Pα = 
ξ<α
Pξ
if α is a limit ordinal.
Let θ be the least ordinal such that Pθ+1 = Pθ (such θ exists by Replacement).
First, it should be easy to see that Pα ⊂Pα+1 for each α (by induction).
Thus P0 ⊂P1 ⊂. . . ⊂Pθ. We claim that Pθ = P. Otherwise, let a be
an E-minimal element of P −Pθ. It follows that each x E a is in Pθ, and
so a ∈Pθ+1, a contradiction. Now we deﬁne ρ(x) as the least α such that
x ∈Pα+1. It is obvious that if x E y, then ρ(x) < ρ(y), and (2.7) is easily
veriﬁed. The ordinal θ is the height of E.
The uniqueness of ρ is established as follows: Let ρ′ be another function
satisfying (2.7) and consider an E-minimal element of the set {x ∈P : ρ(x) ̸=
ρ′(x)}.
⊓⊔

and let G be a function. Then there exists a function F such that for all x ∈P,
F(x) = G(x, F↾{y ∈P : y E x}).
Historical Notes
The theory of well-ordered sets was developed by Cantor, who also introduced
transﬁnite induction. The idea of identifying an ordinal number with the set of
smaller ordinals is due to Zermelo and von Neumann.

3. Cardinal Numbers
Cardinality
Two sets X, Y have the same cardinality (cardinal number, cardinal),
(3.1)
|X| = |Y |,
if there exists a one-to-one mapping of X onto Y .
The relation (3.1) is an equivalence relation. We assume that we can
assign to each set X its cardinal number |X| so that two sets are assigned
the same cardinal just in case they satisfy condition (3.1). Cardinal numbers
can be deﬁned either using the Axiom of Regularity (via equivalence classes
of (3.1)), or using the Axiom of Choice. In this chapter we deﬁne cardinal
numbers of well-orderable sets; as it follows from the Axiom of Choice that
every set can be well-ordered, this deﬁnes cardinals in ZFC.
We recall that a set X is ﬁnite if |X| = |n| for some n ∈N; then X is
said to have n elements. Clearly, |n| = |m| if and only if n = m, and so we
deﬁne ﬁnite cardinals as natural numbers, i.e., |n| = n for all n ∈N.
The ordering of cardinal numbers is deﬁned as follows:
(3.2)
|X| ≤|Y |
if there exists a one-to-one mapping of X into Y . We also deﬁne the strict
ordering |X| < |Y | to mean that |X| ≤|Y | while |X| ̸= |Y |. The relation ≤
in (3.2) is clearly transitive. Theorem 3.2 below shows that it is indeed a par-
tial ordering, and it follows from the Axiom of Choice that the ordering is
linear—any two sets are comparable in this ordering.
The concept of cardinality is central to the study of inﬁnite sets. The
following theorem tells us that this concept is not trivial:
Theorem 3.1 (Cantor). For every set X, |X| < |P(X)|.
Proof. Let f be a function from X into P(X). The set
Y = {x ∈X : x /∈f(x)}
is not in the range of f: If z ∈X were such that f(z) = Y , then z ∈Y if
and only if z /∈Y , a contradiction. Thus f is not a function of X onto P(X).
Hence |P(X)| ̸= |X|.

28
Part I. Basic Set Theory
The function f(x) = {x} is a one-to-one function of X into P(X) and so
|X| ≤|P(X)|. It follows that |X| < |P(X)|.
⊓⊔
In view of the following theorem, < is a partial ordering of cardinal num-
bers.
Theorem 3.2 (Cantor-Bernstein). If |A| ≤|B| and |B| ≤|A|, then
|A| = |B|.
Proof. If f1 : A →B and f2 : B →A are one-to-one, then if we let B′ =
f2(B) and A1 = f2(f1(A)), we have A1 ⊂B′ ⊂A and |A1| = |A|. Thus
we may assume that A1 ⊂B ⊂A and that f is a one-to-one function of A
onto A1; we will show that |A| = |B|.
We deﬁne (by induction) for all n ∈N:
A0 = A,
An+1 = f(An),
B0 = B,
Bn+1 = f(Bn).
Let g be the function on A deﬁned as follows:
g(x) =
f(x)
if x ∈An −Bn for some n,
x
otherwise.
Then g is a one-to-one mapping of A onto B, as the reader will easily verify.
Thus |A| = |B|.
⊓⊔
The arithmetic operations on cardinals are deﬁned as follows:
(3.3)
κ + λ = |A ∪B|
where |A| = κ, |B| = λ, and A, B are disjoint,
κ · λ = |A × B|
where |A| = κ, |B| = λ,
κλ = |AB|
where |A| = κ, |B| = λ.
Naturally, the deﬁnitions in (3.3) are meaningful only if they are independent
of the choice of A and B. Thus one has to check that, e.g., if |A| = |A′| and
|B| = |B′|, then |A × B| = |A′ × B′|.
Lemma 3.3. If |A| = κ, then |P(A)| = 2κ.
Proof. For every X ⊂A, let χX be the function
χX(x) =
1
if x ∈X,
0
if x ∈A −X.
The mapping f : X →χX is a one-to-one correspondence between P(A) and
{0, 1}A.
⊓⊔

3. Cardinal Numbers
29
Thus Cantor’s Theorem 3.1 can be formulated as follows:
κ < 2κ
for every cardinal κ.
A few simple facts about cardinal arithmetic:
+ and · are associative, commutative and distributive.
(3.4)
(κ · λ)µ = κµ · λµ.
(3.5)
κλ+µ = κλ · κµ.
(3.6)
(κλ)µ = κλ·µ.
(3.7)
If κ ≤λ, then κµ ≤λµ.
(3.8)
If 0 < λ ≤µ, then κλ ≤κµ.
(3.9)
κ0 = 1; 1κ = 1; 0κ = 0 if κ > 0.
(3.10)
To prove (3.4)–(3.10), one has only to ﬁnd the appropriate one-to-one func-
tions.
Alephs
An ordinal α is called a cardinal number (a cardinal) if |α| ̸= |β| for all β < α.
We shall use κ, λ, µ, . . . to denote cardinal numbers.
If W is a well-ordered set, then there exists an ordinal α such that |W| =
|α|. Thus we let
|W| = the least ordinal such that |W| = |α|.
Clearly, |W| is a cardinal number.
Every natural number is a cardinal (a ﬁnite cardinal); and if S is a ﬁnite
set, then |S| = n for some n.
The ordinal ω is the least inﬁnite cardinal. Note that all inﬁnite cardinals
are limit ordinals. The inﬁnite ordinal numbers that are cardinals are called
alephs.
Lemma 3.4.
(i) For every α there is a cardinal number greater than α.
(ii) If X is a set of cardinals, then sup X is a cardinal.
For every α, let α+ be the least cardinal number greater than α, the
cardinal successor of α.
Proof. (i) For any set X, let
(3.11)
h(X) = the least α such that there is no one-to-one
function of α into X.
There is only a set of possible well-orderings of subsets of X. Hence there
is only a set of ordinals for which a one-to-one function of α into X exists.
Thus h(X) exists.

30
Part I. Basic Set Theory
If α is an ordinal, then |α| < |h(α)| by (3.11). That proves (i).
(ii) Let α = sup X. If f is a one-to-one mapping of α onto some β < α,
let κ ∈X be such that β < κ ≤α. Then |κ| = |{f(ξ) : ξ < κ}| ≤β,
a contradiction. Thus α is a cardinal.
⊓⊔
Using Lemma 3.4, we deﬁne the increasing enumeration of all alephs. We
usually use ℵα when referring to the cardinal number, and ωα to denote the
order-type:
ℵ0 = ω0 = ω,
ℵα+1 = ωα+1 = ℵ+
α,
ℵα = ωα = sup{ωβ : β < α}
if α is a limit ordinal.
Sets whose cardinality is ℵ0 are called countable; a set is at most countable
if it is either ﬁnite or countable. Inﬁnite sets that are not countable are
uncountable.
A cardinal ℵα+1 is a successor cardinal. A cardinal ℵα whose index is
a limit ordinal is a limit cardinal.
Addition and multiplication of alephs is a trivial matter, due to the fol-
lowing fact:
Theorem 3.5. ℵα · ℵα = ℵα.
To prove Theorem 3.5 we use a pairing function for ordinal numbers:
The Canonical Well-Ordering of α × α
We deﬁne a well-ordering of the class Ord × Ord of ordinal pairs. Under
this well-ordering, each α × α is an initial segment of Ord2; the induced
well-ordering of α2 is called the canonical well-ordering of α2. Moreover, the
well-ordered class Ord2 is isomorphic to the class Ord, and we have a one-
to-one function Γ of Ord2 onto Ord. For many α’s the order-type of α × α
is α; in particular for those α that are alephs.
We deﬁne:
(3.12)
(α, β) < (γ, δ) ↔either max{α, β} < max{γ, δ},
or max{α, β} = max{γ, δ} and α < γ,
or max{α, β} = max{γ, δ}, α = γ and β < δ.
The relation < deﬁned in (3.12) is a linear ordering of the class Ord × Ord.
Moreover, if X ⊂Ord × Ord is nonempty, then X has a least element. Also,
for each α, α × α is the initial segment given by (0, α). If we let
Γ(α, β) = the order-type of the set {(ξ, η) : (ξ, η) < (α, β)},

3. Cardinal Numbers
31
then Γ is a one-to-one mapping of Ord2 onto Ord, and
(3.13)
(α, β) < (γ, δ)
if and only if
Γ(α, β) < Γ(γ, δ).
Note that Γ(ω×ω) = ω and since γ(α) = Γ(α×α) is an increasing function
of α, we have γ(α) ≥α for every α. However, γ(α) is also continuous, and so
Γ(α × α) = α for arbitrarily large α.
Proof of Theorem 3.5. Consider the canonical one-to-one mapping Γ of Ord×
Ord onto Ord. We shall show that Γ(ωα × ωα) = ωα. This is true for α = 0.
Thus let α be the least ordinal such that Γ(ωα × ωα) ̸= ωα. Let β, γ < ωα be
such that Γ(β, γ) = ωα. Pick δ < ωα such that δ > β and δ > γ. Since δ ×δ is
an initial segment of Ord × Ord in the canonical well-ordering and contains
(β, γ), we have Γ(δ × δ) ⊃ωα, and so |δ × δ| ≥ℵα. However, |δ × δ| = |δ| · |δ|,
and by the minimality of α, |δ| · |δ| = |δ| < ℵα. A contradiction.
⊓⊔
As a corollary we have
(3.14)
ℵα + ℵβ = ℵα · ℵβ = max{ℵα, ℵβ}.
Exponentiation of cardinals will be dealt with in Chapter 5. Without the
Axiom of Choice, one cannot prove that 2ℵα is an aleph (or that P(ωα) can
be well-ordered), and there is very little one can prove about 2ℵα or ℵℵβ
α .
Coﬁnality
Let α > 0 be a limit ordinal. We say that an increasing β-sequence ⟨αξ :
ξ < β⟩, β a limit ordinal, is coﬁnal in α if limξ→β αξ = α. Similarly, A ⊂α is
coﬁnal in α if sup A = α. If α is an inﬁnite limit ordinal, the coﬁnality of α
is
cf α = the least limit ordinal β such that there is an increasing
β-sequence ⟨αξ : ξ < β⟩with limξ→β αξ = α.
Obviously, cf α is a limit ordinal, and cf α ≤α. Examples: cf(ω + ω) =
cf ℵω = ω.
Lemma 3.6. cf(cf α) = cf α.
Proof. If ⟨αξ : ξ < β⟩is coﬁnal in α and ⟨ξ(ν) : ν < γ⟩is coﬁnal in β, then
⟨αξ(ν) : ν < γ⟩is coﬁnal in α.
⊓⊔
Two useful facts about coﬁnality:
Lemma 3.7. Let α > 0 be a limit ordinal.
(i) If A ⊂α and sup A = α, then the order-type of A is at least cf α.

32
Part I. Basic Set Theory
(ii) If β0 ≤β1 ≤. . . ≤βξ ≤. . ., ξ < γ, is a nondecreasing γ-sequence of
ordinals in α and limξ→γ βξ = α, then cf γ = cf α.
Proof. (i) The order-type of A is the length of the increasing enumeration
of A which is an increasing sequence with limit α.
(ii) If γ = limν→cf γ ξ(ν), then α = limν→cf γ βξ(ν), and the nondecreasing
sequence ⟨βξ(ν) : ν < cf γ⟩has an increasing subsequence of length ≤cf γ,
with the same limit. Thus cf α ≤cf γ.
To show that cf γ ≤cf α, let α = limν→cf α αν. For each ν < cf α, let
ξ(ν) be the least ξ greater than all ξ(ι), ι < ν, such that βξ > αν. Since
limν→cf α βξ(ν) = α, it follows that limν→cf α ξ(ν) = γ, and so cf γ ≤cf α.
⊓⊔
An inﬁnite cardinal ℵα is regular if cf ωα = ωα. It is singular if cf ωα < ωα.
Lemma 3.8. For every limit ordinal α, cf α is a regular cardinal.
Proof. It is easy to see that if α is not a cardinal, then using a mapping
of |α| onto α, one can construct a coﬁnal sequence in α of length ≤|α|, and
therefore cf α < α.
Since cf(cf α) = cf α, it follows that cf α is a cardinal and is regular.
⊓⊔
Let κ be a limit ordinal. A subset X ⊂κ is bounded if sup X < κ, and
unbounded if sup X = κ.
Lemma 3.9. Let κ be an aleph.
(i) If X ⊂κ and |X| < cf κ then X is bounded.
(ii) If λ < cf κ and f : λ →κ then the range of f is bounded.
It follows from (i) that every unbounded subset of a regular cardinal has
cardinality κ.
Proof. (i) Lemma 3.7(i).
(ii) If X = ran(f) then |X| ≤λ, and use (i).
⊓⊔
There are arbitrarily large singular cardinals. For each α, ℵα+ω is a sin-
gular cardinal of coﬁnality ω.
Using the Axiom of Choice, we shall show in Chapter 5 that every ℵα+1
is regular. (The Axiom of Choice is necessary.)
Lemma 3.10. An inﬁnite cardinal κ is singular if and only if there exists
a cardinal λ < κ and a family {Sξ : ξ < λ} of subsets of κ such that |Sξ| < κ
for each ξ < λ, and κ = 
ξ<λ Sξ. The least cardinal λ that satisﬁes the
condition is cf κ.
Proof. If κ is singular, then there is an increasing sequence ⟨αξ : ξ < cf κ⟩
with limξ αξ = κ. Let λ = cf κ, and Sξ = αξ for all ξ < λ.
If the condition holds, let λ < κ be the least cardinal for which there is
a family {Sξ : ξ < λ} such that κ = 
ξ<λ Sξ and |Sξ| < κ for each ξ < λ. For

3. Cardinal Numbers
33
every ξ < λ, let βξ be the order-type of 
ν<ξ Sν. The sequence ⟨βξ : ξ < λ⟩
is nondecreasing, and by the minimality of λ, βξ < κ for all ξ < λ. We shall
show that limξ βξ = κ, thus proving that cf κ ≤λ.
Let β = limξ→λ βξ. There is a one-to-one mapping f of κ = 
ξ<λ Sξ into
λ × β: If α ∈κ, let f(α) = (ξ, γ), where ξ is the least ξ such that α ∈Sξ and
γ is the order-type of Sξ ∩α. Since λ < κ and |λ × β| = λ · |β|, it follows that
β = κ.
⊓⊔
One cannot prove without the Axiom of Choice that ω1 is not a countable
union of countable sets. Compare this with Exercise 3.13
The only cardinal inequality we have proved so far is Cantor’s Theorem
κ < 2κ. It follows that κ < λκ for every λ > 1, and in particular κ < κκ
(for κ ̸= 1). The following theorem gives a better inequality. This and other
cardinal inequalities will also follow from K¨onig’s Theorem 5.10, to be proved
in Chapter 5.
Theorem 3.11. If κ is an inﬁnite cardinal, then κ < κcf κ.
Proof. Let F be a collection of κ functions from cf κ to κ: F = {fα : α < κ}.
It is enough to ﬁnd f : cf κ →κ that is diﬀerent from all the fα. Let κ =
limξ→cf κ αξ. For ξ < cf κ, let
f(ξ) = least γ such that γ ̸= fα(ξ) for all α < αξ.
Such γ exists since |{fα(ξ) : α < αξ}| ≤|αξ| < κ. Obviously, f ̸= fα for all
α < κ.
⊓⊔
Consequently, κλ > κ whenever λ ≥cf κ.
An uncountable cardinal κ is weakly inaccessible if it is a limit cardinal
and is regular. There will be more about inaccessible cardinals later, but let
me mention at this point that existence of (weakly) inaccessible cardinals is
not provable in ZFC.
To get an idea of the size of an inaccessible cardinal, note that if ℵα > ℵ0
is limit and regular, then ℵα = cf ℵα = cf α ≤α, and so ℵα = α.
Since the sequence of alephs is a normal sequence, it has arbitrarily large
ﬁxed points; the problem is whether some of them are regular cardinals. For
instance, the least ﬁxed point ℵα = α has coﬁnality ω:
κ = lim⟨ω, ωω, ωωω, . . .⟩= limn→ω κn
where κ0 = ω, κn+1 = ωκn.

We say that a set B is a projection of a set A if there is a mapping of A onto B.
Note that B is a projection of A if and only if there is a partition P of A such
that |P| = |B|. If |A| ≥|B| > 0, then B is a projection of A. Conversely, using the
Axiom of Choice, one shows that if B is a projection of A, then |A| ≥|B|. This,
however, cannot be proved without the Axiom of Choice.
3.7. If B is a projection of ωα, then |B| ≤ℵα.
3.8. The set of all ﬁnite subsets of ωα has cardinality ℵα.
[The set is a projection of the set of ﬁnite sequences.]
3.9. If B is a projection of A, then |P(B)| ≤|P(A)|.
[Consider g(X) = f−1(X), where f maps A onto B.]
3.10. ωα+1 is a projection of P(ωα).
[Use |ωα × ωα| = ωα and project P(ωα × ωα): If R ⊂ωα × ωα is a well-ordering,
let f(R) be its order-type.]
3.11. ℵα+1 < 22ℵα .
[Use Exercises 3.10 and 3.9.]
3.12. If ℵα is an uncountable limit cardinal, then cf ωα = cf α; ωα is the limit of
a coﬁnal sequence ⟨ωξ : ξ < cf α⟩of cardinals.
3.13 (ZF). Show that ω2 is not a countable union of countable sets.
[Assume that ω2 = S
n<ω Sn with Sn countable and let αn be the order-type
of Sn. Then α = supn αn ≤ω1 and there is a mapping of ω × α onto ω2.]
A set S is Dedekind-ﬁnite (D-ﬁnite) if there is no one-to-one mapping of S
onto a proper subset of S. Every ﬁnite set is D-ﬁnite. Using the Axiom of Choice,
one proves that every inﬁnite set is D-inﬁnite, and so D-ﬁniteness is the same as
ﬁniteness. Without the Axiom of Choice, however, one cannot prove that every
D-ﬁnite set is ﬁnite.
The set N of all natural numbers is D-inﬁnite and hence every S such that
|S| ≥ℵ0, is D-inﬁnite.

3.14. S is D-inﬁnite if and only if S has a countable subset.
[If S is D-inﬁnite, let f : S →X ⊂S be one-to-one. Let x0 ∈S −X and
xn+1 = f(xn). Then S ⊃{xn : n < ω}.]
3.15.
(i) If A and B are D-ﬁnite, then A ∪B and A × B are D-ﬁnite.
(ii) The set of all ﬁnite one-to-one sequences in a D-ﬁnite set is D-ﬁnite.
(iii) The union of a disjoint D-ﬁnite family of D-ﬁnite sets is D-ﬁnite.
On the other hand, one cannot prove without the Axiom of Choice that a pro-
jection, power set, or the set of all ﬁnite subsets of a D-ﬁnite set is D-ﬁnite, or that
the union of a D-ﬁnite family of D-ﬁnite sets is D-ﬁnite.
3.16. If A is an inﬁnite set, then PP(A) is D-inﬁnite.
[Consider the set {{X ⊂A : |X| = n} : n < ω}.]
Historical Notes
Cardinal numbers and alephs were introduced by Cantor. The proof of the Cantor-
Bernstein Theorem is Bernstein’s; see Borel [1898], p. 103. (There is an earlier proof
by Dedekind.) The ﬁrst proof of ℵα·ℵα = ℵα appeared in Hessenberg [1906], p. 593.
Regularity of cardinals was investigated by Hausdorﬀ, who also raised the question
of existence of regular limit cardinals. D-ﬁniteness was formulated by Dedekind.

4. Real Numbers
The set of all real numbers R (the real line or the continuum) is the unique
ordered ﬁeld in which every nonempty bounded set has a least upper bound.
The proof of the following theorem marks the beginning of Cantor’s theory
of sets.
Theorem 4.1 (Cantor). The set of all real numbers is uncountable.
Proof. Let us assume that the set R of all reals is countable, and let c0,
c1, . . . , cn, . . . , n ∈N, be an enumeration of R. We shall ﬁnd a real number
diﬀerent from each cn.
Let a0 = c0 and b0 = ck0 where k0 is the least k such that a0 < ck.
For each n, let an+1 = cin where in is the least i such that an < ci < bn,
and bn+1 = ckn where kn is the least k such that an+1 < ck < bn. If we let
a = sup{an : n ∈N}, then a ̸= ck for all k.
⊓⊔
The Cardinality of the Continuum
Let c denote the cardinality of R. As the set Q of all rational numbers is
dense in R, every real number r is equal to sup{q ∈Q : q < r} and because
Q is countable, it follows that c ≤|P(Q)| = 2ℵ0.
Let C (the Cantor set) be the set of all reals of the form ∞
n=1 an/3n,
where each an = 0 or 2. C is obtained by removing from the closed interval
[0, 1], the open intervals ( 1
3, 2
3), ( 1
9, 2
9), ( 7
9, 8
9), etc. (the middle-third intervals).
C is in a one-to-one correspondence with the set of all ω-sequences of 0’s
and 2’s and so |C| = 2ℵ0.
Therefore c ≥2ℵ0, and so by the Cantor-Bernstein Theorem we have
(4.1)
c = 2ℵ0.
By Cantor’s Theorem 4.1 (or by Theorem 3.1), c > ℵ0. Cantor conjectured
that every set of reals is either at most countable or has cardinality of the
continuum. In ZFC, every inﬁnite cardinal is an aleph, and so 2ℵ0 ≥ℵ1.
Cantor’s conjecture then becomes the statement
2ℵ0 = ℵ1
known as the Continuum Hypothesis (CH).

38
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Among sets of cardinality c are the set of all sequences of natural numbers,
the set of all sequences of real numbers, the set of all complex numbers. This
is because ℵℵ0
0
= (2ℵ0)ℵ0 = 2ℵ0, 2ℵ0 · 2ℵ0 = 2ℵ0.
Cantor’s proof of Theorem 4.1 yielded more than uncountability of R; it
showed that the set of all transcendental numbers has cardinality c (cf. Ex-
ercise 4.5).
The Ordering of R
A linear ordering (P, <) is complete if every nonempty bounded subset of P
has a least upper bound. We stated above that R is the unique complete
ordered ﬁeld. We shall generally disregard the ﬁeld properties of R and will
concern ourselves more with the order properties.
One consequence of being a complete ordered ﬁeld is that R contains the
set Q of all rational numbers as a dense subset. The set Q is countable and
its ordering is dense.
Deﬁnition 4.2. A linear ordering (P, <) is dense if for all a < b there exists
a c such that a < c < b.
A set D ⊂P is a dense subset if for all a < b in P there exists a d ∈D
such that a < d < b.
The following theorem proves the uniqueness of the ordered set (R, <).
We say that an ordered set is unbounded if it has neither a least nor a greatest
element.
Theorem 4.3 (Cantor).
(i) Any two countable unbounded dense linearly ordered sets are isomor-
phic.
(ii) (R, <) is the unique complete linear ordering that has a countable
dense subset isomorphic to (Q, <).
Proof. (i) Let P1 = {an : n ∈N} and let P2 = {bn : n ∈N} be two
such linearly ordered sets. We construct an isomorphism f : P1 →P2 in the
following way: We ﬁrst deﬁne f(a0), then f −1(b0), then f(a1), then f −1(b1),
etc., so as to keep f order-preserving. For example, to deﬁne f(an), if it is not
yet deﬁned, we let f(an) = bk where k is the least index such that f remains
order-preserving (such a k always exists because f has been deﬁned for only
ﬁnitely many a ∈P1, and because P2 is dense and unbounded).
(ii) To prove the uniqueness of R, let C and C′ be two complete dense
unbounded linearly ordered sets, let P and P ′ be dense in C and C′, re-
spectively, and let f be an isomorphism of P onto P ′. Then f can be
extended (uniquely) to an isomorphism f ∗of C and C′: For x ∈C, let
f ∗(x) = sup{f(p) : p ∈P and p ≤x}.
⊓⊔

4. Real Numbers
39
The existence of (R, <) is proved by means of Dedekind cuts in (Q, <).
The following theorem is a general version of this construction:
Theorem 4.4. Let (P, <) be a dense unbounded linearly ordered set. Then
there is a complete unbounded linearly ordered set (C, ≺) such that:
(i) P ⊂C, and < and ≺agree on P;
(ii) P is dense in C.
Proof. A Dedekind cut in P is a pair (A, B) of disjoint nonempty subsets
of P such that
(i) A ∪B = P;
(ii) a < b for any a ∈A and b ∈B;
(iii) A does not have a greatest element.
Let C be the set of all Dedekind cuts in P and let (A1, B1) ≼(A2, B2) if
A1 ⊂A2 (and B1 ⊃B2). The set C is complete: If {(Ai, Bi) : i ∈I} is
a nonempty bounded subset of C, then (
i∈I Ai, 
i∈I Bi) is its supremum.
For p ∈P, let
Ap = {x ∈P : x < p},
Bp = {x ∈P : x ≥p}.
Then P ′ = {(Ap, Bp) : p ∈P} is isomorphic to P and is dense in C.
⊓⊔
Suslin’s Problem
The real line is, up to isomorphism, the unique linearly ordered set that is
dense, unbounded, complete and contains a countable dense subset.
Since Q is dense in R, every nonempty open interval of R contains a ra-
tional number. Hence if S is a disjoint collection of open intervals, S is at
most countable. (Let ⟨rn : n ∈N⟩be an enumeration of the rationals. To
each J ∈S assign rn ∈J with the least possible index n.)
Let P be a dense linearly ordered set. If every disjoint collection of open
intervals in P is at most countable, then we say that P satisﬁes the countable
chain condition.
Suslin’s Problem. Let P be a complete dense unbounded linearly ordered
set that satisﬁes the countable chain condition. Is P isomorphic to the real
line?
This question cannot be decided in ZFC; we shall return to the problem
in Chapter 9.

40
Part I. Basic Set Theory
The Topology of the Real Line
The real line is a metric space with the metric d(a, b) = |a −b|. Its metric
topology coincides with the order topology of (R, <). Since Q is a dense
set in R and since every Cauchy sequence of real numbers converges, R is
a separable complete metric space. (A metric space is separable if it has
a countable dense set; it is complete if every Cauchy sequence converges.)
Open sets are unions of open intervals, and in fact, every open set is the
union of open intervals with rational endpoints. This implies that the number
of all open sets in R is the continuum and so is the number of all closed sets
in R (Exercise 4.6).
Every open interval has cardinality c, therefore every nonempty open
set has cardinality c. We show below that every uncountable closed set has
cardinality c. Proving this was Cantor’s ﬁrst step in the search for the proof of
the Continuum Hypothesis. In Chapter 11 we show that CH holds for Borel
and analytic sets as well.
A nonempty closed set is perfect if it has no isolated points. Theorems 4.5
and 4.6 below show that every uncountable closed set contains a perfect set.
Theorem 4.5. Every perfect set has cardinality c.
Proof. Given a perfect set P, we want to ﬁnd a one-to-one function F from
{0, 1}ω into P. Let S be the set of all ﬁnite sequences of 0’s and 1’s. By
induction on the length of s ∈S one can ﬁnd closed intervals Is such that
for each n and all s ∈S of length n,
(i) Is ∩P is perfect,
(ii) the diameter of Is is ≤1/n,
(iii) Is⌢0 ⊂Is, Is⌢1 ⊂Is and Is⌢0 ∩Is⌢1 = ∅.
For each f ∈{0, 1}ω, the set P ∩∞
n=0 If↾n has exactly one element, and we
let F(f) to be this element of P.
⊓⊔
The same proof gives a more general result: Every perfect set in a sepa-
rable complete metric space contains a closed copy of the Cantor set (Exer-
cise 4.19).
Theorem 4.6 (Cantor-Bendixson). If F is an uncountable closed set,
then F = P ∪S, where P is perfect and S is at most countable.
Corollary 4.7. If F is a closed set, then either |F| ≤ℵ0 or |F| = 2ℵ0.
⊓⊔
Proof. For every A ⊂R, let
A′ = the set of all limit points of A
It is easy to see that A′ is closed, and if A is closed then A′ ⊂A. Thus we let
F0 = F,
Fα+1 = F ′
α,
Fα =

γ<α
Fγ
if α > 0 is a limit ordinal.

4. Real Numbers
41
Since F0 ⊃F1 ⊃. . . ⊃Fα ⊃. . ., there exists an ordinal θ such that Fα = Fθ
for all α ≥θ. (In fact, the least θ with this property must be countable, by
the argument below.) We let P = Fθ.
If P is nonempty, then P ′ = P and so it is perfect. Thus the proof is
completed by showing that F −P is at most countable.
Let ⟨Jk : k ∈N⟩be an enumeration of rational intervals. We have F −P =

α<θ(Fα −F ′
α); hence if a ∈F −P, then there is a unique α such that a is
an isolated point of Fα. We let k(a) be the least k such that a is the only
point of Fα in the interval Jk. Note that if α ≤β, b ̸= a and b ∈Fβ −F ′
β,
then b /∈Jk(a), and hence k(b) ̸= k(a). Thus the correspondence a →k(a) is
one-to-one, and it follows that F −P is at most countable.
⊓⊔
A set of reals is called nowhere dense if its closure has empty interior. The
following theorem shows that R is not the union of countably many nowhere
dense sets (R is not of the ﬁrst category).
Theorem 4.8 (The Baire Category Theorem). If D0, D1, . . ., Dn, . . .,
n ∈N, are dense open sets of reals, then the intersection D = ∞
n=0 Dn is
dense in R.
Proof. We show that D intersects every nonempty open interval I. First
note that for each n, D0 ∩. . . ∩Dn is dense and open. Let ⟨Jk : k ∈N⟩
be an enumeration of rational intervals. Let I0 = I, and let, for each n,
In+1 = Jk = (qk, rk), where k is the least k such that the closed interval
[qk, rk] is included in In ∩Dn. Then a ∈D ∩I, where a = limk→∞qk.
⊓⊔
Borel Sets
Deﬁnition 4.9. An algebra of sets is a collection S of subsets of a given
set S such that
(i) S ∈S,
(ii) if X ∈S and Y ∈S then X ∪Y ∈S,
(iii) if X ∈S then S −X ∈S.
(4.2)
(Note that S is also closed under intersections.)
A σ-algebra is additionally closed under countable unions (and intersec-
tions):
(iv) If Xn ∈S for all n, then ∞
n=0 Xn ∈S.
For any collection X of subsets of S there is a smallest algebra (σ-alge-
bra) S such that S ⊃X; namely the intersection of all algebras (σ-algebras) S
of subsets of S for which X ⊂S.
Deﬁnition 4.10. A set of reals B is Borel if it belongs to the smallest σ-
algebra B of sets of reals that contains all open sets.

42
Part I. Basic Set Theory
In Chapter 11 we investigate Borel sets in more detail. In particular, we
shall classify Borel sets by deﬁning a hierarchy of ω1 levels. For that we need
however a weak version of the Axiom of Choice that is not provable in ZF
alone. At this point we mention the lowest level of the hierarchy (beyond
open sets and closed sets): The intersections of countably many open sets
are called Gδ sets, and the unions of countably many closed sets are called
Fσ sets.
Lebesgue Measure
We assume that the reader is familiar with the basic theory of Lebesgue
measure. As we shall return to the subject in Chapter 11 we do not deﬁne
the concept of measure at this point. We also caution the reader that some
of the basic theorems on Lebesgue measure require the Countable Axiom of
Choice (to be discussed in Chapter 5).
Lebesgue measurable sets form a σ-algebra and contain all open intervals
(the measure of an interval is its length). Thus all Borel sets are Lebesgue
measurable.
The Baire Space
The Baire space is the space N = ωω of all inﬁnite sequences of natural
numbers, ⟨an : n ∈N⟩, with the following topology: For every ﬁnite sequence
s = ⟨ak : k < n⟩, let
(4.3)
O(s) = {f ∈N : s ⊂f} = {⟨ck : k ∈N⟩: (∀k < n) ck = ak}.
The sets (4.3) form a basis for the topology of N. Note that each O(s) is also
closed.
The Baire space is separable and is metrizable: consider the metric
d(f, g) = 1/2n+1 where n is the least number such that f(n) ̸= g(n). The
countable set of all eventually constant sequences is dense in N. This sepa-
rable metric space is complete, as every Cauchy sequence converges.
Every inﬁnite sequence ⟨an : n ∈N⟩of positive integers deﬁnes a con-
tinued fraction 1/(a0 + 1/(a1 + 1/(a2 + . . .))), an irrational number between
0 and 1. Conversely, every irrational number in the interval (0, 1) can be
so represented, and the one-to-one correspondence is a homeomorphism. It
follows that the Baire space is homeomorphic to the space of all irrational
numbers.
For various reasons, modern descriptive set theory uses the Baire space
rather than the real line. Often the functions in ωω are called reals.
Clearly, the space N satisﬁes the Baire Category Theorem; the proof is
similar to the proof of Theorem 4.8 above. The Cantor-Bendixson Theorem
holds as well. For completeness we give a description of perfect sets in N.

4. Real Numbers
43
Let Seq denote the set of all ﬁnite sequences of natural numbers. A (se-
quential) tree is a set T ⊂Seq that satisﬁes
(4.4)
if t ∈T and s = t↾n for some n, then s ∈T .
If T ⊂Seq is a tree, let [T ] be the set of all inﬁnite paths through T :
(4.5)
[T ] = {f ∈N : f↾n ∈T for all n ∈N}.
The set [T ] is a closed set in the Baire space: Let f ∈N be such that f /∈[T ].
Then there is n ∈N such that f↾n = s is not in T . In other words, the open
set O(s) = {g ∈N : g ⊃s}, a neighborhood of f, is disjoint from [T ]. Hence
[T ] is closed.
Conversely, if F is a closed set in N, then the set
(4.6)
TF = {s ∈Seq : s ⊂f for some f ∈F}
is a tree, and it is easy to verify that [TF ] = F: If f ∈N is such that f↾n ∈T
for all n ∈N, then for each n there is some g ∈F such that g↾n = f↾n; and
since F is closed, it follows that f ∈F.
If f is an isolated point of a closed set F in N, then there is n ∈N such
that there is no g ∈F, g ̸= f, such that g↾n = f↾n. Thus the following
deﬁnition:
A nonempty sequential tree T is perfect if for every t ∈T there exist
s1 ⊃t and s2 ⊃t, both in T , that are incomparable, i.e., neither s1 ⊃s2 nor
s2 ⊃s1.
Lemma 4.11. A closed set F ⊂N is perfect if and only if the tree TF is
a perfect tree.
⊓⊔
The Cantor-Bendixson analysis for closed sets in the Baire space is carried
out as follows: For each tree T ⊂Seq, we let
(4.7)
T ′ = {t ∈T : there exist incomparable s1 ⊃t and s2 ⊃t in T}.
(Thus T is perfect if and only if ∅̸= T = T ′.)
The set [T ]−[T ′] is at most countable: For each f ∈[T ] such that f /∈[T ′],
let sf = f↾n where n is the least number such that f↾n /∈T ′. If f, g ∈
[T ] −[T ′], then sf ̸= sg, by (4.7). Hence the mapping f →sf is one-to-one
and [T ] −[T ′] is at most countable.
Now we let
(4.8)
T0 = T,
Tα+1 = T ′
α,
Tα =

β<α
Tβ
if α > 0 is a limit ordinal.
Since T0 ⊃T1 ⊃. . . ⊃Tα ⊃. . ., and T0 is at most countable, there is an
ordinal θ < ω1 such that Tθ+1 = Tθ. If Tθ ̸= ∅, then it is perfect.

44
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Now it is easy to see that
	
β<α Tβ

= 
β<α[Tβ], and so
(4.9)
[T ] −[Tθ] = 
α<θ
([Tα] −[T ′
α]);
hence (4.9) is at most countable. Thus if [T ] is an uncountable closed set
in N, the sets [Tθ] and [T ] −[Tθ] constitute the decomposition of [T ] into
a perfect and an at most countable set.
In modern descriptive set theory one often speaks about the Lebesgue
measure on N. This measure is the extension of the product measure m on
Borel sets in the Baire space induced by the probability measure on N that
gives the singleton {n} measure 1/2n+1. Thus for every sequence s ∈Seq of
length n ≥1 we have
(4.10)
m(O(s)) =
n−1

k=0
1/2s(k)+1.
Polish Spaces
Deﬁnition 4.12. A Polish space is a topological space that is homeomorphic
to a separable complete metric space.
Examples of Polish spaces include R, N, the Cantor space, the unit in-
terval [0, 1], the unit circle T , the Hilbert cube [0, 1]ω, etc.
Every Polish space is a continuous image of the Baire space. In Chapter 11
we prove a somewhat more general statement.

5. The Axiom of Choice and Cardinal
Arithmetic
The Axiom of Choice
Axiom of Choice (AC). Every family of nonempty sets has a choice func-
tion.
If S is a family of sets and ∅/∈S, then a choice function for S is a func-
tion f on S such that
(5.1)
f(X) ∈X
for every X ∈S.
The Axiom of Choice postulates that for every S such that ∅/∈S there
exists a function f on S that satisﬁes (5.1).
The Axiom of Choice diﬀers from other axioms of ZF by postulating
the existence of a set (i.e., a choice function) without deﬁning it (unlike,
for instance, the Axiom of Pairing or the Axiom of Power Set). Thus it is
often interesting to know whether a mathematical statement can be proved
without using the Axiom of Choice. It turns out that the Axiom of Choice is
independent of the other axioms of set theory and that many mathematical
theorems are unprovable in ZF without AC.
In some trivial cases, the existence of a choice function can be proved
outright in ZF:
(i) when every X ∈S is a singleton X = {x};
(ii) when S is ﬁnite; the existence of a choice function for S is proved by
induction on the size of S;
(iii) when every X ∈S is a ﬁnite set of real numbers; let f(X) = the least
element of X.
On the other hand, one cannot prove existence of a choice function (in ZF)
just from the assumption that the sets in S are ﬁnite; even when every X ∈S
has just two elements (e.g., sets of reals), we cannot necessarily prove that
S has a choice function.
Using the Axiom of Choice, one proves that every set can be well-ordered,
and therefore every inﬁnite set has cardinality equal to some ℵα. In particular,

48
Part I. Basic Set Theory
any two sets have comparable cardinals, and the ordering
|X| ≤|Y |
is a well-ordering of the class of all cardinals.
Theorem 5.1 (Zermelo’s Well-Ordering Theorem). Every set can be
well-ordered.
Proof. Let A be a set. To well-order A, it suﬃces to construct a transﬁnite
one-to-one sequence ⟨aα : α < θ⟩that enumerates A. That we can do by
induction, using a choice function f for the family S of all nonempty subsets
of A. We let for every α
aα = f(A −{aξ : ξ < α})
if A −{aξ : ξ < α} is nonempty. Let θ be the least ordinal such that A =
{aξ : ξ < θ}. Clearly, ⟨aα : α < θ⟩enumerates A.
⊓⊔
In fact, Zermelo’s Theorem 5.1 is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice:
If every set can be well-ordered, then every family S of nonempty sets has
a choice function. To see this, well-order  S and let f(X) be the least element
of X for every X ∈S.
Of particular importance is the fact that the set of all real numbers can
be well-ordered. It follows that 2ℵ0 is an aleph and so 2ℵ0 ≥ℵ1.
The existence of a well-ordering of R yields some interesting counterex-
amples. Well known is Vitali’s construction of a nonmeasurable set (Exer-
cise 10.1); another example is an uncountable set of reals without a perfect
subset (Exercise 5.1).
If every set can be well-ordered, then every inﬁnite set has a countable
subset: Well-order the set and take the ﬁrst ω elements. Thus every inﬁnite
set is Dedekind-inﬁnite, and so ﬁniteness and Dedekind ﬁniteness coincide.
Dealing with cardinalities of sets is much easier when we have the Axiom
of Choice. In the ﬁrst place, any two sets have comparable cardinals. Another
consequence is:
(5.2)
if f maps A onto B then |B| ≤|A|.
To show (5.2), we have to ﬁnd a one-to-one function from B to A. This is
done by choosing one element from f−1({b}) for each b ∈B.
Another consequence of the Axiom of Choice is:
(5.3)
The union of a countable family of countable sets is countable.
(By the way, this often used fact cannot be proved in ZF alone.) To prove (5.3)
let An be a countable set for each n ∈N. For each n, let us choose an

5. The Axiom of Choice and Cardinal Arithmetic
49
enumeration ⟨an,k : k ∈N⟩of An. That gives us a projection of N ×N onto
∞
n=0 An:
(n, k) →an,k.
Thus ∞
n=0 An is countable.
In a similar fashion, one can prove a more general statement.
Lemma 5.2. |  S| ≤|S| · sup{|X| : X ∈S}.
Proof. Let κ = |S| and λ = sup{|X| : X ∈S}. We have S = {Xα : α < κ}
and for each α < κ, we choose an enumeration Xα = {aα,β : β < λα}, where
λα ≤λ. Again we have a projection
(α, β) →aα,β
of κ × λ onto  S, and so |  S| ≤κ · λ.
⊓⊔
In particular, the union of ℵα sets, each of cardinality ℵα, has cardinal-
ity ℵα.
Corollary 5.3. Every ℵα+1 is a regular cardinal.
Proof. This is because otherwise ωα+1 would be the union of at most ℵα sets
of cardinality at most ℵα.
⊓⊔
Using the Axiom of Choice in Mathematics
In algebra and point set topology, one often uses the following version of
the Axiom of Choice. We recall that if (P, <) is a partially ordered set, then
a ∈P is called maximal in P if there is no x ∈P such that a < x. If X is
a nonempty subset of P, then c ∈P is an upper bound of X if x ≤c for every
x ∈X.
We say that a nonempty C ⊂P is a chain in P if C is linearly ordered
by <.
Theorem 5.4 (Zorn’s Lemma). If (P, <) is a nonempty partially ordered
set such that every chain in P has an upper bound, then P has a maximal
element.
Proof. We construct (using a choice function for nonempty subsets of P),
a chain in P that leads to a maximal element of P. We let, by induction,
aα = an element of P such that aα > aξ for every ξ < α if there is one.
Clearly, if α > 0 is a limit ordinal, then Cα = {aξ : ξ < α} is a chain in P
and aα exists by the assumption. Eventually, there is θ such that there is no
aθ+1 ∈P, aθ+1 > aθ. Thus aθ is a maximal element of P.
⊓⊔

Part I. Basic Set Theory
Like Zermelo’s Theorem 5.1, Zorn’s Lemma 5.4 is equivalent to the Axiom
of Choice (in ZF); see Exercise 5.5.
There are numerous examples of proofs using Zorn’s Lemma. To mention
only of few:
Every vector space has a basis.
Every ﬁeld has a unique algebraic closure.
The Hahn-Banach Extension Theorem.
Tikhonov’s Product Theorem for compact spaces.
The Countable Axiom of Choice
Many important consequences of the Axiom of Choice, particularly many
concerning the real numbers, can be proved from a weaker version of the
Axiom of Choice.
The Countable Axiom of Choice. Every countable family of nonempty
sets has a choice function.
For instance, the countable AC implies that the union of countably many
countable sets is countable. In particular, the real line is not a countable
union of countable sets. Similarly, it follows that ℵ1 is a regular cardinal. On
the other hand, the countable AC does not imply that the set of all reals can
be well-ordered.
Several basic theorems about Borel sets and Lebesgue measure use the
countable AC; for instance, one needs it to show that the union of count-
ably many Fσ sets is Fσ. In modern descriptive set theory one often works
without the Axiom of Choice and uses the countable AC instead. In some
instances, descriptive set theorists use a somewhat stronger principle (that
follows from AC):
The Principle of Dependent Choices (DC). If E is a binary relation
on a nonempty set A, and if for every a ∈A there exists b ∈A such that
b E a, then there is a sequence a0, a1, . . ., an, . . . in A such that
(5.4)
an+1 E an
for all n ∈N.
The Principle of Dependent Choices is stronger than the Countable Axiom
of Choice; see Exercise 5.7.
As an application of DC we have the following characterization of well-
founded relations and well-orderings:
Lemma 5.5.
(i) A linear ordering < of a set P is a well-ordering of P if and only if
there is no inﬁnite descending sequence
a0 > a1 > . . . > an > . . .
in A.

5. The Axiom of Choice and Cardinal Arithmetic
51
(ii) A relation E on P is well-founded if and only if there is no inﬁnite
sequence ⟨an : n ∈N⟩in P such that
(5.5)
an+1 E an
for all n ∈N.
Proof. Note that (i) is a special case of (ii) since a well-ordering is a well-
founded linear ordering.
If a0, a1, . . . , an, . . . is a sequence that satisﬁes (5.5), then the set {an :
n ∈N} has no E-minimal element and hence E is not well-founded.
Conversely, if E is not well-founded, then there is a nonempty set A ⊂P
with no E-minimal element. Using the Principle of Dependent Choices we
construct a sequence a0, a1, . . . , an, . . . that satisﬁes (5.5).
⊓⊔
Cardinal Arithmetic
In the presence of the Axiom of Choice, every set can be well-ordered and so
every inﬁnite set has the cardinality of some ℵα. Thus addition and multipli-
cation of inﬁnite cardinal numbers is simple: If κ and λ are inﬁnite cardinals
then
κ + λ = κ · λ = max{κ, λ}.
The exponentiation of cardinals is more interesting. The rest of Chapter 5 is
devoted to the operations 2κ and κλ, for inﬁnite cardinals κ and λ.
Lemma 5.6. If 2 ≤κ ≤λ and λ is inﬁnite, then κλ = 2λ.
Proof.
2λ ≤κλ ≤(2κ)λ = 2κ·λ = 2λ.
⊓⊔
(5.6)
If κ and λ are inﬁnite cardinals and λ < κ then the evaluation of κλ
is more complicated. First, if 2λ ≥κ then we have κλ = 2λ (because κλ ≤
(2λ)λ = 2λ), but if 2λ < κ then (because κλ ≤κκ = 2κ) we can only conclude
(5.7)
κ ≤κλ ≤2κ.
Not much more can be claimed at this point, except that by Theorem 3.11
in Chapter 3 (κcf κ > κ) we have
(5.8)
κ < κλ
if λ ≥cf κ.
If λ is a cardinal and |A| ≥λ, let
(5.9)
[A]λ = {X ⊂A : |X| = λ}.
Lemma 5.7. If |A| = κ ≥λ, then the set [A]λ has cardinality κλ.

52
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Proof. On the one hand, every f : λ →A is a subset of λ × A, and |f| = λ.
Thus κλ ≤|[λ × A]|λ = |[A]λ|. On the other hand, we construct a one-to-one
function F : [A]λ →Aλ as follows: If X ⊂A and |X| = λ, let F(X) be some
function f on λ whose range is X. Clearly, F is one-to-one.
⊓⊔
If λ is a limit cardinal, let
(5.10)
κ<λ = sup{κµ : µ is a cardinal and µ < λ}.
For the sake of completeness, we also deﬁne κ<λ+ = κλ for inﬁnite successor
cardinals λ+.
If κ is an inﬁnite cardinal and |A| ≥κ, let
(5.11)
[A]<κ = Pκ(A) = {X ⊂A : |X| < κ}.
It follows from Lemma 5.7 and Lemma 5.8 below that the cardinality of
Pκ(A) is |A|<κ.
Inﬁnite Sums and Products
Let {κi : i ∈I} be an indexed set of cardinal numbers. We deﬁne
(5.12)

i∈I
κi =


i∈I
Xi
,
where {Xi : i ∈I} is a disjoint family of sets such that |Xi| = κi for each
i ∈I.
This deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of {Xi}i; this follows from
the Axiom of Choice (see Exercise 5.9).
Note that if κ and λ are cardinals and κi = κ for each i < λ, then

i<λ
κi = λ · κ.
In general, we have the following
Lemma 5.8. If λ is an inﬁnite cardinal and κi > 0 for each i < λ, then
(5.13)

i<λ
κi = λ · supi<λ κi.
Proof. Let κ = supi<λ κi and σ = 
i<λ κi. On the one hand, since κi ≤κ
for all i, we have 
i<λ κ ≤λ·κ. On the other hand, since κi ≥1 for all i, we
have λ = 
i<λ 1 ≤σ, and since σ ≥κi for all i, we have σ ≥supi<λ κi = κ.
Therefore σ ≥λ · κ.
⊓⊔

5. The Axiom of Choice and Cardinal Arithmetic
53
In particular, if λ ≤supi<λ κi, we have

i<λ
κi = supi<λ κi.
Thus we can characterize singular cardinals as follows: An inﬁnite cardinal κ
is singular just in case
κ = 
i<λ
κi
where λ < κ and for each i, κi < κ.
An inﬁnite product of cardinals is deﬁned using inﬁnite products of sets.
If {Xi : i ∈I} is a family of sets, then the product is deﬁned as follows:
(5.14)

i∈I
Xi = {f : f is a function on I and f(i) ∈Xi for each i ∈I}.
Note that if some Xi is empty, then the product is empty. If all the Xi are
nonempty, then AC implies that the product is nonempty.
If {κi : i ∈I} is a family of cardinal numbers, we deﬁne
(5.15)

i∈I
κi =

i∈I
Xi
,
where {Xi : i ∈I} is a family of sets such that |Xi| = κi for each i ∈I.
(We abuse the notation by using  both for the product of sets and for the
product of cardinals.)
Again, it follows from AC that the deﬁnition does not depend on the
choice of the sets Xi (Exercise 5.10).
If κi = κ for each i ∈I, and |I| = λ, then 
i∈I κi = κλ. Also, inﬁnite sums
and products satisfy some of the rules satisﬁed by ﬁnite sums and products.
For instance, 
i κλ
i = (
i κi)λ, or 
i κλi = κ
P
i λi. Or if I is a disjoint union
I = 
j∈J Aj, then
(5.16)

i∈I
κi = 
j∈J
 
i∈Aj
κi

.
If κi ≥2 for each i ∈I, then
(5.17)

i∈I
κi ≤
i∈I
κi.
(The assumption κi ≥2 is necessary: 1+1 > 1·1.) If I is ﬁnite, then (5.17) is
certainly true; thus assume that I is inﬁnite. Since 
i∈I κi ≥
i∈I 2 = 2|I| >
|I|, it suﬃces to show that 
i κi ≤|I| · 
i κi. If {Xi : i ∈I} is a disjoint
family, we assign to each x ∈
i Xi a pair (i, f) such that x ∈Xi, f ∈
i Xi
and f(i) = x. Thus we have (5.17).
Inﬁnite product of cardinals can be evaluated using the following lemma:

54
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Lemma 5.9. If λ is an inﬁnite cardinal and ⟨κi : i < λ⟩is a nondecreasing
sequence of nonzero cardinals, then

i<λ
κi = (supi κi)λ.
Proof. Let κ = supi κi. Since κi ≤κ for each i < λ, we have

i<λ
κi ≤
i<λ
κ = κλ.
To prove that κλ ≤
i<λ κi, we consider a partition of λ into λ disjoint
sets Aj, each of cardinality λ:
(5.18)
λ = 
j<λ
Aj.
(To get a partition (5.18), we can, e.g., use the canonical pairing function
Γ : λ × λ →λ and let Aj = Γ(λ × {j}).) Since a product of nonzero cardinals
is greater than or equal to each factor, we have 
i∈Aj κi ≥supi∈Aj κi = κ,
for each j < λ. Thus, by (5.16),

i<λ
κi = 
j<λ
 
i∈Aj

j<λ
κ = κλ.
⊓⊔
The strict inequalities in cardinal arithmetic that we proved in Chapter 3
can be obtained as special cases of the following general theorem.
Theorem 5.10 (K¨onig). If κi < λi for every i ∈I, then

i∈I
κi < 
i∈I
λi.
Proof. We shall show that 
i κi ≱
i λi. Let Ti, i ∈I, be such that |Ti| = λi
for each i ∈I. It suﬃces to show that if Zi, i ∈I, are subsets of T = 
i∈I Ti,
and |Zi| ≤κi for each i ∈I, then 
i∈I Zi ̸= T .
For every i ∈I, let Si be the projection of Zi into the ith coordinate:
Si = {f(i) : f ∈Zi}.
Since |Zi| < |Ti|, we have Si ⊂Ti and Si ̸= Ti. Now let f ∈T be a function
such that f(i) /∈Si for every i ∈I. Obviously, f does not belong to any Zi,
i ∈I, and so 
i∈I Zi ̸= T .

The Continuum Function
Cantor’s Theorem 3.1 states that 2ℵα > ℵα, and therefore 2ℵα ≥ℵα+1, for
all α. The Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH) is the statement
2ℵα = ℵα+1
for all α. GCH is independent of the axioms of ZFC. Under the assumption
of GCH, cardinal exponentiation is evaluated as follows:
Theorem 5.15. If GCH holds and κ and λ are inﬁnite cardinals then:
(i) If κ ≤λ, then κλ = λ+.
(ii) If cf κ ≤λ < κ, then κλ = κ+.
(iii) If λ < cf κ, then κλ = κ.
Proof. (i) Lemma 5.6.
(ii) This follows from (5.7) and (5.8).
(iii) By Lemma 3.9(ii), the set κλ is the union of the sets αλ, α < κ, and
|αλ| ≤2|α|·λ = (|α| · λ)+ ≤κ.
⊓⊔
The beth function is deﬁned by induction:
ℶ0 = ℵ0,
ℶα+1 = 2ℶα,
ℶα = sup{ℶβ : β < α}
if α is a limit ordinal.
Thus GCH is equivalent to the statement ℶα = ℵα for all α.
We shall now investigate the general behavior of the continuum func-
tion 2κ, without assuming GCH.

56

Theorem 5.16.
(i) If κ < λ then 2κ ≤2λ.

2κ = 2

⊓⊔
For regular cardinals, the only conditions Theorem 5.16 places on the
continuum function are 2κ > κ and 2κ ≤2λ if κ < λ. We shall see that these
are the only restrictions on 2κ for regular κ that are provable in ZFC.
Corollary 5.17. If κ is a singular cardinal and if the continuum function is
eventually constant below κ, with value λ, then 2κ = λ.
Proof. If κ is a singular cardinal that satisﬁes the assumption of the theorem,
then there is µ such that cf κ ≤µ < κ and that 2<κ = λ = 2µ. Thus
2κ = (2<κ)cf κ = (2µ)cf κ = 2µ.
⊓⊔
The gimel function is the function
(5.19)(גκ) = κcf κ.
If κ is a limit cardinal and if the continuum function below κ is not
eventually constant, then the cardinal λ = 2<κ is a limit of a nondecreasing
sequence
λ = 2<κ = limα→κ 2|α|
of length κ. By Lemma 3.7(ii), we have
cf λ = cf κ.
Using Theorem 5.16(iii), we get
(5.20)
2κ = (2<κ)cf κ = λcf λ.
If κ is a regular cardinal, then κ = cf κ; and since 2κ = κκ, we have
(5.21)
2κ = κcf κ.
Thus (5.20) and (5.21) show that the continuum function can be deﬁned in
terms of the gimel function:
Corollary 5.18.
(i) If κ is a successor cardinal, then 2κ =(גκ).
(ii) If κ is a limit cardinal and if the continuum function below κ is even-
tually constant, then 2κ = 2<κ ·(גκ).
(iii) If κ is a limit cardinal and if the continuum function below κ is not
eventually constant, then 2κ =(ג2<κ).
⊓⊔

5. The Axiom of Choice and Cardinal Arithmetic
57
Cardinal Exponentiation
We shall now investigate the function κλ for inﬁnite cardinal numbers κ
and λ.
We start with the following observation: If κ is a regular cardinal and
λ < κ, then every function f : λ →κ is bounded (i.e., sup{f(ξ) : ξ < λ} < κ).
Thus
κλ = 
α<κ
αλ.
and so
κλ = 
α<κ
|α|λ.
In particular, if κ is a successor cardinal, we obtain the Hausdorﬀformula
(5.22)
ℵℵβ
α+1 = ℵℵβ
α · ℵα+1.
(Note that (5.22) holds for all α and β.)
In general, we can compute κλ using the following lemma. If κ is a limit
cardinal, we use the notation limα→κ αλ to abbreviate sup{µλ : µ is a cardinal
and µ < κ}.
Lemma 5.19. If κ is a limit cardinal, and λ ≥cf κ, then
κλ = (limα→κ αλ)cf κ.
Proof. Let κ = 
i<cf κ κi, where κi < κ for each i. We have κλ ≤
(
i<cf κ κi)λ = 
i κλ
i ≤
i(limα→κ αλ) = (limα→κ αλ)cf κ ≤(κλ)cf κ = κλ.
⊓⊔
Theorem 5.20. Let λ be an inﬁnite cardinal. Then for all inﬁnite cardi-
nals κ, the value of κλ is computed as follows, by induction on κ:
(i) If κ ≤λ then κλ = 2λ.
(ii) If there exists some µ < κ such that µλ ≥κ, then κλ = µλ.
(iii) If κ > λ and if µλ < κ for all µ < κ, then:
(a) if cf κ > λ then κλ = κ,
(b) if cf κ ≤λ then κλ = κcf κ.
Proof. (i) Lemma 5.6
(ii) µλ ≤κλ ≤(µλ)λ = µλ.
(iii) If κ is a successor cardinal, we use the Hausdorﬀformula. If κ is
a limit cardinal, we have limα→κ αλ = κ. If cf κ > λ then every f : λ →κ is
bounded and we have κλ = limα→κ αλ = κ. If cf κ ≤λ then by Lemma 5.19,
κλ = (limα→κ αλ)cf κ = κcf κ.
⊓⊔
Theorem 5.20 shows that all cardinal exponentiation can be deﬁned in
terms of the gimel function:

58
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Corollary 5.21. For every κ and λ, the value of κλ is either 2λ, or κ, or(גµ)
for some µ such that cf µ ≤λ < µ.
Proof. If κλ > 2λ · κ, let µ be the least cardinal such that µλ = κλ, and by
Theorem 5.20 (for µ and λ), µλ = µcf µ.
⊓⊔
In the Exercises, we list some properties of the gimel function.
A cardinal κ is a strong limit cardinal if
2λ < κ
for every λ < κ.
Obviously, every strong limit cardinal is a limit cardinal. If the GCH holds,
then every limit cardinal is a strong limit.
It is easy to see that if κ is a strong limit cardinal, then
λν < κ
for all λ, ν < κ.
An example of a strong limit cardinal is ℵ0. Actually, the strong limit cardi-
nals form a proper class: If α is an arbitrary cardinal, then the cardinal
κ = sup{α, 2α, 22α, . . . }
(of coﬁnality ω) is a strong limit cardinal.
Another fact worth mentioning is:
(5.23)
If κ is a strong limit cardinal, then 2κ = κcf κ.
We recall that κ is weakly inaccessible if it is uncountable, regular, and
limit. We say that a cardinal κ is inaccessible (strongly) if κ > ℵ0, κ is
regular, and κ is strong limit.
Every inaccessible cardinal is weakly inaccessible. If the GCH holds, then
every weakly inaccessible cardinal κ is inaccessible.
The inaccessible cardinals owe their name to the fact that they cannot be
obtained from smaller cardinals by the usual set-theoretical operations.
If κ is inaccessible and |X| < κ, then |P(X)| < κ. If |S| < κ and if |X| < κ
for every X ∈S, then |  S| < κ.
In fact, ℵ0 has this property too. Thus we can say that in a sense an
inaccessible cardinal is to smaller cardinals what ℵ0 is to ﬁnite cardinals.
This is one of the main themes of the theory of large cardinals.
The Singular Cardinal Hypothesis
The Singular Cardinal Hypothesis (SCH) is the statement: For every singular
cardinal κ, if 2cf κ < κ, then κcf κ = κ+.
Obviously, the Singular Cardinals Hypothesis follows from GCH. If 2cf κ ≥
κ then κcf κ = 2cf κ. If 2cf κ < κ, then κ+ is the least possible value of κcf κ.

5. The Axiom of Choice and Cardinal Arithmetic
59
We shall prove later in the book that if SCH fails then a large cardinal
axiom holds. In fact, the failure of SCH is equiconsistent with the existence
of a certain large cardinal.
Under the assumption of SCH, cardinal exponentiation is determined by
the continuum function on regular cardinals:
Theorem 5.22. Assume that SCH holds.
(i) If κ is a singular cardinal then
(a) 2κ = 2<κ if the continuum function is eventually constant below κ,
(b) 2κ = (2<κ)+ otherwise.
(ii) If κ and λ are inﬁnite cardinals, then:
(a) If κ ≤2λ then κλ = 2λ.
(b) If 2λ < κ and λ < cf κ then κλ = κ.
(c) If 2λ < κ and cf κ ≤λ then κλ = κ+.
Proof. (i) If κ is a singular cardinal, then by Theorem 5.16, 2κ is either λ
or λcf κ where λ = 2<κ. The latter occurs if 2α is not eventually constant
below κ. Then cf λ = cf κ, and since 2cf κ < 2<κ = λ, we have λcf λ = λ+ by
the Singular Cardinals Hypothesis.
(ii) We proceed by induction on κ, for a ﬁxed λ. Let κ > 2λ. If κ is
a successor cardinal, κ = ν+, then νλ ≤κ (by the induction hypothesis), and
κλ = (ν+)λ = ν+ · νλ = κ, by the Hausdorﬀformula.
If κ is a limit cardinal, then νλ < κ for all ν < κ. By Theorem 5.20, κλ = κ
if λ < cf κ, and κλ = κcf κ if λ ≥cf κ, In the latter case, 2cf κ ≤2λ < κ, and
by the Singular Cardinals Hypothesis, κcf κ = κ+.

Historical Notes
The Axiom of Choice was formulated by Zermelo, who used it to prove the Well-
Ordering Theorem in [1904]. Zorn’s Lemma is as in Zorn [1935]; for a related prin-
ciple, see Kuratowski [1922]. (Hausdorﬀin [1914], pp. 140–141, proved that every
partially ordered set has a maximal linearly ordered subset.) The Principle of De-
pendent Choices was formulated by Bernays in [1942].
K¨onig’s Theorem 5.10 appeared in J. K¨onig [1905]. Corollary 5.17 was found
independently by Bukovsk´y [1965] and Hechler. The discovery that cardinal expo-
nentiation is determined by the gimel function was made by Bukovsk´y; cf. [1965].

6. The Axiom of Regularity
The Axiom of Regularity states that the relation ∈on any family of sets is
well-founded:
Axiom of Regularity. Every nonempty set has an ∈-minimal element:
∀S (S ̸= ∅→(∃x ∈S) S ∩x = ∅).
As a consequence, there is no inﬁnite sequence
x0 ∋x1 ∋x2 ∋. . . .
(Consider the set S = {x0, x1, x2, . . .} and apply the axiom.) In particular,
there is no set x such that
x ∈x
and there are no “cycles”
x0 ∈x1 ∈. . . ∈xn ∈x0.
Thus the Axiom of Regularity postulates that sets of certain type do no
exist. This restriction on the universe of sets is not contradictory (i.e., the
axiom is consistent with the other axioms) and is irrelevant for the devel-
opment of ordinal and cardinal numbers, natural and real numbers, and in
fact of all ordinary mathematics. However, it is extremely useful in the meta-
mathematics of set theory, in construction of models. In particular, all sets
can be assigned ranks and can be arranged in a cumulative hierarchy.
We recall that a set T is transitive if x ∈T implies x ⊂T .
Lemma 6.1. For every set S there exists a transitive set T ⊃S.
Proof. We deﬁne by induction
S0 = S,
Sn+1 =  Sn
and
(6.1)
T =
∞

n=0
Sn.
Clearly, T is transitive and T ⊃S.
⊓⊔

64
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Since every transitive set must satisfy  T ⊂T , it follows that the set
in (6.1) is the smallest transitive T ⊃S; it is called transitive closure of S:
TC(S) = {T : T ⊃S and T is transitive}.
Lemma 6.2. Every nonempty class C has an ∈-minimal element.
Proof. Let S ∈C be arbitrary. If S ∩C = ∅, then S is a minimal element
of C; if S ∩C ̸= ∅, we let X = T ∩C where T = TC(S). X is a nonempty
set and by the Axiom of Regularity, there is x ∈X such that x ∩X = ∅.
It follows that x ∩C = ∅; otherwise, if y ∈x and y ∈C, then y ∈T since
T is transitive, and so y ∈x ∩T ∩C = x ∩X. Hence x is a minimal element
of C.
⊓⊔
The Cumulative Hierarchy of Sets
We deﬁne, by transﬁnite induction,
V0 = ∅,
Vα+1 = P(Vα),
Vα =

β<α
Vβ
if α is a limit ordinal.
The sets Vα have the following properties (by induction):
(i) Each Vα is transitive.
(ii) If α < β, then Vα ⊂Vβ.
(iii) α ⊂Vα.
The Axiom of Regularity implies that every set is in some Vα:
Lemma 6.3. For every x there is α such that x ∈Vα:
(6.2)

α∈Ord
Vα = V.
Proof. Let C be the class of all x that are not in any Vα. If C is nonempty,
then C has an ∈-minimal element x. That is, x ∈C, and z ∈
α Vα for every
z ∈x. Hence x ⊂
α∈Ord Vα. By Replacement, there exists an ordinal γ such
that x ⊂
α<γ Vα. Hence x ⊂Vγ and so x ∈Vγ+1. Thus C is empty and we
have (6.2).
⊓⊔
Since every x is in some Vα, we may deﬁne the rank of x:
(6.3)
rank(x) = the least α such that x ∈Vα+1.
Thus each Vα is the collection of all sets of rank less than α, and we have
(i) If x ∈y, then rank(x) < rank(y).

6. The Axiom of Regularity
65
(ii) rank(α) = α.
One of the uses of the rank function is a deﬁnition of equivalence classes
for equivalence relations on a proper class. The basic trick is the following:
Given a class C, let
(6.4)
ˆC = {x ∈C : (∀z ∈C) rank x ≤rank z}.
ˆC is always a set, and if C is nonempty, then ˆC is nonempty. Moreover,
(6.4) can be applied uniformly.
Thus, for example, if ≡is an equivalence on a proper class C, we ap-
ply (6.4) to each equivalence class of ≡, and deﬁne
[x] = {y ∈C : y ≡x and ∀z ∈C (z ≡x →rank y ≤rank z)}
and
C/≡= {[x] : x ∈C}.
In particular, this trick enables us to deﬁne isomorphism types for a given
isomorphism. For instance, one can deﬁne order-types of linearly ordered sets,
or cardinal numbers (even without AC).
We use the same argument to prove the following.
Collection Principle.
(6.5)
∀X ∃Y (∀u ∈X)[∃v ϕ(u, v, p) →(∃v ∈Y ) ϕ(u, v, p)]
(p is a parameter).
The Collection Principle is a schema of formulas. We can formulate it as
follows:
Given a “collection of classes” Cu, u ∈X (X is a set), then there is a set Y
such that for every u ∈X,
if Cu ̸= ∅,
then Cu ∩Y ̸= ∅.
To prove (6.5), we let
Y = 
u∈X
ˆCu
where Cu = {v : ϕ(u, v, p)}, i.e.,
v ∈Y ↔(∃u ∈X)(ϕ(u, v, p) and ∀z (ϕ(u, z, p) →rankv ≤rank z)).
That Y is a set follows from the Replacement Schema.
Note that the Collection Principle implies the Replacement Schema:
Given a function F, then for every set X we let Y be a set such that
(∀u ∈X)(∃v ∈Y ) F(u) = v.
Then
F↾X = F ∩(X × Y )
is a set by the Separation Schema.

Part I. Basic Set Theory
∈-Induction
The method of transﬁnite induction can be extended to an arbitrary transitive
class (instead of Ord), both for the proof and for the deﬁnition by induction:
Theorem 6.4 (∈-Induction). Let T be a transitive class, let Φ be a prop-
erty. Assume that
(i) Φ(∅);
(ii) if x ∈T and Φ(z) holds for every z ∈x, then Φ(x).
Then every x ∈T has property Φ.
Proof. Let C be the class of all x ∈T that do not have the property Φ. If
C is nonempty, then it has an ∈-minimal element x; apply (i) or (ii).
⊓⊔
Theorem 6.5 (∈-Recursion). Let T be a transitive class and let G be
a function (deﬁned for all x). Then there is a function F on T such that
(6.6)
F(x) = G(F↾x)
for every x ∈T .
Moreover, F is the unique function that satisﬁes (6.6).
Proof. We let, for every x ∈T ,
F(x) = y ↔there exists a function f such that
dom(f) is a transitive subset of T and:
(i) (∀z ∈dom(f)) f(z) = G(f↾z),
(ii) f(x) = y.
That F is a (unique) function on T satisfying (6.6) is proved by ∈-induction.
⊓⊔
Corollary 6.6. Let A be a class. There is a unique class B such that
(6.7)
B = {x ∈A : x ⊂B}.
Proof. Let
F(x) =
1
if x ∈A and F(z) = 1 for all z ∈x,
0
otherwise.
Let B = {x : F(x) = 1}. The uniqueness of B is proved by ∈-induction.
⊓⊔
We say that each x ∈B is hereditarily in A.
One consequence of the Axiom of Regularity is that the universe does not
admit nontrivial ∈-automorphisms. More generally:

6. The Axiom of Regularity
67
Theorem 6.7. Let T1, T2 be transitive classes and let π be an ∈-isomorphism
of T1 onto T2; i.e., π is one-to-one and
(6.8)
u ∈v ↔πu ∈πv.
Then T1 = T2 and πu = u for every u ∈T1.
Proof. We show, by ∈-induction, that πx = x for every x ∈T1. Assume that
πz = z for each z ∈x and let y = πx.
We have x ⊂y because if z ∈x, then z = πz ∈πx = y.
We also have y ⊂x: Let t ∈y. Since y ⊂T2, there is z ∈T1 such that
πz = t. Since πz ∈y, we have z ∈x, and so t = πz = z. Thus t ∈x.
Therefore πx = x for all x ∈T1, and T2 = T1.
⊓⊔
Well-Founded Relations
The notion of well-founded relations that was introduced in Chapter 2 can
be generalized to relations on proper classes, and one can extend the method
of induction to well-founded relations.
Let E be a binary relation on a class P. For each x ∈P, we let
extE(x) = {z ∈P : z E x}
the extension of x.
Deﬁnition 6.8. A relation E on P is well-founded, if:
(i) every nonempty set x ⊂P has an E-minimal element;
(ii) extE(x) is a set, for every x ∈P.
(6.9)
(Condition (ii) is vacuous if P is a set.) Note that the relation ∈is well-
founded on any class, by the Axiom of Regularity.
Lemma 6.9. If E is a well-founded relation on P, then every nonempty class
C ⊂P has an E-minimal element.
Proof. We follow the proof of Lemma 6.2; we are looking for x ∈C such that
extE(x) ∩C = ∅. Let S ∈C be arbitrary and assume that extE(S) ∩C ̸= ∅.
We let X = T ∩C where
T =
∞

n=0
Sn
and
S0 = extE S,
Sn+1 = {extE(z) : z ∈Sn}.
As in Lemma 6.2, it follows that an E-minimal element x of X is E-minimal
in C.
⊓⊔

68
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Theorem 6.10 (Well-Founded Induction). Let E be a well-founded re-
lation on P. Let Φ be a property. Assume that:
(i) every E-minimal element x has property Φ;
(ii) if x ∈P and if Φ(z) holds for every z such that z E x, then Φ(x).
Then every x ∈P has property Φ.
Proof. A modiﬁcation of the proof of Theorem 6.4.
⊓⊔
Theorem 6.11 (Well-Founded Recursion). Let E be a well-founded rela-
tion on P. Let G be a function (on V ×V ). Then there is a unique function F
on P such that
(6.10)
F(x) = G(x, F↾extE(x))
for every x ∈P.
Proof. A modiﬁcation of the proof of Theorem 6.5.
⊓⊔
(Note that if F(x) = G(F↾ext(x)) for some G, then F(x) = F(y) when-
ever ext(x) = ext(y); in particular, F(x) is the same for all minimal elements.)
Example 6.12 (The Rank Function). We deﬁne, by induction, for all
x ∈P:
ρ(x) = sup{ρ(z) + 1 : z E x}
(compare with (2.7)). The range of ρ is either an ordinal or the class Ord.
For all x, y ∈P,
x E y →ρ(x) < ρ(y).
⊓⊔
Example 6.13 (The Transitive Collapse). By induction, let
π(x) = {π(z) : z E x}
for every x ∈P. The range of π is a transitive class, and for all x, y ∈P,
x E y →π(x) ∈π(y).
⊓⊔
The transitive collapse of a well-founded relation is not necessarily a one-
to-one function. It is one-to-one if E satisﬁes an additional condition, exten-
sionality.
Deﬁnition 6.14. A well-founded relation E on a class P is extensional if
(6.11)
extE(X) ̸= extE(Y )
whenever X and Y are distinct elements of P.
A class M is extensional if the relation ∈on M is extensional, i.e., if for
any distinct X and Y ∈M, X ∩M ̸= Y ∩M.

6. The Axiom of Regularity
69
The following theorem shows that the transitive collapse of an extensional
well-founded relation is one-to-one, and that every extensional class is ∈-
isomorphic to a transitive class.
Theorem 6.15 (Mostowski’s Collapsing Theorem).
(i) If E is a well-founded and extensional relation on a class P, then there
is a transitive class M and an isomorphism π between (P, E) and
(M, ∈). The transitive class M and the isomorphism π are unique.
(ii) In particular, every extensional class P is isomorphic to a transitive
class M. The transitive class M and the isomorphism π are unique.
(iii) In case (ii), if T ⊂P is transitive, then πx = x for every x ∈T .
Proof. Since (ii) is a special case of (i) (E = ∈in case (ii)), we shall prove
the existence of an isomorphism in the general case.
Since E is a well-founded relation, we can deﬁne π by well-founded induc-
tion (Theorem 6.11), i.e., π(x) can be deﬁned in terms of the π(z)’s, where
z E x. We let, for each x ∈P
(6.12)
π(x) = {π(z) : z E x}.
In particular, in the case E = ∈, (6.12) becomes
(6.13)
π(x) = {π(z) : z ∈x ∩P}.
The function π maps P onto a class M = π(P), and it is immediate from the
deﬁnition (6.12) that M is transitive.
We use the extensionality of E to show that π is one-to-one. Let z ∈M
be of least rank such that z = π(x) = π(y) for some x ̸= y. Then extE(x) ̸=
extE(y) and there is, e.g., some u ∈extE(x) such that u /∈extE(y). Let
t = π(u). Since t ∈z = π(y), there is v ∈extE(y) such that t = π(v). Thus
we have t = π(u) = π(v), u ̸= v, and t is of lesser rank than z (since t ∈z).
A contradiction.
Now it follows easily that
(6.14)
x E y ↔π(x) ∈π(y).
If x E y, then π(x) ∈π(y) by deﬁnition (6.12). On the other hand, if π(x) ∈
π(y), then by (6.12), π(x) = π(z) for some z E y. Since π is one-to-one, we
have x = z and so x E y.
The uniqueness of the isomorphism π, and the transitive class M = π(P),
follows from Theorem 6.7. If π1 and π2 are two isomorphisms of P and M1,
M2, respectively, then π2π−1
1
is an isomorphism between M1 and M2, and
therefore the identity mapping. Hence π1 = π2.
It remains to prove (iii). If T ⊂P is transitive, then we ﬁrst observe that
x ⊂P for every x ∈T and so x ∩P = x, and we have
π(x) = {π(z) : z ∈x}
for all x ∈T . It follows easily by ∈-induction that π(x) = x for all x ∈T .

Let BG denote the axiomatic theory A–D and let BGC denote BG +

If a set-theoretical statement is provable in ZF (ZFC), then it is provable

On the other hand, a theorem of Shoenﬁeld (using proof-theoretic meth-

then it is provable in ZF. This result can be extended to BGC/ZFC using
the method of forcing.

Historical Notes
The Axiom of Regularity was introduced by von Neumann in [1925], although a sim-
ilar principle had been considered previously by Skolem (see [1970], pp. 137–152).
The concept of rank appears ﬁrst in Mirimanov [1917]. The transitive collapse is
deﬁned in Mostowski [1949]. Induction on well-founded relations (Theorems 6.10,
6.11) was formulated by Montague in [1955].
The axiomatic system BG was introduced by Bernays in [1937]. Shoenﬁeld’s
result was published in [1954].

7. Filters, Ultraﬁlters and Boolean Algebras
Filters and Ultraﬁlters
Filters and ideals play an important role in several mathematical disciplines
(algebra, topology, logic, measure theory). In this chapter we introduce the
notion of ﬁlter (and ideal) on a given set. The notion of ideal extrapolates
the notion of small sets: Given an ideal I on S, a set X ⊂S is considered
small if it belongs to I.
Deﬁnition 7.1. A ﬁlter on a nonempty set S is a collection F of subsets
of S such that
(i) S ∈F and ∅/∈F,
(ii) if X ∈F and Y ∈F, then X ∩Y ∈F,
(iii) If X, Y ⊂S, X ∈F, and X ⊂Y , then Y ∈F.
(7.1)
An ideal on a nonempty set S is a collection I of subsets of S such that:
(i) ∅∈I and S /∈I,
(ii) if X ∈I and Y ∈I, then X ∪Y ∈I,
(iii) if X, Y ⊂S, X ∈I, and Y ⊂X, then Y ∈I.
(7.2)
If F is a ﬁlter on S, then the set I = {S −X : X ∈F} is an ideal on S; and
conversely, if I is an ideal, then F = {S −X : X ∈I} is a ﬁlter. If this is the
case we say that F and I are dual to each other.
Examples. 1. A trivial ﬁlter: F = {S}.
2. A principal ﬁlter. Let X0 be a nonempty subset of S. The ﬁlter F =
{X ⊂S : X ⊃X0} is a principal ﬁlter. Note that every ﬁlter on a ﬁnite set
is principal.
The dual notions are a trivial ideal and a principal ideal.
3. The Fr´echet ﬁlter. Let S be an inﬁnite set, and let I be the ideal of all
ﬁnite subsets of S. The dual ﬁlter F = {X ⊂S : S −X is ﬁnite} is called
the Fr´echet ﬁlter on S. Note that the Fr´echet ﬁlter is not principal.
4. Let A be an inﬁnite set and let S = [A]<ω be the set of all ﬁnite subsets
of A. For each P ∈S, let ˆP = {Q ∈S : P ⊂Q}. Let F be the set of all
X ⊂S such that X ⊃ˆP for some P ∈S. Then F is a nonprincipal ﬁlter
on S.

5. A set A ⊂N has density 0 if limn→∞|A ∩n|/n = 0. The set of all A
of density 0 is an ideal on N.
A family G of sets has the ﬁnite intersection property if every ﬁnite H =
{X1, . . . , Xn} ⊂G has a nonempty intersection X1 ∩. . . ∩Xn ̸= ∅. Every
ﬁlter has the ﬁnite intersection property.

(i) If F is a nonempty family of ﬁlters on S, then  F is a ﬁlter on S.
(ii) If C is a ⊂-chain of ﬁlters on S, then  C is a ﬁlter on S.
(iii) If G ⊂P(S) has the ﬁnite intersection property, then there is a ﬁlter F
on S such that G ⊂F.
Proof. (i) and (ii) are easy to verify.
(iii) Let F be the set of all X ⊂S such that there is a ﬁnite H = {X1, . . . ,
Xn} ⊂G with X1 ∩. . . ∩Xn ⊂X. Then F is a ﬁlter and F ⊃G.
⊓⊔
Since every ﬁlter F ⊃G must contain all ﬁnite intersections of sets in G,
it follows that the ﬁlter F constructed in the proof of Lemma 7.2(iii) is the
smallest ﬁlter on S that extends G:
F = {D : D is a ﬁlter on S and G ⊂D}.
We say that the ﬁlter F is generated by G.
Deﬁnition 7.3. A ﬁlter U on a set S is an ultraﬁlter if
(7.3)
for every X ⊂S, either X ∈U or S −X ∈U.
The dual notion is a prime ideal: For every X ⊂S, either X ∈I or S−X ∈I.
Note that I = P(S) −U.
A ﬁlter F on S is maximal if there is no ﬁlter F ′ on S such that F ⊂F ′
and F ̸= F ′.
Lemma 7.4. A ﬁlter F on S is an ultraﬁlter if and only if it is maximal.
Proof. (a) An ultraﬁlter U is clearly a maximal ﬁlter: Assume that U ⊂F
and X ∈F −U. Then S −X ∈U, and so both S −X ∈F and X ∈F,
a contradiction.
(b) Let F be a ﬁlter that is not an ultraﬁlter. We will show that F is not
maximal. Let Y ⊂S be such that neither Y nor S −Y is in F. Consider the
family G = F ∪{Y }; we claim that G has the ﬁnite intersection property.
If X ∈F, then X ∩Y ̸= ∅, for otherwise we would have S −Y ⊃X and
S −Y ∈F. Thus, if X1, . . . , Xn ∈F, we have X1 ∩. . . ∩Xn ∈F and so
Y ∩X1 ∩. . . ∩Xn ̸= ∅. Hence G has the ﬁnite intersection property, and by
Lemma 7.2(iii) there is a ﬁlter F ′ ⊃G. Since Y ∈F ′ −F, F is not maximal.
⊓⊔

Theorem 7.5 (Tarski). Every ﬁlter can be extended to an ultraﬁlter.
Proof. Let F0 be a ﬁlter on S. Let P be the set of all ﬁlters F on S such
that F ⊃F0 and consider the partially ordered set (P, ⊂). If C is a chain
in P, then by Lemma 7.2(ii),  C is a ﬁlter and hence an upper bound of C
in P. By Zorn’s Lemma there exists a maximal element U in P. This U is an
ultraﬁlter by Lemma 7.4.
⊓⊔
For every a ∈S, the principal ﬁlter {X ⊂S : a ∈X} is an ultraﬁlter. If
S is ﬁnite, then every ultraﬁlter on S is principal.
If S is inﬁnite, then there is a nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on S: If U extends
the Fr´echet ﬁlter, then U is nonprincipal.
The proof of Theorem 7.5 uses the Axiom of Choice. We shall see later
that the existence of nonprincipal ultraﬁlters cannot be proved without AC.
If S is an inﬁnite set of cardinality κ, then because every ultraﬁlter on S
is a subset of P(S), there are at most 22κ ultraﬁlters on S. The next theorem
shows that the number of ultraﬁlters on κ is exactly 22κ. To get a slightly
stronger result, let us call an ultraﬁlter D on κ uniform if |X| = κ for all
X ∈D.
Theorem 7.6 (Posp´ıˇsil). For every inﬁnite cardinal κ, there exist 22κ uni-
form ultraﬁlters on κ.
We prove ﬁrst the following lemma. Let us call a family A of subsets
of κ independent if for any distinct sets X1, . . . , Xn, Y1, . . . , Ym in A, the
intersection
(7.4)
X1 ∩. . . ∩Xn ∩(κ −Y1) ∩. . . ∩(κ −Ym)
has cardinality κ.
Lemma 7.7. There exists an independent family of subsets of κ of cardinal-
ity 2κ.
Proof. Let us consider the set P of all pairs (F, F) where F is a ﬁnite subset
of κ and F is a ﬁnite set of ﬁnite subsets of κ. Since |P| = κ, it suﬃces to
ﬁnd an independent family A of subsets of P, of size 2κ.
For each u ⊂κ, let
Xu = {(F, F) ∈P : F ∩u ∈F}
and let A = {Xu : u ⊂κ}. If u and v are distinct subsets of κ, then Xu ̸= Xv:
For example, if α ∈u but α /∈v, then let F = {α}, F = {F}, and (F, F) ∈Xu
while (F, F) /∈Xv. Hence |A| = 2κ.
To show that A is independent, let u1, . . . , un, v1, . . . , vm be distinct
subsets of κ. For each i ≤n and each j ≤m, let αi,j be some element of κ
such that either αi,j ∈ui −vj or αi,j ∈vj −ui. Now let F be any ﬁnite

76
Part I. Basic Set Theory
subset of κ such that F ⊃{αi,j : i ≤n, j ≤m} (note that there are κ many
such ﬁnite sets). Clearly, we have F ∩ui ̸= F ∩vj for any i ≤n and j ≤m.
Thus if we let F = {F ∩ui : i ≤n}, we have (F, F) ∈Xui for all i ≤n and
(F, F) /∈Xvj for all j ≤m. Consequently, the intersection
Xu1 ∩. . . ∩Xun ∩(P −Xv1) ∩. . . ∩(P −Xvm)
has cardinality κ.
⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 7.6. Let A be an independent family of subsets of κ. For
every function f : A →{0, 1}, consider this family of subsets of κ:
(7.5)
Gf = {X : |κ −X| < κ} ∪{X : f(X) = 1} ∪{κ −X : f(X) = 0}.
By (7.4), the family Gf has the ﬁnite intersection property, and so there
exists an ultraﬁlter Df such that Df ⊃Gf. If follows from (7.5) that Df is
uniform. If f ̸= g, then for some X ∈A, f(X) ̸= g(X); e.g., f(X) = 1 and
g(X) = 0 and then X ∈Df, while κ −X ∈Dg. Thus we obtain 22κ distinct
uniform ultraﬁlters on κ.
⊓⊔
Ultraﬁlters on ω
We present two properties of ultraﬁlters on ω that are frequently used in
set-theoretic topology.
Let D be a nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on ω. D is called a p-point if for every
partition {An : n ∈ω} of ω into ℵ0 pieces such that An /∈D for all n, there
exists X ∈D such that X ∩An is ﬁnite, for all n ∈ω.
First we notice that it is easy to ﬁnd a nonprincipal ultraﬁlter that is not
a p-point: Let {An : n ∈ω} be any partition of ω into ℵ0 inﬁnite pieces, and
let F be the following ﬁlter on ω:
X ∈F if and only if except for ﬁnitely many n, X ∩An contains all
but ﬁnitely many elements of An.
(7.6)
If D is any ultraﬁlter extending F, then D is not a p-point.
Theorem 7.8 below shows that existence of p-points follows from the Con-
tinuum Hypothesis. By a result of Shelah there exists a model of ZFC in which
there are no p-points.
A nonprincipal ultraﬁlter D on ω is a Ramsey ultraﬁlter if for every
partition {An : n ∈ω} of ω into ℵ0 pieces such that An /∈D for all n, there
exists X ∈D such that X ∩An has one element for all n ∈ω.
Every Ramsey ultraﬁlter is a p-point.
Theorem 7.8. If 2ℵ0 = ℵ1, then a Ramsey ultraﬁlter exists.

7. Filters, Ultraﬁlters and Boolean Algebras
77
Proof. Let Aα, α < ω1, enumerate all partitions of ω and let us construct
an ω1-sequence of inﬁnite subsets of ω as follows: Given Xα, let Xα+1 ⊂Xα
be such that either Xα+1 ⊂A for some A ∈Aα, or that |Xα+1 ∩A| ≤1
for all A ∈Aα. If α is a limit ordinal, let Xα be such that Xα −Xβ is
ﬁnite for all β < α. (Such a set Xα exists because α is countable.) Then
D = {X : X ⊃Xα for some α < ω1} is a Ramsey ultraﬁlter.
⊓⊔
κ-Complete Filters and Ideals
A ﬁlter F on S is countably complete (σ-complete) if whenever {Xn : n ∈N}
is a countable family of subsets of S and Xn ∈F for every n, then
(7.7)
∞

n=0
Xn ∈F.
A countably complete ideal (a σ-ideal) is such that if Xn ∈I for every n,
then
∞

n=0
Xn ∈I.
More generally, if κ is a regular uncountable cardinal, and F is a ﬁlter on S,
then F is called κ-complete if F is closed under intersection of less than κ
sets, i.e., if whenever {Xα : α < γ} is a family of subsets of S, γ < κ, and
Xα ∈F for every α < γ, then
(7.8)

α<γ
Xα ∈F.
The dual notion is a κ-complete ideal.
An example of a κ-complete ideal is I = {X ⊂S : |X| < κ}, on any set S
such that |S| ≥κ.
A σ-complete ﬁlter is the same as an ℵ1-complete ﬁlter.
There is no nonprincipal σ-complete ﬁlter on a countable set S. If S is
uncountable, then
{X ⊂S : |X| ≤ℵ0}
is a σ-ideal on S.
Similarly, if κ > ω is regular and |S| ≥κ, then
{X ⊂S : |X| < κ}
is the smallest κ-complete ideal on S containing all singletons {a}.
The question whether a nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on a set can be σ-complete
gives rise to deep investigations of the foundations of set theory. In particular,
if such ultraﬁlters exist, then there exist large cardinals (inaccessible, etc.).

Boolean Algebras
An algebra of sets (see Deﬁnition 4.9) is a collection of subsets of a given
nonempty set that is closed under unions, intersections and complements.
These properties of algebras of sets are abstracted in the notion of Boolean
algebra:
Deﬁnition 7.9. A Boolean algebra is a set B with at least two elements, 0
and 1, endowed with binary operations + and · and a unary operation −.
The Boolean operations satisfy the following axioms:
(7.9)
u + v = v + u,
u · v = v · u,
(commutativity)
u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w,
u · (v · w) = (u · v) · w,
(associativity)
u · (v + w) = u · v + u · w,
u + (v · w) = (u + v) · (u + w),
(distributivity)
u · (u + v) = u,
u + (u · v) = u,
(absorption)
u + (−u) = 1,
u · (−u) = 0.
(complementation)
An algebra of sets S, with  S = S, is a Boolean algebra, with Boolean
operations X∪Y , X∩Y and S−X, and with ∅and S being 0 and 1. If follows
from Stone’s Representation Theorem below that every Boolean algebra is
isomorphic to an algebra of sets.
From the axioms (7.9) one can derive additional Boolean algebraic rules
that correspond to rules for the set operations ∪, ∩and −. Among others,
we have
u + u = u,
u · u = u,
u + 0 = u,
u · 0 = 0,
u + 1 = 1,
u · 1 = u
and the De Morgan laws
−(u + v) = −u · −v,
−(u · v) = −u + −v.
Two elements u, v ∈B are disjoint if u · v = 0. Let us deﬁne
u −v = u · (−v),
and
(7.10)
u ≤v
if and only if
u −v = 0.
It is easy to see that ≤is a partial ordering of B and that
u ≤v
if and only if
u + v = v
if and only if
u · v = u.
Moreover, 1 is the greatest element of B and 0 is the least element. Also, for
any u, v ∈B, u + v is the least upper bound of {u, v} and u · v is the greatest

7. Filters, Ultraﬁlters and Boolean Algebras
79
lower bound of {u, v}. Since −u is the unique v such that u + v = 1 and
u · v = 0, it follows that all Boolean-algebraic operations can be deﬁned in
terms of the partial ordering of B.
We shall now give an example showing the relation between Boolean al-
gebras and logic:
Let L be a ﬁrst order language and let S be the set of all sentences of L. We
consider the equivalence relation ⊢ϕ ↔ψ on S. The set B of all equivalence
classes [ϕ] is a Boolean algebra under the following operations:
[ϕ] + [ψ] = [ϕ ∨ψ],
0 = [ϕ ∧¬ϕ],
[ϕ] · [ψ] = [ϕ ∧ψ],
1 = [ϕ ∨¬ϕ].
−[ϕ] = [¬ϕ],
This algebra is called the Lindenbaum algebra.
A subset A of a Boolean algebra B is a subalgebra if it contains 0 and 1
and is closed under the Boolean operations:
(i) 0 ∈A, 1 ∈A;
(ii) if u, v ∈A, then u + v ∈A, u · v ∈A, −u ∈A.
(7.11)
If X ⊂B, then there is a smallest subalgebra A of B that contains X; A can
be described either as {A : X ⊂A ⊂B and A is a subalgebra}, or as the
set of all Boolean combinations in B of elements of X. The subalgebra A is
generated by X. If X is inﬁnite, then |A| = |X|. See Exercises 7.18–7.20.
If B is a Boolean algebra, let B+ = B −{0} denote the set of all nonzero
elements of B. If a ∈B+, the set B↾a = {u ∈B : u ≤a} with the partial
order inherited from B, is a Boolean algebra; its + and · are the same as in B,
and the complement of u is a −u. An element a ∈B is called an atom if it is
a minimal element of B+; equivalently, if there is no x such that 0 < x < a.
A Boolean algebra is atomic if for every u ∈B+ there is an atom a ≤u; B is
atomless if it has no atoms.
Let B and C be two Boolean algebras. A mapping h : B →C is a homo-
morphism if it preserves the operations:
(i) h(0) = 0, h(1) = 1,
(ii) h(u + v) = h(u) + h(v), h(u · v) = h(u) · h(v), h(−u) = −h(u).
(7.12)
Note that the range of a homomorphism is a subalgebra of C and that
h(u) ≤h(v) whenever u ≤v. A one-to-one homomorphism of B onto C
is called an isomorphism. An embedding of B in C is an isomorphism of B
onto a subalgebra of C. Note that if h : B →C is a one-to-one mapping
such that u ≤v if and only if h(u) ≤h(v), then h is an isomorphism. An
isomorphism of a Boolean algebra onto itself is called an automorphism.

Ideals and Filters on Boolean Algebras
The deﬁnition of ﬁlter (and ideal) given earlier in this chapter generalizes to
arbitrary Boolean algebras. Let B be a Boolean algebra. An ideal on B is
a subset I of B such that:
(i) 0 ∈I, 1 /∈I;
(ii) if u ∈I and v ∈I, then u + v ∈I;
(iii) if u, v ∈B, u ∈I and v ≤u, then v ∈I.
(7.13)
A ﬁlter on B is a subset F of B such that:
(i) 1 ∈F, 0 /∈F;
(ii) if u ∈F and v ∈F, then u · v ∈F;
(iii) if u, v ∈B, u ∈F and u ≤v, then v ∈F.
(7.14)
The trivial ideal is the ideal {0}; an ideal is principal if I = {u ∈B :
u ≤u0} for some u0 ̸= 1. Similarly for ﬁlters.
A subset G of B −{0} has the ﬁnite intersection property if for every
ﬁnite {u1, . . . , un} ⊂G, u1 · . . . · un ̸= 0. Every G ⊂B that has the ﬁnite
intersection property generates a ﬁlter on B; this and the other two clauses
of Lemma 7.2 hold also for Boolean algebras.
There is a relation between ideals and homomorphisms. If h : B →C is
a homomorphism, then
(7.15)
I = {u ∈B : h(u) = 0}
is an ideal on B (the kernel of the homomorphism). On the other hand, let
I be an ideal on B. Let us consider the following equivalence relation on B:
(7.16)
u ∼v
if and only if
u △v ∈I
where
u △v = (u −v) + (v −u).
Let C be the set of all equivalence classes, C = B/∼, and endow C with the
following operations:
(7.17)
[u] + [v] = [u + v],
0 = [0],
[u] · [v] = [u · v],
1 = [1].
−[u] = [−u],
Then C is a Boolean algebra, the quotient of B mod I, and is a homomorphic
image of B under the homomorphism
(7.18)
h(u) = [u].
The quotient algebra is denoted B/I.

7. Filters, Ultraﬁlters and Boolean Algebras
81
An ideal I on B is a prime ideal if
(7.19)
for every u ∈B, either u ∈I or −u ∈I.
The dual of a prime ideal is an ultraﬁlter.
Lemma 7.4 holds in general: An ideal is a prime ideal (and a ﬁlter is an
ultraﬁlter) if and only if it is maximal. Also, an ideal I on B is prime if and
only if the quotient of B mod I is the trivial algebra {0, 1}.
Tarski’s Theorem 7.5 easily generalizes to Boolean algebras:
Theorem 7.10 (The Prime Ideal Theorem). Every ideal on B can be
extended to a prime ideal.
⊓⊔
The proof of the Prime Ideal Theorem uses the Axiom of Choice. It is
known that the theorem cannot be proved without using the Axiom of Choice.
However, it is also known that the Prime Ideal Theorem is weaker than the
Axiom of Choice.
Theorem 7.11 (Stone’s Representation Theorem). Every Boolean al-
gebra is isomorphic to an algebra of sets.
Proof. Let B be a Boolean algebra. We let
(7.20)
S = {p : p is an ultraﬁlter on B}.
For every u ∈B, let Xu be the set of all p ∈S such that u ∈p. Let
(7.21)
S = {Xu : u ∈B}.
Let us consider the mapping π(u) = Xu from B onto S. Clearly, π(1) = S
and π(0) = ∅. It follows from the deﬁnition of ultraﬁlter that
π(u · v) = π(u) ∩π(v),
π(u + v) = π(u) ∪π(v),
π(−u) = S −π(u).
Thus π is a homomorphism of B onto the algebra of sets S. It remains to
show that π is one-to-one.
If u ̸= v, then using the Prime Ideal Theorem, one can ﬁnd an ultraﬁlter p
on B containing one of these two elements but not the other. Thus π is an
isomorphism.
⊓⊔
Complete Boolean Algebras
The partial ordering ≤of a Boolean algebra can be used to deﬁne inﬁnitary
operations on B, generalizing + and · . Let us recall that u + v = sup{u, v}

82
Part I. Basic Set Theory
and u · v = inf{u, v} in the partial ordering of B. Thus for any nonempty
X ⊂B, we deﬁne
(7.22)
{u : u ∈X} = sup X
and
{u : u ∈X} = inf X,
provided that the least upper bound (the greatest lower bound) exists. We
also deﬁne  ∅= 0 and  ∅= 1.
If the inﬁnitary sum and product is deﬁned for all X ⊂B, the Boolean al-
gebra is called complete. Similarly, we call B κ-complete (where κ is a regular
uncountable cardinal) if sums and products exist for all X of cardinality < κ.
An ℵ1-complete Boolean algebra is called σ-complete or countably complete.
An algebra of sets S is κ-complete if it is closed under unions and inter-
sections of < κ sets. A κ-complete algebra of sets is a κ-complete Boolean
algebra and for every X ⊂S such that |X| < κ,  X =  X.
An ideal I on a κ-complete Boolean algebra is κ-complete if
{u : u ∈X} ∈I
whenever X ⊂I and |X| < κ. A κ-complete ﬁlter is the dual notion.
If I is a κ-complete ideal on a κ-complete Boolean algebra B, then B/I is
κ-complete, and
{[u] : u ∈X} = [ {u : u ∈X}]
for every X ⊂B, |X| < κ. Similarly for products.
An ℵ1-complete ideal is called a σ-ideal.
There are two important examples of σ-ideals on the Boolean algebra of
all Borel sets of reals: the σ-ideal of Borel sets of Lebesgue measure 0, and
the σ-ideal of meager Borel sets. (Exercises 7.14 and 7.15.)
Let A be a subalgebra of a Boolean algebra B. A is a dense subalgebra
of B if for every u ∈B+ there is a v ∈A+ such that v ≤u.
A completion of a Boolean algebra B is a complete Boolean algebra C
such that B is a dense subalgebra of C.
Lemma 7.12. The completion of a Boolean algebra B is unique up to iso-
morphism.
Proof. Let C and D be completions of B. We deﬁne an isomorphism π : C →
D by
(7.23)
π(c) = D{u ∈B : u ≤c}.
To verify that π is an isomorphism, one uses the fact that B is a dense
subalgebra of both C and D. For example, to show that π(c) ̸= 0 whenever
c ̸= 0: There is u ∈B such that 0 < u ≤c, and we have 0 < u ≤π(c).
⊓⊔
Theorem 7.13. Every Boolean algebra has a completion.

7. Filters, Ultraﬁlters and Boolean Algebras
83
Proof. We use a construction similar to the method of Dedekind cuts. Let A
be a Boolean algebra. Let us call a set U ⊂A+ a cut if
(7.24)
p ≤q and q ∈U implies p ∈U.
For every p ∈A+, let Up denote the cut {x : x ≤p}.
A cut U is regular if
(7.25)
whenever p /∈U, then there exists q ≤p such that Uq ∩U = ∅.
Note that every Up is regular, and that every cut includes some Up.
We let B be the set of all regular cuts in A+. We claim that B, under the
partial ordering by inclusion, is a complete Boolean algebra. Note that the
intersection of any collection of regular cuts is a regular cut, and hence each
cut U is included in a least regular cut U. In fact,
U = {p : (∀q ≤p) U ∩Uq ̸= ∅}.
Thus for u, v ∈B we have
u · v = u ∩v,
u + v = u ∪v.
The complement of u ∈B is the regular cut
−u = {p : Up ∩u = ∅}.
And, of course, ∅and A+ are the zero and the unit of B. It is not diﬃcult to
verify that B is a complete Boolean algebra, and we leave the veriﬁcation to
the reader.
Furthermore, for all p, q ∈A+ we have Up + Uq = Up+q, Up · Uq = Up·q
and −Up = U−p. Thus A embeds in B as a dense subalgebra.
⊓⊔
Complete and Regular Subalgebras
Let B be a complete Boolean algebra. A subalgebra A of B is a complete
subalgebra if  X ∈A and  X ∈A for all X ⊂A. (Caution: A subalgebra A
of B that is itself complete is not necessarily a complete subalgebra of B.)
Similarly, a complete homomorphism is a homomorphism h of B into C such
that for all X ⊂B,
(7.26)
h( X) =  h(X),
h( X) =  h(X).
A complete embedding is an embedding that satisﬁes (7.26). Note that every
isomorphism is complete.
Since the intersection of any collection of complete subalgebras of B is
a complete subalgebra, every X ⊂B is included in a smallest complete sub-
algebra of B. This algebra is called the complete subalgebra of B completely
generated by X.

84
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Deﬁnition 7.14. A set W ⊂B+ is an antichain in a Boolean algebra B if
u · v = 0 for all distinct u, v ∈W.
If W is an antichain and if  W = u then we say that W is a partition
of u. A partition of 1 is just a partition, or a maximal antichain.
If B is a Boolean algebra and A is a subalgebra of B then an antichain
in A that is maximal in A need not be maximal in B. If every maximal
antichain in A is also maximal in B, then A is called a regular subalgebra
of B.
If A is a complete subalgebra of a complete Boolean algebra B then A is
a regular subalgebra of B. Also, if A is a dense subalgebra of B then A is
a regular subalgebra. See also Exercise 7.31.
Saturation
Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal. A Boolean algebra B is κ-saturated if there is
no partition W of B such that |W| = κ, and
(7.27)
sat(B) = the least κ such that B is κ-saturated.
B is also said to satisfy the κ-chain condition; this is because if B is complete,
B is κ-saturated if and only if there exists no descending κ-sequence u0 >
u1 > . . . > uα > . . ., α < κ, of elements of B. The ℵ1-chain condition is
called the countable chain condition (c.c.c.).
Theorem 7.15. If B is an inﬁnite complete Boolean algebra, then sat(B) is
a regular uncountable cardinal.
Proof. Let κ = sat(B). It is clear that κ is uncountable. Let us assume that
κ is singular; we shall obtain a contradiction by constructing a partition of
size κ.
For u ∈B, u ̸= 0, let sat(u) denote sat(Bu). Let us call u ∈B stable if
sat(v) = sat(u) for every nonzero v ≤u. The set S of stable elements is dense
in B; otherwise, there would be a descending sequence u0 > u1 > u2 > . . .
with decreasing cardinals sat(u0) > sat(u1) > . . .. Let T be a maximal set of
pairwise disjoint elements of S. Thus T is a partition of B, and |T | < κ.
First we show that sup{sat(u) : u ∈T } = κ. For every regular λ < κ such
that λ > |T |, consider a partition W of B of size λ. Then at least one u ∈T
is partitioned by W into λ pieces.
Thus we consider two cases:
Case I. There is u ∈T such that sat(u) = κ. Since cf κ < κ, there is a par-
tition W of u of size cf κ: W = {uα : α < cf κ}. Let κα, α < cf κ, be an
increasing sequence with limit κ. For each α, sat(uα) = sat(u) = κ and so let
Wα be a partition of uα of size κα. Then 
α<cf κ Wα is a partition of u of
size κ.

7. Filters, Ultraﬁlters and Boolean Algebras
85
Case II. For all u ∈T , sat(u) < κ, but sup{sat(u) : u ∈T } = κ. Again, let
κα →κ, α < cf κ. For each α < cf κ (by induction), we ﬁnd uα ∈T , distinct
from all uβ, β < α, which admits a partition Wα of size κα. Then 
α<cf κ Wα
is an antichain in B of size κ.

(Every complete algebra of sets satisﬁes (7.28).) We shall see later that dis-
tributivity plays an important role in generic models. For now, let us give
two equivalent formulations of κ-distributivity.
If W and Z are partitions of B, then W is a reﬁnement of Z if for every
w ∈W there is z ∈Z such that w ≤z. A set D ⊂B is open dense if it is
dense in B and 0 ̸= u ≤v ∈D implies u ∈D.
Lemma 7.16. The following are equivalent, for any complete Boolean alge-
bra B:
(i) B is κ-distributive.
(ii) The intersection of κ open dense subsets of B is open dense.
(iii) Every collection of κ partitions of B has a common reﬁnement.
Proof. (i) →(ii). Let Dα, α < κ, be open dense, D = 
α<κ Dα. D is
certainly open; thus let u ̸= 0. If we let {uα,i : i ∈Iα} = {u · v : v ∈Dα},
then 
i uα,i = u for every α and the left-hand side of (7.28) is u. For each
f ∈
α Iα, let uf = 
α uα,f(α); clearly, each nonzero uf is in D. However,

f uf = u, by (7.28), and so some uf is nonzero.
(ii) →(iii). Let Wα, α < κ be partions of B. For each α, let Dα = {u :
u ≤v for some v ∈Wα}; each Dα is open dense. Let D = 
α<κ Dα, and
let W be a maximal set of pairwise disjoint elements of D. Since D is dense,
W is a partition of B, and clearly, W is a reﬁnement of each Wα.
(iii) →(i). Let {uα,i : α < κ, i ∈Iα} be a collection of elements of B.
First we show that the right-hand side of (7.28) is always ≤the left-hand
side. For each f ∈
α<κ Iα, let uf = 
α<κ uα,f(α); we have uf ≤uα,f(α)
and so uf ≤
i∈Iα uα,i for each α. Thus, for each α,

[If D is Ramsey and E = f∗(D) is nonprincipal, then f is unbounded mod D,

stable if |B↾x| = |B↾a| for all x ≤a, x ̸= 0. The set of all stable a ∈B is dense, and
|B↾a| = 2 or |B↾a|ℵ0 = |B↾a| if a is stable. Let W be a partition of B such that
each a ∈W is stable; we have |B| = Q{|B↾a| : a ∈W } and the theorem follows.]

Historical Notes
The notion of ﬁlter is, according to Kuratowski’s book [1966], due to H. Cartan.
Theorem 7.5 was ﬁrst proved by Tarski in [1930].
Theorem 7.6 is due to Posp´ıˇsil [1937]; the present proof uses independent sets
(Lemma 7.7); cf. Fichtenholz and Kantorovich [1935] (κ = ω) and Hausdorﬀ[1936b].
W. Rudin [1956] proved that p-points exist if 2ℵ0 = ℵ1, a recent result of Shelah
shows that existence of p-points is unprovable in ZFC. Galvin showed that 2ℵ0 = ℵ1
implies the existence of Ramsey ultraﬁlters.
Facts about Boolean algebras can be found in Handbook of Boolean alge-
bras [1989] which also contains an extensive bibliography. The Representation The-
orem for Boolean algebras as well as the existence of the completion (Theorems 7.11
and 7.13) are due to Stone [1936]. Theorem 7.15 on saturation was proved by Erd˝os
and Tarski [1943].
Exercise 7.8: Booth [1970/71].
Exercise 7.10: Frol´ık [1968], M. E. Rudin [1971].
The Rudin-Keisler equivalence was ﬁrst studied by W. Rudin in [1956]; the
study of the Rudin-Keisler ordering was initiated by M. E. Rudin [1966].
Exercise 7.25: Makinson [1969].
Exercises 7.29 and 7.30: Sikorski [1964].

8. Stationary Sets
In this chapter we develop the theory of closed unbounded and stationary
subsets of a regular uncountable cardinal, and its generalizations.
Closed Unbounded Sets
If X is a set of ordinals and α > 0 is a limit ordinal then α is a limit point
of X if sup(X ∩α) = α.
Deﬁnition 8.1. Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal. A set C ⊂κ is
a closed unbounded subset of κ if C is unbounded in κ and if it contains all
its limit points less than κ.
A set S ⊂κ is stationary if S∩C ̸= ∅for every closed unbounded subset C
of κ.
An unbounded set C ⊂κ is closed if and only if for every sequence
α0 < α1 < . . . < αξ < . . . (ξ < γ) of elements of C, of length γ < κ, we have
limξ→γ αξ ∈C.
Lemma 8.2. If C and D are closed unbounded, then C ∩D is closed un-
bounded.
Proof. It is immediate that C∩D is closed. To show that C∩D is unbounded,
let α < κ. Since C is unbounded, there exists an α1 > α with α1 ∈C.
Similarly there exists an α2 > α1 with α2 ∈D. In this fashion, we construct
an increasing sequence
(8.1)
α < α1 < α2 < . . . < αn < . . .
such that α1, α3, α5, . . . ∈C, α2, α4, α6, . . . ∈D. If we let β be the limit of
the sequence (8.1), then β < κ, and β ∈C and β ∈D.
⊓⊔
The collection of all closed unbounded subsets of κ has the ﬁnite inter-
section property. The ﬁlter generated by the closed unbounded sets consists
of all X ⊂κ that contain a closed unbounded subset. We call this ﬁlter the
closed unbounded ﬁlter on κ.

92
Part I. Basic Set Theory
The set of all limit ordinals α < κ is closed unbounded in κ. If A is an
unbounded subset of κ, then the set of all limit points α < κ of A is closed
unbounded.
A function f : κ →κ is normal if it is increasing and continuous (f(α) =
limξ→α f(ξ) for every nonzero limit α < κ). The range of a normal function
is a closed unbounded set. Conversely, if C is closed unbounded, there is
a unique normal function that enumerates C.
The closed unbounded ﬁlter on κ is κ-complete:
Theorem 8.3. The intersection of fewer than κ closed unbounded subsets
of κ is closed unbounded.
Proof. We prove, by induction on γ < κ, that the intersection of a sequence
⟨Cα : α < γ⟩of closed unbounded subsets of κ is closed unbounded. The
induction step works at successor ordinals because of Lemma 8.2. If γ is
a limit ordinal, we assume that the assertion is true for every α < γ; then we
can replace each Cα by 
ξ≤α Cξ and obtain a decreasing sequence with the
same intersection. Thus assume that
C0 ⊃C1 ⊃. . . ⊃Cα ⊃. . .
(α < γ)
are closed unbounded, and let C = 
α<γ Cα.
It is easy to see that C is closed. To show that C is unbounded, let α < κ.
We construct a γ-sequence
(8.2)
β0 < β1 < . . . βξ < . . .
(ξ < γ)
as follows: We let β0 ∈C0 be such that β0 > α, and for each ξ < γ, let
βξ ∈Cξ be such that βξ > sup{βν : ν < ξ}. Since κ is regular and γ < κ,
such a sequence (8.2) exists and its limit β is less than κ. For each η < γ,
β is the limit of a sequence ⟨βξ : η ≤ξ < γ⟩in Cη, and so β ∈Cη. Hence
β ∈C.
⊓⊔
Let ⟨Xα : α < κ⟩be a sequence of subsets of κ. The diagonal intersection
of Xα, α < κ, is deﬁned as follows:
(8.3)
△
α<κ Xα = {ξ < κ : ξ ∈
α<ξ
Xα}.
Note that △Xα = △Yα where Yα = {ξ ∈Xα : ξ > α}. Note also that
△Xα = 
α(Xα ∪{ξ : ξ ≤α}).
Lemma 8.4. The diagonal intersection of a κ-sequence of closed unbounded
sets is closed unbounded.
Proof. Let ⟨Cα : α < κ⟩be a sequence of closed unbounded sets. It is clear
from the deﬁnition that if we replace each Cα by 
ξ≤α Cξ, the diagonal

8. Stationary Sets
93
intersection is the same. In view of Theorem 8.3 we may thus assume that
C0 ⊃C1 ⊃. . . ⊃Cα ⊃. . .
(α < κ).
Let C = △α<κ Cα. To show that C is closed, let α be a limit point of C.
We want to show that α ∈C, or that α ∈Cξ for all ξ < α. If ξ < α, let
X = {ν ∈C : ξ < ν < α}. Every ν ∈X is in Cξ, by (8.3). Hence X ⊂Cξ
and α = sup X ∈Cξ. Therefore α ∈C and C is closed.
To show that C is unbounded, let α < κ. We construct a sequence ⟨βn :
n < ω⟩as follows: Let β0 > α be such that β0 ∈C0, and for each n, let
βn+1 > βn be such that βn+1 ∈Cβn. Let us show that β = limn βn is in C: If
ξ < β, let us show that β ∈Cξ. Since ξ < β, there is an n such that ξ < βn.
Each βk, k > n, belongs to Cβn and so β ∈Cβn. Therefore β ∈Cξ. Thus
β ∈C, and C is unbounded.
⊓⊔
Corollary 8.5. The closed unbounded ﬁlter on κ is closed under diagonal
intersections.
⊓⊔
The dual of the closed unbounded ﬁlter is the ideal of nonstationary sets,
the nonstationary ideal INS. INS is κ-complete and is closed under diagonal
unions:

α<κ
Xα = {ξ < κ : ξ ∈
α<ξ
Xα}.
The quotient algebra B = P(κ)/INS is a κ-complete Boolean algebra,
where the Boolean operations 
α<γ and 
α<γ for γ < κ are induced by

α<γ and 
α<γ. As a consequence of Lemma 8.4, B is κ+-complete: If
{Xα : α < κ} is a collection of subsets of κ then the equivalence classes of
△α<κ Xα and 
α<κ Xα are, respectively, the greatest lower bound and the
least upper bound of the equivalence classes [Xα] in B. It also follows that if
⟨Xα : α < κ⟩and ⟨Yα : α < κ⟩are two enumerations of the same collection,
then △α<κ Xα and △α<κ Yα diﬀer only by a nonstationary set.
Deﬁnition 8.6. An ordinal function f on a set S is regressive if f(α) < α
for every α ∈S, α > 0.
Theorem 8.7 (Fodor). If f is a regressive function on a stationary set
S ⊂κ, then there is a stationary set T ⊂S and some γ < κ such that
f(α) = γ for all α ∈T .
Proof. Let us assume that for each γ < κ, the set {α ∈S : f(α) = γ} is
nonstationary, and choose a closed unbounded set Cγ such that f(α) ̸= γ
for each α ∈S ∩Cγ. Let C = △γ<κ Cγ. The set S ∩C is stationary and if
α ∈S ∩C, we have f(α) ̸= γ for every γ < α; in other words, f(α) ≥α. This
is a contradiction.
⊓⊔

Part I. Basic Set Theory
For a regular uncountable cardinal κ and a regular λ < κ, let
(8.4)
Eκ
λ = {α < κ : cf α = λ}.
It is easy to see that each Eκ
λ is a stationary subset of κ.
The closed unbounded ﬁlter on κ is not an ultraﬁlter. This is because
there is a stationary subset of κ whose complement is stationary. If κ > ω1,
this is clear: The sets Eκ
ω and Eκ
ω1 are disjoint. If κ = ω1, the decomposition
of ω1 into disjoint stationary sets uses the Axiom of Choice.
The use of AC is necessary: It is consistent (relative to large cardinals)
that the closed unbounded ﬁlter on ω1 is an ultraﬁlter.
In Theorem 8.10 below we show that every stationary subset of κ is the
union of κ disjoint stationary sets. In the following lemma we prove a weaker
result that illustrates a typical use of Fodor’s Theorem.
Lemma 8.8. Every stationary subset of Eκ
ω is the union of κ disjoint sta-
tionary sets.
Proof. Let W ⊂{α < κ : cf α = ω} be stationary. For every α ∈W, we
choose an increasing sequence ⟨aα
n : n ∈N⟩such that limn aα
n = α. First we
show that there is an n such that for all η < κ, the set
(8.5)
{α ∈W : aα
n ≥η}
is stationary. Otherwise there is ηn and a closed unbounded set Cn such that
aα
n < ηn for all α ∈Cn ∩W, for every n. If we let η be the supremum
of the ηn and C the intersection of the Cn, we have aα
n < η for all n and
all α ∈C ∩W. This is a contradiction. Now let n be such that (8.5) is
stationary for every η < κ. Let f be the following function on W: f(α) = aα
n.
The function f is regressive; and so for every η < κ, we ﬁnd by Fodor’s
Theorem a stationary subset Sη of (8.5) and γη ≥η such that f(α) = γη
on Sη. If γη ̸= γη′, then Sη ∩Sη′ = ∅, and since κ is regular, we have
|{Sη : η < κ}| = |{γη : η < κ}| = κ.
⊓⊔
The proof easily generalizes to the case when λ > ω: Every stationary
subset of Eκ
λ the union of κ stationary sets. From that it follows that every
stationary subset W of the set {α < κ : cf α < α} admits such a decompo-
sition: By Fodor’s Theorem, there exists some λ < κ such that W ∩Eκ
λ is
stationary. The remaining case in Theorem 8.10 is when the set {α < κ : α is
a regular cardinal} is stationary and the following lemma plays the key role.
Lemma 8.9. Let S be a stationary subset of κ and assume that every α ∈S
is a regular uncountable cardinal. Then the set T = {α ∈S : S ∩α is not
a stationary subset of α} is stationary.
Proof. We prove that T intersects every closed unbounded subset of κ. Let
C be closed unbounded. The set C′ of all limit points of C is also closed

8. Stationary Sets
95
unbounded, and hence S ∩C′ ̸= ∅. Let α be the least element of S ∩C′. Since
α is regular and a limit point of C, C ∩α is a closed unbounded subset of α,
and so is C′ ∩α. As α is the least element of S ∩C′, C′ ∩α is disjoint from
S ∩α and so S ∩α is a nonstationary subset of α. Hence α ∈T ∩C.
⊓⊔
Theorem 8.10 (Solovay). Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal. Then
every stationary subset of κ is the disjoint union of κ stationary subsets.
Proof. We follow the proof of Lemma 8.8 as much as possible. Let A be
a stationary subset of κ. By Lemma 8.8, by the subsequent discussion and
by Lemma 8.9, we may assume that the set W of all α ∈A such that α is
a regular cardinal and A ∩α is not stationary, is stationary. There exists for
each α ∈W a continuous increasing sequence ⟨aα
ξ : ξ < α⟩such that aα
ξ /∈W,
for all α and ξ, and α = limξ→α aα
ξ .
First we show that there is ξ such that for all η < κ, the set
(8.6)
{α ∈W : aα
ξ ≥η}
is stationary. Otherwise, there is for each ξ some η(ξ) and a closed unbounded
set Cξ such that aα
ξ < η(ξ) for all α ∈Cξ ∩W if aα
ξ is deﬁned. Let C be
the diagonal intersection of the Cξ. Thus if α ∈C ∩W, then aα
ξ < η(ξ) for
all ξ < α. Now let D be the closed unbounded set of all γ ∈C such that
η(ξ) < γ for all ξ < γ. Since W is stationary, W ∩D is also stationary; let
γ < α be two ordinals in W ∩D. Now if ξ < γ, then aα
ξ < η(ξ) < γ and it
follows that aα
γ = γ. This is a contradiction since γ ∈W and aα
γ /∈W.
Once we have found ξ such that (8.6) is stationary for all η < κ, we
proceed as in Lemma 8.8. Let f be the function on W deﬁned by f(α) = aα
ξ .
The function f is regressive; and so for every η < κ, we ﬁnd by Fodor’s
Theorem a stationary subset Sη of (8.6) and γη ≥η such that f(α) = γη
on Sη. If γη ̸= γη′, then Sη ∩Sη′ = ∅; and since κ is regular, we have
|{Sη : η < κ}| = |{γη : η < κ}| = κ.
⊓⊔
Mahlo Cardinals
Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal. The set of all cardinals below κ is a closed
unbounded subset of κ, and so is the set of its limit points, the set of all
limit cardinals. In fact, the set of all strong limit cardinals below κ is closed
unbounded.
If κ is the least inaccessible cardinal, then all strong limit cardinals below κ
are singular, and so the set of all singular strong limit cardinals below κ is
closed unbounded. If κ is the αth inaccessible, where α < κ, then still the set
of all regular cardinals below κ is nonstationary.
An inaccessible cardinal κ is called a Mahlo cardinal if the set of all regular
cardinals below κ is stationary.

(Then the set of all inaccessibles below κ is stationary, and κ is the κth
inaccessible cardinal.)
Similarly, we deﬁne a weakly Mahlo cardinal as a cardinal κ that is weakly
inaccessible and the set of all regular cardinals bellow κ is stationary (then
the set of all weakly inaccessibles is stationary in κ).
Normal Filters
Let F be a ﬁlter on a cardinal κ; F is normal if it is closed under diagonal
intersections:
(8.7)
if Xα ∈F for all α < κ,
then △α<κ Xα ∈F.
An ideal I on κ is normal if the dual ﬁlter is normal.
The closed unbounded ﬁlter is κ-complete and normal, and contains all
complements of bounded sets. It is the smallest such ﬁlter on κ:
Lemma 8.11. If κ is regular and uncountable and if F is a normal ﬁlter
on κ that contains all ﬁnal segments {α : α0 < α < κ}, then F contains all
closed unbounded sets.
Proof. First we note that the set C0 of all limit ordinals is in F: C0 is the
diagonal intersection of the sets Xα = {ξ : α + 1 < ξ < κ}. Now let C
be a closed unbounded set, and let C = {aα : α < κ} be its increasing
enumeration. We let Xα = {ξ : aα < ξ < κ}. Then C ⊃C0 ∩△α<κ Xα.
⊓⊔
Silver’s Theorem
We shall now apply the techniques using ultraﬁlters and stationary sets to
prove the following theorems.
Theorem 8.12 (Silver). Let κ be a singular cardinal such that cf κ > ω. If
2α = α+ for all cardinals α < κ, then 2κ = κ+.
Theorem 8.13 (Silver). If the Singular Cardinals Hypothesis holds for all
singular cardinals of coﬁnality ω, then it holds for all singular cardinals.
The proofs of both theorems use the following lemma:
Lemma 8.14. Let κ be a singular cardinal, let cf κ > ω, and assume that
λcf κ < κ for all λ < κ. If ⟨κα : α < cf κ⟩is a normal sequence of cardinals
such that lim κα = κ, and if the set {α < cf κ : κcf κα
α
= κ+
α} is stationary
in cf κ, then κcf κ = κ+.

8. Stationary Sets
97
If GCH holds below κ then the assumptions of Lemma 8.14 are satisﬁed,
and 2κ = κcf κ. Thus Theorem 8.12 follows from Lemma 8.14.
Proof of Theorem 8.13. We prove by induction on the coﬁnality of κ that
2cf κ < κ implies κcf κ = κ+. The assumption of the theorem is that this
holds for each κ of coﬁnality ω. Thus let κ be of uncountable coﬁnality and
let 2cf κ < κ. Using the induction hypothesis and the proof of Theorem 5.22(ii)
one veriﬁes, by induction on λ, that λcf κ < κ for all λ < κ.
Let ⟨κα : α < cf κ⟩be any normal sequence of cardinals such that lim κα =
κ. The set S = {α < cf κ : cf κα = ω and 2ℵ0 < κα} is clearly stationary
in cf κ, and for every α ∈S, κcf κα
α
= κ+
α by the assumption. Hence κcf κ = κ+.
⊓⊔
We now proceed toward a proof of Lemma 8.14. To simplify the notation,
we shall consider the special case when
κ = ℵω1.
The general case is proved in a similar way.
Let f and g be two functions on ω1. We say that f and g are almost
disjoint if there is α0 < ω1 such that f(α) ̸= g(α) for all α ≥α0. A family F
of functions on ω1 is an almost disjoint family if any two distinct f, g ∈F
are almost disjoint.
Lemma 8.14 follows from
Lemma 8.15. Assume that ℵℵ1
α < ℵω1 for all α < ω1. Let F be an almost
disjoint family of functions
F ⊂

α<ω1
Aα,
such that the set
(8.8)
{α < ω1 : |Aα| ≤ℵα+1}
is stationary. Then |F| ≤ℵω1+1.
[In the general case, we consider almost disjoint functions on cf κ.]
Proof of Lemma 8.14 from Lemma 8.15. We assume that ℵℵ1
α
< ℵω1 and
that ℵcf ℵα
α
= ℵα+1 for a stationary set of α’s; we want to show that
ℵℵ1
ω1 = ℵω1+1. For every h : ω1 →ℵω1, we let fh = ⟨hα : α < ω1⟩, where
dom hα = ω1 and
hα(ξ) =
h(ξ)
if h(ξ) < ℵα,
0
otherwise,
and let F = {fh : h ∈ℵω1
ω1}. If h ̸= g, then fh and fg are almost disjoint.
Moreover,
F ⊂

α<ω1
ℵα
ω1.

98
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Since for a stationary set of α’s, ℵℵ1
α
= ℵα+1 (namely for all α such that
ℵα > 2ℵ1 and ℵℵ0
α = ℵα+1), we have |F| ≤ℵω1+1, and so |ℵω1
ω1| = ℵω1+1.
[In the general case of Lemma 8.14 we have to show that
{α < cf κ : κcf κα
α
= κ+
α}
is stationary. Note that the set
C = {α : α is a limit ordinal and (∀λ < κα) λcf κ < κα}
is closed unbounded in cf κ; if α ∈C, then cf κα < cf κ and we have κcf κ
α
=
κcf α
α
.]
⊓⊔
The ﬁrst step in the proof of Lemma 8.15 is
Lemma 8.16. Assume that ℵℵ1
α < ℵω1 for all α < ω1. Let F be an almost
disjoint family of functions
F ⊂

α<ω1
Aα
such that the set
(8.9)
{α < ω1 : |Aα| ≤ℵα}
is stationary. Then |F| ≤ℵω1.
(The assumption (8.8) is replaced by (8.9) and the bound for |F| is ℵω1
rather than ℵω1+1.)
Proof. We may as well assume that each Aα is a set of ordinals and that
Aα ⊂ωα for all α in some stationary subset of ℵ1. Let
S0 = {α < ω1 : α is a limit ordinal and Aα ⊂ωα}.
Thus if f ∈F, then f(α) < ωα for all α ∈S0. Given f ∈F, we can ﬁnd for
each α > 0 in S0 some β < α such that f(α) < ωβ; call this β = g(α). The
function g is regressive on S, and by Fodor’s Theorem there is a stationary
S ⊂S0 such that g is constant on S. In other words, the function f is bounded
on S, by some ωγ < ωω1.
We assign to each f a pair (S, f↾S) where S ⊂S0 is a stationary set and
f↾S is a bounded function. For any S, if f↾S = g↾S, then f = g since any
two distinct functions in F are almost disjoint. Thus the correspondence
f →(S, f↾S)
is one-to-one.
For a given S, the number of bounded functions on S is at most

γ<ω1
ℵ|S|
γ
= supγ<ω1 ℵℵ1
γ = ℵω1.
Since |P(ω1)| = 2ℵ1 < ℵω1, the number of pairs (S, f↾S) is at most ℵω1.
Hence |F| ≤ℵω1.
⊓⊔

8. Stationary Sets
99
Proof of Lemma 8.15. Let U be an ultraﬁlter on ω1 that extends the closed
unbounded ﬁlter. Every S ∈U is stationary.
We may assume that each Aα is a subset of ωα+1. For every f, g ∈F, let
(8.10)
f < g if and only if {α < ω1 : f(α) < g(α)} ∈U.
Since U is a ﬁlter, the relation f < g is transitive. Since U is an ultraﬁlter,
and {α : f(α) = g(α)} /∈U for distinict f, g ∈F, the relation f < g is a linear
ordering of F. For every f ∈F, let Ff = {g ∈F : for some stationary set T ,
g(α) < f(α) for all α ∈T }. By Lemma 8.16, |Ff| ≤ℵω1. If g < f, then
g ∈Ff, and so |{g ∈F : g < f}| ≤ℵω1. It follows that |F| ≤ℵω1+1.
⊓⊔
A Hierarchy of Stationary Sets
If α is a limit ordinal of uncountable coﬁnality, it still makes sense to
talk about closed unbounded and stationary subsets of α. Since cf α > ω,
Lemma 8.2 holds, and the closed unbounded sets generate a ﬁlter on α. The
closed unbounded ﬁlter is cf α-complete. A set S ⊂α is stationary if and only
if for some (or for any) normal function f : cf α →α, f−1(S) is a stationary
subset of cf α.
Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal, and let us consider the following
operation (the Mahlo operation) on stationary sets:
Deﬁnition 8.17. If S ⊂κ is stationary, the trace of S is the set
Tr(S) = {α < κ : cf α > ω and S ∩α is stationary}.
The Mahlo operation is invariant under equivalence mod INS and can
thus be considered as an operation on the Boolean algebra P(κ)/INS (see
Exercise 8.11).
In the context of closed unbounded and stationary sets we use the phrase
for almost all α ∈S to mean that the set of all contrary α ∈S is nonsta-
tionary.
Deﬁnition 8.18. Let S and T be stationary subsets of κ.
S < T
if and only if
S ∩α is stationary for almost all α ∈T .
(It is implicit in the deﬁnition that almost all α ∈T have uncountable coﬁ-
nality.)
As an example, if λ < µ are regular, then Eκ
λ < Eκ
µ. The following prop-
erties are easily veriﬁed:
Lemma 8.19.
(i) A < Tr(A),

100
Part I. Basic Set Theory
(ii) if A < B and B < C then A < C,
(iii) if A < B, A ≃A′ mod INS and B ≃B′ mod INS then A′ < B′.
⊓⊔
Thus < is a transitive relation on P(κ)/INS. The next theorem shows that
it is a well-founded partial ordering:
Theorem 8.20 (Jech). The relation < is well-founded.
Proof. Assume to the contrary that there exist stationary sets such that
A1 > A2 > A3 . . .. Therefore there exist closed unbounded sets Cn such that
An ∩Cn ⊂Tr(An+1) for n = 1, 2, 3, . . . . For each n, let
Bn = An ∩Cn ∩Lim(Cn+1) ∩Lim(Lim(Cn+2)) ∩. . .
where Lim(C) is the set of all limit points of C.
Each Bn is stationary, and for every n, Bn ⊂Tr(Bn+1). Let αn = min Bn.
Since Bn+1 ∩αn is stationary, we have αn+1 < αn and therefore, a decreasing
sequence α1 > α2 > . . .. A contradiction.
⊓⊔
The rank of a stationary set A ⊂κ in the well-founded relation < is called
the order of the set A, and the height of < is the order of the cardinal κ:
o(A) = sup{o(X) + 1 : X < A},
o(κ) = sup{o(A) + 1 : A ⊂κ is stationary}.
We also deﬁne o(ℵ0) = 0, and o(α) = o(cf α) for every limit ordinal α. Note
that o(Eκ
ω) = 0, o(Eκ
ω1) = 1, o(ℵ1) = 1, o(ℵ2) = 2, etc. See Exercises 8.13
and 8.14.
The Closed Unbounded Filter on Pκ(λ)
We shall now consider a generalization of closed unbounded and stationary
sets, to the space Pκ(λ). This generalization replaces (κ, <) with the structure
(Pκ(λ), ⊂).
Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal and let A be a set of cardinality
at least κ.
Deﬁnition 8.21. A set X ⊂Pκ(A) is unbounded if for every x ∈Pκ(A)
there exists a y ⊃x such that y ∈X.
A set X ⊂Pκ(A) is closed if for any chain x0 ⊂x1 ⊂. . . ⊂xξ ⊂. . .,
ξ < α, of sets in X, with α < κ, the union 
ξ<α xξ is in X.
A set C ⊂Pκ(A) is closed unbounded if it is closed and unbounded.
A set S ⊂Pκ(A) is stationary if S ∩C ̸= ∅for every closed unbounded
C ⊂Pκ(A).
The closed unbounded ﬁlter on Pκ(A) is the ﬁlter generated by the closed
unbounded sets.

8. Stationary Sets
101
When |A| = |B| then Pκ(A) and Pκ(B) are isomorphic, with closed un-
bounded and stationary sets corresponding to closed unbounded and sta-
tionary sets, and so it often suﬃces to consider such sets in Pκ(λ) where λ is
a cardinal ≥κ.
When |A| = κ, then the set κ ⊂Pκ(κ) is closed unbounded, and the
closed unbounded ﬁlter on κ is the restriction to κ of the closed unbounded
ﬁlter on Pκ(κ).
Theorem 8.22 (Jech). The closed unbounded ﬁlter on Pκ(A) is κ-complete.
Proof. This is a generalization of Theorem 8.3. First we proceed as in
Lemma 8.2 and show that if C and D are closed unbounded then C ∩D
is closed unbounded. Both proofs have straightforward generalizations from
(κ, <) to (Pκ(A), ⊂).
⊓⊔
Fodor’s Theorem also generalizes to Pκ(A); with regressive functions re-
placed by choice functions. The diagonal intersection of subsets of Pκ(A) is
deﬁned as follows
△
a∈A
Xa = {x ∈Pκ(A) : x ∈
a∈x
Xa}.
Lemma 8.23. If {Ca : a ∈A} is a collection of closed unbounded subsets
of Pκ(A) then its diagonal intersection is closed unbounded.
Proof. Let C = △a∈A Ca. First we show that C is closed. Let x0 ⊂x1 ⊂
. . . ⊂xξ ⊂. . ., ξ < α, be a chain in C, with α < κ, and let x be its union. To
show that x ∈C, let a ∈x and let us show that x ∈Ca. There is some η < α
such that a ∈xξ for all ξ ≥η; hence xξ ∈Ca for all ξ ≥η, and so x ∈Ca.
Now we show that C is unbounded. Let x0 ∈Pκ(A), we shall ﬁnd an
x ∈C such that x ⊃x0. By induction, we ﬁnd x0 ⊂x1 ⊂. . . ⊂xn ⊂. . .,
n ∈N, such that xn+1 ∈
a∈xn Ca; this is possible because each 
a∈xn Ca
is closed unbounded. Then we let x = ∞
n=0 xn and show that x ∈Ca for
all a ∈x. But if a ∈x then a ∈xk for some k, and then xn ∈Ca for all
n ≥k + 1. Hence x ∈Ca.
⊓⊔
Theorem 8.24 (Jech). If f is a function on a stationary set S ⊂Pκ(λ)
and if f(x) ∈x for every nonempty x ∈S, then there exist a stationary set
T ⊂S and some a ∈A such that f(x) = a for all a ∈T .
Proof. The proof uses Lemma 8.23 and generalizes the proof of Theorem 8.7.
⊓⊔
Let us call a set D ⊂Pκ(A) directed if for all x and y in D there is a z ∈D
such that x ∪y ⊂z.
Lemma 8.25. If C is a closed subset of Pκ(A) then for every directed set
D ⊂C with |D| < κ,  D ∈C.

102
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Proof. By induction on |D|. Let |D| = γ, D = {xα : α < γ}, and assume
the lemma holds for every directed set of cardinality < γ. By induction on
α < γ, let Dα be a smallest directed subset of D such that xα ∈Dα and
Dα ⊃
β<α Dβ. Letting yα =  Dα, we have yα ∈C for all α < γ, and
yβ ⊂yα if β < α. It follows that  D = 
α<γ yα ∈C.
⊓⊔
Consider a function f : [A]<ω →Pκ(A); a set x ∈Pκ(A) is a closure point
of f if f(e) ⊂x whenever e ⊂x. The set Cf of all closure points x ∈Pκ(A) is
a closed unbounded set. Moreover, the sets Cf generate the closed unbounded
ﬁlter:
Lemma 8.26. For every closed unbounded set C in Pκ(A) there exists
a function f : [A]<ω →Pκ(A) such that Cf ⊂C.
Proof. By induction on |e| we ﬁnd for each e ∈[A]<ω an inﬁnite set f(e) ∈C
such that e ⊂f(e) and that f(e1) ⊂f(e2) whenever e1 ⊂e2. We will show
that Cf ⊂C. Let x be a closure point of f. As x = {f(e) : e ∈[x]<ω} is
the union of a directed subset of C (of cardinality < κ), by Lemma 8.25 we
have x ∈C.
⊓⊔
Let A ⊂B (and |A| ≥κ). For X ∈Pκ(B), the projection of X to A is
the set
X↾A = {x ∩A : x ∈X}.
For Y ∈Pκ(A), the lifting of Y to B is the set
Y B = {x ∈Pκ(B) : x ∩A ∈Y }.
Theorem 8.27 (Menas). Let A ⊂B.
(i) If S is stationary in Pκ(B), then S↾A is stationary in Pκ(A).
(ii) If S is stationary in Pκ(A), then SB is stationary in Pκ(B).
Proof. (i) holds because if C is a closed unbounded set in Pκ(A), then CB
is closed unbounded in Pκ(B). For (ii), it suﬃces to prove that if C is closed
unbounded in Pκ(B), then C↾A contains a closed unbounded set.
If C ⊂Pκ(B) is closed unbounded, then by Lemma 8.26, C ⊃Cf for
some f : [B]<ω →Pκ(B). Let g : [A]<ω →Pκ(A) be the following function:
For e ∈[A]<ω, let x be the smallest closure point of f such that x ⊃e, and
let g(e) = x ∩A. Then Cf↾A = Cg (where Cf is deﬁned in Pκ(B) and Cg
in Pκ(A)), and we have Cg ⊂C↾A.
⊓⊔
When κ = ω1, Lemma 8.26 can be improved to give the following basis
theorem for [A]ω = {x ⊂A : |x| = ℵ0}. An operation on A is a function
F : [A]<ω →A. A set x is closed under F if f(e) ∈x for all e ∈[x]<ω.
Theorem 8.28 (Kueker). For every closed unbounded set C ⊂[A]ω there
is an operation F on A such that C ⊃CF = {x ∈[A]ω : x is closed under F}.

8. Stationary Sets
103
Proof. We may assume that A = λ is an inﬁnite cardinal, and let C be
a closed unbounded subset of [λ]ω. As in the proof of Lemma 8.26 there
exists a function f : [λ]<ω →C such that e ⊂f(e) and f(e1) ⊂f(e2) if
e1 ⊂e2. As each f(e) is countable, there exist functions fk, k ∈N, such that
f(e) = {fk(e) : k ∈N} for all e. Let n →(kn, mn) be a pairing function.
Now we deﬁne an operation F on λ as follows: Let F({α}) = α + 1, and
if α1 < . . . < αn, let F({α1, . . . , αn}) = fkn({α1, . . . , αmn}). It is enough to
show that if x ∈[λ]ω is closed under F then x is a closure point of f, and so
CF ⊂Cf ⊂C.
Let x be closed under F, let k ∈N and let e ∈[x]<ω; we want to show
that fk(e) ∈x. If e = {α1, . . . , αm} with α1 < . . . < αm, let n ≥m be such
that k = kn and m = mn. As x does not have a greatest element (because
F({α}) = α + 1), there are αm+1, . . . , αn ∈x such that fk({α1, . . . , αm}) =
F({α1, . . . , αn}) ∈x.
⊓⊔
Theorem 8.28 does not generalize outright to Pκ(A) for κ > ω1 (see
Exercise 8.18); we shall return to the subject in Part III.

segments Bξn ⊂Aξn of length αn + 1 where limn αn = α. Let A = S∞

Exercise 8.5 does not generalize to closed sets of uncountable length. It is not
provable in ZFC that given X ⊂ω2, either X or ω2 −X contains a closed set
of length ω1. On the other hand, this statement is consistent, relative to large
cardinals.

8. Stationary Sets
105
Historical Notes
The deﬁnition of stationary set is due to Bloch [1953], and the fundamental theo-
rem (Theorem 8.7) was proved by Fodor [1956]. (A precursor of Fodor’s Theorem
appeared in Aleksandrov-Urysohn [1929].) The concept of stationary sets is implicit
in Mahlo [1911].
Theorem 8.10 was proved by Solovay [1971] using the technique of saturated
ideals.
Mahlo cardinals are named after P. Mahlo, who in 1911–1913 investigated what
is now called weakly Mahlo cardinals. Theorems 8.12 and 8.13 are due to Sil-
ver [1975]. Silver’s proof uses generic ultrapowers; the elementary proof given here
is as in Baumgartner-Prikry [1976, 1977]. Lemma 8.16: Erd¨os, Hajnal, and Mil-
ner [1968].
Deﬁnition 8.18 and Theorem 8.20 are due to Jech [1984]. The generalization of
closed unbounded and stationary sets (Deﬁnition 8.21 and Theorems 8.22 and 8.24)
was given by Jech [1971b] and [1972/73]; Kueker [1972, 1977] also formulated
these concepts for κ = ω1 and proved Theorem 8.28. Theorem 8.27 is due to
Menas [1974/75].
Exercise 8.5: Friedman [1974].
Exercise 8.17: Carr [1982].

9. Combinatorial Set Theory
In this chapter we discuss topics in inﬁnitary combinatorics such as trees and
partition properties.
Partition Properties
Let us consider the following argument (the pigeonhole principle): If seven
pigeons occupy three pigeonholes, then at least one pigenhole is occupied by
three pigeons. More generally: If an inﬁnite set is partitioned into ﬁnitely
many pieces, then at least one piece is inﬁnite.
Recall that a partition of a set S is a pairwise disjoint family P = {Xi :
i ∈I} such that 
i∈I Xi = S. With the partition P we can associate a func-
tion F : S →I such that F(x) = F(y) if and only if x and y are in the same
X ∈P. Conversely, any function F : S →I determines a partition of S. (We
shall sometimes say that F is a partition of S.)
For any set A and any natural number n > 0,
(9.1)
[A]n = {X ⊂A : |X| = n}
is the set of all subsets of A that have exactly n elements. It is sometimes
convenient, when A is a set of ordinals, to identify [A]n with the set of all
sequences ⟨α1, . . . , αn⟩in A such that α1 < . . . < αn. We shall consider
partitions of sets [A]n for various inﬁnite sets A and natural numbers n. Our
starting point is the theorem of Ramsey dealing with ﬁnite partitions of [ω]n.
If {Xi : i ∈I} is a partition of [A]n, then a set H ⊂A is homogeneous for
the partition if for some i, [H]n is included in Xi; that is, if all the n-element
subsets of H are in the same piece of the partition.
Theorem 9.1 (Ramsey). Let n and k be natural numbers. Every partition
{X1, . . . , Xk} of [ω]n into k pieces has an inﬁnite homogeneous set.
Equivalently, for every F : [ω]n →{1, . . . , k} there exists an inﬁnite H ⊂
ω such that F is constant on [H]n.
Proof. By induction on n. If n = 1, the theorem is trivial, so we assume
that it holds for n and prove for n + 1. Let F be a function from [ω]n+1 into

108
Part I. Basic Set Theory
{1, . . . , k}. For each a ∈ω, let Fa be the function on [ω −{a}]n deﬁned as
follows:
Fa(X) = F({a} ∪X).
By the induction hypothesis, there exists for each a ∈ω and each inﬁnite
S ⊂ω an inﬁnite set HS
a ⊂S −{a} such that Fa is constant on [HS
a ]n. We
construct an inﬁnite sequence ⟨ai : i = 0, 1, 2, . . .⟩: We let S0 = ω and a0 = 0,
and
Si+1 = HSi
ai ,
ai+1 = the least element of Si+1 greater than ai.
It is clear that for each i ∈ω, the function Fai is constant on [{am : m > i}]n;
let G(ai) be its value. Now there is an inﬁnite subset H ⊂{ai : i ∈ω}
such that G is constant on H. It follows that F is constant on [H]n+1;
this is because for x1 < . . . < xn+1 in H we have F({x1, . . . , xn+1}) =
Fx1({x2, . . . , xn+1}).
⊓⊔
The following lemma explains the terminology introduced in Chapter 7
where Ramsey ultraﬁlters were deﬁned:
Lemma 9.2. Let D be a nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on ω. D is Ramsey if and
only if for all natural numbers n and k, every partition F : [ω]n →{1, . . . , k}
has a homogeneous set H ∈D.
Proof. First assume that D has the partition property stated in the lemma.
Let A be a partition of ω such that A /∈D for all A ∈A; we shall ﬁnd
X ∈D such that |X ∩A| ≤1 for all A ∈A. Let F : [ω]2 →{0, 1} be as
follows: F(x, y) = 1 if x and y are in diﬀerent members of A. If H ∈D is
homogeneous for F, then clearly H has at most one element common with
each A ∈A.
Now let us assume that D is a Ramsey ultraﬁlter. We shall ﬁrst prove
that D has the following property:
(9.2)
if X0 ⊃X1 ⊃X2 ⊃. . . are sets in D, then there is a sequence
a0 < a1 < a2 < . . . such that {an}∞
n=0 ∈D, a0 ∈X0 and an+1 ∈Xan
for all n.
Thus let X0 ⊃X1 ⊃. . . be sets in D. Since D is a p-point, there exists Y ∈D
such that each Y −Xn is ﬁnite. Let us deﬁne a sequence y0 < y1 < . . . in Y
as follows:
y0 = the least y0 ∈Y such that {y ∈Y : y > y0} ⊂X0,
y1 = the least y1 ∈Y such that y1 > y0 and {y ∈Y : y > y1} ⊂Xy0,
. . .
yn = the least yn ∈Y such that yn > yn−1 and {y ∈Y : y > yn} ⊂Xyn−1.
For each n, let An = {y ∈Y : yn < y ≤yn+1}. Since D is Ramsey, there
exists a set {zn}∞
n=0 ∈D such that zn ∈An for all n.

9. Combinatorial Set Theory
109
We observe that for each n, zn+2 ∈Xzn: Since zn+2 > yn+2, we have
zn+2 ∈Xyn+1, and since yn+1 ≥zn, we have Xyn+1 ⊂Xzn and hence
zn+2 ∈Xzn.
Thus if we let an = z2n and bn = z2n+1, for all n, then either {an}∞
n=0 ∈D
or {bn}∞
n=0 ∈D; and in either case we get a sequence that satisﬁes (9.2).
Now we use the property (9.2) to prove the partition property; we proceed
by induction on n and follow closely the proof of Ramsey’s Theorem. Let F
be a function from [ω]n+1 into {1, . . . , k}. For each a ∈ω, let Fa be the
function on [ω −{a}]n deﬁned by Fa(x) = F(x ∪{a}). By the induction
hypothesis, there exists for each a ∈ω a set Ha ∈D such that Fa is constant
on [Ha]n. There exists X ∈D such that the constant value of Fa is the same
for all a ∈X; say Fa(x) = r for all a ∈X and all x ∈[Ha]n.
For each n, let Xn = X∩H0∩H1∩. . .∩Hn. By (9.2) there exists a sequence
a0 < a1 < a2 < . . . such that a0 ∈X0 and an+1 ∈Xan for each n, and that
{an}∞
n=0 ∈D. Let H = {an}∞
n=0. It is clear that for each i ∈ω, ai ∈X and
{am : m > i} ⊂Hai. Hence Fai(x) = r for all x ∈[{am : m > i}]n, and it
follows that F is constant on [H]n+1.
⊓⊔
To facilitate our investigation of generalizations of Ramsey’s Theorem,
we shall now introduce the arrow notation. Let κ and λ be inﬁnite cardinal
numbers, let n be a natural number and let m be a (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) cardinal.
The symbol
(9.3)
κ →(λ)n
m
(read: κ arrows λ) denotes the following partition property: Every partition
of [κ]n into m pieces has a homogeneous set of size λ. In other words, every
F : [κ]n →m is constant on [H]n for some H ⊂κ such that |H| = λ. Using
the arrow notation, Ramsey’s Theorem is expressed as follows:
(9.4)
ℵ0 →(ℵ0)n
k
(n, k ∈ω).
The subscript m in (9.3) is usually deleted when m = 2, and so
κ →(λ)n
is the same as κ →(λ)n
2 .
The relation κ →(λ)n
m remains true if κ is made larger or if λ or m are
made smaller. A moment’s reﬂection is suﬃcient to see that the relation also
remains true when n is made smaller.
Obviously, the relation (9.3) makes sense only if κ ≥λ and κ > m; if
m = κ, then it is clearly false. Thus we always assume 2 ≤m < κ and λ ≤κ.
If n = 1, then (9.3) holds just in case either κ > λ, or κ = λ and cf κ > m.
We shall concentrate on the nontrivial case: n ≥2.
We start with two negative partition relations.

110
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Lemma 9.3. For all κ,
2κ ̸→(ω)2
κ.
In other words, there is a partition of 2κ into κ pieces that does not have an
inﬁnite homogeneous set.
Proof. In fact, we ﬁnd a partition that has no homogeneous set of size 3. Let
S = {0, 1}κ and let F : [S]2 →κ be deﬁned by F({f, g}) = the least α < κ
such that f(α) ̸= g(α). If f, g, h are distinct elements of S, it is impossible
to have F({f, g}) = F({f, h}) = F({g, h}).
⊓⊔
Lemma 9.4. For every κ,
2κ ̸→(κ+)2.
(Thus the obvious generalization of Ramsey’s Theorem, namely ℵ1 →
(ℵ1)2
2, is false.)
To construct a partition of [2κ]2 that violates the partition property, let
us consider the linearly ordered set (P, <) where P = {0, 1}κ, and f < g if
and only if f(α) < g(α) where α is the least α such that f(α) ̸= g(α) (the
lexicographic ordering of P).
Lemma 9.5. The lexicographically ordered set {0, 1}κ has no increasing or
decreasing κ+-sequence.
Proof. Assume that W = {fα : α < κ+} ⊂{0, 1}κ is such that fα < fβ
whenever α < β (the decreasing case is similar). Let γ ≤κ be the least γ
such that the set {fα↾γ : α < κ+} has size κ+, and let Z ⊂W be such that
|Z| = κ+ and f↾γ ̸= g↾γ for f, g ∈Z. We may as well assume that Z = W,
so let us do so.
For each α < κ+, let ξα be such that fα↾ξα = fα+1↾ξα and fα(ξα) = 0,
fα+1(ξα) = 1; clearly ξα < γ. Hence there exists ξ < γ such that ξ = ξα
for κ+ elements fα of W. However, if ξ = ξα = ξβ and fα↾ξ = fβ↾ξ, then
fβ < fα+1 and fα < fβ+1; hence fα = fβ. Thus the set {fα↾ξ : α < κ+} has
size κ+, contrary to the minimality assumption on γ.
⊓⊔
Proof of Lemma 9.4. Let 2κ = λ and let {fα : α < λ} be an enumeration
of the set P = {0, 1}κ. Let ≺be a linear ordering of λ induced by the
lexicographic ordering of P: α ≺β if fα < fβ.
Now we deﬁne a partition F : [λ]2 →{0, 1} by letting F({α, β}) = 1
when the ordering ≺of {α, β} agrees with the natural ordering; and letting
F({α, β}) = 0 otherwise. If H ⊂λ is a homogeneous set of order-type κ+,
then {fα : α ∈H} constitutes an increasing or decreasing κ+-sequence
in (P, <); a contradiction.
⊓⊔
By Lemma 9.4, the relation κ →(ℵ1)2 is false if κ ≤2ℵ0. On the other
hand, if κ > 2ℵ0, then κ →(ℵ1)2 is true, as follows from this more general
theorem:

9. Combinatorial Set Theory
111
Theorem 9.6 (Erd˝os-Rado).
ℶ+
n →(ℵ1)n+1
ℵ0 .
In particular, (2ℵ0)+ →(ℵ1)2
ℵ0.
Proof. We shall ﬁrst prove the case n = 1 since the induction step parallels
closely this case. Thus let κ = (2ℵ0)+ and let F : [κ]2 →ω be a partition
of [κ]2 into ℵ0 pieces. We want to ﬁnd a homogeneous H ⊂κ of size ℵ1.
For each a ∈κ, let Fa be a function on κ −{a} deﬁned by Fa(x) =
F({a, x}). We shall ﬁrst prove the following claim: There exists a set A ⊂κ
such that |A| = 2ℵ0 and such that for every countable C ⊂A and every
u ∈κ −C there exists v ∈A −C such that Fv agrees with Fu on C.
To prove the claim, we construct an ω1-sequence A0 ⊂A1 ⊂. . . ⊂Aα ⊂
. . ., α < ω1, of subsets of κ, each of size 2ℵ0, as follows: Let A0 be arbitrary,
and for each limit α, let Aα = 
β<α Aβ. Given Aα, there exists a set Aα+1 ⊃
Aα of size 2ℵ0 such that for each countable C ⊂Aα and every u ∈κ −C
there exists v ∈Aα+1 −C such that Fv agrees with Fu on C (because the
number of such functions is ≤2ℵ0). Then we let A = 
α<ω1 Aα, and clearly
A has the required property.
Next we choose some a ∈κ −A, and construct a sequence ⟨xα : α < ω1⟩
in A as follows: Let x0 be arbitrary, and given {xβ : β < α} = C, let xα be
some v ∈A −C such that Fv agrees with Fa on C. Let X = {xα : α < ω1}.
Now we consider the function G : X →ω deﬁned by G(x) = Fa(x). It is
clear that if α < β, then F({xα, xβ}) = Fxβ(xα) = Fa(xα) = G(xα). Since
the range of G is countable, there exists H ⊂X of size ℵ1 such that G is
constant on H. It follows that F is constant on [H]2.
Thus we have proved the theorem for n = 1. The general case is proved
by induction. Let us assume that ℶ+
n−1 →(ℵ1)n
ℵ0 and let F : [κ]n+1 →ω,
where κ = ℶ+
n . For each a ∈κ, let Fa : [κ −{a}]n →ω be deﬁned by
Fa(x) = F(x ∪{a}). As in the case n = 1, there exists a set A ⊂κ of size ℶn
such that for every C ⊂A of size |C| ≤ℶn−1 and every u ∈κ −C there
exists v ∈A −C such that Fv agrees with Fu on [C]n.
Next we choose a ∈κ −A and construct a set X = {xα : α < ℶ+
n−1} ⊂A
such that for each α, Fxα agrees with Fa on [{xβ : β < α}]n.
Then we consider G : [X]n →ω where G(x) = Fa(x). As before, if
α1 < . . . < αn+1, then F({xα1, . . . , xαn+1}) = G({xα1, . . . , xαn}). By the
induction hypothesis, there exists H ⊂X of size ℵ1 such that G is constant
on [H]n. It follows that F is constant on [H]n+1.
⊓⊔
Erd˝os and Rado proved that for each n, the partition property ℶ+
n →
(ℵ1)n+1
ℵ0
is best possible. The property also generalizes easily to larger cardi-
nals.
A natural generalization of the partition property (9.3) is when we allow λ
to be a limit ordinal, not just a cardinal. Let κ, n and m be as in (9.3) and

112
Part I. Basic Set Theory
let α > 0 be a limit ordinal. The symbol
(9.5)
κ →(α)n
m
stands for: For every F : [κ]n →m there exists an H ⊂κ of order-type α
such that F is constant on [H]n.
There are various results about the partition relation (9.5). For instance,
Baumgartner and Hajnal proved in [1973] that ℵ1 →(α)2 for all α < ω1.
The analogous case for ℵ2 is diﬀerent: If 2ℵ0 = ℵ1, then ℵ2 →(ω1)2 (by
Erd˝os-Rado), but it is consistent (with 2ℵ0 = ℵ1) that ℵ2 ̸→(ω1 + ω)2.
Among other generalizations of (9.3), we mention the following:
(9.6)
κ →(α, β)n
means that for every F : [κ]n →{0, 1}, either there exists an H1 ⊂κ of order-
type α such that F = 0 on [H1]n or there exists and H2 ⊂κ of order-type β
such that F = 1 on [H2]n.
Theorem 9.7 (Dushnik-Miller). For every inﬁnite cardinal κ,
κ →(κ, ω)2.
Proof. Let {A, B} be a partition of [κ]2. For every x ∈κ, let Bx = {y ∈κ :
x < y and {x, y} ∈B}. First let us assume that in every set X ⊂κ of
cardinality κ there exists an x ∈X such that |Bx ∩X| = κ. In this case, we
construct an inﬁnite H with [H]2 ⊂B as follows:
Let X0 = κ and x0 ∈X0 such that |Bx0 ∩X0| = κ. For each n, let Xn+1 =
Bxn ∩Xn and let xn+1 ∈Xn+1 be such that xn+1 > xn and |Bxn+1 ∩Xn+1| =
κ. Then let H = {xn}∞
n=0; it is clear that [H]2 ⊂B.
Thus let us assume, for the rest of the proof, that there exists a set S ⊂κ
of cardinality κ such that
(9.7)
for every x ∈S, |Bx ∩S| < κ.
If κ is regular, then we construct (by induction) an increasing κ-sequence
⟨xα : α < κ⟩in S such that {xα, xβ} ∈A for all α < β; this is possible
by (9.7).
Thus let us assume that κ is singular, let λ = cf κ and let ⟨κξ : ξ < λ⟩be
an increasing sequence of regular cardinals > λ with limit κ. Furthermore,
we assume that there is no inﬁnite H with [H]2 ⊂B, and that κξ →(κξ, ω)2
holds for every ξ < λ. We shall ﬁnd a set H ⊂κ of cardinality κ such that
[H]2 ⊂A.
Let {Sξ : ξ < λ} be a partition of S into disjoint sets such that Sξ = κξ.
It follows from our assumptions that there exist sets Kξ ⊂Sξ, |Kξ| = κξ,
such that [Kξ]2 ⊂A.
For every x ∈Kξ there exists, by (9.7), some α < λ such that |Bx ∩S| <
κα; since λ < κξ, there exists an α(ξ) such that the set Zξ = {x ∈Kξ :
|Bx ∩S| < κα(ξ)} has cardinality κξ.

9. Combinatorial Set Theory
113
Let ⟨ξν : ν < λ⟩be an increasing sequence of ordinals < λ such that if
ν1 < ν2 then α(ξν1) < ξν2. We deﬁne, by induction on ν,
Hν = Zξ(ν) −{Bx : x ∈
η<ν Zξ(η)}.
Clearly, |Hν| = κξ(ν), and [Hν]2 ⊂A.
Finally, we let H = 
ν<λ Hν. It follows from the construction of H that
[H]2 ⊂A.
⊓⊔
Weakly Compact Cardinals
In the positive results given by the Erd˝os-Rado Theorem, the size of the ho-
mogeneous set is smaller than the size of the set being partitioned. A natural
question arises, whether the relation κ →(κ)2 can hold for cardinals other
than κ = ω.
Deﬁnition 9.8. A cardinal κ is weakly compact if it is uncountable and
satisﬁes the partition property κ →(κ)2.
The reason for the name “weakly compact” is that these cardinals satisfy
a certain compactness theorem for inﬁnitary languages; we shall investigate
weakly compact cardinals further in Part II.
Lemma 9.9. Every weakly compact cardinal is inaccessible.
Proof. Let κ be a weakly compact cardinal. To show that κ is regular, let
us assume that κ is the disjoint union {Aγ : γ < λ} such that λ < κ
and |Aγ| < κ for each γ < λ. We deﬁne a partition F : [κ]2 →{0, 1} as
follows: F({α, β}) = 0 just in case α and β are in the same Aγ. Obviously,
this partition does not have a homogeneous set H ⊂κ of size κ.
That κ is a strong limit cardinal follows from Lemma 9.4: If κ ≤2λ
for some λ < κ, then because 2λ ̸→(λ+)2, we have κ ̸→(λ+)2 and hence
κ ̸→(κ)2.
⊓⊔
We shall prove in Chapter 17 that every weakly compact cardinal κ is the
κth inaccessible cardinal.
Trees
Many problems in combinatorial set theory can be formulated as problems
about trees.
In this chapter we discuss Suslin’s Problem as well as the use of trees in
partition calculus and large cardinals.

114
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Deﬁnition 9.10. A tree is a partially ordered set (T, <) with the property
that for each x ∈T , the set {y : y < x} of all predecessors of x is well-ordered
by <.
The αth level of T consists of all x ∈T such that {y : y < x} has order-
type α. The height of T is the least α such that the αth level of T is empty;
in other words, it is the height of the well-founded relation <:
(9.8)
o(x) = the order-type of {y : y < x},
αth level = {x : o(x) = α},
height(T ) = sup{o(x) + 1 : x ∈T }.
A branch in T is a maximal linearly ordered subset of T . The length of
a branch b is the order-type of b. An α-branch is a branch of length α.
We shall now turn our attention to Suslin’s Problem introduced in Chap-
ter 4. In Lemma 9.14 below we show that the problem can be restated as
a question about the existence of certain trees of height ω1.
Suslin’s Problem asks whether the real line is the only complete dense
unbounded linearly ordered set that satisﬁes the countable chain condition.
An equivalent question is whether every dense linear ordering that satisﬁes
the countable chain condition is separable, i.e., has a countable dense subset.
Deﬁnition 9.11. A Suslin line is a dense linearly ordered set that satisﬁes
the countable chain condition and is not separable.
Thus Suslin’s Problem asks whether a Suslin line exists. We shall show
that the existence of a Suslin line is equivalent to the existence of a Suslin
tree.
Let T be a tree. An antichain in T is a set A ⊂T such that any two
distinct elements x, y of A are incomparable, i.e., neither x < y nor y < x.
Deﬁnition 9.12. A tree T is a Suslin tree if
(i) the height of T is ω1;
(ii) every branch in T is at most countable;
(iii) every antichain in T is at most countable.
For the formulation of Suslin’s Problem in terms of trees it is useful to
consider Suslin trees that are called normal.
Let α be an ordinal number, α ≤ω1. A normal α-tree is a tree T with
the following properties:
(i) height(T ) = α;
(ii) T has a unique least point (the root);
(iii) each level of T is at most countable;
(iv) if x is not maximal in T , then there are inﬁnitely many y > x at
the next level (immediate successors of x);
(9.9)

9. Combinatorial Set Theory
115
(v) for each x ∈T there is some y > x at each higher level less
than α;
(vi) if β < α is a limit ordinal and x, y are both at level β and if
{z : z < x} = {z : z < y}, then x = y.
See Exercise 9.6 for a representation of normal trees.
Lemma 9.13. If there exists a Suslin tree then there exists a normal Suslin
tree.
Proof. Let T be a Suslin tree. T has height ω1, and each level of T is count-
able. We ﬁrst discard all points x ∈T such that Tx = {y ∈T : y ≥x} is at
most countable, and let T1 = {x ∈T : Tx is uncountable}. Note that if x ∈T1
and α > o(x), then |Ty| = ℵ1 for some y > x at level α. Hence T1 satisﬁes
condition (v). Next, we satisfy property (vi): For every chain C = {z : z < y}
in T1 of limit length we add an extra node aC and stipulate that z < aC for
all z ∈C, and aC < x for every x such that x > z for all z ∈C. The resulting
tree T2 satisﬁes (iii), (v) and (vi). For each x ∈T2 there are uncountably
many branching points z > x, i.e., points that have at least two immediate
successors (because there is no uncountable chain and T2 satisﬁes (v)). The
tree T3 = {the branching points of T2} satisﬁes (iii), (v) and (vi) and each
x ∈T3 is a branching point. To get property (iv), let T4 consists of all z ∈T3
at limit levels of T3. The tree T4 satisﬁes (i), (iii), (iv), and (v); and then
T5 ⊂T4 satisfying (ii) as well is easily obtained.
⊓⊔
Lemma 9.14. There exists a Suslin line if and only if there exists a Suslin
tree.
Proof. (a) Let S be a Suslin line. We shall construct a Suslin tree. The tree
will consist of closed (nondegenerate) intervals on the Suslin line S. The
partial ordering of T is by inverse inclusion: If I, J ∈T , then I ≤J if and
only if I ⊃J.
The collection T of intervals is constructed by induction on α < ω1. We
let I0 = [a0, b0] be arbitrary (such that a0 < b0). Having constructed Iβ,
β < α, we consider the countable set C = {aβ : β < α} ∪{bβ : β < α} of
endpoints of the intervals Iβ, β < α. Since S is a Suslin line, C is not dense
in S and so there exists an interval [a, b] disjoint from C; we pick some such
[aα, bα] = Iα. The set T = {Iα : α < ω1} is uncountable and partially ordered
by ⊃. If α < β, then either Iα ⊃Iβ or Iα is disjoint from Iβ. It follows that
for each α, {I ∈T : I ⊃Iα} is well-ordered by ⊃and thus T is a tree.
We shall show that T has no uncountable branches and no uncountable
antichains. Then it is immediate that the height of T is at most ω1; and since
every level is an antichain and T is uncountable, we have height(T ) = ω1.
If I, J ∈T are incomparable, then they are disjoint intervals of S; and
since S satisﬁes the countable chain condition, every antichain in T is at most
countable. To show that T has no uncountable branch, we note ﬁrst that if

116
Part I. Basic Set Theory
b is a branch of length ω1, then the left endpoints of the intervals I ∈B
form an increasing sequence {xα : α < ω1} of points of S. It is clear that the
intervals (xα, xα+1), α < ω1, form a disjoint uncountable collection of open
intervals in S, contrary to the assumption that S satisﬁes the countable chain
condition.
(b) Let T be a normal Suslin tree. The line S will consist of all branches
of T (which are all countable). Each x ∈T has countably many immediate
successors, and we order these successors as rational numbers. Then we order
the elements of S lexicographically: If α is the least level where two branches
a, b ∈S diﬀer, then α is a successor ordinal and the points aα ∈a and bα ∈b
are both successors of the same point at level α −1; we let a < b or b < a
according to whether aα < bα or bα < aα.
It is easy to see that S is linearly ordered and dense. If (a, b) is an open
interval in S, then one can ﬁnd x ∈T such that Ix ⊂(a, b), where Ix is the
interval Ix = {c ∈S : x ∈c}. And if Ix and Iy are disjoint, then x and y are
incomparable points of T . Thus every disjoint collection of open intervals of S
must be at most countable, and so S satisﬁes the countable chain condition.
The line S is not separable: If C is a countable set of branches of T , let α
be a countable ordinal bigger than the length of any branches b ∈C. Then if
x is any point at level α, the interval Ix does not contain any b ∈C, and so
C is not dense in S.
⊓⊔
Lemma 9.14 reduces Suslin’s Problem to a purely combinatorial problem.
In Part II we shall return to it and show that the problem is independent of
the axioms of set theory.
We now turn our attention to the following problem, related to Suslin
trees.
Deﬁnition 9.15. An Aronszajn tree is a tree of height ω1 all of whose levels
are at most countable and which has no uncountable branches.
Theorem 9.16 (Aronszajn). There exists an Aronszajn tree.
Proof. We construct a tree T whose elements are some bounded increasing
transﬁnite sequences of rational numbers. If x, y ∈T are two such sequences,
then we let x ≤y just in case y extends x, i.e., x ⊂y. Also, if y ∈T and x is
an initial segment of y, then we let x ∈T ; thus the αth level of T will consist
of all those x ∈T whose length is α.
It is clear that an uncountable branch in T would yield an increasing
ω1-sequence of rational numbers, which is impossible. Thus T will be an
Aronszajn tree, provided we arrange that T has ℵ1 levels, all of them at
most countable. We construct T by induction on levels. For each α < ω1
we construct a set Uα of increasing α-sequences of rationals; Uα will be the
αth level of T . We construct the Uα so that for each α, |Uα| ≤ℵ0, and that:
For each β < α, each x ∈Uβ and each q > sup x there is y ∈Uα such
that x ⊂y and q ≥sup y.
(9.10)

9. Combinatorial Set Theory
117
Condition (9.10) enables us to continue the construction at limit steps.
To start, we let U0 = {∅}. The successor steps of the construction are also
fairly easy. Given Uα, we let Uα+1 be the set of all extensions x⌢r of sequences
in Uα such that r > sup x. It is clear that since Uα satisﬁes condition (9.10),
Uα+1 satisﬁes it also (for α + 1), and it is equally clear that Uα+1 is at most
countable.
Thus let α be a limit ordinal (α < ω1) and assume that we have con-
structed all levels Uγ, γ < α, of T below α, and that all the Uγ satisfy (9.10);
we shall construct Uα. The points x ∈T below level α form a (normal) tree Tα
of length α. We claim that Tα has the following property:
For each x ∈Tα and each q > sup x there is an increasing α-sequence
of rationals y such that x ⊂y and q ≥sup y and that y↾β ∈Tα for
all β < α.
(9.11)
The last condition means that {y↾β : β < α} is a branch in Tα. To prove the
claim, we let αn, n = 0, 1, . . . , be an increasing sequence of ordinals such
that x ∈Uα0 and limn αn = α, and let {qn}∞
n=0 be an increasing sequence
of rational numbers such that q0 > sup x and limn qn ≤q. Using repeatedly
condition (9.10), for all αn (n = 0, 1, . . . ), we can construct a sequence
y0 ⊂y1 ⊂. . . ⊂yn . . . such that y0 = x, yn ∈Uαn, and sup yn ≤qn for
each n. Then we let y = ∞
n=0 yn; clearly, y satisﬁes (9.11).
Now we construct Uα as follows: For each x ∈Tα and each rational
number q such that q > sup x, we choose a branch y in Tα that satisﬁes (9.11),
and let Uα consists of all these y : α →Q. The set Uα so constructed is
countable and satisﬁes condition (9.10).
Then T = 
α<ω1 Uα is an Aronszajn tree.
⊓⊔
The Aronszajn tree constructed in Theorem 9.16 has the property that
there exists a function f : T →R such that f(x) < f(y) whenever x < y
(Exercise 9.8). With a little more care, one can construct T so that there is
a function f : T →Q such that f(x) < f(y) if x < y. Such trees are called
special Aronszajn trees. In Part II we’ll show that it is consistent that all
Aronszajn trees are special.
Almost Disjoint Sets and Functions
In combinatorial set theory one often consider families of sets that are as
much diﬀerent as possible; a typical example is an almost disjoint family of
inﬁnite sets—any two intersect in a ﬁnite set. Here we present a sample of
results and problems of this kind.
Deﬁnition 9.17. A collection of ﬁnite sets Z is called a ∆-system if there
exists a ﬁnite set S such that X ∩Y = S for any two distinct sets X, Y ∈Z.

118
Part I. Basic Set Theory
The following theorem is often referred to as the ∆-Lemma:
Theorem 9.18 (Shanin). Let W be an uncountable collection of ﬁnite sets.
Then there exists an uncountable Z ⊂W that is a ∆-system.
Proof. Since W is uncountable, it is clear that uncountably many X ∈W
have the same size; thus we may assume that for some n, |X| = n for all
X ∈W. We prove the theorem by induction on n. If n = 1, the theorem is
trivial. Thus assume that the theorem holds for n, and let W be such that
|X| = n + 1 for all X ∈W.
If there is some element a that belongs to uncountably many X ∈W,
we apply the induction hypothesis to the collection {X −{a} : X ∈W and
a ∈X}, and obtain Z ⊂W with the required properties.
Otherwise, each a belongs to at most countably many X ∈W, and we
construct a disjoint collection Z = {Xα : α < ω1} as follows, by induction
on α. Given Xξ, ξ < α, we ﬁnd X = Xα ∈W that is disjoint from all Xξ,
ξ < α.
⊓⊔
For an alternative proof, using Fodor’s Theorem, see Exercise 9.10. The-
orem 9.18 generalizes to greater cardinals, under the assumption of GCH:
Theorem 9.19. Assume κ<κ = κ. Let W be a collection of sets of cardi-
nality less than κ such that |W| = κ+. Then there exist a collection Z ⊂W
such that |Z| = κ+ and a set A such that X ∩Y = A for any two distinct
elements X, Y ∈Z.
⊓⊔
Deﬁnition 9.20. If X and Y are inﬁnite subsets of ω then X and Y are
almost disjoint if X ∩Y is ﬁnite.
Let κ be a regular cardinal. If X ∩Y are subsets of κ of cardinality κ then
X and Y are almost disjoint if |X ∩Y | < κ.
An almost disjoint family of sets is a family of pairwise almost disjoint
sets.
Lemma 9.21. There exists an almost disjoint family of 2ℵ0 subsets of ω.
Proof. Let S be the set of all ﬁnite 0–1 sequences: S = ∞
n=0{0, 1}n. For every
f : ω →{0, 1}, let Af ⊂S be the set Af = {s ∈S : s ⊂f} = {f↾n : n ∈ω}.
Clearly, Af ∩Ag is ﬁnite if f ̸= g; thus {Af : f ∈{0, 1}ω} is a family of
2ℵ0 almost disjoint subsets of the countable set S, and the lemma follows.
⊓⊔
A generalization from ω to arbitrary regular κ is not provable in ZFC (al-
though under GCH the generalization is straightforward; see Exercise 9.11).
Without assuming the GCH, the best one can do is to ﬁnd an almost disjoint
family of κ+ subsets of κ; this follows from Lemma 9.23 below.
Deﬁnition 9.22. Let κ be a regular cardinal. Two functions f and g on κ
are almost disjoint if |{α : f(α) = g(α)}| < κ.

9. Combinatorial Set Theory
119
Lemma 9.23. For every regular cardinal κ, there exists an almost disjoint
family of κ+ functions from κ to κ.
Proof. It suﬃces to show that given κ almost disjoint functions {fν : ν < κ},
then there exists f : κ →κ almost disjoint from all fν, ν < κ; this we do by
diagonalization: Let f(α) ̸= fν(α) for all ν < α.
⊓⊔
Let us consider the special case when κ = ω1.
Deﬁnition 9.24. A tree (T, <) is a Kurepa tree if:
(i) height(T ) = ω1;
(ii) each level of T is at most countable;
(iii) T has at least ℵ2 uncountable branches.
If T is a Kurepa tree, then the family of all ω1-branches is an almost
disjoint family of uncountable subsets of T . In fact, since the levels of T are
countable, we can identify the ω1-branches with the functions from ω1 into ω
and get the following result:
There exists an almost disjoint family of ℵ2
functions f : ω1 →ω.
Lemma 9.25. A Kurepa tree exists if and only if there exists a family F of
subsets of ω1 such that:
(i) |F| ≥ℵ2;
(ii) for each α < ω1, |{X ∩α : X ∈F}| ≤ℵ0.
(9.12)
Proof. (a) Let (T, <T) be a Kurepa tree. Since T has size ℵ1, we may assume
that T = ω1, and moreover that α < β whenever α <T β. If we let F be the
family of all ω1-branches of T , then F satisﬁes (9.12).
(b) Let F be a family of subsets of ω1 such that (9.12) holds. For each
X ∈F, let fX be the functions on ω1 deﬁned by
fX(α) = X ∩α
(α < ω1).
For each α < ω1, let Uα = {fX↾α : X ∈F} and let T = 
α<ω1 Uα. Then
(T, ⊂) is a tree, the Uα are the levels of T and the functions fX correspond
to branches of T . By (9.12)(ii), every Uα is countable, and it follows that T is
a Kurepa tree.
⊓⊔
The existence of a Kurepa tree is independent of the axioms of set theory.
In fact, the nonexistence of Kurepa trees is equiconsistent with an inaccessible
cardinal.

Part I. Basic Set Theory
The Tree Property and Weakly Compact Cardinals
Generalizing the concept of Aronszajn tree to cardinals > ω1 we say that
a regular uncountable cardinal κ has the tree property if every tree of height κ
whose levels have cardinality < κ has a branch of cardinality κ.
Lemma 9.26.
(i) If κ is weakly compact, then κ has the tree property.
(ii) If κ is inaccessible and has the tree property, then κ is weakly compact,
and in fact κ →(κ)2
m for every m < κ.
Proof. (i) Let κ be weakly compact and let (T, <T) be a tree of height κ such
that each level of T has size < κ. Since κ is inaccessible, |T | = κ and we
may assume that T = κ. We extend the partial ordering <T of κ to a linear
ordering ≺: If α <T β, then we let α ≺β; if α and β are incomparable and if
ξ is the ﬁrst level where the predecessors αξ, βξ of α and β are distinct, we
let α ≺β if and only if αξ < βξ.
Let F : [κ]2 →{0, 1} be the partition deﬁned by F({α, β}) = 1 if and
only if ≺agrees with < on {α, β}. By weak compactness, let H ⊂κ be
homogeneous for F, |H| = κ.
We now consider the set B ⊂κ of all x ∈κ such that {α ∈H : x <T α}
has size κ. Since every level has size < κ, it is clear that at each level there
is at least one x in B. Thus if we show that any two elements of B are
<T -comparable, we shall have proved that B is a branch in T of size κ.
Thus assume that x, y are incomparable elements of B; let x ≺y. Since
both x and y have κ successors in H, there exist α < β < γ in H such that
x <T α, y <T β, and x <T γ. By the deﬁnition of ≺, we have α ≺β and
γ ≺β. Thus F({α, β}) = 1 and F({γ, β}) = 0, contrary to the homogeneity
of H.
(ii) Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal with the tree property, and let F :
[κ]2 →I be a partition such that |I| < κ. We shall ﬁnd a homogeneous H ⊂κ
of size κ.
We construct a tree (T, ⊂) whose elements are some functions t : γ →I,
γ < κ. We construct T by induction: At step α < κ, we put into T one more
element t, calling it tα. Let t0 = ∅. Having constructed t0, . . . , tβ, . . . , β < α,
let us construct tα as follows, by induction on ξ. Having constructed tα↾ξ, we
look ﬁrst whether tα↾ξ is among the tβ, β < α (note that for ξ = 0 we have
tα↾0 = t0). If not, then we consider tα constructed: tα = tα↾ξ. If tα↾ξ = tβ
for some β < α, then we let tα(ξ) = i where i = F({β, α}).
(T, ⊂) is a tree of size κ; and since κ is inaccessible, each level of T has
size < κ and the height of T is κ. It follows from the construction that if
tβ ⊂tα, then β < α and F({β, α}) = tα(length(tβ)). By the assumption,
T has a branch B of size κ. If we now let, for each i ∈I,
(9.13)
Hi = {α : tα ∈B and t⌢
α i ∈B},

9. Combinatorial Set Theory
121
then each Hi is homogeneous for the partition F, and at least one Hi has
size κ.
⊓⊔
It should be mentioned that an argument similar to the one above, only
more complicated, shows that if κ is inaccessible and has the tree property,
then κ →(κ)n
m for all n ∈ω, m < κ.
Ramsey Cardinals
Let us consider one more generalization of Ramsey’s Theorem. Let κ be an
inﬁnite cardinal, let α be an inﬁnite limit ordinal, α ≤κ, and let m be
a cardinal, 2 ≤m < κ. The symbol
(9.14)
κ →(α)<ω
m
denotes the property that for every partition F of the set [κ]<ω = ∞
n=0[κ]n
into m pieces, there exists a set H ⊂κ of order-type α such that for each
n ∈ω, F is constant on [H]n. (Again, the subscript m is deleted when m = 2.)
It is not diﬃcult to see that the partition property ω →(ω)<ω is false
(see Exercise 9.13).
A cardinal κ is a Ramsey cardinal if κ →(κ)<ω. Clearly, every Ram-
sey cardinal is weakly compact. We shall investigate Ramsey cardinals and
property (9.14) in general in Part II.

Historical Notes
Theorem 9.1 is due to Ramsey [1929/30]. Ramsey ultraﬁlters are investigated in
Booth [1970/71]. The theory of partition relations has been developed by Erd˝os,
who has written a number of papers on the subject, some coauthored by Rado,
Hajnal, and others. The arrow notation is introduced in Erd˝os and Rado [1956].
Other major comprehensive articles on partition relations are Erd˝os, Hajnal, and
Rado [1965] and Erd˝os and Hajnal [1971].

Theorem 9.6 appears in Erd˝os and Rado [1956]. Lemma 9.4 is due to Sierpi´n-
ski [1933]. Theorem 9.7 is in Dushnik-Miller [1941].
Weakly compact cardinals (as in Deﬁnition 9.8 as well as the tree property)
were introduced by Erd˝os and Tarski in [1961].
The equivalence of Suslin’s Problem with the tree formulation (Lemma 9.14) is
due to Kurepa [1935]; this paper also presents Aronszajn’s construction and Kurepa
trees, with Lemma 9.25.

10. Measurable Cardinals
The theory of large cardinals owes its origin to the basic problem of measure
theory, the Measure Problem of H. Lebesgue.
The Measure Problem
Let S be an inﬁnite set. A (nontrivial σ-additive probabilistic) measure on S
is a real-valued function µ on P(S) such that:
(i) µ(∅) = 0 and µ(S) = 1;
(ii) if X ⊂Y , then µ(X) ≤µ(Y );
(iii) µ({a}) = 0 for all a ∈S (nontriviality);
(iv) if Xn, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , are pairwise disjoint, then
µ
 ∞

n=0
Xn

=
∞

n=0
µ(Xn)
(σ-additivity).
(10.1)
It follows from (ii) that µ(X), the measure of X, is nonnegative for every
X ⊂S; in a special case of (iv) we get µ(X ∪Y ) = µ(X) + µ(Y ) whenever
X ∩Y = ∅(ﬁnite additivity).
More generally, let A be a σ-complete algebra of sets. A measure on A
is a real-valued function µ on A satisfying (i)–(iv). Thus a measure on S is
a measure on P(S).
An example of a measure on a σ-complete algebra of sets is the Lebesgue
measure on the algebra of all Lebesgue measurable subsets of the unit in-
terval [0, 1]. The Lebesgue measure has, in addition to (i)–(iv), the following
property:
If X is congruent by translation to a measurable set Y , then X is
measurable and µ(X) = µ(Y ).
(10.2)
It is well known that there exist sets of reals that are not Lebesgue mea-
surable, and in fact that there is no measure on [0, 1] with the property (10.2)
(translation invariant measure); see Exercise 10.1.
The natural question to ask is whether the Lebesgue measure can be
extended to some measure (not translation invariant) such that all subsets

126
Part I. Basic Set Theory
of [0, 1] are measurable, or whether there exists any measure on [0, 1]. Or,
whether there exists a measure on some set S.
The investigation of this problem has lead to important discoveries in set
theory, opening up a new ﬁeld, the theory of large cardinal numbers, which
has far-reaching consequences both in pure set theory and in descriptive set
theory.
A measure µ on S is two-valued if µ(X) is either 0 or 1 for all X ⊂S. If
µ is a two-valued measure on S, let
(10.3)
U = {X ⊂S : µ(X) = 1}.
It is easy to verify that U is an ultraﬁlter on S. (For instance, if X ∈U and
Y ∈U, then X∩Y ∈U. If µ(X) = µ(Y ) = 1, then X = (X−Y )∪(X∩Y ) and
Y = (Y −X)∪(X∩Y ). If µ(X∩Y ) were not 1, then µ(X−Y ) = µ(Y −X) = 1,
and we would have µ(X ∪Y ) = 2.)
Next we note that the ultraﬁlter U is σ-complete. This is so because µ is
σ-additive, and an ultraﬁlter U on S is σ-complete if and only if there is no
partition of S into countably many disjoint parts S = ∞
n=0 Xn such that
Xn /∈U, for all n.
Thus if µ is a two-valued measure on S, U is a σ-complete ultraﬁlter on S.
Conversely, if U is a σ-complete ultraﬁlter on S, then the following function
is a two-valued measure on S:
(10.4)
µ(X) =
1
if X ∈U,
0
if X /∈U.
Let µ be a measure on S. A set A ⊂S is an atom of µ if µ(A) > 0 and if
for every X ⊂A, we have either µ(X) = 0 or µ(X) = µ(A).
If µ has an atom A, then
(10.5)
U = {X ⊂S : µ(X ∩A) = µ(A)}
is again a σ-complete ultraﬁlter on S.
A measure µ on S is atomless if it has no atoms. Then every set X ⊂S
of positive measure can be split into two disjoint sets of positive measure:
X = Y ∪Z, and µ(Y ) > 0, µ(Z) > 0.
We shall eventually prove various strong consequences of the existence of
a nontrivial σ-additive measure and establish the relationship between the
Measure Problem and large cardinals. Our starting point is the following
theorem which shows that if a measure exists, then there exists at least
a weakly inaccessible cardinal.
Theorem 10.1 (Ulam). If there is a σ-additive nontrivial measure on S,
then either there exists a two-valued measure on S and |S| is greater than
or equal to the least inaccessible cardinal, or there exists an atomless mea-
sure on 2ℵ0 and 2ℵ0 is greater than or equal to the least weakly inaccessible
cardinal.

10. Measurable Cardinals
127
Theorem 10.1 will be proved in a sequence of lemmas, which will also
provide additional information on the Measure Problem and introduce ba-
sic notions and methods of the theory of large cardinals. First we make the
following observation. Let κ be the least cardinal that carries a nontrivial
σ-additive two-valued measure. Clearly, κ is uncountable and is also the least
cardinal that has a nonprincipal countably complete ultraﬁlter. And we ob-
serve that such an ultraﬁlter is in fact κ-complete:
Lemma 10.2. Let κ be the least cardinal with the property that there is
a nonprincipal σ-complete ultraﬁlter on κ, and let U be such an ultraﬁlter.
Then U is κ-complete.
Proof. Let U be a σ-complete ultraﬁlter on κ, and let us assume that U is
not κ-complete. Then there exists a partition {Xα : α < γ} of κ such that
γ < κ, and Xα /∈U for all α < γ. We shall now use this partition to construct
a nonprincipal σ-complete ultraﬁlter on γ, thus contradicting the choice of κ
as the least cardinal that carries such an ultraﬁlter.
Let f be the mapping of κ onto γ deﬁned as follows:
f(x) = α
if and only if
x ∈Xα
(x ∈κ).
The mapping f induces a σ-complete ultraﬁlter on γ: we deﬁne D ⊂P(γ) by
(10.6)
Z ∈D
if and only if
f−1(Z) ∈U.
The ultraﬁlter D is nonprincipal: Assume that {α} ∈D for some α < γ. Then
Xα ∈U, contrary to our assumption on Xα. Thus γ carries a σ-complete
nonprincipal ultraﬁlter.
⊓⊔
Measurable and Real-Valued Measurable Cardinals
We are now ready to deﬁne the central notion of this chapter.
Deﬁnition 10.3. An uncountable cardinal κ is measurable if there exists
a κ-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter U on κ.
By Lemma 10.2, the least cardinal that carries a nontrivial two-valued σ-
additive measure is measurable. Note that if U is a κ-complete nonprincipal
ultraﬁlter on κ, then every set X ∈U has cardinality κ because every set of
smaller size is the union of fewer than κ singletons. For similar reasons, κ is
a regular cardinal because if κ is singular, then it is the union of fewer than
κ small sets. The next lemma gives a ﬁrst link of the Measure Problem with
large cardinals.
Lemma 10.4. Every measurable cardinal is inaccessible.

128
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Proof. We have just given an argument why a measurable cardinal is regular.
Let us show that measurable cardinals are strong limit cardinals. Let κ be
measurable, and let us assume that there exists λ < κ such that 2λ ≥κ; we
shall reach a contradiction.
Let S be a set of functions f : λ →{0, 1} such that |S| = κ, and let U be
a κ-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on S. For each α < λ, let Xα be that
one of the two sets {f ∈S : f(α) = 0}, {f ∈S : f(α) = 1} which is in U, and
let εα be 0 or 1 accordingly. Since U is κ-complete, the set X = 
α<λ Xα is
in U. However, X has at most one element, namely the function f that has
the values f(α) = εα. A contradiction.
⊓⊔
Let us now turn our attention to measures that are not necessarily two-
valued. Let µ be a nontrivial σ-additive measure on a set S. In analogy
with (10.3) we consider the ideal of all null sets:
(10.7)
Iµ = {X ⊂S : µ(X) = 0}.
Iµ is a nonprincipal σ-complete ideal on S. Moreover, it has these properties:
(i) {x} ∈I for every x ∈S;
(ii) every family of pairwise disjoint sets X ⊂S that are not in I is
at most countable.
(10.8)
To see that (ii) holds, note that if W is a disjoint family of set of positive
measure, then for each integer n > 0, there are only ﬁnitely many sets X ∈W
of measure ≥1/n.
A σ-complete nonprincipal ideal I on S is called σ-saturated if it satis-
ﬁes (10.8).
The following lemma is an analog of Lemma 10.2:
Lemma 10.5.
(i) Let κ be the least cardinal that carries a nontrivial σ-additive measure
and let µ be such a measure on κ. Then the ideal Iµ of null sets is
κ-complete.
(ii) Let κ be the least cardinal with the property that there is a σ-complete
σ-saturated ideal on κ, and let I be such an ideal. Then I is κ-complete.
Proof. (i) Let us assume that Iµ is not κ-complete. There exists a collection
of null sets {Xα : α < γ} such that γ < κ and that their union X has positive
measure. We may assume without loss of generality that the sets Xα, α < γ,
are pairwise disjoint; let m = µ(X).
Let f be the following mapping of X onto γ:
f(x) = α
if and only if
x ∈Xα
(x ∈X).
The mapping f induces a measure ν on γ:
(10.9)
ν(Z) = 1
m · µ(f−1(Z)).

10. Measurable Cardinals
129
The measure ν is σ-additive and is nontrivial since ν({α}) = µ(Xα) = 0 for
each α ∈γ. This contradicts the choice of κ as the least cardinal that carries
a measure.
(ii) The proof is similar. We deﬁne an ideal J on γ by: Z ∈J if and only
if f−1(Z) ∈I. The induced ideal J is σ-complete and σ-saturated.

Let κ be an uncountable cardinal. A measure µ on S is called κ-additive

If µ is a κ-additive measure, then the ideal Iµ of null sets is κ-complete.
The converse is also true and we get a better analog of Lemma 10.2 for
real-valued measures:
Lemma 10.6. Let µ be a measure on S, and let Iµ be the ideal of null sets.
If Iµ is κ-complete, then µ is κ-additive.
Proof. Let γ < κ, and let Xα, α < γ, be disjoint subsets of S. Since the Xα
are disjoint, at most countably many of them have positive measure. Thus
let us write
{Xα : α < γ} = {Yn : n = 0, 1, 2, . . .} ∪{Zα : α < γ},

Corollary 10.7. Let κ be the least cardinal that carries a nontrivial σ-addi-
tive measure and let µ be such a measure. Then µ is κ-additive.
⊓⊔
Deﬁnition 10.8. An uncountable cardinal κ is real-valued measurable if
there exists a nontrivial κ-additive measure µ on κ.
By Corollary 10.7, the least cardinal that carries a nontrivial σ-additive
measure is real-valued measurable. We shall show that if a real-valued mea-
surable cardinal κ is not measurable, then κ ≤2ℵ0. Note that if µ is a non-
trivial κ additive measure on κ, then every set of size < κ has measure 0,
and moreover κ cannot be the union of fewer than κ sets of size < κ. Thus
a real-valued measurable cardinal is regular. We shall show that it is weakly
inaccessible.
We shall ﬁrst prove the ﬁrst claim made in the preceding paragraph.
Lemma 10.9.
(i) If there exists an atomless nontrivial σ-additive measure, then there
exists a nontrivial σ-additive measure on some κ ≤2ℵ0.
(ii) If I is a σ-complete σ-saturated ideal on S, then either there exists
Z ⊂S, such that I↾Z = {X ⊂Z : X ∈I} is a prime ideal, or there
exists a σ-complete σ-saturated ideal on some κ ≤2ℵ0.
Proof. (i) Let µ be such a measure on S. We construct a tree T of subsets
of S, partially ordered by reverse inclusion. The 0th level of T is {S}. Each
level of T consists of pairwise disjoint subsets of S of positive measure. Each
X ∈T has two immediate successors: We choose two sets Y , Z of positive
measure such that Y ∪Z = X and Y ∩Z = ∅. If α is a limit ordinal, then
the αth level consists of all intersections X = 
ξ<α Xξ such that each Xξ is
on the ξth level of T and such that X has positive measure.
We observe that every branch of T has countable length: If {Xξ : ξ < α} is
a branch in T , then the set {Yξ : ξ < α}, where Yξ = Xξ −Xξ+1, is a disjoint
collection of sets of positive measure. Consequently, T has height at most ω1.
Similarly, each level of T is at most countable, and it follows that T has at
most 2ℵ0 branches.
Let {bα : α < κ}, κ ≤2ℵ0, be an enumeration of all branches b = {Xξ :
ξ < γ} such that 
ξ<γ Xξ is nonempty; for each α < κ, let Zα = {X : X ∈
bα}. The collection {Zα : α < κ} is a partition of S into κ sets of measure 0.
We induce a measure ν on κ as follows: Let f be the mapping of S onto κ
deﬁned by
f(x) = α
if and only if
x ∈Zα
(x ∈S),
and let
ν(Z) = µ(f−1(Z))
for all Z ⊂κ. It follows that ν is a nontrivial σ-additive measure on κ.
(ii) The proof is similar. We deﬁne a tree T as above and then induce an
ideal J on κ by letting Z ∈J if and only if f−1(Z) ∈I.
⊓⊔

131
The proof of Lemma 10.9 shows that if µ is atomless, then there is a par-
tition of S into at most 2ℵ0 null sets; in other words, µ is not (2ℵ0)+-additive.
Hence if κ carries an atomless κ-additive measure, then κ ≤2ℵ0 and we have:
Corollary 10.10. If κ is a real-valued measurable cardinal, then either κ is
measurable or κ ≤2ℵ0.
More generally, if κ carries a κ-complete σ-saturated ideal, then either
κ is measurable or κ ≤2ℵ0.
⊓⊔
The measure ν obtained in Lemma 10.9(i) is atomless; this follows from
the fact that κ ≤2ℵ0 and Lemma 10.4. If there exists an atomless σ-additive
measure, then there is one on some κ ≤2ℵ0. Clearly, such a measure can
be extended to a measure on 2ℵ0: For X ⊂2ℵ0, we let µ(X) = µ(X ∩κ).
Thus we conclude that there exists an atomless σ-additive measure on the
set R of all reals. It turns out that using the same assumption, we can obtain
a σ-additive measure on R that extends Lebesgue measure. This can be done
by a slight modiﬁcation of the proof of Lemma 10.9:
Using Exercise 10.3, we construct for each ﬁnite 0–1 sequence s, a set
Xs ⊂S such that X∅= S, and for every s ∈Seq, Xs⌢0 ∪Xs⌢1 = Xs,
Xs⌢0 ∩Xs⌢1 = ∅, and µ(Xs⌢0) = µ(Xs⌢1) = 1
2 · µ(Xs⌢0). Then we deﬁne
a measure ν1 on 2ω by
ν1(Z) = µ({Xf : f ∈Z}),
where Xf = ∞
n=0 Xf↾n for each f ∈2ω. Using the mapping F : 2ω →[0, 1]
deﬁned by
F(f) =
∞

n=0
f(n)/2n+1
we obtain a nontrivial σ-additive measure ν on [0, 1]. This measure agrees
with the Lebesgue measure on all intervals [k/2n, (k + 1)/2n], and hence on
all Borel sets. Every set of Lebesgue measure 0 is included in a Borel (in fact,
Gδ) set of Lebesgue measure 0 and hence has ν-measure 0. Every Lebesgue
measurable set X can be written as X = (B−N1)∪N2, where N1 and N2 have
Lebesgue measure 0, and hence the Lebesgue measure of X is equal to ν(X).
Thus ν agrees with the Lebesgue measure on all Lebesgue measurable subsets
of [0, 1].
We shall now show that a real-valued measurable cardinal is weakly in-
accessible. The proof is by a combinatorial argument, using matrices of sets.
Deﬁnition 10.11. An Ulam matrix (more precisely, an Ulam (ℵ1, ℵ0)-
matrix) is a collection {Aα,n : α < ω1, n < ω} of subsets of ω1 such that:
(i) if α ̸= β, then Aα,n ∩Aβ,n = ∅for every n < ω;
(ii) for each α, the set ω1 −∞
n=0 Aα,n is at most countable.
(10.12)
An Ulam matrix has ℵ1 rows and ℵ0 columns. Each column consists of
pairwise disjoint sets, and the union of each row contains all but countably
many elements of ω1.

132
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Lemma 10.12. An Ulam matrix exists.
Proof. For each ξ < ω1, let fξ be a function on ω such that ξ ⊂ran(fξ). Let
us deﬁne Aα,n for α < ω1 and n < ω by
(10.13)
ξ ∈Aα,n
if and only if
fξ(n) = α.
If n < ω, then for each ξ ∈ω1 there is only one α such that ξ ∈Aα,n, namely
α = fξ(n); and we have property (i) of (10.12). If α < ω1, then for each ξ > α
there is an n such that fξ(n) = α and hence (ω1 −∞
n=0 Aα,n) ⊂α + 1; that
veriﬁes property (ii).
⊓⊔
Using an Ulam matrix, we can show that there is no measure on ω1:
Lemma 10.13. There is no nontrivial σ-additive measure on ω1. More gen-
erally, there is no σ-complete σ-saturated ideal on ω1.
Proof. Let {Aα,n : α < ω1, n < ω} be an Ulam matrix. Assuming that we
have a measure on ω1, there is for each α some n = nα such that Aα,n has
positive measure (because of (10.12)(ii)). Hence there exist an uncountable
set W ⊂ω1 and some n < ω such that nα = n for all α ∈W. Then
{Aα,n : α ∈W} is an uncountable, pairwise disjoint (by (10.12)(i)) family of
sets of positive measure; a contradiction.
⊓⊔
A straightforward generalization of Lemmas 10.12 and 10.13 gives the
result mentioned above:
Lemma 10.14. If κ = λ+, then there is no κ-complete σ-saturated ideal
on κ.
Proof. For each ξ < λ+, we let fξ be a function on λ such that ξ ⊂ran(fξ),
and let
ξ ∈Aα,η
if and only if
fξ(η) = α.
Then {Aα,η : α < λ+, η < λ} is an Ulam (λ+, λ)-matrix, that is a collection
of subsets of λ+ such that:
(i) Aα,η ∩Aβ,η = ∅whenever α ̸= β < λ+, and η < λ;
(ii) |λ+ −
η<λ Aα,η| ≤λ for each α < λ+.
(10.14)
The proof of Lemma 10.13 generalizes to show that there is no κ-complete
σ-saturated ideal on κ.

Corollary 10.15. Every real-valued measurable cardinal is weakly inacces-
sible.

133
Lemma 10.14 completes the proof of Theorem 10.1: If there is a σ-additive
nontrivial measure on S, then either the measure has an atom A and we can
construct a two-valued measure on S via a σ-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter
on A, and then |S| ≥the least measurable cardinal, which is inaccessible; or
the measure on S is atomless and we construct, as in Lemma 10.9, an atomless
measure on 2ℵ0, and then 2ℵ0 ≥the least real-valued measurable cardinal,
which is weakly inaccessible.
⊓⊔
Prior to Ulam’s work, Banach and Kuratowski proved that if the Con-
tinuum Hypothesis holds then there exists no σ-additive measure on R. We
present their proof below; in fact, Lemma 10.16 gives a slightly more general
result.
If f and g are functions from ω to ω, let f < g mean that f(n) < g(n) for
all but ﬁnitely many n ∈ω. A κ-sequence of functions ⟨fα : α < κ⟩is called
a κ-scale if fα < fβ whenever α < β, and if for every g : ω →ω there exists
an α such that g < fα.
Lemma 10.16. If there exists a κ-scale, then κ is not a real-valued measur-
able cardinal.
Proof. Let fα, α < κ, be a κ-scale. We deﬁne an (ℵ0, ℵ0)-matrix of subsets
of κ as follows: For n, k < ω, let
(10.15)
α ∈An,k
if and only if
fα(n) = k
(α ∈κ).
Since for each n and each α there is k such that α ∈An,k, we have
∞

k=0
An,k = κ
for every n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
Now assume that µ is a nontrivial κ-additive measure on κ. For each n,
let kn be such that
µ(An,0 ∪An,1 ∪. . . ∪An,kn) ≥1 −(1/2n+2),
and let Bn = An,0 ∪. . . ∪An,kn. If we let B = ∞
n=0 Bn, then we clearly have
µ(B) ≥1/2.
Let g : ω →ω be the function g(n) = kn. If α ∈B, then by the deﬁnition
of B and by (10.15), we have
fα(n) ≤g(n)
for all n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ; hence g ̸< fα. However, since B has positive measure,
B has size κ, and therefore we have g ̸< fα for coﬁnally many α < κ. This
contradicts the assumption that the fα form a scale.
⊓⊔
Corollary 10.17. If there is a measure on 2ℵ0, then 2ℵ0 > ℵ1.

134
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Proof. If 2ℵ0 = ℵ1, then there exists an ω1-scale; a scale ⟨fα : α < ω1⟩is
constructed by transﬁnite induction to ω1:
Let {gα : α < ω1} enumerate all functions from ω to ω. At stage α, we
construct, by diagonalization, a function fα such that for all β < α, fα > fβ
and fα > gβ. Then ⟨fα : α < ω1⟩is an ω1-scale.
⊓⊔
Measurable Cardinals
By Lemma 10.4, every measurable cardinal is inaccessible. While we shall
investigate measurable cardinals extensively in Part II, we now present a few
basic results that establish the relationship of measurable cardinals and the
large cardinals introduced in Chapter 9.
We recall that by Lemma 9.26, a cardinal κ is weakly compact if and only
if it is inaccessible and has the tree property.
Lemma 10.18. Every measurable cardinal is weakly compact.
Proof. Let κ be a measurable cardinal. To show that κ is weakly compact,
it suﬃces to prove the tree property. Let (T, <) be a tree of height κ with
levels of size < κ. We consider a nonprincipal κ-complete ultraﬁlter U on T .
Let B be the set of all x ∈T such that the set of all successors of x is in U.
It is clear that B is a branch in T and it is easy to verify that each level of T
has one element in B; thus B is a branch of size κ.
⊓⊔
Normal Measures
In Chapter 8 we deﬁned the notion of a normal κ-complete ﬁlter, namely
a ﬁlter closed under diagonal intersections (8.7).
Thus we call a normal κ-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter a normal mea-
sure on κ. Note that by Exercise 8.8, a measure is normal if and only if every
regressive function on a set of measure one is constant on a set of measure
one.
Lemma 10.19. If D is a normal measure on κ, then every set in D is sta-
tionary.
Proof. By Lemma 8.11, every closed unbounded set is in D, and the lemma
follows.
⊓⊔
Theorem 10.20 below shows that if κ is measurable cardinal then a normal
measure exists.
Theorem 10.20. Every measurable cardinal carries a normal measure. If
U is a nonprincipal κ-complete ultraﬁlter on κ then there exists a function
f : κ →κ such that f∗(U) = {X ⊂κ : f−1(X) ∈U} is a normal measure.

10. Measurable Cardinals
135
Proof. Let U be a nonprincipal κ-complete ultraﬁlter on κ. For f and g in κκ,
let
f ≡g
if and only if
{α < κ : f(α) = g(α)} ∈U.
It is easily seen that ≡is an equivalence relation on κκ. Let [f] denote the
equivalence class of f ∈κκ. Furthermore, if we let
f < g
if and only if
{α < κ : f(α) < g(α)} ∈U,
then < is a linear ordering of (the equivalence classes of) κκ.
There exists no inﬁnite descending sequence f0 > f1 > . . . > fn > . . .:
Otherwise, let Xn = {α : fn(α) > fn+1(α)}, and let X = ∞
n=0 Xn. X is
nonempty, and if α ∈X, we would have f0(α) > f1(α) > . . . > fn(α) > . . .,
a contradiction.
Thus < is a well-ordering of κκ/≡.
Now let f : κ →κ be the least function (in this well-ordering) with the
property that for all γ < κ, {α : f(α) > γ} ∈U. Such functions exist: for
instance, the diagonal function d(α) = α has this property.
Let D = f∗(U) = {X ⊂κ : f−1(X) ∈U}. We claim that D is a normal
measure.
It is easy to verify that D is a κ-complete ultraﬁlter. For every γ < κ, we
have f−1({γ}) /∈U, and so {γ} /∈D, and so D is nonprincipal.
In order to show that D is normal, let h be a regressive function on a set
X ∈D. We shall show that h is constant on a set in D. Let g be the function
deﬁned by g(α) = h(f(α)). As g(α) < f(α) for all α ∈f−1(X), we have
g < f, and it follows by the minimality of f that g is constant on some
Y ∈U. Hence h is constant on f(Y ) and f(Y ) ∈D.
⊓⊔
As an application of normal measures we show that every measurable
cardinal is a Mahlo cardinal, and improve Lemma 10.18 by showing that
every measurable cardinal is a Ramsey cardinal.
Lemma 10.21. Every measurable cardinal is a Mahlo cardinal.
Proof. Let κ be a measurable cardinal. We shall show that the set of all
inaccessible cardinals α < κ is stationary. As κ is strong limit, the set of all
strong limit cardinals α < κ is closed unbounded, and it suﬃces to show that
the set of all regular cardinals α < κ is stationary.
Let D be a normal measure on κ. We claim that {α < κ : α is regu-
lar} ∈D; this will complete the proof, since every set in D is stationary, by
Lemma 10.19.
Toward a contradiction, assume that {α : cf α < α} ∈D. By normality,
there is some λ < κ such that Eλ = {α : cf α = λ} ∈D. For each α ∈Eλ,
let ⟨xα,ξ : ξ < λ⟩be an increasing sequence with limit α. For each ξ < λ
there exist yξ and Aξ ∈D such that xα,ξ = yξ for all α ∈Aξ. Let A =

ξ<λ Aξ. Then A ∈D, but A contains only one element, namely limξ→λ yξ;
a contradiction.

Part I. Basic Set Theory
Theorem 10.22. Let κ be a measurable cardinal, let D be a normal measure
on κ, and let F be a partition of [κ]<ω into less than κ pieces. Then there
exists a set H ∈D homogeneous for F. Hence every measurable cardinal is
a Ramsey cardinal.
Proof. Let D be a normal measure on κ, and let F be a partition of [κ]<ω
into fewer than κ pieces. It suﬃces to show that for each n = 1, 2, . . . ,
there is Hn ∈D such that F is constant on [Hn]n; then H = ∞
n=1 Hn is
homogeneous for F.
We prove, by induction on n, that every partition of [κ]n into fewer than κ
pieces is constant on [H]n for some H ∈D. The assertion is trivial for n = 1,
so we assume that it is true for n and prove that it holds also for n + 1. Let
F : [κ]n+1 →I, where |I| < κ. For each α < κ, we deﬁne Fα on [κ −{α}]n
by Fα(x) = F({α} ∪x).
By the induction hypothesis, there exists for each α < κ a set Xα ∈D
such that Fα is constant on [Xα]n; let ia be its constant value. Let X be the
diagonal intersection X = {α < κ : α ∈
γ<α Xγ}. We have X ∈D since
D is normal; also, if γ < α1 < . . . < αn are in X, then {α1, . . . , αn} ∈[Xγ]n
and so F({γ, α1, . . . , αn}) = Fγ({α1, . . . , αn}) = iγ. Now, there exist i ∈I
and H ⊂X in D such that iγ = i for all γ ∈H. It follows that F(x) = i for
all x ∈[H]n+1.
⊓⊔
Strongly Compact and Supercompact Cardinals
Among the various large cardinals that we shall investigate in more detail
in Part II there are two that are immediate generalizations of measurable
cardinals.
Deﬁnition 10.23. An uncountable cardinal κ is strongly compact if for any
set S, every κ-complete ﬁlter on S can be extended to a κ-complete ultraﬁlter
on S.
Clearly, every strongly compact cardinal is measurable.
Let A be a set of size at least κ, and let us consider the ﬁlter F on Pκ(A)
generated by the sets ˆP = {Q ∈Pκ(A) : P ⊂Q}. F is a κ-complete ﬁlter and
if κ is strongly compact, F can be extended to a κ-complete ultraﬁlter U.
A κ-complete ultraﬁlter U on Pκ(A) that extends F is called a ﬁne measure.
In Part II we prove that if a ﬁne measure on Pκ(A) exists for every A, then
κ is strongly compact.
A ﬁne measure U on P<κ(A) is normal if whenever f : Pκ(A) →A is
such that f(P) ∈P for all P in a set in U, then f is constant on a set
in U. Equivalently, U is normal if it is closed under diagonal intersections
△a∈A Xa = {x ∈Pκ(A) : x ∈
a∈x Xa}.
Deﬁnition 10.24. An uncountable cardinal κ is supercompact if for every A
such that |A| ≥κ there exists a normal measure on Pκ(A).

Historical Notes
The study of measurable cardinals originated around 1930 with the work of Banach,
Kuratowski, Tarski, and Ulam. Ulam showed in [1930] that measurable cardinals are
large, that the least measurable cardinal is at least as large as the least inaccessible
cardinal.
The main result on measurable and real-valued measurable cardinals (Theo-
rem 10.1) is due to Ulam [1930]. The fact that a measurable cardinal is inaccessible
(Lemma 10.4) was discovered by Ulam and Tarski (cf. Ulam [1930]). Prior to Ulam,

138
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Banach and Kuratowski proved in [1929] that if 2ℵ0 = ℵ1, then there is no mea-
sure on the continuum; their proof is as in Lemma 10.16. Real-valued measurable
cardinals were introduced by Banach in [1930].
Lemma 10.18: Erd˝os and Tarski [1943]. Hanf [1963/64a] proved that the least
inaccessible cardinal is not measurable. That every measurable cardinal is a Ram-
sey cardinal was proved by Erd˝os and Hajnal [1962]; the stronger version (Theo-
rem 10.22) is due to Rowbottom [1971].
Strongly compact cardinals were introduced by Keisler and Tarski in [1963/64];
supercompact cardinals were deﬁned by Reinhardt and Solovay, cf. Solovay et
al. [1978].
Exercise 10.1: Vitali [1905].

11. Borel and Analytic Sets
Descriptive set theory deals with sets of reals that are described in some
simple way: sets that have a simple topological structure (e.g., continuous
images of closed sets) or are deﬁnable in a simple way. The main theme is
that questions that are diﬃcult to answer if asked for arbitrary sets of reals,
become much easier when asked for sets that have a simple description. An
example of that is the Cantor-Bendixson Theorem (Theorem 4.6): Every
closed set of reals is either at most countable or has size 2ℵ0.
Since properties of deﬁnable sets can usually be established eﬀectively,
without use of the Axiom of Choice, we shall work in set theory ZF without
the Axiom of Choice. When some statement depends on the Axiom of Choice,
we shall explicitly say so. However, we shall assume a weak form of the Axiom
of Choice. The reason is that in descriptive set theory one frequently considers
unions and intersections of countably many sets of reals, and we shall often
use facts like “the union of countably many countable sets is countable.” Thus
we shall work, throughout this chapter, in set theory ZF + the Countable
Axiom of Choice.
In this chapter we develop the basic theory of Borel and analytic sets in
Polish spaces. A Polish space is a topological space that is homeomorphic to
a complete separable metric space (Deﬁnition 4.12).
A canonical example of a Polish space is the Baire space N. The following
lemma shows that every Polish space is a continuous image of N:
Lemma 11.1. Let X be a Polish space. Then there exists a continuous map-
ping from N onto X.
Proof. Let X be a complete separable metric space; we construct a mapping f
of N onto X as follows: It is easy to construct, by induction on the length of
s ∈Seq, a collection {Cs : s ∈Seq} of closed balls such that C∅= X and
(i) diameter(Cs) ≤1/n where n = length(s),
(ii) Cs ⊂∞
k=0 Cs⌢k (all s ∈Seq),
(iii) if s ⊂t then center(Ct) ∈Cs.
(11.1)
For each a ∈N, let f(a) be the unique point in {Cs : s ⊂a}; it is easily
checked that f is continuous and that X = f(N).

Borel Sets
Let X be a Polish space. A set A ⊂X is a Borel set if it belongs to the
smallest σ-algebra of subsets of X containing all closed sets. We shall now
give a more explicit description of Borel sets. For each α < ω1, let us deﬁne
the collections Σ0
α and Π0
α of subsets of X:
(11.2)
Σ0
1 = the collection of all open sets;
Π0
1 = the collection of all closed sets;
Σ0
α = the collection of all sets A = ∞
n=0 An, where each An
belongs to Π0
β for some β < α;
Π0
α = the collection of all complements of sets in Σ0
α
= the collection of all sets A = ∞
n=0 An, where each An
belongs to Σ0
β for some β < α.
It is clear (by induction on α) that the elements of each Σ0
α and each Π0
α are
Borel sets. Since every open set is the union of countably many closed sets,
we have Σ0
1 ⊂Σ0
2, and consequently, if α < β, then
Σ0
α ⊂Σ0
β,
Σ0
α ⊂Π0
β,
Π0
α ⊂Π0
β,
Π0
α ⊂Σ0
β.
Hence
(11.3)

α<ω1
Σ0
α =

α<ω1
Π0
α
and it is easy to verify that the collection (11.3) is a σ-algebra (here we
use the Countable Axiom of Choice). Hence every Borel set is in some Σ0
α,
α < ω1.
Note that each Σ0
α (and each Π0
α) is closed under ﬁnite unions, ﬁnite
intersections, and inverse images by continuous functions (i.e., if A ∈Σ0
α
in Y , then f−1(A) ∈Σ0
α in X whenever f : X →Y is a continuous function).
If the Polish space X is countable, then of course every A ∈X is a Borel
set, in fact an Fσ set. Uncountable Polish spaces are more interesting: Not
all sets are Borel, and the collections Σ0
α form a hierarchy. We show below
that for each α, Σ0
α ̸⊂Π0
α, and hence Σ0
α ̸= Σ0
α+1 for all α < ω1.
While we prove the next lemma for the special case when X is the Baire
space, the proof can be modiﬁed to prove the same result for any uncountable
Polish space.
Lemma 11.2. For each α ≥1 there exists a set U ⊂N 2 such that U is Σ0
α
(in N 2), and that for every Σ0
α set A in N there exists some a ∈N such
that
(11.4)
A = {x : (x, a) ∈U}.

11. Borel and Analytic Sets
141
U is a universal Σ0
α set.
Proof. By induction on α. To construct a universal open set in N 2, let G1, . . . ,
Gk, . . . be an enumeration of all basic open sets in N, and let G0 = ∅. Let
(11.5)
(x, y) ∈U if and only if x ∈Gy(n) for some n.
Since U = ∞
n=0 Hn where each Hn = {(x, y) : x ∈Gy(n)} is an open set
in N 2, we see that U is open. Now if G is an open set in N, we let a ∈N be
such that G = ∞
n=0 Ga(n); then G = {x : (x, a) ∈U}.
Next let U be a universal Σ0
α set, and let us construct a universal
Σ0
α+1 set V . Let us consider some continuous mapping of N onto the product
space N ω; for each a ∈N and each n, let a(n) be the nth coordinate of the
image of a. [For instance, let us deﬁne a(n) as follows: a(n)(k) = a(Γ(n, k)),
where Γ is the canonical one-to-one pairing function Γ : N × N →N.] Now
let
(11.6)
(x, y) ∈V if and only if for some n, (x, y(n)) /∈U.
Since V = ∞
n=0 Hn where each Hn = {(x, y) : (x, y(n)) /∈U} is a Π0
α set,
we see that V is Σ0
α+1. If A is a Σ0
α+1 set in N, then A = ∞
n=0 An where
each An is Π0
α. For each n, let an be such that N −An = {x : (x, an) ∈U},
and let a be such that a(n) = an for all n. Then A = {x : (x, a) ∈V }.
Finally, let α be a limit ordinal, and let Uβ, 1 ≤β ≤α, be universal
Σ0
β sets. Let 1 ≤α0 < α1 < . . . < αn < . . . be an increasing sequence of
ordinals such that limn→∞αn = α. Let
(11.7)
(x, y) ∈U if and only if for some n, (x, y(n)) /∈Uαn
(where a(n) has the same meaning as above). The set U is Σ0
α. If A is a Σ0
α set
in N then A = ∞
n=0 An where each An is Π0
αn. For each n, let an be such
that N −An = {x : (x, an) ∈Uαn}, and let a be such that a(n) = an for
all n. Then A = {x : (x, a) ∈U}.
⊓⊔
Corollary 11.3. For every α ≥1, there is a set A ⊂N that is Σ0
α but
not Π0
α.
Proof. Let U ⊂N 2 be a universal Σ0
α set. Let us consider the set
(11.8)
A = {x : (x, x) ∈U}.
Clearly, A is a Σ0
α set. If A were Π0
α, then its complement would be Σ0
α and
there would be some a such that
A = {x : (x, a) /∈U}.
But this contradicts (11.8): Simply let x = a.
⊓⊔

Analytic Sets
While the collection of Borel sets of reals is closed under Boolean operations,
and countable unions and intersections, it is not closed under continuous
images: As we shall learn presently, the image of a Borel set by a continuous
function need not be a Borel set. We shall now investigate the continuous
images of Borel sets.
Deﬁnition 11.4. A subset of A of a Polish space X is analytic if there exists
a continuous function f : N →X such that A = f(N).
Deﬁnition 11.5. The projection of a set S ⊂X × Y (into X) is the set
P = {x ∈X : ∃y (x, y) ∈S}.
The following lemma gives equivalent deﬁnitions of analytic sets.
Lemma 11.6. The following are equivalent, for any set A in a Polish
space X:
(i) A is the continuous image of N.
(ii) A is the continuous image of a Borel set B (in some Polish space Y ).
(iii) A is the projection of a Borel set in X × Y , for some Polish space Y .
(iv) A is the projection of a closed set in X × N.
Proof. We shall prove that every closed set (in any Polish space) is analytic
and that every Borel set is the projection of a closed set in X × N. Then
the lemma follows: Since the projection map π : X × Y →X deﬁned by
π(x, y) = x is continuous, it follows that every Borel set is analytic and that
the continuous image of a Borel set is analytic. Conversely, if A ⊂X is an
analytic set, A = f(N), then A is the projection of the set {(f(x), x) : x ∈N}
which is a closed set in X × N.
In order to prove that every closed set is analytic, note that every closed
set in a Polish space is itself a Polish space, and thus a continuous image
of N by Lemma 11.1.
In order to prove that every Borel set in X is the projection of a closed
set in X × N, it suﬃces to show that the family P of all subsets of X that
are such projections contains all closed sets, all open sets, and is closed under
countable unions and intersections.
Clearly, the family P contains all closed sets. Moreover, every open set
is a countable union of closed sets; thus it suﬃces to show that P is closed
under ∞
n=0 and ∞
n=0.
Recall the continuous mapping a →⟨a(n) : n ∈N⟩of N onto N ω from
Lemma 11.2, and also recall that the inverse image of a closed set under
a continuous function is closed. Let An, n < ω, be projections of closed sets
in X ×N; we shall show that ∞
n=0 An and ∞
n=0 An are projections of closed
sets.

11. Borel and Analytic Sets

For each n, let Fn ⊂X × N be a closed set such that
An = {x : ∃a (x, a) ∈Fa}.
Thus
x ∈

Hence ∞
n=0 An is the projection of the closed set
{(x, c) : (x, c(0)) ∈Fc(1)(0)}
and ∞
n=0 An is the projection of an intersection of closed sets.
⊓⊔
The Suslin Operation A
For each a ∈ωω, a↾n is the ﬁnite sequence ⟨ak : k < n⟩. For each s ∈Seq,
O(s) is the basic open set {a ∈N : a↾n = s} of the Baire space. O(s) is both
open and closed. For every set A in a Polish space, A denotes the closure
of A.
Let {As : s ∈Seq} be a collection of sets indexed by elements of Seq. We
deﬁne
(11.9)
A{As : s ∈Seq} =

a∈ωω

n=0
Aa↾n
Note that if {Bs : s ∈Seq} is arbitrary, then

Ba↾n =

n=0
(Ba↾0 ∩Ba↾1 ∩. . . ∩Ba↾n)
and hence A{Bs : s ∈Seq} = A{As : s ∈Seq} where the sets As are ﬁnite
intersections of the sets Bs and satisfy the following condition:
(11.10)
if s ⊂t, then As ⊃At.
Thus we shall restrict our use of A to families that satisfy condi-
tion (11.10). The operation A is called the Suslin operation.

144
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Lemma 11.7. A set A in a Polish space is analytic if and only if A is the
result of the operation A applied to a family of closed sets.
Proof. First we show that if Fs, s ∈Seq, are closed sets in a Polish space X,
then A = A{Fs : s ∈Seq} is analytic. We have
x ∈A ↔∃a ∈N x ∈

n=0
Fa↾n

Bn
where Bn = {(x, a) : x ∈Fa↾n}. Clearly, each Bn is a Borel set in X ×N and
hence A is analytic.
Conversely, let A ⊂X be analytic. There is a continuous function f :
N →X such that A = f(N). Notice that for every a ∈N,
(11.11)
∞

n=0
f(O(a↾n)) =

f(O(a↾n)) = {f(a)}.
Thus
A = f(N) =


n=0
f(O(a↾n)),
and hence A is the result of the operation A applied to the closed sets f(O(s))
(which satisfy the condition (11.10)).
⊓⊔
It follows from the preceding lemmas that the collection of all analytic
sets in a Polish space is closed under countable unions and intersections,
continuous images, and inverse images, and the Suslin operation (the last
statement is proved like the ﬁrst part of Lemma 11.7). It is however not the
case that the complement of an analytic set is analytic (if X is an uncountable
Polish space). In the next section we establish exactly that; we show that
there exists an analytic set (in N) whose complement is not analytic.
The Hierarchy of Projective Sets
For each n ≥1, we deﬁne the collections Σ1
n, Π1
n, and ∆1
n of subsets of
a Polish space X as follows:
(11.12)
Σ1
1 = the collection of all analytic sets,
Π1
1 = the complements of analytic sets,
Σ1
n+1 = the collection of the projections of all Π1
n sets in X × N,
Π1
n = the complements of the Σ1
n sets in X,
∆1
n = Σ1
n ∩Π1
n.

11. Borel and Analytic Sets
145
The sets belonging to one of the collections Σ1
n or Π1
n are called projective
sets. It is easily seen that for every n, ∆1
n ⊂Σ1
n ⊂∆1
n+1 and ∆1
n ⊂Π1
n ⊂
∆1
n+1.
We shall show that for each n there is a Σ1
n set in N that is not Π1
n; thus
the above inclusions are proper inclusions.
Lemma 11.8. For each n ≥1, there exists a universal Σ1
n set in N 2; i.e.,
a set U ⊂N 2 such that U is Σ1
n and that for every Σ1
n set A in N there
exists some v ∈N such that
A = {x : (x, v) ∈U}.
Proof. Let h be a homeomorphism of N × N onto N. If n = 1, let V be
a universal Σ0
1 set; if n > 1, let V be, by the induction hypothesis, a universal
Σ1
n−1 set. Let
(11.13)
(x, y) ∈U
if and only if
∃a ∈N (h(x, a), y) /∈V.
Since the set {(x, y, a) : (h(x, a), y) /∈V } is closed (if n = 1) or Π1
n−1 (if
n > 1), U is Σ1
n.
If A ⊂N is Σ1
n, there is a closed (or Π1
n−1) set B such that
(11.14)
x ∈A
if and only if
∃a ∈N (x, a) ∈B.
The set C = N −h(B) is open (or Σ1
n−1) in N and since V is universal,
there exists a v such that C = {u : (u, v) ∈V }. Then by (11.13), we have
x ∈A ↔(∃a ∈N) (x, a) ∈B ↔(∃a ∈N) h(x, a) /∈C
↔(∃a ∈N) (h(x, a), v) /∈V ↔(x, v) ∈U.
Hence U is a universal Σ1
n set.
⊓⊔
Corollary 11.9. For each n ≥1, there is a set A ⊂N that is Σ1
n but
not Π1
n.
Proof. Let U ⊂N 2 be a universal Σ1
n set and let
A = {x : (x, x) ∈U}
⊓⊔
The collection of all ∆1
1 sets in a Polish space is a σ-algebra and contains
all Borel sets. It turns out that ∆1
1 is exactly the collection of all Borel sets.
Theorem 11.10 (Suslin). Every analytic set whose complement is also an-
alytic is a Borel set. Thus ∆1
1 is the collection of all Borel sets.
Let X be a Polish space and let A and B be two disjoint analytic sets
in X. We say that A and B are separated by a Borel set if there exists a Borel
set D such that A ⊂D and B ⊂X −D.

146
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Lemma 11.11. Any two disjoint analytic sets are separated by a Borel set.
This lemma is often called “the Σ1
1-Separation Principle.” It clearly im-
plies Suslin’s Theorem since if A is an analytic set such that B = X −A is
also analytic, A and B are separated by a Borel set D and we clearly have
D = A.
Proof. First we make the following observation: If A = ∞
n=0 An and B =
∞
m=0 Bm are such that for all n and m, An and Bm are separated, then A
and B are separated. This is proved as follows: For each n and each m, let
Dn,m be a Borel set such that An ⊂Dn,m ⊂X −Bm. Then A and B are
separated by the Borel set D = ∞
n=0
∞
m=0 Dn,m.
Let A and B be two disjoint analytic sets in X. Let f and g be continuous
functions such that A = f(N) and B = g(N). For each s ∈Seq, let As =
f(O(s)) and Bs = g(O(s)); the sets As and Bs are all analytic sets. For each s
we have As = ∞
n=0 As⌢n and Bs = ∞
m=0 Bs⌢m. If a ∈ωω, then
{f(a)} =
∞

n=0
f(O(a↾n)) =
∞

n=0
Aa↾n,
and similarly for the sets Bs.
Let a, b ∈ωω be arbitrary. Since f(N) and g(N) are disjoint, we have
f(a) ̸= g(b). Let Ga and Gb be two disjoint open neighbourhoods of f(a)
and g(b), respectively. By the continuity of f and g there exists some n such
that Aa↾n ⊂Ga and Bb↾n ⊂Gb. It follows that the sets Aa↾n and Bb↾n are
separated by a Borel set.
We shall now show, by contradiction, that the sets A and B are separated
by a Borel set. If A and B are not separated, then because A = ∞
n=0 A⟨n⟩and
B = ∞
m=0 B⟨m⟩, there exist n0 and m0 such that the sets A⟨n0⟩and B⟨m0⟩
are not separated. Then similarly there exist n1 and m1 such that the sets
A⟨n0,n1⟩and B⟨m0,m1⟩are not separated, and so on. In other words, there
exist a = ⟨n0, n1, n2, . . .⟩and b = ⟨m0, m1, m2, . . .⟩such that for every k,
the sets A⟨n0,...,nk⟩and B⟨m0,...,mk⟩are not separated. This is a contradiction
since in the preceding paragraph we proved exactly the opposite: There is k
such that Aa↾k and Bb↾k are separated.
⊓⊔
Lebesgue Measure
We shall now review basic properties of Lebesgue measure on the n-dimen-
sional Euclidean space.
The standard way of deﬁning Lebesgue measure is to deﬁne ﬁrst the
outer measure µ∗(X) of a set X ⊂Rn as the inﬁmum of all possible sums
{v(Ik) : k ∈N} where {Ik : k ∈N} is a collection of n-dimensional
intervals such that X ⊂∞
k=0 Ik, and v(I) denotes the volume of I. For
each X, µ∗(X) ≥0 and possibly = ∞. A set X is null if µ∗(X) = 0.

11. Borel and Analytic Sets
147
A set A ⊂Rn is Lebesgue measurable if for each X ⊂Rn,
µ∗(X) = µ∗(X ∩A) + µ∗(X −A).
For a measurable set A, we write µ(A) instead of µ∗(A) and call µ(A) the
Lebesgue measure of A.
The standard development of the theory of Lebesgue measure gives the
following facts:
(i) Every interval is Lebesgue measurable, and its measure is equal
to its volume.
(ii) The Lebesgue measurable sets form a σ-algebra; hence every
Borel set is measurable.
(iii) µ is σ-additive: If An, n < ω, are pairwise disjoint and mea-
surable, then
µ
 ∞

n=0
An

=
∞

n=0
µ(An).
(iv) µ is σ-ﬁnite: If A is measurable, then there exist measurable
sets An, n < ω, such that A = ∞
n=0 An, and µ(An) < ∞for
each n.
(v) Every null set is measurable. The null sets form a σ-ideal and
contain all singletons.
(vi) If A is measurable, then
µ(A) = sup{µ(K) : K ⊂A is compact}.
(vii) If A is measurable, then there is an Fσ set F and a Gδ set G
such that F ⊂A ⊂G and G −F is null.
(11.15)
This last property gives this characterization of Lebesgue measurable sets:
A set A ⊂Rn is measurable if and only if there is a Borel set B such that
the symmetric diﬀerence A △B = (A −B) ∪(B −A) is null.
One consequence of this is that if we denote by B the σ-algebra of Borel
sets and by M the σ-algebra of measurable sets, and if Iµ is the ideal of all
null sets, then B/Iµ = M/Iµ. The Boolean algebra B/Iµ is σ-complete; and
since a familiar argument shows that Iµ is (as an ideal in M) σ-saturated,
we conclude that B/Iµ is a complete Boolean algebra. We shall return to this
in Part II.
Assuming the Axiom of Choice one can show that there exists a set of reals
that is not Lebesgue measurable. One such example is the Vitali set in Exer-
cise 10.1. As another example there exists a set X ⊂Rn such that neither X
nor its complement has a perfect subset (see Exercise 5.1 for a construc-
tion of such a set). The set X is not measurable: Otherwise, e.g., µ(X) > 0
and by (11.15)(vi) there is a closed K ⊂X such that µ(K) > 0; thus K is
uncountable and hence contains a perfect subset, a contradiction.
However, we shall show in Part II that it is consistent (with ZF + DC)
that all sets or reals are Lebesgue measurable.

148
Part I. Basic Set Theory
We conclude this review of Lebesgue measurability with two lemmas.
One is the well-known Fubini Theorem, and we state it here, without proof,
for the sake of completeness. The other lemma will be used in the proof of
Theorem 11.18 below.
If A is a subset of the plane R2 and x ∈R, let Ax denote the set {y :
(x, y) ∈A}.
Lemma 11.12. Let A ⊂R2 be a measurable set. Then A is null if and only
if for almost all x, Ax is null (i.e., the set {x : Ax is not null} is null).
⊓⊔
Lemma 11.13. For any set X ⊂Rn there exists a measurable set A ⊃X
with the property that whenever Z ⊂A −X is measurable, then Z is null.
Proof. If µ∗(X) < ∞, then because µ∗(X) = inf{µ(A) : A is measurable
and A ⊃X}, there is a measurable A ⊃X such that µ(A) = µ∗(X); clearly
such an A will do. If µ∗(X) = ∞, there exist pairwise disjoint Xn such that
X = ∞
n=0 Xn and that for each n, µ∗(Xn) < ∞. Let An ⊃Xn, n < ω, be
measurable sets such that µ(An) = µ∗(Xn), and let A = ∞
n=0 An.
⊓⊔
It should be mentioned that the main results of descriptive set theory on
Lebesgue measure can be proved in a more general context, namely for rea-
sonable σ-additive measures on Polish spaces. An example of such a measure
is the product measure in the Cantor space {0, 1}ω.
The Property of Baire
In Chapter 4 we proved the Baire Category Theorem (Theorem 4.8): The
intersection of countably many dense open sets of reals is nonempty. It is
fairly easy to see that the proof works not only for the real line R but for
any Polish space.
Let us consider a Polish space X. Let us call a set A ⊂X nowhere dense
if the complement of A contains a dense open set. Note that A is nowhere
dense just in case for every nonempty open set G, there is a nonempty open
set H ⊂G such that A ∩H = ∅. A set A is nowhere dense if and only if its
closure A is nowhere dense.
A set A ⊂X is meager (or of ﬁrst category) if A is the union of countably
many nowhere dense sets. A nonmeager set is called a set of second category.
The Baire Category Theorem states in eﬀect that in a Polish space every
nonempty open set is of second category.
The meager sets form a σ-ideal. Moreover, in case of Rn, N, or the Cantor
space, every singleton {x} is nowhere dense and so the ideal of meager sets
contains all countable sets.
Deﬁnition 11.14. A set A has the Baire property if there exists an open
set G such that A △G is meager.

11. Borel and Analytic Sets
149
Clearly, every meager set has the Baire property. Note that if G is open,
then G −G is nowhere dense. Hence if A △G is meager then (X −A) △
(X −G) = A△G is meager, and it follows that the complement of a set with
the Baire property also has the Baire property. It is also easy to see that the
union of countably many sets with the Baire property has the Baire property
and we have:
Lemma 11.15. The sets having the Baire property form a σ-algebra; hence
every Borel set has the Baire property.
⊓⊔
If B denotes the σ-algebra of Borel sets, and if we denote by C the σ-
algebra of sets with the Baire property, and if I is the σ-ideal of meager
sets, we have B/I = C/I. Note that the algebra B/I is σ-saturated: Let O
be a countable topology base for X. For each nonmeager set X with the
Baire property there exists G ∈O such that G −X is meager. Thus the set
D = {[G] : G ∈O} of equivalence classes is a dense set in B/I. Hence B/I is
σ-saturated and is a complete Boolean algebra.
The Axiom of Choice implies that sets without the Baire property exist.
For instance, the Vitali set (Exercise 10.1) is such, see Exercise 11.7.
If X ⊂Rn is such that neither X nor its complement has a perfect
subset, then X does not have the Baire property: Otherwise, e.g., X is of
second category and hence X contains a Gδ subset G of second category.
Now G is uncountable, and this is a contradiction since as we shall prove
in Theorem 11.18, every uncountable Borel set (even analytic) has a perfect
subset.
The following two lemmas are analogs of Lemmas 11.12 and 11.13. The
ﬁrst one, although not very diﬃcult to prove, is again stated without proof.
Lemma 11.16. Let A ⊂R2 have the property of Baire. Then A is meager
if and only if Ax is meager for all x except a meager set.
⊓⊔
Lemma 11.17. For any set S in a Polish space X, there exists a set A ⊃S
that has the Baire property and such that whenever Z ⊂A −S has the Baire
property, then Z is meager.
Proof. Let us consider a ﬁxed countable topology basis O for X. Let S ⊂X.
Let
D(S) = {x ∈X : for every U ∈O such that x ∈U, U ∩S is not meager}.
Note that the complement of D(S) is the union of open sets and hence open;
thus D(S) is closed.
The set S −D(S) is the union of all S ∩U where U ∈O and S ∩U is
meager; since O is countable, X −D(S) is meager. Let
A = S ∪D(S).
Since A = (S −D(S))∪D(S) is the union of a meager and a closed set, A has
the Baire property.

150
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Let Z ⊂A −S have the Baire property; we shall show that Z is meager.
Otherwise there is U ∈O such that U −Z is meager; hence U ∩S is meager.
Since U ∩Z ̸= ∅and Z ⊂D(S), there is x ∈U such that x ∈D(S), and
hence U ∩S is not meager, a contradiction.
⊓⊔
Although both “null” and “meager” mean in a sense “negligible,” see
Exercise 11.8 that shows that the real line can be decomposed into a null set
and a meager set.
Analytic Sets: Measure, Category, and the Perfect Set
Property
Theorem 11.18.
(i) Every analytic set of reals is Lebesgue measurable.
(ii) Every analytic set has the Baire property.
(iii) Every uncountable analytic set contains a perfect subset.
Corollary 11.19. Every Π1
1 set of reals is Lebesgue measurable and has the
Baire property.
⊓⊔
Corollary 11.20. Every analytic (and in particular every Borel) set is ei-
ther at most countable or has cardinality c.
⊓⊔
We prove (ii) and (iii) for an arbitrary Polish space. The proof of (i) is
general enough to work for other measures (in Polish spaces) as well.
Proof. The proof of (i) and (ii) is exactly the same and uses either Lem-
ma 11.13 or Lemma 11.17 (and basic facts on Lebesgue measure and the
Baire property). We give the proof of (i) and leave (ii) to the reader.
Let A be an analytic set of reals (or a subset of Rn). Let f : N →R
be a continuous function such that A = f(N). For each s ∈Seq, let As =
f(O(s)). We have
(11.16)
A = A{As : s ∈Seq} = A{As : s ∈Seq},
and for every s ∈Seq,
(11.17)
As =


n=0
As⌢n.
By Lemma 11.13, there exists for each s ∈Seq a measurable set Bs ⊃As
such that every measurable Z ⊂Bs −As is null. Since As is measurable, we
may actually ﬁnd Bs such that As ⊂Bs ⊂As.

11. Borel and Analytic Sets

Let B = B∅. Since B is measurable, it suﬃces to show that B−A is a null
set. Notice that because As ⊂Bs ⊂As, and because (11.16) holds, we have
A = A{Bs : s ∈Seq}.
Thus
B −A = B −

To prove (11.18), assume that x ∈B is such that x is not a member of the
right-hand side. Then for every s, if x ∈Bs, then x ∈Bs⌢k for some k. Hence
there is k0 such that x ∈B⟨k0⟩, then there is k1 such that x ∈B⟨k0,k1⟩, etc.
Let a = ⟨k0, k1, k2, . . .⟩; we have x ∈∞
n=0 Ba↾n and hence x is not a member
of the left-hand side.
Thus we have
B −A ⊂

Bs −

Since Seq is a countable set, it suﬃces to show that each Bs −∞

k=0 Bs⌢k. We have
Z = Bs −

Now because Z ⊂Bs −As and because Z is measurable, Z must be null.
(iii) The proof is a variant of the Cantor-Bendixson argument for closed
sets in the Baire space. Recall that every closed set F in N is of the form
F = [T ] = {a : ∀n a↾n ∈T }, where T is a tree, T ⊂Seq. For each tree
T ⊂Seq and each s ∈Seq, let Ts denote the tree {t ∈T : t ⊂s or s ⊂t};
note that [Ts] = [T ] ∩O(s).
Let A be an analytic set (in a Polish space X), and let f be a continuous
function such that A = f(N). For each tree T ⊂Seq, we deﬁne
T ′ = {s ∈T : f([Ts]) is uncountable}.
For each α < ω1, we deﬁne T (α) as follows:
T (0) = Seq,
T (α+1) = (T (α))′,
T (α) = 
β<α
T (β)
if α is a limit ordinal.
Let α < ω1 be the least ordinal such that T (α+1) = T (α). If T (α) = ∅, then
A = 
β<α
{f([T (β)
s
]) : s ∈T (β) −T (β+1)},

152
Part I. Basic Set Theory
and hence A is countable. Thus if A is uncountable, T (α) is nonempty and for
every s ∈T (α), f([T (α)
s
]) is uncountable. In this case, we shall ﬁnd a perfect
subset of A.
Let s ∈T (α) be arbitrary. Since f([T (α)
s
]) has at least two elements,
there exist s⟨0⟩⊃s and s⟨1⟩⊃s (in T (α)) such that f([T (α)
s⟨0⟩]) and f([T (α)
s⟨1⟩])
are disjoint. Then there are s⟨0,0⟩⊃s⟨0⟩and s⟨0,1⟩⊃s⟨0⟩, and s⟨1,0⟩⊃s⟨1⟩,
s⟨1,1⟩⊃s⟨1⟩such that the four sets f([T (α)
s⟨i,j⟩]), i, j = 0, 1 are pairwise disjoint.
In this fashion we construct st ∈T (α) for each ﬁnite 0–1 sequence t. These
elements st generate a subtree U = {s : s ⊂st for some t} of T (α) such
that (1) U is perfect, (2) every s has at most two immediate successors in U
(hence [U] is a compact set in N), and (3) f is one-to-one on [U].
Let P be the image of [U] under the function f. Since [U] is compact and
f is continuous, P is also compact, and hence closed. Moreover, P has no
isolated points because [U] is perfect and f is continuous. Thus P is a perfect
subset of A.

Historical Notes
Borel sets were introduced by Borel in [1905]. Lebesgue in [1905] proved in eﬀect
Lemma 11.2. Suslin’s discovery of an error in a proof in Lebesgue’s article led to
a construction of an analytic non-Borel set and introduction of the operation A.
The basic results on analytic sets as well as Theorem 11.10 appeared in Suslin’s
article [1917].
Projective sets were introduced by Luzin [1925] and [1927a], and Sierpi´nski
[1925] and [1927]. The present notation (Σ and Π) appeared ﬁrst in the paper
[1959] of Addison who noticed the analogy between Luzin’s hierarchy of projective
sets and Kleene’s hierarchy of analytic predicates [1955].
Lemma 11.8: Luzin [1930].
Lemma 11.11: Luzin [1927b].
For detailed treatment of Lebesgue measure, we refer the reader to Halmos’
book [1950]; Lebesgue introduced his measure and integral in his thesis [1902]. Sets
of ﬁrst and second category were introduced by Baire [1899].
Lemmas 11.13 and 11.17: Marczewski [1930a].
Lemma 11.16: Kuratowski and Ulam [1932].
Theorem 11.18(i) (measurability of analytic sets) is due to Luzin [1917]. The-
orem 11.18(ii) (Baire property) is due to Luzin and Sierpi´nski [1923] and Theo-
rem 11.18(iii) (perfect subsets) is due to Suslin; cf. Luzin [1930]. The present proof
of (i) and (ii) follows Marczewski [1930a]. Prior to Suslin (and following the Cantor-
Bendixson Theorem for closed sets) Young proved in [1906] the perfect subset result
for Gδ and Fσ sets; and Hausdorﬀ[1916] and Aleksandrov [1916] proved the same
for Borel sets.

12. Models of Set Theory
Modern set theory uses extensively construction of models to establish rela-
tive consistency of various axioms and conjectures. As the techniques often
involve standard model-theoretic concepts, we assume familiarity with basic
notions of models and satisfaction, submodels and embeddings, as well as
Skolem functions, direct limit and ultraproducts. We shall review the basic
notions, notation and terminology of model theory.
Review of Model Theory
A language is a set of symbols: relation symbols, function symbols, and con-
stant symbols:
L = {P, . . . , F, . . . , c, . . .}.
Each P is assumed to be an n-placed relation for some integer n ≥1; each F
is an m-placed function symbol for some m ≥1.
Terms and formulas of a language L are certain ﬁnite sequences of sym-
bols of L, and of logical symbols (identity symbol, parentheses, variables,
connectives, and quantiﬁers). The set of all terms and the set of all formulas
are deﬁned by recursion. If the language is countable (i.e., if |L| ≤ℵ0), then
we may identify the symbols of L, as well as the logical symbols, with some
hereditarily ﬁnite sets (elements of Vω); then formulas are also hereditarily
ﬁnite.
A model for a given language L is a pair A = (A, I), where A is the
universe of A and I is the interpretation function which maps the symbols
of L to appropriate relations, functions, and constants in A. A model for L
is usually written in displayed form as
A = (A, P A, . . . , F A, . . . , cA, . . .)
By recursion on length of terms and formulas one deﬁnes the value of a term
tA[a1, . . . , an]
and satisfaction
A ⊨ϕ[a1, . . . , an]
where t is a term, ϕ is a formula, and ⟨a1, . . . , an⟩is a ﬁnite sequence in A.

156
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Two models A = (A, P, . . . , F, . . . , c, . . .) and A′ = (A′, P ′, . . . , F ′, . . . ,
c′, . . .) are isomorphic if there is an isomorphism between A and A′, that is
a one-to-one function f of A onto A′ such that
(i) P(x1, . . . , xn) if and only if P ′(f(x1), . . . , f(xn)),
(ii) f(F(x1, . . . , xn)) = F ′(f(x1), . . . , f(xn)),
(iii) f(c) = c′,
for all relations, functions, and constants of A. If f is an isomorphism, then
f(tA[a1, . . . , an]) = tA′[f(a1), . . . , f(an)] for each term, and
A ⊨ϕ[a1, . . . , an]
if and only if
A′ ⊨ϕ[f(a1), . . . , f(an)]
for each formula ϕ and all a1, . . . , an ∈A.
A submodel of A is a subset B ⊂A endowed with the relations P A ∩Bn,
. . . , functions F A↾Bm, . . . , and constants cA, . . . ; all cA belong to B, and
B is closed under all F A (if (x1, . . . , xm) ∈Bm, then F A(x1, . . . , xm) ∈B).
An embedding of B into A is an isomorphism between B and a submodel
B′ ⊂A.
A submodel B ⊂A is an elementary submodel
B ≺A
if for every formula ϕ, and every a1, . . . , an ∈B,
(12.1)
B ⊨ϕ[a1, . . . , an]
if and only if
A ⊨ϕ[a1, . . . , an].
Two models A, B are elementarily equivalent if they satisfy the same
sentences.
The key lemma in construction of elementary submodels is this: A subset
B ⊂A forms an elementary submodel of A if and only if for every formula
ϕ(u, x1, . . . , xn), and every a1, . . . , an ∈B,
if ∃a ∈A such that A ⊨ϕ[a, a1, . . . , an], then ∃a ∈B such that
A ⊨ϕ[a, a1, . . . , an].
(12.2)
A function h : An →A is a Skolem function for ϕ if
(∃a ∈A) A ⊨ϕ[a, a1, . . . , an]
implies
A ⊨ϕ[h(a1, . . . , an), a1, . . . , an]
for every a1, . . . , an. Using the Axiom of Choice, one can construct a Skolem
function for every ϕ. If a subset B ⊂A is closed under (some) Skolem func-
tions for all formulas, then B satisﬁes (12.2) and hence forms an elementary
submodel of A.
Given a set of Skolem functions, one for each formula of L, the closure of
a set X ⊂A is a Skolem hull of X. It is clear that the Skolem hull of X is
an elementary submodel of A, and has cardinality at most |X| · |L| · ℵ0. In
particular, we have the following:

12. Models of Set Theory
157
Theorem 12.1 (L¨owenheim-Skolem). Every inﬁnite model for a count-
able language has a countable elementary submodel.
⊓⊔
An elementary embedding is an embedding whose range is an elementary
submodel.
A set X ⊂A is deﬁnable over A if there exist a formula ϕ and some
a1, . . . , an ∈A such that
X = {x ∈A : A ⊨ϕ[x, a1, . . . , an]}.
We say that X is deﬁnable in A from a1, . . . , an. If ϕ is a formula of x only,
without parameters a1, . . . , an, then X is deﬁnable in A. An element a ∈A
is deﬁnable (from a1, . . . , an) if the set {a} is deﬁnable (from a1, . . . , an).
G¨odel’s Theorems
The cornerstone of modern logic are G¨odel’s theorems: the Completeness
Theorem and two incompleteness theorems.
A set Σ of sentences of a language L is consistent if there is no formal
proof of contradiction from Σ. The Completeness Theorem states that every
consistent set of sentences has a model.
The First Incompleteness Theorem shows that no consistent (recursive)
extension of Peano Arithmetic is complete: there exists a statement that is
undecidable in the theory. In particular, if ZFC is consistent (as we believe),
no additional axioms can prove or refute every sentence in the language of
set theory.
The Second Incompleteness Theorem proves that suﬃciently strong math-
ematical theories such as Peano Arithmetic or ZF (if consistent) cannot prove
its own consistency. G¨odel’s Second Incompleteness Theorem implies that it
is unprovable in ZF that there exists a model of ZF. This fact is signiﬁcant for
the theory of large cardinals, and we shall return to it later in this chapter.
Direct Limits of Models
An often used construction in model theory is the direct limit of a directed
system of models. A directed set is a partially ordered set (D, <) such that
for every i, j ∈D there is a k ∈D such that i ≤k and j ≤k.
First consider a system of models {Ai : i ∈D}, indexed by a directed
set D, such that for all i, j ∈D, if i < j then Ai ≺Aj. Let A = 
i∈D Ai; i.e.,
the universe of A is the union of the universes of the Ai, P A = 
i∈D P Ai, etc.
It is easily proved by induction on the complexity of formulas that Ai ≺A
for all i.
In general, we consider a directed system of models which consists of
models {Ai : i ∈D} together with elementary embeddings ei,j : Ai →Aj
such that ei,k = ej,k ◦ei,j for all i < j < k.

158
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Lemma 12.2. If {Ai, ei,j : i, j ∈D} is a directed system of models, there
exists a model A, unique up to isomorphism, and elementary embeddings ei :
Ai →A such that A = 
i∈D ei(Ai) and that ei = ej ◦ei,j for all i < j.
The model A is called the direct limit of {Ai, ei,j}i,j∈D.
Proof. Consider the set S of all pairs (i, a) such that i ∈D and a ∈Ai, and
deﬁne an equivalence relation on S by
(i, a) ≡(j, b) ↔∃k (i ≤k, j ≤k and ei,k(a) = ej,k(b)).
Let A = S/≡be the set of all equivalence classes, and let ei(a) = [(i, a)] for
all i ∈D and a ∈Ai. The rest is routine.
⊓⊔
In set theory, a frequent application of direct limits involves the case when
D is an ordinal number (and < is its well-ordering).
Reduced Products and Ultraproducts
An important method in model theory uses ﬁlters and ultraﬁlters. Let S be
a nonempty set and let {Ax : x ∈S} be a system of models (for a language L).
Let F be a ﬁlter on S. Consider the set
A = 
x∈S
Ax/=F
where =F is the equivalence relation on 
x∈x Ax deﬁned as follows:
(12.3)
f =F g
if and only if
{x ∈S : f(x) = g(x)} ∈F.
It follows easily that =F is an equivalence relation.
The model A with universe A is obtained by interpreting the language as
follows:
If P(x1, . . . , xn) is a predicate, let
P A([f1], . . . , [fn]) if and only if {x ∈S : P Ax(f1(x), . . . , fn(x))} ∈F.
(12.4)
If F(x1, . . . , xn) is a function, let
F A([f1], . . . , [fn]) = [f] where f(x) = F Ax(f1(x), . . . , fn(x)) for all
x ∈S.
(12.5)
If c is a constant, let
cA = [f] where f(x) = cAx for all x ∈S.
(12.6)
(Note that (12.4) and (12.5) does not depend on the choice of representatives
from the equivalence classes [f1], . . . , [fn]).

12. Models of Set Theory
159
The model A is called a reduced product of {Ax : x ∈S} (by F).
Reduced products are particularly important in the case when the ﬁlter
is an ultraﬁlter. If U is an ultraﬁlter on S then the reduced product deﬁned
in (12.3)–(12.6) is called the ultraproduct of {Ax : x ∈S} by U:
A = UltU{Ax : x ∈S}.
The importance of ultraproducts is due mainly to the following funda-
mental property.
Theorem 12.3 (Lo´s). Let U be an ultraﬁlter on S and let A be the ultra-
product of {Ax : x ∈S} by U.
(i) If ϕ is a formula, then for every f1, . . . , fn ∈
x∈S Ax,
A ⊨ϕ([f1], . . . , [fn])
if and only if
{x ∈S : Ax ⊨ϕ[f1(x), . . . , fn(x)]} ∈U.
(ii) If σ is a sentence, then
A ⊨σ
if and only if
{x ∈S : Ax ⊨σ} ∈U.
Part (ii) is a consequence of (i). Note that by the theorem, the satisfaction
of ϕ at [f1], . . . , [fn] does not depend on the choice of representatives f1,
. . . , fn for the equivalence classes [f1], . . . , [fn]. Thus we may further abuse
the notation and write
A ⊨ϕ[f1, . . . , fn].
It will also be convenient to adopt a measure-theoretic terminology. If
{x ∈S : Ax ⊨ϕ[f1(x), . . . , fn(x)]} ∈U
we say that Ax satisﬁes ϕ(f1(x), . . . , fn(x)) for almost all x, or that Ax ⊨
ϕ(f1(x), . . . , fn(x)) holds almost everywhere. In this terminology, Lo´s’s The-
orem states that ϕ(f1, . . . , fn) holds in the ultraproduct if and only if for
almost all x, ϕ(f1(x), . . . , fn(x)) holds in Ax.
Proof. We shall prove (i) by induction on the complexity of formulas. We
shall prove that (i) holds for atomic formulas, and then prove the induction
step for ¬, ∧, and ∃.
Atomic formulas. First we consider the formula u = v, and we have
(12.7)
A ⊨[f] = [g] ↔[f] = [g]
↔f =U g
↔{x : f(x) = g(x)} ∈U
↔{x : Ax ⊨f(x) = g(x)} ∈U.

160
Part I. Basic Set Theory
For a predicate P(v1, . . . , vn) we have
(12.8)
A ⊨P([f1], . . . , [fn]) ↔P A([f1], . . . , [fn])
↔{x : P Ax(f1(x), . . . , fn(x))} ∈U
↔{x : Ax ⊨P(f1(x), . . . , fn(x))} ∈U.
Both (12.7) and (12.8) remain true if variables are replaced by terms, and so
(i) holds for all atomic formulas.
Logical connectives. First we assume that (i) holds for ϕ and show that it
also holds for ¬ϕ (here we use that X ∈U if and only if S −X /∈U).
A ⊨¬ϕ[f] ↔not A ⊨ϕ[f]
↔{x : Ax ⊨ϕ[f(x)]} /∈U
↔{x : Ax ⊭ϕ[f(x)]} ∈U
↔{x : Ax ⊨¬ϕ[f(x)]} ∈U.
Similarly, if (i) is true for ϕ and ψ, we have
A ⊨ϕ ∧ψ ↔A ⊨ϕ and A ⊨ψ
↔{x : Ax ⊨ϕ} ∈U and {x : Ax ⊨ψ} ∈U
↔{x : Ax ⊨ϕ ∧ψ} ∈U
(The last equivalence uses this: X ∈U and Y ∈U if and only if X ∩Y ∈U.)
Existential quantiﬁer. We assume that (i) is true for ϕ(u, v1, . . . , vn) and
show that it remains true for the formula ∃u ϕ. Let us assume ﬁrst that
(12.9)
A ⊨∃u ϕ[f1, . . . , fn].
Then there is g ∈
x∈S Ax such that A ⊨ϕ[g, f1, . . . , fn], and therefore
(12.10)
{x : Ax ⊨ϕ[g(x), f1(x), . . . , fn(x)]} ∈U,
and it clearly follows that
(12.11)
{x : Ax ⊨∃u ϕ[u, f1(x), . . . , fn(x)]} ∈U.
Now let us assume that (12.11) holds. For each x ∈S, let ux ∈Ax be such
that Ax ⊨[ux, f1(x), . . . , fn(x)] if such ux exists, and arbitrary otherwise. If
we deﬁne g ∈
x∈S Ax by g(x) = ux, then we have (12.10), and therefore
A ⊨ϕ[g, f1, . . . , fn].
Now (12.9) follows.
⊓⊔

12. Models of Set Theory
161
Let us consider now the special case of ultraproducts, when each Ax is
the same model A. Then the ultraproduct is called an ultrapower of A; de-
noted UltU A.
Corollary 12.4. An ultrapower of a model A is elementarily equivalent to A.
Proof. By Theorem 12.3(ii) we have UltU A ⊨σ if and only if {x : A ⊨σ} is
either S or empty, according to whether A ⊨σ or not.
⊓⊔
We shall now show that a model A is elementarily embeddable in its
ultrapower. If U is an ultraﬁlter on S, we deﬁne the canonical embedding
j : A →UltU A as follows: For each a ∈A, let ca be the constant function
with value a:
(12.12)
ca(x) = a
(for every x ∈S),
and let
(12.13)
j(a) = [ca].
Corollary 12.5. The canonical embedding j : A →UltU A is an elementary
embedding.
Proof. Let a ∈A. By Lo´s’s Theorem, UltU A ⊨ϕ[j(a)] if and only if UltU A ⊨
ϕ[ca] if and only if A ⊨ϕ[a] for almost all x if and only if A ⊨ϕ[a].
⊓⊔
Models of Set Theory and Relativization
The language of set theory consists of one binary predicate symbol ∈, and
so models of set theory are given by its universe M and a binary relation E
on M that interprets ∈.
We shall also consider models of set theory that are proper classes. How-
ever, due to G¨odel’s Second Incompleteness Theorem, we have to be careful
how the generalization is formulated.
Deﬁnition 12.6. Let M be a class, E a binary relation on M and let
ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) be a formula of the language of set theory. The relativization
of ϕ to M, E is the formula
(12.14)
ϕM,E(x1, . . . , xn)
deﬁned inductively as follows:
(12.15)
(x ∈y)M,E ↔x E y
(x = y)M,E ↔x = y
(¬ϕ)M,E ↔¬ϕM,E

(∃x ϕ)M,E ↔(∃x ∈M) ϕM,E
and similarly for the other connectives and ∀.

Part I. Basic Set Theory
When E is ∈, we write ϕM instead of ϕM,∈.
When using relativization ϕM,E(x1, . . . , xn) it is implicitly assumed that
the variables x1, . . . , xn range over M. We shall often write
(M, E) ⊨ϕ(x1, . . . , xn)
instead of (12.14) and say that the model (M, E) satisﬁes ϕ. We point out
however that while this is a legitimate statement in every particular case of ϕ,
the general satisfaction relation is formally undeﬁnable in ZF.
Let Form denote the set of all formulas of the language {∈}. As with any
actual (metamathematical) natural number we can associate the correspond-
ing element of N, we can similarly associate with any given formula of set
theory the corresponding element of the set Form. To make the distinction,
if ϕ is a formula, let ⌜ϕ⌝denote the corresponding element of Form.
If M is a set and E is a binary relation on M and if a1, . . . , an are
elements of M, then
(12.16)
ϕM,E(a1, . . . , an) ↔(M, E) ⊨⌜ϕ⌝[a1, . . . , an]
as can easily be veriﬁed. Thus in the case when M is a set and ϕ a particular
(metamathematical) formula, we shall not make a distinction between the
two meanings of the symbol ⊨. We note however that the left-hand side
of (12.16) (relativization) is not deﬁned for ϕ ∈Form, and the right-hand
side (satisfaction) is not deﬁned if M is a proper class.
Below we sketch a proof of a theorem of Tarski, closely related to G¨odel’s
Second Incompleteness Theorem. The theorem states that there is no set-
theoretical property T (x) such that if σ is a sentence that T (⌜σ⌝) holds if and
only if σ holds.
Let us arithmetize the syntax and consider some ﬁxed eﬀective enumera-
tion of all expressions by natural numbers (G¨odel numbering). In particular,
if σ is a sentence, then #σ is the G¨odel number of σ, a natural number. We
say that T (x) is a truth deﬁnition if:
(i) ∀x (T (x) →x ∈ω);
(ii) if σ is a sentence, then σ ↔T (#σ).
(12.17)
Theorem 12.7 (Tarski). A truth deﬁnition does not exist.
Proof. Let us assume that there is a formula T (x) satisfying (12.17). Let
ϕ0,
ϕ1,
ϕ2,
. . .
be an enumeration of all formulas with one free variable. Let ψ(x) be the
formula
x ∈ω ∧¬T (#(ϕx(x))).
There is a natural number k such that ψ is ϕk. Let σ be the sentence ψ(k).
Then we have
σ ↔ψ(k) ↔¬T (#(ϕk(k))) ↔¬T (#σ)
which contradicts (12.17).
⊓⊔

Relative Consistency
By G¨odel’s Second Incompleteness Theorem it is impossible to show the
consistency of ZF (or related theories) by means limited to ZF alone.
Once we assume that ZF (or ZFC) is consistent, we may ask whether the
theory remains consistent if we add an additional axiom A.
Let T be a mathematical theory (in our case, T is either ZF or ZFC), and
let A be an additional axiom. We say that T + A is consistent relative to T
(or that A is consistent with T) if the following implication holds:
if T is consistent, then so is T + A.
If both A and ¬A are consistent with T, we say that A is independent of T.
The question whether A is consistent with T is equivalent to the question
whether the negation of A is provable in T (provided T is consistent); this is
because T + A is consistent if and only if ¬A is not provable in T.
The way to show that an axiom A is consistent with ZF (ZFC) is to
use models. For assume that we have a model M (possibly a proper class)
of ZF such that M ⊨A. (More precisely, the relativizations σM hold for all
axioms σ of ZF, as well as AM.) Then A is consistent with ZF: If it were not,
then ¬A would be provable in ZF, and since M is a model of ZF, M would
satisfy ¬A. However, (¬A)M contradicts AM.
Transitive Models and ∆0 Formulas
If M is a transitive class then the model (M, ∈) is called a transitive model.
We note that transitive models satisfy the Axiom of Extensionality (see Ex-
ercise 12.4) and that every well-founded extensional model is isomorphic to
a transitive model (Theorem 6.15).
Deﬁnition 12.8. A formula of set theory is a ∆0-formula if
(i) it has no quantiﬁers, or
(ii) it is ϕ∧ψ, ϕ∨ψ, ¬ϕ, ϕ →ψ or ϕ ↔ψ where ϕ and ψ are ∆0-formulas,
or
(iii) it is (∃x ∈y) ϕ or (∀x ∈y) ϕ where ϕ is a ∆0-formula.
Lemma 12.9. If M is a transitive class and ϕ is a ∆0-formula, then for all
x1, . . . , xn,
(12.18)
ϕM(x1, . . . , xn) ↔ϕ(x1, . . . , xn).
If (12.18) holds, we say that the formula ϕ is absolute for the transitive
model M.

164
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Proof. If ϕ is an atomic formula, then (12.18) holds. If (12.18) holds for ϕ
and ψ, then it holds for ¬ϕ, ϕ ∧ψ, ϕ ∨ψ, ϕ →ψ, and ϕ ↔ψ.
Let ϕ be the formula (∃u ∈x) ψ(u, x, . . .) and assume that (12.18) is true
for ψ. We show that (12.18) is true for ϕ (the proof for ∀u ∈x is similar).
If ϕM holds then we have (∃u (u ∈x ∧ψ))M, i.e., (∃u ∈M)(u ∈x ∧ψM).
Since ψM ↔ψ, it follows that (∃u ∈x) ψ. Conversely, if (∃u ∈x) ψ, then
since M is transitive, u belongs to M, and since ψ(u, x, . . .) ↔ψM(u, x, . . .),
we have ∃u (u ∈M ∧u ∈x ∧ψM) and so ((∃u ∈x) ψ)M.
⊓⊔
Lemma 12.10. The following expressions can be written as ∆0-formulas
and thus are absolute for all transitive models.
(i) x = {u, v}, x = (u, v), x is empty, x ⊂y, x is transitive, x is an
ordinal, x is a limit ordinal, x is a natural number, x = ω.
(ii) Z = X × Y , Z = X −Y , Z = X ∩Y , Z =  X, Z = dom X,
Z = ran X.
(iii) X is a relation, f is a function, y = f(x), g = f↾X.
Proof.
(i) x = {u, v} ↔u ∈x ∧v ∈x ∧(∀w ∈x)(w = u ∨w = v).
x = (u, v) ↔(∃w ∈x)(∃z ∈x)(w = {u} ∧z = {u, v})
∧(∀w ∈x)(w = {u} ∨w = {u, v}).
x is empty ↔(∀u ∈x) u ̸= u.
x ⊂y ↔(∀u ∈x) u ∈y.
x is transitive ↔(∀u ∈x) u ⊂x.
x is an ordinal ↔x is transitive∧(∀u ∈x)(∀v ∈x)(u ∈v∨v ∈u∨u = v)
∧(∀u ∈x)(∀v ∈x)(∀w ∈x)(u ∈v ∈w →u ∈w).
x is a limit ordinal ↔x is an ordinal ∧(∀u ∈x)(∃v ∈x) u ∈v.
x is a natural number ↔x is an ordinal ∧(x is not a limit ∨x = 0)
∧(∀u ∈x)(u = 0 ∨u is not a limit).
x = ω ↔x is a limit ordinal ∧x ̸= 0 ∧(∀u ∈x) x is a natural number.
(ii) Z = X × Y ↔(∀z ∈Z)(∃x ∈X)(∃y ∈Y ) z = (x, y)
∧(∀x ∈X)(∀y ∈Y )(∃z ∈Z) z = (x, y).
Z = X −Y ↔(∀z ∈Z)(z ∈X ∧z /∈Y ) ∧(∀z ∈X)(z /∈Y →z ∈Z).
Z = X ∩Y . . . similar.
Z =  X ↔(∀z ∈Z)(∃x ∈X) z ∈x ∧(∀x ∈X)(∀z ∈x) z ∈Z.
Z = dom(X) ↔(∀z ∈Z) z ∈dom X ∧(∀z ∈dom X) z ∈Z,
and we show that:
(a) z ∈dom X is a ∆0-formula;
(b) if ϕ is ∆0, then (∀z ∈dom X) ϕ is ∆0.
(12.19)
(a) z ∈dom X ↔(∃x ∈X)(∃u ∈X)(∃v ∈u) x = (z, v).
(b) (∀z ∈dom X) ϕ ↔(∀x ∈X)(∀u ∈x)(∀z, v ∈u)(x = (z, v) →ϕ).
An assertion similar to (12.19) holds for ran(X), and for ∃.

⊓⊔
It should be emphasized that cardinal concepts are generally not absolute.
In particular, the following expressions are known not to be absolute:
Y = P(X),
|Y | = |X|,
α is a cardinal,
β = cf(α),
α is regular.
Compare with Exercise 12.6.
Consistency of the Axiom of Regularity
As an application of the theory of transitive models we show that the Axiom
of Regularity is consistent with the other axioms of ZF. In this section only
we work in the theory ZF minus Regularity, i.e., axioms 1.1–1.7.
The cumulative hierarchy Vα is deﬁned as in Chapter 6, and we denote (in
the present section only) V not the universal class but the class 
α∈Ord Vα.
We shall show that V is a transitive model of ZF. Thus the Axiom of Regu-
larity is consistent relative to the theory 1.1–1.7.
Theorem 12.11. In ZF minus Regularity, σV holds for every axiom σ
of ZF.
Proof. We use absoluteness of ∆0-formulas and the fact that for every set x,
if x ⊂V , then x ∈V .
Extensionality. The formula
((∀u ∈X) u ∈Y ∧(∀u ∈Y ) u ∈X) →X = Y
is ∆0.
Pairing. Given a, b ∈V , let c = {a, b}. The set c is in V and since “c = {a, b}”
is ∆0 (see Lemma 12.10), the Pairing Axiom holds in V .
Separation. Let ϕ be a formula; we shall show that
V ⊨∀X ∀p ∃Y ∀u (u ∈Y ↔u ∈X ∧ϕ(u, p)).
Given X, p ∈V , we let Y = {u ∈X : ϕV (u, p)}. Since Y ⊂X and X ∈V ,
we have Y ∈V , and
V ⊨∀u (y ∈Y ↔u ∈X ∧ϕ(u, p)).

166
Part I. Basic Set Theory
Union. Given X ∈V , let Y =  X. The set Y is in V and since “Y =  X”
is ∆0, the Axiom of Union holds in V .
Power Set. Given X ∈V , let Y = P(X). The set Y is in V , and we claim
that V ⊨∀u ϕ(u) where ϕ(u) is the formula u ∈Y ↔u ⊂X. Since ϕ(u)
is ∆0 and because ϕ(u) holds for all u, we have ϕV (u) for all u ∈V , as
claimed.
Inﬁnity. We want to show that
(12.20)
V ⊨∃S (∅∈S ∧(∀x ∈S) x ∪{x} ∈S).
The formula in (12.20) contains deﬁned notions, { }, ∪, and ∅; and strictly
speaking, we should ﬁrst eliminate these symbols and use a formula in which
they are replaced by their deﬁnitions, using only ∈and =. However, we have
already proved that both pairing and union are the same in the universe as
in V , and similarly one shows that X ∈V is empty if and only if (X is
empty)V . In other words,
{a, b}V = {a, b},
V X =  X,
∅V = ∅
where {a, b}V , V , and ∅V denote pairing, union, and the empty set in the
model V .
Since ω ∈V , we easily verify that (12.20) holds when S = ω.
Replacement. Let ϕ be a formula; we shall show that
V ⊨∀x ∀y ∀z (ϕ(x, y, p) ∧ϕ(x, z, p) →y = z)
→∀X ∃Y ∀y (y ∈Y ↔(∃x ∈X) ϕ(x, y, p)).
Given p ∈V , assume that V ⊨∀x ∀y ∀z ( . . . ). Thus
F = {(x, y) ∈V : ϕV (x, y, p)}
is a function, and we let Y = F(X). Since Y ⊂V , we have Y ∈V , and one
veriﬁes that for every y ∈V ,
V ⊨y ∈Y ↔(∃x ∈X) ϕ(x, y, p).
Regularity. We want to show that V ⊨∀S ϕ(S), where ϕ is the formula
S ̸= ∅→(∃x ∈S) S ∩x = ∅.
If S ∈V is nonempty, then let x ∈S be of least rank; then S ∩x = ∅.
Hence ϕ(S) is true for any S; moreover, (S ∩x)V = S ∩x, and ϕ is ∆0. Thus
V ⊨∀S ϕ(S).

Inaccessibility of Inaccessible Cardinals
Theorem 12.12. The existence of inaccessible cardinals is not provable
in ZFC. Moreover, it cannot be shown that the existence of inaccessible car-
dinals is consistent with ZFC.
We shall prove the ﬁrst assertion and invoke G¨odel’s Second Incomplete-
ness Theorem to obtain the second part.
First we prove (in ZFC):
Lemma 12.13. If κ is an inaccessible cardinal, then Vκ is a model of ZFC.
Proof. The proof of all axioms of ZFC except Replacement is as in the proof
of consistency of the Axiom of Regularity (see Exercises 12.7 and 12.8). To
show that Vκ ⊨Replacement, it is enough to show:
(12.21)
If F is a function from some X ∈Vκ into Vκ, then F ∈Vκ.
Since κ is inaccessible, we have |Vκ| = κ and |X| < κ for every X ∈Vκ. If
F is a function from X ∈Vκ into Vκ, then |F(X)| ≤|X| < κ and (since κ is
regular) F(X) ⊂Vα for some α < κ. It follows that F ∈Vκ.
⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 12.12. If κ is an inaccessible cardinal, then not only is Vκ
a model of ZFC, but in addition
(α is an ordinal)Vκ ↔α is an ordinal.
(α is a cardinal)Vκ ↔α is a cardinal.
(α is a regular cardinal)Vκ ↔α is a regular cardinal.
(α is an inaccessible cardinal)Vκ ↔α is an inaccessible cardinal.
We leave the details to the reader.
In particular, if κ is inaccessible cardinal, then
Vκ ⊨there is no inaccessible cardinal.
Thus we have a model of ZFC+“there is no inaccessible cardinal” (if there is
no inaccessible cardinal, we take the universe as the model). Hence it cannot
be proved in ZFC that inaccessible cardinals exist.
To prove the second part, assume that it can be shown that the existence
of inaccessible cardinals is consistent with ZFC; in other words, we assume
if ZFC is consistent, then so is ZFC + I
where I is the statement “there is an inaccessible cardinal.”
We naturally assume that ZFC is consistent. Since I is consistent with
ZFC, we conclude that ZFC + I is consistent. It is provable in ZFC + I that
there is a model of ZFC (Lemma 12.13). Thus the sentence “ZFC is consis-
tent” is provable in ZFC + I. However, we have assumed that “I is consistent
with ZFC” is provable, and so “ZFC+ I is consistent” is provable in ZFC+ I.
This contradicts G¨odel’s Second Incompleteness Theorem.
⊓⊔

168
Part I. Basic Set Theory
The wording of the second part of Theorem 12.12 (and its proof) is some-
what vague; “it cannot be shown” means: It cannot be shown by methods
formalizable in ZFC.
Reﬂection Principle
The theorem that we prove below is the analog of the L¨owenheim-Skolem
Theorem. While that theorem states that every model has a small elemen-
tary submodel, the Reﬂection Principle provides, for any ﬁnite number of
formulas, a set M that is like an “elementary submodel” of the universe,
with respect to the given formulas. The theorem is proved without the use
of the Axiom of Choice, but using the Axiom of Choice, one can obtain
countable model.
Theorem 12.14 (Reﬂection Principle).
(i) Let ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) be a formula. For each M0 there exists a set M ⊃M0
such that
(12.22)
ϕM(x1, . . . , xn) ↔ϕ(x1, . . . , xn)
for every x1, . . . , xn ∈M. (We say that M reﬂects ϕ.)
(ii) Moreover, there is a transitive M ⊃M0 that reﬂects ϕ; moreover,
there is a limit ordinal α such that M0 ⊂Vα and Vα reﬂects ϕ.
(iii) Assuming the Axiom of Choice, there is an M ⊃M0 such that M re-
ﬂects ϕ and |M| ≤|M0| · ℵ0. In particular, there is a countable M
that reﬂects ϕ.
Remarks. 1. We may require either that M be transitive or that |M| ≤
|M0| · ℵ0 but not both.
2. The proof works for any ﬁnite number of formulas, not just one. Thus
if ϕ1, . . . , ϕn are formulas, then there exists a set M that reﬂects each of ϕ1,
. . . , ϕn.
3. If σ is a true sentence, then the Reﬂection Principle yields a set M that
is a model of σ; using the Axiom of Choice, one can get a countable transitive
model of σ.
4. As a consequence of the Reﬂection Principle, and of G¨odel’s Second
Incompleteness Theorem, it follows that the theory ZF is not ﬁnitely axiom-
atizable: Any ﬁnite number of theorems of ZF have a model (a set) by the
Reﬂection Principle, while the existence of a model of ZF is not provable. (By
the same argument, no consistent extension of ZF is ﬁnitely axiomatizable.)
The key step in the proof of Theorem 12.14 is the following lemma, which
we prove ﬁrst.

12. Models of Set Theory
169
Lemma 12.15.
(i) Let ϕ(u1, . . . , un, x) be a formula. For each set M0 there exists a set
M ⊃M0 such that
(12.23)
if ∃x ϕ(u1, . . . , un, x)
then (∃x ∈M) ϕ(u1, . . . , un, x)
for every u1, . . . , un ∈M. Assuming the Axiom of Choice, there is
M ′ ⊃M0 such that (12.23) holds for M ′ and |M ′| ≤|M0| · ℵ0.
(ii) If ϕ1, . . ., ϕk are formulas, then for each M0 there is an M ⊃M0
such that (12.23) holds for each ϕ1, . . ., ϕk.
Proof. We shall give a detailed proof of (i). An obvious modiﬁcation of the
proof gives (ii); we leave that to the reader.
Note that the operation H(u1, . . . , un) deﬁned below plays the same role
as Skolem functions in the L¨owenheim-Skolem Theorem.
Let us recall the deﬁnition (6.4):
(12.24)
ˆC = {x ∈C : (∀z ∈C) rank x ≤rank z}.
For every u1, . . . , un, let
(12.25)
H(u1, . . . , un) = ˆC
where
(12.26)
C = {x : ϕ(u1, . . . , un, x)}.
Thus H(u1, . . . , un) is a set with the property
(12.27) if ∃x ϕ(u1, . . . , un, x),
then (∃x ∈H(u1, . . . , un)) ϕ(u1, . . . , un, x).
We construct the set M by induction. We let M = ∞
i=0 Mi where for each
i ∈N,
(12.28)
Mi+1 = Mi ∪{H(u1, . . . , un) : u1, . . . , un ∈Mi}.
Now, if u1, . . . , un ∈M, then there is an i ∈N such that u1, . . . , un ∈Mi
and if ϕ(u1, . . . , un, x) holds for some x, then it holds for some x ∈Mi+1, by
(12.27) and (12.28).
Assuming the Axiom of Choice, let F be a choice function on P(M).
For every u1, . . . , un ∈M, let h(u1, . . . , un) = F(H(u1, . . . , un)) (and let
h(u1, . . . , un) remain undeﬁned if H(u1, . . . , un) is empty). Let us deﬁne M ′ =
∞
i=0 M ′
i, where M ′
0 = M0 and for each i ∈N,
M ′
i+1 = M ′
i ∪{h(u1, . . . , un) : u1, . . . , un ∈M ′
i}.
Condition (12.23) can be veriﬁed for M ′ in the same way as for M. Moreover,
each M ′
i has cardinality at most |M0| · ℵ0, and so does M ′.
⊓⊔

Part I. Basic Set Theory
Proof of Theorem 12.14. Let ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) be a formula. We may assume
that the universal quantiﬁer does not occur in ϕ (∀x . . . can be replaced by
¬∃x ¬ . . . ). Let ϕ1, . . . , ϕk be all the subformulas of the formula ϕ.
Given a set M0, there exists, by Lemma 12.15(ii), a set M ⊃M0, such
that
(12.29)
∃x ϕj(u, . . . , x) →(∃x ∈M) ϕj(u, . . . , x),
j = 1, . . . , k
for all u, . . . ∈M. We claim that M reﬂects each ϕj, j = 1, . . . , k, and in
particular M reﬂects ϕ. This is proved by induction on the complexity of ϕj.
It is easy to see that (every) M reﬂects atomic formulas, and that if
M reﬂects formulas ψ and χ, then M reﬂects ¬ψ, ψ ∧χ, ψ ∨χ, ψ →χ, and
ψ ↔χ. Thus assume that M reﬂects ϕj(u1, . . . , um, x) and let us prove that
M reﬂects ∃x ϕj.
If u1, . . . , um ∈M, then
M ⊨∃x ϕj(u1, . . . , um, x) ↔(∃x ∈M) ϕM
j (u1, . . . , um, x)
↔(∃x ∈M) ϕj(u1, . . . , um, x)
↔∃x ϕj(u1, . . . , um, x).
The last equivalence holds by (12.29).
This proves part (i) of the theorem. Part (iii) is proved by taking M of
size ≤|M0| · ℵ0. To prove (ii), one has to modify the proof of Lemma 12.15
so that the set M used in (12.29) is transitive (or M = Vα). This is done as
follows: In (12.28), we replace Mi+1 by its transitive closure (or by the least
Vγ ⊃Mi+1). Then M is transitive (or M = Vα).

For concepts of model theory, the history of the subject and for model-theoretical
terminology, I refer the reader to Chang and Keisler’s book [1973].
Reduced products were ﬁrst investigated by Lo´s in [1955], who also proved
Theorem 12.3 on ultraproducts.
For Tarski’s Theorem 12.7, see Tarski [1939].
The impossibility of a consistency proof of the existence of inaccessible cardinals
follows from G¨odel’s Theorem [1931]. An argument that more or less establishes
the consistency of the Axiom of Regularity appeared in Skolem’s work in 1923 (see
Skolem [1970], pp. 137–152).
The study of transitive models of set theory originated with G¨odel’s work on
constructible sets. The Reﬂection Principle was introduced by Montague; see [1961]

13. Constructible Sets
Constructible sets were introduced by G¨odel in his proof of consistency of
the Axiom of Choice and of the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis. The
class L of all constructible sets (the constructible universe) is a transitive
model of ZFC, and is the smallest transitive model of ZF that contains all
ordinal numbers. In this chapter we study constructible sets and some related
concepts.
The Hierarchy of Constructible Sets
Recall that a set X is deﬁnable over a model (M, ∈) (where M is a set) if
there exist a formula ϕ ∈Form (the set of all formulas of the language {∈})
and some a1, . . . , an ∈M such that X = {x ∈M : (M, ∈) ⊨ϕ[x, a1, . . . , an]}.
Let
def(M) = {X ⊂M : X is deﬁnable over (M, ∈)}.
Clearly, M ∈def(M) and M ⊂def(M) ⊂P(M).
Deﬁnition 13.1. We deﬁne by transﬁnite induction
(i) L0 = ∅, Lα+1 = def(Lα),
(ii) Lα = 
β<α Lβ if α is a limit ordinal, and
(iii) L = 
α∈Ord Lα.
The (deﬁnable) class L is the class of constructible sets. The statement V = L,
i.e., “every set is constructible,” is the Axiom of Constructibility.
It follows from Deﬁnition 13.1 that ⟨Lα : α ∈Ord⟩is a cumulative hier-
archy (see (12.30)); in particular, each Lα is transitive, Lα ⊂Lβ if α < β,
and L is a transitive class.
Lemma 13.2. For every α, α ⊂Lα (and Lα ∩Ord = α).
Proof. By induction on α. At stage α + 1, we need to show that α ∈Lα+1,
or that α is a deﬁnable subset of Lα. Since α = {x ∈Lα : x is an ordinal},
and “x is an ordinal” is a ∆0 formula, we have α = {x ∈Lα : Lα ⊨x is an
ordinal}.
⊓⊔

176
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Theorem 13.3. L is a model of ZF.
Proof. We show that σL holds for every axiom σ of ZF. Since L is a transitive
class, every ∆0 formula is absolute for L.
Extensionality. L is transitive and therefore extensional.
Pairing. Given a, b ∈L, let c = {a, b}. Let α be such that a ∈Lα and b ∈Lα.
Since {a, b} is deﬁnable over Lα, we have c ∈Lα+1, and since “c = {a, b}”
is ∆0, the Pairing Axiom holds in L.
Separation. Let ϕ be a formula. Given X, p ∈L, we wish to show that the set
Y = {u ∈X : ϕL(u, p)} is in L. By the Reﬂection Principle (applied to the
cumulative hierarchy Lα, cf. Exercise 12.6), there exists an α such that X, p ∈
Lα and Y = {u ∈X : ϕLα(u, p)}. Thus Y = {u ∈Lα : Lα ⊨u ∈X ∧ϕ(u, p)}
and so Y ∈L.
Union. Given X ∈L, let Y =  X. As L is transitive, we have Y ⊂L; let α
be such that X ∈Lα and Y ⊂Lα. Y is deﬁnable over Lα by the ∆0 formula
“x ∈ X” and so Y ∈L. Since “Y =  X” is ∆0, the Axiom of Union holds
in L.
Power Set. Given X ∈L, let Y = P(X) ∩L. Let α be such that Y ⊂Lα.
Y is deﬁnable over Lα by the ∆0 formula “x ⊂X” and so Y ∈L. We
claim that Y = P L(X), i.e., that “Y is the power set of X” holds in L. But
“x ∈Y ↔x ⊂X” is a ∆0 formula true for every x ∈L.
Inﬁnity. We can repeat the proof from Theorem 12.11 as ω ∈L.
Replacement. The easiest way to verify these axioms is to refer to Exer-
cise 1.15, speciﬁcally to (1.10). If a class F is a function in L then for every
X ∈L there exists an α such that {F(x) : x ∈X} ⊂Lα. Since Lα ∈L, this
suﬃces.
Regularity. If S ∈L is nonempty, let x ∈S be such that x ∩S = ∅. Then
x ∈L and the ∆0 formula “x ∩S = ∅” holds in L.
⊓⊔
We will show that the model L satisﬁes both the Axiom of Choice and the
Generalized Continuum Hypothesis, thus establishing the consistency of AC
and GCH (relative to ZF). This will be done by showing that L is a model
of the Axiom of Constructibility (V = L), and that V = L implies both AC
and GCH.
It is rather clear that V = L implies AC: it is relatively straightforward to
deﬁne a well-ordering of L (by transﬁnite induction, using some enumeration
of the set Form of all formulas).
It may appear that L is trivially a model of “every set is constructible.”
However, to verify V = L in L, we have to prove ﬁrst that the property
“x is constructible” is absolute for L, i.e., that for every x ∈L we have
(x is constructible)L. We shall do this by analyzing the complexity of the
property “constructible.” While this can be done working directly with the
model-theoretic concepts involved, we prefer to use an alternative approach
(also due to G¨odel).

G¨odel Operations
The Axiom Schema of Separation states that given a formula ϕ(x), for ev-
ery X there exists a set Y = {u ∈X : ϕ(u)}. It turns out that for ∆0 for-
mulas, the construction of Y from X can be described by means of a ﬁnite
number of elementary operations.
Theorem 13.4 (G¨odel’s Normal Form Theorem). There exist opera-
tions G1, . . ., G10 such that if ϕ(u1, . . . , un) is a ∆0 formula, then there is
a composition G of G1, . . ., G10 such that for all X1, . . ., Xn,
(13.1)
G(X1, . . . , Xn) = {(u1, . . . , un) : u1 ∈X1, . . . , un ∈Xn and ϕ(u1, . . . , un)}.
The operations G1, . . . , G10 will be deﬁned below. Compositions of
G1, . . . , G10 are called G¨odel operations.
We call the following sentence an instance of ∆0-Separation:
(13.2)
∀p1 . . . ∀pn ∀X ∃Y ∀u (u ∈Y ↔u ∈X ∧ϕ(u, p1, . . . , pn))
where ϕ is a ∆0 formula. We say that a transitive class M satisﬁes ∆0-
Separation if for every ∆0 formula ϕ, M satisﬁes (13.2).
A class C is closed under an operation F if F(x1, . . . , xn) ∈C whenever
x1, . . . , xn ∈C. If a class M is closed under the operations G1, . . . , G10 then
M is closed under all G¨odel operations.
Corollary 13.5. If M is a transitive class closed under G¨odel operations
then M satisﬁes ∆0-Separation.
Proof. Let ϕ(u, p1, . . . , pn) be a ∆0 formula, and let X, p1, . . . , pn ∈M. Let
Y = {u ∈X : ϕ(u, p1, . . . , pn)}.
By Lemma 12.9 it suﬃces to show that Y ∈M, in order that M satisfy (13.2).
By G¨odel’s Normal Form Theorem, there is a G¨odel operation G such that
G(X, {p1}, . . . , {pn}) = {(u, p1, . . . , pn) : u ∈X ∧ϕ(u, p1, . . . , pn)}.
It follows that
Y = {u : ∃u1 . . . ∃un (u, u1, . . . , un) ∈G(X, {p1}, . . . , {pn})}
= dom . . . dom

Since both {x, y} and dom(x) are G¨odel operations (see below) and since
M is closed under G¨odel operations, we have Y ∈M.
⊓⊔

Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Deﬁnition 13.6 (G¨odel Operations).
G1(X, Y ) = {X, Y },
G2(X, Y ) = X × Y,
G3(X, Y ) = ε(X, Y ) = {(u, v) : u ∈X ∧v ∈Y ∧u ∈v},
G4(X, Y ) = X −Y,
G5(X, Y ) = X ∩Y,
G6(X) =  X,
G7(X) = dom(X),
G8(X) = {(u, v) : (v, u) ∈X},
G9(X) = {(u, v, w) : (u, w, v) ∈X},
G10(X) = {(u, v, w) : (v, w, u) ∈X}.
Proof of Theorem 13.4. The theorem is proved by induction on the complex-
ity of ∆0 formulas. To simplify matters, we consider only formulas of this
form:
(i) the only logical symbols in ϕ are ¬, ∧, and restricted ∃;
(ii) = does not occur;
(iii) the only occurrence of ∈is ui ∈uj where i ̸= j;
(iv) the only occurrence of ∃is
(∃um+1 ∈ui) ψ(u1, . . . , um+1)
where i ≤m.
(13.3)
Every ∆0 formula can be rewritten in this form: The use of logical symbols
can be restricted to ¬, ∧, and ∃; x = y can be replaced by (∀u ∈x) u ∈y ∧
(∀v ∈y) v ∈x, x ∈x can be replaced by (∃u ∈x) u = x and the bound vari-
ables in ϕ(u1, . . . , un) can be renamed so that the variable with the highest
index is quantiﬁed.
Note that we allow dummy variables, so that for instance ϕ(u1, . . . , u5) =
u3 ∈u2 and ϕ(u1, . . . , u6) = u3 ∈u2 are considered separately.
Thus let ϕ(u1, . . . , un) be a formula in the form (13.3) and let us assume
that the theorem holds for all subformulas of ϕ.
Case I. ϕ(u1, . . . , un) is an atomic formula ui ∈uj (i ̸= j). We prove this
case by induction on n.
Case Ia. n = 2. Here we have
{(u1, u2) : u1 ∈X1 ∧u2 ∈X2 ∧u1 ∈u2} = ε(X1, X2)
and
{(u1, u2) : u1 ∈X1 ∧u2 ∈X2 ∧u2 ∈u1} = G8(ε(X2, X1)).

13. Constructible Sets

Case Ib. n > 2 and i, j ̸= n. By the induction hypothesis, there is a G such
that
{(u1, . . . , un−1) : u1 ∈X1, . . . , un−1 ∈Xn−1 ∧ui ∈uj} = G(X1, . . . , Xn−1).
Obviously
{(u1, . . . , un) : u1 ∈X1, . . . , un ∈Xn ∧ui ∈uj} = G(X1, . . . , Xn−1) × Xn.
Case Ic. n > 2 and i, j ̸= n −1. By the induction hypothesis (Case Ib) there
is a G such that
{(u1, . . . , un−2, un, un−1) : u1 ∈X1, . . . , un ∈Xn and ui ∈uj}
= G(X1, . . . , Xn).
Noting that
(u1, . . . , un−2, un, un−1) = ((u1, . . . , un−2), un, un−1)
we get
{(u1, . . . , un) : u1 ∈X1, . . . , un ∈Xn and ui ∈uj} = G9(G(X1, . . . , Xn)).
Case Id. i = n −1, j = n. By Ia, we have
{(un−1, un) : un−1 ∈Xn−1 ∧un ∈Xn ∧un−1 ∈un} = ε(Xn−1, Xn)
and so
{((un−1, un), (u1, . . . , un−2)) : u1 ∈X1, . . . , un ∈Xn and un−1 ∈un}
= ε(Xn−1, Xn) × (X1 × . . . × Xn−2) = G(X1, . . . , Xn).
Now we note that
((un−1, un), (u1, . . . , un−2)) = (un−1, un, (u1, . . . , un−2))
and
(u1, . . . , un) = ((u1, . . . , un−2), un−1, un)
and thus
{(u1, . . . , un) : u1 ∈X1, . . . , un ∈Xn and un−1 ∈un} = G10(G(X1, . . . , Xn)).
Case Ie. i = n, j = n −1. Similar to Case Id.
Case II. ϕ(u1, . . . , un) is a negation, ¬ψ(u1, . . . , un). By the induction hy-
pothesis, there is a G such that
{(u1, . . . , un) : u1 ∈X1, . . . , un ∈Xn and ψ(u1, . . . , un)} = G(X1, . . . , Xn).
Clearly,
{(u1, . . . , un) : u1 ∈X1, . . . , un ∈Xn and ϕ(u1, . . . , un)}
= X1 × . . . × Xn −G(X1, . . . , Xn).

Case III. ϕ is a conjunction, ψ1 ∧ψ2. By the induction hypothesis,
{(u1, . . . , un) : u1 ∈X1, . . . , un ∈Xn and ψi(u1, . . . , un)} = G(i)(X1, . . . , Xn)
(i = 1, 2). Hence
{(u1, . . . , un) : u1 ∈X1, . . . , un ∈Xn and ϕ(u1, . . . , un)}
= G(1)(X1, . . . , Xn) ∩G(2)(X1, . . . , Xn).
Case IV. ϕ(u1, . . . , un) is the formula (∃un+1 ∈ui) ψ(u1, . . . , un+1). Let
χ(u1, . . . , un+1) be the formula ψ(u1, . . . , un+1)∧un+1 ∈ui. By the induction
hypothesis (we consider χ less complex than ϕ), there is a G such that
{(u1, . . . , un+1) : u1 ∈X1, . . . , un+1 ∈Xn+1 and χ(u1, . . . , un+1)}
= G(X1, . . . , Xn+1)
for all X1, . . . , Xn+1. We claim that
(13.4)
{(u1, . . . , un) : u1 ∈X1, . . . , un ∈Xn and ϕ(u1, . . . , un)}
= (X1 × . . . × Xn) ∩dom(G(X1, . . . , Xn,  Xi)).
Let us denote u = (u1, . . . , un) and X = X1 × . . . × Xn. For all u ∈X, we
have
ϕ(u) ↔(∃v ∈ui) ψ(ui, v)
↔∃v (v ∈ui ∧ψ(u, v) ∧v ∈ Xi)
↔u ∈dom{(u, v) ∈X ×  Xi : χ(u, v)}
and (13.4) follows. This completes the proof of Theorem 13.4.
⊓⊔
The following lemma shows that G¨odel operations are absolute for tran-
sitive models.
Lemma 13.7. If G is a G¨odel operation then the property Z = G(X1, . . . ,
Xn) can be written as a ∆0 formula.
Proof. We show, by induction on the complexity of G (a composition of G1,
. . . , G10):
(i) u ∈G(X, . . .) is ∆0.
(ii) If ϕ is ∆0, then so are ∀u ∈G(X, . . .) ϕ and ∃u ∈G(X, . . .) ϕ.
(iii) Z = G(X, . . .) is ∆0.
(iv) If ϕ is ∆0, then so is ϕ(G(X, . . .)).
(13.5)
We proved (iii) for most of the G1, . . . , G10 in Lemma 12.10; the rest of
the Gi are handled similarly, e.g.,
Z = G8(X)
↔(∀z ∈Z)(∃x ∈X)(∃u ∈ran X)(∃v ∈dom X)(x = (v, u) ∧z = (u, v))
∧(∀x ∈X)(∀u ∈ran X)(∀v ∈dom X)(∃z ∈Z)(x = (v, u) →z = (u, v)).

13. Constructible Sets
181
We shall prove (i) and (ii) only for a typical example and leave the full proof
to the reader (see also (12.19)). In (i) consider the formula
u ∈F(X, . . .) × G(X, . . .).
This can be written as
∃x ∈F(X, . . .) ∃y ∈G(X, . . .) u = (x, y).
In (ii), consider the formula
∀u ∈{F(X, . . .), G(X, . . .)} ϕ(u),
which can be written as
ϕ(F(X, . . .)) ∧ϕ(G(X, . . .)).
(iii) follows from (i) and (ii):
Z = G(X, . . .) ↔(∀u ∈Z) u ∈G(X, . . .) ∧∀u ∈G(X, . . .) u ∈Z.
To prove (iv), let ϕ be a ∆0 formula. Then G(X, . . .) occurs in ϕ(G(X, . . .))
in the form u ∈G(X, . . .), G(X, . . .) ∈u, Z = G(X, . . .), ∀u ∈G(X, . . .),
or ∃u ∈G(X, . . .). Since G(X, . . .) ∈u can be replaced by (∃v ∈u) v =
G(X, . . .), we use (i)–(iii) to show that ϕ(G(X, . . .)) is a ∆0 property.
⊓⊔
If ϕ is a formula then ϕM is a ∆0 formula, and so by Theorem 13.4 there
is a G¨odel operation G such that for every transitive set M and all a1, . . . , an,
{x ∈M : M ⊨ϕ[x, a1, . . . , an]} = {x ∈M : ϕM(x, a1, . . . , an)}
= G(M, a1, . . . , an).
The same argument, by induction on the complexity of ϕ, shows that for
every ϕ ∈Form, the set {x ∈M : M ⊨ϕ[x, a1, . . . , an]} is in the closure of
M ∪{M} under G1, . . . , G10.
Conversely, if G is a composition of G1, . . . , G10 then by Lemma 13.7
there is a ∆0 formula ϕ such that for all M and all a1, . . . , an, if X =
G(M, a1, . . . , an) then X = {x : ϕ(M, x, a1, . . . , an)}. If, moreover, M is
transitive and X ⊂M, then X = {x ∈M : M ⊨ψ[x, a1, . . . , an]} (where ψ is
an obvious modiﬁcation of ϕ, e.g., replacing ∃u ∈M by ∃u). Thus we have
the following description of def(M):
Corollary 13.8. For every transitive set M,
def(M) = cl(M ∪{M}) ∩P(M),
where cl denotes the closure under G1, . . ., G10.

Inner Models of ZF
An inner model of ZF is a transitive class that contains all ordinals and
satisﬁes the axioms of ZF. The constructible universe L is an inner model
of ZF, and as we show later in this chapter, L is the smallest inner model
of ZF.
In Chapter 12 we proved that ∆0 formulas are absolute for all transitive
models, i.e., ϕM is equivalent to ϕ, for every transitive class M. One can ex-
tend the use of superscripts to concepts other than formulas, namely classes,
operations and constants:
If C is a class {x : ϕ(x)} then CM denotes the class {x : ϕM(x)}. As
an example, OrdM is either Ord (if M contains all ordinals), or is the least
ordinal not in M.
If F is an operation then F M is the corresponding operation in M (if
x ∈M then F M(x) is deﬁned if M satisﬁes the statement that F(x) ex-
ists). If F M(x) = F(x) for all x for which F M(x) is deﬁned, we say that
F is absolute for M. By Lemma 13.7, all G¨odel operations are absolute for
transitive models. As an example, P M(X) = P(X) ∩M, and V M
α
= Vα ∩M
(Exercise 13.6).
Similarly, if c is a constant symbol then cM, if it exists, is the correspond-
ing constant in M. Thus ∅M = ∅(if ∅∈M), ωM = ω (if ω ∈M), etc.
The following theorem gives a necessary and suﬃcient condition for a tran-
sitive class to be an inner model of ZF:
Theorem 13.9. A transitive class M is an inner model of ZF if and only if
it is closed under G¨odel operations and is almost universal, i.e., every subset
X ⊂M is included in some Y ∈M.
Proof. As G¨odel operations are absolute for transitive models, an inner model
is necessarily closed under G1, . . . , G10. If X is a subset of an inner model M,
then X ⊂Vα ∩M for some α, and Vα ∩M is in M because α ∈M and
Vα ∩M = V M
α . Thus the condition is necessary.
Now let M be a transitive almost universal class that is closed under G¨odel
operations. Except for the Separation Schema, the veriﬁcation of the axioms
of ZF in M follows closely the proof of Theorem 13.3 (or of Theorem 12.11),
but using almost universality. For example, if X ∈M then P(X) ∩M is
included in some Y ∈M, verifying the weak version (1.9) of the Power Set
Axiom. We leave the details to the reader.
Separation. We will show that for every X ∈M the set Y = {u ∈X : ϕM(u)}
is in M. (For simplicity, we disregard the parameter in the formula ϕ.)
Let ϕ(u1, . . . , un) be a formula with k quantiﬁers. We let ¯ϕ(u1, . . . , un,
Y1, . . . , Yk) be the ∆0 formula obtained by replacing each ∃x (or ∀x) in ϕ by
∃x ∈Yj (or ∀x ∈Yj) for j = 1, . . . , k. We shall prove, by induction on k,
that for every ϕ(u1, . . . , un) with k quantiﬁers, for every X ∈M there exist

13. Constructible Sets
183
Y1, . . . , Yk ∈M such that
ϕM(u1, . . . , un) if and only if ¯ϕ(u1, . . . , un, Y1, . . . , Yk)
for all u1, . . . , un ∈X. Then it follows that Y = {u ∈X : ¯ϕ(u, Y1, . . . , Yk)},
and since M satisﬁes ∆0-Separation (by Corollary 13.5), we have veriﬁed that
Y ∈M, completing the proof.
If k = 0 then ¯ϕ = ϕ. For the induction step, let ϕ(u) be ∃v ψ(u, v) where
ψ has k quantiﬁers. Thus ¯ϕ is (∃v ∈Yk+1) ¯ψ(u, v, Y1, . . . , Yk).
Let X ∈M. We look for Y1, . . . , Yk, Yk+1 ∈M such that for every u ∈X,
(13.6)
(∃v ψ(u, v))M
if and only if
(∃v ∈Yk+1) ¯ψ(u, v, Y1, . . . , Yk).
By the Collection Principle (6.5) (applied to the formula v ∈M ∧
ψM(u, v)), there exists a set M1 such that X ⊂M1 ⊂M and that for
every u ∈X,
(13.7)
(∃v ∈M) ψM(u, v)
if and only if
(∃v ∈M1) ψM(u, v).
Since M is almost universal, there exists a set Y ∈M such that M1 ⊂Y . It
follows from (13.7) that for every u ∈X,
(∃v ∈M) ψM(u, v)
if and only if
(∃v ∈Y ) ψM(u, v).
By the induction hypothesis, given Y ∈M, there exist Y1, . . . , Yk ∈M such
that for all u, v ∈Y ,
ψM(u, v)
if and only if
¯ψ(u, v, Y1, . . . , Yk).
Thus we let Yk+1 = Y , and since X ⊂Y , we have for all u ∈X,
(∃v ψ(u, v))M
if and only if
(∃v ∈M) ψM(u, v)
if and only if
(∃v ∈Y ) ψM(u, v)
if and only if
(∃v ∈Y ) ¯ψ(u, v, Y1, . . . , Yk).

The L´evy Hierarchy
Deﬁnable concepts can be classiﬁed by means of the following hierarchy of
formulas, introduced by Azriel L´evy:
A formula is Σ0 and Π0 if its only quantiﬁers are bounded, i.e., a ∆0 for-
mula. Inductively, a formula is Σn+1 if it is of the form ∃x ϕ where ϕ is Πn,
and Πn+1 if its is of the form ∀x ϕ where ϕ is Σn.
We say that a property (class, relation) is Σn (or Πn) if it can be expressed
by a Σn (or Πn) formula. A function F is Σn (Πn) if the relation y = F(x)
is Σn (Πn).

This classiﬁcation of deﬁnable concepts is not syntactical: To verify that
a concept can be expressed in a certain way may need a proof (in ZF). To
illustrate this, consider the proof of Lemma 13.10 bellow: To contract two
like quantiﬁers into one uses an application of the Pairing Axiom.
Whenever we say that a property P is Σn we always mean P can be
expressed by a Σn formula in ZF, unless we speciﬁcally state which axioms
of ZF are assumed. Since every proof uses only ﬁnitely many axioms, every
speciﬁc property requires a ﬁnite set Σ of axioms of ZF for its classiﬁcation
in the hierarchy. This ﬁnite set is implicit in the use of the deﬁning formula.
When M is a transitive model of Σ then the relativization P M is unambigu-
ous, namely the formula ϕM. We call such transitive models adequate for P.
A property is ∆n if it is both Σn and Πn.
Lemma 13.10. Let n ≥1.
(i) If P, Q are Σn properties, then so are ∃x P, P ∧Q, P ∨Q, (∃u ∈x) P,
(∀u ∈x) P.
(ii) If P, Q are Πn properties, then so are ∀x P, P ∧Q, P ∨Q, (∀u ∈x) P,
(∃u ∈x) P.
(iii) If P is Σn, then ¬P is Πn; if P is Πn, then ¬P is Σn.
(iv) If P is Πn and Q is Σn, then P →Q is Σn; if P is Σn and Q is Πn,
then P →Q is Πn
(v) If P and Q are ∆n, then so are ¬P, P ∧Q, P ∨Q, P →Q, P ↔Q,
(∀u ∈x) P, (∃u ∈x) P.
(vi) If F is a Σn function, then dom(F) is a Σn class.
(vii) If F is a Σn function and dom(F) is ∆n, then F is ∆n.
(viii) If F and G are Σn functions, then so is F ◦G.
(ix) If F is a Σn function and if P is a Σn property, then P(F(x)) is Σn.
Proof. Let us prove the lemma for n = 1. The general case follows easily by
induction.
(i) Let
P(x, . . .) ↔∃z ϕ(z, x, . . .),
Q(x, . . .) ↔∃u ψ(u, x, . . .)
where ϕ and ψ are ∆0 formulas. We have
(13.8)
∃x P(x, . . .) ↔∃x ∃z ϕ(z, x, . . .)
↔∃v ∃w ∈v ∃x ∈w ∃z ∈w (v = (x, z) ∧ϕ(z, x, . . .)).
The right-hand side of (13.8) is a Σ1 formula. Furthermore,
P(x, . . .) ∧Q(x, . . .) ↔∃z ∃u (ϕ(z, x, . . .) ∧ψ(u, x, . . .)),
P(x, . . .) ∨Q(x, . . .) ↔∃z ∃u (ϕ(z, x, . . .) ∨ψ(u, x, . . .)),
(∃u ∈x) P(u, . . .) ↔∃z ∃u (u ∈x ∧ϕ(z, u, . . .)).

13. Constructible Sets

To show that (∀u ∈x) P is a Σ1 property, we use the Collection Principle:
(∀u ∈x) P(u, . . .) ↔(∀u ∈x) ∃z ϕ(z, u, . . .)
↔∃y (∀u ∈x)(∃z ∈y) ϕ(z, u, . . .).
(ii) follows from (i) and (iii).
(iii)
¬∃z ϕ(z, x, . . .) ↔∀z ¬ϕ(z, x, . . .),
¬∀z ϕ(z, x, . . .) ↔∃z ¬ϕ(z, x, . . .).
(iv)
(P →Q) ↔(¬P ∨Q).
(v) follows from (i)–(iv).
(vi)
x ∈dom(F) ↔∃y y = F(x).
(vii) Since F is a function, we have
(13.9)
y = F(x) ↔x ∈dom(F) ∧∀z (z = F(x) →y = z).
If z = F(x) is Σn and x ∈dom(F) is Πn, then the right-hand side of (13.9)
is Πn.
(viii)
y = F(G(x)) ↔∃z (z = G(x) ∧y = F(z)).
(ix)
P(F(x)) ↔∃y (y = F(x) ∧P(y)).
⊓⊔
Since ∆0 properties are absolute for all transitive models, it is clear that
Σ1 properties are upward absolute: If P(x) is Σ1 and if M is a transitive
model (adequate for P) then for all x ∈M, P M(x) implies P(x). Similarly,
Π1 properties are downward absolute, and consequently, ∆1 properties are
absolute for transitive models.
As an example of a ∆1 property we show
Lemma 13.11. “E is a well-founded relation on P” is a ∆1 property.
Proof. The following is a Π1 formula: E is a relation on P and ∀X ϕ(E, P, X),
where ϕ(E, P, X) is the formula
∅̸= X ⊂P →(∃a ∈X) a is E-minimal in X.
(Both “E is a relation on P” and ϕ(E, P, X) are ∆0 formulas.)
On the other hand, E is well-founded if and only if there exists a function f
from P into Ord such that f(x) < f(y) whenever x E y. Thus we have an
equivalent Σ1 formula: E is a relation on P and ∃f (f is a function ∧(∀u ∈
ran(f)) u is an ordinal ∧(∀x, y ∈P)(x E y →f(x) < f(y))).
⊓⊔

Other examples of ∆1 concepts are given in the Exercises.
Lemma 13.12. Let n ≥1, let G be a Σn function (on V ), and let F be
deﬁned by induction:
F(α) = G(F↾α).
Then F is a Σn function on Ord.
Proof. Since Ord is a Σ0 class, it is enough to verify that the following ex-
pression is Σn:
(13.10) y = F(α) if and only if ∃f (f is a function ∧dom(f) = α
∧(∀ξ < α) f(ξ) = G(f↾ξ) ∧y = G(f)).
All the properties and operations in (13.10) are Σ0 and G is Σn, and hence
y = F(α) is Σn.
⊓⊔
The power set operation P(X) is obviously Π1; since it is not absolute as
we shall see in Chapter 14, it is not Σ1. Similarly, cardinal concepts are Π1
but not Σ1:
Lemma 13.13. “α is a cardinal,” “α is a regular cardinal,” and “α is a limit
cardinal” are Π1.
Proof. (a) ¬∃f (f is a function and dom(f) ∈α and ran(f) = α).
(b) α > 0 is a limit ordinal and
¬∃f (f is a function and dom(f) ∈α and  ran(f) = α).
(c) (∀β < α)(∃γ < α)(β < γ and γ is a cardinal).
⊓⊔
Consequently, if M is an inner model of ZF, then every cardinal (regular
cardinal, limit cardinal) is a cardinal (regular cardinal, limit cardinal) in M,
and if |X|M = |Y |M then |X| = |Y |.
In Chapter 12 we pointed out that the satisfaction relation (V, ∈) ⊨
ϕ[a1, . . . , an] (for ϕ ∈Form) is not formalizable in ZF; this follows from
Theorem 12.7. For any particular n, the satisfaction relation ⊨n restricted
to Σn formulas is formalizable: For n = 0, we can use the absoluteness of
∆0 formulas for transitive models,
⊨0 ϕ[a1, . . . , ak]
if and only if
ϕ ∈Form, ϕ is ∆0, and ∃M (M is transitive and (M, ∈) ⊨ϕ[a1, . . . , ak]);
then inductively
⊨n+1 (∃x ϕ)[a1, . . . , ak]
if and only if
ϕ ∈Form, ϕ is Πn, and ∃a ¬ ⊨n (¬ϕ)[a, a1, . . . , ak].
Similarly, we can deﬁne ⊨M
n for any particular n and any transitive class M.
Even more generally, we can deﬁne ⊨(M,∈)
n
for any class M (transitive or not).

13. Constructible Sets
187
If M ⊂N, we say that (M, ∈) is a Σn-elementary submodel of (N, ∈),
(M, ∈) ≺Σn (N, ∈),
if for every Σn formula ϕ ∈Form and all a1, . . . , ak ∈M, ⊨M
n ϕ[a1, . . . , ak] ↔
⊨N
n ϕ[a1, . . . , ak].
Absoluteness of Constructibility
We prove in this section that the property “x is constructible” is absolute for
inner models of ZF.
Lemma 13.14. The function α →Lα is ∆1.
Proof. The function Lα is deﬁned by transﬁnite induction and so by Lem-
ma 13.12 it suﬃces to show that the induction step is Σ1. In view of Corol-
lary 13.8 it suﬃces to verify that
(13.11)
Y = cl(M)
(where cl denotes closure under G¨odel operations) is Σ1. But (13.11) is equiv-
alent to
∃W [W is a function ∧dom(W) = ω ∧Y =  ran(W) ∧W(0) = M
∧(∀n ∈dom(W))(W(n + 1) = W(n) ∪{Gi(x, y) : x ∈W(n), y ∈W(n),
i = 1, . . . , 10})].
⊓⊔
Corollary 13.15. The property “x is constructible” is absolute for inner
models of ZF.
Proof. Let M be an inner model of ZF. Since M ⊃Ord, we have for all
x ∈M
(x is constructible)M ↔∃α ∈M x ∈LM
α ↔∃α x ∈Lα ↔x is constructible.
⊓⊔
As an immediate consequence we have.
Theorem 13.16 (G¨odel).
(i) L satisﬁes the Axiom of Constructibility (V = L).
(ii) L is the smallest inner model of ZF.
Proof. (i) For every x ∈L, (x is constructible)L if and only if x is con-
structible, and hence “every set is constructible” holds in L.
(ii) If M is an inner model then LM (the class of all constructible sets
in M) is L and so L ⊂M.
⊓⊔

Part II. Advanced Set Theory
A detailed analysis of absoluteness of Lα for transitive models reveals
that the following concept of adequacy suﬃces: Let us call a transitive set M
adequate if
(i) M is closed under G1, . . . , G10,
(ii) for all U ∈M, {Gi(x, y) : x, y ∈U and i = 1, . . . , 10} ∈M,
(iii) if α ∈M then ⟨Lβ : β < α⟩∈M.
(13.12)
It follows that the ∆1 function α →Lα is absolute for every adequate tran-
sitive set M. Also, we can verify that for every limit ordinal δ, the transitive
set Lδ is adequate. Moreover, adequacy can by formulated as follows: There
is a sentence σ such that for every transitive set M, M is adequate if and
only if (M, ∈) ⊨σ. Therefore there exists a sentence σ (which is Π2) such
that for every transitive set M
(13.13)
(M, ∈) ⊨σ
if and only if
M = Lδ for some limit ordinal δ.
This leads to the following:
Lemma 13.17 (G¨odel’s Condensation Lemma). For every limit ordi-
nal δ, if M ≺(Lδ, ∈) then the transitive collapse of M is Lγ for some γ ≤δ.
⊓⊔
We wish to make two remarks at this point. First, it is enough to assume
only M ≺Σ1 Lδ for the Condensation Lemma to hold (as the sentence σ
in (13.13)) is Π2. Secondly, the careful analysis of the deﬁnition of Lα makes
it possible to ﬁnd a Π2 sentence σ such that (13.13) holds even for (inﬁnite)
successor ordinals δ. Thus G¨odel’s Condensation Lemma holds for all inﬁnite
ordinals δ, a fact that is useful in some applications of L.
Consistency of the Axiom of Choice
Theorem 13.18 (G¨odel). There exists a well-ordering of the class L. Thus
V = L implies the Axiom of Choice.
Combining Theorems 13.16 and 13.18, we conclude that the Axiom of
Choice holds in the model L, and so it is consistent with ZF.
Proof. We will show that L has a deﬁnable well-ordering.
By induction, we construct for each α a well-ordering <α of Lα. We do it
in such a way that if α < β, then <β is an end-extension of <α, i.e.,
(i) if x <α y, then x <β y;
(ii) if x ∈Lα and y ∈Lβ −Lα, then x <β y.
(13.14)
Notice that (13.14) implies that if x ∈y ∈Lα, then x <α y.

13. Constructible Sets
189
First let us assume that α is a limit ordinal and that we have con-
structed <β for all β < α and that if β1 < β2 < α, then <β2 is an end-
extension of <β1. In this case we simply let
<α = 
β<α
<β,
i.e., if x, y ∈Lα, we let
x <α y
if and only if
(∃β < α) x <β y.
Thus assume that we have deﬁned <α and let us construct <α+1, a well-
ordering of Lα+1. We recall the deﬁnition of Lα+1:
Lα+1 = P(Lα) ∩cl(Lα ∪{Lα}) = P(Lα) ∩
∞

n=0
W α
n ,
where
W α
0 = Lα ∪{Lα},
W α
n+1 = {Gi(X, Y ) : X, Y ∈W α
n , i = 1, . . . , 10}.
The idea of the construction of <α+1 is now as follows: First we take the ele-
ments of Lα, then Lα, then the remaining elements of W α
1 , then the remaining
elements of W α
2 , etc. To order the elements of W α
n+1, we use the already de-
ﬁned well-ordering of W α
n since every x ∈W α
n+1 is equal to Gi(u, v) for some
i = 1, . . . , 10 and some u, v ∈W α
n . We let
(i) <0
α+1 is the well-ordering of Lα ∪{Lα} that extends <α and
such that Lα is the last element.
(ii) <n+1
α+1 is the following well-ordering of W α
n+1:
x <n+1
α+1 y if and only if either: x <n
α+1 y,
or: x ∈W α
n and y /∈W α
n ,
or: x /∈W α
n and y /∈W α
n and
(a) the least i such that ∃u, v ∈W α
n (x = Gi(u, v)) < the
least j such that ∃s, t ∈W α
n (x = Gi(s, t)), or
(b) the least i = the least j and
[the <n
α+1-least u ∈W α
n such that ∃v ∈W α
n (x = Gi(u, v))]
<n
α+1 [the <n
α+1-least s ∈W α
n such that ∃t ∈W α
n (x =
Gi(s, t))], or
(c) the least i = the least j and the least u = the least s and
[the <n
α+1-least v ∈W α
n such that x = Gi(u, v)] <n
α+1
[the <n
α+1-least t ∈W α
n such that x = Gi(u, t)].
(13.15)
Now we let
(13.16)
<α+1 =
∞

n=0
<n
α+1 ∩(P(Lα) × P(Lα)),
and it is clear that <α+1 is an end-extension of <α and is a well-ordering
of Lα+1.

190
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Having deﬁned <α for all α, we let
x <L y
if and only if
∃α x <α y.
The relation <L is a well-ordering of L.
⊓⊔
We call <L the canonical well-ordering of L.
The proof of Theorem 13.18 gives additional information about the com-
plexity of the canonical well-ordering of L.
Lemma 13.19. The relation <L is Σ1 and moreover, for every limit ordi-
nal δ and every y ∈Lδ, x <L y if and only if x ∈Lδ and (Lδ, ∈) ⊨x <L y.
Proof. It suﬃces to prove that the function, α →<α which assigns to each α
the canonical well-ordering of Lα is Σ1.
The function α →<α is deﬁned by induction and thus it suﬃces to show
that the induction step is Σ1. In fact, <α+1 is deﬁned by induction from <α
(see (13.15) and (13.16)). It suﬃces to verify that <α+1 is obtained from <α
by means of a ∆1 operation (similar to the way in which Lα+1 is obtained
from Lα by Lα+1 = def(Lα)). The operation that yields <α+1 when applied
to <α is described in detail in (13.15). It can be written in a Σ1 fashion in
very much the same way as (13.11). The only potential diﬃculty might be
the use of the words “the <-least,” and that can be overcome as follows: For
example, in (13.15)(ii)(c)
the <n
α+1-least v ∈W α
n such that x = Gi(u, v)
<n
α+1 the <n
α+1-least t ∈W α
n such that y = Gi(u, t)
can be written as
(∃v ∈W α
n )[x = Gi(u, v) ∧(∀t ∈W α
n )(y = Gi(u, t) →v <n
α+1 t)].
The function α →<α is absolute for every adequate M (see (13.12)) and
therefore for every Lδ where δ is a limit ordinal.
⊓⊔
Consistency of the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis
Theorem 13.20 (G¨odel). If V = L then 2ℵα = ℵα+1 for every α.
Proof. We shall prove that if X is a constructible subset of ωα then there
exists a γ < ωα+1 such that X ∈Lγ. Therefore P L(ωα) ⊂Lωα+1, and
since |Lωα+1| = ℵα+1 (this is easy to show; see Exercise 13.19), we have
|P L(ωα)| ≤ℵα+1.
Thus let X ⊂ωα. There exists a limit ordinal δ > ωα such that X ∈Lδ.
Let M be an elementary submodel of Lδ such that ωα ⊂M and X ∈M, and

13. Constructible Sets
191
that |M| = ℵα. (As we can construct M within L which satisﬁes AC, this
can be done even if AC does not hold in the universe.)
By the Condensation Lemma 13.17, the transitive collapse N of M is Lγ
for some γ ≤δ. Clearly, γ is a limit ordinal, and γ < ωα+1 because |N| =
|γ| = ℵα. As ωα ⊂M, the collapsing map π is the identity on ωα and so
π(X) = X. Hence X ∈Lγ.
⊓⊔
The next theorem illustrates further the signiﬁcance of G¨odel’s Conden-
sation Lemma. The combinatorial principle ♦was formulated by Ronald
Jensen.
Theorem 13.21 (Jensen). V = L implies the Diamond Principle:
(♦) There exists a sequence of sets ⟨Sα : α < ω1⟩with Sα ⊂α, such that
for every X ⊂ω1, the set {α < ω1 : X ∩α = Sα} is a stationary subset
of ω1.
The sequence ⟨Sα : α < ω1⟩is called a ♦-sequence.
Proof. Assume V = L. By induction on α < ω1, we deﬁne a sequence of pairs
(Sα, Cα), α < ω1, such that Sα ⊂α and Cα is a closed unbounded subset
of α. We let S0 = C0 = ∅and Sα+1 = Cα+1 = α + 1 for all α. If α is a limit
ordinal, we deﬁne:
(13.17)
(Sα, Cα) is the <L-least pair such that Sα ⊂α, Cα is a closed
unbounded subset of α, and Sα ∩ξ ̸= Sξ for all ξ ∈Cα; if no such
pair exists, let Sα = Cα = α.
We are going to show that the sequence ⟨Sα : α < ω1⟩is a ♦-sequence. Thus
assume the contrary; then for some X ⊂ω1, there exists a closed unbounded
set C such that
(13.18)
X ∩α ̸= Sα
for all α ∈C.
Let (X, C) be the <L-least pair such that X ⊂ω1, C is a closed unbounded
subset of ω1, and such that (13.18) holds.
Since ⟨(Sα, Cα) : α < ω1⟩is a ω1-sequence of pairs of subsets of ω1, it
belongs to Lω2, and moreover, it satisﬁes the same deﬁnition (13.17) in the
model (Lω2, ∈). Also, (X, C) ∈Lω2, and (X, C) is, in (Lω2, ∈), the <L-least
pair such that X ⊂ω1, C is a closed unbounded subset of ω1, and such
that (13.18) holds.
Let N be a countable elementary submodel of (Lω2, ∈). Since (X, C) and
⟨(Sα, Cα) : α < ω1⟩are deﬁnable in (Lω2, ∈), they belong to N. The set
ω1 ∩N is an initial segment of ω1 (see Exercise 13.18), thus let δ = ω1 ∩N.
The transitive collapse of N is Lγ, for some γ < ω1, and let π : N →Lγ
be the isomorphism. We have π(ω1) = δ, π(X) = X ∩δ, π(C) = C ∩δ and
π(⟨(Sα, Cα) : α < ω1⟩) = ⟨(Sα, Cα) : α < δ⟩.

192
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Therefore (Lδ, ∈) satisﬁes
(13.19)
(X ∩δ, C ∩δ) is the <L-least pair (Z, D) such that Z ⊂δ, D ⊂δ is
closed unbounded and Z ∩ξ ̸= Sξ for all ξ ∈D.
By absoluteness, (13.19) holds (in L, and L = V ) and therefore, by (13.17),
X ∩δ = Sδ. Since C ∩δ is unbounded in δ, and C is closed, it follows that
δ ∈C. This contradicts (13.18).
⊓⊔
Relative Constructibility
Constructibility can be generalized by considering sets constructible relative
to a given set A, resulting in an inner model L[A]. The idea is to relativize
the hierarchy Lα by using the generalization
(13.20)
defA(M) = {X ⊂M : X is deﬁnable over (M, ∈, A ∩M)}
where A ∩M is considered a unary predicate. A generalization of Corol-
lary 13.8 provides an alternative description of defA: For every transitive
set M,
(13.21)
defA(M) = cl(M ∪{M} ∪{A ∩M}) ∩P(M).
The class of all sets constructible from A is deﬁned as follows:
(13.22)
L0[A] = ∅,
Lα+1[A] = defA(Lα[A]),
Lα[A] = 
β<α
Lβ[A]
if α is a limit ordinal,
L[A] =

α∈Ord
Lα[A].
The following theorem is the generalization of the relevant theorem on con-
structible sets:
Theorem 13.22. Let A be an arbitrary set.
(i) L[A] is a model of ZFC.
(ii) L[A] satisﬁes the axiom ∃X (V = L[X]).
(iii) If M is an inner model of ZF such that A ∩M ∈M, then L[A] ⊂M.
(iv) There exists α0 such that for all α ≥α0,
L[A] ⊨2ℵα = ℵα+1.
Proof. The proof follows closely the corresponding proofs for L, but some
additional arguments are needed.
Lemma 13.23. Let ¯A = A ∩L[A]. Then L[ ¯A] = L[A] and moreover ¯A ∈
L[ ¯A].

13. Constructible Sets
193
Proof. We show by induction on α that Lα[ ¯A] = Lα[A]. The induction step
is obvious if α is a limit ordinal; thus assume that Lα[ ¯A] = Lα[A] and let us
prove Lα+1[ ¯A] = Lα+1[A].
If we denote U = Lα[A], then we have
A ∩U = A ∩U ∩L[A] = ¯A ∩U,
and since defA(U) = defA∩U(U), we have
Lα+1[A] = defA(U) = defA∩U(U) = def ¯
A(U) = Lα+1[ ¯A].
Thus L[ ¯A] = L[A]. Moreover, there is α such that A ∩L[A] = A ∩Lα[A] and
thus ¯A ∈Lα+1[A].
⊓⊔
By Lemma 13.23 we may assume that A ∈L[A]. In this case, L[A] can
be well-ordered by a relation that is deﬁnable from A.
In analogy with (13.13) there exists a Π2 sentence (in the language {∈, A}
where A is a unary predicate) such that for every transitive set M
(13.23) (M, ∈, A ∩M) ⊨σ if and only if M = Lδ for some limit ordinal δ.
The Condensation Lemma is generalized as follows:
Lemma 13.24. If M ≺(Lδ[A], ∈, A∩Lδ[A]) where δ is a limit ordinal, then
the transitive collapse of M is Lγ[A] for some γ ≤δ.
⊓⊔
Consequently, if A ⊂Lωα[A] then for every X ⊂ωα in L[A] there exists
a γ < ωα+1 such that X ∈Lγ[A], completing the proof of Theorem 13.22.
⊓⊔
A consequence of Theorem 13.22(iv) is that if V = L[A] and A ⊂ω, then
the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis holds. For a slightly better result, see
Exercise 13.26.
A diﬀerent generalization yields for every set A the smallest inner model
L(A) that contains A. (As an example, L(R) is the smallest inner model that
contains all reals.) The model L(A) need not, however, satisfy the Axiom of
Choice.
We deﬁne L(A) as follows: Let T = TC({A}) be transitive closure of A
(to ensure that the resulting class L(A) is transitive), and let
(13.24)
L0(A) = T,
Lα+1(A) = def(Lα(A)),
Lα(A) = 
β<α
Lβ(A)
if α is a limit ordinal, and
L(A) =

α∈Ord
Lα(A).
The transitive class L(A) is an inner model of ZF, contains A, and is the
smallest such inner model.

Ordinal-Deﬁnable Sets
A set X is ordinal-deﬁnable if there is a formula ϕ such that
(13.25)
X = {u : ϕ(u, α1, . . . , αn)}
for some ordinal numbers α1, . . . , αn.
It is not immediate clear that the property “ordinal-deﬁnable” is express-
ible in the language of set theory. Thus we give a diﬀerent deﬁnition of ordinal
deﬁnable sets and show that it is equivalent to (13.25).
We recall that cl(M) denotes the closure of a set M under G¨odel opera-
tions. The class OD of all ordinal-deﬁnable sets is deﬁne as follows:
(13.26)
OD =

α∈Ord
cl{Vβ : β < α}.
In other words, OD is the G¨odel closure of {Vα : α ∈Ord}, that is, ordinal
deﬁnable sets are obtained from the Vα by applications of G¨odel operations.
We shall show that the elements of the class OD are exactly the sets satisfy-
ing (13.25).
Lemma 13.25. There exists a deﬁnable well-ordering of the class OD (and
a one-to-one deﬁnable mapping F of Ord onto OD).
Proof. Earlier we described how to construct from a given well-ordering of
a set M, a well-ordering of the set cl(M). For every α, the set {Vβ : β < α}
has an obvious well-ordering, which induces a well-ordering of cl{Vβ : β < α}.
Thus we get a well-ordering of the class OD, and denote F the corresponding
(deﬁnable) one-to-one mapping of Ord onto OD.
⊓⊔
Now it follows that every X ∈OD has the form (13.25). There exists α
such that X = {u : ϕ(u, α)} where ϕ(u, α) is the formula u ∈F(α).
We shall show that on the other hand, if ϕ is a formula and X is the set
in (13.25), then X ∈OD. By the Reﬂection Principle, let β be such that
X ⊂Vβ, α1, . . . , αn < β and that Vβ reﬂects ϕ. Then we have
X = {u ∈Vβ : ϕVβ(u, α1, . . . , αn)}.
Since ϕVβ is a ∆0 formula, we apply the normal form theorem and ﬁnd a G¨odel
operation G such that X = G(Vβ, α1, . . . , αn). Since every α is obtained (uni-
formly) from Vα by a G¨odel operation (because α = {x ∈Vα : x is an ordi-
nal}), there exists a G¨odel operation H such that X = H(Vα1, . . . , Vαn, Vβ)
and therefore X ∈OD.
Thus let HOD denote the class of hereditarily ordinal-deﬁnable sets
HOD = {x : TC({x}) ⊂OD}.
The class HOD is transitive and contains all ordinals.

13. Constructible Sets

Theorem 13.26. The class HOD is a transitive model of ZFC.
Proof. The class HOD is transitive, and it is easy to see that it is closed
under G¨odel operations. Thus to show that HOD is a model of ZF, it suﬃces
to show that HOD is almost universal. For that, it is enough to verify that
Vα∩HOD ∈HOD, for all α. For any α, the set Vα∩HOD is a subset of HOD,
and so it is suﬃcient to prove that Vα ∩HOD is ordinal-deﬁnable. This is
indeed true because Vα ∩HOD is the set of all u satisfying the formula
u ∈Vα ∧(∀z ∈TC({u})) ∃β [z ∈cl{Vγ : γ < β}]
and thus Vα ∩HOD ∈OD.
It remains to prove that HOD satisﬁes the Axiom of Choice. We shall show
that for each α there exists a one-to-one function g ∈HOD of Vα ∩HOD into
the ordinals. Since every such function is a subset of HOD, it suﬃces to ﬁnd
g ∈OD.
By Lemma 13.25, there is a deﬁnable one-to-one mapping G of the
class OD onto the ordinals. If we let g be the restriction of G to the or-
dinal-deﬁnable set Vα ∩HOD, then g is ordinal-deﬁnable.
⊓⊔
A set X is ordinal-deﬁnable from A, X ∈OD[A], if there is a formula ϕ
such that
(13.27)
X = {u : ϕ(u, α1, . . . , αn, A)}
for some ordinal numbers α1, . . . , αn.
As above, this notion is expressible in the language of set theory:
(13.28)
OD[A] = cl({Vα : α ∈Ord} ∪{A}).
The class OD[A] has a well-ordering deﬁnable from A and thus every set
in OD[A] is of the form (13.27). Conversely (using the Reﬂection Principle),
every set X in (13.27) belongs to OD[A].
The proof of Theorem 13.26 generalizes easily to the case of HOD[A].
Thus HOD[A], the class of all sets hereditarily ordinal-deﬁnable from A, is
a transitive model of ZFC.
As a further generalization, we call X ordinal-deﬁnable over A, X ∈
OD(A), if it belongs to the G¨odel closure of {Vα : α ∈Ord} ∪{A} ∪A. If
X ∈OD(A), then X ∈cl({Vα : α ∈Ord}∪{A}∪E), where E = {x0, . . . , xk}
is a ﬁnite subset of A. Hence there is a ﬁnite sequence s = ⟨x0, . . . , xk⟩in A
such that X is ordinal-deﬁnable from A and s. On the other hand, if s is
a ﬁnite sequence in A, then obviously s ∈OD(A) and thus we have
OD(A) = {X : X ∈OD[A, s] for some ﬁnite sequence s in A}.
In other words, X ∈OD(A) if and only if there is a formula ϕ such that
X = {u : ϕ(u, α1, . . . , αn, A, ⟨x0, . . . , xk⟩)}
for some ordinal numbers α1, . . . , αn and a ﬁnite sequence ⟨x0, . . . , xk⟩in A.

196
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
The class HOD(A) of all sets hereditarily ordinal-deﬁnable over A is
a transitive model of ZF. To show that HOD(A) is almost universal, it
suﬃces to verify that Vα ∩HOD(A) ∈OD(A). In fact, Vα ∩HOD(A) is
ordinal-deﬁnable from A: It is the set
{u ∈Vα : (∀z ∈TC({u})) z ∈cl({Vβ : β ∈Ord} ∪{A} ∪A)}.
More on Inner Models
We conclude this chapter with some comments on inner models of ZF.
As we remarked earlier, cardinal concepts are generally not absolute. The
following theorem summarizes the relations between some of the concepts
and their relativizations (see also Lemma 13.13):
Theorem 13.27. Let M be an inner model of ZF. Then
(i) P M(X) = P(X) ∩M, V M
α
= Vα ∩M.
(ii) If |X|M = |Y |M then |X| = |Y |.
(iii) If α is a cardinal then α is a cardinal in M; if α is a limit cardinal,
then α is a limit cardinal in M.
(iv) |α| ≤|α|M, cf(α) ≤cfM(α).
(v) If α is a regular cardinal, then α is a regular cardinal in M; if α is
weakly inaccessible, then α is weakly inaccessible in M.
(vi) If M is a model of ZFC and κ is inaccessible, then κ is inaccessible
in M.
⊓⊔
Concerning (vi), if α < κ, then since M ⊨AC, we must have either
(2α)M < κ or (2α)M ≥κ and the latter is impossible since 2α < κ.
If M is a transitive model of ZFC, then the Axiom of Choice in M enables
us to code all sets in M by sets of ordinals and the model is determined by
its sets or ordinals. The precise statement of this fact is: If M and N are
two transitive models of ZFC with the same sets of ordinals, then M = N.
In fact, a slightly stronger assertion is true. (On the other hand, one cannot
prove that M = N if neither model satisﬁes AC.)
Theorem 13.28. Let M and N be transitive models of ZF and assume that
the Axiom of Choice holds in M. If M and N have the same sets of ordinals,
i.e., P M(OrdM) = P N(OrdN), then M = N.
Proof. We start with a rather trivial remark: M and N have the same sets of
pairs of ordinals. To see this, use the absolute canonical one-to-one function
Γ : Ord × Ord →Ord. If X ⊂Ord2 and X ∈M, then Γ(X) is both in M
and in N, and we have X = Γ−1(Γ(X)) ∈N.

13. Constructible Sets
197
First we prove that M ⊂N. Let X ∈M. Since M satisﬁes AC, there is
a one-to-one mapping f ∈M of some ordinal θ onto TC({X}). Let E ∈M
be the following relation on θ:
α E β
if and only if
f(α) ∈f(β).
E is a set of pairs of ordinals and thus we have E ∈N. In M, E is well-founded
and extensional. However, these properties are absolute and so E is well-
founded and extensional in N. Applying the Collapsing Theorem (in N), we
get a transitive set T ∈N such that (T, ∈) is isomorphic to (θ, E). Hence T is
isomorphic to TC({X}) and since both are transitive, we have T = TC({X}).
It follows that TC({X}) ∈N and so X ∈N.
Now we prove M = N by ∈-induction. Let X ∈N and assume that
X ⊂M; we prove that X ∈M. Let Y ∈M be such that X ⊂Y (for instance
let Y = V M
α
where α = rank(X); the rank function is absolute). Let f ∈M
be a one-to-one function of Y into the ordinals. Since M ⊂N, f is in N and
so f(X) ∈N. Since M ⊂N, f is in N and so f(X) ∈N. However, f(X) is
a set of ordinals and so f(X) ∈M, and we have X = f−1(f(X)) ∈M.

Historical Notes
The main results, namely consistency of the Axiom of Choice and the General-
ized Continuum Hypothesis, are due to Kurt G¨odel, as is the concept of con-
structible sets. The results were announced in [1938], and an outline of proof ap-
peared in [1939]. G¨odel’s monograph [1940] contains a detailed construction of L,
and the proof that L satisﬁes AC and GCH.

200
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
In [1939] G¨odel deﬁned constructible sets using Lα+1 = the set of all subsets
of Lα deﬁnable over Lα; in [1940] he used ﬁnitely many operations (and worked in
the system BG).
The investigation of transitive models of set theory was of course motivated by
G¨odel’s construction of the model L. The ﬁrst systematic study of transitive models
was done by Shepherdson in [1951, 1952, 1953]. Bernays in [1937], employed a ﬁnite
number of operations on classes to give a ﬁnite axiomatization of BG. Theorem 13.9
is explicitly stated by Hajnal in [1956].
The Σn hierarchy was introduced by L´evy in [1965a]. Another result of L´evy
[1965b] is that the truth predicate ⊨n+1 is Σn+1
Karp’s paper [1967] investigates Σ1 relations and gives a detailed computation
verifying that constructibility is Σ1. The characterization of the sets Lα as transitive
models of a single sentence σ is a result of Boolos [1970].
The Diamond Principle was introduced by Jensen in [1972].
Relative constructibility was investigated by Hajnal [1956], Shoenﬁeld [1959]
and most generally by L´evy [1957] and [1960a].
The concept of ordinal deﬁnability was suggested by G¨odel in his talk in 1946,
cf. [1965]; the theory was developed independently by Myhill and Scott in [1971]
and by Vopˇenka, Balcar, and H´ajek in [1968].
Theorem 13.28 is due to Vopˇenka and Balcar [1967].

14. Forcing
The method of forcing was introduced by Paul Cohen in his proof of inde-
pendence of the Continuum Hypothesis and of the Axiom of Choice. Forcing
proved to be a remarkably general technique for producing a large number
of models and consistency results.
The main idea of forcing is to extend a transitive model M of set theory
(the ground model) by adjoining a new set G (a generic set) in order to obtain
a larger transitive model of set theory M[G] called a generic extension. The
generic set is approximated by forcing conditions in the ground model, and
a judicious choice of forcing conditions determines what is true in the generic
extension.
Cohen’s original approach was to start with a countable transitive model M
of ZFC (and a particular set of forcing conditions in M). A generic set can eas-
ily be proved to exist, and the main result was to show that M[G] is a model
of ZFC, and moreover, that the Continuum Hypothesis fails in M[G].
A minor diﬃculty with this approach is that a countable transitive model
need not exist. Its existence is unprovable, by G¨odel’s Second Incompleteness
Theorem. The modern approach to forcing is to let the ground model be the
universe V , and pretend that V has a generic extension, i.e., to postulate
the existence of a generic set G, for the given set of forcing conditions. As
the properties of the generic extension can be described entirely withing the
ground model, statements about V [G] can be understood as statements in
the ground model using the language of forcing. We shall elaborate on this
in due course.
Forcing Conditions and Generic Sets
Let M be a transitive model of ZFC, the ground model. In M, let us consider
a nonempty partially ordered set (P, <). We call (P, <) a notion of forcing
and the elements of P forcing conditions. We say that p is stronger than q if
p < q. If p and q are conditions and there exists r such that both r ≤p and
r ≤q, then p and q are compatible; otherwise they are incompatible. A set
W ⊂P is an antichain if its elements are pairwise incompatible. A set D ⊂P
is dense in P if for every p ∈P there is q ∈D such that q ≤p.

202
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Deﬁnition 14.1. A set F ⊂P is a ﬁlter on P if
(i) F is nonempty;
(ii) if p ≤q and p ∈F, then q ∈F;
(iii) if p, q ∈F, then there exists r ∈F such that r ≤p and r ≤q.
(14.1)
A set of conditions G ⊂P is generic over M if
(i) G is a ﬁlter on P;
(ii) if D is dense in P and D ∈M, then G ∩D ̸= ∅.
(14.2)
We also say that G is M-generic, or P-generic (over M), or just generic.
Note how genericity depends on the ground model M: What matters is
which dense subsets of P are in M. Thus if D is any collection of sets, let us
say that a set G ⊂P is a D-generic ﬁlter on P if it is a ﬁlter and if G∩D ̸= ∅
for every dense subset of P that is in D. Then G is generic over M just in
case it is D-generic where D is the collection of all D ∈M dense in P.
Genericity can be described in several equivalent ways. A set D ⊂P is
open dense if it is dense and in addition, p ∈D and q ≤p imply q ∈D; D is
predense if every p ∈P is compatible with some q ∈D. If p ∈P, then D is
dense (open dense, predense, an antichain) below p if it is dense (open dense,
predense, an antichain) in the set {q ∈P : q ≤p}.
If D is either dense or a maximal antichain then D is predense. In Deﬁni-
tion 14.1, “dense” in (14.2)(ii) can be replaced by “open dense,” “predense,”
or “a maximal antichain”—see Exercises 14.3, 14.4, and 14.5.
Example 14.2. Let P be the following notion of forcing: The elements of P
are ﬁnite 0–1 sequences ⟨p(0), . . . , p(n −1)⟩and a condition p is stronger
than q (p < q) if p extends q. Clearly, p and q are compatible if either p ⊂q
or q ⊂p. Let M be the ground model (note that (P, <) ∈M), and let G ⊂P
be generic over M. Let f =  G. Since G is a ﬁlter, f is a function. For every
n ∈ω, the sets Dn = {p ∈P : n ∈dom(p)} is dense in P, hence it meets G,
and so dom(f) = ω.
The 0–1 function f is the characteristic function of a set A ⊂ω. We claim
that the function f (or the set A) is not in the ground model. For every
0–1 function g in M, let Dg = {p ∈P : p ̸⊂g}. The set Dg is dense, hence it
meets G, and it follows that f ̸= g.
⊓⊔
This example describes the simplest way of adjoining a new set of natural
numbers to the ground model. A set A ⊂ω obtained this way is called
a Cohen generic real.
Except in trivial cases, a generic set does not belong to the ground model;
see Exercise 14.6.
Example 14.3. In the ground model M, consider the following partially
ordered set P. The elements of P are ﬁnite sequences p = ⟨α0, . . . , αn−1⟩of

14. Forcing
203
countable ordinals (in M), and a condition p is stronger than a condition q
(p < q) if p extends q. Now if G ⊂P is generic over M, we let f =  G. As
in Example 14.2, f is a function on ω, and since for every α < ωM
1 , the set
Eα = {p ∈P : α ∈ran(p)} is dense, it follows that ran(f) = ωM
1 . Thus in
any model N ⊃M that contains G, the ordinal ωM
1
is countable.
⊓⊔
This example describes the simplest way of collapsing a cardinal.
As these examples suggest, a generic set over a transitive model need not
exist in general. However, if the ground model is countable, then generic sets
do exist. If M is countable and (P, <) ∈M, then the collection D of all
D ∈M that are dense in P is countable and the following lemma applies:
Lemma 14.4. If (P, <) is a partially ordered set and D is a countable col-
lection of dense subsets of P, then there exists a D-generic ﬁlter on P. In
fact, for every p ∈P there exists a D-generic ﬁlter G on P such that p ∈G.
Proof. Let D1, D2, . . . be the sets in D. Let p0 = p, and for each n, let pn
be such that pn ≤pn−1 and pn ∈Dn. The set
G = {q ∈P : q ≥pn for some n ∈N}
is a D-generic ﬁlter on P and p ∈G.
⊓⊔
We shall now state the ﬁrst of the three main theorems on generic models.
We shall prove these theorems (14.5, 14.6, 14.7) later in this chapter.
Theorem 14.5 (The Generic Model Theorem). Let M be a transitive
model of ZFC and let (P, <) be a notion of forcing in M. If G ⊂P is generic
over P, then there exists a transitive model M[G] such that:
(i) M[G] is a model of ZFC;
(ii) M ⊂M[G] and G ∈M[G];
(iii) OrdM[G] = OrdM;
(iv) if N is a transitive model of ZF such that M ⊂N and G ∈N, then
M[G] ⊂N.
The model M[G] is called a generic extension of M. The sets in M[G]
will be deﬁnable from G and ﬁnitely many elements of M. Each element
of M[G] will have a name in M describing how it has been constructed. An
important feature of forcing is that the generic model M[G] can be described
within the ground model. Associated with the notion of forcing (P, <) is
a forcing language. This forcing language as well as the forcing relation ⊩
are deﬁned in the ground model M. The forcing language contains a name
for every element of M[G], including a constant ˙G, the name for a generic
set (it is customary to denote names by dotted letters ˙a). Once we select
a generic set G, then every constant of the forcing language is interpreted as
an element of the model M[G].

204
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
The forcing relation is a relation between the forcing conditions and sen-
tences of the forcing language:
p ⊩σ
(p forces σ). The forcing relation, which is deﬁned in M, is a generalization
of the notion of satisfaction. For instance, if p ⊩σ and if σ′ is a logical
consequence of σ, then p ⊩σ′.
The second main theorem on generic models establishes the relation be-
tween forcing and truth in M[G]:
Theorem 14.6 (The Forcing Theorem). Let (P, <) be a notion of forcing
in the ground model M. If σ is a sentence of the forcing language, then for
every G ⊂P generic over M,
(14.3)
M[G] ⊨σ
if and only if
(∃p ∈G) p ⊩σ.
[In the left-hand-side σ one interprets the constants of the forcing language
according to G.]
The third main theorem lists the most important properties of the forcing
relation.
Theorem 14.7 (Properties of Forcing). Let (P, <) be a notion of forcing
in the ground model M, and let M P be the class (in M) of all names.
(i) (a) If p forces ϕ and q ≤p, then q ⊩ϕ.
(b) No p forces both ϕ and ¬ϕ.

Separative Quotients and Complete Boolean Algebras
While the forcing relation can be deﬁned directly from the partial order-
ing (P, <), it turns out that its properties, and the properties of the generic
extension are determined by a certain complete Boolean algebra that can
be associated with (P, <). We shall therefore introduce the Boolean alge-
bra B(P) and then use it to deﬁne the class M P (the P-names) and the
forcing relation ⊩.
Deﬁnition 14.8. A partially ordered set (P, <) is separative if for all
p, q ∈P,
(14.4)
if p ≰q then there exists an r ≤p that is incompatible with q.

14. Forcing
205
The forcing notions in Examples 14.2 and 14.3 are separative. On the other
hand, a linear ordering is not separative (if it has more than one element).
Another example of a nonseparative partial order is the set of all inﬁnite
subsets of ω, ordered by inclusion.
If B is a Boolean algebra, then (B+, <) is a separative partial order.
A more general statement is true. A set D ⊂P is dense in a partially ordered
set (P, <) if for every p ∈P there is a d ∈D such that d ≤p. A set D ⊂B+
is dense in a Boolean algebra B if it is dense in (B+, <). The following lemma
is easy to verify:
Lemma 14.9. If D is a dense subset of a Boolean algebra B, then (D, <) is
a separative partial order.
⊓⊔
Conversely, every separative partial order can be embedded densely in
a complete Boolean algebra:
Theorem 14.10. Let (P, <) be a separative partially ordered set. Then there
is a complete algebra B such that:
(i) P ⊂B+ and < agrees with the partial ordering of B.
(ii) P is dense in B.
The algebra B is unique up to isomorphism.
Proof. The proof is exactly the same as the proof of Theorem 7.13. B is the
set of all regular cuts in P and separativity implies that every Up (where
p ∈P) is regular.
⊓⊔
When (P, <) is not separative, we can replace it by a separative partial
order that will produce the same generic extension. This is the consequence
of the following lemma:
Lemma 14.11. Let (P, <) be a partially ordered set. There exists a separa-
tive partially ordered set (Q, ≺) and a mapping h of P onto Q such that
(i) x ≤y implies h(x) ≼h(y);
(ii) x and y are compatible in P if and only if h(x) and h(y) are
compatible in Q.
(14.5)
Proof. Let us deﬁne the following equivalence relation on P:
x ∼y
if and only if
∀z (z is compatible with x ↔z is compatible with y).
Let Q = P/∼and let us deﬁne
[x] ≼[y] ↔(∀z ≤x)[z and y are compatible].
The relation ≼on Q is a partial ordering, and it is easy to verify that (Q, ≺) is
separative. The mapping h(x) = [x] satisﬁes (14.5).
⊓⊔

206
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
The partial order (Q, ≺) is called the separative quotient of (P, <) and is
unique (up to isomorphism); see Exercise 14.9.
Corollary 14.12. For every partially ordered set (P, <) there is a complete
Boolean algebra B = B(P) and a mapping e : P →B+ such that:
(i) if p ≤q then e(p) ≤e(q);
(ii) p and q are compatible if and only if e(p) · e(q) ̸= 0;
(iii) {e(p) : p ∈P} is dense in B.
(14.6)
B is unique up to isomorphism.
⊓⊔
Our earlier statements about the generic extension being determined
by B(P) are based on the following facts:
Lemma 14.13. (i) In the ground model M, let Q be the separative quotient
of P and let h map P onto Q such that (14.5) holds. If G ⊂P is generic
over M then h(G) ⊂Q is generic over M. Conversely, if H ⊂Q is generic
over M then h−1(H) ⊂P is generic over M.
(ii) In the ground model M, let P be a dense subset of a partially ordered
set Q. If G ⊂Q is generic over M then G ∩P ⊂P is generic over M.
Conversely, if H ⊂P is generic over M then G = {q ∈Q : (∃p ∈G) p ≤q}
is generic over M.
Proof. The proof is an exercise in verifying deﬁnitions (Exercise 14.1 is useful
here).
⊓⊔
As a consequence, if e : P →B(P) is as in Corollary 14.12 then G ⊂P
and H = {u ∈B : ∃p ∈G e(p) ≤u} are deﬁnable from each other, and G is
generic if and only if H is, and M[G] = M[H]. Thus P and B(P) produce
the same generic extension.
In the ground model M, let B be a complete Boolean algebra. Outside M,
B is still a Boolean algebra, though not necessarily complete. An ultraﬁlter G
on B is called generic (over M) if
(14.7)
 X ∈G whenever X ∈M and X ⊂G.
A routine veriﬁcation (see Exercise 14.10) shows that G is a generic ultraﬁlter
if and only if G is a generic ﬁlter on B+.
Boolean-Valued Models
Let B be a complete Boolean algebra. A Boolean-valued model (of the lan-
guage of set theory) A consists of a Boolean universe A and functions of two
variables with values in B,
(14.8)
∥x = y∥,
∥x ∈y∥

14. Forcing
207
(the Boolean values of = and ∈), that satisfy the following:
(i) ∥x = x∥= 1,
(ii) ∥x = y∥= ∥y = x∥,
(iii) ∥x = y∥· ∥y = z∥≤∥x = z∥,
(iv) ∥x ∈y∥· ∥v = x∥· ∥w = y∥≤∥v ∈w∥.
(14.9)
For every formula ϕ(x1, . . . , xn), we deﬁne the Boolean value of ϕ
∥ϕ(a1, . . . , an)∥
(a1, . . . , an ∈A)
as follows:
(a) For atomic formulas, we have (14.8).
(b) If ϕ is a negation, conjunction, etc.,
∥¬ψ(a1, . . . , an)∥= −∥ψ(a1, . . . , an)∥,
∥(ψ ∧χ)(a1, . . . , an)∥= ∥ψ(a1, . . . , an)∥· ∥χ(a1, . . . , an)∥,
∥(ψ ∨χ)(a1, . . . , an)∥= ∥ψ(a1, . . . , an)∥+ ∥χ(a1, . . . , an)∥,
∥(ψ →χ)(a1, . . . , an)∥= ∥(¬ψ ∨χ)(a1, . . . , an)∥,
∥(ψ ↔χ)(a1, . . . , an)∥= ∥((ψ →χ) ∧(χ →ψ))(a1, . . . , an)∥.
(c) If ϕ is ∃x ψ or ∀x ψ,
∥∃x ψ(x, a1, . . . , an)∥= 
a∈A
∥ψ(a, a1, . . . , an)∥,
∥∀x ψ(x, a1, . . . , an)∥= 
a∈A
∥ψ(a, a1, . . . , an)∥.
Note how the notion of a Boolean-valued model generalizes the notion of
a model; the Boolean value of ϕ is a generalization of the satisfaction pred-
icate ⊨. If B is the trivial algebra {0, 1}, then a Boolean-valued model is
just a (two-valued) model; i.e., consider A/≡where x ≡y if and only if
∥x = y∥= 1.
We say that ϕ(a1, . . . , an) is valid in A, if ∥ϕ(a1, . . . , an)∥= 1. An im-
plication ϕ →ψ is valid if ∥ϕ∥≤∥ψ∥. Hence it is postulated in (14.9)
that the axioms for the equality predicate = are valid in a Boolean-valued
model. It can be easily veriﬁed that all the other axioms of predicate calculus
are valid, and that the rules of inference applied to valid sentences result
in valid sentences. Thus every sentence provable in predicate calculus has
Boolean value 1, and if two formulas ϕ, ψ are provably equivalent, we have
∥ϕ∥= ∥ψ∥. For example, we have
∥x = y∥· ∥ϕ(x)∥≤∥ϕ(y)∥.
Boolean-valued models can therefore be used in consistency proofs in much
the same way as two-valued models. Let A be a Boolean-valued model such

208
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
that all the axioms of ZFC are valid in A. (We say that A is a Boolean-
valued model of ZFC.) Let σ be a set-theoretical statement and assume that
∥σ∦= 0. Then we can conclude that σ is consistent relative to ZFC; otherwise,
¬σ would be provable in ZFC and therefore valid in A: ∥¬σ∥= −∥σ∥= 1.
There is an important special case of Boolean-valued models, and in this
special case, the Boolean-valued model can be transformed into a two-valued
model.
We say that a Boolean-valued model A is full if for any formula ϕ(x, x1,
. . . , xn) the following holds: For all a1, . . . , an ∈A, there exists an a ∈A such
that
(14.10)
∥ϕ(a, a1, . . . , an)∥= ∥∃x ϕ(x, a1, . . . , an)∥.
Let F be an ultraﬁlter on B. We deﬁne an equivalence relation on A by
(14.11)
x ≡y
if and only if
∥x = y∥∈F,
and a binary relation E on A/≡by
(14.12)
[x] E [y]
if and only if
∥x ∈y∥∈F.
That ≡is an equivalence relation, and that (14.12) does not depend on the
choice of representatives are easy consequences of (14.9) and the fact that F is
a ﬁlter. Thus A/F = (A/≡, E) is a model. Moreover, we have the following
relationship between the Boolean-valued model A and the model A/F:
Lemma 14.14. Let A be full. For any formula ϕ(x1, . . . , xn),
(14.13)
A/F ⊨ϕ([a1], . . . , [an])
if and only if
∥ϕ(a1, . . . , an)∥∈F,
for all a1, . . . , an ∈A.
Proof. (a) If ϕ is atomic, then (14.13) is true by deﬁnition.
(b) If ϕ is a negation, conjunction, etc., we use the basic properties of an
ultraﬁlter, and the deﬁnition of ∥∥; e.g., we use
∥¬ψ∥∈F
if and only if
∥ψ∥/∈F,
∥ψ ∧χ∥∈F
if and only if
∥ψ∥∈F and ∥χ∥∈F.
(c) If ϕ is ∃x ψ(x, . . .), we use the fullness of A to prove (14.13), assuming
it holds for ψ. By (14.10), we pick some a ∈A such that ∥ϕ(a, . . .)∥=
∥∃x ϕ(x, . . .)∥and then we have
∥∃x ϕ(x, . . .)∥∈F
if and only if
(∃a ∈A) ∥ϕ(a, . . .)∥∈F,
which enables us to do the induction step in this case.

The Boolean-Valued Model V B
We now deﬁne the Boolean-valued model V B. Let B be a complete Boolean
algebra.
Our intention is to deﬁne a Boolean-valued model in which all the axioms
of ZFC are valid. In particular, we want V B to be extensional, i.e., the Axiom
of Extensionality to be valid in V B:
(14.14)
∥∀u (u ∈X ↔u ∈Y )∥≤∥X = Y ∥.
We shall deﬁne V B as a generalization of V : Instead of (two-valued) sets, we
consider “Boolean-valued” sets, i.e., functions that assign Boolean values to
its “elements.” Thus we deﬁne V B as follows:
(i) V B
0 = ∅,
(ii) V B
α+1 = the set of all functions x with dom(x) ⊂V B
α and values
in B,
V B
α = 
β<α
V B
β
if α is a limit ordinal, and
(iii) V B =

α∈Ord
V B
α .
(14.15)
The deﬁnition of ∥x ∈y∥and ∥x = y∥is motivated by (14.14), and the
requirement that x(t) ≤∥t ∈x∥. We deﬁne Boolean values by induction.
Each x ∈V B is assigned the rank in V B,
ρ(x) = the least α such that x ∈V B
α+1.
The forthcoming deﬁnition is by induction on pairs (ρ(x), ρ(y)), under the
canonical well-ordering.
To make the notation more suggestive, we introduce the following Boolean
operation that corresponds to the implication:
u ⇒v = −u + v
Let
(i) ∥x ∈y∥=

t∈dom y
(∥x = t∥· y(t)),
(ii) ∥x ⊂y∥=

t∈dom x
(x(t) ⇒∥t ∈y∥), and
(iii) ∥x = y∥= ∥x ⊂y∥· ∥y ⊂x∥.
(14.16)
We are going to show that V B is a Boolean-valued model. To do that, we have
to verify (14.9). Clause (ii) in (14.9) is trivially satisﬁed since the deﬁnition
of ∥x = y∥is symmetric in x and y.
Lemma 14.15. ∥x = x∥= 1 for all x ∈V B.

210
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Proof. By induction on ρ(x). Clearly, it suﬃces to show that ∥x ⊂x∥= 1, i.e.,
we wish to show that x(t) ⇒∥t ∈x∥= 1 for all t ∈dom(x), or equivalently,
that x(t) ≤∥t ∈x∥. If t ∈dom(x), then by the induction hypothesis we have
∥t = t∥= 1 and hence, by deﬁnition of ∥t ∈x∥, x(t) = ∥t = t∥·x(t) ≤∥t ∈x∥.
⊓⊔
Now we prove (14.9)(iii) and (iv), simultaneously by induction:
Lemma 14.16. For all x, y, z ∈V B,
(i) ∥x = y∥· ∥y = z∥≤∥x = z∥,
(ii) ∥x ∈y∥· ∥x = z∥≤∥z ∈y∥,
(iii) ∥y ∈x∥· ∥x = z∥≤∥y ∈z∥.
Proof. By induction on triples {ρ(x), ρ(y), ρ(z)}.
(i) It suﬃces to prove that ∥x ⊂y∥· ∥y = z∥≤∥x ⊂z∥. Let t ∈dom(x)
be arbitrary; we wish to show that
(14.17)
∥y = z∥· (x(t) ⇒∥t ∈y∥) ≤x(t) ⇒∥t ∈z∥
(using the deﬁnition of ∥x ⊂z∥). By the induction hypothesis, we have
∥t ∈y∥· ∥y = z∥≤∥t ∈z∥. Thus ∥y = z∥· (−x(t) + ∥t ∈y∥) = (∥y =
z∥−x(t)) + (∥y = z∥· ∥t ∈y∥≤−x(t) + ∥t ∈z∥, and (14.17) follows.
(ii) Let t ∈dom(y) be arbitrary. By the induction hypothesis we have
∥x = z∥· ∥x = t∥≤∥z = t∥and so
(14.18)
∥x = z∥· ∥x = t∥· y(t) ≤∥z = t∥· y(t).
Taking the sum of (14.18) over all t ∈dom(y), we get
∥x = z∥·

t∈dom y
(∥x = t∥· y(t)) ≤

t∈dom y
(∥z = t∥· y(t)),
that is, ∥x = z∥· ∥x ∈y∥≤∥z ∈y∥.
(iii) Let t ∈dom(x). By the deﬁnition of ∥x = z∥we have x(t)·∥x = z∥≤
∥t ∈z∥and so
∥y = t∥· x(t) · ∥x = z∥≤∥y = t∥· ∥t ∈z∥.
By the induction hypothesis, ∥y = t∥· ∥t ∈z∥≤∥y ∈z∥, and therefore
(14.19)
∥y = t∥· x(t) · ∥x = z∥≤∥y ∈z∥.
Taking the sum of the left-hand side of (14.19) over all t ∈dom(x), we get

t∈dom x
(∥y = t∥· x(t)) · ∥x = z∥≤∥y ∈z∥,
that is, ∥y ∈x∥· ∥x = z∥≤∥y ∈z∥.
⊓⊔

14. Forcing
211
Thus V B is a Boolean-valued model. We will show that all axioms of ZFC
are valid in V B. First we show that V B is extensional, and full.
Lemma 14.17. V B is extensional.
⊓⊔
Proof. Let X, Y ∈V B. By the deﬁnition of a ⇒b we observe that if a ≤a′,
then (a′ ⇒b) ≤(a ⇒b). Thus for any u ∈V B we have (∥u ∈X∥⇒∥u ∈
Y ∥) ≤(X(u) ⇒∥u ∈Y ∥) and therefore
(14.20)

u∈V B(∥u ∈X∥⇒∥u ∈Y ∥) ≤

u∈V B(X(u) ⇒∥u ∈Y ∥).
While the left-hand side of (14.20) is equal to ∥∀u (u ∈X →u ∈Y )∥, the
right-hand side is easily seen to equal ∥X ⊂Y ∥. Consequently,
∥∀u (u ∈X ↔u ∈Y )∥≤∥X = Y ∥.
⊓⊔
Lemma 14.18. If W is a set of pairwise disjoint elements of B and if au,
u ∈W, are elements of V B, then there exists some a ∈V B such that u ≤
∥a = au∥for all u ∈W.
Proof. Let D = 
u∈W dom(au), and for every t ∈D, let a(t) = {u · au(t) :
u ∈W}. Since the u’s are pairwise disjoint, we have u · a(t) = u · au(t)
for each u ∈W and each t ∈D. In other words, u ≤(a(t) ⇒au(t)) and
u ≤(au(t) ⇒a(t)), and so u ≤∥a = au∥.
⊓⊔
Lemma 14.19. V B is full. Given a formula ϕ(x, . . .), there exists some a ∈
V B such that (14.10) holds, i.e.,
∥ϕ(a, . . .)∥= ∥∃x ϕ(x, . . .)∥.
Proof. In (14.10), ≤holds for every a. We wish to ﬁnd an a ∈V B such that
≥holds. Let u0 = ∥∃x ϕ(x, . . .)∥. Let
D = {u ∈B : there is some au such that u ≤∥ϕ(au, . . .)∥}.
It is clear that D is open and dense below u0. Let W be a maximal set of
pairwise disjoint elements of D; clearly, {u : u ∈W} ≥u0. By Lemma 14.18
there exists some a ∈V B such that u ≤∥a = au∥for all u ∈W. Thus for
each u ∈W we have u ≤∥ϕ(a, . . .)∥, and hence u0 ≤∥ϕ(a, . . .)∥.
⊓⊔
We remark that Lemma 14.19 was the only place in this chapter where
we used the Axiom of Choice.
Every set (in V ) has a canonical name in the Boolean-valued model V B:

(ii) for every x ∈V , let ˇx ∈V B be the function whose domain is the set
{ˇy : y ∈x}, and for all y ∈x, ˇx(ˇy) = 1.
When calculating the Boolean value of a formula, one may ﬁnd the fol-
lowing observation helpful (cf. Exercise 14.12):
(14.21)
∥(∃y ∈x) ϕ(y)∥=

y∈dom x
(x(y) · ∥ϕ(y)∥),
∥(∀y ∈x) ϕ(y)∥=

y∈dom x
(x(y) ⇒∥ϕ(y)∥).
The following lemma is the Boolean-valued version of absoluteness of
∆0 formulas:
Lemma 14.21. If ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) is a ∆0 formula, then
ϕ(x1, . . . , xn)
if and only if
∥ϕ(ˇx1, . . . , ˇxn)∥= 1.
Proof. By induction on the complexity of ϕ.
⊓⊔
Corollary 14.22. If ϕ is Σ1, then ϕ(x, . . .) implies ∥ϕ(ˇx, . . .)∥= 1.
⊓⊔
The next lemma states that V and V B “have the same ordinals:”
Lemma 14.23. For every x ∈V B,
∥x is an ordinal∥=

α∈Ord
∥x = ˇα∥.
Proof. Since “x is an ordinal” is ∆0, we have, by Lemma 14.21,

α∈Ord
∥x = ˇα∥≤∥x is an ordinal∥.
On the other hand, let ∥x is an ordinal∥= u. We ﬁrst observe that if γ is an
ordinal, then
∥x is an ordinal and x ∈ˇγ∥≤
α∈γ
∥x = ˇα∥.
Also, for every α, we have
u ≤∥x ∈ˇα∥+ ∥x = ˇα∥+ ∥ˇα ∈x∥.
However, there is only a set of α’s such that ∥ˇα ∈x∦= 0 (because ∥ˇα ∈x∥=

t∈dom x(∥ˇα = t∥· x(t))). Hence there is γ such that u ≤∥x ⊂ˇγ∥and we
have u ≤
α≤γ ∥x = ˇα∥.
⊓⊔
We show now that V B is a Boolean-valued model of ZFC.
Theorem 14.24. Every axiom of ZFC is valid in V B.
Proof. We show that ∥σ∥= 1 for every axiom of ZFC.

Extensionality. See Lemma 14.17.
Pairing. Given a, b ∈V B, let c = {a, b}B ∈V B be such that dom(c) = {a, b}
and c(a) = c(b) = 1. Then ∥a ∈c ∧b ∈c∥= 1. This, combined with
Separation, suﬃces for the Pairing Axiom. (We could also verify directly
that ∥∀x ∈c (x = a ∨x = b)∥= 1.)
Separation. We prove that for every X ∈V B there is Y ∈V B such that
(14.22)
∥Y ⊂X∥= 1
and
∥(∀z ∈X)(ϕ(z) ↔z ∈Y )∥= 1.
Let Y ∈V B be as follows:
dom(Y ) = dom(X),
Y (t) = X(t) · ∥ϕ(t)∥.
For every x ∈V B we have ∥x ∈Y ∥= ∥x ∈X∥·∥ϕ(x)∥and this gives (14.22).
Union. We prove that for every X ∈V B there is Y ∈V B such that
(14.23)
∥(∀u ∈X)(∀v ∈u)(v ∈Y )∥= 1
(this is the weak version, cf. (1.8)).
If X ∈V B, then letting Y ∈V B as follows veriﬁes (14.23):
dom(Y ) = {dom(u) : u ∈dom(X)},
Y (t) = 1
for all t ∈dom(Y ).
Power Set. We prove that for every X ∈V B there is Y ∈V B such that
(14.24)
∥∀u (u ⊂X →u ∈Y )∥= 1;
(cf. (1.9)). Here we let
dom(Y ) = {u ∈V B : dom(u) = dom(X) and u(t) ≤X(t) for all t},
Y (u) = 1
for all u ∈dom(Y ).
To verify that Y satisﬁes (14.24) we use the following observation: If u ∈V B
is arbitrary, let u′ ∈V B be such that dom(u′) = dom(X) and u′(t) = X(t) ·
∥t ∈u∥for all t ∈dom(X). Then
∥u ⊂X∥≤∥u = u′∥
which makes it possible to include in dom(Y ) only the “representative” u’s.
Inﬁnity. See Lemma 14.21 for ∥ˇω is an inductive set∥= 1.
Replacement. It suﬃces to verify the Collection Principle, cf. (6.5); we prove
that for every X ∈V B there is Y ∈V B such that
(14.25)
∥(∀u ∈X)(∃v ϕ(u, v) →(∃v ∈Y ) ϕ(u, v))∥= 1.
Here we let
dom(Y ) = {Su : u ∈dom(X)},
Y (t) = 1
for all t ∈dom(Y ),
where Su ⊂V B is some set such that

v∈V B ∥ϕ(u, v)∥= 
v∈Su
∥ϕ(u, v)∥.

Regularity. We prove that for every X ∈V B,
(14.26)
∥X is nonempty →(∃y ∈X)(∀z ∈y) z /∈X∥= 1.
If (14.26) is false, then
∥∃u (u ∈X) ∧(∀y ∈X)(∃z ∈y) z ∈X∥= b ̸= 0.
Let y ∈V B be of least ρ(y) such that ∥y ∈X∥· b ̸= 0. Then ∥y ∈X∥· b ≤
∥(∃z ∈y) z ∈X∥, so there exists a z ∈dom(y) such that ∥z ∈X∥· ∥y ∈X∥·
b ̸= 0. Since ρ(z) < ρ(y), this is a contradiction.
Choice. For every S, we have (by Corollary 14.22)
∥ˇS can be well-ordered∥= 1.
Now, we prove that for every X ∈V B there exist some S and f ∈V B such
that
(14.27)
∥f is a function on ˇS and ran(f) ⊃X∥= 1.
(This shows that ∥X can be well-ordered∥= 1.)
We let S = dom(X) and f ∈V B as follows:
dom(f) = {(ˇx, x)B : x ∈S},
f(t) = 1
for all t ∈dom(f)
(where (a, b)B = {{a}B, {a, b}B}B). These S and f satisfy (14.27).
⊓⊔
Among elements of V B, one is of particular signiﬁcance: the canonical
name for a generic ultraﬁlter on B:
Deﬁnition 14.25. The canonical name
˙G for a generic ultraﬁlter is the
Boolean-valued function deﬁned by
dom( ˙G) = {ˇu : u ∈B},
˙G(ˇu) = u
for every u ∈B.
See Exercise 14.14.
The Forcing Relation
Let M be a transitive model of ZFC (the ground model) and let (P, <) ∈M be
a notion of forcing. We shall now introduce the forcing language by specifying
names, deﬁne the forcing relation ⊩and prove the fundamental properties
of ⊩(Theorem 14.7). Throughout this section we work inside the ground
model.
Let (P, <) be a notion of forcing. By Corollary 14.12 there exists a com-
plete Boolean algebra B = B(P) such that P embeds in B by a mapping
e : P →B that satisﬁes (14.6) (and is not one-to-one if P is not separative).
We use M B to denote the B-valued model deﬁned in (14.15) (inside M).

14. Forcing
215
Deﬁnition 14.26. M P = M B(P ). The elements of M P are called P-names
(or just names). P-names are usually denoted by dotted letters. The forcing
language is the language of set theory with names added as constants. The
forcing relation ⊩P (or just ⊩) is deﬁned by
p ⊩ϕ(˙a1, . . . , ˙an)
if and only if
e(p) ≤∥ϕ(˙a1, . . . , ˙an)∥
where ϕ is a formula of set theory and ˙a1, . . . , ˙an are names.
We remark that both names and the forcing relation can be deﬁned di-
rectly from P without using the complete Boolean algebra. However, we ﬁnd
the direct deﬁnition somewhat less intuitive.
Proof of Theorem 14.7.
(i) (a) If q ≤p then e(q) ≤e(p).
(b) ∥ϕ∥· ∥¬ϕ∥= 0.
(c) If e(p) · ∥ϕ∦= 0 then there is a q ≤p such that e(q) ≤∥ϕ∥;
similarly if e(p) · ∥¬ϕ∦= 0.
(ii) (a) Left-to-right: Use (i)(a) and (b). Right-to-left: If p does not
force ¬ϕ then e(p) · ∥ϕ∦= 0 and proceed as in (i)(c).
(b) By (14.9)(b) and (c).
(c) For disjunction, we use ∥ϕ∨ψ∥= ∥ϕ∥+∥ψ∥and argue as in (ii)(a).
The existential quantiﬁer is similar, using (14.9)(c).
(iii) By Lemma 14.19, M B is full and so e(p) ≤∥ϕ(˙a)∥for some ˙a.
⊓⊔
Among P-names there are canonical names ˇx for sets in the ground model.
In practice one often abuses the notation by dropping the h´aˇcek ˇ and con-
fusing x ∈M with its name ˇx.
We can also introduce a “name for M;” since a ∈M ↔(∃x ∈M) a = x,
we deﬁne
(14.28)
p ⊩˙a ∈ˇ
M
if and only if
∀q ≤p ∃r ≤q ∃x (r ⊩˙a = ˇx).
Finally, we consider the canonical name for a generic ﬁlter on P. Using Deﬁni-
tion 14.25 for B(P) and the relation between generic ﬁlters on P and generic
ultraﬁlters on B(P) spelled out in Lemma 14.13, we arrive at the following
deﬁnition:
(14.29)
p ⊩q ∈˙G
if and only if
∀r ≤p ∃s ≤r s ≤q,
or in terms of the separative quotient mapping h (Lemma 14.11),
p ⊩q ∈˙G
if and only if
h(p) ≼h(q).
One ﬁnal remark: By Theorem 14.24, every axiom of ZFC is forced by every
condition. So is every axiom of predicate calculus, and the forcing relation
is preserved by the rules of inference. Hence every condition forces every
sentence provable in ZFC.

The Forcing Theorem and the Generic Model Theorem
We shall now deﬁne the generic extension M[G] and prove Theorems 14.5
and 14.6. We do it ﬁrst for Boolean-valued models and handle the general
case afterward.
Let M be a generic transitive model of ZFC, and let B be a complete
Boolean algebra in M. Let G be an M-generic ultraﬁlter on B, i.e., generic
over M.
Deﬁnition 14.27 (Interpretation by G). For every x ∈M B we deﬁne xG
by induction on ρ(x):
(i) ∅G = ∅,
(ii) xG = {yG : x(y) ∈G}.
Using the interpretation by G, we let
(14.30)
M[G] = {xG : x ∈M B}.
Lemma 14.28. Let G be an M-generic ultraﬁlter on B. Then for all names
x, y ∈M B
(i) xG ∈yG if and only if ∥x ∈y∥∈G,
(ii) xG = yG if and only if ∥x = y∥∈G.
Proof. We prove (i) and (ii) simultaneously, by induction on pairs (ρ(x), ρ(y)).
(i) ∥x ∈y∥∈G ↔∃t ∈dom(y) (y(t) ∈G and ∥x = t∥∈G)
↔∃t (y(t) ∈G and xG = tG)
↔xG ∈{tG : y(t) ∈G}
↔xG ∈yG.
(ii) ∥x ⊂y∥∈G ↔
t∈dom x(x(t) ⇒∥t ∈y∥) ∈G
↔∀t ∈dom(x) (x(t) ∈G implies ∥t ∈y∥∈G)
↔∀t (x(t) ∈G implies tG ∈yG)
↔{tG : x(t) ∈G} ⊂yG
↔xG ⊂yG.
⊓⊔
M[G] is a transitive class. The following is the Forcing Theorem for
Boolean-valued models.
Theorem 14.29. If G is an M-generic ultraﬁlter on B, then for all x1, . . . ,
xn ∈M B,
(14.31)
M[G] ⊨ϕ(xG
1 , . . . , xG
n )
if and only if
∥ϕ(x1, . . . , xn)∥∈G.

14. Forcing
217
Proof. Lemma 14.28 proves (14.31) for atomic formulas. The rest of the proof
is by induction on the complexity of ϕ.
(a) ϕ is ¬ψ, ψ∧χ, ψ∨χ, etc. Assuming (14.31) for ψ and χ, the induction
step works because G is an ultraﬁlter. For instance,
M[G] ⊨ψ ∧χ ↔M[G] ⊨ψ and M[G] ⊨χ
↔∥ψ∥∈G and ∥χ∥∈G
↔∥ψ∥· ∥χ∥∈G
↔∥ψ ∧χ∥∈G.
Similarly for ¬, ∨, etc.
(b) ϕ is ∃x ψ(x, . . .) or ∀x ψ(x, . . .). We assume (14.31) for ψ and use the
genericity of G:
M[G] ⊨∃x ψ(x, . . .) ↔(∃x ∈M[G]) M[G] ⊨ψ(x, . . .)
↔(∃x ∈M B) M[G] ⊨ψ(xG, . . .)
↔(∃x ∈M B) ∥ψ(x, . . .)∥∈G
↔

x∈MB ∥ψ(x, . . .)∥∈G
↔∥∃x ψ(x, . . .)∥∈G.
The penultimate equivalence holds because if we let A = {∥ψ(x, . . .)∥:
x ∈M B}, then A ⊂B and A ∈M, and since G is generic we have
(∃a ∈A) a ∈G
if and only if
 A ∈G.
Similarly for ∀x ψ(x, . . .).
⊓⊔
Corollary 14.30. M[G] is a model of ZFC.
Proof. By Theorem 14.24, every axiom σ of ZFC is valid in M B, therefore
∥σ∥= 1 ∈G and hence σ is true in M[G].
⊓⊔
The following completes the proof of both Theorems 14.5 and 14.6 when
forcing with a complete Boolean algebra:
Lemma 14.31.
(i) M ⊂M[G], and both models have the same ordinals.
(ii) G ∈M[G] and if N ⊃M is a transitive model of ZFC such that
G ∈N, then N ⊃M[G].
Proof. (i) For every x ∈M, the G-interpretation of the canonical name ˇx
is ˇxG = x (proved by ∈-induction). Hence M ⊂M[G]. To show that ev-
ery ordinal in M[G] is in M (that M[G] is not “longer” than M), we use
Lemma 14.23.

218
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
(ii) Let ˙G be the canonical name of a generic ultraﬁlter (Deﬁnition 14.25).
Its interpretation is ˙GG = G and so G ∈M[G]. If N ⊃M is a transitive model
containing G, then the construction of M[G] can be carried out inside N, and
thus M[G] ⊂N.
⊓⊔
We shall now prove Theorems 14.5 and 14.6:
Let (P, <) be a notion of forcing in the ground model M, and let G ⊂P
be generic over M. Let B = B(P), and let M P = M B be the class of the
P-names. First we deﬁne G-interpretation of P-names: For every x ∈M P,
(i) ∅G = ∅,
(ii) xG = {yG : (∃p ∈G) e(p) ≤x(y)}.
(14.32)
Then we let
M[G] = {xG : x ∈M P }.
Now let H be the ultraﬁlter on B generated by e(G): H = {u ∈B :
∃p ∈G e(p) ≤u}. H is M-generic, and it is easily seen that xG = xH for all
x ∈M B. Thus M[G] = M[H].
The Forcing Theorem now follows from the deﬁnition of ⊩and The-
orem 14.29. As for the Generic Model Theorem 14.5, (a), (c), (d), and
the ﬁrst part of (b) are immediate consequences of Lemma 14.31; it only
remains to verify that G ∈M[G]. For that, we can either observe that
G = {p ∈P : e(p) ∈H} is in M[H], or invoke (14.29) and verify that
˙GG = G.
Consistency Proofs
Forcing is used mainly (but not exclusively) in consistency proofs. In practice,
a consistency result is usually presented as follows: Suppose that A is some
sentence (in the language of set theory) and we wish to prove that A is consis-
tent with ZFC, or more generally, that A is consistent with some extension T
of ZFC. This is accomplished by assuming that T holds (in V , the universe)
and by exhibiting a forcing notion P such that the generic extension V [G]
satisﬁes A.
One way to make this argument legitimate is to assume that there exists
a countable transitive model M of T. Using a forcing notion P ∈M, there
exists a P-generic ﬁlter G over M, and M[G] is a transitive model that
satisﬁes A. Hence A is consistent relative to T.
The assumption of a countable transitive model is unnecessary, as state-
ments about generic extensions can be considered merely as an informal refor-
mulation of statements about the forcing relation. In particular, “V [G] satis-
ﬁes A” is to be understood to mean “every p ∈P forces A.” Then (assuming
that T is consistent), the negation ¬A is not provable: If it were then every
condition would force ¬A (or, the Boolean value ∥¬A∥would be 1). Note

14. Forcing
219
that for consistency of A, it is enough to show that some p ∈P forces A; in
the language of generic extensions, one ﬁnds a p ∈P such that when G is
generic and p ∈G, then V [G] ⊨A.
In some cases, forcing results are stated as independence results: A sen-
tence A is independent of the axioms T. This usually means that both A
and ¬A are consistent with T.
Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis
We now present Cohen’s proof of independence of CH.
Theorem 14.32. There is a generic extension V [G] that satisﬁes 2ℵ0 > ℵ1.
Proof. We describe the notion of forcing that produces a generic extension
with the desired property. Let P be the set of all functions p such that
(i) dom(p) is a ﬁnite subset of ω2 × ω,
(ii) ran(p) ⊂{0, 1},
(14.33)
and let p be stronger than q if and only if p ⊃q.
If G is a generic set of conditions, we let f =  G. We claim that
(i) f is a function;
(ii) dom(f) = ω2 × ω.
(14.34)
(Of course, ω2 means ω2 in the ground model.)
Part (i) of (14.34) holds because G is a ﬁlter. For part (ii), the sets Dα,n =
{p ∈P : (α, n) ∈dom(p)} are dense in P, hence G meets each of them, and
so (α, n) ∈dom(f) for all (α, n) ∈ω2 × ω.
Now, for each α < ω2, let fα : ω →{0, 1} be the function deﬁned as
follows:
fα(n) = f(α, n).
If α ̸= β, then fα ̸= fβ; this is because the set
D = {p ∈P : p(α, n) ̸= p(β, n) for some n}
is dense in P and hence G ∩D ̸= ∅. Thus in V [G] we have a one-to-one
mapping α →fα of ω2 into {0, 1}ω.
Each fα is the characteristic function of a set aα ⊂ω. As in Example 14.2,
we call these sets Cohen generic reals. Thus P adjoins ℵ2 Cohen generic reals
to the ground model.
The proof of Theorem 14.32 is almost complete, except for one detail: We
don’t know that the ordinal ωV
2 is the cardinal ℵ2 of V [G]. We shall complete
the proof by showing that V [G] has the same cardinals as the ground model
(P preserves cardinals).

220
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Deﬁnition 14.33. A forcing notion P satisﬁes the countable chain condition
(c.c.c.) if every antichain in P is at most countable.
The following theorem is one of the basic tools of forcing:
Theorem 14.34. If P satisﬁes the countable chain condition then V and
V [G] have the same cardinals and coﬁnalities.
In other words cfV α = cfV [G] α for all limit ordinals α; the statement on
cardinals follows.
Proof. It suﬃces to show that if κ is a regular cardinal then κ remains regular
in V [G]. Thus let λ < κ; we show that every function f ∈V [G] from λ into κ
is bounded.
Let ˙f be a name, let p ∈P and assume
(14.35)
p ⊩˙f is a function from ˇλ to ˇκ.
For every α < λ consider the set
Aα = {β < κ : ∃q < p q ⊩˙f(α) = β}.
We claim that every Aα is at most countable: If W = {qβ : β ∈Aα} is a set
of witnesses to β ∈Aα then W is an antichain, and therefore countable by
c.c.c. Hence |Aα| ≤ℵ0.
Now, because κ is regular, the set 
α<κ Aα is bounded, by some γ < κ.
It follows that for each α < λ, p forces ˙f(α) < γ.
Thus for every ˙f ∈V P and every p ∈P, if (14.35) then p ⊩˙f is bounded
below κ. It follows that in V [G], every function f : λ →κ is bounded.
⊓⊔
Now we complete the proof of Theorem 14.32 by showing that the forc-
ing notion that we employed satisﬁes c.c.c. That follows from the following
consequence of Theorem 9.18 on ∆-systems.
⊓⊔
Lemma 14.35. Let P be a set of ﬁnite functions, with values in a given
countable set C. Let p < q be deﬁned as p ⊃q, and assume that for all p, q ∈
P, if p∪q is a function then p∪q ∈P (or more generally, ∃r ∈P (r ⊃p∪q)).
Then P satisﬁes the countable chain condition.
Proof. Let F be an uncountable subset of P, and let W be the set {dom(p) :
p ∈F}. As C is countable, the set W must be uncountable. By Theorem 9.18
there exists an uncountable ∆-system Z ⊂W; let S = X ∩Y for any X ̸= Y
in Z. Let G be the set of all p ∈F such that dom(p) ∈Z; again because C is
countable there are uncountably many p ∈G with the same p↾S. Now if p
and q are two such functions, i.e., dom(p)∩dom(q) = S and p↾S = q↾S, then
p and q are compatible functions and therefore compatible conditions. Hence
F is not an antichain.
⊓⊔

14. Forcing
221
Independence of the Axiom of Choice
If the ground model M satisﬁes the Axiom of Choice, then so does the
generic extension. However, we can still use the method of forcing to con-
struct a model in which AC fails; namely, we ﬁnd a suitable submodel of the
generic model, a model N such that M ⊂N ⊂M[G].
Theorem 14.36 (Cohen). There is a model of ZF in which the real num-
bers cannot be well-ordered. Thus the Axiom of Choice is independent of the
axioms of ZF.
Before we construct a model without Choice, we shall prove an easy but
useful lemma on automorphisms of Boolean-valued models. Let B be a com-
plete Boolean algebra and let π be an automorphism of B. We deﬁne, by
induction on ρ(x) an automorphism of the Boolean-valued universe V B, and
denote it also π:
(i) π(∅) = ∅;
(ii) dom(πx) = π(dom(x)), and (πx)(πy) = π(x(y)) for all π(y) ∈
dom(πx).
(14.36)
Clearly, π is a one-to-one function of V B onto itself, and π(ˇx) = ˇx for every x.
Lemma 14.37. Let ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) be a formula. If π is an automorphism
of B, then for all x1, . . . , xn ∈V B,
(14.37)
∥ϕ(πx1, . . . , πxn)∥= π(∥ϕ(x1, . . . , xn)∥).
Proof. (a) If ϕ is an atomic formula, (14.37) is proved by induction (as in the
deﬁnition of ∥x ∈y∥, ∥x = y∥). For instance,
∥πx ∈πy∥=

t∈dom(πy)
(∥πx = t∥· (πy)(t))
=

z∈dom(y)
(∥πx = πz∥· (πy)(πz))
= π


z∈dom(y)
(∥x = z∥· y(z))

= π(∥x ∈y∥).
(b) In general, the proof is by induction on the complexity of ϕ.
⊓⊔
In practice, (14.37) is used as follows: Let (P, <) be a separative partially
ordered set. If π is an automorphism of P, then π extends to an automorphism
of the complete Boolean algebra B(P), by π(u) = {π(p) : p ≤u}. Then
(14.37) takes this form: For all P-names ˙x1, . . . , ˙xn,
(14.38)
p ⊩ϕ( ˙x1, . . . , ˙xn)
if and only if
πp ⊩ϕ(π ˙x1, . . . , π ˙xn).
For the proof of Theorem 14.36, let us assume that the ground model M
satisﬁes V = L. We ﬁrst extend M by adding countably many Cohen generic

reals: Let P be the set of all functions p such that
(i) dom(p) is a ﬁnite subset of ω × ω,
(ii) ran(p) ⊂{0, 1},
(14.39)
and let p < q if and only if p ⊃q.
Let G be a generic set of conditions. For each i ∈ω, let
ai = {n ∈ω : (∃p ∈G) p(i, n) = 1}
and let A = {ai : i ∈ω}. Let ˙ai, i ∈ω, and ˙A be the canonical names for ai
and A:
dom(˙ai) = {ˇn : n ∈ω}, and ˙ai(ˇn) = {p ∈P : p(i, n) = 1},
(14.40)
dom( ˙A) = {˙ai : i ∈ω}, and ˙A(˙ai) = 1.
(14.41)
Lemma 14.38. If i ̸= j, then every p forces ˙ai ̸= ˙aj.
Proof. For every p there exists a q ⊃p such that for some n ∈ω, q(i, n) = 1
and q(j, n) = 0.
⊓⊔
In the model M[G], let N be the class of all sets hereditarily ordinal-
deﬁnable over A, N = HOD(A). As we have seen in Chapter 13, N is a tran-
sitive model of ZF. Since the elements of A are sets of integers, it is clear that
A ∈N. We shall show that A cannot be well-ordered in the model N. For
that, it suﬃces to show that there is no one-to-one function f ∈N from A
into the ordinals.
Lemma 14.39. In M[G], there is no one-to-one function f : A →Ord,
ordinal-deﬁnable over A.
Proof. Assume that f : A →Ord is one-to-one and ordinal-deﬁnable over A.
Then there is a ﬁnite sequence s = ⟨x0, . . . , xk⟩in A such that f is ordinal-
deﬁnable from s and A. Since f is one-to-one, it is easy to see that every
a ∈A is ordinal deﬁnable from s and A. In particular, pick some a ∈A that
is not among the xi, i ≤k.
Since a ∈OD[s, A], there is a formula ϕ such that
(14.42)
M[G] ⊨a is the unique set such that ϕ(a, α1, . . . , αn, s, A)
for some ordinals α1, . . . , αn. We shall show that (14.42) is impossible.
Let ˙a be a name for a, let ˙x0, . . . , ˙xk be names for x0, . . . , xk and let
˙s be a name for the sequence ⟨x0, . . . , xk⟩. We shall show the following:
For every p0 that forces ϕ(˙a, ˇα1, . . . , ˇαn, ˙s, ˙A) there exist ˙b and
q ≤p0 such that q forces ˙a ̸= ˙b and ϕ(˙b, ˇα1, . . . , ˇαn, ˙s, ˙A).
(14.43)
Let p0 ⊩ϕ(˙a, α1, . . . , αn, ˙s, ˙A). There exist i, i0, . . . , ik and p1 ≤p0 such
that p1 forces ˙a = ˙ai, ˙x0 = ˙ai0, . . . , ˙xk = ˙aik. Let j ∈ω be such that j ̸= i,
and that for all m, (j, m) /∈dom(p1).

14. Forcing
223
Now let π be the permutation of ω that interchanges i and j, and πx = x
otherwise. This permutation induces an automorphism of P: For every p ∈P,
(14.44)
dom(πp) = {(πx, m) : (x, m) ∈dom(p)},
(πp)(πx, m) = p(x, m).
In turn, π induces an automorphism of B, and of M B. It is easy to see
(cf. (14.40) and (14.41)) that π(˙ai) = ˙aj, π(˙aj) = ˙ai, π(˙ax) = ˙ax for all
x ̸= i, j, π( ˙A) = ˙A and π( ˙s) = ˙s. Since (j, m) /∈dom(p1) for all m, it follows
that (i, m) /∈dom(πp1) for all m, and thus p1 and πp1 are compatible. Let
q = p1 ∪πp1.
Now, on the one hand we have
p1 ⊩ϕ(˙ai, α1, . . . , αn, ˙s, ˙A),
and on the other hand, since πˇα = ˇα, π ˙s = ˙s and π ˙A = ˙A, we have
πp1 ⊩ϕ(˙aj, α1, . . . , αn, ˙s, ˙A).
Hence
q ⊩ϕ(˙ai, . . .) and ϕ(˙aj, . . .)
and by Lemma 14.38, q ⊩˙ai ̸= ˙aj. Thus we have proved (14.43), which
contradicts (14.42).

(ii) For every X ⊂B, ∥if ˇX ⊂˙G then Q X ∈˙G∥= 1.

Historical Notes
The method of forcing was invented by Paul Cohen who used it to prove the inde-
pendence of the Continuum Hypothesis and the Axiom of Choice (see [1963, 1964]
and the book [1966]). The Boolean-valued version of Cohen’s method has been for-
mulated by Scott, Solovay, and Vopˇenka. Following an observation of Solovay that
the forcing relation can be viewed as assigning Boolean-values to formulas, Scott
formulated his version of Boolean-valued models in [1967]. Vopˇenka developed a the-
ory of Cohen’s method of forcing, using open sets in a topological space as forcing
conditions (in [1964, 1965a, 1965b, 1965c, 1966, 1967a] and Vopˇenka-H´ajek [1967]),
eventually arriving at the Boolean-valued version of forcing more or less identical
to Scott-Solovay’s version (Vopˇenka [1967b]).

15. Applications of Forcing
In this chapter we present some important applications of the method of
forcing. These applications establish several major consistency results and
illustrate the techniques involved in use of forcing. Throughout we use V to
denote the ground model, and V [G] for the generic extension.
Cohen Reals
In (14.23) we described a notion of forcing that adjoins ℵ2 real numbers to
the ground model. In general, let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal. The following
notion of forcing adjoins κ real numbers, called Cohen reals.
Let P be the set of all functions p such that
(i) dom(p) is a ﬁnite subset of κ × ω,
(ii) ran(p) ⊂{0, 1},
(15.1)
and let p be stronger than q if and only if p ⊃q.
Let G be a generic set of conditions and let f =  G. By a genericity
argument, f is a function from κ × ω into {0, 1}. For each α < κ, we let
fα be the function on ω deﬁned by fα(n) = f(α, n) and let aα = {n ∈ω :
fα(n) = 1}. Each aα is a real (a subset of ω), aα /∈V and if α ̸= β, then
aα ̸= aβ. This is proved as in Theorem 14.32.
Also as in Theorem 14.32 one shows that P satisﬁes the countable chain
condition. It follows that cardinals and coﬁnalities are preserved in the generic
extension.
Since P adds κ distinct Cohen reals, the size of the continuum in V [G] is
at least κ. In fact, it is at least (κℵ0)V :
(2ℵ0)V [G] = ((2ℵ0)ℵ0)V [G] ≥(κℵ0)V [G] ≥(κℵ0)V .
It turns out that there are precisely (κℵ0)V reals in V [G]. The following is
a general estimate of the number of new sets in a generic extension:
Lemma 15.1. Let λ be a cardinal in V . If G is a V -generic ultraﬁlter on B,
then
(2λ)V [G] ≤(|B|λ)V .

226
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Proof. Every subset A ⊂λ in V [G] has a name ˙A ∈V B; every such ˙A deter-
mines a function α →∥ˇα ∈˙A∥from λ into B. Diﬀerent subsets correspond
to diﬀerent functions, and thus the number of all subsets of λ in V [G] is not
greater than the number of all functions from λ into B in V .
⊓⊔
When P is the forcing (15.1) that adds κ Cohen reals, P satisﬁes c.c.c. and
so every element of B = B(P) is the Boolean sum of a countable antichain
in P; hence |B| ≤|P|ℵ0 = κℵ0. By Exercise 7.32, |B| = |B|ℵ0 and it follows
that |B| = κℵ0, and consequently, (2ℵ0)V [G] = (κℵ0)V .
If we start with a ground model that satisﬁes GCH, and if κ is (in V ) a car-
dinal of uncountable coﬁnality, then κℵ0 = κ in V , and we get a model V [G]
in which 2ℵ0 = κ.
Adding Subsets of Regular Cardinals
The forcing that adds a Cohen real generalizes easily from ω to any regular
cardinal κ. Let κ be, in V , a regular cardinal and assume that 2<κ = κ.
Let P be the set of all functions p such that
(i) dom(p) ⊂κ and | dom(p)| < κ;
(ii) ran(p) ⊂{0, 1}.
(15.2)
A condition p be stronger than q if and only if p ⊃q.
Let G be a set of conditions generic over V and let f =  G. As before,
f is a function from κ into {0, 1}, and X = {α < κ : f(α) = 1} is a subset
of κ and X /∈V .
In order to add more new subsets of κ, we use a generalization of (15.1):
Let κ be as above, and let λ be a cardinal greater than κ such that λκ = λ.
Let P be the set of all functions p such that:
(i) dom(p) ⊂λ × κ and | dom(p)| < κ,
(ii) ran(p) ⊂{0, 1},
(15.3)
and let p be stronger than q if and only if p ⊃q.
Let G be a generic set of conditions and let f =  G. For each α < λ, we
let
aα = {ξ < κ : f(α, ξ) = 1}.
Each aα is a subset of κ, each aα /∈V and aα ̸= aβ whenever α ̸= β.
We claim that in the generic extension, all cardinals are preserved, and
2κ = λ. But to show this, we need additional results in the theory of forcing,
proved in the next two sections.

15. Applications of Forcing
227
The κ-Chain Condition
Deﬁnition 15.2. A forcing notion P satisﬁes the κ-chain condition (κ-c.c.)
if every antichain in P has cardinality less than κ.
The ℵ1-chain condition is the c.c.c. Note that P satisﬁes the κ-c.c. if and
only if B(P) satisﬁes the κ-c.c.
Theorem 14.34 generalizes as follows:
Theorem 15.3. If κ is a regular cardinal and if P satisﬁes the κ-chain con-
dition then κ remains a regular cardinal in the generic extension by P.
Proof. The proof is exactly as the proof of Theorem 14.34. The only diﬀerence
is that the set Aα is not necessarily countable but has cardinality less than κ.
⊓⊔
Consequently, all regular cardinals κ ≥sat(B(P)), and in particular all
regular κ ≥|P|+ are preserved in V [G].
The following lemma generalizes Lemma 14.35, and implies that the forc-
ing notion (15.3) satisﬁes the κ+-chain condition. We remark that Lemma 15.4
is related to (a generalization of) Theorem 9.18 on ∆-systems.
Lemma 15.4. Let κ be a regular cardinal such that 2<κ = κ. Let S be an
arbitrary set and let |C| ≤κ. Let P be the set of all functions p whose
domains are subsets of S of size < κ, with values in C. Let p < q if and only
if q ⊃q. Then P satisﬁes the κ+-chain condition.
Proof. Let W ⊂P be an antichain. We construct sequences A0 ⊂A1 ⊂
. . . ⊂Aα ⊂. . . (α < κ) of subsets of S, and W0 ⊂W1 ⊂. . . ⊂Wα ⊂. . .
(α < κ) of subsets of W. If α is a limit ordinal, we let Wα = 
β<α Wβ
and Aα = 
β<α Aβ. Given Aα and Wα, we choose for each p ∈P with
dom(p) ⊂Aα some q ∈W (if there is one) such that p = q↾Aα. Then we let
Wα+1 = Wα ∪{the chosen q’s} and Aα+1 = {dom(q) : q ∈Wα+1}; ﬁnally,
A = 
α<κ Aα.
Next we show that W = 
α<κ Wα: If q ∈W, then there is an α < κ
such that dom(q) ∩A = dom(q) ∩Aα. Thus if p = q↾Aα, there exists some
q′ ∈Wα+1 such that q′↾Aα = p. Since dom(q′) ⊂A, it follows that q and q′
are compatible; however, both are elements of W and thus q = q′. Hence
q ∈Wα+1.
The proof is completed by showing that |Aα| ≤κ and |Wα| ≤κ for each
α < κ. This is proved by induction on α. If |Wα| ≤κ, then |Aα| ≤κ because
Aα = {dom(q) : q ∈Wα}. If α is a limit ordinal and |Wβ| ≤κ for all
β < α, then |Wα| = | 
β<α Wβ| ≤κ. Thus let us assume that |Wα| ≤κ and
let us show that |Wα+1| ≤κ. The set Wα+1 is obtained by adding to Wα
at most one q ∈W for each p ∈P with dom(p) ⊂Aα. There are at most
κ<κ subsets X of Aα of size < κ, and since κ is regular and 2<κ = κ, we
have κ<κ = κ. On each X there are |C||X| functions with values in C, and
therefore there are at most κ elements p of P with dom(p) ⊂Aα. Hence
|Wα+1| ≤κ. Then it follows that |W| ≤κ.
⊓⊔

Distributivity
In (7.28) we deﬁned κ-distributivity of complete Boolean algebras. We now
show that this concept plays a crucial role in the theory of forcing.
Deﬁnition 15.5. A forcing notion P is κ-distributive if the intersection of
κ open dense sets is open dense. P is <κ-distributive if it is λ-distributive for
all λ < κ.
Note that if P is dense in B then P is κ-distributive if and only if B is.
Theorem 15.6. Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal and assume that (P, <) is κ-
distributive. Then if f ∈V [G] is a function from κ into V , then f ∈V . In
particular, κ has no new subsets in V [G].
Proof. Let f : κ →V and f ∈V [G], let ˙f be a name for f. There exist some
A ∈V and a condition p0 ∈G such that p0 forces
˙f is a function from ˇκ into ˇA.
For each α < κ, the set
Dα = {p ≤p0 : (∃x ∈A) p ⊩˙f(ˇα) = ˇx}
is open dense below p0. Thus D = 
α<κ Dα is dense below p0 and therefore
there is some p ∈D∩G. Now we argue in V : For each α < κ there is some xα
such that p ⊩˙f(ˇα) = ˇxα; let g : κ →A be the function deﬁned by g(α) = xα.
However, it is easy to see that f(α) = xα = g(α), for every α < κ, and thus
f ∈V .
⊓⊔
See Exercise 15.5 for the converse.
The following property, stronger than distributivity, is often easy to verify:
Deﬁnition 15.7. P is κ-closed if for every λ ≤κ, every descending sequence
p0 ≥p1 ≥. . . ≥pα ≥. . . (α < λ) has a lower bound. P is <κ-closed if it is
λ-closed for all λ < κ.
Lemma 15.8. If P is κ-closed then it is κ-distributive.
Proof. Let {Dα : α < κ} be a collection of open dense sets. The intersection
D = 
α<κ Dα is clearly open; to show that D is dense, let p ∈P be arbitrary.
By induction on α < κ, we construct a descending κ-sequence of conditions
p ≥p0 ≥p1 ≥. . .. We let pα be a condition stronger than all pξ, ξ < α,
and such that pα ∈Dα. Finally, we let q be a condition stronger than all pα,
α < κ. Clearly, q ∈D.
⊓⊔
Now we can prove the claim about the generic extension by the forcing
in (15.3). The forcing P is <κ-closed, and therefore κ has no new bounded
subsets; hence κ is preserved. The cardinals above κ are preserved because
P satisﬁes the κ+-chain condition, by Lemma 15.4. We have |P| = λ and
therefore |B| = |P|κ = λ, and so, by Lemma 15.1, (2κ)V [G] = λκ = λ.

Product Forcing
Let P and Q be two notions of forcing. The product P × Q is the coordinate-
wise partially ordered set product of P and Q:
(15.4)
(p1, q1) ≤(p2, q2)
if and only if
p1 ≤p2 and q1 ≤q2.
If G is a generic ﬁlter on P × Q, let
(15.5)
G1 = {p ∈P : ∃q (p, q) ∈G},
G2 = {q ∈Q : ∃p (p, q) ∈G}.
The sets G1 and G2 are generic on P and Q respectively, and G = G1 × G2.
The following lemma describes genericity on products:
Lemma 15.9 (The Product Lemma). Let P and Q be two notions of
forcing in M. In order that G ⊂P × Q be generic over M, it is necessary
and suﬃcient that G = G1×G2 where G1 ⊂P is generic over M and G2 ⊂Q
is generic over M[G1]. Moreover, M[G] = M[G1][G2].
As a corollary, if G1 is generic over M and G2 is generic over M[G1], then
G1 is generic over M[G2], and M[G1][G2] = M[G2][G1].
Proof. First let G be an M-generic ﬁlter on P × Q. We deﬁne G1 and G2
by (15.5). Clearly, G1 and G2 are ﬁlters, and G ⊂G1 × G2. If (p1, p2) ∈
G1 × G2, then there are p′
1 ∈G1 and p′
2 ∈G2 such that (p′
1, p2) ∈G and
(p1, p′
2) ∈G. Since G is a ﬁlter, there exist q1 ≤p1, p′
1 and q2 ≤p2, p′
2 such
(q1, q2) ∈G. Hence (p1, p2) ∈G and we have G = G1 × G2.
It is easy to see that G1 is generic over M: If D1 ∈M is dense in P, then
D1×Q is dense in P ×Q; and since (D1×Q)∩G ̸= ∅, we have D1∩G1 ̸= ∅. To
show that G2 is generic over M[G1], let D2 ∈M[G1] be dense in Q. Let ⊩be
the forcing relation corresponding to P. Let ˙D2 be a name for D2 and let
p1 ∈G1 be such that p1 forces “ ˙D2 is dense in Q.” Let p2 ∈G2 be arbitrary.
For every q1 ≤p1 and every q2 ≤p2 there exist r1 ≤q1 and r2 ≤q2 such
that r1 ⊩r2 ∈˙D2; thus
D = {(r1, r2) : r1 ≤p1 and r1 ⊩r2 ∈˙D2}
is dense in P × Q below (p1, p2) and so there exist r1, r2 such that r1 ∈G1
and r1 ⊩r2 ∈˙D2. Hence r2 ∈D2 ∩G2.
Conversely, let G1 ⊂P be M-generic and let G2 ⊂Q be M[G1]-generic.
We let G = G1 × G2. Clearly G is a ﬁlter on P × Q. To show that G is
M-generic, let D ∈M be dense in P × Q. We let
D2 = {p2 : (p1, p2) ∈D for some p1 ∈G1}.
The set D2 is in M[G1]; we shall show that D2 is dense in Q and thus
D ∩(G1 × G2) ̸= ∅.

230
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Let q2 ∈Q be arbitrary. Since D is dense in P × Q, it follows that the set
D1 = {p1 : (∃p2 ≤q2) (p1, p2) ∈D}
is dense in P. Hence there is p1 ∈G1 ∩D1 and so D2 is dense in Q. Since
G1 × G2 ∈M[G1][G2], it is obvious that M[G1 × G2] = M[G1][G2].
⊓⊔
We shall now deﬁne products of inﬁnitely many notions of forcing. In
order to simplify the notation, we will assume that every notion of forcing
has a greatest element, denoted 1. In practice, the empty condition ∅is often
the greatest element of (P, <).
Deﬁnition 15.10. Let {Pi : i ∈I} be a collection of partially ordered sets,
each having a greatest element 1. The product P = 
i∈I Pi consists of all
functions p on I with values p(i) ∈Pi, such that p(i) = 1 for all but ﬁnitely
many i ∈I. P is partially ordered by
(15.6)
p ≤q
if and only if
p(i) ≤q(i) for all i ∈I.
For each p ∈
i Pi, the ﬁnite set s(p) = {i ∈I : p(i) ̸= 1} is called the
support of p.
If G is a generic ﬁlter on 
i Pi, then for each i ∈I, the set Gi = {p(i) :
p ∈G}, the projection of G on Pi, is a generic ﬁlter on Pi.
A natural generalization of a product is κ-product:
Deﬁnition 15.11. Let κ be a regular cardinal. The κ-product (the product
with <κ-support) of Pi is the set of all functions p on I with p(i) ∈Pi such
that |s(p)| < κ; the ordering is coordinatewise (15.6).
As usual, λ-support means <λ+-support, countable support means <ℵ1-
support, etc.
The following lemma is immediate:
Lemma 15.12. If P and Q are λ-closed then P × Q is λ-closed. More gen-
erally, if each Pi is λ-closed and P is the κ-product of the Pi, with λ < κ,
then P is λ-closed.
Proof. Let α ≤λ and let pξ = ⟨pξ
i : i ∈I⟩, ξ < α, be a descending α-sequence
of conditions in P. If we let s = 
ξ<α s(pξ), then |s| < κ, and since each Pi is
λ-closed, it is easy to ﬁnd p = ⟨pi : i ∈I⟩such that s(p) = s and that pi ≤pξ
i
for each i ∈I and each ξ < α.
⊓⊔
Chain conditions are generally not preserved by products. While it is con-
sistent that c.c.c. is preserved by products (we return to this in Chapter 16),
it is also consistent to have a forcing P that satisﬁes c.c.c. but P × P does
not (see Exercise 15.28).
The following property (K for Knaster) is stronger than the countable
chain condition:

15. Applications of Forcing
231
Deﬁnition 15.13. A notion of forcing has property (K) if every uncountable
set of conditions has an uncountable subset of pairwise compatible elements.
Lemma 15.14. If P and Q both have property (K) then so does P × Q.
Proof. Let W ⊂P × Q be uncountable. If there exists a p ∈P such that the
set X = {q : (p, q) ∈W} is uncountable, then since Q has property (K) there
exists an uncountable Y ⊂X of pairwise compatible elements, and {p} × Y
is such a subset of W in P × Q.
The proof is similar if for some q ∈Q, the set {p : (p, q) ∈W} is uncount-
able. In the remaining case, there is an uncountable set of pairs F ⊂W that
is a one-to-one function. Applying successively property (K) to P and Q, we
get an uncountable G ⊂F such that for any two elements (p1, q1) and (p2, q2)
of G, p1 is compatible with p2 in P and q1 is compatible with q2 in Q, hence
(p1, q1) and (p2, q2) are compatible.
⊓⊔
Theorem 15.15. If for every i ∈I, Pi has property (K) then 
i∈I Pi has
property (K).
Proof. Let X be an uncountable subset of P, and let W = {s(p) : p ∈X}.
If W is countable, then there is a ﬁnite set J ⊂I such that s(p) = J
for uncountably many p. By Lemma 15.14, 
i∈J Pi has property (K) and
the theorem follows. If W is uncountable, there exist, by Theorem 9.18, an
uncountable Z ⊂X and a ﬁnite set J ⊂I such that s(p)∩s(q) = J whenever
p, q ∈Z, p ̸= q. Since 
i∈I Pi has property (K), Z has an uncountable
subset Y such that for any p, q ∈Y , p↾J and q↾J are compatible. But such p
and q are compatible in 
i∈I Pi.
⊓⊔
Corollary 15.16. The product of any collection of countable forcing notions
has property (K) and so it satisﬁes the countable chain condition.
⊓⊔
The best one can say about the chain condition in products is this:
Theorem 15.17. (i) If each Pi has size λ (inﬁnite) then the product of the Pi
satisﬁes the λ+-chain condition.
(ii) If κ is regular, λ ≥κ, λ<κ = λ and |Pi| ≤λ for all i ∈I, then the
κ-product of the Pi satisﬁes the λ+-chain condition.
(iii) If λ is inaccessible, κ < λ is regular, and |Pi| < λ for each i, then
the κ-product satisﬁes the λ-chain condition.
Proof. (i) is a special case of (ii); thus consider κ-products. Let P be the
κ-product, and let W be an antichain in P. If p = ⟨pi : i ∈I⟩and q = ⟨qi :
i ∈I⟩are incompatible in P, then for some i ∈s(p) ∩s(p), pi and qi are
incompatible in Pi, and in particular pi ̸= qi. Thus we can regard elements
of W as functions whose domain is a subset s(p) of I of size < κ, with values
in the Pi, and show that if W consists of pairwise incompatible functions
then |W| has the required bound.

232
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
We follow the proof of Lemma 15.4. As there we construct κ-sequences
A0 ⊂A1 ⊂. . . ⊂Aα ⊂. . . (α < κ) of subsets of I and W0 ⊂W1 ⊂. . . ⊂
Wα ⊂. . . (α < κ) of subsets of W such that Aα = {s(p) : p ∈Wα} for
each α. And as there we show that W = 
α<κ Wα. Thus it remains to show,
by induction on α, that |Wα| ≤λ (in (ii)) or that |Wα| < λ (in (iii)). Let us
prove (ii); (iii) is similar.
If |Wα| ≤λ, then |Aα| ≤κ · λ = λ. If α < κ is limit and if |Wβ| ≤λ for
each β < α, then |Wα| ≤|α| · λ = λ. Thus let us assume that |Wα| ≤λ and
let us show that |Wα+1| ≤λ. The set Wα+1 is obtained by adding to Wα at
most one q for each p ∈P with s(p) ⊂Aα. However, since |Aα| ≤λ, there
are at most λ<κ functions p with s(p) ⊂Aα, |s(p)| < κ, and λ possible values
for each i ∈s(p). Thus |Wα+1| ≤λ<κ = λ.
⊓⊔
Easton’s Theorem
The theorem that we are about to prove shows that in ZFC alone the contin-
uum function 2κ can behave in any prescribed way consistent with K¨onig’s
Theorem, for regular cardinals κ. As we have seen in Chapter 8 (Silver’s The-
orem) and shall see again in Chapter 24, this is not the case with singular
cardinals.
Theorem 15.18 (Easton). Let M be a transitive model of ZFC and as-
sume that the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis holds in M. Let F be a func-
tion (in M) whose arguments are regular cardinals and whose values are
cardinals, such that for all regular κ and λ:
(i) F(κ) > κ;
(ii) F(κ) ≤F(λ) whenever κ ≤λ;
(iii) cf F(κ) > κ.
(15.7)
Then there is a generic extension M[G] of M such that M and M[G] have
the same cardinals and coﬁnalities, and for every regular κ,
M[G] ⊨2κ = F(κ).
We have to point out that the generic extension is obtained by forcing with
a class of conditions. By Lemma 15.1, a notion of forcing can only increase
the size of 2κ for κ < |B(P)|; thus we have to use a class of conditions. We
shall describe the appropriate generalization of the forcing method.
Since the proof of Easton’s Theorem involves forcing with a class of con-
ditions, we shall ﬁrst give a proof of the special case, when the “continuum
function” F is prescribed for only a set of regular cardinals. Thus let us work
in a ground model M that satisﬁes the GCH and let F be a function deﬁned
on a set A of regular cardinals and having the properties (15.7)(i)–(iii).

15. Applications of Forcing
233
For each κ ∈dom(F), let (Pκ, ⊃) be the notion of forcing that adjoins
F(κ) subsets of κ (cf. (15.3)):
(15.8)
dom(p) ⊂κ × F(κ),
| dom(p)| < κ,
and
ran(p) ⊂{0, 1}.
We let (P, <) be the Easton product of Pκ, κ ∈A: A condition p is
a function p = ⟨pκ : κ ∈A⟩∈
κ∈A Pκ such that if we denote s(p) =
{κ ∈A : pκ ̸= ∅}, the support of p, then
(15.9)
for every regular cardinal γ, |s(p) ∩γ| < γ.
We can regard the conditions as functions with values 0 and 1, whose domain
consists of triples (κ, α, β) where κ ∈A, α < κ, and β < F(κ), and such that
for every regular cardinal γ,
(15.10)
|{(κ, α, β) ∈dom(p) : κ ≤γ}| < γ
(and p is stronger than q if and only if p ⊃q). Note that (15.10) implies that
for each κ ∈A, | dom(pκ)| < κ, where pκ is deﬁned by
pκ(α, β) = p(κ, α, β).
Let G be a generic set of conditions, and let for each κ ∈A, Gκ be the
projection of G on Pκ. Each Gκ is a generic ﬁlter on Pκ and thus produces
F(κ) new subsets of κ:
aκ
β = {α < κ : (∃p ∈G) p(κ, α, β) = 1}
(β < F(κ)).
We shall show that (P, <) preserves cardinals and coﬁnalities, and that each
κ ∈A has exactly F(κ) subsets in M[G]. The condition (15.10) is instrumen-
tal in the proof.
Given a regular cardinal λ, we can decompose each condition p ∈P into
two parts:
(15.11)
p≤λ = p↾{(κ, α, β) : κ ≤λ},
p>λ = p↾{(κ, α, β) : κ > λ}.
Clearly p = p≤λ ∪p>λ. We let
(15.12)
P ≤λ = {p≤λ : p ∈P},
P >λ = {p>λ : p ∈P}.
Obviously, P ≤λ is the Easton product of Pκ, κ ∈A and κ ≤λ, and P >λ is
the Easton product of Pκ, κ ∈A and κ > λ. Moreover, P is (isomorphic to)
the product P ≤λ × P >λ.
First we notice that P >λ is λ-closed: If C ⊂P >λ consists of pairwise
compatible conditions and |C| ≤λ, then p =  C is a condition in P >λ;
(15.10) holds for all regular γ > λ, and holds trivially for γ ≤λ because if
(κ, α, β) ∈dom(p), then κ > λ.
Furthermore, P ≤λ satisﬁes the λ+-chain condition: If W ⊂P ≤λ is an
antichain, then |W| ≤λ. The proof given in Theorem 15.17 works in this case
as well because | dom(p)| < λ for each p ∈P ≤λ (and because GCH holds).
Thus P = P >λ × P ≤λ where P >λ is λ-closed and P ≤λ satisﬁes the λ+-chain
condition.

Lemma 15.19. Let G × H be an M-generic ﬁlter on P × Q, where P is λ-
closed and Q satisﬁes the λ+-chain condition. Then every function f : λ →M
in M[G × H] is in M[H]. In particular,
P M[G×H](λ) = P M[H](λ).
Proof. Let ˙f be a name for f; let us assume, without loss of generality, that
for some A, every condition forces that ˙f is a function from λ into A. For
each α < λ, let Dα ⊂P be deﬁned as follows:
p ∈Dα if and only if there exist a maximal antichain W ⊂Q
and a family {a(α)
p,q : q ∈W} such that for each q ∈W,
(p, q) ⊩˙f(α) = a(α)
p,q .
(15.13)
We claim that each Dα is open dense in P. Clearly, Dα is open; thus
let p0 ∈P be arbitrary and let us ﬁnd p ∈Dα such that p ≤p0. There
exist p1 ≤p0, q1 ∈Q and a1 ∈A such that (p1, q1) ⊩
˙f(α) = a1. By
induction on γ < λ+, we construct pγ ∈P, qγ ∈Q, and aγ ∈A such that
p0 ≥p1 ≥. . . ≥pγ ≥. . ., that the qγ are pairwise incompatible and that
(pγ, qγ) forces ˙f(α) = aγ. If {qξ : ξ < γ} is not maximal, we can ﬁnd such
pγ, qγ, and aγ since P is λ-closed. By the λ+-chain condition, there is some
β < λ+ such that W = {qγ : γ < β} is a maximal antichain; then we ﬁnd
p ∈P stronger than all pγ, γ < β. Thus Dα is open dense in P.
Since P is λ-closed, it follows that 
α<λ Dα is open dense, and so there
exists some p ∈G such that p ∈Dα for all α < λ. We pick (in M) for each
α < λ a maximal antichain Wα ⊂Q and a family {a(α)
p,q : q ∈Wα} such
that (15.13) holds for each q ∈Wα. By the genericity of H, for every α there
is a unique q ∈Wα such that q ∈H, and we have, for every α < λ,
(15.14)
f(α) = a(α)
p,q ,
where q is the unique q ∈Wα ∩H.
However, (15.14) deﬁnes the function f in M[H].
⊓⊔
Now we can ﬁnish the proof of Easton’s Theorem, that is, at least in the
case when F is deﬁned on a set A of regular cardinals.
Let κ be a regular cardinal in M; we shall show that κ is a regular cardi-
nal in M[G]. If κ fails to be a regular cardinal, then there exists a func-
tion f that maps some λ < κ, regular in M, coﬁnally into κ. We con-
sider P as the product: P = P >λ × P ≤λ. Then G = G>λ × G≤λ and
M[G] = M[G>λ][G≤λ] = M[G≤λ][G>λ]. By Lemma 15.19, f is in M[G≤λ]
and so κ is not a regular cardinal in M[G≤λ]. However, this is a contradiction
since P ≤λ satisﬁes the κ-chain condition and hence κ is regular in M[G≤λ].
It remains to prove that (2λ)M[G] = F(λ), for each λ ∈A. Again, we
regard P as the product P >λ × P ≤λ and G = G>λ × G≤λ. By Lemma 15.19,
every subset of λ in M[G] is in M[G≤λ] and we have (2λ)M[G] = (2λ)M[G≤λ].
However, an easy computation shows that |P ≤λ| = F(λ) and |B(P ≤λ)| =
F(λ), and hence (2λ)M[G] ≤F(λ). On the other hand, we have exhibited
F(λ) subsets of λ for each λ ∈A, and so M[G] ⊨2λ = F(λ).
⊓⊔

Forcing with a Class of Conditions
We shall now show how to generalize the preceding construction to prove
Easton’s Theorem in full generality, when the function F is deﬁned for all
regular cardinals. This generalization involves forcing with a proper class of
conditions. Although it is possible to give a general method of forcing with
a class, we shall concentrate only on the particular example.
Thus let M be a transitive model of ZFC + GCH. Moreover, we assume
that M has a well-ordering of the universe (e.g., if M satisﬁes V = L).
Let F be a function (in M) deﬁned on all regular cardinals and having the
properties (15.7)(i)–(iii). We deﬁne a class P of forcing conditions as follows:
P is the class of all functions p with values 0 and 1, whose domain consists
of triples (κ, α, β) where κ is a regular cardinal, α < κ and β < F(κ), and
such that for every regular cardinal γ, (15.10) holds, i.e.,
|{(κ, α, β) ∈dom(p) : κ ≤γ}| < γ
(and p is stronger than q if and only if p ⊃q).
As before, we deﬁne P ≤λ and P >λ for every regular cardinal λ. Note that
P ≤λ is a set. To deﬁne the Boolean-valued model M B and the forcing relation,
we use the fact that P is the Easton product of Pκ, κ a regular cardinal. For
each regular λ, we let Bλ = B(P ≤λ). If λ < µ then the inclusion P ≤λ ⊂P ≤µ
deﬁnes an obvious embedding of Bλ into Bµ; thus we arrange the deﬁnition
of the Bλ so that Bλ is a complete subalgebra of Bµ whenever λ < µ. Then
we let B = 
λ Bλ. B is a proper class; otherwise it has all the features of
a complete Boolean algebra. In particular,  X exists for every set X ⊂B.
Also, P
is dense in B.
To deﬁne M B, we cannot quite use the inductive deﬁnition (14.15)
since B is not a set. However, we simply let M B = 
λ M Bλ; the for-
mal deﬁnition of M B does not present any problem. Similarly, to deﬁne
∥x ∈y∥and ∥x = y∥, we ﬁrst notice that if x, y ∈M Bλ and λ ≤µ, then
∥x ∈y∥Bλ = ∥x ∈y∥Bµ and so we let ∥x ∈y∥= ∥x ∈y∥Bλ where λ is such
that x, y ∈M Bλ. The same for ∥x = y∥.
As for the forcing relation in general, we cannot deﬁne ∥ϕ∥unless ϕ is ∆0;
this is because  X does not generally exist if X ⊂B is a class. However,
we can still deﬁne p ⊩ϕ using the formulas from Theorem 14.7.
Now, we call G ⊂P generic over M if (i) p ⊃q and p ∈G implies q ∈G,
(ii) p, q ∈G implies p ∪q ∈G, and (iii) if D is a class in M and D is dense
in P, then D ∩G ̸= ∅.
The question of existence of a generic ﬁlter can be settled in a more or less
the same way as in the case when P is a set. One possible way is to assume
that M is a countable transitive model. Then there are only countably many
classes in M and G exists. Another possible way is to use the canonical generic
ultraﬁlter. It is the class ˙G in M B deﬁned by ˙G(ˇp) = p for all p ∈P (here
we need the assumption that M is a class in M B).

236
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Thus let G be an M-generic ﬁlter on P. For every regular λ, Gλ = G∩P ≤λ
is generic on P ≤λ. If ˙x ∈M Bλ and λ ≤µ, then ˙xGλ = ˙xGµ, and so we deﬁne
˙xG = ˙xGλ where λ is such that ˙x ∈M Bλ. Then we deﬁne M[G] = 
λ M[Gλ].
Using the genericity of G and properties of the forcing relation, we get
the Forcing Theorem,
(15.15)
M[G] ⊨ϕ(x1, . . . , xn)
if and only if
(∃p ∈G) p ⊩ϕ( ˙x1, . . . , ˙xn)
where ˙x1, . . . , ˙xn ∈M B are names for x1, . . . , xn.
The formula (15.15) is proved ﬁrst for atomic formulas and then by in-
duction on ϕ; in the induction step involving the quantiﬁers, we use the fact
that G intersects every dense class of M.
We shall now show that M[G] is a model of ZFC. The proofs of all axioms
of ZFC except Power Set and Replacement go through as when we forced with
a set. (Separation also needs some extra work which we leave to the reader.) It
is no surprise that the Power Set and Replacement Axioms present problems.
It is easy to construct either a class of forcing conditions adding a proper
class of Cohen reals, or a class of conditions collapsing Ord onto ω (as in
the following section). The present proof of the Power Set and Replacement
Axioms uses the fact that for every regular λ (or at least for arbitrarily large
regular λ), P = P >λ × P ≤λ where P >λ is λ-closed and P ≤λ is a set and
satisﬁes the λ+-chain condition.
Power Set. Let λ be a regular cardinal. Lemma 15.19 remains true even
when applied to P >λ × P ≤λ. It does not matter that each Dα is a class. The
“sequence” of classes ⟨Dα : α < λ⟩can be deﬁned (e.g., as a class of pairs
{(p, α) : p ∈Dα}) and since P >λ is λ-closed, the intersection 
α<λ Dα is
dense, and there exists p ∈G ∩P >λ such that p ∈Dα for all α < λ. The rest
of the proof of Lemma 15.19 remains unchanged, and thus we have proved
that every subset of λ in M[G] is in M[G]. Since P ≤λ is a set, it follows that
the Power Set Axiom holds in M[G].
Replacement. To show that the Axioms of Replacement hold in M[G], we
combine the proof for ordinary generic extension with Lemma 15.19. It suf-
ﬁces to prove that if in M[G], ϕ(α, v) deﬁnes a function K : Ord →M[G],
then {K(α) : α < λ} is a set in M[G] for every regular cardinal λ. Without
less of generality, let us assume that for every p ∈P
(15.16)
p ⊩for every α there is a unique v such that ϕ(α, v).
Let λ be a regular cardinal, and let us consider again P = P >λ × P ≤λ,
and G = (G ∩P >λ) × Gλ. As in Lemma 15.19, let us deﬁne, for each α < λ,
a class Dα ⊂P >λ:
p ∈Dα if and only if there is a maximal antichain W ⊂P ≤λ
and a family {˙a(α)
p,q : q ∈W} such that for each q ∈W,
p ∪q ⊩ϕ(α, ˙a(α)
p,q ).
(15.17)

15. Applications of Forcing
237
As in Lemma 15.19, each Dα, α < λ, is open dense; since P >λ is λ-closed,

α<λ Dα is dense and there exists p ∈G ∩P >λ such that p ∈Dα for all
α < λ. We pick (in M) for each α < λ a maximal antichain Wα ⊂P ≤λ and
a family {˙a(α)
p,q : q ∈Wα} such that (15.17) holds for each q ∈Wα. Now, if we
let S = {˙a(α)
p,q : α < λ and q ∈Wα}, then it follows that {K(α) : α < λ} ⊂
{˙aG : ˙a ∈S}. However, the latter is a set in M[G]: There is a γ such that
S ⊂M Bγ, and we have {˙aG : ˙a ∈S} = {˙aGγ : ˙a ∈S} ∈M[Gγ].
Thus M[G] is a model of ZFC and it remains to show that M[G] has the
same cardinals and coﬁnalities as M, and that in M[G], 2κ = F(κ) for every
regular cardinal κ. However, this is proved exactly the same way as when we
forced with a set of Easton conditions.
⊓⊔
We conclude the section with a remark on the Bernays-G¨odel axiomatic
set theory. If a sentence involving only set variables is provable in BGC =
BG + Axiom E, then it is provable in BG + AC. This is a consequence of
the following: If M is a transitive model of BG + AC, then there is a generic
extension M[G] that has the same sets and has a choice function F deﬁned
for all nonempty sets. The forcing conditions p ∈P used in the proof are
choice functions whose domain is a set of nonempty sets (and p < q means
p ⊃q). The proof that M[G] is a model of BG is rather easy since no new sets
are added (P is κ-closed for all κ). The generic ﬁlter on P deﬁnes a choice
function F =  G, and F is deﬁned for all nonempty sets X ∈M[G].
The L´evy Collapse
One of the most useful techniques provided by forcing is collapsing cardinals.
We start with the simplest example:
Example 15.20. Let λ be an uncountable cardinal. Let P be the set of
all ﬁnite sequences ⟨p(0), . . . , p(n −1)⟩of ordinals less than λ; p is stronger
than q if p ⊃q.
Let G be a generic ﬁlter on P and let f =  G; f is a function with
domain ω and range λ. Thus P collapses λ: Its cardinality in V [G] is ℵ0.
As |P| = λ, P satisﬁes the λ+-chain condition and so all cardinals greater
than λ are preserved (as are all coﬁnalities greater than λ).
⊓⊔
This construction generalizes to collapsing λ to κ:
Lemma 15.21. Let κ be a regular cardinal and let λ > κ be a cardinal. There
is a notion of forcing (P, <) that collapses λ onto κ, i.e., λ has cardinality κ
in the generic extension. Moreover,
(i) every cardinal α ≤κ in V remains a cardinal in V [G]; and
(ii) if λ<κ = λ, then every cardinal α > λ remains a cardinal in the
extension.

238
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
[The condition in (ii) is satisﬁed if GCH holds and cf λ ≥κ.]
Proof. Let P be the set of all functions p such that:
(i) dom(p) ⊂κ and | dom(p)| < κ,
(ii) ran(p) ⊂λ,
(15.18)
and let p < q if and only if p ⊃q.
Let G be a generic set of conditions and let f =  G. Clearly, f is a func-
tion, and it maps κ onto λ.
(P, <) is <κ-closed and therefore all cardinals ≤κ are preserved. If λ<κ =
λ, then |P| = λ and it follows that all cardinals ≥λ+ are preserved.
⊓⊔
The following technique collapses all cardinals below an inaccessible car-
dinal λ while preserving λ, thus making λ a successor cardinal in the generic
extension. The forcing notion P deﬁned in (15.19) is called the L´evy collapse;
we denote B(P) = Col(κ, <λ).
Theorem 15.22 (L´evy). Let κ be a regular cardinal and let λ > κ be an
inaccessible cardinal. There is a notion of forcing (P, <) such that:
(i) every α such that κ ≤α < λ has cardinality κ in V [G]; and
(ii) every cardinal ≤κ and every cardinal ≥λ remains a cardinal in V [G].
Hence V [G] ⊨λ = κ+.
Proof. For each α < λ, let Pα be the set of all functions pα such that
dom(pα) ⊂κ, | dom(pα)| < κ, and ran(pα) ⊂α; let pα < qα if and only
if pα ⊃qα.
Let (P, <) be the κ-product of the Pα, α < λ. Equivalently, the conditions
p ∈P are functions on subsets of λ × κ such that
(i) | dom(p)| < κ;
(ii) p(α, ξ) < α for each (α, ξ) ∈dom(p).
(15.19)
Let G be a generic set of conditions; for each α < λ, let Gα be the projec-
tion of G on Pα. Then Gα is a generic ﬁlter on Pα; and as in Lemma 15.21,
the set fα =  Gα is a function that maps κ onto α. Thus V [G] ⊨|α| ≤|κ|,
for every α < λ.
The notion of forcing (P, <) is <κ-closed and hence it preserves all car-
dinals and coﬁnalities ≤κ. In particular, κ is a cardinal in V [G].
By Theorem 15.17(iii), (P, <) satisﬁes the λ-chain condition. Hence λ re-
mains a cardinal in V [G], and so do all cardinals greater than λ. It follows
that in V [G], λ is the cardinal successor of κ.
⊓⊔

15. Applications of Forcing
239
Suslin Trees
One of the earliest applications of forcing was the solution of Suslin’s Problem:
The existence of a Suslin line is independent of ZFC. In this section we show
how to construct a Suslin tree by forcing and in L; in Chapter 16 we will
construct a generic model in which there are no Suslin trees.
Theorem 15.23. There is a generic extension in which there exists a Suslin
tree.
Proof. Let P be the collection of all countable normal trees, i.e., all T such
that for some α < ω1,
(i) each t ∈T is a function t : β →ω for some β < α;
(ii) if t ∈T and s is an initial segment of t then s ∈T ;
(iii) if β + 1 < α and t : β →ω is in T , then t⌢n ∈T for all n ∈ω;
(iv) if β < α and t : β →ω is in T , then for every γ such that
β ≤γ < α there exists an s : γ →ω in T such that t ⊂s;
(v) T ∩ωβ is at most countable for all β < α.
(15.20)
(See (9.9) and Exercise 9.6.) T1 is stronger than T2 if T1 is an extension of T2,
i.e.,
(15.21)
T1 < T2
if and only if
∃α < height(T1) T2 = {t↾α : t ∈T1}.
Let G be a generic set of conditions and let T = {T : T ∈G}. We shall
show that in V [G], T is a normal Suslin tree.
First we note that if T1 and T2 are two conditions, then either one is an
extension of the other, or T1 and T2 are incompatible. Thus G consists of
pairwise comparable trees and one can easily verify that T is a normal tree
(of height ≤ω1).
If T0, T1, . . . , Tn, . . . is a sequence of conditions such that for each n,
Tn+1 is an extension of Tn, then ∞
n=0 Tn is a normal countable tree (and
extends each Tn). Hence P is ℵ0-closed, and consequently, the cardinal ℵ1 is
preserved (and V [G] has the same countable sequences in V as V ).
To show that the height of T is ω1, we verify that for every α < ω1,
G contains a condition T of height at least α. We show that the set {T ∈P :
height(T ) ≥α} is dense in P, for any α < ω1. In other words, we show that
for each T0 ∈P and each α < ω1, there is an extension T ∈P of T0, of height
at least α. It suﬃces to show that each T0 ∈P has an extension T ∈P that
has one more level; for then we can proceed by induction and take unions at
limit steps.
If height(T0) is a successor ordinal, then an extension of T0 is easily ob-
tained. If height(T0) is a limit ordinal, then we ﬁrst observe that for each
t ∈T0 there exists a branch b of length α in T0 such that t ∈b: Using an in-
creasing sequence α0 < α1 < . . . < αn . . . with limit α, we use the normality

240
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
condition (15.20)(iv) to obtain such a branch. Now we construct an exten-
sion T of T0, of height α + 1, as follows: For each t ∈T0, we pick a branch bt
of length α in T0 such that t ∈bt, and let T = T0 ∪{s : s =  bt for some
t ∈T } (we extend all the branches bt, t ∈T0, of T0). Since T0 is countable
the added level is countable, and one can verify that T ∈P.
It remains to show that T has no uncountable antichain. If T is a tree
and A is an antichain in T , then A is called a maximal antichain if there is
no antichain A′ in T such that A′ ⊃A: Each t ∈T is comparable with some
a ∈A. If A is a maximal antichain in T and if T ′ is an extension of T , then
A is not necessarily maximal in T . Let us call a set S ⊂T bounded in T if
there is some α < height(T ) such that all elements of S are at levels ≤α. (If
the height of T is a successor ordinal, then every S ⊂T is bounded.)
Lemma 15.24. If A is a maximal antichain in a normal tree T and if A is
bounded in T (in particular, if the height of T is a successor ordinal), then
A is maximal in every extension of T .
Proof. Let T ′ be an extension of T . Let α < height(T ) be such that each
a ∈A is at level ≤α. If t′ ∈T ′ −T , then there exists t ∈T at level α such
that t ⊂t′; in turn, there exists a ∈A such that a ⊂t. Hence t′ is comparable
with some a ∈A.
⊓⊔
Lemma 15.25. Let α be a countable limit ordinal, let T ∈P be a normal
α-tree and let A be a maximal antichain in T . Then there exists an extension
T ′ ∈P of T of height α + 1 such that A is a maximal antichain in T ′ (and
hence A is a bounded maximal antichain in T ′).
Proof. For each t ∈T there exists a ∈A such that either t ⊂a or a ⊂t. In
either case, there exists a branch b = bt of length α in T such that t ∈b and
a ∈b. Let T ′ be the extension of T obtained by extending the branches bt,
for all t ∈T : T ′ = T ∪{ bt : t ∈T }. The tree T ′ is a normal (α + 1)-tree
and extends T ; moreover, since every s ∈T ′ is comparable with some a ∈A,
A is maximal in T ′.
⊓⊔
Now we ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 15.23 by showing that in V [G], every
antichain in T is countable. Since every antichain can be extended to a max-
imal antichain, it suﬃces to show that every maximal antichain is countable.
Thus let A be a maximal antichain in T . There is a name
˙A for A and
a condition T ∈G such that
T ⊩˙A is a maximal antichain in T .
We will show that the following set of conditions is dense below T :
D = {T ′ ≤T : there is a bounded maximal antichain A′ in T ′
such that T ′ ⊩A′ ⊂˙A}.
Then some T ′ ∈D is in G and there is a bounded maximal antichain A′ in T ′
such that A′ ⊂A. However, T is an extension of T ′, and by Lemma 15.24,

15. Applications of Forcing
241
A′ is maximal in T . Consequently, A = A′, and since A′ is countable, we are
done.
To show that D is dense below T let T0 ≤T be arbitrary. We shall
construct a tree T ′ ≤T0 such that T ′ ∈D. Since T0 ⊩( ˙A is a maximal
antichain in T and T is an extension of T0), there exist for each s ∈T0 an
extension T ′
0 of T0 and some ts ∈T ′
0 such that
(15.22)
s and ts are comparable
and
T ′
0 ⊩ts ∈˙A.
Since T0 is countable, we repeat this countably many times and obtain an
extension T ′
0 < T0 such that (15.22) holds for every s ∈T0. Let T1 = T ′
0.
Then we proceed by induction and construct a sequence of trees T0 ≥T1 ≥
. . . ≥Tn ≥. . . such that for each n, Tn+1 extends Tn and
(15.23) (∀s ∈Tn)(∃ts ∈Tn+1) s and ts are comparable and Tn+1 ⊩ts ∈˙A.
We let T∞= ∞
n=0 Tn, and A′ = {ts : s ∈T∞}. By (15.23), A′ is a maximal
antichain in T∞, and T∞⊩A′ ⊂˙A. Now we apply Lemma 15.25 and get an
extension T ′ of T such that A′ is a bounded maximal antichain in T ′. Clearly,
T ′ ⊩A′ ⊂˙A, and hence T ′ ∈D.
⊓⊔
In the Exercises (15.21 and 15.22) we present another forcing notion (with
ﬁnite conditions) that produces a Suslin tree. Later in the book we show that
the forcing that adds a Cohen real also adds a Suslin tree.
The following theorem shows that a Suslin tree exists in L.
Theorem 15.26 (Jensen). If V = L then there exists a Suslin tree.
Proof. We shall prove that the Diamond Principle ♦implies that a Suslin
tree exists. First we make the following observation. If T is a normal ω1-tree,
let Tα = {x ∈T : o(x) < α}.
Lemma 15.27. If A is a maximal antichain in T , then the set
C = {α : A ∩Tα is a maximal antichain in Tα}
is closed unbounded.
Proof. It is easy to see that C is closed. To show that C is unbounded, let
α0 < ω1 be arbitrary. Since Tα0 is countable, there exists a countable ordinal
α1 > α0 such that every t ∈Tα0 is compatible with some a ∈A ∩Tα1. Then
there is α2 > α1 such that each t ∈Tα1 is comparable with some a ∈A∩Tα2,
etc. If α0 < α1 < α2 < . . . < αn < . . . is constructed in this way and if
α = limn αn, then A ∩Tα is a maximal antichain in Tα.
⊓⊔
We now use ♦to construct a normal Suslin tree (T, <T). We proceed by
induction on levels. To facilitate the use of ♦, we let points of T be countable

242
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
ordinals, T = ω1, and in fact each Tα (the ﬁrst α levels of T ) is an initial
segment of ω1.
We construct Tα, α < ω1, such that each Tα is a normal α-tree and such
that Tβ extends Tα whenever β > α. T1 consists of one point. If α is a limit
ordinal, then (Tα, <T ) is the union of the trees (Tβ, <T), β < α. If α is
a successor ordinal, then (Tα+1, <T ) is an extension of (Tα, <T ) obtained by
adjoining inﬁnitely immediate successors to each x at the top level of Tα.
It remains to describe the construction of Tα+1 if α is a limit ordinal. Let
⟨Sα : α < ω1⟩be a ♦-sequence. If Sα is a maximal antichain in (Tα, <T ),
then we use Lemma 15.25 and ﬁnd an extension (Tα+1, <T ) of Tα such that
Sα is maximal in Tα+1. Otherwise, we let Tα+1 be any extension of Tα that
is a normal (α + 1)-tree. (In either case, we let the set Tα+1 be an initial
segment of countable ordinals.)
We shall now show that the tree T = 
α<ω1 Tα is a normal Suslin tree.
It suﬃces to verify that T has no uncountable antichain. If A ⊂T (= ω1)
is a maximal antichain in T , then by Lemma 15.27, A ∩Tα is a maximal
antichain in Tα, for a closed unbounded set of α’s. It follows that easily from
the construction that for a closed unbounded set of α’s, Tα = α. Thus using
the Diamond Principle, we ﬁnd a limit ordinal α such that A ∩α = Sα and
A ∩α is a maximal antichain in Tα. However, we constructed Tα+1 in such
a way that A ∩α is maximal in Tα+1, and therefore in T . It follows that
A = A ∩α and so A is countable.

Suslin trees are a fruitful source of counterexamples in set-theoretic topol-
ogy as well as in the theory of Boolean algebras. As an example, let (T, <)
be a Suslin tree, and consider the partial ordering (PT , <) = (T, >). Any
two elements of T are incomparable in T if and only if they are incompatible
in PT . Thus PT satisﬁes the countable chain condition.
Lemma 15.28. If T is a normal Suslin tree, then PT is ℵ0-distributive.
Proof. Let Dn, n = 0, 1, 2 . . . , be open dense subsets of PT . We shall prove
that ∞
n=0 Dn is dense in PT . First we claim that if D ⊂PT is open dense,
then there is an α < ω1 such that D contains all levels of T above α. To prove
this, let A be a maximal antichain in D. A is an antichain in T and hence
countable. Thus let α < ω1 be such that all a ∈A are below level α. Now
if x ∈T is at level ≥α, x is comparable with some a ∈A (by maximality
of A), and hence a ≤T x. Since D is open, we have x ∈D.
Now if Dn, n = 0, 1, . . . , are open dense, we pick countable ordinals αn
such that Dn contains all levels of T above αn; and since T is normal, this
implies that ∞
n=0 Dn is dense in PT .
⊓⊔
Corollary 15.29. If T is a normal Suslin tree, then B = B(PT ) is an ℵ0-
distributive, c.c.c., atomless, complete Boolean algebra.

Random Reals
Consider the notion of forcing where forcing conditions are Borel sets of reals
of positive Lebesgue measure; a condition p is stronger than q if p ⊂q. The
corresponding complete Boolean algebra is B/Iµ where B is the σ-algebra of
all Borel sets of reals and Iµ is the σ-ideal of all null sets. As Iµ is σ-saturated,
B/Iµ satisﬁes the countable chain condition, and hence the forcing preserves
cardinals.
The generic extension V [G] is determined by a single real, called a random
real. Let a ∈RV [G] be the unique member of each rational interval [r1, r2]V [G]
such that [r1, r2]V ∈G. Conversely, G can be deﬁned from a, and so V [G] =
V [a]. (see Exercise 13.34 for the meaning of V [a].)
The following lemma illustrates one of the diﬀerences between random and
generic reals. If f and g are functions from ω to ω we say that g dominates f
if f(n) < g(n) for all n.
Lemma 15.30. (i) In the random real extension V [G], every f : ω →ω is
dominated by some g ∈V .
(ii) In the Cohen real extension V [G], there exists a function f : ω →ω
that is not dominated by any g ∈V .
Proof. (i) Forcing conditions are Borel sets of positive measure, and we freely
confuse them with their equivalence classes in B/Iµ.
Let p ⊩˙f : ω →ω; we shall ﬁnd a q < p and some g : ω →ω such that
q forces that g dominates ˙f. For each n, let g(n) be suﬃciently large, so that
µ(p −∥˙f(n) < g(n)∥) < 1
2n · 1
4 · µ(p).
The Borel set q = p ∩∞
n=0 ∥˙f(n) < g(n)∥has measure at least µ(p)/2, and
forces ∀n ˙f(n) < g(n).
(ii) We use the following variant of Cohen forcing: Forcing conditions are
ﬁnite sequences ⟨p(0), . . . , p(n −1)⟩of natural numbers, and p < q if and
only if p ⊃q. (This forcing produces the same generic extension—and has
the same B(P)—as the forcing from Example 14.2).
Let ˙f be the name for the function f =  G. If p is any condition and
g : ω →ω is in V , then there exist a stronger q ⊃p and some n ∈dom(q)
such that q(n) > g(n). It follows that q forces g(n) > ˙f(n) (because q ⊩
˙f(n) = q(n)).
⊓⊔
To add a large number of random reals, we use product measure:
Example 15.31. Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal and let I = κ × ω. Let Ω=
{0, 1}I. Let T be the set of all ﬁnite 0–1 functions with dom(t) ⊂I. Let S be
the σ-algebra generated by the sets St, t ∈T , where St = {f ∈Ω: t ⊂f}.
The product measure on S is the unique σ-additive measure such that each St
has measure 1/2|t|. Let B = S/I where I is the ideal of measure 0 sets.

244
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
If G is a generic ultraﬁlter on B then f = {t : St ∈G} is a 0–1 function
on I, and for each α < κ, we deﬁne fα(n) = f(α, n), for all n < ω. The fα,
α < κ, are κ-distinct random reals, and the continuum in V [G] has size at
least κ. But since |B|ℵ0 = κℵ0, we have (2ℵ0)V [G] = κℵ0.
⊓⊔
Forcing with Perfect Trees
This section describes forcing with perfect trees (due to Gerald Sacks) that
produces a real of minimal degree of constructibility. If forced over L, the
generic ﬁlter yields a real a such that a /∈L and such that for every real
x ∈L[a], either x ∈L or a ∈L[x].
Let Seq({0, 1}) denote the set of all ﬁnite 0–1 sequences. A tree is a set
T ⊂Seq({0, 1}) that satisﬁes
(15.24)
if t ∈T and s = t↾n for some n, then s ∈T .
A nonempty tree T is perfect if for every t ∈T there exists an s ⊃t such that
both s⌢0 and s⌢1 are in T . (Compare with (4.4) and Lemma 4.11.) The set
of all paths in a perfect tree is a perfect set in the Cantor space {0, 1}ω.
Deﬁnition 15.32 (Forcing with Perfect Trees). Let P be the set of all
perfect trees p ⊂Seq({0, 1}); p is stronger than q if and only if p ⊂q.
If G is a generic set of perfect trees, let
(15.25)
f = {s : (∀p ∈G) s ∈p}.
The function f : ω →{0, 1} is called a Sacks real. Note that V [G] = V [f].
Since |P| = 2ℵ0, if we assume CH in the ground model, P satisﬁes the ℵ2-
chain condition and all cardinals ≥ℵ2 are preserved. We prove below that
ℵ1 is preserved as well.
Deﬁnition 15.33. A generic ﬁlter G is minimal over the ground model M
if for every set of ordinals X in M[G], either X ∈M or G ∈M[X].
Theorem 15.34 (Sacks). When forcing with perfect trees, the generic ﬁlter
is minimal over the ground model.
The proof uses the technique of fusion. Let p be a perfect tree. A node
s ∈p is a splitting node if both s⌢0 ∈p and s⌢1 ∈p; a splitting node s is
an nth splitting node if there are exactly n splitting nodes t such that t ⊂s.
(A perfect tree has 2n−1 nth splitting nodes.) For each n ≥1, let
(15.26)
p ≤n q if and only if p ≤q and every nth splitting node of q is an
nth splitting node of p.
A fusion sequence is a sequence of conditions {pn}∞
n=0 such that pn ≤n pn−1
for all n ≥1. The following is the key property of fusion sequences:

15. Applications of Forcing
245
Lemma 15.35. If {pn}∞
n=0 is a fusion sequence then ∞
n=0 pn is a perfect
tree.
⊓⊔
If s is a node in p, let p↾s denote the tree {t ∈p : t ⊂s or t ⊃s}. If A is
a set of incompatible nodes of p and for each s ∈A, qs is a perfect tree such
that qs ⊂p↾s, then the amalgamation of {qs : s ∈A} into p is the perfect
tree
(15.27)
{t ∈p : if t ⊃s for some s ∈A then t ∈qs}.
(Replace in p each p↾s by qs.)
Proof of Theorem 15.34. Let ˙X be a name for a set of ordinals and let p ∈P
be a condition that forces ˙X /∈V ; no stronger condition forces ˙X = A, for
any A ∈V . We shall ﬁnd a condition q ≤p and a set of ordinals {γs : s is
a splitting node of q} such that qs⌢0 and qs⌢1 decide γs ∈˙X, but in opposite
ways. Then the generic branch (15.25) can be recovered from
˙XG, and so
V [ ˙XG] = V [G].
To construct q and {γs}s we build a fusion sequence {pn}∞
n=0 as follows:
Let p0 = p. For each n ≥1, let Sn be the set of all nth splitting nodes of pn−1.
For each s ∈Sn, let γs be an ordinal such that pn−1↾s does not decide γs ∈˙X,
and let qs⌢0 ≤pn−1↾s⌢0 and qs⌢1 ≤pn−1↾s⌢1 be conditions that decide
γs ∈˙X in opposite ways. Then let pn be the amalgamation of {qs⌢i : s ∈Sn
and i = 0, 1} into pn−1. Clearly, pn ≤n pn−1, and so {pn}∞
n=0 is a fusion
sequence. Then we set q = ∞
n=0 pn.
⊓⊔
A similar argument shows that forcing with perfect trees preserves ℵ1:
Lemma 15.36. If X is a countable set of ordinals in V [G] then there exists
a set A ∈V , countable in V , such that X ⊂A.
Proof. Let ˙F be a name and let p ∈P be such that p forces “ ˙F is a function
from ω into the ordinals.” We build a fusion sequence {pn}∞
n=0 with p0 = p
as follows: For each n ≥1, let Sn be the set of all nth splitting nodes of pn−1.
For each s ∈Sn, let qs⌢0, qs⌢1, as⌢0, as⌢1 be such that (for i = 0, 1)
qs⌢i ≤pn−1↾s⌢i and qs⌢i ⊩˙F(n −1) = as⌢i. Let pn be the amalgamation
of {qs⌢i : s ∈Sn and i = 0, 1}. Then let q = ∞
n=0 pn, and
A =
∞

n=0
{as⌢i : s ∈Sn and i = 0, 1}.
It follows that q ⊩ran( ˙F) ⊂A.
⊓⊔
More on Generic Extensions
Properties of a generic extensions are determined by properties of the forcing
notion that constructs it. For instance, if P satisﬁes the countable chain con-
dition then V [G] preserves cardinals. Or, if P is ω-distributive then V [G] has

246
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
no new countable sets of ordinals. But since the model V [G] is determined
by the complete Boolean algebra B(P), its properties depend on properties
of the algebra. Below we illustrate the correspondence between properties of
a complete Boolean algebra B and truth in the model V B.
The ﬁrst example shows the importance of distributivity.
Let κ and λ be cardinals. A complete Boolean algebra B is (κ, λ)-dis-
tributive if
(15.28)

α<κ

β<λ
uα,β =

f:κ→λ

α<κ
uα,f(α).
Note that (15.28) is a special case of (7.28); B is κ-distributive if and only
if it is (κ, λ)-distributive for all λ. As in Lemma 7.16 we can reformulate
(κ, λ)-distributivity as follows:
Lemma 15.37. B is (κ, λ)-distributive if and only if every collection of
κ partitions of B of size at most λ has a common reﬁnement.
⊓⊔
Theorem 15.6 and Exercise 15.5 yield the following equivalence:
Theorem 15.38. B is (κ, λ)-distributive if and only if every f : κ →λ in
the generic extension by B is in the ground model.
Proof. If ∥˙f is a function from κ to λ∥= 1, then {∥˙f(α) = β∥: β < λ} is
a partition of B of size ≤λ.
⊓⊔
Exercises 15.31 and 15.32 give short proofs of Boolean algebraic results
using generic extensions.
A related concept is weak distributivity: B is called weakly (κ, λ)-distribu-
tive, if
(15.29)

α<κ

β<λ
uα,β =

g:κ→λ

α<κ

β<g(α)
uα,β.
A modiﬁcation of Theorem 15.38 gives this:
Lemma 15.39. B is weakly (κ, λ)-distributive if and only if every f : κ →λ
in V [G] is dominated by some g : κ →λ that is in V (i.e., f(α) < g(α) for
all α < κ).
⊓⊔
Consequently, by Lemma 15.30(i), the measure algebra B/Iµ is weakly
(ω, ω)-distributive.
Let B be a complete Boolean algebra and let D be a complete subalgebra
of B. If G is generic on B, then it is easy to see that G ∩D is generic on D,
and so V [G ∩D] is a model of ZFC, and V ⊂V [G ∩D] ⊂V [G]. We shall
prove that every model of ZFC between V and V [G] is obtained this way,
and that for every subset A of V in V [G] there is a complete subalgebra D
of B such that V [G ∩D] = V [A].

15. Applications of Forcing
247
We recall (cf. Chapter 7) that a complete subalgebra B of a complete
Boolean algebra D is (completely) generated by a set X ⊂D if B is the
smallest complete subalgebra of D such that X ⊂B. Let κ be a cardinal. We
say that a complete Boolean algebra B is κ-generated if there exists some
X ⊂B of size at most κ such that the complete subalgebra of B generated
by X is equal to B.
Lemma 15.40. Let X be a subset of a complete Boolean algebra B such that
B is completely generated by X. Then for every generic G on B, V [G] =
V [X ∩G].
Proof. We want to show that V [G] is the least model such that the set A =
X ∩G is in V [G]. It suﬃces to show that G can be deﬁned in terms of A.
Since B is generated by X, every element of B can be obtained from
the elements of X by successive (transﬁnite) application of the operation −
and . Thus let Xα be subsets of B deﬁned recursively as follows:
X0 = X,
Xα = {−a : a ∈Xα},
and
Xα = {a : a =  Z where Z ⊂
β<α(Xβ ∪Xβ)}.
Then B = 
α<θ Xα for some θ ≤|B|+. If we denote Gα = G ∩Xα, Gα =
G ∩Xα, we have
(15.30)
G0 = A,
Gα = {−a : a ∈Xα −Gα},
and
Gα = {a ∈Xα : a =  Z where Z contains at least one b
in some Gβ or Gβ, β < α},
and G = 
α<θ Gα. Thus given A, we deﬁne Gα and Gα inductively us-
ing (15.30) and let G = 
α<θ Gα.
⊓⊔
Corollary 15.41. If B is κ-generated, then V [G] = V [A] for some A ⊂κ.
⊓⊔
Corollary 15.42. If G is generic on B and A ∈V [G] is a subset of κ, then
there exists a κ-generated complete subalgebra D of B such that V [D ∩G] =
V [A] for some A ⊂κ.
Proof. Let
˙A be a name for A. We let X = {uα : α < κ}, where uα =
∥ˇα ∈A∥. Now let D be the complete subalgebra completely generated by X;
by Lemma 15.40 we have V [X ∩G] = V [D ∩G]. It remains to show that
V [X ∩G] = V [A].
On the one hand, we have A = {α : uα ∈X ∩G}. On the other hand,
X ∩G = {uα : α ∈A}.
⊓⊔
Lemma 15.43. Let G be generic on B. If M is a model of ZFC such that
V ⊂M ⊂V [G], then there exists a complete subalgebra D ⊂B such that
M = V [D ∩G].

248
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Proof. We show that M = V [A], where A is a set of ordinals. Then the
lemma follows from Corollary 15.42. First we note that since M satisﬁes the
Axiom of Choice, there exists for every X ∈M a set of ordinals AX ∈M
such that X ∈V [AX]. We let Z = P(B)∩M, and let A = AZ; we claim that
M = V [A].
If X ∈M, consider the set of ordinals AX; by Corollary 15.42 there exists
a subalgebra DX ⊂B such that V [AX] = V [DX ∩G]. Hence DX ∩G ∈M,
and we have DX ∩G ∈Z. Since Z ∈V [A], it follows that DX ∩G ∈V [A]
and hence X ∈V [A]. Thus M = V [A].
⊓⊔
Let us now address the question under what conditions one generic ex-
tension embeds (as a submodel) into another generic extension. Of course, if
B(P) = B(Q), then V P = V Q and if B(P) is a complete subalgebra of B(Q)
then V P ⊂V Q. But if B1 is a complete subalgebra of B2, we can have
V [G∩B1] = V [G] even if B1 ̸= B2. For every a ∈B+
2 (not necessarily in B1),
let B1↾a = {x·a : x ∈B1}. Now assume that the set {a ∈B+
2 : B1↾a = B2↾a}
is dense in B2. Then it is easy to see that V [G ∩B1] = V [G], for every
generic G on B2. (One can show that this condition is also necessarily for B1
to give the same generic extension as B2.)
By V P ⊂V Q we mean the following: Whenever G is a generic ﬁlter on Q
then there is some H ∈V [G] that is a generic ﬁlter on P. In practice there
are several ways how to verify V P ⊂V Q. The following two lemmas are
sometimes useful:
Lemma 15.44. Let i : P →Q be such that
(i) if p1 ≤p2 then i(p1) ≤i(p2),
(ii) if p1 and p2 are incompatible then i(p1) and i(p2) are incompatible,
(iii) for every q ∈Q there is a p ∈P such that for all p′ ≤p, i(p′) is
comparable with q.
Then V P ⊂V Q.
Proof. If G is generic on Q then i−1(G) is generic on P.
⊓⊔
Lemma 15.45. Let h : Q →P be such that
(i) if q1 ≤q2 then h(q1) ≤h(q2).
(ii) for every q ∈Q and every p ≤h(q) there exists a q′ compatible with q
such that h(q′) ≤p.
Then V P ⊂V Q.
Proof. If D ⊂P is open dense then h−1(D) is predense in Q. It follows that
if G is generic on Q then {p ∈P : p ≥h(q) for some q ∈G} is generic
on P.
⊓⊔
We conclude this section with the following result that shows that for
every set A of ordinals, the model L[A] is a generic extension of HOD:

15. Applications of Forcing
249
Theorem 15.46 (Vopˇenka). Let V = L[A] where A is a set of ordinals.
Then V is a generic extension of the model HOD. There is a Boolean algebra
B ∈HOD complete in HOD, and there is an ultraﬁlter G ⊂B, generic
over HOD, such that V = HOD[G].
Proof. Let κ be such that A ⊂κ. We let C = OD ∩P(P(κ)) be the family of
all ordinal deﬁnable sets of subsets of κ. Let us consider the partial ordering
(C, ⊂).
First we claim that there is a hereditarily ordinal deﬁnable partially or-
dered set (B, ≤) and an ordinal deﬁnable isomorphism π between (C, ⊂) and
(B, ≤): There is a deﬁnable one-to-one mapping F of OD into the ordinals.
The set C is an ordinal deﬁnable set of ordinal deﬁnable sets and so F↾C is
an OD one-to-one mapping of C onto F(C). We let B = F(C), and deﬁne
the partial ordering of B so that (B, ≤) is isomorphic to (C, ⊂). Since ⊂∩C2
is an OD relation, we have (B, ≤) ∈HOD.
Now (C, ⊂) is clearly a Boolean algebra. Moreover, if X ⊂C is ordinal
deﬁnable, then  X is ordinal deﬁnable and so  X = C X. Hence the
algebra C is OD-complete; and using the OD isomorphism π, we can conclude
that (B, ≤) is a complete Boolean algebra in HOD.
Now we let H = {u ∈C : A ∈u}. Clearly, H is an ultraﬁlter on C,
and if X ⊂H is OD, then  X ∈H. Hence G = π(H) is an HOD-generic
ultraﬁlter on B.
It remains to show that V = HOD[G]. Let f : κ →B be the function
deﬁned by f(α) = π({Z ⊂κ : α ∈Z}). Clearly, f is OD, and so f ∈HOD.
Now we note that for every α < κ, α ∈A if and only if f(α) ∈G and
therefore A ∈HOD[G]. It follows that V = L[A] = HOD[G].
⊓⊔
Symmetric Submodels of Generic Models
In Chapter 14 we constructed a model of set theory in which the reals cannot
be well-ordered, thus showing that the Axiom of Choice is independent of the
axioms of ZF. What follows is a more systematic study of models in which the
Axiom of Choice fails. We shall present a general method of construction of
submodels of generic extensions. The construction uses symmetry arguments
similar to those used in Theorem 14.36, and the models obtained are generally
models of ZF and do not satisfy the Axiom of Choice. This method has been
used to obtain a number of results about the relative strength of various
weaker versions and consequences of the Axiom of Choice.
The main idea of the construction of symmetric models is the use of auto-
morphisms of the Boolean-valued model V B and the Symmetry Lemma 14.37.
In fact, the idea of using automorphisms of the universe to show that the Ax-
iom of Choice is unprovable dates back into the preforcing era of set theory.
We shall describe this older construction ﬁrst.

250
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
In order to describe this method, we introduce the theory ZFA, set theory
with atoms. In addition to sets, ZFA has additional objects called atoms.
These atoms do not have any elements themselves but can be collected into
sets. Obviously, we have to modify the Axiom of Extensionality, for any two
atoms have the same elements—none.
The language of ZFA has, in addition to the predicate ∈, a constant A.
The elements of A are called atoms; all other objects are sets. The axioms
of ZFA are the axioms 1.1–1.8 of ZF plus (15.31) and (15.32):
(15.31)
If a ∈A, then there is no x such that x ∈a.
The Axiom of Extensionality takes this form:
(15.32)
If two sets X and Y have the same elements, then X = Y .
Other axioms of ZF remain unchanged. In particular, the Axiom of Regularity
states that every nonempty set has an ∈-minimal element. This minimal
element may be an atom.
The eﬀect of atoms is that the universe is no longer obtained by iterated
power set operation from the empty set. In ZFA, the universe is built up from
atoms.
Ordinal numbers are deﬁned as usual except that one has to add that an
ordinal does not contain any atom. For any set S, let us deﬁne the following
cumulative hierarchy:
(15.33)
P 0(S) = S,
P α(S) = 
β<α
P β(S)
if α is limit,
P α+1(S) = P α(S) ∪P(P α(S)),
P ∞(S) =

α∈Ord
P α(S).
It follows that V
= P ∞(A), and that the kernel, the class P ∞(∅) of
“hereditary” sets, is a model of ZF. If A is empty, then we have just ZF.
Lemma 15.47. The theory ZFA+AC+“A is inﬁnite” is consistent relative
to ZFC.
Proof. Construct a model of ZFA. Let C be an inﬁnite set of sets of the same
rank (so that X /∈TC(Y ) for any X, Y ∈C). Consider one X0 ∈C as the
empty set, and all other X ∈C as atoms. Build up the model from C by
iterating the operation P ∗(Z) = P(Z) −{∅}.
⊓⊔
While in ZF, the universe does not admit nontrivial automorphisms, the
important feature of ZFA is that every permutation of atoms induces an

15. Applications of Forcing
251
automorphism of V : If π is a one-to-one mapping of A onto A (a permutation
of A), then we deﬁne for every x (by ∈-induction)
π(x) = {π(t) : t ∈x}.
Clearly, π is an ∈-automorphism, and we have π(x) = x for every x in the
kernel P ∞(∅).
We use these automorphisms to construct transitive models of ZFA. First
we point out that the analog of Theorem 13.9 is true in ZFA: If M is a tran-
sitive, almost universal class closed under G¨odel operations, and if A ∈M,
then M is a model of ZFA.
Let G be a group of permutations of a set S. A set F of subgroups of G
is a ﬁlter on G, if for all subgroups H, K of G:
(i) G ∈F;
(ii) if H ∈F and H ⊂K, then K ∈F;
(iii) if H ∈F and K ∈F, then H ∩K ∈F;
(iv) if π ∈G and H ∈F, then πHπ−1 ∈F.
(15.34)
For a given group of permutations G of the set A of atoms and a given ﬁlter F
on G, we say that x is symmetric if the group
sym(x) = {π ∈G : π(x) = x}
belongs to F.
Let us further assume that sym(a) ∈F for all a ∈A, that is, that all
atoms are symmetric and let U be the class of all hereditarily symmetric
objects:
(15.35)
U = {x : every z ∈TC({x}) is symmetric}.
The class U is called a permutation model. It is a transitive class and includes
the kernel (because sym(x) = G for all x ∈P ∞(∅)), moreover, all atoms are
in U, and A ∈U.
Lemma 15.48. U is a transitive model of ZFA.
Proof. We show that U is closed under G¨odel operations and almost univer-
sal. It is easy to see that Gi(πx, πy) = π(Gi(x, y)) for all i = 1, . . ., 10, and
therefore
sym(Gi(x, y)) ⊃sym(x) ∩sym(y)
(i = 1, . . . , 10).
It follows that if x and y are hereditarily symmetric, then so is Gi(x, y).
To show that U is almost universal, it suﬃces to verify that for each α,
U ∩P α(A) is symmetric. For all x and all π ∈G we have rank(πx) = rank x.
Also, sym(πx) = π · sym(x) · π−1, and hence, by property (iv) in (15.34), if
x is symmetric and π ∈G, then π(x) is symmetric. Thus for all π ∈G we
have π(U ∩P α(A)) = U ∩P α(A) and therefore, sym(U ∩P α(A)) = G.
⊓⊔

252
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
In the following examples we construct permutation models as follows:
For every ﬁnite E ⊂A, we let
(15.36)
ﬁx(E) = {π ∈G : πa = a for all a ∈E}
and let F be the ﬁlter on G generated by {ﬁx(E) : E ⊂A is ﬁnite}. F is
a ﬁlter since π · ﬁx(E) · π−1 = ﬁx(π(E)). Thus x is symmetric if and only
if there exists a ﬁnite set of atoms E, a support for x, such that π(x) = x
whenever π ∈G and π(a) = a for all a ∈E.
We shall now give two examples of permutation models.
Example 15.49. Let A be inﬁnite, and let G be the group of all permuta-
tions of A. Let F be generated by {ﬁx(E) : E ⊂A is ﬁnite}, and let U be
the permutation model. In the model U the set A, although inﬁnite, has no
countable subset. Hence the Axiom of Choice fails in U.
Proof. Assume that there exists an f ∈U that is a one-to-one mapping of ω
into A. Let E be a ﬁnite subset of A such that πf = f for every π ∈ﬁx(E).
Since E is ﬁnite, there exists an a ∈A −E such that a = f(n) for some n;
also, let b ∈A−E be arbitrary such that b ̸= a. Now, let π be a permutation
of A such that πa = b but πx = x for all x ∈E. Then πf = f, and since n is
in the kernel, we have πn = n. It follows that π(f(n)) = (πf)(πn) = f(n);
however, f(n) = a while π(f(n)) = π(a) ̸= a. A contradiction.
⊓⊔
Example 15.50. Let A be a disjoint countable union of pairs: A = ∞
n=0 Pn,
Pn = {an, bn}, and let G be the group of all permutations of A such that
π({an, bn}) = {an, bn}, for all n. Let F be generated by {ﬁx(E) : E ⊂A is
ﬁnite}, and let U be the permutation model. In the model U, {Pn : n ∈ω}
is a countable set of pairs and has no choice function.
Proof. Each Pn is a symmetric set since π(Pn) = Pn for all π ∈G. For the
same reason, π⟨Pn : n ∈ω⟩= π({(n, Pn) : n ∈ω}) = ⟨Pn : n ∈ω⟩, for all
π ∈G, and so ⟨Pn : n ∈ω⟩∈U. Hence S = {Pn : n ∈ω} is a countable set
in U.
We show that there is no function f ∈U such that dom(f) = S and
f(Pn) ∈Pn for all n. Assume that f is such a function and let E be a support
of f. There exists n such that neither an nor bn is in E, and we let π ∈G be
such that π(an) = bn but πx = x for all x ∈E. Then πf = f, πPn = Pn,
and so π(f(Pn)) = (πf)(πPn) = f(Pn) but π(f(Pn)) = bn while f(Pn) = an;
a contradiction.
⊓⊔
The method of permutation models gives numerous examples of violation
of the Axiom of Choice. One usually uses the set of atoms to produce a coun-
terexample (in the permutation model) to some consequence of the Axiom of
Choice, thus showing the limitations of proofs not using the Axiom of Choice.
(A typical example is a vector space that has no basis, a set that cannot be
linearly ordered, etc.) However, these examples do not give any information

15. Applications of Forcing

about the “true” sets, like real numbers, sets of real numbers, etc., since those
sets are in the kernel. It is clear that a diﬀerent method has to be used to
investigate the role of the Axiom of Choice in ZF. We shall now describe such
a method and exploit the similarities between it and permutation models.
We shall use automorphisms (symmetries) to construct submodels of
generic extensions. As shown in (14.36), every automorphism π of a com-
plete Boolean algebra B induces an automorphism of the Boolean-valued
model V B. The important property of such an automorphism is (14.36) in
the Symmetry Lemma 14.37:
∥ϕ(π ˙x1, . . . , π ˙xn)∥= π(∥ϕ( ˙x1, . . . , ˙xn)∥).
for all names ˙x1, . . . , ˙xn.
Let G be a group of automorphisms of B, and let F be a ﬁlter on G,
i.e., a set of subgroups that satisﬁes (15.34). For each ˙x ∈V B we deﬁne its
symmetry group
sym( ˙x) = {π ∈G : π( ˙x) = ˙x}.
If π is an automorphism of B, then
(15.37)
sym(π ˙x) = π · sym( ˙x) · π−1.
This is because σ(π ˙x) = π ˙x if and only if (π−1σπ)( ˙x) = ˙x. Given a ﬁl-
ter F on G, we call ˙x symmetric if sym( ˙x) ∈F. The class HS of hereditarily
symmetric names is deﬁned by induction on ρ( ˙x):
if dom( ˙x) ⊂HS and if ˙x is symmetric, then ˙x ∈HS.
Note that π(ˇx) = ˇx for all x and all π, and so all ˇx are in HS. If a name ˙x
is symmetric, and if π ∈G, then by (15.37) and (15.34)(iv), π( ˙x) is also
symmetric. It follows that π ˙x ∈HS whenever ˙x ∈HS and π ∈G.
The class HS is a submodel of the Boolean-valued model V B, and can be
shown to satisfy all axioms of ZF. Instead, we prove that its interpretation
is a transitive model of ZF.
Thus let M be the ground model, let B be a complete Boolean algebra
in M, and let G and F be respectively (in M), a group of automorphisms
of B and a ﬁlter on G. Let G be an M-generic ultraﬁlter on B. We let
(15.38)
N = { ˙xG : ˙x ∈HS}
be the class of all elements of M[G] that have a hereditarily symmetric name.
N is called a symmetric submodel of M[G]. We will prove that N is a tran-
sitive model of ZF. Before we do so, we notice that HS is a Boolean-valued
model (with the same ∥x ∈y∥and ∥x = y∥as M B). Thus we can deﬁne
∥ϕ∥HS for every formula ϕ. Note that
(15.39)
∥∃x ϕ(x)∥HS =

˙x∈HS
∥ϕ( ˙x)∥

254
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
and that ∥ϕ∥HS = ∥ϕ∥whenever ϕ is a ∆0 formula. We also have a forcing
theorem for the model N:
(15.40)
N ⊨ϕ(x1, . . . , xn)
if and only if
∥ϕ( ˙x1, . . . , ˙xn)∥HS ∈G
where ˙x1, . . . , ˙xn ∈HS are names for x1, . . . , xn. Finally, since π(HS) = HS
for all π ∈G, we have the Symmetry Lemma for ∥∥HS: If π ∈G and
˙x1, . . . , ˙xn ∈HS, then
(15.41)
∥ϕ(π ˙x1, . . . , π ˙xn)∥HS = π(∥ϕ( ˙x1, . . . , ˙xn)∥HS).
Lemma 15.51. A symmetric submodel N of M[G] is a transitive model
of ZF, and M ⊂N ⊂M[G].
Proof. Since ˇx ∈HS for every x ∈M, we have M ⊂N. The heredity of HS
implies that N is transitive. To verify that the axioms of ZF hold in N, we
follow closely the proof of the Generic Model Theorem. As there, we have to
show that certain sets exist in the model by exhibiting names for the sets;
here we have to ﬁnd such names in HS.
A. Extensionality, Regularity, Inﬁnity. These axioms hold in N since N is
transitive and N ⊃M.
B. Separation. Let ϕ be a formula and let
Y = {x ∈X : N ⊨ϕ(x, p)}
where X, p ∈N. Let
˙X, ˙p ∈HS be names for X, p. We let ˙Y ∈M B as
follows:
dom( ˙Y ) = dom( ˙X),
˙Y (˙t) = ˙X(˙t) · ∥ϕ(˙t, ˙p)∥HS.
A routine argument shows that ˙Y is a name for Y ; it remains to show that
˙Y is symmetric.
We shall show that sym( ˙Y ) ⊃sym( ˙X) ∩sym( ˙p). Thus let π ∈G be
such that π ˙X =
˙X and π ˙p = ˙p. For every ˙t ∈dom( ˙X) we have π ˙t ∈
dom(π ˙X) = dom( ˙X) and ˙X(π ˙t) = (π ˙X)(π ˙t) = π( ˙X(˙t)), and ∥ϕ(π ˙t, ˙p)∥HS =
π∥ϕ(˙t, ˙p)∥HS, and so ˙Y (π ˙t) = π( ˙Y (˙t)). Therefore, π ˙Y = ˙Y .
C. Pairing, Union, Power Set. Let X ∈N and let ˙X ∈HS be a name for X.
For the union, we let S = {dom( ˙y) : ˙y ∈dom( ˙X)}. If π ∈sym( ˙X) then
π(S) = S and so the set Y = {tG : t ∈S} has a hereditarily symmetric name
˙Y : ˙Y (˙t) = 1 for all ˙t ∈S. Moreover, Y ⊃ X.
Pairing and Power Set are handled similarly.
D. Replacement. We show that if X ∈N, then there exists a Y ∈N such
that for all u ∈X, N satisﬁes
∃v ϕ(u, v) →(∃v ∈Y ) ϕ(u, v).
We proceed as in (14.15) except that (we deal with ∥∥HS instead of ∥∥
and that) we look for S ⊂HS such that π(S) = S for all π ∈G (for then

15. Applications of Forcing
255
Y = {tG : t ∈S} has a name in HS). This is accomplished by taking for S
the set HS ∩M B
α for large enough α. Since every π preserves the rank and
since each π ∈G preserves HS, we have π(S) = S for all π ∈G.
⊓⊔
In general, the set G is not a member of N, and N does not satisfy the
Axiom of Choice.
The model in Example 15.52 is due to Cohen. It is an analog of the
permutation model in Example 15.49, and in fact, it is the same model that
was used in Theorem 14.36.
Example 15.52. Let V [G] be the generic extension adjoining countably
many Cohen reals: P is the set of all ﬁnite 0–1 functions p with domain
dom(p) ⊂ω × ω. We deﬁne an, n ∈ω, and A = {an : n ∈ω}, as well as their
canonical names as in (14.40) and (14.41).
Every permutation π of ω induces an automorphism of P (and in turn
an automorphism of B) by (14.44). We can view such permutations as per-
mutations of the set {˙an : n ∈ω}. Let G be the group of all automorphisms
of B that are induced by such permutations. For every ﬁnite E ⊂ω, let
ﬁx(E) = {π ∈G : πn = n for each n ∈E},
and let F be the ﬁlter on G generated by the {ﬁx(E) : E ⊂ω is ﬁnite}.
Now let HS be the class of all hereditarily symmetric names, and let N be
the corresponding symmetric submodel of V [G]. It is easy to see that all ˙an
are in HS and so is ˙A. Moreover, the an are distinct subsets of ω and so A is
an inﬁnite set of reals in N.
We claim that in N, A has no countable subset. Thus assume that some
f ∈N is a one-to-one function from ω into A. Let ˙f ∈HS and let p0 ∈G be
such that
p0 ⊨˙f maps ˇω one-to-one into ˙A.
The contradiction is obtained as in Lemma 14.39. We let E be a support
of ˙f, i.e., a ﬁnite subset of ω such that sym( ˙f) ⊃ﬁx(E). We pick i ∈ω such
that i /∈E, and ﬁnd p ≤p0 and n ∈ω such that
p ⊩˙f(ˇn) = ˙ai.
Then we ﬁnd a permutation π ∈G such that:
(i) πp and p are compatible;
(ii) π ∈ﬁx(E);
(iii) πi = j ̸= i.
Then π ˙f = ˙f, π(ˇn) = ˇn, and we have p∪πp ⊩˙f(ˇn) = ˙ai and p∪πp ⊩˙f(ˇn) =
˙aj, a contradiction.
⊓⊔
The set A in Example 15.52 is a set of reals and is therefore linearly
ordered. L´evy proved that in the model N in Example 15.52, every set can

256
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
be linearly ordered. In fact, Halpern and L´evy proved that the model even
satisﬁes the Prime Ideal Theorem, thus establishing the independence of the
Axiom of Choice from the Prime Ideal Theorem. We note that numerous
consequences of the Axiom of Choice in mathematics can be proved using
the Prime Ideal Theorem instead—among others the Hahn-Banach Theo-
rem, Compactiﬁcation Theorems, the Completeness Theorem, the Tikhonov
Theorem for Hausdorﬀspaces, etc.
Another construction of Cohen yields a model that has similar properties
as the permutation model in Example 15.50. The atoms are replaced not by
reals, but by sets of reals.
The similarity between permutation models and symmetric submodels is
made precise by the following result that shows that every permutation model
can be embedded in a symmetric model of ZF, “with a prescribed degree of
accuracy.”
Theorem 15.53 (Jech-Sochor). Let U be a permutation model, let A be
its set of atoms, and let α be an ordinal. There exist a symmetric model N
of ZF and an embedding x →˜x of U into N such that
(Pα(A))U is ∈-isomorphic to

Pα( ˜A)
N.
Proof. We work in the theory ZFA, plus the Axiom of Choice. We denote A
the set of all atoms, and let M be the kernel, M = P ∞(∅). We consider
a group G of permutations of A, and a ﬁlter F on G, and let U be the
permutation model given by G and F. Let α be an ordinal number.
We shall construct a generic extension M[G] of the kernel, and then the
model N as a symmetric submodel of M[G]. We construct M[G] by adjoining
to M a number of subsets of a regular cardinal κ, κ of them for each a ∈A.
We use these to embed U in M[G].
Let κ be a regular cardinal such that κ > |P α(A)|. The set P of forcing
conditions consists of 0–1 functions p such that | dom(p)| < κ and dom(p) ⊂
(A × κ) × κ; as usual, p < q if and only if p ⊃q.
Let G be an M-generic ﬁlter on P. For each a ∈A and each ξ < κ, we let
xa,ξ = {η ∈κ : p(a, ξ, η) = 1 for some p ∈G}.
Each xa,ξ has a canonical name ˙xa,ξ:
˙xa,ξ(ˇη) = {p ∈P : p(a, ξ, η) = 1}
(η ∈κ).
Then we deﬁne, for every a ∈A,
˜a = {xa,ξ : ξ < κ}
and let ˜A = {˜a : a ∈A}. The sets ˜a and ˜A have obvious canonical names.

15. Applications of Forcing
257
Having deﬁned ˜a for each a ∈A, we can deﬁne ˜x (and its canonical
name ˙˜x) for each x be ∈-induction:
(15.42)
˜x = {˜y : y ∈x}.
We shall show that the function x →˜x is an ∈-isomorphism.
Lemma 15.54. For all x and y, x ∈y if and only if ˜x ∈˜y, and x = y if and
only if ˜x = ˜y.
Proof. First we note that ∥˙xa,ξ = ˙xa′,ξ′∥= 0 whenever (a, ξ) ̸= (a′, ξ′), and
that ∥˙xa,ξ = ˇz∥= 0 for all z ∈M. Consequently, we have ˜a ̸= ˜b whenever
a ̸= b are atoms. We claim that for all x, ˜x ̸= xa,ξ for any a, ξ. If x ∈M,
then ˜x = x and so ˜x ̸= xa,ξ. If x /∈M, then ˜x is of higher rank than any
xa,ξ: xa,ξ is a subset of κ, while the transitive closure of ˜x contains some of
the xa,ξ.
Now we can prove the lemma, simultaneously for ∈and =, by induction
on rank:
(a) If x ∈y, then ˜x ∈˜y follows from the deﬁnition (15.42). If ˜x ∈˜y, then
y cannot be an atom because then we would have ˜x = xa,ξ for some a, ξ,
which is impossible. Hence ˜x = ˜z for some z ∈y and we have x = z by the
induction hypothesis; thus x ∈y.
(b) If x = y, then ˜x = ˜y. Conversely, if x ̸= y, then either both x and y
are atoms and then ˜x ̸= ˜y; or, e.g., x contains some z that is not in y, and
then, by the induction hypothesis, ˜z ∈˜x and ˜z /∈˜y; thus ˜x ̸= ˜y.
⊓⊔
Note that the proof of Lemma 15.54 does not depend on the particular G
and so in fact we have proved
(15.43)
x = y
if and only if
∥˙˜x = ˙˜y∦= 0
if and only if
∥˙˜x = ˙˜y∥= 1
and similarly for ∈.
Now we shall construct a symmetric submodel N of M[G]. We construct N
so that for every x ∈U, ˜x is in N and that (P α(A))U is isomorphic to
(P α( ˜A))N. For every permutation σ of A, let ¯σ be the group of all permuta-
tions π of A × κ such that for all a, ξ,
π(a, ξ) = (σa, ξ′)
for some ξ′.
We let ¯H = {¯σ : σ ∈H} for every subgroup H of G. Since every permuta-
tion π of A × κ induces an automorphism of P by
(πp)(π(a, ξ), η) = p(a, ξ, η)
(all a, ξ, η)
we consider ¯G as a group of automorphisms of B = B(P). For every ﬁnite
A ⊂A × κ we let
ﬁx(E) = {π ∈¯G : π(a, ξ) = (a, ξ) for all (a, ξ) ∈E},

258
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
and we let ¯F be the ﬁlter on ¯G generated by the set
(15.44)
{ ¯H : H ∈F} ∪{ﬁx(E) : E ⊂A × κ ﬁnite}.
Let HS be the class of all hereditarily symmetric names and let N be the
corresponding symmetric submodel of M[G]. It is an immediate consequence
of (15.44) that all ˙xa,ξ, all ˙a (a ∈A), and ˙˜A are symmetric, and so ˜A is in N.
The following two lemmas show that for any x, ˜x is in N if and only if x ∈U.
Lemma 15.55. For all x, x ∈U if and only if ˙˜x ∈HS.
Proof. It suﬃces to show that x is symmetric if and only if ˙˜x is symmetric. If
σ ∈G and π ∈¯σ, then π ˙˜x is the canonical name for (σx)˜, and so sym ¯G(˙˜x) =
symG(x); thus if sym(x) ∈F, then sym ¯G(˙˜x) ∈¯F. On the other hand, if
sym ¯G(˙˜x) ∈
¯F, then sym(x) ⊃¯H ∩ﬁx(E) for some H ∈F and a ﬁnite
E ⊂A × κ. If e = {a ∈A : (a, ξ) ∈E for some ξ}, then sym(x) ⊃H ∩ﬁx(e),
and since ﬁx(e) ∈F, we have sym(x) ∈F.
⊓⊔
Lemma 15.56. For all x, x ∈U if and only if ˜x ∈N.
Proof. By Lemma 15.55, it suﬃces to show that if ˜x ∈N, then x ∈U.
Assume otherwise, and let x be of least rank such that ˜x ∈N and x /∈U.
Thus x ⊂U, and since ˜x ∈N, there exist a name ˙z ∈HS and some p ∈G
such that p ⊩˙z = ˙˜x. Since sym ¯G( ˙z) ∈¯F, we have sym ¯G( ˙z) ⊃¯H ∩ﬁx(E) for
some H ∈F and a ﬁnite E ⊂A × κ. We shall ﬁnd σ ∈G and π ∈¯σ such
that:
(i) πp and p are compatible;
(ii) π ∈¯H ∩ﬁx(E);
(iii) σx ̸= x.
Then we have π ˙z = ˙z by (ii), ∥π ˙˜x = ˙˜x∥= 0 by (iii) and (15.43); and since
πp ⊩π ˙z = π ˙˜x, we have
πp ∪p ⊩˙z = ˙˜x,
πp ∪p ⊩˙z = π ˙˜x,
a contradiction.
To ﬁnd π, note that x is not symmetric, so that there is a σ ∈G such
that σx ̸= x and σ ∈H ∩ﬁx(e), where e = {a ∈A : (a, ξ) ∈E for some ξ}.
Since |p| < κ, there exists a γ < κ such that (a, ξ) /∈dom(p) for all a ∈A
and all ξ > γ. Thus we deﬁne π ∈¯σ as follows:
if a ∈e, then π(a, ξ) = (a, ξ) for all ξ;
if a /∈e, then

π(a, ξ) = π(σa, γ + ξ) and π(a, γ + ξ) = π(σa, ξ) if ξ < γ;
π(a, ξ) = (σa, ξ)
if ξ > γ · 2.
It follows that π ∈¯H ∩ﬁx(E) and that p and πp are compatible.
⊓⊔

We complete the proof of Theorem 15.53 by showing that

(P α(A))U
˜=

P α( ˜A)
N.
The left-hand side is clearly included in the right-hand side; we prove the
converse by induction. Thus let x ∈P α(A) ∩U and let y ∈N be a subset
of x; we shall show that y = ˜z for some z ∈U. Let ˙y be a name for y.
The notion of forcing that we are using here is <κ-closed; and since we have
chosen κ large, it follows that there is a p ∈G that decides ˙˜t ∈˙y for all t ∈x.
Hence y = ˜z, where z = {t ∈x : p ⊩˙˜t ∈˙y}, and by Lemma 15.56 we have
z ∈U.
⊓⊔
As for applications of Theorem 15.53, consider a formula ϕ(X, γ) such
that the only quantiﬁers in ϕ are ∃u ∈P γ(X) and ∀u ∈P γ(X). Let U be
a permutation model such that
U ⊨∃X ϕ(X, γ).
Let X ∈U be such that U ⊨ϕ(X, γ); let α be such that P γ(X) ⊂P α(A). By
the theorem, U can be embedded in a model N of ZF such that (P α(A))U is
isomorphic to (P α( ˜A))N. Since the quantiﬁers in ϕ are restricted to P γ(X),
it follows that N ⊨ϕ( ˜
X, γ), and so
N ⊨∃X ϕ(X, γ).
Therefore, if we wish to prove consistency (with ZF) of an existential state-
ment of the kind just described, it suﬃces to construct a permutation model
(of ZFA).
Note that “X cannot be well ordered,” “X cannot be linearly ordered”
are formulas of the above type and so is “X is a countable set of pairs without
a choice function.”
Theorem 15.53, in conjunction with the construction of permutation mod-
els, has interesting applications in algebra. One can construct various abstract
counterexamples to theorems whose proofs use the Axiom of Choice. For ex-
ample, one can construct a vector space that has no basis, etc.
We conclude this section by sketching two examples of models of ZF in
which the Axiom of Choice fails. The ﬁrst model was constructed by Feferman
and L´evy, the other by Feferman.
Example 15.57. Let M be a transitive model of ZFC. There is a model
N ⊃M such that (ℵ1)N = (ℵω)M; hence ℵ1 is singular in N.
Proof. First we construct a generic extension M[G] by adjoining collapsing
maps fn : ω →ωn, for all n ∈ω: We let (P, ⊃) consist of ﬁnite functions
with domain ⊂ω × ω, such that p(n, i) < ωn for all (n, i) ∈dom(p). If G is
a generic ﬁlter on P, then f =  G is a function on ω × ω, and for every n,

260
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
the function fn deﬁned on ω by fn(i) = f(n, i) maps ω onto ωn. We shall
construct a symmetric model N ⊂M[G] such that each fn is in N but ℵω is
a cardinal in N.
Let G be the group of all permutations π of ω × ω such that for every n,
π(n, i) = (n, j), for some j. Every π induces an automorphism of P by
dom(πp) = {π(n, i) : (n, i) ∈dom(p)},
(πp)(π(n, i)) = p(n, i).
Let F be the ﬁlter on G generated by {Hn : n ∈ω}, where Hn consists of
all π such that π(k, i) = (k, i) for all k ≤n, all i ∈ω. Let HS be the class of
all hereditarily symmetric names and let N be the symmetric model.
It is easy to verify that for each n, the canonical name ˙fn of fn is sym-
metric and so fn ∈N. To show that ℵω remains a cardinal in N, we use the
following lemma:
Lemma 15.58. If sym( ˙x) ⊃Hn and p ⊩ϕ( ˙x), then p↾n ⊩ϕ( ˙x), where p↾n
is the restriction of p to {(k, i) : k ≤n}.
Proof. Let us assume that p↾n does not force ϕ( ˙x) and let q ⊃p↾n be such
that q ⊩¬ϕ( ˙x). It is easy to ﬁnd some π ∈Hn such that πp and q are
compatible; since πp ⊩ϕ(π ˙x) and π ˙x = ˙x, we get a contradiction.
⊓⊔
Now let us assume that g ∈N is a function of ω onto ℵω, and let ˙g be
a symmetric name for g. Let p0 ∈G be such that p0 forces “ ˙g is a function
from ˇω onto ˇℵω.” Let n be such that p0↾n = p0 and that sym(˙g) ⊃Hn. Since
g takes ℵω values, it follows that for some k ∈ω, there exists an incompatible
set W of conditions p ⊃p0 such that |W| ≥ℵn+1, and distinct ordinals αp,
p ∈W, such that for each p ∈W, p ⊩˙g(k) = αp. By Lemma 15.58, we have
p↾n ⊩˙g(k) = αp, for each p ∈W, which is a contradiction: On the one hand,
the conditions p↾n, p ∈W, must be mutually incompatible, and on the other
hand, the set {p↾n : p ∈P} has size only ℵn.
⊓⊔
If the ground model M in the above example satisﬁes GCH, then one can
show that in N, the set of all reals is the countable union of countable sets.
Example 15.59. Let M be a transitive model of ZFC. There is a model
N ⊃M such that in N, there is no nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on ω.
Proof. The model N is obtained by adjoining to M inﬁnitely many generic
reals an, n < ω, without putting in N the set {an : n ∈ω} (unlike in Exam-
ple 15.52 where {an : n ∈ω} is in N). First we construct M[G] as in Exam-
ple 15.52: (P, ⊃) is the set of all ﬁnite 0–1 functions with domain ⊂ω × ω.
Let G be generic and let an = {m : p(n, m) = 1 for some p ∈G}, for each
n ∈ω.
Now let N be as follows. Every X ⊂ω × ω induces a symmetry σX, an
automorphism of P deﬁned by
(σXp)(n, m) =

p(n, m)
if (n, m) /∈X,
1 −p(n, m)
if (n, m) ∈X.

Let G be the group of all σX, X ⊂ω×ω, and let F be the ﬁlter on G generated
by {ﬁx(E) : E ⊂ω ﬁnite}, where ﬁx(E) = {σX : X ∩(E ×ω) = ∅}. Let N be
the symmetric model.
Let D ∈N be an ultraﬁlter on ω; we shall show that D is principal. Let
˙D ∈HS be a name for D and let p ∈G be such that p forces “ ˙D is an
ultraﬁlter on ˇω.” Let E ⊂ω be ﬁnite, such that sym( ˙D) ⊃ﬁx(E), and let
n /∈E. Then there is some q ≤p, q ∈G, that decides ˙an ∈˙D (where ˙an is
the canonical name for an). For example, assume that q ⊩˙an ∈˙D (the proof
is similar if q ⊩˙an /∈˙D).
Let m0 be such that for all m ≥m0, (n, m) /∈dom(q), and let X =
{(n, m) : m ≥m0}. Let ˙bn = σX(˙an). Since for each m ≥m0, ∥ˇm ∈˙bn∥=
−∥ˇm ∈˙an∥, it follows that an ∩bn is a ﬁnite set. However, σXq ⊩σX ˙an ∈
σX ˙D; it is fairly obvious that σXq = q and since σX ∈ﬁx(E), we have
σX ˙D = ˙D. Thus q ⊩˙bn ∈˙D and hence an ∩bn ∈D. Consequently, D is
principal.

15.16. Let (P, <) be the notion of forcing that adds a subset of ω1 (15.2), and let

[Another way to show that (P, <) from (15.2) adjoins a one-to-one mapping

15.17. Let P be the forcing that adds a subset of ω1, and let Q be the forcing that
adds a Suslin tree as in (15.9). Then B(P) = B(Q).
If T1 and T2 are trees, then an isomorphism π : T1 →T2 between T1 and T2 is
a one-to-one mapping of T1 onto T2 such that x < y if and only if π(x) < π(y). An
isomorphism maps level α of T1 onto level α of T2 (for all α); and if b is a branch
in T1, then π(b) is a branch in T2. An automorphism of T is an isomorphism
of T1 onto T2. A tree T is rigid if it has no nontrivial automorphism, i.e., the only
automorphism of T is the identity mapping. T is homogeneous if for any x, y at
the same level of T, there exists an automorphism π of T such that π(x) = y.
15.18. If T is a normal α-tree where α < ω1 is a limit ordinal and if π is a nontrivial

only if T1 ⊃T2 and <T1 = <T2 ∩(T2 × T2). If G is a generic set of conditions, then
T = S{T : T ∈G} is a Suslin tree. The crucial properties to verify are: (a) (P, <)

Historical Notes
The forcing that adds Cohen reals is due to Cohen. Shortly after Cohen’s discoveries,
Solovay (in [1963]) noticed that Cohen’s construction of a model for 2ℵ0 = ℵ2 can
be generalized so that for a regular cardinal κ one obtains a model of with 2κ = λ
(assuming 2<κ = κ and λκ = λ in the ground model).
The relation between the chain condition and preservation of cardinals is ba-
sically due to Cohen; the observation that a λ-closed notion of forcing does not
produce new subsets of λ is due to Solovay. The Product Lemma 15.9 is due to
Solovay [1970]. Theorem 15.15 comes from general topology and is due to Engelk-
ing and Karlowicz [1965].
Easton’s Theorem (Theorem 15.18) was published in [1970]. The generalization
of Cohen’s method allowing a class of forcing conditions is due to Easton. The L´evy
collapse (Theorem 15.22) was constructed by L´evy; cf. [1970].
Suslin’s Problem was formulated by Suslin in [1920]. Tennenbaum [1968] and
Jech [1967] discovered models of set theory in which a Suslin line exists; Solovay and
Tennenbaum [1971] proved that existence of a Suslin line is not provable in ZFC.
Subsequently, Jensen proved that a Suslin line exists in the constructible universe
(cf. [1968, 1972]).
The present proof of Theorem 15.23 is as in Jech [1967] (countable conditions);
Tennenbaum’s proof (ﬁnite conditions) is presented in Exercises 15.21 and 15.22.
Random reals were introduced by Solovay [1970]. Forcing with perfect trees to
obtain a minimal degree (Theorem 15.34) is due to Sacks [1971].

15. Applications of Forcing
265
Theorem 15.46 is due to Vopˇenka and appears in the book [1972] of Vopˇenka
and H´ajek.
The idea of using symmetry arguments to construct models in which the Axiom
of Choice fails goes back to Fraenkel [1922b]; the two examples of models of ZFA (an
inﬁnite set of atoms without a countable subset, and a countable set of pairs that
has no choice function) are basically due to him. Further examples of permutation
models were given by Mostowski who (in [1939]) developed a theory of such models.
The present deﬁnition using ﬁlters was given by Specker [1957].
Cohen incorporated the symmetry arguments into his method and constructed
the model in Example 15.52. The formulation of Cohen’s method in terms of sym-
metric submodels of Boolean-valued models is due to Scott (unpublished) and
Jech [1971a]; the latter’s version was a reformulation of a topological version of
Vopˇenka and H´ajek [1965].
Theorem 15.53 is due to Jech and Sochor [1966a, 1966b]. Numerous applications
of the theorem are given in the second paper [1966b]. The method has been gen-
eralized by Pincus in [1971] and in [1972], extending further the analogy between
permutations models of ZFA and symmetric models of ZF.
L´evy showed that in Cohen’s model in Example 15.52 every set can be linearly
ordered; consequently, Halpern and L´evy [1971] proved that the Prime Ideal Theo-
rem holds in the model. Example 15.57 (singularity of ℵ1) is due to Feferman and
L´evy [1963]. Example 15.59 (independence of the Prime Ideal Theorem) is due to
Feferman [1964/65]. A. Blass constructed in [1977] a model, similar to Feferman’s
model, in which every ultraﬁlter is principal.
Exercise 15.15: Jensen [1965].
Exercise 15.20: Fukson [1971].
Exercises 15.25–15.28: Jensen [1969].
The results in Exercises 15.31 and 15.32 had been known before forcing; see
Sikorski [1964].

16. Iterated Forcing and Martin’s Axiom
In this chapter we introduce two related concepts: iterated forcing and Mar-
tin’s Axiom. Iteration of forcing is one of the basic techniques used in appli-
cations of forcing. It was ﬁrst used by Solovay and Tennenbaum in their proof
of the independence of Suslin’s Hypothesis. The idea is to repeat the generic
model construction transﬁnitely many times. Such iterations are described in
the ground model.
Martin observed that many properties of a generic extension obtained by
iteration follow from a single axiom that captures the combinatorial content
of the model. The general principle has become known as Martin’s Axiom.
Martin’s Axiom has become a favorite tool in combinatorial set theory and
set-theoretic topology. Its consistency is proved by iterated forcing.
Two-Step Iteration
The basic observation is that a two-step iteration can be represented by
a single forcing extension. Let P be a notion of forcing, and let ˙Q ∈V P be
a name for a partial ordering in V P .
Deﬁnition 16.1.
(i) P ∗˙Q = {(p, ˙q) : p ∈P and ⊩P ˙q ∈˙Q},
(ii) (p1, ˙q1) ≤(p2, ˙q2) if and only if p1 ≤p2 and p1 ⊩˙q1 ≤˙q2.
In (i), ⊩P ϕ means that every condition in P forces ϕ; equivalently,
∥ϕ∥B(P ) = 1.
Theorem 16.2. (i) Let G be a V -generic ﬁlter on P, let Q = ˙QG, and let
H be a V [G]-generic ﬁlter on Q. Then
G ∗H = {(p, ˙q) ∈P ∗˙Q : p ∈G and ˙qG ∈H}
is a V -generic ﬁlter on P ∗˙Q and V [G ∗H] = V [G][H].
(ii) Let K be a V -generic ﬁlter on P ∗˙Q. Then
G = {p ∈P : ∃˙q (p, ˙q) ∈K}
and
H = { ˙qG : ∃p (p, ˙q) ∈K}
are, respectively, a V -generic ﬁlter on P and a V [G]-generic ﬁlter on Q = ˙QG,
and K = G ∗H.

268
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Proof. (i) Let us prove that if D ∈V is a dense subset of P ∗Q then D∩(G∗H)
is nonempty. In V [G], let
D1 = { ˙qG : ∃p ∈G such that (p, ˙q) ∈D}.
The set D1 is dense in Q; this is proved by showing that for every ˙q0, the set
(in V )
{p ∈P : ∃˙q1 (p ⊩˙q1 ≤˙q0 and (p, ˙q1) ∈D)}
is dense in P. Hence D1 ∩H ̸= ∅and so there exists some q ∈H such
that for some p ∈G and some G-name ˙q for q, (p, ˙q) ∈D. It follows that
(p, ˙q) ∈D ∩(G ∗H).
(ii) Let D ∈V be dense in P. Then D1 = {(p, ˙q) : p ∈D} is dense in
P ∗˙Q and so D ∩G is nonempty. Hence G is a V -generic ﬁlter on P.
Let D ∈V [G] be dense in Q, and let ˙D ∈V P be a G-name for D such
that ⊩P ˙D is dense in ˙Q. Then the set {(p, ˙q) ∈P ∗˙Q : p ⊩˙q ∈˙D} is dense
in P ∗˙Q and it follows that D ∩H is nonempty. Hence H is V [G]-generic.
The proof of K = G ∗H is routine.
⊓⊔
We shall now describe two-step iteration in terms of complete Boolean
algebras. Let B be a complete Boolean algebra and let ˙C ∈V B be such that
∥˙C is a complete Boolean algebra∥B = 1.
Let us consider all ˙c ∈V B such that ∥˙c ∈˙C∥= 1 and the equivalence relation
(16.1)
˙c1 ≡˙c2
if and only if
∥˙c1 = ˙c2∥= 1.
We let D be the set of equivalence classes for (16.1). We make D a Boolean
algebra as follows: If ˙c1 and ˙c2 are in D, there exists a unique ˙c ∈D such
that ∥˙c = ˙c1 + ˙C ˙c2∥= 1; we let ˙c = ˙c1 +D ˙c2. The operations ·D and −D are
deﬁned similarly. With these operations, D is a Boolean algebra; also,
˙c1 ≤D ˙c2
if and only if
∥˙c1 ≤˙C ˙c2∥= 1.
Lemma 16.3. D is a complete Boolean algebra, and B embeds in D as
a complete subalgebra.
Proof. If X ⊂D, let ˙X ∈V B be such that dom( ˙X) = X and ˙X(˙c) = 1 for
all ˙c ∈X. Since ˙C is a complete Boolean algebra in V B and V B is full, there
exists a ˙c such that ∥˙c = 
˙C ˙X∥= 1. It follows that ˙c = 
D X.
For each b ∈B, let ˙c = π(b) be the unique ˙c ∈D such that
∥˙c = 1 ˙C∥= b
and
∥˙c = 0 ˙C∥= −b;
π is a complete embedding of B into D.
⊓⊔

16. Iterated Forcing and Martin’s Axiom
269
We use the notation D = B ∗˙C. If B = B(P) and in V B, ˙C = B( ˙Q),
then P ∗˙Q embeds densely in B ∗˙C (Exercise 16.1).
Two-step iteration is a generalization of product: If P and Q are two
notions of forcing then P × Q embeds densely in P ∗ˇQ (Exercise 16.2).
If B and D are complete Boolean algebras and B is a complete subalgebra
of D then there exists a ˙C ∈V B that is a complete Boolean algebra in V B,
such that D = B ∗˙C: In V B, let ˙F be the ﬁlter on ˇD generated by the
generic ultraﬁlter ˙G on ˇB, and let ˙C be the quotient of ˇD by ˙F. We denote
this algebra (in V B) ˙C = D : B. D : B is a complete Boolean algebra in V B,
and B ∗(D : B) = D (Exercises 16.3 and 16.4).
It follows that if V [G] and V [H] are two generic extensions of V such that
V [G] ⊂V [H], then V [H] is a generic extension of V [G].
Theorem 16.4. Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal. If P satisﬁes the
κ-chain condition and if in V P , ˙Q satisﬁes the κ-chain condition, then P ∗˙Q
satisﬁes the κ-chain condition.
Proof. Assume that (pα, ˙qα), α < κ, are mutually incompatible in P ∗˙Q.
Let ˙Z ∈V P be the canonical name for the set {α : pα ∈G} (where G is
a generic ﬁlter on P), i.e., ∥α ∈˙Z∥= pα. For every α and every β, either pα
and pβ are incompatible, or every stronger condition forces that ˙qα and ˙qβ
are incompatible. Thus qα and qβ are incompatible if α ∈Z and β ∈Z,
and since Q satisﬁes the κ-chain condition in V [G], we have |Z| < κ; i.e.,
⊩P | ˙Z| < κ.
Since κ is regular in V [G] (by Theorem 15.3), there exists a maximal
antichain W ⊂P, and for each p ∈W there exists some γp < κ such that
p ⊩˙Z ⊂γp. If we let γ = sup{γp : p ∈W}, we have γ < κ, and ⊩P
˙Z ⊂γ.
This is a contradiction, since pγ ⊩γ ∈˙Z.
⊓⊔
The converse of Theorem 16.4 is also true:
Lemma 16.5. If P ∗˙Q satisﬁes the κ-chain condition then ⊩P
˙Q satisﬁes
the κ-chain condition.
Of course P satisﬁes the κ-c.c. because B(P) is a complete subalgebra of
B(P ∗˙Q).
Proof. Let D = B ∗˙C and assume that D satisﬁes the κ-chain condition. Let
˙W ∈V B and b0 ∈B+ be such that
b0 ⊩˙W is a subset of ˙C+ of size κ.
We shall ﬁnd a nonzero b ≤b0 such that
(16.2)
b ⊩˙W is not an antichain.
Let ˙f ∈V B be such that
b0 ⊩˙f is a one-to-one function of κ onto ˙W.

270
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
For every α < κ, b0 ⊩(∃x ∈˙W) x = ˙f(ˇα); and since V B is full, there exists
a ˙cα ∈D such that b0 ⊩(˙cα ∈W and ˙cα = ˙f(ˇα)). Let ˙dα = b0 · ˙cα. Since
b0 ⊩˙cα ̸= ˙cβ, for all α ̸= β, the set { ˙dα : α < κ} is a subset of D of size κ.
Since D satisﬁes the κ-chain condition, there exist α and β such that ˙dα
and ˙dβ are compatible. Hence there exists a ˙d ∈D+ such that ˙d ≤˙dα · ˙dβ;
moreover, we can ﬁnd ˙d such that ˙d = b · ˙c, where 0 ̸= b ≤b0 and b ⊩(˙c ̸= 0
and ˙c ≤˙cα · ˙cβ). Now (16.2) follows.
⊓⊔
Corollary 16.6. If P and Q satisfy the κ-chain condition then P × Q satis-
ﬁes the κ-chain condition if and only if ⊩P ˇQ satisﬁes the κ-chain condition.
⊓⊔
Lemma 16.7. If P is κ-closed and ⊩P ˙Q is κ-closed, then P ∗˙Q is κ-closed.
Proof. Let λ ≤κ and let (p1, ˙q1) ≥(p2, ˙q2) ≥. . . ≥(pα, ˙qα) ≥. . . (α < λ) be
a descending sequence in P ∗˙Q. Then {pα}α<λ is a descending sequence in P,
and has a lower bound p. The condition p forces that { ˙qα}α<λ is a descending
sequence in ˙Q, and has a lower bound ˙q. Then (p, ˙q) is a lower bound of
{(pα, ˙qα)}α<λ.
⊓⊔
Iteration with Finite Support
The idea of transﬁnite iteration of forcing is to construct sequences {Pα}α<θ
of forcing notions so that for every α, Pα+1 = Pα ∗˙Qα where ˙Q ∈V Pα, and
that at limit stages, Pα is a “limit” of {Pβ}β<α. In this section we describe
iteration with ﬁnite support, where the “limit” is the direct limit.
In Deﬁnition 16.8 below, ˙Qα is assumed to be a forcing notion in V Pα,
with greatest element 1. The symbol ≤α denotes the partial ordering of Pα,
and ⊩α denotes the corresponding forcing relation.
Deﬁnition 16.8. Let α ≥1. A forcing notion Pα is an iteration (of length α
with ﬁnite support) if it is a set of α-sequences with the following properties:
(i) If α = 1 then for some forcing notion Q0,
(a) P1 is the set of all 1-sequences ⟨p(0)⟩where p(0) ∈Q0;
(b) ⟨p(0)⟩≤1 ⟨q(0)⟩if and only if p(0) ≤q(0) (in Q0).
(ii) If α = β + 1 then Pβ = Pα↾β = {p↾β : p ∈Pα} is an iteration of
length β, and there is some forcing notion ˙Qβ ∈V Pβ such that
(a) p ∈Pα if and only if p↾β ∈Pβ and ⊩β p(β) ∈˙Qβ;
(b) p ≤α q if and only if p↾β ≤β q↾β and p↾β ⊩β p(β) ≤q(β).
(iii) If α is a limit ordinal, then for every β < α, Pβ = Pα↾β = {p↾β :
p ∈Pα} is an iteration of length β and
(a) p ∈Pα if and only if ∀β < α p↾β ∈Pβ and for all but ﬁnitely
many β < α, ⊩β p(β) = 1;
(b) p ≤α q if and only if ∀β < α p↾β ≤β q↾β.

The ﬁnite set {β < α : not ⊩β p(β) = 1} is the support of p ∈Pα.
An iteration with ﬁnite support is uniquely determined by the sequence
⟨˙Qβ : β < α⟩. Thus we call Pα the iteration of ⟨˙Qβ : β < α⟩. For each β < α,
Pβ+1 is isomorphic to Pβ ∗˙Qβ. When α is a limit ordinal, (Pα, ≤α) is the
direct limit of the Pβ, β < α, in the sense of Lemma 12.2. In fact B(Pα) is
the completion of the direct limit of the B(Pβ), β < α (Exercise 16.8).
Finite support iteration preserves chain conditions:
Theorem 16.9. Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal. Let Pα be the it-
eration with ﬁnite support of ⟨˙Qβ : β < α⟩, such that for each β < α,
⊩β ˙Qβ satisﬁes the κ-chain condition. Then Pα satisﬁes the κ-chain condi-
tion.
Proof. By induction on α. If α = β + 1 then Pα = Pβ ∗˙Qβ and the assertion
follows from Theorem 16.4. Thus let α be a limit ordinal. For each p ∈Pα,
let s(p) denote the support of p.
Let W = {pξ : ξ < κ} be a subset of Pα of size κ. If cf α ̸= κ then
there exist a β < α and some Z ⊂W of size κ such that s(p) ⊂β for each
p ∈Z. Then {p↾β : β ∈Z} ⊂Pβ and since Pβ satisﬁes the κ-chain condition,
there exist p and q in Z such that p↾β and q↾β are compatible (in Pβ). Since
s(p) ⊂β and s(q) ⊂β, p and q are compatible.
Thus assume that cf α = κ, and let {αξ : ξ < κ} be a normal sequence
with limit α. Let C ⊂κ be the closed unbounded set of all η such that
s(pξ) ⊂αη for all ξ < η. For each limit ξ ∈C there is some γ(ξ) < ξ such
that s(pξ) ∩αξ ⊂αγ(ξ). By Fodor’s Theorem there exist a stationary set
S ⊂C and some γ < κ such that s(pξ) ∩αξ ⊂αγ for all ξ ∈S.
Now consider the set {pξ↾αγ : ξ ∈S}. This is a subset of Pαγ, of size κ,
and therefore there exist ξ and η in S, γ < ξ < η, such that pξ↾αγ and pη↾αγ
are compatible. Let q ∈Pαγ be a condition stronger than both pξ↾αγ and
pη↾αγ, and consider the following α-sequence r:
(16.3)
r(β) =
⎧
⎪
⎪
⎨
⎪
⎪
⎩
q(β)
if β < αγ,
pξ(β)
if αγ ≤β < αη,
pη(β)
if αη ≤β < α.
It is easily veriﬁed that r is a condition in Pα and is stronger than both pξ
and pη. Thus pξ and pη are compatible, and W is not an antichain.
⊓⊔
Theorem 16.9 gives the following corollary for complete Boolean algebras:
Corollary 16.10. Let B0 ⊂B1 ⊂. . . ⊂Bβ ⊂. . . (β < α) be a sequence of
complete Boolean algebras such that for all β < γ, Bβ is a complete subal-
gebra of Bγ, and that for each limit ordinal γ, 
β<γ Bβ is dense in Bγ. If
every Bβ satisﬁes the κ-chain condition then 
β<α Bβ satisﬁes the κ-chain
condition.

Martin’s Axiom
Deﬁnition 16.11 (Martin’s Axiom (MA)). If (P, <) is partially ordered
set that satisﬁes the countable chain condition and if D is a collection of
fewer than 2ℵ0 dense subsets of P, then there exists a D-generic ﬁlter on P.
By Lemma 14.4, if (P, <) is any partial ordering and if D is a countable
collection of dense subsets of P, then a D-generic ﬁlter on P exists. Hence
Martin’s Axiom is a consequence of the Continuum Hypothesis. Exercises
16.10 and 16.11 show that the restriction to fewer than continuum dense sets
as well as some restriction on (P, <) are necessary.
If κ is an inﬁnite cardinal, let MAκ be the statement
(16.4)
If (P, <) is a partially ordered set that satisﬁes the countable chain
condition, and if D is a collection of at most κ dense subsets of P,
then there exists a D-generic ﬁlter on P.
MAℵ0 is true by Lemma 14.4, and Martin’s Axiom states that MAκ holds
for all κ < 2ℵ0. Exercise 16.10 shows that MAκ implies that κ < 2ℵ0.
Lemma 16.12. Martin’s Axiom is equivalent to its restriction to partial or-
ders of cardinality < c:
(16.5)
If (P, <) is a partially ordered set that satisﬁes the countable chain
condition and |P| < 2ℵ0, and if D is a collection of at most κ dense
subsets of P, then there exists a D-generic ﬁlter on P.
Proof. Let P be a c.c.c. partially ordered set and let us assume that (16.5)
holds. Let D be a family of fewer than c dense subsets of P. For each D ∈
D, we let WD be a maximal incompatible subset of D. Since each WD is
countable, there exists a set Q ⊂P of size < c such that WD ⊂Q for
all D ∈D, and if p, q ∈Q are compatible, then there exists some r ∈Q
such that r ≤p and r ≤q. Each WD is a maximal antichain in Q; let
ED = {q ∈Q : q ≤w for some w ∈WD}. Each ED is dense in Q.
The partially ordered set Q has size at most κ and satisﬁes the countable
chain condition. By (16.5) there is a ﬁlter G on Q that meets every ED.
G generates a D-generic ﬁlter on P.
⊓⊔
We will now show that MA is consistent with 2ℵ0 > ℵ1:
Theorem 16.13 (Solovay and Tennenbaum). Assume GCH and let κ
be a regular cardinal greater than ℵ1. There exists a c.c.c. notion of forc-
ing P such that the generic extension V [G] by P satisﬁes Martin’s Axiom
and 2ℵ0 = κ.
As P satisﬁes the countable chain condition, the model V [G] preserves
cardinals and coﬁnalities.

16. Iterated Forcing and Martin’s Axiom
273
Proof. We construct P as a ﬁnite support iteration of length κ, of a certain
(yet to be determined) sequence ⟨˙Qα : α < κ⟩. At each stage, we’ll have
⊩α ˙Qα satisﬁes the countable chain condition, and so P will satisfy c.c.c. as
well. We shall also have, for each α < κ, ⊩α | ˙Qα| < κ. It follows, by induction
on α, that |Pα| ≤κ for every α ≤κ: If α is a limit ordinal and if |Pβ| ≤κ for
all β < α, then |Pα| ≤κ since the elements of Pα are α-sequences with ﬁnite
support. Thus assume that |Pα| ≤κ and let us prove |Pα+1| ≤κ. Because
Pα satisﬁes c.c.c. and κ is regular, there exists a λ < κ such that ⊩α | ˙Qα| ≤λ.
Every name ˙q for an element of ˙Qα can be represented by a function from an
antichain in Pα into λ. As every antichain in Pα is countable, the number of
such functions is at most κℵ0 which is κ (by GCH). It follows that |Pα+1| ≤κ;
in fact |B(Pα+1)| ≤κ.
Note that because GCH holds in V , and because Pα is a c.c.c. forcing of
size ≤κ, we have ⊩α 2λ ≤κ, for every λ < κ. In particular, ⊩P 2ℵ0 ≤κ.
We shall now deﬁne the ˙Qα, by induction on α < κ. Let us ﬁx a function π
that maps κ onto κ × κ such that if π(α) = (β, γ) then β ≤α. For every
α < κ, the model V Pα has at most κ nonisomorphic partial orderings of
size < κ (because ⊩α κ<κ = κ). Since Pα satisﬁes c.c.c., there are at most κ
distinct names in V Pα for such partial orderings.
Thus let us assume that α < κ and that ⟨˙Qβ : β < α⟩has been de-
ﬁned. Let π(α) = (β, γ). Let ˙Q be the γth name in V Pβ for a partial order
with a greatest element 1, of size < κ. Let b = ∥˙Q satisﬁes the countable
chain condition∥Pα and let ˙Qα ∈V Pα be such that ∥˙Qα = ˙Q∥Pα = b and
∥˙Qα = {1}∥Pα = −b.
Now let P be the ﬁnite support iteration of ⟨˙Qα : α < κ⟩. We shall prove
that V P satisﬁes Martin’s Axiom as well as 2ℵ0 = κ. Let G be a generic ﬁlter
on P, and let Gα = G↾Pα for all α < κ.
Lemma 16.14. If λ < κ and X ⊂λ is in V [G] then X ∈V [Gα] for some
α < κ.
Proof. Let ˙X be a name for X. Every Boolean value ∥ξ ∈˙X∥(where ξ < λ)
is determined by a countable antichain in P and hence ˙X is determined by
at most λ conditions in P. Every condition has ﬁnite support which in turn
is included in some α < κ. Therefore there exists some α < κ such that all
these λ conditions have support included in α. It follows that X has a name
in V Pα; hence X ∈V [Gα].
⊓⊔
Lemma 16.15. Let (Q, <) ∈V [G] and D ∈G be such that (Q, <) is a c.c.c.
partial order, |Q| < κ and |D| < κ. There exists in V [G] a D-generic ﬁlter
on Q.
Once we prove Lemma 16.15, we ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 16.13 as
follows: Let Q be the forcing for adding one Cohen generic real; Q is countable.
For any set X ⊂{0, 1}ω of size < κ, let DX = {Dg : g ∈X} where Dg =
{q ∈Q : q ̸⊂g} (see Exercise 16.10). Lemma 16.15 applied to DX shows

274
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
that X ̸= {0, 1}ω and therefore V [G] satisﬁes 2ℵ0 ≥κ. However, we already
proved that 2ℵ0 ≤κ, and so V [G] ⊨2ℵ0 = κ. Thus V [G] satisﬁes (16.5) and
therefore MA, completing the proof.
⊓⊔
Proof of Lemma 16.15. By Lemma 16.14, both (Q, <) and D are in V [Gβ],
for some β < κ. Let ˙Q be a name for Q in V Pβ. We may assume that Q has
a greatest element, and let γ be such that ˙Q is the γth name for such partial
order. Let α be such that π(α) = (β, γ). As Q satisﬁes the countable chain
condition in V [G], it also satisﬁes the countable chain condition in V [Gα].
Thus Q = ˙QGα
α .
In V [Gα+1] there is a generic ﬁlter H on Q over V [Gα], because Pα+1 =
Pα ∗˙Qα. The ﬁlter H meets every dense subset of Q that is in V [Gα], and
therefore it meets every D ∈D. Hence H is D-generic.
⊓⊔
Independence of Suslin’s Hypothesis
Suslin’s Hypothesis (SH) is the statement there are no Suslin lines. In Chap-
ter 15 we showed that the negation of SH is consistent; by the following
theorem, SH is independent.
Theorem 16.16. If MAℵ1 holds, then there is no Suslin tree.
Proof. Let us assume that T is a normal Suslin tree and let PT be the partially
ordered set obtained from T by reversing the order. PT satisﬁes the countable
chain condition. For each α < ω1, let Dα be the union of all levels above α:
Dα = {x ∈T : o(x) > α}. Each Dα is dense in PT ; if we let D = {Dα :
α < ω1} and if G is a D-generic ﬁlter on P, then G is a branch in T of
length ω1. A contradiction.
⊓⊔
The proof of independence of SH was the ﬁrst application of iterated
forcing (and led to the formulation of Martin’s Axiom). The model for SH,
due to Solovay and Tennenbaum [1971], was constructed by iteration of the
forcing notions PT , for all prospective Suslin trees in the ﬁnal model. The
forcing PT “kills” the Suslin tree T by forcing an ω1-branch in T .
In the proof of the following theorem, Suslin trees are killed by a diﬀerent
method: by specializing the tree. Recalling the deﬁnition in Chapter 9 (and
Exercise 9.9), an Aronszajn tree T is special if there exists a function f :
T →ω such that each f−1({n}) is an antichain.
Theorem 16.17 (Baumgartner, Malitz, and Reinhardt [1970]).
If
MAℵ1 holds, then every Aronszajn tree is special.
Lemma 16.18. If T is an Aronszajn tree and W is an uncountable collection
of ﬁnite pairwise disjoint subsets of T , then there exist S, S′ ∈W such that
any x ∈S is incomparable with any y ∈S′.

16. Iterated Forcing and Martin’s Axiom
275
Proof. Since uncountably many elements of W have the same size, we may
as well assume that there exists a natural number n such that |S| = n for
all S ∈W; furthermore let us consider a ﬁxed enumeration {z1, . . . , zn} of
each set S ∈W. Let D be an ultraﬁlter on W such that every X ∈D is
uncountable.
Let us assume that the lemma is false. For each x ∈T and each k = 1,
. . . , n, let Yx,k be the set of all S ∈W such that x is comparable with the
kth element of S. Since any S and S′ contain comparable elements, we have

x∈S
n
k=1
Yx,k = W
for every S ∈W. Thus pick, for each S ∈W, an element x = xS of S
and k = kS such that Yx,k ∈D. Now, there is k ≤n such that the set
Z = {S ∈W : kS = k} is uncountable. We shall show that the elements xS,
S ∈Z, are pairwise comparable; and that will be a contradiction since T has
no uncountable branch.
If S1, S2 ∈Z and x = xS1, y = xS2, then Y = Yx,k∩Yy,k is in the ultraﬁlter
and thus uncountable. If S ∈Y , then the kth element of S is comparable
with both x and y. Since Y is uncountable, there must exist S ∈Y such that
the kth element of S is greater than both x and y. But then it follows that
x and y are comparable.
⊓⊔
Let T be an Aronszajn tree and let us consider the following notion of
forcing (P, <): Forcing conditions are functions p such that
(i) dom(p) is a ﬁnite subset of T ;
(ii) ran(p) ⊂ω;
(iii) if x, y ∈dom(p) and x and y are comparable, then p(x) ̸= p(y);
(iv) p is stronger than q if and only if p extends q.
(16.6)
Lemma 16.19. (P, <) satisﬁes the countable chain condition.
Proof. Let W be an uncountable subset of P. Note that the set {dom(p) :
p ∈W} is uncountable (there are only countably many functions from a ﬁ-
nite set into ω). By ∆-Lemma, there is an uncountable W1 ⊂W, and a ﬁ-
nite set S ⊂T such that dom(p) ∩dom(q) = S for any distinct elements
p, q ∈W1. Then there is an uncountable W2 ⊂W1 such that p↾S = q↾S for
any p, q ∈W2. By Lemma 16.18 there exist p and q ∈W2 such that any
x ∈dom(p) −S is incomparable with any y ∈dom(q) −S. Then p ∪q is
a function that satisﬁes (16.6) and extends both p and q. Thus p and q are
compatible elements of W and so (P, <) satisﬁes the countable chain condi-
tion.
⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 16.17. For each x ∈T , let Dx be the set of all p ∈P such
that x ∈dom(p); clearly, each Dx is dense in P. Let D = {Dx : x ∈T }.

276
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
It follows from MAℵ1, that (P, <) has a D-generic ﬁlter G. The elements
of G are pairwise compatible and since G is D-generic, every x ∈T is in the
domain of the function f =  G. The function f maps T into ω and witnesses
that T is a special Aronszajn tree.
⊓⊔
More Applications of Martin’s Axiom
Theorem 16.20 (Martin-Solovay). Martin’s Axiom implies that c is reg-
ular, and 2κ = c for all inﬁnite cardinals κ < c.
Proof. Assuming MA, we prove that 2κ = 2ℵ0 for every κ < 2ℵ0. Regularity
of c follows, as cf 2ℵ0 = cf 2κ > κ for all κ < 2ℵ0. Let κ < 2ℵ0 and let
{Aα : α < κ} be an almost disjoint family of subsets of ω.
Let X be a subset of κ. We shall ﬁnd a set A ⊂ω such that for all α < κ
(16.7)
α ∈X
if and only if
A ∩Aα is inﬁnite.
In other words, X = {α ∈κ : A ∩Aα is inﬁnite} is “coded” by the set A.
Therefore there exists a mapping of P(ω) onto P(κ), and so 2κ ≤2ℵ0.
Let (P, <) be the following notion of forcing: A condition is a function p
from a subset of ω into {0, 1} such that:
(i) dom(p) ∩Aα is ﬁnite for every α ∈X;
(ii) {n : p(n) = 1} is ﬁnite.
(16.8)
The set P is partially ordered by reverse inclusion: p ≤q if and only if p
extends q.
We ﬁrst show that P satisﬁes the countable chain condition. If p and q
are incompatible, then {n : p(n) = 1} ̸= {n : q(n) = 1} and since there are
only countably many ﬁnite subsets of ω, it follows that P satisﬁes c.c.c.
For each β ∈κ −X, let Dβ = {p ∈P : Aβ ⊂dom(p)}. Any q ∈P can
be extended to some p ∈Dβ: Simply let p(n) = 0 for all n ∈Aβ −dom(p).
Since Aβ is almost disjoint from all Aα, α ∈X, p has property (16.8)(i) and
hence is a condition. Thus each Dβ is dense.
For each α ∈X and each k ∈ω, let
Eα,k = {p ∈P : {n ∈Aα : p(n) = 1} has size at least k}.
It is easy to see that each Eα,k is dense in P.
Let D be the collection of all Dβ for β ∈κ −X and all Eα,k for α ∈X
and k ∈ω. By MA, there exists a D-generic ﬁlter G on P. Note that f =  G
is a function on a subset of ω. We let
(16.9)
A = {n : f(n) = 1} = {n : p(n) = 1 for some p ∈G}.
If α ∈X, then A∩Aα is inﬁnite because for each k there is some p ∈G∩Eα,k.
If β ∈κ −X, then A ∩Aβ is ﬁnite because for some p ∈G, Aβ ⊂dom(p)
and {n : p(n) = 1} is ﬁnite.
⊓⊔

The almost disjoint forcing deﬁned in the proof of Theorem 16.20 is of-
ten used to code generically uncountable sets. A typical application is the
following:
Let V [X] be a generic extension where X ⊂ω1; furthermore, assume that
ωV [X]
1
= ω1. Let A = {Aα : α < ω1} be an almost disjoint family in V , and
let us consider the almost disjoint forcing P in V [X]. If G ⊂P is generic
over V [X], then V [X][G] = V [X][A], where A is deﬁned by (16.9). Note that
ωV [X][A]
1
= ω1.
Now in V [X][A], the set X satisﬁes (16.7), and since A ∈V , it follows
that X ∈V [A], and we have V [X][A] = V [A]. Thus we have found a generic
extension V [A] such that A ⊂ω and X ∈V [A]. See Exercise 16.15.
The next theorem shows that under MAℵ1, countable chain condition is
preserved by products. Compare with Exercise 15.28.
Theorem 16.21. MAℵ1 implies that every partially ordered set that satisﬁes
the countable chain condition has property (K).
Proof. Let P be a partially ordered set that satisﬁes the countable chain
condition and let W = {wα : α < ω1} be an uncountable subset of P. We
will use MAℵ1 to ﬁnd a ﬁlter G such that Z = G ∩W is uncountable.
First we claim that there is some p0 ∈W such that every p ≤p0 is
compatible with uncountably many wα. Otherwise, for each α < ω1 there is
β > α and some vα ≤wα which is incompatible with all wγ, γ ≥β; then
we can construct an ω1-sequence {vαi : i < ω1} of pairwise incompatible
elements.
For each α < ω1, let
Dα = {p ≤p0 : p ≤wγ for some γ ≥α}.
By the above claim, each Dα is dense below p0. By MAℵ1, there exists a ﬁl-
ter G on P such that p0 ∈G and G ∩Dα ̸= ∅for all α < ω1. It follows that
G ∩W is uncountable. Hence P has property (K).

The next result generalizes the Baire Category Theorem:
Theorem 16.23. Martin’s Axiom implies that the intersection of fewer
than c dense open sets of reals is dense.
Proof. Let κ < c and let Uα, α < κ, be dense open sets of reals. Let I be
a bounded open interval. We’ll show that 
α<κ Uα ∩I ̸= ∅. Let P be the
following notion of forcing: Conditions are nonempty open sets p such that
p ⊂I, with p ≤q if and only if p ⊂q. Since every collection of disjoint

278
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
open sets is at most countable, P satisﬁes the countable chain condition. For
each α < κ, let Dα = {p ∈P : p ⊂Uα}; each Dα is dense in P. Let G be
a D-generic ﬁlter on P where D = {Dα : α < κ}. Since G is a ﬁlter, the
intersection {p : p ∈G} is nonempty, and is contained in each Uα since
G ∩Dα ̸= ∅.

If f and g are functions from ω to ω, we say that f eventually dominates g
if f(n) > g(n) for all but ﬁnitely many n ∈ω (i.e., f > g in the notation of

Proof. Lemma 10.16.
⊓⊔
The proof of Theorem 16.24 uses the Hechler forcing: Let G be a given
family of functions h : ω →ω. A forcing condition is a pair p = (s, E),
where s = ⟨s(0), . . . , s(n −1)⟩is a ﬁnite sequence of natural numbers and
E is a ﬁnite subset of G. A condition (s′, E′) is stronger than (s, E) if:
(i) s ⊂s′, and E ⊂E′;
(ii) if k ∈dom(s′) −dom(s), then s(k) > h(k) for all h ∈E.
(16.10)
If (s1, E1) and (s2, E2) are conditions and s1 = s2, then (s1, E1) and
(s2, E2) are compatible. Hence (P, <) satisﬁes the countable chain condition.
Let G ⊂P be generic; we let f = {s : (s, E) ∈G for some E}. We claim
that G is eventually dominated by f. Let h ∈G be arbitrary. First there
is a condition (s, E) ∈G such that h ∈E (by genericity). Secondly, every
condition (s′, E′) < (s, E) satisﬁes (16.10)(ii), and so f(k) > g(k) for all
k /∈dom(s). Thus in V [G], there is f : ω →ω such that h < f for all h ∈G.
Proof of Theorem 16.24. If G ⊂ωω and |G| < c, let P be the Hechler forcing
for the family G. Let D = {Dh : h ∈G} ∪{En : n ∈ω} where Dh = {(s, E) :
h ∈E} and En = {(s, E) : n ∈dom(s)}. Then if G is a D-generic ﬁlter,
the function f = {s : (s, E) ∈G for some E} eventually dominates all
h ∈G.

Proof. Let Aα, α < 2ℵ0, be an enumeration of all decreasing sequences
{An}∞
n=0 of subsets of ω. We construct, by induction on α < 2ℵ0, a chain
of families G0 ⊂. . . ⊂Gα ⊂. . . of nonempty subsets of ω, such that each Gα
is closed under ﬁnite intersections and |Gα| < 2ℵ0 for all α.
We let G0 = {X ⊂ω : ω −X is ﬁnite}. If α is a limit ordinal, we let

Aα = {An}∞
n=0 be a decreasing sequence of subsets of ω. If some An is
disjoint from some X ∈Gα, then we let Gα+1 = Gα. Otherwise, the family
G = Gα ∪{An : n ∈ω} has the ﬁnite intersection property and we claim (see
Lemma 16.28 below), that there exists a Z ⊂ω such that Z −An is ﬁnite
for all n, and G′ = G ∪{Z} has the ﬁnite intersection property. Then we let
Gα+1 consist of all ﬁnite intersections X1 ∩. . . ∩Xk of elements of G′.
Finally, we let G = {Gα : α < 2ℵ0}, and let D be any ultraﬁlter such
that D ⊃G. We claim that D is a p-point: If A0 ⊃A1 ⊃. . . An ⊃. . . is any
decreasing sequence of elements of D, then {An}∞
n=0 = Aα for some α < 2ℵ0
and we have Z ∈Gα+1 such that Z −An is ﬁnite for all n. By Exercise 7.7,
D is a p-point.
⊓⊔
It remains to prove the claim:
Lemma 16.28. Assume MA, and let G be a family of subsets of ω with the
ﬁnite intersection property such that |G| < 2ℵ0. Let A0 ⊃A1 ⊃. . . An ⊃. . .
be a decreasing sequence of elements of G. Then there exists a Z ⊂ω such
that:
(i) G ∪{Z} has the ﬁnite intersection property;
(ii) Z −An is ﬁnite for all n ∈ω.
Proof. We may assume that that if X, Y ∈G, then X ∩Y ∈G. For each
X ∈G, let hX : ω →ω be some function such that hX(n) ∈X ∩An.
By Theorem 16.24 the family {hX : X ∈G} is eventually dominated by
a function f; in particular for every X ∈G there exists some n such that
f(n) ≥hX(n). Now we let Z = ∞
n=0{k ∈An : k ≤f(n)}. It is readily
veriﬁed that Z −An is ﬁnite for each n, and that Z ∩X ̸= ∅for every X ∈G.

Iterated Forcing
We conclude this chapter with the general deﬁnition of iterated forcing. We
shall return to the general method in later chapters. Below we follow closely
Deﬁnition 16.8 of ﬁnite support iteration. As before, for each ordinal α ≥1,
Pα denotes an iteration of length α, ≤α is the partial ordering of Pα and ⊩α is
the corresponding forcing relation, and ˙Qα is a name in V Pα for a forcing
notion with a greatest element 1. The general deﬁnition diﬀers from Deﬁni-
tion 16.8 by its handling of limit stages.

280
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Deﬁnition 16.29. Let α ≥1. A forcing notion Pα is an iteration (of
length α) if it is a set of α-sequences with the following properties:
(i) If α = 1 then for some forcing notion Q0,
(a) P1 is the set of all 1-sequences ⟨p(0)⟩where p(0) ∈Q0;
(b) ⟨p(0)⟩≤1 ⟨q(0)⟩if and only if p(0) ≤q(0).
(ii) If α = β + 1 then Pβ = Pα↾β = {p↾β : p ∈Pα} is an iteration of
length β, and there is some forcing notion ˙Qβ ∈V Pβ such that
(a) p ∈Pα if and only if p↾β ∈Pβ and ⊩β p(β) ∈˙Qβ;
(b) p ≤α q if and only if p↾β ≤β q↾β and p↾β ⊩β p(β) ≤q(β).
(iii) If α is a limit ordinal, then for every β < α, Pβ = Pα↾β = {p↾β :
p ∈Pα} is an iteration of length β and
(a) the α-sequence ⟨1, 1, . . . , 1, . . .⟩is in Pα;
(b) if p ∈Pα, β < α and if q ∈Pβ is such that q ≤β p↾β, then
r ∈Pα where for all ξ < α, r(ξ) = q(ξ) if ξ < β and r(ξ) = p(ξ) if
β ≤ξ < α;
(c) p ≤α q if and only if ∀β < α p↾β ≤β q↾β.
Clearly, an iteration with ﬁnite support is an iteration. In general, prop-
erty (iii)(b) guarantees that if Pβ = Pα↾β then V Pβ ⊂V Pα; see Exer-
cise 16.17.
A general iteration depends not only on the ˙Qβ but also on the limit
stages of the iteration. Let Pα be an iteration of length α where α is a limit
ordinal. Pα is a direct limit if for every α-sequence p,
(16.11)
p ∈Pα
if and only if
∃β < α p↾β ∈Pβ and ∀ξ ≥β p(ξ) = 1.
Pα is an inverse limit if for every α-sequence p,
(16.12)
p ∈Pα
if and only if
∀β < α p↾α ∈Pβ.
In practice, forcing iterations combine direct and inverse limits. Finite sup-
port iterations are exactly those that use direct limits at all limit stages. In
general, let s(p), the support of p ∈Pα, be the set of all β < α such that it is
not the case that ⊩β p(β) = 1. If I is an ideal on α containing all ﬁnite sets
then an iteration with I-support is an iteration that satisﬁes for every limit
ordinal γ ≤α,
(16.13)
p ∈Pγ
if and only if
∀β < γ p↾β ∈Pβ and s(p) ∈I.
One of the most useful tools in forcing are iterations with countable support,
where in (16.13) I is the ideal of at most countable sets. A countable support
iteration is an iteration such that for every limit ordinal γ if cf γ = ω then Pγ
is an inverse limit, and if cf γ > ω then Pγ is a direct limit. We shall return
to countable support iterations later in the book.
The following generalizes Theorem 16.9:

16. Iterated Forcing and Martin’s Axiom
281
Theorem 16.30. Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal and let α be a limit
ordinal. Let Pα be an iteration such that for each β < α, Pβ = Pα↾β satisﬁes
the κ-chain condition. If Pα is a direct limit, and either cf α ̸= κ or (if
cf α = κ) for a stationary set of β < α, Pβ is a direct limit, then Pα satisﬁes
the κ-chain condition.
Proof. Exactly as the proof of Theorem 16.9. The only diﬀerence is that we
apply Fodor’s Theorem not to C, but to the stationary subset of C consisting
of all ξ such that Pαξ is a direct limit.

Historical Notes
Iterated forcing was introduced by Solovay and Tennenbaum [1971]. The formu-
lation in terms of Boolean algebras is based on their paper. Our presentation of
general iteration (Deﬁnitions 16.8 and 16.29) follows Baumgartner [1983].
Following Solovay and Tennenbaum’s construction of a model in which there
are no Suslin trees (Theorem 16.13), Martin formulated an axiom (MAℵ1) which
implies that there are no Suslin trees, and whose consistency was obtained by
Solovay-Tennenbaum’s method. The consistency proof of MA + 2ℵ0 > ℵ1 appears
in Solovay and Tennenbaum [1971].
Martin’s Axiom is investigated in detail in the paper [1970] of Martin and
Solovay. The paper contains various equivalent formulations of Martin’s Axiom and
numerous applications (including Theorem 16.20). Theorem 16.21 was discovered
by Kunen, Rowbottom, Solovay and possibly others.

16. Iterated Forcing and Martin’s Axiom
283
Baumgartner, Malitz, and Reinhardt [1970] proved that MAℵ1 implies that
every Aronszajn tree is special (Theorem 16.17). Special Aronszajn trees have ap-
plications in model theory (this fact is due to Rowbottom and Silver) and are
investigated in Mitchell’s paper [1972/73].
Scales were investigated extensively by Hechler [1974]. Hechler introduced the
notion of forcing used in the proof of Theorem 16.24. Hechler, among others, showed
that if cf κ > ω, then there is a generic extension in which 2ℵ0 > κ and a κ-scale
exists.
The construction of p-points (and Ramsey ultraﬁlters) under the assumption
of Martin’s Axiom is due to Booth [1970]. Our proof of Theorem 16.27 follows
Ketonen [1976].

17. Large Cardinals
The theory of large cardinals plays central role in modern set theory. In
this chapter we begin a systematic study of large cardinals. In addition to
combinatorial methods, the proofs use techniques from model theory.
Ultrapowers and Elementary Embeddings
We start with the following theorem that introduced the technique of ultra-
powers to the study of large cardinals.
Theorem 17.1 (Scott). If there is a measurable cardinal then V ̸= L.
Ultrapowers were introduced in Chapter 12. We now generalize the tech-
nique to construct ultrapowers of the universe. Let U be an ultraﬁlter on
a set S and consider the class of all functions with domain S. Following
(12.3) and (12.4) we deﬁne
f =∗g
if and only if
{x ∈S : f(x) = g(x)} ∈U,
f ∈∗g
if and only if
{x ∈S : f(x) ∈g(x)} ∈U.
For each f, we denote [f] the equivalence class of f in =∗(recall (6.4)):
[f] = {g : f =∗g and ∀h (h =∗f →rank g ≤rank h)}.
We also use the notation [f] ∈∗[g] when f ∈∗g.
Let Ult = UltU(V ) be the class of all [f], where f is a function on S, and
consider the model Ult = (Ult, ∈∗). Lo´s’s Theorem 12.3 holds in the present
context as well: If ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) is a formula of set theory, then
Ult ⊨ϕ([f1], . . . , [fn])
if and only if
{x ∈S : ϕ(f1(x), . . . , fn(x))} ∈U.
If σ is a sentence, then Ult ⊨σ if and only if σ holds; the ultrapower
is elementarily equivalent to the universe (V, ∈). The constant functions ca
are deﬁned, for every set a, by (12.12), and the function j = jU : V →Ult,
deﬁned by jU(a) = [ca] is an elementary embedding of V in Ult:
(17.1)
ϕ(a1, . . . , an)
if and only if
Ult ⊨ϕ(ja1, . . . , jan)
whenever ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) is a formula of set theory.

286
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
The most important application of ultrapowers in set theory are those in
which (Ult, ∈∗) is well-founded. As we show below, well-founded ultrapowers
are closely related to measurable cardinals.
The model UltU(V ) is well-founded if (i) every nonempty set X ⊂Ult
has a ∈∗-minimal element, and (ii) ext(f) is a set for every f, where
ext(f) = {[g] : g ∈∗f}.
The second condition is clearly satisﬁed for any ultraﬁlter U: For every g ∈∗f
there is some h =∗g such that rank h ≤rank f. As for the condition (i), this
is satisﬁed if and only if there exists no inﬁnite descending ∈∗-sequence
f0 ∋∗f1 ∋∗. . . ∋∗fk ∋∗. . .
(k ∈ω)
of elements of the ultrapower.
Lemma 17.2. If U is a σ-complete ultraﬁlter, then (Ult, ∈∗) is a well-
founded model.
Proof. We shall show that there is no inﬁnite descending ∈∗-sequence in Ult
if U is a σ-complete ultraﬁlter on S. Let us assume that f0, f1, . . . , fn, . . .
is such a descending sequence. Thus for each n, the set
Xn = {x ∈S : fn+1(x) ∈fn(x)}
is in the ultraﬁlter. Since U is σ-complete, the intersection X = ∞
n=0 Xn is
also in U and hence nonempty; let x be an arbitrary element of X. Then we
have
f0(x) ∋f1(x) ∋f2(x) ∋. . .
an inﬁnite descending ∋-sequence, which is a contradiction.
⊓⊔
By the Mostowski Collapsing Theorem every well-founded model is iso-
morphic to a transitive model. Thus if U is σ-complete, there exists a one-
to-one mapping π of Ult onto a transitive class such that f ∈∗g if and only
π([f]) ∈π([g]). In order to simplify notation, we shall identify each [f] with
its image π([f]). Thus if U is σ-complete, the symbol Ult denotes the transi-
tive collapse of the ultrapower, and for each function f on S, [f] is an element
of the transitive class Ult; we say the function f represents [f] ∈Ult.
Thus if U is a σ-complete ultraﬁlter, M = UltU(V ) is an inner model and
j = jU is an elementary embedding j : V →M.
If α is an ordinal, then since j is elementary, j(α) is an ordinal; moreover,
α < β implies j(α) < j(β). Thus we have α ≤j(α) for every ordinal num-
ber α. Note that j(α + 1) = j(α)+1, and j(n) = n for all natural numbers n.
It is also easy to see that j(ω) = ω: If [f] < ω, then f(x) < ω for almost
all x ∈S, and by σ-completeness, there exists n < ω such that f(x) = n for
almost all x. By the same argument, if U is λ-complete, then j(γ) = γ for all
γ < λ.

17. Large Cardinals
287
Now let κ be a measurable cardinal, and let U be a nonprincipal κ-com-
plete ultraﬁlter on κ. Let d (the diagonal function) be the function on κ
deﬁned by
d(α) = α
(α < κ).
Since U is κ-complete every bounded subset of κ has measure 0 and so for
every γ < κ, we have d(α) > γ for almost all α. Hence [d] > γ for all γ < κ
and thus [d] ≥κ. However, we clearly have [d] < j(κ) and it follows that
j(κ) > κ.
We have thus proved that if there is a measurable cardinal, then there
is an elementary embedding j of the universe in a transitive model M such
that j is not the identity mapping; j is a nontrivial elementary embedding of
the universe.
Proof of Theorem 17.1. Let us assume V = L and that measurable cardinals
exist; let κ be the least measurable cardinal. Let U be a nonprincipal κ-
complete ultraﬁlter on κ and let j : V →M be the corresponding elementary
embedding. As we have shown, j(κ) > κ.
Since V = L, the only transitive model containing all ordinals is the
universe itself: V = M = L. Since j is an elementary embedding and κ is the
least measurable cardinal, we have
M ⊨j(κ) is the least measurable cardinal;
and hence, j(κ) is the least measurable cardinal. This is a contradiction since
j(κ) > κ.
⊓⊔
If there exists a measurable cardinal, then there exists a nontrivial elemen-
tary embedding of the universe. Let us show that conversely, if j : V →M is
a nontrivial elementary embedding then there exists a measurable cardinal.
Lemma 17.3. If j is a nontrivial elementary embedding of the universe, then
there exists a measurable cardinal.
Proof. Let j : V →M be a nontrivial embedding. Notice that there exists an
ordinal α such that j(α) ̸= α; otherwise, we would have rank(jx) = rank(x)
for all x, and then we could prove by induction on rank that j(x) = x for
all x.
Thus let κ be the least ordinal number such that j(κ) ̸= κ (and hence
j(κ) > κ). It is clear that j(n) = n for all n and j(ω) = ω since 0, n + 1,
and ω are absolute notions and j is elementary. Hence κ > ω. We shall show
that κ is a measurable cardinal.
Let D be the collection of subsets of κ deﬁned as follows:
(17.2)
X ∈D
if and only if
κ ∈j(X)
(X ⊂κ).
Since κ < j(κ), i.e., κ ∈j(κ), we have κ ∈D; also ∅/∈D because j(∅) = ∅.
Using the fact that j(X ∩Y ) = j(X) ∩j(Y ) and that j(X) ⊂j(Y ) whenever

288
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
X ⊂Y , we see that D is a ﬁlter: If κ ∈j(X) and κ ∈j(Y ), then κ ∈j(X∩Y );
if X ⊂Y and κ ∈j(X), then κ ∈j(Y ). Similarly, j(κ −X) = j(κ) −j(X)
and thus D is an ultraﬁlter.
D is a nonprincipal ultraﬁlter: For every α < κ, we have j({α}) =
{j(α)} = {α}, and so κ /∈j({α}) and we have {α} /∈D. We shall now
show that D is κ-complete. Let γ < κ and let X = ⟨Xα : α < γ⟩be a se-
quence of subsets of κ such that κ ∈j(Xα) for each α < γ. We shall show
that 
α<γ Xα ∈D. In M (and thus in V ), j(X) is a sequence of length j(γ)
of subsets of j(κ); for each α < γ, the j(α)th term of j(X) is j(Xα). Since
j(α) = α for all α < γ and j(γ) = γ, it follows that j(X) = ⟨j(Xα) : α < γ⟩.
Hence if X = 
α<γ Xα, we have j(X) = 
α<γ j(Xα). Now it is clear that
κ ∈j(X) and hence X ∈D.
⊓⊔
The construction of a κ-complete ultraﬁlter from an elementary embed-
ding yields the following commutative diagram (17.3):
Lemma 17.4. Let j : V →M be a nontrivial elementary embedding, let κ be
the least ordinal moved, and let D be the ultraﬁlter on κ deﬁned in (17.2). Let
jD : V →Ult be the canonical embedding of V in the ultrapower UltD(V ).
Then there is an elementary embedding k of Ult in M such that k(jD(a)) =
j(a) for all a:
(17.3)
Ult

M
j

jD
?
-

3
Proof. For each [f] ∈Ult, let
(17.4)
k([f]) = (j(f))(κ).
(Here f is a function on κ and j(f) is a function on j(κ).)
We shall ﬁrst show that deﬁnition (17.4) does not depend on the choice
of f representing [f]. If f =D g, then the set X = {α : f(α) = g(α)} is in D
and hence κ is in the set
j(X) = {α < j(κ) : (jf)(α) = (jg)(α)}.
Therefore (jf)(κ) = (jg)(κ).
Next we show that k is elementary. Let ϕ(x) be a formula and let Ult ⊨
ϕ([f]); we shall show that M ⊨ϕ(k([f])). The set X = {α : ϕ(f(α))} is in D
and hence κ belongs to the set
j(X) = {α < j(κ) : M ⊨ϕ((jf)(α))}.
Since (jf)(κ) = k([f]), we have M ⊨ϕ(k([f])).

17. Large Cardinals
289
Finally, we show that k(jD(a)) = j(a) for all a. Since jD(a) = [ca], where
ca is the constant function on κ with value a, we have k(jD(a)) = (j(ca))(κ).
Now j(ca) is the constant function on j(κ) with value j(a) and hence
(j(ca))(κ) = j(a).
⊓⊔
We remark that the measure D = {X ⊂κ : κ ∈j(X)} deﬁned from
an elementary embedding is normal: Let f be a regressive function on some
X ∈D. Then (jf)(κ) < κ, and if γ = (jf)(κ), then f(α) = γ for almost
all α.
Normality can be expressed in terms of ultrapowers:
Lemma 17.5. Let D be a nonprincipal κ-complete ultraﬁlter on κ. Then the
following are equivalent:
(i) D is normal.
(ii) In the ultrapower UltD(V ),
κ = [d]
where d is the diagonal function.
(iii) For every X ⊂κ, X ∈D if and only if κ ∈jD(X).
Proof. (i) implies (ii): Every function f ∈∗d is regressive, and hence repre-
sents an ordinal γ < κ.
(ii) implies (iii): If X ⊂κ, then X ∈D if and only if d(α) ∈X for almost
all α, that is, if and only if [d] ∈jD(X). If [d] = κ, we get X ∈D if and only
if κ ∈jD(X).
(iii) implies (i): If D = {X ⊂κ : κ ∈jD(X)} then D is normal, by the
remark preceding the lemma.
⊓⊔
Let j : V →M be an elementary embedding. If X is a class deﬁned by
a formula ϕ, then j(X) is the class of the model M, deﬁned in M by the same
formula ϕ. Note that j(X) = 
α∈Ord j(X ∩Vα). In particular, M = j(V ).
Lemma 17.6. Let j be an elementary embedding of the universe and let κ
be the least ordinal moved (i.e., j(κ) > κ). If C is a closed unbounded subset
of κ, then κ ∈j(C).
Proof. Since j(α) = α for all α < κ, we have j(C) ∩κ = C. Thus j(C) ∩κ
is unbounded in κ; and because j(C) is closed (in j(V ) and hence in the
universe), we have κ ∈j(C).
⊓⊔
A consequence of Lemma 17.6 is that the set of all regular cardinals below
a measurable cardinal κ is stationary (cf. Lemma 10.21): Let X ⊂κ be the
set of all regular cardinals below κ. Since κ is regular in M, we have κ ∈j(X),
and κ ∈j(X ∩C) for every closed unbounded C ⊂κ. Hence X is stationary.
Similarly, as κ is Mahlo, it is Mahlo in M, and if X is now the set of all
Mahlo cardinals below κ, it follows that X is stationary.

290
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
More generally, if M(X) denotes the Mahlo operation
(17.5)
M(X) = {α : X ∩α is stationary in α}
where X is any class of ordinals, the above argument shows that if κ ∈j(X)
then κ ∈M(X) (Exercise 17.7).
The next theorem shows that there exists no nontrivial elementary em-
bedding of V into V . As the statement “there exists an elementary embedding
of V ” is not expressible in the language of set theory, the theorem needs to be
understood as a theorem in the following modiﬁcation of ZFC: The language
has, in addition to ∈, a function symbol j, the axioms include Separation and
Replacement Axioms for formulas that contain the symbol j, and axioms that
state that j is an elementary embedding of V .
Theorem 17.7 (Kunen). If j : V →M is a nontrivial elementary embed-
ding, then M ̸= V .
First we prove the following lemma:
Lemma 17.8. Let λ be an inﬁnite cardinal such that 2λ = λℵ0. There exists
a function F : λω →λ such that whenever A is a subset of λ of size λ and
γ < λ, there exists some s ∈Aω such that F(s) = γ.
Proof. Let {(Aα, γα) : α < 2λ} be an enumeration of all pairs (A, γ) where
γ < λ and A is a subset of λ of size λ. We deﬁne, by induction on α, a sequence
sα, α < 2λ, of elements of λω as follows: If α < 2λ, then since λℵ0 = 2λ > |α|,
there exists an sα ∈Aω
α such that sα ̸= sβ for all β < α.
For each α < 2λ, we deﬁne F(sα) = γα (and let F(s) be arbitrary if s is
not one of the sα). The function F has the required property: If A ⊂λ has
size λ and γ < λ, then (A, γ) = (Aα, γα) for some α, and then γα = F(sα).
⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 17.7. Let us assume that j is a nontrivial elementary em-
bedding of V in V . Let κ = κ0 be the least ordinal moved; κ0 is measurable,
and so are κ1 = j(κ0), κ2 = j(κ1), and every κn, where κn+1 = j(κn). Let
λ = limn→∞κn. Since j(⟨κn : n < ω⟩) = ⟨j(κn) : n < ω⟩= ⟨κn+1 : n < ω⟩,
we have j(λ) = limn→∞j(κn) = λ. Let G = {j(α) : α < λ}; we shall use the
set G and Lemma 17.8 to obtain a contradiction.
The cardinal λ is the limit of a sequence of measurable cardinals and hence
is a strong limit cardinal. Since cf λ = ω, we have 2λ = λℵ0. By Lemma 17.8
there is a function F : λω →λ such that F(Aω) = λ for all A ⊂λ of size λ.
Since j is elementary, and j(ω) = ω and j(λ) = λ, the function j(F) has the
same property. Thus, considering the set A = G, there exists s ∈Gω such
that (jF)(s) = κ.
Now, s is a function, s : ω →G, and hence there is a t : ω →λ such
that s(n) = j(t(n)) for all n < ω. It follows that s = j(t). Thus we have
κ = (jF)(jt) = j(F(t)); in other words, κ = j(α) where α = F(t). However,
this is impossible since j(α) = α for all α < κ, and j(κ) > κ.

Let us now consider ultrapowers and the corresponding elementary em-
beddings jU : V →Ult. To introduce the following lemma, let us observe
that if j : V →M and if κ is the least ordinal moved, then j(x) = x for
every x ∈Vκ, and j(X) ∩Vκ = X for every X ⊂Vκ. Hence V M
κ+1 = Vκ+1
(and P M(κ) = P(κ)).
Lemma 17.9. Let U be a nonprincipal κ-complete ultraﬁlter on κ, let M =
UltU(V ) and let j = jU be the canonical elementary embedding of V in M.
(i) M κ ⊂M, i.e., every κ-sequence ⟨aα : α < κ⟩of elements of M is
itself a member of M.
(ii) U /∈M.
(iii) 2κ ≤(2κ)M < j(κ) < (2κ)+.
(iv) If λ is a limit ordinal and if cf λ = κ, then j(λ) > limα→λ j(α); if
cf λ ̸= κ, then j(λ) = limα→λ j(α).
(v) If λ > κ is a strong limit cardinal and cf λ ̸= κ, then j(λ) = λ.
Proof. (i) Let ⟨aξ : ξ < κ⟩be a κ-sequence of elements of M. For each
ξ < κ, let gξ be a function that represents aξ, and let h be a function that
represents κ:
[gξ] = aξ,
[h] = κ.
We shall construct a function F such that [F] = ⟨aξ : ξ < κ⟩. We let, for each
α < κ,
F(α) = ⟨gξ : ξ < h(α)⟩.
Since for each α, F(α) is an h(α)-sequence, [F] is a κ-sequence. Let ξ < κ; we
want to show that the ξth term of [F] is aξ. Since [h] > ξ, we have ξ < h(α)
for almost all α; and for each α such that ξ < h(α), the ξth term of F(α)
is gξ(α). But [cξ] = ξ and [gξ] = aξ, and we are done.
(ii) Assume that U ∈M, and let us consider the mapping e of κκ onto j(κ)
deﬁned by e(f) = [f]. Since κκ ∈M and U ∈M, the mapping e is in M.
It follows that M ⊨|j(κ)| ≤2κ. This is a contradiction since κ < j(κ) and
j(κ) is inaccessible in M.
(iii) 2κ ≤(2κ)M holds because P M(κ) = P(κ) and M ⊂V ; (2κ)M is less
than j(κ) since j(κ) is inaccessible in M; ﬁnally, we have |j(κ)| = 2κ and
hence j(κ) < (2κ)+.
(iv) If cf λ = κ, let λ = limα→κ λα and let f(α) = λα for all α < κ.
Then [f] > j(λα) for all α < κ and [f] < j(λ). If cf λ > κ, then for every
f : κ →λ there exists α < λ such that [f] < j(α). If cf λ = γ < κ, let
λ = limν→γ λν; for every f : κ →λ there exists (by κ-completeness) ν < γ
such that [f] < j(λν).
(v) For every α < λ, the ordinals below α are represented by functions
f : κ →α; hence |j(α)| ≤|ακ| < λ; by (iv) we have j(λ) = limα→λ j(α) = λ.
⊓⊔

Note that in (v) it suﬃces to assume that cf λ ̸= κ and ακ < λ for all
cardinals α < λ.
Let us recall (Lemma 10.18) that a measurable cardinal is weakly com-
pact. We now prove a stronger result:
Theorem 17.10. Every measurable cardinal κ is weakly compact and if D is
a normal measure on κ then the set {α < κ : α is weakly compact} is in D.
Proof. The ﬁrst statement was proved in Lemma 10.18. Let D be a normal
measure on κ, and let jD : V →M be the canonical embedding. Since
P M(κ) = P(κ), it follows that κ is weakly compact in M, and since [d]D = κ,
we have {α : α is weakly compact} ∈D.
⊓⊔
The following two results show that the existence of measurable cardinals
inﬂuences cardinal arithmetic:
Lemma 17.11. Let κ be a measurable cardinal. If 2κ > κ+, then the set
{α < κ : 2α > α+} has measure one for every normal measure on κ.
Consequently, if 2α = α+ for all cardinals α < κ, then 2κ = κ+.
Proof. Let D be a normal measure on κ, and let M = UltD(V ). If 2α = α+
for almost all α, then, since [d]D = κ, we have M ⊨2κ = κ+. In other words,
there is a one-to-one mapping in M between P M(κ) and (κ+)M. However,
P M(κ) = P(κ) and (κ+)M = κ+ (because P M(κ) = P(κ)), and so 2κ = κ+.
⊓⊔
Lemma 17.12. Let κ be a measurable cardinal, let D be a normal measure
on κ and let j : V →M be the corresponding elementary embedding. Let
λ > κ be a strong limit cardinal of coﬁnality κ. Then 2λ < j(λ).
Proof. Since cf λ = κ, we have j(λ) > λ. We shall show that 2λ = λκ ≤
(λκ)M ≤(λj(κ))M < j(λ). The ﬁrst equality holds because λ is strong limit.
We have λκ ≤(λκ)M because every function f : κ →λ is in M. As for the
last inequality, we have
M ⊨j(λ) is a strong limit cardinal
and since λ < j(λ) and j(κ) < j(λ), we have M ⊨λj(κ) < j(λ).
⊓⊔

Weak Compactness
We shall investigate weakly compact cardinals in some detail, and give a char-
acterization of weakly compact cardinals that explains the name “weakly
compact.” This aspect of weakly compact cardinals has, as many other large
cardinal properties, motivation in model theory.

We shall consider inﬁnitary languages which are generalizations of the
ordinary ﬁrst order language. Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal number. The
language Lκ,ω consists of
(i) κ variables;
(ii) various relation, function, and constant symbols;
(iii) logical connectives and inﬁnitary connectives 
ξ<α ϕξ, 
ξ<α ϕξ for
α < κ (inﬁnite disjunction and conjunction);
(iv) quantiﬁers ∃v, ∀v.
The language Lκ,κ is like Lκ,ω except that it also contains inﬁnitary quanti-
ﬁers:
(v) ∃ξ<αvξ, ∀ξ<αvξ for α < κ.
The interpretation of the inﬁnitary symbols of Lκ,κ is the obvious generaliza-
tion of the ﬁnitary case where 
ξ<n ϕξ is ϕ0 ∨. . . ∨ϕn−1, ∃ξ<nvξ stands for
∃v0 . . . ∃vn−1, etc. The language Lω,ω is just the language of the ﬁrst order
predicate calculus.
The ﬁnitary language Lω,ω satisﬁes the Compactness Theorem: If Σ is
a set of sentences such that every ﬁnite S ⊂Σ has a model, then Σ has
a model. Let us say that the language Lκ,κ (or Lκ,ω) satisﬁes the Weak
Compactness Theorem if whenever Σ is a set of sentences of Lκ,κ (Lκ,ω) such
that |Σ| ≤κ and that every S ⊂Σ with |S| < κ has a model, then Σ has
a model. Clearly, if Lκ,κ satisﬁes the Weak Compactness Theorem, then so
does Lκ,ω because Lκ,ω ⊂Lκ,κ.
Theorem 17.13.
(i) If κ is a weakly compact cardinal, then the language Lκ,κ satisﬁes the
Weak Compactness Theorem.
(ii) If κ is an inaccessible cardinal and if Lκ,ω satisﬁes the Weak Com-
pactness Theorem, then κ is weakly compact.
Proof. (i) The proof of the Weak Compactness Theorem for Lκ,κ is very much
like the standard proof of the Compactness Theorem for Lω,ω. Let Σ be a set
of sentences of Lκ,κ of size κ such that if S ⊂Σ and |S| < κ, then S has
a model. Let us assume that the language L = Lκ,κ has only the symbols
that occur in Σ; thus |L| = κ.
First we extend the language as follows: For each formula ϕ with free
variables vξ, ξ < α, we introduce new constant symbols cϕ
ξ , ξ < α (Skolem
constants); let L(1) be the extended language. Then we do the same for each
formula of L(1) and obtain L(2) ⊃L(1). We do the same for each n < ω, and
then let L∗= ∞
n=1 L(n). Since κ is inaccessible, it follows that |L∗| = κ.
L∗has the property that for each formula ϕ with free variables vξ, ξ < α,
there are in L∗constant symbols cϕ
ξ , ξ < α (which do not occur in ϕ).

294
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
For each ϕ(vξ, . . .)ξ<α let σϕ be the sentence (a Skolem sentence)
(17.6)
∃ξ<αvξ ϕ(vξ, . . .)ξ<α →ϕ(cϕ
ξ , . . .)ξ<α
and let Σ∗= Σ ∪{σϕ : ϕ is a formula of L∗}.
Note that if S ⊂Σ∗and |S| < κ, then S has a model: Take a model for
S∩Σ (for L) and then expand it to a model for L∗by interpreting the Skolem
constants so that each sentence (17.6) is true.
Let {σα : α < κ} be an enumeration of all the sentences in L∗. Let (T, ⊂)
be the binary κ-tree consisting of all t : γ →{0, 1}, γ < κ, for which there
exists a model A of Σ ∩{σα : α ∈dom(t)} such that for all α ∈dom(t)
t(α) = 1
if and only if
A ⊨σα.
Since κ has the tree property, there exists a branch B in T of length κ. Let
∆= {σα : t(α) = 1 for some t ∈B}.
Clearly, Σ∗⊂∆. Let A0 be the set of all constant terms of L∗, and let ≈be
the equivalence relation on A0 deﬁned by
τ1 ≈τ2
if and only if
(τ1 ≈τ2) ∈∆,
and let A = A0/≈.
We make A into a model A for L∗as follows:
A ⊨P[[τ1], . . . , [tn]]
if and only if
P(τ1, . . . , τn) ∈∆
and similarly for function and constant symbols. The proof is then completed
by showing that A is a model for ∆(and hence for Σ). The proof of
(17.7)
A ⊨σ
if and only if
σ ∈∆
is done by induction on the number of quantiﬁer blocks in σ: If σ =
∃ξ<αvξ ϕ(vξ, . . .), then by induction hypothesis we have
A ⊨σ(cϕ
ξ , . . .)ξ<α
if and only if
σ(cϕ
ξ , . . .)ξ<α ∈∆
and (17.7) follows.
(ii) Let κ be inaccessible and assume that the language Lκ,ω satisﬁes the
Weak Compactness Theorem. We shall show that κ has the tree property.
Let (T, <) be a tree of height κ such that each level of T has size < κ.
Let us consider the Lκ,ω language with one unary predicate B and constant
symbols cx for all x ∈T . Let Σ be the following set of sentences:
¬(B(cx) ∧B(cy))
for all x, y ∈T that are incomparable,

x∈Uα B(cx)
for all α < κ, where Uα is the αth level of T
(Σ says that B is branch in T of length κ). If S ⊂Σ and |S| < κ, then we
get a model for S by taking a suﬃciently large initial segment of T and some
branch in this segment. By the Weak Compactness Theorem for Lκ,ω, Σ has
a model, which obviously yields a branch of length κ.

Indescribability
Let n > 0 be a natural number and let us consider the nth order predicate
calculus. There are variables of orders 1, 2, . . . , n, and the quantiﬁers are
applied to variables of all orders. An nth order formula contains, in addition
to ﬁrst order symbols and higher order quantiﬁers, predicates X(z) where
X and z are variables of order k + 1 and k respectively (for any k < n).
Satisfaction for an nth order formula in a model A = (A, P, . . . , f, . . . , c, . . .)
is deﬁned as follows: Variables of ﬁrst order are interpreted as elements of
the set A, variables of second order as elements of P(A) (as subsets of A),
etc.; variables of order n are interpreted as elements of P n−1(A). The predi-
cate X(z) is interpreted as z ∈X. A Πn
m formula is a formula of order n + 1
of the form
(17.8)
∀X ∃Y . . .



m quantiﬁers
ψ
where X, Y , . . . are (n + 1)th order variables and ψ is such that all quantiﬁed
variables are of order at most n. Similarly, a Σn
m formula is as in (17.8), but
with ∃and ∀interchanged.
We shall often exhibit a sentence σ and claim that it is Πn
m (or Σn
m)
although it is only equivalent to a Πn
m (or Σn
m) sentence, in the following
sense: We are considering a speciﬁc type of models in which σ is interpreted
(e.g., the models (Vα, ∈)) and there is a Πn
m (or Σn
m) sentence σ such that
the equivalence σ ↔σ holds in all these models.
Note that every ﬁrst order formula is equivalent to some Π0
n formula (and
also to some Σ0
k formula).
Deﬁnition 17.14. A cardinal κ is Πn
m-indescribable if whenever U ⊂Vκ
and σ is a Πn
m sentence such that (Vκ, ∈, U) ⊨σ, then for some α < κ,
(Vα, ∈, U ∩Vα) ⊨σ.
Lemma 17.15. Every measurable cardinal is Π2
1-indescribable.
Proof. Let κ be a measurable cardinal, let U ⊂Vκ and let σ be a Π2
1 sentence
of the (third order) language {∈, U}. Let us assume that (Vκ, ∈, U) ⊨σ.
We have σ = ∀X ϕ(X) where X is a third order variable and ϕ(X) con-
tains only second and ﬁrst order quantiﬁers. Thus
(17.9)
∀X ⊂Vκ+1 (Vκ+1, ∈, X, Vκ, U) ⊨˜ϕ
where ˜ϕ is the (ﬁrst order) sentence obtained from ϕ by replacing the ﬁrst
order quantiﬁers by the restricted quantiﬁers ∀x ∈Vκ and ∃x ∈Vκ.
Now let D be a normal measure on κ and let M = UltD(V ). Since
V M
κ+1 = Vκ+1, we know that (17.9) holds also in M. Using the fact that Vκ is

296
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
represented in the ultrapower by the function α →Vα, Vκ+1 by α →Vα+1,
and U by α →U ∩Vα, we conclude that for almost all α,
(17.10)
∀X ⊂Vα+1 (Vα+1, ∈, X, Vα, U ∩Vα) ⊨˜ϕ.
Then, translating (17.10) back into the third order language, we obtain
(Vα, ∈, U ∩Vα) ⊨σ
for almost all, and hence for some, α < κ.
⊓⊔
Lemma 17.16. If κ is not inaccessible, then it is describable by a ﬁrst order
sentence, i.e., Π0
m-describable for some m.
Proof. Let κ be a singular cardinal, and let f be a function with dom(f) =
λ < κ and ran(f) coﬁnal in κ. Let U1 = f and U2 = {λ}, and let σ be
the ﬁrst order sentence saying that U2 is nonempty and that the unique
element of U2 is the domain of U1. Clearly, κ is describable in the sense that
(Vκ, ∈, U1, U2) ⊨σ and there is no α < κ such that (Vα, ∈, U1 ∩Vα, U2 ∩Vα) ⊨
σ. It is routine to ﬁnd a single U ⊂Vκ and an (∈, U)-sentence ˜σ attesting to
the describability of κ.
If κ ≤2λ for some λ < κ, there is a function f that maps P(λ) onto κ.
We let U1 = f and U2 = {P(λ)}; then κ is described by the same sentence
as above.
Finally, κ = ω is describable as follows: (Vκ, ∈) ⊨∀x ∃y x ∈y.
⊓⊔
The converse is also true; cf. Exercise 17.23.
We shall now present a result of Hanf and Scott that shows that Π1
1-
indescribable cardinals are exactly the weakly compact cardinals. First we
need a lemma.
Lemma 17.17. If κ is a weakly compact cardinal, then for every U ⊂Vκ,
the model (Vκ, ∈, U) has a transitive elementary extension (M, ∈, U ′) such
that κ ∈M.
Proof. Let Σ be the set of all Lκ,κ sentences true in the model (Vκ, ∈, U, x)x∈Vκ
plus the sentences
c is an ordinal,
c > α,
(all α < κ).
Clearly |Σ| = κ, and if S ⊂Σ is such that |S| < κ, then S has a model
(namely Vκ, where the constant c can be interpreted as some ordinal greater
than all the α’s mentioned in S).
Hence Σ has a model A = (A, E, U A, xA)x∈Vκ; we may assume that A ⊃
Vκ, E ∩(Vκ × Vκ) = ∈, U A ∩Vκ = U, and xA = x for all x ∈Vκ. Moreover,
Vκ ≺(A, E, U A) because A satisﬁes all formulas true in Vκ of all x ∈Vκ.
If we show that the model (A, E) is well-founded, then the lemma follows.

17. Large Cardinals
297
Here we make use of the expressive power of the inﬁnitary language Lκ,κ: We
consider the sentence
(17.11)
¬∃v0 ∃v1 . . . ∃vn . . . 
n∈ω
(vn+1 ∈vn).
The sentence (17.11) holds in a model A = (A, E) if and only if A is well-
founded. Since Σ contains the sentence (17.11), every model of Σ is well-
founded.
⊓⊔
The converse is also true; this will follow from the proof of Theorem 17.18.
Theorem 17.18 (Hanf-Scott). A cardinal κ is Π1
1-indescribable if and
only if it is weakly compact.
Proof. First we show that every Π1
1-indescribable cardinal is weakly compact.
If κ is Π1
1-indescribable, then by Lemma 17.16, κ is inaccessible, and it suﬃces
to show that κ has the tree property. In fact, by the proof of Theorem 17.13(i)
it suﬃces to consider trees (T, <) consisting of sequences t : γ →{0, 1}, γ < κ.
Let T be such a tree. For every α < κ, the model (Vα, ∈, T ∩Vα) satisﬁes the
Σ1
1 sentence
(17.12)
∃B (B ⊂T and B is a branch of unbounded length).
Namely, let B = {t↾ξ : ξ < α} where t is any t ∈T with domain α. Since κ is
Π1
1-indescribable, the sentence (17.12) holds in (Vκ, ∈, T ) and hence T has
a branch of length κ.
To show that a weakly compact cardinal is Π1
1-indescribable, we use
Lemma 17.17. Let κ be weakly compact, let U ⊂Vκ and let σ be a Π1
1 sen-
tence true in (Vκ, ∈, U). We have σ = ∀X ϕ(X) where X is a second order
variable and ϕ has only ﬁrst order quantiﬁers.
Let (M, ∈, U ′) be a transitive elementary extension of (Vκ, ∈, U) such that
κ ∈M. Since
(∀X ⊂Vκ) (Vκ, ∈, U) ⊨ϕ(X)
and V M
κ
= Vκ, we have
(M, ∈, U ′) ⊨(∀X ⊂Vκ) (Vκ, ∈, U ′ ∩Vκ) ⊨ϕ(X).
Therefore,
(M, ∈, U ′) ⊨∃α (∀X ⊂Vα) (Vα, ∈, U ′ ∩Vα) ⊨ϕ(X),
and so
(Vκ, ∈, U) ⊨∃α (∀X ⊂Vα) (Vα, ∈, U ′ ∩Vα) ⊨ϕ(X).
Hence for some α < κ, (Vα, ∈, U ∩Vα) ⊨σ.
⊓⊔
Corollary 17.19. Every weakly compact cardinal κ is a Mahlo cardinal, and
the set of Mahlo cardinals below κ is stationary.

298
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Proof. Let C ⊂κ be a closed unbounded set. Since κ is inaccessible, (Vκ, ∈, C)
satisﬁes the following Π1
1 sentence:
¬∃F (F is a function from some λ < κ coﬁnally into κ)
and C is unbounded in κ.
By Π1
1-indescribability, there exists a regular α < κ such that C ∩α is un-
bounded in α; hence α ∈C. Thus κ is Mahlo.
Being Mahlo is also expressible by a Π1
1 sentence:
∀X (if X is closed unbounded, then ∃a regular α in X)
and so the same argument as above shows that there is a stationary set of
Mahlo cardinals below κ.
⊓⊔
Corollary 17.20. If κ is weakly compact and if S ⊂κ is stationary, then
there is a regular uncountable λ < κ such that S ∩λ is stationary in λ.
Proof. “κ is regular” is expressible by a Π1
1 sentence in (Vκ, ∈) and so is “κ is
uncountable.” “S is stationary” is Π1
1 in (Vκ, ∈, S): For every C, if C is closed
unbounded, then S ∩C ̸= ∅.
⊓⊔
Lemma 17.21. If κ is weakly compact and if A ⊂κ is such that A ∩α ∈L
for every α < κ, then A is constructible.
Proof. Let A ⊂κ be such that A ∩α ∈L for all α < κ. By Lemma 17.17
there is a transitive model (M, ∈, A′) ≻(Vκ, ∈, A) such that κ ∈M. Consider
the sentence ∀α ∃x (x is constructible and x = A ∩α) and let α = κ.
⊓⊔
Unlike measurability, weak compactness is consistent with V = L:
Theorem 17.22. If κ is weakly compact then κ is weakly compact in L.
Proof. In L, let T = (κ, <T ) be a tree of height κ such that each level of T
has size less than κ. If κ is weakly compact then T has a branch B (in the
universe), and by Lemma 17.21, B ∈L. Hence κ has the tree property in L,
and since κ is inaccessible, it is weakly compact in L.
⊓⊔
Partitions and Models
Let us consider a model A = (A, P A, . . . , F A, . . . , cA, . . .) of a (not necessarily
countable) language L = {P, . . . , F, . . . , c, . . .}. Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal
and let us assume that the universe A of the model A contains all ordinals
α < κ, i.e., κ ⊂A.

Deﬁnition 17.23. A set I ⊂κ is a set of indiscernibles for the model A if
for every n ∈ω, and every formula ϕ(v1, . . . , vn),
A ⊨ϕ[α1, . . . , αn]
if and only if
A ⊨ϕ[β1, . . . , βn]
whenever α1 < . . . < αn and β1 < . . . < βn are two increasing sequences of
elements of I.
Lemma 17.24. Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal and assume that
κ →(α)<ω
2λ
where α is a limit ordinal and λ is an inﬁnite cardinal. Let L be a language
of size ≤λ and let A be a model of L such that κ ⊂A. Then A has a set of
indiscernibles of order-type α.
Proof. Let Φ be the set of all formulas of the language L. We consider
the function F
: [κ]<ω →P(Φ) deﬁned as follows: If x ∈[κ]n and
x = {α1, . . . , αn} where α1 < . . . < αn, then
F(x) = {ϕ(v1, . . . , vn) ∈Φ : A ⊨ϕ[α1, . . . , αn]}.
The function F is a partition into at most 2λ pieces and thus has a homo-
geneous set I ⊂κ of order-type α. It is now easy to verify that I is a set of
indiscernibles for A.
⊓⊔
We shall see later that for a given limit ordinal α, the least κ that satisﬁes
κ →(α)<ω is inaccessible and satisﬁes κ →(α)<ω
λ
for all λ < κ. Now we shall
prove this for Ramsey cardinals.
Lemma 17.25. If κ →(κ)<ω and if λ < κ is a cardinal, then κ →(κ)<ω
λ .
Proof. Let F : [κ]<ω →λ be a partition into λ < κ pieces. We consider the
following partition G of [κ]<ω into two pieces: If α1 < . . . < αk < αk+1 <
. . . < α2k are elements of κ and if F({α1, . . . , αk}) = F({αk+1, . . . , α2k}),
then we let G({α1, . . . , α2k}) = 1; for all other x ∈[κ]<ω, we let G(x) = 0.
Now, let H ⊂κ be a homogeneous set for G, |H| = κ. We claim that
for each k and each x ∈[H]2k, G(x) = 1: This is because |H| = κ > λ, and
therefore we can ﬁnd α1 < . . . < αk < αk+1 < . . . < α2k in H such that
F({α1, . . . , αk}) = F({αk+1, . . . , α2k}).
It follows that H is homogeneous for F: If α1 < . . . < αn and β1 < . . . <
βn are two sequences in H, we choose a sequence γ1 < . . . < γn in H such
that both αn < γ1 and βn < γ1. Then
G({α1, . . . , αn, γ1, . . . , γn}) = G({β1, . . . , βn, γ1, . . . , γn}) = 1,
and hence
F({α1, . . . , αn}) = F({γ1, . . . , γn}) = F({β1, . . . , βn}).

Corollary 17.26. If κ is a Ramsey cardinal and if A ⊃κ is a model of
a language of size < κ, then A has a set of indiscernibles of size κ.
⊓⊔
The combinatorial methods introduced in this section will now be em-
ployed to obtain a result on measurable cardinals considerably stronger than
Scott’s Theorem. It will be shown that if a Ramsey cardinal exists then
V = L fails in a strong way. A more extensive theory will be developed in
Chapter 18.
Let us make a few observations about models with deﬁnable Skolem func-
tions. Let A be a model of a language L such that A ⊃κ and let I ⊂κ be
a set of indiscernibles for A. Let us assume that the model A has deﬁnable
Skolem functions; i.e., for every formula ϕ(u, v1, . . . , vn), where n ≥0, there
exists an n-ary function hϕ in A such that:
(i) hϕ is deﬁnable in A, i.e., there is a formula ψ such that
y = hϕ(x1, . . . , xn)
if and only if
A ⊨ψ[y, x1, . . . , xn]
for all y, x1, . . . , xn ∈A; and
(ii) hϕ is a Skolem function for ϕ.
Let B ⊂A be the closure of I under all functions in L and the functions hϕ
for all formulas ϕ. B is an elementary submodel of A, and in fact is the
smallest elementary submodel of A that includes the set I; we call B the
Skolem hull of I and say that I generates B.
We augment the language of A by adding function symbols for all the
Skolem functions hϕ and call Skolem terms the terms built from variables and
constant symbols (0-ary functions) by applications of functions in L and the
Skolem functions. Since B is an elementary submodel of A, the interpretation
of each Skolem term t is the same in B as in A. For every element x ∈B
there is a Skolem term t and indiscernibles γ1 < . . . < γn, elements of I,
such that x = tA[γ1, . . . , γn] = tB[γ1, . . . , γn]. Now if ψ is a formula of the
augmented language, i.e., if ψ also contains the Skolem terms, it still does not
distinguish between the indiscernibles: If α1 < . . . < αn and β1 < . . . < βn
are two sequences in I, then ψ(α1, . . . , αn) holds (either in A or in B) if and
only if ψ(β1, . . . , βn) holds.
Theorem 17.27 (Rowbottom). If κ is a Ramsey cardinal, then the set of
all constructible reals is countable. More generally, if λ is an inﬁnite cardinal
less than κ, then |P L(λ)| = λ.
Proof. Let κ be a Ramsey cardinal and let λ < κ. Since κ is inaccessible, we
have P L(λ) ⊂Lκ. Consider the model
A = (Lκ, ∈, P L(λ), α)α≤λ.
A is a model of the language L = {∈, Q, cα}α≤λ where Q is a one-place
predicate (interpreted in A as P(λ)∩L) and cα, α ≤λ, are constant symbols

17. Large Cardinals
301
(interpreted as ordinals less than or equal to λ). Since κ is Ramsey, there
exists a set I of size κ of indiscernibles for A.
The model A has deﬁnable Skolem functions: Since κ is inaccessible, Lκ is
a model of ZFC + V = L and therefore has a deﬁnable well-ordering. Thus
let B ⊂Lκ be the elementary submodel of A generated by the set I. Every
element x ∈B is expressible as x = t(γ1, . . . , γn) where t is a Skolem term
and γ1 < . . . < γn are elements of I.
We shall now show that the set S = P L(λ) ∩B has at most λ elements.
Since S is the interpretation in B of the one-place predicate Q, it suﬃces to
show that there are at most λ elements x ∈B such that B ⊨Q(x).
Let t be a Skolem term. Let us consider the truth value of the formula
(17.13)
t(α1, . . . , αn) = t(β1, . . . , βn)
for a sequence of indiscernibles α1 < . . . < αn < β1 < . . . < βn. The
formula (17.13) is either true for all increasing sequences in I or false for
all increasing sequences in I. If (17.13) is true, then it is true for any two
sequences α1 < . . . < αn, β1 < . . . < βn, in I: Pick γ1, . . . , γn bigger than
both αn and βn and then t(α1, . . . , αn) = t(γ1, . . . , γn) = t(β1, . . . , βn). If
(17.13) is false, then we choose κ increasing sequences
α0
1 < . . . < α0
n < α1
1 < . . . < α1
n < . . . < αξ
1 < . . . < αξ
n < . . .
(ξ < κ)
in I and then t(αξ
1, . . . , αξ
n) ̸= t(αη
1, . . . , αη
n) whenever ξ ̸= η. In conclusion,
the set
(17.14)
{t(α1, . . . , αn) : α1 < . . . < αn are in I}
has either one or κ elements.
Now we apply this to evaluate the size of the set S. We know that |S| < κ
because S ⊂P L(λ) ⊂P(λ) and κ is inaccessible. If t is a Skolem term
for which the set (17.14) has size κ, then t(α1, . . . , αn) is not in S, for any
α1 < . . . < αn in I; by indiscernibility, Q(t(α1, . . . , αn)) is true or false
simultaneously for all increasing sequences in I. Thus if t(α1, . . . , αn) ∈S,
the set (17.14) has only one element.
However, since |L| ≤λ, there are at most λ Skolem terms. And since every
x ∈B has the form t(α1, . . . , αn) for some Skolem term and α1 < . . . < αn
in I, it follows that |S| ≤λ.
Thus we have proved that S = QB = P L(λ) ∩B has at most λ elements.
Now B ≺Lκ and |B| = κ; hence the transitive collapse of B is Lκ and we
have an isomorphism
π : B ≃Lκ.
Since each α ≤λ has a name in A, we have λ ∪{λ} ⊂B and so π(X) = X
for each X ⊂λ in B. In particular π(X) = X for all X ∈S; and since
Qπ(B) = π(S) = S, we have
S = P L(λ) ∩π(B) = P L(λ) ∩Lκ = P L(λ).

This completes the proof: On the one hand, we proved that |S| ≤λ; and on
the other hand, |P L(λ)| ≥λ; thus |P L(λ)| = λ.
⊓⊔
Every Ramsey cardinal is weakly compact. Not only is the least Ramsey
cardinal greater than the least weakly compact but, as we show below, there
is a hierarchy of large cardinals below each Ramsey cardinal, exceeding the
least weakly compact.
Deﬁnition 17.28. For every limit ordinal α, the Erd˝os cardinal ηα is the
least κ such that κ →(α)<ω.
We shall prove that each ηα, if it exists, is inaccessible, and if α < β then
ηα < ηβ. Note that κ is a Ramsey cardinal if and only if κ = ηκ.
Lemma 17.29. If κ →(α)<ω, then κ →(α)<ω
2ℵ0 .
Proof. Let f be a partition, f : [κ]<ω →{0, 1}ω. For each n < ω, let fn =
f↾[κ]n, and for each κ < ω, let fn,k : [κ]n →{0, 1} be as follows:
fn,k({α1, . . . , αn}) = h(k),
where h = fn({α1, . . . , αn}).
Let π be a one-to-one correspondence between ω and ω × ω such that if
π(m) = (n, k), then m ≥n; for each m, let gm : [κ]m →{0, 1} be the
partition deﬁned by
gm({α1, . . . , αm}) = fn,k({α1, . . . , αn})
where (n, k) = π(m).
By the assumption, there exists H ⊂κ of order-type α which is homo-
geneous for all gm. We claim that H is homogeneous for f. If not, then
fn({α1, . . . , αn}) ̸= fn({β1, . . . , βn}) for some α’s and β’s in H. Then for
some k, fn,k({α1, . . . , αn}) ̸= fn,k({β1, . . . , βn}), contrary to the assumption
that H is homogeneous for gm, where π(m) = (n, k).
⊓⊔
Lemma 17.30. For every κ < ηα, ηα →(α)<ω
κ .
Proof. Let κ < ηα, and let f : [ηα]<ω →κ. We wish to ﬁnd a homogeneous
set for f of order-type α. Since κ < ηα, there exists g : [κ]<ω →{0, 1} that
has no homogeneous set of order-type α. For each n, let fn = f↾[ηα]n and
gn = g↾[κ]n, and let A be the model (Vηα, ∈, fn, gn)n=0,1,....
By Lemmas 17.29 and 17.24, the model A has a set of indiscernibles H of
order-type α. We shall show that H is homogeneous for f. It suﬃces to show
that for each n, the formula
(17.15)
fn({α1, . . . , αn}) = fn({β1, . . . , βn})
holds in A for any increasing sequence α1 < . . . < αn < β1 < . . . < βn
of indiscernibles: Then if α1 < . . . < αn and α′
1 < . . . < α′
n are arbitrary

17. Large Cardinals
303
in H, we choose β1 < . . . < βn in H such that αn < β1 and α′
n < β1, and
fn({α1, . . . , αn}) = fn({α′
1, . . . , α′
n}) follows from (17.15).
Thus let us assume that the negation of (17.15) holds for any α1 < . . . <
αn < β1 < . . . < βn in H. Let uξ, ξ < α, be increasing n-sequences in H such
that the last element of uξ is less than the ﬁrst element of uη whenever ξ < η.
Let γξ = f(uξ) for all ξ < α, and let G = {γξ : ξ < α}. By indiscernibility,
and since γ0 > γ1 > . . . > γξ > . . . is impossible, we have γ0 < γ1 < . . . <
γξ < . . ..
We shall reach a contradiction by showing that G is homogeneous for g.
For each k, consider the formula
(17.16)
g({f(uξ1), . . . , f(uξk)}) = g({f(uν1), . . . , f(uνk)}).
By indiscernibility, either (17.16) or its negation holds for all increasing se-
quences ξ1 < . . . < ξk < ν1 < . . . < νk. The inequality cannot hold because
g takes only two values, 0 and 1, and three sequences ⟨ξ1, . . . , ξk⟩would give
three diﬀerent values. Thus (17.16) holds, and the same argument as earlier
in this proof shows that g is constant on [G]k.
⊓⊔
Theorem 17.31. Every Erd˝os cardinal ηα is inaccessible, and if α < β then
ηα < ηβ.
Proof. First we claim that ηα is a strong limit cardinal. If κ < ηα then
because 2κ ̸→(α)2
κ (by Lemma 9.3) and ηα →(α)2
κ, we have 2κ < ηα. We
shall show that ηα is regular.
Let us assume that ηα is singular and that κ = cf ηα; let ηα = limν→κ λν.
For each ν < κ, let f ν : [λν]<ω →{0, 1} be such that f ν has no homoge-
neous set of order-type α. For each n, let f ν
n = f ν↾[λν]n; let A be the model
(Vηα, ∈, λν, f ν
n)ν<κ,n=0,1,... Since ηα is a strong limit and κ < ηα, the model A
has a set of indiscernibles H of order-type α.
Let ν be such that λν is greater than the least element of H. Then by
indiscernibility, all elements of H are smaller than λν. Since the function f ν
takes only two values, it follows that for each n, it is the equality
f ν
n({α1, . . . , αn}) = f ν
n({β1, . . . , βn})
that holds for all increasing sequences α1 < . . . < αn < β1 < . . . < βn
in H, and not its negation. Hence H is homogeneous for f ν, contrary to the
assumption on f ν.
Finally, let α < β be limit ordinals, and let us assume that ηα = ηβ.
For each ξ < ηα, there exists a function fξ : [ξ]<ω →{0, 1} that has no
homogeneous subset of ξ of order-type α. Let us deﬁne g : [ηβ]<ω →{0, 1}
by
g({ξ1, . . . , ξn}) = fξn({ξ1, . . . , ξn−1}).
Now if H is homogeneous for g, then for each ξ ∈H, H ∩ξ is homogeneous
for fξ. Hence the order-type of each H ∩ξ is less than α, and therefore the
order-type of H is at most α, which is less than β. A contradiction.

We shall now show that the least Erd˝os cardinal ηω is greater than the
least weakly compact cardinal. We use the following lemma, of independent
interest:
Lemma 17.32. Let M and N be transitive models of ZFC and let j : M →
N be a nontrivial elementary embedding; let κ be the least ordinal moved. If
P M(κ) = P N(κ), then κ is a weakly compact cardinal in M.
Proof. We prove a somewhat stronger statement: κ is ineﬀable in M (see
Exercise 17.26).
Let ⟨Aα : α < κ⟩∈M be such that Aα ⊂α for all α. We have j(Aα) = Aα
for all α < κ, and hence j(⟨Aα : α < κ⟩) = (⟨Aα : α < j(κ)⟩(for some Aα,
κ ≤α < j(κ)). The set Aκ is in M and witnesses ineﬀability of κ in M.
⊓⊔
Theorem 17.33. If ηω exists then there exists a weakly compact cardinal
below ηω.
Proof. Let hϕ, ϕ ∈Form, be Skolem functions for the language {∈} of set
theory, and let us consider the model A = (Vηω, ∈, hA
ϕ)ϕ∈Form where for
each ϕ, hA
ϕ is a Skolem function for ϕ in (Vηω, ∈). The model A has a set of
indiscernibles I of order-type ω. Let B be the closure of I under the Skolem
functions hA
ϕ.
Let us consider some nontrivial order-preserving mapping of H into H.
Using the Skolem functions, we extend this mapping (in the unique way)
to a nontrivial elementary embedding of B into B. Let M be the transitive
set isomorphic to B and let j : M →M be the corresponding nontrivial
elementary embedding.
Since ηω is inaccessible, Vηω is a model of ZFC and thus M is a transitive
model of ZFC. By Lemma 17.32 there exists a weakly compact cardinal in M,
and therefore in Vηω.
⊓⊔
The next result shows that the Erd˝os cardinal ηω is consistent with V = L.
In Chapter 18 we show that the existence of ηω1 implies V ̸= L.
Theorem 17.34. If κ →(ω)<ω then L ⊨κ →(ω)<ω.
Proof. Let f be a constructible partition f : [κ]<ω →{0, 1}. We claim that
if there is an inﬁnite homogeneous set for f, then there is one in L. Let T
be the set of all ﬁnite increasing sequences t = ⟨α0, . . . , αn−1⟩in κ such that
for every k ≤n, f is constant on [{α0, . . . , αn−1}]k, and let us consider the
tree (T, ⊃); clearly, T is constructible. We note that an inﬁnite homogeneous
set for f exists if and only if (T, ⊃) is not well-founded. However, being well-
founded is an absolute property for models of ZFC; and so if the tree is not
well-founded, then it is not well-founded in L, and the claim follows.
⊓⊔
Let us consider models of a countable language L, with a distinguished
one-place predicate Q. A model A = (A, QA, . . .) of L has type (κ, λ) if |A| = κ
and |QA| = λ.

Deﬁnition 17.35. A cardinal κ > ℵ1 is a Rowbottom cardinal if for every
uncountable λ < κ, every model of type (κ, λ) has an elementary submodel
of type (κ, ℵ0).
An inﬁnite cardinal is a J´onsson cardinal if every model of size κ has
a proper elementary submodel of size κ.
Every Rowbottom cardinal is a J´onsson cardinal and the following lemma,
a variation on Rowbottom’s Theorem, shows that every Ramsey cardinal is
a Rowbottom cardinal.
Lemma 17.36. Let κ be a Ramsey cardinal, and let λ be an inﬁnite cardinal
less than κ. Let A = (A, . . .) be a model of a language L such that |L| ≤λ,
and let A ⊃κ. If P ⊂A is such that |P| < κ then A has an elementary
submodel B = (B, . . .) such that |B| = κ and |P ∩B| ≤λ.
Moreover, if X ⊂A is of size at most λ, then we can ﬁnd B such that
X ⊂B.
Moreover, if κ is a measurable and D is a normal measure on κ, then we
can ﬁnd B such that B ∩κ ∈D.
Proof. First we add to the language L one unary predicate whose interpre-
tation is the set P; we also add constant symbols for all x ∈X. Next we ﬁnd
some Skolem functions hϕ (in (A, . . . , P, x)x∈X) for every formula ϕ, and
extend the language further by adding function symbols for the functions hϕ.
Next we ﬁnd a set of indiscernibles I ⊂κ, of size κ, for the expanded
model A′; if κ is measurable and D is a normal measure, we ﬁnd I ∈D. We
let B be the elementary submodel of A′ generated by I. As in the proof of
Theorem 17.27, one proves that if |P ∩B| < κ then |P ∩B| ≤λ.
⊓⊔
In Chapter 18 we show that if there exists a J´onsson cardinal then V ̸= L.

17.24. If κ is weakly compact, then there is no countably generated complete
Boolean algebra B such that |B| = κ.
[Assume that B is such. Note that sat(B) = κ. We may assume that B =
(κ, +, ·, −); let A ⊂κ be a countable set of generators. Let U1 be the set of all
pairs (u, x) such that u ∈κ, x ⊂κ, |x| < κ, and u = P x, let U2 = {A}. Let
σ be the conjunction of these sentences: (a) B is a Boolean algebra and B ⊃A
(ﬁrst order), (b) ∀x ∃u (if x ⊂κ, then u = P x) (ﬁrst order), and (c) ∀X (if X ⊂κ
and X is a partition of B, then ∃x (x = X)) (here x is a ﬁrst order variable; the
sentence (c) is Π1
1). Since (Vκ, ∈, U1, U2) satisﬁes σ, there is some α < κ such
that (Vα, ∈, U1 ∩Vα, U2 ∩Vα) ⊨σ. Then (α, +, ·, −) is a complete subalgebra of B
containing A.]

17.25. Let κ be a measurable cardinal. If ⟨Aα : α < κ⟩is a sequence of sets such
that Aα ⊂α for all α < κ, then there exists an A ⊂κ such that {α ∈κ : A∩α = Aα}
is stationary.
A cardinal κ with the property from Exercise 17.25 is called ineﬀable.
17.26. Let κ be ineﬀable and let f : [κ]2 →{0, 1} be a partition. Then there exists
a stationary homogeneous set. (Hence κ is weakly compact.)
[For each α < κ let Aα = {ξ < α : f({ξ, α}) = 1}, and let A ⊂κ be such that
S = {α : A ∩α = Aα} is stationary. Either S ∩A or S −A is stationary, and is
homogeneous.]

[ηω is Π1

17.31. An inﬁnite cardinal κ is a J´onsson cardinal if and only if for every F :
[κ]<ω →κ there exists a set H ⊂κ of size κ such that the image of [H]<ω under F
is not the whole set κ.
[To show that the condition is necessary, consider the model (κ, <, F1, F2, . . .)
where Fn = F↾[κ]n. To show that the condition is suﬃcient, let A = (κ, . . .) be
a model. Let {hn : n < ω} be a set of Skolem functions for A, closed under
composition and arranged so that each hα is n-ary. For each x ∈[κ]n, let F(x) =
hn(x). If H ⊂κ, then the image of [H]<ω under F is an elementary submodel of A.]
17.32. ℵ0 is not a J´onsson cardinal.
[Let A = (ω, f) where f(n) = n −1 for all n > 0.]
17.33. If κ is a Rowbottom cardinal, then either κ is weakly inaccessible or
cf κ = ω.
[To show that κ = λ+ is not Rowbottom, let fα be a one-to-one mapping of α
onto λ, for each α, such that λ ≤α < κ. Let A = (κ, λ, <, R) where R(α, β, γ)
if and only if fα(β) = γ. If (B, B ∩λ, <, R ∩B3) ≺A and |B| = κ, let α be the
λth element of B; then fα(B ∩α) ⊂B ∩λ and hence |B ∩λ| = λ > ℵ0.
To show that κ is not Rowbottom if κ > cf κ = λ > ℵ0, let f be a nondecreasing
function of κ onto λ and use f to produce a counterexample.]
Historical Notes
In [1963/64] Keisler and Tarski introduced the method of ultraproducts in the
study of measurable cardinals, and it was established that the least measurable

17. Large Cardinals
309
cardinal is greater than the least inaccessible cardinal. Scott used the method of ul-
trapowers to prove that existence of measurable cardinals contradicts the Axiom of
Constructibility. Rowbottom and Silver initiated applications of inﬁnitary combina-
torics developed by Erd˝os and his collaborators. Scott’s Theorem appeared in [1961]
and Kunen’s Theorem in [1971a]. (Lemma 17.8 is due to Erd˝os and Hajnal [1966].)
In [1963/64a] Hanf studied compactness of inﬁnitary languages; his work let to
the systematic study of Keisler and Tarski. Hanf proved that the least inaccessible
cardinal is not measurable (in fact not weakly compact); Erd˝os and Hajnal then
pointed out (cf. [1962]) that the same result can be proved using inﬁnitary combi-
natorics. Keisler and Tarski introduced the Mahlo operation and showed that the
least measurable cardinal is much greater than, e.g., the least Mahlo cardinal, etc.
The equivalence of various formulations of weak compactness is a result of
several papers. In [1963/64a] Hanf initiated investigations of compactness of in-
ﬁnitary languages. Erd˝os and Tarski listed in [1961] several properties that were
subsequently shown mutually equivalent (for inaccessible cardinals) and proved
several implications. These properties included the partition property κ →(κ)2
2,
the tree property, and several other properties. Hanf and Scott [1961] introduced
Πn
m-indescribability and announced Theorem 17.18. Further contributions were
made in the papers Hanf [1963/64b], Hajnal [1964], Keisler [1962], Monk and
Scott [1963/64], Tarski [1962], and Keisler and Tarski [1963/64]. A complete list of
equivalent formulations with the proofs appeared in Silver [1971b]. Theorem 17.22
is due to Silver [1971b]. Rowbottom’s Theorem (as well as Lemma 17.36) are due
to Rowbottom [1971].
The main results on Erd˝os cardinals are due to Rowbottom, Reinhardt, and
Silver. Rowbottom proved that if ηω1 exists, then there are only countably many
constructible reals (see [1971]); Theorem 17.33 is due to Reinhardt and Silver [1965],
and Theorem 17.34 is due to Silver [1970a].
Exercise 17.10: Ketonen [1973].
Ineﬀable cardinals were introduced by Jensen; Exercises 17.26 and 17.27 are
due to Kunen and Jensen.
Exercise 17.29: Reinhardt and Silver [1965].

18. Large Cardinals and L
In Chapter 17 we proved that while “smaller” large cardinals (inaccessible,
Mahlo, weakly compact) can exist in L, the “bigger” large cardinals (measur-
able, Ramsey) cannot. In this chapter we isolate and investigate the concept
of 0♯(zero-sharp), a great divide in the landscape of large cardinals.
Silver Indiscernibles
Theorem 18.1 (Silver). If there exists a Ramsey cardinal, then:
(i) If κ and λ are uncountable cardinals and κ < λ, then (Lκ, ∈) is an
elementary submodel of (Lλ, ∈).
(ii) There is a unique closed unbounded class of ordinals I containing all
uncountable cardinals such that for every uncountable cardinal κ:
(a) |I ∩κ| = κ,
(b) I ∩κ is a set of indiscernibles for (Lκ, ∈), and
(c) every a ∈Lκ is deﬁnable in (Lκ, ∈) from I ∩κ.
The elements of the class I are called Silver indiscernibles. Before giving
the proof of Theorem 18.1 we state some consequences of the existence of
Silver indiscernibles.
By the Reﬂection Principle, if ϕ is a formula, then there exists an un-
countable cardinal κ such that
(18.1)
L ⊨ϕ(x1, . . . , xn)
if and only if
Lκ ⊨ϕ(x1, . . . , xn)
for all x1, . . . , xn ∈Lκ. By (i), the right hand side holds in and only if
Lλ ⊨ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) for all cardinals λ ≥κ. In view of this, we can deﬁne
satisfaction in L for all formulas ϕ ∈Form: If ϕ(v1, . . . , vn) is a formula of
the language L = {∈} and if ⟨a1, . . . , an⟩is an n-termed sequence in L, we
deﬁne
(18.2)
L ⊨ϕ[a1, . . . , an]
as follows: For every uncountable cardinal κ such that a1, . . . , an ∈Lκ, Lκ ⊨
ϕ[a1, . . . , an].

312
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Note that this gives us a truth deﬁnition for the constructible universe:
T = {#σ : Lℵ1 ⊨σ}. If σ is a sentence, then σL ↔#σ ∈T . (Note that the
set T is constructible but not deﬁnable in L: Otherwise, T would be a truth
deﬁnition in L. Hence the cardinal ℵ1 is not deﬁnable in L.)
Moreover, as a consequence of (i) we have (Lκ, ∈) ≺(L, ∈) for every
uncountable cardinal κ. As a consequence of (ii) Silver indiscernibles are
indiscernibles for L: If ϕ(v1, . . . , vn) is a formula, then
(18.3)
L ⊨ϕ[α1, . . . , αn]
if and only if
L ⊨ϕ[β1, . . . , βn]
whenever α1 < . . . < αn and β1 < . . . < βn are increasing sequences in I.
Every constructible set is deﬁnable from I. If a ∈L, there exists an increasing
sequence ⟨γ1, . . . , γn⟩of Silver indiscernibles and a formula ϕ such that
L ⊨a is the unique x such that ϕ(x, γ1, . . . , γn).
By (18.3), every formula ϕ(v1, . . . , vn) is either true or false in L for any
increasing sequence ⟨γ1, . . . , γn⟩of Silver indiscernibles; moreover, the truth
value coincides with the truth value of Lℵω ⊨ϕ[ℵ1, . . . , ℵn] since Lℵω ≺L
and ℵ1, . . . , ℵn are Silver indiscernibles. Thus let us deﬁne
(18.4)
0♯= {ϕ : Lℵω ⊨ϕ[ℵ1, . . . , ℵn]}
(zero-sharp). Later in this section we shall give another deﬁnition of the set 0♯.
We shall show that a set 0♯satisfying the deﬁnition exists if and only if (i)
and (ii) holds, and then 0♯is as in (18.4).
Thus the conclusion of Theorem 18.1 is abbreviated as
0♯exists.
In the following corollaries we assume that 0♯exists.
Corollary 18.2. Every constructible set deﬁnable in L is countable.
Proof. If x ∈L is deﬁnable in L by a formula ϕ, then the same formula
deﬁnes x in Lℵ1 and hence x ∈Lℵ1.
⊓⊔
In particular, every ordinal number deﬁnable in L is countable.
In the following corollary ℵα denotes the αth cardinal in V , not ℵL
α.
Corollary 18.3. Every uncountable cardinal is inaccessible in L.
Proof. Since L ⊨ℵ1 is regular, we have
L ⊨ℵα is regular
for every α ≥1. Similarly, L ⊨ℵω is a limit cardinal, and hence
L ⊨ℵα is a limit cardinal
for every α ≥1. Thus every uncountable cardinal (and in fact every γ ∈I)
is an inaccessible cardinal in L.
⊓⊔

18. Large Cardinals and L
313
Corollary 18.4. Every uncountable cardinal is a Mahlo cardinal in L.
Proof. By Corollary 18.3, every Silver indiscernible is an inaccessible cardinal
in L. Since I ∩ω1 is closed unbounded in ω1, ℵ1 is a Mahlo cardinal in L.
⊓⊔
Corollary 18.5. For every α ≥ω, |Vα ∩L| ≤|α|. In particular, the set of
all constructible reals is countable.
Proof. The set Vα ∩L is deﬁnable in L from α. Thus Vα ∩L is also deﬁnable
from α in Lκ where κ is the least cardinal > α. Hence Vα∩L ⊂Lβ for some β
such that |α| = |β|. However, |Lβ| = |β|.
⊓⊔
Models with Indiscernibles
The proof of Silver’s Theorem is based on a theorem of Ehrenfeucht and
Mostowski in model theory, stating that every inﬁnite model is elementarily
equivalent to a model that has a set of indiscernibles of prescribed order-type.
We shall deal only with models (Lλ, ∈) (and models elementarily equivalent
to these); we shall prove below a special case of the Ehrenfeucht-Mostowski
Theorem.
We shall use the canonical well-ordering of L to endow the models (Lλ, ∈)
with deﬁnable Skolem functions. For each formula ϕ(u, v1, . . . , vn), let hϕ be
the n-ary function deﬁned as follows:
(18.5)
hϕ(v1, . . . , vn) =
the <L-least u such that ϕ(u, v1, . . . , vn),
∅
otherwise.
We call hϕ, ϕ ∈Form, the canonical Skolem functions.
For each limit ordinal λ, hLλ
ϕ
is an n-ary function on Lλ, the Lλ-interpre-
tation of hϕ, and is deﬁnable in (Lλ, ∈).
When dealing with models (Lλ, ∈) we shall freely use terms and formulas
involving the hϕ since they as deﬁnable functions can be eliminated and
the formulas can be replaced by ∈-formulas. For each limit ordinal λ, the
functions hLλ
ϕ , ϕ ∈Form, are Skolem functions for (Lλ, ∈) and so a set
M ⊂Lλ is an elementary submodel of (Lλ, ∈) if and only if M is closed
under the hLλ
ϕ . If X ⊂Lλ, then the closure of X under the hLλ
ϕ is the smallest
elementary submodel M ≺Lλ such that X ⊂M, and is the collection of all
elements of Lλ deﬁnable in Lλ from X.
The fact that the well-ordering <λ of Lλ is deﬁnable in Lλ uniformly for
all limit ordinals λ (by the same formula) implies the following:
Lemma 18.6. If α and β are limit ordinals and if j : Lα →Lβ is an
elementary embedding of (Lα, ∈) in (Lβ, ∈), then for each formula ϕ and all
x1, . . . , xn ∈Lα,
(18.6)
hLβ
ϕ (j(x1), . . . , j(xn)) = j(hLα
ϕ (x1, . . . , xn)).

314
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Hence j remains elementary with respect to the augmented language L∗=
{∈} ∪{hϕ : ϕ ∈Form}.
⊓⊔
Let λ be a limit ordinal, and let A = (A, E) be a model elementarily
equivalent to (Lλ, ∈). The set OrdA of all ordinal numbers of the model A is
linearly ordered by E; let us use x < y rather than x E y for x, y ∈OrdA.
A set I ⊂OrdA is a set of indiscernibles for A if for every formula ϕ,
(18.7)
A ⊨ϕ[x1, . . . , xn]
if and only if
A ⊨ϕ[y1, . . . , yn]
whenever x1 < . . . < xn and y1 < . . . < yn are elements of I. Let hA
ϕ denote
the A-interpretation of the canonical Skolem functions (18.5). Given a set
X ⊂A, let us denote HA(X) the closure of X under all hA
ϕ, ϕ ∈Form. The
set HA(X) is the Skolem hull of X and is an elementary submodel of A.
If I is a set of indiscernibles for A, let Σ(A, I) be the set of all formulas
ϕ(v1, . . . , vn) true in A for increasing sequences of elements of I:
(18.8) ϕ(v1, . . . , vn) ∈Σ(A, I) ↔A ⊨ϕ[x1, . . . , xn] for some x1, . . . , xn ∈I
such that x1 < . . . < xn.
A set of formulas Σ is called an E.M. set (Ehrenfeucht-Mostowski) if there
exists a model A elementarily equivalent to some Lλ, λ a limit ordinal, and
an inﬁnite set I of indiscernibles for A such that Σ = Σ(A, I).
Lemma 18.7. If Σ is an E.M. set and α an inﬁnite ordinal number, then
there exists a model A and a set of indiscernibles I for A such that:
(i) Σ = Σ(A, I);
(ii) the order-type of I is α;
(iii) A = HA(I).
Moreover, the pair (A, I) is unique up to isomorphism.
Proof. We prove uniqueness ﬁrst. Let (A, I) and (B, J) be two pairs, each
satisfying (i), (ii), (iii). Since both I and J have order-type α, let π be the
isomorphism between I and J. We shall extend π to an isomorphism between
A and B.
Since A is the Skolem hull of I, there is for each a ∈A a Skolem
term t(v1, . . . , vn) (a combination of the Skolem functions hϕ) such that
a = tA[x1, . . . , xn] for some x1 < . . . < xn in I; similarly for B, J. Thus
we deﬁne
(18.9)
π(tA[x1, . . . , xn]) = tB[π(x1), . . . , π(xn)]
for each Skolem term t and all x1, . . . , xn ∈I such that x1 < . . . < xn. Since
Σ(A, I) = Σ(B, J), we have
(18.10)
tA
1 [x1, . . . , xn] = tA
2 [y1, . . . , yn] ↔tB
1 [πx1, . . . , πxn] = tB
2 [πy1, . . . , πyn],
tA
1 [x1, . . . , xn] EA tA
2 [y1, . . . , yn] ↔tB
1 [πx1, . . . , πxn] EB tB
2 [πy1, . . . , πyn]

18. Large Cardinals and L
315
for any terms t1, t2 and indiscernibles x, y: Let z1, . . . , zn+m be the enumera-
tion of the set {x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , ym} in increasing order. Then the equality
in (18.10) holds (simultaneously in A and B) just in case ϕ(v1, . . . , vn+m) ∈
Σ where ϕ(z1, . . . , zn+m) is the formula that says that t1[x1, . . . , xn] =
t2[y1, . . . , yn]. Hence π is well-deﬁned by (18.9) and is an isomorphism be-
tween A and B extending the order-isomorphism of I and J.
To prove the existence of a model with indiscernibles with properties (i),
(ii), and (iii), we use the Compactness Theorem. Since Σ is an E.M. set, there
exists (A0, I0) such that Σ = Σ(A0, I0). Let us extend the language {∈} by
adding α constant symbols cξ, ξ < α. Let ∆be the following set of sentences:
(18.11)
cξ is an ordinal
(all ξ < α),
cξ < cη
(all ξ, η such that ξ < η < α),
ϕ(cξ1, . . . , cξn)
(all ϕ ∈Σ and all ξ1 < . . . < ξn < α).
We shall show that every ﬁnite subset of ∆has a model. Let D ⊂∆be
ﬁnite. There exist ξ1 < . . . < ξk such that cξ1, . . . , cξk are the only constants
mentioned in D. Let σ(cξ1, . . . , cξk) be the sentence that is the conjunction
of all sentences in D.
Since I0 is inﬁnite, there are i1, . . . , ik ∈I0 such that i1 < . . . < ik. Let
us take the model A0 and expand it by interpreting the constant symbols
cξ1, . . . , cξk as i1, . . . , ik. Since Σ = Σ(A0, I0) and D ⊂∆, it is clear that
A0 ⊨σ[i1, . . . , ik] and hence the expansion (A0, i1, . . . , ik) is a model of σ,
hence of D.
By the Compactness Theorem, the set ∆has a model M = (M, E, cM
ξ )ξ<α.
Let I = {cM
ξ
: ξ < α}. I is a set of ordinals of M and has order-type α.
It is clear that if ϕ(v1, . . . , vn) is an ∈-formula and ξ1 < . . . < ξn, then
(M, E) ⊨ϕ[cM
ξ1 , . . . , cM
ξn] if and only if ϕ ∈Σ. Thus I is a set of indiscernibles
for (M, E). Now we let A be the Skolem hull of I in (M, E). Since A = (A, E)
is an elementary submodel of (M, E), it follows that I is a set of indiscernibles
for A, Σ(A, I) = Σ, and that HA(I) = H(M,E)(I) = A. Hence (A, I) satisﬁes
(i), (ii), and (iii).
⊓⊔
For each E.M. set Σ and each ordinal α, let us call the (Σ, α)-model the
unique pair (A, I) given by Lemma 18.7. The uniqueness proof of Lemma 18.7
easily extends to give the following:
Lemma 18.8. Let Σ be an E.M. set, let α ≤β, and let j : α →β be
order-preserving. Then j can be extended to an elementary embedding of the
(Σ, α)-model into the (Σ, β)-model.
Proof. Extend j as in (18.9).
⊓⊔
We shall eventually show that the existence of Ramsey cardinal implies
the existence of an E.M. set Σ having a certain syntactical property (remark-
ability) and such that every (Σ, α)-model is well-founded. Let us investigate
well-foundedness ﬁrst.

316
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Lemma 18.9. The following are equivalent, for an E.M. set Σ:
(i) For every ordinal α, the (Σ, α)-model is well-founded.
(ii) For some ordinal α ≥ω1, the (Σ, α)-model is well-founded.
(iii) For every ordinal α < ω1, the (Σ, α)-model is well-founded.
Proof. (i) →(ii) is trivial.
(ii) →(iii): If (A, I) is the (Σ, α)-model and if β ≤α, let J be the initial
segment of the ﬁrst β elements of I; let B = HA(J). Clearly, (B, J) is the
(Σ, β)-model. Since a submodel of a well-founded model is well-founded, it
follows that if β ≤α and the (Σ, α)-model is well-founded, then the (Σ, β)-
model is also well-founded, and thus (ii) implies (iii).
(iii) →(i): Let us assume that there is a limit ordinal α such that the
(Σ, α)-model is not well-founded; let (A, I) be the model. There is an inﬁnite
sequence a0, a1, a2, . . . in A such that a1 E a2, a2 E a1, etc. Each an is
deﬁnable from I; that is, for each n there is a Skolem term tn such that an =
tA
n[x1, . . . , xkn] for some x1, . . . , xkn ∈I. Therefore there is a countable subset
I0 of I such that an ∈HA(I0) for all n ∈ω. The order-type of I0 is a countable
ordinal β and (HA(I0), I0) is the (Σ, β)-model. This model is clearly non-
well-founded since it contains all the an. Hence for some countable β, the
(Σ, β)-model is not well-founded.
⊓⊔
We shall now deﬁne remarkability. We consider only (Σ, α)-models where
α is an inﬁnite limit ordinal.
Let us say that a (Σ, α)-model (A, I) is unbounded if the set I is un-
bounded in the ordinals of A, that is, if for every x ∈OrdA there is y ∈I
such that x < y.
Lemma 18.10. The following are equivalent, for any E.M. set Σ:
(i) For all α, (Σ, α) is unbounded.
(ii) For some α, (Σ, α) is unbounded.
(iii) For every Skolem term t(v1, . . . , vn) the set Σ contains the formula
(18.12)
if t(v1, . . . , vn) is an ordinal, then t(v1, . . . , vn) < vn+1.
Proof. (i) →(ii) is trivial.
(ii) →(iii): Let (A, I) be a (Σ, α)-model, where α is a limit ordinal,
and assume that I is unbounded in OrdA. To prove (iii), it suﬃces to show
that for any term t, (18.12) is true in A for some increasing sequence x1 <
. . . < xn+1 in I. Let t be a Skolem term. Let us choose x1 < . . . < xn ∈I
and let y = tA[x1, . . . , xn]. If y /∈OrdA, then (18.12) is vacuously true; if
y ∈OrdA, then there exists xn+1 ∈I such that y < xn+1, and we have
A ⊨t[x1, . . . , xn] < xn+1.
(iii) →(i): Let (A, I) be a (Σ, α)-model, where α is a limit ordinal, and
assume (iii). To prove that I is unbounded in OrdA, let y ∈OrdA. There exist
a Skolem term t and x1 < . . . < xn ∈I such that y = tA[x1, . . . , xn]. Now if
xn+1 is any element of I greater than xn, (iii) implies that y < xn+1.
⊓⊔

Thus we say that an E.M. set Σ is unbounded if it contains the formu-
las (18.12) for all Skolem terms t.
Let α be a limit ordinal, α > ω, and let (A, I) be the (Σ, α)-model.
For each ξ < α, let iξ denote the ξth element of I. We say that (A, I) is
remarkable if it is unbounded and if every ordinal x of A less than iω is in
HA({in : n ∈ω}).
Lemma 18.11. The following are equivalent for any unbounded E.M. set Σ:
(i) For all α > ω, the (Σ, α)-model is remarkable.
(ii) For some α > ω, the (Σ, α)-model is remarkable.
(iii) For every Skolem term t(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn), the set Σ contains the
formula
(18.13)
if t(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn) is an ordinal smaller than y1, then
t(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn) = t(x1, . . . , xm, z1, . . . , zn).
Moreover, if (A, I) is a remarkable (Σ, α)-model and γ < α is a limit ordinal,
then every ordinal x of A less than iγ is in HA({iξ : ξ < γ}).
Proof. (i) →(ii) is trivial.
(ii) →(iii): Let α > ω be a limit ordinal and let (A, I) be a remarkable
(Σ, α)-model. To prove (iii), it suﬃces to show that for any t, (18.13) is
true in A for some increasing sequence x1 < . . . < xm < y1 < . . . < yn <
z1 < . . . < zn in I. Let t be a Skolem term. We let x1 < . . . < xm <
y1 < . . . < yn < z1 < . . . < zn ∈I be such that x1, . . . , xm are the
ﬁrst m members of I and that y1 is the ωth member of I, y1 = iω. Now if
a = tA(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn) is an ordinal of A and less than y1, we have, by
remarkability of (A, I), a ∈HA({in : n < ω}). Hence there is k < ω, k ≥m,
and a term s such that
(18.14)
A ⊨t[x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn] = s[i0, . . . , ik].
In other words (18.14) says that A satisﬁes a certain formula ϕ[i0, . . . , ik,
y1, . . . , yn]. By indiscernibility, A also satisﬁes ϕ[i0, . . . , ik, z1, . . . , zn], i.e.,
A ⊨t[x1, . . . , xm, z1, . . . , zn] = s[i0, . . . , ik].
Therefore tA[x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn] = tA[x1, . . . , xm, z1, . . . , zn].
(iii) →(i) and “moreover:” Let (A, I) be a (Σ, α)-model, where α > ω is
a limit ordinal, and assume (iii). Let γ ≥ω be a limit ordinal and let x ∈OrdA
be less than iγ, the γth element of I. We shall show that x ∈HA({iξ : ξ < γ}).
Since A = HA(I), there is a Skolem term t and x1 < . . . < xm < y1 . . . <
yn ∈I such that y1 = iγ and x = tA[x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn]. Let us choose
w1, . . . , wn and z1, . . . , zn in I such that
x1 < . . . < xm < w1 < . . . < wn < y1 < . . . < yn < z1 . . . < zn.

Now since x < y1, it follows from (18.13) that
A ⊨t[x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn] = t[x1, . . . , xm, z1, . . . , zn].
However, by indiscernibility, this implies that
A ⊨t[x1, . . . , xm, w1, . . . , wn] = t[x1, . . . , xm, z1, . . . , zn],
and hence x = tA[x1, . . . , xm, w1, . . . , wn]. Therefore x ∈HA({iξ : ξ < γ}).
⊓⊔
Thus we say that an E.M. set Σ is remarkable if it is unbounded and
contains the formulas (18.13) for all Skolem terms t.
An important consequence of remarkability is the following: Let (A, I) be
a remarkable (Σ, α)-model and let γ < α be a limit ordinal. Let J = {iξ :
ξ < γ} and let B = HA(J). Then (B, J) is the (Σ, γ)-model, and the ordinals
of B form an initial segment of the ordinals of A.
Another consequence of remarkability is that the indiscernibles form
a closed unbounded subset of ordinals. Let (A, I) be the (Σ, α)-model. We
say that the set I is closed in OrdA if for every limit γ < α, iγ is the least
upper bound (in the linearly ordered set OrdA) of the set {iξ : ξ < γ}.
Lemma 18.12. If (A, I) is remarkable, then I is closed in OrdA.
Proof. Let γ < α be a limit ordinal. If x is an ordinal of A less than iγ, then
by remarkability, x is in the (Σ, γ)-model B = HA({iξ : ξ < γ}). However,
since Σ is unbounded, B is an unbounded (Σ, γ)-model and hence x < iξ for
some ξ < γ. Hence iγ is the least upper bound of {iξ : ξ < γ}.
⊓⊔
Proof of Silver’s Theorem and 0♯
Let us call an E.M. set Σ well-founded if every (Σ, α)-model is well-founded,
and let us consider the statement:
(18.15)
There exists a well-founded remarkable E.M. set.
We shall prove Theorem 18.1 in two steps: First we shall show that both (i)
and (ii) are consequences of the assumption that there exists a well-founded
remarkable E.M. set, and then we shall show that if there exists a Ramsey
cardinal, then (18.15) holds. (Note that by Lemma 18.9 it suﬃces to ﬁnd
a well-founded remarkable model with uncountably many indiscernibles.)
Thus let us assume that there exists a well-founded remarkable E.M. set
and let Σ be such a set.
For every limit ordinal α, the (Σ, α)-model is a well-founded model el-
ementarily equivalent to some Lγ, and so by (13.13) is (isomorphic to)
some Lβ.

18. Large Cardinals and L
319
Lemma 18.13. If κ is an uncountable cardinal, then the universe of the
(Σ, κ)-model is Lκ.
Proof. The (Σ, κ)-model is (Lβ, I) for some β; since |I| = κ, we clearly have
β ≥κ. To prove that β = κ, assume that β > κ. Since I is unbounded in β and
has order-type κ, there is a limit ordinal γ < κ such that κ < iγ. By remark-
ability, all ordinals less than iγ are in the (Σ, γ)-model A = H({iξ : ξ < γ}).
This is a contradiction since on the one hand we have κ ⊂A, and on the
other hand |A| = |γ| < κ.
⊓⊔
For each uncountable cardinal κ, let Iκ be the unique subset of κ such that
(Lκ, Iκ) is the (Σ, κ)-model. By Lemma 18.12, Iκ is closed and unbounded
in κ.
Lemma 18.14. If κ < λ are uncountable cardinals, then Iλ ∩κ = Iκ, and
HLλ(Iκ) = Lκ.
Proof. Let J be the set consisting of the ﬁrst κ members of Iλ and let A =
HLλ(J). Then (A, J) is a (Σ, κ)-model and the ordinals of A are an initial
segment of λ, say OrdA = β. Since (A, J) is isomorphic to (Lκ, Iκ), it is clear
that β = κ and J = Iκ. Hence Iλ ∩κ = Iκ.
Now since A ≺Lλ, A is closed under the deﬁnable function F(α) =
the αth set in the well-ordering <L, and since OrdA = κ, we have A =
{F(α) : α < κ} = Lκ.
⊓⊔
Using this lemma, we can now prove both (i) and (ii) of Theorem 18.1
except for the uniqueness of Silver indiscernibles. We let
(18.16)
I = {Iκ : κ is an uncountable cardinal}.
For each uncountable cardinal κ, I∩κ = Iκ is a closed unbounded set of order-
type κ, and is a set of indiscernibles for (Lκ, ∈); moreover, by Lemma 18.7(iii),
every a ∈Lκ is deﬁnable in Lκ from Iκ. Let κ < λ be uncountable cardinals.
Since Iλ is closed in Lλ and Iλ∩κ = Iκ, it follows that κ ∈Iλ; hence I contains
all uncountable cardinals. Also, since Lκ = HLλ(Iκ), we have Lκ ≺Lλ.
The next two lemmas prove the uniqueness of Silver indiscernibles and of
the corresponding E.M. set.
Lemma 18.15. There is at most one well-founded remarkable E.M. set.
Proof. Assuming that there is one such Σ, we deﬁne the class I in (18.16).
Now since Lℵω is the (Σ, ℵω)-model and ℵn ∈I for each n ≥1, we have
(18.17)
ϕ(v1, . . . , vn) ∈Σ
if and only if
Lℵω ⊨ϕ[ℵ1, . . . , ℵn]
which proves that Σ is unique.
⊓⊔

320
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
We therefore deﬁne 0♯(zero-sharp):
(18.18)
0♯is the unique well-founded remarkable E.M. set if it exists.
The uniqueness of Silver indiscernibles now follows from:
Lemma 18.16. For every regular uncountable cardinal κ there is at most one
closed unbounded set of indiscernibles X for Lκ such that Lκ = HLκ(X).
Proof. Let Σ = Σ(Lκ, X). Since X is closed unbounded, it follows that X ∩I
is inﬁnite, and Σ(Lκ, X) = Σ(Lκ, X ∩I) = Σ(Lκ, I ∩κ). Hence Σ = 0♯and
since (Lκ, X) is the (Σ, κ)-model, we have X = I ∩κ.
⊓⊔
Thus we have proved (i) and (ii) of Theorem 18.1 under the assump-
tion that 0♯exists. On the other hand, if (ii) holds, then 0♯exists because,
e.g., (Lω1, I ∩ω1) is a remarkable well-founded model with ℵ1 indiscernibles.
To complete the proof of Theorem 18.1, it remains to show that if there is
a Ramsey cardinal, then 0♯exists. That will follow from:
Lemma 18.17. Let κ be an uncountable cardinal. If there exists a limit ordi-
nal λ such that (Lλ, ∈) has a set of indiscernibles of order-type κ, then there
exist a limit ordinal γ and a set I ⊂γ of order-type κ such that (Lγ, I) is
remarkable.
It follows that if κ is Ramsey, then by Corollary 17.26 (Lκ, ∈) has a set
of indiscernibles of order-type κ. By Lemma 18.17, there exists a remarkable
model (Lγ, I) where I has order-type κ. By Lemma 18.9, Σ(Lγ, I) is well-
founded and remarkable and hence 0♯exists.
Proof. Let λ be the least limit ordinal such that (Lλ, ∈) has a set of indis-
cernibles I ⊂λ of order-type κ. We shall show ﬁrst that there is a set of
indiscernibles I ⊂λ for Lλ, of order-type κ, such that HLλ(I) = Lλ. Let
J be any set of indiscernibles for Lλ, of order-type κ, and let A = HLλ(J).
Then A ≺Lλ and hence A is isomorphic to some Lβ, β ≤λ, by the collapsing
map π. Now I = π(J) is a set of indiscernibles for Lβ, and HLβ(I) = Lβ. By
the minimality of λ, we have β = λ and hence I is as claimed.
Next we show that any such set I is unbounded in λ. If not, there is a limit
ordinal α < λ such that I ⊂α. There is a Skolem term t and γ1 < . . . < γn ∈I
such that α = tLλ[γ1, . . . , γn]. We claim that the set J = {i ∈I : i > γn}
is a set of indiscernibles for (Lα, ∈). If ϕ(v1, . . . , vn) is a formula, then for
any i1 < . . . < ik ∈J, Lα satisﬁes ϕ[i1, . . . , ik] if and only if Lλ satisﬁes the
formula
(18.19)
Lα ⊨ϕ[i1, . . . , ik].
The formula (18.19) is a formula about α, i1, . . . , ik, and since α =
tLλ[γ1, . . . , γn] there is a formula ψ(u1, . . . , un, v1, . . . , vk) such that Lλ sat-
isﬁes (18.19) if and only if
(18.20)
Lλ ⊨ψ[γ1, . . . , γn, i1, . . . , ik].

18. Large Cardinals and L
321
By the indiscernibility of I, the truth of (18.20) is independent of the
choice of i1 < . . . < ik in I provided γn < i1. Hence the truth of (18.19)
is independent of the choice of i1 < . . . < ik in J. Hence J is a set of
indiscernibles for Lα, and this contradicts the minimality of λ since α < λ
and the order-type of J is κ.
Finally, let I be a set of indiscernibles for Lλ of order-type κ such that
HLλ(I) = Lλ, and that iω, the ωth element of I, is least possible. We will
show that (Lλ, I) is remarkable.
Let us assume that (Lλ, I) is not remarkable. Then there is a Skolem
term t(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn) such that the following holds in Lλ for any
x1 < . . . < xm < y1 < . . . < yn < z1 < . . . < zn:
(18.21)
t(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn) < y1
and
(18.22)
t(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn) ̸= t(x1, . . . , xm, z1, . . . , zn).
Let x1, . . . , xm be the ﬁrst m elements of I. We now consider the following
increasing n-termed sequences in I: Let u0 be the sequence of ﬁrst n indis-
cernibles after xm, let u1 be the ﬁrst n indiscernibles after u0, etc.; for each
α < κ, let
γα = t(x1, . . . , xm, uα).
By indiscernibility, applied to the formula (18.22), we have γα ̸= γβ whenever
α ̸= β. In fact, in (18.22) we have either < or > (in place of ̸=); but > is
impossible since that would mean that γα > γβ whenever α < β. Thus
⟨γα : α < κ⟩is an increasing sequence of ordinals.
We claim that J = {γα : α < κ} is a set of indiscernibles for Lλ. This is
so because for any formula ϕ, the truth value of ϕ(γα1, . . . , γαk) in Lλ does
not depend on the choice of γα1 < . . . < γαk in J because by the deﬁnition
of the uα, the truth value of ϕ(t(x1 . . . , xm, uα1), . . . , t(x1 . . . , xm, uαk)) does
not depend on the choice of α1 < . . . < αk.
Hence {γα : α < κ} is a set of indiscernibles for Lλ. Since iω is the ﬁrst
member of uω, it follows by (18.21) that γω < iω. Now if A = H(J) and
π is the transitive collapse of A, then, as we proved in the ﬁrst paragraph,
π(A) = Lλ, and K = π(J) is a set of indiscernibles for Lλ of order-type κ such
that HLλ(K) = Lλ. However, π(γω) ≤γω < iω, and so the ωth member of K
is smaller than iω, contrary to our assumption. Hence (Lλ, I) is remarkable.
⊓⊔
This completes the proof of Theorem 18.1. Lemma 18.17 also gives the
following equivalence:
Corollary 18.18. 0♯exists if and only if for some limit ordinal λ, the model
(Lλ, ∈) has an uncountable set of indiscernibles.
⊓⊔

The set 0♯is, strictly speaking, a set of formulas. But as formulas can
be coded by natural numbers, we can regard 0♯as a subset of ω. This con-
vention has become standard. Moreover, in Chapter 25 we show that 0♯is
a Π1
2 singleton, and so {0♯} is a ∆1
3 set. At this point we outline the proof of
absoluteness of 0♯:
Lemma 18.19. The property “Σ is a well-founded remarkable E.M. set” is
absolute for every inner model of ZF. Hence M ⊨0♯exists if and only if
0♯∈M in which case (0♯)M = 0♯.
Proof. We ﬁrst replace the property “Σ is an E.M. set” by a syntactical
condition.
Let ˆL be the language {∈, c1, c2, . . . , cn, . . .} where cn, n < ω, are constant
symbols. For every ∈-formula ϕ(v1, . . . , vn) let ˆϕ be the sentence ϕ(c1, . . . , cn)
of ˆL. For each set of formulas Σ, let ˆΣ be the set containing (i) all ˆϕ for
ϕ ∈Σ, (ii) the sentence “c1 is an ordinal and c1 < c2,” and (iii) the sentence
“ϕ(ci1, . . . , cin) ↔ϕ(cj1, . . . , cjn)” for every ϕ ∈Σ and any i1 < . . . < in,
j1 < . . . < jn, (iv) all axioms of ZFC + V = L. Let us consider the condition
(18.23)
ˆΣ is consistent.
Clearly, if Σ is an E.M. set, then ˆΣ is consistent, for we simply interpret
the constants cn, n < ω, as some Silver indiscernibles. Conversely, if ˆΣ is
consistent, then ˆΣ has a model and that model provides us with a (Σ, ω)-
model (with indiscernibles cn, n < ω) and the proof of Lemma 18.7 goes
through. Therefore (18.23) holds if and only if Σ is an E.M. set.
As remarkability can also be expressed as a syntactical property, it follows
that “Σ is a remarkable E.M. set” can be written as a ∆0 property (with
parameters Vω and Form). As such it is absolute for transitive models.
If Σ is a remarkable E.M. set, then for every limit ordinal α there is
a unique (up to isomorphism) (Σ, α)-model and we can ﬁnd one ((A, E), I)
such that I = α and that <A (i.e., E) agrees with < on α. If ((A, E), α)
is such, we say that “((A, E), α) is a (Σ, α)-model.” This last property is
a ∆1 property of Σ, (A, E), α, Vω and Form. Then Σ = 0♯if and only if
(18.24)
∀α ∀(A, E) (if ((A, E), α) is a (Σ, α)-model, then (A, E) is well-
founded).
As well-foundedness is absolute for transitive models of ZF, it follows that
(18.24) is absolute for inner models of ZF (which contain all ordinals), and
therefore “Σ = 0♯” is absolute.
⊓⊔
Elementary Embeddings of L
In Chapter 17 we proved that a well-founded ultrapower of the universe
induces an elementary embedding jU : V →Ult, and conversely, if j : V →M

18. Large Cardinals and L
323
is a nontrivial elementary embedding, then (17.2) deﬁnes a normal measure
on the least ordinal moved by j.
Let j be a nontrivial elementary embedding of the universe, and let M
be a transitive model of ZFC, containing all ordinals. Let N = j(M) =

α∈Ord j(M ∩Vα). Then N is a transitive model of ZF and j : M →N is
elementary:
(18.25)
M ⊨ϕ(a1, . . . , an)
if and only if
N ⊨ϕ(j(a1), . . . , j(an)).
((18.25) is proved by induction on the complexity of ϕ). In particular, if
M = L, then j(V ) ⊨(N is the constructible universe), and so N = L, and
j↾L is an elementary embedding of L in L. Note that by Scott’s Theorem, the
function j↾L is not a class in L; thus if there exists an elementary embedding
of L (into L), then V ̸= L.
If 0♯exists, then there are nontrivial elementary embeddings of L. In
fact, let j be any order-preserving function from the class I of all Silver
indiscernibles into itself. Then j can be extended to an elementary embedding
of L; we simply let
(18.26)
j(tL[γ1, . . . , γn]) = tL[j(γ1), . . . , j(γn)]
for every Skolem term t and any Silver indiscernibles γ1 < . . . < γn. We
shall prove that the converse is true, that if there is a nontrivial elementary
embedding of L, then 0♯exists:
Theorem 18.20 (Kunen). The following are equivalent:
(i) 0♯exists.
(ii) There is a nontrivial elementary embedding j : L →L.
Toward the proof of Kunen’s Theorem, let us investigate elementary em-
beddings j : M →N where M is a transitive model of ZFC.
Deﬁnition 18.21. Let M be a transitive model of ZFC, and let κ be a car-
dinal in M. An M-ultraﬁlter on κ is a collection D ⊂P M(κ) that is an
ultraﬁlter on the algebra of sets P M(κ). Explicitly,
(i) κ ∈D and ∅/∈D;
(ii) if X ∈D and Y ∈D, then X ∩Y ∈D;
(iii) if X ∈D and Y ∈M is such that X ⊂Y , then Y ∈D;
(iv) for every X ⊂κ such that X ∈M, either X or κ −X is in D.
(18.27)
D is κ-complete if whenever α < κ and {Xξ : ξ < α} ∈M is such that
Xξ ∈D for all ξ < α, then 
ξ<α Xα ∈D; D is normal if whenever f ∈M is
a regressive function on X ∈D, then f is constant on some Y ∈D.
If j : M →N is an elementary embedding, then the least ordinal moved
by j is called the critical point of j.

324
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Lemma 18.22. If j : M →N is an elementary embedding and κ is the
critical point of j then κ is a regular uncountable cardinal in M, and D =
{X ∈P M(κ) : κ ∈j(X)} is a nonprincipal normal κ-complete M-ultraﬁlter
on κ.
Proof. Exactly as the proof of Lemma 17.2. Note that κ-completeness of D
implies that κ is regular in M.
⊓⊔
If D is an M-ultraﬁlter on κ, one can construct the ultrapower of M
by D as follows: Consider, in M, the class of all functions f with domain κ.
Using D, deﬁne an equivalence relation =∗and the relation ∈∗as usual;
f =∗g ↔{α < κ : f(α) = g(α)} ∈D,
f ∈∗g ↔{α < κ : f(α) ∈g(α)} ∈D.
Then deﬁne equivalence classes mod =∗, and the model Ult = UltD(M). An
analog of Theorem 12.3 is easily veriﬁed:
Ult ⊨ϕ([f1], . . . , [fn]) if and only if {α < γ : M ⊨ϕ(f1(α), . . . , fn(α))} ∈D.
If for each a ∈M, ca denotes the constant function with value a, then
jD(a) = [ca]
deﬁnes an elementary embedding of M in Ult.
The ultrapower of M by an M-ultraﬁlter D is not necessarily well-
founded, even if D is countably complete.
If j : M →N is an elementary embedding with M and N being transitive
models, and if D is the M-ultraﬁlter {X : κ ∈j(X)}, then, as in Lemma 17.4,
we have the commutative diagram
(18.28)
Ult

and it follows that UltD(M) is well-founded. (If [f0] ∋∗[f1] ∋∗. . . were a de-
scending sequence in Ult, then k([f0]) ∋k([f1]) ∋. . . would be a descending
sequence in N.)
We proceed with the proof of Kunen’s Theorem.
Let j : L →L be an elementary embedding. We shall ﬁrst replace j by
a more manageable embedding. We let D be the L-ultraﬁlter {X ∈P L(γ) :
γ ∈j(X)} where γ is the critical point of j. The ultrapower UltD(L) is well-
founded and so we identify Ult with its transitive collapse L; let jD be the
canonical embedding, jD : L →L. The critical point of jD is γ because D is
γ-complete.

18. Large Cardinals and L

Lemma 18.23. If κ is a limit cardinal such that cf κ > γ, then jD(κ) = κ.
Proof. Every constructible function f : γ →κ is bounded by some α <
κ and hence [f] < [cα] (where cα is the constant function with value α).
Thus jD(κ) = limα→κ jD(α). Now if α < κ, then |jD(α)| ≤|(αγ)L|, hence
jD(α) < κ. It follows that jD(κ) = κ.
⊓⊔
Let us drop the subscript D and simply assume that j : L →L is an
elementary embedding, that γ is its critical point and that j(κ) = κ for every
limit cardinal κ such that cf κ > γ.
Let U0 be the class of all limit cardinals κ with cf κ > γ; by transﬁnite
induction we deﬁne a sequence of classes U0 ⊃U1 ⊃. . . ⊃Uα ⊃. . . as
follows:
(18.29)
Uα+1 = {κ ∈Uα : |Uα ∩κ| = κ},
Uλ = 
α<λ
Uα
(λ limit).
(That is, Uα+1 consists of ﬁxed points of the increasing enumeration of Uα.)
Each Uα is nonempty, and in fact a proper class. To see this, verify, by
induction on α, that each Uα is a proper class and is δ-closed, for each δ
with cf δ > γ; that is, whenever ⟨κξ : ξ < δ⟩is an increasing sequence in Uα,
then limξ→δ κξ ∈Uα. Hence each Uα is nonempty, and we choose a cardinal
κ ∈Uω1.
Thus κ is such that cf κ > γ and κ is the κth element of each Uα, α < ω1.
We shall ﬁnd a set of ℵ1 indiscernibles for (Lκ, ∈).
Since j : L →L is an elementary and j(κ) = κ, it is clear that the
mapping i = j↾Lκ is an elementary embedding of (Lκ, ∈) into (Lκ, ∈). We
shall use i and the sets Uα ∩κ, α < ω1, to produce indiscernibles γα, α < ω1,
for Lκ. Let Xα = Uα ∩κ for each α < ω1, and recall that γ is the critical
point of i.
For each α < ω1, we let
(18.30)
Mα = HLα(γ ∪Xα).
Mα is an elementary submodel of Lκ.
If πα is the transitive collapse of Mα, then because |Xα| = κ, we have
πα(Mα) = Lκ. Thus if we denote iα = π−1
α , then iα is an elementary embed-
ding of Lκ in Lκ. Let γα = iα(γ).
Lemma 18.24.
(i) The ordinal γα is the least ordinal greater than γ in Mα.
(ii) If α < β and x ∈Mβ, then iα(x) = x. In particular, iα(γβ) = γβ.
(iii) If α < β, then γα < γβ.

326
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Proof. (i) Since γ ⊂Mα, iα(γ) is the least ordinal in Mα greater than or
equal to γ; thus it suﬃces to show that γ /∈Mα. If x ∈Mα, then x =
t[η1, . . . , ηn] where t is a Skolem term and the η’s are either smaller than γ or
elements of Xα. For all such η, i(η) = η and hence i(x) = i(t(η1, . . . , ηn)) =
t(i(η1), . . . , i(ηn)) = x. However, i(γ) ̸= γ and so γ /∈Mα.
(ii) Each x ∈Mβ is of the form t[η1, . . . , ηn] where the η’s are either < γ
or in Xβ. If η < γ, then clearly iα(η) = η. If η ∈Xβ, then because α < β, we
have |Xα ∩η| = η and hence πα(η) = η; in other words, iα(η) = η. Therefore
iα(x) = x.
(iii) If α < β, then Mα ⊃Mβ and hence γα ≤γβ. To see that γα ̸= γβ,
note that because γα > γ, we have iα(γα) > iα(γ) = γα, while iα(γβ) = γβ.
⊓⊔
Lemma 18.25. If α < β, then there is an elementary embedding iα,β : Lκ →
Lκ such that for every ξ that is either smaller than α or greater than β we
have iα,β(γξ) = γξ, and iα,β(γα) = γβ.
Proof. Let Mα,β = HLκ(γα ∪Xβ), and let iα,β = π−1
α,β where πα,β is the
transitive collapse of Mα,β. The mapping iα,β is an elementary embedding
of Lκ in Lκ.
If η < γα, then clearly iα,β(η) = η; in particular iα,β(γξ) = γξ if ξ < α. If
x ∈Mβ+1, then x = t(η1, . . . , ηn) where the η’s are either smaller than γ or
elements of Xβ+1. If η ∈Xβ+1, then |Xβ ∩η| = η and therefore iα,β(η) = η.
Hence iα,β(x) = x for every x ∈Mβ+1, and in particular iα,β(γξ) = γξ if
ξ > β.
Now we shall show that iα,β(γα) = γβ. Since Mα,β ⊃Mβ, we have γβ ∈
Mα,β; and since γα ⊂Mα,β, iα,β(γα) is the least ordinal in Mα,β greater than
or equal to γα; hence we have γα ≤iα,β(γα) ≤γβ.
Thus it suﬃces to show that there is no ordinal δ ∈Mα,β such that
γα ≤δ < γβ. Otherwise there is some δ = t(ξ1, . . . , ξn, η1, . . . , ηk) such that
the ξ’s are < γα and the η’s are in Xβ (and t is a Skolem term) and that
γα ≤δ < γβ. Thus we have:
(18.31)
(Lκ, ∈) ⊨∃ξ < γα such that γα ≤t(ξ, η) < γβ.
The formula in (18.31) is a formula ϕ about γα, η, and γβ. At this point, we
apply the elementary embedding iα : Lκ →Lκ backward. That is, γα, the η’s
and γβ are all in the range of iα: γα = iα(γ), η = iα(η), and γβ = iα(γβ); and
since Lκ ⊨ϕ[iα(γ), iα(η), iα(γβ)], we conclude that Lκ ⊨ϕ[γ, η, γβ], namely
(Lκ, ∈) ⊨∃ξ < γ such that γ ≤t(ξ, η) < γβ.
Thus pick some ξ’s less than γ such that γ ≤t(ξ, η) < γβ. Since ξ ∈γ and
η ∈Xβ, we have t(ξ, η) ∈Mβ, which means that t(ξ, η) is an ordinal in Mβ
between γ and γβ, and that contradicts Lemma 18.24(i).
⊓⊔
The proof of Kunen’s Theorem will be complete when we show:

Lemma 18.26. The set {γα : α < ω1} is a set of indiscernibles for (Lκ, ∈).
Proof. Let ϕ be a formula and let α1 < . . . < αn and β1 < . . . < βn be two
sequences of countable ordinals. We wish to show that
(18.32)
Lκ ⊨ϕ[γα1, . . . , γαn]
if and only if
Lκ ⊨ϕ[γβ1, . . . , γβn].
Let us pick δ1 < . . . < δn such that αn < δ1 and βn < δ1. First we apply the
elementary embedding iαn,δn and get
Lκ ⊨ϕ[γα1, . . . , γαn−1, γαn]
if and only if
Lκ ⊨ϕ[γα1, . . . , γαn−1, γδn]
because iαn,δn(γαn) = γδn, and preserves the other γ’s. The we apply
iαn−1,δn−1 with a similar eﬀect, and by a successive application of iαn−2,δn−2,
. . . , iα1,δ1 we get
Lκ ⊨ϕ[γα1, . . . , γαn]
if and only if
Lκ ⊨ϕ[γδ1, . . . , γδn].
Then we do the same for the β’s and δ’s as we did for the α’s and δ’s, and
(18.32) follows.
⊓⊔
This completes the proof of Theorem 18.20.
The following result is related to Kunen’s Theorem:
Theorem 18.27. Let j : Lα →Lβ be an elementary embedding and let γ be
the critical point of j. If γ < |α|, then 0♯exists.
Proof. Let γ be the critical point of j. Since γ < |α|, every X ⊂γ is in Lα,
and so D = {X ⊂γ : γ ∈j(X)} is an L-ultraﬁlter.
Let us consider the ultrapower UltD(L). If the ultrapower is well-founded,
then we are done because then the canonical embedding jD : L →UltD(L)
is a nontrivial elementary embedding of L in L. Thus we shall prove that
UltD(L) is well-founded.
Let us assume that f0, f1, . . . , fn, . . . is a counterexample to well-
foundedness of the ultrapower. Each fn is a constructible function on γ and
{ξ < γ : fn+1(ξ) ∈fn(ξ)} ∈D for all n < ω. Let θ be a limit ordinal such
that fn ∈Lθ for all n and let M be an elementary submodel of (Lθ, ∈) such
that |M| = |γ|, γ ⊂M, and fn ∈M for all n. Let π be the transitive collapse
of M, π(M) = Lη, and let gn = π(fn), for all n.
Since π(ξ) = ξ for all ξ < γ, we see that for each ξ < γ and all n,
gn+1(ξ) ∈gn(ξ) if and only if fn+1(ξ) ∈fn(ξ), and hence g0, g1, . . . , gn, . . .
is also a counterexample to well-foundedness of the ultrapower. However,
since each gn is in L and |η| = |γ| < |α|, we have gn ∈Lα for all n. Thus
j(gn) is deﬁned for all n, and we have,
{ξ < γ : gn+1(ξ) ∈gn(ξ)} ∈D
if and only if
(j(gn+1))(γ) ∈(j(gn))(γ).
Now we reached a contradiction because (j(g0))(γ) ∋(j(g1))(γ) ∋. . . would
be a descending sequence.

Corollary 18.28. If there is a J´onsson cardinal, then 0♯exists.
Proof. Let κ be a J´onsson cardinal and let us consider the model (Lκ, ∈).
Let A be an elementary submodel, of size κ, such that A ̸= Lκ. Let π be
the transitive collapse of A; clearly, π(A) = Lκ. Thus j = π−1 is a nontrivial
elementary embedding of Lκ in Lκ. Since κ is a cardinal, 0♯exists by Theo-
rem 18.27.
⊓⊔
Chang’s Conjecture is the statement that every model of type (ℵ2, ℵ1)
has an elementary submodel of type (ℵ1, ℵ0).
Corollary 18.29. Chang’s Conjecture implies that 0♯exists.
Proof. Consider the model (Lω2, ω1, ∈), and let A = (A, ω1 ∩A, ∈) be its
elementary submodel such that |A| = ℵ1 and |ω1 ∩A| = ℵ0. Let π be the
transitive collapse of A; we have π(A) = Lα for some α such that ω1 ≤
α < ω2. Also, π(ω1 ∩A) is a countable ordinal, and hence π(ω1) < ω1. Then
j = π−1 is an elementary embedding of Lα in Lω2, and its critical point is
a countable ordinal. Hence 0♯exists.
⊓⊔
All results about 0♯and Silver indiscernibles for L proved in the present
section can be relativized to obtain similar results for the models L[x], where
x ⊂ω.
In particular, if there exists a Ramsey cardinal there is for every x ⊂ω
a unique class Ix containing all uncountable cardinals such that for each un-
countable cardinal κ, Ix∩κ is a set of indiscernibles for the model (Lκ[x], ∈, x)
and all elements of Lκ[x] are deﬁnable in the model from Ix ∩κ. Here x is con-
sidered a one-place predicate. Also, for every regular uncountable cardinal κ,
Ix ∩κ is closed unbounded in κ.
The proof of the relativization of Silver’s Theorem uses models with in-
discernibles (A, I) where A is elementarily equivalent to some (Lλ[x], ∈, x)
where λ > ω is a limit ordinal. If κ is a Ramsey cardinal, then (Lκ[x], ∈, x)
has a set of indiscernibles of size κ, and the theorem follows.
We deﬁne x♯as the unique set Σ = Σ((Lλ[x], ∈, x), I) that is well-founded
and remarkable. If x♯exists, then we have
x♯= {ϕ : (Lℵω[x], ∈, x) ⊨ϕ[ℵ1, . . . , ℵn]}.
Here ϕ is a formula of the language {∈, P} where P is a one-place predicate
(interpreted as x). Note that x is deﬁnable in the model (Lλ[x], ∈, x) (by the
formula P(v)).
The real x♯is absolute for all transitive models M of ZF containing all
ordinals such that x♯∈M.
Also, “x♯exists” is equivalent to the existence of a nontrivial elementary
embedding j : L[x] →L[x].

Jensen’s Covering Theorem
The theorem presented in this section shows that in the absence of 0♯the
universe does not diﬀer drastically from the constructible model. In partic-
ular, the coﬁnality function is closely related to the coﬁnality function in L,
and every singular cardinal is a singular cardinal in L. Moreover, the Singular
Cardinal Hypothesis holds and cardinal exponentiation is determined by the
continuum function on regular cardinals.
Theorem 18.30 (Jensen’s Covering Theorem). If 0♯does not exist,
then for every uncountable set X of ordinals there exists a constructible set
Y ⊃X such that |Y | = |X|.
The Covering Theorem expresses the closeness between V and L: Every
uncountable set of ordinals can be covered by a constructible set of the same
cardinality. In other words, every set X of ordinals can be covered by some
Y ∈L such that |Y | ≤|X| · ℵ1. (This is best possible: In Chapter 28 we give
an example of a forcing extension of L in which there is a countable set of
ordinals that cannot be covered by a countable (in V ) constructible set.)
The converse of the Covering Theorem is also true: If 0♯exists then every
uncountable cardinal is regular in L, and in particular, since ℵω is regular
in L, the countable set {ℵn : n < ω} cannot be covered by a constructible
set of cardinality less than ℵω. This shows:
0♯exists if and only if ℵω is regular in L.
Corollary 18.31. If 0♯does not exist then for every λ ≥ℵ2, if λ is a reg-
ular cardinal in L then cf λ = |λ|. Consequently, every singular cardinal is
a singular cardinal in L.
The assumption λ ≥ℵ2 is necessary: The forcing mentioned above yields
a model where λ = ℵL
2 is such that |λ| = ℵ1 and cf λ = ω.
Proof. Let λ be a limit ordinal such that λ ≥ω2 and that λ is a regular
cardinal in L. Let X be an unbounded subset of λ such that |X| = cf λ. By the
Covering Theorem, there exists a constructible set Y such that X ⊂Y ⊂λ
and that |Y | = |X|·ℵ1. Since Y is unbounded in λ and λ is a regular cardinal
in L, we have |Y | = |λ|. This gives |λ| = ℵ1 · cf λ and since λ ≥ℵ2, we have
|λ| = cf λ.
⊓⊔
Corollary 18.32. If 0♯does not exist then for every singular cardinal κ,
(κ+)L = κ+.
Proof. Let κ be a singular cardinal and let λ be the successor cardinal of κ
in L; we want to show that λ = κ+. If not, then |λ| = κ, and since κ is singular,
we have cf λ < κ. However, this means that cf λ < |λ| which contradicts
Corollary 18.31.
⊓⊔

Corollary 18.33. If 0♯does not exist then the Singular Cardinal Hypothesis
holds.
Proof. Let κ be such that 2cf κ < κ, and let A = [κ]cf κ be the set of all subsets
of κ of size cf κ. We shall show that |A| ≤κ+. By the Covering Theorem,
for every X ∈A there exists a constructible Y ⊂κ such that X ⊂Y and
|Y | = λ where λ = ℵ1 · cf κ. Thus
(18.33)
A ⊂{[Y ]cf κ : Y ∈C}
where C = {Y ⊂κ : |Y | = λ and Y ∈L}. If Y ∈C, then |[Y ]cf κ| = λcf κ =
(ℵ1 · cf κ)cf κ = 2cf κ < κ. Since |C| ≤|P L(κ)| = |(κ+)L| ≤κ+ it follows
from (18.33) that |A| ≤κ+.
⊓⊔
Corollary 18.34. If 0♯does not exist then if κ is a singular cardinal and if
there exists a nonconstructible subset of κ, then some α < κ has a noncon-
structible subset.
Proof. Let κ be a singular cardinal and assume that each α < κ has only
constructible subsets; we shall show that every subset of κ is constructible.
It suﬃces to show that each subset of κ of size cf κ is constructible: If A ⊂κ,
let {αν : ν < cf κ} be such that limν αν = κ; then A = {A ∩αν : ν < cf κ}
is a subset of Lκ of size ≤cf κ and hence constructible. It follows that A is
constructible.
Let X ⊂κ be such that |X| ≤cf(κ). By the Covering Theorem, there
exists a constructible set of ordinals Y ⊃X such that |Y | < κ. Let π be the
isomorphism between Y and its order-type α; the function π is constructible
and one-to-one. Since |α| = |Y | < κ, we have α < κ.
Let Z = π(X). Then Z ⊂α is constructible by the assumption, and hence
X = π−1(Z) is also constructible.
⊓⊔
The rest of this chapter is devoted to the proof of the Covering Theorem.
Jensen’s proof of the Covering Theorem used a detailed analysis of construc-
tion of sets in L, the ﬁne structure theory, see [1972]. The proof appeared in
Devlin and Jensen [1975]. Subsequently, Silver and Magidor gave proofs that
did not use the ﬁne structure. The outline below is based on Magidor [1990]
(and on Kanamori’s presentation in [∞]).
Let us assume that there exists an uncountable set X of ordinals that can-
not be covered by a constructible set of the same size. The goal is to produce
a nontrivial elementary embedding from L into L. In fact, by Theorem 18.27
it suﬃces to ﬁnd some j : Lα →Lβ with critical point below |α|.
Let τ be the least ordinal such that there exists a set X ⊂τ that cannot
be covered, and let X ⊂τ be such a set with |X| least possible. Let ν = |X|.

Lemma 18.35.
(i) τ is a cardinal in L.
(ii) If Y ∈L covers X then |Y |L ≥τ.
(iii) ν is a regular cardinal, ν < τ, and ν = ℵ1 · cf τ.
Proof. (i) and (ii) follow from the minimality of τ.
(iii) |X| < τ, because otherwise, Y = τ would cover X. Clearly, |X| ≥
ℵ1 · cf τ; thus assume that ν > ℵ1 · cf τ. Let τ = limξ→cf τ τξ. For each ξ, let
Yξ ∈L cover X ∩τξ. Let {Eα : α < τ} be a constructible enumeration of
all bounded constructible subsets of τ, and let Z = {α < τ : Eα = Yξ for
some ξ}. By the minimality of ν, Z can be covered by some W ∈L of size
ℵ1 · cf τ. Then the set Y = 
α∈Z Eα covers X, a contradiction.
⊓⊔
Now let M be an elementary submodel of (Lτ, ∈) such that X ⊂M and
|M| = ν. Let Lη be the transitive collapse of M, and let j = π−1 where π is
the collapsing isomorphism. Hence j : Lη →Lτ is an elementary embedding.
As X is coﬁnal in τ, and |η| = ν < τ, j is nontrivial.
The goal is to extend j : Lη →Lτ to an elementary embedding
J : Lδ →Lε where |δ| is greater than the critical point of j. This can be
achieved by ﬁnding M ≺Lτ that satisﬁes certain closure conditions. These
closure conditions guarantee that if Lη is the transitive collapse of M then
η is a cardinal in L, and furthermore, that for any δ > τ, j extends to an
elementary embedding J with domain Lδ.
The precise nature of the closure conditions will be spelled out in (18.41).
For the remainder of this chapter, we use the phrase “M is suﬃciently closed”
to indicate that M satisﬁes (18.41).
We defer the issue of η being a cardinal in L, as its proof requires a ﬁner
analysis of the constructible hierarchy. We start with the proof of extendibility
of j.
Lemma 18.36. Let M be suﬃciently closed, X ⊂M ≺Lτ such that |X| =
ν = |M|, let π : M ≃Lη be the transitive collapse, let j = π−1, and assume
that η is a cardinal in L. Then for every limit ordinal δ ≥η there exists an
elementary embedding J : Lδ →Lε such that J↾Lη = j.
Proof. Let δ ≥η be a limit ordinal. We consider the following directed system
of models: Let D be the set of all pairs i = (α, p) where α < η and p is
a ﬁnite subset of Lδ, ordered by (α, p) ≤(β, q) if and only if α ≤β and
p ⊂q. (D, <) is a directed set. Let i = (α, p), and let Mi = Hδ(α ∪p) be
the Skolem hull of α ∪p in (Lδ, ∈). Let Lηi be the transitive collapse of Mi
and let ei : Lηi →Lδ be the inverse of the collapsing map πi : M ≃Lηi. For
i ≤k, let ei,k = πk ◦ei.
Let us consider the directed system of models
(18.34)
{Lηi, ei,k : i, k ∈D}.

332
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Clearly, every x ∈Lδ is in some Mi, and so Lδ is the direct limit of
{Lηi, ei,k}i,k∈D. For every i ∈D, |Mi|L < η, and since η is a cardinal in L,
we have ηi < η. We claim that for all i, k ∈D, ei,k ∈Lη. This is because
Lηi = Hηi(α ∪πi(p)), Lηk = Hηk(β ∪πk(q)), and for every Skolem term t,
ei,k(tLηi(ξ, x)) = tLηk (ξ, ei,k(x)), so ei,k is deﬁnable in Lη from ηi, ηk, πi(p),
and πk(q).
Now we consider the directed system
(18.35)
{j(Lηi), j(ei,k) : i, k ∈D}.
The closure properties (18.41) of M guarantee that the direct limit of the
system (18.35) is well-founded. Let N be the direct limit, and for each i ∈D,
˜ei : Lj(ηi) →N be an elementary embedding such that ˜ei = ˜ek ◦j(˜ei,k)
whenever i < k. As N is well-founded, we may assume that N is transitive,
and then (by (13.13)), N = Lε for some limit ordinal ε.
We can extend j : Lη →Lτ to J : Lδ →Lε as follows:
(18.36)
J(x) = ˜ei(j(e−1
i (x)))
where i is some (any) i ∈D such that x ∈Mi.
It remains to show that J(x) = j(x) for all x ∈Lη. So let x ∈Lη, and let
α < η be such that x ∈Lα. Let i = (α, {x}). Since Lα ⊂Mi = Hδ(α ∪{x}),
it follows that ei↾Lα is the identity, as is ek,l↾Lα whenever i ≤k ≤l. Thus
j(ek,l)↾j(Lα) is the identity, for all l ≥k ≥i, and therefore ˜ei↾j(Lα) is the
identity. Hence ei(x) = x and ˜ei(jx) = jx, and therefore J(x) = j(x).
⊓⊔
The crucial step in the proof of the Covering Theorem is the following.
Lemma 18.37. Let M be suﬃciently closed, X ⊂M ≺Lτ, such that |X| =
ν = |M|, and let Lη be the transitive collapse of M. Then η is a cardinal
in L.
The proof is by contradiction. Assuming that η is not a cardinal in L, we
shall produce a constructible set of size ν that covers X. It is in this proof
that we need a ﬁner analysis of constructibility. We start by reﬁning G¨odel’s
Condensation Lemma:
Lemma 18.38. For every inﬁnite ordinal ρ, if M ≺Σ1 (Lρ, ∈) then the tran-
sitive collapse of M is Lγ for some γ. Moreover, there is a Π2 sentence σ
such that for every transitive set M, (M, ∈) ⊨σ if and only if M = Lρ for
some inﬁnite ordinal ρ.
⊓⊔
We omit the proof of Lemma 18.38. It can be found in Magidor [1990] or
in Kanamori [∞]. A related fact is the following lemma that is not diﬃcult
to deduce from Lemma 18.38:
Lemma 18.39. Let {(Lηi, ∈), ei,k : i, k ∈D} be a directed system of models,
ei,k being Σ0-elementary embeddings. If the direct limit of this system is well-
founded, then it is isomorphic to some Lγ.
⊓⊔

We also need the concept of Σn Skolem terms and Σn Skolem hull:
Deﬁnition 18.40. Let n ≥1.
(i) A Σn Skolem term is a composition of canonical Skolem functions
(18.5) for Σn formulas.
(ii) If Z ⊂Lρ, the Σn Skolem hull of Z is the set Hρ
n(Z) = {tLρ[z1, . . . , zk] :
t is a Σn Skolem term and z1, . . . , zn ∈Z}.
While a Σn Skolem function is not necessarily a Σn function, we have the
following:
Lemma 18.41.
(i) Hρ
n(Z) is a Σn-elementary submodel of Lρ.
(ii) If j : Lα →Lβ is Σn-elementary, then for every Σn Skolem term t
and all x1, . . . , xk ∈Lα, j(tLα[x1, . . . , xk]) = tLβ[j(x1), . . . , j(xk)].
⊓⊔
Proof of Lemma 18.37. Let us assume that η is not a cardinal in L. Then
there exists a constructible function that maps some α < η onto η. Conse-
quently, there exists an ordinal ρ ≥η, such that for some α < η and some
ﬁnite set p ⊂Lρ,
(18.37)
Hρ(α ∪p) ⊃η.
We say that η is not a cardinal at ρ. Let ρ be the least ordinal such that η is
not a cardinal at ρ.
There are three possible cases.
Case I. There exists some n > 1 such that Hρ
n(α ∪p) ⊃η for some α < η
and some ﬁnite p ⊂Lρ, but Hρ
n−1(β ∪q) ̸⊃η, for all β < η and all ﬁnite
q ⊂Lρ.
Case II. Hρ
1(α ∪p) ⊃η for some α < η and some ﬁnite p ⊂Lρ.
Case III. Hρ
n(α ∪p) ̸⊃η, for all α < η and all ﬁnite p ⊂Lρ.
We start with Case I.
Case I. We consider the following directed system of models. Let D be the
set of all pairs i = (α, p) where i < η and p ⊂Lρ is ﬁnite, ordered by (α, p) ≤
(β, q) if and only if α ≤β and p ⊂q. For each i ∈D, let Mi = Hρ
n−1(α ∪p).
Let Lηi be the transitive collapse of Mi and let ei : Lηi →Lρ be the inverse
of the collapsing map. For i ≤k, let ei,k = e−1
k
◦ei. Clearly, Lρ is the direct
limit of the directed system
(18.38)
{Lηi, ei,k : i, k ∈D},
with ei,k being Σn−1-elementary embeddings.
For each i ∈D, ηi < η because otherwise η ⊂Hρ
n−1(α ∪e−1(p)), con-
tradicting the assumption about n. Also, ei,k ∈Lη for all i, k ∈D, because

334
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
ei,k is deﬁned in Lη by its action on Σn−1 Skolem terms: ei,k(tLηi(ξ, x)) =
tLηk (ξ, ei,k(x)).
Now we consider the directed system
(18.39)
{j(Lηi), j(ei,k) : i, k ∈D}.
The closure properties (18.41) of M guarantee that the direct limit of (18.39)
is well-founded, and by Lemma 18.39, it is equal to Lγ for some γ. Let
˜ei be the embedding of j(Lηi) into Lγ; ˜ei is Σn−1-elementary. We extend
j : Lη →Lτ to J : Lρ →Lγ as follows:
(18.40)
J(x) = ˜ei(j(e−1
i (x)))
where i ∈D is such that x ∈Mi. As in the proof of Lemma 18.36, J extends j,
and it is easily veriﬁed that J is Σn−1-elementary.
The key observation is that J is even Σn-elementary. To prove that, it is
enough to show that for every Σn−1 formula ϕ, if Lγ ⊨∃x ϕ(x, J(y)) then
Lρ ⊨∃x ϕ(x, y). Thus let y ∈Lρ and x ∈Lγ be such that Lγ ⊨ϕ(x, J(y)).
Let i ∈D be such that x ∈ran(˜ei) and y ∈ran(ei). If u ∈Lj(ηi) and
v ∈Lηi are such that x = ˜ei(u) y = ei(v) then J(y) = ˜ei(j(v)), and Lγ ⊨
ϕ(˜ei(u), ˜ei(j(v))). Since ˜ei is Σn−1-elementary, we have Lj(ηi) ⊨ϕ(u, j(v)).
The statement Lj(ηi) ⊨∃z ϕ(z, j(v)) is Σ0 (with parameters j(Lηi) and j(v))
and true in Lτ; hence in Lη, Lηi ⊨∃z ϕ(z, v). Let z ∈Lηi be such that
Lηi ⊨ϕ(z, v); since ei is Σn−1-elementary, we get Lρ ⊨ϕ(ei(z), ei(v)), and so
Lρ ⊨∃x ϕ(x, y).
Now we reach a contradiction. Let α < η and a ﬁnite p ⊂Lρ be such that
η ⊂Hρ
n(α ∪p). First we have
X ⊂M ∩τ = j“η = J“η,
and since J is Σn-elementary, Lemma 18.41 gives
J“η ⊂J“Hρ
n(α ∪p) = Hγ(J“α ∪J“p).
By the minimality of τ, the set J“α ⊂j(α) < τ can be covered by a con-
structible set Y of size |Y | ≤ν. Hence X can be covered by the constructible
set Hγ
n(Y ∪J“p), which has cardinality ≤ν, contrary to Lemma 18.35.
This completes the proof of Case I.
Case II. We use the fact that in this case, ρ must be a limit ordinal. This is
an immediate consequence of this:
Lemma 18.42. If γ is inﬁnite, α < γ and p ⊂Lγ+1 is ﬁnite, then there
exists a ﬁnite set q ⊂Lγ such that
Hγ+1
1
(α ∪q) ∩Lγ ⊂Hγ(α ∪p).

18. Large Cardinals and L
335
Proof. This is quite routine when p = ∅. When p is nonempty, the idea is to
replace members of p by the parameters used in their deﬁnitions over Lγ. We
omit the proof.
⊓⊔
Continuing Case II, we consider the directed system of models (18.38)
with ηi < η where all embeddings are Σ0-elementary embeddings. The index
set D is the set of all i = (α, p, ξ) where α < η, p ⊂Lρ is ﬁnite and ξ < ρ
such that p ∈Lξ. Each model Lηi is the transitive collapse of Hξ(α ∪p).
The closure properties (18.41) of M guarantee that the direct limit of the
system (18.39) is well-founded, say Lγ. We extend j to J : Lρ →Lγ as before,
and as in Case I prove that J is not just Σ0-elementary, but Σ1-elementary.
As in Case I, we reach a contradiction by covering X by a constructible set
of size ≤ν.
Case III. In this case, we consider the directed system (18.38) indexed by
triples i = (α, p, n) where α and p are as before and n ≥1; (α, p, n) ≤(β, q, m)
means α ≤β, p ⊂q and n ≤m. For each i = (α, p, n), Mi = Hρ
n(α ∪p); by
the assumption on ρ, the transitive collapse of Mi is some Lηi with ηi < η,
and if for each k ≥i, ei,k is Σn-elementary (and ei,k ∈Lη).
Again, by (18.41) the direct limit of (18.39) is some Lγ, and for each
i = (α, p, n), ˜ei is Σn-elementary. Extending j to J : Lρ →Lγ as before,
we get J elementary, and reach a contradiction in much the same way as
before.
⊓⊔
It remains to ﬁnd a model M ⊃X with the right closure conditions. This
is provided by the following technical lemma:
Lemma 18.43. There exists a model M ≺Lτ such that X ⊂M, |M| = ν =
|X|, and if j−1 is the transitive collapse of M onto Lη, then
(18.41)
for every directed system {Lηi, ei,k : i, k ∈D} with Lηi, ei,k ∈Lη,
with limit Lρ for some ρ ≥η, and D as in the proof of Lem-
mas 18.36 and 18.37, the direct limit of {j(Lηi), j(ei,k) : i, k ∈D}
is well-founded.
⊓⊔
The construction of M proceeds in ν steps. At each step ξ < ν let
(η(ξ), ρ(ξ)) be the least (η, ρ) such that for some increasing {in}∞
n=0 ⊂D,
there are ordinals βn ∈Lηin such that βn+1 < ein,in+1(βn) for n = 0, 1,
2, . . . . We add the ordinals βn to M at this stage ξ. Using the fact that ν is
a regular uncountable cardinal, one can verify that the resulting model M
satisﬁes (18.41). As the proof is rather long and tedious, we omit it and refer
the reader to either Magidor [1990] or Chapter 32 in Kanamori’s book.

Historical Notes
Theorem 18.1 was discovered by Gaifman (assuming the existence of a measurable
cardinal). Gaifman’s results were announced in [1964] and the proof was published
in [1974], Gaifman’s proof used iterated ultrapowers (see also Gaifman [1967]).
Silver in his thesis (1966, published in [1971b]) developed the present method of
proof, using inﬁnitary combinatorics, and proved the theorem under the weaker
assumption of existence of κ with the property κ →(ℵ1)<ω. Gaifman proved that
if there is a measurable cardinal, then there exists A ⊂ω such that the conclusion
of Theorem 18.1 holds in L[A]. Solovay formulated 0♯and proved that it is a ∆1
3 set
of integers; Silver deduced the existence of 0♯under weaker assumptions.
Construction of models with indiscernibles was introduced by Ehrenfeucht and
Mostowski in [1956].
The equivalence of the existence of 0♯with the existence of a nontrivial elemen-
tary embedding of L (Theorem 18.20) is due to Kunen; the present proof is due
to Silver. Kunen also derived 0♯from the existence of J´onsson cardinals and from
Chang’s Conjecture.
Theorem 18.30 (and its corollaries) is due to Jensen. A proof of the theorem
appeared in Devlin and Jensen [1975]. Jensen’s proof makes use of his ﬁne structure
theory, see Jensen [1972]. The present proof is due to Magidor [1990]. Lemma 18.38
appears in Magidor [1990] and in Kanamori’s book [∞]; Magidor attributes the
proof to Boolos [1970].

19. Iterated Ultrapowers and L[U]
In this chapter we investigate inner models for measurable cardinals, using
Kunen’s technique of iterated ultrapowers.
The Model L[U]
Let κ be a measurable cardinal and let U be a κ-complete nonprincipal ultra-
ﬁlter on κ. Let us consider the model L[U]. By Lemma 13.23, L[U] = L[ ¯U],
where ¯U = U ∩L[U].
Lemma 19.1. In L[U], ¯U is a κ-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on κ.
Moreover, if U is normal, then L[U] ⊨¯U is normal.
Proof. A straightforward veriﬁcation. For instance if U is normal and f ∈
L[U] is a regressive function on κ, then for some γ < κ, the set X = {α :
f(α) = γ} is in U; since X ∈L[U], L[U] ⊨f is constant on some X ∈¯U.
⊓⊔
We shall eventually prove, among others, that the model L[U] satis-
ﬁes GCH. For now, we recall Theorem 13.22(iv) by which 2ℵα = ℵα+1
holds in L[U] for all suﬃciently large α. Speciﬁcally, using the Condensa-
tion Lemma 13.24, we get:
Lemma 19.2. If V = L[A], and if A ⊂P(ωα), then 2ℵα = ℵα+1.
Proof. Let X be a subset of ωα. Let λ be a cardinal such that A ∈Lλ[A]
and X ∈Lλ[A]. Let M be an elementary submodel of (Lλ[A], ∈) such that
ωα ⊂M, A ∈M, X ∈M, and |M| = ℵα. Let π be the transitive collapse
of M, and let N = π(M). Since ωα ⊂M, we have π(Z) = Z for every Z ⊂ωα
that is in M and in particular π(X) = X; also, π(A) = π(A ∩M) = A ∩N.
Now N = Lγ[A ∩N] for some γ, and hence N = Lγ[A]. Since |N| = ℵα, we
have γ < ωα+1 and hence X ∈Lωα+1[A]. It follows that every subset of ωα
is in Lωα+1[A] and therefore 2ℵα = ℵα+1.
⊓⊔
Theorem 19.3 (Silver). If V = L[D] where D is a normal measure on
a measurable cardinal κ, then the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis holds.

340
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Proof. If λ ≥κ, then D ⊂P(λ) and hence 2λ = λ+ by Lemma 19.2. Thus
it suﬃces to show that 2λ = λ+ for every inﬁnite cardinal λ < κ. Let λ < κ
and let us assume that there are more than λ+ subsets of λ; we shall reach
a contradiction. If 2λ > λ+, then there exists a set X ⊂λ that is the λ+th
subset of λ in the canonical well-ordering <L[D] of L[D]. Let α be the least
ordinal such that X ∈Lα[D]. Since the well-ordering <L[D] has the property
that each Lξ[D] is an initial segment of <L[D] every subset of λ preceding X
is also in Lα[D] and hence the set P(λ) ∩Lα[D] has size at least λ+.
We shall now apply Lemma 17.36. Let η be a cardinal such that η > α
and that D ∈Lη[D], and consider the model A = (A, ∈) where A = Lη[D].
We have κ ⊂A, and we consider the set P = P(λ)∩A. Since 2λ < κ, we have
|P| < κ. By Lemma 17.36, there is an elementary submodel B = (B, ∈) ≺A
such that λ ∪{D, X, α} ⊂B, κ ∩B ∈D and |P ∩B| ≤λ. Let π be the
transitive collapse of B onto a transitive set M; we have M = Lγ[π(D)] for
some γ.
Using the normality of D, we show that π(D) = D∩M. Clearly, π(κ) = κ
because |κ ∩B| = κ. The function π is one-to-one, and for every ξ < κ,
π(ξ) ≤ξ. Since D is normal, there is a set Z ∈D such that π(ξ) = ξ for all
ξ ∈Z. Hence if Y ∈B is a set in D, then π(Y ) ⊃π(Y ∩Z) = Y ∩Z, and so
π(Y ) is also in D; similarly, if Y ∈B and π(Y ) ∈D, then Y ∈D. It follows
that π(D) = D ∩M.
Hence M = Lγ[D]. Since λ ⊂B, π maps every subset of λ onto itself,
and so P(λ) ∩M = P(λ) ∩B. In particular, we have π(X) = X and so
X ∈Lγ[D]. By the minimality assumption on α, we have α ≤γ, and this is
a contradiction since on the one hand |P(λ) ∩Lα[D]| ≥λ+, and on the other
hand |P(λ) ∩Lγ[D]| ≤λ.
⊓⊔
One proves rather easily that the model L[D] has only one measurable
cardinal:
Lemma 19.4. If V = L[D] and D is a normal measure on κ, then κ is the
only measurable cardinal.
Proof. Let us assume that there is a measurable cardinal λ ̸= κ and let us
consider the elementary embedding jU : V →M where U is some nonprin-
cipal λ-complete ultraﬁlter on λ. We shall prove that M = L[D] = V thus
getting a contradiction since U /∈M by Lemma 17.9(ii).
Since j is elementary, it is clear that M = L[j(D)]. If λ > κ, then j(D) =
D and so M = L[D]. Thus assume that λ < κ.
Since κ is measurable, the set Z = {α < κ : α is inaccessible and α > λ}
belongs to D. By Lemma 17.9(v), j(κ) = κ and j(α) = α for all α ∈Z. We
shall show that j(D) = D ∩M. It suﬃces to show that j(D) ⊂D ∩M since
j(D) is (in M) an ultraﬁlter. Let X ∈j(D) be represented by f : λ →D. Let
Y = 
ξ<λ f(ξ); we have Y ∈D, and clearly j(Y ) ⊂X. Now if α ∈Y ∩Z,
then j(α) = α and so X ⊃j(Y ) ⊃j“(Y ∩Z) = Y ∩Z ∈D and hence X ∈D.
Thus j(D) = D ∩M, and we have M = L[j(D)] = L[D ∩M] = L[D].
⊓⊔

19. Iterated Ultrapowers and L[U]
341
Iterated Ultrapowers
Let κ be a measurable cardinal and let U be a κ-complete nonprincipal ul-
traﬁlter on κ. Using U, we construct an ultrapower of V mod U; and since
the ultrapower is well-founded, we identify the ultrapower with its transi-
tive collapse, a transitive model M = UltU(V ). Let us denote this transitive
model Ult(1)
U (V ) or just Ult(1). Let j(0) = jU be the canonical embedding
of V in Ult(1), and let κ(1) = j(0)(κ) and U (1) = j(0)(U).
In the model Ult(1), the ordinal κ(1) is a measurable cardinal and U (1) is
a κ(1)-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on κ(1). Thus working inside Ult(1),
we can construct an ultrapower mod U (1): UltU(1)(Ult(1)). Let us denote this
ultrapower Ult(2), and let j(1) be the canonical embedding of Ult(1) in Ult(2)
given by this ultrapower. Let κ(2) = j(1)(κ1) and U (2) = j(1)(U (1)).
We can continue this procedure and obtain transitive models
Ult(1),
Ult(2),
. . . ,
Ult(n),
. . .
(n < ω).
[That we can indeed construct such a sequence of classes follows from the
observation that for each α, the initial segment Vα∩Ult(n) of each ultrapower
in the sequence is deﬁned from an initial segment Vβ of the universe (where
β is something like κ + α + 1).]
Thus we get a sequence of models Ult(n), n < ω (where Ult(0) = V ). For
any n < m, we have an elementary embedding in,m : Ult(n) →Ult(m) which
is the composition of the embeddings j(n), j(n+1), . . . , j(m−1):
in,m(x) = j(m−1)j(m−2) . . . j(n)(x)
(x ∈Ult(n)).
These embeddings form a commutative system; that is,
im,k ◦in,m = in,k
(m < n < k).
We also let κ(n) = i0,n(κ), and U (n) = i0,n(U). Note that κ(0) < κ(1) < . . . <
κ(n) < . . ., and Ult(0) ⊃Ult(1) ⊃. . . ⊃Ult(n) ⊃. . ..
Thus we have a directed system of models and elementary embeddings
(19.1)
{Ult(n), im,n : m, n ∈ω}.
Even though the models are proper classes, the technique of Lemma 12.2 is
still applicable and we can consider the direct limit
(19.2)
(M, E) = lim dirn→ω{Ult(n), in,m},
along with elementary embeddings in,ω : Ult(n) →(M, E). The direct limit
is a model of ZFC and we shall prove below that it is well-founded. Thus we
identify it with a transitive model Ult(ω). (We shall also prove that Ult(ω) ⊂
Ult(n) for every n.)

342
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Let κ(ω) = i0,ω(κ) and U (ω) = i0,ω(U). Since Ult(ω) satisﬁes that U (ω) is
a κ(ω)-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on κ(ω), we can construct, working
inside the model Ult(ω), the ultrapower of Ult(ω) mod U (ω) and the corre-
sponding canonical embedding j(ω).
Let us denote Ult(ω+1) the ultrapower of Ult(ω) mod U (ω) and let iω,ω+1 be
the corresponding canonical elementary embedding. For n < ω, let in,ω+1 =
iω,ω+1 ◦in,ω.
This procedure can be continued, and so we deﬁne the iterated ultrapower
as follows:
(Ult(0), E(0)) = (V, ∈),
(Ult(α+1), E(α+1)) = UltU(α)(Ult(α), E(α)),
(Ult(λ), E(λ)) = lim dirα→λ{(Ult(α), E(α)), iα,β}
(λ limit)
where U (α) = i0,α(U), for each α. We do not know yet that all the mod-
els Ult(α) are well-founded; but we make a convention that if Ult(α) is well-
founded, then we identify it with its transitive collapse.
If M is a transitive model of set theory and U is (in M) a κ-complete
nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on κ, we can construct, within M, the iterated ultra-
powers. Let us denote by Ult(α)
U (M) the αth iterated ultrapower, constructed
in M.
Lemma 19.5 (The Factor Lemma). Let us assume that Ult(α) is well-
founded. Then for each β, the iterated ultrapower Ult(β)
U(α)(Ult(α)) taken
in Ult(α) is isomorphic to the iterated ultrapower Ult(α+β).
Moreover, there is for each β an isomorphism e(α)
β
such that if for all
ξ and η, i(α)
ξ,η denotes the elementary embedding of Ult(ξ)
U(α)(Ult(α)) into
Ult(η)
U(α)(Ult(α)), then the following diagram commutes:

Proof. The proof is by induction on β. If β = 0, then the 0th iterated
ultrapower in Ult(α) is Ult(α); and we let e(α)

be the identity mapping.
If Ult(β)
U(α) and Ult(α+β)
U

β

Ult(β+1)

induces an isomorphism e(α)

If λ is a limit ordinal, then Ult(λ)
U(α) and Ult(α+λ)
U
are (in Ult(α)) the di-

respectively. It is clear that the isomorphisms e(α)
β , β < λ, induce an isomor-
phism e(α)

between Ult(λ)
U(α) and Ult(α+λ)
U

⊓⊔
Corollary 19.6. For every limit ordinal λ, if Ult(λ) is well-founded then
Ult(λ) ⊂Ult(α) for all α < λ.
Proof. Ult(λ) is a class in Ult(α); it is the iterated ultrapower Ult(β)
U(α)(Ult(α))
where α + β = λ.
⊓⊔
Next we show that the iterated ultrapowers Ult(α)
U
are all well-founded.
Theorem 19.7 (Gaifman). Let U be a κ-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter
on κ. Then for every α, the αth iterated ultrapower Ult(α) is well-founded.
Proof. Clearly, if Ult(α) is well-founded, then Ult(α+1) is well-founded. Thus
if γ is the least γ such that Ult(γ) is not well-founded, then γ is a limit
ordinal. The ordinals of the model Ult(γ) are not well-ordered; let ξ be the
least ordinal such that the ordinals of Ultγ below i0,γ(ξ) are not well-ordered.
Let x0, x1, x2, . . . be a descending sequence of ordinals in the model Ult(γ)
such that x0 is less than i0,γ(ξ). Since Ult(γ) is the direct limit of Ult(α),
α < γ, there is an α < γ and an ordinal ν (less than i0,α(ξ)) such that
x0 = iα,γ(ν). Let β be such that α + β = γ.
By our assumptions, the following is true (in V ):
(19.3)
(∀γ′ ≤γ)(∀ξ′ < ξ) the ordinals below i0,γ′(ξ′) in Ult(γ′) are well-
ordered.
When we apply the elementary embedding i0,α to (19.3), we get:
(19.4)
Ult(α) ⊨(∀γ′ ≤i0,α(γ))(∀ξ′ < i0,α(ξ)) the ordinals below i(α)
0,γ′(ξ′) in
Ult(γ′)
U(α) are well-ordered.
Now β ≤γ ≤i0,α(γ), and ν < i0,α(ξ). Hence if we let γ′ = β and ξ′ = ν
in (19.4), we get
Ult(α) ⊨the ordinals below i(α)
0,β(ν) in Ult(β)
U(α) are well-ordered.
By the Factor Lemma, Ult(β)
U(α) is (isomorphic to) Ult(α+β), and i(α)
0,β(ν)
is iα,α+β(ν). Since α + β = γ and iα,γ(ν) = x0, and since being well-ordered
is absolute (for the transitive model Ult(α)), we have:
The ordinals below x0 in Ult(γ) are well-ordered.
But this is a contradiction since x1, x2, x3, . . . is a descending sequence of
ordinals below x0 in Ult(γ).

Thus for any given κ-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter U on κ we have
a transﬁnite sequence of transitive models, the iterated ultrapowers Ult(α)
U (V ),
and the elementary embeddings iα,β : Ult(α) →Ult(β). Let κ(α) = i0,α(κ) for
each α; we shall show that the sequence κ(α), α ∈Ord, is a normal sequence.
Lemma 19.8.
(i) If γ < κ(α), then iα,β(γ) = γ for all β ≥α.
(ii) If X ⊂κ(α) and X ∈Ult(α), then X ⊂iα,β(X) for all β ≥α; in fact
X = κ(α) ∩iα,β(X).
Proof. By the Factor Lemma, it suﬃces to give the proof for α = 0.
(i) As we know, i0,1(γ) = γ for all γ < κ. By induction on β, if i0,β(γ) = γ,
then i0,β+1(γ) = iβ,β+1(γ) = γ because γ < κ(β); if λ is limit and i0,β(ξ) = ξ
for all ξ ≤γ and β < λ, then i0,λ(γ) = γ.
(ii) Follows from (i).
⊓⊔
Lemma 19.9. The sequence ⟨κ(α) : α ∈Ord⟩is normal; i.e., increasing and
continuous.
Proof. For each α, κ(α+1) = iα,α+1(κ(α)) > κ(α). To show that the sequence is
continuous, let λ be a limit ordinal; we want to show that κ(λ) = limα→λ κ(α).
If γ < κ(λ), then γ = iα,λ(δ) for some α < λ and δ < κ(α). Hence γ = δ and
so γ < κ(α).

(∃α < λ) X ⊃{κ(γ) : α ≤γ < λ}.
Proof. Since for no X can both X and its complement contain a ﬁnal segment
of the sequence ⟨κ(γ) : γ < λ⟩, it suﬃces to show that if X ∈D(λ), then there
is an α such that κ(γ) ∈X for all γ ≥α.
There exists an α < λ such that X = iα,λ(Y ) for some Y ∈D(α). Let us
show that κ(γ) ∈X for all γ, α ≤γ < λ. Let γ ≥α and let Z = iα,γ(Y ).
Then Z ∈D(γ) and since D(γ) is a normal measure on κ(γ) in Ult(γ), we have
κ(γ) ∈iγ,γ+1(Z). However, iγ,γ+1(Z) ⊂iγ+1,λ(iγ,γ+1(Z)) = X and hence
κ(γ) ∈X.
⊓⊔
Representation of Iterated Ultrapowers
We shall now give an alternative description of each of the models Ult(α) by
means of a single ultrapower of the universe, using an ultraﬁlter on a certain
Boolean algebra of subsets of κα. This will enable us to obtain more precise
information about the embeddings i0,α : V →Ult(α).

19. Iterated Ultrapowers and L[U]

We shall deal ﬁrst with the ﬁnite iterations. Let U be a κ-complete non-
principal ultraﬁlter on κ. Let us use the symbol ∀∗α for “almost all α < κ:”
∀∗α ϕ(α)
if and only if
{α < κ : ϕ(α)} ∈U.
If X ⊂κn and α < κ, let
X(α) = {⟨α1, . . . , αn−1⟩: ⟨α, α1, . . . , αn−1⟩∈X}.
We deﬁne ultraﬁlters Un on κn, by induction on n:
U1 = U,
Un+1 = {X ⊂κn+1 : ∀∗α X(α) ∈Un}.
Each Un is a nonprincipal κ-complete ultraﬁlter on κn, and if Z ∈U, then
Zn ∈Un. It is easy to see that for all X ⊂κn,
X ∈Un
if and only if
∀∗α0 ∀∗α1 . . . ∀∗αn−1 ⟨α0, . . . , αn−1⟩∈X.
Note that Un concentrates on increasing n-sequences:
{⟨α0, . . . , αn−1⟩∈κn : α0 < . . . < αn−1} ∈Un
(because ∀α0 (∀α1 > α0) . . . (∀αn−1 > αn−2) α0 < . . . < αn−1).
Lemma 19.11. For every n,
UltUn(V ) = Ult(n)(V )
and jUn = i0,n.
Here jUn is the canonical embedding j : V →UltUn(V ).
Proof. By induction on n. The case n = 1 is trivial. Let us assume that
the lemma is true for n and let us consider UltUn+1. Let f be a function
on κn+1. For each t = ⟨α0, . . . , αn−1⟩∈κn, let f(t) be the function on κ
deﬁned by f(t)(ξ) = f(α0, . . . , αn−1, ξ) and let F be a function on κn such
that F(t) = f(t) for all t ∈κn. In UltUn = Ult(n), the function F represents
a function on jUn(κ) = κ(n): Let ˜f = [F]Un. This way we assign to each
function f on κn+1 a function ˜f ∈Ult(n) on κ(n).
Conversely, if h ∈Ult(n) is a function on κ(n), there is an f on κn+1 such
that h = ˜f: There exists some F on κn such that h = [F]Un and that for
each t ∈κn, F(t) is a function on κ; thus we let f(α0, . . . , αn) be the value
of F(α0, . . . , αn−1) at αn.

346
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
We shall show that the correspondence [f]Un+1 →[ ˜f]U(n) is an isomor-
phism between UltUn+1 and Ult(n+1) = UltU(n)(Ult(n)). We have
[f]Un+1 = [g]Un+1 ↔∀∗α0 . . . ∀∗αn−1 ∀∗ξ f(α0, . . . , αn−1, ξ) = g(α0, . . . ,
αn−1, ξ)
↔∀∗t {ξ < κ : f(t)(ξ) = g(t)(ξ)} ∈U
↔UltUn ⊨{ξ < jUn(κ) : ˜f(ξ) = ˜g(ξ)} ∈jUn(U)
↔Ult(n) ⊨{ξ < κ(n) : ˜f(ξ) = ˜g(ξ)} ∈U (n)
↔[ ˜f]U(n) = [˜g]U(n)
and similarly for ∈in place of =.
Thus UltUn+1 = Ult(n+1). To show that jUn+1 = i0,n+1, let f = cx be
the constant function on κn+1 with value x. It follows that ˜f is the constant
function on κ(n) with value i0,n(x), and therefore
jUn+1(x) = [cx]Un+1 = in,n+1(i0,n(x)) = i0,n+1(x).
⊓⊔
The inﬁnite iterations are described with the help of ultraﬁlters UE on κE,
where E ranges over ﬁnite sets of ordinal numbers. If E is a ﬁnite set of
ordinals, then the order isomorphism π between n = |E| and E induces, in
a natural way, an ultraﬁlter UE corresponding to Un:
UE = {π(X) : X ⊂κn}
where π(⟨α0, . . . , αn−1⟩) = t ∈κE with t(π(k)) = αk for all k = 0, . . . , n −1.
If S is any set of ordinals and E ⊂S is a ﬁnite set, we deﬁne a mapping
inE,S (an inclusion map) of P(κE) into P(κS) as follows:
inE,S(X) = {t ∈κS : t↾E ∈X}
(all X ⊂κE).
Lemma 19.12. If E ⊂F are ﬁnite sets of ordinals, then for each X ⊂κE,
X ∈UE
if and only if
inE,F (X) ∈UF .
Proof. By induction on (m, n) where m = |E| and n = |F|. Let E ⊂F be
ﬁnite sets of ordinals. Let a be the least element of F, and let us assume
that a ∈E (if a /∈E, then the proof is similar). Let E′ = E −{a} and
F ′ = F −{a}.
If X ⊂κE, let us deﬁne for each α < κ, the set X(α) ⊂κE′ as follows:
X(α) = {t↾E′ : t ∈X and t(a) = α}; for Z ⊂κF , let us deﬁne Z(α) ⊂κF ′
similarly (for all α < κ). It should be clear that
(19.6)
X ∈UE ↔∀∗α X(α) ∈UE′
and
Z ∈UF ↔∀∗α Z(α) ∈UF ′.
Now we observe that if Z = inE,F (X), then Z(α) = inE′,F ′(X(α)), and the
lemma for E, F follows from (19.6) and the induction hypothesis.
⊓⊔

Let us now consider an ordinal number α. If E ⊂α is a ﬁnite set, let us
say that a set Z ⊂κα has support E if Z = inE,α(X) for some X ⊂κE.
Note that if Z has support E and E ⊂F, then Z also has support F. Let Bα
denote the collection of all subsets of κα that have ﬁnite support. (Bα, ⊂) is
a Boolean algebra.
Let Uα be the following ultraﬁlter on Bα: For each Z ∈Bα, if Z =
inE,α(X) where X ⊂κE, let
Z ∈Uα
if and only if
X ∈UE.
By Lemma 19.12, the deﬁnition of Uα does not depend on the choice of
support E of Z.
We shall now construct an ultrapower mod Uα. If f is a function on κα, let
us say that f has a ﬁnite support E ⊂α if f(t) = f(s) whenever t, s ∈κα are
such that t↾E = s↾E. In other words, there is g on κE such that f(t) = g(t↾E)
for all t ∈κα. Let us consider only functions f on κα with ﬁnite support and
deﬁne
(19.7)
f =α g
if and only if
{t : f(t) = g(t)} ∈Uα,
f Eα g
if and only if
{t : f(t) ∈g(t)} ∈Uα.
The sets on the right-hand side of (19.7) have ﬁnite support, namely E ∪F
where E and F are, respectively, supports of f and g.
Let (UltUα(V ), Eα) be the model whose elements are equivalence classes
mod =α of functions on κα with ﬁnite support.
We are now in a position to state the main lemma.
Lemma 19.13 (The Representation Lemma). For every α, the model
(UltUα(V ), Eα) is (isomorphic to) the αth iterated ultrapower Ult(α)
U (V ), and
the canonical embedding jUα : V →UltUα is equal to i0,α. Moreover, if α ≤β
and [f]Uα ∈Ult(α), then iα,β([f]Uα) = [g]Uβ where g is deﬁned by g(t) =
f(t↾α) for all t ∈κβ.
Proof. By induction on α. The induction step from α to α + 1 follows closely
the proof of Lemma 19.11; thus let us describe only how to assign to [f]Uα+1
the corresponding [ ˜f]U(α) in Ult(α+1). Let f be a function on κα+1 with
support E ∪{α} where E ⊂α. For each t ∈κα let f(t)(ξ) = f(t⌢ξ) for all
ξ < κ, and let F be a function on κα (with support E) such that F(t) = f(t)
for all t ∈κα. Let ˜f = [F]Uα; ˜f is in Ult(α) and is a function on κ(α).
When λ is a limit ordinal, a routine veriﬁcation shows that UltUλ is the
direct limit of {UltUα, iα,β : α, β < λ} and that the embeddings iα,λ commute
with the iα,β.

Uniqueness of the Model L[D]
Theorem 19.14 (Kunen).
(i) If V = L[D] and D is a normal measure on κ, then κ is the only
measurable cardinal and D is the only normal measure on κ.
(ii) For every ordinal κ, there is at most one D ⊂P(κ) such that D ∈L[D]
and
L[D] ⊨D is a normal measure on κ.
(iii) If κ1 < κ2 are ordinals and if D1, D2 are such that
L[Di] ⊨Di is a normal measure on κi
(i = 1, 2)
then L[D2] is an iterated ultrapower of L[D1]; i.e., there is α such that
L[D2] = Ult(α)
D1 (L[D1]), and D2 = i0,α(D1).
The proof of Theorem 19.14 uses iterated ultrapowers. The following
lemma uses the representation of iterated ultrapowers.
Lemma 19.15. Let U be a κ-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on κ and let,
for each α, i0,α : V →Ult(α) be the embedding of V in its αth iterated
ultrapower.
(i) If α is a cardinal and α > 2κ, then i0,α(κ) = α.
(ii) If λ is a strong limit cardinal, λ > α, and if cf λ > κ, then i0,α(λ) = λ.
Proof. It follows from the Representation Lemma that for all ξ, η, the ordinals
below i0,ξ(η) are represented by functions with ﬁnite support from κξ into η
and hence |i0,ξ(η)| ≤|ξ| · |η|κ.
(i) We have i0,α(κ) = limξ→α i0,ξ(κ), and for each ξ < α, |i0,ξ(κ)| ≤
|ξ| · 2κ < α. Hence i0,κ(κ) = α.
(ii) Since cf λ > κ, every function f : κα →λ with ﬁnite support is
bounded below λ: There exists γ < λ such that f(t) < γ for all t ∈κα. Hence
i0,α(λ) = limγ→λ i0,α(γ). Since λ is strong limit, we have |i0,α(γ)| < λ for all
γ < λ and hence i0,λ = λ.
⊓⊔
It is clear from the proof that in (ii) it is enough to assume that γκ < λ
for all cardinals γ < λ, instead of that λ is a strong limit cardinal.
Let U ⊂P(κ). If θ is a cardinal and U ∈Lθ[U], then by absoluteness of
relative constructibility, every elementary submodel of (Lθ[U], ∈) that con-
tains U and all ordinals < κ, is isomorphic to M = Lα[U] for some α. (If
π is the transitive collapse of the submodel, then π(U) = U ∩M ∈M, and
M = Lα[U].) Let θ be a cardinal such that U ∈Lθ[U] and let us consider
the model (Lθ[U], ∈, U) where U is regarded as a constant. This model has
a deﬁnable well-ordering, hence deﬁnable Skolem functions, and so we can
talk about Skolem hulls of subsets of Lθ[U].

19. Iterated Ultrapowers and L[U]
349
Lemma 19.16. Assume that in L[D], D is a normal measure on κ. Let A be
a set of ordinals of size at least κ+ and let θ be a cardinal such that D ∈Lθ[D]
and A ⊂Lθ[D]. Let M ≺(Lθ[D], ∈, D) be the Skolem hull of κ ∪A. Then
M contains all subsets of κ in L[D].
For every X ⊂κ in L[D] there is a Skolem term t such that for some
α1, . . . , αn < κ and γ1, . . . , γm ∈A,
Lθ[D] ⊨X = t[α1, . . . , αn, γ1, . . . , γm, D].
Proof. Let π be the transitive collapse of M. We have π(M) = Lα[D] for
some α, and since A ⊂M, we have necessarily α ≥κ+. By Lemma 19.2,
every X ⊂κ in L[D] is in Lκ+[D], and since π is the identity on κ, we have
X ∈M for all X ⊂κ in L[D].
⊓⊔
The following is the key lemma in the proof of uniqueness of L[D]:
Lemma 19.17. Let D ⊂P(κ) be such that D ∈L[D] and
L[D] ⊨D is a normal measure on κ.
For each α, let Ult(α)
D (L[D]) denote the αth iterated ultrapower, constructed
inside L[D]. Let i0,α be the corresponding elementary embedding. Let λ be
a regular cardinal greater than κ+, and let F be the closed unbounded ﬁlter
on λ. Then:
(i) i0,λ(D) = F ∩Ult(λ)
D (L[D]);
(ii) Ult(λ)
D (L[D]) = L[F].
Proof. First, we have i0,λ(κ) = λ by Lemma 19.15(i) because λ > κ+ ≥
(κ+)L[D] = (2κ)L[D]. Let D(λ) = i0,λ(D) and let M = Ult(λ)
D (L[D]). If X ∈
D(λ), then by (19.5), X contains a closed unbounded subset and hence X ∈F.
Since D(λ) is an ultraﬁlter in M and F is a ﬁlter, it follows that D(λ) = F ∩M.
As for (ii) we have
M = Ult(λ)(L[D]) = L[D(λ)] = L[F ∩M] = L[F].
⊓⊔
We shall now prove parts (i) and (ii) of Kunen’s Theorem. We already
know by Lemma 19.4 that in L[D], κ is the only measurable cardinal. Thus
(i) and (ii) follow from this lemma:
Lemma 19.18. Let D1, D2 ⊂P(κ) be such that D1 ∈L[D1], D2 ∈L[D2]
and
L[Di] ⊨Di is a normal measure on κ
(i = 1, 2).
Then D1 = D2.

350
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Proof. Let D1, D2 ⊂P(κ) be such that L[Di] ⊨Di is a normal measure on κ,
for i = 1, 2; we want to show that D1 = D2. By symmetry, it suﬃces to show
that if X ⊂κ is in D1, then X ∈D2.
Let λ be a regular cardinal greater than κ+ and let F be the closed
unbounded ﬁlter on λ. Let us consider the λth iterated ultrapowers Mi =
Ult(λ)
Di (L[Di]) (i = 1, 2), and the corresponding embeddings i1
0,λ, i2
0,λ.
By Lemma 19.17, M1 = M2 = L[F], and i1
0,λ(D1) = i2
0,λ(D2) = F ∩L[F].
Let G = F ∩L[F].
Let A be a set of ordinals, |A| = κ+, such that all γ ∈A are greater than λ
and that i1
0,λ(γ) = i2
0,λ(γ) for all γ ∈A; such a set exists by Lemma 19.15(ii).
Let θ be a cardinal greater than all γ ∈A such that i1
0,λ(θ) = i2
0,λ(θ) = θ.
Now let X be a subset of κ such that X ∈D1. By Lemma 19.16, X belongs
to the Skolem hull of κ ∪A in (Lθ[D1], ∈, D1). Thus there is a Skolem term t
such that for some α1, . . . , αn < κ and γ1, . . . , γm ∈A,
(19.8)
Lθ[D1] ⊨X = t[α1, . . . , αn, γ1, . . . , γm, D1].
Let Y ∈Lθ[D2] be such that
(19.9)
Lθ[D2] ⊨Y = t[α1, . . . , αn, γ1, . . . , γm, D2].
We shall show that Y ∈D2 and Y = X, hence X ∈D2.
First we observe that i1
0,λ(X) = i2
0,λ(Y ): Let Z1 = i1
0,λ(X) and Z2 =
i2
0,λ(Y ). We have i1
0,λ(α) = α, i1
0,λ(γ) = γ, i1
0,λ(θ) = θ, and i1
0,λ(D1) = G; and
thus when we apply i1
0,λ to (19.8), we get
(19.10)
Lθ[G] ⊨Z1 = t[α1, . . . , αn, γ1, . . . , γm, G].
Similarly, when we apply i2
0,λ to (19.8), we get (19.10) with Z2 instead of Z1.
Thus Z1 = Z2.
Now, by Lemma 19.8(ii), we have X = Z1 ∩κ and Y = Z2 ∩κ. Hence
X = Y .
Finally, since i2
0,λ(Y ) ∈F, it follows that i2
0,λ(Y ) ∈i2
0,λ(D2) and hence
Y ∈D2. Thus X ∈D2 and this completes the proof of D1 = D2.
⊓⊔
The key lemma in the proof of Theorem 19.14(iii) is the following:
Lemma 19.19. Let κ, D be such that L[D] ⊨D is a normal measure on κ,
and let γ be an ordinal such that κ < γ < i0,1(κ), where i0,1 is the embedding
of L[D] in UltD(L[D]). Then there is no U ⊂P(γ) such that L[U] ⊨U is
a normal measure on γ.
Proof. Let us assume that on the contrary there is such a U. Let j be the
canonical embedding of L[U] in UltU(L[U]). Let λ = |γ|++, and let F be the
closed unbounded ﬁlter on λ. Let G = F ∩L[F].
Since L[U] ⊨GCH, we have j(λ) = λ (see the remark following Lem-
ma 19.15). In L[U], G is the λth iterate of U, and in L[j(U)], G is the
j(λ)th iterate of j(U); hence j(G) = G.

19. Iterated Ultrapowers and L[U]
351
Let f : κ →κ be a function in L[D] such that f represents γ in UltD(L[D]).
Since D is normal, the diagonal d(α) = α represents κ, and thus we have
(i0,1(f))(κ) = γ. Let i0,λ be the embedding of L[D] in Ult(λ)
D (L[D]) = L[G].
It is clear that (i0,λ(f))(κ) = γ.
Now let A be a set of ordinals such that |A| = κ+, that all ξ ∈A are
greater than λ, and that i0,λ(ξ) = ξ and j(ξ) = ξ for all ξ ∈A. Let θ be
a cardinal greater than all ξ ∈A, such that i0,λ(θ) = θ and j(θ) = θ.
By Lemma 19.16, the function f is deﬁnable in Lθ[D] from A ∪κ ∪{D};
thus i0,λ(f) is deﬁnable in Lθ[G] from A ∪κ ∪{G}. Hence γ is deﬁnable
in Lθ[G] from A ∪κ ∪{G} ∪{κ}, and so there is a Skolem term t such that
(19.11)
Lθ[G] ⊨γ = t[α1, . . . , αn, ξ1, . . . , ξm, G, κ].
for some α1, . . . , αn < κ and ξ1, . . . , ξm ∈A.
Now we apply the elementary embedding j to (19.11); and since j(θ) = θ,
j(G) = G, j(ξ) = ξ for ξ ∈A, and j(α) = α for all α < γ (hence j(κ) = κ),
we have
Lθ[G] ⊨j(γ) = t[α1, . . . , αn, ξ1, . . . , ξm, G, κ].
which is a contradiction because j(γ) > γ.
⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 19.14(iii). Let κ1 < κ2 and let D1, D2 be such that L[Di] ⊨
D is a normal measure on κi (i = 1, 2). Let i0,α denote the embedding of
L[D1] in Ult(α)
D1 (L[D1]) and let α be the unique α such that i0,α(κ1) ≤κ2 <
i0,α+1(κ1). By Lemma 19.19 (if we let κ = i0,α(κ1), D = i0,α(D1), and
γ = κ2), it is necessary that κ2 = i0,α(κ1). Now the statement follows from
the uniqueness of i0,α(D1).
⊓⊔
Thus we have proved that the model V = L[D] (where D is a normal
measure on κ) is unique, has only one measurable cardinal and only one
normal measure on κ, and it satisﬁes the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis.
The next lemma completes the characterization of L[D] by showing that for
every κ-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter U on κ, L[U] is equal to L[D].
Lemma 19.20. Let U be a nonprincipal κ-complete ultraﬁlter on κ. Then
L[U] = L[D] where D is the normal measure on κ in L[D].
Proof. By the absoluteness of L[D], we have L[D] ⊂L[U] because L[U] sat-
isﬁes that κ is measurable. Thus it suﬃces to prove that U ∩L[D] ∈L[D].
Let j = jU be the canonical embedding j : V →UltU(V ), and let γ = j(κ).
Let d(α) = α be the diagonal function and let δ be the ordinal represented
in UltU(V ) by d; thus
(19.12)
X ∈U
if and only if
δ ∈j(X)
for all X ⊂κ.

352
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Since L[j(D)] ⊨j(D) is a normal measure on γ, there exists an α such
that γ = i0,α(κ), j(D) = i0,α(D), and L[j(D)] = Ult(α)
D (L[D]). We shall show
that for every X ⊂κ in L[D],
(19.13)
j(X) = i0,α(X).
This, together with (19.12), gives
(19.14)
U ∩L[D] = {X ∈L[D] : X ⊂κ and δ ∈i0,α(X)}
and therefore U ∩L[D] ∈L[D].
The proof of (19.13) uses Lemma 19.16 again. We let A be a set of size κ+
of ordinals greater than α such that i0,α(ξ) = j(ξ) = ξ for all ξ ∈A, and let
θ be a cardinal greater than all ξ ∈A, such that i0,λ(θ) = j(θ) = θ.
If X ⊂κ is in L[D], then there is a Skolem term t such that
Lθ[D] ⊨X = t[α1, . . . , αn, ξ1, . . . , ξm, D].
for some α1, . . . , αn < κ and ξ1, . . . , ξm ∈A. Since i0,α and j agree on
κ ∪A ∪{θ}, and i0,α(D) = j(D), it follows that i0,α(X) = j(X).
⊓⊔
The proof of Lemma 19.20 gives additional information about κ-complete
ultraﬁlters in L[D]. Let us assume that V = L[D] and let U be a nonprincipal
κ-complete ultraﬁlter on κ. By (19.14), we have
(19.15)
U = {X ⊂κ : δ ∈i0,α(X)}
where α is such that j(κ) = i0,α(κ), and δ < j(κ). Note that for any β ≥α,
we also have U = {X ⊂κ : δ ∈i0,β(X)}. Now a simple observation gives the
following characterization of κ-complete ultraﬁlters on κ in L[D]:
Lemma 19.21. Assume V = L[D]. If U is a nonprincipal κ-ultraﬁlter on κ,
then there exists some δ < i0,ω(κ) such that
U = {X ⊂κ : δ ∈i0,ω(X)}.
Proof. Let j = jU be the canonical embedding of V = L[D] in UltU. We have
j(κ) = i0,α(κ) for some α. We shall show that α is a ﬁnite number; then the
lemma follows by (19.15).
First we note that because V = L[D] = L[U], we have Ult(α)
D
= UltU =
L[i0,α(D)] = L[j(U)]. Now if α ≥ω, then in Ult(α)
D , i0,ω(κ) is an inaccessible
cardinal (because it is measurable in Ult(ω)
D ), while in UltU, i0,ω(κ) has coﬁ-
nality ω (because it has coﬁnality ω in V and UltU contains all ω-sequences
of ordinals). Hence α < ω.
⊓⊔
Corollary 19.22. If V = L[D], there are exactly κ+ nonprincipal κ-complete
ultraﬁlters on κ.
Proof. If κ is measurable, then it is easy to obtain 2κ nonprincipal κ-complete
ultraﬁlters on κ (because there are 2κ subsets of κ of size κ such that |X∩Y | <
κ for any two of them). By Lemma 19.21, if V = L[D], there are at most
|i0,ω(κ)| = κ+ of them.
⊓⊔

Indiscernibles for L[D]
If there exist two measurable cardinals, κ < λ, then it is possible to prove
analogous theorems for the model L[D] as we did in Chapter 18 for L under
the assumption of one measurable cardinal. More speciﬁcally, one can prove
the existence of a closed unbounded set I ⊂κ and a closed unbounded class J
of ordinals bigger than κ, such that I ∪J contains all uncountable cardinals
except κ, that every X ∈L[D] is deﬁnable in D from I ∪J, and that the
elements of I ∪J are indiscernibles for L[D] in the following sense: The truth
value of
L[D] ⊨ϕ[α1, . . . , αn, β1, . . . , βm]
is independent of the choice of α1 < . . . < αn ∈I and β1 < . . . < βm ∈J. In
analogy with Silver indiscernibles, the above situations can be described by
means of a certain set of formulas ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , ym), which is called 0†
(zero-dagger).
If 0† exists, then one can prove the consistency of the theory ZFC +
“there exists a measurable cardinal;” and hence one cannot prove the relative
consistency of “0† exists” with ZFC + “there exists a measurable cardinal.”
We shall not give details of the theory of indiscernibles for L[D]. Instead,
let us present an argument showing that if there exist two measurable car-
dinals, κ < λ, then there is a proper class of cardinals that are inaccessible
in L[D].
Let U be a normal measure on λ and let for each α, i0,α be the elementary
embedding of V in Ult(α)
U ; let iα,β : Ult(α) →Ult(β). Let C be the class of all
cardinals α such that cf α > λ and γλ < α for all γ < α. By Lemma 19.15, if
α ∈C, then i0,α(κ) = α and i0,α(β) = β for all β ∈C greater than α. Hence
if α, β ∈C, then iα,β(α) = β and iα,β(γ) = γ for all γ ∈C that are greater
than β or less than α.
Now if D is a normal measure on κ, then because κ < λ, we have iα,β(D) =
D for all α, β ∈C. Thus each iα,β (α, β ∈C), restricted to L[D], is an
elementary embedding of L[D] in L[D] such that iα,β(α) = β and iα,β(γ) = γ
for all γ ∈C below α or above β. Using these embeddings iα,β (as in the
proof of Lemma 18.26), one shows that the elements of C are indiscernibles
for the model L[D].
Since some elements of C are regular cardinals, and some are limit cardi-
nals, it follows that all elements of C are inaccessible cardinals in L[D].
In the above argument, it was not necessary that κ be a measurable
cardinal, only that κ be measurable in L[D]. Thus we have proved:
Lemma 19.23. Let κ be a measurable cardinal, and assume that:
(19.16)
For some γ < κ, there exists a D ⊂P(γ) such that L[D] ⊨D is
a normal measure on γ.
Then there are arbitrarily large successor cardinals that are inaccessible
in L[D].

We have proved in Lemma 19.21 that if U is a nonprincipal κ-complete
ultraﬁlter on κ, then jU(κ) < i0,ω(κ), where i0,ω is the embedding of L[D] in
Ult(ω)
D (L[D]). We can prove a stronger statement:
Lemma 19.24. If there is a κ-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter U on κ such
that jU(κ) ≥i0,ω(κ), then (19.16) holds.
Proof. Let us work in the model M = UltU(V ). The cardinal j(κ) is mea-
surable while i0,ω(κ) has coﬁnality ω, and so i0,ω(κ) < j(κ). Let F be the
collection of all subsets X of i0,ω(κ) such that X ⊃{i0,n(κ) : n ≥n0} for
some n0. Using Lemma 19.10, we proceed as in the proof of Lemma 19.17 to
show that
L[F] ⊨F ∩L[F] is a normal measure on i0,ω(κ).
Thus (19.16) holds in M for j(κ). Since j is an elementary embedding,
(19.16) holds in V for κ.
⊓⊔
Corollary 19.25. If κ is a measurable cardinal and 2κ > κ+, then (19.16)
holds. Consequently, it is impossible to prove the consistency of “κ is mea-
surable and 2κ > κ+” relative to ZFC + “κ is a measurable cardinal.”
Proof. On the one hand, |i0,ω(κ)| = (κ+)L[D] ≤κ+; on the other hand, if
U is any κ-complete ultraﬁlter on κ, we have jU(κ) > 2κ > κ+.
⊓⊔
General Iterations
We shall now describe two generalizations of iterated ultrapowers. The ﬁrst
deals with iteration of ultrapowers of transitive models by ultraﬁlters that
are not necessarily members of the model.
Let M be a transitive model of set theory. In fact, it is not necessary
for the theory of iterated ultrapowers to assume that M satisﬁes all axioms
of ZFC. It is enough to assume that M is a model of ZFC−, set theory without
the Power Set Axiom. Thus M can be a set (e.g., (Lα, ∈) is a model of ZFC−
when α is a regular uncountable cardinal in L).
Let κ be a cardinal in M, and let U be an M-ultraﬁlter on κ (Deﬁni-
tion 18.21).
Deﬁnition 19.26. An M-ultraﬁlter U on κ is iterable if
(19.17)
{α < κ : Xα ∈U} ∈M
whenever
⟨Xα : α < κ⟩∈M.
We shall consider normal iterable M-ultraﬁlters, i.e., M-ultraﬁlters that
are nonprincipal, κ-complete, normal (as in Deﬁnition 18.21) and iterable.
Let U be a normal iterable M-ultraﬁlter on κ. Using functions in M, we
form an ultrapower UltU(M), which may or may not be well-founded. Let
j = jU be the canonical elementary embedding j : M →UltU(M).

19. Iterated Ultrapowers and L[U]
355
Lemma 19.27. If UltU(M) is well-founded, and N is the transitive collapse
of the ultrapower, then
(i) P M(κ) = P N(κ).
(ii) j“U is a normal iterable N-ultraﬁlter on j(κ).
Proof. (i) It is a routine veriﬁcation by induction that j(α) = α for all α < κ.
For every X ∈P M(κ), we have X = j(X) ∩κ, and therefore X ∈P N(κ),
verifying P M(κ) ⊂P N(κ).
If Y ∈P N(κ), let f ∈M be such that Y ∈[f]U. Then Y ∈P M(κ) follows
(by (19.17)) because for all α < κ,
α ∈Y
if and only if
{ξ < κ : α ∈f(ξ)} ∈U.
(ii) Let W = j“U. To verify that N and W satisfy (19.17), let ⟨Xα :
α < j(κ)⟩∈N be represented in the ultrapower by f ∈M. We may assume
that for each α, Xα ⊂j(κ), and that f(ξ) = ⟨Xξ
η : η < κ⟩for each ξ < κ.
By (19.17), we have {(ξ, η) : Xξ
η ∈U} ∈M. Thus if we deﬁne g(ξ) = {η < κ :
Xξ
η ∈U}, we have g ∈M. Now it is routine to show that [g]U = {α < j(κ) :
Xα ∈W}.
⊓⊔
If j is an elementary embedding j : M →N with critical point κ, and
if P M(κ) = P N(κ), then the M-ultraﬁlter {X : κ ∈j(X)} is iterable; see
Exercise 19.8.
Let U be a normal iterable M-ultraﬁlter on κ. If the ultrapower UltU(M)
is well-founded, let M1 be its transitive collapse, let j : M →M1 be the
canonical elementary embedding, and let U (1) = j“U; U (1) is a normal iter-
able M1-ultraﬁlter on κ(1) = j(κ). We can now proceed with the iteration
as when M = V and U ∈M, as long as the iterated ultrapowers are well-
founded. At limit stages we take direct limits, and use the following lemma
that is quite routine to verify:
Lemma 19.28. Let α be a limit ordinal, and let for each β < α, U (β) be
a normal iterable Mβ-ultraﬁlter on κ(β), and assume that the direct limit
of {(Mβ, ∈, U (β)), iβ,γ : β, γ < α} is well-founded. If (Mα, ∈, U (α)) is the
transitive direct limit then U (α) is a normal iterable Mα-ultraﬁlter on κ(α) =
limβ→α κ(β).
⊓⊔
The Representation Lemma 19.13 holds true in the present context as well.
The M-ultraﬁlters Uα are deﬁned as before, starting with M-ultraﬁlters Un
on P M(κn):
(19.18)
X ∈Un+1
if and only if
{ξ < κ : X(ξ) ∈Un} ∈U
where X(ξ) = {⟨ξ1, . . . , ξn⟩: ⟨ξ, ξ1, . . . , ξn⟩∈X}. By induction on n one
proves that each Un is an iterable M-ultraﬁlter on κn.
To deﬁne the ultraﬁlters Uα and the ultrapowers UltUα(M), we restrict
ourselves, as before, to sets Z ⊂κα and functions f on κα with ﬁnite support,

356
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
with the additional restriction imposed by M: If E = {α1, . . . , αn} with
α1 < . . . < αn is the support of Z or f then the restriction of Z or f to κE
is such that its isomorph ¯Z ⊂κn or ¯f : κn →M is an element of M.
In general, iterated ultrapowers of M by an M-ultraﬁlter need not be
well-founded. If, however, all countable iterations are well-founded then all
iterations are well-founded (Exercise 19.9). An important suﬃcient condi-
tion for well-foundedness of iterated ultrapowers is the following (external
σ-completeness):
(19.19)
For any {Xn}n∈ω ⊂U, ∞
n=0 Xn is nonempty
(see Exercise 19.10).
The other generalization deals with iterated ultrapowers of an inner model
where each successor step α + 1 of the iteration is obtained as an ultrapower
of Mα by an arbitrary measure in Mα.
Deﬁnition 19.29. An iterated ultrapower of an inner model M is a sequence
⟨Mγ : γ ≤λ⟩constructed as follows:
(i) M0 = M.
(ii) Mγ+1 = UltU(γ)(Mγ) where U (γ) ∈Mγ is a κγ-complete ultraﬁlter
on κγ, and the ultrapower is constructed in Mγ; iγ,γ+1 : Mγ →Mγ+1
is the canonical embedding, and for all α < γ, iα,γ+1 = iγ,γ+1 ◦iα,γ.
(iii) If γ is a limit ordinal, then Mγ is the direct limit of {Mα, iα,β : α ≤
β < γ}.
Theorem 19.30 (Mitchell). Let M be an inner model of ZFC. Every it-
erated ultrapower of M is well-founded.
Proof. First we outline the proof of the theorem for M = V . The idea is to
represent each iterated ultrapower Mγ as an ultrapower by an ultraﬁlter Uγ.
The ultraﬁlters Uγ are deﬁned by induction on γ. For each γ we deﬁne an
ordinal function kγ (that represents κγ in the ultraproduct by Uγ), the set Dγ
(the domain of kγ), the algebra Pγ of subsets of Dγ, the class Fγ of functions
on Dγ and the ultraﬁlter Uγ on Pγ.
The domain Dγ of kγ is the set
{p ∈Ordγ : ∀α < γ p(α) < kα(p↾α)}.
The algebra Pγ and the class Fγ are
Pγ = {X ⊂Dγ : X has ﬁnite support},
Fγ = {f ∈V Dγ : f has ﬁnite support}.
If γ is a limit ordinal, we let Uγ = 
α<γ Uα. If γ = α + 1, then assume that
Mα is transitive and isomorphic to UltUα(V ). Let kα ∈Fα be a function
that represents κα, and let g ∈Fα be a function that represents U (α), in

19. Iterated Ultrapowers and L[U]
357
the ultrapower Mα, i.e., [kα]Uα = κα, [g]Uα = U (α). Thus for Uα-almost all
p ∈Dα, gα(p) is an ultraﬁlter on kα(p). For X ∈Pα+1 we let
X ∈Uα+1
if and only if
{p ∈Dα : X(p) ∈g(p)} ∈Uα
where X(p) = {ξ < kα(p) : p ∪{(α, ξ)} ∈X}. It is now routine to verify that
UltUα+1(V ) is isomorphic to UltU(α)(Mα).
The proof that each UltUα(V ) is well-founded uses the argument presented
in Exercise 19.10.
Now if M is an arbitrary inner model, and ⟨Mγ : γ ≤λ⟩is an iterated
ultrapower that is not necessarily deﬁned inside M, we use an absoluteness
argument. We can still use the representation of Mγ by UltUα(M); in this
case the functions p ∈Ordγ, the sets X ⊂Dγ and the functions f ∈V Dγ
are all assumed to be members of M.
If E ⊂γ is a ﬁnite set, then PE and FE denote the subsets of Pγ and Fγ,
respectively, of those sets or functions whose support is E. Let UE be the
restriction of Uγ to PE, and let ME be the ultrapower of M mod UE (using
functions in FE). For E ⊂E′, let iE,E′ be the canonical elementary embed-
ding of ME in ME′ and let iE,γ be the embedding of ME in Mγ.
If some iterated ultrapower of M is not well-founded, then, as in Exer-
cise 19.9, one can show that there is a countable λ such that an iterated
ultrapower ⟨Mγ : γ ≤λ⟩is not well-founded. Let κ be the supremum of all
the κγ, γ ≤λ, in this iteration. Let {an}n<ω be a decreasing sequence of ordi-
nals in Mλ, and let E0 ⊂E1 ⊂. . . ⊂En ⊂. . . be a sequence of ﬁnite subsets
of λ such that ∞
n=0 En = λ, and that each En is a support for (a function
representing) an. For each n, let bn ∈MEn be such that an = iEn,λ(bn). Let
η be suﬃciently large so that bn ∈V M
η
for all n. Thus there exists a sequence
{(En, Mn, bn)}∞
n=0 such that E0 ⊂E1 ⊂. . . ⊂En ⊂. . . are ﬁnite subsets
of λ, that each Mn is an iterated ultrapower of M indexed by En, bn is an
ordinal in Mn = UltEn(M), and for each n, Mn+1 ⊨iEn,En+1(bn) > bn+1.
As each Mn is a ﬁnite iteration, it is clear that it is a class in M. Consider,
in M, the set of all triples (E, N, b) such that E is a ﬁnite subset of λ, N is
a ﬁnite ultrapower iteration indexed by E and using measures on ordinals ≤
κ, and b is an ordinal in N represented by a function in Vη. Let (E′, N ′, b′) <
(E, N, b) if E′ ⊃E and if N ′ ⊨iE,E′(b) > b′. We have established that
this relation < is not well-founded (in the universe). Thus by absoluteness
of well-foundedness, this relation is not well-founded in M. However, that
means that there is an iterated ultrapower constructed in M that is not well-
founded, contrary to the result of the ﬁrst part of this proof.
⊓⊔
The Mitchell Order
Deﬁnition 19.31. Let κ be a measurable cardinal. If U1 and U2 are normal
measures on κ, let
U1 < U2
if and only if
U1 ∈UltU2(V ).

358
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
The relation U1 < U2 is called the Mitchell order.
The Mitchell order is transitive, and by Lemma 17.9(ii) is irreﬂexive.
Moreover, it is well-founded:
Lemma 19.32. The Mitchell order is well-founded.
Proof. Toward a contradiction, let κ be the least measurable cardinal on
which the Mitchell order is not well-founded, and let U0 > U1 > . . . > Un >
. . . be a descending sequence of normal measures on κ. Let M = UltU0(V )
and let j : V →M be the canonical elementary embedding. As κ < j(κ),
and j(κ) is the least measurable cardinal in M on which the Mitchell order
is not well-founded, we reach a contradiction once we show that U1 > U2 >
. . . > Un > . . . is a descending sequence in M.
The measures Un, n ≥1, are in M, and so is the sequence {Un}∞
n=1, so
we need to verify that Un+1 < Un still holds in M. Since Un+1 ∈UltUn(V ),
Un+1 is represented in the ultrapower by a function f = ⟨uα : α < κ⟩. As
P M(κ) = P(κ) and M κ ⊂M, the function f is in M, and represents Un+1
in the ultrapower UltM
Un(M). Hence M ⊨Un+1 < Un.
⊓⊔
Deﬁnition 19.33. If U is a normal measure on κ, let o(U), the order of U,
denote the rank of U in <. Let o(κ), the order of κ, denote the height of <.
Lemma 19.34. Let o be the function ⟨o(α) : α < κ⟩. If U is a normal
measure on κ then o(U) = [o]U.
Proof. Clearly, [o]U = oM(κ) where M = UltU(V ). The set {U ′ : U ′ < U}
is the set of all normal measures in M, and since < is absolute for M (see
Lemma 19.32), the order of U in V is the order of κ in M.
⊓⊔
Thus o(U) > 0 if and only if U-almost all α < κ are measurable. If
κ is a measurable cardinal of order ≥2 then κ has a normal measure that
concentrates on measurable cardinals α < κ. Thus the consistency strength
of o(κ) ≥2 is more than measurability. Measurable cardinals of higher order
provide a hierarchy of large cardinal axioms. A consequence of Lemma 19.34
is that |o(U)| ≤2κ and therefore o(κ) ≤(2κ)+. In particular, if GCH holds,
then o(κ) ≤κ++ for every measurable cardinal κ.
There exist canonical inner models for measurable cardinals of higher
order, analogous to the model L[U]. We shall now outline the theory of these
inner models.
The key technical device is the technique of coiteration. It is the method
used in the proof of Lemma 19.35 below. Let U be a set of normal measures
(on possibly diﬀerent cardinals). U is closed if for every measure U ∈U
on κ, every normal measure on κ in jU(U) is in U. If U is a closed set of
normal measures and U, W ∈U, let U <U W mean that U ∈jW (U). As
<U is a suborder of the Mitchell order it is well-founded and we deﬁne oU(U)

19. Iterated Ultrapowers and L[U]
359
and oU(κ) accordingly. The length of U, l(U), is the least ϑ such that κ < ϑ
for all κ with oU(κ) > 0.
Let M and N be inner models of ZFC, and let U ∈M and W ∈N be
closed sets of normal measures in M and N, respectively. We say that U is
an initial segment of W if
(i) l(U) ≤l(W),
(ii) for every α < l(U), oU(α) = oW(α),
(iii) for every κ < l(U), if U ∈M and W ∈N are on κ and
oU(U) = oW(W), then U ∩M ∩N = W ∩M ∩N.
(19.20)
Lemma 19.35. Let M and N be inner models of ZFC and let U and W be
closed sets of measures in M and N, respectively. Then there exist iterated
ultrapowers i0,λ : M →Mλ and j0,λ : N →Nλ, using measures in U and W,
respectively, such that either i0,λ(U) is an initial segment of j0,λ(W), or vice
versa.
Proof. By induction on γ, we deﬁne iterated ultrapowers Mγ and Nγ, and
the embeddings iβ,γ : Mβ →Mγ and jβ,γ : Nβ →Nγ. We let M0 = M
and N0 = N, and if λ is a limit ordinal, Mλ and Nλ are direct limits of
{Mγ, iβ,γ : β, γ < λ} and {Nγ, jβ,γ : β, γ < λ}, respectively.
If at stage γ, Uγ = i0,γ(U) and Wγ = j0,γ(W) are not initial segments
of one another, then there exist ordinals αγ and δγ such that αγ < l(Uγ),
αγ < Wγ, Uγ↾αγ and Wγ↾αγ agree on Mγ ∩Nγ, the measures on αγ of
order < δγ in Uγ and in Wγ agree on Mγ ∩Nγ, and
either (i) δγ = oUγ(α) < oWγ(α), or
(ii) δγ = oWγ(αγ) < oUγ(αγ), or
(iii) δγ < oWγ(αγ), δγ < oUγ(αγ) and for some Uγ ∈Uγ and Wγ ∈
Wγ of order δγ there exists an Xγ ∈Mγ∩Nγ such that Xγ ∈Uγ
but Xγ /∈Wγ.
(19.21)
If (i) occurs, let iγ,γ+1 be the identity and jγ,γ+1 : Nγ →Nγ+1 = UltW (Nγ)
where W is any W ∈Wγ such that oWγ(W) = δγ. Similarly, if (ii) occurs,
then jγ,γ+1 is the identity and Mγ+1 is an ultrapower. If (iii) occurs, let
iγ,γ+1 : Mγ →Mγ+1 = UltUγ(Mγ) and jγ,γ+1 : Nγ →Nγ+1 = UltWγ(Nγ).
Note that if β < γ then αβ ≤αγ. Moreover, in cases (i) and (ii) we have
αγ+1 > αγ as oUγ+1(αγ) = oWγ+1(αγ) = δγ, and the measures of order < δγ
agree.
We will show that the process eventually stops. Thus assume the contrary.
For every limit ordinal γ, Mγ is a direct limit, and so there exists some
β = β(γ) < γ such that αγ is in the range of iβ,γ, αγ = iβ,γ(α) for some
α = α(γ) < l(Uβ). There is a stationary class Γ1 of ordinals such that β(γ) is
the same β for all γ ∈Γ1. Also, there is a stationary class Γ2 ⊂Γ1 such
that α(γ) is the same α < l(Uβ) for all γ ∈Γ2. It follows that if β < γ are
in Γ2 then iβ,γ(αβ) = αγ. Similarly there is a stationary class Γ3 ⊂Γ2 such

360
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
that jβ,γ(αβ) = αγ whenever β < γ are in Γ3. Continuing in this manner,
we ﬁnd a stationary class Γ ⊂Γ3 such that for all β < γ in Γ, iβ,γ(αβ, δβ) =
jβ,γ(αβ, δβ) = (αγ, δγ), and (in Case (iii)) iβ,γ(Xβ) = jβ,γ(Xβ).
Let β ∈Γ and assume that (19.21)(i) occurs. Let γ ∈Γ be greater than β.
Since iβ,β+1 is the identity, and crit(Uξ) = αξ ≥αβ+1 > αβ for all ξ > β,
we have iβ,γ(αβ) = αβ, while jβ,γ(αβ) ≥jβ,β+1(αβ) > αβ, contrary to
iβ,γ(αβ) = jβ,γ(αβ). Thus (i) does not occur, and similarly, (ii) leads to
a contradiction.
Case (iii) gives a contradiction as follows: Let γ > β be in Γ. Since Xβ ∈
Uβ, we have αβ ∈iβ,γ(Xβ), and since Xβ /∈Wβ, we have αβ /∈jβ,γ(Xβ). This
contradicts iβ,γ(Xβ) = jβ,γ(Xβ), and therefore the process must eventually
stop.
⊓⊔
The Models L[U]
If Aα, α < θ, is a sequence of sets, let us deﬁne the model
(19.22)
L⟨Aα : α < θ⟩
as the model L[A] where A = {(α, X) : X ∈Aα}. Under this deﬁnition,
L⟨Aα : α < θ⟩= L[⟨Bα : α < θ⟩], where Bα = Aα ∩L⟨Aα : α < θ⟩for all
α < θ.
If κα, α < θ, is a sequence of measurable cardinals, and for each α, Uα is
a κα-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on κα, then in L⟨Uα : α < θ⟩, each
Uα ∩L⟨Uα : α < θ⟩is again a κα-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on κα.
More generally, let U be a set of normal measures indexed by pairs of
ordinals (α, β) such that Uα,β is a measure on α. Then L[U] denotes the
model L⟨Uα,β : α, β⟩.
The technique described in the preceding section can be used to gener-
alize many results about the model L[U] to obtain canonical inner models
for measurable cardinals of higher order. We shall illustrate the method by
constructing a model with exactly two normal measures on a measurable
cardinal of order 2.
Deﬁnition 19.36. A canonical inner model for a measurable cardinal κ of
order 2 is a model
(19.23)
L[U] = L⟨Uα, U 0, U 1⟩α∈A
such that in L[U]
(i) U 1 is a normal measure on κ of order 1.
(ii) U 0 is a normal measure on κ of order 0 and U 0 < U 1.
(iii) A ∈U 1, each Uα is a normal measure on α of order 0, and
⟨Uα : α ∈A⟩represents U 0 in the ultrapower by U 1.
(19.24)

19. Iterated Ultrapowers and L[U]
361
If o(κ) ≥2 then a canonical model L[U] is obtained as follows: Let A ⊂κ
be the set of all measurable cardinals below κ, let U 1 be a normal measure
on κ of order 1, let U 0 be a normal measure on κ such that U 0 < U 1,
and let Uα, α ∈A, be normal measures such that [⟨Uα : α ∈A⟩]U1 = U 0.
Then L⟨Uα, U 0, U 1⟩α∈A is a canonical inner model (with U = ⟨Uα ∩L[U],
U 0 ∩L[U], U 1 ∩L[U]⟩α∈A).
The canonical model is unique (for the particular choice of the set A), in
the sense that if W = ⟨Wα, W 0, W 1⟩α∈A is any other sequence that satis-
ﬁes (19.24), then L[U] = L[W]. We prove below a more general result.
Theorem 19.37 (Mitchell). Let A ⊂κ, and let U = ⟨Uα, U 0, U 1⟩α∈A and
W = ⟨Wα, W 0, W 1⟩α∈A be such that for each α ∈A, Uα and Wα are normal
measures on α of order 0, U 0 and W 0 are normal measures on κ of order 0,
and U 1 and W 1 are normal measures on κ of order 1. Then L[U] = L[W]
and
(i) Uα ∩L[U] = Wα ∩L[W]
(all α ∈A),
(ii) U ε ∩L[U] = W ε ∩L[W]
(ε = 0, 1).
(19.25)
Proof. We use Lemma 19.35. Let D be the following set of measures:
The Uα’s, the Wα’s, U 1, U 0, W 1, W 0, and all the normal measures on κ
in jU1(U ∪W) and jW 1(U ∪W) (so that D is a closed set of measures).
By Lemma 19.35 (applied to D) there exist iterated ultrapowers i = i0,λ :
V →M and j = j0,λ : V →N such that i(D) is an initial segment of j(D).
We have l(i(D)) = i(κ) + 1, and by (19.20), oi(D)(i(κ)) = oj(D)(j(κ)) = 2
and for all α < i(κ), oi(D)(α) = oj(D)(α) = 1 if α ∈i(A) and oi(D)(α) =
oj(D)(α) = 0 if α /∈i(A). It follows that i(κ) = j(κ) and i(A) = j(A).
By (19.20)(iii), if D ∈i(D) and E ∈j(D) are normal measures on some
α ∈i(A) then D∩M ∩N = E ∩M ∩N; the same is true if D ∈i(D) and E ∈
j(D) are measures on i(κ) and oi(D)(D) = oi(D)(E). It follows that L[i(U)] =
L[j(U)] = L[j(W)] = L[i(W)] ⊂M ∩N, i(U ε) ∩L[i(U)] = j(U ε) ∩L[i(U)] =
j(W ε) ∩L[i(U)] = i(W ε) ∩L[i(U)] (ε = 0, 1), and for every α ∈i(A),
(iU)α = (iW)α, where ⟨(iU)α, iU 0, iU 1⟩α∈iA = iU = i(⟨Uα, U 0, U 1⟩α∈A).
(By induction on γ, one shows that Lγ[i(U)] = Lγ[i(W)]).
Now (19.25) follows since i is an elementary embedding, and i : L[U] →
L[i(U)], i : L[W] →L[i(W)].
⊓⊔
The analog of Theorem 19.14(i) for L[U] is the following:
Theorem 19.38 (Mitchell). In L[U], κ and α ∈A are the only measurable
cardinals, and Uα, U 0 and U 1 are the only normal measures.
Proof. For every ordinal γ ≤κ, let U↾γ = ⟨Uα : α ∈A∩γ⟩; if γ > κ, U↾γ = U.
Toward a contradiction, let γ be the least ordinal such that in L[U↾γ] there
are normal measures other than those in U↾γ, and let D = U↾γ. Let α be the
least cardinal in L[D] that carries a normal measure not in D, and let D be
such a measure of least Mitchell order.

If α /∈A ∪{κ}, let M = L[D], N = UltD(L[D]) = L[jD(D)], and apply
Lemma 19.35 to M, N and (closed) sets of measures D and jD(D). There
are iterated ultrapowers i = i0,λ : M →Mλ and j = j0,λ : N →Nλ such
that i(D) is an initial segment of j(jD(D)) or vice versa. Now because of
the choice of D as a minimal counterexample in L[D] to the theorem, no
proper initial segment of either i(D) or j(jD(D)) can be a counterexample,
and consequently, Mλ = Nλ = L[i(D)] = L[j(jD(D))]. As jD(D)↾(α + 1) =
D↾(α + 1), we have i(α) = j(α) = α, which contradicts the fact that D ∈M
but D /∈N.
The same argument works if α ∈A and Uα < D, or if α = κ and U 1 < D.
If α ∈A and o(D) = 0, let U = Uα; if α = κ and o(D) = ε (ε = 0, 1), let
U = U ε. Let M = UltU(L[D]) = L[jU(D)] and N = UltD(L[D]) = L[jD(D)].
By Lemma 19.35 there are iterated ultrapowers i : M →Mλ and j : N →Nλ
such that i(jU(D)) is an initial segment of j(jD(D)) or vice versa. Using
the minimality argument again, we get Mλ = Nλ = L[i(jU(D))] = L(E)
where E = i(jU(D)) = j(jD(D)). Again, jU(D)↾(α + 1) = jD(D)↾(α + 1), so
i(α) = j(α) = α.
To reach a contradiction we show that X ∈U if and only if X ∈D,
for every X ⊂α in L[D]. We proceed as in the proof of Lemma 19.18. If
X ∈P L[D](α) then X is deﬁnable in L[D] from D and ordinals that are not
moved by jU, jD, i or j. As in (19.8)–(19.10) it follows that X = Z ∩α where
Z = i(X), that Z = j(Z ∩α) = j(X) and that X ∈U if and only if α ∈i(X)
if and only if α ∈j(X) if and only if X ∈D.
⊓⊔
Theorems 19.37 and 19.38 admit a generalization to yield canonical inner
models for measurable cardinals of higher order. We shall state the following
result without proof:
Theorem 19.39 (Mitchell). There exists an inner model L[U] such that
(i) for every α, oL[U](α) = oU(α) = min{o(α), (α++)L[U]};
(ii) U = ⟨Uα,β : β < oU(α)⟩;
(iii) each Uα,β is in L[U] a normal measure of order β;
(iv) every normal measure in L[U] is Uα,β for some α and β;
(v) L[U] ⊨GCH.

(Hence U does not extend the closed unbounded ﬁlter.)
[U satisﬁes (19.15) for some δ; if δ = κ(n) for some n, then U = D. Let n be
such that κ(n−1) < δ < κ(n); let g : κn →κ represents δ in UltDn. Let f(ξ) =
least α such that g(α1, . . . , αn−1, α) ≥ξ for some α1 < . . . < αn−1 < α. The
function f is monotone. To show that [f]U < [d]U, we argue as follows: For almost
all (mod Dn) α1, . . . , αn, g(α1, . . . , αn) > αn; hence for almost all α1, . . . , αn,
f(g(α1, . . . , αn)) < g(α1, . . . , αn). Hence (jDn(f))(δ) < δ, and hence for almost
all ξ (mod U), f(ξ) < ξ. Thus [f]U < [d]U.]

Historical Notes
Most of the results in the ﬁrst part of Chapter 19 are due to Kunen, who
in [1970] developed the method of iterated ultraproducts invented by Gaifman
(cf. [1964] and [1974]). Kunen found the representation of iterated ultraproducts
(Lemma 19.13) and generalized the construction for M-ultraﬁlters. Kunen applied
the method to obtain the main results of the model L[D] (Theorem 19.14).
Theorem 19.3 (the proof of the GCH in L[D]) is due to Silver [1971d].
The description of κ-complete ultraﬁlters on κ in L[D] (Lemma 19.21) is due
to Kunen [1970] and Paris [1969]. Lemma 19.4 was ﬁrst proved by Solovay. The-
orem 19.7 is due to Gaifman; cf. [1974]. The proof of well-foundedness in Exer-
cise 19.10 is due to Kunen. Lemmas 19.20 and 19.24 are results of Kunen [1970].
0† was formulated by Solovay.
Kunen generalized the basic results on L[D] to the model L⟨Dα : α < θ⟩
constructed from a sequence of measures (with θ < the least measurable cardinal
in the sequence). Mitchell [1974] and [1983] generalized the theory of L[D] to inner
models for sequences of measures. The deﬁnition of o(κ), Theorem 19.30 (well-
foundedness of iterated ultrapowers) as well as the results on L[U] are all due to
Mitchell.
The results in Exercises 19.9, 19.10 and 19.11 are due to Kunen [1970].

20. Very Large Cardinals
This chapter studies properties of large cardinals that generalize measurabil-
ity. We are particularly interested in the method of elementary embeddings,
and introduce two concepts that have become crucial in the theory of large
cardinals: supercompact and Woodin cardinals.
Strongly Compact Cardinals
In Chapter 9 we proved that weakly compact cardinals are inaccessible car-
dinals satisfying the Weak Compactness Theorem for the inﬁnitary lan-
guage Lκ,ω. If we remove the restriction on the size of sets of sentences in
the model theoretic characterization of weakly compact cardinals, we obtain
a considerably stronger notion. This notion, strong compactness, turns out to
be much stronger than measurability.
Strongly compact cardinals can be characterized in several diﬀerent ways.
Let us use, as a deﬁnition, the property that is a natural generalization of
the Ultraﬁlter Theorem:
Deﬁnition 20.1. An uncountable regular cardinal κ is strongly compact if
for any set S, every κ-complete ﬁlter on S can be extended to a κ-complete
ultraﬁlter on S.
Obviously, every strongly compact cardinal κ is measurable, for any ul-
traﬁlter on κ that extends the ﬁlter {X : |κ −X| < κ} is nonprincipal.
Let us say that the language Lκ,ω (or Lκ,κ) satisﬁes the Compactness
Theorem if whenever Σ is a set of sentences of Lκ,ω (Lκ,κ) such that every
S ⊂Σ with |S| < κ has a model, then Σ has a model.
Let A be a set of cardinality greater than or equal to κ. For each x ∈
Pκ(A), let ˆx = {y ∈Pκ(A) : x ⊂y}, and let us consider the ﬁlter on Pκ(A)
generated by the sets ˆx for all x ∈Pκ(A); that is, the ﬁlter
(20.1)
{X ⊂Pκ(A) : X ⊃ˆx for some x ∈Pκ(A)}.
If κ is a regular cardinal, then the ﬁlter (20.1) is κ-complete. We call U a ﬁne
measure on Pκ(A) if U is a κ-complete ultraﬁlter on Pκ(A) that extends the
ﬁlter (20.1); i.e., ˆx ∈U for all x ∈Pκ(A).

366
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Lemma 20.2. The following are equivalent, for any regular cardinal κ:
(i) For any set S, every κ-complete ﬁlter on S can be extended to a κ-
complete ultraﬁlter on S.
(ii) For any A such that |A| ≥κ, there exists a ﬁne measure on Pκ(A).
(iii) The language Lκ,ω satisﬁes the compactness theorem.
Proof. (i) →(ii) is clear.
(ii) →(iii): Let Σ be a set of sentences of Lκ,ω and assume that every
S ⊂Σ of size less than κ has a model, say AS. Let U be a ﬁne measure
on Pκ(Σ), and let us consider the ultraproduct A = UltU{AS : S ∈Pκ(Σ)}.
It is routine to verify that Lo´s’s Theorem holds for the language Lκ,ω provided
the ultraﬁlter is κ-complete; in order to prove the induction step for inﬁnitary
connective 
ξ<α ϕξ, one uses the κ-completeness of U. Thus we have, for any
sentence σ of Lκ,ω,
(20.2)
A ⊨σ
if and only if
{S : AS ⊨σ} ∈U.
Now if σ ∈Σ, then {σ}∧∈U and since AS ⊨σ whenever S ∋σ, (20.2) implies
that σ holds in A. Hence A is a model of Σ.
(iii) →(i): Let S be a set and let F be a κ-complete ﬁlter on S. Let us
consider the Lκ,ω-language which has a unary predicate symbol ˙X for each
X ⊂S, and a constant symbol c. Let Σ be the set of Lκ,ω sentences consisting
of:
(a) all sentences true in (S, X)X⊂S,
(b)
˙X(c) for all X ∈F.
Every set of less than κ sentences in Σ has a model: Take S as the universe,
interpret each ˙X as X and let c be some element of S that lies in every X
whose name is mentioned in the given set of sentences; since F is κ-complete,
such c exists.
Hence Σ has a model A = (A, XA, c)X⊂S. Let us deﬁne U ⊂P(S) as
follows:
X ∈U
if and only if
A ⊨˙X(c).
It is easy to verify that U is a κ-complete ultraﬁlter and that U ⊃F:
For instance, U is κ-complete because if α < κ and X = 
ξ<α Xξ, then
A satisﬁes the sentence 
ξ<α ˙Xξ(c) →˙X(c).
⊓⊔
Every strongly compact cardinal is measurable, but not every measurable
cardinal is strongly compact (although it is consistent that there is exactly one
measurable cardinal which is also strongly compact). We shall show that the
existence of strongly compact cardinals is a much stronger assumption than
the existence of measurable cardinals. We start with the following theorem:
Theorem 20.3 (Vopˇenka-Hrb´aˇcek). If there exists a strongly compact
cardinal, then there is no set A such that V = L[A].

20. Very Large Cardinals
367
Proof. Let us assume that V = L[A] for some set A. Since there is a set of
ordinals A′ such that L[A] = L[A′], we may assume that A is a set of ordinals.
Let κ be a strongly compact cardinal, and let λ ≥κ be a cardinal such that
A ⊂λ. There exists a κ-complete ultraﬁlter U on λ+ such that |X| = λ+ for
every X ∈U (let U extend the ﬁlter {X : |λ+ −X| ≤λ}).
Since U is κ-complete, the ultrapower UltU(V ) is well-founded, and thus
can be identiﬁed with a transitive model M. As usual, if f is a function
on λ+, then [f] denotes the element of M represented by f. Let j = jU be
the elementary embedding of V into M given by U.
Let us now consider another version of ultrapower. Let us consider only
those functions on λ+ that assume at most λ values. For these functions, we
still deﬁne f =∗g (mod U) and f ∈∗g (mod U) in the usual way, and there-
fore obtain a model of the language of set theory, which we denote Ult−
U(V ).
Lo´s’s Theorem holds for this version of ultrapower too: If f, . . . are functions
on λ+ with | ran(f)| ≤λ, then
(20.3)
Ult−⊨ϕ(f, . . .)
if and only if
{α : ϕ(f(α), . . .)} ∈U.
(Check the induction step for ∃.) Hence Ult−is a model of ZFC, elementarily
equivalent to V . Also, since U is κ-complete, Ult−is well-founded and thus
is isomorphic to a transitive model N. Every element of N is represented by
a function f on λ+ such that | ran(f)| ≤λ. We denote [f]−the element of N
represented by f. We also deﬁne an elementary embedding i : V →N by
i(x) = [cx]−where cx is the constant function on λ+ with value x.
For every function f on λ+ with | ran f| ≤λ, we let
(20.4)
k([f]−) = [f].
It is easy to see that the deﬁnition of k([f]−) does not depend on the choice
of f representing [f]−in N, and that k is an elementary embedding of N
into M. In fact, j = k ◦i.
If γ < λ+, then every function from λ+ into γ has at most λ values, and
hence [f]−= [f] for all f : λ+ →γ. If f : λ+ →λ+ has at most λ values,
then f : λ+ →γ for some γ < λ+; it follows that i(λ+) = limγ→λ+ i(γ), and
we have k(ξ) = ξ for all ξ < i(λ+).
Similarly, i(A) = j(A), and we have M = L[j(A)] = L[i(A)] = N.
Now we reach a contradiction by observing that j(λ+) > i(λ+): Since
the diagonal function d(α) = α represents in M an ordinal greater than
each j(γ), γ < λ+, we have j(λ+) > limγ→λ+ j(γ). While N thinks that
i(λ+) is the successor of i(λ), M thinks that j(λ+) is the successor of j(λ)
(and j(λ) = i(λ)). Thus M ̸= N, a contradiction.
⊓⊔
The following theorem shows that the consistency strength of strong com-
pactness exceeds the strength of measurability:
Theorem 20.4 (Kunen). If there exists a strongly compact cardinal then
there exists an inner model with two measurable cardinals.

368
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Kunen proved a stronger version (and the proof can be so modiﬁed): For
every ordinal ϑ there exists an inner model with ϑ measurable cardinals.
This was improved by Mitchell who showed that the existence of a strongly
compact cardinal leads to an inner model that has a measurable cardinal κ
of Mitchell order κ++.
We begin with a combinatorial lemma:
Lemma 20.5. Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal. There exists a family G of
functions g : κ →κ such that |G| = 2κ, and whenever H ⊂G is a subfamily
of size < κ and {βg : g ∈H} is any collection of ordinals < κ, then there
exists an α such that g(α) = βg for all g ∈H.
Proof. Let A be a family of almost disjoint subsets of κ (i.e., |A| = κ for each
A ∈A and |A ∩B| < κ for any distinct A, B ∈A), such that |A| = 2κ. For
each A ∈A, let fA be a mapping of A onto κ such that for each β < κ, the
set {a ∈A : fA(a) = β} has size κ. Let sα, α < κ, enumerate all subsets
s ⊂κ of size < κ.
For each A ∈A, let gA : κ →κ be deﬁned as follows: If sα ∩A = {x},
then gA(α) = fA(x); gA(α) = 0 otherwise. Let G = {gA : A ∈A}.
If A ̸= B ∈A, then it is easy to ﬁnd sα such that gA(α) ̸= 0 and
gB(α) = 0; hence |G| = 2κ. If H ⊂A has size < κ and if {βA : A ∈H} are
given, then for each A ∈H we choose xA ∈A such that xA /∈B for any other
B ∈H and that fA(xA) = βA. Then if α is such that sα = {xA : A ∈A}, we
have gA(α) = βA for every A ∈H.
⊓⊔
Lemma 20.6. Let κ be a strongly compact cardinal. For every δ < (2κ)+
there exists a κ-complete ultraﬁlter U on κ such that jU(κ) > δ.
Proof. Let δ < (2κ)+. Let G be a family of functions g : κ →κ of size |δ|
with the property stated in Lemma 20.5; let us enumerate G = {gα : α ≤δ}.
For any α < β ≤δ, let Xα,β = {ξ : gα(ξ) < gβ(ξ)}. Using the property
of G from Lemma 20.5, we can see that any collection of less than κ of
the Xα,β has a nonempty intersection and hence F = {X : X ⊃Xα,β for
some α < β ≤δ} is a κ-complete ﬁlter on κ. There exists a κ-complete
ultraﬁlter U extending F. It is clear that if α < β ≤δ, then gα < gβ mod U,
and hence jU(κ) > δ.
⊓⊔
Combining Lemma 20.6 with Lemmas 19.23 and 19.24, we already have
a strong consequence of strong compactness.
We shall apply the technique of iterated ultrapowers to construct an inner
model with two measurable cardinals.
Let D be a normal measure on κ, and let i0,α denote, for each α, the
elementary embedding i0,α : V →Ult(α); let κ(α) = i0,α(κ) and D(α) =
i0,α(D).
First recall (19.5): If λ is a limit ordinal, then X ∈Ult(λ) belongs to D(λ)
if and only if X ⊃{κ(γ) : α ≤γ < λ} for some α < λ. Let
(20.5)
C = {ν : ν is a strong limit cardinal, ν > 2κ, and cf ν > κ}.

20. Very Large Cardinals
369
By Lemma 19.15, if ν ∈C then κ(ν) = ν, and i0,α(ν) = ν for all α < ν. Thus
if γ0 < γ1 < . . . < γn < . . . are elements of the class C, and if λ = limn→∞γn,
then κ(λ) = λ, and X ∈Ult(λ) belongs to D(λ) just in case X ⊃{γn : n0 ≤n}
for some n0.
If A is a set of ordinals of order-type ω, A = {γn : n ∈ω}, we deﬁne
a ﬁlter F(A) on λ = sup A as follows:
(20.6)
X ∈F(A)
if and only if
∃n0 (∀n ≥n0) γn ∈X.
The above discussion leads us to this: If A ⊂C has order-type ω, and if
λ = sup A, then for every X ∈Ult(λ), X ∈D(λ) if and only if X ∈F(A). In
other words,
(20.7)
D(λ) = F(A) ∩Ult(λ).
Hence F(A) ∩Ult(λ) ∈Ult(λ); and so, L[F(A)] = L[D(λ)]. Thus F(A) ∩
L[F(A)] = D(λ) ∩L[D(λ)], and we have
(20.8)
L[F(A)] ⊨F(A) ∩L[F(A)] is a normal measure on λ.
The only assumption needed to derive (20.8) is that κ is measurable and
A is a subset of the class C. We shall now use Lemma 20.6 and a similar
construction to obtain a model with two measurable cardinals.
Suppose that A = {γn : n ∈ω} is as above, and that A′ = {γ′
n : n ∈ω}
is another subset of C of order-type ω, such that γ′
0 > λ = sup A; let λ′ =
sup A′. Let F = F(A) and F ′ = F(A′). Our intention is to choose A and A′
such that the model L[F, F ′] has two measurable cardinals, namely λ and λ′,
and that F ∩L[F, F ′] and F ′ ∩L[F, F ′] are normal measures on λ and λ′,
respectively.
The argument leading to (20.8) can again be used to show that F ∩L[F, F ′]
is a normal measure on λ in L[F, F ′]. This is because we have again
D(λ) = F ∩Ult(λ);
moreover, i0,λ(γ′
n) = γ′
n for each n, and hence i0,λ(A′) = A′ and we have
(20.9)
i0,λ(F ′) = F ′ ∩Ult(λ).
Therefore
L[F, F ′] = L[D(λ), F ′] = L[D(λ), i0,λ(F ′)]
and
(20.10)
F ∩L[F, F ′] = D(λ) ∩L[D(λ), i0,λ(F ′)],
which gives
(20.11)
L[F, F ′] ⊨F ∩L[F, F ′] is a normal measure on λ.
In order to ﬁnd A, A′ so that F ′ also gives a normal measure in L[F, F ′], let
us make the following observation: Let us think for a moment that A ⊂κ and

370
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
A′ ⊂C. Then i0,λ′(A) = A and D(λ′) = F ′ ∩Ult(λ′), and the same argument
as above shows that
(20.12)
L[F, F ′] ⊨F ′ ∩L[F, F ′] is a normal measure on λ′.
We shall use this observation below.
Let us deﬁne the following classes of cardinals (compare with (18.29)):
(20.13)
C0 = C,
Cα+1 = {ν ∈Cα : |Cα ∩ν| = ν},
Cγ = 
α<γ
Cα
(γ limit).
Each Cα is nonempty; in fact each Cα is unbounded and δ-closed for all δ of
coﬁnality > κ.
Now we let
(20.14)
γn = the least element of Cn,
A = {γn : n ∈ω},
λ = limn→∞γn
and let A′ = {γ′
n : n ∈ω} be a subset of Cω+1.
Let us consider the model L[A, A′], and let for each n ≤ω
(20.15)
Mn = the Skolem hull of Cn in L[A, A′]
= the class of all x ∈L[A, A′] such that
L[A, A′] ⊨x = t[ν1, . . . , νk, γ0, . . . , γk, γ′
0, . . . , γ′
k, A, A′]
where t is a Skolem term and ν1, . . . , νk ∈Cn.
(Let us not worry about the problem whether (20.15) is expressible in the
language of set theory; it can be shown that it is, similarly as in the case
of ordinal deﬁnable sets. Alternatively, we can consider the model Lθ[A, A′]
where θ is some large enough cardinal in Cω+1.)
Each Mn is an elementary submodel of L[A, A′]; let πn be the transi-
tive collapse of Mn; then πn(Mn) = L[πn(A), πn(A′)] and jn = π−1
n
is an
elementary embedding
jn : L[πn(A), πn(A′)] →L[A, A′].
Lemma 20.7. For each n < ω, πn(γn) < (2κ)+.
Proof. By induction on n. First let n = 0. Let α < γ0 be in M0. Then
α = t(ν1, . . . , νk, A, A′) for some Skolem term t and some ν1, . . . , νk ∈C0.
Let i0,α be the elementary embedding into Ult(α)
U
for some U on κ. Since γ0 is
the least element of C0, we have α < ν for all ν ∈C0 and hence i0,α(ν) = ν
for all ν ∈C0. Hence also i0,α(A) = A and i0,α(A′) = A′ and it follows that
i0,α(α) = α. Now i0,α(α) = α is possible only if α < κ. Hence each α < γ0
in M0 is less than κ and therefore π0(γ0) ≤κ.

Now let us assume that πn(γn) < (2κ)+ and let us show that πn+1(γn+1) <
(2κ)+. By Lemma 20.6 there exists a U such that jU(κ) > πn(γn). We shall
show that πn(α) < jU(κ) for all α < γn+1 in Mn+1; since πn+1(α) ≤πn(α)
it follows that πn+1(γn+1) = sup{πn+1(α) : α < γn+1 and α ∈Mn+1} ≤
jU(κ) < (2κ)+.
First notice that it follows from the deﬁnition of Cn+1 in (20.13) that
πn(ν) = ν for all ν ∈Cn+1. Note also that γm ∈Cn+1 for all m ≥n + 1, and
A′ ⊂Cn+1.
Let α < γn+1 be in Mn+1. Then (in L[A, A′]),
α = t(γ0, . . . , γn, ν1, . . . , νk, A, A′)
where t is some Skolem term and ν1, . . . , νk ∈Cn+1. Hence (in L[πn(A),
πn(A′)])
πn(α) = t(πn(γ0), . . . , πn(γn), ν1, . . . , νk, πn(A), A′).
Now we argue inside the model UltU(V ) (which contains both πn(A) and A′):
Consider the αth iterated ultrapower (modulo some measure on jU(κ)). Since
πn(γ0), . . . , πn(γn) are all less than jU(κ), we have i0,α(πn(γi)) = πn(γi) for
all i = 0, . . . , n. We also have i0,α(ν) = ν for each ν ∈Cn+1 (because α < ν
for each ν ∈Cn+1 and Cn+1 ⊂C). It follows that i0,α(πn(α)) = πn(α). Now
(because πn(α) ≤α) this is only possible if πn(α) < jU(κ).
⊓⊔
We can now complete the proof of Theorem 20.4. Let us consider the
model Mω, the Skolem hull in L[A, A′] of Cω. Let πω be the transitive collapse
of Mω and B = πω(A). Since A′ ⊂Cω+1, we have πω(A′) = A′, and jω = π−1
ω
is an elementary embedding
jω : L[B, A′] →L[A, A′].
By Lemma 20.7, πω(γn) ≤πn(γn) < (2κ)+ for all n, and hence πω(λ) <
(2κ)+. Let U be a κ-complete ultraﬁlter on κ such that jU(κ) > πω(λ).
In UltU, B is a subset of jU(κ) and A′ is a subset of the class C. Thus we
can apply (20.12) and get
UltU ⊨(L[F(B), F(A′)] ⊨F(A′) ∩L[F(B), F(A′)] is
a normal measure on λ′).
Hence
L[B, A′] ⊨(L[F(B), F(A′)] ⊨F(A′) ∩L[F(B), F(A′)] is
a normal measure on λ′),
and applying jω, we get
L[A, A′] ⊨(L[F(A), F(A′)] ⊨F(A′) ∩L[F(A), F(A′)] is
a normal measure on λ′).
Therefore F ′∩L[F, F ′] is (in L[F, F ′]) a normal measure on λ′. This completes
the proof of Theorem 20.4.

The following theorem provides further evidence of the eﬀect of large
cardinals on cardinal arithmetic.
Theorem 20.8 (Solovay). If κ is a strongly compact cardinal, then the
Singular Cardinal Hypothesis holds above κ. That is, if λ > κ is a singu-
lar cardinal, then 2cf λ < λ implies λcf λ = λ+. (Consequently, if λ > κ is
a singular strong limit cardinal, then 2λ = λ+.)
We shall prove the theorem in a sequence of lemmas. An ultraﬁlter on λ
is uniform if every set in the ultraﬁlter has size λ.
Lemma 20.9. If κ is a strongly compact cardinal and λ > κ is a regular
cardinal, then there exists a κ-complete uniform ultraﬁlter D on λ with the
property that almost all (mod D) ordinals α < λ have coﬁnality less than κ.
Proof. Let U be a ﬁne measure on Pκ(λ). Since U is ﬁne, every α < λ belongs
to almost all (mod U) x ∈Pκ(λ). Let us consider the ultrapower UltU(V )
and let f be the least ordinal function in UltU greater than all the constant
functions cγ, γ < λ:
(20.16)
[f] = limγ→λ jU(γ).
We note ﬁrst that f(x) < λ for almost all x: Let g : Pκ(λ) →λ be the
function g(x) = sup x. If γ < λ, then γ ≤g(x) for almost all x and hence
j(γ) ≤[g]; thus [f] ≤[g] ≤j(λ).
Let D be the ultraﬁlter on λ deﬁned as follows:
(20.17)
X ∈D
if and only if
f−1(X) ∈U
(X ⊂λ).
It is clear that D is κ-complete, and since f is greater than the constant
function, D is nonprincipal. For the same reason, the diagonal function d(α) =
α is greater (in UltD) than all the constant functions cγ, γ < λ, and since λ is
regular, D is uniform. In order to show that almost all (mod D) α < λ have
coﬁnality < κ, it suﬃces by (20.17), to show that cf(f(x)) < κ for almost
all x (mod U).
That will follow immediately once we show that for almost all x (mod U),
(20.18)
f(x) = sup{α ∈x : α < f(x)}.
We clearly have ≥in (20.18). To prove ≤, consider the function h(x) =
sup{α ∈x : α < f(x)}. For each γ < λ, γ is in almost every x and hence γ ≤
h(x) almost everywhere. Thus [h] ≥jU(γ) for all γ < λ and so f(x) ≤h(x)
almost everywhere.
⊓⊔
Lemma 20.10. If κ is strongly compact and λ > κ is a regular cardinal,
then there exist a κ-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter D on λ and a collection
{Mα : α < λ} such that
(i) |Mα| < κ for all α < λ,
(ii) for every γ < λ, γ belongs to Mα for almost all α (mod D).
(20.19)

20. Very Large Cardinals
373
(An ultraﬁlter D that has a family {Mα : α < λ} with property (20.19)
is called (κ, λ)-regular.)
Proof. Let D be the ultraﬁlter on λ constructed in Lemma 20.9. It follows
from the construction of D that [d]D = limγ→λ jD(γ). For almost all α
(mod D), there exists an Aα ⊂α of size less than κ and coﬁnal in α. If
cf α ≥κ, let Aα = ∅. Let A be the set of ordinals represented in UltD(V ) by
the function ⟨Aα : α < λ⟩. The set A is coﬁnal in the ordinal represented by
the diagonal function d; and since [d] = limγ→λ jD(γ), it follows that for each
η < λ there is η′ > η such that A ∩{ξ : jD(η) ≤ξ < jD(η′)} is nonempty.
We construct a sequence ⟨ηγ : γ < λ⟩of ordinals < λ as follows: Let
η0 = 0 and ηγ = limδ→γ ηδ if γ is limit; let ηγ+1 be some ordinal such that
there exists ξ ∈A such that jD(ηγ) ≤ξ < jD(ηγ+1).
In other words, if we denote Iγ the interval {ξ : ηγ ≤ξ < ηγ+1}, then
for every γ, the interval Iγ has nonempty intersection with almost every Aα.
Thus if we let
Mα = {γ < λ : Iγ ∩Aα ̸= ∅}
for each α < λ, then {Mα : α < λ} has property (20.19)(ii). To see that
Mα has property (i) as well, notice that |Aα| < κ for all α and that since
the Iγ are mutually disjoint, each Aα intersects less than κ of them.
⊓⊔
Lemma 20.11. If κ is strongly compact and λ > κ is a regular cardinal,
then there exists a collection {Mα : α < λ} ⊂Pκ(λ) such that
(20.20)
Pκ(λ) = 
α<λ
P(Mα).
Consequently, λ<κ = λ.
Proof. Let {Mα : α < λ} be as in Lemma 20.10. If x is a subset of λ of
size less than κ, then by (20.19)(ii) and by κ-completeness of D, x ⊂Mα for
almost all α. Hence x ∈P(Mα) for some α < λ. This proves (20.20); since
κ is inaccessible, it follows that |Pκ(λ)| = λ.
⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 20.8. Let κ be a strongly compact cardinal. If λ > κ is an
arbitrary cardinal, then we have, by Lemma 20.11
λ<κ ≤(λ+)<κ = λ+.
In particular, we have λℵ0 ≤λ+ for every λ > κ. This implies that the
Singular Cardinal Hypothesis holds for every λ > κ.
⊓⊔
Supercompact Cardinals
We proved in Lemma 20.2 that a strongly compact cardinal κ is characterized
by the property that every Pκ(A) has a ﬁne measure. If we require the ﬁne

measure to satisfy a normality condition, then we obtain a stronger notion—
a supercompact cardinal. Ultrapowers by normal measures on Pκ(A) induce
elementary embeddings that can be used to derive strong consequences of su-
percompact cardinals. For instance, Theorems 20.3 and 20.4 become almost
trivial if the existence of a strongly compact cardinal is replaced by the exis-
tence of a supercompact cardinal. It is consistent to assume that a strongly
compact cardinal is not supercompact, or that every strongly compact car-
dinal is supercompact, but it is not known whether supercompact cardinals
are consistent relative to strongly compact cardinals.
Deﬁnition 20.12. A ﬁne measure U on Pκ(A) is normal if whenever f :
Pκ(A) →A is such that f(x) ∈x for almost all x, then f is constant on a set
in U. A cardinal κ is supercompact if for every A such that |A| ≥κ, there
exists a normal measure on Pκ(A).
Let λ ≥κ be a cardinal and let us consider the ultrapower UltU(V ) by
a normal measure U on Pκ(λ); let j = jU be the corresponding elementary
embedding. Clearly, a set X ⊂Pκ(λ) belongs to U if and only if [d] ∈j(X),
where d, the diagonal function, is the function d(x) = x.
Lemma 20.13. If U is a normal measure on Pκ(λ), then [d] = {j(γ) : γ <
λ} = j“λ, and hence for every X ⊂Pκ(λ),
(20.21)
X ∈U
if and only if
j“λ ∈j(X).
Proof. On the one hand, if γ < λ, then γ ∈x for almost all x and hence
j(γ) ∈[d]. On the other hand, if [f] ∈[d], then f(x) ∈x for almost all x and
by normality, there is γ < λ such that [f] = j(γ).
⊓⊔
It follows from (20.21) that if f and g are functions on Pκ(λ), then
[f] = [g]
if and only if
(jf)(j“λ) = (jg)(j“λ).
and
[f] ∈[g]
if and only if
(jf)(j“λ) ∈(jg)(j“λ).
Consequently,
(20.22)
[f] = (jf)(j“λ)
for every function f on Pκ(λ).
For each x ∈Pκ(λ), let us denote
(20.23)
κx = x ∩κ,
and
λx = the order-type of x.
Note that the order-type of j“λ is λ and hence by (20.22), λ is represented
in the ultrapower by the function x →λx. Also, since λx < κ for all x, we

20. Very Large Cardinals
375
have j(κ) > λ. By the κ-completeness of U, we have j(γ) = γ for all γ < κ;
and since κ is moved by j, it follows that j“λ ∩j(κ) = κ and therefore κ is
represented by the function x →κx.
This gives the following characterization of supercompact cardinals:
Lemma 20.14. Let λ ≥κ. A normal measure on Pκ(λ) exists if and only if
there exists an elementary embedding j : V →M such that
(i) j(γ) = γ for all γ < κ;
(ii) j(κ) > λ;
(iii) M λ ⊂M; i.e., every sequence ⟨aα : α < λ⟩of elements of M
is a member of M.
(20.24)
A cardinal κ is called λ-supercompact if it satisﬁes (20.24).
Proof. (a) Let U be a normal measure on Pκ(λ). We let M = UltU(V ) and
let j be the canonical elementary embedding j : V →Ult. We have already
proved (i) and (ii). To prove (iii), it suﬃces to show that whenever ⟨aα :
α < λ⟩is such that aα ∈M for all α < λ, then the set {aα : α < λ} belongs
to M. Let fα, α < λ, be functions representing elements of M: [fα] ∈M. We
consider the function f on Pκ(λ) deﬁned as follows: f(x) = {fα(x) : α ∈x};
we claim that [f] = {aα : α < λ}.
On the one hand, if α < λ, then α ∈x for almost all x and hence [fα] ∈[f].
On the other hand, if [g] ∈[f], then for almost all x, g(x) = fα(x) for some
α ∈x. By normality, there exists some γ < λ such that g(x) = fγ(x) for
almost all x, and hence [g] = aγ.
(b) Let j : V →M be an elementary embedding that satisﬁes (i), (ii),
and (iii). By (iii), the set {j(γ) : γ < λ} belongs to M and so the following
deﬁnes an ultraﬁlter on Pκ(λ):
(20.25)
X ∈U
if and only if
j“λ ∈j(X).
A standard argument shows that U is a κ-complete ultraﬁlter. U is a ﬁne
measure because for every α ∈λ, {x : α ∈x} is in U. Finally, U is normal: If
f(x) ∈x for almost all x, then (jf)(j“λ) ∈j“λ. Hence (jf)(j“λ) = j(γ) for
some γ < λ, and so f(x) = γ for almost all x.
⊓⊔
We have seen several examples how large cardinals restrict the behavior of
the continuum function (e.g., if κ is measurable and 2κ > κ+, then 2α > α+
for coﬁnally many α < κ). This is more so for supercompact cardinals:
Lemma 20.15. If κ is λ-supercompact and 2α = α+ for every α < κ, then
2α = α+ for every α ≤λ.
Proof. Let j : V →M witness that κ is λ-supercompact. If α ≤λ, then
because λ < j(κ) and by elementarity, (2α)M = (α+)M. Now M λ ⊂M
implies that P M(α) = P(α) and so 2α ≤(2α)M = (α+)M = α+.
⊓⊔

376
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
See Exercises 20.5–20.7 for a more general statement.
Lemma 20.16. If κ is supercompact, then there exists a normal measure D
on κ such that almost every α < κ (mod D) is measurable. In particular, κ is
the κth measurable cardinal.
Proof. Let λ = 2κ and let j : V →M witness the λ-supercompactness of κ.
Let D be deﬁned by D = {X : κ ∈j(X)}, and let jD : V →UltD be the
corresponding elementary embedding. Let k : UltD →M be the elementary
embedding deﬁned in Lemma 17.4:
k([f]D) = (jf)(κ).
Note that k(κ) = κ.
Now, P(κ) ⊂M and every subset of M of size λ is in M; hence every
U ⊂P(κ) is in M and it follows that in M, κ is a measurable cardinal. Since
k is elementary and k(κ) = κ, we have UltD ⊨κ is a measurable cardinal,
and the lemma follows.
⊓⊔
In contrast to Lemma 20.16, it is consistent that the least strongly com-
pact cardinal is the least measurable. The following lemma and corollary also
show that strongly compactness and supercompactness are not equivalent.
Lemma 20.17. Let κ be a measurable cardinal such that there are κ strongly
compact cardinals below κ. Then κ is strongly compact.
Proof. Let F be a nonprincipal κ-complete ultraﬁlter on κ such that C ∈F
where C = {α < κ : α is strongly compact}. Let A be such that |A| ≥κ; we
shall show that there is a ﬁne measure on Pκ(A).
For each α ∈C, let Uα be a ﬁne measure on Pα(A), and let us deﬁne
U ⊂Pκ(A) as follows:
X ∈U
if and only if
{α ∈C : X ∩Pα(A) ∈Uα} ∈F.
It is easy to verify that U is a ﬁne measure on Pκ(A).
⊓⊔
Corollary 20.18. If there exists a measurable cardinal that is a limit of
strongly compact cardinals, then the least such cardinal is strongly compact
but not supercompact.
Proof. Let κ be the least measurable limit of compact cardinals. By Lem-
ma 20.17, κ is strongly compact. Let us assume that κ is supercompact. Let
λ = 2κ and let j : V →M be an elementary embedding such that κ is the
least ordinal moved, and that M λ ⊂M. If α < κ is strongly compact, then
M ⊨j(α) is strongly compact, but j(α) = α and therefore M ⊨κ is a limit of
strongly compact cardinals. Since every U ⊂P(κ) is in M, κ is measurable
in M and hence in M, κ is a measurable limit of strongly compact cardinals.
This is a contradiction because M thinks that j(κ) is the least measurable
limit of strongly compact cardinals.
⊓⊔

377
The assumption of Corollary 20.18 holds if there are extendible cardinals
(deﬁned in the next section). There is also a consistency proof showing that
not every strongly compact cardinal is supercompact. (And another consis-
tency proof gives a model that has exactly one strongly compact cardinal and
the cardinal is supercompact.)
The construction of a normal measure from an elementary embedding
in (20.25) yields a commutative diagram analogous to (17.3). Let j : V →M
be an elementary embedding with critical point κ such that j(κ) > λ and
M λ ⊂M, cf. (20.24). Let
U = {X ∈Pκ(λ) : j“λ ∈j(X)}
be the normal measure deﬁned from j. Let Ult = UltU(V ), and jU : V →Ult.
For each [f] ∈Ult, let
(20.26)
k([f]) = (jf)(j“λ).
As in Lemma 17.4, one veriﬁes that k : Ult →M is an elementary embedding,
and j = k ◦jU.
We claim that
(20.27)
k(α) = α
for all α ≤λ.
To prove (20.27), let α ≤λ, and let us denote, for each x ∈Pκ(λ),
αx = the order-type of x ∩α
(compare with (20.23)). Since the order-type of jU“λ ∩jU(α) is α, it follows
from (20.22) that the function f(x) = αx represents α in the ultrapower:
[f] = (jUf)(j“λ) = the order-type of jU“λ ∩jU(α) = α. Now (20.27) follows:
k(α) = k([f]) = (jf)(j“λ) = the order-type of j“λ ∩j(α) = α.
Lemma 20.19.
(i) If λ ≥κ and if κ is µ-supercompact, where µ = 2λ<κ, then for every
X ⊂P(Pκ(λ)) there exists a normal measure on Pκ(λ) such that X ∈
UltU(V ).
(ii) If κ is 2κ-supercompact, then for every X ⊂P(κ) there exists a normal
measure D on κ such that X ∈UltD(V ).
Proof. (i) Assume on the contrary that there exists some X ⊂P(Pκ(λ)) such
that ϕ(X, κ, λ) where ϕ is the statement
(20.28)
X /∈UltU for every normal measure U on Pκ(λ).
Let j : V →M be a witness to the µ-supercompactness of κ. As M µ = M,
the ultrapowers by normal measures on Pκ(λ) are correctly computed in M,
and so M ⊨∃X ϕ(X, κ, λ).

378
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Let U = {X ∈Pκ(λ) : j“λ ∈j(X)} and let k : UltU →M be such
that j = k ◦jU. By (20.27), k(κ) = κ and k(λ) = λ, and since k : Ult →
M is elementary, we have Ult ⊨∃X ϕ(X, κ, λ). Let X ∈Ult be such that
Ult ⊨ϕ(X, κ, λ). By (20.27) again, k(α) = α for all α ≤λ, and it follows
that k(X) = X. By elementarity again, M ⊨ϕ(k(X), k(κ), k(λ)) and so
M ⊨ϕ(X, κ, λ). This contradicts (20.28) because X ∈UltU.
(ii) Similar, using (17.3).
⊓⊔
Corollary 20.20.
(i) If κ is supercompact then there are 22κ normal measures on κ.
(ii) If κ is supercompact then for every λ ≥κ there are 22λ<κ
normal
measures on Pκ(λ).
(iii) If κ is supercompact then the Mitchell order of κ is (2κ)+ ≥κ++.
Proof. (i) If D is a normal measure on κ and X ⊂P(κ) is in UltD, then
X is represented by a function f on κ such that f(α) ⊂P(α) for all α < κ.
Since the number of such functions is 2κ, it follows that UltD contains only
2κ subsets of P(κ). However, by Lemma 20.19(ii), each X ⊂P(κ) is contained
in some ultrapower UltD where D is a normal measure on κ, and therefore
there must exist 22κ normal measures on κ.
(ii) Similar, using Lemma 20.19(i).
(iii) There is an increasing chain of length (2κ)+ of normal measures on κ
in the Mitchell order: Given at most 2κ such measures, one can code them as
some X ⊂P(κ). By Lemma 20.19(ii) there exists a normal measure U on κ
such that X ∈UltU.
⊓⊔
We conclude this section with the following theorem reminiscent of the
Diamond Principle.
Theorem 20.21 (Laver). Let κ be a supercompact cardinal. There exists
a function f : κ →Vκ such that for every set x and every λ ≥κ such that λ ≥
| TC(x)| there exists a normal measure U on Pκ(λ) such that jU(f)(κ) = x.
(Such an f is called a Laver function.)
Proof. Assume that the theorem is false. For each f : κ →Vκ, let λf be the
least cardinal λf ≥κ for which there exists an x with | TC(x)| ≤λx such
that jU(f)(κ) ̸= x for every normal measure U on Pκ(λf). Let ν be greater
than all the λf and let j : V →M be a witness to the ν-supercompactness
of κ.
Let ϕ(g, δ) be the statement that for some cardinal α, g : α →Vα and
δ is the least cardinal δ ≥α for which there exists an x with | TC(x)| ≤δ
such that there is no normal measure U on Pα(δ) with (jUg)(α) = x. (Let λg
denote this δ.) Since M ν ⊂M, we have M ⊨ϕ(f, λf), for all f : κ →Vκ.
Let A be the set of all α < κ such that ϕ(g, λg) holds for all g : α →Vα.
Clearly, κ ∈j(A).

20. Very Large Cardinals
379
Now we deﬁne f : κ →Vκ inductively as follows. If α ∈A, we let f(α) =
xα where xα witnesses ϕ(f↾α, λf↾α); otherwise, f(α) = ∅.
Let x = (jf)(κ). It follows from the construction of f that x witnesses
ϕ(f, λf) in M, and hence in V . Let U = {X ∈Pκ(λ) : j“λ ∈j(X)}; we
shall reach a contradiction by showing that (jUf)(κ) = x. Let k : UltU →M
be the elementary embedding from (20.26) such that j = k ◦jU. By (20.27),
k(x) = x, and therefore
(jUf)(κ) = k−1((jf)(κ)) = k−1(x) = x.
⊓⊔
Beyond Supercompactness
Elementary embeddings can be used to deﬁne large cardinals that are stronger
than supercompact.
Deﬁnition 20.22. A cardinal κ is extendible if for every α > κ there exist
an ordinal β and an elementary embedding j : Vα →Vβ with critical point κ.
Lemma 20.23. Let λ ≥κ be a regular cardinal and let κ be λ-supercompact.
Let α < κ. If α is γ-supercompact for all γ < κ, then α is λ-supercompact.
Proof. Let U be a normal measure on Pκ(λ), and let us consider jU : V →
UltU. Since j(α) = α, we have Ult ⊨(α is γ-supercompact for all γ < j(κ)); in
particular, Ult ⊨α is λ-supercompact. Hence there is D such that Ult ⊨D is
a normal measure on Pα(λ). Now, |Pα(λ)| = λ and Ultλ ⊂Ult, and hence
every subset of Pα(λ) is in Ult. It follows that D is a normal measure on Pα(λ).
⊓⊔
Theorem 20.24.
(i) If κ is extendible, then κ is supercompact.
(ii) If κ is extendible, then there is a normal measure D on κ such that
{α < κ : α is supercompact} ∈D.
Proof. (i) Let α > κ be a limit cardinal with the property that if Vα ⊨(κ is
λ-supercompact for all λ), then κ is supercompact. (Such an α exists by the
Reﬂection Principle.) Thus it suﬃces to show that κ is λ-supercompact for
all regular λ < α.
Let j : Vα →Vβ be such that κ is the critical point. Consider the sequence
κ0 = κ, κ1 = j(κ), . . . , κn+1 = j(κn), . . . , as long as j(κn) is deﬁned. First
we note that by Exercise 17.8 either there is some n such that κn < α ≤j(κn)
or α = limn→∞κn. Therefore, it is suﬃcient to prove, by induction on n, that
κ is λ-supercompact for each regular λ < κn (if λ < α).
Clearly, κ is λ-supercompact for each λ < κ1. Thus let n ≥1 and let
us assume that κ is λ-supercompact for all λ < κn. Applying j, we get:
Vβ ⊨(j(κ) is λ-supercompact for all regular λ < κn+1). Now we also have

380
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Vβ ⊨(κ is γ-supercompact for all γ < j(κ)) and we can apply Lemma 20.23
(in Vβ) to conclude that Vβ ⊨(κ is λ-supercompact for all regular λ < κn+1).
This completes the induction step.
(ii) Let α be some limit ordinal greater than κ and let j : Vα →Vβ be
such that κ is the critical point. Let D = {X ⊂κ : κ ∈j(X)}. By (i),
κ is supercompact, and so Vβ ⊨(κ is γ-supercompact for all γ < j(κ)).
Hence A ∈D, where A = {α < κ : α is γ-supercompact for all γ < κ}. By
Lemma 20.23, every α ∈A is supercompact.
⊓⊔
Let us consider now the following axiom schema called Vopˇenka’s Prin-
ciple (VP):
(20.29)
Let C be a proper class of models of the same language. Then
there exist two members A, B of the class C such that A can be
elementarily embedded in B.
Lemma 20.25. If Vopˇenka’s Principle holds, then there exists an extendible
cardinal.
Proof. Let A be the class of all limit ordinals α such that cf α = ω and that for
every κ < α, if Vα ⊨(κ is extendible), then κ is extendible; and for κ < γ < α,
if there is an elementary embedding j : Vγ →Vδ with critical point κ, then
Vα ⊨(there is an elementary embedding). Using the Reﬂection Principle, we
see that A is a proper class. Let C consist of the models (Vα+1, ∈), for α ∈A.
By Vopˇenka’s Principle, there exist α, β ∈A and an elementary embed-
ding j : Vα+1 →Vβ+1. Since j(α) = β, j moves some ordinal; its critical
point is measurable and so it is not α (which has coﬁnality ω). Let κ be the
critical point.
Now Vα ⊨(κ is extendible) because for every γ < α, j↾Vγ reﬂects to
a witness to extendibility. By deﬁnition of A, κ is extendible.
⊓⊔
A similar argument shows that Vopˇenka’s Principle implies existence of
arbitrarily large extendible cardinals.
Deﬁnition 20.26. A cardinal κ is huge if there exists an elementary em-
bedding j : V →M with critical point κ such that M j(κ) ⊂M.
“Huge” is expressible in ZF: see Exercise 20.11.
Lemma 20.27. If κ is a huge cardinal, then Vopˇenka’s Principle is consis-
tent: (Vκ, ∈) is a model of VP.
Proof. We shall show that if C is a set of models and rank(C) = κ, then
there exist two members A, B ∈C and an elementary embedding h : A →B.
Let j : V →M be such that κ is the least cardinal moved and that
M j(κ) ⊂M. Since rank(C) = κ, there exists an A0 ∈j(C) such that A0 /∈C.
It follows that j(A0) ̸= A0.

20. Very Large Cardinals
381
Let e0 = j↾A0; it is easy to see that e0 is an elementary embedding of A0
into j(A0), and since |A0| < j(κ), we have e0 ∈M. Hence
M ⊨there exists an A ∈j(C), A ̸= j(A0), and there
exists an elementary e : A →j(A0);
and so there exists some A ∈C, A ̸= A0, and there exists an elementary
e : A →A0. Let A, e be such; clearly,
M ⊨e is an elementary embedding of A into A0,
and because rank(A) < κ, we have A = j(A), and hence A ∈j(C), and so
M ⊨there exist distinct A, B ∈j(C), and there exists
an elementary h : A →B.
It follows that there exist distinct A, B ∈C, and an elementary embedding
h : A →B.
⊓⊔
While the least huge cardinal is greater than the least measurable cardinal
(see Exercise 20.13), it is smaller than the least supercompact cardinal (if
both exist) even though the consistency of “there exists a huge cardinal” is
stronger than the consistency of “there exists a supercompact cardinal.” See
Exercise 20.12.
Finally, consider the following axiom:
(20.30)
There exists a nontrivial elementary embedding j : Vλ →Vλ where
λ is a limit ordinal.
Let κ be the critical point of an elementary embedding j : Vλ →Vλ. The
necessarily λ ≥κn for each n (where κn are as in Theorem 17.7), and it
follows from Exercise 17.8 that λ = limn→∞κn. It is easily seen that κ is
huge (by Exercise 20.11), in fact n-huge for all n; see Exercise 20.15.
In view of Kunen’s Theorem 17.7, axiom (20.30) (and its variants) is the
strongest possible large cardinal axiom.
Extenders and Strong Cardinals
In this section we show how elementary embeddings can be analyzed using
direct limits of ultrapowers. An elementary embedding can be approximated
by a system of measures called extenders. The theory of extenders plays
a crucial role in the inner model theory. While this theory is too weak to
describe supercompactness, it is strong enough to describe a weak version of
it that is considerably stronger than measurability.
Deﬁnition 20.28. A cardinal κ is a strong cardinal if for every set x there
exists an elementary embedding j : V →M with critical point κ such that
x ∈M.

382
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Clearly, every supercompact cardinal is strong. Strong cardinals have
more consistency strength than measurable cardinals, and allow some of the
techniques associated with supercompactness; see Exercises 20.16–20.19.
It follows from the theory of extenders below that “strongness” is express-
ible in ZF. As with supercompactness, one can also deﬁne local versions of
strongness: κ is λ-strong, where λ ≥κ, if there exists some j : V →M with
critical point κ such that j(κ) > λ and Vλ ⊂M. A cardinal κ is strong if and
only if it is λ-strong for all λ ≥κ.
Let j : V →M be an elementary embedding with critical point κ and let
κ ≤λ ≤j(κ). We shall deﬁne the (κ, λ)-extender derived from j.
For every ﬁnite subset a ⊂λ, let Ea be the measure on [κ]<ω deﬁned as
follows:
(20.31)
X ∈Ea
if and only if
a ∈j(X);
note that Ea concentrates on [κ]|a|. The (κ, λ)-extender derived from j is the
collection
(20.32)
E = {Ea : a ∈[λ]<ω};
κ is the critical point of E and λ is the length of the extender.
Let a ∈[λ]<ω. The measure Ea on [κ]<ω is κ-complete; let UltEa denote
the ultrapower of V by Ea and let ja : V →UltEa be the corresponding ele-
mentary embedding. If for each equivalence class [f] of a function f on [κ]<ω
we let
(20.33)
ka([f]) = j(f)(a),
then ka is an elementary embedding ka : UltEa →M and ka ◦ja = j.
The measures Ea, a ∈[λ]<ω, are coherent, in the following sense: Let
a ⊂b, where b = {α1, . . . , αn} with α1 < . . . < αn. Then πb,a : [λ]|b| →[λ]|a|
is deﬁned by
(20.34)
πb,a({ξ1, . . . , ξn}) = {ξi1, . . . , ξim},
(ξ1 < . . . < ξn)
where a = {αi1, . . . , αim}, and
(20.35)
X ∈Ea
if and only if
{s : πb,a(s) ∈X} ∈Eb.
(Compare with Lemma 19.12.)
It follows that ia,b : UltEa →UltEb deﬁned by
ia,b([f]Ea) = [f ◦πb,a]Eb
is an elementary embedding, and
(20.36)
{UltEa, ia,b : a ⊂b ∈[λ]<ω}
is a directed system. The direct limit UltE of (20.36) is well-founded: Note
that the embeddings ka have a direct limit k : UltE →M such that k◦jE = j
where jE is the elementary embedding jE : V →UltE.

20. Very Large Cardinals
383
There is another description of the direct limit UltE: The elements of UltE
are equivalence classes [a, f]E where a ∈[λ]<ω and f : [κ]|a| →V . Here
(a, f) and (b, g) are equivalent if {s ∈[κ]|a∪b| : ˜f(s) = ˜g(s)} ∈Ea∪b, where
˜f = f ◦πa∪b,a and ˜g = g ◦πa∪b,b. The embedding jE : V →UltE is deﬁned by
jE(x) = [∅, cx] where cx is the constant function with value x. The embedding
k : UltE →M is deﬁned by
(20.37)
k([a, f]) = j(f)(a).
Now k ◦jE = j follows.
Lemma 20.29.
(i) k(α) = α for all α < λ.
(ii) jE has critical point κ and jE(κ) ≥λ.
(iii) UltE = {jE(f)(a) : a ∈[λ]<ω, f : [κ]<ω →V }.
Proof. For each a ∈[λ]<ω, let ja,∞: UltEa →UltE be the direct limit
embedding such that ja,∞◦ja = jE; then k ◦ja,∞= ka. If x ∈UltE then
x = ja,∞([f]) for some [f] ∈UltEa, and
k(x) = k(ja,∞([f])) = ka([f]) = j(f)(a)
(see also (20.37)). Hence
(20.38)
k“ UltE = {j(f)(a) : a ∈[λ]<ω, f ∈[κ]<ω →V }.
(i) By letting f be the identity function, we get from (20.38) that a ∈
k“ UltE, for each a ∈[λ]<ω. Hence λ ⊂k“ UltE, and therefore k(α) = α for
all α < λ.
(ii) This follows from (i), because j = k ◦jE.
(iii) Since k(a) = a for every a ∈[λ]<ω, it follows from (20.38) that for
every x ∈UltE, k(x) = j(f)(a) = k(jE(f))(k(a)) = k(jE(f)(a)) for some a
and f, and hence x = jE(f)(a).
⊓⊔
Hence jE is an elementary embedding, jE : V →UltE, with critical
point κ. Since j = k ◦jE and since k(a) = a for all a ∈[λ]<ω, it follows that
for all X ∈[κ]|a|, a ∈jE(X) if and only if a ∈j(X). Hence E is the extender
derived from jE.
Extenders can be deﬁned directly, without reference to an embedding j.
The following, somewhat technical, properties guarantee that the (κ, λ)-
extender is derived from the direct limit embedding jE: Let κ ≤λ, and

384
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
let E = {Ea : a ∈[λ]<ω}. E is a (κ, λ)-extender if
(i) Each Ea is a κ-complete measure on [κ]|a|, and
(a) at least one Ea is not κ+-complete,
(b) for each α ∈κ, at least one Ea contains the set {s ∈[κ]|a| :
α ∈s}.
(ii) (Coherence) The Ea’s are coherent, i.e., satisfy (20.35).
(iii) (Normality) If {s ∈[κ]|a| : f(s) ∈max s} ∈Ea, then for some
b ⊃a, {t ∈[κ]|b| : (f ◦πb,a)(t) ∈t} ∈Eb.
(iv) The limit ultrapower UltE is well-founded.
(20.39)
We leave out the veriﬁcation that the extender derived from some j satis-
ﬁes (20.39), and that the properties (20.39) suﬃce to prove (ii) and (iii) of
Lemma 20.29, and that E is derived from jE.
An immediate consequence of the above technique is the following char-
acterization of strong cardinals:
Lemma 20.30. A cardinal κ is strong if and only if for every λ ≥κ there
is a (κ, |Vλ|+)-extender E such that Vλ ⊂UltE and λ < jE(κ).
⊓⊔
Hence “strongness” is expressible in ZFC.
We conclude by introducing a large cardinal property that was isolated
by Woodin and that has played a central role in the study of determinacy
and inner models:
Deﬁnition 20.31. A cardinal δ is a Woodin cardinal if for all A ⊂Vδ there
are arbitrarily large κ < δ such that for all λ < δ there exists an elementary
embedding j : V →M with critical point κ, such that j(κ) > λ, Vλ ⊂M,
and A ∩Vλ = j(A) ∩Vλ.
Being a Woodin cardinal is expressible in ZFC, in terms of extenders. Ev-
ery supercompact cardinal is Woodin, and below a Woodin cardinal δ, there
are δ cardinals that are λ-strong for every λ < δ. While Woodin cardinals are
inaccessible (and Mahlo), the least Woodin cardinal is not weakly compact,
as δ being Woodin is a Π1
1 property of (Vδ, ∈).
Exercises
20.1. If κ is strongly compact then Lκ,κ satisﬁes the Compactness Theorem.

U(L[A]), let
j : L[A] →M, i : L[A] →N, and let k : N →M be as there. Again, M = N, and
i(λ+) is the least ordinal moved. By Lemma 17.32, N thinks that i(λ+) is ineﬀable;
hence λ+ is ineﬀable in L[A].]

20.3. The following are equivalent, for κ ≤λ:
(i) There is a ﬁne measure on Pκ(λ).
(ii) For any set S, every κ-complete ﬁlter on S generated by at most λ sets can
be extended to a κ-complete ultraﬁlter on S.
20.4. If U is a normal measure on Pκ(λ), then every closed unbounded subset
of Pκ(λ) is in U.
[If C ⊂Pκ(λ) is closed unbounded, then D = {j(x) : x ∈C} is a directed subset
of j(C) and |D| = λ<κ < j(κ). Hence S D ∈j(C), and since S D = {j(γ) : γ < λ},
we have C ∈U.]
20.5. Let λ ≥κ and let U be a normal measure on Pκ(λ). The ultraproduct
UltU{(Vλx, ∈) : x ∈Pκ(λ)} is isomorphic to (Vλ, ∈).
20.6. If κ is inaccessible then Vκ ≺Σ1 V .
20.7. If κ is supercompact then Vκ ≺Σ2 V .
[Let x ∈Vκ such that ∃y ϕ(x, y) where ϕ is Π1. Let j : V →M be such that
y ∈M ∩Vj(κ). In M, Vj(κ) ⊨∃y ϕ(x, y), hence Vκ ⊨∃y ϕ(x, y).]
Let κ be supercompact and let λ ≥κ be a cardinal. A normal measure D
on Pκ(λ) is strongly normal if there exists X ∈D such that for every function f
on X, if for each nonempty x ∈X, f(x) is in X, f(x) ⊂x and f(x) ̸= x, then f is
constant on some Y ∈D.
20.8. The following are equivalent:
(i) D is strongly normal.
(ii) There is X ∈D such that if {Zx : x ∈X} ⊂D, then △x∈X Zx ∈D where
△x∈X Zx = {y : y ∈Zx for each x ⊂y such that x ̸= y and x ∈X}.
(iii) D has this partition property: If F : [Pκ(λ)]2 →{0, 1} is a partition, then
there is X ∈D such that F is constant on {{x, y} ∈[X]2 : x ⫋y or y ⫋x}.
(iv) There is X ∈D such that if x, y ∈X, x ̸= y and x ⊂y, then λx < κy.
[(i) →(ii): Let X ∈D be a witness to strong normality. Prove by contradiction
that D is closed under △x∈X Zx.
(ii) →(iii): Let F : [Pκ(λ)]2 →{0, 1}; for each x, let Fx : ˆx →{0, 1} be
Fx(y) = F(x, y). For each x there is Zx ⊂ˆx, Zx ∈D, such that Fx is constant
on Zx. Let X ∈D be as in (ii) and such that the constant value of Fx is the same
for all x ∈X. Then X ∩△x∈X Zx is homogeneous for F in the sense of (iii).
(iii) →(iv): Note that if X ∈D, then there exist x, y ∈X such that x ⫋y and
λx < κy.
(iv) →(i): Let X ∈D be as in (iv) and let f : X →X be such that f(x) ⊂x
and f(x) ̸= x for all x. In UltD, if x ∈jD(X) and x ⊂j“λ, then |x| < j“λ ∩κ = κ
and hence x = j(y) for some y ∈Pκ(λ). Hence (jf)(j“λ) = j(y) for some y and so
f(x) = y for almost all x.]
It has been proved that if κ is supercompact, then every Pκ(λ) has a strongly
normal measure; however, not every normal measure is necessarily strongly normal:
20.9. If λ > κ is measurable, then there is a normal measure U on Pκ(λ) that is
not strongly normal.
[Let j : V →M be elementary, κ least moved, j(κ) > λ, and M λ ⊂M. Let D
be a normal measure on λ. Let us deﬁne a normal measure U on Pκ(λ) as follows:
X ∈U if and only if {α < λ : j“α ∈j(X)} ∈D. If X ∈U, then there exist α < β
such that j“α and j“β are in j(X); hence M ⊨∃x, y ∈j(X) such that x is an
initial segment of y. Thus ∃x, y ∈X such that x is an initial segment of y, and so
λx ≥κy.]

with λ = j(κ) and M λ ⊂M. Since µ is supercompact, let i : V →N be such that
i(µ) > λ and Vλ+2 ⊂N. If U is a normal measure witnessing the hugeness of κ,
then U ∈N, and hence N ⊨(∃huge cardinal below i(µ)). Thus there exists a huge
cardinal below µ, a contradiction.]

Historical Notes
Strongly compact cardinals were introduced by Keisler and Tarski in [1963/64];
supercompact cardinals were deﬁned by Reinhardt and Solovay. Theorem 20.3 is
due to Vopˇenka and Hrb´aˇcek [1966]; Theorem 20.4 is due to Kunen [1971b].

20. Very Large Cardinals
387
Solovay discovered that the Singular Cardinal Hypothesis holds above a compact
cardinal (Theorem 20.8); see [1974].
Menas and Magidor obtained several results on the relative strength of compact
and supercompact cardinals. Menas in [1974/75] showed that it is consistent (rela-
tive to existence of compact cardinals) that there is a compact cardinal that is not
supercompact. Magidor in [1976] improved Menas’ result by showing that it is pos-
sible that the least measurable cardinal is strongly compact (while by Lemma 20.16
it is not supercompact) and also showed that it is consistent (relative to supercom-
pact cardinals) that there exists just one compact cardinal and is supercompact.
Kunen’s proof of Theorem 20.4 uses a lemma of Ketonen (Lemma 20.5); Lemmas
20.9 and 20.10 which Solovay used in his proof of Theorem 20.8, are also due to
Ketonen; see [1972/73].
Most results on supercompact cardinals (e.g., Lemmas 20.16 and 20.19) are due
to Solovay; see Solovay, Reinhardt, and Kanamori [1978]; Magidor’s paper [1971a]
gives a number of normal measures on Pκ(λ) (Corollary 20.20(ii)). The example of
a strongly compact nonsupercompact cardinal (Lemma 20.17 and Corollary 20.18)
is due to Menas [1974/75]. Theorem 20.21 is due to Laver [1978].
Extendible cardinals were introduced by Reinhardt; he proved that extendible
cardinals are supercompact; see [1974]. The present proof of Theorem 20.24, as well
as Lemmas 20.23 and 20.25 are due to Magidor [1971b].
Lemma 20.27: Powell [1972].
A good source for further results on very large cardinals is the paper [1978] of
Kanamori and Magidor, as well as Kanamori’s book [1994].
Strong cardinals were used by Mitchell [1979a] to develop a theory of inner mod-
els for weak versions of supercompactness, and further studied by Baldwin [1986].
Extenders were introduced by Jensen and Dodd; see Dodd [1982].
Woodin cardinals were introduced by Woodin in 1984. They were used, among
others, in the proof of projective determinacy by Martin and Steel [1989].

21. Large Cardinals and Forcing
Many forcing techniques have been developed speciﬁcally for use with large
cardinals. Firstly, when investigating the eﬀect of large cardinals on cardinal
arithmetic, it is desirable to establish the relative consistency of statements
about the continuum function with the existence of various large cardinals.
The main technical question here is whether large cardinal properties are pre-
served under various forcing extensions. Secondly, it follows from the Cover-
ing Theorem that an attempt to violate the Singular Cardinal Hypothesis, or
even to change coﬁnalities, necessarily involves large cardinals. Indeed, forc-
ing techniques have been developed for changing coﬁnalities and for violating
SCH that use large cardinals. And thirdly, as the large cardinal hierarchy
serves as a gauge of consistency strength, forcing that uses large cardinals
provides an upper bound for the consistency strength of the problems that
the forcing proves consistent.
Mild Extensions
We begin with an early discovery that “mild” forcing extensions do not eﬀect
large cardinal properties, i.e., whether κ is a large cardinal is not changed by
forcing of size less than κ.
Theorem 21.1 (L´evy-Solovay). Let κ be a measurable cardinal in the
ground model. Let (P, <) be a notion of forcing such that |P| < κ. Then
κ is measurable in the generic extension.
Proof. We give a proof using elementary embeddings since similar arguments
will be used in subsequent constructions; for a direct proof, see Exercise 21.1.
Let B = B(P); since |B| < κ, we may assume B ∈Vκ. We can also assume
that P is a dense subset of B. Let G be a generic ultraﬁlter on B; let us work
in V [G].
Since κ is measurable in V , there is an elementary embedding j : V →M
with critical point κ, and M transitive. We shall extend j to an elemen-
tary embedding (denoted also j) of V [G] into M[G], thus showing that κ is
measurable in V [G].
Since B ∈Vκ, we have j(B) = B, and B is a complete Boolean algebra
in M. Since G is generic over V , G is also generic over M. Note that the

390
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
interpretation of Boolean names in M B by G is the same whether computed
in V or in M. We deﬁne j(x) for x ∈V [G] as follows: Let ˙x ∈V B be a name
for x, x = ˙xG. Let
(21.1)
j(x) = (j( ˙x))G.
Since ˙x ∈V B, we have j( ˙x) ∈M B and so (j( ˙x))G ∈M[G]. However, we have
to show that the deﬁnition (21.1) does not depend on which name for x we
choose.
Let ˙y be another B-valued name and let p ∈G be such that
(21.2)
p ⊩˙x = ˙y.
When we apply j to (21.2), we have (in M)
j(p) ⊩j( ˙x) = j( ˙y).
But j(p) = p ∈G and therefore
(j( ˙x))G = (j( ˙y))G.
Finally we show that j : V [G] →M[G] is elementary. Let ϕ be a formula
such that
V [G] ⊨ϕ(x, . . .).
Let ˙x, . . . be such that ( ˙x)G = x, . . . . There is some p ∈G such that
(21.3)
p ⊩ϕ( ˙x, . . .).
Applying j to (21.3), we get (in M)
p ⊨ϕ(j( ˙x), . . .)
(because j(p) = p). Hence
M[G] ⊨ϕ(j( ˙x), . . .)
and since ϕ was arbitrary, j is elementary.
⊓⊔
It turns out that practically every large cardinal property is unchanged
by mild extension:
Theorem 21.2. Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal, and let (P, <) be a notion
of forcing such that |P| < κ. Let G be a V -generic ﬁlter on P. Then κ is
inaccessible (Mahlo, weakly compact, Ramsey, measurable, strongly compact,
supercompact, huge, strong, Woodin) in V if and only if it is inaccessible
(Mahlo, weakly compact, Ramsey, measurable, strongly compact, supercom-
pact, huge, strong, Woodin) in V [G].

Proof. If κ is inaccessible in V , then ﬁrstly κ is regular in V [G] because all
cardinals and coﬁnalities above |P| are preserved. Secondly, if α < κ, then
(2α)V [G] ≤|B(P)|α < κ and hence κ is inaccessible in V [G]. Conversely, if
κ is inaccessible in V [G], then κ is inaccessible in V .
If κ is Mahlo in V , then ﬁrstly κ is inaccessible in V [G]. Secondly, every
α > |P| is a regular cardinal in V [G] if and only if it is a regular cardinal in V
and so the set S = {α < κ : |P| < α and α is regular in V [G]} is stationary
in V . It is easy to see that every closed unbounded set C ⊂κ in V [G] has
a closed unbounded subset D in V (Exercise 21.2). Thus, S is also stationary
in V [G] and hence κ is Mahlo in V [G]. Conversely, if κ is Mahlo in V [G],
then κ is Mahlo in V because V ⊂V [G].
If κ is weakly compact in V , let F : [κ]2 →{0, 1} be a partition of [κ]2
in V [G]. Let ˙F ∈V B be its name such that ∥˙F : [κ]2 →{0, 1}∥= 1. For all
α ̸= β ∈κ, let G(α, β) = ∥˙F(α, β) = 0∥; G is (in V ) a partition of [κ]2 into
|B(P)| pieces. Since |B(P)| < κ, there is an H ⊂κ of size κ homogeneous
for G, and it is easy to see that H is homogeneous for F.
Conversely, if κ is weakly compact in V [G], let F : [κ]2 →{0, 1} be
a partition of [κ]2 in V . There is, in V [G], a set K ⊂κ of size κ, homogeneous
for F. As in Exercise 21.2, K has an unbounded subset H ∈V ; hence F has
in V a homogeneous set of size κ.
The argument for Ramsey cardinals is exactly the same as for weakly
compact cardinals.
If κ is measurable in V , then it is measurable in V [G] by Theorem 21.1.
Conversely, if κ is measurable in V [G], let U ∈V [G] be a κ-complete non-
principal ultraﬁlter on κ, let J be the dual prime ideal, and let ˙J ∈V B be
its name. (Without loss of generality we assume that ∥˙J is a κ-complete non-
principal prime ideal∥= 1.) Let I = {X ⊂κ : ∥X ∈˙J∥= 1}. It is easy to
verify that I is a κ-complete ideal containing all singletons. We claim that I is
|P|+-saturated: If p ⊩ˇX /∈˙J and p ⊩ˇY /∈˙J, then p ⊩ˇX ∩ˇY /∈˙J (because
˙J is prime). Hence if X and Y are such that X /∈I, Y /∈I, and X ∩Y ∈I,
then ∥ˇX /∈˙J∥·∥ˇY /∈˙J∥= 0, and it follows that I is |P|+-saturated. However,
since I is ν-saturated for some ν < κ and κ is inaccessible, κ is measurable,
by Exercise 21.3.
If κ is strongly compact, let λ ≥κ and let us show that in V [G], there
is a ﬁne measure on Pκ(λ). Let U be a ﬁne measure on Pκ(λ) in V , and
let j = jU be the canonical elementary embedding jU : V →UltU(V ). The
standard argument shows that X ∈U if and only if H ∈j(X), where H is
the set in UltU(V ) represented by the function d(Z) = Z on Pκ(α); also,
H ⊃j“λ (and is equal to it if U is normal). Similarly, as in the proof of
Theorem 21.1 we extend j to V [G] as follows:
j(x) = (j( ˙x))G
where ˙x is a name for x; the deﬁnition is legitimate because we assume,
without loss of generality, that P ∈Vκ and hence j(p) = p for all p ∈P, and

392
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
j(P) = P. Now we deﬁne, in V [G], an ultraﬁlter W on Pκ(λ) as follows:
X ∈W
if and only if
H ∈j(X).
It is routine to verify that W is a ﬁne measure on Pκ(λ); for instance, if
Z0 ∈Pκ(λ), then {Z ∈Pκ(λ) : Z ⊃Z0} ∈W because j(Z0) = {j(α) :
α ∈Z0} ⊂H.
Conversely, if κ is strongly compact in V [G], let S be a set in V and let
F be a κ-complete ﬁlter on S (in V ); let us show that there is a κ-complete
ultraﬁlter in V extending F. Every set X ⊂F of size < κ in V [G] is included
in some Y ⊂F of size < κ such that Y ∈V (this is because |P| < κ).
Hence F generates a κ-complete ﬁlter in V [G] and that in turn is included
in a κ-complete ultraﬁlter on U. Let J be the dual prime ideal. As in the
proof for measurable cardinals above, the ideal I = {X ⊂S : ∥X ∈˙J∥= 1}
is κ-complete and |P|+-saturated, and clearly X ∈F implies S −X ∈I.
Since κ is inaccessible and I is ν-saturated for some ν < κ, I has an atom A.
If X ∈F, then X ∩A /∈I and so {X ⊂S : X ∩A /∈I} is a κ-complete
ultraﬁlter extending F.
The proofs for the remaining large cardinal properties are similar.
⊓⊔
There are numerous examples when κ ceases to be large when we use a no-
tion of forcing of size ≥κ (a good example is the L´evy collapse). The example
in Exercise 21.4 is quite interesting since inaccessibility of κ is preserved by
any notion of forcing that is α-distributive for all α < κ.
Kunen-Paris Forcing
It is an immediate consequence of the L´evy-Solovay Theorem that if κ is
a measurable cardinal, λ < κ, and F is a function on regular cardinals below λ
such that (i) F(α) ≤F(β) if α ≤β, (ii) cf(F(α)) > α, and (iii) F(α) < κ
for all α in its domain, then there is a model in which κ is measurable and
2α = F(α) for all α ∈dom(F).
One can also prescribe the values of the continuum function on regular
cardinals greater than the measurable cardinal; this can be done by a κ-closed
forcing; see Exercise 21.5.
The proof of the next theorem uses a method that preserves measurability
of κ while adding subsets to an unbounded set of cardinals below κ. It is vital
however that the set A ⊂κ has a normal measure 0.
Theorem 21.3 (Kunen-Paris). Assume GCH and let κ be a measurable
cardinal. Let D be a normal measure on κ and let A be a set of regular
cardinals below κ such that A /∈D; let F be a function on A such that
F(α) < κ for all α ∈A, and:
(i) cf F(α) > α;

21. Large Cardinals and Forcing
393
(ii) F(α1) ≤F(α2) whenever α1 ≤α2.
Then there is a generic extension V [G] of V with the same cardinals and
coﬁnalities, such that κ is measurable in V [G], and for every α ∈A,
(21.4)
V [G] ⊨2α = F(α).
Moreover, given any regular cardinal λ > κ+, we can ﬁnd V [G] so that there
are λ normal measures on κ in V [G].
Proof. Let j : V →M be the elementary embedding given by the ultra-
power UltD. As we assume that A /∈D, we have κ /∈j(A).
Let (P, <) be the Easton product of Pα, α ∈A, where each Pα is the no-
tion of forcing that adjoins F(α) subsets of α. Thus conditions are 0–1 func-
tions whose domain consists of triples (α, ξ, η) where α ∈A, ξ < α, and
η < F(α), and such that for every regular cardinal γ,
|{(α, ξ, η) ∈dom(p) : α ≤γ}| < γ.
In particular, |p| < κ for all p ∈P, hence P ⊂Vκ and so j(p) = p for each
p ∈P.
We shall however use not P but j(P) as our notion of forcing. Thus
j(P) is, in M, the Easton product of Pα for α ∈j(A). Note that P ⊂j(P)
and that j(P) is isomorphic to P × Q where P = (jP)<κ and Q = (jP)≥κ.
Let G be a V -generic ﬁlter on j(P). We claim that V [G] has the same
cardinals and coﬁnalities as V and satisﬁes (21.4) and that κ is a measurable
cardinal in V [G]. Let G1 = G ∩P; since j(P) is isomorphic to P × Q, there
is a V [G1]-generic ﬁlter G2 on Q such that V [G] = V [G1 × G2].
As we have noted before, κ /∈j(A), and so Q = (jP)≥κ is in fact =
(jP)>κ, and hence is, in M, κ-closed. But since M κ ⊂M, Q is κ-closed
in V . Moreover, we have |P| = κ and |j(P)| = |j(κ)| = κ+. Thus for each
regular λ ≤κ, we can break j(P) into a product of two notions of forcing,
one that satisﬁes the λ+-chain condition and one that is λ-closed, and hence
all cardinals ≤κ+ are preserved. Since |j(P)| = κ+, all cardinals > κ+ are
also preserved.
We prove (21.4) similarly to Easton’s Theorem. For α ∈A, we regard j(P)
as a product (jP)>α × (jP)≤α; and since (jP)≤α = P ≤α and (jP)>α is α-
closed, we conclude that (2α)V [G] = F(α).
The crucial step is to show that κ is a measurable cardinal in V [G]. We
shall ﬁrst extend j : V →M to an elementary embedding
(21.5)
j : V [G1] →M[G].
We deﬁne j(x) for x ∈V [G1] as follows: If ˙x ∈V P is a name for x, we let
(21.6)
j(x) = (j( ˙x))G
where j( ˙x) is, in M, a j(P)-name. As in the proof of Theorem 21.1, we show
that (21.6) does not depend on the choice of ˙x. Since j(p) = p for all p ∈P

394
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
and because G1 ⊂G, it follows that if some p ∈G1 forces ˙x = ˙y, then (in M)
p ⊩j( ˙x) = j( ˙y) and therefore (j( ˙x))G = (j( ˙y))G. The same reasoning shows
that j : V [G1] →M[G] is elementary.
Using (21.5), we deﬁne an V [G1]-ultraﬁlter U on κ as follows:
(21.7)
X ∈U
if and only if
κ ∈j(X),
for all X ⊂κ in V [G1]. A standard argument shows that U is κ-complete;
and since j extends the original j = jD, U is nonprincipal.
Now we use again the fact that j(P) is isomorphic to P × Q, where
|P| = κ and Q is κ-closed. Thus every subset of κ is in V [G1] and therefore
U is in V [G] a κ-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on κ.
To get a model with λ normal measures on κ we modify the construction
above as follows: Let R be the κ+-product of λ copies of Q, i.e., the set of all
functions f ∈Qλ such that |{i < λ : f(i) ̸= ∅}| ≤κ. We consider the notion
of forcing P × R.
Let G×H be a generic ﬁlter on P ×R. We claim that the model V [G×H]
has the required properties.
Since R is κ-closed, all subsets of κ are contributed by G; hence 2κ = κ+
holds in V [G × H]. Standard arguments show that cardinals are preserved
and 2κ+ = λ in V [G × H].
To ﬁnd λ distinct normal measures, let us look more closely at the deﬁni-
tion (21.7) of U: U has a name ˙U ∈V P ×Q such that for all p ∈P and q ∈Q,
and any name ˙X ∈V P for a subset of κ,
(21.8)
p ∪q ⊩( ˙X ∈˙U ↔κ ∈j( ˙X)).
If q is represented in UltD by ⟨qα : α < κ⟩(with qα ∈P α for each α < κ),
we have
(21.9)
p ∪q ⊩˙X ∈˙U
if and only if
{α : p ∪qα ⊩α ∈˙X} ∈D.
For each i < λ, let Qi denote the ith copy of Q and let ˙Ui be the canonical
name for a normal measure using Qi instead of Q in (21.8). It suﬃces to show
that for any i ̸= k < λ, ˙Ui and ˙Uk denote diﬀerent measures in V [G × H].
The last assertion follows by a standard argument using genericity, and
we leave its proof to the reader: Given i ̸= k and a condition (p, r) in P × R,
use (21.9) to ﬁnd a stronger condition (p′, r′) and some P-valued name
˙X
such that (p′, r′) forces ˙X ∈˙Ui but ˙X /∈˙Uk.
⊓⊔
Silver’s Forcing
We shall now construct a model that has a measurable cardinal κ for which
2κ > κ+. By Corollary 19.25, the consistency strength of this is more than
measurability. It has been established that the failure of GCH at a measurable

21. Large Cardinals and Forcing
395
cardinal is equiconsistent with the existence of a measurable cardinal κ of
Mitchell’s order κ++. The lower bound is obtained by Mitchell’s method of
iterated ultrapowers from Chapter 19, while the upper bound follows from
improvements (due to Woodin and Gitik) on Silver’s forcing construction
presented below.
Theorem 21.4 (Silver). If there exists a supercompact cardinal κ, then
there is a generic extension in which κ is a measurable cardinal and 2κ > κ+.
Silver’s construction uses iterated forcing. As 2κ > κ+ for a measurable
cardinal implies that 2α > α+ for many α below κ, the iteration adjoins not
only subsets of κ, but, iteratively, subsets of regular cardinals below κ. The
iteration combines direct and inverse limits, in a manner similar to Easton’s
forcing.
Deﬁnition 21.5. Let α ≥1, and let Pα be an iterated forcing of length α
(see Deﬁnition 16.29). Pα is an iteration with Easton support if for every
p ∈Pα and every regular cardinal γ ≤α, |s(p) ∩γ| < γ. Equivalently, for
every limit ordinal γ ≤α, Pγ is a direct limit if γ is regular, and an inverse
limit otherwise.
When using iterated forcing that combines direct and inverse limits, we
can apply Theorem 16.30 to calculate the chain condition, and Exercise 16.19
to calculate the degree of closedness. We shall need the following variant:
Deﬁnition 21.6. A notion of forcing (P, <) is λ-directed closed if whenever
D ⊂P is such that |D| ≤λ and for any d1, d2 ∈D there is some e ∈D with
e ≤d1 and e ≤d2, then there exists a p ∈P such that p ≤d for all d ∈D.
Lemma 21.7.
(i) If P is λ-directed closed, and if ⊩P ˙Q is λ-directed closed, then P ∗˙Q is
λ-directed closed.
(ii) If cf α > λ, if Pα is a direct limit and if for each β < α, Pβ is
λ-directed closed, then Pα is λ-directed closed.
(iii) Let Pα be a forcing iteration of ⟨˙Qβ : β < α⟩such that for each limit
ordinal β ≤α, Pβ is either a direct limit or an inverse limit. Assume
that for each β < α, ˙Qβ is a λ-directed closed forcing in V Pβ. If for
every limit ordinal β ≤α such that cf β ≤λ, Pβ is an inverse limit,
then Pα is λ-directed closed.
Proof. (i) Let D = {(pα, ˙qα) : α < λ} be a directed subset of P ∗˙Q. Clearly,
D1 = {pα : α < λ} is a directed subset of P and hence there is p ∈P
stronger than all pα, α < λ. Since for any α, β < λ there is γ < λ such that
(pγ, ˙qγ) ≤(pα, ˙qα) and (pγ, ˙qγ) ≤(pβ, ˙qβ), it is clear that p ⊩( ˙qγ ≤˙qα and
˙qγ ≤˙qβ) and thus p forces that { ˙qα : α < λ} is a directed subset of ˙Q. Hence
p ⊩∃q ∈˙Q stronger than all the ˙qα

396
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
and therefore there is a ˙q such that ∥˙q ∈˙Q∥= 1 and
p ⊩˙q ≤˙qα for all α < λ.
It follows that (p, ˙q) ≤(pα, ˙qα) for all α < λ.
(ii) Let D be a directed subset of P, |D| ≤λ. For each d ∈D there is
γd < α such that if d = ⟨pβ : β < α⟩, then pi = 1 for all i ≥γd. Since
λ < cf α, there is γ < α such that each d ∈D is as follows:
d = (d↾γ)⌢1⌢1⌢1⌢. . . .
Now Dγ = {(d↾γ) : d ∈D} is a directed subset of Pγ; and since Pγ is λ-
directed closed, Dγ has a lower bound p ∈Pγ. Then p⌢1⌢1⌢1⌢. . . is a lower
bound for D in P.
(iii) By induction on α. It follows from (i) and (ii) that the assertion is
true if α is a successor or if Pα is the direct limit. Thus assume that Pα is an
inverse limit.
Let D = ⟨pν : ν < λ⟩be a directed subset of Pα; for each ν let pν = ⟨pν
β :
β < α⟩. We shall construct, by induction on β < α, a function p = ⟨pβ :
β < α⟩∈Pα stronger than all pν, ν < λ.
We construct p such that for each β < α, p↾β is in Pβ and is stronger
than all pν↾β, ν < λ. Having constructed p↾β, we let pβ be such that
p↾β ⊩pβ ≤pν
β for all ν < λ.
Moreover, if pν
β = 1 for all ν < λ, we let pβ = 1 too.
If γ ≤α is a limit ordinal, we have to show that ⟨pβ : β < γ⟩∈Pγ. If Pγ is
the inverse limit, then there is nothing to prove, so let us assume that Pγ is
the direct limit. By the assumption, we have cf γ > λ and therefore there is
a δ < γ such that for all ν < λ, pν
β = 1 for all β such that δ ≤β < γ. Hence
we have pβ = 1 for all β such that δ ≤β < γ, and so ⟨pβ : β < γ⟩∈Pγ.
Thus we have p = ⟨pβ : β < α⟩∈Pα, and it is clear from the construction
that p ≤pν for all ν < λ.
⊓⊔
An important feature of iterated forcing is that often, under reasonable
assumptions, an iteration Pα+β is equivalent to Pα ∗˙P (α)
β
where P (α)
β
is an
iteration of length β inside V Pα. The following lemma is used in applications
of iteration with Easton support:
Lemma 21.8 (The Factor Lemma). Let Pα+β be a forcing iteration
of ⟨˙Qξ : ξ < α + β⟩, where each Pξ, ξ ≤α + β is either a direct limit
or inverse limit. In V Pα, let ˙P (α)
β
be the forcing iteration of ⟨˙Qα+ξ : ξ < β⟩
such that for every limit ordinal ξ < β, ˙P (α)
ξ
is either a direct or inverse
limit, according to whether Pα+ξ is a direct limit or inverse limit. If Pα+ξ is
an inverse limit for every limit ordinal ξ ≤β such that cf ξ ≤|Pα|, then
Pα+β is isomorphic to Pα ∗˙P (α)
β
.

21. Large Cardinals and Forcing
397
This formulation is not quite accurate. The name ˙Qα+ξ is in V Pα+ξ while
P (α)
ξ
is an iteration in V Pα+β that at stage ξ should use a V Pα-name for
a name ˙Q(α)
ξ
∈V
˙P (α)
ξ
. However, the Factor Lemma yields, for each ξ, an
isomorphism between V Pα+ξ and the Boolean-valued model V
˙P (α)
ξ
inside V Pα,
and so ˙Qα+ξ is identiﬁed with a V Pα-name for some ˙Q(α)
ξ
∈V
˙P (α)
ξ
.
Proof. By induction on β. Let β be an ordinal number; we shall construct an
isomorphism π between Pα ∗˙P (α)
β
and Pα+β.
If β = 0, then Pα ∗˙P (α)
β
= {(p, 1) : p ∈Pα} and we let π(p, 1) = p. Thus
let β > 0. A typical element of Pα ∗˙P (α)
β
is a pair (p, ˙q) where p ∈Pα and
˙q is an element of V Pα such that in V Pα, ˙q is a β-sequence and satisﬁes the
conditions on iterated forcing; in particular, for each ξ < β, ˙q↾ξ is in ˙P (α)
ξ
and the ξth term of ˙q is in ˙Qα+ξ.
We shall deﬁne a β-sequence ⟨pα+ξ : ξ < β⟩and let π(p, ˙q) = p⌢⟨pα, pα+1,
. . . , pα+ξ, . . .⟩. This mapping π will be an isomorphism between Pα ∗˙P (α)
β
and Pα+β. For ξ < β, let ˙qξ ∈V Pα be such that ˙qξ is the ξth term of ˙q.
Hence
⊩Pα (⊩˙P (α)
ξ
˙qξ ∈˙Qα+ξ).
By the induction hypothesis, Pα+ξ is isomorphic to Pα ∗˙P (α)
ξ
. Let pα+ξ ∈
V Pα+ξ be the element corresponding to ˙qξ under the isomorphism between
(V Pα)
˙P (α)
ξ
and V Pα+ξ.
Let π(p, ˙q) = p⌢⟨pα, pα+1, . . . , pα+i, . . .⟩. All we have to do now is to show
that π is an isomorphism between Pα ∗˙P (α)
β
and Pα+β. We shall show that
for each (p, ˙q) ∈Pα ∗˙P (α)
β
, π(p, ˙q) is in Pα+β and leave the rest to the reader,
namely to show that
(p, ˙q) ≤(p′, ˙q′)
if and only if
π(p, ˙q) ≤π(p′, ˙q′).
We want to show that for each γ ≤β, p⌢⟨pα+ξ : ξ < γ⟩is an element
of Pα+γ. We need to show that if γ is a limit ordinal and Pα+γ is the direct
limit, then there exists i0 < γ such that pα+i = 1 for all i, i0 ≤i < γ.
Thus let γ ≤β be a limit ordinal such that Pα+γ is the direct limit of
Pα+ξ, ξ < γ. Hence in V Pα, ˙P (α)
γ
is the direct limit, and therefore
(21.10)
⊩Pα (∃ξ0 < γ)(∀ξ ≥ξ0) the ξth term of ˙q is 1.
Now we have made an assumption that if Pα+γ is the direct limit, then
cf γ > |Pα|. It is easy to see that because |Pα| < cf γ, (21.10) implies that
there exists ξ0 < γ such that for all ξ ≥ξ0, ⊩Pα ˙qi = 1. Thus for all ξ ≥ξ0,
⊩Pα+ξ pα+ξ = 1 and hence pα+ξ = 1 for all ξ ≥ξ0.
⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 21.4. Let κ be a supercompact cardinal and assume 2κ =
κ+. We shall construct a generic extension in which κ is measurable and
2κ = κ++.

Part II. Advanced Set Theory
We use iterated forcing with Easton support, successively adjoining to
each inaccessible cardinal α ≤κ, α++ subsets of α. At limit stages of the
iteration we use direct limits when the ordinal is a regular cardinal and inverse
limits otherwise.
Let us deﬁne, by induction on α, the αth iterate Pα (and the corresponding
forcing relation ⊩α and the algebra Bα = B(Pα)) and the Bα-valued notion
of forcing ˙Qα:
(21.11)
(i) If α is an inaccessible cardinal, let ˙Qα be the notion of forcing
in V Pα that adjoins α++ subsets of α; that is, we let ˙Qα be in V Pα, the set
of all 0–1 functions p whose domain is a subset of size < α of α × α++ (and
˙Qα is ordered by ⊃). If α is not an inaccessible cardinal, let ˙Qα = {1} (as
usual, 1 denotes the greatest element of each notion of forcing).
(ii) Pα is the set of all α-sequences ⟨pξ : ξ < α⟩satisfying the following:
(a) For every γ < α, p↾γ ∈Pγ and ⊩γ pγ ∈˙Qγ.
(b) If α is a regular cardinal, then ∃ξ0 ∀ξ ≥ξ0 pξ = 1.
(iii) If p, q ∈Pα, then p ≤α q if and only if
(∀γ < α)(p↾γ ≤γ q↾γ and p↾γ ⊩γ pγ is stronger than qγ).
Finally, let P = Pκ+1, and let B = B(P).
Let G be a generic ﬁlter on P and let V [G] be the generic extension
of V by G. We shall prove that κ is a measurable cardinal in V [G] and that
V [G] ⊩2κ = κ++. Since P is isomorphic to the two-step iteration Pκ ∗˙Qκ,
we have V [G] = V [Gκ][Hκ], where Gκ is V -generic on Pκ and Hκ is V [Gκ]-
generic on Qκ = ( ˙Qκ)Gκ. Now Pκ is the direct limit of Pα, α < κ; and since
κ is a Mahlo cardinal, there is a stationary set of α < κ such that Pα is also
a direct limit. Since |Pα| < κ for all α < κ, it follows by Theorem 16.30 that
Pκ satisﬁes the κ-chain condition and hence κ is a regular cardinal in V [Gκ].
Also, |Pκ| = κ, and hence V [Gκ] satisﬁes (∀α < κ) 2α ≤κ. In V [Gκ], Qκ is
a notion of forcing that adjoins κ++ subsets of κ and preserves all cardinals.
Thus V [G] ⊩(κ is a regular cardinal and 2κ = κ++).
It remains to prove that κ is a measurable cardinal in V [G]. This will
be done by ﬁrst constructing an elementary embedding of V [G] and then
showing that the induced measure is in V [G].
Let λ = κ++. Since κ is supercompact, there is an elementary embedding
j : V →M with critical point κ such that M λ ⊂M and j(κ) > λ. It
follows that |P| = λ, P ∈M, and moreover, P is deﬁned in M by the same
deﬁnition (21.11).
Since P ∈M, G is also an M-generic ﬁlter on P, and we can consider the
model M[G]. We need the following lemma:
Lemma 21.9. (M[G])λ ∩V [G] ⊂M[G].
Proof. It suﬃces to show that if f ∈V [G] is a function from λ into ordinals,
then f ∈M[G]. Let ˙f be a name for f and let p0 ∈G be a condition that

21. Large Cardinals and Forcing
399
forces that ˙f is a function from λ into the ordinals. For each α < λ, let
Aα = {p ≤p0 : ∃β p ⊩˙f(α) = β}.
Each Aα is dense below p0 (and hence Aα ∩G ̸= ∅). For each α < λ and each
p ∈Aα, let g(α, p) be the unique β such that p ⊩˙f(α) = β. Since |P| = λ,
we have |g| = λ and hence g ∈M. Now it is easy to see that f ∈M[G]
because it is deﬁned in M[G] as follows: f(α) = the unique β such that for
some p ∈G, g(α, p) = β.
⊓⊔
Let us now consider j(P). In M, j(P) is a notion of forcing obtained by
iteration up to j(κ) + 1. We claim that in M we can apply the Factor Lemma
to j(P) at α = κ + 1. First we note that (jP)α = Pα for all α < κ, and since
(jP)κ is the direct limit, we have (jP)κ = Pκ. Since ˙Qκ is the same in V
and M, it follows that (jP)κ+1 = Pκ+1. The ﬁrst nontrivial step above α in
the iteration occurs at the least inaccessible cardinal (in M) above κ, thus
the ﬁrst nontrivial direct limit is taken far above λ and then only at regular
cardinals. Since |Pκ+1| = λ, the assumption of the Factor Lemma is satisﬁed.
Hence j(P) is isomorphic to a two-step iteration (in M)
(21.12)
(jP)κ+1 ∗(jP)(κ+1)
j(κ)+1.
Now the ﬁrst factor of (21.12) is equal to Pκ+1 = P. Let us denote ˙Q the
second factor. By the Factor Lemma, ˙Q is, in M P , a notion of forcing obtained
by iteration, with Easton support, from κ + 1 to j(κ) + 1. At each ξ > κ, the
iteration uses a notion of forcing in M Pξ that is either trivial or adjoins
ξ++ subsets of ξ (if ξ is inaccessible in M); in either case, the notion of
forcing is λ-directed closed in M Pξ. By Lemma 21.7, ˙Q is λ-directed closed
in M P . Thus we can write
(21.13)
j(P) = P ∗˙Q
where ˙Q ∈M P is a λ-directed closed notion of forcing. Thus Q = ˙QG is
a λ-directed closed notion of forcing in M[G].
Let p ∈P. Then by (21.13), j(p) is (represented by) a pair (s, ˙q) where
s ∈P and ˙q ∈M P is in ˙Q. By the deﬁnition of P, p = ⟨pξ : ξ < κ + 1⟩and
there is ξ0 < κ such that pξ = 1 for all ξ, ξ0 ≤ξ < κ. Thus j(p) = ⟨p′
ξ :
ξ < j(κ) + 1⟩and p′
ξ = 1 for all ξ, ξ0 ≤ξ < j(κ). In particular, p′
κ = 1; and
since p′
ξ = pξ for all ξ < κ, and s = j(p)↾(κ + 1), we have s = (p↾κ)⌢1. This
implies that if p ∈G and j(p) = (s, ˙q), then s ∈G.
Now let
D = {q ∈Q : for some p ∈G, q = ( ˙q)G where j(p) = (s, ˙q)}.
Since P has size λ, we have j↾P ∈M and therefore D ∈M[G]. It is easy
to see that D is directed, i.e., if q1, q2 ∈D, then there is q ∈D such that

400
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
q ≤q1 and q ≤q2 (this is because G is directed). We have (in M[G]),
|D| ≤|G| ≤|P| = λ; and because Q is λ-directed closed, there exists some
a ∈Q (a master condition) such that a ≤q for all q ∈D.
We shall now consider a generic extension of V [G]. Let H be a V [G]-
generic ﬁlter on Q such that H contains the master condition a. Since H is
also M[G]-generic, and j(P) = P ∗˙Q, there is an M-generic ﬁlter K on j(P)
such that M[K] = M[G][H]; in fact
K = {(s, ˙q) : s ∈G and ( ˙q)G ∈H}.
Now we extend the elementary embedding j : V →M to an embedding
of V [G] into M[K]. We work in V [G][H] and deﬁne, for all x ∈V [G],
(21.14)
j(x) = (j( ˙x))K
where ˙x is some P-name for x.
We have to show that the deﬁnition (21.14) does not depend on the choice
of the name ˙x; the veriﬁcation of elementarity of j is then straightforward.
Here we use the master condition a. If p ∈G, then j(p) = (s, ˙q) where s ∈P
and ⊩˙q ∈˙Q. We have shown that s ∈G, and if q = ( ˙q)G, then, because
p ∈G, we have q ≥a and therefore q ∈H. Thus (s, ˙q) ∈K, and it follows
that
j“G ⊂K.
Now if p ∈G forces ˙x = ˙y, then j(p) ∈K forces j( ˙x) = j( ˙y) and hence
(j( ˙x))K = (j( ˙y))K.
Thus we have (in V [G][H]) an elementary embedding
j : V [G] →M[K]
and we can deﬁne, in the usual way, a V [G]-ultraﬁlter on κ:
U = {X ⊂κ : κ ∈j(X)}.
U is nonprincipal and κ-complete. It suﬃces to show that U ∈V [G]; then
V [G] satisﬁes that κ is a measurable cardinal.
By Lemma 21.9, Q is λ-closed not only in M[G], but also in V [G]. Thus
the generic extension V [G][H] of V [G] does not add any new λ-sequences
in V [G], and because |U| = λ we have U ∈V [G].
⊓⊔
Prikry Forcing
Let us address the following problem: Can one construct a generic extension
in which all cardinals are preserved but the coﬁnality of some cardinals is
diﬀerent from their coﬁnality in the ground model? Obviously, in order to
do this we have to change some (weakly) inaccessible cardinal into a singular

21. Large Cardinals and Forcing
401
cardinal. Corollary 18.31 of Jensen’s Covering Theorem tells us that for this,
it is necessary to assume at least 0♯in the ground model. Thus we formulate
the problem as follows: Let κ be some large cardinal and let λ < κ be a regular
cardinal. Find a cardinal preserving generic extension, in which cf κ = λ.
The forcing presented below was devised by Karel Prikry and has become
a standard tool of the large cardinal theory.
Theorem 21.10 (Prikry). Let κ be a measurable cardinal. There is a generic
extension in which cf κ = ω and no cardinals are collapsed. Moreover, every
bounded subset of κ in V [G] is in the ground model.
Proof. Let κ be a measurable cardinal and let D be a normal measure on κ.
Let (P, <) be the following notion of forcing. A forcing condition is a pair
p = (s, A) where s ∈[κ]<ω, i.e., s is a ﬁnite subset of κ, and A ∈D.
A condition (s, A) is stronger than a condition (t, B) if:
(i) t is an initial segment of s, i.e., t = s ∩α for some α;
(ii) A ⊂B;
(iii) s −t ⊂B.
(21.15)
We immediately note that any two conditions (s, A), (s, B) with the same
ﬁrst coordinate are compatible, and hence any antichain W ⊂P has size at
most κ. We also note that if (s, A) and (t, B) are compatible, then either s is
an initial segment of t, or t is an initial segment of s.
Let G be a generic ﬁlter on P. We shall show that in V [G], κ has coﬁ-
nality ω, that every bounded subset of κ is in V , and that all cardinals and
coﬁnalities above κ are preserved.
The last statement is immediate since P satisﬁes the κ+-chain condition.
It is also easy to show that cf κ = ω in V [G]: If (s, A) and (t, B) are in G, then
either s is an initial segment of t or vice versa; hence S = {s : (s, A) ∈G
for some A} is a subset of κ of order type ω. By the genericity of G, S is
clearly an unbounded subset of κ, and hence cf κ = ω.
It remains to show that if X ∈V [G] is such that X ⊂λ for some λ < κ,
then X ∈V . For this, we need the property of P stated in Lemma 21.12 be-
low. The proof uses Theorem 10.22 which states that every partition of [κ]<ω
into less than κ pieces has a homogeneous set H ∈D.
Lemma 21.11. Let σ be a sentence of the forcing language. There exists
a set A ∈D such that the condition (∅, A) decides σ, i.e., either (∅, A) ⊩σ,
or (∅, A) ⊩¬σ.
Proof. Let S+ be the set of all s ∈[κ]<ω such that (s, X) ⊩σ for some X and
let S−= {s : ∃X (s, X) ⊩¬σ}. Let T = [κ]<ω−(S+∪S−). By Theorem 10.22,
there is a set A ∈D such that for every n, either [A]n ⊂S+ or [A]n ⊂S−or
[A]n ⊂T . We shall prove that (∅, A) decides σ.
If not, then there are conditions (s, X) and (t, Y ), both stronger than (∅, A)
such that one forces σ and the other forces ¬σ. We may assume that |s| = |t|,

402
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
say |s| = |t| = n. Since (s, X) ≤(∅, A), we have s ∈[A]n; and similarly,
t ∈[A]n. But s ∈S+ and t ∈S−, which is a contradiction since S+
and S−are disjoint and therefore cannot both have a nonempty intersec-
tion with [A]n.
⊓⊔
Lemma 21.12. Let σ be a sentence of the forcing language and let (s0, A0)
be a condition. Then there exists a set A ⊂A0 in D such that the condi-
tion (s0, A) decides σ.
Proof. A slight modiﬁcation of the preceding proof; we may assume that
min(A0) > max(s0). Let S+ be the set of all s ∈[A0]<ω such that
(s0 ∪s, X) ⊩σ for some X ⊂A0 and let S−be deﬁned similarly. As be-
fore, there exists some A ⊂A0 in D such that for no n, [A]n intersects both
S+ and S−. It follows that (s0, A) decides σ.
⊓⊔
Now let λ < κ and let X ⊂λ; we will show that X ∈V . Let ˙X be a name
for X, and let p0 ∈G be a condition such that p ⊩˙X ⊂λ. It suﬃces to show
that for each p ≤p0 there is a q ≤p and a set Z ⊂λ such that q ⊩˙X = Z.
Let p ≤p0, p = (s, A). For each α < λ, there is, by Lemma 21.12,
a set Aα ⊂A in D such that (s, Aα) decides the sentence α ∈
˙X. Let
B = 
α<λ Aα; we have B ∈D and q = (s, B) decides α ∈˙X for each α < λ.
Thus if Z = {α < λ : q ⊩α ∈˙X}, we have q ⊩˙X = Z.
This completeness the proof of Theorem 21.10.
⊓⊔
An immediate consequence of Theorems 21.4 and 21.10 is the indepen-
dence of SCH:
Corollary 21.13. It is consistent (relative to the existence of a supercom-
pact cardinal) that there is a strong limit singular cardinal κ such that
2κ > κ+.
Proof. Let κ be a supercompact cardinal. First we construct a generic ex-
tension in which κ is measurable and 2κ > κ+. Then we extend the model
further to make κ a singular cardinal. The new model still satisﬁes 2κ > κ+,
and κ is a strong limit cardinal.
⊓⊔
We now prove a characterization of Prikry generic sequences due to Math-
ias. Let us ﬁrst generalize the diagonal intersection as follows: If {As : s ∈
[κ]<ω} is a collection of subsets of κ, let
(21.16)
△s As = {α < κ : α ∈{As : max(s) < α}}.
It is routine to show that every normal ultraﬁlter on κ is closed under diagonal
intersections (21.16).
Theorem 21.14 (Mathias). Let M be a transitive model of ZFC, let U
be, in M, a normal measure on κ, and let P be the Prikry forcing deﬁned
from U. For every set S ⊂κ of order-type ω, S is P-generic over M if and
only if for every X ∈U, S −X is ﬁnite.

21. Large Cardinals and Forcing
403
Proof. In the easy direction, let G be a generic ﬁlter on P and let S =
{s : (s, A) ∈G}. For every X ∈U, S −X is ﬁnite because for every
condition (s, A), the stronger condition (s, A ∩X) forces that every α ∈S
above s is in X.
For the other direction, let S ⊂κ, of order-type ω, be such that S −X is
ﬁnite for all X ∈U. We want to show that the ﬁlter
G = {(s, A) ∈P : s is an initial segment of S and S −s ⊂A}
is M-generic; let D ∈M be an open dense subset of P and let us show that
G ∩D ̸= ∅.
For each s ∈[κ]<ω, let F : [κ]<ω →{0, 1} be a partition such that
F(t) = 1 if and only if max(s) < min(t) and ∃X (s ∪t, X) ∈D. Let As ∈U
be a homogeneous set for F; if there is an X such that (s, X) ∈D, let
Bs = As ∩X, and otherwise, let Bs = As. Let A = △s Bs be the diagonal
intersection. Since D is open dense, we have for all s ∈[κ]<ω:
(21.17)
If ∃X (s, X) ∈D then (s, A ∖s) ∈D
where A ∖s = A −(max(s) + 1).
By the assumption on S, S has an initial segment s such that S −s ⊂A.
By density of D there exist a t ∈[B ∖s]<ω and X such that (s ∪t, X) ∈D.
Let u ⊂S −s be such that |u| = |t|; the homogeneity of A ∖s ⊂As for Fs
implies that for some Y , (s ∪u, Y ) ∈D. By (21.17) we have (s∪u, A∖u) ∈D
and since (s ∪u, A ∖u) ∈G, D ∩G ̸= ∅.
⊓⊔
The following theorem shows the relationship between Prikry forcing and
iterated ultrapowers. Let U be a normal measure on κ, and consider the
iterated ultrapowers Mα = Ult(α), and the embeddings iα,β : Mα →Mβ. Let
κα = κ(α) = i0,α(κ), and let U (α) = i0,α(U) be the measure on κα in Mα.
Theorem 21.15. Let M = Mω, N = 
n<ω Mn and let P ∈M be the
Prikry forcing for the measure U (ω) on κω in M. The set S = {κn : n < ω}
is P-generic over M, and M[S] = N.
Proof. The genericity follows from Lemma 19.10 and Theorem 21.14. N is
easily seen to be a model of ZF, and since M[S] ⊂Mn for all n, we have
M[S] ⊂N. In order to prove N ⊂M[S], it suﬃces, by Theorem 13.28, to
prove that every set of ordinals in N is in M[S].
First we claim that for every ordinal ξ
(21.18)
for eventually all n < ω, in,ω(ξ) = iω,ω+ω(ξ).
As ξ ∈Mω, let n be such that ξ = in,ω(ξn) for some ξn. Thus
Mn ⊨ξ is the image of ξn under the embedding from Mn into Mω.

404
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Applying in,ω, we have
in,ω(Mn) ⊨in,ω(ξ) is the image of in,ω(ξn) under the
embedding from in,ω(Mn) into in,ω(Mω).
Since in,ω(Mn) = Mω and in,ω(Mω) = Mω+ω, we get
in,ω(ξ) is the image of ξ under iω,ω+ω,
establishing (21.18).
Now let x be a set of ordinals in N. Hence x ∈Mn for each n. By the
representation of iterated ultrapowers, there is for each n < ω a function fn
on [κ]n such that x = i0,n(fn)(κ0, . . . , κn−1). Since in,ω(κi) = κi for i < n, we
have in,ω(x) = i0,ω(f)(κ0, . . . , κn−1). Now the sequence ⟨i0,ω(fn) : n < ω⟩=
i0,ω(⟨fn : n < ω⟩) is in Mω and therefore the sequence ⟨in,ω(x) : n < ω⟩is in
Mω[⟨κn : n < ω⟩] = M[S] .
If ξ is an ordinal then ξ ∈x if and only if for any n, in,ω(ξ) ∈in,ω(x), and
by (21.18), if for eventually all n < ω, iω,ω+ω(ξ) ∈in,ω(x). Since iω,ω+ω is
deﬁnable in M, x is deﬁnable from the sequence ⟨in,ω(x) : n < ω⟩in M[S].
Hence x ∈M[S], and N ⊂M[S].
⊓⊔
Measurability of ℵ1 in ZF
In ZF (without the Axiom of Choice), one can still deﬁne measurability in
the usual way: An uncountable cardinal κ is measurable if there exists a κ-
complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on κ. In the absence of the Axiom of Choice,
a measurable cardinal is still regular, but not necessarily a limit cardinal. The
absence of AC has no eﬀect on the consistency strength: If U is a nonprin-
cipal κ-complete ultraﬁlter on κ > ω, then in L[U] (a model of ZFC), κ is
a measurable cardinal. The following theorem shows that in ZF, ℵ1 can be
measurable:
Theorem 21.16. Let M be a transitive model of ZFC+“there is a measur-
able cardinal.” There is a symmetric model N ⊃M of ZF such that N ⊨ℵ1 is
measurable.
We shall construct a symmetric extension of M. Recall the theory of
symmetric models from Chapter 15. We consider a complete Boolean al-
gebra B, a group G of automorphisms of B, and a normal ﬁlter F on G
(see (15.34)). For every ˙x ∈M B we let sym( ˙x) be the symmetry group of ˙x,
sym( ˙x) = {π ∈G : π( ˙x) = ˙x}, and call ˙x symmetric if sym( ˙x) ∈F. We denote
HS the class of all hereditarily symmetric names. If G is an M-generic ultra-
ﬁlter on B, we let N be the G-interpretation of the class HS; N is a model
of ZF and N ⊃M.
Let us call a subset A ⊂B symmetric if
{π ∈G : π(a) = a for all a ∈A} ∈F.

21. Large Cardinals and Forcing
405
Lemma 21.17. Let κ be measurable in M, and let N be a symmetric exten-
sion of M (via B, G, F, G). If every symmetric subset of B has size < κ,
then κ is measurable in N.
Proof. Let U be, in M, a κ-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on κ. We show
that U generates a κ-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on κ in N. It suﬃces
to show that if γ < κ and {Xα : α < γ} is a partition of κ in N, then for
some α < γ, Xα includes some Y ∈U.
We give the proof for γ = 2 since the general case is analogous. Let
X ∈N be a subset of κ, and let ˙X ∈HS be a symmetric name for X. Let
A = {∥α ∈˙X∥: α < κ}. If π ∈G is such that π( ˙X) =
˙X, then (because
π(ˇα) = ˇα for all α) π(a) = a for all a ∈A; thus A is a symmetric subset of B.
Hence |A| < κ. For each a ∈A, let Ya = {α : ∥α ∈˙X∥= a}. Clearly,
{Ya : a ∈A} is a partition of κ into fewer than κ pieces, and hence one
Y = Yα is in U. Now if a ∈G, then we have Y ⊂X, and if a /∈G, then
Y ⊂κ −X. Hence either X or κ −X has a subset that is in U.
⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 21.16. Let κ be a measurable cardinal in M. Let P be the
set of all one-to-one ﬁnite sequences p = ⟨α0, α1, . . . , αn−1⟩of ordinals less
than κ; p is stronger than q if p extends q (P collapses κ; cf. Example 15.20).
Let G be the set of all permutations of κ; every π ∈G induces an automor-
phism of (P, <) as follows:
π(⟨α0, . . . , αn−1⟩) = ⟨π(α0), . . . , π(αn−1)⟩
and, in turn, an automorphism of B = B(P). Thus we identify G with the
group of automorphisms so induced.
For each γ < κ, let
Hγ = {π ∈G : π(α) = α for all α < γ}
and let F be the normal ﬁlter on G generated by {Hγ : γ < κ}. Thus ˙x ∈M B
is symmetric if and only if there is some γ < κ such that π( ˙x) = ˙x whenever
π(α) = α for all α < γ.
Let G be an M-generic ﬁlter on B and let N be the symmetric model
given by B, G, F, G. We shall show that κ = (ℵ1)N and that κ is measurable
in N.
If γ < κ, then γ is countable in N: Let ˙f be the name such that
∥˙f(n) = α∥= {p ∈P : p(n) = α}
for all n < ω and α < γ. Clearly, ˙f is symmetric because π( ˙f) = ˙f for every
π ∈Hγ, and hence ˙f ∈HS. The interpretation of ˙f is a one-to-one function
of a subset of ω onto γ.
It remains to show that κ is measurable in N. By Lemma 21.17 it suﬃces
to show that every symmetric A ⊂B has size < κ. Let A ⊂B be symmetric.
There exists a γ < κ such that π(a) = a for all a ∈A and all π ∈Hγ.

For every a ∈A, let Sa = {p ∈P : p ≤a}. If π ∈Hγ and p ∈Sa,
then π(p) ∈Sa because π(p) ≤π(a) = a. Let Ta = {p ∈Sa : p(n) < γ + ω
for all n ∈dom(p)}. If π ∈Hγ and p ∈Ta, then π(p) ∈Sa. Conversely, if
p ∈Sa, there is a π ∈Hγ that maps all α ∈ran(p) greater than γ into γ + ω;
since π ∈Hγ and p ∈Sa, we have π(p) ∈Sa and hence π(p) ∈Ta. Thus
Sa = {π(p) : p ∈Ta and π ∈Hγ}, and consequently
(21.19)
if a ̸= b ∈A, then Ta ̸= Tb.
However, each Ta is a set of ﬁnite sequences in γ + ω; and since κ is inacces-
sible, (21.19) implies that |A| < κ.

21.1. Let κ be measurable and |P| < κ; let U be a κ-complete ultraﬁlter on κ.
Then in V [G], the ﬁlter W = {X ⊂κ : X ⊃Y for some Y ∈U} is a κ-complete
ultraﬁlter on κ.
[For instance, to show that W is an ultraﬁlter, consider
˙X ∈V B such that
∥˙X ⊂κ∥∈G. The function α →∥α ∈˙X∥is a partition of κ into |B| < κ pieces,
and by the κ-completeness of U there is a Y ∈U such that ∥α ∈˙X∥is the same

[Forcing conditions are sets p ⊂κ such that |p ∩γ| < γ for every regular γ ≤κ;
p ≤q if and only if p is an end-extension of q, i.e., if q = p ∩α for some α. To show
that for any α < κ, P does not add any new α-sequence, observe that for every p
there is a q ≤p such that Pq = {r ∈P : r ≤q} is α-closed.]
21.5. If κ is a measurable cardinal and P is a κ-closed notion of forcing (or just
κ-distributive), then κ is measurable in the generic extension.

Kunen and Paris in [1970/71] Theorem 21.4 is an unpublished result of Silver;
an account of Silver’s forcing appeared in Menas [1976]. Theorem 21.10 is due to

22. Saturated Ideals
One of the key concepts in the theory of large cardinals is saturation of ideals.
In this chapter we investigate σ-saturated, κ-saturated and κ+-saturated κ-
complete ideals on κ.
Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal. Let I be a κ-complete ideal on κ
containing all singletons; thus X ∈I whenever X ⊂κ is such that |X| < κ.
We shall be using the following terminology: X has measure zero if X ∈I,
measure one if κ −X ∈I, and positive measure if X /∈I; the phrase almost
all α means that the set of all contrary α’s has measure 0.
Let us consider the Boolean algebra B = P(κ)/I. Recall that if λ is
a cardinal, then B is called λ-saturated if every pairwise disjoint family of
elements of B has size less than λ; sat(B) is the least λ such that B is
λ-saturated. Let us say that I is λ-saturated if B is λ-saturated and let
sat(I) = sat(B).
In other words, I is λ-saturated just in case there exists no collection W of
size λ of subsets of κ such that X /∈I for all X ∈W and X ∩Y ∈I whenever
X and Y are distinct members of W. If sat(I) is ﬁnite, then κ is the union
of ﬁnitely many atoms of I; if sat(I) is inﬁnite, then it is uncountable and
regular, by Theorem 7.15. If λ ≤κ, then I is λ-saturated if and only if there
is no disjoint collection W of size λ of subsets X of κ such that X /∈I (see
Exercise 22.1). Clearly, every I on κ is (2κ)+-saturated. Thus if I is atomless,
then sat(I) is a regular cardinal and
ℵ1 ≤sat(I) ≤(2κ)+.
Since I is κ-complete, it follows that B = P(κ)/I is a κ-complete Boolean
algebra.
Real-Valued Measurable Cardinals
By Ulam’s Theorem 10.1, if there exists a nontrivial σ-additive measure then
either there exists a measurable cardinal or there exists a real-valued mea-
surable cardinal.
In this section we prove the following theorems:

Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Theorem 22.1 (Solovay).
(i) If κ is a real-valued measurable cardinal, then there is a transitive
model of set theory in which κ is measurable.
(ii) If κ is a measurable cardinal, then there exists a generic extension in
which κ = 2ℵ0 and κ is real-valued measurable.
Theorem 22.2 (Prikry). If 2ℵ0 is real-valued measurable, then 2λ = 2ℵ0
for all inﬁnite λ < 2ℵ0.
If µ is a κ-additive real-valued measure on κ, then the ideal Iµ of all sets
of measure 0 is a σ-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ. We have proved that if
an uncountable cardinal κ carries a σ-saturated κ-complete ideal, then κ is
weakly inaccessible.
We shall prove Theorem 22.1(i) and Theorem 22.2 for this generalization
of real-valued measurability, namely under the assumption that κ is uncount-
able and carries a σ-saturated κ-complete ideal. Thus let κ be an uncountable
cardinal and let I be a σ-saturated κ-complete ideal. Thus let κ be an un-
countable cardinal and let I be a σ-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ.
Let us call A ⊂κ an atom if A has positive measure and is not the union
of two disjoint sets of positive measure. I is atomless if it has no atoms. What
we proved in Lemma 10.9(ii) can be formulated as follows: If I is atomless,
then κ ≤2ℵ0. It follows that if 2ℵ0 < κ, then every set X of positive measure
contains an atom A ⊂X, and hence there exists an at most countable disjoint
collection W of atoms such that κ = {A : A ∈W}.
We start with the following analog of Theorem 10.20. We recall that a κ-
complete ideal on κ is normal if every function f : S →κ regressive on a set
S ⊂κ of positive measure is constant on some T ⊂S of positive measure.
A real-valued measure µ is normal if Iµ is normal.
Lemma 22.3.
(i) If I is a σ-saturated κ-complete ideal on an uncountable cardinal κ,
then there exists a function f : κ →κ such that
J = f∗(I) = {X ⊂κ : f−1(X) ∈I}
is a normal σ-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ.
(ii) If µ is a κ-additive real-valued measure on κ, then there exists a func-
tion f : κ →κ such that ν = f∗(µ) deﬁned by
ν(X) = µ(f−1(X))
(X ⊂κ)
is a normal κ-additive real-valued measure on κ.
Proof. We shall prove (i) and leave the completely analogous proof of (ii) to
the reader. Let us say that a function g : S →κ is unbounded on a set S of
positive measure if there is no γ < κ and no T ⊂S of positive measure such

22. Saturated Ideals
411
that g(α) < γ for all γ ∈T . Let us consider the family F of all functions g
into κ deﬁned on a set of positive measure and unbounded on its domain.
Let us deﬁne g < h if dom(g) ⊂dom(h) and if g(α) ≤h(α) everywhere on
dom(g). Let us also deﬁne g ≤h if dom(g) ⊂dom(h) and if g(α) ≤h(α)
everywhere on dom(g). Let us call g ∈F minimal if there is no h ∈F such
that h < g.
We shall ﬁrst show that there exists a minimal g ∈F. Otherwise, for
every g ∈F there is h ∈F such that h < g. Thus let g ∈F be arbitrary.
Let W be a maximal collection of elements of F such that h < g for each
h ∈W, and that dom(h1) ∩dom(h2) = ∅whenever h1 and h2 are distinct
elements of W. Since I is σ-saturated, W is at most countable and by our
assumption, the set dom(g) −{dom(h) : h ∈W} has measure zero. Thus
if we let f = {h : h ∈W}, we have dom(g) −dom(f) ∈I, and f < g.
Since g was arbitrary, we can construct a countable sequence g0 > g1 > . . . >
gn > . . . such that dom(gn) −dom(gn+1) ∈I for each n. It follows that
∞
n=0 dom(gn) has positive measure and we get a contradiction since for any
α ∈∞
n=0 dom(gn) we would have g0(α) > g1(α) > . . ..
The same argument shows that for every h ∈F there exists a minimal
g ∈F such that g ≤h. Thus if W is a maximal family of minimal functions
g ∈F such that dom(g1) ∩dom(g2) = ∅whenever g1 and g2 are distinct
elements of W, W is at most countable and {dom(g) : g ∈W} has measure
one. Thus if we let f = {g : g ∈W}, then dom(f) has measure one and
f is a least unbounded function: On the one hand, if γ < κ, then there is no
S ⊂κ of positive measure such that f(α) < γ everywhere on S; on the other
hand, if S is a set of positive measure and g is a function on S such that
g(α) < f(α) everywhere on S, then g is constant on some T ⊂S of positive
measure. We can clearly assume that dom(f) = κ.
Let f : κ →κ be a least unbounded function; we shall show that J =
f∗(I) is a normal σ-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ. It is obvious that J is
a κ-complete ideal. For every γ ∈κ, f−1({γ}) has measure zero and hence
{γ} ∈J. If X /∈J, then f−1(X) /∈I, and if X ∩Y = ∅, then f−1(X) ∩
f−1(Y ) = ∅, and hence J is σ-saturated because I is σ-saturated.
To show that J is normal, let S /∈I, and let g(α) < α for all α ∈S. Then
g(f(ξ)) < f(ξ) for all ξ ∈f−1(S) and since f is a least unbounded function,
g(f(ξ)) is constant on some X ⊂f−1(S) of positive I-measure. Hence g is
constant on f(X) and f(X) /∈J.
⊓⊔
Lemma 22.4. Let I be a normal σ-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ. If S is
a set of positive measure and f : S →κ is regressive on S, then f is bounded
almost everywhere on S; that is, there exists γ < κ such that {α ∈S :
f(α) ≥γ} ∈I.
Proof. For every X ⊂S of positive measure there exists Y ⊂X of positive
measure such that f is constant on Y . Thus let W be a maximal disjoint
family of sets X ⊂S of positive measure such that f is constant on X. Let

412
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
T = {X : X ∈W}. The family W is at most countable and hence there
is γ such that f(α) < γ for all α ∈T . Clearly, S −T has measure 0.
⊓⊔
Corollary 22.5. If κ is real-valued measurable (or if κ carries a σ-saturated
κ-complete ideal), then κ is a weakly Mahlo cardinal.
Proof. Let I be a normal σ-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ. Since I is normal,
every closed unbounded set has I-measure one (see Lemma 8.11). Because
κ is weakly inaccessible, it suﬃces to show that the set of all regular cardinals
α < κ has measure one.
Let us assume that the set S of all limit ordinals α < κ such that cf α < α
has positive measure. Considering the regressive function α →cf α, we ﬁnd
a set T of positive measure and some λ < κ such that cf α = λ for all α ∈T .
For each α ∈T , let ⟨αν : ν < λ⟩be an increasing λ-sequence with limit α.
For each ν < λ, the function α →αν is regressive on T and so, by
Lemma 22.4 there is γν such that αν < γν for almost all α ∈T . Let γ =
sup{γν : ν < λ}. Since λ < κ, we conclude, by κ-completeness of I, that for
almost all α ∈T , αν < γ of all ν < λ. But this means that for almost all
α ∈T , α = limν αν ≤γ. This is a contradiction since T is unbounded.
⊓⊔
Since every closed unbounded set has measure one (if I is a normal σ-
saturated κ-complete ideal on κ), every set of positive measure is stationary.
It can even be proved that if S has positive measure, then S ∩α is stationary
in α for almost all α. Then it follows that κ is the κth weakly Mahlo cardinal,
κth cardinal which is a limit of weakly Mahlo cardinals, etc. We shall return
to this subject later in this chapter.
We shall now show that every real-valued measurable cardinal is a Row-
bottom cardinal; we shall show that the statement of Lemma 17.36 for
a measurable cardinal holds under the weaker assumption that κ carries a σ-
saturated κ-complete ideal.
Lemma 22.6. Let I be a normal σ-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ, and let λ
be an inﬁnite cardinal less than κ. Let A = (A, . . .) be a model of a language L
such that |L| ≤λ, and let A ⊃κ. If P ⊂A is such that |P| < κ, then A has
an elementary submodel B = (B, . . .) such that B ∩κ has measure one and
|P ∩B| ≤λ. Moreover, if X ⊂A has size at most λ, then we can ﬁnd B
such that X ⊂B.
The proof of Lemma 22.6 uses Skolem functions and arguments similar to
those in Theorem 17.27 and Lemma 17.36. The key ingredient is the following
lemma:
Lemma 22.7. Let I be a normal σ-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ, let γ < κ
and let f : [κ]<ω →γ be a partition. Then there exists H ⊂κ of measure one
such that the image of [H]<ω under f is at most countable.

22. Saturated Ideals
413
Proof. We proceed as in the proof of Theorem 10.22. It suﬃces to show that
for each n = 1, 2, . . . there is Hn of measure one such that f([H]n) is at
most countable; then we take H = ∞
n=1 Hn.
We prove, by induction on n, that for every partition of [κ]n into less
than κ pieces there is H ⊂κ of measure one such that f([H]n) is at most
countable. For n = 1, let f : κ →γ and γ < κ; let W be a maximal
pairwise disjoint family of subsets X ⊂κ such that X has positive measure
and f is constant on X. Let H = {X : X ∈W}. Since |W| ≤ℵ0, we have
|f(H)| ≤ℵ0, and since γ < κ and I is κ-complete, we clearly have κ−H ∈I.
Let us assume that the assertion is true for n and let us prove that it
holds also for n + 1. Let f : [κ]n+1 →γ where γ < κ. For each α < κ, we
deﬁne fα on [κ −{α}]n by fα(x) = f({α} ∪x). By the induction hypothesis,
there exists for each α < κ a set Xα of measure one such that fα([Xα]n) is
at most countable; let Aα be the image of [Xα]n under fα. Let X be the
diagonal intersection
X = {α < κ : α ∈
ξ<α
Xξ}
The set X has measure one since I is normal; also if α < α1 < . . . <
αn are in X, then {α1, . . . , αn} ∈[Xα]n and so f({α, α1, . . . , αn}) =
fα({α1, . . . , αn}) ∈Aα.
For each α ∈X, let Aα = {aα,n : n < ω}. For each n, consider the
function gn : X →γ deﬁned by gn(α) = aα,n. There exists a set Hn ⊂X of
measure one such that gn(Hn) is at most countable. Thus let H = ∞
n=0 Hn;
the set H has measure one, and moreover {Aα : α ∈H} = ∞
n=0 gn(H) is
at most countable. It follows that f([H]n+1) is at most countable.
⊓⊔
We can now proceed as in Theorem 19.3 and prove that if I is a normal
σ-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ and V = L[I], then GCH holds. In fact,
if D denotes the ﬁlter dual to I, that is, the ﬁlter of all sets of I-measure
one, then the proof of Theorem 19.3 goes through in the present context (use
P = {Y ⊂λ : Y ≤L[D] X}).
Now we recall the results of Chapter 18: If κ carries a σ-saturated κ-
complete ideal then either κ ≤2ℵ0 or κ is measurable. Thus we conclude:
If I is a normal σ-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ and V = L[I], then κ is
measurable.
Proof of Theorem 22.1(i). Let κ be real-valued measurable. Then there is
a normal κ-additive measure µ on κ by Lemma 22.3. Let I be the ideal of
sets of measure zero. I is a normal σ-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ. Let
J = I ∩L[I]. We have L[J] = L[I], and in L[I], J is a normal ℵ1-saturated
κ-complete ideal on κ. (If we could assume that ℵL[I]
1
= ℵ1, it would now
follow that κ is a measurable cardinal in L[I].)
Since we are not able to show directly that if I is σ-saturated, then I ∩L[I]
is σ-saturated in L[I], let us consider a somewhat more general situation.

414
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Let ν be a regular uncountable cardinal less than κ, and let us consider
ν-saturated κ-complete ideals on κ.
Lemmas 22.3 and 22.4 hold again; in Lemma 22.7 we have to replace “at
most countable” by “of size less than ν.” Lemma 22.6 holds for all λ ≥ν and
the analog of Theorem 19.3 is: If V = L[I] and I is normal, then 2<ν = ν
and 2λ = λ+ for all λ ≥ν.
Lemma 10.9 can also be generalized, and we get: If I is atomless, then
κ ≤2<ν. Hence if V = L[I], every set of positive measure contains a subset
that is an atom, and therefore κ is the union of a disjoint family W of atoms
such that |W| < ν.
Lemma 22.8. Let ν < κ be a regular uncountable cardinal, and let I be
a normal ν-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ; let F be the dual ﬁlter. Then
in L[F], F ∩L[F] is a normal measure on κ (and L[F] is the model L[D] of
Chapter 19 ).
Proof. It is easy to verify that L[F] = L[I], and that in L[F], I ∩L[I] is
a normal ν-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ. Thus we may assume that V =
L[F]; we want to show that F is an ultraﬁlter.
We know that κ is the union of a disjoint family W of atoms. (What we
want to show is that W has only one element.) For A ∈W, let
FA = {X ⊂κ : X ∩A has positive measure}.
Since A is an atom, FA is a ﬁlter, and FA is in fact a normal measure on κ.
Hence FA ∩L[FA] is the unique normal measure D in L[FA], and L[FA] is
the model L[D].
We shall now show that F ∩L[D] = D. Let X ∈L[D] be a subset of κ. If
X ∈F, then X ∈FA for all A ∈W and hence X ∈FA∩L[FA] = D. If X /∈F,
then there is A ∈W such that X /∈FA and hence X /∈FA ∩L[FA] = D. It
follows that F ∩L[D] = D and so F ∩L[D] ∈L[D].
Consequently, L[F] = L[D]; since we assumed that V = L[F] and because
F ∩L[D] = D, we have F = D.
⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 22.1(ii). Let κ be a measurable cardinal, and let λ ≥κ be
a cardinal such that λℵ0 = λ. We shall construct a generic extension in which
2ℵ0 = λ and κ is real-valued measurable.
Let F be a σ-algebra of sets and let µ be a measure on F. Let I ⊂F be the
ideal of sets of measure 0 and let us consider the Boolean algebra B = F/I.
That is, the members of B are equivalence classes [X] where X ∈F and
where X ≡Y if and only if µ(X △Y ) = 0.
Since both F and I are countably complete, it follows that B is countably
saturated and ∞
n=0[Xn] = [∞
n=0 Xn]. Since µ is a measure, I is countably
saturated and so B satisﬁes the countable chain condition. Now a Boolean
algebra that is both σ-complete and σ-saturated is complete, and so B is
a complete Boolean algebra.

For [X] ∈B, let us deﬁne m([X]) = µ(X). Clearly, the deﬁnition of m
does not depend on the particular choice of X, and furthermore, m has the
following properties:
(i) m is a real-valued function on B;
(ii) m(0) = 0, m(a) > 0 if a ̸= 0, and m(1) = 1;
(iii) if a ≤b, then m(a) ≤m(b);

(22.1)
A Boolean algebra B with a measure m (satisfying (22.1)) is called a measure
algebra; a set S with a ﬁeld of sets F and a measure µ on F is called a measure
space.
We need from measure theory the following basic fact about products of
measure spaces. Let I be a set (of indices), and for each i ∈I let (Si, Fi, µi)
be a measure space. Let us consider the product S = 
i∈I Si, and let us
consider the following σ-algebra of subsets of S: Let E be a ﬁnite subset of I,
and for each i ∈E, let Zi ∈Fi. Let Z ⊂S be as follows: If t ∈
i∈I Si, then
(22.2)
t ∈Z
if and only if
t(i) ∈Zi for all i ∈E.
Let F be the least σ-algebra of subsets of S such that F contains every Z ⊂S
of the form (22.2), for any ﬁnite E ⊂I and any Zi ∈Fi, i ∈E.
There exists a unique measure µ on F (the product measure) such that
for every Z of the form (22.2), µ(Z) is the product of µi(Zi), i ∈E. (In case
of the product S = S1 × S2, the measure of a “rectangle” Z1 × Z2 is equal to
µ(Z1) · µ(Z2).)
We shall use the following simple example of a product measure space (cf.
Example 15.31). Let I be an inﬁnite set, and for each i ∈I let us consider
the space {0, 1} of two elements. We give measure 1/2 to both {0} and {1}:
(22.3)
Si = {0, 1},
Fi = P(Si),
µi({0}) = µi({1}) = 1/2,
µi(∅) = 0,
µi({0, 1}) = 1.
Let S = 
i∈I Si, and let µ be the product measure on F, the least σ-algebra
of subsets of S containing the sets {t ∈{0, 1}I : t(i) = 0} for all i ∈I.
Let M be a transitive model of ZFC (the ground model). In M let λ be
an inﬁnite cardinal such that λℵ0 = λ. Let (S, F, µ) be the product measure
space {0, 1}I deﬁned above, where I = λ × ω. Let B be the corresponding
measure algebra F/the ideal of sets of measure 0.
Let G be an M-generic ultraﬁlter on B. Since B satisﬁes the countable
chain condition, the generic extension M[G] preserves cardinals. We shall
show that in M[G], 2ℵ0 = λ.

416
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
On the one hand, an easy computation gives |F| = λ (because λℵ0 = λ)
and since B satisﬁes the c.c.c., we get |B| = λ. Therefore
(2ℵ0)M[G] ≤(|B|ℵ0)M = λ
and we have (2ℵ0)M[G] ≤λ.
On the other hand, we shall exhibit λ distinct subsets of ω in M[G]. For
each α < λ and each n < ω, let uα,n = [Uα,n], where Uα,n is as follows:
(22.4)
Uα,n = {t ∈{0, 1}λ×ω : t(α, n) = 1}.
For α < λ, let ˙xα be the B-valued subset of ω such that
(22.5)
∥n ∈˙xα∥= uα,n
(n < ω).
Let xα be the G-interpretation of ˙xα.
We shall show that xα
̸= xβ whenever α ̸= β, and in fact that
∥˙xα = ˙xβ∥= 0. Let k be any natural number. Then
∥˙xα ∩k = ˙xβ ∩k∥= [Nα,β,k],
where
Nα,β,k = {t : t(α, n) = t(β, n) for all n < k}.
It is easy to verify that for each k, µ(Nα,β,k) = 1/2k. But ∥˙xα = ˙xβ∥=
∞
k=0[Nα,β,k] = [∞
k=0 Nα,β,k] = 0 since µ(∞
k=0 Nα,β,k) = 0. This completes
the proof that 2ℵ0 = λ in M[G].
Now let us assume that κ is a measurable cardinal in the ground model,
and let λ ≥κ be such that λℵ0 = λ. We construct a generic extension M[G]
of M, using the measure algebra described above. In M[G], we have 2ℵ0 = λ,
and we show that κ is real-valued measurable in M[G]. This follows from this
general lemma:
Lemma 22.9. Let κ be a measurable cardinal in the ground model M, let
B be (in M) a measure algebra, and let G be an M-generic ultraﬁlter on B.
Then in M[G], there exists a nontrivial κ-additive measure on κ.
Proof. Let U be a κ-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on κ. Let B be a com-
plete Boolean algebra and let m be a measure on B. We shall deﬁne a B-
valued name ˙µ and show that if G is a generic ultraﬁlter, then the G-
interpretation of ˙µ is a nontrivial κ-additive measure on κ.
Let a be a nonzero element of B, and let ˙A ∈M B be a B-valued name
such that a ⊩˙A ⊂κ. For each α < κ, we let
(22.6)
fa( ˙A, α) = m(a · ∥α ∈˙A∥)
m(a)
.

22. Saturated Ideals
417
Since U is a κ-complete, there is a unique real number r such that fa( ˙A, α) =
r for almost all α (mod U). Thus let
(22.7)
µa(A) = the unique r such that fa(A, α) = r almost everywhere
(mod U).
Note that if a ⊩˙A = ˙A′, then µa( ˙A) = µa( ˙A′). Also, if a ⊩˙A1 ⊂˙A2,
then µa( ˙A1) ≤µa( ˙A2). If X ⊂κ is in M, then fa( ˇX, α) = 1 for all α ∈X
and fa( ˇX, α) = 0 for all α /∈X. Hence µa( ˇX) = 1 if X ∈U and µa( ˇX) = 0
if X /∈U.
Let γ < κ and let ˙Aξ, ξ < γ, be such that a ⊩˙Aξ ⊂κ for all ξ < γ, and
that a ⊩˙Aξ ∩˙Aη = ∅whenever ξ ̸= η. Let ˙A be such that a ⊩˙A = 
ξ<γ ˙Aξ.
Then fa( ˙A, α) = 
ξ<γ fa( ˙Aξ, α) for all α < κ, and hence (because U is
κ-complete),
(22.8)
µa( ˙A) = 
ξ<γ
µa( ˙Aξ).
Let r be a real number, 0 ≤r ≤1, and let {an}∞
n=0 be a partition of a ∈B.
If µan( ˙A) < r for all n, then for almost all α, m(an·∥α ∈˙A∥) < r·m(an), and
it follows that for almost all α, m(a · ∥α ∈˙A∥) < r · m(a); hence µa( ˙A) < r.
As a consequence, we obtain:
(22.9)
If for every nonzero b ≤a there is a nonzero c ≤b such that
µc( ˙A) < r, then µa( ˙A) < r.
(And a similar statement holds when < is replaced by ≤, > or ≥.)
Now if b ⊩˙A ⊂κ, we deﬁne
(22.10)
µ∗
b( ˙A) = infa≤b µa( ˙A).
Again, if b ⊩˙A1 ⊂˙A2, then µ∗
b( ˙A1) ≤µ∗
b( ˙A2), and if X ∈M, then µ∗
b( ˇX) = 1
if X ∈U and µ∗
b( ˇX) = 0 if X /∈U. However, µ∗
b is not additive and we only
have (using (22.8)), for γ < κ:
(22.11)
µ∗
b( ˙A) ≥
ξ<γ
µ∗
b( ˙Aξ)
under the assumption that b ⊩
˙Aξ ∩˙Aη = ∅whenever ξ ̸= η, and that
b ⊩˙A = 
ξ<γ ˙Aξ.
Note that if b1 ≤b2, then µb1( ˙A) ≥µb2( ˙A).
Now we are ready to deﬁne ˙µ. Let G be a generic ultraﬁlter; in M[G], we
deﬁne µ : P(κ) →[0, 1] as follows:
(22.12)
µ(A) = supb∈G µ∗
b( ˙A)
where ˙A is a name for A. Let ˙µ be the canonical name for µ (deﬁned in M B
by (22.12) using the canonical ˙G).

It is clear that µ does not depend on the name ˙A for A, that A1 ⊂A2
implies µ(A1) ≤µ(A2) and that if X ∈M, then µ(X) = 1 if X ∈U and
µ(X) = 0 if X /∈U. It remains to show that µ is κ-additive.
Let r be a real number (in M) such that 0 ≤r ≤1. We claim that
(22.13)
µ∗
b( ˙A) ≥r
if and only if
b ⊩˙µ( ˙A) ≥ˇr.
If µ∗
b( ˙A) ≥r, then for every generic G such that b ∈G, µ(A) ≥r, and hence
b ⊩˙µ( ˙A) ≥ˇr. Thus assume that b ⊩˙µ( ˙A) ≥ˇr. Then
b ⊩∀q < ˇr ∃d ∈˙G µ∗
d( ˙A) ≥q,
that is,
(22.14)
∀q < r ∀c ≤b ∃d ≤c µ∗
d( ˙A) ≥q.
Let q < r; we claim that µ∗
b( ˙A) ≥q. If a ≤b, then ∀c ≤a ∃d ≤c such that
µ∗
d( ˙A) ≥q and hence (by a variant of (22.9)), µa( ˙A) ≥q. Thus µ∗
b( ˙A) ≥q.
Since this holds for any q < r, we have µ∗
b( ˙A) ≥r.
Next we show that µ is ﬁnitely additive. Let ˙A, ˙A1, and ˙A2 be such that
every condition forces that ˙A is the disjoint union of ˙A1 and ˙A2. If r1 and r2
are real numbers and if b ⊩( ˙µ( ˙A1) ≥ˇr1 and µ( ˙A2) ≥ˇr2), then by (22.13)
and (22.11), b ⊩˙µ( ˙A) ≥ˇr1 + ˇr2; hence µ(A) ≥µ(A1) + µ(A2). Conversely,
let us assume that µ(A) > µ(A1) + µ(A2). There are reals r1, r2 ∈M and
b ∈G such that
b ⊩˙µ( ˙A1) < ˇr1, ˙µ( ˙A2) < ˇr2, and ˙µ( ˙A) ≥ˇr1 + ˇr2.
Since b ⊩˙µ( ˙A1) < ˇr1, there is for each c ≤b some d ≤c such that
µd( ˙A1) < r1; hence by (22.9), µb( ˙A1) < r1. Similarly, µb( ˙A2) < r2, and so
µ∗
b( ˙A) ≤µb( ˙A) < r1 + r2. This is a contradiction.
Now when we know that µ is ﬁnitely additive, it suﬃces to show that
µ(
ξ<γ Aξ) ≤
ξ<γ µ(Aξ) for any family {Aξ : ξ < γ} of fewer than κ
subsets of κ. Thus let γ < κ and let ˙Aξ, ξ < γ, and ˙A be such that ∥˙A =

ξ<γ ˙Aξ∥= 1, and let us assume that µ(A) > 
ξ<γ µ(Aξ). Then there exist
r ∈M and b ∈G such that
b ⊩
ξ<γ
˙µ( ˙Aξ) < ˇr and ˙µ( ˙A) > ˇr.
Let E ⊂γ be an arbitrary ﬁnite set, let AE = 
ξ∈E Aξ. Since ∥˙µ( ˙AE) ≤

ξ∈E ˙µ( ˙Aξ)∥= 1, we have b ⊩˙µ( ˙AE) < ˇr. By (22.9), we get µb( ˙AE) < r.
Since µb( ˙AE) < r for all ﬁnite E ⊂γ, it follows from (22.8) that
µb( ˙A) ≤r. Hence µ∗
b( ˙A) ≤r, a contradiction.
This completes the proof that in M[G] µ is a nontrivial κ-additive measure
on κ.

22. Saturated Ideals

Example 22.10 (A model in which 2ℵ0 carries a σ-saturated ideal).
Let κ be a measurable cardinal, and let λ ≥κ be a cardinal such that λℵ0 = λ.
We shall construct a generic extension that satisﬁes 2ℵ0 = λ and such that
there is a σ-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ.
Let P be the notion of forcing that adjoins λ Cohen reals; i.e., a condition
is a ﬁnite 0–1 function p with dom(p) ⊂λ. If G is a generic ﬁlter on P, then
V [G] ⊨2ℵ0 = λ, and all cardinals are preserved in V [G] because P satisﬁes
the countable chain condition. That κ carries in V [G] a σ-saturated ideal
follows from this lemma:
Lemma 22.11. Let κ be a measurable cardinal and let I be a nonprincipal
κ-complete prime ideal on κ. Let P be a notion of forcing that satisﬁes the
countable chain condition. Then in V [G], the ideal J generated by I is a σ-
saturated κ-complete ideal on κ.
Proof. Let J be the ideal in V [G] deﬁned as follows:
X ∈J
if and only if
X ⊂Y for some Y ∈I.
First we show that J is κ-complete. Let X = {Xξ : ξ < γ} be a family of
fewer than κ elements of J; let
˙X be a name for X and let p0 ∈G be such
that p0 ⊩∀ξ < γ ˙Xξ ∈˙J.
For each ξ < γ and each p ≤p0, there exist q ≤p and some Y ∈I
such that q ⊩˙Xξ ⊂ˇY . Let Wξ be a maximal antichain of q ≤p0 for which
there is Yξ,q such that q ⊩˙Xξ ⊂ˇYξ,q. Since P satisﬁes the countable chain
condition, each Wξ is countable, and hence Y = {Yξ,q : ξ < γ and q ∈Wξ}
belongs to I. Now it is easy to verify that p0 ⊩
ξ<γ ˙Xξ ⊂ˇY and hence
 X ∈J.
To prove that J is countably saturated, let us assume that X = {Xξ :
ξ < ω1} is a family of pairwise disjoint sets of positive J-measure. Let ˙X be
a name for X and let p ∈G be such that p ⊩˙Xξ /∈˙J, for each ξ < ω1, and
p ⊩˙Xξ ∩˙Xη = ∅for all ξ ̸= η.
For each ξ < ω1, let Yξ = {α < κ : some q ≤p forces α ∈˙Xξ}. Clearly
p ⊩
˙Xξ ⊂ˇYξ, and so Yξ /∈I. By the κ-completeness of I, we have Y =

ξ<ω1 Yξ /∈I. Thus Y ̸= ∅, and let α be some element of Y . For each ξ < ω1,
let qξ ≤p be such that qξ ⊩α ∈˙Xξ. Since P satisﬁes the countable chain
condition, there are ξ, η such that qξ and qη are compatible. Let q be stronger
than both qξ and qη; then q ⊩α ∈˙Xξ ∩˙Xη, a contradiction.
⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 22.2. We shall prove that if 2ℵ0 carries a σ-saturated 2ℵ0-
complete ideal then 2λ = 2ℵ0 for all λ < 2ℵ0. Let λ be a regular cardinal; two
functions f, g on λ are almost disjoint if there is γ < λ such that f(α) ̸= g(α)
for all α ≥γ.
Lemma 22.12. Let κ carry a σ-saturated κ-complete ideal, and let λ < κ be
a regular uncountable cardinal. If F is a family of almost disjoint functions
f : λ →κ, then |F| ≤κ.

420
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Proof. If |F| > κ, then because every f : λ →κ is bounded by some β < κ,
there exist some G ⊂F and some β < κ such that |G| = κ and every f ∈G
is bounded by β.
Let F : [G]2 →λ be the following partition: F({f, g}) = some γ such that
f(α) ̸= g(α) for all α ≥γ. By Lemma 22.7, there exists H ⊂G of size κ
such that the image A of [H]2 under F is at most countable. Let α > sup(A).
Then f(α) ̸= g(α) whenever f, g ∈H, which is a contradiction since |H| = κ
and f(α) < β for all f ∈H.
⊓⊔
Now we are ready to prove the theorem. Let κ = 2ℵ0. We prove 2λ = κ
by induction on λ < κ. If λ is a singular cardinal and 2ν = κ for all ν < λ,
then 2λ = κ by Corollary 5.17. Thus let λ < κ be regular and let us assume
that 2ν = κ for all ν < λ.
For each X ⊂λ, let fX = ⟨X ∩α : α < λ⟩. If X ̸= Y , then fX and fY
are almost disjoint. For each α < λ, the set {fX(α) : X ⊂λ} has size κ, and
hence {fX : X ⊂λ} yields a family F of 2λ almost disjoint functions from λ
into κ. By Lemma 22.12 we get |F| ≤κ and therefore 2λ = κ.
⊓⊔
Generic Ultrapowers
We shall now introduce a powerful method for dealing with ideals on regu-
lar uncountable cardinals. The method is a generalization of the method of
ultrapowers from Chapter 10.
Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal and let I be an ideal on κ. Let
us view the universe as a ground model, let us denote this ground model M
and let us consider the generic extension of M given by the completion of
the Boolean algebra P(κ)/I. In other words, consider the notion of forcing
(P, ⊂), where P is the collection of all subsets of κ of positive measure:
(i) X ∈P if and only if X /∈I;
(ii) X is stronger than Y if and only if X ⊂Y
(22.15)
Let G be a generic ﬁlter on P.
Lemma 22.13.
(i) G is an M-ultraﬁlter on κ extending the ﬁlter dual to I.
(ii) If I is κ-complete in M, then G is a κ-complete M-ultraﬁlter.
(iii) If I is normal, then G is normal.
Proof. (i) If X ⊂κ has measure one, then {Y ∈P : Y ⊂X} is dense in P
and hence X ∈G. That G is an M-ultraﬁlter is obvious.
(ii) If {Xα : α < γ}, γ < κ, is (in M) a partition of κ, then by the κ-
completeness of I, the set {Y ∈P : Y ⊂some Xα} is dense in P and hence
Xα ∈G for some α.

22. Saturated Ideals
421
(iii) If X ∈G and if f ∈M is a regressive function on X, then {Y ⊂X :
f is constant on Y } is dense below X, and hence f is constant on some
Y ∈G.
⊓⊔
From now on assume that I is a κ-complete ideal on κ containing all
singletons. Then G is a nonprincipal κ-complete M-ultraﬁlter on κ. Note
that if I is atomless, then G /∈M (if I is prime, then G is the dual of I and
so G ∈M).
Let us consider (in M[G]) the ultrapower UltG(M); let us call this ultra-
power a generic ultrapower. The generic ultrapower is a model of ZFC, but
is not necessarily well-founded. We have the analog of Lo´s’s Theorem, in this
form
(22.16)
UltG(M) ⊨ϕ([f1], . . . , [fn])
if and only if
{α : M ⊨ϕ(f1(α), . . . , fn(α))} ∈G
whenever f1, . . . , fn ∈M are functions deﬁned on a set X ∈G. In particu-
lar, we have an elementary embedding, the canonical embedding jG : M →
UltG(M), deﬁned by
jG(x) = [cx]
where cx is the constant function on κ with value x, and [cx] is its equivalence
class in the ultrapower.
Let us denote the generic ultrapower by N and jG = j. The ordinal
numbers of the model N form a linearly ordered class, not necessarily well-
ordered, but we shall show that (because I is κ-complete), OrdN has an
initial segment of order-type κ. If x ∈OrdN, let us call the order-type of x
the order-type of the set {y ∈OrdN : y <N x}. If the order-type of x is an
ordinal number, we take the liberty of identifying x with this ordinal.
Lemma 22.14.
(i) For every γ < κ, j(γ) = γ; hence OrdN has an initial segment of
order-type κ.
(ii) j(κ) ̸= κ.
(iii) If I is normal, then there exists x ∈OrdN such that x = κ; in fact
[d] = κ where d is the diagonal function d(α) = α.
Proof. G is κ-complete, nonprincipal, and if I is normal then G is normal.
⊓⊔
Let us mention again the fact that we already mentioned and that is fairly
easy to verify: If P is the notion of forcing (22.15) then B(P) = B(P(κ)/I);
the mapping X →[X] gives the natural correspondence.
To illustrate the method of generic ultrapowers we present two examples.
The ﬁrst is (a modiﬁcation of) Silver’s proof of Theorem 8.12; the other is
a theorem of Jech and Prikry.

422
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Example 22.15 (Proof of Silver’s Theorem 8.12). Let us consider this
typical special case: Let κ be a singular cardinal of coﬁnality ℵ1, and assume
that 2λ = λ+ for all λ < κ. We shall show that 2κ = κ+, using a generic
ultrapower.
Let I be the ideal of nonstationary subsets of ω1, let P be the correspond-
ing notion of forcing (i.e., forcing conditions are stationary sets) and let G be
a generic ﬁlter on P. Note that since |P| = 2ℵ1 < κ (in M), all cardinals ≥κ
remain cardinals in M[G].
Let us work in M[G]. G is a normal σ-complete M-ultraﬁlter on ωM
1 . Let
N = UltG(M) be the generic ultrapower and let j : M →N be the canonical
elementary embedding. N is not necessarily well-founded.
Let ⟨κα : α < ω1⟩be (in M) an increasing continuous sequence of cardi-
nals converging to κ. Let e be the cardinal number in N represented by the
function e(α) = κα. Let e+ denote the successor cardinal of e in N.
For each X ⊂κ in M let fX be the function on ωM
1
deﬁned by fX(α) =
X ∩κα. Clearly, each fX represents in N a subset of e. Moreover, if X ̸= Y ,
then fX and fY are almost disjoint and hence represent distinct subsets of e.
It follows that |P M(κ)| ≤|P N(e)|, where P N(e) denotes the collection of all
subsets of e in N.
Now N ⊨2e = e+ (because M ⊨2κα = κ+
α for all α), which means that
in the model N there is a one-to-one correspondence between the power set
of e and e+. It follows that there is a one-to-one correspondence between
P N(e) and the set ext(e+) = {x ∈OrdN : x <N e+}. Thus we have so far
|P M(κ)| ≤| ext(e+)|.
Next we observe that e = sup{j(κγ) : γ < ωM
1 }. This is because if f rep-
resents an ordinal less than e, then there is a set of limit ordinals X ∈G such
that f(α) < κα for all α ∈X; thus f(α) < κγ(α) for some γ(α) < α, and
by normality of G, there is γ such that [f] <N κγ. Now for each γ < ωM
1 ,
| ext(j(κγ))| ≤|(κℵ1
γ )M| < κ, and therefore | ext(e)| ≤κ.
If x <N e+, then there is in N a one-to-one mapping of x into e, and
therefore, | ext(x)| ≤| ext(e)| ≤κ. Thus ext(e+) is a linearly ordered set
whose each initial segment has size at most κ. Therefore | ext(e+)| ≤κ+, and
we have
|P M(κ)| ≤κ+.
We have argued so far in M[G]; in other words, we have proved that
|P M(κ)|M[G] ≤(κ+)M[G]. But since all cardinals ≥κ in M remain cardi-
nals in M[G], it is necessary that |P M(κ)|M ≤(κ+)M; in other words we
have proved that 2κ = κ+ (in M).
⊓⊔
Theorem 22.16. Let I be a σ-complete ideal on ω1. If 2ℵ0 < ℵω1 then
2ℵ1 ≤2ℵ0 · sat(I).
Corollary 22.17. If there exists an ℵ2-saturated ideal on ω1, then
(i) 2ℵ0 = ℵ1 implies 2ℵ1 = ℵ2;

22. Saturated Ideals
423
(ii) ℵ1 < 2ℵ0 < ℵω1 implies 2ℵ0 = 2ℵ1.
⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 22.16. Let 2ℵ0 = ℵγ < ℵω1 and let I be a σ-complete
λ-saturated ideal on ω1. We shall show that 2ℵ1 ≤ℵγ · λ.
Let P be the notion of forcing corresponding to I, and let G be generic
on P. Since sat(P) = sat(I) ≤λ, all cardinals ≥λ in M are cardinals
in M[G].
Let us work in M[G], and let N = UltG(M) and j = jG : M →N. For
each X ⊂ω1 in M let fX be the function on ωM
1
deﬁned by fX(α) = X ∩α.
Each fX represents in N a subset of the countable ordinal d represented by
the function d(α) = α; moreover, if X = Y , then fX and fY are almost
disjoint and hence [fX] ̸= [fY ]. It follows that |P M(ωM
1 )| ≤|P N(d)|. Let e
be the cardinal number in N such that N ⊨2ℵ0 = e (we recall that ωN = ω).
Since N ⊨|P(d)| = e, we have |P N(d)| = | ext(e)| and so
(22.17)
|P M(ωM
1 )| ≤| ext(e)|.
Next we shall compute the size of ext(e). Since M ⊨2ℵ0 = ℵγ and j :
M →N is elementary, we have e = j(ωγ). We shall now prove by induction
on γ < ωM
1
that
(22.18)
| ext(j(ωM
γ ))| ≤λ · |ωM
γ |.
Let us denote j(ωM
γ ) = eγ for all γ < ωM
1 . By Lemma 22.14, the ordinals
of N have an initial segment of order-type ωM
1 ; thus the inﬁnite cardinals
of N also have an initial segment of order-type ωM
1 , namely {eγ : γ < ωM
1 }.
If γ = 0, then eγ = ω and (22.18) is true. If γ is a limit ordinal, then
eγ = sup{eδ : δ < γ} and (22.18) is again true provided it is true for all
δ < γ. If γ = 1, then ext(e1) is a linearly ordered set whose each initial
segment is countable, and hence | ext(e1)| ≤ℵ1. Since λ is a cardinal (now
we are in M[G]), we have ℵ1 ≤λ, and (22.18) holds.
Let us assume that (22.18) holds for γ and let us show that it also
holds for γ + 1. Every function f : ω1 →ωγ+1 in M is bounded by some
constant function, and therefore j(ωγ+1) = sup{j(ξ) : ξ < ωγ+1}. Hence
the linearly ordered set ext(eγ+1) has a coﬁnal set of order-type ωM
γ+1 and
each its initial segment has size ≤λ · |ωM
γ | (because if ξ < ωγ+1, then
| ext(j(ξ))| ≤| ext(eγ)| ≤λ · |ωM
γ |). It follows that | ext(eγ+1)| ≤λ · |ωM
γ+1|.
Now we put (22.17) and (22.18) together and get
|P M(ωM
1 )| ≤λ · ℵM
γ .
This we proved in M[G]; but since all cardinals ≥λ in M remains cardinals
in M[G], the same must be true in M. Hence (in M)
2ℵ1 ≤λ · ℵγ.

Precipitous Ideals
In an early application of generic ultrapowers, Solovay proved that if I is
κ+-saturated then the generic ultrapower is well-founded (see Lemma 22.22
in the next section). It has been recognized that this property of ideals is
important enough to single out and study such ideals.
Deﬁnition 22.18. A κ-complete ideal on κ is precipitous if the generic ul-
trapower UltG(M) is well-founded.
We give below several necessary and suﬃcient (combinatorial) conditions
on I to be precipitous.
Let I be a κ-complete ideal on κ containing all singletons. Let S be a set
of positive measure. An I-partition of S is a maximal family W of subsets
of S of positive measure such that X ∩Y ∈I for any distinct X, Y ∈W. An
I-partition W1 of S is a reﬁnement of an I-partition W2 of S, W1 ≤W2, if
every X ∈W1 is a subset of some Y ∈W2. A functional on S is a collection F
of functions such that WF = {dom(f) : f ∈F} is an I-partition of S and
dom(f) ̸= dom(g) whenever f ̸= g ∈F.
We deﬁne F < G for two functionals on S to mean that:
(i) each f ∈F ∪G is a function into the ordinals;
(ii) WF ≤WG; and
(iii) if f ∈F and g ∈G are such that dom(f) ⊂dom(g), then f(α) < g(α)
for all α ∈dom(f).
The reason we deﬁne functionals is that they represent functions in the
Boolean-valued model M B (and so are canonical representatives for elements
of UltG(M)): Let ˙f ∈M B be such that
(22.19)
S ⊩˙f is a function with dom( ˙f) ∈˙G and ˙f ∈M.
Then there is an I-partition W of S, and for each X ∈W a function fX on X
such that for all X ∈W, X ⊩˙f↾ˇX = ˇfX. Thus the functional {fX : X ∈W}
represents the Boolean-valued ˙f on S.
Conversely, if F is functional on S, then there is some ˙f ∈M B such that
(22.19) holds; and for each f ∈F, if X = dom(f), then X ⊩˙f↾ˇX = ˇf.
Note also that if F < G are functionals on S and ˙f, ˙g are corresponding
Boolean-valued names, then
(22.20)
S ⊩˙f, ˙g ∈M and dom( ˙f) ⊂dom ˙g and ˙f(α) < ˙g(α) for all α ∈
dom( ˙f).
Conversely, if ˙f and ˙g satisfy (22.20), then there are functionals F and G
that represent ˙f and ˙g, and F < G.
Lemma 22.19. The following are equivalent:

22. Saturated Ideals
425
(i) I is precipitous.
(ii) Whenever S is a set of positive measure and {Wn : n < ω} are I-
partitions of S such that W0 ≥W1 ≥. . . ≥Wn ≥. . ., then there exists
a sequence of sets X0 ⊃X1 ⊃. . . ⊃Xn ⊃. . . such that Xn ∈Wn for
each n, and ∞
n=0 Xn is nonempty.
(iii) For no set S of positive measure is there a sequence of functionals
on S such that F0 > F1 > . . . > Fn > . . ..
Proof. In view of the preceding discussion on functionals, (ii) is equivalent
to (i): If F0 > F1 > . . . are functionals on S, and ˙f0, ˙f1, . . . , the corresponding
elements of M B, then S forces that [ ˙f0], [ ˙f1], . . . is a descending sequence of
ordinals in the generic ultrapower. Conversely, if S forces that UltG(M) has
a descending sequence of ordinals, we construct F0, F1, . . . on S such that
F0 > F1 > . . ..
The implication (ii) →(iii) is easy. If F0 > F1 > . . . are functionals
on S, then the partitions WF0, WF1, . . . constitute a counterexample: If
X0 ⊃X1 ⊃. . . are elements of WF0, WF1, . . . , let f0 ∈F0 be the function with
domain X0, f1 ∈F1 with domain X1, etc.; now if ∞
n=0 Xn were nonempty,
we would get f0(α) > f1(α) > . . . for α ∈∞
n=0 Xn.
To show (iii) →(ii), let W0 ≥W1 ≥. . . be partitions of some S /∈I that
fail (ii). We shall construct functionals on S such that F0 > F1 > . . ..
Without loss of generality, let us assume that if X ∈Wn+1, Y ∈Wn, and
X ⊂Y , then X ̸= Y . Let T = ∞
n=0 Wn; note that the partially ordered set
(T, ⊂) is an upside-down tree (of height ω).
For each z ∈S, let us consider the set Tz = {X ∈T : z ∈X}. Since every
descending sequence X0 ⊃X1 ⊃. . . in T has empty intersection, it follows
that for every z, Tz has no inﬁnite descending sequence X0 ⊃X1 ⊃. . .;
hence the relation ⊂on Tz is well-founded. Thus there is, for each z, an
ordinal function ρz on T (the rank function) such that ρz(X) < ρz(Y ) when
X ⊂Y . It is clear that if X ∈Wn+1, Y ∈Wn, and z ∈X ⊂Y , then
ρz(X) < ρz(Y ).
Thus we deﬁne, for each X ∈T , a function fX on X as follows:
fX(z) = ρz(X)
(all z ∈X).
Now it is clear that if we let Fn = {fX : X ∈Wn} for each n, then F0, F1, . . .
are functionals on S and F0 > F1 > . . ..
⊓⊔
Lemma 22.20. Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal. The ideal I =
{X ⊂κ : |X| < κ} is not precipitous.
Proof. Let I = {X ⊂κ : |X| < κ}. A set X ⊂κ has positive measure just
in case |X| = κ. For each such X, let fX be the unique order-preserving
function from X onto κ.
For each set X of positive measure there exists a set Y ⊂X of positive
measure such that fY (α) < fX(α) for all α ∈Y ; namely if we let Y =

426
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
{α ∈X : fX(α) is a successor ordinal}, then fX(α) = fY (α) + 1 for all
α ∈Y . Thus for each X /∈I there is an I-partition WX of X such that for
all Y ∈WX, fY (α) < fX(α) on Y .
Now we construct I-partitions W0 ≥W1 ≥. . . as follows: We let W0 =
{κ}, and for each n, we let Wn+1 = {WX : X ∈Wn}. For each n, we let
Fn be the functional Fn = {fX : X ∈Wn}. It is clear that F0 > F1 > . . . >
Fn > . . ., and therefore I is not precipitous.
⊓⊔
An alternate characterization of precipitousness is in terms of inﬁnite
games. GI is the inﬁnite game played by two players, Empty and Nonempty,
who alternately choose sets Sn of positive I-measure such that Sn+1 ⊂Sn.
Empty plays ﬁrst and wins if ∞
n=0 Sn = ∅.
Lemma 22.21. I is precipitous if and only if Empty has no winning strategy
in the game GI.
Proof. If I is not precipitous then there is a set S of positive measure and
a sequence of functionals on S such that F0 > F1 > . . . > Fn > . . .. Empty
chooses S0 = S for his ﬁrst move. When Nonempty plays S2n−1, Empty ﬁnds
some f ∈Fn such that the set X = dom(f)∩S2n−1 has positive measure and
chooses S2n = X for his move. It follows that ∞
n=0 Sn is empty, and hence
Empty wins.
Now suppose that I is precipitous and σ is a strategy for Empty; we will
show that σ is not a winning strategy. Let S0 be Empty’s ﬁrst move by σ.
Then S0 forces that in M[G] there is an inﬁnite sequence ⟨Sn : n ∈ω⟩of
moves in which Empty follows σ and each Sn ∈G. If j : M →UltG(M) is
the canonical embedding then ⟨j(Sn) : n ∈ω⟩is an inﬁnite sequence of moves
(of j(GI)) in which Empty follows j(σ) and κ ∈∞
n=0 j(Sn). Since UltG(M) is
well-founded, there exists (by absoluteness) such a sequence in UltG(M), and
since j is elementary, there exists a sequence ⟨Sn : n ∈ω⟩in M in which
Empty follows σ but for some α < κ, α ∈∞
n=0 Sn. Thus σ is not a winning
strategy.
⊓⊔
Saturated Ideals
Results from Chapter 10 and those proved earlier in this chapter establish the
following facts about the existence of a σ-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ:
If κ carries a σ-saturated κ-complete ideal then either κ is measurable, or
κ ≤2ℵ0 and κ is weakly inaccessible (Lemma 10.9 and 10.14). If a σ-saturated
ideal exists then there exists a normal one (Lemma 22.3), and its consistency
strength is that of a measurable cardinal (Lemma 22.8). These results gener-
alize easily to ν-saturated ideals for ν < κ; the analog of Lemma 10.9 (with
the same proof) is that either κ is measurable, or κ ≤2<ν.
In this section we investigate κ-saturated and κ+-saturated ideals. We
shall employ the technique of generic ultrapowers; this is particularly useful
because the generic ultrapower is well-founded:

Lemma 22.22. Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal. Every κ+-saturated
κ-complete ideal on κ is precipitous.
Proof. Let I be a κ+-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ. Let S be a set of
positive measure and let W0 ≥W1 ≥. . . be I-partitions of S. We shall ﬁnd
X0 ⊃X1 ⊃. . . in W0, W1, . . . such that ∞
n=0 Xn is nonempty.
We shall ﬁrst modify each Wn to obtain a new I-partition W ′
n that is
almost like Wn but is disjoint. We proceed by induction on n. Since |W0| ≤κ,
let W0 = {Xα : α < θ} where θ ≤κ, and for each α < θ, let X′
α =
Xα −
β<α Xβ; then we let W ′
0 = {X′ : X ∈W}. Since I is κ-complete,
we have X −X′ ∈I for all X ∈W0 and thus W ′
0 is an I-partition of S;
moreover, W ′
0 is disjoint, and is a partition of S0 =  W ′
0 and S −S0 ∈I.
Having constructed W ′
n, we enumerate Wn+1 = {Xα : α < θ} where θ ≤κ,
and for each α < θ, let X′
α = (Xα −
β<α Xβ) ∩Z where Z is the unique
Z ∈W ′
n that is almost all of the unique Y ∈Wn such that Xα ⊂Y .
We let W ′
n+1 = {X′ : X ∈Wn+1}; W ′
n is a partition of Sn+1 =  W ′
n+1,
S −Sn+1 ∈I, and X −X′ ∈I for all X ∈Wn+1.
Since each Sn is almost all of S, the set ∞
n=0 Sn is nonempty; let z be an
element of this intersection. For each n there is a unique Yn ∈W ′
n such that
z ∈Yn; let Xn be the unique Xn ∈Wn such that Yn ⊂Xn. It is clear that
X0 ⊃X1 ⊃. . . ⊃Xn ⊃. . ., and ∞
n=0 Xn ̸= ∅.
⊓⊔
In the next section we shall generalize Lemma 22.8: We shall prove that
if κ carries a precipitous ideal then it is measurable in an inner model.
Let us ﬁrst consider κ-saturated ideals. First we observe that the proof
of Lemmas 22.3(i) and 22.4 works as well when I is only κ-saturated, and so
we have:
Lemma 22.23.
(i) If there exists a κ-saturated κ-complete ideal on an uncountable car-
dinal κ, then there exists a normal κ-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ.
(ii) Let I be a normal κ-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ. If S /∈I and if
f : S →κ is regressive on S, then there is γ < κ such that f(α) < γ
for almost all α ∈S.
⊓⊔
Also, the proof of Lemma 10.14 works also for κ-saturated ideals, and so
we have:
Lemma 22.24. If κ carries a κ-saturated κ-complete ideal then κ is weakly
inaccessible.
⊓⊔
It is consistent (relative to the existence of a measurable cardinal) that
an inaccessible cardinal κ carries an ideal I such that sat(I) = κ. (Such κ
cannot be weakly compact, see Exercise 22.13.)
We shall now prove the main result on κ-saturated ideals, using generic
ultrapowers. First we need a lemma on preservation of stationary sets by
forcing:

428
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Lemma 22.25. Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal. Let V [G] be a generic
extension of V by a κ-c.c. notion of forcing. Then every closed unbounded
C ⊂κ in V [G] has a closed unbounded subset D ∈V . Consequently, if S ∈V
is stationary in V , then S remains stationary in V [G].
Proof. Let ˙C be a name such that every condition forces that ˙C is a closed
unbounded subset of κ. Let D = {α : ∥α ∈˙C∥= 1}. Clearly, D is a subset
of C and is closed; we have to prove only that D is unbounded.
Let α0 < κ; we wish to ﬁnd α > α0 such that every condition forces α ∈˙C.
For every p, there is q ≤p and some β > α0 such that q ⊩β ∈˙C. Thus there
is a maximal incompatible set W of conditions, and for each q ∈W an ordinal
β = βq such that q ⊩β ∈˙C. Since |W| < κ, we let α1 = sup{βq : q ∈W};
we have α1 < κ and
p ⊩(∃β ∈˙C) α0 < β ≤α1
for all conditions p. Similarly, we ﬁnd α1 < α2 < α3 < . . . such that for
every n and every condition p,
p ⊩(∃β ∈˙C) αn < β ≤αn+1.
If we let α = limn αn, it is clear that ∥α ∈˙C∥= 1.
⊓⊔
Theorem 22.26 (Solovay). Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal and
assume that κ carries a κ-saturated ideal.
(i) κ is weakly Mahlo;
(ii) {α < κ : α is weakly Mahlo} is stationary;
(iii) if X ⊂κ has measure one in a normal κ-saturated ideal, then X ∩
M(X) has measure one, where
M(X) = {α < κ : cf α > ω and X ∩α is stationary in α}.
Proof. If there exists a κ-saturated ideal on κ, then κ is weakly inaccessi-
ble by Lemma 22.24, and there exists a normal κ-saturated ideal on κ (by
Lemma 22.23). Let I be a normal κ-saturated ideal on κ. We ﬁrst prove:
Lemma 22.27. If S ⊂κ is stationary, then for I-almost all α < κ, S ∩α is
stationary in α.
Proof. If not, then there is a set X of positive measure such that S ∩α is not
stationary in α (or cf α = ω) for all α ∈X. Let G be a generic ultraﬁlter on κ
(corresponding to I) such that X ∈G. Let N = UltG(M). N is a transitive
model. Since I is normal, κ is represented in N by the function d(α) = α.
Since S = j(S) ∩κ, we have N ⊨S is not stationary.
However, the notion of forcing is κ-saturated and hence κ is a regular
cardinal in M[G], and by Lemma 22.25, M[G] ⊨S is stationary. Now N ⊂
M[G] and so N ⊨S is stationary. A contradiction.
⊓⊔

22. Saturated Ideals
429
Since I is normal, every set of positive measure is stationary. Thus (iii) fol-
lows since if X has measure one then M(X) has measure one by Lemma 22.27,
and so does X ∩M(X).
To prove (i), it suﬃces to show that almost all α < κ are regular cardinals.
Otherwise, let X be a set of positive measure such that all α ∈X are singular.
Let G ∋X be generic and let N = UltG(M). Then N ⊨κ is singular, contrary
to the fact that κ is regular in M[G] and N ⊂M[G].
Now (ii) follows by an application of (iii): Let X = {α < κ : α is regular},
then X ∩M(X) = {α < κ : α is weakly Mahlo}.
⊓⊔
As a corollary of Theorem 22.26 we have Solovay’s original proof of The-
orem 8.10:
Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal and let S be a stationary subset
of κ. We claim that S is the disjoint union of κ stationary subsets.
Otherwise, the ideal I = {X ⊂κ : X ∩S is nonstationary} is a normal
κ-saturated ideal. By Lemma 22.27, S −M(S) has measure zero and hence
is nonstationary, which contradicts Lemma 8.9.
⊓⊔
Now let us consider κ+-saturated ideals.
Lemma 22.28. Let I be a κ+-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ.
(i) There exists a least unbounded function, i.e., a function f : κ →κ such
that for any γ < κ there is no S of positive measure such that f(α) < γ
on S (unbounded) and that for any g : κ →κ, if g(α) < f(α) on a set
of positive measure then g is constant on a set of positive measure.
(ii) There exists a normal κ+-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ.
Proof. By Lemma 22.22 I is precipitous. Since I is κ+-saturated, the Boolean-
valued names for functions on κ in the ground model can be represented
not by functionals but by ordinary functions: Let F be a functional (on κ).
Let W = {dom(f) : f ∈F}; since I is κ+-saturated, W can be replaced
by a disjoint W ′ such that for each X ∈W there is X′ ∈W ′ such that
X′ ⊂X and X −X′ ∈I. If we replace each f ∈F by its restriction to
the corresponding X′ ∈W ′, we get a functional F ′ whose elements have
disjoint domains. Then f =  F ′ is a function, and if ˙f ∈V B is the name
corresponding to F, then ∥˙f = ˇf∥= 1.
Let ˙f ∈V B be such that ∥˙f represents ˇκ in the generic ultrapower∥= 1
and let f : κ →κ be such that ∥˙f = ˇf∥= 1. Then f is the least unbounded
function.
If f is the least unbounded function then f∗(I) = {X ⊂κ : f−1(X) ∈I}
is a normal κ-complete ideal and is κ+-saturated.
⊓⊔
Unlike κ-saturation, the existence of a κ+-saturated ideal on κ does not
imply that κ be a limit cardinal. However, the consistency strength of a κ+-
saturated ideal on a successor cardinal κ is considerably stronger than mea-
surability (while the existence of an ideal I on an inaccessible κ such that

430
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
sat(I) = κ+ is equiconsistent with measurability). It is consistent, relative
to a Woodin cardinal, that the nonstationary ideal on ℵ1 is ℵ2-saturated; we
shall study this problem in Part III. We shall also return to the subject of
saturation of the nonstationary ideal in general in Chapter 23.
Saturated ideals have inﬂuence on cardinal arithmetic, similar to measur-
able cardinals:
Lemma 22.29. Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal and let I be a κ+-
saturated ideal on κ. If 2λ = λ+ for all λ < κ, then 2κ = κ+.
Proof. Let M be the ground model. Let P be the notion of forcing corre-
sponding to I, let G be generic on P, and let N = UltG(M). Since I is
κ+-saturated, N is well-founded and hence we identify it with a transitive
model N ⊂M[G]. Let j : M →N be the canonical embedding. We have
j(γ) = γ for all γ < κ, and j(κ) > κ. If X ⊂κ and X ∈M, then X ∈N
because X = j(X) ∩κ. Thus P M(κ) ⊂P N(κ).
We assume that M ⊨(2λ = λ+ for all λ < κ) and hence N ⊨(2λ = λ+ for
all λ < j(κ)), and in particular, N ⊨|P(κ)| = κ+, where α+ denotes the least
cardinal greater than α. Now (κ+)N ≤(κ+)M[G]; and because sat(P) = κ+
(in M), (κ+)M is a cardinal in M[G] and we have also (κ+)M[G] = (κ+)M.
Thus we have, in M[G],
|P M(κ)| ≤(κ+)M
and since all cardinals above κ+ in M are preserved, the last formula is also
true in M, and we have 2κ = κ+.
⊓⊔
Lemma 22.30. Let I be an ℵ2-saturated ideal on ω1. Then
(i) If 2ℵ0 = ℵ1, then 2ℵ1 = ℵ2.
(ii) If ℵ1 < 2ℵ0 < ℵω1, then 2ℵ1 = 2ℵ0.
(iii) If 2ℵ0 = ℵω1, then 2ℵ1 ≤ℵω2.
(iv) If ℵω1 is strong limit, then 2ℵω1 < ℵω2.
(v) Let Φ(α) denote the αth member of the class {κ : ℵκ = κ}. If Φ(ω1) is
strong limit, then 2Φ(ω1) < Φ(ω2).
Proof. (i) and (ii) are as in Corollary 22.17.
Let G be a generic ultraﬁlter on ω1, let N = UltG(M) and let j : M →N.
N is a transitive model, N ⊂M[G].
Let us denote κ = ωM
1 . We have j(γ) = γ for all γ < κ, and j(κ) > κ.
Thus κ is a countable ordinal in N. Moreover, every f : κ →Ord in M
belongs to N, and so every γ < ωM
2
is countable in N. Since sat(I) = ℵ2,
ωM
2
is a cardinal in M[G], hence in N, and so
j(ωM
1 ) = ωM
2 .
We shall now prove (iii), (iv), and (v). To prove (iii), let us assume that
M ⊨2ℵ0 = ℵω1. Since N ⊨|ωM
1 | = ℵ0, and j is elementary, we have M[G] ⊨

22. Saturated Ideals
431
|P M(κ)| ≤(2ℵ0)N and N ⊨2ℵ0 = ℵj(κ). Now ℵN
j(κ) ≤ℵM[G]
j(κ) ; and since
j(κ) = ωM
2 , ℵM[G]
j(κ) is the ωM
2 th cardinal in M[G]. However, all cardinals ≥ℵM
2
are preserved and hence ℵM[G]
j(κ) = ℵM
ω2. Thus
|P M(ωM
1 )| ≤ℵM
ω2
holds in M[G]; and because cardinals above ℵ2 are preserved, this also holds
in M.
To prove (iv) or (v), note that if ℵω1 (or Φ(ω1)) is strong limit, then
2ℵω1 = ℵℵ1
ω1 (2Φ(ω1) = (Φ(ω1))ℵ1). Let λ denote ℵω1 in (iv) and Φ(ω1) in (v).
It is easy to see that j(λ) > λ. Now N ⊨∀α < j(λ) |ακ| < j(λ), and because
(λκ)M ⊂(λκ)N, we have M[G] ⊨|(λκ)M| ≤j(λ).
In case (iv) we have j(λ) ≤ℵM
ω2 as in (iii); and in case (v) we obtain
similarly j(λ) ≤Φ(j(κ)) ≤Φ(ω2). The rest of the proof of either (iv) or (v)
is as before.
⊓⊔
To conclude this section we prove a generalization of Lemma 22.11; we
show in Lemma 22.32 that for all λ ≤κ+, if V [G] is a generic extension by
λ-saturated forcing, then a λ-saturated ideal in V generates a λ-saturated
ideal in V [G].
Lemma 22.31. Let I be a κ+-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ. Let G be
a corresponding generic ultraﬁlter and let N = UltG(M) be the generic ultra-
power. Then every s : κ →M in M[G] is in N.
Proof. Let ˙s be a name for s; for each α < κ, let ˙sα be a name such that
∥˙s(α) = ˙sα∥= 1. Each ˙sα is represented by a function fα ∈M on κ. Let
h : κ →κ be the least unbounded function. Let f be the function on κ
deﬁned by f(α) = ⟨fβ(α) : β < h(α)⟩. Then f represents ˙s in the generic
ultrapower.
⊓⊔
Lemma 22.32. Let B be a complete Boolean algebra, let G be a V -generic
ultraﬁlter on B and let κ be an uncountable regular cardinal. Let λ ≤κ+ be
regular and assume that sat(B) ≤λ and sat(B) < κ. If I is a λ-saturated
κ-complete ideal on κ, then in V [G], I generates a λ-saturated κ-complete
ideal.
Proof. Let J ∈V [G] be the ideal generated by I. Since sat B ≤κ, J is κ-
complete. Let ˙J ∈V B be the canonical name for J, and let ˙C ∈V B be the
Boolean algebra ˙C = P(ˇκ)/ ˙J.
We want to show that V B ⊨˙C is ˇλ-saturated; by Lemma 16.5 it suﬃces
to show that B ∗˙C is λ-saturated because B is λ-saturated. Let D = P(κ)/I.
We shall ﬁnd in V D a Boolean algebra ˙E such that V D ⊨˙E is ˇλ-saturated,
and such that D ∗˙E is isomorphic to B ∗˙C. Since D is λ-saturated, it will
follow that D ∗˙E is λ-saturated and we shall be done.
In V D, consider the generic ultrapower N = Ult ˙G(V ), where ˙G is the
canonical ultraﬁlter on ˇD. Let j : V →N be the corresponding elementary
embedding. Let ˙E = j(B).

432
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Let sat(B) = ν < κ. Since j is elementary, we have N ⊨sat(j( ˇB)) = j(ν);
and since j(ν) = ν and by Lemma 22.31 all ν-sequences in V D are in N, we
have V D ⊨sat( ˙E) = ν. Thus V D ⊨˙E is λ-saturated.
It remains to show that B ∗˙C and D ∗˙E are isomorphic. Let ˙c ∈B ∗˙C.
Then ˙c ∈V B and ∥˙c ∈˙C∥B = 1. Thus there is some
˙X ∈V B such that
∥˙X ⊂κ∥B = 1 and that
∥˙c is the equivalence class of ˙X mod ˙J∥B = 1.
Let f : κ →B be the function f(α) = ∥α ∈
˙X∥. Since f(α) ∈B for all
α < κ, f represents in N = UltG(B) ⊂V D an element ˙e ∈j( ˇB) = ˙E; and
˙e ∈D ∗˙E. We let h(˙c) = ˙e.
The proof is completed by verifying that the deﬁnition of h(˙c) does not
depend on the choice of ˙X and that h is an isomorphism.
⊓⊔
Consistency Strength of Precipitousness
Theorem 22.33.
(i) If κ is a regular uncountable cardinal that carries a precipitous ideal,
then κ is measurable in an inner model of ZFC.
(ii) If κ is a measurable cardinal, then there exists a generic extension in
which κ = ℵ1, and κ carries a precipitous ideal.
The proof of (i) uses the technique of iterated ultrapowers (compare with
(20.5)–(20.8)).
Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal, and let I be a precipitous ideal
on κ. Let C be the class of all strong limit cardinals ν > 2κ such that
cf ν ≥sat(I). Let γ0 < γ1 < . . . < γn < . . . (n < ω), be elements of C such
that |γn ∩C| = γn, let A = {γn : n = 0, 1, . . .} and let λ = sup(A).
Lemma 22.34. There exists an L[A]-ultraﬁlter W on κ such that W is
nonprincipal, κ-complete normal and iterable, and every iterated ultrapower
Ult(α)
W (L[A]) is well-founded.
Proof. Since I is precipitous, the generic ultrapower is well-founded, and so
the diagonal function d(α) = α represents some ordinal number in UltG(V ).
Thus there is a set S of positive measure, and an ordinal γ such that
(22.21)
S ⊩ˇd represents ˇγ in UltG(V ).
We shall ﬁrst show that for every X ∈L[A], X ⊂κ, either S ∩X or S −X
has measure 0, and so
(22.22)
U = {X ∈P(κ) ∩L[A] : X ∩S has positive measure}
is an L[A]-ultraﬁlter.

22. Saturated Ideals
433
Let H = HL[A](κ ∪C ∪{A}) be the class of all sets deﬁnable in L[A]
from elements of κ ∪C ∪{A} (this is expressible in ZF similarly to the way
in which ordinal deﬁnability is; or we can use Lθ[A] for some large θ). Since
|C ∩γn| = γn for each n, it follows that if π is the transitive collapse of H,
then π(A) = A and π(H) = L[A]. Now if X ⊂κ and X ∈L[A], then
because π is the identity on κ, we have X = π(Y ) = Y ∩κ for some Y ∈H,
and Y = {ξ : L[A] ⊨ϕ(ξ, E, A)}. Thus for every X ∈P(κ) ∩L[A] there is
a formula ϕ and a ﬁnite set E ⊂κ ∪K such that
(22.23)
X = {ξ < κ : L[A] ⊨ϕ(ξ, E, A)}.
We shall now show that (22.22) deﬁnes an L[A]-ultraﬁlter. Recall that
for any generic ultraﬁlter G on κ, jG is the identity on κ, and moreover,
jG(ν) = ν for all ν ∈C (this follows from the deﬁnition of C).
If X ∈L[A], and X ∩S has positive measure, then because X ⊩ˇX ∈˙G
and because (22.21) holds, we have
X ∩S ⊩ˇγ ∈jG( ˙X).
Now using (22.23), and the fact that jG(A) = A and jG(E) = E, we have
(22.24)
X ∩S ⊩(L[ ˇA] ⊩ϕ(ˇγ, ˇE, ˇA)).
But the formula forced by X ∩S in (22.24) is about V , and thus true. Hence
∥ˇγ ∈jG( ˇX)∥= 1,
and by (22.21),
S ⊩ˇX ∈˙G.
This, however, means that S −X has measure 0.
Since I is κ-complete, it is clear that U is L[A]-κ-complete, and moreover
the intersection of any countable family of elements of U is nonempty. It is
less clear that U is iterable: Let ⟨Xα : α < κ⟩∈L[A]; it suﬃces to show
that S ⊩({α : Xα ∈U} ∈L[A]). If G is generic such that S ∈G, then
{α < κ : Xα ∈U} = {α < κ : γ ∈jG(Xα)}, but this is in L[A] because
jG(⟨Xα : α < κ⟩) ∈L[jG(A)] and jG(A) = A.
By Exercise 19.10, UltU(L[A]) is well-founded; let f : κ →κ be the
function that represents κ in UltU(L[A]). Let W = f∗(U).
It is easy to verify that W is a normal, L[A]-κ-complete, iterable L[A]-
ultraﬁlter on κ, and that the intersection of any countable family of elements
of W is nonempty. By Exercise 19.10, every iterated ultrapower Ult(α)
W (L[A])
is well-founded.
⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 22.33(i). Let A = {γn : n = 0, 1, . . . } be as above, let
λ = sup(A), and let W be an L[A]-ultraﬁlter as in Lemma 22.34. Let us
deﬁne in L[A]
(22.25)
F = {X ⊂λ : ∃n0 ∀n ≥n0 γn ∈X}

434
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
(compare with (20.6)). We claim that D = F ∩L[F] is a normal measure
on λ in L[D].
For each α, let i0,α : L[A] →Ult(α)
W (L[A]) be the canonical elementary
embedding. It follows from the deﬁnition of the class C that:
(22.26)
if α < γn, then i0,α(γn) = γn;
i0,γn(κ) = γn;
if α < λ, then i0,α(λ) = λ.
Hence for all α < λ, i0,α(L[A]) = L[A], i0,α(F) = F, and i0,α(D) = D.
We shall now prove that D is an ultraﬁlter in L[D]. Otherwise, let X ⊂λ
be the least X (in the canonical well-ordering of L[D]) such that X /∈D and
λ −X /∈D. Since i0,α(D) = D for all α < λ, we have i0,α(X) = X for all
α < λ; in particular, i0,γn(X) = X for all n. Now for any n, if γn ∈X, then
i0,γn(κ) ∈i0,γn(X) and hence κ ∈X, and vice versa. Hence either all γn are
in X or none, and so either X ∈F or λ −X ∈F, a contradiction.
The proof that D is λ-complete (in L[D]) and normal is similar and is
left to the reader.
Thus we have proved that there exists a D in L[A] such that
(22.27)
L[D] ⊨D is a normal measure on λ.
The proof will be complete if we ﬁnd a transitive model M and an elementary
embedding i : M →L[D] such that i(κ) = λ. Then κ is measurable in some
transitive model.
Let us recall that for each α, i0,α is the elementary embedding i0,α :
L[A] →Ult(α)
W (L[A]). As we have seen, if α < λ, then i0,α(λ) = λ and
i0,α(L[A]) = L[A]. Let C1 be a proper class of ordinals, greater than λ such
that i0,λ(ν) = ν for all ν ∈C1.
Let H = HL[D](κ ∪{λ} ∪C1) be the class of all sets deﬁnable in L[D]
from elements of κ ∪{λ} ∪C1. (As before, the problem of expressibility of H
in ZF can be overcome by replacing L[D] by a suitable large segment Lθ[D].)
H is an elementary submodel of L[D].
If α < λ, then i0,α(ν) = ν for all ν ∈κ ∪{λ} ∪C1; it follows that
i0,α(x) = x for all x ∈H. Observing that for every ν such that κ ≤ν < λ
there exists α < λ such that i0,α(ν) > ν, we conclude that H contains no
ordinal ν such that κ ≤ν < λ. Hence if π is the transitive collapse of H,
and M = π(H), then π(λ) = κ; thus i = π−1 is an elementary embedding of
some transitive model M into L[D], and i(κ) = λ.
⊓⊔
The proof of (ii) uses the notion of forcing which collapses all α < κ
onto ω and makes κ = ℵ1 (the L´evy collapse).
Proof of (ii). Let κ be a measurable cardinal. We shall show that if V [G] is
the generic extension by the L´evy collapse such that κ becomes ℵ1, then V [G]
has a precipitous ideal on ℵ1.

if p ⊃q. Let G be a V -generic ﬁlter on P. In V [G], κ is ℵ1.
Let D be a normal measure on κ, let M = UltD(V ) and let j : V →M be
the elementary embedding j = jD. In V [G], let I be the ideal on κ generated
by the dual of D; i.e.,
(22.28)
X ∈I
if and only if
X ∩Y = ∅for some Y ∈D.
A routine argument (using sat P = κ) shows that I is in V [G] a countably
complete ideal containing all singletons. It can be proved that I is precipitous;
instead, we shall prove a weaker (but suﬃcient) property, namely that there
exists an S ⊂ℵ1, S /∈I, such that I↾S = {X ⊂ℵ1 : X ∩S ∈I} is
a precipitous ideal.
For that, it suﬃces to show that there exists an S /∈I such that (when
forcing with sets X /∈I) S forces that the generic ultrapower is well-founded.
In turn, it suﬃces to construct an extension of V [G] in which there exists
a V [G]-ultraﬁlter W on κ, generic over V [G] (with respect to forcing with
sets X /∈I) such that the generic ultrapower UltW (V [G]) is well-founded.
For every ν, let Pν be the set of all p ∈P such that α < ν whenever
(α, n) ∈dom(p), and let P ν = {p ∈P : α ≥ν for all (α, n) ∈dom(p)}; P is
isomorphic to the product Pν × P ν.
Let us consider the notion of forcing j(P). Clearly, (j(P))κ = P, and thus
j(P) is isomorphic to P × Q where Q = (j(P))κ. Every q ∈Q is represented
in the ultrapower M by a function ⟨qα : α < κ⟩such that qα ∈P α for all
α < κ.
Let H be a V [G]-generic ﬁlter on Q; thus G × H is V -generic on P × Q.
As in Theorem 21.3 we deﬁne in V [G × H] a V [G]-ultraﬁlter W on κ as
follows:
(22.29)
X ∈W
if and only if
κ ∈(j( ˙X))G×H.
The deﬁnition (22.29) does not depend on the choice of the name ˙X because
p ∈G implies j(p) ∈G×H. Let ˙W be the canonical name for W. As in (21.8)
we have for any p ∈P, q ∈Q,
(22.30)
(p, q) ⊩˙X ∈˙W
if and only if
for almost all α, p ∪qα ⊩ˇα ∈˙X
(here ˙X is a P-valued name and ⟨qα : α < κ⟩represents q in M; “almost all”
refers to the normal measure D).

First we observe that the ultrapower UltW (V [G]) is well-founded. This is
because the following commutative diagram holds:
UltW (V [G])
V [G]
M[G × H]
j
k
jW
?
-


.
In the diagram, j is the extension of j : V →M deﬁned by
j(x) = (j( ˙x))G×H
and k is deﬁned as follows: If f ∈V [G] is a function on κ representing [f]
in UltW (V [G]), then
k([f]) = (j(f))(κ).
Both j and k are elementary and the diagram commutes.
It remains to show that W is V [G]-generic with respect to forcing with
sets X /∈I. It suﬃces to show that if X = {Xi : i < θ} is an I-partition of κ,
then Xi ∈W for some i. Let ˙X ∈V P be a name for X and let ˙Xi, i < θ, be
names for the Xi. Let us assume that there are conditions p ∈G and q ∈H
such that
p ⊩˙X is an ˙I-partition of ˇκ
and for each i < θ,
(p, q) ⊩˙Xi /∈˙W.
We shall derive a contradiction.
Let q be represented in M by ⟨qα : α < κ⟩. By (22.30) there is for each i
a set Ai ∈D such that for all α ∈Ai,
(22.31)
p ∪qα ⊩α /∈˙Xi.
Let us deﬁne (in V [G]),
(22.32)
T = {α < κ : qα ∈G}.
We shall prove that T /∈I and that T ∩Xi ∈I for all i < θ, thus reaching
a contradiction since X is an I-partition.
For each i < θ, if α ∈T and α ∈Ai, then p∪qα ∈G and hence, by (22.31),
α /∈Xi. It follows that T ∩Xi ∩Ai = ∅, and so by (22.28), T ∩Xi ∈I.
Let us ﬁnally show that T /∈I. It suﬃces to show that T ∩Z ̸= ∅whenever
Z ∈D. Thus let Z ∈D, and let us prove that qα ∈G for some α ∈Z. Let
E = {r ∈P : r ≤qα for some α ∈Z}.
It is easy to see that E is dense in P because Z is unbounded and qα ∈P α
for each α < κ. Thus E ∩G ̸= ∅and hence T ∩Z ̸= ∅.

22.1. Let I be a κ-complete ideal and let λ ≤κ. If I is not λ-saturated then there

since Yγ ⊂κ −Z.]
22.5. If I is a σ-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ and P is a σ-saturated notion of

[Proceed as in Lemma 22.11 and use Exercise 22.4 to show that J is σ-saturated.]
If κ is measurable and if we adjoin λ ≥κ Cohen reals, then κ carries a σ-

g : ω →ω, then for at most countably many α’s we have fα(n) ≤g(n) for all n.
[V [G] is also obtained by forcing with the product of λ copies of the notion of
forcing that adjoins a generic function f : ω →ω, thus V [G] = V [⟨fα : α < λ⟩].
Show that if g : ω →ω, then there is a countable A ⊂λ such that g ∈V [⟨fα :

22.8. If I is κ+-saturated, then P(κ)/I is a complete Boolean algebra.
[By Exercise 7.33 it suﬃces to show that B is κ+-complete. Show that P W

22.9. If the GCH holds and B = P(κ)/I is complete, then I is κ+-saturated.
[If B is not κ+-saturated, let W be an incompatible subset of B of size κ+.
For each X ⊂W let ux = P X. It follows that |B| ≥2κ+, but clearly |B| ≤2κ;
a contradiction.]
22.10. If I is normal, then P(κ)/I is κ+-complete.
[Let Xα, α < κ, be disjoint subsets of κ such that Xα /∈I for all α. For each
α < κ let Yα be Xα without the least element of Xα; let Y = S
α<κ Yα. On the
one hand, [Y ] ≥[Xα] for all α; on the other hand, if Z ⊂Y and Z /∈I, let f be
the function on Z deﬁned such that for all x ∈Yα, f(x) = the least element of Xα.
Since f is regressive, and I is normal, f is constant on some S /∈I, and hence
Z ∩Yα /∈I for some α. Thus [Y ] = P
α<κ[Xα].]

of Xi, and Yi ∩Zα ⊂α + 1 for every α < κ. Thus any Yi, Yj are almost disjoint.]
22.12. If I is a κ-complete ideal on κ with the property that every regressive
function is bounded almost everywhere (i.e., if f(α) < α for almost all α, then
there is γ < κ such that f(α) < γ for almost all α), then I is κ-saturated (and
normal).
[Otherwise, let Xα, α < κ, be a partition of κ into disjoint sets of positive

each level has size < κ; each level α < κ is nonempty because κ is inaccessible and
I is κ-complete. Then use sat(I) ≤κ to show that T has no branch of length κ.]

[There is a set X of positive measure and a function f on X such that X forces

Historical Notes
Saturated ideals, a concept introduced by Tarski in [1945], were brought to promi-
nence in Solovay’s work [1971]. Solovay introduced the technique of generic ultra-
powers and proved Theorems 22.1 and 22.26 (as well as Theorem 8.10).
Theorem 22.2 is due to Prikry [1975], and so is the model in Example 22.10 in
which κ carries a σ-saturated ideal [1970]. Theorem 22.16 is due to Jech and Prikry
([1976] and [1979]).
Precipitous ideals were introduced by Jech and Prikry in [1976]; their pa-
per [1979] investigates generic ultrapowers. Lemma 22.21: Jech [1976]. Lemma 22.28:
Solovay [1971]. Lemmas 22.29 and 22.30: Jech and Prikry [1976, 1979].
Kunen’s paper [1978] contains a number of results on saturated ideals. Kunen
constructs several generic extensions with saturated ideals, including a model (using
a huge cardinal) in which ℵ1 carries an ℵ2-saturated ideal. In [1970], Kunen proves
that if κ carries a κ+-saturated ideal then there is an inner model with a measurable
cardinal; in [1971a] Kunen shows that if moreover κ is a successor cardinal then
there is an inner model with many measurable cardinals. Mitchell [1983] improved
this to measurable cardinals of order κ+. Part (i) of Theorem 22.33 is due to Jech
and Prikry and part (ii) was proved by Mitchell; see Jech et al. [1980].

23. The Nonstationary Ideal
Stationary sets play a fundamental role in modern set theory. In particular,
the analysis of the nonstationary ideal INS on ω1 has been used in the study
of forcing axioms, large cardinals and determinacy. These will be dealt with in
later chapters; this chapter continues the investigations began in Chapters 8
and 22. Throughout this chapter “almost all” means all except nonstationary
many.
Some Combinatorial Principles
We begin with combinatorial principles that involve stationary sets. Let us
recall Jensen’s Principle (♦): There exist sets Sα ⊂α such that for every
X ⊂ω1, the set {α < ω1 : X ∩α = Sα} is stationary. There are several vari-
ants of ♦(see e.g. Exercise 15.25); most notably the following weak version:
Lemma 23.1. The following principle is equivalent to ♦: There exists a se-
quence ⟨Sα : α < ω1⟩of countable sets such that for each X ⊂ω1 the set
{α < ω1 : X ∩α ∈Sα} is stationary.
Proof. Let ⟨Sα : α < ω1⟩be a sequence as in the lemma; we shall produce
a diamond sequence. First, let f be a one-to-one mapping of ω1 onto ω1 × ω
such that f“α = α × ω for all limit ordinals α. For every limit ordinal α, let
Aα = {f“x : x ∈Sα} (and Aα = ∅otherwise). Note that for each Y ⊂ω1 ×ω
the set {α < ω1 : Y ∩(α × ω) ∈Aα} is stationary.
For each α, let Aα = {an
α : n ∈ω}. It follows that for each X ⊂ω1 × ω
there exists some n such that the set {α : X ∩(α × ω) = an
α} is stationary.
For each α < ω1 and each n, let Sn
α = {ξ < α : (ξ, n) ∈an
α}. We complete
the proof by showing that for some n, ⟨Sn
α : α < ω1⟩is a diamond sequence.
If not, there exist sets Xn ⊂ω1 such that {α < ω1 : Xn ∩α = Sn
α} are
nonstationary. Letting X = 
n∈ω(Xn × {n}), it follows that for each n,
{α < ω1 : X ∩(α × ω) ̸= an
α} is nonstationary; a contradiction.
⊓⊔
The Diamond Principle admits a generalization from ω1 to any regular
cardinal κ. Even more generally, let E be a stationary subset of a regular

442
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
cardinal κ. ♦(E) is the following principle (and ♦κ is ♦(κ)):
(23.1)
There exists a sequence of sets ⟨Sα : α ∈E⟩with Sα ⊂α such that
for every X ⊂κ, the set {α ∈E : X ∩α = Sα} is a stationary subset
of κ.
The proof of Theorem 13.21 generalizes to show that if V
= L, then
♦(E) holds for any regular cardinal κ and any stationary set E ⊂κ.
For a successor cardinal κ+ and a stationary subset E, consider the fol-
lowing:
(23.2)
There exists a sequence of sets ⟨Sα : α ∈E⟩such that |Sα| ≤κ for
each α, and for every X ⊂κ+, the set {α ∈E : X ∩α ∈Sα} is
stationary.
The proof of Lemma 23.1 generalizes and shows that (23.2) is equivalent
to ♦(E).
While the Diamond Principle holds in L, as well as in L[U] and other
inner models for large cardinals, restrictions of ♦to various stationary sets
can be proved just from assumptions on cardinal arithmetic. Let λ < κ+ be
a regular cardinal, and recall (8.4) that Eκ+
λ
is the set of all ordinals α < κ+
of coﬁnality λ.
Theorem 23.2 (Gregory). If λ is regular such that κλ = κ and if 2κ = κ+,
then ♦(Eκ+
λ ) holds.
In particular, if 2ℵ0 = ℵ1 and 2ℵ1 = ℵ2 then ♦(Eℵ2
ℵ0 ) holds.
Proof. We prove the version of ♦(E) from (23.2) where E = Eκ+
λ ; by
Lemma 23.1, ♦(E) follows. Let ⟨xα : α < κ+⟩enumerate all bounded subsets
of κ+ (this is possible by 2κ = κ+). For each α ∈E, we let Sα be the set of all
Y ⊂α such that Y is the union of at most λ elements of the set {xβ : β < α}.
Since κλ = κ, we have |Sα| ≤κ.
We claim that ⟨Sα : α ∈E⟩satisﬁes (23.2). Let X ⊂κ+; we will show
that X ∩α ∈Sα for almost all α ∈E. Let C be the set of all α < κ+ such that
for every β < α, X ∩β = xγ for some γ < α. The set C is closed unbounded.
We claim that if α ∈C ∩E then X ∩α ∈Sα. Let Z ⊂α be a set coﬁnal
in α such that |Z| = λ. If for each β ∈Z, γ(β) < α is such that X ∩β = xγ(β),
then X ∩α = {xγ(β) : β ∈Z}, and hence X ∩α ∈Sα.
⊓⊔
A property related to ♦is club-guessing. This has been introduced and
investigated in detail by Shelah. Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal and
let E be a stationary subset of κ. If C ⊂κ is closed unbounded and if each
cα, α ∈E, is coﬁnal in α, we say that ⟨cα : α ∈E⟩guesses C if for all α ∈E,
C contains an end segment of cα, i.e., C ⊃cα −β for some β < α.
Theorem 23.3 (Shelah). Let κ ≥ℵ3 be a regular uncountable cardinal, and
let λ be a regular uncountable cardinal such that λ+ < κ. Then there exists
a sequence ⟨cα : α ∈Eκ
λ⟩with each cα ⊂α closed unbounded, such that for
every closed unbounded set C ⊂κ, the set {α ∈Eκ
λ : cα ⊂C} is stationary.

23. The Nonstationary Ideal
443
Proof. It suﬃces to ﬁnd a family {cα : α ∈Eκ
λ} such that each cα is a closed
subset of α, and for every closed unbounded C ⊂κ, the set {α ∈Eκ
λ : cα is
unbounded in α and cα ⊂C} is stationary.
Assume that no such {cα : α ∈Eκ
λ} exists. Let {c0
α : α ∈Eκ
λ} be any
collection of closed unbounded subsets of the α’s of order-type λ. By induction
on ν < λ+, we construct closed unbounded sets Cν ⊂κ and collections
{cν
α : α ∈Eκ
λ} as follows: cν
α = c0
α ∩
ξ<ν Cξ, and Cν is such that the set
{α ∈Eκ
λ : cν
α is unbounded in α and cν
α ⊂Cν} is nonstationary.
Let C be the closed unbounded set C = 
ν<λ+ Cν, and for each α let
cα = c0
α ∩C. The set S = {α ∈Eκ
λ : C ∩α is unbounded in α} is stationary,
and for each α ∈S there exists a ν(α) < λ+ such that cα = cν(α)
α
(because
c0
α ⊃c1
α ⊃. . . of length λ+).
There exist a ν < λ+ and a stationary set T ⊂S such that cα = cν
α for
all α ∈T . If α ∈T then cν
α = cν+1
α
= cν
α ∩Cν, and so cν
α ⊂Cν, contrary to
the choice of Cν.
⊓⊔
The sequence ⟨cα : α ∈Eκ
λ⟩guesses every closed unbounded set at sta-
tionary many α’s. The same proof shows that for every stationary E ⊂Eκ
λ
there exists a sequence ⟨cα : α ∈E⟩that guesses every closed unbounded set
at stationary many α ∈E (Exercise 23.1). We state, without proof, a fur-
ther reﬁnement that will be used later in this chapter in the proof of the
Gitik-Shelah Theorem 23.17.
Lemma 23.4. Let κ and λ be regular uncountable cardinals such that λ+ <
κ. For every stationary set E ⊂Eκ
λ there exists a sequence ⟨cα : α ∈E⟩with
each cα ⊂α closed unbounded, such that for every closed unbounded C ⊂κ,
the set {α ∈E : cα ∈C} is stationary, and moreover,
(23.3)
if α ∈E is a limit of ordinals of coﬁnality greater than λ, then all
nonlimit elements of cα have coﬁnality greater than λ.
Proof. For proof, see Gitik and Shelah [1997].
⊓⊔
This cannot be improved much further; see Exercise 23.2.
One of the most fundamental combinatorial principles is Jensen’s Square
Principle. Let κ be an uncountable cardinal; □κ (square-kappa) is as follows:
(□κ) There exists a sequence ⟨Cα : α ∈Lim(κ+)⟩such that
(i) Cα is a closed unbounded subset of α;
(ii) if β ∈Lim(Cα) then Cβ = Cα ∩β;
(iii) if cf α < κ then |Cα| < κ.
(23.4)
The sequence ⟨Cα : α ∈Lim(κ+)⟩is called a square-sequence. Note that by
(ii) and (iii), the order-type of every Cα is at most κ.
Using the ﬁne structure theory of L, Jensen proved that in L, □κ holds
for every uncountable cardinal κ. (We elaborate on this in Part III). This has

444
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
been extended to most inner models for large cardinals: the Square Principles
hold in L[U], L[U], an in more general inner models.
Squares are relatively easy to obtain by forcing; as an example, see Exer-
cise 23.3.
Deﬁnition 23.5. Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal and let α < κ be
a limit ordinal of uncountable coﬁnality. We say that a stationary set S ⊂κ
reﬂects at α if S ∩α is a stationary subset of α.
Corollary 17.20 states that if κ is a weakly compact cardinal then every
stationary subset of κ reﬂects. We address the subject of reﬂection of sta-
tionary sets later in this chapter. See also Exercises 23.4 and 23.5. In general,
squares provide examples of nonreﬂecting stationary sets:
Lemma 23.6. □ω1 implies that there exists a stationary set S ⊂Eℵ2
ℵ0 that
does not reﬂect.
Proof. Let ⟨Cα : α ∈Lim(ω2)⟩be a square-sequence. For each α < ω2 of
coﬁnality ω1, the order-type of Cα is ω1. It follows that there exists a count-
able limit ordinal η such that the set S = {γ ∈Eℵ2
ℵ0 : γ is the ηth element of
some Cα} is stationary. But for every α of coﬁnality ω1, S has at most one
element in common with Cα. Hence S does not reﬂect.
⊓⊔
Stationary Sets in Generic Extensions
If κ is a regular uncountable cardinal then a closed unbounded subset of κ
in the ground model remains a closed unbounded subset of κ in a generic
extensions (but κ may fail to remain a cardinal or its coﬁnality may change).
It follows that if S ∈V is stationary in V [G] then S is stationary in V .
A stationary set in V may, however, be no longer stationary in V [G], as
there may exist a new closed unbounded set in V [G] that is disjoint from it.
We recall Lemma 22.25 that states that if the forcing satisﬁes the κ-chain
condition then every stationary subset of κ in V is preserved; i.e., remains
stationary in V [G]. Another condition on preservation of stationary sets is
the following:
Lemma 23.7. Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal and let P be a notion
of forcing. If P is <κ-closed then every stationary S ⊂κ remains stationary
in V [G].
Proof. Let p ⊩˙C is closed unbounded; we ﬁnd a γ ∈S and a q ≤p such
that q ⊩γ ∈˙C as follows: We construct an increasing continuous ordinal
sequence ⟨γα : α < κ⟩and a decreasing sequence ⟨pα : α < κ⟩of conditions
such that pα+1 ⊩γα+1 ∈˙C. If α is a limit ordinal then γα = limξ<α γξ and
pα is a lower bound of {pξ : ξ < α}. There exists a limit ordinal α such that
γα ∈S. It follows that pα ⊩γα ∈˙C.
⊓⊔

23. The Nonstationary Ideal
445
The basic method for destroying stationary sets by forcing is the following
forcing known as “shooting a closed unbounded set.”
Theorem 23.8. Let S be a stationary subset of ω1. There is a notion of
forcing PS that adds generically a closed unbounded set C ⊂ω1 such that
C ⊂S, and such that PS adds no new countable sets.
Since PS adds no countable sets, ℵ1 is preserved. The set ω1 −S is non-
stationary in V [G]; thus if S is chosen so that its complement is stationary,
the forcing destroys some stationary set.
Proof. PS consists of all bounded closed sets of ordinals p such that p ⊂S;
p is stronger than q if p is an end-extension of q (if q = p ∩α for some α).
If G is a generic ﬁlter, let C =  G. Clearly, C is a subset of S, and
because for every α < ω1 the set {p ∈P : max(p) ≥α} is dense in PS, C is
an unbounded subset of ω1. Also, sup(C ∩α) ∈C holds for every α < ω1,
and so C is a closed unbounded set. It remains to prove that ℵ1 is preserved
and that there are no new countable sets of ordinals.
Lemma 23.9. PS is ω-distributive.
Proof. Let p ⊩˙f : ω →Ord; we shall ﬁnd a q ≤p and some f so that
q ⊩˙f = f.
By induction on α we construct a chain {Aα : α < ω1} of countable
subsets of PS. Let A0 = {p}, and Aα = 
β<α Aβ if α is a limit ordinal.
Given Aα, let γα = sup{max(q) : q ∈Aα}. For each q ∈Aα and each n, we
choose some r = r(q, n) ∈PS so that r ≤q, r decides ˙f(n), and max(r) > γα.
Then we let Aα+1 = Aα ∪{r(q, n) : q ∈Aα, n < ω}.
The sequence ⟨γα : α < ω1⟩is increasing and continuous. Let C = {λ : if
α < λ then γα < λ}. As C is closed unbounded, there exists a limit ordinal λ
such that λ ∈C ∩S. Let ⟨αn : n < ω⟩be an increasing sequence with limit λ;
then limn γαn = λ as well.
There is a sequence of conditions ⟨pn : n < ω⟩such that p0 = p and
that for every n, pn+1 ∈Aαn+1, pn+1 ≤pn, and pn+1 decides ˙f(n). Since
γαn < max(pn+1) ≤γαn+1, we have limn max(pn) = λ, and because λ ∈S,
the closed set q ∈∞
n=0 pn ∪{λ} is a condition. Since q ≤pn for all n,
q decides each ˙f(n), and so there exists some f such that q ⊩˙f = f.
⊓⊔
The forcing PS can be generalized for cardinals κ greater than ℵ1 but
additional assumptions on S must be made in order to preserve κ. See, e.g.,
Exercises 23.7 and 23.8.
Precipitousness of the Nonstationary Ideal
In Theorem 22.33(ii) we showed that if κ is a measurable cardinal and P is
the L´evy collapse (with ﬁnite conditions, making κ = ℵ1) then in V [G],

Part II. Advanced Set Theory
there exists a precipitous ideal on ℵ1. We now improve this to making the
nonstationary ideal precipitous:
Theorem 23.10 (Magidor). It is consistent, relative to the existence of
a measurable cardinal, that the nonstationary ideal on ℵ1 is precipitous.
Proof. Let κ be a measurable cardinal, and let us assume that 2κ = κ+. Let
U be a normal measure on κ. Let M be the ultrapower M = UltU(V ) with
j : V →M the canonical embedding.
Let P be the L´evy collapse: a condition p ∈P is a ﬁnite function with
dom(p) ⊂κ × ω such that p(α, n) < α for every (α, n) ∈dom(p).
Let G be a P-generic ﬁlter. In V [G] (where κ = ℵ1) let I0 be the ideal
generated by the dual of U: I0 = {X ⊂κ : X ∩Y = ∅for some Y ∈U}.
The proof of Theorem 22.33(ii) shows that in V [G], for every X ⊂κ, X /∈I0,
there exists an I0-generic ultraﬁlter D0 with X ∈D0 such that UltD0(V [G]) is
well-founded. Let G × H be j(P)-generic that contains some condition (p, q)
with (p, q) ⊩j(P ) κ ∈j( ˙X); then j : V →M extends in V [G × H] to an
elementary j : V [G] →M[G × H] by setting j( ˙xG) = (j( ˙x))G×H for every
P-name ˙x, and D0 = { ˙XG : κ ∈(j( ˙X))G×H}.
Our model will be of the form V [G, C] where G is P-generic and C = ⟨Cα :
α < κ+⟩, with each Cα a closed unbounded subset of κ, is V [G]-generic on
a set Qκ+ of conditions. The sets Qα, α ≤κ+, will be deﬁned by induction
on α, together with ideals Iα on κ in V [G, C↾α].
Since 2κ = κ+, we can deﬁne a sequence ⟨˙Aα : α < κ+⟩such that for
each α < κ+, ˙Aα is a name for a subset of κ in V [G, C↾α] and for all α < κ+
every subset of κ in V [G, C↾α] has a name ˙Aγ for some γ ≥α. We will show
that Qκ+ satisﬁes the κ-chain condition; it will follow that every subset of κ
in V [G, C] is in V [G, C↾α] for some α < κ+.
The forcing Qκ+ is, in V [G], a countable support iteration of shooting
a closed unbounded subset Cα of κ −˙Aα, if ˙Aα ∈Iα. More precisely:
A condition q ∈Qα is a sequence ⟨qβ : β < α⟩in V [G] such that
(i) qβ = ∅for all but countably many β < α,
(ii) qβ is a closed countable subset of κ, for all β < α,
(iii) qβ↾β ∈Qβ for all β < α,
(iv) if α = β + 1 then either q↾β ⊩˙Aβ /∈Iβ or q↾β ⊩qβ ∩˙Aβ = ∅.
(23.5)
(The ideals Iα, α < κ+, will be deﬁned in Lemma 23.12 below.) If q, q′ ∈Qα
then q ≤q′ if for each β < α, qβ is an end-extension of q′
β.
In a generic extension of V [G] by Qκ+, for every α < κ+ the union of
all qα, with q = ⟨qα : α < κ+⟩in the generic ﬁlter, is a closed unbounded
subset of κ.
Lemma 23.11. Qκ+ satisﬁes the κ+-chain condition.
Proof. Let W be a maximal antichain. Since |Qα| ≤κ for each α < κ+ there
exists an α < κ+ such that for every q ∈W there is some q′ ∈W ∩Qα with

23. The Nonstationary Ideal
447
q′ ≤q↾α. But q ∪q′ is a condition, so q′ and q are compatible, and so q = q′.
Hence W ⊂Qα and |W| ≤κ.
⊓⊔
Working in V [G × H], let us consider again the elementary embedding
j : V [G] →M[G × H]. If α < κ+, then |P(Qα)V [G]| = κ+ < j(κ) and
therefore P(Qα)V [G] is countable in V [G × H], and hence there exists a Qα-
generic set C = ⟨Cβ : β < α⟩. Because each Cβ ⊂κ and |α| ≤κ, it follows
that C ∈M[G × H] (for the proof see Lemma 21.9).
In the following arguments, we consider sequences C = ⟨Cβ : β < α⟩of
closed unbounded subsets of κ, and q = ⟨qβ : β < α⟩of conditions in Qα,
and use the notation q ∈C to mean that each qβ is an initial segment of Cβ.
For any α < κ+, we deﬁne (in M[G × H]), for any Qα-generic sequence C,
the sequence qC = ⟨qC
γ : γ < j(α)⟩by
(23.6)
qC
γ =
Cβ ∪{κ}
if γ = j(β),
∅
otherwise.
Lemma 23.12. qC ∈j(Qα) and qC ≤j(q) for any q ∈C.
Proof. By induction on α. Simultaneously, we deﬁne the ideals Iα for α > 0.
Assuming that the lemma holds, we deﬁne Iα as follows: If X ∈V [G, C↾α],
then X ∈Iα if and only if for some p ∈G and some q ∈C↾α
(23.7)
p ⊩j(P ) (for every C ∋q, Qα-generic over M[G], qC ⊩j(Qα) κ /∈j( ˙X)).
Now assume that the lemma has been proved for all β < α. When we
deﬁne qC by (23.7), we have qC ∈M[G × H], and once we verify that qC is
a condition in j(Qα) then the rest of the lemma follows. The only nontrivial
veriﬁcation of qC ∈j(Qα) is clause (iv) of (23.5).
Thus let α = β +1 and assume that qC↾j(β) does not force j( ˙Aβ) /∈j(Iβ);
we want qC↾j(β) ⊩qC
j(β) ∩j( ˙Aβ) = ∅.
Let ξ ≤κ = max(qC
j(β)), and ﬁrst consider the case ξ < κ. Assume
that (in some extension of M[G ∩H] by a generic ﬁlter containing qC↾j(β)),
ξ ∈qC
j(β) ∩j( ˙Aβ). Since ξ = j(ξ), we have ξ ∈Cβ, and there is some q ∈Qα
such that q ∈C, ξ ∈qβ, and q↾β ⊩ξ ∈˙Aβ. Hence q↾β ⊩˙Aβ /∈Iβ, therefore
j(q↾β) ⊩j( ˙Aβ) /∈Ij(β) and because qC↾j(β) ≤j(q↾β), we have qC↾j(β) ⊩
j( ˙Aβ) /∈Ij(β), a contradiction.
Now consider the case ξ = κ. Let q ∈C↾β be such that q decides ˙Aβ ∈Iβ.
The assumption q ⊩˙Aβ /∈Iβ leads to a contradiction as in the preceding
case; thus assume that q ⊩
˙Aβ ∈Iβ. Then, by deﬁnition of Iβ, we have
qC↾j(β) ⊩κ /∈j( ˙Aβ), and so qC↾j(β) ⊩qC
j(β) ∩j( ˙Aβ) = ∅.
Hence qC satisﬁes (23.5)(iv).
⊓⊔
Lemma 23.13. If β < α then Iβ = Iα ∩V [G, C↾β].

448
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Proof. It is clear that Iβ ⊂Iα. Thus let ˙X be a P ∗Qβ-name for a subset
of κ, and let p ∈P and q ∈Qα be such that (p, q) forces ˙X ∈Iα and ˙X /∈Iβ.
By the latter,
p ⊩j(P ) ∃Qβ-generic C′ over M[G] with q↾β ∈C and
∃q′ ≤qC′ such that q′ ⊩j(Qβ) κ ∈j( ˙X).
In M[G × H], Qα is countable, so C′ ∈M[G, H↾δ] for some δ < j(κ). In
M[G × H], ﬁnd a Qα-generic C′′ over M[G] such that C↾β = C′ and q ∈C′′.
Then q′ ∪qC′′ is stronger than qC′′ and forces κ ∈j( ˙X). It follows that (p, q)
does not force ˙X ∈Iα, a contradiction.
⊓⊔
We let I = 
α<κ+ Iα.
Lemma 23.14. I is a normal ideal.
Proof. Let f ∈V [G, C] be a function f : κ →κ, and assume that
(23.8)
(p, q) ⊩{α : f(α) < α} /∈I
and
(∀γ < κ) {α : f(α) = γ} ∈I.
By Lemma 23.11, f ∈V [G, C↾α] for some α < κ+, and (23.8) holds for Iα in
place of I. Let G × H be j(P)-generic with p ∈G, and work in M[G × H].
There exists a Qα-generic C′ with q ∈C′ such that some q′ < qC′ forces
j(f)(κ) < κ. Then some q′′ < q′ forces j(f)(κ) = γ, for some γ, and hence
(p, q) does not force {α : f(α) = γ} ∈Iα, a contradiction.
⊓⊔
Lemma 23.15. I is, in V [G, C], the nonstationary ideal on ℵ1 = κ.
Proof. That κ = ℵ1 in V [G, C] follows from the normality of I. Each Cα is
a closed unbounded subset of ω1, and since Cα ∩Aα = ∅if Aα ∈I, every set
in I is nonstationary. On the other hand let ˙C be a name for a subset of κ
and let q ∈C be such that q ⊩˙C is a closed unbounded set. Then for every
C′ ∋q,
qC′ ⊩j( ˙C) is closed and j( ˙C) ∩κ is unbounded in κ
and so qC′ ⊩κ ∈j( ˙C). It follows that q ⊩κ −˙C ∈Iα and so every nonsta-
tionary set is in I.
⊓⊔
It remains to show that I is precipitous.
Let R(I) denote the forcing with I-positive sets; a generic ﬁlter on R(I)
is an ultraﬁlter that extends the dual of I. Let (p1, q1) be a condition in P ∗Q
and let ˙X be a name for a subset of κ, such that (p1, q1) ⊩˙X /∈I. We want
to ﬁnd generic G and C with p1 ∈G and q1 ∈C, and an R(I)-generic D with
˙X ∈D such that UltD V [G, C] is well-founded.
Since (p1, q1) forces ˙X /∈I, there exist p′
1 ∈j(P) and α < κ+ such that
p′
1 < p1, p′
1 ⊩˙X ∈V [G, C↾α] and
(23.9)
p′
1 ⊩j(P ) ∃Qα-generic C′ over M[G] with q1 ∈C′
such that qC′ ⊩j(Qα) κ /∈j( ˙X).
Let G × H be j(P)-generic over V with p′
1 ∈G × H. Let C′ ∈M[G × H] be
as in (23.9), and pick q′
1 ∈j(Qα) such that q′
1 ≤qC′ and q′
1 ⊩κ ∈j( ˙X).

23. The Nonstationary Ideal
449
We shall ﬁnd C and C∗so that j extends to j : V [G, C] →M[G × H, C∗].
We require that j(q) ∈C∗whenever q ∈C, or C = {q ∈Q : j(q) ∈C∗}.
Let Q∗be the following subordering of j(Q) in V [G × H]. For each q ∈
j(Q) let Cq = {q′ ∈Q : j(q′) ≥q}, and let
(23.10)
Q∗= {q ∈j(Q) : (∃α < κ+) Cq ⊂Qα and
Cq is Qα-generic over V [G]}.
Then q′
1 ∈Q∗, so we can ﬁnd a set C∗that is Q∗-generic over V [G × H] with
q∗
1 ∈C∗, and let C = j−1(C∗).
Lemma 23.16. C is Q-generic over V [G] and C∗is j(Q)-generic over
M[G × H].
Proof. We ﬁrst show that for all α < κ+, the set
Bα = {q ∈Q∗: Cq↾α is Qα-generic over V [G]}
is dense in Q∗. Let q ∈Q∗. If q /∈Bα then by (23.10) there exists some
β < α such that Cq ⊂Qβ and Cq is Qβ-generic over V [G]. But P(Qα)∩V [G]
is countable in M[G × H] so there exists a C′ Qα-generic over V [G] such
that C′↾β = Cq. Since |Qα| = κ, this C′ is in M[G × H] and we can take
q′ = q ∪qC′. Then q′ ≤q and q′ ∈Q∗∩Bα.
Now let A be an open dense subset of Q in V [G]. Since Q satisﬁes the
κ+-chain condition in V [G], A contains a maximal antichain of cardinality κ.
Thus for some α < κ+, A∩Qα is dense in Qα. Since Bα is dense in Q∗, there is
a q ∈C∗such that Cq↾α is Qα-generic over V [G] and hence C∩A ⊃Cq∩A ̸= ∅,
and so C is Q-generic over V [G].
Similarly, if A ∈M[G × H] is open dense in j(Q) then (because j(Q) sat-
isﬁes the j(κ+)-chain condition in M[G × H] and j(κ+) = 
α<κ+ j(α))
A ∩j(Qα) is dense in j(Qα) for some α < κ+. Since Bα is dense in Q∗,
C∗↾j(α) is j(Qα)-generic over V [G × H] and hence A ∩C∗̸= ∅, and so C∗is
j(Q)-generic over M[G × H].
⊓⊔
Hence j extends to an elementary embedding j : V [G, C] →M[G × H, C∗].
Let
D = {z ∈P(κ) ∩V [G, C] : κ ∈j(z)};
D is an ultraﬁlter extending the dual of I, and UltD V [G, C] is well-founded.
Also, ˙X ∈D because (p′
1, q′
1) ∈G × H × C∗; it remains to show that D is
R(I)-generic over V [G, C].
Toward a contradiction, let W be a subset of R(I) in V [G, C] such that
W ∩D = ∅; we will show that W is not dense in R(I). Since W is disjoint
from D, there exist p2 ∈G × H and q2 ∈C∗, and some ˙A such that (p2, q2) ≤
(p1, q1) and
(23.11)
p2 ⊩j(P ) q2 ⊩Q∗˙A ∈W and κ /∈j( ˙A).

450
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Since (p2, q2) ∈M = UltU(V ), there is a function f : κ →P ∗Q such that
(p2, q2) = j(f)(κ). Let T = {α : f(α) ∈G × C}. Then since κ ∈j(T ) if and
only if (p2, q2) ∈G × H × C∗, we can rewrite (23.11) as
(23.12)
⊩j(P )⊩Q∗(∀A ∈W) κ /∈j(A ∩T ).
For any A ∈W, let αA be such that q2 ∈j(QαA) and A ∈V [G, C↾αA].
By (23.12) and (23.10) we have
⊩j(P ) for every QαA-generic C′ over V [G], qC′ ⊩j(Q) κ /∈j(A ∩T ).
This says that A ∩T ∈I for all A ∈W. But T ∈D, and hence T /∈I. This
contradicts W being dense.
⊓⊔
Thus the consistency strength of “INS on ω1 is precipitous” is exactly
the existence of a measurable cardinal. For cardinals greater than ω1 the
consistency is considerably stronger. For instance, “INS on ω2 is precipitous”
is equiconsistent with a measurable cardinal of order 2 (Gitik); for larger
cardinals it is much stronger. Most of the best results to date are due to
Gitik.
Saturation of the Nonstationary Ideal
By Solovay’s Theorem 8.10, the nonstationary ideal INS on κ is nowhere κ-
saturated. For κ = ℵ1 it is consistent that INS is κ+-saturated; its consistency
strength is roughly that of a Woodin cardinal. We shall return to this subject
in Part III.
For κ greater than ℵ1, the nonstationary ideal is not κ+-saturated:
Theorem 23.17 (Gitik-Shelah). For every regular cardinal κ ≥ℵ2, the
ideal INS on κ is not κ+-saturated.
The proof of Theorem 23.17 appears in Gitik and Shelah [1997]. Most
special cases were proved earlier by Shelah, and we present this proof ﬁrst,
as it is somewhat easier. The complete proof will follow.
The results presented here are somewhat more general as they apply to
other normal ideals. If I is a normal ideal, I+ denotes the collection {S ⊂κ :
S /∈I} of sets of positive I-measure. For S ∈I+, I↾S denotes the ideal
{X ⊂κ : X ∩S ∈I}; we say that I↾S concentrates on S.
We shall use the method of generic ultrapowers, and start with several ob-
servations. Let I be a normal κ+-saturated κ-complete ideal on a regular un-
countable cardinal κ. The generic ultrapower M = UltG(V ) is well-founded,
and since the forcing with sets of positive I-measure satisﬁes the κ+-chain
condition, κ+ is a cardinal in V [G], and hence in M.

23. The Nonstationary Ideal
451
Lemma 23.18. Let I be a normal κ+-saturated κ-complete ideal on κ, let
R(I) be the forcing with I-positive sets, let G be the R(I)-generic ultraﬁlter
and let M = UltG(V ). Then P M(κ) = P V [G](κ), and all cardinals (and
coﬁnalities) < κ are preserved in V [G].
Proof. The Boolean algebra B = P(κ)/I is complete (see Exercise 22.9). If
˙A is a name for a subset A = ˙AG of κ in V [G], let Sα ∈I+ be, for each
α < κ, such that ∥α ∈˙A∥= [Sα]. If j : V →M is the canonical embedding,
we have, for each α, α ∈A if and only if Sα ∈G if and only if κ ∈j(Sα),
and so the set A = {α ∈κ : κ ∈j(Sα)} is in M.
If λ < κ is a cardinal then since κ is the critical point of j, λ is a cardinal
in M. Since P V [G](λ) = P M(λ), λ is a cardinal in V [G].
⊓⊔
We shall use a combinatorial lemma due to Shelah. Let λ be a cardinal
and let α < λ+ be a limit ordinal. A family {Xξ : ξ < λ+} of subsets of α is
strongly almost disjoint if every Xξ ⊂α is unbounded, and if for every ϑ < λ+
there exist ordinals δξ < α, for ξ < ϑ, such that the sets Xξ −δξ, ξ < ϑ, are
pairwise disjoint. If κ is a regular cardinal then there exists a strongly almost
disjoint family of κ+ subsets of κ (see Exercise 23.10).
Lemma 23.19. If α < λ+ and cf α ̸= cf λ then there exists no strongly
almost disjoint family of subsets of α.
Proof. Assume to the contrary that {Xξ : ξ < λ+} is a strongly almost
disjoint family of subsets of α. We may assume that each Xξ has order-
type cf α. Let f be a function that maps λ onto α. Since cf λ ̸= cf α there
exists for each ξ some γξ < λ such that Xξ ∩f“γξ is coﬁnal in α. There exist
some γ and a set W ⊂λ+ of size λ such that γξ = γ for all ξ ∈W. Let
ϑ > sup W. By the assumption on the Xξ there exist ordinals δξ < α, ξ < ϑ,
such that the Xξ −δξ are pairwise disjoint. Thus f −1(Xξ −δξ), ξ ∈W, are
λ pairwise disjoint nonempty subsets of γ. A contradiction.
⊓⊔
Corollary 23.20. If κ is a regular cardinal and if a notion of forcing P
makes cf κ ̸= cf |κ|, then P collapses κ+.
Proof. Assume that κ+ is preserved; thus in V [G], (κ+)V = λ+ where λ = |κ|.
In V there is a strongly almost disjoint family {Xξ : ξ < (κ+)V }, and it
remains strongly almost disjoint in V [G], and has size λ+. Since cf κ ̸= cf λ
(in V [G]), this contradicts Lemma 23.19.
⊓⊔
Corollary 23.21. If κ = λ+, if ν ̸= cf λ is a regular cardinal, and if I is
a normal κ-complete κ+-saturated ideal on κ, then Eκ
ν = {α < κ : cf α =
ν} ∈I.
Proof. Assume that Eκ
ν ∈I+, and let G be a generic ultraﬁlter on P(κ)/I.
By Lemma 23.18, all cardinals ≤λ, as well as κ+, are preserved in V [G]. If
Eκ
ν ∈G, then in M, cf κ = ν, and so (by Lemma 23.18) cf κ = ν in V [G]. Thus
we have, in V [G], cf κ = ν and |κ| = λ while κ+ is preserved, contradictory
Corollary 23.20.
⊓⊔

452
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
It follows that if κ is a successor cardinal greater than ℵ1 then the nonsta-
tionary ideal on κ is not κ+-saturated: In fact INS↾Eκ
ν is not κ+-saturated,
for all regular ν ̸= cf λ where λ is the predecessor of κ.
We complete the proof of Theorem 23.17 using Lemma 23.4 on club-
guessing. We shall show that for every regular κ ≥ℵ3 and every uncountable
regular λ such that λ+ < κ, the ideal INS↾Eκ
λ is not κ+-saturated.
Thus let κ and λ be regular uncountable such that λ+ < κ. Let E be
a stationary subset of Eκ
λ. By Lemma 23.4 there exists a sequence ⟨cα : α ∈E⟩
with each cα coﬁnal in α, that satisﬁes (23.3) and such that for every closed
unbounded C, the set
G(C) = {α ∈E : (∃β < α) C ⊃cα −β}
is stationary.
Lemma 23.22. If INS↾Eκ
λ is κ+-saturated then there exists a stationary set
˜E ⊂E such that for every closed unbounded C, ˜E −G(C) is nonstationary
(C is guessed at almost every α ∈˜E).
Proof. If not, then for every stationary S ⊂E there exists a closed unbounded
set C such that S −G(C) is stationary. By the κ+-saturation, there exists
a collection {(Si, Ci) : i < κ} such that W = {Si −G(Ci) : i < κ} is
a maximal antichain in P(κ)/INS below E. Let C = △i<κ Ci. For every i < κ,
Ci contains an end-segment of C, and hence G(Ci) contains an end-segment
of G(C). As G(C) is stationary, this contradicts the maximality of W.
⊓⊔
Now we use the κ+-saturation again, and using Lemma 23.22 obtain
a maximal antichain {Si : i < κ} of pairwise disjoint stationary subsets
of Eκ
λ, and for each i a sequence ⟨cα : α ∈Si⟩of coﬁnal cα satisfying (23.3)
such that every closed unbounded C is guessed at almost every α ∈Si. Then
⟨cα : α ∈
i<κ Si⟩guesses every C almost everywhere, contrary to Exer-
cise 23.2.
This completes the proof of Theorem 23.17.
⊓⊔
The question whether various restrictions of the nonstationary ideal can
be κ+-saturated has been studied extensively. For instance, it is proved
in Jech and Woodin [1985] that it is consistent, relative to a measurable
cardinal, that κ is a Mahlo cardinal and INS↾Reg is κ+-saturated, where
Reg = {α < κ : α is a regular cardinal}. It is open whether (for instance)
INS↾Eℵ2
ℵ1 can be ℵ3-saturated.
Reﬂection
There has been a large number of results on reﬂecting stationary sets. Let us
recall that a stationary set S reﬂects at α if S ∩α is a stationary subset of α.
In this section we investigate the simplest case, namely κ = ℵ2.

23. The Nonstationary Ideal
453
There are two kinds of limit ordinals below ω2: those of coﬁnality ℵ0 and
those of coﬁnality ℵ1; the sets Eℵ2
ℵ0 and Eℵ2
ℵ1 . By Exercise 23.4, the set Eℵ2
ℵ1
does not reﬂect (at any ordinal α < ω2). By Exercise 23.5, the set Eℵ2
ℵ0 reﬂects
at every α ∈Eℵ2
ℵ1 ; the question is whether every stationary S ⊂Eℵ2
ℵ0 can
reﬂect. By Lemma 23.6, if every S ⊂Eℵ2
ℵ0 reﬂects then □ω1 fails, and this is
known (due to Jensen) to imply that ℵ2 is a Mahlo cardinal in L. On the
other hand, it is consistent relative to the existence of a Mahlo cardinal, that
every stationary S ⊂Eℵ2
ℵ1 reﬂects (Harrington and Shelah [1985]).
The following theorem shows that a stronger version of reﬂection is con-
sistent, if fact equiconsistent with weak compactness:
Theorem 23.23 (Magidor). The following are equiconsistent:
(i) the existence of a weakly compact cardinal,
(ii) every stationary set S ⊂Eℵ2
ℵ0 reﬂects at almost all α ∈Eℵ2
ℵ1 .
This result does not generalize to cardinals greater than ℵ2; see Exer-
cise 23.12. Reﬂection for stationary subsets of κ > ℵ2 is considerably more
complicated.
We shall prove that (ii) implies that ℵ2 is weakly compact in L, and then
give a brief account of the consistency proof of (ii). If every stationary set S ⊂
Eℵ2
ℵ0 reﬂects then ℵ2 is a Mahlo cardinal in L. Using Jensen’s Theorem 27.1
we prove a somewhat weaker statement.
Lemma 23.24. If every stationary S ⊂Eℵ2
ℵ0 reﬂects then ℵ2 is inaccessible
in L.
Proof. Let κ = ℵ2. Assume that κ is in L the successor of some λ, κ = (λ+)L.
In L, there exists a square-sequence ⟨Cα : α ∈Lim(κ)⟩, and the order-type
of each Cα is at most λ. By Fodor’s Theorem, there exists a stationary set
A ⊂Eℵ2
ℵ1 such that all Cα, α ∈A, have the same order-type.
The set {Cα : α ∈A} is stationary, and it follows that there exists
a limit ordinal η such that the set S = {γ ∈Eℵ2
ℵ0 : γ is the ηth element of
some Cα} is stationary. As in Lemma 23.6, S does not reﬂect.
⊓⊔
Note that if every stationary S ⊂Eℵ2
ℵ0 reﬂects at almost every α ∈Eℵ2
ℵ1
then every two stationary sets S1, S2 ⊂Eℵ2
ℵ1 reﬂect at the same α. The
following lemma completes the proof:
Lemma 23.25. If for any stationary sets S1, S2 ⊂Eℵ2
ℵ0 there exists an
δ ∈Eℵ2
ℵ1 such that both S1 ∩δ and S2 ∩δ are stationary, then ℵ2 is Π1
1-
indescribable in L.
Proof. Let ϕ(X) be a second order formula with only ﬁrst order quantiﬁers
and assume that for each α < ω2 there exists some Xα ∈L, Xα ⊂α, such
that Lα ⊨ϕ(Xα). We shall ﬁnd an X ∈L, X ⊂ω2, such that Lω2 ⊨ϕ(X).

Let Xα be the least such Xα in L. There exists a β < (α+)L such that
Xα ∈Lβ, and let β be the least such β. Let Zα ∈L be such that Zα ∈{0, 1}α
and that Zα codes the model (Lβ, ∈, Xα).
For every δ < ω2 of coﬁnality of ω1, let
Cδ = {α < δ : Zα = Zδ↾α and Xα = Xδ↾α}.
The set Cδ is a closed unbounded subset of δ.
For each γ < ω2 and each t ∈L such that t ∈{0, 1}δ, let
St = {α ∈Eℵ2
ℵ0 : t ⊂Zα}.
Since ℵ2 is inaccessible in L, there exists for each γ < ω2 some t ∈{0, 1}γ
such that St is stationary. Now let γ1 ≤γ2 and ti ∈{0, 1}γi (i = 1, 2),
and assume that both St1 and St2 are stationary. By the assumption of the
lemma, there exists a δ < ω2 of coﬁnality ω1 such that both St1 ∩δ and
St2 ∩δ are stationary. Let α1, α2 ∈Cδ be such that αi ∈Sti (i = 1, 2). Since
ti ⊂Zαi ⊂Zδ, it follows that t1 ⊂t2.
Hence for each γ < κ there is a unique tγ such that Stγ contains almost all
ordinals in Eℵ2
ℵ0 ; Stγ ⊃Eℵ2
ℵ0 ∩Dγ with Dγ closed unbounded. Let D = △γ Dγ;
then for every α ∈Eℵ2
ℵ0 ∩D we have tα = Zα. Now let Z = {tγ : γ < ω2}.
The set Z codes some model (Lη, ∈, X) with X ⊂ω2 and X ∈L. It follows
that X ∩α = Xα for almost all α ∈Eℵ2
ℵ0 .
We ﬁnish the proof by verifying Lω2 ⊨ϕ(Xα). This holds because Lα ⊨
ϕ(Xα) for all α and therefore Lω2 ⊨ϕ(X ∩α) for almost all α ∈Eℵ2
ℵ0 .
⊓⊔
This completes the proof that the existence of a weakly compact cardinal
is necessary for the consistency of (ii). We shall not present the consistency
proof of (ii) and instead give a brief description of the methods involved.
One starts with a ground model where κ is a weakly compact cardinal,
and GCH holds. First one uses the L´evy collapse Q with countable conditions
that makes κ = ℵ2 (all cardinals between ℵ1 and κ are collapsed). In V Q,
one constructs a forcing iteration P of length κ+, with ℵ1-support. At every
stage α of the iteration, one considers (in V Q) a Pα-name for a stationary set
S ⊂Eκ
ω and shoots a closed unbounded set through the set T = Tr(S) ∪Eκ
ω.
Forcing conditions are closed bounded subsets of T . It is not diﬃcult to
verify that such forcing is ω-closed, and that the iteration satisﬁes the κ-
chain condition. Thus one can arrange the iteration so that every potential
stationary set S ⊂Eκ
ω is considered.
The main point of the proof is to show that ℵ1 is preserved by the iter-
ation, and that at each stage, if S ⊂Eκ
ω is stationary then Tr(S) ∩Eκ
ω1 is
unbounded. This is proved using arguments similar to those used in Theo-
rem 23.10.
Weak compactness of κ is used as follows: At a given stage α of the
iteration, there is a transitive model M ⊃α of size κ of a suﬃciently large
fragment of ZFC, and (by weak compactness) there is an elementary j :
M →N, cf. Lemma 17.17. This j extends to j : M Q →N j(Q).

24. The Singular Cardinal Problem
In this chapter we use combinatorial methods to prove theorems (in ZFC) on
cardinal arithmetic of singular cardinals. We introduce a powerful theory of
Shelah, the pcf theory, and apply the theory to present a most remarkable
result of Shelah on powers of singular cardinals.
The Galvin-Hajnal Theorem
Following Silver’s Theorem 8.12 on singular cardinals of uncountable coﬁnal-
ity, Galvin and Hajnal proved a related result:
Theorem 24.1 (Galvin-Hajnal [1975]). Let ℵα be a strong limit singular
cardinal of uncountable coﬁnality. Then 2ℵα < ℵγ where γ = (2|α|)+.
Note that the theorem gives a nontrivial information only if ℵα is not
a ﬁxed point of the aleph function.
In order to simplify the notation, we consider the special case α = ω1. The
following lemma implies the theorem (as in the proof of Silver’s Theorem).
Two functions f and g on ω1 are almost disjoint if {α : f(α) = g(α)} is at
most countable.
Lemma 24.2. Assume that ℵℵ1
α < ℵω1 for all α < ω1. Let F be an almost
disjoint family of functions
F ⊂

α<ω1
Aα
such that |Aα| < ℵω1 for all α < ω1. Then |F| < ℵγ where γ = (2ℵ1)+.
Proof. We ﬁrst introduce the following relation among functions ϕ : ω1 →ω1
(24.1)
ϕ < ψ
if and only if
{α < ω1 : ϕ(α) ≥ψ(α)} is nonstationary.
Since the closed unbounded ﬁlter is σ-complete, it follows that there is no
inﬁnite descending sequence
ϕ0 > ϕ1 > ϕ2 > . . . .

458
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Otherwise, the set {α < ω1 : ϕn(α) ≤ϕn+1(α) for some n} is nonstationary
and so there is an α such that
ϕ0(α) > ϕ1(α) > ϕ2(α) > . . . ,
a contradiction.
Hence the relation ϕ < ψ is well-founded and we can deﬁne the rank ∥ϕ∥
of ϕ in this relation (called the norm of ϕ) such that
∥ϕ∥= sup{∥ψ∥+ 1 : ψ < ϕ}.
Note that ∥ϕ∥= 0 if and only if ϕ(α) = 0 for a stationary set of α’s.
Lemma 24.2 follows from
Lemma 24.3. Assume that ℵℵ1
α < ℵω1 for all α < ω1. Let ϕ : ω1 →ω1 and
let F be an almost disjoint family of functions
F ⊂

α<ω1
Aα
such that
|Aα| ≤ℵα+ϕ(α)
for every α < ω1. Then |F| ≤ℵω1+∥ϕ∥.
To prove Lemma 24.2 from Lemma 24.3, we let ϕ be such that |Aα| ≤
ℵα+ϕ(α). If ϑ is the length of the well-founded relation ϕ < ψ, then certainly
|ϑ| ≤2ℵ1 and so ϑ < (2ℵ1)+. Hence ω1 + ∥ϕ∥< (2ℵ1)+ for every ϕ and
Lemma 24.2 follows.
⊓⊔
Proof of Lemma 24.3. By induction on ∥ϕ∥. If ∥ϕ∥= 0, then ϕ(α) = 0 on
a stationary set and the statement is precisely Lemma 8.16.
To handle the case ∥ϕ∥> 0, we ﬁrst generalize the deﬁnition of ϕ < ψ.
Let S ⊂ω1 be a stationary set. We deﬁne
(24.2)
ϕ <S ψ
if and only if
{α ∈S : ϕ(α) ≥ψ(α)} is nonstationary.
The same argument as before shows that ϕ <S ψ is a well-founded relation
and so we deﬁne the norm ∥ϕ∥S accordingly. Note that if S ⊂T , then ∥ϕ∥T ≤
∥ϕ∥S. In particular, ∥ϕ∥≤∥ϕ∥S, for any stationary S. Moreover,
(24.3)
∥ϕ∥S∪T = min{∥ϕ∥S, ∥ϕ∥T }
as can easily be veriﬁed.
For every ϕ : ω1 →ω1, we let Iϕ be the collection of all nonstationary
sets along with those stationary S such that ∥ϕ∥< ∥ϕ∥S. If S is stationary
and X is nonstationary, then ∥ϕ∥S∪X = ∥ϕ∥S. This and (24.3) imply that
Iϕ is a proper ideal on ω1.

24. The Singular Cardinal Problem
459
If ∥ϕ∥is a limit ordinal, then
S = {α < ω1 : ϕ(α) is a successor ordinal} ∈Iϕ
because if S /∈Iϕ, then ∥ϕ∥= ∥ϕ∥S = ∥ψ∥S + 1, where ψ(α) = ϕ(α) −1 for
all α ∈S. Hence
{α < ω1 : ϕ(α) is a limit ordinal} /∈Iϕ.
Similarly, if ∥ϕ∥is a successor ordinal, then
{α < ω1 : ϕ(α) is a successor ordinal} /∈Iϕ.
Now we are ready to proceed with the induction.
(a) Let ∥ϕ∥be a limit ordinal, ∥ϕ∥> 0. Let
S = {α < ω1 : ϕ(α) > 0 and is a limit ordinal}.
It follows that S /∈Iϕ.
We may assume that Aα ⊂ℵα+ϕ(α) for every α, and so we have f(α) <
ℵα+ϕ(α) for every f ∈F. Given f ∈F, we can ﬁnd for each α ∈S some β <
ϕ(α) such that f(α) < ωα+β; call this β = ψ(α). For α /∈S, let ψ(α) = ϕ(α).
Since S /∈Iϕ, we have ∥ψ∥≤∥ψ∥S < ∥ϕ∥S = ∥ϕ∥. We also have f ∈Fψ,
where
Fψ = {f ∈F : f(α) < ωα+ψ(α) for all α},
and so
F = {Fψ : ∥ψ∥< ∥ϕ∥}.
By the induction hypothesis, |Fψ| ≤ℵω1+∥ψ∥< ℵω1+∥ϕ∥for every ψ such
that ∥ψ∥< ∥ϕ∥. Since the number of functions ψ : ω1 →ω1 is 2ℵ1, and
2ℵ1 < ℵω1, we have |F| ≤ℵω1+∥ϕ∥.
(b) Let ∥ϕ∥be a successor ordinal, ∥ϕ∥= γ + 1. Let
S0 = {α < ω1 : ϕ(α) is a successor}.
It follows that S0 /∈Iϕ.
Again, we may assume that Aα ⊂ωα+ϕ(α) for each α < ω1. First we
prove that for every f ∈F, the set
Ff = {g ∈F : ∃S ⊂S0, S /∈Iϕ, (∀α ∈S) g(α) ≤f(α)}
has cardinality ℵω1+γ. If S ⊂S0 and S /∈Iϕ, let
Ff,S = {g ∈F : (∀α ∈S) g(α) ≤f(α)}.
Let ψ : ω1 →ω1 be such that ψ(α) = ϕ(α) −1 for α ∈S, and ψ(α) = ϕ(α)
otherwise. Since S /∈Iϕ, we have ∥ψ∥≤∥ψ∥S < ∥ϕ∥S = ∥ϕ∥= γ + 1 and so
∥ψ∥= γ. Since Ff,S ⊂
α<ω1 Bα, where |Bα| ≤ℵα+ψ(α) for all α, we use the

460
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
induction hypothesis to conclude that |Ff,S| ≤ℵω1+γ. Then it follows that
|Ff| ≤ℵω1+γ.
To complete the proof, we construct a sequence
(24.4)
⟨fξ : ξ < ϑ⟩
such that ϑ ≤ℵω1+γ+1 and
(24.5)
F = {Ffξ : ξ < ϑ}.
Given fν, ν < ξ, we let fξ ∈F (if it exists) be such that fξ /∈Ffν, for all
ν < ξ. Then the set
{α ∈S0 : fξ(α) ≤fν(α)}
belongs to Iϕ, and so fν ∈Ffξ, for each ν < ξ.
Since |Ffξ| ≤ℵω1+γ and Ffξ ⊃{fν : ν < ξ}, it follows that ξ < ℵω1+γ+1
if fξ exists. Thus the sequence (24.4) has length ϑ ≤ℵω1+γ+1. Then we have
F = {Ffξ : ξ < ϑ}
and so |F| ≤ℵω1+γ+1.
⊓⊔
Ordinal Functions and Scales
The proof of the Galvin-Hajnal Theorem suggests that ordinal functions play
an important role in arithmetic of singular cardinals. We shall now embark
on a systematic study of ordinal functions and introduce Shelah’s pcf theory.
Let A be an inﬁnite set and let I be an ideal on A.
Deﬁnition 24.4. For ordinal functions f, g on A, let
f =I g
if and only if
{a ∈A : f(a) ̸= g(a)} ∈I,
f ≤I g
if and only if
{a ∈A : f(a) > g(a)} ∈I,
f <I g
if and only if
{a ∈A : f(a) ≥g(a)} ∈I.
If F is a ﬁlter on A, then f <F g means f <I g where I is the dual ideal,
and similarly for f ≤F g and f =F g.
The relation ≤I is a partial ordering (of equivalence classes). If S is a set
of ordinal functions on A then g is an upper bound of S if f ≤I g for all
f ∈S, and g is a least upper bound of S if it is an upper bound and if g ≤I h
for every upper bound h.
The relation <I is also a partial ordering (diﬀerent from ≤I unless I is
a prime ideal), and if I is σ-complete then <I is well-founded. If I is the
nonstationary ideal on a regular uncountable cardinal κ, then the rank of an
ordinal function f on κ is the (Galvin-Hajnal) norm ∥f∥.
The following lemma shows that for every η < κ+ there is a canonical
function fη on κ of norm η:

24. The Singular Cardinal Problem
461
Lemma 24.5. Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal. There exist ordinal
functions fη, η < κ+, on κ such that
(i) f0(α) = 0 and fη+1(α) = fη(α) + 1, for all α < κ,
(ii) if η is a limit ordinal then fη is a least upper bound of {fξ : ξ < η}
in ≤INS.
The functions are unique up to =INS, and for every stationary set S ⊂κ,
∥fη∥S = η.
Proof. Let ⟨ξν : ν < cf η⟩be some sequence with limit η. If cf η < κ, let
fη(α) = sup{fξν(α) : ν < cf η}, and if cf η = κ, let fη(α) = sup{fξν(α) :
ν < α} (for every limit ordinal α), the diagonal limit of fξ, ξ < η.
⊓⊔
For η ≥κ+, canonical functions may or may not exist. The existence of fη
for all ordinals η is equiconsistent with a measurable cardinal. For the relation
between canonical functions and canonical stationary sets, see Exercise 24.10.
A subset A of a partially ordered set (P, <) is coﬁnal if for every p ∈P
there exists some a ∈A such that p ≤a. The coﬁnality of (P, <) is the small-
est size of a coﬁnal set (it need not be a regular cardinal—see Exercise 24.11).
The true coﬁnality of (P, <) is the least cardinality of a coﬁnal chain (if it
exists—see Exercise 24.12). The true coﬁnality is a regular cardinal (or 1 if
P has a greatest element).
Consider again an inﬁnite set A, an ideal I on A, and an indexed set
{γa : a ∈A} of limit ordinals.
Deﬁnition 24.6. A scale in 
a∈A γa is a <I-increasing transﬁnite sequence
⟨fα : α < λ⟩of functions in 
a∈A γa that is coﬁnal in 
a∈A γa in the partial
ordering <I.
If 
a∈A γa has a λ-scale (i.e., a scale of length λ) and λ is a regular
cardinal then it has true coﬁnality λ, and is λ-directed, i.e., every set B ⊂

a∈A γa of size < γ has an upper bound. The ordinal function ⟨γa : a ∈A⟩
is the least upper bound of 
a∈A γa; moreover, it is an exact upper bound:
Deﬁnition 24.7. In a partially ordered set (P, <), g is an exact upper bound
of a set S if S is coﬁnal in the set {f ∈P : f < g}.
The following theorem is a precursor of the pcf theory. We note that the
pcf theory shows, among others, that diﬀerent sequences ⟨λn : n < ω⟩with
the same limit will generally result in diﬀerent coﬁnalities of 
n<ω λn.
Theorem 24.8 (Shelah). Let κ be a strong limit cardinal of coﬁnality ω.
There exists an increasing sequence ⟨λn : n < ω⟩of regular cardinals with
limit κ such that the true coﬁnality of 
n<ω λn modulo the ideal of ﬁnite
sets is equal to κ+.

462
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Proof. Let I be the ideal of ﬁnite subsets of ω. We shall ﬁnd the λn’s and
a κ+-scale in 
n λn in the partial ordering <I.
First we choose any increasing sequence κn, n < ω, of regular cardinals
with limit κ. As every subset of 
n<ω κn of size κ has an upper bound in
(
n<ω κn, <I), we can construct inductively a <I-increasing κ+-sequence
F = ⟨fξ : ξ < κ+⟩of functions in 
n κn.
Lemma 24.9. There exists a function g : ω →κ that is an upper bound of F
in <I, and is ≤I-minimal among such upper bounds.
Proof. Let g0 = ⟨κn : n < ω⟩; we shall construct a maximal transﬁnite ≤I-
decreasing sequence ⟨gν⟩ν of upper bounds of F. It suﬃces to show that the
length of the sequence ⟨gν⟩ν is not a limit ordinal: Then the last function is
≤I-minimal.
Thus let ϑ be a limit ordinal, and let ⟨gν : ν < ϑ⟩be a ≤I-decreasing
sequence of upper bounds for F. We shall ﬁnd a function g such that g >I fξ
for all ξ < κ+, and g ≤I gν for all ν < ϑ.
First we claim that |ϑ| ≤2ℵ0. Thus assume that |ϑ| ≥(2ℵ0)+ and consider
the partition G : [ϑ]2 →ω deﬁned as follows (for α < β):
G(α, β) = the least n such that gα(n) > gβ(n).
By the Erd˝os-Rado Partition Theorem 9.6 there exists an inﬁnite set of or-
dinals α0 < α1 < α2 < . . . such that for some n, gα0(n) > gα1(n) > gα2(n) >
. . ., a contradiction.
Let A = 
ν<ϑ ran(gν) and let S = Aω. Since |ϑ| ≤2ℵ0, we have |S| ≤2ℵ0.
For every g ∈S, if g is not an upper bound for F, let ξg be such that fξg ̸<I g.
Since |S| ≤2ℵ0, there is some η < κ+ greater than all the ξg’s. Now let
g(n) = the least γ ∈A such that γ > fη(n).
The function g is an upper bound for F: If not then fξg ̸<I g but fξg <I
fη <I g. We complete the proof of the lemma by showing that g ≤I gν for
all ν < ϑ. If ν < ϑ then gν(n) > fη(n) for all but ﬁnitely many n and, since
gν(n) ∈A, we have gν ≥g.
⊓⊔
Let g be the function given by Lemma 24.9. We claim that g is an exact
upper bound of F. If not, let f <I g be such that f ̸<I fξ for all ξ. For
each ξ < κ+, let Aξ be the inﬁnite set of all n such that f(n) > fξ(n).
Since 2ℵ0 < κ, there exists an inﬁnite set A, such that for κ+ many ξ’s,
f(n) > fξ(n) for all a ∈A. It follows that f↾A >I fξ↾A for every ξ < κ+,
and therefore the function g′ = f↾A∪g↾(ω −A) ≤I g is an upper bound of F
but g′ ̸=I g, a contradiction.
Now, if g is increasing with limit κ and if every g(n) is a regular cardinal,
then we let λn = g(n) and are done. In general, all but ﬁnitely many g(n) are
limit ordinals; without loss of generality, all are. For each n, let Yn be a closed
unbounded subset of g(n) whose order-type is a regular cardinal γa. Note that

supn γn = κ; otherwise, | 
n Yn| < κ and hence bounded by some fξ. So let
⟨λn : n < ω⟩= ⟨γkn : n < ω⟩be an increasing subsequence of ⟨γn⟩n.
For each f ∈F, let hf be the function
hf(n) = the least α ∈Ykn such that α ≥f(kn).
and let H = {hf : f ∈F}. For every f ∈
n Yn there exists some h ∈H such
that f <I h. Also, |H| = κ+ since every smaller set of functions is bounded
by some fξ. Thus we can ﬁnd in H a <I-increasing transﬁnite sequence
⟨hξ : ξ < κ+⟩such that for every f ∈
n Yn, there is a ξ with f <I hξ.
By copying 
n Yn onto 
n λn, we get a sequence ⟨hξ : ξ < κ+⟩with the
required properties.
⊓⊔
As an application of Theorem 24.8 we give a short proof of Kunen’s The-
orem 17.7, due to Zapletal [1996].
Assume that j : V →M is elementary, with critical point κ, and let
λ = limn jn(κ). As λ is a strong limit cardinal of coﬁnality ω, let ⟨λn : n < ω⟩
be an increasing sequence of regular cardinals with limit λ such that κ < λ0
and that 
n λn has a λ+-scale F = ⟨fξ : ξ < λ+⟩(modulo ﬁnite). Since
j(λ) = λ, we have j(λ+) = λ+, and j(F) is a λ+-scale in 
n j(λn).
Since j“λ+ is coﬁnal in j(λ+) = λ+, j“F is coﬁnal in j(F) and thus
in 
n j(λn). However, let g ∈
n j(λn) be the function g(n) = sup j“λn;
we have g(n) < j(λn) because j(λn) is regular. If f ∈
n λn then g >
j(f) pointwise because j(f) = j“f. Hence g is an upper bound for j“F,
a contradiction.
⊓⊔
Toward the pcf theory, we shall now prove several results on ordinal func-
tions and scales. Let I be an ideal on A.
Lemma 24.10. If λ > 2|A| is a regular cardinal then every <I-increasing
λ-sequence of ordinal functions on A has an exact upper bound.
Proof. Let F = ⟨fα : α < λ⟩be <I-increasing. Let M be an elementary
submodel of Hϑ for a suﬃciently large ϑ such that I ∈M, F ∈M, |M| = 2|A|
and M |A| ⊂M. For every α, let
gα(a) = the least β ∈M such that β ≥fα(a)
(a ∈A).
Since M |A| ⊂M, we have gα ∈M, and since |M| < λ, there exists some
f ∈M such that f = gα for λ many α’s. Since ⟨fα⟩α is increasing and f ≥I fα
for λ many α’s, f is an upper bound of F.
To show that whenever h <I f then h <I fα for some α, it is enough to
show this for every h ∈M. Thus let h ∈M be such that h <I f.
Let α be any α such that f = gα. For every a ∈A such that h(a) < gα(a)
we necessarily have h(a) < fα(a) because h(a) ∈M and gα(a) is the least
β ∈M such that β ≥fα(a). Hence h <I fα.
⊓⊔

If F is a set of ordinal functions on A and g is an upper bound of F, then
we say that F is bounded below g if it has an upper bound h <I g; F is coﬁnal
in g if it is coﬁnal in 
a∈A g(a). If X ∈I+ then f <I g on X, etc., means
f <I↾X g where I↾X is the ideal generated by I ∪{A −X}.
Corollary 24.11. If λ > 2|A| is regular, F = ⟨fα : α < λ⟩is <I-increasing
and g is an upper bound of F, then either F is bounded below g, or F is
coﬁnal in g, or A = X ∪Y with X, Y ∈I+ such that F is bounded below g
on X and is coﬁnal in g on Y .
Proof. Let f be an exact upper bound of F and let X = {a ∈A : f(a) <
g(a)}.
⊓⊔
Corollary 24.12. Let λ > 2|A| be a regular cardinal, let γa, a ∈A, be
limit ordinals, and assume that 
a∈A γa is λ-directed in <I. Then either

a∈A γa is λ+-directed, or has a λ-scale, or A = X ∪Y with X, Y ∈I+ such
that 
a∈A γa has a λ-scale on X and is λ+-directed on Y .
Proof. Assume that 
a∈A γa is λ-directed but not λ+-directed, and let S ⊂

a∈A γa be such that |S| = λ and S is not bounded. Using the λ-directness,
we construct an increasing sequence F = ⟨fα : α < λ⟩such that for every
f ∈S, there exists an α < λ such that f <I fα. As F is not bounded, there
exists some Z ∈I+ such that F is a scale on Z.
Now let Z be the collection of all Z ∈I+ that have a λ-scale, and for
each Z ∈Z let ⟨f Z
α : α < λ⟩be a λ-scale on Z. Let S = {f Z
α : α < λ,
Z ∈Z}; since 2|A| = λ, we have |S| = λ, and we can construct an increasing
λ-sequence F = ⟨fα : α < λ⟩such that for every f ∈S there is an α < λ
with f ≤I fα.
Either F is a scale, or A = X ∪Y such that F is bounded on X and coﬁnal
on Y . To complete the proof, we show that 
a∈A γa is λ+-directed; i.e., that
for every set of size λ is bounded on X. If not, we repeat the argument above
and ﬁnd a Z ⊂X that has a scale. This contradicts the fact that S is bounded
on X.
⊓⊔
Deﬁnition 24.13. Let F = ⟨fα : α < λ⟩, λ regular, be a <I-increasing
sequence of ordinal functions on A and let γ < λ be a regular uncountable
cardinal. F is γ-rapid if for every β < λ of coﬁnality γ there exists a closed
unbounded set C ⊂β such that for every limit ordinal α < β, fα >I sC∩α,
where sC∩α is the pointwise supremum of {fξ(a) : ξ ∈C ∩α}:
sC∩α(a) = sup{fξ(a) : ξ ∈C ∩α}
(a ∈A).
Lemma 24.14. Let F = ⟨fα : α < λ⟩be γ-rapid, with γ > |A|. For each
a ∈A, let Sa ⊂λ be such that |Sa| < γ. Then there exists an α < λ with the
property that for every h ∈
a∈A Sa, if h >I fα, then h is an upper bound
of F.

24. The Singular Cardinal Problem
465
Proof. Assume by contradiction that for every α < λ there exists an
h ∈
a∈A Sa such that h >I fα but h is not an upper bound of F. By
induction, we construct a continuous increasing sequence αξ, ξ < γ, and
functions hξ ∈
a∈A Sa such that for every ξ, fαξ <I hξ and fαξ+1 ≰I hξ.
Let β = limξ→γ αξ.
As F is γ-rapid, there exists a closed unbounded C ⊂β such that fα >I
sC∩α for every α ∈C. We may assume that αξ ∈C for every ξ < γ (otherwise
replace {αξ}ξ<γ by its intersection with C).
For each ξ < γ we have sC∩αξ <I fαξ <I hξ ≱I fαξ+1 and so there exists
some aξ ∈A such that
sC∩αξ(aξ) < fαξ(aξ) < hξ(aξ) < fαξ+1(aξ).
As γ > |A|, there exist a set Z ⊂γ of size γ and some a ∈A such that aξ = a
for all ξ ∈Z. Now if ξ and η are in Z, such that ξ+1 < η, then αξ+1 ∈C ∩αη
and we have
hξ(a) < fαξ+1(a) ≤sC∩αη(a) < hη(a).
This is a contradiction because |Sa| < γ while |Z| = γ.
⊓⊔
Corollary 24.15. If F = ⟨fα : α < λ⟩is γ-rapid, with |A| < γ < λ, and if
f is the least upper bound of F, then cf f(a) ≥γ for I-almost all a ∈A.
Proof. Let f be an upper bound of F, and assume that B = {a ∈A :
cf f(a) < γ} ∈I+. We shall ﬁnd an upper bound h of F such that h <I f
on B.
For a ∈B, let Sa be a coﬁnal subset of f(a) of size < γ. By Lemma 24.14
there is an α < λ such that for every h ∈
a∈B Sa, h >I fα on B implies
that h is an upper bound of F on B. Given this α, we consider a function
h ∈
a∈B Sa as follows: If fα(a) < f(a), let h(a) ∈Sa be such that fα(a) <
h(a) < f(a). The function h is an upper bound of F on B, and h <I f
on B.
⊓⊔
Theorem 24.16 (Shelah). Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal, and let
I = INS be the nonstationary ideal on κ. Let ⟨ηξ : ξ < κ⟩be a continuous
increasing sequence with limit η. Then 
ξ<κ ℵηξ+1 has true coﬁnality ℵη+1
(in <I).
We shall prove this theorem only under the assumption 2κ < ℵη (we only
need the weaker version for the proof of Theorem 24.33). For the general
proof, see Burke and Magidor [1990].
Proof. Let λ = ℵη+1. We wish to ﬁnd a λ-scale. It is not diﬃcult to see that

ξ<κ ℵηξ+1 is λ-directed. By Corollary 24.12 (as we assume 2κ < λ), if there
is no λ-scale then there is a stationary set S ⊂κ such that 
ξ∈S ℵηξ+1 is
λ+-directed.
We shall construct a <I-increasing λ-sequence in 
ξ∈S ℵηξ+1 that is γ-
rapid for all regular γ < ℵη. For every limit ordinal β < λ, let Cβ ⊂β be

466
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
closed unbounded, of size cf β. We construct F = ⟨fα : α < λ⟩by induction.
Let α be a limit ordinal. For each limit β > α, let sβ be the pointwise
supremum of {fν : ν ∈Cβ ∩α}. For eventually all ξ < κ, sν(ξ) < ℵηξ+1, so
sν ∈
ξ∈S ℵηξ+1. Since 
ξ∈S ℵηξ+1 is λ+-directed, we can ﬁnd fα so that
fα >I sβ on S for all limit β < λ. This guarantees that F is γ-rapid for every
regular uncountable γ < λ.
By Lemma 24.10, F has an exact upper bound g, and without loss of
generality, g(ξ) ≤ℵηξ+1 for all ξ ∈S. We claim that g(ξ) ≥ℵηξ+1 for almost
all ξ ∈S, and hence F is a scale on S, contrary to the assumption on S. If
g(ξ) < ℵηξ+1 for stationary many ξ, then cf g(ξ) < ℵηξ, and hence for some
γ < ℵη+1, cf g(ξ) < γ for stationary many ξ. This contradicts Corollary 24.15,
as F is γ-rapid for all γ < λ.
⊓⊔
The pcf Theory
Shelah’s pcf theory is the theory of possible coﬁnalities of ultraproducts of
sets of regular cardinals. Let A be a set of regular cardinals, and let D be
an ultraﬁlter on A.  A = 
a∈A{a : a ∈A} denotes the product {f :
dom(f) = A and f(a) ∈a}; the ultraproduct  A/D is linearly ordered, and
cof D = cof  A/D is its coﬁnality.
Deﬁnition 24.17. If A is a set of regular cardinals, then
pcf A = {cof D : D is an ultraﬁlter on A}.
The set pcf A is a set of regular cardinals, includes A (for every a ∈A
consider the principal ultraﬁlter given by a), has cardinality at most 22|A|
and satisﬁes pcf(A1 ∪A2) = pcf A1 ∪pcf A2.
We shall investigate the structure of pcf in the next section. In this section
we explore the relation between pcf and cardinal arithmetic. Instead of the
general theory we concentrate on the special case when A = {ℵn}∞
n=0. We
prove the following theorem:
Theorem 24.18 (Shelah). If ℵω is a strong limit cardinal then
max(pcf{ℵn}∞
n=0) = 2ℵω.
A stronger theorem is true: If 2ℵ0 < ℵω then max(pcf{ℵn}∞
n=0) = ℵℵ0
ω ;
again, we refer the reader to Burke and Magidor [1990].
We say that a set of regular cardinals A is an interval if it contains every
regular λ such that min A ≤λ < sup A.
Lemma 24.19. Let A be an interval of regular cardinals such that min A =
(2|A|)+. Then pcf A is an interval.

24. The Singular Cardinal Problem
467
Proof. Let D be an ultraﬁlter on A and let λ be a regular cardinal such that
min A ≤λ < cof D. We shall ﬁnd an ultraﬁlter E on A such that cof E = λ.
Let {fα : α < cof D} be a D-increasing sequence in  A. Since λ > 2|A|,
the sequence has a least upper bound g in ≤D (by Lemma 24.10). For each
a ∈A let h(a) = cf g(a) and let Sa be a coﬁnal subset of g(a) of order-
type h(a). It is easy to see that 
a∈A Sa/D has an increasing λ-sequence
coﬁnal in g, and hence 
a∈A h(a)/D has a coﬁnal sequence {hα : α < λ}.
For D-almost all a, h(a) > 2|A|: This is because the number of functions
from A into 2|A| is less than λ. Thus we may assume that h(a) ∈A for all
a ∈A. Let E be the ultraﬁlter on A deﬁned by
E = {X ⊂A : h−1(X) ∈D}.
We now construct, by induction on α, functions gα, α < λ, such that the
sequence {gα ◦h : α < λ} is D-increasing and coﬁnal in h. Then {gα : α < λ}
is E-increasing and coﬁnal in  A/E.
⊓⊔
Corollary 24.20. If ℵω is a strong limit cardinal, then pcf{ℵn}∞
n=0 is an
interval and sup pcf{ℵn}∞
n=0 < ℵℵω.
Proof. Apply Lemma 24.19 to the interval A = [(2ℵ0)+, ℵω), and use
| pcf A| ≤22ℵ0 < ℵω.
⊓⊔
Toward the proof of Theorem 24.18, we assume that ℵω is strong limit
and let
λ = sup pcf{ℵn}∞
n=0.
We shall show that 2ℵω = λ. Since cf 2ℵω > ℵω (by K¨onig’s Theorem) and
λ < ℵℵω, it follows that 2ℵω is a successor cardinal, and therefore 2ℵω =
max(pcf{ℵn}∞
n=0).
Lemma 24.21. There exists a family F of functions in ∞
n=0 ℵn, |F| = λ,
such that for every g ∈∞
n=0 ℵn there is some f ∈F with g(n) ≤f(n) for
all n.
Proof. For every ultraﬁlter D on ω choose a sequence ⟨f D
α : α < cof D⟩that
is coﬁnal in ∞
n=0 ℵn/D, and let F be the set of all f = max{f D1
α1 , . . . , f Dm
αm }
where {D1, . . . , Dm} is a ﬁnite set of ultraﬁlters and {α1, . . . , αm} a ﬁnite set
of ordinals. Since λ > ℵω > 22ℵ0, we have |F| = λ.
Assume, by contradiction, that there is a g ∈∞
n=0 ℵn that is not ma-
jorized by any f ∈F. Thus if we let, for every D and every α, XD
α = {n :
g(n) > f D
α (n)}, then the family {XD
α }α,D has the ﬁnite intersection property,
and so extends to an ultraﬁlter U. Then g <U f U
α for some α, a contradic-
tion.
⊓⊔
Let us ﬁx such a family F of size λ, and let k < ω be such that 2ℵ0 ≤ℵk
and λ < ℵℵk. Let ϑ be suﬃciently large, and consider elementary submodels of

468
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
(Hϑ, ∈, <) where < is some well-ordering of Hϑ. For every countable subset a
of ℵω we shall construct an elementary chain of models M a
α, of length ωk.
Each M a
α will have size ℵk and will be such that M a
α ⊃a ∪ωk.
We choose M a
0 of size ℵk so that M a
0 ⊃a∪ωk. If α < ωk is a limit ordinal,
we let M a
α = 
β<α M a
β. Given M a
α, we ﬁnd M a
α+1 as follows. Let
(24.6)
χa
α(n) = sup(M a
α ∩ωn)
(all n > k),
the characteristic function of M a
α. There exists a function f a
α ∈F such that
f a
α(n) ≥χa
α(n) for all n > k; let M a
α+1 be such that f a
α ∈M a
α+1.
Then we let M a = 
α<ωk M a
α, and
χa(n) = sup(M a ∩ωn)
(all n > k).
Lemma 24.22. If a and b are countable subsets of ℵω and if χa = χb, then
M a ∩ℵω = M b ∩ℵω.
Proof. By induction on n we show that M a ∩ℵn = M b ∩ℵn, for all n ≥k.
This is true for n = k; thus assume that this is true for n and prove it for
n + 1. Both M a ∩ℵn+1 and M b ∩ℵn+1 contain a closed unbounded subset of
the ordinal χa(n + 1) = χb(n + 1) (of coﬁnality ℵk), and so there is a coﬁnal
subset C of this ordinal such that C ⊂M a and C ⊂M b. For every γ ≥ωn
in C there is a one-to-one function π that maps ωn onto γ. If we let π be the
≺-least such function in Hϑ, then π is both in M a and in M b. It follows that
γ ∩M a = γ ∩M b. Consequently, ωn+1 ∩M a = ωn+1 ∩M b and the lemma
follows.
⊓⊔
We shall complete the proof of Theorem 24.18 by showing that the set
{χa : a ⊂ℵω countable} has size at most λ. Since each M a has ℵk countable
subsets it will follow that there are at most λ countable subsets of ℵω, and
therefore 2ℵω = λ.
For each a and each n we have
χa(n) = supα<ωk χa
α(n) = supα<ωk f a
α(n).
If S is any subset of ωk of size ℵk, then χa(n) = sup{f a
α(n) : α ∈S} and so
the set {f a
α : α ∈S} determines χa.
Lemma 24.23. There exists a family Fλ of λ subsets of λ, each of size ℵk,
such that for every subset Z ⊂λ of size ℵk there exists an X ∈Fλ such that
X ⊂Z.
Proof. We prove (by induction on α) that for every ordinal α such that
2ℵk ≤α ≤λ there is a family Fα ⊂[α]ℵk, |Fα| ≤|α| such that for every
Z ∈[α]ℵk there is an X ∈Fα such that X ⊂Z. This is true for α = 2ℵk. If
α is not a cardinal, then Fα can be obtained by a one-to-one transformation
from F|α|. If α is a cardinal then since α ≤λ < ℵℵk, we have cf α ̸= ℵk, and
it follows that Fα = 
β<α Fβ has the required property.
⊓⊔

24. The Singular Cardinal Problem
469
Now we complete the proof of Theorem 24.18. For each countable subset a
of ℵω let Za = {f a
α : α < ωk}; each Za is a subset of F, and |Z| = ℵk. Apply
Lemma 24.23 to the set F (instead of λ) and obtain a family Fλ ⊂[F]ℵk such
that for each a there exists some X ∈Fλ such that X ⊂Z. Since |X| = ℵk,
X determines χa. It follows that |{χa : a ⊂ℵω countable}| ≤λ.
⊓⊔
The Structure of pcf
Let A be a set of regular cardinals and let pcf A denote the set of all possible
coﬁnalities of  A. First we mention some facts about pcf:
(i) A ⊂pcf A.
(ii) If A1 ⊂A2 then pcf A1 ⊂pcf A2.
(iii) pcf(A1 ∪A2) = pcf A1 ∪pcf A2.
(iv) | pcf A| ≤22|A|.
(v) sup pcf A ≤|  A|.
(24.7)
In Lemma 24.19 we showed:
(vi) If A is an interval and 2|A| < min A then pcf A is an interval.
This is true in general, under the assumption |A| < min A (see Shelah [1994]).
In the following Lemma 24.24 we prove
(vii) If | pcf A| < min A then pcf(pcf A) = pcf A.
Finally, Theorem 24.18 is true in general, and under weaker assumptions; we
state this without a proof.
(viii) If A is an interval without a greatest element and (min A)|A| <
sup A, then (sup A)|A| = max pcf A.
For proof, see e.g. Burke and Magidor [1990].
Lemma 24.24. If | pcf A| < min A then pcf(pcf A) = pcf A.
Proof. Let B = pcf A. For each λ ∈B choose Dλ on A such that cof Dλ = λ,
and let ⟨f λ
α : α < λ⟩be coﬁnal in  A/Dλ. Let µ ∈pcf B; choose D on B
with cof D = µ, and let ⟨gα : α < µ⟩be coﬁnal in  B/D. Let
E = {X ⊂A : {λ ∈B : X ∈Dλ} ∈D}.
E is an ultraﬁlter on A and we shall show that cof E = µ, thus proving
µ ∈pcf A, and hence pcf B = B.

470
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
For every α < µ, let
hα(a) = supλ∈B f λ
gα(λ)(a)
(all a ∈A).
Since min A > |B|, we have hα(a) < a for all a ∈A. We will show that for
each h ∈ A, eventually all hα are ≥E h. The we can ﬁnd a subsequence of
⟨hα : α < µ⟩that is coﬁnal in  A/E.
Let h ∈ A. For each λ ∈B there exists a g(λ) < λ such that h <Dλ
f λ
g(λ). For eventually all α < µ we have g <D gα, and we claim that whenever
g <D gα then h <E hα.
Let α be such that g <D gα. Let X = {a ∈A : h(a) < hα(a)}. If λ is such
that g(λ) < gα(λ) then for Dλ-almost all a, h(a) < f λ
g(λ)(a) < f λ
gα(λ)(a) ≤
hα(a) and hence a ∈X. Thus X ∈Dλ for D-almost all λ, and so X ∈E.
⊓⊔
The fundamental theorem of the pcf theory is the following.
Theorem 24.25 (Shelah). If A is a set of regular cardinals such that 2|A| <
min A, then there exist sets Bλ ⊂A, λ ∈pcf A, such that for every λ ∈pcf A
(a) λ = max pcf Bλ.
(b) λ /∈pcf(A −Bλ).
(c) {a : a ∈Bλ} has a λ-scale mod Jλ where Jλ is the ideal generated
by the sets Bν, ν < λ.
(To see that Jλ is an ideal, we observe that if X ∈Jλ then X ⊂Bν1 ∪
. . . ∪Bνk, hence pcf X ⊂pcf Bν1 ∪. . . ∪pcf Bνk and so by (a), λ /∈pcf X.
Hence X ̸= A.)
The theorem is true under the weaker assumption |A| < min A; see She-
lah [1994] or Burke and Magidor [1990].
Note that (a) and (b) can be formulated as follows:
(a) For every ultraﬁlter D on Bλ, cof D ≤λ; and there exists some D
on Bλ such that cof D = λ.
(b) For every ultraﬁlter D on A, if cof D = λ then Bλ ∈D.
The sets Bλ, λ ∈pcf A, are called the generators of pcf A. It follows from
(a) and (b) that the coﬁnality of an ultraﬁlter on A is determined by which
generators it contains:
(24.8)
cof D = the least λ such that Bλ ∈D.
Corollary 24.26. If 2|A| < min A then | pcf A| ≤2|A|.
Proof. The number of generators is at most 2|A|.
⊓⊔
Corollary 24.27. If ℵω is strong limit then 2ℵω < ℵ(2ℵ0 )+.
Proof. Corollary 24.26, Corollary 24.20 and Theorem 24.18.
⊓⊔

24. The Singular Cardinal Problem
471
Corollary 24.28. If 2|A| < min A then pcf A has a greatest element.
Proof. Assume that pcf A does not have a greatest element. Then the set
{A −Bλ : λ ∈pcf A} has the ﬁnite intersection property, and so extends to
an ultraﬁlter D. By (b), Bcof D ∈D, a contradiction.
⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 24.25. We shall apply the results on ordinal functions
proved earlier in this chapter. If I is an ideal on a set A of regular cardi-
nals then we say that I has a λ-scale if  A has a λ-scale in <I; similarly,
we say that I is λ-directed if  A is λ-directed in ≤I.
We construct the generators Bλ by induction, so that for each cardinal κ ≤
sup pcf A the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(i) the ideal Jκ generated by {Bλ : λ < κ and λ ∈pcf A} is κ-
directed;
(ii) if κ /∈pcf A then Jκ is κ+-directed;
(iii) if κ ∈pcf A and κ is not a maximal element of pcf A then there
exists a Bκ ∈J+
κ such that Jκ has a κ-scale on Bκ and Jκ[Bκ],
the ideal generated by Jκ ∪{Bκ}, is a κ+-directed ideal;
(iv) if κ = max(pcf A) then Jκ has a κ-scale on A (and we let
Bκ = A).
(24.9)
If the conditions (24.9) are satisﬁed, then the sets Bλ satisfy Theorem 24.25:
To prove (a), let λ ∈pcf A. Choose an ultraﬁlter D on Bλ that extends
the dual ﬁlter of Jλ. Jλ has a λ-scale on Bλ, and this scale is also a scale
for <D; therefore cof D = λ, and so λ ∈pcf Bλ. Also, if D is any ultraﬁlter
on Bλ, then either D ∩Jλ = ∅in which case cof D = λ, or else there is some
ν < λ such that Bν ∈D. If ν is the least such ν then D is an ultraﬁlter on Bν
and D ∩Jν = ∅. Since Jν has a ν-scale on Bν, we have cof D = ν. In either
case, cof D ≤λ.
To prove (b), let D be an ultraﬁlter on A such that Bλ /∈D; we claim
that cof D ̸= λ. Either D ∋Bλ for some ν < λ in which case cof D < λ, or
else D ∩Jλ[Bλ] ̸= ∅, and since Jλ[Bλ] is λ+-directed, D is λ+-directed, and
we have cof D > λ.
Finally, (c) follows from (24.9)(iii) and (iv). We prove (24.9) by induction
on κ ≤sup pcf A:
(i) If κ ≤min A then Jκ = {∅} is κ-directed. If κ is a limit cardinal, then
Jκ = 
λ<κ Jλ and the claim follows easily. If κ = λ+ then either λ /∈pcf A
and Jκ = Jλ is λ+-directed by (ii), or λ ∈pcf A and Jκ = Jλ[Bλ] is λ+-
directed by (iii).
(ii) Let κ /∈pcf A and κ ≥min A; hence κ > 2|A|. If κ is singular,
then it is easy to see that since Jκ is κ-directed, it is κ+-directed. If κ is
regular, assume by contradiction that Jκ is κ-directed but not κ+-directed.
By Corollary 24.12, Jκ has a κ-scale on some X ∈J+
κ . Let D be any ultraﬁlter
on X such that D∩Jκ = ∅. Then cof D = κ and so κ ∈pcf A, a contradiction.

(iii) Let κ ∈pcf A be such that κ < sup pcf A. We claim that Jκ is not
κ+-directed and that Jκ does not have a κ-scale on A. Then a Bκ exists by
Corollary 24.12. Assume by contradiction that Jκ is κ+-directed, and let D
be any ultraﬁlter on A. If D ∋Bλ for some λ < κ, then cof D < κ. Otherwise,
D ∩Jκ = ∅and since Jκ is κ+-directed, D is κ+-directed and so cof D > κ.
In either case cof D ̸= κ, hence κ /∈pcf A, a contradiction.
Now assume that Jκ does have a κ-scale on A. Then for every ultraﬁlter D
on A, either D ∋Bλ for some λ < κ, and then cof D < κ, or D ∩Jκ = ∅, so
D has a κ-scale and cof D = κ. Hence κ = max(pcf A), a contradiction.
(iv) Let κ = max(pcf A) and again assume, by contradiction, that Jκ does
not have a scale on A. Then by Corollary 24.12 there exists a Y ∈J+
κ such
that Jκ[Y ] is κ+-directed. If D is any ultraﬁlter on A such that D∩Jκ[Y ] = ∅
then <D is κ+-directed and so cof D > κ. Hence κ is not the maximal element
of pcf A, a contradiction.
⊓⊔
The same argument that shows that pcf A has a greatest element yields
the following property of pcf, called compactness:
Corollary 24.29. Let Bλ, λ ∈pcf A, be generators of pcf A. For every X ⊂
A there exists a ﬁnite set {ν1, . . . , νk} ⊂pcf X such that X ⊂Bν1 ∪. . .∪Bνk.
Proof. Assume the contrary. Then {X −Bν : ν ∈pcf X} has the ﬁnite
intersection property and there exists an ultraﬁlter D on X such that Bν /∈
D for all ν ∈pcf X. If λ = cof D then Bλ ∈D by Theorem 24.25(b),
a contradiction.
⊓⊔
We conclude this section with the following improvement of Theorem
24.16:
Corollary 24.30. Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal, and let ℵη be
a singular cardinal of coﬁnality κ such that 2κ < ℵη. Then there is a closed
unbounded set C
⊂η such that max(pcf{ℵα+1 : α ∈C}) = ℵη+1;

α∈C ℵα+1 has true coﬁnality ℵη+1 mod I where I is the ideal of all bounded
subsets of C.
Proof. Let C0 be any closed unbounded subset of η of order-type κ such that
2κ < ℵα0 where α0 = min C0. Let A0 = {ℵα+1 : α ∈C0}, let λ = ℵη+1, and
let Bλ be a generator for pcf A0, for this λ (by Theorem 24.16, λ ∈pcf A0).
Let X = {α ∈C0 : ℵα+1 ∈Bλ}. If D is any ultraﬁlter on C0 that extends
the closed unbounded ﬁlter, then by Theorem 24.16, cof 
α∈C0 ℵα+1/D = λ,
and by Theorem 24.25(b), X ∈D. Thus X contains a closed unbounded
set C. Let A = {ℵα+1 : α ∈C}. By Theorem 24.25(a), max(pcf A) ≤λ, and
therefore = λ.
Now let Bν, ν ≤λ, denote the generators of pcf A. Every Bν for ν < λ is
a bounded subset of A and so the ideal of all bounded subsets of A extends Jλ,
the ideal generated by the Bν, ν < λ. Thus 
α∈C ℵα+1/I has a λ-scale.
⊓⊔

24. The Singular Cardinal Problem
473
Transitive Generators and Localization
Let A be a set of regular cardinals with 2|A| < min A, let Bλ, λ ∈pcf A,
be generators for pcf A, and let Jκ be, for each κ ≤max(pcf A), the ideal
generated by {Bλ : λ < κ}. The following shows that the ideals Jκ are
independent of the choice of generators for pcf A:
(24.10)
For every X ⊂A, X ∈Jκ if and only if cof D < κ for every
ultraﬁlter D on X.
To see this, note ﬁrst that if X ∈Jκ then X ⊂Bν1 ∪. . . ∪Bνk for some
ν1, . . . , νk < κ, and so max(pcf X) < κ. Conversely, if X /∈Jκ then the set
{X −Bλ : λ < κ} has the ﬁnite intersection property, and so there exists an
ultraﬁlter D on X such that Bλ /∈D for all λ < κ. By Theorem 24.25(b),
cof D ≥κ. Each generator Bλ is uniquely determined up to equivalence
mod Jλ; if B is any set such that B △Bλ ∈Jλ, then B also satisﬁes (a)
and (b) of Theorem 24.25. To see this, note that by (24.10), if X △Y ∈Jλ
then pcf X −λ = pcf Y −λ; thus max pcf B = λ and λ /∈pcf(A −B).
We shall now produce generators for pcf that are transitive:
Lemma 24.31 (Transitive Generators). Let A be a set of regular cardi-
nals such that A = pcf A and (2|A|)+ < min A. There exist generators Bλ,
λ ∈A, for pcf A with the property
(24.11)
if µ ∈Bλ then Bµ ⊂Bλ.
In other words, the relation “µ ∈Bλ” of µ and λ is transitive. The lemma
holds under weaker assumptions on A; see Shelah [1994].
Proof. Let Bλ, λ ∈A, be generators for pcf A. We shall replace each Bλ by
an equivalent generator Bλ so that (24.11) is satisﬁed.
For each λ ∈A there exists a sequence ⟨f λ
α : α < λ⟩of functions in  A
that is <Jλ-increasing and is coﬁnal on Bλ. Moreover, by Lemma 24.10 we
may assume that for each λ and each α of coﬁnality greater than 2|A|, f λ
α is
an exact upper bound of {f λ
β : β < α}.
Let κ = (2|A|)+. Let ϑ be suﬃciently large, and consider elementary sub-
models of (Hϑ, ∈, <) where < is some well-ordering of Hϑ. Consider a con-
tinuous elementary chain
M0 ≺M1 ≺. . . ≺Mη ≺. . . ≺Mκ = M ≺Hϑ
of models, each of size κ, such that M0 contains A, each λ ∈A, all subsets
of A, each ⟨f λ
α : α < λ⟩, every function from a subset of A into A<ω, and
such that
(24.12)
⟨Mξ : ξ ≤η⟩∈Mη+1
(all η < κ).

474
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Let χη, η ≤κ, be the characteristic functions of Mη:
(24.13)
χη(λ) = sup(Mη ∩λ)
(for all λ ∈A),
and let χ = χκ, the characteristic function of M. Each χη (η < κ) belongs
to Mη+1 and therefore to M. If ξ < η then χξ(λ) < χη(λ) for all λ ∈A, and
⟨χη(λ) : η < κ⟩is an increasing continuous sequence with limit χ(λ) < λ.
We claim that for each λ ∈A, χ is the <Jλ-exact upper bound of ⟨f λ
α :
α ∈M ∩λ⟩on Bλ and consequently,
(24.14)
f λ
χ(λ)(µ) = χ(µ)
for Jλ-almost all µ ∈Bλ.
If α ∈M ∩λ then f λ
α ∈M and so f λ
α(µ) < χ(µ) for all µ ∈A. Hence χ is
an upper bound of ⟨f λ
α : α ∈M ∩λ⟩. To show that χ is the <Jλ-exact upper
bound on Bλ, it suﬃces to show that for each η < κ, χη <Jλ f λ
α on Bλ for
some α ∈M ∩λ, since χ is the pointwise supremum of {χη : η < κ}, and
|A| < κ. Thus let η < κ; there exists an α < λ such that χη <Jλ f λ
α on Bλ,
and since M is an elementary submodel, there exists such an α in M.
Since cf χ(λ) = κ > 2|A|, f λ
χ(λ) is a <Jλ-exact upper bound of {f λ
α : α ∈
M ∩λ} on Bλ, and (24.14) follows.
Now we let, for each λ ∈A,
(24.15)
B∗
λ = {µ ∈Bλ : f λ
χ(λ)(µ) = χ(µ)};
if follows from (24.14) that B∗
λ is Jλ-equivalent to Bλ.
The transitive generators Bλ are deﬁned as follows:
(24.16)
ν ∈Bλ if and only if there exists a ﬁnite increasing sequence (with
k ≥0) ⟨ν0, . . . , νk⟩such that ν0 = ν, νk = λ and νi ∈B∗
νi+1 for
every i = 0, . . . , k −1.
It is clear that Bλ is transitive, B∗
λ ⊂Bλ, and λ = max Bλ. It remains
to prove that Bλ is Jλ-equivalent to Bλ; for that it suﬃces to show that
Bλ ∈Jλ+ = Jλ[Bλ].
For each ν ∈Bλ, ﬁx a ﬁnite sequence ϕ(ν) = ⟨ν0, . . . , νk⟩to sat-
isfy (24.16). Note that the function ϕ on Bλ belongs to M. Let ⟨gα : α < λ⟩
be the λ-sequence of functions in  A deﬁned as follows:
If ν /∈Bλ, we let gα(ν) = 0. If ν ∈Bλ then ϕ(ν) = ⟨ν0, . . . , νk⟩with
ν0 = ν and νk = λ, and we consider the sequence ⟨β0, . . . , βk⟩, where βi < νi
for each i, obtained as follows (by descending induction):
(24.17)
βk = α,
βi = f νi+1
βi+1(νi)
(i = k −1, . . . , 0).
and let gα(ν) = β0.
As M is an elementary submodel and ϕ ∈M, the sequence ⟨gα : α < λ⟩
is deﬁned in M. Since Jλ+ is λ+-directed, there exists a function g ∈ A

24. The Singular Cardinal Problem
475
such that gα < g mod Jλ+ for every α < λ. Since M ≺Hϑ, such a function g
exists in M. Since g ∈M, we have g(ν) < χ(ν) for all ν and therefore gα < χ
mod Jλ+ for every α < λ.
Now let α = χ(λ). We shall ﬁnish the proof by showing that gα(ν) = χ(ν)
for every ν ∈Bλ. This implies that Bλ ∈Jλ+.
So let ν ∈Bλ. Let ⟨ν0, . . . , νk⟩= ϕ(ν), and let ⟨β0, . . . , βk⟩be the sequence
obtained in (24.17) for α = χ(λ). We claim that for each i, βi = χ(νi), and
therefore gα(ν) = β0 = χ(ν0) = χ(ν).
For each i we have νi ∈B∗
νi+1, and so by (24.15), f νi+1
χ(νi+1)(νi) = χ(νi). For
i = k, we have βk = α = χ(λ) = χ(νk), and then for each i = k −1, . . . , 0,
we have by (24.17)
βi = f νi+1
βi+1 (νi) = f νi+1
χ(νi+1)(νi) = χ(νi).
⊓⊔
Using transitive generators we now prove the Localization Lemma:
Lemma 24.32 (Localization). Let A be a set of regular cardinals such that
2| pcf A| < min A, let X ⊂pcf A and let λ ∈pcf X. There exists a set W ⊂X
such that |W| ≤|A| and such that λ ∈pcf W.
Again, the Localization Lemma holds under the weaker assumption
| pcf A| < min A.
Proof. First, since 2|X| < min X, there exist generators for pcf X, and in
particular there exists a set Y ⊂X with max(pcf Y ) = λ. Let A = pcf A.
By (24.7)(vii) we have pcf A = A, and since 2|A| < min A, we can ﬁnd
transitive generators Bν, ν ∈A, for pcf A.
For every ν ∈Y , let BA
ν = Bν ∩A. Since Y ⊂pcf A, there exists an
ultraﬁlter D on A with cof D = ν, and by Theorem 24.25, Bν ∈D. Hence
ν ∈pcf BA
ν . Let
E = {BA
ν : ν ∈Y }.
Since ν ∈pcf E for every ν ∈Y , we have Y ⊂pcf E, hence pcf Y ⊂pcf pcf E,
and since (by (24.7)(vii)) pcf pcf E = pcf E, we have pcf Y ⊂pcf E. In
particular, λ ∈pcf E.
Since E ⊂A, there exists a set W ⊂Y of size ≤|A| such that E ⊂
{BA
ν : ν ∈W}. We shall prove that λ ∈pcf W.
Assume, by contradiction, that λ /∈pcf W. By compactness (Corol-
lary 24.29) there exist λ1, . . . , λn ∈pcf W such that W ⊂Bλ1 ∪. . . ∪Bλn,
and since max pcf W ≤max pcf Y = λ, we have λi < λ for all i = 1, . . . , n.
Now
E ⊂{Bν : ν ∈W} ⊂{Bν : ν ∈Bλ1} ∪. . . ∪{Bν : ν ∈Bλn},
and since, by transitivity (Lemma 24.31), 
ν∈Bµ Bν ⊂Bµ for every µ, we
have
E ⊂Bλ1 ∪. . . ∪Bλn.
It follows that pcf E ⊂pcf(Bλ1 ∪. . . ∪Bλn) = pcf Bλ1 ∪. . . ∪pcf Bλn, and
so max(pcf E) ≤max{λ1, . . . , λn} < λ, a contradiction.

Shelah’s Bound on 2ℵω
As an application of the pcf theory, we shall now present the following result
of Shelah:
Theorem 24.33 (Shelah). If ℵω is a strong limit cardinal then 2ℵω < ℵω4.
Proof. Let us assume that ℵω is strong limit. We already know, by Corol-
lary 24.27, that 2ℵω = max pcf{ℵn}∞
n=0 < ℵℵω. We shall prove that
max pcf{ℵn}∞
n=0 < ℵω4.
Let ϑ be the ordinal such that 2ℵω = ℵϑ+1; we shall prove that ϑ < ω4.
Lemma 24.34. There exists an ordinal function on P(ϑ) with the following
properties:
(i) If X ⊂Y then F(X) ≤F(Y ).
(ii) For every limit ordinal η < ϑ of uncountable coﬁnality there is
a closed unbounded set C ⊂η such that F(C) = η.
(iii) If X ⊂ϑ has order-type ω1 then there exists some γ ∈X such
that F(X ∩γ) ≥sup X.
(24.18)
Proof. Let X ⊂ϑ and consider the set A = {ℵξ+1 : ξ ∈X}. As 2|A| = ℵk
for some ﬁnite k, max(pcf A) exists and is equal to some ℵγ+1. We deﬁne
F(X) = γ.
It is clear that X ⊂Y implies F(X) ≤F(Y ) and that F(X) ≥sup X.
Property (ii) follows from Corollary 24.30. If κ = cf η then κ < ℵω and so
2κ < ℵω < ℵη and the corollary applies.
Property (iii) is a consequence of the Localization Lemma 24.32: If X ⊂ϑ
then {ℵξ+1 : ξ ∈X} ⊂pcf{ℵn}∞
n=0 and since 2| pcf{ℵn}n| ≤22ℵ0 < ℵω,
Lemma 24.32 applies (with e.g. λ = ℵη+1 where η = sup X) and X has
a countable subset W such that F(W) ≥sup X.
⊓⊔
We complete the proof of Shelah’s Theorem by showing that ϑ < ω4.
Assume, by contradiction, that ϑ ≥ω4. Let ⟨Cα : α ∈Eℵ3
ℵ1 ⟩be a club-
guessing sequence (see Theorem 23.3). Each Cα is a closed unbounded subset
of α, and for every closed unbounded C ⊂ω3, the set {α ∈Eℵ3
ℵ1 : Cα ⊂C} is
stationary.
Let Mα, α < ω3, be a continuous elementary chain of models of size ℵ3
that contain the family {Cα}α, are closed under F, such that ⟨Mξ : ξ ≤α⟩∈
Mα+1 for each α, and that for each α, ηα = Mα ∩ω4 is an ordinal. Let
η : ω3 →ω4 be the continuous function η(α) = ηα. By (24.18)(ii) there
is a closed unbounded set C ⊂ω3 such that F(η“C) = supα ηα. Let α ∈
Eℵ3
ℵ1 be such that Cα ⊂C. By (24.18)(iii) there exists a β < α such that
F(η“(Cα ∩β)) ≥η(α). Let X = η“(Cα ∩β).
Since Cα ∈Mα and η↾β ∈Mα, we have X ∈Mα. Since X ⊂η“C we
have F(X) ≤F(η“C) < ω4. As Mα is closed under F, we have F(X) ∈Mα,
and since ω4 ∩Mα = η(α), it follows that F(X) < η(α), a contradiction.

The function d is a least upper bound, but not an exact upper bound of the set
{cγ : γ < ω1}, in <I.
Historical Notes
The Galvin-Hajnal Theorem appeared in [1975]. Shelah’s investigation leading to
the pcf theory started in [1978], and the book [1982] contains the ﬁrst proof of
a bound on 2ℵω. In a sequence of papers starting in 1978, Shelah developed the
theory of possible coﬁnalities. A complete presentation is in his book [1994].
There are several papers that give an exposition and/or simpliﬁed proofs of
Shelah’s results; we mention Burke and Magidor [1990] and Jech [1992].

25. Descriptive Set Theory
Descriptive set theory is the study of deﬁnable sets of real numbers, in par-
ticular projective sets, and is mostly interested in how well behaved these
sets are. A prototype of such results is Theorem 11.18 stating that Σ1
1 sets
are Lebesgue measurable, have the Baire property, and have the perfect set
property. This chapter continues the investigations started in Chapter 11.
Throughout, we shall work in set theory ZF + DC (the Principle of Depen-
dent Choice).
The Hierarchy of Projective Sets
Modern descriptive set theory builds on both the classical descriptive set
theory and on recursion theory. It has become clear in the 1950’s that the
topological approach of classical descriptive set theory and the recursion theo-
retic techniques of logical deﬁnability describe the same phenomena. Modern
descriptive set theory uniﬁed both approaches, as well as the notation. An
additional ingredient is in the use of inﬁnite games and determinacy; we shall
return to that subject in Part III.
We ﬁrst reformulate the hierarchy of projective sets in terms of the light-
face hierarchy Σ1
n, Π1
n and ∆1
n and its relativization for real parameters.
While we introduce these concepts explicitly for subsets of the Baire space
N = ωω, analogous deﬁnitions and results apply to product spaces N × N,
N r as well as the spaces ω, ωk, ωk × N r.
Deﬁnition 25.1.
(i) A set A ⊂N is Σ1
1 if there exists a recursive set R ⊂∞
n=0(ωn × ωn)
such that for all x ∈N,
(25.1)
x ∈A
if and only if
∃y ∈ωω ∀n ∈ω R(x↾n, y↾n).
(ii) Let a ∈N; a set A ⊂N is Σ1
1(a) (Σ1
1 in a) if there exists a set R
recursive in a such that for all x ∈N,
x ∈A
if and only if
∃y ∈ωω ∀n ∈ω R(x↾n, y↾n, a↾n).

(iii) A ⊂N is Π1
n (in a) if the complement of A is Σ1
n (in a).
(iv) A ⊂N is Σ1
n+1 (in a) if it is the projection of a Π1
n (in a) subset
of N × N.
(v) A ⊂N is ∆1
n (in a) if it is both Σ1
n and Π1
n (in a).
A similar lightface hierarchy exists for Borel sets: A set A ⊂N is Σ0
1
(recursive open or recursively enumerable) if
(25.2)
A = {x : ∃n R(x↾n)}
for some recursive R, and Π0
1 (recursive closed) if it is the complement of
a Σ0
1 set. Thus Σ1
1 sets are projections of Π0
1 sets, and as every open set is Σ0
1
in some a ∈N (namely an a than codes the corresponding union of basic
open intervals), we have
Σ1
1 = 
a∈N
Σ1
1(a),
and more generally, every Σ1
n (Π1
n) set is Σ1
n (Π1
n) in some parameter a ∈N.
For n ∈ω, the lightface hierarchy of Σ0
n and Π0
n sets describes the arith-
metical sets: For instance, a set A is Σ0
3 if
A = {x ∈N : ∃m1 ∀m2 ∃m3 R(m1, m2, x↾m3)}
for some recursive R, etc. Arithmetical sets are exactly those A ⊂N that
are deﬁnable (without parameters) in the model (HF, ∈) of hereditary ﬁnite
sets.
The following lemma gives a list of closure properties of projective rela-
tions on N. We use the logical (rather than set-theoretic) notation for Boolean
operations; compare with Lemma 13.10.
Lemma 25.2. Let n ≥1.
(i) If A, B are Σ1
n(a) relations, then so are ∃x A, A ∧B, A ∨B, ∃m A,
∀m A.
(ii) If A, B are Π1
n(a) relations, then so are ∀x A, A ∧B, A ∨B, ∃m A,
∀m A.
(iii) If A is Σ1
n(a), then ¬A is Π1
n; if A is Π1
n(a), then ¬A is Σ1
n.
(iv) If A is Π1
n(a) and B is Σ1
n(a), then A →B is Σ1
n(a); if A is Σ1
n(a)
and B is Π1
n(a), then A →B is Π1
n(a).
(v) If A and B are ∆1
n(a), then so are ¬A, A∧B, A∨B, A →B, A ↔B,
∃m A, ∀m A.
Proof. We prove the lemma for n = 1; the general case follows by induction.
Moreover, clauses (ii)–(v) follow from (i).
First, let A ∈Σ1
1(a) and let us show that ∃x A is Σ1
1(a). We have
(x, y) ∈A ↔∃z ∀n (x↾n, y↾n, z↾n, n) ∈R,

25. Descriptive Set Theory

where R is recursive in a. Thus
y ∈∃x A ↔∃x ∃z ∀n (x↾n, y↾n, z↾n, n) ∈R.
We want to contract the two quantiﬁers ∃x ∃z into one. Let us consider some
recursive homeomorphism between N and N 2, e.g., for u ∈N let u+ and u−
be
u+(n) = u(2n),
u−(n) = u(2n + 1),
(n ∈N).
There exists a relation R′ recursive in R, such that for all u, y ∈N,
(25.3)
∀n (u↾n, y↾n, n) ∈R′
if and only if
∀k (u+↾k, y↾k, u−↾k, k) ∈R.
Namely, if n = 2k (or n = 2k+1), we let (s, t, n) ∈R′ just in case length(s) =
length(t) = n and
(⟨s(0), . . . , s(2k −2)⟩, ⟨t(0), . . . , t(k −1)⟩, ⟨s(1), . . . , s(2k −1)⟩, k) ∈R.
Now (25.3) implies that
y ∈∃x A ↔∃u ∀n (u↾n, y↾n, n) ∈R′,
and hence ∃x A is Σ1
1(a).
Now let A and B be Σ1
1(a):
x ∈A ↔∃z ∀n (x↾n, z↾n, n) ∈R1,
x ∈A ↔∃z ∀n (x↾n, z↾n, n) ∈R2
where both R1 and R2 are recursive in a. Note that
x ∈A ∧B ↔∃z1 ∃z2 ∀n [(x↾n, z1↾n, n) ∈R1 ∧(x↾n, z2↾n, n) ∈R2]
and hence, by contraction of ∃z1 ∃z2, there is some R, recursive in R1 and R2
such that
x ∈A ∧B ↔∃z ∀n (x↾n, z↾n, n) ∈R.
Thus A ∧B is Σ1
1(a).
The following argument shows that the case A ∨B can be reduced to the
case ∃m C. Let us deﬁne R as follows (s, t ∈Seq, m, n ∈N):
(s, m, t, n) ∈R ↔either m = 1 and (s, t, n) ∈R1
or m = 2 and (s, t, n) ∈R2.
R is recursive in R1 and R2, and
x ∈A ∨B ↔∃z ∀n (x↾n, z↾n, n) ∈R1 ∨∃z ∀n (x↾n, z↾n, n) ∈R2
↔∃m ∃z ∀n (x↾n, m, z↾n, n) ∈R
↔x ∈∃m C
where C is Σ1
1(a).

482
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
The contraction of quantiﬁers ∃m ∃z is easier than the contraction ∃x ∃z
above. We employ the following recursive homomorphism between N and
ω × N : h(u) = (u(0), u′), where
u′(n) = u(n + 1)
(n ∈N).
If
(x, m) ∈A ↔∃z ∀n (x↾n, m, z↾n, n) ∈R,
then we leave it to the reader to ﬁnd a relation R′, recursive in R, such that
for all u, x ∈N,
∀n (x↾n, u↾n, n) ∈R′ ↔∀k (x↾k, u(0), u′↾k, k) ∈R.
Then
x ∈∃m A ↔∃u ∀n (x↾n, u↾n, n) ∈R′.
It remains to show that if A is Σ1
1(a), then ∀m A is Σ1
1(a). Let
(x, m) ∈A ↔∃z ∀n (x↾n, m, z↾n, n) ∈R
where R is recursive in a. Thus
(25.4)
x ∈∀m A ↔∀m ∃z ∀n (x↾n, m, z↾n, n) ∈R.
We want to replace the quantiﬁers ∀m ∃z by ∃u ∀m and then contract the two
quantiﬁers ∀m ∀n into one. Let us consider the pairing function Γ : N ×N →
N and the following homeomorphism between N and N ω: For each u ∈N,
let um, m ∈N, be
um(n) = u(Γ(m, n))
(m, n ∈N).
Now we can replace ∀m ∃z in (25.4) by ∃u ∀m (note that in the forward
implication we use the Countable Axiom of Choice):
(25.5)
∀m ∃z ∀n (x↾n, m, z↾n, n) ∈R ↔∃u ∀m ∀n (x↾n, m, um↾n, n) ∈R.
Let α : N →N and β : N →N be the inverses of the function Γ: If
Γ(m, n) = k, then m = α(k) and n = β(k). From (25.4) and (25.5) we get
(25.6)
x ∈∀m A ↔∃u ∀k (x↾β(k), α(k), uα(k)↾β(k), β(k)) ∈R.
Now it suﬃces to show that there exists a relation R′ ⊂Seq2 × N, recursive
in R, such that for all u, x ∈N,
(25.7)
∀k (x↾k, u↾k, k) ∈R′ ↔∀k (x↾β(k), α(k), uα(k)↾β(k), β(k)) ∈R.
The relation R′ is found in a way similar to the relation R′ in (25.3), and we
leave the details as an exercise.
Hence ∀m A is Σ1
1(a) because by (25.6) and (25.7),
x ∈∀m A ↔∃u ∀k (x↾k, u↾k, k) ∈R′.
In Lemma 11.8 we proved the existence of a universal Σ1
n set. An analysis
of the proof (and of Lemma 11.2) yields a somewhat ﬁner result: There exists
a Σ1
n set A ⊂N 2 (lightface) that is a universal Σ1
n set.

Π1
1 Sets
We formulate a normal form for Π1
1 sets in terms of trees. This is based on
the idea that analytic sets are projections of closed sets, and that closed sets
in N are represented by sets [T ] where T is a sequential tree; cf. (4.6). Let
us consider the product space N r, for an arbitrary integer r ≥1. As in the
case r = 1, the closed subsets of N r can be represented by trees: Let Seqr
denote the set of all r-tuples (s1, . . . , sr) ∈Seqr such that length(s1) = . . . =
length(sr). A set T ⊂Seqr is an (r-dimensional sequential) tree if for every
(s1, . . . , sr) ∈T and each n ≤length(s1), (s1↾n, . . . , sr↾n) is also in T . Let
(25.8)
[T ] = {(a1, . . . , ar) ∈N r : ∀n (a1↾n, . . . , ar↾n) ∈T }.
The set [T ] is closed, and every closed set in N r has the form (25.8), for
some tree T .
We call a sequential tree T ⊂Seqr well-founded if [T ] = ∅, i.e., if the
reverse inclusion on T is a well-founded relation. T is ill-founded if it is not
well-founded.
For T ⊂Seqr+1 and for each x ∈N, let
(25.9)
T (x) = {(s1, . . . , sr) ∈Seqr : (x↾n, s1, . . . , sr) ∈T
where n = length si}.
Now if A ⊂N is analytic, there exists a tree T ⊂Seq2 such that A is the
projection of [T ]; consequently, for all x ∈N we have
(25.10)
x ∈A
if and only if
T (x) is ill-founded.
More generally, if A is Σ1
1, let R be recursive such that
x ∈A ↔∃y ∈N ∀n R(x↾n, y↾n)
and deﬁne T = {(t, s) ∈Seq2 : ∀n ≤length(s) R(t↾n, s↾n)}. For all x ∈N,
we have T (x) = {s ∈Seq : ∀n ≤length(s) R(x↾n, s↾n)} and x ∈A if and
only if T (x) is ill-founded.
Theorem 25.3 (Normal Form for Π1
1). A set A ⊂N is Π1
1 if and only if
there exists a recursive mapping x →T (x) such that each T (x) is a sequential
tree, and
x ∈A
if and only if
T (x) is well-founded.
⊓⊔
(25.11)
Similarly, a relation A ⊂N r is Π1
1 if and only if A = {⃗x : T (⃗x) is well-
founded} where ⟨T (⃗x) : ⃗x ∈N r⟩is a recursive system of r-dimensional trees.
One consequence of normal forms is that Π1
1 (and Σ1
1) relations are abso-
lute for transitive models:

484
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Theorem 25.4 (Mostowski’s Absoluteness). If P is a Σ1
1 property then
P is absolute for every transitive model that is adequate for P.
Proof. “Adequate” here means that the model satisﬁes enough axioms to
know that well-founded trees have a rank function, and contains the param-
eter in which P is Σ1
1. The proof is similar to Lemma 13.11.
Let M be a transitive model and let T ∈M be a tree such that P =
{x : T (x) is ill-founded}. Let x ∈M. If M ⊨(T (x) is ill-founded) then
T (x) is ill-founded. Conversely, if M ⊨(T (x) is well-founded) then M ⊨(∃f :
T (x) →Ord such that f(s) < f(t) whenever s ⊃t) and therefore T (x) is
well-founded.
⊓⊔
Trees, Well-Founded Relations and κ-Suslin Sets
Much of modern descriptive set theory depends on a generalization of the
Normal Form for Π1
1 sets. A tree T ⊂Seqr consists of r-tuples of ﬁnite
sequences. We can also identify T with ﬁnite sequences of r-tuples, which
enables us to consider a more general concept:
Deﬁnition 25.5.
(i) A tree T (on a set X) is a set of ﬁnite sequences (in X) closed under
initial segments.
(ii) If s, t ∈T then s ≤t means s ⊃t, i.e., t is an initial segment of s.
(iii) If s ∈T then T/s = {t : s⌢t ∈T }.
(iv) If (T, ≤) is well-founded then ∥T ∥is the height of ≤, and for t ∈T ,
ρT (t) is the rank of t in ≤.
(v) [T ] = {f ∈Xω : ∀n f↾n ∈T }.
If S and T are well-founded trees and if f : S →T is order-preserving
then ∥S∥≤∥T ∥; this is easily veriﬁed by induction on rank. But the converse
is also true:
Lemma 25.6. If S and T are well-founded trees and ∥S∥≤∥T ∥then there
exists an order-preserving map f : S →T .
Proof. By induction on ∥T ∥. For each ⟨a⟩∈S, ∥S/⟨a⟩∥< ∥S∥≤∥T ∥and
there exists a ta ̸= ∅such that ∥S/⟨a⟩∥≤∥T/⟨ta⟩∥. Let fa : S/⟨a⟩→S/ta be
order-preserving. Now deﬁne f : S →T as follows: f(∅) = ∅, and f(a⌢s) =
t⌢
a fa(s) whenever a⌢s ∈S.
⊓⊔
We remark that the above proof (as well as the existence of rank), uses
the Principle of Dependent Choices. If T is ill-founded, note that for any S
there exists an order-preserving f : S →T (into an inﬁnite branch of T ).
Thus we have

25. Descriptive Set Theory
485
Corollary 25.7. There exists an order-preserving f : S →T if and only if
either T is ill-founded or ∥S∥≤∥T ∥.
⊓⊔
Trees used in descriptive set theory are trees on ω × K (or on ωr × K)
where K is some set, usually well-ordered.
Let Seq(K) be the set of all ﬁnite sequences in K. A tree on ω × K is
a set of pairs (s, h) ∈Seq × Seq(K) such that length(s) = length(h) and that
for each n ≤length(s), (s↾n, h↾n) ∈T . For every x ∈N, let
(25.12)
T (x) = {h ∈Seq(K) : (x↾n, h) ∈T where n = length(h)}.
T (x) is a tree on K. Further we let
p[T ] = {x ∈N : T (x) is ill-founded}
= {x ∈N : [T (x)] ̸= ∅}
= {x ∈N : (∃f ∈Kω) ∀n (x↾n, f↾n) ∈T }.
Trees on ωr × K are deﬁned analogously.
Deﬁnition 25.8. Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal. A set A ⊂N is κ-Suslin if
A = p[T ] for some tree on ω × κ.
By the Normal Form Theorem for Π1
1 sets, every Σ1
1 set is ω-Suslin. In
fact if A is Σ1
1(a) then A = p[T ] where T is a tree on ω × ω recursive in a.
Let us associate with each x ∈N the following binary relation Ex on N:
(25.13)
m Ex n ↔x(Γ(m, n)) = 0
where Γ is a (recursive) pairing function of N × N onto N; we say that
x codes the relation Ex. We deﬁne
(25.14)
WF = {x ∈N : x codes a well-founded relation},
WO = {x ∈N : x codes a well-ordering on N}.
Lemma 25.9. The sets WF and WO are Π1
1.
Proof. We prove in some detail that WF is Π1
1. Ex is well-founded if and only
if there is no z : N →N such that z(k + 1) Ex z(k) for all k. Thus
x ∈WF ↔∀z ∃k ¬z(k + 1) Ex z(k).
In other words, WF = ∀z A, where
(x, z) ∈A ↔∃k x(Γ(z(k + 1), z(k))) ̸= 0
and it suﬃces to show that A is arithmetical. But
(x, z) ∈A ↔∃n, m, j, k [i = (z↾n)(k + 1) ∧j = (z↾n)(k) ∧
m = Γ(i, j) ∧(x↾n)(m) ̸= 0].
To show that WO is Π1
1 it suﬃces to verify that the set
LO = {x : Ex is a linear ordering of N}
is arithmetical. Then WO = WF ∧LO is Π1
1.
⊓⊔

486
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
We show below that neither WF nor WO is a Σ1
1 set; thus neither is
a Borel set.
For each x ∈WF, let
(25.15)
∥x∥= the height of the well-founded relation Ex
(see (2.7)). For each x, ∥x∥is a countable ordinal (and for each α < ω1 there
is some x ∈WF such that ∥x∥= α). If x ∈WO, then ∥x∥is the order-type
of the well-ordering Ex.
Lemma 25.10. For each α < ω1, the sets
WFα = {x ∈WF : ∥x∥≤α},
WOα = {x ∈WO : ∥x∥≤α}
are Borel sets.
Proof. Note that the set {(x, n) : n ∈ﬁeld(Ex)} is arithmetical (and hence
Borel). Let us prove the lemma ﬁrst for WOα.
For each α < ω1, let
Bα = {(x, n) : Ex restricted to {m : m Ex n}
is a well-ordering of order type ≤α}.
We prove, by induction on α < ω1, that each Bα is a Borel set. It is easy to
see that B0 is arithmetical. Thus let α < ω1 and assume that all Bβ, β < α,
are Borel. Then 
β<α Bβ is Borel and hence Bα is also Borel because
(x, n) ∈Bα ↔∀m

m Ex n →(x, m) ∈

.
It follows that each WOα is Borel because
x ∈WOα ↔∀n

n ∈ﬁeld(Ex) →(x, n) ∈
β<α

.
To handle WFα, note that the rank function ρE can be deﬁned for any
binary relation E; namely:
ρE(u) = α
if and only if
∀v (v E u →ρE(v) is deﬁned) and
α = sup{ρE(v) + 1 : v E u}.
For each α < ω1, let
Cα = {(x, n) : ρEx(n) is deﬁned and ≤α}.
Again, C0 is arithmetical, and if we assume that all Cβ, β < α, are Borel,
then Cα is also Borel:
(x, n) ∈Cα ↔∀m

m Ex n →(x, m) ∈
β<α
Cβ

Hence each Cα is Borel, and it follows that each WFα is Borel:
x ∈WFα ↔∀n

n ∈ﬁeld(Ex) →(x, n) ∈

Corollary 25.11. The sets {x ∈WF : ∥x∥= α} and {x ∈WF : ∥x∥< α}
are Borel (similarly for WO).
Proof. {x ∈WF : ∥x∥< α} = 

⊓⊔
Theorem 25.12. If C is a Π1
1 set, then there exists a continuous function
f : N →N such that C = f−1(WF), and there exists a continuous function
g : N →N such that C = g−1(WO).
Proof. We shall give the proof for WF; the proof for WO is similar. Let
T ⊂Seq2 be such that
x ∈C ↔T (x) is well-founded.
Let {t0, t1, . . . , tn, . . .} be an enumeration of the set Seq. For each x ∈N, let
y = f(x) be the following element of N:
y(Γ(m, n)) =
0
if tm, tn ∈T (x), and tm < tn,
1
otherwise.
It is clear that Ey is isomorphic to (T (x), <), and hence y ∈WF if and only
if T (x) is well-founded. Thus C = f−1(WF) and it remains to show only that
f is continuous. But it should be obvious from the deﬁnitions of T (x) and
of y = f(x) that for any ﬁnite sequence s = ⟨ε0, . . . , εk−1⟩, there is ˇs ∈Seq
such that if x ⊃ˇs and y = f(x), then y↾k = s. Hence f is continuous.
⊓⊔
Corollary 25.13. WF is not Σ1
1; WO is not Σ1
1.
Proof. Otherwise every Π1
1 set would be the inverse image by a continuous
function of an analytic set and hence analytic; however, there are Π1
1 sets
that are not analytic.
⊓⊔
Corollary 25.14 (Boundedness Lemma). If B ⊂WO is Σ1
1, then there
is an α < ω1 such that ∥x∥< α for all x ∈B.
Proof. Otherwise we would have
WO = {x ∈N : ∃z (z ∈B ∧∥x∥≤∥z∥)}.
Hence ∥x∥≤∥z∥for x, z ∈N means: Either z /∈WO or ∥x∥≤∥z∥; this
relation is Σ1
1; see Exercise 25.3. This would mean that WO is Σ1
1, a contra-
diction.
⊓⊔
Corollary 25.15. Every Π1
1 set is the union of ℵ1 Borel sets.
Proof. If C is Π1
1, then C = f−1(WF) for some continuous f. But WF =

α<ω1 WFα, and hence
C =

α<ω1
f−1(WFα).
Each f−1(WFα) is the inverse image of a Borel set by a continuous function,
hence Borel.

Corollary 25.16. Assuming the Axiom of Choice, every Π1
1 set is either at
most countable, or has cardinality ℵ1, or cardinality 2ℵ0.
⊓⊔
Theorem 25.19 below improves Corollary 25.15 by showing that every
Σ1
2 set is the union of ℵ1 Borel sets. The following lemma is the ﬁrst step
toward that theorem.
Lemma 25.17. Every Σ1
1 set is the union of ℵ1 Borel sets.
Proof. Let A be a Σ1
1 set. Let T ⊂Seq2 be a tree such that A = p[T ]. We
prove by induction on α that for each t ∈Seq and every α < ω1, the set
(25.16)
{x ∈N : ∥T (x)/t∥≤α}
is Borel. Namely, {x : ∥T (x)/t∥≤0} = {x : (x↾n, t) /∈T } and if α > 0, then
∥T (x)/t∥≤α if and only if ∀n (∃β < α) ∥T (x)/t⌢n∥≤β.
Let us deﬁne, for each α, the set Bα as follows:
x ∈Bα ↔¬(∥T (x)∥< α) ∧∀t (¬∥T (x)/t∥= α).
Since the sets in (25.16) are Borel, it follows that each Bα is Borel. We shall
prove that A = 
α<ω1 Bα. First let x ∈A. Thus T (x) is ill-founded; hence
∥T (x)∦< α for any α, and it suﬃces to show that there is an α such that
∥T (x)/t∦= α for all t. If there is no such α, then for every α there is t such
that ∥T (x)/t∥= α, but there are ℵ1 α’s and only ℵ0 t’s; a contradiction.
Next let x /∈A, and let us show that x /∈Bα, for all α. Let α < ω1
be arbitrary. Since T (x) is well-founded, either ∥T (x)∥< α and x /∈Ba, or
∥T (x)∥≥α and there exists some t ∈T (x) such that ∥T (x)/t∥= α and
again x /∈Bα.
⊓⊔
Σ1
2 Sets
The Normal Form Theorem for Π1
1 sets provides a tree representation for
Σ1
2 sets:
Theorem 25.18. Every Σ1
2 set is ω1-Suslin. If A is Σ1
2(a) then A = p[T ]
where T is a tree on ω × ω1 and T ∈L[a].
Proof. Let A be a Σ1
2(a) subset of N. There is a tree U ⊂Seq3, recursive
in a such that
x ∈A ↔∃y ∀z ∃n (x↾n, y↾n, z↾n) /∈U.
In other words,
x ∈A ↔∃y U(x, y) is well-founded.

25. Descriptive Set Theory
489
A necessary and suﬃcient condition for a countable relation to be well-
founded is that it admits an order-preserving mapping into ω1. Thus
x ∈A ↔∃y (∃f : U(x, y) →ω1) if u ⊂v then f(u) > f(v)
↔∃y (∃f : Seq →ω1) f↾U(x, y) is order-preserving.
Let {un : n ∈N} be a recursive enumeration of the set Seq such that for
every n, length(un) ≤n. If f is a function on (a subset of) N, let f ∗be the
function on (a subset of) Seq deﬁned by f ∗(un) = f(n). Thus
(25.17)
x ∈A ↔∃y (∃f : ω →ω1) f ∗↾U(x, y) is order-preserving.
Now we deﬁne a tree T ′ on ω2 × ω1 as follows: If s, t ∈Seq and h ∈Seq(ω1)
are all of length n, we let
(25.18)
(s, t, h) ∈T ′ ↔h∗↾Us,t is order-preserving
where Us,t = {u ∈Seq : k = length u ≤n and (s↾k, t↾k, u) ∈U}. Clearly,
T ′ is a tree on ω2 × ω1.
Let x, y ∈N. We claim that if (x↾n, (y↾n, h) ∈T ′, then h∗↾U(x, y) is
order-preserving. This is because if u, v ∈dom(h∗) ∩U(x, y), then u = ui,
v = uj for some i, j < n, hence length(u), length(v) < n and hence u, v ∈Us,t,
where s = x↾n, t = y↾n. Thus
f ∈T ′(x, y) ↔∀n (f↾n)∗↾U(x, y) is order-preserving.
But clearly a mapping f : ω →ω1 satisﬁes the right-hand side if and only if
f ∗↾U(x, y) is order-preserving. Hence (25.17) and (25.18) give
x ∈A ↔∃y ∃f : ω →ω1 f ∈T ′(x, y)
↔∃y ∃f : ω →ω1 ∀n (x↾n, y↾n, f↾n) ∈T ′.
Now we transform T ′ (on ω2×ω1) into a tree T ′′ (on ω×K where K = ω×ω1)
such that we replace triples
(⟨s(0), . . . , s(n −1)⟩, ⟨t(0), . . . , t(n −1), ⟩, ⟨h(0), . . . , h(n −1)⟩)
by pairs
(⟨s(0), . . . , s(n −1)⟩, ⟨(t(0), h(0)), . . . , (t(n −1), h(n −1))⟩)
and we get
x ∈A ↔(∃g : ω →K) ∀n (x↾n, g↾n) ∈T ′′.
Since K = ω × ω1 is in an obvious one-to-one correspondence with ω1, it is
clear that we can ﬁnd a tree T on ω × ω1 such that
(25.19)
x ∈A ↔(∃g : ω →ω1) ∀n (x↾n, g↾n) ∈T,
that is A = p[T ]. The tree T so obtained is constructible from the tree U,
which in turn is constructible from a.

One consequence of Theorem 25.18 is the following:
Theorem 25.19 (Sierpi´nski). Every Σ1
2 set is the union of ℵ1 Borel sets.
It follows that in ZFC, every Σ1
2 set has cardinality either at most ℵ1, or 2ℵ0.
Proof. Let A be a Σ1
2 set. By Theorem 25.18 there is a tree T on ω ×ω1 such
that A = p[T ]. For each γ < ω1 let T γ = {(s, h) ∈T : h ∈Seq(γ)}. Since
every f : ω →ω1 has the range included in some γ < ω1, it is clear that
A =

p[T γ].
For each γ < ω1, the set p[T γ] is analytic (because p[T γ] = p[ ˜T] for some
˜T ⊂Seq2) and is the union of ℵ1 Borel sets. In fact, Lemma 25.17 gives
a uniform decomposition into ℵ1 Borel sets for any p[U] where U is a tree on
ω × S with S countable. If we let
x ∈Bγ
α ↔¬(∥T γ(x)∥< α) ∧(∀t ∈Seq(γ))(¬∥T γ(x)/t∥= α)
then A = 
α<ω1

γ<ω1 Bγ

⊓⊔
The main application of Theorem 25.18 is absoluteness of Σ1
2 (and Π1
2)
relations.
Theorem 25.20 (Shoenﬁeld’s Absoluteness Theorem). Every Σ1
2(a)
relation and every Π1
2(a) relation is absolute for all inner models M of ZF+
DC such that a ∈M. In particular, Σ1
2 and Π1
2 relations are absolute for L.
It is clear from the proof that every Σ1
2(a) relation is absolute for every
transitive model M of a ﬁnite fragment of ZF + DC such that ω1 ∈M.
Proof. Let a ∈N and let A be a Σ1
2(a) subset of N; let A = {x : A(x)}
where A(x) is a Σ1
2(a) property. Let M be an inner model of ZF + DC such
that a ∈M. We shall prove that M ⊨A if and only if A holds.
Let U ⊂Seq3 be a tree, arithmetical in a, such that for all x ∈N,
x ∈A ↔∃y U(x, y) is well-founded.
Thus for all x ∈N ∩M
x ∈AM ↔(∃y ∈M) M ⊨U(x, y) is well-founded.
However, for all x, y ∈M, U(x, y) is the same tree in M as in V ; and since
well-foundedness is absolute, we have
x ∈AM ↔(∃y ∈M) U(x, y) is well-founded.
Thus, if x ∈AM, then x ∈A, and it suﬃces to prove that if x ∈A ∩M then
x ∈AM.

We use the tree representation of Σ1
2 sets. Let T be the tree on ω × ω1
constructed in the proof of Theorem 25.18. Hence T ∈L[a] and for every
x ∈N,
x ∈A ↔T (x) is ill-founded.
Now if x ∈M is such that x ∈A, then T (x) is ill-founded, and by absoluteness
of well-foundedness,
M ⊨T (x) is ill-founded.
In other words, there exists a function g ∈M from N into the ordinals such
that ∀n (x↾n, g↾n) ∈T . Now following the proof of Theorem 25.18 backward,
from (25.19) to the beginning, and working inside M, one ﬁnds a y ∈M such
that
M ⊨U(x, y) is well-founded.
Hence if x ∈A ∩M, then x ∈AM and we are done.
⊓⊔
With only notational changes Theorem 25.18 gives a tree representation
of subsets of ω (or ωk) and we have:
Corollary 25.21. If A ⊂ω is Σ1
2(a) then A ∈L[a]. In particular, every
Σ1
2 real (and every Π1
2 real) is constructible.
The following lemma is an interesting application of Shoenﬁeld’s Abso-
luteness.
Lemma 25.22. Let S be a set of countable ordinals such that the set A =
{x ∈WO : ∥x∥∈S} is Σ1
2. Then S is constructible. (And more generally, if
A is Σ1
2(a), then S ∈L[a].)
Proof. Let A(x) be the Σ1
2 property such that A = {x : A(x)}. For each
countable ordinal α, let Pα be the notion of forcing that collapses α; i.e.,
the elements of Pα are ﬁnite sequences of ordinals less than α. Each Pα is
constructible; let us consider, in L, the forcing languages associated with
the Pα, and the corresponding Boolean-valued models LPα.
We shall show that for every α < ω1, α belongs to S if and only if
(25.20)
L ⊨every p ∈Pα forces ∃x (A(x) ∧∥x∥= α).
This will show that S is constructible.
In order to prove that α ∈S is equivalent to (25.20), let us consider
a generic extension N of V in which ωV
1 is countable. Let us argue in N.
The notion of forcing Pα has only countably many constructible dense
subsets, and hence for every p ∈Pα there exists a G ⊂Pα such that G is
L-generic and p ∈G. It follows that for every α, every ϕ and every p ∈Pα,
(25.21) L ⊨(p ⊩ϕ)
if and only if
for every L-generic G ∋p, L[G] ⊩ϕ.

492
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Let α < ωV
1 , and let z ∈V be such that ∥z∥= α. Clearly, α belongs to S
if and only if V satisﬁes
(25.22)
∃x (A(x) ∧∥x∥= ∥z∥).
The property (25.22) is Σ1
2 and by absoluteness, it holds in V if and only if
it holds in N.
Let G be an arbitrary L-generic ﬁlter on Pα, and let u ∈L[G] be such that
∥u∥= α. Since N satisﬁes (25.22) if and only if it satisﬁes the Σ1
2 property
(25.23)
∃x (A(x) ∧∥x∥= ∥u∥),
it follows that α ∈S if and only if L[G] satisﬁes (25.23). Since an L-generic
ﬁlter on Pα exists in N, we conclude (still in N), that α ∈S is equivalent to:
For every L-generic G ⊂Pα, L[G] ⊨∃x (A(x) ∧∥x∥= α).
But in view of (25.21) this last statement is equivalent to (25.20).
⊓⊔
Another application of the tree representation of Σ1
2 sets is the Perfect
Set Theorem of Mansﬁeld and Solovay:
Theorem 25.23 (Mansﬁeld-Solovay). Let A be a Σ1
2(a) set in N. If
A contains an element that is not in L[a], then A has a perfect subset.
The theorem follows from this more general lemma:
Lemma 25.24. Let T be a tree on ω×K and let A = p[T ]. Either A ⊂L[T ],
or A contains a perfect subset; moreover, in the latter case there is a perfect
tree U ∈L[T ] on ω such that [U] ⊂A.
Proof. The proof follows the Cantor-Bendixson argument. If T is a tree on
ω × K, let
(25.24)
T ′ = {(s, h) ∈T : there exist (s0, h0), (s1, h1) ∈T such that s0 ⊃s,
s1 ⊃s, h0 ⊃h, h1 ⊃h, and that s0 and s1 are
incompatible
and then, inductively,
T (0) = T,
T (α+1) = (T (α))′,
T (α) =

β<α
T (β)
if α is limit.
The deﬁnition (25.24) is absolute for all models that contain T , and hence
T (α) ∈L[T ] for all α. Let α be the least ordinal such that T (α+1) = T (α).
Let us assume ﬁrst that T (α) = ∅; we shall show that A ⊂L[T ]. Let
x ∈A be arbitrary. There exists an f ∈Kω such that (x, f) ∈[T ]. Let
γ < α be such that (x, f) ∈[T (γ)] but (x, f) /∈[T (γ+1)]. Thus there is some

25. Descriptive Set Theory
493
(s, h) ∈T (γ) such that s ⊂x, h ⊂f, and (s, h) /∈T (γ+1); this means that
for any (s′, h′) ∈T (γ), if s′ ⊃s and h′ ⊃h, then s′ ⊂x. Now it follows that
x ∈L[T ]; in L[T ], x is the unique x = {s′ ⊃s : (s′, h′) ∈T (γ) for some
h ⊃h′}.
Now let us assume that T (α) ̸= ∅. The tree T (γ) has the property that
for every (s, h) ∈T (α) there exist two extensions (s0, h0) and (s1, h1) of
(s, h) that are incompatible in the ﬁrst coordinate. Let us work in L[T ]. Let
(s0, h0) and (s1, h1) be some elements of T (α) such that s0 and s1 are in-
compatible. Then let (s0,0, h0,0), (s0,1, h0,1), (s1,0, h1,0), and (s1,1, h1,1) be
elements of T (α) such that si,j ⊃si, hi,j ⊃hi and that the si,j are incom-
patible. In this fashion we construct (st, ht) ∈T (α) for each 0–1 sequence t.
The st generate a tree U = {s : s ⊂st for some t}. It is clear that U is
a perfect three, that U ∈L[T ], and that [U] ⊂p[T ] = A.
⊓⊔
The following observation establishes a close connection between the pro-
jective hierarchy and the L´evy hierarchy of Σn properties of hereditarily
countable sets:
Lemma 25.25. A set A ⊂N is Σ1
2 if and only if it is Σ1 over (HC, ∈).
Proof. If A is Σ1 over HC, there exists a Σ0 formula ϕ such that
x ∈A ↔HC ⊨∃u ϕ(u, x) ↔(∃u ∈HC ) HC ⊨ϕ[u, x].
Since ϕ is Σ0, it is absolute for transitive models and we have
x ∈A ↔(∃transitive set M)(∃u ∈M) M ⊨ϕ[u, x]
(e.g., M
= TC({u, x})). By the Principle of Dependent Choices every
TC({u, x}) is countable and we have
x ∈A ↔(∃countable transitive set M)(∃u ∈M) M ⊨ϕ[u, x]
↔(∃well-founded extensional relation E on ω)
∃n ∃m (πE(m) = x and (ω, E) ⊨ϕ[n, m])
where πE is the transitive collapse of (ω, E) onto (M, ∈). Recalling the deﬁ-
nition (25.13) of Ex for z ∈N we have
(25.25)
x ∈A ↔(∃z ∈N)(z ∈WF and (ω, Ex) ⊨Extensionality,
∃n ∃m (πEx(m) = x and (ω, Ex) ⊨ϕ[n, m])).
We shall verify that (25.25) gives a Σ1
2 deﬁnition of A. Since WF is Π1
1, it
suﬃces to show that the relation “(ω, E) ⊨ϕ[n1, . . . , nk]” and “πE(m) =
x” are arithmetical in E. It is easy to see that (ω, E) ⊨ϕ is a property

494
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
arithmetical in E. As for the transitive collapse, we notice ﬁrst that if k ∈N,
then
πE(m) = k ↔∃⟨r0, . . . , rk⟩such that m = rk and (ω, E) ⊨r0 = ∅
and (∀i < k) (ω, E) ⊨(ri+1 = ri ∪{ri}).
Then for x ⊂ω we have
πE(m) = x ↔∀n (n E m ↔πE(n) ∈x)
and a similar formula, arithmetical in E, deﬁnes πE(m) = x for x ∈N.
Hence A ∈Σ1
2.
Conversely, if A is a Σ1
2 set then for some Π1
1 property P, A = {x :
∃y P(x, y)}. By Mostowski’s Absoluteness, x ∈A if and only if for some
countable transitive model M ∋x adequate for P there exists a y ∈M such
that M ⊨P(x, y). But this gives a Σ1 deﬁnition of A over (HC , ∈).
⊓⊔
As a consequence, Σ1
n+1 sets are exactly those that are Σn over HC.
Projective Sets and Constructibility
We now compute the complexity of the set of all constructible reals:
Theorem 25.26 (G¨odel). The set of all constructible reals is a Σ1
2 set. The
ordering <L is a Σ1
2 relation.
The ﬁeld of <L is R ∩L. If all reals are constructible, then <L is also Π1
2
(because x <L y if and only if y ≰L x) and hence <L is then a ∆1
2 relation.
The theorem easily generalizes to L[a]: If a ∈R (or a ⊂ω or a ∈N),
then the set R ∩L[a] is Σ1
2(a); also, the relation “x is constructible from y”
is a Σ1
2 relation.
We proved in Chapter 13 that “x is constructible” and “x <L y” are
Σ1 relations over the model (HC , ∈). Thus Theorem 25.26 follows from
Lemma 25.25.
The following lemma tells even more than <L is a Σ1
2 relation. For any
z ∈N, let zm, m ∈N, be deﬁned by zm(n) = z(Γ(m, n)) (the canonical
homeomorphism between N and N ω).
Lemma 25.27. The following relation R on N is Σ1
2:
(z, x) ∈R ↔{zn : n ∈N} = {y : y <L x}.
Proof. Since the relation {zn : n ∈N} ⊂{y : y <L x} is clearly Σ1
2, it
suﬃces to show that
(25.26)
∀y <L x ∃n (y = zn)

25. Descriptive Set Theory
495
is Σ1
2. There is a sentence Θ (provable in ZF) such that if M is a transitive
model of Θ, then <L is absolute for M; and if x ∈M is constructible, then
every y <L x is in M. Thus (25.26) is equivalent to
∃countable transitive model M that contains x, z, and all zn,
and M ⊨(Θ and ∀y <L x ∃n (y = zn)).
This last property is Σ1
2 by a proof similar to Lemma 25.25.
⊓⊔
Every Σ1
1 set is Lebesgue measurable, has the Baire property and if un-
countable, has a perfect subset. The following results show that this is best
possible.
Corollary 25.28. If V = L then there exists a ∆1
2 set that is not Lebesgue
measurable and does not have the Baire property.
Proof. Let A = {(x, y) : x <L y}. For every y, the set {x : (x, y) ∈A} is
countable, hence null and meager, and by Lemmas 11.12 and 11.16, if A is
measurable, then it is null; and if it has the Baire property, then it is meager.
Let B be the complement of A in R2, B = {(x, y) : y ≤L x}. Again, for
every x, the set {y : (x, y) ∈B} is countable, and hence null if measurable,
and meager if has the Baire property.
It clearly follows that A neither is Lebesgue measurable nor has the prop-
erty of Baire
⊓⊔
Corollary 25.29. If V = L then there exists an uncountable Σ1
2 set without
a perfect subset.
Proof. Let
x ∈A ↔x ∈WO ∧∀y <L x (¬∥y∥= ∥x∥).
The set A is uncountable: A is a subset of WO and for every α < ω1 there is
exactly one x in A such that ∥x∥= α. Let us show that A is Σ1
2: Let R be
the Σ1
2 relation from Lemma 25.27; thus
x ∈A ↔x ∈WO ∧∃z (R(z, x) ∧∀n (¬∥zn∥= ∥x∥)),
and since ¬∥zn∥= ∥x∥is Π1
1, A is Σ1
2.
The set A does not have a perfect subset; in fact, it does not have an
uncountable analytic subset. This follows from the Boundedness Lemma: For
every analytic set X ⊂A, the set {∥x∥: x ∈X} is bounded, and hence
countable (because of the deﬁnition of A).
⊓⊔
Below (Corollary 25.37) we improve this by showing that in L there exists
an uncountable Π1
1 set without a perfect subset.
By Shoenﬁeld’s Absoluteness Theorem, every Σ1
2 real is constructible. In
Part III we show that it is consistent that a nonconstructible ∆1
3 real exists.
In the presence of large cardinals, an example of a nonconstructible ∆1
3 real
is 0♯:

496
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Lemma 25.30. If 0♯exists then 0♯is a ∆1
3 real, and the singleton {0♯} is
a Π1
2 set.
Proof. We identify 0♯with the set of G¨odel numbers of the sentences in 0♯.
We claim that the property Σ = 0♯is Π1 over (HC , ∈), and therefore Π1
2.
We use the description (18.24) of 0♯and note that the quantiﬁers ∀α can be
replaced by ∀α < ω1, thus making it a Π1 property over HC .
Thus {0♯} is a Π1
2 set, and
n ∈0♯↔∃z (z ∈{0♯} and z(n) = 1) ↔∀z (z ∈{0♯} →z(n) = 1)
shows that 0♯is a ∆1
3 subset of ω.
⊓⊔
Scales and Uniformization
The tree analysis of Σ1
2 sets can be reﬁned; an analysis of Kondˆo’s proof of
the Uniformization Theorem (Theorem 25.36) led Moschovakis to introduce
the concept of scale that pervades the modern descriptive set theory.
We start with the deﬁnition of norm and prewellordering. While in the
present chapter these concepts are applied to Π1
1 and Σ1
2 sets, the theory
applies to more general collection of deﬁnable sets of reals.
Deﬁnition 25.31. A norm on a set A is an ordinal function ϕ on A. A pre-
wellordering of A is a transitive relation ≼such that a ≼b or b ≼a for all
a, b ∈A, and that ≺is well-founded.
A prewellordering of a set A induces an equivalence relation (a ≼b∧b ≼a)
and a well-ordering of its equivalence classes. Its rank function is a norm, and
conversely, a norm ϕ deﬁnes a prewellordering
(25.27)
a ≼ϕ b
if and only if
ϕ(a) ≤ϕ(b).
The tree analysis of Π1
1 and Σ1
2 sets produces well behaved prewellorder-
ings of Π1
1 and Σ1
2 sets:
Theorem 25.32. For every Π1
1 set A there exists a norm ϕ on A with the
property that there exist a Π1
1 relation P(x, y) and a Σ1
1 relation Q(x, y) such
that for every y ∈A and all x,
(25.28)
x ∈A and ϕ(x) ≤ϕ(y) ↔P(x, y) ↔Q(x, y).
A norm ϕ with the above property is called a Π1
1-norm and the statement
“every Π1
1 set has a Π1
1-norm” is called the prewellordering property of Π1
1.
A relativization of Theorem 25.32 shows that every Π1
1(a) set has a Π1
1(a)-
norm. A modiﬁcation of the proof of Theorem 25.32 yields the prewellordering
property of Σ1
2: every Σ1
2 set has a Σ1
2 norm, i.e., a norm for which exist a Σ1
2 P
and a Π1
2 Q that satisfy (25.28) (cf. Exercises 25.5 and 25.6).

25. Descriptive Set Theory
497
Proof. Let A be a Π1
1 and let T be a recursive tree on ω × ω such that
A(x) ↔T (x) is well-founded.
For each x ∈A let ϕ(x) = ∥T (x)∥be the height of the well-founded tree.
To deﬁne the Σ1
1 relation Q, let
(25.29)
Q(x, y) ↔there exists an order-preserving function
f : T (x) →T (y).
It is not diﬃcult to see that Q is Σ1
1, and the equivalence in (25.28) follows
from Corollary 25.7. For the Π1
1 relation, let
(25.30)
P(x, y) ↔∀s ̸= ∅there exists no order-preserving
f : T (y) →T (x)/s.
This is Π1
1 and says that T (x) is well-founded and it is not the case that
∥T (y)∥< ∥T (x)∥.
⊓⊔
The prewellordering property of Π1
1 implies the reduction principle for Π1
1
and the separation principle for Σ1
1—see Exercises. This in turn implies
Suslin’s Theorem that every ∆1
1 set is Borel.
The prewellordering property has an important strengthening, the scale
property which we now introduce.
Let A be a Π1
1 set. Following the proof of Theorem 25.18 we obtain a tree T
on ω × ω1 such that A = p[T ]. In detail, let U be a recursive tree on ω × ω
such that
x ∈A ↔U(x) is well-founded ↔∃g : U(x) →ω1 order preserving.
Let {un : n ∈N} be a recursive enumeration of Seq such that length(un) ≤n,
and let T be the tree on ω × ω1 deﬁned by
(25.31)
(s, h) ∈T ↔∀m, n < length(s)(if um ⊃un and (s↾k, s↾um) ∈U
where k = length(um), then h(m) < h(n)).
The relevant observation is that not only that A = p[T ], i.e.,
x ∈A ↔∃a branch g in T (x)
but that for every x ∈p[T ] there exists a (pointwise) least branch g in T (x),
i.e., for every f ∈p[T ], g(n) ≤f(n) for all n. To see this, let
gx(n) =
ρT (x)(un)
if un ∈U(x),
0
otherwise.
That gx is the least branch in T (x) holds because the rank function is the
least order-preserving function.

498
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Deﬁnition 25.33. A scale on a set A is a sequence of norms ⟨ϕn : n ∈ω⟩
such that: If ⟨xi : i ∈ω⟩is a sequence of points in A with limi→∞xi = x and
such that
(25.32)
for every n, the sequence ⟨ϕn(xi) : i ∈ω⟩is eventually constant,
with value αn,
then x ∈A, and for every n, ϕn(x) ≤αn.
It is easy to see that every Π1
1 set A has a scale: Let A be a Π1
1 set and
let T be the tree in (25.31). We have A = p[T ] and for each x ∈A, T (x) has
a least branch gx. Let ⟨ϕn : n ∈ω⟩be the sequence of norms on A deﬁned by
(25.33)
ϕn(x) = gx(n).
If ⟨xi : i ∈ω⟩is a sequence in A with limi→∞xi = x that satisﬁes (25.32)
then ⟨αn : n ∈ω⟩is a branch in T (x) witnessing x ∈p[T ], and for every n,
gx(n) ≤αn.
The norms deﬁned in (25.33) are Π1
1-norms; this can be veriﬁed as in the
proof of Theorem 25.32. To be precise, the scale ⟨ϕn : n ∈ω⟩is a Π1
1-scale:
Theorem 25.34. For every Π1
1 set A there exists a scale ⟨ϕn : n ∈ω⟩on A
with the property that there exist a Π1
1 relation P(n, x, y) and a Σ1
1 relation
Q(n, x, y) such that for every n, every y ∈A, and all x,
x ∈A and ϕn(x) ≤ϕn(y) ↔P(n, x, y) ↔Q(n, x, y).
⊓⊔
(25.34)
The statement “every Π1
1 set has a Π1
1-scale” is called the scale property
of Π1
1. A relativization shows that every Π1
1(a) set has a Π1
1(a)-scale, and
a modiﬁcation of the above construction yields the scale property for Σ1
2:
every Σ1
2(a) set has a Σ1
2(a)-scale; cf. Exercises 25.12 and 25.13.
A major application of scales is the uniformization property.
Deﬁnition 25.35. A set A ⊂N × N is uniformized by a function F if
dom(F) = {x : ∃y (x, y) ∈A}, and (x, F(x)) ∈A for all x ∈dom(F).
[Equivalently, F ⊂A and dom(F) = dom(A).]
Theorem 25.36 (Kondˆo). Every Π1
1 relation A ⊂N × N is uniformized
by a Π1
1 function.
The statement of Theorem 25.36 (the Uniformization Theorem) is called
the uniformization property of Π1
1. A relativization shows that every Π1
1(a) re-
lation is uniformized by a Π1
1(a) function, and a modiﬁcation of the proof
yields the uniformization property of Σ1
2; see Exercise 25.15.

25. Descriptive Set Theory
499
Proof. We give a proof of the following statement that easily generalizes to
a proof of Kondˆo’s Theorem: If A is a nonempty Π1
1 subset of N then there
exists an a ∈A such that {a} is Π1
1.
Thus let A be a nonempty Π1
1 subset of N. Given a scale ⟨ϕn : n ∈ω⟩
on A, we select an element a ∈A as follows: We let A0 = A, and for each n
let
A2n+1 = {x ∈A2n : ϕn(x) is least},
A2n+2 = {x ∈A2n+1 : x(n) is least}.
Then A0 ⊃A1 ⊃. . . ⊃An ⊃. . . and the intersection has at most one element.
Deﬁnition 25.33 guarantees that the limit a is in A and so ∞
n=0 An = {an}.
If the scale ⟨ϕn : n ∈ω⟩is Π1
1 then using (25.34) one veriﬁes that the
set {a} is Π1
1.
⊓⊔
Theorem 25.36 can be used to improve the result in Corollary 25.29:
Corollary 25.37. If V = L then there exists an uncountable Π1
1 set without
a perfect subset.
Proof. Let A be a Σ1
2 set without a perfect subset (by 25.29). Now A is the
projection of some Π1
1 set B ⊂N 2. By the Uniformization Theorem, B has
a Π1
1 subset f that is a function and has the same projection A. The set f
is uncountable; we claim that f does not have a perfect subset. Assume that
P ⊂f is perfect. The projection of P is an analytic subset of A. Since P ⊂f,
P is itself a function and because P is uncountable, the projection dom(P) is
also uncountable. This is a contradiction since we proved that every analytic
subset of A is countable.
⊓⊔
Combining this result with Theorem 25.23 we obtain:
Theorem 25.38. The following are equivalent:
(i) For every a ⊂ω, ℵL[a]
1
is countable.
(ii) Every uncountable Π1
1 set contains a perfect subset.
(iii) Every uncountable Σ1
2 set contains a perfect subset.
Proof. Obviously, (iii) implies (ii). In order to show that (i) implies (iii), let
us assume (i) and let A be an uncountable Σ1
2 set. Let a ∈N be such that
A ∈Σ1
2(a). Since ℵL[a]
1
is countable, there are only countably many reals
in L[a], and hence A has an element that is not in L[a]. Thus A contains
a perfect subset, by Theorem 25.23.
The remaining implication uses the same argument as Corollaries 25.29
and 25.37. Assume that there exists an a ⊂ω such that ℵL[a]
1
= ℵ1. We claim
that there exists an uncountable Π1
1 set without a perfect subset. Let
x ∈A ↔x ∈L[a] ∧x ∈WO ∧∀y <L[a] x (¬∥y∥= ∥x∥).
A is a Σ1
2(a) subset of WO and for all α < ω1, A has exactly one element x
such that ∥x∥= α. The rest of the proof proceeds as before, and we obtain
a Π1
1(a) set of cardinality ℵ1 without a perfect subset.

Σ1
2 Well-Orderings and Σ1
2 Well-Founded Relations
The canonical well-ordering of constructible reals is Σ1
2, and so if V = L
then there exists a Σ1
2 well-ordering of the set R (and of N). We now prove
the converse: If there exists a Σ1
2 well-ordering of R then all reals are con-
structible.
Theorem 25.39 (Mansﬁeld). If < is a Σ1
2 well-ordering of N then every
real is constructible. More generally, if < is Σ1
2(a) then N ⊂L[a].
Proof. Let < be a Σ1
2 well-ordering of N and let us assume that there is
a nonconstructible real. Let T0 = Seq({0, 1}), and let C = [T0] = {0, 1}ω be
the Cantor space. Let us consider trees T ⊂T0 and functions f : T →T0
such that s ⊂t implies f(s) ⊂f(t) and for every x ∈[T ], ∞
n=0 f(x↾n) ∈C.
Every such function induces a continuous function from [T ] into C, which we
denote by f ∗.
Lemma 25.40. If T ⊂T0 is a constructible perfect tree and if f : T →T0
is a constructible function such that f ∗is one-to-one, then there exist a con-
structible perfect tree U ⊂T and a constructible g : U →T0 such that g∗is
one-to-one, and g∗(x) < f ∗(x) for every x ∈[U].
It suﬃces to prove this lemma because then we can construct a sequence
of trees T0 ⊃T1 ⊃. . . ⊃Tn ⊃. . . and functions f0, f1, . . . , fn, . . . where f0 is
the identity such that f ∗
n+1(x) < f ∗
n(x) for all x ∈Tn+1. Since all [Tn] are
compact sets, their intersection is nonempty and therefore there exists an x
such that f ∗
0 (x) > f ∗
1 (x) > . . . > f ∗
n(x) > . . . contrary to the assumption that
< is a well-ordering.
Proof of Lemma 25.40. Let T ⊂T0 be a constructible tree and let f : T →T0
be constructible, such that f ∗is one-to-one.
Since T is perfect, there exists a constructible function h : T →T0 such
that h∗: [T ] →C is one-to-one and onto. For each s ∈T0, let s be the “mirror
image” of s, namely if s = ⟨s(0), . . . , s(k)⟩, let s = ⟨1 −s(0), . . . , 1 −s(k)⟩;
for x ∈C, x is deﬁned similarly.
We claim that at least one of the sets
A = {x ∈[T ] : f ∗(x) > h∗(x)},
B = {x ∈[T ] : f ∗(x) > h∗(x)}
contains a nonconstructible element. Let z be the least nonconstructible el-
ement of C, and let x, y ∈[T ] be such that h∗(x) = z and h∗(y) = z. Then
both x and y are nonconstructible and hence f ∗(x) ≥z and f ∗(y) ≥z. Thus
either f ∗(x) > z or f ∗(y) > z and so either A or B contains a noncon-
structible element. For instance, assume that A does.
Since < is Σ2, and T , f, and h are constructible subsets of HF, the set A
is Σ1
2(a) for some a ∈L. By Lemma 25.24 there exists a constructible perfect
tree U such that [U] ⊂A. If we let g = h↾U, then U and g satisfy the lemma.

The set WO is Π1
1 but not Σ1
1. One consequence of this fact, related to
the Boundedness Lemma, is that there is no Σ1
1 well-ordering of the reals,
in fact every Σ1
1 well-ordering of a set of reals is countable. A more general
statement holds:
Lemma 25.41. Every Σ1
1 well-founded relation on N has countable height.
Proof. Assuming that some Σ1
1 well-founded relation on N has height ≥ω1,
we reach a contradiction by describing the set WO in a Σ1
1 way.
First consider the special case of well-orderings. Let E be a Σ1
1 well-
ordering and let us assume that its order-type is ≥ω1. Then for every α < ω1
there is an order-preserving mapping of (α, <) into (N, E). Conversely, if
a countable linearly ordered set (Q, <) can be embedded in (N, E), then
(Q, <) is a well-ordering. Hence let Ex be, for each x ∈N, the relation coded
by x (see (25.13)), and let LO be the arithmetical set of all x that code
a linear ordering of N. Then
(25.35)
x ∈WO ↔x ∈LO ∧(∃f : ω →N) ∀n ∀m
(n Ex m →(f(n), f(m)) ∈E)
↔x ∈LO ∧∃z ∈N ∀n ∀m (n Ex m →(zn, zm) ∈E),
where for each z ∈N and each n, zn is the element of N deﬁned by zn(k) =
z(Γ(n, k)) for all k ∈N, where Γ is the pairing function. Now (25.35) gives
a Σ1
1 description of WO, a contradiction.
In the general case when E is a Σ1
1 well-founded relation we observe that if
α is a countable ordinal less than the height of E, then there exist a countable
set S ⊂N and a function f of S onto α such that for every u ∈S and every
β < f(u) there exists a v ∈S such that v E u and β ≤f(v) (namely
f(x) = ρE(x), and the countable set S is constructed with the help of the
Principle of Dependent Choices). Conversely, if (Q, <) is a linearly ordered
set and if there is a function f from a subset of N onto Q such that for every
u ∈dom(f) and every q < f(u) there is v ∈dom(f) such that v E u and
q ≤f(v), then (Q, <) is a well-ordering. Thus if E has height ≥ω1, we have
(25.36)
x ∈WO ↔x ∈LO ∧(∃countable S = {zn : n ∈N})
(∃f : S
onto
→N) ∀n ∀k [if (k, f(zn)) ∈Ex, then
∃m such that (zm, zn) ∈E and
either k = f(zm) or (k, f(zm)) ∈Ex].
Again, (25.36) can be written in a Σ1
1 manner, and we get a contradiction.
⊓⊔
The next theorem gives an upper bound on heights of Σ1
2 well-founded
relations.

502
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Theorem 25.42 (Martin). Every Σ1
2 well-founded relation on N has length
< ω2.
Note that since every prewellordering is a well-founded relation, the the-
orem implies that δ1
2 ≤ω2, where
δ1
2 = sup{α : α is the length of a Σ1
2 prewellordering}.
Proof. Let E ⊂N × N be a Σ1
2 relation. Let T be a tree on ω2 × ω1 such
that for all x, y ∈N,
(25.37)
(x, y) ∈E ↔(∃f : ω →ω1) ∀n (x↾n, y↾n, f↾n) ∈T.
As usual, for each z ∈N and each n ∈N, let zn ∈N be such that zn(k) =
z(Γ(n, k)) for all k; similarly, for each f : ω →ω1 and each n, let fn : ω →ω1
be such that fn(k) = f(Γ(n, k)) for all k. (Here Γ is the pairing function.)
Each of the following formulas is equivalent to the statement that the
relation E is not well-founded:
∃x ∀m (xm+1, xm) ∈E,
∃x ∀m ∃f ∀n (xm+1↾n, xm↾n, f↾n) ∈T,
∃x ∃f ∀m ∀n (xm+1↾n, xm↾n, fm↾n) ∈T.
It is easy to construct a tree U on ω × ω1 such that for all x ∈N and all
f : ω →ω1,
(25.38)
∀m ∀n (xm+1↾n, xm↾n, fm↾n) ∈T if and only if ∀k (x↾k, f↾k) ∈U.
It follows from (25.38) that
(25.39)
E is well-founded if and only if U is well-founded.
Now let E ⊂N × N be a Σ1
2 well-founded relation; we want to show that
its height is < ω2. Let T be a tree on ω2 × ω1 such that (25.37) holds for all
x, y ∈N and let U be the tree on ω × ω1 constructed from T as above; since
E is well-founded, U is well-founded.
Let us consider a generic extension V [G] of the universe in which ωV
1 is
countable and ωV
2 = ωV [G]
1
. Let us argue in V [G].
Let E∗be the relation on N deﬁned by (25.37). First we observe that
E ⊂E∗: If x, y ∈V , then
(x, y) ∈E ↔V ⊨T (x, y) is ill-founded
↔V [G] ⊨T (x, y) is ill-founded
↔(x, y) ∈E∗.
(because well-foundedness is absolute). We notice further that E∗is well-
founded: This is because by the construction of U (which is absolute) and

25. Descriptive Set Theory
503
the deﬁnition of E∗, V [G] satisﬁes (25.39), i.e.,
E∗is well-founded if and only if U is well-founded.
Hence E∗is well-founded, and height(E) ≤height(E∗).
The tree T is a tree on ω × ωV
1 and ωV
1 is a countable ordinal. Since
E∗= p[T ], it follows that E∗is a Σ1
1 relation. By Lemma 25.41, the height
of E∗is countable. It follows that height(E) < ωV [G]
1
= ωV
2 .
Now we can step back into the ground model and look at the result of the
above argument: height(E) < ω2.
⊓⊔
Both Theorem 25.42 and Lemma 25.41 are special cases of the more gen-
eral Kunen-Martin Theorem:
Theorem 25.43. Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal. Every κ-Suslin well-founded
relation on N has height < κ+.
Proof. Let < be a κ-Suslin well-founded relation on N. We ﬁrst associate
with < a tree T on N as follows:
(25.40)
T = {⟨x0, . . . , xn−1⟩: xn−1 < xn−2 < . . . < x0},
(and ⟨x⟩∈T for all x ∈N). T is well-founded and it suﬃces to prove that
the height of T is < κ+.
As < is κ-Suslin, there exists a tree T on ω × ω × κ such that
x < y
if and only if
∃f (x, y, f) ∈[T ].
Let W be the set of ill sequences (of nodes at the same level of T )
w = ⟨(s1, s0, h0), . . . , (si+1, si, hi), . . . , (sk, sk−1, hk−1)⟩
with (si+1, si, hi) ∈T , and let
(25.41)
w′ ≺w
if and only if
k = length(w) < length(w′) = k′
length(s0) < length(s′
0), and
∀i < k si ⊂s′
i and hi ⊂h′
i.
We claim that the relation ≺is well-founded. Otherwise, let wn = ⟨(sn
i+1,
sn
i , hn
i ) : i < kn⟩be such that wn+1 ≺wn for all n. For each i ∈ω, let
xi = ∞
n=0 sn
i , and fi = ∞
n=0 hn
i (these exist by (25.41)). It follows that
(xi+1, xi, fi) ∈[T ] for all i, hence xi+1 < xi, and therefore x0 > x1 > . . . >
xi > . . ., a contradiction.
The set W has cardinality κ and it suﬃces to ﬁnd an order preserving
mapping from T −{∅} into (W, ≺). For every pair (x, y) such that x < y,
the tree T (x, y) on κ is not well-founded and has a branch h; let hx,y be the

504
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
leftmost branch of the tree T (x, y). Now let π : T −{∅} →W be as follows:
π(⟨x⟩) = ∅for every x ∈N, and for k ≥2,
π(⟨x0, . . . , xk−1⟩) = ⟨(x1↾k, x0↾k, hx1,x0↾k), . . . , (xk↾k, xk−1↾k, hxk,xk−1↾k)⟩.
As π(⟨x0, . . . , xk−1, xk⟩) ≺π(⟨x0, . . . , xk−1⟩), the mapping is order-preserv-
ing, completing the proof.
⊓⊔
Borel Codes
Every Borel set of reals is obtained, in fewer than ω1 steps, from open inter-
vals by taking complements and countable unions. We shall show how this
procedure can be coded by a function c ∈ωω. We shall deﬁne the set BC of
Borel codes and assign to each c ∈BC a unique Borel set Ac. The code c not
only describes the Borel set Ac but also describes the procedure by which the
set Ac is constructed from basic open sets.
Let I1, I2, . . . , Ik, . . . be a recursive enumeration of open intervals with
rational endpoints (i.e., the sequence of the pairs of endpoints is rercursive).
For each c ∈N, let
(25.42)
u(c)
and
vi(c)
(i ∈N)
be elements of N deﬁned as follows: If d = u(c), then d(n) = c(n + 1) for
all n; if d = vi(c), then d(n) = c(Γ(i, n)+1) for all n (where Γ is the canonical
one-to-one correspondence between N × N and N).
For 0 < α < ω1, we deﬁne sets Σα and Πα ⊂N as follows:
(25.43)
c ∈Σ1
if c(0) > 1;
c ∈Πα
if either c ∈Σβ ∪Πβ for some β < α
or c(0) = 0 and u(c) ∈Σα;
c ∈Σα (α > 1) if either c ∈Σβ ∪Πβ for some β < α
or c(0) = 1 and vi(c) ∈
β<α(Σβ ∪Πβ) for all i.
If c ∈Σα (if c ∈Πα), we call c a Σ0
α-code (a Π0
α-code). Let BC, the set of
all Borel codes, be
BC =

α<ω1
Σα =

α<ω1
Πα.
For every c ∈BC, we deﬁne a Borel set Ac as follows (we say that
c codes Ac):
(25.44)
if c ∈Σ1
then Ac = {In : c(n) = 1};
if c ∈Πα and c(0) = 0
then Ac = R −Au(c);
if c ∈Σα and c(0) = 1
then Ac = ∞
i=0 Avi(c).

25. Descriptive Set Theory
505
It is clear that for every α > 0, if c ∈Σα (if c ∈Πα), then Ac ∈Σ0
α
(Ac ∈Π0
α). Conversely, if B is a Σ0
α set (a Π0
α set), then there exists c ∈Σα
(c ∈Πα) such that B = Ac. This is proved by induction on α using facts
like: If ci, i ∈ω are elements of 
β<α Πβ, then there is c ∈Σα such that
ci = vi(c) for all i ∈ω.
Thus {Ac : c ∈BC} is the collection of all Borel sets.
Lemma 25.44. The set BC of all Borel codes is Π1
1.
Proof. Let us consider the following relation E on N:
(25.45)
x E y
if and only if
either y(0) = 0 and x = u(y),
or y(0) = 1 and x = vi(y) for some i ∈ω.
The relation E is arithmetical. If y ∈Σ1, then y is E-minimal (i.e., extE(y) =
∅) and vice versa; if y ∈Πα and x E y, then x ∈Σα, and if y ∈Σα (α > 1)
and x E y, then x ∈
β<α(Σβ ∪Πβ).
We claim that
(25.46)
y ∈BC ↔E is well-founded below y
↔there is no ⟨z0, z1, . . . zn, . . .⟩such that z0 = y
and that ∀n (zn+1 E zn).
By the remark following (25.45), if y ∈BC, then there can be no inﬁnite
descending sequence z0 = y, z1 E z0, z2 E z1, etc. Conversely, if E is well-
founded below y, let ρ denote the rank function for E on extE(y). By induc-
tion on ρ(x), one can see that every x ∈extE(y) is a Borel code, and ﬁnally
that y is itself a Borel code.
Now (25.46) gives a Π1
1 deﬁnition of the set BC and the lemma follows.
⊓⊔
Lemma 25.45. The properties Ac ⊂Ad, Ac = Ad, and Ac = ∅are Π1
1 prop-
erties of Borel codes.
Proof. We shall show that there are properties P, Q ⊂R × N such that
P is Π1
1 and Q is Σ1
1 and such that for every c ∈BC,
(25.47)
a ∈Ac ↔(a, c) ∈P ↔(a, c) ∈Q.
Then
Ac ⊂Ad ↔c, d ∈BC ∧∀a ((a, c) ∈Q →(a, d) ∈P),
Ac = Ad ↔c, d ∈BC ∧Ac ⊂Ad ∧Ad ⊂Ac,
Ac = ∅↔c ∈BC ∧∀a (a, c) /∈Q.
To ﬁnd P and Q, let x ∈N be ﬁxed. Let T be the smallest set T ⊂N
such that
(25.48)
x ∈T , and if y ∈T and z E y, then z ∈T .

506
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
The set T is countable. Let h : T →{0, 1} be a function with the following
property: For all y ∈T ,
(25.49)
if y(0) > 1, then h(y) = 1 if and only if
for some n, y(n) = 1 and a ∈In;
if y(0) = 0, then h(y) = 1 if and only if h(u(y)) = 0;
if y(0) = 1, then h(y) = 1 if and only if for some i, h(vi(y)) = 1.
Note that if x is a Borel code then there is a unique smallest countable
set T ⊂N with the property (25.48), and a unique function h with the
property (25.49); moreover, for every y ∈T we have h(y) = 1 if and only if
a ∈Ay. Thus we let
(25.50)
(a, x) ∈P ↔(∀countable T ⊂N)(∀h : T →{0, 1})
if (25.48) and (25.49) then h(x) = 1,
and
(25.51)
(a, x) ∈Q ↔(∃countable T ⊂N)(∃h : T →{0, 1})
(25.48) ∧(25.49) ∧h(x) = 1,
and it is clear that if c ∈BC, then a ∈Ac if and only if (a, c) ∈P if and only
if (a, c) ∈Q.
It is a routine matter to verify that (25.50) can be written in Π1
1 way and
(25.51) in a Σ1
1 way. (The quantiﬁers ∀T , ∀h, and ∃T , ∃h are the only ones
for which one needs quantiﬁers over N; note that for instance, ∀z (z E y →
y ∈T ) in (25.48) can be written as
(y(0) = 0 →u(y) ∈T ) ∧(y(0) = 1 →∀i (vi(y) ∈T )).)
⊓⊔
We shall now show that certain properties of Borel codes are absolute for
transitive models of ZF+ DC. (As usual, full ZF+ DC is not needed, and the
absoluteness holds for adequate transitive models.) If M is a transitive model
of ZF + DC and c ∈ωω is in M, then because the set BC is Π1
1, c is a Borel
code if and only if M ⊨c is a Borel code. By Lemma 25.45 the properties
of the codes Ac ⊂Ad, Ac = Ad, and Ac = ∅are Π1
1 and therefore absolute:
Ac = Ad holds if and only if AM
c
= AM
d , etc., where AM
c denotes the Borel set
in M coded by c. Moreover, since a ∈Ac is Π1
1, it follows that AM
c
= Ac ∩M
for every Borel code c ∈M.
Lemma 25.46. The following properties (of codes) are absolute for all tran-
sitive models M of ZF + DC:
Ae = Ac ∪Ad,
Ae = Ac ∩Ad,
Ae = R −Ac,
Ae = Ac △Ad,
Ae =
∞

n=0
Acn
(we assume that the codes c, d, e are in M, as is the sequence ⟨cn : n ∈ω⟩).

25. Descriptive Set Theory
507
We say that the operations ∪, ∩, −, △, ∞
n=0 on Borel sets with codes
in M are absolute for M.
Proof. If c0, c1, . . . , cn, . . . is a sequence of Borel codes in M, let c ∈N be
such that c(0) = 1 and that vi(c) = ci for all i ∈ω. Clearly, c is a Borel code,
c ∈M, and c codes (both in the universe and in M) the Borel set ∞
n=0 Acn.
Hence for any Borel code e ∈M, we have
AM
e
=
∞

n=0
AM
cn ↔AM
e = AM
c
↔Ae = Ac ↔Ae =


n=0
Acn
because Ae = Ac is absolute for M. Thus Ae = ∞
n=0 Acn is absolute.
An analogous argument shows that R−Ac is absolute, and the rest of the
lemma follows easily because the operations ∩, and △can be deﬁned from ∪
and −.

Historical Notes
For classical descriptive set theory, see the books of Luzin [1930] and Kuratow-
ski [1966]; the terminology is that of modern descriptive set theory based on the
analogy with Kleene’s hierarchies ([1955]).
The basic facts on Σ1
1 and Π1
1 sets are all in Luzin’s book [1930] and some
are of earlier origin: Lemma 25.10 was in eﬀect proved by Lebesgue in [1905], and
Corollary 25.13 and Lemma 25.17 were proved by Luzin and Sierpi´nski in [1923].
Theorem 25.19 appeared in Sierpi´nski [1925]. Theorem 25.36 is due to Kondˆo
[1939].
Theorem 25.20 is due to Shoenﬁeld [1961]. Previously, Mostowski had es-
tablished absoluteness of Σ1
1 and Π1
1 predicates (Theorem 25.4). Lemma 25.25:
L´evy [1965b].
The tree representation of Σ1
2 sets is implicit in Shoenﬁeld’s proof in [1961].
Lemma 25.22 is due to Kechris and Moschovakis [1972].
Theorem 25.23 is due to Mansﬁeld [1970] and Solovay [1969]. Lemma 25.24 was
formulated and ﬁrst proved by Mansﬁeld.
Theorem 25.26 and corollaries: In his announcement [1938] G¨odel stated that
the Axiom of Constructibility implies that there exists a nonmeasurable ∆1
2 set
and an uncountable Π1
1 set without a perfect subset. G¨odel did not publish the
proof but gave an outline in the second printing (in 1951) of his monograph [1940].

Novikov in [1951] gave a proof of the corollaries (Kuratowski’s paper [1948] contains
somewhat weaker results) and Addison in [1959] worked out the details of G¨odel
outline of the proof of the theorem.

26. The Real Line
This chapter deals with some properties of the real line, primarily with ques-
tions concerning measure and category. Among others we present the theorem
of Solovay establishing the consistency of the statement “every set of reals is
Lebesgue measurable.”
Random and Cohen reals
Let us consider generic extensions using either the algebra of Borel sets mod-
ulo the ideal of null sets or the algebra of Borel sets modulo the ideal of
meager sets.
Let B be the σ-algebra of Borel sets of reals, let Im and Ic (m for measure,
c for category) be the σ-ideals
Im = {B ∈B : µ(B) = 0},
Ic = {B ∈B : B is meager}
and let
(26.1)
Bm = B/Im = {[B]m : B ∈B},
Bc = B/Ic = {[B]c : B ∈B}
where [B]m and [B]c denote equivalence classes mod Im and mod Ic, respec-
tively. Bm and Bc are complete Boolean algebras and if Bn, n ∈ω, are Borel
sets then (in either Bm or Bc),
∞

n=0
[Bn] =

.
(Also, −[B] = [R −B]).
Forcing with Bc is the same as adjoining a Cohen generic real, see Exer-
cise 26.1.
Let M be a transitive model of ZF+DC. Let us consider Borel sets in M;
let B denote the collection of all Borel sets in M, and let Bm and Bc denote
the complete Boolean algebras (26.1) in M.
Let B be a Borel set in M. B has a Borel code c ∈M, B = Ac. Let us
denote B∗the Borel set in the universe coded by c. This deﬁnition does not
depend on the choice of c ∈BCM because by Lemma 25.45, if Ac = Ad, then
A∗
c = A∗
d. We recall that B = B∗∩M, for every B ∈B.

Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Lemma 26.1. “Ac is null” and “Ac is meager” are properties absolute for
all transitive models of ZF + DC.
Proof. Let M be a transitive model of ZF + DC. Let µ denote the Lebesgue
measure. First we claim that if c ∈M is a Σ0
1-code, then µM(AM
c ) = µ(Ac).
Let k0, k1, . . . , kn, . . . be all the k ∈N such that c(k) = 1; thus Ac is
the union ∞
n=0 Ikn of open intervals with rational endpoints. For each n, let
Xn = Ikn −(Ik0 ∪. . .∪Ikn−1); hence Ac = ∞
n=0 Xn and µ(Ac) = ∞
n=0 µ(Xn)
is absolute. Hence µM(AM
c ) = µ(Ac).
A similar argument shows that if c ∈M is a Π0
1-code, then µM(AM
c ) =
µ(Ac).
Next we claim that if c ∈M is a Π0
1-code, then Ac is nowhere dense if
and only if M ⊨Ac is nowhere dense. This is because d = u(c) ∈Σ1 and it is
easily veriﬁed (using open rational intervals) that “Ad is dense” is absolute.
Now we are ready to prove the lemma. Let us consider ﬁrst the property
“Ac is null.” We use the following properties of Lebesgue measure: (1) X is
null if and only if for every n ∈N, there is an open set G ⊃X of measure ≤
1/n, and (2) µ(X) > 0 if and only if there is a closed set F ⊂X of positive
measure.
If M ⊨Ac is null, then M satisﬁes
(26.2)
∀n ∃e (e ∈Σ1 and Ae ⊃Ac and µ(Ae) ≤1/n).
Since the part (. . .) of (26.2) is absolute, it is clear that (26.2) holds in V ,
and hence Ac is null.
If M ⊨Ac is not null, then M satisﬁes
(26.3)
∃e (e ∈Π1 and Ae ⊂Ac and µ(Ae) > 0).
Again, (. . .) is absolute, thus (26.3) holds in V and hence Ac is not null.
Finally, we consider the property “Ac is meager.” If M ⊨Ac is meager,
then M satisﬁes:
(26.4)
There exist cn ∈Π1, n = 0, 1, . . . , such that each Acn is nowhere
dense, and Ac ⊂∞
n=0 Acn.
Then (26.4) holds in V and so Ac is meager.
A Borel set B is not meager if and only if there is a nonempty open set G
such that B △G is meager. Thus if M ⊨Ac is not meager, then M satisﬁes
(26.5)
∃d ∃e (d ∈Σ1 and Ad ̸= ∅and Ae = Ac △Ad and Ae is meager).
Then (26.5) holds in V and hence Ac is meager.
⊓⊔
As before, it is not necessary that the transitive models in Lemma 26.1
satisfy all of ZF. The properties are absolute for all adequate transitive mod-
els, in particular for all transitive models of ZF−+ DC.

26. The Real Line

Lemma 26.2.
(i) If G is an M-generic ultraﬁlter on Bm, then there is a unique real
number xG such that for all B ∈B,
(26.6)
xG ∈B∗↔[B]m ∈G.
The formula (26.6) determines G and hence M[G] = M[xG].
(ii) If G is an M-generic ultraﬁlter on Bc, then there is a unique real
number xG such that for all B ∈B,
(26.7)
xG ∈B∗↔[B]c ∈G.
The formula (26.7) determines G and hence M[G] = M[xG].
Deﬁnition 26.3. If x is a real number and if x = xG for some G ⊂Bm
generic over M, then x is random over M. If x = xG for some G ⊂Bc generic
over M, then x is Cohen over M.
Proof. The same proof works for both (i) and (ii); let [B] denote [B]m in
case (i) and [B]c in case (ii).
First we claim that there is at most one real number x that satisﬁes
(26.8)
x ∈B∗↔[B] ∈G
(for all B ∈B).
If x satisﬁes (26.8), then x belongs to all B∗such that [B] ∈G. If x < y are
two real numbers, let r be a rational number such that x < r < y, and let A
be the interval (r, ∞) = {z ∈R : z > r}. Either [A] or [R −A] belongs to G
but x /∈A∗and y /∈(R −A)∗.
In order to show that there exists a real number x that satisﬁes (26.8),
let
(26.9)
x = sup{r : r is a rational number and [(r, ∞)] ∈G}.
By the genericity of G, there exists r such that [(r, ∞)] /∈G, and hence the
supremum (26.9) exists. Note also that x /∈M (by the genericity of G). We
shall show that x satisﬁes (26.8). We shall show, by induction on Borel codes
in M, that for every c ∈BCM,
(26.10)
x ∈A∗
c ↔[Ac] ∈G.
First we consider Σ0
1-codes (in M), and let us start with those c ∈Σ1∩M
that code a rational interval, i.e., such that c(n) = 1 for exactly one n; then
c codes the interval In. Let In = (p, q). We have
x ∈A∗
c
if and only if
p < x < q
if and only if
p < sup{r : [(r, ∞)] ∈G} < q
if and only if
[(p, ∞)] ∈G and [(q, ∞)] /∈G
if and only if
[(p, q)] ∈G
if and only if
[Ac] ∈G.

514
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Now if c ∈Σ1, then Ac = ∞
n=0 Ikn, where {kn : n = 0, 1, . . .} is the set
{k : c(k) = 1}, and we have
x ∈A∗
c
if and only if
x ∈∞
n=0 I∗
kn
if and only if
∃n (x ∈I∗
kn)
if and only if
∃n ([Ikn] ∈G)
if and only if
∞
n=0[Ikn] ∈G
if and only if
[∞
n=0 Ikn] ∈G
if and only if
[Ac] ∈G.
Next let α < ωM
1 and let c ∈Πα∩M, and let us assume that (26.10) holds
for all c ∈Σα ∩M. We may assume that c(0) = 0; then u(c) ∈Σα ∩M and
Au(c) = R −Ac, and we have
x ∈A∗
c
if and only if
x /∈A∗
u(c)
if and only if
[Au(c)] /∈G
if and only if
[Ac] ∈G.
Finally, the induction step for Σα is handled in a way similar to the case
for c ∈Σ1. Thus (26.10) holds for every c ∈BCM, and thus x is the unique
real number that satisﬁes (26.6) (in case of Bm) or (26.7) (in case of Bc).
⊓⊔
The following lemma provides a characterization of random and Cohen
reals.
Lemma 26.4. A real number is random over M if and only if it does not
belong to any null Borel set coded in M, and is Cohen over M if and only if
it does not belong to any meager Borel set coded in M.
Hence if R(M) and C(M) denote the sets of all random and all Cohen
reals over M, we have
(26.11)
R(M) = R∗−{A∗
c : c ∈BCM and A∗
c is null},
C(M) = R∗−{A∗
c : c ∈BCM and A∗
c is meager}.
Note that by Lemma 26.1, Ac is null (in M) if and only if A∗
c is null (in V ).
Proof. On the one hand, if x is random over M, let G be an M-generic
ultraﬁlter on Bm such that x = xG. Then if Ac is null then [Ac] /∈G, and
by (26.6), x /∈A∗
c. Similarly for x that is Cohen over M.
On the other hand, let x be such that x /∈A∗
c whenever Ac is null (and
c ∈M). First we observe that if [Ac] = [Ad] then Ac △Ad is null, hence
A∗
c △A∗
d is null and it follows that x belongs to A∗
c if and only if x belongs
to A∗
d. Let
(26.12)
G = {[Ac] : x ∈A∗
c}.
It is easy to see that G is a ﬁlter on Bm: If [Ac] ∈G and [Ad] ∈G, then
x ∈A∗
c ∩A∗
d and hence [Ac ∩Ad] ∈G; similarly, if [Ac] ≤[Ad] and [Ac] ∈G,
then [Ad] ∈G.

26. The Real Line
515
We shall show that G is M-generic. Since Bm satisﬁes the c.c.c., it suﬃces
to show that if {Acn : n ∈ω} ∈M is such that ∞
n=0[Acn] ∈G, then
some [Acn] is in G. But this is true because

Finally, we claim that x = xG. But this follows from (26.12), by the
genericity of G. Thus a real number x is random over M if and only if x /∈A∗
c
for any null Borel set Ac ∈M.
The proof is entirely similar for Cohen reals.
⊓⊔
Solovay Sets of Reals
Let M be a transitive model of ZFC. Let S be a set of reals. We say that the
set S is Solovay over M if there is a formula ϕ(x), with parameters in M,
such that for all reals x,
(26.13)
x ∈S ↔M[x] ⊨ϕ(x).
Lemma 26.5. Let S be a Solovay set of reals over M. There exist Borel sets
A and B such that
S ∩R(M) = A ∩R(M)
and
S ∩C(M) = B ∩C(M).
Proof. Let us prove the lemma for random reals. Let us consider the forcing
language in M associated with Bm. Let ˙G be the canonical name for a generic
ultraﬁlter on Bm, and let ˙a be the canonical name for a random real; i.e., let
˙a be the Bm-valued name deﬁned in M Bm from ˙G, by (26.6): ∥˙a = xG∥= 1.
Let ϕ(x) be a formula with parameters in M such that (26.13) holds for
all x. Let Ac ∈B be such that [Ac] = ∥ϕ(˙a)∥and let A = A∗
c. The set A is
a Borel set (in the universe); we claim that for all x ∈R(M), x belongs to S
if and only if x belongs to A. But if x is random over M, let G be M-generic
on Bm such that x = xG; then ˙a is a name for x and we have
x ∈S ↔M[x] ⊩ϕ(x) ↔M[G] ⊩ϕ(x) ↔∥ϕ(˙a)∥∈G ↔[Ac] ∈G ↔x ∈A∗
c.
⊓⊔
Corollary 26.6. Let S be a Solovay set of reals over M.
(i) If the set of all reals that are not random over M is null, then S is
Lebesgue measurable.
(ii) If the set of all reals that are not Cohen over M is meager, then S has
the property of Baire.
Proof. Under the assumptions of the corollary, S △A is null and S △B is
meager.

The L´evy Collapse
We review properties of the forcing that collapses uncountable cardinals to ℵ0,
and establish the homogeneity of the L´evy collapse.
If λ is an inﬁnite cardinal, let Pλ denote the set of all ﬁnite sequences
(26.14)
p = ⟨p(0), . . . , p(n −1)⟩
(n ∈ω)
of ordinals less than λ and let Col(ℵ0, λ) = B(Pλ).
The following lemma provides a characterization of the collapsing algebra:
Lemma 26.7. Let (Q, <) be a notion of forcing such that |Q| = λ > ℵ0 and
such that Q collapses λ onto ℵ0, i.e.,
∥ˇλ is countable∥B(Q) = 1.
Then B(Q) = Col(ℵ0, λ).
Proof. Without loss of generality we may assume that (Q, <) is a separative
partial ordering. We shall ﬁnd a dense subset of Q isomorphic to Pλ.
Let B = B(Q), and let ˙G be the canonical name for the generic ﬁlter
on Q. Let ˙f ∈V B be such that
∥˙f maps ˇω onto ˙G∥B = 1.
For each p ∈Pλ, we shall construct q(p) ∈Q such that D = {q(p) : p ∈Pλ}
is dense in Q and that p →q(p) is an isomorphism of Pλ onto D. We con-
struct q(p) by induction on the length of p.
If p = ⟨p(0)⟩, we construct q(p) as follows: Since Q collapses λ, there
exists an antichain W ⊂Q of size λ. Moreover, we may ﬁnd such W of size λ
with the additional property that each w ∈W decides
˙f(0), i.e., there is
qw ∈Q such that w ⊩˙f(0) = ˇqw. Thus let W∅be a maximal antichain with
these properties, W∅= {wξ : ξ < λ}, and for each p = ⟨p(0)⟩∈Pλ we let
q(p) = wξ, where ξ = p(0).
Having constructed q(p), where p = ⟨p(0), . . . , p(n −1)⟩, we construct
q(p⌢ξ), ξ < λ, as follows: We let Wp = {wξ : ξ < λ} be a maximal antichain
below q(p) such that |Wp| = λ and that each w ∈Wp decides ˙f(n). Then we
let q(p⌢ξ) = wξ, for all wξ ∈Wp.
The set D = {q(p) : p ∈Pλ} is clearly isomorphic to Pλ. Let us show that
D is dense in Q. Let q ∈Q be arbitrary. Since q ⊩ˇq ∈˙G, and q ⊩ˇq ∈ran( ˙f),
there is r ≤q and n < ω such that r ⊩q = ˙f(n). Now there is p ∈Pλ
of length n + 1 such that q(p) is compatible with r; since q(p) decides ˙f(n),
we necessarily have q(p) ⊩˙f(n) = ˇq. Therefore, q(p) ⊩ˇq ∈˙G. Since Q is
separative, it follows that q(p) ≤q. This proves that D is dense in Q.
⊓⊔
Corollary 26.8 (Kripke). If B is a complete Boolean algebra and |B| ≤λ
then B embeds as a complete subalgebra of Col(ℵ0, λ).

26. The Real Line
517
Proof. Let B be a complete Boolean algebra, |B| ≤λ. The notion of forcing
Q = B+ × Pλ has cardinality λ and collapses λ. By Lemma 26.7, B(Q) =
Col(ℵ0, λ). In other words, B ⊕Col(ℵ0, λ) is isomorphic to Col(ℵ0, λ), and so
B is isomorphic to a complete subalgebra of Col(ℵ0, λ).
⊓⊔
Lemma 26.9. Let B be a complete Boolean algebra, |B| = λ. Let C be a com-
plete subalgebra of B such that |C| < λ, and let h0 be an embedding of C
in Col(ℵ0, λ). Then there exists an embedding h of B in Col(ℵ0, λ) such that
h(c) = h0(c) for all c ∈C.
Proof. Let D be the image of C under the embedding h0. Let Col be an ab-
breviation for Col(ℵ0, λ); let ColC and ColD denote, respectively, the (ℵ0, ˇλ)-
collapsing algebra in the Boolean valued models V C and V D.
First, we ﬁnd an embedding k of B in C ∗ColC: Working in V C, we
observe that ˇλ is a cardinal and that B : C is a complete Boolean algebra
that collapses ˇλ onto ˇℵ0. Also, since B : C is a quotient of ˇB, B : C has
cardinality ˇλ. Thus by Corollary 26.8 (in V C), there is an embedding of B :C
in ColC.
It follows that there is an embedding k of C ∗(B : C) into C ∗ColC such
that k(c) = c for all c ∈C (and C is considered a complete subalgebra of
both those algebras). Since C ∗(B : C) = B, we have k : B →C ∗ColC such
that k(c) = c for all c ∈C.
Next we ﬁnd an isomorphism between Col and D ∗ColD: Working in V D,
we observe that ˇλ is a cardinal, and that Col : D collapses ˇλ onto ˇℵ0. Also,
since the algebra Col
∨has a dense subset ˇPλ of size ˇλ, its quotient Col : D
has a dense subset ˙Q of size ˇλ. Thus by Lemma 26.7 (in V D), there is an
isomorphism between Col : D and ColD.
By the same argument as above, we get an isomorphism π between Col =
D ∗(Col : D) and D ∗ColD such that π(d) = d for all d ∈D.
Since C and D are isomorphic, there exists an isomorphism σ : C∗ColC →
D ∗ColD such that σ(c) = h0(c) for all c ∈C. Thus we deﬁne h : B →Col
as follows: h(b) = π−1(σ(k(b))), for all b ∈B:

Corollary 26.10. Let G be a generic ﬁlter on Pλ and let X be a set of
ordinals in V [G]. Then either V [X] = V [G] or there exists a V [X]-generic
ﬁlter H on Pλ such that V [X][H] = V [G].
Proof. If λ is uncountable in V [X], then V [G] is a generic extension of V [X]
by ColV [X](ℵ0, κ), where κ = |λ|V [X]. However, Pκ is isomorphic in V [X]

518

to Pλ. If λ is countable in V [X] and V [X] ̸= V [G], then V [G] is a generic
extension of V [X] by a countable atomless notion of forcing Q. There is only
one atomless complete Boolean algebra with a countable dense subset and so
B(Q) is isomorphic (in V [X]) to B(Pλ).
⊓⊔
We now consider the L´evy collapse Col(ℵ0, <λ): Let λ be an inaccessible
cardinal. The conditions are functions p on ﬁnite subsets of λ × ω such that
p(α, n) < α whenever (α, n) ∈dom(p); p is stronger than q if p ⊃q.
Corollary 26.11 (The Factor Lemma). Let G be a generic ﬁlter on the
L´evy collapse P, and let X be a countable set of ordinals in V [G]. Then there
exists a V [X]-generic ﬁlter H on P such that V [X][H] = V [G].
Proof. For each ν < λ we have a decomposition of P into Pν × P ν where
Pν = {p ∈P : dom p ⊂ν × ω} and P ν = {p ∈P : dom p ⊂(λ −ν) × ω}.
Note that if ν is an inﬁnite cardinal then |Pν+1| = ν and so by Lemma 26.7
B(Pν+1) = Col(ℵ0, ν).
Let ν < λ be such that X ∈V [G ∩Pν+1]. By Corollary 26.10 there exists
a K ⊂Pν+1 generic over V [X] such that V [G ∩Pν+1] = V [X][K]. Hence
V [G] = V [X][K][G ∩P ν+1]; let H = K × (G ∩P ν+1).
⊓⊔
Theorem 26.12 (The Homogeneity of the L´evy Collapse). Let B =
Col(ℵ0, <λ). If A and A′ are isomorphic complete subalgebras of B such that
|A| = |A′| < |B| and if π0 is an isomorphism between A and A′, then there
exists an automorphism π of B such that π(a) = π0(a) for all a ∈A.
Proof. First we construct increasing sequences of complete subalgebras A0 ⊂
A1 ⊂. . . ⊂An ⊂. . ., and A′
0 ⊂A′
1 ⊂. . . ⊂A′
n ⊂. . ., as follows: We let
A0 = A and A′
0 = A′. There is ν1 such that A′
0 ⊂Bν1; we let A′
1 = Bν1.
The embedding π−1
0
of A′
0 in B can be extended to an embedding π−1
1
of A′
1
in B, and we let A1 = π−1
1 (A′
1). Then there is ν2 > ν1 such that A1 ⊂Bν2;
we let A2 = Bν2. Then π1 : A1 →B extends to some π2 : A2 →B, and we
let A′
2 = π2(A2). We proceed in this manner.
Clearly, ∞
n=0 An = ∞
n=0 A′
n = ∞
n=1 Bνn, and ∞
n=0 πn is an automor-
phism of this Boolean algebra. This automorphism extends to a unique au-
tomorphism πω of Bν = B(Pν), where ν = limn→∞νn.
Now B = Bν ⊕Bν where Bν = B(P ν), and the automorphism πω of Bν
can be extended to an automorphism π of Bν ⊕Bν by π(u, v) = (πωu, v).
⊓⊔
Corollary 26.13. If u and v are elements of Col(ℵ0, <λ) such that u ̸= 0, 1
and v ̸= 0, 1, then there exists an automorphism π of B such that π(u) = v.
⊓⊔
It follows that for any formula ϕ and all x1, . . . , xn, ∥ϕ(ˇx1, . . . , ˇxn)∥B is
either 1 or 0.

Theorem 26.14 (Solovay). Assume that there exits an inaccessible cardi-
nal.
(i) There is a model of ZF + DC in which all sets of real numbers are
Lebesgue measurable and have the property of Baire, and every un-

(ii) There is a model of ZFC in which every projective set of reals is

it contains a perfect subset.
Let M be a transitive model of ZFC and let κ be an inaccessible cardinal

of forcing that collapses each α < κ onto ℵ0: The conditions are functions p
on subsets of κ×ω such that each dom(p) is ﬁnite, and p(α, n) < α whenever
(α, n) ∈dom(p).
Let G be an M-generic ultraﬁlter on B. We shall show that in M[G] every
projective set of reals is Lebesgue measurable, has the property of Baire, and
if uncountable, then it contains a perfect subset.
In M[G], let S be the class of all inﬁnite sequences of ordinal numbers,
S = Ordω, and let N = HOD(S) be the class of all sets hereditarily ordinal
deﬁnable over S. The class N is a model of ZF; in fact, N is a model of
ZF + DC (see Lemma 26.15 below), and we shall show that in N every set
of reals is Lebesgue measurable, has the Baire property, and if uncountable,
then it contains a perfect subset.
Let s be an inﬁnite sequence of ordinals in M[G], let ϕ be a formula, and
let X ∈M[G] be a set such that
(26.15)
X = {x : M[G] ⊨ϕ(x, s)}.
X is (in M[G]) ordinal deﬁnable over S = Ordω. Conversely, if X ∈OD(S),
then for some formula ψ and a ﬁnite sequence ⟨s1, . . . , sk⟩of elements of S,
X = {x ∈M[G] : ψ(x, ⟨s1, . . . , sk⟩)}. Then clearly there exist ϕ and s ∈S
such that (26.15) holds. Hence the class OD(S) consists of all sets X of the
form (26.15)—sets deﬁnable in M[G] from a sequence of ordinals.
Note that every projective set of reals is deﬁnable from a sequence of
ordinals: If A is Σ1
n(a) for some a ∈N, then A is deﬁnable in HC from a,
and therefore A ∈OD(S).
Lemma 26.15.
(i) If f ∈M[G] is a function on ω with values in N, then f ∈N.
(ii) The model N satisﬁes the Principle of Dependent Choices.
Proof. (i) We show that if f is a function from ω into OD(S) then f ∈OD(S).
By (26.15), OD(S) = {OD(s) : s ∈S}; therefore there is a deﬁnable

520

function F on Ord ×S such that for each s ∈S, the function Fs(α) = F(α, s)
maps Ord onto OD(s). Let f : ω →OD(S). For each n, we choose αn and sn
such that f(n) = F(αn, sn). Clearly, f is deﬁnable from ⟨αn : n ∈ω⟩and
⟨sn : n ∈ω⟩. It is easy to ﬁnd a single sequence u of ordinals such that both
⟨αn : n ∈ω⟩and ⟨sn : n ∈ω⟩are deﬁnable from u. Hence f is deﬁnable
from u, and so f ∈OD(S).
(ii) In N, let ρ be a relation over a nonempty set A such that for every
x ∈A there is a y such that y ρ x. Since M[G] satisﬁes the Axiom of Choice,
there exists in M[G] a sequence a0, a1, . . . , an, . . . such that an+1 ρ an
for all n. However, by part (i) of this lemma, the sequence ⟨an : n ∈ω⟩is
in N.
⊓⊔
We shall now prove the part of Theorem 26.14 dealing with Lebesgue
measure and the Baire property, using Lemma 26.5.
Lemma 26.16. Let s ∈M[G] be an inﬁnite sequence of ordinals. The set of
all reals (in M[G]) that are not random over M[s] is null; the set of all reals
that are not Cohen over M[s] is meager.
Proof. Since the algebra B is κ-saturated, there exists a subalgebra D ⊂B
such that |D| < κ and M[s] = M[D ∩G]. It follows that κ is inaccessible
in M[s]; and since κ = ℵM[G]
1
, M[s] has only countably many subsets of ω.
Thus there are only countably many Borel codes in M[s]; and by (26.11), the
complement of the set R(M[s]) is the union of countably many null sets and
hence null. Similarly, the complement of C(M[s]) is meager.
⊓⊔
Lemma 26.17. Let X ∈M[G] be a set of reals that is deﬁnable in M[G]
from a sequence s of ordinals. Then X is (in M[G]) Solovay over M[s].
Proof. The proof uses the properties of the L´evy collapse discussed above,
in particular the Factor Lemma. We shall ﬁrst prove the following: Given
a formula ϕ, there is a formula ˜ϕ such that for every sequence of ordinals
x ∈M[G],
(26.16)
M[G] ⊨ϕ(x)
if and only if
M[x] ⊨˜ϕ(x).
The forcing conditions are ﬁnite and so the deﬁnition of the L´evy collapse P is
absolute for all models. We denote M P the Boolean valued model constructed
in M using P and if ψ is a formula and z ∈M P , we denote ∥ψ(z)∥M the
Boolean value (computed in M using P) of ψ(z). If a ∈M, then ˇa ∈M P is
the canonical name for a.
Let ˜ϕ(x) be the following formula
(26.17)
∥ϕ(ˇx)∥M[x] = 1.
Let x be a countable sequence of ordinals in M[G]; we shall show that
M[G] ⊨ϕ(x) if and only if M[x] ⊨˜ϕ(x). By the Factor Lemma there exists

26. The Real Line
521
an M[x]-generic ﬁlter H on P such that M[G] = M[x][H]. Arguing in M[x],
we invoke the homogeneity of the L´evy collapse: The Boolean value b =
∥ϕ(ˇx)∥M[x] is either 0 or 1. Since H is generic on P over M[x], ϕ(x) is true
in M[x][H] if b = 1 and false if b = 0. Hence ϕ(x) is true in M[G] if and only
if ˜ϕ(x) is true in M[x].
For a formula ϕ with two variables there is a formula ˜ϕ such that for all
x, y ∈M[G] ∩Ordω,
M[G] ⊨ϕ(x, y)
if and only if
M[x, y] ⊨˜ϕ(x, y).
Now let X ∈M[G] be a set of reals that is deﬁnable in M[G] from
a sequence of ordinals s. For some formula ϕ
x ∈X ↔M[G] ⊨ϕ(x, s)
for all reals x ∈M[G]. Thus we have, for all x ∈RM[G],
x ∈X ↔M[s][x] ⊨˜ϕ(s, x)
which shows that X is Solovay over M[s].
⊓⊔
Corollary 26.18. In M[G] every set of reals deﬁnable from a sequence of
ordinals (and in particular, every projective set of reals) is Lebesgue measur-
able and has the property of Baire.
Proof. This follows from Lemmas 26.5 26.16, and 26.17.
⊓⊔
Corollary 26.19. In N, every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable and has
the property of Baire.
Proof. Clearly, the model N has the same reals as the model M[G]. In partic-
ular, N and M[G] have the same Borel codes, and since AM
c
= AM[G]
c
∩N =
AM[G]
c
for every c ∈BCM[G], the two models have the same Borel sets.
If X ∈N is a set of reals, then X is deﬁnable in M[G] from a sequence
of ordinals and hence M[G] ⊨(X is Lebesgue measurable and has the Baire
property). Thus there are (in M[G]) Borel sets A, B, H, K such that X△A ⊂
H, X △B ⊂K, and H is null and K is meager (in M[G]). By Lemma 26.1,
N satisﬁes that H is null and K is meager, and hence N satisﬁes that X is
Lebesgue measurable and has the Baire property.
⊓⊔
We shall now ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 26.14 by showing that in M[G]
every uncountable set of reals deﬁnable from a countable sequence of ordinals
contains a perfect subset. Then it follows that in N, every uncountable set A
of reals has a perfect subset: If A is uncountable in N, then A is uncountable
in M[G] (by Lemma 26.15); and since A is deﬁnable from a sequence of
ordinals, A has a perfect subset F (in M[G]); but then N ⊨F is a perfect
set.

522
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
By Lemma 26.17, every set of reals deﬁnable in M[G] from s is Solovay
over M[s]; thus it suﬃces to prove that in M[G] every uncountable set of
reals, Solovay over M[s], contains a perfect subset. Furthermore, it suﬃces
to give the proof only for sets of reals Solovay over M since the general
case (Solovay over M[s]) follows from the special case by the Factor Lemma:
M[G] = M[s][H] is a generic extension of M[s] by the L´evy collapse. And
ﬁnally, we can consider subsets of the Cantor space instead of sets of reals.
Thus let A be, in M[G], an uncountable subset of {0, 1}ω, and let ϕ be
a formula (with parameters in M) such that for all x ∈{0, 1}ω in M[G],
x ∈A
if and only if
M[x] ⊨ϕ(x).
Since A is uncountable, there exists an x ∈A such that x /∈M. There
exists (in M) a complete subalgebra C ⊂B such that |C| < κ and that
x ∈M[G ∩C]. Let us consider the Boolean-valued model M C and the cor-
responding forcing relation ⊩. There exists a name ˙x ∈M C and a condition
p ∈C ∩G such that
(26.18)
p ⊩˙x ∈{0, 1}ω and ˙x /∈M and (M[ ˙x] ⊨ϕ( ˙x)).
Since P M(C) is countable in M[G], let D0, D1, . . . , Dn, . . . be an enumera-
tion (in M[G]) of all open dense subsets of C in M.
We shall construct conditions ps ∈C, for all ﬁnite 0–1 sequences s, as
follows:
Let p∅≤p be such that p∅∈D0. Given ps, there exists ns ∈ω such that
ps does not decide ˙x(ns) (because p ⊩˙x /∈M), and we let ps⌢0 and ps⌢1 be
such that ps⌢0 ⊩˙x(ns) = 0 and ps⌢1 ⊩˙x(ns) = 1; moreover, we choose ps⌢0
and ps⌢1 so that both are in the open dense set Dk where k is the length
of s.
For every z ∈{0, 1}ω, let Gz = {p ∈C : p ≥ps for some s ⊂z}. Clearly,
Gz ∩Dn ̸= ∅for every n, and hence Gz is an M-generic ultraﬁlter on C.
Let f(z) = ˙xGz be the interpretation of ˙x by Gz. Since Gz is generic, and
by (26.18), we have f(z) ∈A. Thus f is a function from {0, 1}ω into A.
It follows from the construction of f that f is one-to-one and continuous.
Thus f({0, 1}ω), the one-to-one continuous image of a perfect compact set,
is a perfect subset of A.
⊓⊔
Lebesgue Measurability of Σ1
2 Sets
Lemma 26.5 and its Corollary 26.6 provide the following equivalences:
Theorem 26.20 (Solovay). Let a ∈N.
(i) Every Σ1
2(a) set of reals is Lebesgue measurable if and only if almost
all reals are random over L[a].

26. The Real Line
523
(ii) Every Σ1
2(a) set of reals has the Baire property if and only if the set
{x : x is not a Cohen real over L[a]} is meager.
Proof. We prove only part (i) as part (ii) is similar.
First we note that every Σ1
2(a) set is Solovay over L[a]: Let A be Σ1
2(a),
and let T ∈L[a] be a tree on ω × ω1 such that for all x ∈N,
x ∈A
if and only if
T (x) is ill-founded.
By absoluteness of well-foundedness we have
x ∈A
if and only if
L[a][x] ⊨T (x) is ill-founded,
and hence A is Solovay over L[a].
If almost all reals are random over L[a] then every Σ1
2(a) set is Lebesgue
measurable by Corollary 26.18.
Thus assume that every Σ1
2[a] set is Lebesgue measurable; we shall prove
that the union
B = {Ac : c ∈BC, c ∈L[a] and Ac is null}
of all null Borel sets coded in L[a] is null. Let
C(x, c) ↔c ∈BC ∧Ac is null ∧x ∈Ac,
D(x, c) ↔C(x, c) ∧c ∈L[a] ∧∀d (d <L[a] c →¬C(x, d)),
and for x, y ∈B,
x ≼y ↔∃c ∃d (D(x, c) ∧D(x, d) ∧c ≤L[a] d).
The set B as well as the relations C, D and ≼are Σ1
2(a), and ≼is a prewell-
ordering of B. Under the assumption of Lebesgue measurability of Σ1
2(a) sets,
B is Lebesgue measurable and ≼is a measurable subset of N × N.
The order-type of N in <L[a] is ωL[a]
1
≤ω1. Hence for every y ∈B, the
set {x : x ≼y} is a countable union of null sets and therefore null. Thus
≼is a null set, by Fubini’s Theorem. By the same argument, the complement
of ≼in B × B is null as well, and hence B × B is null. Therefore B is a null
set.
⊓⊔
Corollary 26.21. If ωL[a]
1
< ω1, then every Σ1
2(a) set of reals is Lebesgue
measurable and has the Baire property.
Proof. Under the assumption, each L[a] has only countably many reals and
hence only countably many Borel codes, and it follows that almost all reals
are random over L[a]. Similarly for Cohen reals.

Ramsey Sets of Reals and Mathias Forcing
For an inﬁnite set A ⊂ω, let [A]ω denote the set of all inﬁnite subsets of A.
Let us consider the following partition property for [ω]ω: If S ⊂[ω]ω, we call
an inﬁnite set H ⊂ω homogeneous for S if either [H]ω ⊂S or [H]ω ∩S = ∅.
A set S ⊂[ω]ω is a Ramsey set if there exists an inﬁnite homogeneous set H
for S.
A consequence of the Axiom of Choice is that not every set S ⊂[ω]ω is
Ramsey (Exercise 26.3). We prove that the Axiom of Choice is necessary, and
that all analytic sets are Ramsey.
Identifying subsets of ω with their characteristic functions, we con-
sider [ω]ω as a Gδ subspace of the Cantor space. We prove the following
theorems:
Theorem 26.22 (Galvin-Prikry, Silver). Every analytic subset of [ω]ω
is Ramsey.
Theorem 26.23 (Mathias). Let M[G] and N be the models from Theo-
rem 26.14.
(i) In N, every subset of [ω]ω is Ramsey.
(ii) In M[G], every projective subset of [ω]ω is Ramsey.
The method of proof of both theorems uses a notion of forcing introduced
by Mathias, and a topology based on the Mathias forcing.
Deﬁnition 26.24 (Mathias Forcing). A forcing condition is a pair (s, A)
where s is a ﬁnite subset of ω and A is an inﬁnite subset of ω such that
max s < min A. A condition (s, A) is stronger than a condition (t, B) if
(i) t is an initial segment of s;
(ii) A ⊂B;
(iii) s −t ⊂B.
(26.19)
(Compare this with the Prikry forcing (21.15).) For the rest of this section,
(s, A) will denote a Mathias forcing condition.
For s ∈[ω]<ω and A ∈[ω]ω, let A∖s = A−(max(s)+1) = {n ∈A : n > k
for all k ∈s}, and
(26.20)
[s, A]ω = {X ∈[ω]ω : s ⊂X and X ∖s ⊂A}.
Note that [∅, A]ω = [A]ω, and [s, A]ω ⊂[t, B]ω if and only if (s, A) is
stronger than (t, B).
Deﬁnition 26.25. The Ellentuck topology on [ω]ω has as basic open sets the
sets of the form [s, A]ω where s ∈[ω]<ω and A ∈[ω]ω.
Note that every open set in the usual topology is open in the Ellentuck
topology.

26. The Real Line
525
Deﬁnition 26.26 (Galvin-Prikry).
(i) A set S ⊂[ω]ω is completely Ramsey if for every (s, A) there exists an
inﬁnite H ⊂A such that either [s, H]ω ⊂S or [s, H]ω ∩S = ∅.
(ii) A set N ⊂[ω]ω is Ramsey null if for every (s, A) there exists an inﬁnite
H ⊂A such that [s, H]ω ∩S = ∅.
We ﬁrst observe that every Ramsey null set is nowhere dense in the El-
lentuck topology: S is nowhere dense if and only if for every basic open set
there exists a basic open subset disjoint from S, i.e.,
∀(s, A) ∃(t, B) < (s, A) [t, B]ω ∩S = ∅.
Let S be completely Ramsey, let int(S) denote the interior of S (in the
Ellentuck topology), and let N = S −int(S). For every (s, A) there exists
an H ⊂A such that either [s, H]ω ⊂S, and since [s, H]ω is open, we have
[s, H]ω ⊂int(S); or [s, H]ω ∩S = ∅, and in either case [s, H]ω ∩N = ∅. Hence
N is Ramsey null, and therefore nowhere dense. It follows that S = int(S)∪N
has the Baire property.
We shall prove the following (for the Ellentuck topology):
Lemma 26.27.
(i) A set S is completely Ramsey if and only if it has the Baire property.
(ii) A set N is Ramsey null if and only if it is nowhere dense if and only
if it is meager.
Toward the proof of Lemma 26.27, let S be a given subset of [ω]ω. Given
(s, A) we say that A accepts s if [s, A]ω ⊂S; we say that A rejects s if no
X ⊂A accepts s.
Lemma 26.28. There is an X that accepts or rejects each of its ﬁnite subset.
Proof. Let X0 be such that X0 either accepts or rejects ∅(if no X accepts ∅
then X0 = ω rejects ∅). Let a0 be the least element of X0. Let X1 ⊂X
be such that X1 either accepts or rejects each subset of {a0}. Let a1 be the
least element of X1 ∖{a0}, and let X2 ⊂X1 be such that X2 accepts or
rejects each subset of {a0, a1}. We continue in this fashion and construct
a set X = {a0, a1, a2, . . .}. This X accepts or rejects each of its ﬁnite subsets.
⊓⊔
Lemma 26.29. There is a Y that either accepts ∅or rejects each of its ﬁnite
subsets.
Proof. Let X be as in Lemma 26.28, and assume that it rejects ∅. We
construct Y = {a0, a1, . . .} ⊂X as follows: Assume we have constructed
a0, . . . , an−1 such that X rejects each subset of {a0, . . . , an−1}. For every
s ⊂{a0, . . . , an−1} there are only ﬁnitely many z ∈X such that X accepts

526
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
s ∪{z} (otherwise there is an inﬁnite Z ⊂X such that X accepts s ∪{z}
for each z ∈Z; then Z accepts s and hence X does not reject s). There-
fore we can ﬁnd an ∈X ∖{a0, . . . , an−1} such that X rejects each subset of
{a0, . . . , an}.
⊓⊔
Lemma 26.30. Every open set is Ramsey.
Proof. Let S be open, and let X be as in Lemma 26.29. If X accepts ∅then
[X]ω = [∅, X]ω ⊂S.
If X rejects each of its ﬁnite subsets, we claim that [X]ω ∩S = ∅. Oth-
erwise, there is an inﬁnite Y ⊂X such that Y ∈S. Since S is open, there
is an open neighborhood of Y included in S; i.e., there exists a ﬁnite s ⊂Y
such that [s, Y ∖s]ω ⊂S. Hence Y accepts s, contrary to the assumption
that X rejects s.
⊓⊔
Lemma 26.31. Every open set is completely Ramsey.
Proof. Let S be open and let (s, A) be arbitrary. Let f : ω →A be a one-to-
one increasing enumeration of A, and for each X ∈[ω]ω, let f ∗(X) = s∪f“X.
The function f ∗is a continuous function from [ω]ω into [ω]ω. Let T = {X :
f ∗(X) ∈S}; T is open and hence Ramsey. If K is a homogeneous set for T ,
then H = f“K satisﬁes either [s, H]ω ⊂S or [s, H]ω ∩S = ∅.
⊓⊔
Lemma 26.32. Every nowhere dense set is Ramsey null.
Proof. Let S be nowhere dense; we may also assume that S is closed. Let
(s, A) be arbitrary. By Lemma 26.31 there is an H ⊂A such that either
[s, H]ω ⊂S or [s, H]ω ∩S = ∅. But [s, H]ω ⊂S is impossible since S is
nowhere dense.
⊓⊔
Lemma 26.33. If S = ∞
n=0 Sn and each Sn is Ramsey null then S is Ram-
sey null.
Proof. Let (s, A) be arbitrary. We construct an inﬁnite H = {a0, a1, a2, . . .} ⊂
A as follows: Let X0 ⊂A be such that [s, X0]ω ∩S0 = ∅, and let a0 be the
least element of X0. Find an X1 ⊂X0 ∖{a0} such that for every t with
s ⊂t ⊂s ∪{a0}, [t, X1]ω ⊂S1. Having constructed X0 ⊃X1 ⊃. . . ⊃Xn,
let an = min(Xn) and ﬁnd an Xn+1 ⊂Xn ∖{a0, . . . , an} such that for
every t with s ⊂t ⊂s ∪{a0, . . . , an}, [t, Xn+1]ω ⊂Sn+1. It follows that
[s, H]ω ∩S = ∅.
⊓⊔
Proof of Lemma 26.27. By Lemmas 26.32 and 26.33, every meager set is
Ramsey null, proving (ii). To prove (i), let S be a set with the Baire property;
we have S = G△M where G is open and M is meager. Let (s, A) be arbitrary.
By (ii) there is some X ⊂A such that [s, X]ω ∩M = ∅. By Lemma 26.31
there is some H ⊂X such that either [s, H]ω ⊂G or [s, H]ω ∩G = ∅. It
follows that either [s, H]ω ⊂S or [s, H]ω ∩S = ∅.
⊓⊔

26. The Real Line
527
Proof of Theorem 26.22. Every analytic set (in the usual topology) is the
result of the Suslin operation A applied to closed sets. Every closed set is
closed in the Ellentuck topology and therefore has the Baire property (in the
Ellentuck topology). It can be proved (as in Theorem 11.18) that the Baire
property in the Ellentuck topology is preserved under the operation A. Hence
every analytic set is completely Ramsey, by Lemma 26.27(i).
⊓⊔
The combinatorial content of Lemma 26.27 is this property of Mathias
forcing (compare with Lemma 21.12):
Lemma 26.34. Let σ be a sentence of the forcing language and let (s, A)
be a condition. Then there exists an inﬁnite set B ⊂A such that (s, B)
decides σ.
Proof. Let Q+ = {p : p ⊩σ}, Q−= {p : p ⊩¬σ}, S+ = {[t, X]ω : (t, X) ∈
Q+} and S−= {[t, X]ω : (t, X) ∈Q−}. Since the complement of S+ ∪S−
is nowhere dense, there exists, by Lemma 26.27, an inﬁnite B ⊂A such that
[s, B]ω ⊂S+ or [s, B]ω ⊂S−. We claim that in the former case (s, B) ⊩σ
and in the latter case (s, B) ⊩¬σ. This is because for every (t, X) < (s, B)
there exists some (u, Y ) < (t, X) which is in Q+ (or Q−).
⊓⊔
If G is a generic ﬁlter on the Mathias forcing (over a ground model M),
let xG be the inﬁnite set
(26.21)
xG = {s : (s, A) ∈G for some A};
xG is called a Mathias real (over M). The ﬁlter G is determined by x = xG,
as
(26.22)
G = Gx = {(s, A) : s ⊂x ⊂s ∪A}.
Mathias reals admit the following characterization, analogous to Theo-
rem 21.14:
Theorem 26.35 (Mathias). Let M be a transitive model of ZFC. An in-
ﬁnite set x ⊂ω is a Mathias real over M if and only if for every maximal
almost disjoint family A ∈M of subsets of ω, there exists an X ∈A such
that x −X is ﬁnite.
Proof. The condition is necessary: If A is a maximal almost disjoint family
then D = {(s, A ∖s) : s ∈[ω]<ω, A ∈A} is a predense set of forcing
conditions, and it follows that if x is a Mathias real then Gx ∩D ̸= ∅.
For the proof of suﬃciency, let D be an open dense set of Mathias forc-
ing conditions (in the ground model). We need a more detailed analysis of
Mathias forcing. If X ⊂ω is inﬁnite and max s < min X we say that X cap-
tures (s, D) if for every inﬁnite Y ⊂X there exists an initial segment t of Y
such that (s ∪t, X) ∈D.

528
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Lemma 26.36. For every inﬁnite set A ⊂ω and for every ﬁnite s ⊂ω there
exists an inﬁnite set X ⊂A ∖s such that X captures (s, D).
Proof. We construct a sequence Y0 ⊃Y1 ⊃. . . ⊃Yn ⊃. . . of inﬁnite sets
and a sequence m0 < m1 < . . . < mn < . . . such that mn = min Yn, as
follows: Let Y0 = A ∖s. Given Yn, we can ﬁnd Yn+1 ⊂Yn ∖{mn} with the
property that for every t ⊂{m0, . . . , mn}, if there exists a Y ⊂Yn such that
(s ∪t, Y ) ∈D, then (s ∪t, Yn+1) ∈D (we use the fact that D is an open set
of conditions).
Let Y = {m0, m1, . . . , mn, . . .}. As the set U = {[t, S]ω : (t, S) ∈D}
is a dense open subset of [ω]ω (in the Ellentuck topology) it follows from
Lemma 26.27(ii) that there exists an inﬁnite set X ⊂Y such that [s, X]ω ⊂U.
We claim that X captures (s, D).
If Z ⊂X is inﬁnite then because s∪Z ∈U, there exist an initial segment t
of Z and an inﬁnite S ⊂ω such that (s ∪t, S) ∈D and s ∪Z ∈[s ∪t, S]ω. It
follows that (s ∪t, Z ∖t) ∈D, and if max t = mn, we have (s ∪t, Yn+1) ∈D.
It follows that (s ∪t, X ∖t) ∈D.
⊓⊔
Lemma 26.37. For every inﬁnite A ⊂ω there exists an X ⊂A such that
for every s, X ∖s captures (s, D).
Proof. By Lemma 26.36 there exist sets Xs ⊂A such that for each s,
Xs captures (s, D). We construct X0 ⊃X1 ⊃. . . ⊃Xn ⊃. . . and
m0 < m1 < . . . < mn < . . . such that mn = min Xn, as follows: Let
X0 = X∅. Given Xn, we ﬁnd an Xn+1 such that for every s with max s = mn,
Xn+1 captures (s, D) (here we use the fact that if X captures and X′ ⊂X,
then X′ also captures). Let X = {m0, m1, . . . , mn, . . .}. It follows that X ∖s
captures (s, D) for every s.
⊓⊔
We now ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 26.35. Let x ⊂ω be inﬁnite and
assume that for every maximal almost disjoint A ∈M there exists an X ∈A
such that x −X is ﬁnite. By Lemma 26.37 there exists (in M) a maximal
almost disjoint family A such that for every X ∈A and every s, X ∖s
captures (s, D). Let X ∈A be such that x −X is ﬁnite, and let s be an
initial segment of x such that x ⊂s ∪X. As X ∖s captures (s, D), we have
(in M)
(26.23)
∀inﬁnite Y ⊂X ∖s ∃initial segment t ⊂Y such that
(s ∪t, X ∖t) ∈D.
Consider the set of ﬁnite sets W = {t ⊂X ∖s : (s ∪t, X ∖t) /∈D} partially
ordered by the relation t ≼t′ if and only if t′ is an initial segment of t. Then
(26.23) states that (W, ≺) is well-founded in M. By absoluteness, (W, ≺) is
well-founded in any larger universe, and so (26.23) holds in any V ⊃M. In
particular, letting Y = x∖s, we obtain an initial segment t of x∖s such that
(s ∪t, X ∖t) ∈D, and since s∪t is an initial segment of x and x ⊂s∪t∪X,
the ﬁlter Gx from (26.22) meets D. Since D was an arbitrary open dense set
in M, Gx is generic, and x is a Mathias real over M.
⊓⊔

26. The Real Line

Corollary 26.38. If x is a Mathias real over M and y ⊂x is inﬁnite, then
y is Mathias over M.
Proof of Theorem 26.23. Let M[G] be a generic extension of M by the L´evy
collapse. We shall prove that every set of reals in M[G] that is deﬁnable
from a countable sequence of ordinals is Ramsey. Thus let u be a countable
sequence of ordinals in M[G] and let X ∈M[G] be a subset of [ω]ω deﬁnable
from u. By Lemma 26.17 X is a Solovay set over M[u] and so for some
formula ϕ,
x ∈X
if and only if
M[u, x] ⊨ϕ(x)
for all x ∈[ω]ω ∩M[G].
Let us consider the Mathias forcing in M[u], and let ˙x be the canonical
name for a Mathias generic real. By Lemma 26.34 there exists an inﬁnite set
A ∈M[u] such that (∅, A) decides ϕ( ˙x). Assume that (∅, A) ⊩ϕ( ˙x) as the
other case is similar.
Since ℵM[G]
1
is inaccessible in M[u], there exists a Mathias generic ﬁlter
in M[G] containing (∅, A); therefore there exists a Mathias real x over M[u]
such that x ⊂A. We complete the proof by verifying that [x]ω ⊂X.
If y is an inﬁnite subset of x then by Corollary 26.38, y is a Mathias real
over M[u]. Since y ⊂A and (∅, A) ⊩ϕ( ˙x), we have M[u][y] ⊨ϕ(y) and so
y ∈X.
⊓⊔
Measure and Category
Lebesgue measure and Baire property have been the most thoroughly inves-
tigated properties of sets of reals, both in the classical descriptive set theory,
and in the modern era of independence results. We shall touch brieﬂy on
the subject, with emphasis on the role of Martin’s Axiom and combinato-
rial “cardinal invariants.” We start with the following application of Martin’s
Axiom:
Theorem 26.39 (Martin-Solovay). If Martin’s Axiom holds, then the
union of fewer than 2ℵ0 null sets is null, and the union of fewer than 2ℵ0
meager sets is meager.
Proof. First we prove that the union of fewer than 2ℵ0 null sets is mull. Let
κ < 2ℵ0 and let Aα, α < κ, be null sets of reals. Let A = 
α<κ Aα. In order
to prove that A is null, it suﬃces to ﬁnd, for each ε > 0, an open set U ⊃A
such that µ(U) ≤ε. Let ε > 0.
We apply Martin’s Axiom as follows. Let P be the set of all open sets of
measure < ε, and let p ∈P be stronger than q ∈P if p ⊃q. We claim that
the notion of forcing (P, ⊃) satisﬁes the countable chain condition.
It suﬃces to show that if W is an uncountable subset of P, then there
are p, q ∈W, p ̸= q, such that µ(p ∪q) < ε. Let S be the countable set of

530
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
all unions of ﬁnitely many open intervals with rational endpoints. If W ⊂P
is uncountable, then there exist an n ∈N and an uncountable Z ⊂W such
that µ(p) < ε −1/n for all p ∈Z. For each p ∈Z, let p∗∈S be such that
p∗⊂p and µ(p −p∗) < 1/n. Since S is countable, there exist p, q ∈Z, p ̸= q,
such that p∗= q∗. Then µ(p ∪q) < ε.
For each α < κ, let Dα = {p ∈P : Aα ⊂p}. Each Dα is a dense subset
of P: If p ∈P, then since Aα is null, there exists an open set q ⊃Aα such
that µ(p) + µ(q) < ε, and hence p ∪q ∈Dα and p ∪q ⊃p.
By Martin’s Axiom, there exists a ﬁlter G ⊂P such that G ∩Dα ̸= ∅
for all α < κ. Let U = {p : p ∈G}. It is clear that A ⊂U and it
remains to show that µ(U) ≤ε. We use the well-known fact (easy to verify)
that if U = {p : p ∈G}, then there is a countable H ⊂G such that
U = {p : p ∈H}. Thus if µ(U) > ε, there exist p1, . . . , pn ∈H such that
µ(p1 ∪. . . ∪pn) > ε. But this is impossible: Since G is a ﬁlter on P, we have
p ∪q ∈G whenever p ∈G and q ∈G; thus p1 ∪. . . ∪pn ∈G and hence
µ(p1 ∪. . . ∪pn) < ε.
This completes the proof that the union of < 2ℵ0 null sets is null if
MA holds.
In order to show that the union of less than 2ℵ0 meager sets is meager, it
suﬃces to show that the union of less than 2ℵ0 closed nowhere dense sets is
meager. The following lemma will complete the proof:
Lemma 26.40. Assume Martin’s Axiom. Let κ < 2ℵ0 and let Aα, α < κ,
be closed nowhere dense sets of reals. Let A = 
α<κ Aα. Then there exists
a countable family of dense open sets Hi, i = 0, 1, 2, . . ., such that A is
disjoint from ∞
i=0 Hi.
Proof. We apply Martin’s Axiom as follows. Let P be the set of all ﬁnite
sequences of pairs
p = ⟨(U0, E0), (U1, E1), . . . , (Un, En)⟩
such that
(i) each Ui is the union of ﬁnitely many open intervals with ratio-
nal endpoints;
(ii) each Ei is a ﬁnite subset of κ; and
(iii) for each i, Ui is disjoint from 
α∈Ei Aα.
(26.24)
A condition p′ = ⟨(U ′
0, E′
0), . . . , (U ′
m, E′
m)⟩is stronger than a condition p =
⟨(U0, E0), . . . , (Un, En)⟩if
(i) m ≥n; and
(ii) for each i ≤n, U ′
i ⊃Ui and E′
i ⊃Ei.
(26.25)
It is clear that this notion of forcing satisﬁes the countable chain condition:
If two conditions have the same U0, . . . , Un, then they are compatible, and
there are only countably many sequences ⟨U0, . . . , Un⟩.

26. The Real Line
531
Let Ik, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , be an enumeration of all open intervals with
rational endpoints. We let, for each α < κ and all i, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,
(26.26)
Dα = {p : p = ⟨(U0, E0), . . . , (Un, En)⟩and α ∈Ei for some i ≤n},
Ei,k = {p : p = ⟨(U0, E0), . . . , (Un, En)⟩and Ui ∩Ik ̸= ∅}.
Since each Aα, α < κ, is nowhere dense, it is clear that for all i an k, every
condition can be extended to a condition p ∈Ei,k, and hence each Ei,k is
dense in P. Also, each Dα is dense in P.
By Martin’s Axiom, there exists a ﬁlter G ⊂P such that G ∩Dα ̸= ∅for
all α < κ, and G ∩Ei,k ̸= ∅for all i, k ∈ω. For each i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , we let
Hi = {Ui : (∃p ∈G) p = ⟨. . . , (Ui, Ei), . . .⟩}.
Since Ei,k is a dense set of conditions, for all k, Hi is a dense open set of
reals.
Now if α < κ, then because Dα is dense, there exists i ∈ω such that
Hi is disjoint from Aα, and hence Aα is disjoint from ∞
i=0 Hi. Therefore
A is disjoint from ∞
i=0 Hi.
⊓⊔
Corollary 26.41. If MA holds, then both the algebra of Lebesgue measurable
sets and the algebra of sets with the Baire property are 2ℵ0-complete, and
moreover, Lebesgue measure is 2ℵ0-additive, i.e., if κ < 2ℵ0 and Aα, α < κ,
are pairwise disjoint, then
(26.27)

α<κ

α<κ
µ(Aα).
Proof. We prove by induction on κ < 2ℵ0 that if Aα, α < κ, are Lebesgue
measurable, then A = 
α<κ Aα is Lebesgue measurable. Given Aα, α < κ, let
Bα = Aα −
β<α Aβ, for each α < κ. The sets Bα are Lebesgue measurable
(by the induction hypothesis), and being pairwise disjoint, all but countably
many are null. It follows from the theorem that A = 
α<κ Bα is Lebesgue
measurable. The same argument proves (26.27) (see also Lemma 10.6), and
the property of Baire is analogous.
⊓⊔
Corollary 26.42. If MA holds and if 2ℵ0 > ℵ1, then every Σ1
2 set is
Lebesgue measurable and has the property of Baire.
Proof. If A is Σ1
2(a), then since (2ℵ0)L[a] = ℵL[a]
1
≤ℵ1, the set of all reals
that are not random over L[a] is the union of at most ℵ1 null sets, hence
null (by Theorem 26.39). By Theorem 26.20, A is Lebesgue measurable. The
Baire property is analogous.
⊓⊔
The proof of Theorem 26.39 yields a slightly better result: It shows that
for every κ ≤2ℵ0, MAκ implies the κ-additivity of the ideals of null and
meager sets. The study of additivity of measure and category initiated by

532
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Theorem 26.39 developed into an extensive theory that established a detailed
relationship between various properties of measure and category. We refer the
reader to Bartoszy´nski’s article [∞] in the Handbook of Set Theory.
Deﬁnition 26.43. (i) Additivity:
add(LM) = the least cardinal κ such that the union of some family of κ null
sets is not null,
add(BP) = the least cardinal κ such that the union of some family of κ mea-
ger sets is not meager.
(ii) Covering:
cov(LM) = the least cardinal κ for which R is the union of κ null sets,
cov(BP) = the least cardinal κ for which R is the union of κ meager sets.
(iii) Uniformity:
unif(LM) = the least cardinal κ such that there exists a set of cardinality κ
that is not null,
unif(BP) = the least cardinal κ such that there exists a set of cardinality κ
that is not meager.
(iv) Coﬁnality:
cof(LM) = the least cardinality of a family F of null sets such that every
null set is included in a set from F,
cof(BP) = the least cardinality of a family F of meager sets such that every
meager set is included in a set from F.
The proof of Theorem 26.39 shows that MAκ implies add(LM) ≥κ and
add(BP) ≥κ. In a series of results a complete picture of inequalities emerged
between these properties. First, it is obvious that add ≤cov ≤cof and
add ≤unif ≤cof, both for measure and category (Exercise 26.5). Secondly,
two of the inequalities have been known classically; see Exercise 26.7.
Before we proceed we introduce two cardinal invariants that are not only
relevant in this context but appear frequently in results in set-theoretic topol-
ogy. First some notation:
∀∞
means
for all but ﬁnitely many n ∈ω,
∃∞
means
for inﬁnitely many n ∈ω.
A family F ⊂ωω is a dominating family if
(26.28)
∀g ∈ωω ∃f ∈F ∀∞n g(n) < f(n);
F us an unbounded family if
(26.29)
∀g ∈ωω ∃f ∈F ∃∞n g(n) ≤f(n).

26. The Real Line
533
Deﬁnition 26.44. The dominating number
d = the least cardinality of a dominating family;
the bounding number
b = the least cardinality of an unbounded family.
It is clear that b ≤d, and ℵ1 ≤b ≤d ≤c. Martin’s Axiom implies that
b = d = c; see Exercise 26.8.
To see the signiﬁcance of b and d for Baire category, notice that for each
f ∈ωω and each k, the set {g ∈ωω : ∀n ≥k g(n) < f(n)} is nowhere
dense (in the space N). Hence if g < f means ∀∞n g(n) < f(n), each set
{g : g < f} is meager, and it follows that b ≤unif(BP) and cov(BP) ≤d; see
Exercise 26.10.
The relationship between the invariants deﬁned in 26.43 and 26.44 can be
illustrated by the following diagram:
add(LM)
add(BP)
cov(BP)
unif(LM)
b
d
cov(LM)
unif(BP)
cof(BP)
cof(LM)
The cardinals become larger as one moves right and up. Exercises 26.5, 26.7,
and 26.10 give proofs of the easy inequalities. The remaining inequalities are
given by these theorems (that we state without proofs):
Theorem 26.45 ((i) Truss, Miller; (ii) Fremlin).
(i) add(BP) = min{b, cov(BP)}.
(ii) cof(BP) = max{d, unif(BP)}.
Theorem 26.46 (Bartoszy´nski, Raisonnier-Stern).
(i) add(LM) ≤add(BP).
(ii) cof(BP) ≤cof(LM).
It is no accident that each result is accompanied by a dual version: There
is a general theory that explains this duality. (For details, see Bartoszy´nski’s
Handbook article.) For instance, consider Theorem 26.46. Both (i) and (ii)
can be proved from this general result (see Exercise 26.11):

534
Part II. Advanced Set Theory
Theorem 26.47 (Pawlikowski). Let Ic and Im be the ideal of all meager
sets and the ideal of null sets. There exists a function ϕ : Ic →Im with
the property that for every family F ⊂Im, if  F is null then  ϕ−1(F) is
meager.
⊓⊔
A signiﬁcant part of the theory of invariants of measure and category
is the characterization of invariants in terms of functions from ω to ω. The
cardinals cov(BP) and unif(BP) were so described ﬁrst by Miller, with the
ﬁnal form due to Bartoszy´nski:
Theorem 26.48. (i) cov(BP) is the least cardinality of a family F ⊂ωω
such that
(26.30)
∀g ∈ωω ∃f ∈F ∀∞n f(n) ̸= g(n).
(ii) unif(BP) is the least cardinality of a family F ⊂ωω such that
∀g ∈ωω ∃f ∈F ∃∞n f(n) = g(n).
⊓⊔
(26.31)
For the easy direction of (i) and (ii) see Exercise 26.12.
The key ingredient of Theorem 26.46(i) is the following characterization
of add(LM):
Theorem 26.49. add(LM) is the least cardinality of a family F ⊂ωω such
that
(26.32)
∀ϕ ∈S ∃f ∈F ∃∞n f(n) /∈ϕ(n),
where S is the set of all functions ϕ : ω →[ω]<ω such that |ϕ(n)| = n for
all n.
⊓⊔
See Exercise 26.13 for the proof of add(LM) ≤cov(BP).
The diagram, along with Theorem 26.45, gives a complete relationship
among these invariants. Nothing else can be proved in ZFC, and models have
been constructed verifying all independence results based on the diagram.
We conclude this chapter with two of the earliest independence results
concerning measure and category. We give an example of a model where
2ℵ0 is large and the set R ∩L is not Lebesgue measurable, and another
example where 2ℵ0 is large and R ∩L does not have the Baire property.
Lemma 26.50. If there exists a nonconstructible real, then:
(i) R ∩L is either null or not Lebesgue measurable.
(ii) R ∩L is either meager or does not have the Baire property.
Proof. (i) Let S be the set of all constructible reals in the unit interval [0, 1].
Let a be a nonconstructible real. For each n > 0, let Sn = {x+(a/n) : x ∈S}.
The sets Sn are pairwise disjoint, µ(Sn) = µ(S) for all n and ∞
n=0 Sn is
a bounded set. Therefore if S is measurable, then µ(S) > 0 is impossible.

26. The Real Line
535
(ii) Let S be the set of all constructible reals. First we prove that R −S
is not meager. Let a be a nonconstructible real and let Sa = {x + a : x ∈S};
clearly, S∩Sa = ∅. Thus R = (R−S)∪(R−Sa)∪(S∩Sa) = (R−S)∪(R−Sa),
and if R−S were meager, then R−Sa would also be meager, a contradiction.
It follows that for any nonempty interval I, I −S is not meager: For each
rational r, let Ar = {x + r : x ∈I −S}; if I −S is meager, then each Ar is
meager, and R −S = {Ar : r is rational}.
If S has the Baire property, then because U −S is not meager for any
nonempty open set U, S is meager.
⊓⊔
Example 26.51 (A model where 2ℵ0 > ℵ1 and the set of all con-
structible reals is not Lebesgue measurable). Let λ be a regular un-
countable cardinal and let B be the following measure algebra: Let (S, F, m)
be the product measure space, where S is the product of λ × ω copies
of {0, 1}, F is the least σ-complete ﬁeld of subsets of S containing all
{t ∈S : t(α, n) = 0}, and m is the product measure, and let B be the
measure algebra B = F/sets of measure 0.
Let us consider the generic extension of the constructible universe by the
measure algebra B. The generic extension L[G] satisﬁes 2ℵ0 = λ. We shall
show that in L[G] the set of all constructible reals is not Lebesgue measurable.
In view of Lemma 26.50, it suﬃces to show that the set of all constructible
reals is not null. Thus assume that it is null and let Ik, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , be
an enumeration (in L) of all intervals with rational endpoints. Let µ denote
Lebesgue measure.
Assuming that L[G] ⊨µ(R ∩L) = 0, there is a B-valued name
˙X for
a subset of ω, and a rational ε > 0 such that the Boolean value
(26.33)
∥{Ik : k ∈˙X} contains all constructible reals, and has Lebesgue
measure ≤ε∥
is in G. We may assume, without loss of generality, that the Boolean
value (26.33) is 1.
For each k ∈N, let Ak ∈F be such that ∥k ∈˙X∥= [Ak]. Let us consider
(in L) the product measure space (R, µ)×(S, F, m) with the product measure
ν = µ × m. Let E ⊂R × S be the set
E =
∞

k=0
(Ik × Ak).
We claim that ν(E) ≤ε. It suﬃces to show that ν(
k<k0(Ik × Ak)) ≤ε
for every k0. Let k0 ∈N. By (26.33), for every condition a = [A] there exist
a stronger condition c = [C] and a set Y ⊂k0 such that
c ⊩˙X ∩ˇk0 = ˙Y
and that µ(
k∈Y Ik) ≤ε. Clearly, [C] ≤[Ak] if k ∈Y , and [C] · [Ak] = 0 if
k ∈k0 −Y and hence

Since ν(E) ≤ε, the complement of E has positive measure and hence
there exists, by Fubini’s Theorem, a number x ∈R such that
m({t ∈S : (x, t) /∈E}) > 0.
It follows that there exists A ∈F of positive measure such that
(26.35)
(x, t) /∈E
for all t ∈A.
We shall show that
(26.36)
[A] ⊩x /∈{Ik : k ∈˙X},
completing the proof.
If (26.36) were not true, there would exist some k ∈N and some C ⊂A
of positive measure such that x ∈Ik and [C] ⊩k ∈˙X. But then [C] ≤[Ak]
and hence there is some t ∈C such that (x, t) ∈E, contrary to (26.35).

Example 26.52 (A model where 2ℵ0 > ℵ1 and the set of all con-
structible reals does not have the property of Baire). Let λ be a reg-
ular uncountable ordinal and let P be the notion of forcing that adjoins
λ Cohen reals: A condition is a ﬁnite 0–1 function whose domain is a subset
of λ.
Let us consider the generic extension of the constructible universe by P.
In L[G], 2ℵ0 = λ. We shall show that in L[G] the set of all constructible reals
does not have the Baire property.
In view of Lemma 26.50, it suﬃces to show that the set of all constructible
reals is not meager. For every S ⊂λ (in L), let PS = {p ∈P : dom(p) ⊂S},
and let GS = G ∩PS.
Lemma 26.53. If L[G] ⊨R ∩L is meager, then there exists a countable
S ⊂λ (in L) such that L[GS] ⊨R ∩L is meager.
Proof. Let Ik, k ∈N, be an enumeration of all open intervals with rational
endpoints. If L[G] ⊨R ∩L is meager, then there exists a sequence ⟨Un :
n ∈N⟩∈L[G] such that for every n ∈N, L[G] ⊨Un is dense open,
and that R ∩L ⊂∞
n=0(R −Un). Let A = {(n, k) : Ik ⊂Un}, and let
˙A be a name for A. Since P satisﬁes the countable chain condition, there
is a countable S ⊂λ such that ˙A is PS-valued. It is easy to verify that if
U ′
n = Un ∩L[GS], then for each n ∈N, L[GS] ⊨U ′
n is dense open, and that
R ∩L ⊂∞
n=0(R −U ′
n). Thus L[GS] ⊨R ∩L is meager.
⊓⊔
Since PS is countable, it suﬃces to prove the following lemma:

Lemma 26.54. If P is a countable notion of forcing in L and if G is an
L-generic ﬁlter on P, then L[G] ⊨R ∩L is not meager.
Proof. It suﬃces to show that if ⟨Un : n ∈N⟩is (in L[G]) a sequence of dense
open sets of reals, then there is a constructible real a such that a ∈∞
n=0 Un.
Let ˙Un be a name for Un and let us assume, without less of generality, that
every condition forces that each ˙Un is dense open. It is enough to ﬁnd (in L)
a real number x such that for each n and each p ∈P, there is a q ≤p such
that q ⊩x ∈˙Un.
Let tk, k = 0, 1, . . . , be an enumeration of all pairs t = (n, p) where
n ∈N and p ∈P. Let us construct a sequence I0 ⊃I1 ⊃. . . ⊃Ik ⊃. . . of
closed bounded intervals as follows: Let tk = (n, p). Since p ⊩˙Un is dense
open, there is an open interval J ⊂Ik−1 with rational endpoints such that
some q ≤p forces J ⊂˙Un. Let Ik ⊂J. The intersection ∞
k=0 Ik is nonempty;
and if x is in it, then for each n and each p ∈P there is q ≤p such that
q ⊩x ∈˙Un.

Historical Notes
The model in which all sets of reals are Lebesgue measurable is due to Solo-
vay [1970], as is the concept of random reals, as well as Lemmas 26.1, 26.2, 26.4, 26.5,
the Factor Lemma (Corollary 26.11), 26.16, and Theorem 26.20. Corollary 26.8 is
due to Kripke [1967], and Theorem 26.12 is due to Jensen.
Galvin and Prikry proved in [1973] that every Borel set is Ramsey; this was
extended by Silver in [1970b] to analytic sets, and Ellentuck [1974] gave the proof
of Theorem 26.22 that we reproduce here. Theorem 26.23 is due to Mathias [1977].
Theorem 26.39 is due to Martin and Solovay [1970]. A systematic study of the
properties of measure and category from Deﬁnition 26.43 was started by Miller
in [1981], although the two results in Exercise 26.7 were proved by Rothberger
in [1938]. Similarly, there had been various scattered results on what is now known
as cardinal invariants (such as b, d, etc.) but the ﬁrst comprehensive account ap-
peared in van Douwen’s [1984]. A most recent survey of the results stated here is
Bartoszy´nski’s chapter [∞] in the Handbook of Set Theory. Theorem 26.45(i) is
due to Truss [1977] and Miller [1981]. Theorem 26.46 was proved independently by
Bartoszy´nski [1984] and Raisonnier and Stern [1985]; Pawlikowski’s Theorem 26.47
followed in [1985]. Theorems 26.48 and 26.49 Bartoszy´nski [1987] and [1984].

27. Combinatorial Principles in L
The Fine Structure Theory
In his paper [1972], Ronald Jensen embarked on a detailed analysis of the
levels of the constructible hierarchy. The resulting theory, the ﬁne structure
theory, describes precisely how new sets arise in the construction of L, and has
signiﬁcant applications. Historically, the ﬁrst application of the ﬁne structure
theory was Jensen’s proof of □κ in L, and we shall use that as a motivation
for the introduction of ﬁne-structural concepts. We have already described
another, later, application of Jensen’s theory, the Covering Theorem 18.30.
While Magidor’s proof presented in Chapter 18 does not use the full force of
the ﬁne structure theory, it can serve as a starting point toward the study of
ﬁne structure.
We have seen that the constructible hierarchy is Σ1, in a uniform way,
and we have also seen the role played by the condensation arguments. In
particular we mention Lemma 18.38, the Condensation Lemma, stating that
every Σ1-elementary submodel of Lα is isomorphic to some Lγ, for every
inﬁnite ordinal α.
Every Lα (for α ≥ω) has a Σ1 Skolem function, with a Σ1 deﬁnition
independent of α. Precisely, there is a Σ0 formula Φ such that for every
α ≥ω, the (partial) function hα : ω × Lα →Lα deﬁned by
(27.1)
y = hα(n, x) ↔(Lα, ∈) ⊨∃z Φ(n, x, y, z)
is a Σ1 Skolem function for Lα in the sense that for every X ⊂Lα,
(27.2)
hα“(ω × X) = Hα
1 (X)
is the Σ1 Skolem hull of X in Lα. This can be deduced by using the
Σ1 well-ordering <L, as in (18.5). (For details, we refer the reader to De-
vlin’s book [1984], in particular Lemma II.6.5.)
In Chapter 18 we introduced Σn Skolem functions for n > 1 as well,
but mentioned (following Deﬁnition 18.40) that a Σn Skolem function is not
necessarily a Σn function. In fact, for n > 1 there is no uniform Σ2 Skolem
function (in the sense of (27.1)–(27.2)); for details, see Exercises on pages
106–107 in Devlin’s book [1984], or Proposition 2 in Friedman’s [1997].

546
Part III. Selected Topics
To overcome this obstacle, Jensen introduced an elaborate machinery by
which arguments about Σn predicates on Lα can be reduced to arguments
about Σ1 predicates on a structure (Lρ, A) which in some sense describes the
Σn properties on Lα.
The Principle □κ
We recall (cf. (23.4)) that for an uncountable cardinal κ, a square-sequence is
a sequence ⟨Cα : α ∈Lim(κ+)⟩such that every Cα is closed unbounded in α,
|Cα| < κ whenever cf α < κ, and if ¯α is a limit point of Cα then C¯α = Cα ∩¯α.
In [1972], Jensen proved that in L, every uncountable cardinal κ has a square-
sequence.
Theorem 27.1 (Jensen). If V = L then □κ holds for every uncountable
cardinal κ.
To illustrate how the proof of □κ uses condensation principles, and to
introduce the ﬁne structure theory, we shall now outline the construction
of Cα in the most important special case.
First we observe that it suﬃces to deﬁne the sets Cα for a closed un-
bounded set of α < κ+; a square-sequence is then easily produced. Thus we
consider only the α ∈Lim(κ+) that satisfy
(27.3)
α > κ and Lα ⊨∀γ < α |γ| ≤κ;
these α’s form a closed unbounded set.
As α is a singular limit ordinal, there is a stage of the constructible hi-
erarchy where that is witnessed. Let β = β(α) ≥α be the least β such that
there is a coﬁnal subset of α of smaller order-type that is deﬁnable over Lβ.
Let n = n(α) be the least positive integer such that there exists such a subset
that is Σn over Lβ (with parameters in Lβ).
We outline the construction of Cα for the special case when β is a limit
ordinal and n = 1. (In general one has to consider also successor β’s and
n > 1—this is where the ﬁne structure comes in.)
Using our assumption on α one proves that there exists a function g,
Σ1 over Lβ, that maps κ onto Lβ: Firstly, since there exists a Σ1(Lβ) subset
of α that is not in Lβ (by minimality of β(α)), there exists a Σ1(Lβ) function
that maps α onto Lβ (Exercise 27.1). Then, using (27.3), one gets a Σ1 func-
tion on κ.
Moreover, we can ﬁnd such a function g in a canonical way. Since g exists,
we have Lβ = Hβ
1 (κ ∪p), the Σ1-Skolem hull of κ ∪p in Lβ, where p is some
ﬁnite subset of Lβ, and therefore
(27.4)
Lβ = hβ“(ω × (κ ∪p)),
where hβ is the canonical Σ1 Skolem function from (27.1). Disregarding the
parameter p (which in general is taken to be the <L-least such p), we obtain

27. Combinatorial Principles in L
547
from hβ (uniformly) a Σ1 function gβ mapping κ onto Lβ; using (27.1) we
ﬁnd a Σ0 formula Ψ such that
(27.5)
gβ(ν) = y ↔(∃z ∈Lβ) Ψ(ν, y, z).
Now we construct Cα as an increasing continuous transﬁnite sequence ⟨αξ :
ξ < ϑ⟩of limit ordinals < α with limit α. Simultaneously, we construct
ordinals µξ < β and νξ < κ, with ⟨µξ : ξ < ϑ⟩increasing and continuous, as
follows: Given αξ < α and µξ < β, we let
νξ = least ν such that αξ < gβ(ν) < α and Lgβ(ν) ⊨|αξ| = κ,
(27.6)
µξ+1 = least µ such that αξ, µξ, gβ(νξ) ∈Hµ
1 (κ) and (∃z ∈Lµ)
Ψ(νξ, gβ(νξ), z).
(27.7)
It follows from the assumptions on α that the least ordinal ϑ such that
limξ→ϑ µξ = β(α) is the least ordinal with limξ→ϑ αξ = α, producing the set
Cα = {αξ : ξ < ϑ}, with ϑ ≤κ. The canonical Σ1 deﬁnition (27.5) of gβ
is the key to the coherence property (23.4)(ii) of the Cα’s. Let ¯α < α be
a limit point of Cα, ¯α = αλ where λ is limit. Let ¯µ = µλ, and let L ¯β be the
transitive collapse of H ¯µ
1 (κ). Let e : L ¯β →Lβ be the inverse of the transitive
collapse; e is Σ1-elementary. Using condensation arguments, one proves that
¯α ⊂H ¯µ
1 (κ) (and therefore e↾¯α is the identity), ¯β = β(¯α), e(¯α) = α, and
ﬁnally that the deﬁnition of C¯α = {¯αξ : ξ < λ} agrees with the deﬁnition
of Cα up to λ. In other words, C¯α = Cα ∩¯α.
This completes the outline for the special case. When n(α) = 1 and
β(α) is a successor ordinal, it can be shown that cf α = ω and this case is
suﬃciently exceptional to allow to choose Cα a sequence of order-type ω,
without limit points. When n(α) > 1, the proof requires the machinery of
the ﬁne structure theory: the model (Lβ(α), ∈) is replaced by (Lρ, ∈, A) where
ρ is (n −1)-projectum of β, allowing the use of canonical Σ1-Skolem functions
for models (Lρ, ∈, A).
A complete proof of Theorem 27.1 can be found in Jensen’s paper [1972]
or in Devlin’s book [1984]. There have been several attempts at simpliﬁ-
cation of the proof; among the more recent published proofs we mention
Friedman [1997] and Friedman and Koepke [1997].
⊓⊔
As Jensen pointed out in [1972], his proof of □κ in L shows that if κ+ is
not Mahlo in L then □κ holds. As a consequence the consistency strength
of the failure of Square is at least that of a Mahlo cardinal. By a result of
Solovay (Exercise 27.2), the consistency strength of ¬□ω1 is that of a Mahlo
cardinal.
We also note a result of Solovay from [1974] that the existence of super-
compact cardinals implies the failure of Square (Exercise 27.3).

The Jensen Hierarchy
One of the technical obstacles in the analysis how constructible sets arise in
the hierarchy Lα is that the sets Lα are not closed under the formation of
ordered pairs. This can be overcome by modifying the constructible hierarchy
in an inessential way. The resulting hierarchy Jα has become the preferred
tool for studying the ﬁne structure of L and of more general inner models.
Deﬁnition 27.2 (Rudimentary Functions).
(i) F(x1, . . . , xn) = xi
(i = 1, . . . , n),
F(x1, . . . , xn) = {xi, xj}
(i, j = 1, . . . , n),
F(x1, . . . , xn) = xi −xj
(i, j = 1, . . . , n)
are rudimentary.
(ii) If G is rudimentary, then so is
F(y, x1, . . . , xn−1) = 
z∈y
g(z, x1, . . . , xn−1).
(iii) A composition of rudimentary functions is rudimentary.
The rudimentary closure of a set X is the smallest Y ⊃X closed under all
rudimentary functions. If X is transitive then so is its rudimentary closure,
and for every transitive set M, let
(27.8)
rud(M) = the rudimentary closure of M ∪{M}.
It can be shown that for every transitive set M,
(27.9)
rud(M) ∩P(M) = def(M)
(compare with Corollary 13.8).
Deﬁnition 27.3 (The Jensen Hierarchy).
(i) J0 = ∅, Jα+1 = rud(Jα),
(ii) Jα = 
β<α Jβ if α is a limit ordinal.
Each Jα is transitive, the hierarchy is cumulative, and for each α,
Jα ⊂Vωα
and
Jα ∩Ord = ωα.
From (27.9) it follows that
Jα+1 ∩P(Jα) = def(Jα).
The exact relationship between the Jα’s and the Lα’s is not important, but
we have
(27.10)
Jα = Lα for all α such that α = ωα.

27. Combinatorial Principles in L
549
Every Jα is closed under {x, y},  x, x×y, and if A is a Σ0 subset of Jα then
A ∩x ∈Jα for every x ∈Jα. This has the eﬀect that
⟨Jξ : ξ < α⟩
is uniformly Σ1 over Jα, and there is a well-ordering <J of L such that
its restriction to Jα is (uniformly) Σ1 over Jα. Also, there is a (uniform)
Σ1 function over Jα that maps ωα onto Jα. Similarly as for the Lα, every Jα
has a canonical Σ1 Skolem function hα (analogous to (27.1) and (27.2)).
The ﬁne structure theory capitalizes on the fact that the existence of
a uniform Σ1 Skolem function relativizes to models (Jα, A) where A is a one-
place predicate as long as
(27.11)
A ∩u ∈Jα for all u ∈Jα;
such models (Jα, A) are called amenable. There is a Σ0 formula Φ of the
language (∈, A) such that for every α and every amenable model (Jα, A), the
(partial) function hα,A : ω × Jα →Jα deﬁned by
(27.12)
y = hα,A(n, x) ↔(Jα, ∈, A) ⊨∃z Φ(n, x, y, z)
is a Σ1 Skolem function for (Jα, A).
Projecta, Standard Codes and Standard Parameters
Deﬁnition 27.4. For n > 0, the Σn-projectum ρn
α of α is the smallest ordi-
nal ρ ≤α such that there exists a Σn(Jα) function f such that f“Jρ = Jα;
for n = 0, let ρ0
α = α.
An argument similar to Exercise 27.1 is used to prove that ρn
α is the
smallest ρ such that there exists a Σn(Jα) subset of ωρ not in Jα.
The main feature of the ﬁne structure is that a predicate deﬁnable over Jα
can be reduced to a Σ1 predicate over an amenable structure (Jρ, A) where
ρ is a projectum of α. For each α and each n > 0 there exists a set An
α ⊂Jρn
α
that is Σn over Jα such that (Jρn
α, An
α) is amenable, and such that
(27.13)
Σ1(Jρn
α, An
α) = P(Jρn
α) ∩Σn+1(Jα).
For n = 0, we let A0
α = ∅. The sets An
α are called standard codes.
If P is a Σn+1 predicate over Jα, let f be a Σn(Jα) function that maps Jρn
α
onto Jα. Then f−1(P) is a Σn+1(Jα) subset of Jρn
α and therefore, by (27.13),
Σ1 over the amenable model (Jρn
α, An
α). This reduction is canonical, as both
the standard codes, and the Σn functions f : Jρn
α →Jα are canonical. Pre-
cisely, we deﬁne standard codes along with standard parameters pn
α, by in-
duction on n: p0
α = ∅and
pn+1
α
is the <J-least p ∈Jρn
α such that Jρn
α is the Σ1-Skolem hull of
Jρn+1
α
∪p in Jρn
α;

where ϕk, k ∈ω, is a recursive enumeration of the Σ1 formulas.
Then a Σn(Jα) function from Jρn
α onto Jα can be produced from the
canonical Σ1 Skolem functions and the standard parameters via (27.14).
The fundamental property of standard codes is the following Condensation
Lemma:
Lemma 27.5. Let (Jγ, A) be amenable and let
e : (Jγ, A) →(Jρn
α, An
α)
be a Σ0-elementary embedding. There exists a unique ¯α such that γ = ρn
¯α and
A = An
¯α. The embedding e extends to a unique Σn-elementary embedding
¯e : J¯α →Jα
such that ¯e(pi
¯α) = pi
α for all i = 1, . . ., n. Moreover, if e is Σm-elementary
then ¯e is Σn+m-elementary.

Diamond Principles
Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal and let E be a stationary subset of κ.
♦(E), or (more precisely) ♦κ(E), is the following principle (23.1):
(27.16)
There exists a sequence of sets ⟨Sα : α ∈E⟩with Sα ⊂α such that
for every X ⊂κ, the set {α ∈E : X ∩α = Sα} is a stationary
subset of κ.
When E = κ, ♦κ(κ) is denoted by ♦κ. ♦κ is a generalization of ♦from
Theorem 13.21, and can be proved under V = L by a similar argument
(Exercise 27.4).
Gregory’s Theorem 23.2 shows that under GCH, ♦κ+ holds for every suc-
cessor cardinal κ+, in fact proving ♦(Eκ+
λ ) whenever λ < cf κ. This was
extended by Shelah in [1979] by showing, under GCH, that ♦(Eκ+
λ ) holds
whenever λ ̸= cf κ, and if κ is singular, then GCH and □κ together im-

a weak version of ♦. In [1978], Devlin and Shelah formulate and prove, under
the assumption 2ℵ0 < 2ℵ1 the following statement:
(27.17)
For every F : {0, 1}<ω1 →{0, 1} there exists a g ∈{0, 1}ω1 such
that for every f ∈{0, 1}ω1, the set {α < ω1 : F(f↾α) = g(α)} is
stationary.
(27.17) is a consequence of ♦and fails under MAℵ1.

Trees in L
Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal. Generalizing Deﬁnition 9.12, we have:
Deﬁnition 27.6. A κ+-Suslin tree is a tree of height κ+ such that every
branch and every antichain have cardinality at most κ.
The following result generalizes Theorem 15.26:
Theorem 27.7 (Jensen). If V = L then for every inﬁnite cardinal κ there
exists a κ+-Suslin tree.
When κ is regular, the proof is a straightforward generalization of the
construction of a Suslin tree using ♦: instead we use ♦(Eκ+
κ ). We construct
a tree by induction on levels. At limit levels α of coﬁnality < κ we extend
all branches in Tα; since κ<κ = κ, the αth level has size κ. If cf α = κ then
we use Diamond to destroy potential antichains of size κ+. Note that since
all branches have been extended at lower coﬁnalities, every x ∈Tα has an α-
branch in Tα going through x. The proof that the resulting tree is a κ+-Suslin
tree is exactly as in Theorem 15.26.
When κ is singular, this approach does not work as there are κ+-branches
in Tα when cf α = cf κ. By not extending all of them we cannot guarantee
that at a later stage β, Tβ has β-branches at all. Jensen’s proof succeeds by
involving not only ♦, but the □κ principle as well. The proof shows that if
□κ holds and if ♦κ+(E) for all E, then a κ+-Suslin tree exists. For a proof,
see Devlin [1984], Theorem IV.2.4.
Let us recall (Deﬁnition 9.24) that a tree of height ω1 is a Kurepa tree if
it has countable levels and at least ℵ2 uncountable branches.
Theorem 27.8 (Solovay). If V = L then there exists a Kurepa tree.
Proof. Assume V = L. We shall construct a family of subsets of ω1 that
satisfy (9.12).
For each α < ω1, there is a smallest elementary submodel M of (Lω1, ∈)
such that α ∈M. Moreover (see Exercise 13.17), M = Lγ for some γ < ω1,
and we denote γ by f(α):
(27.18)
f(α) = the least γ such that α ∈Lγ ≺(Lω1, ∈).
Let F be the following family of subsets of ω1:
(27.19)
F = {X ⊂ω1 : X ∩α ∈Lf(α) for every α < ω1}.
It is immediately clear that {X ∩α : X ∈F} is countable for each α < ω1;
and hence if we show that |F| = ℵ2, F will satisfy (9.12).

552
Part III. Selected Topics
Assume that |F| ≤ℵ1. Then F has an enumeration
(27.20)
C = ⟨Xξ : ξ < ω1⟩
and any such enumeration is in Lω2. If we let C be the <L-least such C
in Lω2, then since the function f is a deﬁnable element of Lω2 (by the def-
inition (27.18)) and the Xξ satisfy (27.19) in (Lω2, ∈), it follows that C is
a deﬁnable element of (Lω2, ∈).
Now, we construct an elementary chain of submodels of (Lω2, ∈):
N0 ≺N1 ≺. . . ≺Nν ≺. . . ≺(Lω2, ∈)
(ν < ω1)
as follows: N0 is the smallest elementary submodel of Lω2; Nν+1 is the small-
est N ≺Lω2 such that Nν ⊂N and Nν ∈N; if η is a limit ordinal, then
Nη = 
ν<η Nν. Note that each Nν is countable, and ω1 ∩Nν = αν, for some
αν < ω1 (see Exercise 13.18). Moreover,
(27.21)
⟨αν : ν < ω1⟩
is a continuous increasing sequence of countable ordinals.
Now, we let X = {αν : αν /∈Xν}. Obviously, X ̸= Xξ for all ξ < ω1, and
we shall show that X satisﬁes the condition in (27.19), which will contradict
the assumption that (27.20) is an enumeration of all elements of F.
We want to show that X ∩α ∈Lf(α) for all α < ω1. By induction on α,
if α is not a limit point of the sequence (27.21), then let αν be the largest
αν < α. Then either X ∩α = X ∩αν or X ∩α = (X ∩αν) ∪{αν}; in either
case, since X ∩αν ∈Lf(αν) ⊂Lf(α) (by the induction hypothesis), we have
X ∩α ∈Lf(α). Thus it suﬃces to show that X ∩αη ∈Lf(αη) whenever η is
a limit ordinal.
We shall show that
(i) ⟨αν : ν < η⟩∈Lf(αη);
(ii) ⟨Xξ ∩αη : ξ < αη⟩∈Lf(αη).
(27.22)
Since Lf(αη) is a model of ZF−, the set X ∩αη has the following deﬁnition
in Lf(αη):
X ∩α = {αν : ν < η and αν /∈Xν ∩αη}.
For each ν < ω1, let πν be the transitive collapse of Nν. Each Nν is
isomorphic to some Lδ(ν), and since ω1 ∩Nν = αν, we have πν(ω1) = αν.
Since C is a deﬁnable element of Lω2, we have C ∈Nν for all ν and one can
see that πν(C) = ⟨Xξ ∩αν : ξ < αν⟩.
Note that αη is uncountable in Lδ(η), while it is countable in Lf(αη).
It follows that δ(η) < f(αη), and we have πη(C) ∈Lδ(η) ⊂Lf(αη), which
proves (27.22)(ii).
To prove (27.22)(i), let us construct, inside Lf(αη) (which is a model
of ZF−), an elementary chain N ′
ν, ν < η of submodels of (Lδ(η), ∈): N ′
0 is the

27. Combinatorial Principles in L
553
smallest elementary submodel of Lδ(η); N ′
ν+1 is the smallest N ≺Lδ(η) such
that N ′
ν ∪{N ′
ν} ⊂N, etc. It is not diﬃcult to show, by induction on ν < η,
that for each ν, N ′
ν is isomorphic to Nν. Then the transitive collapse of N ′
ν
is Lδ(ν), and so ⟨Lδ(ν) : ν < η⟩∈Lf(αη). It follows that ⟨αν : ν < η⟩∈Lf(αη),
proving (27.22)(i).
⊓⊔
One consequence of the foregoing proof is that a Kurepa tree exists unless
ℵ2 is inaccessible in L (Exercise 27.5). This is complemented by the following
consistency result:
Theorem 27.9 (Silver [1971c]). If there exists an inaccessible cardinal
then there is a generic extension in which there are no Kurepa trees.
Proof. Let λ be an inaccessible cardinal. Let (P, <) be the L´evy collapse of λ
to ℵ2: forcing conditions are countable functions p on subsets of λ × ω1 such
that p(α, ξ) < α for every (α, ξ) ∈dom(p) and p is stronger than q if p ⊃q.
(P, <) is ℵ0-closed, and so V and V [G] have the same countable sequences
in V . Also, ℵV [G]
1
= ℵ1, and ℵV [G]
2
= λ.
Lemma 27.10. If P is an ℵ0-closed notion of forcing and T is an ω1-tree
in the ground model such that every level of T is countable, then T has no
new branches in V [G].
Proof. Assume that T has a branch b ∈V [G] that is not in V ; since V [G] has
no new countable sets, b has length ω1. There is a name ˙b for b and a condition
p0 ∈G such that p0 ⊩˙b ̸= ˇa for all a ∈V . We construct, by induction,
conditions ps < p0 and nodes xs ∈T for all ﬁnite sequences s of 0’s and 1’s.
Having constructed ps, we can ﬁnd two incomparable nodes xs⌢0 and xs⌢1
both > xs, and two conditions ps⌢0 and ps⌢1, both stronger than ps such
that ps⌢0 ⊩xs⌢0 ∈˙b and ps⌢1 ⊩xs⌢1 ∈˙b. Moreover, we can ﬁnd such xs⌢0
and xs⌢1 at the same level of T . Let α < ω1 be such that all xs lie below
level α in T . For each f : ω →{0, 1}, let pf be a condition stronger than all
pf↾n, n ∈ω. Since p0 ⊩˙b is uncountable, there exist q < pf and xf at the
αth level of T such that q ⊩xf ∈˙b. Now it is clear that xf ̸= xg whenever f
and g are distinct 0–1 functions on ω. Thus the αth level of T has at least 2ℵ0
elements, contrary to our assumption.
⊓⊔
It follows immediately from the lemma that in V [G], no tree T ∈V whose
levels are countable can be a Kurepa tree: Since every branch of T in V [G] is
in V , T has at most (2ℵ1)V branches, but (2ℵ1)V < λ = ℵV [G]
2
, and so T has
(in V [G]) fewer than ℵ2 branches.
A similar argument can be used for any tree in V [G], with a slight modiﬁ-
cation. For each α < λ, let Pα denote the set of all conditions whose domain
is a subset of α × ω1; similarly, let P α = {p ∈P : dom(p) ⊂(κ −α) × ω1}.
Clearly, P is (isomorphic to) the product Pα ×P α. Let X ∈V [G] be a subset
of ω1, and let ˙X be a name of X; since P satisﬁes the λ-chain condition, there
exists for each ξ < ω1 a set of conditions Wξ ⊂P of size less than λ such

554
Part III. Selected Topics
that ∥ξ ∈˙X∥= {p : p ∈Wξ}. There exists an α < λ such that Wξ ⊂Pα,
for all ξ < ω1. It follows that X ∈V [G ∩Pα].
Now let T ∈V [G] be an ω1-tree with countable levels. There exists an
α < λ such that T ∈V [G∩Pα]. By the Product Lemma, G∩P α is P α-generic
over V [G∩Pα] and V [G] = V [G∩Pα][G∩P α]. Since V [G∩Pα] and V have the
same countable sequences in V , it follows that P α is ℵ0-closed not only in V ,
but also V [G ∩Pα] ⊨P α is ℵ0-closed. Thus Lemma 27.10 applies and every
branch of T in V [G] is in V [G∩Pα]. However, (2ℵ1)V [G∩Pα] < λ = ℵV [G]
2
, and
so T is not a Kurepa tree in V [G]. This completes the proof.
⊓⊔
Canonical Functions on ω1
For ordinal functions on ω1, let f < g if {ξ < ω1 : f(ξ) < g(ξ)} contains
a closed unbounded set. The rank of f in < is the Galvin-Hajnal norm ∥f∥;
cf. Deﬁnition 24.4. By induction on α, the αth canonical function fα is deﬁned
(if it exists) as the <-least ordinal function greater than each fβ, β < α. If fα
exists then it is unique up to the equivalence =INS. Lemma 24.5 shows that
for every α < ω2 the αth canonical function exists; see also Exercise 27.6.
It is possible that the constant function ω1 is the ω2nd canonical function
(see Exercise 27.7) but this is known to have large cardinal consequences;
in particular, in L there is a function f : ω1 →ω1 such that ∥f∥= ω2
(Exercise 27.8).
If canonical functions fα exist for all α, then the ideal INS is precipitous
(Exercise 27.10) and hence there is an inner model with a measurable cardi-
nal. Conversely, a combination of the method from Jech and Mitchell [1983]
with the proof of Theorem 23.10 yields the consistency, relative to a measur-
able cardinal, of canonical functions for all α.
The following result shows that in L, the ω2nd canonical function does
not exist.
Theorem 27.11 (Hajnal). If V = L then there is no ω2nd canonical func-
tion on ω1.
Proof. Assume V = L, and assume that there is an ω2nd canonical function.
This statement can be expressed in Lω2:
(∃f : ω1 →ω1) ∀η (fη < f) and
(∀stationary S)(∀g <S f)(∃stationary T ⊂S) ∃η g↾T = fη↾T .
Let γ be the least ordinal such that (Lγ, ∈) is elementarily equivalent to
(Lω2, ∈). Let f be the ω2nd canonical function in (Lγ, ∈) and let δ = ωLγ
1 .
We shall ﬁnd a ξ < δ such that (Lξ, ∈) ≡Lγ, reaching a contradiction.
Consider the generic ultrapower of Lγ by the nonstationary ideal (INS)Lγ
on δ = ωLγ
1
(using functions in Lγ). As f is the ωLγ
2 nd canonical function, the

27. Combinatorial Principles in L
555
ultraproduct 
ξ<δ f(ξ)/G has order-type γ, and moreover, the ultraproduct
UltG = 
ξ<δ Lf(ξ)/G is isomorphic to Lγ. Thus if a sentence σ is true in
(Lγ, ∈) then it is forced to be true in UltG by every stationary S ⊂δ in Lγ,
and so if we let
Tσ = {ξ < δ : Lf(ξ) ⊨σ},
then (since f ∈Lγ) Tσ ∈Lγ and
Lγ ⊨Tσ contains a closed unbounded set.
If {σn : n ∈ω} enumerates all sentences of ZF, then ⟨Tσn : n < ω⟩∈Lγ, and
Lγ ⊨{Tσn : n ∈ω and Tσn contains a closed unbounded set} ̸= ∅.
If ξ is an element of this intersection, then Lf(ξ) ≡Lγ.
⊓⊔
The existence of an ω2nd canonical function is not a large cardinal prop-
erty, as this consistency result shows:
Theorem 27.12 (Jech-Shelah). There is a generic extension of L in which
the ω2nd canonical function exists.
The model is obtained by ﬁrst adding (by forcing with countable condi-
tions) an increasing sequence ⟨fα : α ≤ω2⟩of ordinal functions from ω1
into ω1. Then one uses an iterated forcing, with countable support of
length ω2, that successively destroys all stationary subsets of ω1 that wit-
ness that the sequence ⟨fα : α ≤ω2⟩is not canonical. For details, consult
Jech and Shelah [1989].

Historical Notes
The ﬁne structure theory was introduced by Jensen in [1972]. The paper gives,
among others, proofs of □κ and of the existence of κ+-Suslin trees in L. It also
formulates a combinatorial principle ♦+ that implies the existence of a Kurepa
tree (abstracting Solovay’s proof given here). Silver’s model with no Kurepa trees
appears in [1971c]. Theorem 27.11 is an unpublished result of Andr´as Hajnal
from 1976; the model in Theorem 27.11 is from Jech and Shelah [1989].

28. More Applications of Forcing
In this chapter we present a selection of forcing constructions related to topics
discussed earlier in the book.
A Nonconstructible ∆1
3 Real
By Shoenﬁeld’s Absoluteness Theorem, every Π1
2 or Σ1
2 real is constructible;
on the other hand 0♯is a ∆1
3 real. We now present a model due to Jensen
that produces a nonconstructible ∆1
3 real by forcing over L.
Theorem 28.1 (Jensen). There is a generic extension L[a] of L such that
a is a ∆1
3 real.
The construction is a combination of perfect set forcing and arguments
using the ♦-principle. Let us consider perfect trees p ⊂Seq({0, 1}), cf. (15.24).
The stem of a perfect tree p is the maximal s ∈Seq({0, 1}) such that for every
t ∈p, either t ⊂s or s ⊂t. If p is a perfect tree and if s ∈p, we denote by p↾s
the perfect tree {t ∈p : t ⊂s or t ⊃s}.
Assume that P is a set of perfect trees, partially ordered by ⊂, such that
if p ∈P and s ∈p, then p↾s ∈P, and let G be an L-generic ﬁlter on P.
Then there is a unique f ∈{0, 1}ω which is a branch in every p ∈G; and
conversely, G = {p ∈P : f is a branch in p}. Therefore L[G] = L[f], and we
call f P-generic over L. Note that f ∈{0, 1}ω is P-generic over L if and only
if for every constructible predense set X ⊂P, f is a branch in some p ∈X.
Similarly, a generic ﬁlter G on P × P corresponds to a unique pair (a, b)
such that for each (p, q) ∈G, a is a branch in p and b is a branch in q. A pair
(a, b) is (P × P)-generic over L if and only if for every constructible predense
set X ⊂P × P, there exists a pair (p, q) ∈X such that a is a branch in p
and b is a branch in q.
In Chapter 15 we used the Fusion Lemma for perfect trees. Let T =
{T (s) : s ∈Seq({0, 1})} be a collection of perfect trees such that for every s,
(i) T (s) is a perfect tree whose stem has length ≥length(s).
(ii) T (s⌢0) ⊂T (s) and T (s⌢1) ⊂T (s).
(iii) T (s⌢0) and T (s⌢1) have incompatible stems.

s∈{0,1}n T (s).
For each fusionable T , p = F(T ) (the fusion of T ) is a perfect tree; and for
each s, if t is the stem of ps = T (s), then p↾t is stronger than both p and ps.
We shall not use the set of all perfect trees as the notion of forcing; rather
we shall construct a set P of perfect trees with the property that if p ∈P and
s ∈p, then p↾s ∈P. We shall construct P such that if a is P-generic over L,
then a is the only P-generic set in L[a], and such that {n ∈N : a(n) = 1} is
(in L[a]) a ∆1
3 subset of N.
We shall construct P as the union of countable sets
P0 ⊂P1 ⊂. . . ⊂Pα ⊂. . .
(α < ω1)
of perfect trees. The construction uses the ♦-principle. There is a ♦-sequence
⟨Sα : α < ω1⟩that is ∆1 over Lω1; let us ﬁx such a sequence. Also, let us ﬁx
a ∆1 over Lω1 function τ that is a one-to-one mapping of Lω1 onto ω1.
We shall now construct the sequence P0 ⊂P1 ⊂. . . ⊂Pα ⊂. . .:

Pα+1 = Pα∪Qα+1 where Qα+1 is a set of perfect trees deﬁned as follows:
Let Pα = {pα
n : n ∈ω}; and let us consider the <L-least such enumeration.
Let Xα and Yα be the following countable collections of subsets of Pα and
and Pα × Pα respectively:
Xα contains:
(i) all Qβ, β ≤α,
(ii) all X ⊂Pα such that τ“X = Sβ for some β ≤α.
(28.4)
Yα contains:
(i) Qβ × Qβ for all β ≤α;
(ii) all Y ⊂Pα × Pα such that τ“Y = Sβ for some β ≤α.
There exists a family {Tn : n ∈ω} of fusionable collections of elements of Pα
such that:
(i) Tn(∅) = pα
n for all n;
(ii) for every X ∈Xα, if X is predense in Pα, then for every n ∈N
and every h ∈N there is k ≥h such that for each s ∈{0, 1}k,
there exists an x ∈X such that Tn(s) ≤x;
(iii) for every Y ∈Yα, if Y is predense in Pα × Pα, then for every n,
every m, and every h there is a k ≥h such that for each s ∈
{0, 1}k and each t ∈{0, 1}k; if either n ̸= m or s ̸= t, then there
exists (x, y) ∈Y such that (Tn(s), Tm(t)) ≤(x, y).

28. More Applications of Forcing

A family {Tn : n ∈ω} with properties (28.5)(i)–(iii) is easily constructed
because Xα and Yα are countable. We denote {T α
n : n ∈ω} the <L-least such
family, and let

We let P = 
α<ω1 Pα. The following sequence of lemmas will show that
if a ∈{0, 1}ω is P-generic over L, then in L[a] the set {n : a(n) = 1} is ∆1

Lemma 28.2. For each α, Qα+1 is dense in Pα+1, and Qα+1 × Qα+1 is
dense in Pα+1 × Pα+1.
Proof. It suﬃces to show that below each p ∈Pα there is some q ∈Qα+1. If
p ∈Pα, the p = pα
n for some n, and F(Tn) ⊂Tn(∅) = p.
⊓⊔
Lemma 28.3. For each α, if X ∈Xα is predense in Pα, then X is predense
in Pα+1; if Y ∈Yα is predense in Pα×Pα, then Y is predense in Pα+1×Pα+1.
Consequently, if X ∈Xα is predense in Pα (if Y ∈Yα is predense in Pα×Pα),
then X is predense in P (Y is predense in P × P).
Proof. Let X ∈Xα be predense in Pα; we have to show that for each p↾n ∈
Qα+1 there is a stronger q ∈Qα+1 such that q ≤x for some x ∈X. Let
p = F(Tn) and let u ∈p. Let h = length(u). There is k ≥h such that n
and k satisfy (28.5)(ii). There is s ∈{0, 1}k such that u ∈Tn(s); let v be the
stem of Tn(s). Then p↾v ≤Tn(s) and Tn(s) ≤x for some x ∈X.
A similar argument, using (28.5)(iii), shows that if Y ∈Yα is predense in
Pα × Pα, then Y is predense in Pα+1 × Pα+1.
Since the sequences Xα, α < ω1, and Yα, α < ω1, are increasing, it
follows by induction that X is predense in every Pβ, β < ω1, and hence in P.
Similarly for Y .
⊓⊔
Lemma 28.4. P × P satisﬁes the countable chain condition (and hence
P also satisﬁes the countable chain condition).
Proof. Here we use ♦. Let us assume that Y ⊂P × P is a maximal in-
compatible set of conditions in P × P and that Y is uncountable. Since
each Pα is countable, it is easy to see that the set of all α < ω1 such that
τ(Y ∩(Pα × Pα)) = τ(Y ) ∩ω1 is closed unbounded (τ is the one-to-one func-
tion of Lω1 onto ω1). Then it is not much more diﬃcult to see that the set of
all α < ω1 such that Y ∩(Pα×Pα) is a maximal antichain in Pα×Pα, is closed
unbounded (compare this argument with the ♦-construction of a Suslin tree
in L).
By ♦, there exists an α such that Y ′ = Y ∩(Pα × Pα) is predense in
Pα × Pα and that τ(Y ′) = Sα. Therefore Y ′ ∈Yα and by Lemma 28.3, Y ′ is
predense in P × P. It follows that Y ′ = Y . Thus Y is countable.

Lemma 28.5.
(i) If a ∈{0, 1}ω, then a is P-generic over L if and only if for every
α < ω1 there is some n ∈N such that a is a branch in F(T α
n ).
(ii) If a ̸= b ∈{0, 1}ω, then (a, b) is (P × P)-generic over L if and only
if for every α < ω1 there exist n, m ∈N such that a is a branch
in F(T α
n ) and b is a branch in F(T α
m).
Proof. (i) Let a be P-generic and let α < ω1. Since Qα+1 is dense in Pα+1
and because Qα+1 ∈Xα+1, Qα+1 is predense in P. By the genericity of a,
there exists a q ∈Qα+1 such that a is a branch in q. But q = p↾s where
p = F(T α
n ) for some n and s ∈p, and clearly a is a branch in p.
Conversely, let us assume that the condition is satisﬁed. Let X ⊂P be
a maximal antichain; we wish to show that a is a branch in some x ∈X. By
Lemma 28.4, X is countable, and there is an α such that X ∈Xα. Let n ∈N
be such that a is a branch in F(T α
n ).
By (28.5)(ii), there is k ∈N such that each Tn(s), s ∈{0, 1}k, is stronger
than some x ∈X. Since a is a branch in F(Tn), it is clear that there is
a unique s ∈{0, 1}k such that a is a branch in Tn(s). But if x ∈X is such
that Tn(s) ⊂x, then a is also a branch in x.
(ii) The proof that the condition is necessary is analogous to (i). Thus let
us assume that the condition is satisﬁed and let Y ⊂P × P be a maximal
antichain; we want to ﬁnd (x, y) ∈Y such that a is a branch in x and b is
a branch in y. Again, there is α such that Y ∈Yα. Let n and m ∈N be such
that a is a branch in F(T α
n ) and that b is in F(T α
m).
Let h ∈N be such that a↾h ̸= b↾h; by (28.5)(iii), there is some k ∈N such
that for each s, t ∈{0, 1}k, if either n ̸= m or s ̸= t, then (Tn(s), Tm(t)) ≤
(x, y) for some (x, y) ∈Y . There is a unique pair s, t such that a is a branch
in x and b is a branch in y where (x, y) is some element of Y such that
(Tn(s), Tm(t)) ≤(x, y).

Corollary 28.6. If a and b are P-generic over L and a ̸= b, then (a, b) is
(P × P)-generic over L.
⊓⊔
Corollary 28.7. If a is P-generic over L, then L[a] ⊨a is the only P-generic
over L.
Proof. If a ̸= b and if both a and b are P-generic over L, then by the Product
Lemma, b is a P-generic over L[a] and hence b /∈L[a].
⊓⊔
Lemma 28.8. The set H = {a : a is P-generic over L} is Π1 over HC.
Proof. It follows from the construction of P that the function α →⟨T α
n :
n ∈ω⟩is ∆1 over LωL
1 . Since LωL
1 is a Σ1 set over HC, the function is ∆1
over HC. By Lemma 28.5,
a ∈H ↔(∀α < ωL
1 )(∃n ∈ω) a is a branch in F(T α
n )
and hence H is Π1 over HC.

Corollary 28.9. If a is a P-generic over L and A = {n ∈N : a(n) = 1},

Proof. We have in L[a]
n ∈A ↔(∃a ∈N)(a ∈H and a(n) = 1) ↔(∀a ∈N)(a ∈H →a(n) = 1).
Since H is Π1 over HC, it is a Π1

Namba Forcing
By Jensen’s Covering Theorem if λ is a regular cardinal in L and V is a generic
extension of L, then either cf λ = |λ| or λ < ℵ2. In other words, the only
nontrivial change of coﬁnality is to make |λ| = ℵ1 and cf λ = ω. The following
model, due to Namba, does exactly that:
Theorem 28.10 (Namba). Assume CH. There is a generic extension V [G]
such that ℵV [G]
1
= ℵ1 and cfV [G](ωV
2 ) = ω.
Proof. Let S be the set of all ﬁnite sequences of ordinals less than ω2, S =
ω<ω
2
. A tree is a set T ⊂S such that if t ∈T and s = t↾n for some n, then
s ∈T . A nonempty tree T ⊂S is perfect if every t ∈T has ℵ2 extensions
s ⊃t in T . (Note that then every t ∈T has ℵ2 incompatible extensions in T .)
In analogy with perfect sets in the Baire space, we have a Cantor-Bendixson
analysis of trees T ⊂S: Let
T ′ = {t ∈T : t has ℵ2 extensions in T}
and let T0 = T , Tα+1 = T ′
α, Tα = 
β<α Tβ if α is limit. Let θ < ω3 be the
least θ such that T ′
θ = Tθ. Then Tθ is either empty or perfect.
If T has no perfect ¯T ⊂T , then the above procedure leads to Tθ = ∅, and
we can associate with each t ∈T an ordinal number
(28.7)
hT (t) = the least α such that t /∈Tα+1.
If s ⊂t, then hT (s) ≥hT (t), and for every t ∈T ,
(28.8)
|{s ∈T : t ⊂s and hT (s) = hT (t)}| < ℵ2.
Now let us describe the notion of forcing.
Let P be the set of all perfect trees T ⊂S, partially ordered by inclusion.
We shall show that in the generic extension, ω2 has coﬁnality ω and ω1 is
preserved.
If G is a generic set of conditions, we deﬁne in V [G] a function f : ω →ωV
2
as follows:
f(n) = α ↔∀T ∈G ∃s ∈T such that s(n) = α.
An easy argument using genericity of G shows that f(n) is uniquely deﬁned
for each n and that the function f maps ω coﬁnally into ωV
2 .

Part III. Selected Topics
We shall prove now that ω1 is preserved in the extension by showing
that every f : ω →{0, 1} in V [G] is in the ground model. Thus let T be
a condition, and let ˙f be a name such that
T ⊩˙f is a function from ω into {0, 1}.
We shall ﬁnd a stronger condition that decides each ˙f(n); that is, we shall
ﬁnd a function g : ω →{0, 1} such that some condition stronger than T
forces ˙f(n) = g(n), for all n.
We proceed as follows. By induction on length of s, we construct, for each
s ∈S, conditions Ts and numbers αs ∈{0, 1} such that:
(i) if s1 ⊂s2, then Ts1 ⊃Ts2,
(ii) if length(s) = n, then Ts ⊩˙f(n) = αs,
(iii) for every n, the conditions Ts, s ∈ωn
2 , are mutually incompat-
ible, and moreover, there are mutually incompatible sequences
ts ∈S, s ∈ωn
2 , such that for each s ∈ωn
2 , ts ∈Ts and for all
t ∈Ts, either t ⊂ts or ts ⊂t.
(28.9)
The “moreover” clause in (iii) is stronger than incompatibility of the condi-
tions and implies that any condition stronger than 
s∈ωn
2 Ts is compatible
with some Ts, s ∈ωn
2 .
The construction of conditions satisfying (28.9) is straightforward: We
let t∅= ∅and T∅⊂T be any condition that decides ˙f(0): T∅⊩˙f(0) =
α∅. Having deﬁned Ts, ts, and αs for s ∈ωn
2 we ﬁrst pick ℵ2 incompatible
extensions ts⌢i, i < ω2, of ts in Ts, and then ﬁnd Ts⌢i ⊂Ts and αs⌢i, i < ω2,
such that Ts⌢i ⊩˙f(n + 1) = αs⌢i and that each t ∈Ts⌢i is compatible
with ts⌢i. Note that if s1 ⊂s2, then ts1 ⊂ts2.
For any function g : ω →{0, 1}, we deﬁne a tree T (g) ⊂S (not necessarily
a perfect tree) as follows: If ¯β = ⟨β0, . . . , βn⟩is a ﬁnite sequence of zeros and
ones, we let
(28.10)
T (¯β) = {Ts : s ∈ωn
2 and ⟨β0, . . . , βn⟩= ⟨α∅, . . . , αs↾k, . . . , αs⟩}
and
(28.11)
T (g) =
∞

n=1
T (g↾n).
Each T (¯β) is a condition (a perfect tree) and by the remark following (28.9),
we have
T (¯β) ⊩˙f(k) = βk
(k = 0, . . . , n).
Thus if we show that there is at least one g : ω →{0, 1} such that the
tree T (g) contains a perfect subtree, our proof will be complete.
Lemma 28.11. There exists some g : ω →{0, 1} such that T (g) contains
a perfect subtree.

28. More Applications of Forcing
563
Proof. Let us assume that no T (g) has a perfect subtree. Then by (28.8)
there exists, for each g : ω →{0, 1}, a function hg : T (g) →ω3 such that
hg(s) ≥hg(t) whenever s ⊂t, and that for each t ∈T (g), there are at most ℵ1
elements s ⊃t in T (g) such that hg(s) = hg(t).
By induction, we construct a sequence s0 ⊂s1 ⊂. . . ⊂sn ⊂. . . such
that for all n, sn ∈ωn
2 . At stage n we consider the node tsn of Tsn. Since
there are only ℵ1 functions g : ω →{0, 1}, there exists an i < ω2 such that
hg(ts ⌢
n i) < hg(tsn) for all g for which hg(ts ⌢
n i) is deﬁned. We let sn+1 = s ⌢
n i.
Given the sequence sn, n = 0, 1, . . . , we consider the function g(n) = αsn,
n < ω. By (28.10) and (28.11), each tsn belongs to T (g), and so hg(tsn) is
deﬁned for all n. However, then the sequence hg(ts0) > hg(ts1) > . . . of
ordinals is descending, a contradiction.

A Cohen Real Adds a Suslin Tree
We proved earlier that Suslin trees exist in L, and that adding generically
a subset of ω1 with countable conditions adds a Suslin tree. It turns out that
adding a Cohen real also adds a Suslin tree. This result is due to Shelah; the
following proof is due to Todorˇcevi´c.
Theorem 28.12 (Shelah). If r is a Cohen real over V then in V [r] there
exists a Suslin tree.
Proof. We start with an alternative construction of an Aronszajn tree, a mod-
iﬁcation of the construction in Theorem 9.16.
Lemma 28.13. There exists an ω1-sequence of functions ⟨eα : α < ω1⟩such
that
(i) eα is a one-to-one function from α into ω, for each α < ω1;
(ii) for all α < β < ω1, eα(ξ) = eβ(ξ) for all but ﬁnitely many
ξ < α.
(28.12)
Proof. Exercise 28.1 (or see Kunen [1980], Theorem II.5.9).
⊓⊔
The set {eα↾β : α, β ∈ω1} ordered by inclusion is a tree. Since every
node at level α is a ﬁnite change of eα, all levels are countable; there are no
uncountable branches and so the tree is an Aronszajn tree (Exercise 28.2).
For any function r : ω →ω, consider the tree
(28.13)
Tr = {r ◦(eα↾β) : α, β ∈ω1};
again, Tr is an ω1-tree whose all levels are countable (but need not be Aron-
szajn in general). We prove Theorem 28.12 by showing that if ⟨eα : α < ω1⟩
is, in V , a sequence that satisﬁes (28.12) and if r is a Cohen real over V , then
in V [G], Tr is a Suslin tree.

564
Part III. Selected Topics
We show that Tr has no uncountable antichains; this, and an easy argu-
ment using genericity of r, also shows that Tr has no uncountable branches.
If Tr has an uncountable antichain then, because every uncountable subset
of ω1 in V [r] has an uncountable subset in V (Exercise 28.3), there exist in V ,
an uncountable set W ⊂ω1 and a function ⟨α(β) : β ∈W⟩such that
(28.14)
{r ◦(eα(β)↾β) : β ∈W}
is an antichain.
For each β ∈W, let tβ = eα(β)↾β, and let p be a Cohen forcing condition;
we shall ﬁnd a stronger condition q and β1, β2 ∈W that forces that ˙r◦tβ1 and
˙r ◦tβ2 are compatible functions; therefore no condition forces that (28.14) is
an antichain in Tr.
Let p = ⟨p(0), . . . , p(n −1)⟩. For each β ∈W, let Xβ be the ﬁnite set
{ξ < β : tβ(ξ) < n}. By the ∆-Lemma (Theorem 9.18) there exist a ﬁnite
set S ⊂ω1 and an uncountable Z ⊂W such that when β1, β2 ∈Z, then
Xβ1 ∩Xβ2 = S and that tβ1↾S = tβ2↾S.
Now let β1 < β2 be two elements of Z. We claim that there exists a con-
dition q ⊃p such that q ◦(tβ2↾β1) = q ◦tβ1 (q obliterates the disagreement).
Such a condition q forces ˙r ◦tβ1 ⊂˙r ◦tβ2.
To construct q, let m be greater than tβi(ξ), i = 1, 2, for each ξ < β1
such that tβ1(ξ) ̸= tβ2(ξ). Let k be such that n ≤k < m. If there exist
ξ, η < β1 such that tβ2(η) = k and tβ1(η) = tβ2(ξ), let l = tβ1(ξ) and let
q(k) = p(l). More generally, let f = t−1
β1 ◦tβ2 and let f i, i < ω, denote the
i-th iterate of f. If there exist ξ, η < β1 such that tβ2(η) = k and η = f i(ξ)
for some i, let l = tβ1(ξ) and let q(k) = p(l). Otherwise, let q(k) = 0. Verify
that q obliterates the disagreement.

Consistency of Borel’s Conjecture
A set X of real numbers has strong measure zero if for every sequence ⟨εn :
n < ω⟩of positive real numbers there is a sequence ⟨In : n < ω⟩of intervals
with length(In) ≤εn such that X ⊂∞
n=0 In.
Borel’s Conjecture. All strong measure zero sets are countable.
Borel’s Conjecture fails under CH—see Exercise 26.18. The following the-
orem shows that it is consistent with ZFC:
Theorem 28.14 (Laver). Assuming GCH there is a generic extension V [G]
in which 2ℵ0 = ℵ2 and Borel’s Conjecture holds.
Laver’s proof uses the countable support iteration (of length ω2) of a forc-
ing notion that adds a Laver real. We shall now describe this forcing. (Subse-
quently, Laver proved that an iteration of Mathias forcing also yields Borel’s
Conjecture).

Deﬁnition 28.15. A tree p ⊂Seq is a Laver tree if it has a stem, i.e.,
a maximal node sp ∈p such that sp ⊂t or t ⊂sp for all t ∈p, and
(28.15)
∀t ∈p if t ⊃sp then the set Sp(t) = {a ∈ω : t⌢a ∈p} is inﬁnite.
Laver forcing has as forcing conditions Laver trees, partially ordered by
inclusion. If G is a generic set of Laver trees, let
(28.16)
f = {sp : p ∈G};
the function f : ω →ω is a Laver real. Since
G = {p : sp ⊂f and ∀n ≥|s| f(n) ∈Sp(f↾n)}
we have V [G] = V [f].
Consider a canonical enumeration of Seq in which s appears before t if
s ⊂t and s⌢a appears before s⌢(a + 1). If p is a Laver tree, then the part
of p above the stem is isomorphic to Seq and we have an enumeration sp
0 = sp,

q ≤n p if q ≤p and sp

(in particular q ≤0 p means that q ≤p and p and q have the same stem).
A fusion sequence is a sequence of Laver trees such that
p0 ≥0 p1 ≥1 p2 ≥2 . . . ≥n . . . .

n=0 is a fusion sequence then p = ∞
n=0 pn is a Laver
tree (the fusion of {pn}∞
n=0), and p ≤n pn for all n.
Proof. Let s0 bet the stem of p0. Then s0 is the stem of p, and the set
Sp(s0) = 
n Spn(s0) is inﬁnite. For every a ∈Sp(s0), the set Sp(s ⌢

If p is a Laver tree and s ∈p, then p↾s is the Laver tree {t ∈p : t ⊂s or

Let pi be the ith n-component of pn. As ¯q ∩pi ≤0 pi and decides ˙X(un),

Lemma 28.19. Let p ⊩ϕ1 ∨. . . ∨ϕk. Then there exists some q ≤0 p such
that
(28.20)
∃i ≤k q ⊩ϕi.
Proof. Assume to the contrary that the lemma fails. Let s be the stem of p;
there are only ﬁnitely many a ∈Sp(s) such that some q ≤0 p↾(s⌢a) satis-
ﬁes (28.20). By removing the part of p above these ﬁnitely many nodes we
obtain p1 ≤0 p. For every s⌢a ∈p1 there are only ﬁnitely many b ∈Sp(s⌢a)
such that ∃q ≤0 p1↾(s⌢a⌢b) with property (28.20). By removing all such b’s
(and the nodes above them) we get p2 ≤1 p1. Continuing in this way we
construct a fusion sequence p ≥0 p1 ≥1 p2 ≥2 . . . and r = ∞
n=0 pn. If t ∈r,
then there is no q ≤0 r↾t with property (28.20). But then no q ≤r forces
∃i ≤k ϕi, a contradiction.

The main idea of Laver’s proof is the following property of the Laver forc-

zero sets.
Lemma 28.20. Let G be a generic set for the Laver forcing. Every set of
reals in the ground model that has strong measure zero in V [G] is countable
in V [G].
We begin by proving two technical lemmas:

28. More Applications of Forcing
567
Lemma 28.21. Let p be a Laver tree with stem s and let ˙x be a name for
a real in [0, 1]. Then there exist a condition q ≤0 p and a real u such that for
every ε > 0,
q↾(s⌢a) ⊩| ˙x −u| < ε
for all but ﬁnitely many a ∈Sq(s).
Proof. Let {tn}n be an enumeration of {s⌢a : a ∈Sp(s)}. For each n we
ﬁnd, by Lemma 28.19, a condition qn ≤0 p↾tn and an interval Jn = [ m
n , m+1
n ]
such that qn ⊩˙x ∈Jn. There is a sequence ⟨kn : n < ω⟩so that the Jkn form
a decreasing sequence converging to a unique real u. Let q = ∞
n=0 qkn.
⊓⊔
Lemma 28.22. Let p be a condition with stem s and let ⟨˙xn : n < ω⟩be
a sequence of names for reals. Then there exist a condition q ≤0 p and a set
of reals {ut : t ∈q, t ⊃s} such that for every ε > 0 and every t ∈q, t ⊃s,
for all but ﬁnitely many a ∈Sq(t),
q↾(t⌢a) ⊩| ˙xk −ut| < ε
where k = length(t) −length(s).
Proof. Using Lemma 28.21 we get p1 ≤0 p and us. For every immediate
successor t of s in p1, we get qt ≤0 p1↾t and ut, and let p2 = 
t qt. By
repeating this argument, we build a fusion sequence p ≥0 p1 ≥1 p2 ≥2 . . .,
and let q = ∞
n=0 pn.
⊓⊔
Proof of Lemma 28.20. Let f be the Laver real, and let
(28.21)
εn = 1/f(n).
We shall show that if X ∈V is uncountable, then for some n, the sequence
⟨εk : k ≥n⟩witness that X does not have strong measure zero.
Thus let X ∈V be a subset of [0, 1] and let p be such that p ⊩X has
strong measure zero. Let s be the stem of p of length n. Let ⟨˙xk : k ≥n⟩
be a sequence of names of reals, and for each k ≥n let ˙Ik be the interval of
length ˙εk centered at ˙xk. Let us assume that p ⊩X ⊂
k≥n ˙Ik. We shall ﬁnd
a stronger condition that forces that X is countable.
Let q ≤0 p and {ut : t ∈q, t ⊃s} be a condition and a countable set of
reals obtained in Lemma 28.22. We will show that q ⊩X ⊂{ut}t.
Let v /∈{ut : t ∈q, t ⊃s}; we shall ﬁnd some r ≤q such that r ⊩v /∈˙Ik,
for all k ≥n. We construct r by induction on the levels of q; at stage k ≥n
we ensure that r ⊩v /∈˙Ik.
We describe the construction for k = n; this can be repeated for all k ≥n.
Let ε = |v −us|/2. For all but ﬁnitely many a ∈Sq(s), q↾(s⌢a) ⊩| ˙xn −us| <
ε. Since q↾(s⌢a) ⊩˙εn = 1/ ˙f(n) = 1/a, we have q↾(s⌢a) ⊩| ˙xn −v| > ˙εn, or
v /∈˙In, for all but ﬁnitely many a. Thus we ensure r ⊩v /∈˙In by removing
ﬁnitely many successors of s.

Laver’s model for the consistency of Borel’s Conjecture is obtained by
iteration with countable support of length ω2. At each stage of the itera-
tion, one adds a Laver real by forcing with Laver trees. If the ground model
satisﬁes GCH, then the iteration preserves cardinals and coﬁnalities, makes
2ℵ0 = ℵ2, and the resulting model satisﬁes Borel’s Conjecture.
We state the relevant properties of Laver’s model without proof:
Firstly, for every countable set X of ordinals in V [G] there is a set Y ∈V ,
countable in V , such that X ⊂Y . This is the analog of Lemma 28.17 (see
Lemma 6(iii) of Laver [1976]) and implies that ℵ1 is preserved by the iteration.
In Chapter 31 we prove a more general result, showing that this property is
preserved by countable support iteration of proper forcing.
Secondly, the iteration satisﬁes the ℵ2-chain condition (Lemma 10(ii) of
Laver [1976]). This can be proved as in Exercise 16.20, or Lemma 23.11,
by ﬁrst showing that for every α < ω2, the Laver iteration of length α has
a dense subset of cardinality ℵ1. Again, this is a general property of countable
support iteration of proper forcing, when at each stage, the βth iterate ˙Qβ
has cardinality ℵ1.
The key property of Laver’s iteration is that there are no uncountable
strong measure zero sets in V [G]. If X is a set of reals of size ℵ1 in V [G],
then because of the ℵ2-chain condition, X appears at some stage V [Gα],
and by forcing a Laver real, one makes X not to have strong measure zero
in V [Gα+1]. However, one has to show that X fails to have strong mea-
sure zero in V [G], not just in V [Gα+1]. The main technical lemma (Laver’s
Lemma 15) proves that, and is analogous to Lemma 28.20, working with
iteration of Laver forcing rather than with Laver trees only.
In his paper [1983] Baumgartner gives the consistency proof of Borel’s
Conjecture using the countable support iteration of Mathias forcing. His
Theorem 7.1 shows that the iteration of either Laver or Mathias forcing pre-
serves ℵ1, and if CH holds in the ground model then iteration of length ω2
satisﬁes the ℵ2-chain condition. He also gives a detailed proof of Borel’s Con-
jecture in the iteration of Mathias forcing.
κ+-Aronszajn Trees
Theorem 9.16 states that there exists an Aronszajn tree, i.e., a tree of
length ω1 with countable levels and no branch of length ω1. In Chapter 9 we
also deﬁned what it means for an inﬁnite cardinal κ to have the tree property:
Every tree of height κ and levels of size < κ has a branch of length κ. When
κ is inaccessible then the tree property is equivalent to weak compactness.
Let κ+ be a successor cardinal. A tree of height κ+ is a κ+-Aronszajn
tree if its levels have size at most κ and it has no branch of length κ+. When
κ is singular, the tree property of κ+ is related to large cardinals; we shall

now address the case when κ is regular. We discuss the case of ℵ2 as it easily
generalizes to any successor of a regular. The construction in Theorem 9.16
generalizes to ℵ2 under the assumption that 2ℵ0 = ℵ1 (see Exercises 28.5
and 28.6). It follows that an ℵ2-Aronszajn tree exists unless there is a weakly
compact cardinal in L:
Theorem 28.23 (Silver). If there exists no ℵ2-Aronszajn tree then ℵ2 is
a weakly compact cardinal in L.
Proof. If ℵ2 is a successor cardinal in L, then there exists some A ⊂ω1 such
that ℵL[A]
1
= ℵ1 and ℵL[A]

= ℵ2. In L[A], 2ℵ0 = ℵ1 holds and therefore there
exists a special ℵ2-Aronszajn tree T . But then T is a special ℵ2-Aronszajn
tree in V . Thus if there are no ℵ2-Aronszajn trees, ℵ2 is inaccessible in L.
To show that λ = ℵ2 is weakly compact in L if λ has the tree property,
let B ∈L be (in L) a λ-complete algebra of subsets of λ and |B| = λ. We
shall ﬁnd a λ-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter U on B with U ∈L. (Then,
by the argument in Lemma 10.18, it follows that λ is weakly compact in L.)
Let α < (λ+)L be a limit ordinal such that B ∈Lα and Lα ⊨|B| = λ.
Let {Xξ : ξ < λ} be an enumeration, in L, of P(λ) ∩Lα, and let T be the set
of all constructible functions f ∈{0, 1}<λ such that
{Xξ : f(ξ) = 1} ∩{λ −Xξ : f(ξ) = 0}
 = λ.
Since λ is inaccessible in L, T is a λ-tree with levels of size < λ.
Since λ has the tree property, T has a branch of length λ, a function
F : λ →{0, 1} such that F↾ν ∈T for all ν < λ. If we let D = {Xξ : F(ξ) = 1}
then D is (in V ) a λ-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on P(λ) ∩Lα. Let
Ult = UltD Lα be the ultrapower of Lα by D (using functions in Lα), let Lβ
be its transitive collapse and let j : Lα →Lβ be the corresponding elementary
embedding.
If e ∈Lα is an enumeration of B, e : λ →B, then E = j(e) ∈Lβ and
U = {e(ξ) : λ ∈E(ξ)} is a constructible λ-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter
on B.
⊓⊔
The following theorem shows that it is consistent (relative to a weakly
compact cardinal) that there exist no ℵ2-Aronszajn trees.
Theorem 28.24 (Mitchell). If κ is a weakly compact cardinal then there
is a generic extension in which κ = ℵ2, 2ℵ0 = ℵ2, and there exists no ℵ2-
Aronszajn tree.
The model is obtained by a two-stage iteration P ∗˙Q. The forcing P = Pκ
adds κ Cohen reals to the ground model; let G = Gκ be generic on P; for each
α < κ, let Pα be the forcing for adding α Cohen reals, and let Gα = G ∩Pα.
In V [G], consider the forcing conditions q for adding κ Cohen subsets
of ω1: q is a 0–1 function on a countable subset of κ. Let Q be the set of all

570
Part III. Selected Topics
such q that satisfy, in addition, the requirement that
q↾α ∈V [Gα]
(all α < κ).
This amounts to forcing with pairs (p, q) where p ∈P and q is a countable
function on a subset of κ with values q(α) ∈B(Pα) (then if G is generic on P,
we have ¯q ∈Q where ¯q(α) = 1 if q(α) ∈G and ¯q(α) = 0 if q(α) /∈G).
We list some properties of P ∗˙Q which are not diﬃcult to verify. Let G
be generic on P and let H be V [G]-generic on Q.
First, every countable set of ordinals in V [G][H] is in V [G]. Hence ℵ1 is
preserved.
Second, every cardinal between ℵ1 and κ is collapsed: If ℵ1 ≤δ < κ, let
t be the following function on ω1:
t(α) = {n ∈ω : ∃f ∈H f(δ + ω · α + n) = 1}.
The function maps ω1 onto P(ω)V [Gδ+ω1] which has cardinality δ.
Third, P ∗˙Q satisﬁes the κ-chain condition. This is proved similarly to
the κ-chain condition of the L´evy collapse.
Finally, it is clear that 2ℵ0 = κ in V [G][H]. The main technical lemma
(Lemma 3.8 of Mitchell [1972/73]) asserts the following: For α < κ let Qα =
{q ∈Q : dom(q) ⊂α}, and Hα = H ∩Qα. If γ < κ is a regular uncountable
cardinal and if t ∈V [G][H] is an ordinal function on γ such that t↾α ∈
V [Gγ][Hγ] for all α < γ, then t ∈V [Gγ][Hγ].
Now one shows that κ has the tree property in V [G][H] as follows: Let
B = B(P ∗˙Q) and let ˙T be a B-name for a binary relation on κ that is
in V [G][H] a tree of height κ with levels of size < κ. There is a closed
unbounded set C ⊂κ such that if γ ∈C is an inaccessible cardinal then
Bγ = B(Pγ ∗˙Qγ) is a complete Boolean subalgebra of B(P ∗˙Q) and that
˙T ∩(γ × γ) is a Bγ-valued name for ˙T↾γ, the ﬁrst γ levels of ˙T.
To show that ˙T has a branch of length κ, assume that it has none; that this
is so in V B is a Π1
1 sentence true in (κ, B, ˙T) and since κ is Π1
1-indescribable,
the same is true in V Bγ: ˙T↾γ has no branch of length γ in V Bγ. But any
node in the γth level of T produces an ordinal function on γ whose initial
segments are in V Bγ; by the technical lemma alluded to above, the function
itself is in V Bγ, and is a branch in ˙T↾γ. A contradiction.
⊓⊔
A related result is the following theorem that we state without proof:
Theorem 28.25 (Laver-Shelah). If there exists a weakly compact cardinal
then there exists a generic extension in which 2ℵ0 = ℵ1 and there exists no
ℵ2-Suslin tree.
⊓⊔
(In the Laver-Shelah model, 2ℵ1 is greater than ℵ2.)

[1970]. Namba’s forcing appeared in Namba [1971]; in [1976] Bukovsk´y obtains the
same result by a somewhat diﬀerent forcing construction. The result that adding
a Cohen real adds a Suslin tree is due to Shelah [1984]; the present proof is due to
Todorˇcevi´c [1987] (for details see Bagaria [1994]).
The consistency of Borel’s Conjecture is due to Laver [1976].
For the construction of a κ+-Aronszajn tree if 2<κ = κ, see Specker [1949]. The
consistency proof of the tree property for ℵ2, as well as the proof of Silver’s Theo-

29. More Combinatorial Set Theory
Ramsey Theory
Ramsey’s Theorem 9.1 has been generalized in many ways, giving rise to an
area of combinatorial mathematics known as Ramsey theory. In this section
we present three results involving combinatorics of inﬁnite sets. For a com-
plete account of Ramsey theory we refer the reader to the book [1980] of
Graham, Rothschild and Spencer.
Theorem 29.1 (Hindman). If N is partitioned into ﬁnitely many pieces
then one of the pieces A contains an inﬁnite set H such that a1+. . .+an ∈A
whenever a1, . . ., an are distinct members of H.
For the proof, we introduce the concept of an idempotent ultraﬁlter. If U
and V are ultraﬁlters on N, let
(29.1)
U + V = {X ⊂N : {m ∈N : X −m ∈V } ∈U}
where X−m = {n : m+n ∈X}. See Exercises 29.1 and 29.2 for an alternative
characterization. In the proof we use the following lemma due to S. Glazer:
Lemma 29.2. There exists a nonprincipal ultraﬁlter U on N such that U +
U = U.
An ultraﬁlter U such that U + U = U is idempotent. While Glazer’s
Lemma can be proved directly, it can be deduced from a more general result
on topological semigroups. Let βN be the space of all ultraﬁlters on N, the
Stone-ˇCech compactiﬁcation on N. The operation U + V on βN is a contin-
uous function of U for any ﬁxed V , thus making (βN, +) a left-topological
semigroup. It can be shown that every compact left-topological semigroup
has an idempotent element (Exercises 29.3 and 29.4).
Proof of Theorem 29.1. Given a partition of N into ﬁnitely many pieces, let
U be an idempotent ultraﬁlter, and let A be a piece of the partition such
that A ∈U. We construct a sequence A = A0 ⊃A1 ⊃A2 ⊃. . . with
Ak ∈U and a0 < a1 < a2 < . . . as follows: Let a0 ∈A0. Given Ak ∈U and
ak−1, we ﬁnd ak > ak−1 such that ak ∈Ak and that Ak −ak ∈U (since
{n : Ak −n ∈U} ∈U). Let Ak+1 = Ak ∩(Ak −ak).

Now let H = {ak : k < ω}. To verify that all ﬁnite sums from H are in A,
one shows, by induction on n, that if k1 > . . . > kn then ak1 +. . .+akn ∈Akn.
⊓⊔
A similar technique can be used to give a proof of the following classical
theorem in Ramsey Theory. An arithmetic progression (of length k) is a ﬁnite
set of the form
(29.2)
{n, n + d, n + 2d, . . . , n + (k −1)d}
where d is a positive integer.
Theorem 29.3 (van der Waerden). If N is partitioned into ﬁnitely many
pieces then one of the pieces contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.
For the proof of Theorem 29.3, we ﬁx an integer k ≥1 and consider the
space (βN)k. Let I be the set of all arithmetic progressions of length k, and
let ¯I be its closure in (βN)k. Arguments similar to those in Exercise 29.3
can be used to show that if R ⊂βN is any minimal right ideal and U ∈R,
then ⟨U, . . . , U⟩∈¯I. For details, we refer reader to Todorˇcevi´c’s book [1997].
Now to prove the theorem, let U be a nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on N that
belongs to some minimal right ideal on βN. Let A be the piece of the given
partition such that A ∈U, and let A∗= {V ∈βN : A ∈V }. If k ≥1 is
any integer, let I and ¯I be as above. Since ⟨U, . . . , U⟩∈¯I, it follows that
(A∗× . . . × A∗) ∩¯I is nonempty, and hence I ∩(A × . . . × A) ̸= ∅. Therefore
A contains an arithmetic progression of length k.
The third result, which we state without a proof, is the Hales-Jewett
Theorem. Let Σ be a ﬁnite set, called alphabet, and let W be the set of
all words on Σ, the set of all ﬁnite sequences in Σ. Let v be a variable, an
object not in Σ. The set V of all variable words over Σ is the set of all words
on Σ ∪{v} in which v occurs. An instance of a variable word x ∈V is the
result of substituting some a ∈Σ for v in x.
Theorem 29.4 (Hales-Jewett). If W is partitioned into ﬁnitely many
pieces then there is a variable word x ∈V whose all instances lie in the
same piece of the partition.
We refer the reader to Todorˇcevi´c’s book for a proof using topological
semigroups.
Gaps in ωω
Consider the partial order on ωω by eventual domination: f < g if and only
if f(n) < g(n) for all but ﬁnitely many n.

29. More Combinatorial Set Theory
575
Deﬁnition 29.5. Let κ and λ be regular cardinals. A (κ, λ)-gap in ωω is
a pair of transﬁnite sequences ⟨fα : α < κ⟩and ⟨gβ : β < λ⟩in ωω such that
(i) fα1 < fα2 if α1 < α2,
(ii) gβ1 > gβ2 if β1 < β2,
(iii) fα < gβ for all α < κ and β < λ,
(iv) there is no h between {fα}α and {gβ}β, i.e., no h such that
fα < h < gβ for all α and β.
(29.3)
We shall prove a classical theorem of Hausdorﬀstating that (ω1, ω1)-gaps
exist.
First we prove that (ω, ω)-gaps do not exist:
Lemma 29.6. If f0 < f1 < . . . < fn < . . . < gm < . . . < g1 < g0, then there
exists an h between {fn}n and {gm}m.
Proof. For each k there exists an nk such that for all n ≥nk, mk(n) =
max{f0(n), . . . , fk(n)} ≤min{g0(n), . . . , gk(n)} = Mk(n). Choose such nk’s
so that n0 < n1 < . . . < nk < . . ., and let h be a function such that mk(n) ≤
h(n) ≤Mk(n) when nk ≤n < nk+1.
⊓⊔
Another easily seen fact is that a (κ, λ)-gap exists if and only if a (λ, κ)-gap
exists (Exercise 29.5). That some gaps exists follows from Zorn’s Lemma. In
fact, there exists an (ω, b)-gap, see Exercise 29.6 (and there are no (ω, λ)-gaps
for λ < b, see Exercise 29.7).
Apart from Hausdorﬀ’s Theorem 29.7, the existence of speciﬁc (κ, λ)-gaps
is unprovable: For instance, (c, c)-gaps may or may not exist, depending on
the model. A detailed account of known consistency results on gaps can be
found in Scheepers [1993].
Theorem 29.7 (Hausdorﬀ). There exists an (ω1, ω1)-gap in ωω.
Proof. We construct an increasing ⟨fα : α < ω1⟩and a decreasing ⟨gβ : β <
ω1⟩such that
(i) for all α and β, limn→∞gβ(n) −fα(n) = ∞,
(ii) for every α < ω1 and every n ∈ω, there are only ﬁnitely many
β < α such that ∀k ≥n fα(k) < gβ(k).
(29.4)
Let us show ﬁrst that (29.4) guarantees that {fα}α, {gβ}β is a gap. As-
sume that h ∈ωω is between {fα}α, {gβ}β. Then there exist an uncountable
Z ⊂ω1 and some n ∈ω such that for all k ≥n and h(k) < gα(k) for
all k ≥n. Thus fα(k) < gβ(k) for all α, β ∈Z and all k ≥n. Now if α is
the ωth element of Z, the set {β < α : ∀k ≥n fα(k) < gβ(k)} is inﬁnite,
contradicting (29.4)(ii).
We construct fα and gα by induction on α. Let f0(n) = 0 and g0(n) = n
for all n. Let γ < ω1. If fα and gβ satisfy (29.4) for all α, β ≤γ, then it is
easy to ﬁnd fγ+1 and gγ+1 such that (29.4) remains true.

576
Part III. Selected Topics
Thus let γ be a limit ordinal and assume that {fα}α<γ {gβ}β<γ sat-
isfy (29.4). Let us use the following terminology: If f < gβ for all β < γ and
if C ⊂γ, we say that f is near C if for every n the set {β ∈C : ∀n ≥k
f(k) < gβ(k)} is ﬁnite. Note that if f < f ′ and f is near C then f ′ is near C.
We wish to ﬁnd f and g such that fα < f < g < gβ for all α, β < γ
(and limn(g(n) −f(n)) = ∞) and that f is near γ. Let h be some function
such that fα < h < gβ for all α, β < γ; such an h exists by Lemma 29.6. As
each fα is near α, it follows that h is near α for all α < γ. It now suﬃces to
ﬁnd some f > h such that f < gβ for all β < γ and such that f is near α.
Then g is easily found. For each n let Cn = {β < γ : ∀k ≥n h(k) < gβ(k)}.
Clearly, C0 ⊂C1 ⊂. . . ⊂Cn ⊂. . .. As long as all Cn are ﬁnite, h is near γ
and we are done. Thus assume that the Cα are eventually inﬁnite.
We construct inductively a sequence h = h0 < h1 < . . . < hn < . . . of
functions below {gβ}β<γ such that for each n, hn+1 is near Cn. Then if f is
any function between {hn}n<ω and {gβ}β<γ and f(n) ≥h(n) for all n, then
for each n, f is near the set {β < γ : ∀k ≥n f(k) < gβ(k)} ⊂Cn and hence
f is near γ.
Let n ≥0. If Cn is ﬁnite, any hn+1 is near Cn; thus assume that Cn is
inﬁnite. Since for each α < γ, the set Cn ∩α is ﬁnite (because h is near α),
the order-type of Cn is ω, and Cn is coﬁnal in γ. Let β0 < β1 < . . . < βi < . . .
be the enumeration of Cn. It suﬃces to ﬁnd hn+1 > hn such that hn+1 < gβi
for all i, and that for every m,
(29.5)
{i < ω : ∀k ≥m hn+1(k) < gβi(k)} is ﬁnite.
Let m0 < m1 < . . . < mi < . . . be such that for every i,
hn(k) < gβi(k) < gβi−1(k) < . . . < gβ0(k) for all k ≥mi.
Then the function hn+1 deﬁned by
hn+1(k) =
hn(k)
if k < m0,
gβi(k)
if mi ≤k < mi+1
satisﬁes (29.5) and hence is near Cn.
⊓⊔
The Open Coloring Axiom
We shall now discuss the axiom OCA (Open Coloring Axiom) that has a num-
ber of applications in combinatorial set theory. Let X be a set of reals (or
X ⊂N, or X ⊂P(ω), etc.) and let K ⊂[X]2. We say that K is open if
the set {(x, y) : {x, y} ∈K} is an open set in the space X × X. The Open
Coloring Axiom (OCA) states:
(29.6)
Let X be a subset of R. For any partition [X]2 = K0 ∪K1 with
K0 open, either there is an uncountable Y ⊂X such that [Y ]2 ⊂K0,
or there exist sets Hn, n ∈ω, such that X = ∞
n=0 Hn and [Hn]2 ⊂
K1 for all n.

29. More Combinatorial Set Theory
577
The axiom OCA is consistent with ZFC; we discuss this in Chapter 31. It
should be noted that its dual version is false; Exercise 29.9. OCA has a num-
ber of consequences; see Todorˇcevi´c [1989]. (One example is Exercise 29.10.)
The most notable is the following result:
Theorem 29.8 (Todorˇcevi´c). If OCA holds then b = ℵ2.
First we show that under OCA, b > ω1.
Lemma 29.9. Assume OCA. Then every subset of ωω of size ℵ1 is bounded.
Proof. In order to show that every subset X ⊂ωω of size ℵ1 is bounded, it is
clearly enough to show this for every increasing X = {fα}α<ω1 (i.e., fα < fβ
if α < β), and assume that each fα is an increasing function from ω to ω. Let
X = {fα}α be such and let [X]2 = K0 ∪K1 where K0 consists of all {fα, fβ}
with α < β such that fα(k) > fβ(k) for some k.
First assume that X = ∞
n=0 Hn and [Hn]2 ⊂K1 for all n. Then for
some n, Hn is uncountable, and if α < β are such that fα, fβ ∈Hn then
fα(k) ≤fβ(k) for all k, and fα(k) < fβ(k) for some k. Then if we let Sα =
{(m, k) : m ≤fα(k)}, we have an ω1-chain of subsets of ω×ω, a contradiction.
Thus, assuming OCA, there is an uncountable Y ⊂X such that [Y 2] ⊂
K0. We claim that Y is bounded (and it follows that X is bounded). To
prove the claim, assume that Y is not bounded and let {gα : α < ω1} be the
increasing enumeration of Y . For each t ∈ω<ω that is an initial segment of
some g ∈Y , choose αt such that t ⊂gαt. Then let γ > supt αt, and let k0 be
such that for uncountably many β, gγ(k) < gβ(k) for all k ≥k0. Thus there
is an uncountable Z ⊂ω1 −γ such that gγ(k) < gβ(k) for all β ∈Z and all
k ≥k0 and that gβ1↾k0 = gβ2↾k0 whenever β1, β2 ∈Z.
Now let m ≥k0 be the least m such that the set {gβ(m) : β ∈Z} is
inﬁnite (m exists because {gβ}β∈Z is not bounded). There exist some t ∈ωm
and some W ⊂Z such that gβ↾m = t for all all β ∈W and {gβ(m) : β ∈W}
is inﬁnite.
Let α = αt; since α < γ, there exists a k1 ≥m such that gα(k) < gγ(k) for
all k ≥k1. Let β ∈W be such that gβ(m) ≥gα(k1). Since gβ↾m = t = gα↾m,
and since gα and gβ are increasing, we have gα(k) ≤gβ(k) for all k ≤k1. But
for k ≥k1 we have gα(k) ≤gγ(k) < gβ(k); hence gα(k) ≤gβ(k) for all k.
This contradicts the assumption that {gα, gβ} ∈K0. Hence Y is bounded,
and so X is bounded.
⊓⊔
Toward the proof of b ≤ℵ2 we prove the following result on gaps:
Lemma 29.10. Assume OCA. There is no (κ, λ)-gap in ωω such that κ
and λ are regular uncountable, and κ > ω1.
Proof. Let κ ≥λ be regular uncountable with κ > ω1, and assume that
{fα}α<κ, {gβ}β<λ is a gap. In order to deﬁne an open partition, we ﬁrst
modify the gap. For each α < κ there exists an mα such that for λ many β’s,

578
Part III. Selected Topics
fα(k) < gβ(k) for all k ≥mα; for κ many α’s, this mα is the same. Therefore
there is a gap for which mα = 0 for all α < κ, and we assume that the given
gap is such. For each α < κ, let Sα = {β < λ : ∀k fα(k) < gβ(k)}; |Sα| = λ.
Let X = {(fα, gβ) : α < κ and β ∈Sα}, a subspace of N × N. Consider
the partition [X]2 = K0∪K1 where {(fα, gβ), (fγ, gδ)} ∈K0 when for some k,
either fα(k) > gδ(k) or fγ(k) > gβ(k). Because of the additional assumption
on the gap, K0 is open.
First assume that X = ∞
n=0 Hn with [Hn]2 ⊂K1 for each n. Since κ
and λ are uncountable, there exist A ⊂κ of size κ and for each α < κ some
Tα ⊂Sα of size λ such that all (fα, gβ) with α ∈A and β ∈Tα are in the
same Hn. Since [Hn]2 ⊂K1, we have ∀k fα(k) < gδ(k) whenever α, γ ∈A
and δ ∈Tγ. Thus ﬁx γ ∈A and let B = Tγ. A is coﬁnal in κ, B is coﬁnal
in λ, and if α ∈A and β ∈B then ∀k fα(k) < gβ(k). But then the function h
deﬁned by g(k) = minβ∈B gβ(k) is between {fα}α and {gβ}β, a contradiction.
Next assume that there exists an uncountable Y ⊂X such that [Y ]2 ⊂K0.
If (fα, gβ) and (fγ, gδ) are distinct elements of Y , then because β ∈Sα, δ ∈Sγ
and {(fα, gβ), (fγ, gδ)} ∈K0, we have α ̸= γ and δ ̸= β; thus Y is one-to-one.
Therefore there exist increasing ω1-sequences ⟨αν : ν < ω1⟩and ⟨βν : ν < ω1⟩
such that {(fαν, gβν) : ν < ω1} ⊂Y .
Now since κ > ω1, let h = fδ where δ > supν αν. The function h is between
{fαν}ν and {gβν}ν. Now we can ﬁnd an uncountable Z ⊂ω1 and some m
such that for all ν, η ∈Z, fαν(k) < h(k) < gβη(k) for all k ≥m, and fαν↾m =
fαη↾m, gβν↾m = gβη↾m. Since βν ∈Sαν for each ν, it follows that fαν(k) <
gβη(k) for all k, contrary to the assumption that {(fαν, gβν), (fαη, gβη)} ∈K0.
⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 29.8. Assuming b > ω2, we shall construct an (ω2, λ)-gap
with λ regular uncountable. Then OCA and Lemma 29.10 complete the proof.
Let ⟨fα : α < ω2⟩be an increasing sequence of increasing functions. Since
b > ω2, there exists some g0 such that g0 > fα for all α. Let ⟨gβ : β < ϑ⟩be
a maximal decreasing sequence of functions such that gβ > fα for all α. At
successor stages we can let gβ+1(k) = gβ(k) −1 and so ϑ is a limit ordinal.
We complete the proof by showing that cf ϑ > ω.
Thus assume that ϑ = limn βn. Given α < ω2 let mα(0) < mα(1) <
. . . < mα(n) < . . . be such that for all i = 0, . . . , n, fα(k) < gαi(k) for
all k ≥mα(n). Since b > ω2, there exists a function h such that h > mα
for all α. Now if we let g(n) = mini≤n gαi(h(n)), then g > fα for all α and
g < gαn for all n, contrary to the maximality of ϑ.

Almost Disjoint Subsets of ω1
Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal, and let X and Y be unbounded
subsets of κ. The sets X and Y are almost disjoint if |X ∩Y | < κ (cf. Deﬁ-
nition 9.20). Similarly, two functions f and g on κ are almost disjoint if for

29. More Combinatorial Set Theory
579
some γ < κ, f(α) ̸= g(α) for all α > γ (cf. Deﬁnition 9.22). Unlike in the
case κ = ω, it is a nontrivial question how large a set of almost disjoint sets
of functions can be; clearly, the maximal size of an almost disjoint family
of subsets of κ is equal to the maximal size of an almost disjoint family of
functions from κ to κ.
For simplicity, we consider the case κ = ω1. This can be generalized to
any regular uncountable κ.
First, there exists an almost disjoint family of size ℵ2 (Lemma 9.23), and
if 2ℵ0 = ℵ1 then there exists one of size 2ℵ1. We shall prove the following:
Theorem 29.11. If 2ℵ0 < 2ℵ1 and 2ℵ0 < ℵω1 then there exists an almost
disjoint family of 2ℵ1 uncountable subsets of ω1.
Compare this with Theorem 22.16: If I is the ideal of bounded subsets
of ω1, then Theorem 29.11 states that sat(I) = (2ℵ1)+; by Theorem 22.16,
sat(I) ≥2ℵ1. As sat(I) is regular (by Theorem 7.15), the following lemma
implies the theorem:
Lemma 29.12. Assume 2ℵ0 < ℵω1. If κ is a regular cardinal such that 2ℵ0 <
κ ≤2ℵ1, then there exists a family of κ almost disjoint functions from ω1
into ω1.
Proof. Let F be a family of almost disjoint functions on ω1; we call F
a branching family if whenever f, g ∈F and α is such that f(α) = g(α),
then f(ξ) = g(ξ) for all ξ ≤α.
For each X ⊂ω1, let fX = ⟨X ∩α : α < ω1⟩. The family F = {fX :
X ∈P(ω1)} is a branching family of functions on ω1, |F| = 2ℵ1; and for each
α < ω1, the functions in F take values in P(α). Thus there exists a branching
family of 2ℵ1 functions from ω1 into 2ℵ0.
Let κ be a regular cardinal such that 2ℵ0 < κ ≤2ℵ1. We shall show that
for every ℵγ such that ℵ1 < ℵγ ≤2ℵ0, if there is a branching family of κ
functions from ω1 into ωγ, then there is a branching family of κ functions
from ω1 into some ωδ < ωγ. Then the lemma clearly follows.
First let ℵγ = ℵδ+1 where ℵ1 ≤ℵδ, and let F be a branching family of κ
functions from ω1 into ωδ+1. Each f ∈F is bounded below ωδ+1 (because
ωδ+1 > ω1), and because κ is regular and κ > ωδ+1, there exists α < ωδ+1
such that ran(f) ⊂α for κ functions in F. Thus there exists a branching fam-
ily of κ functions from ω1 into α; and since |α| ≤ℵδ, there is also a branching
family of κ functions from ω1 into ωδ.
If ℵγ is a limit cardinal, then cf(ωγ) = ω because ℵγ < ℵω1. Let F be
a branching family of κ functions from ω1 into ωγ. For each f ∈F there exists
an ordinal ηf < ωγ such that f(α) < ηf for uncountably many α’s. Since κ is
a regular cardinal and κ > ℵγ, there exists ℵδ such that ℵ1 ≤ℵδ < ℵγ, and
a family G ⊂F of size κ such that for every f ∈G, f(α) < ωδ for uncountably
many α’s.

For each α < ω1, let Sα = {f(α) : f ∈G}. Since G is a branching family
and G ⊂
α<ω1 Sα, it suﬃces to show that |Sα| ≤ℵδ for all α < ω1. Thus let
α < ω1. We deﬁne a function t : Sα →ω1 × ωδ as follows: For each x ∈Sα,
we ﬁrst pick some f ∈G such that x = f(α). Then there exists some ξ > α
such f(ξ) < ωδ, and we let
t(x) = (ξ, f(ξ)).
We shall now complete the proof by showing that the function t is one-
to-one, and hence |Sα| ≤ℵδ. Let x, y ∈Sα be such t(x) = t(y). Let ξ > α
and f, g ∈G be such that x = f(α), y = g(α), and t(x) = t(y) = (ξ, f(ξ)) =
(ξ, g(ξ)). Since G is a branching family and f(ξ) = g(ξ), we have f(α) = g(α)
and hence x = y.

Functions from ω1 into ω
Consider the set ωω1 of all functions from ω1 into ω, partially ordered by
eventual domination:
(29.7)
f < g
if and only if
∃γ ∀α ≥γ f(α) < g(α).
Let cof(ωω1) be the smallest size of a coﬁnal family F ⊂ωω1, i.e., for every g
there exists some f ∈F such that g < f. It is an open problem whether
cof(ωω1) < 2ℵ1 is possible.
Theorem 29.13.
(i) If cof(ωω1) < 2ℵ1 then 2ℵ0 ≥ℵ3.
(ii) If 2ℵ0 < 2ℵ1 and 2ℵ0 < ℵω1 then cof(ωω1) = 2ℵ1.
The theorem is a consequence of this lemma:
Lemma 29.14. If there exist 2ℵ1 almost disjoint functions from ω1 into ω2
then cof(ωω1) = 2ℵ1.
Then Theorem 29.13 follows: If 2ℵ0 ≤ℵ2 then use Exercise 29.12(ii);
for (ii), use Theorem 29.11.
Toward the proof of Lemma 29.14, let I be an ideal on a set S. We say
that two functions f, g on S are I-disjoint if {x ∈S : f(x) = g(x)} ∈I. If I
and J are ideals on S and T , then I × J is the ideal on S × T
(29.8)
X ∈I × J
if and only if
{x ∈S : {y ∈T : (x, y) ∈X} /∈J} ∈I.
Lemma 29.15. There exists a σ-ideal I on ω1 such that there exist ℵ2 I-
disjoint functions from ω1 into ω.

29. More Combinatorial Set Theory
581
Proof. We ﬁnd such an I on ω1 × ω1: Let I = I0 × I0 where I0 is the σ-
ideal of all countable subsets of ω1 (each X ∈I is included in the union of
ω vertical lines and the set under the graph of a function from ω1 into ω1).
Let {gα : α < ω2} be a family of ℵ2 almost disjoint functions from ω1 into ω1
(cf. Lemma 9.23), and {fβ : β < ω1} a family of ℵ1 almost disjoint functions
from ω1 into ω (Exercise 29.12(i)). For α < ω2, let hα(ξ, η) = fgα(ξ)(η), for all
(ξ, η) ∈ω1 × ω1. It is easy to verify that hα, α < ω2, are I-disjoint functions
from ω1 into ω.
⊓⊔
Lemma 29.16. If there exist 2ℵ1 almost disjoint functions from ω1 into ω2
then there exists a σ-ideal J on ω1 such that there are 2ℵ1 J-disjoint functions
from ω1 into ω.
Proof. We ﬁnd such a J on ω1 × ω1: Let J = I0 × I where I0 is the ideal of
countable sets and I is the ideal given by Lemma 29.15. Let {gα : α < 2ℵ1}
be a family of almost disjoint functions from ω1 into ω2, and {fβ : β < ω2}
a family of I-disjoint functions from ω1 into ω. For α < ω2, let hα(ξ, η) =
fgα(ξ)(η), for all (ξ, η) ∈ω1 × ω1. The functions hα, α < 2ℵ1, are J-disjoint.
⊓⊔
Proof of Lemma 29.14. By Lemma 29.16 there exist a σ-ideal J on ω1 and
a family H = {hα : α < 2ℵ1} of J-disjoint functions from ω1 into ω. Let F
be a coﬁnal family in ωω1 such that |F| < 2ℵ1. There exists an f ∈F that
eventually dominates inﬁnitely many hα; then let A ⊂2ℵ1 be a countable
inﬁnite set such that hα < f for all α ∈A. The set {ξ < ω1 : hα(ξ) = hβ(ξ)
for some distinct α, β ∈A} is the union of countably many sets in J, hence
belongs to J, and hence its complement is uncountable. Thus for uncountably
many ξ < ω1, the set {hα(ξ) : α ∈A} is an inﬁnite subset of ω. This
contradicts the fact that there exists a γ < ω1 such that for all ξ ≥γ,
hα(ξ) < f(ξ) for all α ∈A.

30. Complete Boolean Algebras
Measure Algebras
A complete Boolean algebra B is a measure algebra if it carries a (strictly
positive probabilistic) measure, i.e., a real-valued function m on B that satis-
ﬁes (22.1) (or cf. Deﬁnition 30.2 below). In Chapters 26 and 22 we looked at
two examples of measure algebras: The algebra Bm of (26.1), and the more
general product measure algebra deﬁned in (22.3). We present below a the-
orem that states that this measure algebra is essentially the only measure
algebra that exists.
Throughout this section, we consider measure algebras, and for simplic-
ity assume that all the measure algebras under consideration are atomless.
Note that every measure algebra satisﬁes the countable chain condition, and
consequently, all questions of completeness can be reduced to σ-completeness.
If G is a subset of a measure algebra B, we say that G σ-generates B if
B is the smallest σ-subalgebra containing G. The weight of B is the least size
of G ⊂B that σ-generates B. B is homogeneous if each B↾u (with u ̸= 0)
has the same weight. Note that every measure algebra is the direct sum of ω
many homogeneous measure algebras.
The result that we shall prove in this section is the following:
Theorem 30.1 (Maharam). Every inﬁnite homogeneous measure algebra
is the unique measure algebra of its weight.
If A and B are inﬁnite homogeneous measure algebras of the same weight
and if µ and ν are strictly positive probabilistic measures on A and B, then
there exists an isomorphism f between A and B such that ν(f(a)) = µ(a) for
all a ∈A.
We begin by introducing some terminology and presenting two lemmas
that are standard techniques of measure theory.
Deﬁnition 30.2. Let B be a complete Boolean algebra. A measure on B is
a real-valued function µ on B that satisﬁes
(i) µ(0) = 0,
(ii) µ(a) ≥0 for all a ∈A,

(iii) for all pairwise disjoint an, n = 0, 1, . . . ,
µ(




n=0
(an).
A measure µ is strictly positive if
(iv) µ(a) > 0 for all a ̸= 0,
and probabilistic, if also
(v) µ(1) = 1.
Finally, a function µ that satisﬁes (i) and (iii) is called a signed measure.
Lemma 30.3. If ν is a signed measure on B that satisﬁes c.c.c. then there
exists an a ∈B such that ν(x) ≥0 for all x ≤a and ν(x) ≤0 for all x ≤−a.
Proof. First we claim that when ν(a) > 0 then there exists some b ≤a such
that
(30.1)
ν(b) > 0, and ν(x) ≥0 for all x ≤b.
If (30.1) fails then for every b ≤a, b ̸= 0, there exists an x ≤a, x ̸= 0, with
ν(x) ≤0. Thus let W be a maximal antichain below a such that ν(x) ≤0 for
every x ∈W. Then  W = a and we have ν(a) ≤0, a contradiction.
Now let Z be a maximal antichain such that (30.1) holds for every b ∈Z.
If ν(a) ≤0 for all a ∈B then the lemma holds trivially. Otherwise, Z is
nonempty, and let a =  Z. This a satisﬁes the lemma.
⊓⊔
Lemma 30.4. Let µ and ν be measures on B and let a ∈B be such that
ν(a) > 0. Then there exist a b ≤a, b ̸= 0, and a number ε > 0 such that
ν(x) ≥ε · µ(x) for all x ≤b.
Proof. Let ε > 0 be such that ν(a) > ε·µ(a) and consider the signed measure
ν −εµ on B↾a. By Lemma 30.3 there exists a b ≤a such that (ν −εµ)(x) ≥0
for all x ≤b, and (ν −εµ)(x) ≤0 for all x ≤a −b. Since (ν −εµ)(b) ≥
(ν −εµ)(a) > 0, we have b ̸= 0.
⊓⊔
The next lemma is due to Fremlin:
Lemma 30.5 (Fremlin [1989]). Let A be a measure algebra and let µ be
a strictly positive measure on A. Let B be a complete subalgebra of A and let
ν be a measure on B such that ν(b) ≤µ(b) for all b ∈B. Assume that
(30.2)
A↾a ̸= {a · b : b ∈B} for every a ∈A+.
Then there exists some a ∈A such that
(30.3)
ν(b) = µ(a · b) for all b ∈B.

30. Complete Boolean Algebras
587
Proof. For each a ∈A, let νa denote the measure on B deﬁned by (30.3):
νa(b) = µ(a · b). We ﬁrst prove the following consequence of (30.2): For every
a ∈A+ and every ε > 0 there exists a c ∈(A↾a)+ such that νc(b) ≤ε · νa(b)
for all b ∈B.
It is enough to prove this claim for ε = 1
2, as the general case follows by
a repeated application of the special case.
Thus let a ∈A+. By (30.2) there exists some d < a such that d ̸= a · b for
every b ∈B. Consider the signed measure 1
2νa −νd on B. By Lemma 30.3
there exists some b ∈B such that νd(x) ≤
1
2νa(x) for all x ∈B↾b and
νd(x) ≥1
2νa(x) for all x ∈B↾(−b).
If b · d > 0, we let c = b · d, and we have νc(x) ≤1
2νa(x) for all x ∈B.
If b · d = 0 then d ≤a −b, and we let c = (a −b) · (a −d). Since d ̸= a −b
(by (30.2)), we have c ̸= 0. For all x ∈B, νc(x) ≤νa(x) −νd(x) ≤1
2νa(x).
This proves the claim for ε = 1
2 and the general case follows. To prove the
lemma, let a ∈A be a maximal (in the partial order ≤on A) element such
that νa(b) ≤ν(b) for all b ∈B. We ﬁnish the proof by showing that νa = ν.
By contradiction, assume that there exists some b1 ∈B such that νa(b1) <
ν(b1). By Lemma 30.4 there exist some b2 ≤b1, b2 ̸= 0, and ε > 0 such that
(ν −νa)(x) ≥εµ(x) for all x ∈B↾b2. Note that b2 ≰a, since otherwise we
would have νa(b2) = µ(b2) ≥ν(b2).
Now we apply the earlier claim to b2 −a, and get some c ≤b2 −a, c ̸= 0,
such that νc(x) ≤ενb2−a(x) ≤ν(x) −νa(x) for all x ∈B. Since c · a = 0, we
have νa+c = νa + νc ≤ν, contradicting the maximality of a.
⊓⊔
Lemma 30.5 allows one to extend partial measure-preserving isomor-
phisms between homogeneous measure algebras. If µ and ν are probabilistic
measures on measure algebras A and B, then an isomorphism f of A onto B
is measure-preserving if ν(f(a)) = µ(a) for all a ∈A.
Lemma 30.6. Let A1 and A2 be homogeneous measure algebras, both of the
same weight κ, and let µ1 and µ2 be probabilistic measures on A1 and A2.
Let B1 and B2 be complete subalgebras of A1 and A2, let f be a measure-
preserving isomorphism of B1 onto B2, and assume that B1 is σ-generated
by fewer than κ generators. Then for every a1 ∈A1 there exist an a2 ∈A2
and a measure-preserving isomorphism g ⊃f of ⟨B1 ∪{a1}⟩, the subalgebra
generated by B1 ∪{a1}, onto ⟨B2 ∪{a2}⟩.
Proof. First we note that since every A1↾a has weight κ, the subalgebra B1
satisﬁes (30.2); similarly for A2 and B2. Let a1 ∈A1; if we let ν(f(b)) =
µ1(a1 · b) for every b ∈B1, then ν is a measure on B2 with ν ≤µ2. By
Lemma 30.5 there exists some a2 ∈A2 such that ν(f(b)) = µ2(a2 · f(b)) for
every b ∈B1.
The algebra ⟨B1∪{a1}⟩consists of all elements of the form b·a1+c·(−a1)
where b, c ∈B1. Thus we let
(30.4)
g(b · a1 + (c −a1)) = f(b) · a2 + (f(c) −a2).

588
Part III. Selected Topics
We have to verify that g is well-deﬁned. If b ∈B1 and b ≤a1 then µ1(b) =
µ1(a1 ·b), and we have µ2(f(b)) = µ1(b) = µ1(a1 ·b) = ν(f(b)) = µ2(a2 ·f(b)),
and so f(b) ≤a2. It follows that b · a1 = b′ · a1 implies f(b) · a2 = f(b′) · a2.
Similarly, one proves that if c ∈B1 and c ≤−a1 then f(c) ≤−a2, and
therefore c −a1 = c′ −a1 implies f(c) −a2 = f(c′) −a2. Thus g is well-
deﬁned.
Since µ2(f(b) · a2 + (f(c) −a2)) = µ1(b · a1 + (c −a1)), g is measure-
preserving, and a one-to-one homomorphism of ⟨B1 ∪{a1}⟩onto ⟨B2 ∪{a2}⟩.
⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 30.1. The construction proceeds by induction. Let A and B
be homogeneous measure algebras of weight κ and let µ and ν be probabilis-
tic measures on A and B. Let {aα : α < κ} and {bα : α < κ} be gener-
ators of A and B. Inductively, we construct A0 ⊂A1 ⊂. . . ⊂Aα ⊂. . .
and B0 ⊂B1 ⊂. . . ⊂Bα ⊂. . . and measure-preserving isomorphisms
f0 ⊂f1 ⊂. . . ⊂fα ⊂. . . such that for every α, Aα is a complete subal-
gebra of A of weight < κ and aα ∈Aα, similarly for Bα, and fα(Aα) = Bα.
At successor stages we apply Lemma 30.6 to either ⟨Aα ∪{aα+1}⟩or
⟨Bα ∪{bα+1}⟩. At a limit stage α, we consider the algebras ˜Aα = 
β<α Aβ
and ˜Bα = 
β<α Bβ. These are subalgebras of A and B, not necessarily
complete. However, the completion Aα of ˜Aα can be described as follows:
The elements of Aα are limits of convergent countable sequences in Aα (see
Exercise 30.1). The measure-preserving isomorphism ˜f = 
β<α fβ between
˜Aα and ˜Bα extends to a unique measure-preserving isomorphism between Aα
and the completion Bα of ˜Bα (use Exercise 30.2).

Cohen Algebras
Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal. We consider the notion of forcing Pκ that adds
κ Cohen reals: conditions in Pκ are ﬁnite 0–1 functions with domain ⊂κ. Let
(30.5)
Cκ = B(Pκ)
denote the complete Boolean algebra corresponding to Pκ. Throughout this
section, B denotes the completion of a Boolean algebra B.
Deﬁnition 30.7. A Boolean algebra B is a Cohen algebra if B = Cκ for
some inﬁnite cardinal κ.
In Theorem 30.10 below we give a combinatorial characterization of Cohen
algebras.

The following is easily established:
Lemma 30.9. The following are equivalent:
(i) A ≤reg B.
(ii) Every maximal antichain in A is maximal in B.
(iii) For every b ∈B+ there exists an a ∈A+ such that for every x ∈A+,
if x ≤a then x · b ̸= 0.
⊓⊔
See Exercises 30.3–30.9 for further properties of ≤reg.
If A is a subalgebra of B and b ∈B, then the projection of b to A, prA(b),
is the smallest element a ∈A, if it exists, such that b ≤a. (Similarly, prA(b)
is the greatest a ∈A such that a ≤b.)
The density of a Boolean algebra B is the least size of a dense subset
of B. B has uniform density if for every a ∈B+, B↾a has the same density.
If X is a subset of a Boolean algebra B, we denote
(30.6)
⟨X⟩= the subalgebra generated by X,
and if A is a subalgebra of B and b1, . . . , bn ∈B,
(30.7)
A(b1, . . . , bn) = ⟨A ∪{b1, . . . , bn}⟩.
Theorem 30.10. Let B be an inﬁnite Boolean algebra of uniform density.
B is a Cohen algebra if and only if the set {A ∈[B]ω : A ≤reg B} contains
a closed unbounded set C with the property
(30.8)
if A1, A2 ∈C then ⟨A1 ∪A2⟩∈C.
If B is countable, the condition is trivially satisﬁed as C = {B} is a closed
unbounded subset of [B]ω.
First we prove the forward direction of the theorem: If B is a dense subal-
gebra of Cκ, then B has the property stated in Theorem 30.10. (In particular,
Cκ itself has the property.) Let B be a dense subalgebra of Cκ. For every
S ⊂κ, consider the forcing PS consisting of ﬁnite 0–1 functions with do-
main ⊂S, and let CS = B(PS). Note that CS ≤reg Cκ.
Now let C be the set of all countable subalgebras A of B with the property
that there exists a countable S ⊂κ such that
(30.9)
A is dense in B ∩CS and B ∩CS is dense in CS.
The following lemma will establish the forward direction.
Lemma 30.11. The set C is closed unbounded in [B]ω, satisﬁes (30.8), and
every A ∈C is a regular subalgebra of B.

Proof. Let A ∈C and let S be a countable subset of κ such that (30.9) holds.
Since B ∩CS is dense in CS and CS ≤reg Cκ, we have B ∩CS ≤reg Cκ, and
since B is dense in Cκ, we have B ∩CS ≤reg B. As A is dense in B ∩CS,
it follows that A ≤reg B. To see that C is unbounded, note that there are
arbitrarily large countable sets S such that B ∩CS is dense in CS (because
Cκ has the countable chain condition). Thus for any a ∈B we can ﬁnd
a countable S and a countable algebra A ⊂B such that a ∈A, that A is
dense in B ∩CS and B ∩CS is dense in CS.
To show that C is closed, let {An}∞
n=0 be an increasing chain in C and
let A = ∞
n=0 An; let {Sn}∞
n=0 be witnesses for An ∈C. The sets Sn form
a chain, and if we let S = ∞
n=0 Sn, it follows that A is dense in B ∩CS and
B ∩CS is dense in CS.
Now we verify (30.8); we shall show that if A1 is dense in CS1 and A2 is
dense in CS2 then A = ⟨A1 ∪A2⟩is dense in CS where S = S1 ∪S2. Let
b ∈C+
S ; we shall ﬁnd a1 ∈A1 and a2 ∈A2 such that 0 ̸= a1 · a2 ≤b.
Let p ∈PS be such that p ≤b, and let p1 = p↾S1, p2 = p↾S2. First we
ﬁnd some a1 ∈A+
1 such that a1 ≤p1 and then some q1 ∈PS1 such that
q1 ≤a1. Let q2 = p2↾(S2 −S1) ∪(q1↾S2); we have q2 ∈PS2. Now we ﬁnd
some a2 ∈A+
2 such that a2 ≤q2. It remains to show that a1 · a2 ̸= 0: There
exists some r2 ∈PS2 with r2 ≤a2, and then r2∪(q1↾(S1 −S2)) ∈PS is below
both a1 and a2.
⊓⊔
For the opposite direction, let B be an inﬁnite Boolean algebra of uniform
density κ and let C be a closed unbounded set of countable regular subalge-
bras of B that satisﬁes (30.8). First we note that B satisﬁes the countable
chain condition: See Exercise 30.10. Let
(30.10)
S = {⟨ X⟩: X ⊂C}.
We claim that every A ∈S is a regular subalgebra of B. Let A = ⟨ X⟩and
let W be a maximal antichain in A; we verify that W is maximal in B. As
W is countable, we have W ⊂⟨ Y ⟩for some countable Y ⊂X. Since C is
closed unbounded and satisﬁes (30.8) it follows that A0 = ⟨ Y ⟩∈C and
hence A0 ≤reg B. Since W is a maximal antichain in A0 and A0 ≤reg B, W is
maximal in B.
A set G ⊂B is independent if
±x1 · ±x2 · . . . · ±xn ̸= 0
for all distinct x1, . . . , xn ∈G. If G is independent then ⟨G⟩= FrG is the
unique free algebra over G; note that the completion of FrG is CG. Our goal
is to ﬁnd an independent G ⊂B such that ⟨G⟩is dense in B.
Let A be a subalgebra of a Boolean algebra D. An element u ∈D is
independent over A if a · u ̸= 0 ̸= a −u for all a ∈A+.
Lemma 30.12. Let D be a complete Boolean algebra of uniform density and
let A be a complete subalgebra of D of smaller density. For every v ∈D there
exists some u ∈D independent over A such that v ∈A(u).

⊓⊔
Let {dα : α < κ} be a dense subset of B. If A1 and A2 are subalgebras
of B we say that A1 and A2 are co-dense if for every a1 ∈A+
1 there exists
some a2 ∈A+
2 with a2 ≤a1, and for every a2 ∈A+
2 there exists some a1 ∈A+
1
with a1 ≤a2.
We construct, by induction on α < κ, two continuous chains G0 ⊂G1 ⊂
. . . ⊂Gα ⊂. . . and B0 ⊂B1 ⊂. . . ⊂Bα ⊂. . . such that
(i) Bα ∈S,
(ii) Aα = ⟨Gα⟩and Bα are co-dense,
(iii) dα ∈Bα+1,
(iv) Gα+1 −Gα is countable,
(v) Gα is an independent subset of B.
(30.11)
This will prove that B is a Cohen algebra, because by (iii), 
α Bα is dense
in B, hence 
α Aα is dense in B, and by (v), 
α Aα is the free algebra FrG
(where G = 
α Gα).
At limit stages, we let Bα = 
β<α Bβ and Gα = 
β<α Gβ. To construct
Gα+1 and Bα+1, we proceed as follows: Since Aα is dense in Bα, Aα = Bα is
a complete subalgebra of B. Moreover, if u1, . . . , un ∈B then Aα(u1, . . . , un)
is a complete subalgebra of B.
Since |Aα| < κ, we ﬁnd, by Lemma 30.12, for every b ∈B some u ∈B
independent over Aα such that b ∈Aα(u). More generally, if b, u1, . . . , un ∈
B, then there exists some u independent over Aα(u1, . . . , un) such that b ∈
Aα(u1, . . . , un, u).
Given u ∈B, there exists a countable set {bn}∞
n=0 ⊂B such that
∞
n=0 bn = u. Then there exists some X ∈C such that {bn}n ⊂X and so
⟨Bα∪X⟩is dense in Aα(u). Therefore there exist a countable set {un}∞
n=0 ⊂B
and some Bα+1 ∈S such that dα ∈Bα+1, that Gα+1 = Gα ∪{un}∞
n=0 is
independent and that Aα+1 = ⟨Gα+1⟩and Bα+1 are co-dense.
⊓⊔
The following property is a natural weakening of the characterization of
Cohen algebras in Theorem 30.10:
Deﬁnition 30.13. An inﬁnite Boolean algebra B of uniform density is semi-
Cohen if [B]ω has a closed unbounded set of countable regular subalgebras.
An immediate consequence of the deﬁnition is that if B is semi-Cohen
and |B| ≤ℵ1 then B is a Cohen algebra. This is because [B]ω has a closed
unbounded subset that is a chain, and therefore satisﬁes (30.8).
The important feature of semi-Cohen algebras is that the property is
hereditary:
Theorem 30.14. If B is a semi-Cohen algebra and if A is a regular subal-
gebra of B of uniform density then A is semi-Cohen.

592
Part III. Selected Topics
Proof. [B]ω has a closed unbounded subset of regular subalgebras of B. Since
A ≤reg B, there exists for every b ∈B+ some a ∈A+ such that there is no
x ∈A+ with x ≤a −b. Let F : B+ →A+ be a function that to each b ∈B+
assigns such an a ∈A+. Let C ⊂[B]ω be a closed unbounded set of regular
subalgebras closed under F.
If X ∈C then A∩X ≤reg X because X is closed under F. Every maximal
antichain in A ∩X is maximal in X, hence in B (because X ≤reg B), hence
in A. Therefore A ∩X ≤reg A.
There is a closed unbounded set D ⊂[A]ω such that D ⊂{X∩A : X ∈C};
D witnesses that A is semi-Cohen.
⊓⊔
Corollary 30.15. If B is semi-Cohen and has density ℵ1 then B is a Cohen
algebra.
Proof. B has a dense subalgebra A of size ℵ1. By Theorem 30.14, A is also
semi-Cohen, and hence Cohen. But A = B, and hence B is Cohen.
⊓⊔
Corollary 30.16. Every complete subalgebra of Cκ of uniform density ℵ1
is isomorphic to Cω1.
⊓⊔
The property of being semi-Cohen is also preserved by completion. This
can be proved using the following lemma:
Lemma 30.17. A Boolean algebra B of uniform density is semi-Cohen if
and only if B is Cohen in V P , where P is the collapse of |B| onto ℵ1 with
countable conditions.
Proof. As |B| = ℵ1 in V P , it suﬃces to show that B is semi-Cohen if and
only if it is semi-Cohen in V P .
As P does not add new countable sets, [B]ω remains the same in V P .
By property (iii) of Lemma 30.9, the relation ≤reg is absolute. Let S be the
set of all regular subalgebras of B. If S contains a closed unbounded set C
then C is closed unbounded in V P . Conversely, if S does not contain a closed
unbounded set, then it does not contain one in V P .
⊓⊔
Corollary 30.18. B is semi-Cohen if and only if its completion is semi-
Cohen.
Proof. Let B be semi-Cohen and let A = B. Let P be the ω-closed collapse
of |A| to ℵ1. In V P , A has a dense subalgebra B that is a Cohen algebra,
hence A itself is Cohen. Therefore A is semi-Cohen.
The converse follows from Theorem 30.14.
⊓⊔
Not every semi-Cohen algebra is a Cohen algebra, and Corollary 30.16
does not extend to density ℵ2. Koppelberg and Shelah gave an example of
a complete subalgebra of Cω2 of (uniform density ℵ2) that is not isomorphic

30. Complete Boolean Algebras
593
to Cω2. Another example, due to Zapletal, is the forcing that adds ℵ2 even-
tually diﬀerent reals: Let
P = {z : z is a ﬁnite function with dom(z) ⊂ω2 and ran(z) ⊂ω<ω},
and let z ≤w if z is a coordinate-wise extension of w and for α ̸= β in dom(w),
if n ∈dom(z(α) −w(α)) and n ∈dom(z(β)), then z(α)(n) ̸= z(β)(n).
If B = B(P) then B can be embedded in Cω2 but is not isomorphic
to Cω2. We omit the proof.
Suslin Algebras
Deﬁnition 30.19. A Suslin algebra is a complete atomless Boolean algebra
that is ω-distributive and satisﬁes the countable chain condition.
If T is a normal Suslin tree, and PT is the forcing with T upside down, then
B(PT ) is a Suslin algebra. Conversely, if B is a Suslin algebra of density ℵ1
then B = B(PT ) for some Suslin tree T ; in general, if B is a Suslin algebra
then B has a complete subalgebra BT such that BT = B(PT ) for some Suslin
tree T .
Theorem 30.20. If B is a Suslin algebra then |B| ≤2ℵ1.
Proof. Let κ = 2ℵ1. Assume that there is a Suslin algebra B such that
|B| > κ. We shall reach a contradiction.
Without loss of generality we assume that |B↾u| > κ for all u ∈B+. We
shall construct a κ-sequence
(30.12)
B0 ⊂B1 ⊂. . . ⊂Bα ⊂. . .
(α < κ)
of complete subalgebras of B, each of size ≤κ. If D ⊂B and |D| ≤κ, then
there are κℵ1 = κ D-valued names for relations on ω1; thus for every such D
let ˙RD
γ , γ < κ, be a ﬁxed enumeration of all such names. Let α →(βα, γα)
be the canonical mapping of κ onto κ × κ; we recall βα ≤α for all α.
The sequence (30.12) is constructed as follows: We let B0 = {0, 1}; if
α is a limit ordinal, then Bα is the complete subalgebra of B generated by

ν<α Bν. If |Bν| ≤κ for each ν < α, then |Bα| < κ. At successor steps, we
construct Bα+1 as follows: Let D = Bβα and let ˙R = ˙RD
γα. If
(30.13)
∥(ω1, ˙R) is a Suslin tree∥Bα = 1,
if ˙C ∈V Bα is the Suslin algebra (in V Bα) corresponding to the Suslin tree
and if Bα ∗˙C is (isomorphic to) a complete subalgebra of B, then we let
Bα+1 = Bα ∗˙C. Otherwise, we let Bα+1 = Bα. In either case, if |Bα| ≤κ,
then |Bα+1| ≤κ.

Now let Bκ be the complete subalgebra of B generated by 
α<κ Bα.
Clearly, |Bκ| ≤κ. Let
˙A ∈V Bκ be the complete Boolean algebra B : Bκ
(in V Bκ). Since both B and Bκ satisfy the c.c.c., we have
∥˙A satisﬁes the c.c.c.∥Bκ = 1.
Similarly, since both B and Bκ are ω-distributive, we have
∥˙A is ω-distributive∥Bκ = 1.
We have assumed that |B↾u| > κ for all u ̸= 0, and we also have |Bκ| ≤κ.
Thus
∥| ˙A| > κ∥Bκ = 1
and consequently
∥˙A is not atomic∥Bκ = 1.
Now we work inside V Bκ; There exists a ˙T ⊂
˙A such that ( ˙T, ≥˙A) is
a normal Suslin tree; let ˙BT ⊂
˙A be the Suslin algebra, subalgebra of ˙A,
generated by ˙T. Let ˙R be a binary relation on ω1 isomorphic to ˙T.
The name
˙R is Bκ-valued; and since Bκ satisﬁes the countable chain
condition, ˙R involves at most ℵ1 elements of Bκ. Since cf κ > ℵ1, there exists
a β < κ such that ˙R ∈V Bβ; furthermore, let γ < κ be such that ˙R is the
γth Bβ-valued binary relation on ω1, ˙R = ˙RBβ
γ .
Let α < κ be such that β = βα and γ = γα. Since
∥(ω1, ˙R) is a Suslin tree∥Bκ = 1,
it follows that
∥(ω1, ˙R) is a Suslin tree∥Bα = 1.
If ˙C denotes the corresponding Suslin algebra in V Bα, we have
Bα ∗˙C ⊂Bκ ∗˙BT ⊂Bκ ∗˙A = B
and it follows that Bα+1 = Bα ∗˙C. However, forcing with a Suslin tree
destroys its Suslinity, and we have
∥(ω1, ˙R) is not a Suslin tree∥Bα+1 = 1,
a contradiction.
⊓⊔
Suslin algebras of size 2ℵ1 can be constructed by forcing (cf. Jech [1973b]),
or in L (an unpublished result of Laver).

Simple Algebras
Deﬁnition 30.21. A complete Boolean algebra B is simple if it is atomless
and if it has no proper atomless complete subalgebra.
The problem of existence of simple algebras originated in forcing and
was ﬁrst discussed by McAloon in [1971]. It is clear that a simple algebra is
minimal, i.e., when forcing with it, there is no intermediate model between
the ground model and the generic extension. Minimality, when formulated in
Boolean-algebraic terms, is the following property:
(30.14)
If A is a complete atomless subalgebra of B then there exists a par-
tition W such that A↾w = B↾w for all w ∈W.
(An example of a minimal algebra is B(P) where P is the Sacks forcing.)
Simple algebras, in addition to being minimal, are rigid, i.e., have no
nontrivial automorphisms (Exercise 30.13). It turns out that the conjunction
of these two properties also implies that the algebra is simple (Exercise 30.14).
Thus we have:
Theorem 30.22. An atomless complete Boolean algebra is simple if and
only if it is rigid and minimal.
⊓⊔
An example of a rigid and minimal algebra is BP where P is Jensen’s
forcing from Theorem 28.1 that produces a minimal ∆1
3 real. BP is minimal
because the generic real has minimal degree of constructibility, and rigid
because it is deﬁnable. It follows that if V = L then a simple complete
Boolean algebra exists.
In L, one can also construct Suslin algebras that are simple (see Exercises
30.15 and 30.16 for the construction of a rigid Suslin algebra).
Simple complete Boolean algebras have been constructed in ZFC; we refer
the reader to Jech-Shelah’s papers [1996] and [2001]. The former constructs
a countably generated simple algebra and uses a modiﬁcation of the Sacks
forcing to produce a minimal deﬁnable real. The latter construction is some-
what less complicated and yields forcing that produces a minimal deﬁnable
uncountable set.
Inﬁnite Games on Boolean Algebras
Inﬁnite games have many applications in set theory, particularly in descrip-
tive set theory, and we shall investigate these methods in some detail in the
chapter on Axiom of Determinacy. In the present section we look into some
properties of complete Boolean algebras, and of forcing, that are formulated
in terms of inﬁnite games.

596
Part III. Selected Topics
Let B be a Boolean algebra, and let G be the following inﬁnite game
between two players I and II: I chooses a nonzero element a0 ∈B and then
II chooses some b0 ∈B+ such that b0 ≤a0. Then I plays (chooses) a1 ≤b0
and II plays b1 ≤a1 (both ̸= 0). The game continues, with I’s moves an ∈B+,
n < ω, and II’s moves bn ∈B+, n < ω, such that
(30.15)
a0 ≥b0 ≥a1 ≥b1 ≥. . . ≥an ≥bn ≥. . . .
Player I wins the game if ∞
n=0 an = 0; player II wins otherwise: if the
chain (30.15) has a nonzero lower bound. A strategy for player I is a function
σ : B<ω →B; it is a winning strategy if I wins every play (30.15) in which
I follows σ, i.e., for each n, an = σ(⟨b0, . . . , bn−1⟩). A (winning) strategy for II
is deﬁned similarly. If player I has a winning strategy then II does not, and
vice versa, and in general, neither player need have a winning strategy.
Lemma 30.23. Player I has a winning strategy in G if and only if B is not
ω-distributive.
Proof. Let σ be a winning strategy for I. Let a0 = σ(⟨⟩); we shall ﬁnd parti-
tions Wn of a0 without a common reﬁnement. Let W0 = {a0}. Having con-
structed W0, . . . , Wn, consider all ﬁnite sequences a0 ≥b0 ≥. . . ≥an ≥bn
where the an’s are chosen by σ and ak ∈Wk for all k ≤n. Let Wn be a max-
imal antichain whose members are elements an+1 = σ(⟨b0, . . . , bn⟩) where
a0 ≥b0 ≥. . . ≥an ≥bn is as described. The Wn’s are partitions of a0 and
do not have a common reﬁnement.
Conversely, if B is not ω-distributive, there exist some a0 and open dense
sets Dn below a0 such that ∞
n=0 Dn = ∅. We deﬁne σ(⟨⟩) = a0, and if a0 ≥
b0 ≥. . . ≥an ≥bn is such that the an’s are chosen by σ, let σ(⟨b0, . . . , bn⟩) be
some element of Dn below bn. The function σ is a winning strategy for I.
⊓⊔
Let P be a separative notion of forcing, and consider the inﬁnite game G
in which players I and II take turns to play a descending chain a0 ≥b0 ≥
. . . ≥an ≥bn ≥. . . in P. I wins if and only if the chain does not have a lower
bound. It is easy to see that either player has a winning strategy in this game
if and only if the same player has a winning strategy in G played on B(P)
(Exercise 30.17).
Deﬁnition 30.24. A separative notion of forcing P (a Boolean algebra B)
is strategically ω-closed if player II has a winning strategy in the game G.
Being strategically ω-closed is a hereditary property. If B is strategically
ω-closed and if A is a regular subalgebra of B then also A is strategically
ω-closed (Exercise 30.18).
It is obvious that if P is ω-closed then player II has a winning strategy
in G. Hence if B has a dense ω-closed subset, then B is strategically ω-closed.
The converse is true for small algebras:

30. Complete Boolean Algebras
597
Theorem 30.25 (Foreman). If B has density ℵ1 and is strategically ω-
closed, then it has a dense ω-closed subset.
Proof. Let {dα : α < ω1} be a dense set in B. By induction on α, we ﬁnd
partitions Wα of 1 such that Wβ reﬁnes Wα if α < β, and every Wα has some
w ≤dα; at limit stages, we use ω-distributivity of B. Let T = 
α<ω1 Wα;
T is dense in B and is a tree. Let σ be a winning strategy for II in the game G
on T . We shall ﬁnd a dense subset P of T that is ω-closed.
If t ∈T , we call p = ⟨a0, b0, . . . , an, bn⟩a partial play above t if the bk’s
are played by σ and bn > t. We claim:
(30.16)
(∀t ∈T ) (∃t∗< t) if p is a partial play above t∗and if u > t∗then
there is a partial play q ⊃p above t∗with last move b such that
u > b > t∗.
To prove the claim, we construct t0 > t1 > . . . > tn > . . . such that t0 = t
and that for every n and every partial play p above tn, if u > tn then there
exist some q ⊃p with last move b and some m such that u > b > tm. This is
possible because there are only countably many such p’s and u’s. Therefore
there exists a play ⟨a0, b0, . . . , an, bn, . . .⟩that is played according to σ and
that is coﬁnal in ⟨tn⟩∞
n=0. As σ is a winning strategy, ⟨tn⟩∞
n=0 has a lower
bound, let t∗be a maximal lower bound (it exists because T is a tree). This
proves (30.16). Now let
P = {s ∈T : for some descending chain {tn}∞
n=0, s is a maximal lower bound
of {t∗
n}∞
n=0}.
The set P is ω-closed: Given s0 > s1 > . . . in P, ﬁnd {tn}∞
n=0 such that
t∗
0 > s0 > t∗
1 > . . .. The chain {t∗
n}∞
n=0 has a lower bound (because there
exists a coﬁnal play by σ) and its maximal lower bound is in P.
The set P is dense in T : Given t ∈T , let {tn}∞
n=0 be the chain t, t∗,
t∗∗, . . . . There exists a coﬁnal σ-play, and so {tn}∞
n=0 has a lower bound. The
maximal lower bound is in P.
⊓⊔
As a corollary, we get the following characterization of strategically ω-
closed forcings:
Corollary 30.26. B is strategically ω-closed if and only if B is a regular
subalgebra of some algebra that has an ω-closed dense subset.
Proof. Suﬃciency follows from Exercise 30.18. Thus assume that B is strate-
gically ω-closed and let σ be a winning strategy for II. Let P be the collapse
with countable conditions of |B| to ℵ1. In V P , σ is still a winning strategy, and
by Theorem 30.25, B has an ω-closed dense subset ˙E. Let A = B(P × B+);
B is a regular subalgebra of A. Let D = {(p, b) : p ⊩b ∈˙E}; D is dense
in A. D is ω-closed: Let {(pn, bn)}n be descending and let p = 
n pn. Then
p forces that {bn}n is descending, and there is a b ∈B+ such that p ⊩(b ∈˙E
and b ≤bn for all n). Hence (p, b) is a lower bound of {(pn, bn)}n.

31. Proper Forcing
Deﬁnition and Examples
Proper forcing was introduced by S. Shelah who isolated properness as the
property of forcing that is common to many standard examples of forcing
notions and that is preserved under countable support iteration.
Deﬁnition 31.1. A notion of forcing (P, <) is proper if for every uncount-
able cardinal λ, every stationary subset of [λ]ω remains stationary in the
generic extension.
Properness is a generalization of both the countable chain condition and
of being ω-closed. The following two lemmas are the analogs of Lemma 22.25
and Lemma 23.7 (for κ = ℵ1):
Lemma 31.2. If P satisﬁes the countable chain condition then for every
uncountable λ, every closed unbounded set C ⊂[λ]ω in V [G] has a subset
D ∈V that is closed unbounded in V . Hence every stationary set S ⊂[λ]ω
remains stationary in V [G].
Proof. Let p ⊩
˙C is closed unbounded; let
˙F be a name for a function
from λ<ω into λ such that p ⊩C ˙F ⊂
˙C (where C ˙F is the set of all clo-
sure points of ˙F—see Theorem 8.28). Let f : λ<ω →[λ]ω be the function
f(e) = {α ∈λ : ∥˙F(e) = α∦= 0}.
f(e) is countable because P satisﬁes the countable chain condition. Let
D = Cf.
Since p ⊩˙F(e) ∈f(e), if x is closed under f then p ⊩˙F(e) ∈x, and so
p ⊩D ⊂˙C.
⊓⊔
Lemma 31.3. If P is ω-closed then every stationary set S ⊂[λ]ω remains
stationary in V [G].
Proof. Let p ⊩˙F : λ<ω →λ. We shall ﬁnd a condition q ≤p and some x ∈S
such that q ⊩˙F(x<ω) ⊂x.
Consider the model (Hκ, ∈, (P, <), p, ˙F, ⊩) where κ ≥λ is suﬃciently
large. Let C be the closed unbounded set in [Hλ]ω of all countable elementary

602
Part III. Selected Topics
submodels of the model. By Theorem 8.27 there exists some N ∈C such that
N ∩λ ∈S. Let x = N ∩λ.
Enumerate x<ω = ⟨en : n < ω⟩and construct a sequence of conditions
p = p0 ≥p1 ≥. . . ≥pn ≥. . . such that for each n there exists an αn ∈N ∩λ
such that pn ⊩
˙F(en) = αn (by elementarity). Let q be a lower bound
for {pn}n. Then q ⊩˙F(x<ω) ⊂x.
⊓⊔
Proper forcing does not collapse ℵ1. In fact, an easy argument shows that
a stronger property is true:
Lemma 31.4. If P is proper then every countable set of ordinals in V [G] is
included in a set in V that is countable in V .
Proof. Let X be a countable set of ordinals in V [G] and let λ be uncountable
in V such that X ⊂λ. The set ([λ]ω)V remains stationary in V [G] and
therefore meets the set {A ∈[λ]ω : A ⊃X}, which is a closed unbounded set
in V [G]. Thus X ⊂A for some A ∈([λ]ω)V .
⊓⊔
We shall now formulate a technical condition that is equivalent to proper-
ness of a forcing notion, and that will be used to prove that properness is
preserved under countable support iteration. We refer the reader to the ex-
ercises for other equivalents of properness.
Let (P, <) be a ﬁxed notion of forcing. We say that λ is suﬃciently large
if λ is a cardinal and λ > 2|P |. A model M is an elementary submodel of
(Hλ, ∈, <, . . .) where Hλ is the collection of all sets hereditarily of cardinality
less than λ, < is some unspeciﬁed well-ordering of Hλ (to allow for inductive
constructions), and the structure of Hλ contains all the relevant parameters;
in particular, M contains (P, <).
Deﬁnition 31.5. A condition q is (M, P)-generic if for every maximal an-
tichain A ∈M, the set A ∩M is predense below q.
The following lemma (the proof is a routine exercise) illuminates the con-
cept of (M, P)-genericity:
Lemma 31.6. Let λ be suﬃciently large, let M ≺Hλ be such that P ∈M,
and let q ∈P. The following are equivalent:
(i) q is (M, P)-generic.
(ii) If ˙α ∈M is an ordinal name then q ⊩˙α ∈M, i.e.,
∀r ≤q ∃s ≤r ∃β ∈M s ⊩˙α = β.
(iii) q ⊩˙G ∩M is a ﬁlter on P generic over M.
⊓⊔
Theorem 31.7. A forcing notion P is proper if and only if for all suﬃciently
large λ there is a closed unbounded set C of elementary submodels M ≺
(Hλ, . . .) such that
(31.1)
∀p ∈M ∃q ≤p (q is (M, P)-generic).

31. Proper Forcing
603
Proof. First we show that the condition is necessary. Let P be proper and
let λ be suﬃciently large. Toward a contradiction assume that the set of all
models M ≺Hλ for which (31.1) fails is stationary. By normality there exist
a stationary set S ⊂[Hλ]ω and a condition p ∈P such that for every q ≤p
and every M ∈S, q is not (M, P)-generic.
Now let V [G] be a generic extension with G ∋p, and let us argue in V [G].
Every maximal antichain A below p (in V ) meets G in a unique condition qA.
Let
C = {M ≺(Hλ)V : if A ∈M then qA ∈M};
C is closed unbounded. Since S remains stationary in V [G], there exists some
M ∈S ∩C.
For each A ∈M we have (A ∩M) ∈G (because qA ∈G), and by
genericity, 
A∈M
(A ∩M) ∈G. Let q ≤
A∈M
(A ∩M). Then q ≤p
and q is (M, P)-generic, contradicting M ∈S.
Now we prove that the condition is suﬃcient. Let P be a forcing notion
that satisﬁes the condition of the theorem; we shall prove that P preserves
stationary sets. Let λ be an uncountable cardinal and let S ⊂[λ]ω be sta-
tionary. Let ˙F be a name for a function ˙F : λ<ω →λ and p ∈P. We shall
ﬁnd a q ≤p and x ∈S such that q ⊩x is closed under ˙F.
Let µ ≥λ be suﬃciently large. By the assumption there exists a closed
unbounded set C ⊂[Hµ]ω such that (31.1) holds for every M ∈C. By
Theorem 8.27, {M ∩λ : N ∈C} contains a closed unbounded set in [λ]ω and
hence there exists some M ∈C with M ∩λ ∈S.
Let q ≤p be (M, P)-generic. We ﬁnish the proof by showing that q ⊩
M ∩λ is closed under ˙F. Let e ∈(M ∩λ)<ω; we shall show that q ⊩˙F(e) ∈M.
There is A ∈M such that A is a maximal antichain below p and every w ∈A
decides ˙F(e). Now if r ≤q forces ˙F(e) = α, then because A ∩M is predense
below q, r is compatible with some w ∈A ∩M and so w ⊩˙F(e) = α. Since
α is deﬁnable from w, ˙F, and e, we have α ∈M.
⊓⊔
Another characterization of properness is formulated in terms of inﬁnite
games.
Deﬁnition 31.8. Let P be a forcing notion and let p ∈P. The proper game
(for P, below p) is played as follows: I plays P-names ˙αn for ordinal numbers,
and II plays ordinal numbers βn. Player II wins if there exists a q ≤p such
that
(31.2)
q ⊩∀n ∃k ˙αn = βk.
Theorem 31.9. A forcing notion P is proper if and only if for every p ∈P,
II has a winning strategy for the proper game.
Proof. Exercise 31.3.
⊓⊔
We shall now present some examples of proper forcing. The following
concept is due to J. Baumgartner:

604
Part III. Selected Topics
Deﬁnition 31.10. A notion of forcing (P, <) satisﬁes Axiom A if there is
a collection {≤n}∞
n=0 of partial orderings of P such that p ≤0 q implies p ≤q
and for every n, p ≤n+1 q implies p ≤n q, and
(i) if ⟨pn : n ∈ω⟩is a sequence such that p0 ≥0 p1 ≥1 . . . ≥n−1 pn ≥n . . .
then there is a q such that q ≤n pn for all n;
(ii) for every p ∈P, for every n and for every ordinal name ˙α there exist
a q ≤n p and a countable set B such that q ⊩˙α ∈B.
Lemma 31.11. If P satisﬁes Axiom A then P is proper.
Proof. Let P satisfy Axiom A and let p ∈P. The following is a winning
strategy for II in the game from Exercise 31.2: When I plays ˙αn, let II ﬁnd
a condition pn ≤n−1 pn−1 (with p0 ≤p) and a countable set Bn such that
pn ⊩˙αn ∈Bn. If q is a lower bound for {pn}∞
n=0 then q witnesses that II wins
the game.
⊓⊔
Example 31.12. Every ω-closed forcing satisﬁes Axiom A.
Let p ≤n q if and only if p ≤q, for all n.
⊓⊔
Example 31.13. Every c.c.c. forcing satisﬁes Axiom A.
Let p ≤n q if and only if p = q, for all n > 0.
⊓⊔
Example 31.14. The notions of forcing that add a Sacks real, a Mathias
real or a Laver real satisfy Axiom A.
For Sacks reals, see (15.26). For Laver forcing, see (28.17); Mathias forcing
is similar.
⊓⊔
In Exercises 31.5 and 31.6 we give Baumgartner’s example of proper forc-
ing that does not satisfy Axiom A.
Iteration of Proper Forcing
It is obvious that a two-step iteration of proper forcing is proper: If P pre-
serves stationary sets and in V P , ˙Q preserves stationary sets then P ∗˙Q
preserves stationary sets. What is more important however is that proper-
ness is preserved under countable support iteration. The present section is
devoted to the proof of this.
Theorem 31.15 (Shelah). If Pα is a countable support iteration of { ˙Qβ :
β < α} such that every ˙Qβ is a proper forcing notion in V Pα↾β, then Pα is
proper.
Toward the proof of Theorem 31.15 we ﬁrst observe that the properness
condition in Theorem 31.7 can be somewhat simpliﬁed:

31. Proper Forcing
605
Lemma 31.16. P is proper if and only if for every p ∈P, every suﬃciently
large λ and every countable M ≺(Hλ, ∈, <) containing P and p, there exists
a q ≤p that is (M, P)-generic.
Proof. Let P be proper and p ∈P. Let µ = 2|P | and λ > µ; we recall that < is
a well-ordering of Hλ. By Theorem 31.7 the set of all countable elementary
submodels of Hµ with property (31.1) contains a closed unbounded set, and
so it contains CF for some function F : H<ω
µ
→Hµ. If F is the least such
function in Hλ then every M ≺(Hλ, ∈, <) is closed under F and so M ∩Hµ
satisﬁes (31.1). Hence every such M with P, p ∈M satisﬁes the condition of
the lemma.
⊓⊔
In order to prove that an iteration Pα is proper, we wish to show that if
λ is suﬃciently large and M ≺Hλ contains Pα then for every p ∈Pα ∩M
there is some (M, Pα)-generic q ∈Pα such that q ⊩α p ∈˙G. We prove this
by induction; the main point is that the inductive condition is somewhat
stronger:
Lemma 31.17. Let Pα be a countable support iteration of proper forcing
notions. Let λ be suﬃciently large and let M ≺(Hλ, ∈, <) be countable, with
Pα ∈M. For every γ ∈α∩M, every q0 ∈Pγ = Pα↾γ that is (M, Pγ)-generic,
and every ˙p ∈V Pγ such that
(31.3)
q0 ⊩γ ˙p ∈(Pα ∩M) and ˙p↾γ ∈˙Gγ
there exists an (M, Pα)-generic condition q ∈Pα such that q↾γ = q0 and
q ⊩α ˙p ∈˙Gα.
˙Gα and
˙Gγ are the canonical names for generic ﬁlters on Pα and Pγ
respectively. Letting γ = 0 (and q0 the trivial condition 1 in P0 = {1}), we
get the desired result.
Lemma 31.17 is proved by induction on α. In order to handle the successor
stages we need ﬁrst to prove the special case α = 2, γ = 1; then the inductive
step from α to α + 1 is a routine modiﬁcation of the special case:
Lemma 31.18. Let P be proper, let ˙Q ∈V P be such that ⊩P
˙Q is proper
and let R = P ∗˙Q. Let M ≺Hλ be countable, with R ∈M. For every
(M, P)-generic q0 ∈P and every ˙p ∈V P such that
q0 ⊩P ˙p ∈(M ∩R) and ˙p0 ∈˙GP
(where ˙p is a name for ( ˙p0, ˙p1) and ˙GP is generic on P) there is some ˙q1 ∈V P
such that (q0, ˙q1) is (M, R)-generic and (q0, ˙q1) ⊩R ˙p ∈˙GR.
Proof. To ﬁnd the name ˙q1, let G be a generic ﬁlter on P containing q0. Let
p = ˙pG and q = ˙QG; then p ∈M ∩R and p = (p0, ˙p1) with p0 ∈G. Since
˙p1 ∈M, we have p1 ∈M[G]∩Q, and since Q is proper, there exists (in V [G])

606
Part III. Selected Topics
a stronger condition q1 that is (M[G], Q)-generic. (Here we use the fact that
M[G] ≺HV [G]
λ
which we leave as an exercise.) This describes ˙q1.
That (q0, ˙q1) is (M, R)-generic follows from q0 being (M, P)-generic and
q0 ⊩˙q1 is (M[ ˙GP ], ˙Q)-generic (this is routine). Also, since q0 ⊩˙p0 ∈˙GP and
q0 ⊩˙q1 ≤˙p1, we conclude that (q0, ˙q1) ⊩R ˙p ∈˙GR.
⊓⊔
Proof of Lemma 31.17. We assume that α is a limit ordinal; hence α ∩M
is a countable set of ordinals without a maximal element. Let ⟨γn : n ∈ω⟩
be an increasing set of ordinals in M with γ0 = γ, coﬁnal in α ∩M. Let
{Dn : n ∈ω} be an enumeration of al dense subsets of Pα that are in M. Let
q0 ∈Pγ0 be (M, Pγ0)-generic and let ˙p be a V Pγ0 -name such that (31.3) holds.
We shall ﬁnd a (M, Pα)-generic condition q ∈Pα such that q↾γ0 = q0 and
q ⊩α ˙p ∈˙Gα.
We construct q as the limit of conditions qn ∈Pγn such that qn+1↾γn = qn,
and such that each qn is (M, Pγn)-generic.
Along with the qn we construct Pγn-names ˙pn such that ˙p0 = ˙p and that
for each n, qn forces
(i) ˙pn ∈( ˙Pα ∩M),
(ii) ˙pn ≤˙pn−1,
(iii) ˙pn ∈Dn−1,
(iv) ˙pn↾γn ∈˙Gγn.
(31.4)
Assume that qn and ˙pn have been constructed. To ﬁnd ˙pn+1, let G be a Pγn-
generic ﬁlter such that qn ∈G, and let pn = ˙pG
n . We have pn ∈Pα ∩M
and pn↾γn ∈G. Since qn is (M, Pγn)-generic and Dn ∈M, we can ﬁnd
a condition pn+1 ≤pn in Dn ∩M such that pn+1↾γn ∈G. This describes the
Pγn+1-name ˙pn+1. Now we apply the inductive condition to γn+1 (in place
of α) and γn (in place of γ), for qn and ˙pn+1↾γn+1; we obtain a qn+1 ∈Pγn+1
that forces (31.4) (with n replaced by n + 1).
Now we let q be the limit of the qn. Clearly, q ∈Pα and q↾γ0 = q0. We
complete the proof by showing that for every n, q ⊩α ˙pn ∈˙Gα. This implies
not only that q ⊩α ˙p ∈
˙Gα, but also that q is (M, Pα)-generic, because
q ⊩˙pn ∈(Dn−1 ∩M).
To verify that q ⊩α ˙pn ∈
˙Gα, let G be a generic ﬁlter on Pα and let
pn = ˙pG
n . We have pn ∈M and pn↾γk ∈Gγk ∩M for all k ≥n. Thus if we let
δ = sup(α ∩M), we have pn↾δ ∈Gδ. Since pn ∈M, its support is included
in M and therefore pn↾δ = pn. It follows that pn ∈G.
⊓⊔
A signiﬁcant consequence of Theorem 31.15 is that countable support it-
eration of proper forcing preserves ℵ1. As for cardinals above ℵ1, one often
needs additional assumptions on the iterates ˙Qβ to calculate the chain condi-
tion. The easiest case was already stated in Exercise 16.20: If P is a countable
support iteration of length κ ≥ℵ2 such that each P↾β, β < κ, has a dense
subset of size < κ, then P satisﬁes the κ-chain condition. In particular, iter-
ation of length ω2 with each P↾β having a dense set of size ℵ1, satisﬁes the
ℵ2-chain condition, and all cardinals are preserved.

31. Proper Forcing
607
A somewhat better result is the following which we state without a proof.
For a proof, see Abraham’s paper [∞] in the Handbook of Set Theory. [She-
lah’s book [1998] contains more general chain condition theorems.]
Theorem 31.19. Assume CH. If P is a countable support iteration of length
κ ≤ω2 of proper forcings ˙Qβ of size ℵ1, then P satisﬁes the ℵ2-chain condi-
tion.
⊓⊔
The Proper Forcing Axiom
When we replace the countable chain condition in Martin’s Axiom MAℵ1
by properness we obtain a more powerful statement, the Proper Forcing Ax-
iom (PFA):
Deﬁnition 31.20 (Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA)). If (P, <) is a proper
notion of forcing and if D is a collection of ℵ1 dense subsets of P, then there
exists a D-generic ﬁlter on P.
It turns out that PFA implies that 2ℵ0 = ℵ2, and therefore PFA is a gen-
eralization of Martin’s Axiom MA. Unlike MA, consistency of PFA requires
large cardinals: It follows from the results stated later in this chapter that at
least a Woodin cardinal is necessary. The consistency proof given below uses
a supercompact cardinal.
Theorem 31.21. If there exists a supercompact cardinal then there is a
generic model that satisﬁes PFA.
Proof. The proof follows loosely the proof of the consistency of MA. Let κ
be a supercompact cardinal. The model is obtained by countable support
iteration of length κ. Each notion of forcing used in the iteration is proper
and has size < κ, thus both ℵ1 and all cardinals ≥κ are preserved. Cardinals
between ℵ1 and κ are collapsed and so κ becomes ℵ2, and the model satisﬁes
2ℵ0 = ℵ2.
In order to show that the resulting model satisﬁes PFA, we use a Laver
function (see Theorem 20.21); this makes it possible to handle all potential
proper forcing notions in κ steps.
Let f : κ →Vκ be a Laver function. We construct a countable support
iteration Pκ of { ˙Qα : α < κ} as follows: At stage α, if f(α) is a pair ( ˙P , ˙D)
of Pα-names such that ˙P is a proper forcing notion and D is a γ-sequence
of dense subsets of ˙P for some γ < κ, we let ˙Qα = ˙P; otherwise, ˙Qα is the
trivial forcing.
Let G be a generic ﬁlter on Pκ, the countable support iteration of { ˙Qα :
α < κ}. Since each ˙Qα is proper, Pκ is proper and therefore ℵ1 is preserved.
Each Pα (the iteration of { ˙Qβ : β < α}) has size less than κ (because
f(α) ∈Vα) and so Pκ has the κ-chain condition; hence all cardinals ≥κ
are preserved.

Lemma 31.22. In V [G], if P is proper and D = {Dα : α < γ}, with γ < κ,
is a family of dense subsets of P, then there exists a D-generic ﬁlter on P.
This lemma will complete the proof of the theorem: For every γ < κ,
let P be the forcing that collapses γ onto ω1 with countable conditions, and
for α < γ let Dα = {p ∈P : α ∈ran(p)}. By Lemma 31.22, there exists
a collapsing map of γ onto ω1. Thus κ = ℵ2 in V [G]. Now Lemma 31.22
implies that V [G] satisﬁes PFA. Moreover, 2ℵ0 = ℵ2 in V [G]: On the one
hand, PFA implies MAℵ1 and so 2ℵ0 > ℵ1, and on the other hand, 2ℵ0 ≤κ
because |Pκ| = κ.
Proof of Lemma 31.22. Let ˙P and ˙D be Pκ-names for P and D. Let λ > 22|P |
be suﬃciently large; we may also assume that P ⊂λ. Since f is a Laver
function, there exists an elementary embedding j : V →M with critical
point κ such that j(κ) > λ, M λ ⊂M, and (jf)(κ) = ( ˙P, ˙D).
P is a proper forcing in V [G]. This is witnessed by some closed unbounded
set C ⊂[Hη]ω of countable models for some η with 2|P | < η < λ. Since M λ ⊂
M and Pκ has the κ-chain condition, V [G] satisﬁes that M[G]λ ⊂M[G],
and therefore C is closed unbounded in M[G]. Therefore P is proper in the
model M[G].
Now consider the forcing notion j(Pκ) in M. It is a countable support
iteration of length j(κ) using the Laver function j(f). Since j↾Vκ is the iden-
tity, we have j(Pκ)↾κ = Pκ. As (jf)(κ) = ( ˙P , ˙D) and P is proper in M[G],
it follows that (j ˙Q)κ = ˙P. Hence
j(Pκ) = Pκ ∗˙P ∗˙R
for some ˙R.
Let H ∗K be a V [G]-generic ultraﬁlter on ˙P ∗˙R. In V [G ∗H ∗K] we
extend the elementary embedding j : V →M to an elementary embedding
j∗: V [G] →M[G ∗H ∗K] as follows: For every Pκ-name ˙x, let
j∗( ˙xG) = j( ˙x)G∗H∗K.
The deﬁnition of j∗does not depend on the choice of the name ˙x, since
∥˙x = ˙y∥∈G implies ∥j( ˙x) = j( ˙y)∥∈G ∗H ∗K (because j(p) = p for every
p ∈Pκ). Similarly, ∥ϕ( ˙x)∥∈G implies ∥ϕ(j( ˙x))∥∈G ∗H ∗K, and so j∗is
elementary. Clearly, j∗extends j.
The ﬁlter H on P is V [G]-generic and thus meets every Dα, α < γ. Let
E = {j(p) : p ∈H}. Since j↾λ ∈M, the set E is in M[G ∗H ∗K], and
generates a ﬁlter on j∗(P) that is j∗(D)-generic. Thus
M[G ∗H ∗K] ⊨there exists a j∗(D)-generic ﬁlter on j∗(P)
and since j∗: V [G] →M[G ∗H ∗K] is elementary, there exists in V [G] a D-
generic ﬁlter on P.

Applications of PFA
Our ﬁrst goal is to outline the proof of the following theorem:
Theorem 31.23 (Todorˇcevi´c). PFA implies 2ℵ0 = ℵ2.
As the ﬁrst step we show that the Open Coloring Axiom (29.6) is a con-
sequence of PFA. If [X]2 = K0 ∪K1 with K0 open, let us call Z ⊂X
0-homogeneous if [Z]2 ⊂K0 and 1-homogeneous if [Z]2 ⊂K1. It is clear that
the closure of a 1-homogeneous set is also 1-homogeneous, and so in (29.6)
we can further assume that the sets Hn are closed.
The proof of OCA from PFA uses the following technical lemma that we
state without proof:
Lemma 31.24 (Todorˇcevi´c). Assume 2ℵ0 = ℵ1. Let X ⊂R and [X]2 =
K0 ∪K1 with K0 open, and assume that X is not the union of countably
many closed 1-homogeneous sets. Then there exists an uncountable Y ⊂X
such that in any uncountable set W ⊂{p ∈[Y ]<ω : p is 0-homogeneous}
there exist p ̸= q such that p ∪q is 0-homogeneous.
Proof. See Theorem 4.4 of Todorˇcevi´c [1989]. (To apply the theorem, let F(x)
be the closure of {y ∈X : x < y and {x, y} ∈K1}.)
⊓⊔
Theorem 31.25. PFA implies OCA.
Proof. Let X ⊂R and let [X]2 = K0 ∪K1 with K0 open, and assume that
X is not the union of countably many closed 1-homogeneous sets. We shall
use PFA to ﬁnd an uncountable 0-homogeneous set.
Let P be the forcing (15.2) that adds a subset of ω1 with countable con-
ditions. By Exercise 15.14, V P satisﬁes 2ℵ0 = ℵ1. Since P does not add new
reals, it does not add new closed sets of reals and so in V P , X is not the
union of countably many closed 1-homogeneous sets.
By Lemma 31.24 there exists an uncountable ˙Y ∈V P such that if we let
˙Q = {p ∈[ ˙Y ]<ω : p is 0-homogeneous} (and p is stronger than q if p ⊃q)
then the forcing notion ˙Q satisﬁes the countable chain condition. Hence P ∗˙Q
is proper.
Let ⟨yα : α < ω1⟩be an enumeration of ˙Y in V P . For each α < ω1,
the set Dα = {(p, q) ∈P × ˙Q : p ⊩yα ∈q} is a dense set in P ∗˙Q. Let
D = {Dα : α < ω1}. By PFA there exists a D-generic ﬁlter G on P ∗˙Q, and
then the set Y = {q : (p, q) ∈G} is an uncountable 0-homogeneous set.
⊓⊔
Theorem 31.25 appears in Todorˇcevi´c [1989]. Its proof does not require
the full force of PFA. What we used is a weaker statement that is obtained
by replacing “proper notion of forcing” in Deﬁnition 31.20 by “Axiom A
forcing of cardinality ≤2ℵ0.” This axiom is weaker than PFA (and stronger
than MAℵ1) and is consistent relative to ZFC+“there exists a weakly compact
cardinal” (see Baumgartner [1984]).

Part III. Selected Topics
The consistency of related partition axioms was ﬁrst established in Abra-
ham, Rubin and Shelah [1985].
By Theorems 31.25 and 29.8, PFA implies OCA which implies b = ℵ2.
Thus to complete the proof of Theorem 31.23 it is enough to show that
PFA implies b = 2ℵ0. We shall use another technical lemma of Todorˇcevi´c
that we state without a proof.
Let κ ≤2ℵ0 be a regular uncountable cardinal and let F : [κ]2 →ω be
a partition. Let P be the forcing with countable conditions that adds a subset
of ω1. In V P , |κ| = ℵ1 and cf κ = ω1; let ˙C ∈V P be a closed unbounded
subset of κ of order-type ω1, consisting of limit ordinals. For every n and k let
˙Rk
n be the forcing where conditions are ﬁnite k-homogeneous (for F) subsets
of ˙C + n = {α + n : α ∈˙C}. ˙Rk
n adds a k-homogeneous subset ˙Gk
n of ˙C + n.
(In general, ˙Rk
n need not satisfy the countable chain condition.) Let ˙Qk
n be
the product of ω copies of ˙Rk
n, and for every real r ∈ωω, let ˙Qr = ˙Qr( ˙C) be
the product of ˙Qr(n)
n
, n < ω.
Lemma 31.26. There exists a partition F : [b]2 →ω such that in V P , for
every
˙C as above and every r ∈ωω,
˙Qr( ˙C) satisﬁes the countable chain
condition.
Proof. See Bekkali [1991], page 49. The partition F is obtained by using
oscillating real numbers, cf. Chapter 1 of Todorˇcevi´c [1989].
⊓⊔
Lemma 31.27. PFA implies b = 2ℵ0.
Proof. Let F : [b]2 →ω be as in Lemma 31.26. Let P be the ω-closed forcing
that adds a subset of ω1, and let ˙C ∈V P be a closed unbounded subset of b,
of order-type ω1.
Let r ∈ωω. The forcing P ∗˙Qr( ˙C) is proper and we apply PFA to obtain
a suﬃciently generic ﬁlter G×
n

i Gn,i. Let C(r) = C = ˙CG; C is a closed
unbounded subset of some δ(r) = δ < b, cf δ = ω1, and for each n, each Gn,i
is an r(n)-homogeneous subset of C + n. Let Cn,i = Gn,i −n; by genericity,
we have C = 
i<ω Cn,i for each n, and
(31.5)
r(n) = k
if and only if
∀i ∀α, β ∈Cn,i F(α + n, β + n) = k.
We claim that if r ̸= s then δ(r) ̸= δ(s).
Let n be such that r(n) ̸= s(n). Assuming that δ(r) = δ(s) = δ, the set
C(r) ∩C(s) is closed unbounded in δ, and we can ﬁnd i and j such that
Cn,i(r) ∩Cn,j(s) is unbounded. Let α < β be in this unbounded set; then
by (31.5), F(α + β, β + n) = r(n) = r(s), a contradiction.
Thus we have produced a one-to-one mapping of ωω into b.
⊓⊔
The next theorem establishes the consistency strength of PFA (see the
discussion following the proof):
Theorem 31.28 (Todorˇcevi´c). PFA implies that □κ fails for every un-
countable cardinal κ.

31. Proper Forcing
611
Proof. Let κ be an uncountable cardinal, assume that □κ holds, and let
⟨Cα : α ∈Lim(κ+)⟩be a square-sequence (cf. (23.4)).
Let T be the tree whose nodes are limit ordinals below κ+, and β ≺α if
β ∈Lim(Cα). Since ⟨Cα⟩α is a square-sequence, T has no κ+-branch.
Let λ be suﬃciently large, and consider countable elementary submod-
els M of Hλ such that ⟨Cα : α < κ+⟩∈M; let δM = (M ∩κ+). An elemen-
tary chain is a sequence ⟨Mα : α < ω1⟩of elementary submodels of Hλ such
that Mα ⊂Mβ and Mα ∈Mβ whenever α < β, and Mα = 
β<α Mβ if α is
a limit ordinal. If E is a ﬁnite subset of ω1 then an E-chain is ⟨Mα : α ∈E⟩
such that each Mα is an elementary submodel of Hλ, and Mα ∪{Mα} ⊂Mβ
for α < β in E.
We now deﬁne a forcing notion P as follows: A condition p ∈P is a pair
(⟨Nα : α ∈E⟩, f) where
(i) E is a ﬁnite subset of ω1 and ⟨Nα : α ∈E⟩is an E-chain such
that there exists an elementary chain ⟨Mα : α < ω1⟩such that
Nα = Mα for all α ∈E,
(ii) f is a function from {δNα : α ∈E} into ω such that f(γ) ̸= f(δ)
whenever γ ≺δ.
(31.6)
A condition q is stronger than p if p = q↾E.
Note that (i) resembles the forcing that adds a closed unbounded set with
ﬁnite conditions, and (ii) resembles the forcing that specializes an Aronszajn
tree.
Lemma 31.29. P is proper.
Proof. We omit the proof, as it is similar to the proof of properness in Exer-
cise 31.5 (and using the fact that (T, ≺) has no κ+-branch).
⊓⊔
Now we use PFA to reach a contradiction. Let G be a suﬃciently generic
ﬁlter on P. The ﬁlter G yields an elementary chain ⟨Nα : α < ω1⟩and a closed
unbounded set {δα : α < ω1} (where δα = δNα) with supremum γ. There is
a closed unbounded set C ⊂ω1 such that for all α ∈C, δα is a limit point
of Cγ. Since δα ≺δβ whenever α < β ∈C, it follows that {δα : α ∈C} is an
ω1-chain in T .
On the other hand, the ﬁlter G yields a specializing function on {δα :
α < ω1}, that is a function F with values in ω such that F(δα) ̸= F(δβ)
whenever δα ≺δβ. A contradiction.
⊓⊔
The proof of Theorem 31.28 has been modiﬁed by Magidor to show that
under PFA, even a weak version of □fails (we shall discuss these versions
of □in Chapter 38). It has been proved by Schimmerling that the failure of
those principles imply an inner model for a Woodin cardinal. Thus we have:
Theorem 31.30 (Schimmerling). If PFA holds then there exists an inner
model of “there exists a Woodin cardinal.”
⊓⊔

612
Part III. Selected Topics
Martin’s Axiom MAℵ1 implies that there are no Suslin trees, and more-
over, that every Aronszajn tree is special. PFA implies a stronger result. If
T is a normal ω1-tree and C ⊂ω1 a closed unbounded set, then T ↾C is the
tree {t ∈T : o(t) ∈C}. Two trees T1 and T2 are club-isomorphic if there
exists a closed unbounded C such that T1↾C and T2↾C are isomorphic.
Theorem 31.31. If PFA holds then any two normal Aronszajn trees are
club-isomorphic.
Proof. Let T1 and T2 be two normal Aronszajn trees. Consider the forcing
with ﬁnite conditions (E, f) such that
(i) E is a ﬁnite subset of ω1,
(ii) dom(f) is a subtree of T1↾E in which every branch has size |E|;
similarly for ran(f) ⊂T2↾E,
(iii) f us an isomorphism.
(31.7)
We omit the proof that P is proper and refer the reader to Todorˇcevi´c [1984],
Theorem 5.10.
A suﬃciently generic ﬁlter on P yields an uncountable set A and an
isomorphism between T1↾A and T2↾A, which easily extends to T1↾C where
C is the closure of A.
⊓⊔
We present one more consequence of PFA, due to J. Baumgartner (com-
pare with Theorem 28.24):
Theorem 31.32. If PFA holds then there are no ℵ2-Aronszajn trees.
Proof. Assume that T is an ℵ2-Aronszajn tree. Let P be the forcing that adds
a subset of ω1 with countable conditions. Since 2ℵ0 = ℵ2, P collapses ω2 and
so there is in V P a closed unbounded subset ˙C of ω2, of order-type ω1. The
tree T has no new branches (this is proved as in Lemma 27.10, because the
levels of T have size ℵ1 < 2ℵ0). Thus ˙U = T ↾˙C is in V P an ω1-tree with no
ω1-branches.
Now let ˙Q ∈V P be the specializing forcing for ˙U, as in Theorem 16.17.
˙Q satisﬁes the countable chain condition, and so P ∗˙Q is proper.
Let G be a suﬃciently generic ﬁlter on P ∗˙Q. It yields a closed unbounded
subset C of some γ < ω2, a tree U = T ↾C, and a specializing function f :
U →ω. This is a contradiction, since a special tree has no ω1-branches, while
every t ∈T at level γ produces an ω1-branch in U.

The following two exercises present equivalent versions of the proper game:
31.2. Let p ∈P. Player II has a winning strategy in the proper game if and only if
II has a winning strategy in the game where I plays ordinal names ˙αn and II plays
countable sets of ordinals Bn, and II wins if some q ≤p forces ∀n ∃k ˙αn ∈Bk.
31.3. P is proper if and only if for every p ∈P, II has a winning strategy in the

n is predense below q.
[In the forward direction, let λ be suﬃciently large and let C be a closed un-
bounded set of models M ≺Hλ that satisfy (31.1) and p ∈M. The following is
a winning strategy for II: When I plays An, let II choose some Mn ∈C such that
Mn ⊃Mn−1 and An ∈Mn, and let Bn
k = Ak∩Mn, k = 0, . . . , n. Let M = S∞
n=0 Mn
and let q ≤p be (M, P)-generic. Since An ∩M = S∞
k=0 Bk
n, II wins.
Conversely, let σ be a winning strategy for II, and let λ be suﬃciently large
with σ ∈Hλ. Show that for every M ≺Hλ such that P, p, σ ∈M there is some
(M, P)-generic q ≤p (by playing a game in which I plays successively all maximal
antichains A ∈M). Let Cp be the closed unbounded set of all such M; the diagonal
intersection △p Cp witnesses that P is proper.]
31.4. If P satisﬁes Axiom A and p ∈P then II has a winning strategy in the
following game (more diﬃcult for player II than the proper game): I plays ordinal
names ˙αn and II plays countable sets of ordinals Bn; II wins if some q ≤p forces
∀n ˙αn ∈Bn.
Adding a closed unbounded set with ﬁnite conditions: A condition p ∈P
is a ﬁnite function with dom(p) ⊂ω1, ran(p) ⊂ω1 such that there exists a normal
function f : ω1 →ω1 with f ⊃p. A condition q is stronger than p if q ⊃p. If
G is generic then fG = S{p : p ∈G} is a normal function. Note that if α = ωβ
(an indecomposable ordinal) and p ⊂α × ω is a condition then p ∪{(α, α)} is also
a condition.
31.5. Let P be as above and let p ∈P. Then II has a winning strategy in the game
from Exercise 31.3. Hence P is proper.
[When I plays An, II ﬁnds some indecomposable αn > αn−1 such that for all
k ≤n
(∀β < α)(∃γ < α)(∀p ⊂γ × γ)(∃q ⊂γ × γ) q ∈Ak
(and q is compatible with p), and plays Bn
k = {p ∈Ak : p ⊂αn × αn}.]
31.6. Let P be as above. Then I has a winning strategy in the game from Exer-
cise 31.4. Hence P does not satisfy Axiom A.
[Let ˙f be the name for fG. At move n, player I chooses an indecomposable
ordinal αn greater than Bn−1 and plays ˙f(αn).]
31.7. Let P be the ω-closed forcing for collapsing ω2 to ω1 with countable condi-
tions. There exists a set D of ℵ2 dense sets for which there is no D-generic ﬁlter.
[For α < ω2, let Dα = {p ∈P : α ∈ran(p)}.]
PFA+ is the following statement: If P is proper, if D = {Dα : α < ω1} are
dense sets and if ⊩˙S ⊂ω1 is stationary, then there exists a D-generic ﬁlter G such
that ˙SG is stationary (where ˙SG = {α : ∃p ∈G p ⊩α ∈˙S}).

ω
reﬂects at some γ of coﬁnality ω1.
[Let A ⊂Eκ
ω be stationary. Let P consist of closed countable subsets of κ,
ordered by end-extension. P is ω-closed and adds a closed unbounded subset ˙C ⊂κ

˙S = f−1(A ∩˙C) where f is the isomorphism between ω1 and ˙C. If G is suﬃciently
generic such that ˙SG is stationary, then A ∩˙CG is stationary in γ = sup ˙CG.]
PFA−is the statement: If P is proper such that |P| ≤ℵ1 and if D = {Dα :
α < ω1} are dense then there exists a D-generic ﬁlter. In [1982] Shelah proves that
PFA−is consistent relative to ZFC only.

[The forcing in (31.7) has size ℵ1.]

Π1
1 Equivalence Relations
Theorem 32.1 (Silver). If E is a Π1
1 equivalence relation on N then either
E has at most ℵ0 equivalence classes or there exits a perfect set of mutually
inequivalent reals.
Thus every Π1
1 (and in particular) Borel equivalence relation has either at
most countably many or 2ℵ0 equivalence classes. This can be viewed as a gen-
eralization of the perfect set property for analytic sets (Theorem 11.18); cf.
Exercise 32.1. The theorem does not extend to Σ1
1, as there exists a Σ1
1 equiv-
alence relation with exactly ℵ1 equivalence classes (Exercise 32.2).
We present a proof of Theorem 32.1 that is due to Leo Harrington. We
start with an easy lemma.
Lemma 32.2. Let E be a meager equivalence relation on N. Then there
exist a perfect set of inequivalent reals.
Proof. Let {Dn}n be dense open sets in N ×N such that N 2−E ⊃∞
n=0 Dn.
We construct a binary tree of ﬁnite sequences {us : s ∈Seq({0, 1})} ⊂Seq
such that for every n, if |s| = |t| = n and s ̸= t, then O(us) × O(ut) ⊂Dn.
This is done by induction on the length of s. If the us have been deﬁned
for all s ∈{0, 1}n, we consider successively all possible pairs (s⌢i, t⌢j), and
using the density of Dn+1, successively extend each us⌢i until O(us⌢i) ×
O(ut⌢j) ⊂Dn+1 for all s, t ∈{0, 1}n and i, j = 0, 1.
For each f ∈{0, 1}ω let af be the unique member of ∞
n=0 O(uf↾n). The
set {af : f ∈{0, 1}ω} is perfect, and if f ̸= g then (af, ag) /∈E.
⊓⊔
We shall use a version of Lemma 32.2 for a diﬀerent topology on N × N.
Toward the proof let us recall some basic facts about the property of Baire.
In particular, Lemmas 11.16 and 11.17 as well as the fact that the σ-algebra
of sets with the Baire property is closed under the Suslin operation A, remain
true in every second countable space (i.e., space that has a countable basis).
We shall prove Silver’s Theorem for (lightface) Π1
1 equivalence relations;
the proof relativizes to Π1
1(a) for every real parameter a.
Deﬁnition 32.3. The Σ1
1-topology on N is the topology with basic open sets
being all the Σ1 subsets of N.

616
Part III. Selected Topics
The Σ1
1-topology has a countable base and is larger than the standard
topology, as every basic open set O(s) in N is Σ0
1.
Lemma 32.4. The Σ1
1-topology satisﬁes the Baire Category Theorem.
Proof. Exercise 32.3.
⊓⊔
Lemma 32.5. If X is comeager in the Σ1
1-topology then for every nonempty
Σ1
1 subset A of N × N, A ∩(X × X) ̸= ∅.
Proof. The lemma states that X × X is dense in the Σ1
1-topology on N × N
(which is larger than the product of the Σ1
1-topology). If D is a dense open
set in the Σ1
1-topology then D × N is dense open in the Σ1
1-topology on N 2:
This is because if A ̸= ∅is a Σ1
1 subset of N 2 then its projection is Σ1
1 and
hence meets D.
Let X ⊃∞
n=0 Dn where each Dn is dense open. Then X × X ⊃
∞
n=0(Dn × N) ∩∞
n=0(N × Dn), and the latter set is dense, by the Baire
Category Theorem applied to the Σ1
1-topology on N × N.
⊓⊔
Given a Π1
1 equivalence relation E on N, consider the set that is the
complement of the union of all Σ1
1 sets contained in some equivalence class:
(32.1)
H = {a ∈N : for every Σ1
1 set U, if a ∈U then there is a b ∈U with
(a, b) /∈E}.
Note that if H is empty then every equivalence class is the union of Σ1
1 sets
and therefore there are at most ℵ0 equivalence classes. We shall prove that if
H ̸= ∅then there exists a perfect set of inequivalent reals.
Lemma 32.6. H is a Σ1
1 set.
Proof. First note that if an equivalence class A of E contains a nonempty
Σ1
1 set U then A is Π1
1:
x ∈A ↔∀y (y ∈U →x E y).
Then by the separation principle there exists a ∆1
1 set V such that U ⊂
V ⊂A. It follows that
(32.2)
H = {a : for every ∆1
1 set U, if a ∈U then ∃b ∈U with (a, b) /∈E}.
The quantiﬁcation “for every ∆1
1 set” in (32.2) can be replaced by “for every
Borel code for a ∆1
1 set” and since we are dealing only with lightface ∆1
1 sets,
this can be replaced by a number quantiﬁer ∀n. Similarly, “a ∈U” and
“b ∈U” are ∆1
1 properties, and it follows that H is Σ1
1.
⊓⊔
Lemma 32.7. For every a ∈N, Ea ∩H is meager in the Σ1
1-topology, where
Ea = {b : (a, b) ∈E}.

32. More Descriptive Set Theory
617
Proof. If H = ∅then there is nothing to prove; thus assume H ̸= ∅. The
set Ea is Π1
1 and therefore has the Baire property in the Σ1
1-topology. If
Ea ∩H is not meager then there exists a nonempty Σ1
1 set U such that
Ea ∩U is comeager in U. As U ⊂H, U × U is not contained in E and so
U 2−E is nonempty; hence we have (by Lemma 32.5) (U 2−E)∩(Ea∩U)2 ̸= ∅.
In other words there exist b, c ∈U such that a E b, a E c and (b, c) /∈E,
a contradiction.
⊓⊔
Lemma 32.8. E ∩(H × H) is meager (in the product of the Σ1
1-topology).
Proof. By Lemma 32.7 and Lemma 11.16.
⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 32.1. If H is empty then E has at most ℵ0 equivalence
classes. If H ̸= ∅then H is Σ1
1 and therefore a basic open set in the Σ1
1-
topology. By Lemma 32.8 E ∩(H × H) is meager in the product of the
Σ1
1-topology. The rest of the proof (which we omit) is a combination of the
construction in the proof of Lemma 32.2 and the construction in Exercise 32.3:
One can produce a perfect set {af : f ∈{0, 1}ω} ⊂H2 such that (af, ag) /∈E
whenever f ̸= g.
⊓⊔
Σ1
1 Equivalence Relations
Theorem 32.9. If E is a Σ1
1 equivalence relation on N then either E has
at most ℵ1 equivalence classes or there exists a perfect set of mutually in-
equivalent reals.
This theorem, due to J. Burgess, extends Silver’s Theorem and uses it in
the proof. Note that Exercise 32.2 makes it best possible.
Proof. Let E be a Σ1
1 equivalence relation. There exists a tree T on (ω×ω)×ω
such that for all a, b ∈N
(32.3)
a E b ↔T (a, b) is ill-founded.
We deﬁne, for each α < ω1, a relation Eα on N as follows:
(32.4)
a Eα b ↔not (∥T (a, b)∥< α).
It is clear that each Eα is a Borel relation, Eα ⊃Eβ if α < β, Eα = 
β<α Eβ
if α is limit, and E = 
α<ω1 Eα. Moreover, each Eα is reﬂexive as Eα ⊃E.
Lemma 32.10. There is a closed unbounded set C ⊂ω1 such that for each

Proof. If T (x, y) is well-founded then so is T (y, x) (by the symmetry of E) and
so for every α < ω1 the set {T (y, x) : ∥T (x, y)∥< α} is a set of well-founded
trees. The set is Σ1
1 and so, by the Boundedness Lemma there is a countable
ordinal f(α) such that ∥T (y, x)∥< f(α) whenever ∥T (x, y)∥< α. Let γ be
a closure point of f, i.e., if α < γ then f(α) < γ. Let a, b ∈N. If (b, a) /∈Eγ,
or ∥T (b, a)∥< γ, then ∥T (a, b)∥< γ, or (a, b) /∈Eγ and so Eγ is symmetric.
Similarly, there is a function g : ω1 →ω1 such that if γ is a closure
point of g then for all a, b, c ∈N, if (a, c) /∈Eγ then either (a, b) /∈Eγ or
(b, c) /∈Eγ. Let C be the set of all closure points of both f and g.
⊓⊔
Now assume that E has more than ℵ1 equivalence classes. We shall prove
that there exists a perfect set of E-inequivalent reals.
Let V [G] be a generic extension of V that collapses ℵ1 and makes ℵV
2 =
ℵV [G]
1
. Let ˜E denote the relation deﬁned in V [G] by (32.3), and for each
α < ωV [G]
1
let ˜Eα be deﬁned by (32.4). ˜E is Σ1
1, and each ˜Eα is Borel. By
absoluteness, ˜E ∩V = E and ˜E is an equivalence relation, ˜Eα ∩V = Eα
for each α < ωV
1 , and if Eα is an equivalence relation then so is ˜Eα. Since
˜EωV
1 = 
α<ωV
1 ˜Eα, it is a Borel equivalence relation. We assume that E has,
in V , a set X of size ℵ2 of inequivalent reals. If x, y ∈X and x, y /∈E then
(x, y) /∈Eα for some α < ωV
1 . Hence X is a set of ˜EωV
1 -inequivalent reals,
and X is uncountable in V [G].
By Silver’s Theorem, ˜EωV
1 has a perfect set of inequivalent reals. These
reals are ˜E-inequivalent and so
(32.5)
V [G] ⊨there is a perfect set of ˜E-inequivalent reals.
However, the statement in (32.5) true in V [G] is clearly Σ1
2 and so by Shoen-
ﬁeld’s Absoluteness Theorem, it holds in V . Therefore in V , there exists
a perfect set of E-inequivalent reals.

Constructible Reals and Perfect Sets
We recall (Lemma 26.50) that if there exists a nonconstructible real then the
set R ∩L is Lebesgue measurable only if it is null, and has the property of
Baire only if it is meager. The following theorem proves a similar result for
perfect sets.
Theorem 32.11. If there exists a nonconstructible real then the set R ∩L
does not have a perfect subset.
Proof. As a ﬁrst step we show that R∩L does not have a superperfect subset.
A tree T ⊂Seq is superperfect if for every t ∈T there exists an s ⊃t in T
such that s⌢k ∈T for inﬁnitely many k ∈ω. (We call s an ω-splitting node
of T .) A nonempty set P ⊂N is superperfect if P = [T ] for some superperfect
tree T .

32. More Descriptive Set Theory

Lemma 32.12. If N ∩L has a superperfect subset then every real is con-
structible.
Proof. Instead of N, consider the space [ω]ω of increasing sequences of natural
numbers. Let x, y, z be distinct elements of [ω]ω and let
(32.6)
O(x, y, z) = {n ∈ω : z(n −1) ≤x(n −1), z(n −1) ≤y(n −1) and
z(n) > x(n), z(n) > y(n)}.
If O(x, y, z) is inﬁnite, let ⟨nk : k ∈ω⟩be its increasing enumeration and let
(32.7)
o(x, y, z) = {k : x(nk) ≤y(nk)}.
Now assume that P = [T ] is a superperfect subset of [ω]ω such that every
x ∈P is constructible. We shall prove that every real is constructible as
follows: Let A ⊂ω be arbitrary; we shall ﬁnd x, y, z ∈[T ] such that o(x, y, z)
(is deﬁned and) is equal to A. Then A is constructible, as the deﬁnition (32.7)
is absolute for L.
Thus let A ⊂ω be arbitrary. We ﬁnd x, y, z ∈[T ] by constructing in-
ductively their initial segments. We construct sequences x0 ⊂x1 ⊂. . . ⊂
xk ⊂. . ., y0 ⊂y1 ⊂. . . ⊂yk ⊂. . ., and z0 ⊂z1 ⊂. . . ⊂zk ⊂. . . of
ω-splitting nodes of T such that for each k, nk = |zk| is the kth element of
O(x, y, z), and k ∈o(x, y, z) if and only if k ∈A. Inductively, we arrange
lk = |xk| > nk and mk = |yk| > nk, as well as zk(nk −1) ≤xk(nk −1) and
zk(nk −1) ≤yk(nk −1).
We omit the initial stage of the induction as it is similar to the induc-
tion step: At stage k + 1 we ﬁnd an integer i greater than xk(lk −1) and
yk(mk −1) such that z ⌢
k i ∈T . Then we let zk+1 ⊃zk be an ω-splitting node
above such that nk+1 = |zk+1| is greater than lk and mk. Now if k + 1 ∈A,
let j > zk+1(nk+1 −1) be such that x ⌢
k j ∈T , and let xk+1 ⊃x ⌢
k j be an ω-
splitting node such that lk+1 = |xk+1| > nk+1. Then let h > xk+1(lk+1 −1)
be such that y ⌢
k h ∈T and let yk+1 ⊃y ⌢
k h be an ω-splitting node such that
mk+1 = |yk+1| ≥lk+1. If k + 1 /∈A, we reverse the construction of xk+1
and yk+1. Since xk+1, yk+1, and zk+1 are all increasing it follows that nk+1 is
the least n > nk that belongs to O(x, y, z), and the construction guarantees
that x(nk+1) ≤y(nk+1) if and only if k + 1 ∈A.
⊓⊔
Now we complete the proof of the theorem. If R∩L is countable then the
theorem is true trivially, so assume that ℵL
1 = ℵ1. If X is a countable subset
of R ∩L, then given a constructible enumeration ⟨aα : α < ω1⟩of R ∩L, we
have X ⊂{aα : α < γ} for some γ < ω1, and so there exists a constructible
Y ⊂R ∩L such that X ⊂Y and |Y |L = ℵ0.
Let P be a perfect subset of the Cantor space and assume that P ⊂
{0, 1}ω ∩L. Applying the preceding argument to a countable dense subset
X ⊂P, we obtain a constructible countable set D ∈L that is a dense subset
of C = {0, 1}ω and that D ∩P is dense in P. Let C −D = X.

The space X is homeomorphic to the irrationals which in turn is homeo-
morphic to N and N is homeomorphic to [ω]ω. Thus there exists a homeomor-
phism h between X and [ω]ω; moreover h is coded in L because D ∈L. The
set P −D, a closed subset of X, contains no compact subset with nonempty
interior, and therefore the set h(P −D) has the same property in [ω]ω; it fol-
lows that h(P −D) is superperfect. Hence h(P −D) is a superperfect subset
of [ω]ω ∩L, contradicting Lemma 32.12.

Projective Sets and Large Cardinals
One of the successes of modern set theory has been the discovery of the close
relationship between the hierarchy of deﬁnable sets of reals and the hierar-
chy of large cardinals. We shall elaborate on this relationship in subsequent
chapters. In the present section we apply the large cardinal theory to Σ1
3 sets.
By Theorem 25.38, the perfect set property for Σ1
2 sets is equivalent to
the large cardinal assumption
(32.8)
ℵ1 is inaccessible in L[a], for every a ∈R
(see Exercise 32.4). The statement (32.8) also implies that every Σ1
2 set is
Lebesgue measurable and has the Baire property.
By Solovay’s Theorem 26.14, inaccessibility is suﬃcient for the consis-
tency of Lebesgue measurability and the Baire property of all projective sets.
The following theorem shows that the assumption is necessary for Lebesgue
measurability, while by another result of Shelah, the Baire property for all
projective sets is consistent relative to ZFC only:
Theorem 32.13 (Shelah [1984]). If every Σ1
3 set of reals is Lebesgue mea-
surable then ℵ1 is an inaccessible cardinal in L.
⊓⊔
We shall outline a result that shows that under a suitable strengthening
of (32.8), every Σ1
3 set is Lebesgue measurable, has the Baire property, and
has the perfect set property. The key is a tree representation of Σ1
3 sets in
the presence of a measurable cardinal.
Theorem 32.14 (Martin and Solovay [1969], Mansﬁeld [1971]). If
there exists a measurable cardinal then for every Σ1
3 set A there exists a tree T
on ω × λ (for some λ) such that A = p[T ].
Proof. Let κ be a measurable cardinal and let U be a normal measure on κ.
For each n, let Un be the ultraﬁlter {X ⊂κn : X ⊃[Z]n for some Z ∈U}, and
let jn = in,n+1 be the canonical elementary embedding in,n+1 : UltUn(V ) →
UltUn+1(V ).

Let A ⊂N be a Σ1
3 set. A can be expressed as
(32.9)
x ∈A ↔∃y ∀z R(x, y, z) is ill-founded
where R is a recursive function, R(x, y, z) is, for each x, y, z, a linear order
of ω and R(x, y, z) restricted to n = {0, . . . , n −1} depends only on x↾n,
y↾n, z↾n. Let π : Seq3 →ω be deﬁned so that π(x↾n, y↾n, z↾n) is the position
of n −1 in the order R(x, y, z)↾n. Let {sk}∞
k=0 be an enumeration of Seq. We
let α = i0,ω(κ), and deﬁne
(32.10)
(x↾n, y↾n, ⟨β0, . . . , βn−1⟩) ∈T ↔jπ(x↾l,y↾l,sk)(βk) > βi
for every i = 0, . . . , n −2, where l = length(si) and sk = si↾l.
We leave to the reader to verify that x ∈A if and only if T (x), a tree
on ω × α, is ill-founded. For details we refer to Kanamori’s book [1994],
Chapter 15.
⊓⊔
A careful analysis of the tree representation in Theorem 32.14 shows that
the assumption can be weakened to
(32.11)
for every a ∈R, a♯exists
and the tree T can be constructed on ω×ω2 (see Kanamori [1994] for details).
Thus one obtains:
Theorem 32.15 (Martin). If for every a ∈R, a♯exists, then every Σ1
3 set
is ω2-Suslin, and hence a union of ℵ2 Borel sets.
⊓⊔
The following theorem establishes good behavior of Σ1
3 sets under a large
cardinal assumption:
Theorem 32.16 (Magidor [1980]). Let us assume that there exists a mea-
surable cardinal, and that ω1 carries a precipitous ideal. Then every Σ1
3 set
is Lebesgue measurable, has the Baire property, and is either countable or
contains a perfect subset.
Proof. Let A be a Σ1
3 set and let A = p[T ] where T is the tree deﬁned in the
proof of Theorem 32.14. We shall prove that under the given assumptions,
(32.12)
R ∩L[T ] is countable.
Then the statements on Lebesgue measurability and the Baire property can
be derived as the corresponding result (Theorem 26.20 and Corollary 26.21)
for Σ1
2 sets: Using absoluteness, one can show that
A = {x ∈R : L[T ] ⊨ϕ(x)}
for some formula ϕ, and apply Corollary 26.6. The perfect set property is
derived by using Lemma 25.24.

Let I be a precipitous ideal on ω1, and let M = UltG(V ) be the generic
ultrapower by I, that is by a generic ultraﬁlter G obtained by forcing P
consisting of I-positive sets. As I is precipitous, M is well-founded and we
identify it with a transitive class M ⊂V [G]. Let i : V →M be the corre-
sponding elementary embedding. We shall prove
(32.13)
i(T ) = T.
This will suﬃce, as (32.13) implies (32.12), as follows: Assume that aξ, ξ < ω1,
are uncountably many (distinct) reals in L[T ]. The function ⟨aξ : ξ < ω1⟩
represents a real a ∈UltG, and since each aξ ∈L[T ], we have a ∈L[i(T )] =
L[T ]; hence a ∈V . But then i(a) = a, and so a = aξ for G-almost all ξ. This
is a contradiction since G is nonprincipal.
Toward the proof of (32.13), let κ, U, Un, and jn be as in the proof of
Theorem 32.14.
If γ is an inaccessible cardinal then γ is still inaccessible in V [G] and it
follows that i(γ) = γ. In particular i(κ) = κ. Let U be the ﬁlter in V [G]
generated by U; similarly Un.
Lemma 32.17. i(U) = U ∩M, i(Un) = Un ∩M.
Proof. It suﬃces to show that i(U) ⊂U ∩M; if X ∈i(U) we want a W ∈U
such that X ⊃W. X is represented by ⟨Xξ : ξ < ω1⟩, so let Y = 
ξ<ω1 Xξ;
we have Y ∈U and i(Y ) ⊂X. Now if W = {γ ∈Y : γ is inaccessible} we
have W ∈U and W = i“Y ⊂i(Y ) ⊂X.

Lemma 32.18. Let h ∈V [G] be a function h : κ →V . Then there exists
a function H ∈V such that h(α) = H(α) a.e. mod U. Similarly for h : κn →
V (and Un).
Proof. For each α < κ there is a maximal antichain Wα in P and a set
{xα
p : p ∈Wα} such that p ⊩˙h(α) = xα
p . Let W be such that Wα = W for
U-almost all α, and let p be the unique p ∈G ∩W. Now let H(α) = xα
p , for
all α < κ.
⊓⊔
Lemma 32.19. Let f ∈V be a function f : κ →Ord. Then there exists
a function g ∈M such that f(α) = g(α) a.e. mod U. Similarly for f : κn →
Ord.
Proof. Every ordinal β is represented in M by some hβ : ω1 →Ord, hβ ∈V .
For each α < κ, pick (in V [G]) some hf(α) : ω1 →Ord that represents f(α)
and let h(α) = hf(α). By Lemma 32.18 there is some H ∈V such that
H(α) = hf(α) a.e.; let A ∈U be a set of inaccessibles such that H(α) = hf(α)
for all α ∈A.
For each ξ < ω1, let gξ (a function on κ, in V ) be deﬁned by gξ(α) =
(H(α))(ξ), and let G(ξ) = gξ. G is in V and represents in M some function g.
For each α ∈A, i(α) = α, and g(α) is represented by the function that
sends ξ to (H(α))(ξ), but since (H(α))(ξ) = hf(α)(ξ) for all ξ, g(α) is repre-
sented by hf(α). It follows that g(α) = f(α).
⊓⊔

32. More Descriptive Set Theory
623
As a consequence of Lemmas 32.17, 32.18, and 32.19, if a function f ∈V
represents an ordinal in UltUn(V ) then there is an Un-equivalent function
g ∈M that represents the same ordinal in Ulti(Un)(M). Consequently,
(32.14)
(i(jn))(α) = jn(α) for all α
(where i(jn) = 
γ∈Ord i(j↾Vγ)). Using (32.14) and the deﬁnition of T , one
can now verify that i(T ) = T .
⊓⊔
The existence of a measurable cardinal alone is not suﬃcient in Theo-
rem 32.16. If V = L[U] then there exists an uncountable Σ1
3 set that is not
Lebesgue measurable, does not have the Baire property, and does not contain
a perfect subset:
Theorem 32.20 (Silver [1971a]). R∩L[U] is a Σ1
3 set. The ordering <L[U]
of R is a Σ1
3 relation.
⊓⊔
Also, the analog of Lemma 25.27 holds for <L[U], and the arguments for
Σ1
2 sets and L can be adopted for Σ1
3 and L[U].
Universally Baire sets
Deﬁnition 32.21. A set A ⊂R is universally Baire if for any compact
Hausdorﬀspace X and any continuous function f : X →R, the set
f−1(A) has the property of Baire in X.
The set of all universally Baire sets is a σ-algebra and is closed under
operation A. Thus every Σ1
1 set is universally Baire. We show below that
every universally Baire set is Lebesgue measurable and that the statement
that every ∆1
2 set is universally Baire has consistency strength between inac-
cessible and Mahlo cardinals. The assumption that every projective (or even
every Σ1
2 set) is universally Baire is considerably stronger; we refer to Feng,
Magidor and Woodin [1992] for details.
Theorem 32.22. A set A ⊂R is universally Baire if and only if for every
notion of forcing P there exist trees T and S on ω × λ (where λ = 2|P |) such
that
(32.15)
A = p[T ],
R −A = p[S]
and for every generic ﬁlter G on P,
V [G] ⊨p[T ] ∪p[S] = R and p[T ] ∩p[S] = ∅.
⊓⊔
(32.16)
We omit the proof of this equivalence. We remark that in the deﬁnition the
space X can be replaced by the generalized Cantor space λω (for all λ), and
in the theorem, the forcing notion P can be replaced by Col(λ) = Col(ω, λ),
the collapse of λ with ﬁnite conditions.

Corollary 32.23. Every universally Baire set is Lebesgue measurable.
Proof. Let A ⊂R be universally Baire. Let B be the measure algebra, and
let T and S be trees on ω × λ such that A = p[T ], R −A = p[S], and
(32.16) holds for every generic ultraﬁlter G on B.
Let ˙a be the canonical name for a random real and let B be a Borel set
such that ∥˙a ∈p[T ]∥= [B]. We will show that A △B has measure 0, and
thus A is measurable.
Let M be a countable elementary submodel of Hκ where Hκ is suﬃciently
large. We claim that for every random real x over M,
(32.17)
x ∈p[T ] ↔x ∈B.
If x ∈B then B ⊩˙a ∈p[T ] and hence M ⊨(B ⊩˙a ∈p[T ]). Thus
M[x] ⊨x ∈p[T ], and so x ∈p[T ]. If x /∈B then −B ⊩˙a ∈p[S] and
M[x] ⊨x ∈p[S], and hence x /∈p[T ], proving (32.17).
Since M is countable, almost all reals are random over M, and therefore
A △B is null.
⊓⊔
Theorem 32.24. The following are equivalent:
(i) Every ∆1
2 set is universally Baire.
(ii) V is Σ1
3-absolute with respect to every generic extension.
The statement (ii) states precisely: If P is a forcing notion and ϕ(x1, . . . ,
xn) a Π1
3 formula then for all reals a1, . . . , an,
ϕ(a1, . . . , an)
if and only if
⊩P ϕ(a1, . . . , an).
Its consistency strength is between inaccessible and Mahlo: It is the exis-
tence of an inaccessible cardinal κ such that Vκ ≺Σ2 V ; see Exercises 32.6,
32.7, 32.8.
Proof. First assume Σ1
3-absoluteness for generic extensions and let A be
a ∆1
2 set. We have
(32.18)
x ∈A ↔∃y ϕ(x, y) ↔x ∈p[T ]
and
(32.19)
x ∈A ↔∃y ψ(x, y) ↔x ∈p[S]
where ϕ and ψ are Π1
1 and T and S are trees on ω × ω1.
If V [G] is a generic extension then the second equivalences in (32.18)
and (32.19) hold in V [G], by Σ1
2-absoluteness. Since p[T ] ∪p[S] = R is
a Π1
3 statement (namely ∀x (∃y ϕ ∨∃y ψ)), and p[T ] ∩p[S] = ∅is Π1
2, Σ1
3-
absoluteness gives (32.16).

32. More Descriptive Set Theory

Now assume that every ∆1
2 set is universally Baire and prove the generic
Σ1
3-absoluteness. It is enough to prove it for P = Col(λ), as every V P embeds
in V Col(λ) for suﬃciently large λ.
Let ϕ be a Σ1
1 formula (with a parameter in RV ) and assume that V [G] ⊨
∃x ∀y ϕ(x, y). Let ˙x ∈V Col(λ) be such that ⊩∀y ϕ( ˙x, y). There is a function
f : λω →ωω such that f is continuous on a comeager Gδ set such that for
every generic collapse G ∈λω, f(G) = ˙xG.
Toward a contradiction, assume that V ⊨∀x ∃y ¬ϕ(x, y). By Kondˆo’s Uni-
formization Theorem, there exists a Π1
1 function g such that ∀x ¬ϕ(x, g(x)).
We claim that the function g ◦f is continuous on a comeager set in λω. For
each s ∈Seq, g−1(O(s)) is a ∆1
2 set, therefore universally Baire, and so there
exists an open set Ds such that Bs = Ds △f−1(g−1(O(s))) is meager. Let
A = λω −{Bs : s ∈Seq}; A is comeager and g ◦f is continuous on A.
We may assume that A = ∞
n=0 Dn, with each Dn dense open. For x ∈A,
let F(x) = (f(x), g(f(x))); F is continuous on A.
Let T be a tree on ω×ω×ω such that p[T ] is the Σ1
1 set {(x, y) : ϕ(x, y)}.
Since V [G] ⊨ϕ(f(G), g(f(G))) and G ∈∞
n=0 Dn, we have that T (F(G)) is
ill-founded. In other words, V [G] satisﬁes
(32.20)
∃x T(F(x)) is ill-founded.
The statement (32.20) can be expressed as “T ∗is ill-founded” where T ∗is
the tree
(σ, s, t, u) ∈T ∗↔(s, t, u) ∈T , length(σ) = length(s) = n
and ∃τ O(σ⌢τ) ⊂
i≤n Di and
F“(O(σ⌢τ) −∞
n=0(λω −Dn)) ⊂O(s, t)
(where O(σ⌢τ) and O(s, t) are basic open sets in λω and ωω × ωω).
By absoluteness, T ∗is ill-founded in V , and so (32.20) holds in V . In
other words, for some x ∈A we have ϕ(f(x), g(f(x))), a contradiction.

a natural number b0, then I chooses a1, then II chooses b1, and so on. The
game ends after ω steps; if the resulting sequence ⟨a0, b0, a1, b1, . . .⟩is in A,
then I wins, otherwise II wins.
A strategy (for I or II) is a rule that tells the player what move to make
depending on the previous moves of both players. A strategy is a winning
strategy if the player who follows it always wins. The game GA is determined
if one of the players has a winning strategy.
The Axiom of Determinacy (AD) states that for every A ⊂ωω, the
game GA is determined.
Determinacy and Choice
First some deﬁnitions: Let A ⊂ωω be given and let GA denote the corre-
sponding game. A play is a sequence ⟨a0, b0, a1, b1, . . .⟩∈ωω; for each n, an is
the nth move of player I and bn is the nth move of player II. A strategy for I
is a function σ with values in ω whose domain consists of ﬁnite sequences
s ∈Seq of even length. Player I plays ⟨a0, b0, a1, b1, . . .⟩by the strategy σ
if a0 = σ(∅), a1 = σ(⟨a0, b0⟩), a2 = σ(⟨a0, b0, a1, b1⟩), and so on; it is clear
that if I plays by σ, then the play is determined by σ and the sequence
b = ⟨bn : n ∈ω⟩. We denote the play by σ ∗b. A strategy σ is a winning
strategy for I if
{σ ∗b : b ∈N} ⊂A,
in other words, if all plays that I plays by σ are in A. Similarly, a strategy
for II is a function τ with values in ω, deﬁned on ﬁnite sequences s ∈Seq of
odd length. If a ∈N and if τ is a strategy for II, then a ∗τ denotes the play
in which I plays a and II plays by τ. A strategy τ for II is a winning strategy
if
{a ∗τ : a ∈N} ⊂N −A.
We sometimes consider games GA whose moves are not natural numbers
but elements of an arbitrary set S. A play is then a sequence p ∈Sω, and the

628

result of the game depends on whether p ∈A or p /∈A (here A is a subset
of Sω). The other relevant notions are deﬁned accordingly.
Since the number of strategies is 2ℵ0, an easy diagonal argument shows
that the Axiom of Choice is incompatible with the Axiom of Determinacy:
Lemma 33.1. Assuming the Axiom of Choice, there exists A ⊂ωω such
that the game GA is not determined.
Proof. Let {σα : α < 2ℵ0} and {τα : α < 2ℵ0} enumerate all strategies
for I and all strategies for II. We construct sets X = {xα : α < 2ℵ0} and
Y = {yα : α < 2ℵ0}, subsets of N, as follows: Given {xξ : ξ < α} and
{yξ : ξ < α}, let us choose some yα such that yα = σα ∗b for some b and
yα /∈{xξ : ξ < α} (such yα exist because the set {σα ∗b : b ∈N} has
size 2ℵ0); similarly, let us choose xα such that xα = a ∗τα for some a and
xα /∈{yξ : ξ ≤α}. It is clear that the sets X and Y are disjoint, that for
each α there is b such that σα ∗b /∈X, and there is a such that a ∗τα ∈X.
Thus neither I nor II has a winning strategy in the game GX, and hence
GX is not determined.
⊓⊔
In contrast with this lemma, the Axiom of Determinacy implies a weak
form of the Axiom of Choice:
Lemma 33.2. The Axiom of Determinacy implies that every countable fam-
ily of nonempty sets of real numbers has a choice function.
Proof. We prove that if X = {Xn : n ∈ω} is a family of nonempty sub-
sets of N, then there exists f on X such that f(Xn) ∈Xn for all n. Let
us consider the following game: If I plays ⟨a0, a1, a2, . . .⟩and and II plays
⟨b0, b1, b2, . . .⟩, then II wins if and only if b ∈Xa0. It is clear that I does not
have a winning strategy: Once I plays a0, the player II ﬁnds some b ∈Xa0,
plays b = ⟨b0, b1, b2, . . .⟩and wins. Hence II has a winning strategy τ, and we
can deﬁne f on X as follows: f(Xn) = τ ∗⟨n, 0, 0, 0, . . .⟩.
⊓⊔
As we show below, Determinacy has desirable consequences for sets of
reals: AD implies that every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable, has the
Baire property and the perfect set property. Thus it is natural to postulate
that Determinacy holds to the extent it does not contradict the Axiom of
Choice. The appropriate postulate turns out to be that AD holds in the
model L(R), and therefore all sets of reals deﬁnable from a real parameter are
determined. This implies, in particular, that the game GA is determined for
every projective set—Projective Determinacy (PD). It has been established
that both ADL(R) and PD are large cardinal axioms; we shall elaborate on
this later in this chapter.
Throughout the rest of the present chapter we work in ZF+the Principle
of Dependent Choices.

Some Consequences of AD
We shall now prove that under the assumption of Determinacy, sets of real
numbers are well behaved.
Theorem 33.3. Assume the Axiom of Determinacy. Then:
(i) Every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable.
(ii) Every set of reals has the property of Baire.
(iii) Every uncountable set of reals contains a perfect subset.
Proof. (i) It suﬃces to prove the following lemma:
Lemma 33.4. Assuming AD, let S be a set of reals such that every measur-
able Z ⊂S is null. Then S is null.
It is easy to see that Lemma 33.4 implies that every set X is Lebesgue
measurable: Let A ⊃X be a measurable set with the property that every
measurable Z ⊂A−X is null. Then A−X is null and hence X is measurable.
Proof. Thus let S be a set of reals with the property
(33.1)
if Z ⊂S is Lebesgue measurable, then Z is null;
we shall use AD to show that S is null. It is clear that we can restrict ourselves
to subsets of the unit interval; thus assume that S ⊂[0, 1]. In order to show
that S is null, it suﬃces to show that the outer measure µ∗(S) is less than
any ε > 0. Thus let ε be a ﬁxed positive real number.
33.5. The Covering Game. Given S and ε, let us set up a game as follows:
If ⟨a0, a1, a2, . . .⟩is a sequence of 0’s and 1’s, let a be the real number
(33.2)
a =
∞

n=0
an
2n+1 .
For each n ∈ω, let Gn
k, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , be an enumeration of the set Kn of
all sets G such that
(i) G is a union of ﬁnitely many intervals with rational endpoints;
(ii) µ(G) ≤ε/22(n+1).
(33.3)
The rules of the game are that player I tries to play a real number a ∈S,
and player II tries to cover the real a by the union ∞
n=0 Hn such that Hn ∈
Kn for all n. More precisely, a play ⟨a0, b0, a1, b1, . . .⟩is won by player I if
(i) an = 0 or 1, for all n;
(ii) a ∈S; and
(iii) a /∈∞
n=0 Gn
bn.

630
Part III. Selected Topics
We claim that player I does not have a winning strategy in the game. To
show this, notice that if σ is a winning strategy for I, then the function f
that to each b = ⟨b0, b1, b2, . . .⟩∈N assigns the real number a = f(b) such
that ⟨a0, b0, a1, b1, . . .⟩= σ ∗b is continuous and hence the set Z = f(N) is
analytic and hence measurable. Moreover Z ⊂S, and therefore Z is null. Now
a null set can be covered by a countable union ∞
n=0 Hn such that Hn ∈Kn
for all n, and therefore, if II plays ⟨b0, b1, b2, . . .⟩where Gn
bn = Hn and I plays
by σ, then II wins. Thus σ cannot be a winning strategy for I.
Assuming AD, the covering game is determined, and therefore player II
has a winning strategy. Let τ be such a strategy. For each ﬁnite sequence
s = ⟨a0, . . . , an⟩of 0’s and 1’s, let Gs ∈Kn be the set Gn
bn, where ⟨b0, . . . , bn⟩
are the moves that II plays by τ in response to a0, . . . , an. Since τ is a winning
strategy, every a ∈S is in the set {Gs : s ⊂a} and hence
(33.4)
S ⊂{Gs : s ∈Seq({0, 1})} =
∞

n=1

s∈{0,1}n Gs.
Now for every n ≥1, if s ∈{0, 1}n, then µ(Gs) ≤ε/22n and hence
µ

22n · 2n = ε
2n .
It follows that µ(∞
n=1

s∈{0,1}n Gs) ≤∞
n=1 ε/2n = ε and thus µ∗(S) ≤ε.
Since ε > 0 was arbitrary, S is null. This completes the proof.
⊓⊔
(ii) Next we consider the property of Baire:
33.6. The Banach-Mazur Game. Let X be a subset of the Baire space N,
and let us consider the following game: Player I plays a ﬁnite sequence s0 ∈
Seq; then II plays a proper extension t0 ⊃s0; then I plays s1 ⊃t0, etc.:
(33.5)
s0 ⊂t0 ⊂s1 ⊂t1 ⊂. . . .
The sequence (33.5) converges to some x ∈N. If x ∈A, then I wins, and
otherwise II wins.
First we verify that this game can be reformulated as a game GA of
the kind introduced at the beginning of the section (i.e., when the moves
are natural numbers). Let uk, k ∈N, be an enumeration of the set Seq. If
⟨a0, b0, a1, b1, . . .⟩is a sequence of numbers, then consider the sequence
(33.6)
ua0, ub0, ua1, ub1, . . .
and let A be the set of all ⟨a0, b0, a1, b1, . . .⟩∈N such that: Either there is n
such that
ua0 ⊂ub0 ⊂. . . uan ̸⊂ubn
or the sequence (33.6) is increasing and converges to some x ∈X. It is clear
I wins the Banach-Mazur game if and only if I wins the game GA.
Thus if AD holds, the game is determined, for every X ⊂N. We will use
this to show that every X ⊂N has the Baire property.

33. Determinacy

Lemma 33.7. Player II has a winning strategy in the Banach-Mazur game
if and only if X is meager.
Proof. Let Y be the complement of X in N. For each s ∈Seq, O(s) denotes
the basic open set {x ∈N : s ⊂x}.
(a) If X is a meager set, then there exist open dense sets Gn, n ∈N,
such that Y ⊃∞
n=0 Gn. It is easy to ﬁnd a winning strategy τ for II: If
I plays s0, let t0 = τ(⟨s0⟩) be some t0 ⊃s0 such that Ut0 ⊂G0; such t0
exists because G0 is dense. Then if I plays s1 ⊃t0, let t1 = τ(⟨s0, t0, s1⟩)
be some t1 ⊃s1 such that Ut1 ⊂G1, and so on. It is clear that every such
play s0 ⊂t0 ⊂s1 ⊂. . . converges to x ∈∞
n=0 Gn, and hence τ is a winning
strategy for II.
(b) Conversely, assume that II has a winning strategy τ. A correct position
is a ﬁnite sequence ⟨s0, t0, . . . , sn, tn⟩such that s0 ⊂t0 ⊂. . . ⊂tn and
t0 = τ(⟨s0⟩), t1 = τ(⟨s0, t0, s1⟩), etc. We shall ﬁrst prove the following claim:
Let x ∈N and assume that for every correct position p = ⟨s0, . . . , tn⟩with
tn ⊂x there exists s ⊃tn such that τ(p⌢s) ⊂x. Then x ∈Y .
To prove the claim, let x satisfy the condition. To begin, there exists s0
such that τ(⟨s0⟩) ⊂x; let t0 = τ(⟨s0⟩). Then there exists s1 ⊃t0 such that
t1 = τ(⟨s0, t0, s1⟩) ⊂x; then there is s2 ⊃t1 such that τ(⟨s0, t0, s1, t1, s2⟩) ⊂
x; and so on. The sequence s0 ⊂t0 ⊂s1 ⊂t1 ⊂. . . converges to x and is
a play in which II plays by τ. Hence x ∈Y .
For every correct position p = ⟨s0, . . . , tn⟩, let
Fp = {x ∈N : tn ⊂x and (∀s ⊃tn) τ(p⌢s) ̸⊂x}.
By the claim, for every x ∈X there is a correct position p such that x ∈Fp;
in other words,
X ⊂{Fp : p is a correct position}.
It is easy to see that for each p, O(tn) −Fp is on open dense set in O(tn);
hence Fp is a closed nowhere dense set. The number of correct positions is
countable and hence X is meager.
⊓⊔
Corollary 33.8. Let X ⊂N. Player I has a winning strategy in the Banach-
Mazur game if and only if for some s ∈Seq, O(s) −X is meager.
Proof. Note that I has a winning strategy if and only if there exists s ∈Seq
(the ﬁrst move of I) such that player II has a winning strategy in the following
game: I plays t0 ⊃s, II plays s0 ⊃t0, I plays t1 ⊃s0, etc.; and I wins if
t0 ⊂s0 ⊂t1 ⊂. . . converges to x ∈Us −X. By Lemma 33.7, II has a winning
strategy in this game if and only if O(s) −X is meager.
⊓⊔
Now part (ii) of Theorem 33.3 follows. If X ⊂N, then since the Banach-
Mazur game is determined, either X is meager or for some s ∈Seq, O(s)−X
is meager. Thus let X ⊂N be arbitrary. If X is meager, then X has the
Baire property. If X is nonmeager, then let G = {O(s) : O(s) −X is

632
Part III. Selected Topics
meager}. Clearly, G −X is meager, and X −G must be meager too because
otherwise there would exist some s such that O(s)−(X −G) is meager, which
contradicts the deﬁnition of G. It follows that X has the Baire property.
(iii) We will use AD to prove that every uncountable set in the Cantor
space C = {0, 1}ω has a perfect subset. We consider the following game:
33.9. The Perfect Set Game. Let X be a subset of {0, 1}ω. The game is
deﬁned as follows: Player I plays a sequence s0 ∈Seq({0, 1}) of 0’s and 1’s
(possibly the empty sequence), then player II plays n0 ∈{0, 1}, then I plays
s1 ∈Seq({0, 1}), and so on. Let x = s ⌢
0 n ⌢
0 s ⌢
1 n ⌢
1 . . .. Player I wins if x ∈X,
and II wins if x /∈X.
The game can be reformulated as a game GA, for some A ⊂ωω.
Lemma 33.10. Let X ⊂C. If II has a winning strategy in the perfect set
game, then X is countable.
Proof. Let τ be a winning strategy for II. A correct position is a ﬁnite se-
quence ⟨s0, n0, . . . , sk, nk⟩such that n0 = τ(⟨s0⟩), n1 = τ(⟨s0, n0, s1⟩), etc.
By the same argument as in Lemma 33.7, we get the following claim: Let
x ∈{0, 1}ω and assume that for every correct position p = ⟨s0, . . . , nk⟩
if s ⌢
0 n ⌢
0 . . . ⌢nk ⊂x, then there exists an s ∈Seq({0, 1}) such that
s ⌢
0 n ⌢
0 . . . ⌢n ⌢
k s⌢τ(p⌢s) ⊂x. Then x /∈X.
It follows that X ⊂{Fp : p is a correct position}, where
Fp = {x ∈C : s ⌢
0 . . . ⌢nk ⊂x and ∀s (s⌢. . . ⌢n ⌢
k s⌢τ(p⌢s) ̸⊂x)}.
The lemma will follow if we show that each Fp has exactly one element x ∈C.
This element x is uniquely determined as follows (because each x(m) is either
0 or 1); ﬁrst, for some l ∈N, ⟨x(0), . . . , x(l −1)⟩= s ⌢
0 n ⌢
0 . . . ⌢nk; then
x(l) = 1 −τ(p⌢∅), x(l + 1) = 1 −τ(p⌢⟨x(l)⟩), x(l + 2) = 1 −τ(p⌢⟨x(l),
x(l + 1)⟩), and so on.
⊓⊔
Now part (iii) of Theorem 33.3 follows. If X ⊂C is uncountable, then
II does not have a winning strategy; and since the game is determined, I has
a winning strategy σ. For each x = ⟨n0, n1, . . .⟩∈C, let F(x) ∈C denote
the 0–1 sequence
s ⌢
0 n ⌢
0 s ⌢
1 n ⌢
1 . . .
where s0 = σ(∅), s1 = σ(⟨s ⌢
0 n0⟩), s2 = σ(⟨s ⌢
0 n ⌢
0 s ⌢
1 n1⟩), etc. The func-
tion f is continuous and one-to-one, and hence f(C) is a perfect set. But
X ⊃f(C) and hence X has a perfect subset.
⊓⊔
We proved earlier that if ℵ1 = ℵL[a]
1
for some a ⊂ω, then there is an
uncountable set without a perfect subset. Thus we have:
Corollary 33.11. If AD holds, then ℵ1 is inaccessible in L[a], for every
a ⊂ω.
⊓⊔

33. Determinacy

AD and Large Cardinals
To illustrate the relationship between the Axiom of Determinacy and the
theory of large cardinals, we show that AD implies that ℵ1 and ℵ2 are mea-
surable cardinals.
Theorem 33.12 (Solovay). The Axiom of Determinacy implies that:
(i) ℵ1 is a measurable cardinal, and moreover, the closed unbounded ﬁlter
on ℵ1 is an ultraﬁlter.
(ii) ℵ2 is a measurable cardinal.
Proof. (i) We ﬁrst show that AD implies that ω1 is measurable. We already
know that ω1 is inaccessible in every L[a], a ⊂ω.
Let us consider the following partial ordering of the Baire space:
(33.7)
x ≼y
if and only if
x ∈L[y]
and the corresponding equivalence relation
(33.8)
x ≡y
if and only if
x ≼y and y ≼x.
We say that A ⊂N is ≡-closed if (x ∈A and y ≡x) implies y ∈A. Note
that the collection B of all ≡-closed sets in N is a complete Boolean algebra.
If x0 ∈N, then we let
(33.9)
cone(x0) = {x ∈N : x0 ≼x} = {x : x0 ∈L[x]}
and call cone(x0) a cone. Clearly, every cone is ≡-closed. Let
F = {A ∈B : A contains a cone}.
We claim that F is a σ-complete ﬁlter on B. Let A0, A1, . . . , An, . . . be
elements of F. For each n, we choose xn ∈N such that An ⊃cone(xn). Let
x ∈N be deﬁned as follows: x(⟨n, m⟩) = xn(m) for all n, m ∈N (where
⟨⟩is a pairing function). It is clear that for each n, xn ∈L[x] and hence
cone(x) ⊂cone(xn) ⊂An. Thus ∞
n=0 An is in F.
Lemma 33.13. AD implies that for every ≡-closed A ⊂N, either A or its
complement contains a cone. Hence F is a σ-complete ultraﬁlter on B.
Proof. We show that if I has a winning strategy in the game GA, then A con-
tains a cone (and similarly, if II has a winning strategy, then N −A ∈F).
Let σ be a winning strategy for I. It suﬃces to show that A contains the cone
{x ∈N : σ ∈L[x]}.
Let x ∈N be such that σ ∈L[x]. Then a = σ ∗x is in A because σ is
a winning strategy. Clearly, x ∈L[a], and because σ ∈L[x], we also have
a ∈L[x] and hence x ≡a. Since A is ≡-closed, we have x ∈A.
⊓⊔

Now we can use AD to ﬁnd a nonprincipal σ-complete ultraﬁlter U on ω1.
For each x ∈N, let f(x) = ℵL[x]
1
; f(x) is a countable ordinal. Note that if
x ≡y, then f(x) = f(y), and hence for every X ⊂ω1, the set f−1(X) ⊂N
is ≡-closed. Let
U = {X ⊂ω1 : f−1(X) ∈F}.
Since F is a σ-complete ultraﬁlter on B, U is a σ-complete ultraﬁlter on ω1.
It remains to show that U is nonprincipal. But for every α < ω1, if x ∈N
is such that ℵL[x]
1
= α, then there is y ≽x such that ℵL[y]
1
> α; and hence
f−1({α}) /∈F.
Thus AD implies that ω1 is a measurable cardinal.
Lemma 33.14. Assume AD. Then for every S ⊂ω1, the set {x ∈WO :
∥x∥∈S} is Π1
1. Consequently, there is some a ⊂ω such that S ∈L[a].
Proof. If x ∈N, then for each n ∈N we let xn ∈N be such that xn(m) =
x(⟨n, m⟩) for all m ∈N. We consider the following game:
33.15. The Solovay Game. Let S ⊂ω1. Player I plays a = ⟨a(0), a(1), . . .⟩,
and II plays b = ⟨b(0), b(1), . . .⟩. If a /∈WO, then II wins; if a ∈WO, then
II wins if
{α ∈S : α ≤∥a∥} ⊂{∥bn∥: n ∈ω} ⊂S.
We claim that I does not have a winning strategy in the Solovay game.
Let σ be a winning strategy for I; for each b ∈N, let f(b) be the a ∈N such
that ⟨a(0), b(0), a(1), b(1), . . .⟩= σ ∗b. The set f(N) is a Σ1
1 subset of WO,
and by the Boundedness Lemma, there is an α < ω1 such that ∥f(b)∥< α
for all b ∈N. Hence let b ∈N be such that {∥bn∥: n ∈ω} = S ∩α. Then
σ ∗b is a play won by player II, and hence σ cannot be a winning strategy
for I.
Now the lemma follows: Let S ⊂ω1. By AD, player II has a winning
strategy τ in the Solovay game. For each a, let g(a) be the b ∈N such that
⟨a(0), b(0), . . .⟩= a ∗τ. It follows that for each a ∈WO,
∥a∥∈S
if and only if
∃n ∥a∥= ∥(g(a))n∥
and consequently the set {x ∈WO : ∥x∥∈S} is Π1
1. By Lemma 25.22,
S ∈L[a] for some a ⊂ω.
⊓⊔
We can now complete the proof of (i). If X ⊂ω1, then X ∈L[a] for some
a ⊂ω. Since ℵ1 is a measurable cardinal, a♯exists, and it follows that either
X or ω1−X contains a closed unbounded subset. Thus the closed unbounded
ﬁlter on ω1 is an ultraﬁlter.
By the Countable Axiom of Choice, the closed unbounded ﬁlter is σ-
complete, and we therefore conclude (as we work in ZF + the Principle of
Dependent Choices) that AD implies that the closed unbounded ﬁlter on ω1
is the unique σ-complete normal ultraﬁlter on ω1.

33. Determinacy
635
(ii) We shall now show that, assuming AD, ℵ2 is a measurable cardinal.
For each x ∈N, let f(x) denote the successor cardinal of the (real) cardinal ℵ1
in L[x]:
f(x) = ((ℵ1)+)L[x].
If x ⊂ω, then because x♯exists, f(x) is an ordinal less than ℵ2. Moreover,
if x ≡y, then f(x) = f(y), and hence f−1(X) is ≡-closed for each X ⊂ω2.
Thus let us deﬁne an ultraﬁlter U on ω2 as follows:
U = {X ⊂ω2 : f−1(X) ∈F}.
We wish to show that U is an ℵ2-complete nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on ω2.
Since F is σ-complete, U is σ-complete. It is also easy to see that U is
nonprincipal: If α < ω2 and f(x) = α, then there exists an S ⊂ω1 such that
α is not a cardinal in L[S]; then by Lemma 33.14 there is a y ∈N such that
x ∈L[y] and f(y) > α. Hence f−1({α}) does not contain a cone.
It remains to show that U is ℵ2-complete. Since U is σ-complete, it suﬃces
to show that if
(33.10)
X0 ⊃X1 ⊃. . . ⊃Xα ⊃. . .
(α < ω1)
is a descending sequence of subsets of ω2 such that each f−1(X) contains
a cone then f−1(
α<ω1 Xα) contains a cone.
Let us consider such a sequence (33.10), and let X = 
α<ω1 Xα. We
shall use the following game: Player I plays a = ⟨a(0), a(1), . . .⟩, and II plays
b = ⟨b(0), b(1), . . .⟩. If a /∈WO, then I loses; if a ∈WO and ∥a∥= α, then
II wins if cone(b) ⊂f−1(Xα).
We claim that I does not have a winning strategy in this game: If σ is
a winning strategy for I, then the set of all a ∈N that I plays by σ against
all possible b ∈N, is a Σ1
1 subset of WO and hence there is α such that
∥a∥< α for all these a’s. Now II can beat I simply by playing some b ∈N
such that cone(b) ⊂f−1(Xα).
Thus II has a winning strategy τ, and we intend to show that f−1(X) con-
tains the cone {x ∈N : τ ∈L[x]}. Let α < ω1 and let x ∈N be such that
τ ∈L[x]; we want to show that f(x) ∈Xα.
Let Pα be the notion of forcing that collapses α onto ω: The conditions
are ﬁnite sequences of ordinals less than α. Since ℵ1 is inaccessible in L[x],
L[x] has only countably many subsets of Pα, and therefore there exists an
L[x]-generic ﬁlter G on Pα. Let a ∈WO be such that ∥a∥= α and let
L[a] = L[G] and let y ∈N be such that L[y] = L[x][G] = L[x][a].
Since G is generic on Pα over L[x], all cardinals in L[x] greater than α
are preserved in L[x][G]. In particular, (ℵ+
1 )L[x] is preserved and hence
f(y) = f(x).
Now if I plays a = ⟨a(0), a(1), . . .⟩and if II plays against a by his winning
strategy τ, II produces b = ⟨b(0), b(1), . . .⟩such that cone(b) ⊂f−1(Xα). But
since b ∈L[τ, a] and τ ∈L[x], we have b ∈L[x, a] = L[y] and therefore

636
Part III. Selected Topics
y ∈cone(b). It follows that f(y) ∈Xα; and because f(x) = f(y), we have
f(x) ∈Xα, as we wanted to prove.
This completes the proof of Theorem 33.12.
⊓⊔
It turns out that under Determinacy there exist many measurable cardi-
nals. Of particular interest have been the projective ordinals δ1
n. By deﬁnition
δ1
n = sup{ξ : ξ is the length of a ∆1
n prewellordering of N}.
By the results in Chapter 25, δ1
1 = ω1 and δ1
2 ≤ω2. It has been estab-
lished (under AD) that all the δ1
n are measurable cardinals, along with other
properties, such as δ1
2n+2 = (δ1
2n+1)+. The size of each δ1
2n+1 has now been
calculated exactly; in particular, δ1
3 = ℵω+1 and δ1
5 = ℵωωω +1. The analy-
sis of the δ1
n’s depends heavily on calculations of length of ultrapowers by
measures on projective ordinals.
An important ordinal (isolated by Moschovakis) is
Θ = sup{ξ : ξ is the length of a prewellordering of N}.
AD implies that Θ = ℵΘ, and if in addition V = L(R) then Θ is a regular car-
dinal (Solovay). Θ is the limit of measurable cardinals (Kechris and Woodin),
and for every λ < Θ, there exists a normal ultraﬁlter on [λ]ω (Solovay). As
for the consistency strength of AD, we have:
Theorem 33.16 (Woodin). Assume AD and V = L(R). Then there exists
an inner model with inﬁnitely many Woodin cardinals.
⊓⊔
Theorem 33.16 is optimal, as the existence of inﬁnitely many Woodin
cardinals is equiconsistent with AD; see Theorem 33.26. (We remark that
the proof of Theorem 33.16 uses the following result: If AD and V = L(R),
then Θ is a Woodin cardinal in the model HOD.)
Projective Determinacy
In this section we address the question how strong is the determinacy as-
sumption when restricted to games that have a simple enough deﬁnition. In
particular, we turn our attention to the game GA where A ⊂N is a projective
set.
When A is open (or closed) then GA is determined:
Lemma 33.17. If A ⊂N is an open set, then GA is determined.
Proof. Player I plays ⟨a0, a1, . . .⟩, player II plays ⟨b0, b1, . . .⟩, and I wins if
⟨a0, b0, a1, b1, . . .⟩∈A. Let us assume that player I does not have a winning
strategy, and let us show that II has a winning strategy. The strategy for II is
as follows: When I plays a0, then because I does not have a winning strategy,

33. Determinacy
637
there exists b0 such the position ⟨a0, b0⟩is not yet lost for II. That is, I does
not have a winning strategy in the game G⟨a0,b0⟩
A
that starts at ⟨a0, b0⟩, in
which I plays ⟨a1, a2, . . .⟩and II plays ⟨b1, b2, . . .⟩, and in which I wins when
⟨a0, b0, a1, b1, . . .⟩∈A.
Let II plays such b0. When I plays a1, then again, because II is not yet
lost at ⟨a0, b0⟩, there exists b1 such that II is not yet lost at ⟨a0, b0, a1, b1⟩.
Let II play such b1. And so on. We claim that this strategy for II is a winning
strategy.
Let x = ⟨a0, b0, a1, b1, . . .⟩be a play which II plays by the above strategy;
We want to show that x /∈A. If x ∈A, then because A is open, there is
s = ⟨a0, b0, . . . , an, bn⟩⊂x such that O(s) ⊂A. But then it is clear that II is
lost at s; a contradiction.
⊓⊔
The same argument (interchanging the players) would show that every
closed game is determined. Or, we can show that every closed game is deter-
mined as follows: If A is closed, then I has a winning strategy in GA if and
only if there is a0 ∈N such that II does not have a winning strategy in the
open game Ga0
A in which II make a ﬁrst move b0, then I plays a1, etc., and
II wins if ⟨a0, b0, a1, b1, . . .⟩is in the open set N −A. Since Ga0
A is determined
for all a0 ∈N, GA is determined.
One of the major results in descriptive set theory is Martin’s proof that
for every Borel set A the game GA is determined:
Theorem 33.18 (Martin [1975]). All Borel games are determined.
⊓⊔
We shall not give a proof. It can be found either in Martin’s paper [1975],
or in the survey article [1980] by Kechris and Martin; furthermore, Martin
gives a simpliﬁcation of his proof in [1985].
Analytic Determinacy, i.e., determinacy of all analytic games, is already
a large cardinal assumption:
Theorem 33.19. Let a ∈N. Every Σ1
1(a) game is determined if and only
if a♯exists.
Thus Analytic Determinacy is equivalent to the statement
(33.11)
a♯exists for all a ∈N.
The proof of Analytic Determinacy from (33.11) is due to Martin [1969/70].
The necessity of (33.11) is a result of Harrington [1978]. We omit Harrington’s
proof and prove a corollary of Martin’s result. We note however that the proof
of the corollary can be converted into a proof of the “if” part of Theorem 33.19
without much diﬃculty.
Corollary 33.20. If there exists a measurable cardinal, then all analytic
games are determined.

638
Part III. Selected Topics
Proof. Let κ be a measurable cardinal and let A ⊂N be an analytic set. We
want to show that the game GA is determined.
Let us use the tree representation of analytic sets. There is a tree T ⊂Seq2
such that for all x ∈N,
x ∈A ↔T (x) is ill-founded.
Let ≼be the linear ordering of the set Seq that extends the partial ordering ⊃:
If s, t ∈Seq, then s ≼t either if s ⊃t, or if s and t are incompatible, and
s(n) < t(n) where n is the least n such that s(n) ̸= t(n). Thus
x ∈A ↔T (x) is not well-ordered by ≼.
We also recall that T (x) = {t : (x↾n, t) ∈T for some n} and that the ﬁrst
n levels of T (x) depend only on x↾n. For s ∈Seq, we let Ts = {t : (u, t) ∈T
for some u ⊂s}; then Tx↾n is exactly the ﬁrst n levels of the tree T (x).
We need some further notation. Let t0, t1, . . . , tn, . . . be an enumeration of
the set Seq. If s ∈Seq is a sequence of length 2n, let Ks be the ﬁnite set
{t0, . . . , tn−1} ∩Ts and let ks = |Ks|.
We shall now deﬁne an auxiliary game G∗: Player I plays natural numbers
a0, a1, a2, . . . , and player II plays pairs (b0, h0), (b1, h1), (b2, h2), . . . where
b0, b1, b2, . . . are natural numbers, and for each n, hn is an order-preserving
mapping from (Ks, ≼) into κ where s = ⟨a0, b0, . . . , an, bn⟩such that h0 ⊂
h1 ⊂h2 ⊂. . . ⊂hn ⊂. . .. If player II is able to follow these rules throughout
the game, then he wins. Otherwise, I wins.
It is clear that the game G∗is determined: If I does not have a winning
strategy, then he cannot prevent II from following the rules and thus II has
a winning strategy, namely his each move is to reach a position in which
I does not have a winning strategy. (The argument is the same as in the
proof of determinacy of open games; in fact, G∗is an open game in a suitable
topology.)
If II wins a play in the game G∗, then he has constructed an order-
preserving mapping h = ∞
n=0 hn of (T (x), ≼) into κ, where x = ⟨a0, b0,
a1, b1, . . .⟩; hence ≼well-orders T (x) and so x /∈A. Thus we can view the
game G∗as a variant of GA, but more diﬃcult for player II: II tries to make
sure that x /∈A, and in addition, he tries to construct an embedding of
(T (x), ≼) in κ. Hence it is fairly obvious that if II has a winning strategy
in the game G∗, then II has a winning strategy in GA: If τ ∗is a winning
strategy for II in G∗, let τ be as follows. When I plays a0, let τ(⟨a0⟩) = b0
where (b0, h0) = τ ∗(⟨a0⟩); then when I plays a1, let τ(⟨a0, b0, a1⟩) = b1 where
(b1, h1) = τ ∗(⟨a0, (b0, h0), a1⟩); etc.
Since G∗is determined, it suﬃces to prove the following lemma in order
to show that GA is determined:
Lemma 33.21. If I has a winning strategy in G∗, then I has a winning
strategy in GA.

33. Determinacy
639
Proof. Let σ∗be a winning strategy for I in G∗. After 2n+2 moves, the players
have produced a sequence s = ⟨a0, b0, . . . , an, bn⟩, and II has constructed
order-preserving functions h0 ⊂. . . ⊂hn; the strategy σ∗then tells player I
what to play next. Let E be the range of hn; E is a ﬁnite subset of κ, and
in fact its size is ks. We observe that there is one and only one way II could
have constructed h0, . . . , hn so that ran(hn) = E; the reason is that hn is
the unique order-preserving one-to-one function between (Ks, ≼) and E. Thus
σ∗depends (as long as II plays correctly) only on s ∈Seq and the ﬁnite set
E ⊂κ.
For each s ∈Seq of even length, let Fs be the following function from [κ]ks
into ω:
(33.12)
Fs(E) = σ∗(s, E).
Each Fs is a partition of [κ]ks into ω pieces; and because κ is measurable,
there exists a set H ⊂κ of size κ homogeneous for each Fs. Let us denote
by σ(s) the unique value of Fs(E) for E ∈[H]ks.
We shall complete the proof by showing that σ is a winning strategy for I
in the game GA. Let x = ⟨a0, b0, a1, b1, . . .⟩be a play in which I plays by σ.
We shall show that x ∈A.
Assume that on the contrary, x /∈A. Then (T (x), ≼) is well-ordered and
has order-type < ω1. Since H is uncountable, there exists an embedding h of
(T (x), ≼) into H. Let us consider the following play of the game G∗: I plays a0.
Then II plays (b0, h0) where h0 is the restriction of h to K⟨a0,b0⟩. Then
I plays a1 and II plays (b1, h1) where h1 is the restriction of h to K⟨a0,b0,a1,b1⟩.
And so on.
We show that in this play, player I plays by the strategy σ∗. Clearly,
a0 = σ(∅) = σ∗(∅, ∅). Then a1 = σ(⟨a0, b0⟩), and by the deﬁnition of σ it
is clear that σ(⟨a0, b0⟩) = σ∗(⟨a0, b0⟩, h(K⟨a0,b0⟩)) and therefore a1 is a move
according to σ∗. And so on: All the moves a0, a1, . . . , an, . . . are by σ∗.
This is a contradiction because σ∗is a winning strategy for I in G∗, but
the play we described is won by player II. It follows that x ∈A and hence
σ is a winning strategy for I in the game GA.
⊓⊔
This completes the proof of Σ1
1 Determinacy assuming a measurable car-
dinal. This assumption can be weakened to the assumption that a♯exists for
all a ⊂ω. The above proof is then modiﬁed as follows: We play the auxiliary
game as before; κ is an uncountable cardinal. The deﬁnition of the auxiliary
game is absolute for the model L[T ], and it follows that either I or II has
a winning strategy for G∗, which si in L[T ]. In particular, in Lemma 33.21, we
may take σ∗∈L[T ]. Then the collection {Fs : s ∈Seq}, where Fs is deﬁned
by (33.12), is in L[T ], and an indiscernibility argument shows that there is
an uncountable set H ⊂κ of indiscernibles for L[T ] such that each Fs has
the same value for all E ∈[H]ks. The rest of the proof is the same.
Determinacy of all projective games is considerably stronger than Ana-
lytic Determinacy: ∆1

cardinal, and for every n, ∆1
n+1 Determinacy yields an inner model with
n Woodin cardinals.
The proof of Theorem 33.3 shows that Projective Determinacy implies
that every projective set of reals is Lebesgue measurable, has the Baire prop-
erty, and if uncountable, contains a perfect subset. The most important con-
sequence of PD for the structure of projective sets of reals is the existence of
scales. The following is a generalization of (25.28) and (25.34):
Deﬁnition 33.22. A Π1
n-norm on a Π1
n set A is a norm ϕ on A with the
property that there exist a Π1
n relation P(x, y) and a Σ1
n relation Q(x, y) such
that for every y ∈A and all x,
x ∈A and ϕ(x) ≤ϕ(y) ↔P(x, y) ↔Q(x, y).
A Σ1
n-norm on a Σ1
n set A is deﬁned similarly, as is a Π1
n-scale on a Π1
n set
(or a Σ1
n-scale on a Σ1
n set).
We say that the class Π1
n has the prewellordering property (the scale prop-
erty) if every Π1
n set has a Π1
n-norm (a Π1
n-scale). Π1
n has the uniformization
property if every Π1
n relation on N × N is uniformized by a Π1
n function.
Similarly for Σ1
n.
Theorem 33.23 (Moschovakis [1971]). Assume Projective Determinacy.
Then the following classes have the scale property (for every a ∈N):
Π1
1(a), Σ1
2(a), Π1
3(a), Σ1
4(a), . . . , Π1
2n+1(a), Σ1
2n+2(a), . . . .
Corollary 33.24. Assume PD. The classes Π1
2n+1(a) and Σ1
2n+2(a) have
the prewellordering property and the uniformization property and satisfy the
reduction principle; the classes Σ1
2n+1(a) and Π1
2n+2(a) satisfy the separation
principle.
The scale property generalizes the prewellordering property, and implies
uniformization (using the proof of Kondˆo’s Theorem 25.26; cf. Exercise 33.4).
The prewellordering property implies the reduction principle (as in Exer-
cise 25.7; see Exercise 33.5), which in turn implies the separation principle
for the dual class (cf. Exercise 25.9).
Moreover, since reduction holds for Π1
2n+1 and Σ1
2n+2, separation fails
for these classes (see Exercise 25.11 and Exercise 33.6). Hence reduction,
prewellordering and scale properties fail for the dual classes Σ1
1, Π1
2, Σ1
3, . . . .
Instead of proving Theorem 33.23 we shall prove the weaker statement:
Assuming PD, every Π1
2n+1 and every Σ1
2n+2 have the prewellordering prop-
erty. The full result is proved by a similar, somewhat more complicated,
method.
In Chapter 25 we proved that every Π1
1 set has a Π1
1-norm and that every
Σ1
2 set has a Σ1
2-norm. The latter statement is easily derived from the former
(Exercise 25.6). The same proof shows that if Π1
2n+1 has the prewellordering
property then so does Σ1
2n+2 (Exercise 33.7). Thus it suﬃces to prove the
following:

33. Determinacy
641
Lemma 33.25. Assume that every ∆1
2n game is determined, and that every
Σ1
2n set has a Σ1
2n-norm. Then every Π1
2n+1 set has a Π1
2n+1-norm.
Proof. Assume that the hypotheses hold and let B be a Π1
2n+1 set
x ∈B ↔∀u (x, u) ∈A
where A is Σ1
2n. Let ψ be a Σ1
2n-norm on A. For x, y ∈N consider the game
G(x, y) where I plays a(0), a(1), . . . , a(k), . . . and II plays b(0), b(1), . . . ,
b(k), . . . and II wins if (y, b) /∈A, or (x, a) ∈A and ψ(x, a) ≤ψ(y, b). The
game G(x, y) is determined: If y /∈B then II can win by playing b such that
(y, b) /∈A; if y ∈B then
II wins G(x, y) ↔P(x, a, y, b) ↔Q(x, a, y, b)
and so the payoﬀset is ∆1
2n and hence determined.
For x, y ∈B, deﬁne
x ≼y ↔II has a winning strategy in G(x, y).
We will show that ≼is a prewellordering of B and the corresponding norm
is a Π1
2n+1-norm.
Clearly, x ≼x for every x ∈B (II wins by copying I’s moves).
To check that ≼is transitive, let x ≼y and y ≼z. Thus II has winning
strategies both in G(x, y) and G(y, z). We describe a winning strategy for II
in G(x, z): Let k ≥0. When I plays a(k) in G(x, z), consider this the kth move
in G(x, y) and apply the strategy in G(x, y) to respond b(k). Consider b(k)
to be the kth move of I in G(y, z) and apply the strategy in G(y, z) to
respond c(k). This c(k) is then the kth move of II in G(x, z). It is clear that
II wins.
Now assume that x, y ∈B and x ̸≼y. Then I has a winning strat-
egy in G(x, y) (because II does not); we describe a winning strategy for II
in G(y, x) so that y ≼x: Let k ≥0. When I plays a(k) in G(y, x), let b(k)
be the move by I’s winning strategy in G(x, y) (responding to II’s a(k −1)).
Let II play b(k) in G(y, x). As I wins in G(x, y), we have ψ(x, a) > ψ(y, b),
and so II wins.
To verify that ≼is well-founded, we assume to the contrary that x0 ≻x1 ≻
. . . ≻xn ≻. . . is a descending chain, that I has a winning strategy in each of
the games G(xi, xi+1). Let a0(0), a1(0), . . . , ai(0), . . . be the ﬁrst moves of I
by the winning strategies in the games G(xi, xi+1), and for each k ≥1, let
a0(k), a1(k), . . . , ai(k), . . . be I’s moves responding to a1(k −1), a2(k −1),
. . . , ai+1(k −1), . . . II’s moves in these games. Since I wins all these games,
we have ψ(x0, a0) > ψ(x1, a1) > . . . > ψ(xi, ai) > . . ., a contradiction.
Finally, for every y ∈B,
x ∈B and x ≼y ↔∃τ ∀a (x, a) ≤ψ (y, a ∗τ) ↔∀σ ∃b (x, σ ∗b) ≤ψ (y, b)
(where σ and τ denote strategies for I and II) and since ψ is a Σ1
2n-norm
on A, it follows that the norm associated with ≼is a Π1
2n+1-norm on B.

Consistency of AD
The following theorem conﬁrms what has been expected since the early
1970’s: Determinacy is a large cardinal axiom:
Theorem 33.26 (Martin-Steel-Woodin). If there exist inﬁnitely many
Woodin cardinals and a measurable cardinal above them, then the Axiom of
Determinacy holds in L(R).
⊓⊔
In the rest of this chapter we shall outline some ideas on which this result
is based. But ﬁrst we state two related results:
Theorem 33.27 (Woodin). The following are equiconsistent:
(i) ZFC + “There exist inﬁnitely many Woodin cardinals.”
(ii) ZF + AD.
⊓⊔
Theorem 33.28 (Martin-Steel). Let n ∈N. If there exist n Woodin car-
dinals with a measurable cardinal above them then every Π1
n+1 game is de-
termined.
⊓⊔
The crucial concept in these proofs is that of a homogeneous tree.
Following the terminology and notation of Chapter 25, and speciﬁcally
Deﬁnition 25.8, let K be a set and let T be a tree on ω × K (or more
generally, on ωr × K). For s ∈Seq let
(33.13)
Ts = {t : (s, t) ∈T }.
In the present context, a measure is a σ-complete ultraﬁlter, not necessarily
nonprincipal.
Deﬁnition 33.29. A tree T on ω × K is homogeneous if there are measures
µs, s ∈Seq, such that µs is a measure on Ts and:
(i) If t extends s then πs,t(µt) = µs where πs,t is the natural projection
map from Tt to Ts.
(ii) If x ∈p[T ] then the direct limit of the ultrapowers by {µx↾n : n ∈ω}
is well-founded.
(See Exercise 33.8 for an explicit formulation of (ii).)
A tree T is κ-homogeneous (where κ is a regular uncountable cardinal) if
the measures µs are all κ-complete. A set A ⊂N is (κ-)homogeneously Suslin
if A = p[T ] for some (κ-)homogeneous tree T .
Homogeneous trees are an abstraction of Martin’s proof of Π1
1 Determi-
nacy from a measurable cardinal. First, an analysis of Martin’s proof shows
the following:
Lemma 33.30. If A ⊂N is Π1
1 and κ is a measurable cardinal then A is
κ-homogeneously Suslin.

33. Determinacy
643
Proof. Exercise 33.10.
⊓⊔
Martin’s proof essentially uses this (Exercise 33.11):
Lemma 33.31. If A ⊂N is homogeneously Suslin then A is determined.
⊓⊔
A related concept is a weakly homogeneous tree:
Deﬁnition 33.32. A tree T on ω × K is weakly homogeneous if there are
measures µs,t, where s, t ∈Seq and length(s) = length(t), such that µs,t is
a measure on Ts and
(i) If ¯s ⊃s and ¯t ⊃t then πs,¯s(µ¯s,¯t) = µs,t.
(ii) If x ∈p[T ] then there exists a y ∈N such that the direct limit of the
ultrapowers by {µx↾n,y↾n : n ∈ω} is well-founded.
A tree T is κ-weakly homogeneous if the µs,t are κ-complete. A set A is
(κ-)weakly homogeneously Suslin if A = p[T ] for some (κ-)weakly homoge-
neous tree T .
It is not diﬃcult to show that a set A ⊂N is κ-weakly homogeneously
Suslin if and only if it is a projection of a homogeneously Suslin set B ⊂N ×N
(Exercises 33.12 and 33.13).
Theorem 33.26 follows, via Lemma 33.31, from the following two deep
results:
Theorem 33.33 (Woodin [1988]). If there exist inﬁnitely many Woodin
cardinals with a measurable cardinal above, then every subset of N in L(R)
is δ+-weakly homogeneously Suslin, for some Woodin cardinal δ.
⊓⊔
Theorem 33.34 (Martin and Steel [1988]). If A ⊂N is δ+-weakly ho-
mogeneously Suslin, where δ is a Woodin cardinal, then N −A is homoge-
neously Suslin.
⊓⊔
We shall return to Theorem 33.33 in a later chapter. As for Theorem 33.34,
assume that A = p[T ] where T is weakly homogeneous. Then one constructs
a tree ˜T such that N −A = p[ ˜T] in a manner similar to the tree representation
for Π1
2 sets in Theorem 32.14. The heart of the argument in Martin-Steel’s
proof is to show that ˜T is a homogeneous tree.

Historical Notes
Inﬁnite games were ﬁrst considered in the 1930. Mazur described an inﬁnite game
and conjectured its connection to Baire category, which was then proved by Banach.
In [1953] Gale and Stewart investigated inﬁnite games in general and proved
that the Axiom of Choice implies that there exist undetermined games and that
open games are determined.
In [1962] Mycielski and Steinhaus proposed an axiom and called it the Axiom of
Determinateness (AD). In [1963/64, 1966] Mycielski gave a comprehensive account
of consequences of AD and related open problems.
Theorem 33.3(i) is due to Mycielski and ´Swierczkowski [1964]; the present proof
(and the covering game) is due to Harrington. Theorem 33.3(iii) is due to Morton
Davis [1964].

33. Determinacy
645
Following Solovay’s discovery that AD implies that ℵ1 is a measurable cardinal,
attention has been turned to the relation between Determinacy and large cardinals.
There have been numerous results in this direction, and a vast of literature exists
on the subject. The reader can ﬁnd an excellent account of current research on AD
in Kanamori’s book [1994]; a comprehensive treatment of the subject is expected
to appear in the near future (Woodin et al. [∞]).
Theorem 33.12 is due to Solovay; the present proof of measurability of ℵ1
(Lemma 33.13) is due to Martin [1968].
Projective ordinals δ1
n as well as the cardinal Θ were introduced by Moschovakis
[1970] and studied extensively by Kechris [1974, 1978]. The calculation of the size
of the δ1
5 was accomplished by Steve Jackson, cf. [1988, 1999]. For the results on Θ,
see e.g. Kechris [1985].
Theorem 33.18 (Borel Determinacy) is due to Martin [1975]; see also Mar-
tin [1985] and Kechris and Martin [1980].
Theorem 33.19: In [1969/70], Martin proved that analytic games are determined
if a♯exists for all a ∈N; the converse was proved by Harrington in [1978].
Moschovakis’ Theorem 33.23, cf. [1971], is the culmination of applications of
Projective Determinacy to classical descriptive set theory: among others, see Black-
well [1967], Addison and Moschovakis [1968] and Martin [1968]. For a comprehensive
survey, see Kechris and Moschovakis [1978].
Consistency of AD follows from the results of Martin, Steel and Woodin, cf. Mar-
tin and Steel [1988, 1989] and Woodin [1988].
Homogeneous trees are implicit in Martin and Solovay [1969] and in Mar-
tin [1969/70]. They were explicitly isolated by Kechris [1981]. Weakly homogeneous
trees ﬁgured prominently in Woodin [1988].

34. Supercompact Cardinals and the Real Line
In this chapter we present results showing the eﬀect of very large cardinals
(such as supercompact) on the structure of sets of real numbers. In earlier
chapters we showed that if ℵ1 is inaccessible in every L[x] (where x ∈R)
then all Σ1
2 sets of reals are Lebesgue measurable, have the Baire property,
and the perfect set property. If x♯exists for all x ∈R then every Π1
1 game is
determined. Thus already the existence of moderately large cardinals (such as
measurable) has an eﬀect on regularity of projective sets (but recall that—by
Silver’s Theorem 32.20—measurability is still weak to inﬂuence Σ1
3 sets, as
measurable cardinals are consistent with a Σ1
3 well-ordering of R). It follows
from the results presented below that if a supercompact cardinal exists, then
all sets of reals in L(R) have the regularity properties mentioned above.
Woodin Cardinals
As we mentioned in the last chapter (Theorem 33.27), the consistency
strength of Determinacy is below a supercompact cardinal; the appropri-
ate large cardinal concept (a Woodin cardinal) was isolated in the course of
investigations leading to the proof of AD. Let us elaborate on the deﬁnition
(Deﬁnition 20.31) of Woodin cardinals: Let κ and λ ≥κ be cardinals, and
let A be an arbitrary set. We say that κ is λ-strong for A if there exists an
elementary embedding j : V →M with critical point κ such that
(i) j(κ) > λ,
(ii) Vλ ⊂M,
(iii) A ∩Vλ = j(A) ∩Vλ.
(34.1)
Hence κ is λ-strong if it is λ-strong for ∅, and by deﬁnition, δ is a Woodin
cardinal if for every A ⊂Vδ there are arbitrarily large κ < δ that are λ-strong
for A for all λ < δ. We now present a diﬀerent deﬁnition of Woodin cardinals
and show that it is equivalent to Deﬁnition 20.31.
Deﬁnition 34.1. A cardinal δ is a Woodin cardinal if for every function
f : δ →δ there exists a κ < δ with f“κ ⊂κ, and an elementary embedding
j : V →M with critical point κ such that Vj(f)(α) ⊂M.

Every supercompact cardinal is Woodin, and is a limit of Woodin car-
dinals (Exercise 34.1). An immediate consequence of Deﬁnition 34.1 is that
every Woodin cardinal is a Mahlo cardinal, and in fact has a stationary set
of measurable cardinals. The following lemma proves the equivalence of Def-
initions 20.31 and 34.1:
Lemma 34.2. The following are equivalent:
(i) For every A ⊂Vδ there exists a κ < δ that is λ-strong for A for all
λ < δ.
(ii) For every A ⊂Vδ the set of all κ < δ that are λ-strong for A for all
λ < δ is stationary.
(iii) For every f : δ →δ there exists a κ < δ with f“κ ⊂κ, and an
elementary embedding j : V →M with critical point κ such that
Vj(f)(α) ⊂M.
(iv) For every f : δ →δ there exists a κ < δ with f“κ ⊂κ, and an
extender E ∈Vκ with critical point κ such that jE(f)(κ) = f(κ) and
Vf(κ) ⊂UltE.
Proof. It suﬃces to show that (i) implies (iv) and that (iii) implies (ii).
Assume that (i) holds, and let f : δ →δ. By (i) there exists a κ < δ that
is λ-strong for A for all λ < δ. Let λ < δ be suﬃciently large, and let E be an
extender with critical point κ such that Vf(κ) ⊂UltE and f ∩Vλ = jE(f)∩Vλ;
such an extender exists in Vδ. Clearly, f“κ ⊂κ, and since λ is suﬃciently
large, we have jE(f)(κ) = f(κ). Therefore (iv) holds.
Now assume that (iii) holds; let A ⊂Vδ and let C ⊂δ be a closed
unbounded set. To prove (ii) we need a κ ∈C that is λ-strong for A for all
λ < δ. For each α < δ let f(α) be a limit ordinal β ∈C such that if there
exists a λ < δ such that α is not λ-strong for A, then such a λ exists below β.
By (iii) there exists some κ < δ with f“κ ⊂κ, and an elementary j : V →M
with critical point κ such that Vj(f)(κ) ⊂M. Since f“κ ⊂κ, C ∩κ is closed
unbounded in κ and hence κ ∈j(C). By elementarity it suﬃces to show that
(34.2)
M ⊨κ is λ-strong for j(A) for all λ < j(δ).
Assume that (34.2) fails, and let λ be the least λ such that in M, κ is not
λ-strong for j(A). By deﬁnition of f we have λ < j(f)(κ). Let E be the
(κ, λ)-extender derived from j. It is routine to verify that Vλ ⊂UltE and
since UltE = {(jf)(a) : f ∈V , a ∈Vλ} ⊂M, it follows that E ∈M. In M,
E is a (κ, λ)-extender, and V M
λ
= Vλ ⊂UltE(M).
We complete the proof by showing that
(34.3)
j(A) ∩V M
λ
= jM
E (j(A)) ∩V M
λ .
Each of the following equalities is easily veriﬁed: j(A) ∩V M
j(κ) = j(A ∩Vκ) =
jE(A ∩Vκ) = jM
E (A ∩Vκ) = jM
E (j(A) ∩Vκ) = jM
E (j(A)) ∩jM
E (Vκ), and
(34.3) holds because λ < jM
E (κ) and V M
λ
= Vλ ⊂UltM
E . Therefore (ii) holds.
⊓⊔

34. Supercompact Cardinals and the Real Line

Property (iv) in Lemma 34.2 is Π1
1 over Vδ and so the least Woodin
cardinal is Π1
1-describable and therefore not weakly compact.
Semiproper Forcing
A property of forcing somewhat weaker than properness, called semiproper-
ness, have been of considerable use in the theory of large cardinals. We shall
investigate it in some detail in Chapter 37; at this point we introduce semi-
proper forcing, prove basic properties and use it in an application involv-
ing L(R) and supercompact cardinals.
Modifying condition (ii) in Lemma 31.6 and the characterization of
properness in Theorem 31.7 we obtain the following: Let P be a notion of
forcing and let λ be suﬃciently large. Let M be a countable elementary sub-
model of (Hλ, ∈, <). A condition q is (M, P)-semigeneric if for every name
˙α ∈M such that ⊩˙α is a countable ordinal,
(34.4)
q ⊩∃β ∈M ˙α = β.
Deﬁnition 34.3. A notion of forcing P is semiproper if for every suﬃciently
large λ there is a closed unbounded set in [Hλ]ω of countable elementary
submodels such that
∀p ∈M ∃q ≤p q is (M, P)-semigeneric.
Thus semiproperness is a weaker property than properness: Deﬁnition 34.3
is obtained by replacing arbitrary ordinal names in Lemma 31.6 by names
for countable ordinals. While the condition in Theorem 31.7 is equivalent to
preservation of stationary sets in [λ]ω, only the second part of the proof of
Theorem 31.7 remains valid for semiproper forcing, and we get:
Theorem 34.4. If P is semiproper then every stationary set S ⊂ω1 remains
stationary in V P .
⊓⊔
If P is semiproper and ˙Q is semiproper in V P , then P ∗˙Q is semiproper.
Semiproperness is generally not preserved under countable support iteration;
the proof of Theorem 31.15 does not generalize to iterations of semiproper
forcing. (The reason is that a semiproper forcing may change the coﬁnality
of a regular uncountable cardinal to ω: It is not necessarily the case that
a countable set of ordinals in V [G] is included in a set that is countable
in V .) When the iteration adds no new countable sets, however, the proof of
Theorem 31.15 does go through for semiproper forcing, and we have:
Lemma 34.5. If P is a countable support iteration of semiproper forcing
notions and if P is ω-distributive, then P is semiproper.
⊓⊔
In Chapter 37 we shall deal with iterations of semiproper forcings.

The Model L(R)
We shall now show that if there exists a supercompact cardinal then every
set of reals in L(R) is Lebesgue measurable, has the Baire property and
the perfect set property. In fact, the reals in L(R) behave exactly as the
reals in Solovay’s model in Theorem 26.14(i). The regularity of sets of reals
in L(R) follows of course from Theorem 33.26, and we shall outline later in
this chapter the methods that lead to the proof of that theorem. We shall
prove the following:
Theorem 34.6 (Woodin). Let κ be a superstrong cardinal and let V [G]
be the generic extension of V by the L´evy collapse Col(ℵ0, <κ). Then there
exists an elementary embedding
j : L(R) →(L(R))V [G].
(For superstrong cardinals, see Exercise 34.2.)
Corollary 34.7. If there exists a superstrong cardinal then every set of reals
in L(R) is Lebesgue measurable, has the Baire property, and has the perfect
set property. In particular, there is no projective well-ordering of R.
⊓⊔
The main result used in the proof of Theorem 34.6 is the following result
on saturated ideals:
Theorem 34.8. If κ is a superstrong cardinal then there exists an ω-dis-
tributive κ-c.c. notion of forcing P such that in V P , κ = ℵ2 and there exists
a normal ℵ2-saturated ideal on ω1.
Let us show how Theorem 34.8 implies Theorem 34.6:
Proof of Theorem 34.6. Let P be the notion of forcing from Theorem 34.8,
and let M be the generic extension of V by P. In M, let I be a normal ℵ2-
saturated ideal on ω1, and let Q be the notion of forcing P(ω1)/I. Q yields an
M-generic M-ultraﬁlter G on ω1; let N = UltG(M) be the generic ultrapower.
If j : M →N is the generic elementary embedding then (by the results proved
in Chapter 22), ω1 is the critical point, j(ω1) = ωM
2
= κ, and (P(ω1))N =
(P(ω1))M[G]. Hence RN = RM[G], and since RM = R, j yields an elementary
embedding
(34.5)
j : L(R) →(L(R))V P ∗Q.
Let B = B(P ∗Q). Since P satisﬁes the κ-chain condition and I is κ-
saturated in V P , B satisﬁes the κ-chain condition. Since P collapses all car-
dinals below κ to ω1, and Q collapses ω1 (because ℵN
1
= j(ℵ1) = ℵM
2 ),

34. Supercompact Cardinals and the Real Line
651
B makes κ = ℵ1. Every complete subalgebra of B generated by fewer than κ
elements has size less than κ (by weak compactness of κ), and hence we have
(i) B is κ-c.c.,
(ii) B = 
α<κ Bα where |Bα| < κ, and Bα <reg Bβ for all α <
β < κ,
(iii) every γ < κ is countable in V Bα for some α < κ.
(34.6)
It follows from (34.6) that B is isomorphic to the L´evy collapse Col(ω, <κ)
(see Exercise 34.5), and Theorem 34.6 now follows from (34.5).
⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 34.8. The notion of forcing P is a countable support it-
eration of length κ, where κ is a superstrong cardinal. The goal is to build
a model V P in which for some stationary set A ⊂ω1, the nonstationary ideal
estricted to A, i.e., INS↾A, is ℵ2-saturated. We shall ﬁrst describe the iterates.
Let us ﬁx a set A ⊂ω1 such that both A and ω1 −A are stationary. Let
{Ai : i ∈W} be a maximal almost disjoint collection of stationary subsets
of A (in this context, almost disjoint means that Ai ∩Ak is nonstationary).
If |W| > ℵ1, consider the following notion of forcing QW : First let Q be
the forcing that collapses |W| to ℵ1 with countable conditions. In V Q, let
˙S = 
i∈W Ai, and let P ˙S be the forcing (from Theorem 23.8) that shoots
a closed unbounded set through (ω1−A)∪˙S. Let QW = Q∗P ˙S. Equivalently,
let QW be the set of all pairs (q, p) such that
(i) q : γ + 1 →W for some γ < ω1, and
(ii) p ⊂ω1 is a closed countable set such that α ∈p ∩A implies
α ∈
ξ<α Aq(ξ).
(34.7)
A condition (q′, p′) is stronger than (q, p) if q′ ⊃q and p′ is an end-extension
of p.
The forcing QW preserves stationary subsets of ω1 (Exercise 34.6) but is
not necessarily semiproper. If W is not maximal then QW makes it maximal,
and preserves all stationary subsets of ω1 −A and of all Ai (Exercise 34.7).
Note also that if A is a nonstationary set then the forcing QW as deﬁned
in (34.7) has a dense subset that is countably closed.
The eﬀect of QW is that in the generic extension, 
i∈W Ai = A (mod INS)
and |W| = ℵ1. (In the intermediate extension by Q there could exist a new
stationary subset of A almost disjoint from each Ai, but it is destroyed by P ˙S,
and in V QW , 
i∈W Ai ∪(ω1 −A) contains a closed unbounded set.)
Now we deﬁne a countable support iteration Pα; and then we let P = Pκ.
Using some book-keeping device (standard in forcing iterations), at stage α
we consider (in V Pα) a maximal almost disjoint collection {Ai : i ∈W} of
stationary subsets of A such that |W| > ℵ1. If QW is semiproper, we let
˙Qα = QW ; otherwise we let ˙Qα be the collapse with countable conditions
of 2ℵ2 to ℵ1.
Thus Pα is a countable support iteration of semiproper forcing notions.
The role of the set A is to guarantee that Pα is ω-distributive. To show that,

652
Part III. Selected Topics
consider the generic extension V [G] obtained by shooting a closed unbounded
set through κ −A. In V [G], each ˙Qα has a countably close dense subset, and
so Pα is a countable support iteration of countably closed forcing notions.
Hence Pα is ω-distributive in V [G], and therefore in V .
Thus by Lemma 34.5, each Pα is semiproper. Since κ is inaccessible and
Pκ is the direct limit of small forcing notions, Pκ satisﬁes the κ-chain condi-
tion. Since at coﬁnally many stages ˙Qα collapses 2ℵ2 (of V Pα) to ℵ1, κ be-
comes ℵ2 in the model V P . The model V P has no new countable sets of
ordinals, and every stationary subset of ω1 remains stationary. Moreover, if
S ∈V P is a subset of ω1 and is stationary in some V Pα, then it remains sta-
tionary: This is because V P is a semiproper forcing extension of V Pα—the
iteration from α to κ is a countable support iteration of semiproper forcings
in V Pα, and is ω-distributive (in V Pα).
We shall now prove that in V P , the ideal INS↾A is ℵ2-saturated. Let G
be a generic ﬁlter on Pκ and assume that in V [G] there exists a maximal
almost disjoint family of stationary subsets of A, such that |W| > ℵ1 (hence
|W| = ℵV [G]
2
= κ). Let W be such a family, and assume further that W is
chosen by our book-keeping to be the family considered at stage κ of the
iteration.
Let j : V →M be an elementary embedding with critical point κ such
that Vj(κ) ⊂M. For all α < j(κ), (Pα)M = Pα; (Pj(κ))M = j(Pκ) is the
direct limit of the Pα while Pj(κ) is the direct or inverse limit, depending
on cf j(κ) in V . Let H be such that G ∗H is a generic ﬁlter on Pj(κ). Let
˜H = 
κ≤α<j(κ) H↾α; G ∗˜H is an M-generic ﬁlter on j(Pκ), and j : V →M
extends (in V [G ∗H]) to an elementary embedding j : V [G] →M[G ∗˜H].
One more remark before we proceed. If X ⊂ω1 is a stationary set in
M[G][ ˜H] then it is stationary in V [G][H]. This is because X ∈M[G][H↾α]
for some α < j(κ), hence X is stationary in V [G][H↾α], and V [G][H] is
a semiproper forcing extension of V [G][H↾α].
Lemma 34.9. The forcing notion QW is semiproper in V [G].
This will complete the proof: If QW is semiproper then Qκ = QW . It
follows that A =  W, after forcing with Qκ, hence in M[G][ ˜H]. This is
a contradiction, since j(W) is an almost disjoint family of stationary subsets
of A, and W ⊂j(W) and W ̸= j(W), since |W| = κ in V [G].
Proof. Assume that QW is not semiproper. Let N = (Hκ+)V [G]; there is
a p ∈QW such that the set
(34.8)
S = {M ∈[N]ω : p ∈M and no q ≤p is (M, QW )-semigeneric}
is stationary. Since QW is not semiproper, the forcing
˙Qκ is the collapse
(with countable conditions) of 2κ to ℵ1. Let Gκ be a generic ﬁlter on ˙Qκ;
since ˙Qκ is ω-closed, S remains stationary in V [G][Gκ]. Since S ∈M[G], S is
in M[G][Gκ] a stationary subset of [N]ω and N has cardinality ℵ1. Let π

34. Supercompact Cardinals and the Real Line
653
be (in M[G][Gκ]) a one-to-one correspondence between N and ω1, and let
˜S = ω1 ∩π“S. ˜S is, in M[G][Gκ], a stationary subset of ω1.
Now work in V [G][H] and consider the forcing notion Qj(W) = j(QW )
and the condition p ∈QW from (34.8). By Exercise 34.8, j(p) = p forces
that j(S) is nonstationary. In the generic extension, j(S) is a nonstationary
subset of [j(N)]ω, and hence j“S is a nonstationary subset of [j“N]ω and
therefore S is a nonstationary subset of [N]ω. It follows that (in V[G][H])
(34.9)
p ⊩Qj(W ) ˜S is a nonstationary subset of ω1.
The set ˜S is stationary in M[G][Gκ] and therefore in M[G][ ˜H] (which
is a semiproper forcing extension of M[G][Gκ]). The family j(W) is, in
M[G][ ˜H], a maximal almost disjoint family of stationary subsets of A and
therefore intersects either ω1 −A or some E ∈W in a stationary set; for
instance let E ∈j(W) be such that ˜S ∩E is stationary. Thus ˜S ∩E is sta-
tionary in V [G][H], and (by Exercise 34.7), remains stationary after forcing
(over V [G][H]) with Qj(W). This contradicts (34.9).
⊓⊔
Stationary Tower Forcing
We shall describe a forcing notion, due to Hugh Woodin, that is used, among
other applications, to generalize Theorem 34.6 and prove Theorem 33.33.
Deﬁnition 34.10 (Stationary Tower Forcing). Let κ be an inaccessible
cardinal. The forcing notion Q = Q<κ consists of conditions (Vα, S) where
α < κ and S is a stationary subset of [Vα]ω. A condition (Vβ, T ) is stronger
than (Vα, S) if α ≤β and T ↾Vα ⊂S.
Equivalently, (Vβ, T ) ≤(Vα, S) if α ≤β and T ⊂SVβ where SVβ is the
lifting of S to [Vβ]ω; see Theorem 8.27. The forcing Q<κ is not separative:
Two conditions (Vα, S) and (Vβ, T ) are equivalent if and only if for some (all)
γ ≥α, β, SVγ ≃T Vγ mod the nonstationary ideal on [Vγ]ω.
If (Vα, S) is a condition, Vα is determined by S (Vα =  S), so we can
abuse the notation by calling S a condition in Q<κ; we say that Vα is the
support of S.
If G is a generic ﬁlter then for each α < κ, G∩[Vα]ω is a normal ultraﬁlter
extending the closed unbounded ﬁlter. In V [G], we deﬁne a generic ultrapower
UltG(V ) as follows: Consider formulas f ∈V deﬁned on some Vα, α < κ, and
let, for f on Vα and g on Vβ,
(34.10)
f =G g if for some S ∈G with support ≥α, β, f(x∩Vα) = g(x∩Vβ)
for all x ∈S;
f ∈G g is deﬁned similarly. Below we prove that if κ is a Woodin cardinal
then UltG(V ) is well-founded.

The following deﬁnition was inspired by the earlier sections of this chapter,
in particular Exercise 34.9: Let M ⊂N be countable models; we say that
N end-extends M if for all u ∈M, u ∩N = u ∩M.
Deﬁnition 34.11. Let A be a dense set of conditions in Q<κ. A is semiproper
if for all suﬃciently large λ there is a closed unbounded set in [Hλ]ω of
countable elementary submodels M such that for some countable N ≺Hλ,
(i) M ⊂N and N end-extends M ∩Vκ,
(ii) ∃S ∈A ∩N with support Vα such that N ∩Vα ∈S.
(34.11)
The deﬁnition has equivalent variants:
Lemma 34.12. Each of the following two properties is equivalent to semi-
properness of A:
(i) There is a closed unbounded set of countable M ≺Vκ+1 such that
some countable N ≺Vκ+1 satisﬁes (34.11).
(ii) For all suﬃciently large λ, for every countable M ≺Hλ such that
A ∈M there is a countable N ≺Hλ that satisﬁes (34.11).
Proof. For the nontrivial implication (i) ⇒(ii) see Exercise 34.10.
⊓⊔
The following is the key lemma. If δ is a Woodin cardinal and A is a dense
subset of Q<δ then for a closed unbounded set of κ < δ, A ∩Q<κ is dense
in Q<κ, and for a stationary set of κ, κ is λ-strong for A for all λ < δ.
Lemma 34.13. Let κ < δ be such that A ∩Q<κ is dense in Q<κ and that
κ is λ-strong for A for all λ < δ. Then A ∩Q<κ is semiproper in Q<κ.
Proof. Toward a contradiction, assume that the set
S = {M ≺Vκ+1 : there is no N ≺Vκ+1 such that (34.11) holds}
is stationary. Let λ > κ + 1 (λ < δ) be such that (Vλ, ∈) ≺(Vδ, ∈). Let
j : V →M be an elementary embedding with critical point κ such that
j(κ) > λ, Vλ ∈M and j(A) ∩Vλ = A ∩Vλ. We have S ∈M, S ∈j(Q<κ),
and M ⊨j(A) is dense in j(Q<κ), and so there exists a T < S such that
T ∈j(A) ∩Vλ = A ∩Vλ. Note that T < S means that for every z ∈T ,
z ∩Vκ+1 ∈S.
Let Vα be the support of T . We shall ﬁnd a countable x ≺Vκ+1, a count-
able y ≺j(Vα), and a countable z ≺Vα such that y∩Vα = z ∈T , z∩Vκ+1 = x,
and T ∈y. Then y end-extends j(x∩Vκ) = x∩Vκ, T ∈j(A)∩y, and y∩Vα ∈T .
This implies (by (34.11)) that j(x) /∈j(S), but z ∈T < S implies that x ∈S,
a contradiction.
To ﬁnd x, y, and z, let F : V <ω
α
→Vα be the function F(e ∪{f}) =
j(f)(T, e) (if deﬁned and ∈Vα; e is a ﬁnite subset of Vα and f ∈Vα is
a function), and let z ∈T be closed under F. Let y = {(jf)(T, e) : f ∈z and
e ∈z<ω} and x = z ∩Vκ+1. We have y ≺j(Vα), y ∩Vα = z and T ∈y, as
desired.

34. Supercompact Cardinals and the Real Line

Lemma 34.13 is used to prove the following theorem on the stationary
tower forcing:
Theorem 34.14 (Woodin, [1988]). Let δ be a Woodin cardinal and let
Q<δ be the stationary tower forcing. Let G be a generic ﬁlter on Q<δ, and
let j : V →UltG be the canonical elementary embedding into the generic
ultrapower. Then
(i) UltG is well-founded.
(ii) j(ω1) = δ.
(iii) In V [G], the model UltG is closed under <δ-sequences.
We sketch the proof of (i) and refer the reader to Woodin [1988] for the
details of the complete proof. (Woodin’s paper states the theorem for a super-
compact cardinal but the proof can be easily adapted. See also Woodin [1999],
Theorem 2.36.)
Proof. (i) If A is a dense set and N is a countable model, we say that N cap-
tures A if (34.11)(ii) holds. First we claim that if A ⊂Q<κ is semiproper
then for every condition p ∈Q<κ there is a stronger condition q such that
every N ∈q captures A. This is proved by showing that the set
q = {N ≺Vκ+1 : N ∩Vα ∈p and N captures A}
(where Vα is the support of p) is stationary. To show this, let F : V <ω
κ+1 →Vκ+1
and let M ≺Hλ for some λ be such that A ∈M, F ∈M, and M ∩Vα ∈p.
Let N ⊃M be such that N end-extends M ∩Vκ and captures A. Then
N ∩Vκ+1 ∈q and is closed under F.
One proves similarly that if An, n < ω, are semiproper then for every p
there exists a q < p such that every N ∈q captures every An.
Now let ⟨˙fn : n < ω⟩be a sequence of names of functions in the generic
ultrapower, names for a descending sequence of ordinals. For each n there is
a dense set An such that for each S ∈An there is an ordinal function f S
n on S
such that S ⊩˙fn = f S
n . Let κ < δ be such that each An ∩Q<κ is semiproper,
and let p ∈G be such that every N ∈p captures each An.
Now we deﬁne, for each n < ω, a function fn on p as follows: If N ∈p, let
fn(N) = f S
n (N) where S ∈An (with support Vα) is such that N ∩Vα ∈S.
The functions fn are deﬁned for almost all (mod INS) N ∈p, and fn+1(N) <
fn(N) for all n, producing a descending sequence of ordinals.
(iii) is proved similarly; one can show that if Aα, α < γ, with γ < δ
are semiproper then for every p there exists a q < p such that every N ∈q
captures Aα for all α ∈N.
(ii) follows by showing that δ remains a regular cardinal in V [G] and that
every α < δ is collapsed to ω. While the proof of regularity of δ is similar to
the proof of (iii), the proof that α becomes countable is a consequence of the
following fact that is easy to verify: If S ∈Q<δ has support Vα then
S ⊩j“Vα ∈j(S).

Weakly Homogeneous Trees
Let δ be a Woodin cardinal. By Theorem 34.14 there exists a generic ele-
mentary embedding j : V →M such that RM = RV [G] and j(ω1) = δ; G is
a generic ﬁlter on Q = Q<δ. Consider the following forcing notion P in V [G]:
A forcing condition p is a V -generic ﬁlter on the L´evy collapse Col(ω, <λ)
for some λ < δ; p is stronger than q if p ⊃q. The forcing P does not add
reals and if H ⊂P is V [G]-generic then H is a V -generic ﬁlter on Col(ω, <δ).
Under additional assumptions on δ, such as that δ is also a limit of Woodin
cardinals, every countably generated subalgebra of Q<δ has cardinality less
than δ, and RV [G] = RV [H]. Hence there exists an elementary embedding
j : L(R) →L(R)Col(ω,<δ) and consequently, the sets of reals in L(R) have
the regularity properties stated in Corollary 34.7.
The above argument yields a stronger result:
Corollary 34.15. If δ is a Woodin cardinal and a limit of Woodin cardinals,
if P is a forcing notion such that |P| < δ, and if G is a generic ﬁlter on P,
then the model L(R)V [G] is elementarily equivalent to L(R).
Proof. As δ remains a Woodin cardinal in V [G], we can ﬁnd a V -generic
ﬁlter H on Col(ω, <δ) such that V [G] ⊂V [H] and V [H] is a Col(ω, <δ)-
generic extension of V [G], and elementary embeddings j : L(R) →L(R)V [H]
and k : L(R)V [G] →L(R)V [H].
⊓⊔
This property of Woodin cardinals (that the theory of L(R) is unchanged
by small forcing) has been exploited by Woodin to prove the following theo-
rem. In [1988] these results are stated under the assumption that a supercom-
pact cardinal exists, but Woodin subsequently proved the theorem under the
assumption stated below. The assumption is close to optimal as ω Woodin
cardinals do not suﬃce; compare also with Theorem 35.20. The proof of (ii)
uses the result in (i), and is a restatement of Theorem 33.33, establishing
Determinacy in L(R).
Theorem 34.16 (Woodin, [1988]). Assume that there exist inﬁnitely many
Woodin cardinals with a measurable cardinal above them. Let λ be the supre-
mum of the ﬁrst ω Woodin cardinals.
(i) For every set A ⊂R in L(R) there exist trees T and S such that
A = p[T ],
R −A = p[S]
and for every forcing P such that |P| < λ, if G ⊂P is generic then
V [G] ⊨p[T ] ∪p[S] = R and p[T ] ∩p[S] = ∅.
(ii) Every set A ⊂R in L(R) is κ-weakly homogeneously Suslin, for all
κ < λ.

Historical Notes
Woodin cardinals were introduced by Woodin (both Deﬁnitions 20.31 and 34.1).
Strong and superstrong cardinals were considered by Mitchell [1979a], Dodd and
Jensen (Dodd [1982]) and Baldwin [1986], in their study of inner models.
Semiproper forcing was introduced by Shelah and was investigated extensively
by Foreman, Magidor, and Shelah in [1988]. For Theorem 34.6, see Shelah and
Woodin [1990]. The proof of Theorem 34.8 was inspired by the work of Foreman,
Magidor, and Shelah on Martin’s Maximum.
Stationary tower forcing and its applications (Theorem 34.14, Corollary 34.15,
and Theorem 34.16) are due to Woodin.

35. Inner Models for Large Cardinals
This chapter is an introduction to the highly technical theory of inner models
for large cardinals. We present the fundamental concepts and ideas of the
theory and state, mostly without a proof (or giving an outline of a proof)
some signiﬁcant results.
There are two major themes in the theory of inner models. One is that
with a given large cardinal property one can associate a minimal inner model
of ZFC for that property. An example is the model L[U] for a measurable
cardinal. The other is the construction of core models for large cardinals.
These generalize the Dodd-Jensen core model K that we describe in some
detail. K is an inner model of ZFC that satisﬁes GCH and either the Covering
Theorem holds for K (see below) or L[U] exists.
Deﬁnition 35.1. Let M be an inner model of ZFC. We say that the Cov-
ering Theorem holds for M if for every uncountable set X of ordinals there
exists some Y ∈M such that |Y | = |X|.
If the Covering Theorem holds for some inner model M that satisﬁes GCH
then (exactly as in Corollaries 18.31–18.33) the Singular Cardinal Hypothesis
holds, every singular cardinal is singular in M, and (κ+)M = κ+ for every
singular cardinal κ.
A theory of core models has been developed for large cardinals up to
a Woodin cardinal. While the Covering Theorem does not hold beyond K,
a generalized core model possesses the following feature: If there exists no
inner model for a large cardinal with a given property then the core model M
for such a property is “close to” the universe V ; typically, (κ+)M = κ+ for
every singular strong limit cardinal. This feature makes core models a tool
for gauging the consistency strength of set-theoretical conjectures.
As an example, Dodd-Jensen’s Covering Theorem for K gives a lower
bound for the consistency of the failure of SCH: If SCH fails then the Cover-
ing Theorem for K fails and therefore there exists an inner model for a mea-
surable cardinal.

The Core Model
The origin of the core model theory was the construction, by Dodd and
Jensen, of the core model K. The Dodd-Jensen core model (“the core model
up to a measurable cardinal”) is an inner model K that contains much of
the large cardinal structure without the existence of measurable cardinals.
Its main features are:
(1) K has a deﬁnable well-ordering, satisﬁes GCH and combinatorial prin-
ciples such as □.
(2) There exists a nontrivial elementary embedding j : K →K if and
only if L[U] exists.
(3) If L[U] does not exist then the Covering Theorem holds for K.
If L[U] exists then K has a simple deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 35.2. Assume that L[U] exists. The core model is the inner
model
K =

α∈Ord
Ult(α)
U (L[U]).
It is easy to verify that K is an inner model. Only the lower parts of the
iterated ultrapowers matter; see Exercise 35.1.
Central to the theory of inner models is the “internal” deﬁnition of K.
The main idea underlying the theory, including the generalizations of K, is
that the core model is approximated by transitive models (sets), so called
mice. Mice are the building blocks of K, as much as the models Lα are for L.
The preferred hierarchy for the ﬁne structure of L is the Jensen hierar-
chy Jα. For K, we use its relativization JA
α for the language {∈, A} where
A is a unary predicate: We modify Deﬁnition 27.2 (of rudimentary functions)
by adding the function F(x) = x ∩A to obtain functions rudimentary in A,
and let, for any set A,
(35.1)
rudA(M) = the closure of M ∪{M} under functions rudimentary
in A.
Deﬁnition 35.3. JA
0 = ∅, JA
α+1 = rudA(JA
α ), JA
α = 
β<α Jβ if α is a limit
ordinal.
It follows that L[A] = 
α∈Ord JA
α . See Exercise 35.2 for some properties
of the relativized Jensen hierarchy. Each JA
α is a transitive set and we abuse
the notation by using JA
α to denote also the model (JA
α , ∈, A ∩JA
α ).
Deﬁnition 35.4. A mouse is a transitive model M = JU
α such that
(i) U is a normal κ-complete iterable M-ultraﬁlter on some κ < α,
(ii) all iterated ultrapowers of JU
α by U are well-founded,
(iii) M = HM
1 (γ ∪p) (the Σ1 Skolem hull) for some γ < κ and some ﬁnite
p ⊂α.

35. Inner Models for Large Cardinals
661
More speciﬁcally, M is a mouse at κ.
Some remarks about the deﬁnition: Iterability is the condition (19.17) that
makes possible iterating the ultrapower. In Chapter 19 we assumed that M is
a model of ZF−which is not the case for mice (the requirement (iii) precludes
it; see Exercise 35.3). Lo´s’s Theorem is not true in general in ultrapowers of
mice, only for Σ0 formulas (actually for Σ1 formulas as we discuss below).
One uses the ﬁne structure to overcome this diﬃculty. Finally, for (ii) it is
suﬃcient that the ω1st iterate is well-founded.
Deﬁnition 35.5. K = L{M : M is a mouse}.
Below we outline a proof of the following theorem:
Theorem 35.6 (Dodd-Jensen).
(i) K is an inner model of ZFC and has a Σ2 well-ordering.
(ii) K satisﬁes GCH.
(iii) RK has a Σ1
3 well-ordering.
(iv) KK = K, and KV [G] = K for every generic extension.
(v) If L[U] exists then K = 
α∈Ord Ult(α)
U L[U].
(vi) In K, L[U] does not exist.
(vii) If 0♯does not exist then K = L. If 0♯exists then 0♯∈K. More
generally, for every x ∈K, if x♯exists then x♯∈K.
⊓⊔
We now outline the basic theory of mice and techniques used in the core
model theory. First we state a special case of (vii):
Lemma 35.7. A mouse exists if and only if 0♯exists.
Proof. If a mouse exists at κ, then the iterates κ(α) are indiscernibles for L.
Conversely, let 0♯exist and let iα be the Silver indiscernibles. For each α,
let jα : L →L be the unique elementary embedding with critical point iα
such that jα(iα) = iα+1; Let Uα be the corresponding L-ultraﬁlter. Using
indiscernibility, one shows that jUα = jα. Each Uα is iterable and all iterates
Ult(β)
Uα (L) are well-founded.
Now consider κ = i0 and U = U0, and let M = JU
κ+1. One proves that
U ⊂JU
κ+1 ⊂L, and Ult(α)
U (JU
κ+1) = JUα
iα+1. Finally, one veriﬁes that JU
κ+1 =
HM
1 (∅), and hence M is a mouse.
⊓⊔
Instrumental in the core model theory is the comparison of mice, a Σ2 well-
ordering of the class of all mice obtained by comparing the transﬁnite iterates
of mice.
For every regular uncountable cardinal λ, let Cλ denote the closed un-
bounded ﬁlter on λ. Let M = JU
α be a mouse at κ, and let λ be a regular

cardinal greater than κ+. Then (as in Chapter 19), the λth iterate of M has
the form
(35.2)
Ultλ
U(M) = JCλ
β .
Clearly, JCλ
β
is constructible from M, but M is also constructible from JCλ
β :
M is isomorphic to the Σ1 Skolem hull of γ ∪i0,λ(p) in JCλ
β .
For a given mouse M, γ and p are ﬁxed to be least possible such that
M = HM
1 (γ ∪p), in the following sense: γ is the least such γ, and then p is
the least p in the lexicographic ordering of ﬁnite descending sequences of
ordinals.
Deﬁnition 35.8. Let M = JU
α = HM
1 (γ ∪p) and M ′ = JU′
α′ = HM′
1
(γ′ ∪p′)
be mice, and let λ be (any) suﬃciently large regular cardinal. Let i0,λ : M →
JCλ
β
and i′
0,λ : M ′ →JCλ
β′ be the iterated ultrapowers, with q = i0,λ(p) and
q′ = i′
0,λ(p′). We deﬁne M < M ′ as follows:
(i) either β < β′,
(ii) or β = β′ and γ < γ′,
(iii) or β = β′ and γ = γ′, and q < q′ (in the descending lexicographic
ordering).
Lemma 35.9. < is a well-ordering of mice, and if M ≤M ′ then M ∈L[M ′].
Proof. If β < β′ then JCλ
β
∈JCλ
β′ , and M ∈L[JCλ
β ].
⊓⊔
An analysis of the complexity of < reveals that it is a Σ2 relation (and that
< on RK is Σ1
3). We recall that the constructible hierarchy is Σ1; the added
complexity in K is caused by the condition that every iterated ultrapower of
a mouse is well-founded.
Being a mouse is absolute for transitive models of ZF, and so is the well-
ordering of mice. Thus if M is an inner model then KM = L{N : N is
a mouse and N ∈M}, and KK = K. Since the well-ordering of mice is
deﬁnable in K, K is a model of ZFC.
If V [G] is a generic extension of V (by a set forcing) then for all suﬃciently
large regular cardinals λ, the closed unbounded ﬁlter Cλ on λ in V [G] is
generated by the closed unbounded ﬁlter in V . Hence JCλ
β
is the same in V [G]
as in V , and so every mouse in V [G] is in V . Hence KV [G] = K.
If L[U] exists then every mouse is in L[Cλ] for some λ; but L[Cλ] =
Ult(λ)
U L[U]. Hence K ⊂
α∈Ord Ult(α)L[U]. If x is a set of ordinals in

α Ult(α) then for some λ > sup x, x ∈L[U (λ)]. Hence there exists a mouse
M ≺Σ1 JU(λ)
λ+
such that x ∈M. Therefore K = 
α∈Ord Ult(α)L[U]. The
latter model has no submodel with a measurable cardinal and so neither
does K.
One important feature of K is the following, which we state without
a proof:
Lemma 35.10. If mice exist then K = {M : M is a mouse}.
⊓⊔

35. Inner Models for Large Cardinals
663
Proofs in the core model theory such as the proof of Lemma 35.10 involve
iterations of mice. One of the diﬃculties is that since mice do not satisfy ZF−,
the resulting embeddings are not fully elementary. It is easy to verify that
i0,1 : M →UltU M is Σ0-elementary, and an additional argument shows that
i0,1 is Σ1-elementary; similarly for iα,β. While the ﬁnite iterates of a mouse
are mice, arbitrary iterates are not. See Exercises 35.5–35.7.
The proof of GCH in K resembles somewhat Silver’s proof of GCH
in L[U]. Instrumental in the proof (and proofs of combinatorial principles
in K) are condensation arguments, similar to Lemmas 18.38 and 27.5. These
proofs use heavily the ﬁne structure of K (including projecta, standard codes
and parameters), reducing arguments about Σn to Σ1.
The ﬁne structure of K makes it possible to generalize combinatorial
properties such as ♦and □from L to K.
There is an alternative way of developing the theory of K and proving
the main theorems. This method, due to Magidor, uses the closed unbounded
ﬁlter directly. Instead of using mice, K can be deﬁned using Deﬁnition 35.12
below (this deﬁnition is equivalent to the Dodd-Jensen deﬁnition).
Deﬁnition 35.11. The closed unbounded ﬁlter Cκ on κ survives at β if for
every n and f : [κ]n →{0, 1} with f ∈Lβ+1[Cκ] there is a set C ∈Cκ
homogeneous for f.
Deﬁnition 35.12. A set x belongs to K if and only if for some κ > rank(x)
and some β, x ∈Lβ[Cκ] and Cκ survives at β.
If Cκ survives at β then it survives at all β′ < β. If it survives at all β then
L[Cκ] is the inner model for one measurable cardinal. Cκ survives vacuously
at every β < κ, and survives at κ if and only if 0♯exists (Exercise 35.8).
If L[U] exists then for every suﬃciently large regular κ, L[Cκ] = L[U (κ)],
and so {Lβ[Cκ] ∩Vκ : Cκ survives at β} = {L[U (κ)] ∩Vκ : κ > ω regu-
lar} = K.
The Covering Theorem for K
The two main results on the core model are that unless L[U] exists, K is
rigid and the Covering Theorem holds for K:
Theorem 35.13 (Dodd-Jensen). The following are equivalent:
(i) L[U] exists.
(ii) There exists a nontrivial elementary embedding j : K →K.
⊓⊔
Theorem 35.14 (Dodd-Jensen’s Covering Theorem for K). If L[U]
does not exist, then for every uncountable set X of ordinals there exists a set
Y ⊃X in K such that |Y | = |X|.
⊓⊔

664
Part III. Selected Topics
If L[U] exists then the ultrapower by U yields an elementary embedding
j : K →K. The proof of the converse shows somewhat more: If j : K →M
is elementary, then necessarily M = K (and L[U] exists). The proofs of both
theorems use the ﬁne structure of K, but a great deal of the ﬁne structure
can be eliminated when using Magidor’s approach.
Since K is a model of ZFC, Corollaries 18.31, 18.32 and 18.33 all remain
true when L is replaced by K:
Corollary 35.15. If L[U] does not exist then every singular cardinal is sin-
gular in K, (κ+)K = κ+ for every singular κ, and the Singular Cardinal
Hypothesis holds.
⊓⊔
The Covering Theorem for L[U]
By Prikry’s Theorem 21.10 there is a generic extension of L[U] in which the
measurable cardinal κ of L[U] remains a cardinal while cf κ = ω. It follows
that the Covering Theorem for L[U] fails. However, it turns out that the
existence of a Prikry sequence is the only obstacle to the Covering Theorem:
Theorem 35.16 (Dodd-Jensen’s Covering Theorem for L[U]). As-
sume that there is an inner model with a measurable cardinal, let κ be the
least such cardinal and let U be a measure on κ in L[U]. Then
(i) either 0† exists, or
(ii) the Covering Theorem holds for L[U], or
(iii) there exists an ω-sequence S ⊂κ Prikry generic over L[U], such that
the Covering Theorem holds for L[U][S].
⊓⊔
Note that by Theorem 21.14, L[U][S] = L[S].
The Core Model for Sequences of Measures
The theory of K has been generalized by W. Mitchell who constructed a core
model Km for sequences of measures (the “core model up to o(κ) = κ++”).
In analogy with K,
(i) Km has a deﬁnable well-ordering, satisﬁes GCH and □.
(ii) There exists a nontrivial j : Km →Km if and only if there is an inner
model for a measurable cardinal κ with o(κ) = κ++.
(iii) If there is no model for o(κ) = κ++ then a “weak” covering theorem
holds for Km.
Mitchell’s core model is the union of mice where a mouse is an appropri-
ate generalization of the Dodd-Jensen mouse. The main result on Km is as
follows:

35. Inner Models for Large Cardinals
665
Theorem 35.17 (Mitchell).
(i) Km is a model of ZFC + GCH.
(ii) Km has a Σ2 well-ordering and □holds; R ∩Km has a Σ1
3 well-
ordering.
If there exists no inner model for o(κ) = κ++, then:
(iii) If U is a normal iterable Km-ultraﬁlter with UltU(Km) well-founded
then U ∈Km.
(iv) If j : Km →M is a nontrivial elementary embedding then j is an iter-
ated ultrapower using measures in Km. (Hence there is no nontrivial
j : Km →Km.)
(v) If κ is a singular strong limit cardinal then (κ+)Km = κ+.
⊓⊔
Clause (v) is often called “the Weak Covering Theorem.”
Theorem 35.17 is a useful tool for obtaining lower bounds for the consis-
tency strength. As an example, we present the following application:
Corollary 35.18 (Mitchell). Assume that κ is a measurable cardinal and
2κ > κ+. Then there is an inner model with a measurable λ of order λ++.
Proof. If there is no such model then (iii) and (iv) hold. Let D be a normal
measure on κ and jD : V →M = UltD(V ); let j = jD↾Km : Km →N.
By (iv), j is an iterated ultrapower, j = i0,ϑ : Km →Ult(ϑ) = N, by
measures in Km. Let Nν, ν ≤ϑ, be the iterates; N0 = Km and Nϑ = N.
If ν < ϑ is a limit ordinal then there exist ξν < ν and Uν ∈Nξν such that
Nν+1 = Ultiξν ,ν(Uν)(Nν). Since o(κ) < κ++ ≤2κ ≤ϑ, there is a stationary
set S ⊂κ++ of ordinals of coﬁnality ω such that ξν = ξ and Uν = U are
constant for ν ∈S. Let ν ∈S be a limit point of S, let ⟨νn : n < ω⟩be
coﬁnal in S ∩ν, and let κn be the critical point of iνn,ν, for each n. The
sequence ⟨κn : n < ω⟩generates the measure iξ,ν(U) and belongs to M,
hence iξ,ν(U) ∈M. By (iii), iξ,ν(U) ∈(Km)M = Nϑ but this is impossible
since iξ,ν(U) /∈Nν+1.
⊓⊔
This, combined with a theorem of Gitik [1989] shows that the existence
of a measurable cardinal κ such that 2κ > κ+ is equiconsistent with the
existence of a measurable cardinal κ of Mitchell order κ++.
Another result of Gitik (cf. [1989] and [1991]) shows that the consis-
tency strength of the failure of SCH is exactly a measurable cardinal κ with
o(κ) = κ++.
Up to a Strong Cardinal
The current core model theory employs sequences of extenders rather than
sequences of measures. This not only enables one to generalize the theory to

666
Part III. Selected Topics
large cardinals beyond measurable but also has some technical advantages
even in the case of Km.
Strong cardinals (see Chapter 20) were introduced by Dodd and Jensen
who also provided their characterization in terms of extenders. They also con-
structed an inner model of the form L[E] where E is a (transﬁnite) sequence
of extenders such that
(i) L[E] is a model of ZFC,
(ii) in L[E], E witnesses that there exists a strong cardinal,
(iii) L[E] satisﬁes GCH, □, and has a Σ1
3 well-ordering of the reals.
They also introduced a real, the sharp for a strong cardinal, that exists if and
only if there exists a nontrivial elementary embedding j : L[E] →L[E].
The theory of core models up to a strong cardinal uses mice of the form JE
α
where E is a sequence of JE
α-extenders. The crucial fact that makes the gen-
eralization of the Dodd-Jensen theory possible is that one uses sequences of
non-overlapping extenders. (Two extenders overlap if one is a (κ, λ)-extender,
the other a (κ′, λ′)-extender and κ ≤κ′ < λ.) This fact allows the compari-
son of mice by iteration, and while the generalization is far from routine, one
obtains a result similar to those for K and Km.
Theorem 35.19. There exists an inner model Kstrong such that:
(i) Kstrong is a model of ZFC + GCH.
(ii) Kstrong has a Σ2 well-ordering and □holds; R∩Kstrong has a Σ1
3 well-
ordering.
If there exists no inner model for a strong cardinal then:
(iii) If j : Kstrong →M is a nontrivial elementary embedding then j is an
iterated ultrapower by extenders in Kstrong. (Hence there is no non-
trivial j : Kstrong →Kstrong.)
(iv) If κ is a singular strong limit cardinal then (κ+)Kstrong = κ+.
⊓⊔
Inner Models for Woodin Cardinals
Inner models for very large cardinals employ a new method of comparison
of mice. Due to the presence of overlapping extenders, a “linear” iteration
of mice does not work and a new technique has been developed—the theory
of iteration trees. Iteration trees were introduced by Martin and Steel, who
used the technique to construct inner models for Woodin cardinals
Theorem 35.20 (Martin-Steel). If there are n Woodin cardinals then
there is an inner model that has n Woodin cardinals, and its reals have
a Σ1
n+2 well-ordering.
⊓⊔

35. Inner Models for Large Cardinals

The Σ1
n+2 result is best possible: If there are n Woodin cardinals with
a measurable cardinal above them then Π1
n+1 determinacy holds (Theo-
rem 33.26) and so R does not have a Σ1
n+2 well-ordering.
The ﬁne structure for iteration trees was developed further by Mitchell
and Steel who constructed an inner model for a Woodin cardinal that sat-
isﬁes GCH. Then Steel constructed a core model up to a Woodin cardinal,
under an additional assumption of a measurable cardinal above.
Let Ωbe a measurable cardinal. Steel’s core model Ksteel is an inner model
of VΩand if VΩhas no inner model with a Woodin cardinal then Ksteel is
both rigid and satisﬁes the Weak Covering Theorem:
Theorem 35.21. Let Ωbe a measurable cardinal.
(i) (Ksteel)VΩ[G] = Ksteel, for every generic extension of V Ω(by forcing
in VΩ).
If VΩhas no inner model with a Woodin cardinal then:
(ii) There is no nontrivial elementary embedding j : Ksteel →Ksteel.
(iii) For every singular cardinal λ < Ω, (λ+)Ksteel = λ+.
⊓⊔
The following is an application of Steel’s core model:
Theorem 35.22 (Steel). If ℵ1 carries an ℵ2-saturated ideal, and if there
exists a measurable cardinal, then there exists an inner model with a Woodin
cardinal.
⊓⊔
This is (almost) best possible, as Shelah proved that if κ is a Woodin
cardinal then there is a generic extension in which κ = ω2 and NSω1 is ω2-
saturated.

Historical Notes
The core model K was introduced by Dodd and Jensen in [1981, 1982a, 1982b];
see also Dodd [1982]. Theorem 35.6 is proved in [1981], Theorem 35.13 and 35.14
in [1982a], and the proof of ♦and □in K is due to Welch. An overview of K, with
some proofs, can be found in Mitchell [1979b] and Dodd [1983]. Magidor’s approach
is described in Magidor [1990] and in Kanamori’s forthcoming book [∞].
The core model Km for sequences of measures was introduced by Mitchell.
Theorem 35.17 was stated in Mitchell [1984]. Its proof has never been published
but a detailed sketch will appear in Mitchell [∞b] (in the forthcoming Handbook
of Set Theory). Mitchell’s article [∞b] and its companion [∞a] give an excellent
introduction to the inner model theory, as does the more expository Mitchell [1994].
The inner model L[E] for a strong cardinal appeared in Dodd [1982]. The deﬁ-
nition of Kstrong is given explicitly in Koepke [1989] where Theorem 35.19 is stated
(a proof has not been published).
Iteration trees are introduced in Martin and Steel [1994] where Theorem 35.20 is
proved. Fine structure for iteration trees is developed in Mitchell and Steel [1994]
obtaining an inner model with a Woodin cardinal and GCH. Steel’s core model
is constructed in Steel [1996], proving Theorem 35.21(i), (ii) and Theorem 35.22.
Theorem 35.21(iii) is proved in Mitchell et al. [1997].
An overview of these (and of more recent results) is given in L¨owe and
Steel [1999].

36. Forcing and Large Cardinals
In this chapter we continue to develop the techniques introduced in Chap-
ter 21. We shall describe several applications of forcing that use various large
cardinal assumptions.
Violating GCH at a Measurable Cardinal
By Silver’s Theorem 21.4 it is consistent, relative to a supercompact cardinal,
that GCH can fail at a measurable cardinal. This, combined with Prikry
forcing, shows further that the Singular Cardinal Hypothesis is unprovable.
The consistency strength of both statements has been proved to be exactly
o(κ) = κ++:
Theorem 36.1 (Gitik). The following are equiconsistent:
(i) There exists a measurable cardinal κ such that 2κ > κ+.
(ii) There exists a strong limit singular cardinal κ such that 2κ > κ+.
(iii) There exists a measurable cardinal κ of Mitchell order κ++.
As proved in Chapter 21 (Corollary 21.13), the consistency of (ii) follows
from the consistency of (i) by Prikry forcing. The necessity of (iii) for the
consistency of “not SCH” was proved by Gitik, by a combination of the pcf
theory and Mitchell’s inner model for sequences of measures. We omit the
proof.
As for the consistency of (i) using o(κ) = κ++, this improvement of Silver’s
Theorem 21.4 is a combination of an intermediate forcing result of Woodin
which we outline below, and an additional forcing argument of Gitik that we
also omit.
⊓⊔
Theorem 36.2 (Woodin). Assume GCH and assume that there exists an
elementary embedding j : V →M with critical point κ such that M κ ⊂M
and that there exists a function f : κ →κ with j(f)(κ) = κ++. Then there is
a generic extension in which κ is a measurable cardinal and 2κ > κ+.
The assumption of Theorem 36.2 is easily seen to follow from κ being
(κ + 2)-strong (Exercise 36.1). By Gitik, the statement holds in some generic
extension of the canonical inner model for o(κ) = κ++.

670
Part III. Selected Topics
Proof. We outline the proof, which follows loosely the proof of Silver’s Theo-
rem 21.4. However, since the assumption is considerably weaker than super-
compactness, more delicate arguments are needed.
We may assume that j = jE and M = UltE, where E is a (κ, κ++)-
extender (Exercise 36.2). Let U be the ultraﬁlter U = {X ⊂κ : κ ∈j(X)}
and consider the commutative diagram
(36.1)

where N = UltU(V ) and i : V →N is the corresponding elementary embed-
ding. Let
(36.2)
λ = i(f)(κ)
and
µ = crit(k).
We have the following inequalities:
(36.3)
κ+ = (κ+)N = (κ+)M < µ ≤λ < i(κ) < κ++ < j(κ) < κ+++.
Moreover,
(36.4)
M = {k(t)(a) : a ⊂κ++ ﬁnite, t ∈N and t : [λ]|a| →N}
(see Exercise 36.3).
For cardinals α and β, let Add(α, β) denote the notion of forcing that
adds β subsets of α, cf. (15.3). The model for 2κ > κ+ is constructed in two
stages: The ﬁrst stage is (as in Silver’s proof) an iteration of length κ + 1,
with Easton support. The ﬁnal model is then obtained by a forcing extension
of this model.
Let P = Pκ+1 be the Easton support iteration of ˙Qα, where for each
α < κ, ˙Qα = {1} unless α is inaccessible and a closure point of the function f,
in which case ˙Qα = Add(α, f(α)) (in V Pα where Pα is the αth iterate). For
α = κ, ˙Qκ = (Add(κ, κ++))V Pκ . Let G be a generic ﬁlter on P; we have
V [G] = V [Gκ][Hκ] where Gκ is V -generic on Pκ and Hκ is V [Gκ]-generic on
Qκ = Add(κ, κ++)V [Gκ].
We recall some of the facts established in the proof of Theorem 21.4:
Pκ is κ-c.c. forcing notion of cardinality κ, κ remains inaccessible in V [G], and
V [G] satisﬁes 2κ = κ++. Since κ is in M a closure point of j(f), ˙Qκ = ( ˙Qκ)M,
and so P = (j(P))κ+1.
As for i : V →N, we use the fact that N κ ⊂N and that Pκ is κ-c.c.
to conclude (as in Lemma 21.9) that in V [Gκ], (N[Gκ])κ ⊂N[Gκ]. Also,
(Qκ)N[Gκ] = Add(κ, λ)V [Gκ].

36. Forcing and Large Cardinals
671
Using k(Pκ) = Pκ and the fact that k(p) = p for every p ∈Pκ, we
extend k : N →M to an embedding k : N[Gκ] →M[Gκ]. Now consider the
forcing Qκ in N[Gκ], and let
(36.5)
hκ = k−1(Hκ) = {p ∈Add(κ, λ)V [Gκ] : k(p) ∈Hκ}.
As QN[Gκ]
κ
has, in N[Gκ], the κ+-chain condition, and crit(k) > κ+, hκ is
QN[Gκ]
κ
-generic over N[Gκ] (see Exercise 36.4). Moreover, Gκ∗hκ is V -generic
on (i(P))κ+1 and in V [Gκ][hκ], (N[Gκ][hκ])κ ⊂N[Gκ][hκ] (Exercise 36.5).
Note also that (because λ < κ++), V [Gκ][hκ] satisﬁes 2κ = κ+. It follows
that, in V [Gκ][hκ], k can be extended to an embedding k : N[Gκ][hκ] →
M[Gκ][Hκ].
Let ˙R ∈N be the name for the iteration after stage κ + 1:
(36.6)
Pκ ∗˙QN
κ ∗˙R = i(Pκ)
and let R ∈N[Gκ][hκ] be the interpretation of ˙R by Gκ ∗hκ. In N[Gκ][hκ],
R is an i(κ)-c.c. forcing of cardinality i(κ), and because the least α for which
the αth iterate is nontrivial is above λ, R is λ-closed.
Using the fact that R is λ-closed and that the number of antichains of R
in N[Gκ][hκ] is small in V [Gκ][hκ] we conclude that there exists in V [Gκ][hκ]
an R-generic ﬁlter H over N[Gκ][hκ] (Exercise 36.6).
Now deﬁne k(H) as follows (in V [Gκ][hκ]):
(36.7)
k(H) = {q ∈k(R) : ∃p ∈H k(p) ≤q}.
We claim that k(H) is an M[Gκ][hκ]-generic ﬁlter on k(R). We omit the proof
(but see Exercise 36.7).
As p ∈H implies k(p) ∈k(H) for every p ∈R, k can be extended,
in V [Gκ][hκ], to an embedding k : N[Gκ][hκ][H] →M[Gκ][hκ][k(H)]. It
follows that i and j can be extended (in V [G]), so that we have the following
commutative diagram:

Now we describe the second stage of the construction, namely a generic
extension of V [G] = V [Gκ ∗Hκ], and in this extension, an elementary embed-
ding that extends j. We force over V [G] with the partial order Q = i(Qκ).
Since i(Qκ) is <i(κ)-closed in N[Gκ][hκ][H], it follows from Exercise 36.5
that Q is κ-closed in V [Gκ][hκ]. However, as the model V [G] = V [Gκ][Hκ]
is a generic extension of V [Gκ][hκ] by a κ+-c.c. forcing Add(κ, λ), Q is κ-
distributive in V [G] (Exercise 36.8).

672
Part III. Selected Topics
We also claim that in V [G], Q is κ++-c.c. To prove the claim, let ˜Q be,
in V [Gκ], the full support product of κ copies of Qκ. Note that ˜Q is κ++-
c.c. in V [Gκ], and since ˜Q ≃Qκ × ˜Q, ˜Q is κ++-c.c. in V [Gκ][Hκ] = V [G].
Since conditions in Q = i(Qκ) have the form i(g)(κ) where g : κ →Qκ, an
antichain in Q yields an antichain in ˜Q, proving the claim.
Hence forcing with Q preserves κ+ and κ++, and so 2κ = κ++ holds in
the extension. Let K be a Q-generic ﬁlter over V [G]. The ﬁnal step is to
ﬁnd in V [G][K] a generic j(K) over M[G][k(H)] such that the embedding j
from (36.8) extends to an embedding j : V [G][K] →M[G][k(H)][j(K)]. This
step, which we omit, ﬁrst applies k to K and produces a generic X such that
j extends to j : V [G] →M[G][k(H)][X], and then applies j to K and pro-
duces a generic Y such that j extends to j : V [G][K] →M[G][k(H)][X][Y ].
Details can be found in Gitik’s paper [1989].
As this ﬁnal step is performed inside V [G][K], it follows that in V [G][K],
κ is measurable.
⊓⊔
The Singular Cardinal Problem
By Corollary 21.13, the negation of the Singular Cardinal Hypothesis is con-
sistent relative to large cardinals, and its consistency strength is determined
by Theorem 36.1. These results belong to a wide area of theorems and con-
jectures known collectively as the Singular Cardinal Problem. Unlike the be-
haviour of the continuum function on regular cardinals, which by Easton’s
Theorem can be quite arbitrary, the values of the continuum function at
singular cardinals are subject to three kinds of constraint:
(1) By Silver’s Theorems 8.12 and 8.13, the value of 2κ for a singular car-
dinal κ of uncountable coﬁnality depends on the continuum function
below κ.
(2) The Galvin-Hajnal Theorem 24.1 and Shelah’s results in the pcf theory
give upper bounds for the value of 2κ when κ is a strong limit singular
cardinal such that κ < ℵκ.
(3) Jensen’s Covering Theorem 18.30 and the subsequent theory of core
models shows that the consistency of the failure of SCH requires large
cardinal assumptions.
There is a large body of forcing constructions that, using large cardinals,
yield models with various behaviour of the continuum function subject to the
above mentioned constraints. There is, however, no comprehensive solution
of the Singular Cardinal Problem analogous to Easton’s Theorem.
Below we list some of the advances in this area:
Theorem 36.3 (Magidor [1977a], [1977b]).
(i) If there exists a supercompact cardinal then there is a generic extension
in which 2ℵn < ℵω for all n < ω and 2ℵω = ℵω+2.

36. Forcing and Large Cardinals
673
(ii) If there exist κ < λ with κ supercompact and λ huge then there exists
a generic extension in which 2ℵn = ℵn+1 for all n < ω and 2ℵω =
ℵω+2.
⊓⊔
Theorem 36.4 (Woodin, Gitik [1989]). If there exists a measurable car-
dinal κ of Mitchell order κ++, then there exists a generic extension in which
GCH holds below ℵω and 2ℵω = ℵω+2.
⊓⊔
Theorem 36.5 (Magidor [1977a], Shelah [1983], Gitik [∞]). Assume
that there exists a supercompact cardinal.
(i) There is a generic extension in which GCH holds below ℵω, and 2ℵω =
ℵω+α+1, where α is any prescribed countable ordinal.
(ii) There is a generic extension in which ℵω1 is strong limit and 2ℵω1 =
ℵω1+α+1 for any prescribed ordinal α < ω2.
(iii) There is a generic extension in which GCH holds below the least ﬁxed
point of the aleph function κ = ℵκ while 2κ is any arbitrarily large
prescribed successor cardinal.
⊓⊔
Theorem 36.6 (Woodin, Cummings [1992]).
(i) If there exists a supercompact cardinal, then there is a generic exten-
sion in which 2κ = κ++ for each cardinal κ.
(ii) If there exists a strong cardinal, then there is a generic extension in
which 2κ = κ+ for each successor cardinal and 2κ = κ++ for each
limit cardinal.
⊓⊔
There are additional results on the failure of SCH by Gitik, Shelah and
others. The main open problem in this area is the following:
Problem 36.7. Is it consistent that ℵω is strong limit and 2ℵω > ℵω1?
Compare this with Shelah’s Theorem 24.33.
Violating SCH at ℵω
We shall now outline the Woodin-Gitik modiﬁcation of Magidor’s technique
for getting a model in which ℵω is strong limit and 2ℵω = ℵω+2. First we
describe the preparation forcing (which replaces Magidor’s use of a super-
compact cardinal):
Lemma 36.8. Assume that there exists a measurable cardinal κ with o(κ) =
κ++.
(i) There is a model V that satisﬁes GCH and
(36.9)
∃j : V →M, crit(j) = κ, M κ ⊂M and (κ++)M = κ++.

674
Part III. Selected Topics
(ii) There exists a model V with a measurable cardinal κ such that 2κ =
κ++ and a normal measure U on κ with N = UltU(V ), and there exists
a set G ∈V which is an N-generic ﬁlter on ColN((κ+++)N, <jU(κ))
(a L´evy collapse in N).
Proof. (i) We outline how to get a model that satisﬁes (36.9). First one
uses Gitik’s forcing from [1989] to get a model of GCH that has a (κ, κ++)-
extender E and a function f : κ →κ such that j(f)(κ) = κ++ (the as-
sumption of Theorem 36.2). Note that in M (where j : V →M), κ++ is
an inaccessible cardinal. To obtain (36.9), one uses the iteration of length κ,
with Easton support, of L´evy collapses Col(α+, <f(α)), followed by the L´evy
collapse Col(κ+, <κ++). In this generic extension, the embedding j : V →M
can be extended to an embedding that satisﬁes (36.9). (For details, see Gi-
tik [1989].)
(ii) Starting with j : V →M that satisﬁes (36.9), we do Woodin’s con-
struction described in the proof of Theorem 36.2, except that by (36.9), we
may assume that f(α) = α++ for all α. In the resulting model, κ is mea-
surable, 2κ = κ++, and if U is the measure {X : κ ∈j(X)} given by the
extended embedding j, then U has the required property. (Again, details are
in Gitik’s [1989].)
⊓⊔
For the rest of this section we assume that κ is a measurable cardinal with
2κ = κ++, U is a normal measure on κ, N = UltU(V ) and j = jU : V →N,
and G ∈V is an N-generic ﬁlter on ColN((κ+++)N, <j(κ)), the L´evy collapse
in N. Magidor’s forcing conditions are as follows:
A forcing condition has the form p = (κ0, f0, κ1, f1, . . . , κn−1, fn−1,
A, F) where
(i) κ0 < κ1 < . . . < κn−1 are inaccessible cardinals < κ,
(ii) fi ∈Col(κ+++
i
, <κi), for i < n−1 and fn−1 ∈Col(κ+++
n−1 , <κ),
(iii) A ∈U,
(iv) F is a function on A and F(α) ∈Col(α+++, <κ) for all α ∈A,
(v) [F]U, the element of Col((κ+++)N, <j(κ)) represented by F,
belongs to G.
(36.10)
A condition p′ = (κ′
0, f ′
0, . . . , κ′
m−1, f ′
m−1, A′, F ′) is stronger than p
if
(i) m ≥n,
(ii) κ′
i = κi for all i < n and κ′
i ∈A for all i, n ≤i < m,
(iii) f ′
i ⊃fi for all i < n and f ′
i ⊃F(κ′
i) for all i, n ≤i < m,
(iv) A′ ⊂A,
(v) F ′(α) ⊃F(α) for all α ∈A′.
(36.11)
This forcing produces a Prikry sequence ⟨κn : n < ω⟩coﬁnal in κ. A con-
sequence of (36.10)(v) is that the forcing satisﬁes the κ+-chain condition
(Exercise 36.9) and so (if κ is preserved) 2κ = κ++ in the generic extension.
The crucial property of this forcing is that the cardinals κn are preserved,

36. Forcing and Large Cardinals
675
and 2κn < κn+1. Since all but ﬁnitely many cardinals between κn and κn+1
are collapsed, there remain exactly ω cardinals between κ0 and κ. Thus we
can follow this generic extension by a L´evy collapse Col(ℵ0, <κ0) and in the
resulting model we have κ = ℵω and 2ℵω = ℵω+2 with ℵω strong limit.
The key to preservation of the cardinals κn is an analog of Prikry’s
Lemma 21.12:
Lemma 36.9. Let σ be a sentence of the forcing language and let p = (κ0, f0,
. . . , κn−1, fn−1, A, F) be a condition. Then there exists a stronger condition
p′ = (κ0, f ′
0, . . . , κn−1, f ′
n−1, A′, F ′) (with the same n) that satisﬁes σ.
⊓⊔
We omit the proof of Lemma 36.9 as well as its application and refer the
reader to Magidor [1977a] and Gitik [1989] for the details.
Radin Forcing
As a consequence of Jensen’s Covering Theorem, and more generally of the
inner model theory, large cardinals are necessary for any nontrivial change
of coﬁnality (with the exception of Namba forcing, Theorem 28.10). Prikry
forcing is the prime example of forcing that changes coﬁnality. In this section
we describe its generalizations.
The ﬁrst example, due to Magidor, generalizes Prikry forcing to change
the coﬁnality of a large cardinal κ to a given regular cardinal λ < κ while
preserving κ as a cardinal:
Let λ be a regular cardinal and let κ > λ be a measurable cardinal such
that o(κ) = λ. Using an inner model for o(κ) = λ, we may assume that there
exists a sequence
(36.12)
U0 < U1 < . . . < Uα < . . .
(α < λ)
of normal measures on κ, ordered by the Mitchell order. For every α < β < λ,
let f β
α : κ →Vκ be the function that represents Uα in UltUβ, i.e., [f β
α]Uβ = Uα.
A forcing condition is a pair (g, G) such that
(i) g is an increasing function from a ﬁnite subset of λ into κ,
(ii) G is a function on λ such that G(α) ⊂κ for all α < λ,
(iii) if α > max(dom g) then G(α) ∈Uα,
(iv) if α < max(dom g) and β is the least β ∈dom(g) above α,
then G(α) ∈f β
α(g(β)).
(36.13)
The ﬁnite function g plays the role of the ﬁnite sequence in the Prikry
forcing. The function G plays the role of the measure one set: Clause (iii) is
an obvious generalization while (iv) states that G(α) has measure one with

676
Part III. Selected Topics
respect to the measure f β
α(g(β)) on g(β), which reﬂects the properties of the
measure Uα in the ultrapower by Uβ.
A condition (h, H) is stronger than (g, G) if
(i) h ⊃g,
(ii) for every α, H(α) ⊂G(α),
(iii) for every α ∈dom(h) −dom(g), h(α) ∈G(α).
(36.14)
Magidor’s forcing (36.13) is a generalization of Prikry forcing. A generic
ﬁlter yields a coﬁnal λ-sequence in κ (Exercise 36.10). Similarly to the Prikry
forcing, (36.13) has a κ+-chain condition (Exercise 36.11). The crucial prop-
erty of Magidor’s forcing is that it preserves cardinals. The proof is a gen-
eralization of the proof for the Prikry forcing and the following is the key
lemma:
Lemma 36.10. Let σ be a sentence of the forcing language and let (g, G) be
a condition. Then there exists a stronger condition (g, H) (with the same g)
that decides σ.
⊓⊔
Magidor’s forcing changes the coﬁnality of κ to cf κ = λ, under the as-
sumption that o(κ) = λ. If λ is uncountable then by Mitchell [1984] this
assumption is necessary.
Radin forcing generalizes Prikry forcing further and uses objects called
measure sequences. Let j : V →M be an elementary embedding with critical
point κ. Let us deﬁne a sequence ⟨u(α) : α < ϑ⟩as follows:
(36.15)
u(0) = κ,
u(α) = {X ⊂Vκ : u↾α ∈j(X)}
(α > 0).
The sequence ⟨u(α)⟩α is deﬁned for all α for which u↾α ∈M. Thus the
length ϑ depends on the strength of the embedding j. For example, if j = jU
is the ultrapower embedding by a normal measure U on κ then λ = 2,
u(1) = {X ∈Vκ : {α : ⟨α⟩∈X} ∈U}
is a measure on Vκ concentrating on 1-sequences ⟨α⟩, α < κ, and ⟨u(0), u(1)⟩/∈
M = UltU. As long as u(α) is deﬁned, u(α) is a measure on Vκ concentrating
on α-sequences.
We deﬁne measure sequences as sequences obtained by (36.15) from ele-
mentary embeddings, but since we want the measures in measure sequences
to concentrate on measure sequences, the deﬁnition is as follows.
Deﬁnition 36.11 (Measure Sequences). Let
MS0 = the class of all u↾α where u is as in (36.15) for some
elementary j : V →M,
MSn+1 = {u ∈MSn : (∀α > 0) MSn ∩Vu(0) ∈u(α)},
MS = ∞
n=0 MSn = the class of all measure sequences.

36. Forcing and Large Cardinals
677
Since all the measures are σ-complete it follows that for every measure
sequence u and every 0 < α < length(u), u↾α ∈MS and MS ∩Vu(0) ∈
u(α). Clearly, some large cardinal assumption is necessary for the existence
of nontrivial measure sequences. Under the assumption of a strong cardinal,
there exist long measure sequences (Exercise 36.12).
Let U be a measure sequence of length at least 2, and let κ = U(0). We
associate with U the Radin forcing for U, RU:
A forcing condition p ∈RU is a ﬁnite sequence
⟨(u0, A0), . . . , (un, An)⟩
such that un = U, and that, letting κi = ui(0) for i = 0, . . . , n,
(i) for each i = 0, . . . , n, ui ∈MS, Ai ⊂MS and Ai ∈ui(α) for
every 0 < α < length(ui),
(ii) for each i = 0, . . . , n −1, (ui, Ai) ∈Vκi+1.
(36.16)
(Thus κ0 < κ1 < . . . < κn−1 < κn = κ. These ordinals will produce a coﬁnal
sequence in κ, a generalization of a Prikry sequence.)
A forcing condition p = ⟨(u0, A0), . . . , (un, An)⟩is stronger than
q = ⟨(v0, B0), . . . , (vm, Bm)⟩if
(i) n ≥m,
(ii) {u0, . . . , un} ⊃{v0, . . . , vm},
(iii) for each j = 0, . . . , m, if ui = vj then Ai ⊂Bj,
(iv) for each i such that ui /∈{v0, . . . , vn} if vj is the ﬁrst vj such
that ui(0) < vj(0), then ui ∈Bj and Ai ⊂Bj.
(36.17)
If U is a measure sequence of length 2, then RU is more or less the Prikry
forcing (Exercise 36.13); if U has length 3, RU produces a coﬁnal sequence
of order type ω2 (Exercise 36.14).
A generic ﬁlter G on RU produces a set
(36.18)
DG = {u : ∃p ∈G p = ⟨(ui, Ai) : i ≤n⟩and u = ui for some i < n}.
As in Prikry forcing, one proves that V [DG] = V [G]. Let
(36.19)
CG = {u(0) : u ∈DG}.
It is not diﬃcult to show:
Lemma 36.12. CG is a closed unbounded subset of κ.
Proof. Exercise 36.15.
⊓⊔
When length(U) < κ, Radin forcing is similar to Magidor’s forcing (36.13),
see Exercise 36.16.
The analog of Prikry’s Lemma 21.12 holds for Radin’s forcing as well:

Part III. Selected Topics
Lemma 36.13. Let σ be a sentence of the forcing language and let p =
⟨(ui, Ai) : i ≤n⟩be a condition. Then there exists a stronger condition
q = ⟨(ui, Bi) : i ≤n⟩(with the same {ui : i ≤n}) that decides σ.
⊓⊔
As a consequence, all cardinals are preserved in the generic extension.
Radin’s forcing is more ﬂexible than Magidor’s forcing, and under suitable
large cardinal assumptions, κ retains its regularity, or even its large cardinal
properties:
Lemma 36.14. If cf(length(U)) > κ then κ remains regular in the forcing
extension by RU.
⊓⊔
Lemma 36.15. Let j : V →M and let U ∈MS be deﬁned from j as
in (36.15).
(i) If j witnesses that κ is (κ + 2)-strong then κ remains measurable
in V RU .
(ii) If j witnesses that κ is λ-supercompact then κ remains λ-supercompact.
⊓⊔
Among applications of Radin forcing is the following theorem:
Theorem 36.16 (Mitchell). If ∃κ o(κ) = κ++ is consistent then so is
ZF + DC + “the closed unbounded forcing on ℵ1 is an ultraﬁlter.”
⊓⊔
Stationary Tower Forcing
We now describe the general version of the stationary tower forcing (Deﬁni-
tion 34.10) which can be used, among others, to change coﬁnalities in a way
that is not possible without very large cardinals.
Let A be an uncountable set. A set S ⊂P(A) is stationary in P(A) if for
every F : [A]<ω →A, S contains a closure point of F, i.e., a set X ⊂A such
that F(e) ∈X for all e ∈[X]<ω. As in Theorem 8.27, projections and liftings
of stationary sets are stationary. Also, the analog of Theorem 8.24 holds. For
the relation to stationary sets in Pκ(λ) see Exercise 36.17.
Deﬁnition 36.17 (Stationary Tower Forcing). Let δ be a Woodin car-
dinal. The forcing notion P = P<δ consists of conditions (A, S) where A ∈Vδ
is uncountable and S is stationary in P(A). (B, T) is stronger than (A, S) if
B ⊃A and T ↾A ⊂S.
If G is a generic ﬁlter on P<δ then we form the generic ultrapower UltG(V )
as in (34.10). The general form of Theorem 34.14 is as follows:
Theorem 36.18 (Woodin [1988]). Let δ be a Woodin cardinal. If G is
generic on P<δ then the generic ultrapower UltG(V ) is well-founded and the
model UltG(V ) is closed under < δ-sequences.
⊓⊔

36. Forcing and Large Cardinals

Forcing with P<δ gives more ﬂexibility than forcing with Q<δ (from Def-
inition 34.10). In a typical application, one can collapse a successor of a sin-
gular cardinal and give it any prescribed coﬁnality, see Example 36.19 below.
In fact, the consistency strength of this is exactly that of a Woodin cardinal.
Example 36.19 (Woodin). Assume that ℵω be strong limit, and let S be
the following stationary set in P(Vℵω+1):
S = {X ∈[Vℵω+1]ℵω : X ∩ℵω+1 ∈ℵω+1 and cf(X ∩ℵω+1) = ℵ3}.
Let G be a generic ﬁlter on P<δ such that (Vℵω+1, S) ∈G, let M = UltG(V )
and let j : V →M be the generic ultrapower embedding. Then crit(j) = ℵω+1
and cfM ℵω+1 = ℵ3 (Exercise 36.20). As P V [G](ωn) = P M(ωn) = P(ωn) for
all n, the forcing P<δ below (Vℵω+1, S) changes the coﬁnality of ℵω+1 to ℵ3
while preserving ℵω.

Historical Notes
Following the (unpublished) Theorem 36.2 of Woodin, Gitik proved in [1989] that
o(κ) = κ++ suﬃces for the consistency of a measurable cardinal κ with 2κ = κ++,
as well as for a model of “ℵω is strong limit and 2ℵω = ℵω+2.” In [1991], Gitik
showed that the assumption o(κ) = κ++ is necessary for the negation of SCH.
Methods for violating GCH at ℵω were originated by Magidor in [1977a, 1977b].
Woodin (unpublished) improved the method by using a (κ+2)-strong cardinal, and
Gitik [1989] obtained the result from o(κ) = κ++.
In [1983], Shelah improved Magidor’s method in the direction of getting an ar-
bitrary countable gap between ℵω and 2ℵω. In [1992], Gitik and Magidor introduced
a novel method for blowing up the power of 2κ for singular cardinals, leading to re-
sults that give the precise consistency strength (e.g., the large cardinal assumptions
for Theorem 36.5 are considerably weaker than supercompactness).
In [1991], Foreman and Woodin constructed a model in which GCH fails ev-
erywhere; this was then improved by Woodin to Theorem 36.6(i), and Cummings
followed with 36.6(ii).
Magidor’s forcing for changing coﬁnality appeared in [1978]. For Radin’s forcing,
see Radin [1982]. Our presentation is based on improvements by Mitchell [1982],
Woodin (unpublished) and Cummings [1992]. Theorem 36.16 is due to Mitchell
[1982].
Stationary tower forcing is due to Woodin.

37. Martin’s Maximum
This chapter is devoted to a generalization of the Proper Forcing Axiom.
The stronger axiom is obtained by replacing “proper notion of forcing” in
Deﬁnition 31.20 by “stationary set preserving notion of forcing.” A notion of
forcing P is stationary set preserving if every stationary set S ⊂ω1 remains
stationary in V P .
Deﬁnition 37.1 (Martin’s Maximum (MM)). If (P, <) is a stationary
set preserving notion of forcing and if D is a collection of ℵ1 dense subsets
of P, then there exists a D-generic ﬁlter on P.
As every proper notion of forcing is stationary set preserving, MM is
a strengthening of PFA which in turn is a strengthening of MA. The ax-
iom MM has been dubbed “Martin’s Maximum” as it is ostensibly the
strongest possible generalization of Martin’s Axiom: If P is not stationary
set preserving then the corresponding axiom for P is false (Exercise 37.1).
Below we establish the consistency of Martin’s Maximum, and present
some applications.
RCS iteration of semiproper forcing
The proof of the consistency of MM is modeled after the consistency proof
of either MA or PFA: By iterated forcing one obtains a generic extension in
which every stationary set preserving P satisﬁes the statement of MM.
The straightforward approach, iterating stationary set preserving forc-
ings, does not work: If g : ω1 →ω1 dominates the canonical functions fη,
η < ω2, (mod INS) then there is a stationary preserving forcing notion Pg that
produces a function f < g mod INS (and still above the fη) (Exercise 37.2).
An ω-iteration of such forcing collapses ω1.
It turns out that semiproper forcing can be iterated, yielding the consis-
tency of the following principle:
Deﬁnition 37.2 (Semiproper Forcing Axiom (SPFA)). If (P, <) is
a semiproper notion of forcing and if D is a collection of ℵ1 dense subsets
of P then there exists a D-generic ﬁlter on P.

Part III. Selected Topics
Clearly, MM implies SPFA and SPFA implies PFA. In the next section
we show that SPFA is in fact equivalent to MM and so for the consistency
of MM it is enough to construct a model of SPFA.
While under special circumstances semiproperness may by preserved un-
der countable support iteration (see Lemma 34.5), in general this is not the
case. The reason is that a semiproper forcing notion may change the coﬁnal-
ity of ordinals from uncountable to countable. (An example of such forcing
is the Prikry forcing, see Exercise 37.7.)
The iteration applicable to semiproper forcings is the revised countable
support (RCS) iteration. Informally, a support of a condition is not just
a countable set, but even a name for a countable set.
Deﬁnition 37.3. Let α ≥1. A forcing notion Pα is an RCS (revised count-
able support) iteration of { ˙Qβ : β < α} if it is an iteration (cf. Deﬁni-
tion 16.29) consisting of all α-sequences p that satisfy
(37.1)
for every q ≤p there exist a γ < α and an r ≤γ q↾γ such that
r ⊩γ cf α = ω or ∀β ≥γ p↾[γ, β) ⊩Pγ,β p(β) = 1.
In (37.1), q ranges over elements of the inverse limit of the ˙Qβ, cf. (16.12),
and Pγ,β is the restriction of the inverse limit to the interval [γ, β) = {ξ : γ ≤
ξ < β}.
The main result on RCS iterations is that they preserve semiproperness:
Theorem 37.4 (Shelah). If Pα is an RCS iteration of { ˙Qβ : β < α} such
that every ˙Qβ is a semiproper forcing notion in V Pα↾β then Pα is semiproper.
Theorem 37.4 can be proved along the lines of the proof of Theorem 31.15.
We shall outline the proof of a special case of Theorem 37.4 (Proposition 37.8
below) which suﬃces for the consistency proof of SPFA. (To be precise, Shelah
proved Theorem 37.4 for a more complicated deﬁnition of RCS iteration;
the current Deﬁnition 37.3 is based on simpliﬁcations by Schlindwein and
Donder).
A two-step iteration of semiproper forcings is semiproper, cf. Exer-
cise 37.8. The proof of Theorem 37.4 proceeds by induction, showing
(37.2)
for all γ < β ≤α, ⊩γ Bβ : Bγ is semiproper;
here Bβ = B(Pβ), and Bβ : Bγ is the complete Boolean algebra in V Pγ such
that Bγ ∗(Bβ : Bγ) = Bβ (see Exercise 16.4). One property of RCS that is
used in the proof is that Bβ :Bγ is (in V Pγ) an RCS iteration (Exercise 37.9).
The following three lemmas, special cases of Theorem 37.4, can be proved
in a similar way as Theorem 31.15:
Lemma 37.5. Let Pω be the inverse limit iteration of semiproper forcings
{ ˙Qn : n < ω}. Then Pω is semiproper.
⊓⊔

37. Martin’s Maximum
683
Lemma 37.6. Let Pω1 be a countable support iteration such that for all γ <
β < α, ⊩γ Bβ : Bγ is semiproper. Then Pω1 is semiproper.
⊓⊔
Lemma 37.7. Let λ be a regular uncountable cardinal. Assume that
(i) Pλ is a direct limit,
(ii) for every α < λ of coﬁnality ω, Pα is the inverse limit,
(iii) for all γ < β < λ, ⊩γ Bβ : Bγ is semiproper,
(iv) Pλ satisﬁes the λ-chain condition.
Then Pλ is semiproper.
⊓⊔
We shall now prove a version of Theorem 37.4 that will be used in the
consistency proof of MM:
Proposition 37.8. If Pα is an RCS iteration of semiproper forcings { ˙Qβ :
β < α} such that for every β < α, ⊩β+1 |Pβ| ≤ℵ1, then Pα is semiproper.
Proof. We proceed by induction, proving (37.2). As successor stages present
no problem, let α be a limit ordinal. By the induction hypothesis, for every
γ < β < α, ⊩γ Bβ : Bγ is semiproper; we shall prove that Pα is semiproper,
and (37.2) for α then follows by Exercise 37.8.
Case I. Let p ∈P and γ < α be such that p↾γ ⊩cf α = ω. We will show
that P↾p is semiproper. In this case, p↾γ forces that Bα : Bγ is the inverse
limit, and in fact, an inverse limit iteration of length ω of semiproper forcings,
hence semiproper by Lemma 37.5. It follows that P↾p is semiproper.
Case II. Let p ∈P be such that ∀γ < α p↾γ ⊩cf α > ω, and let γ < α be
such that p↾γ ⊩cf α = ω1. Again, we will show that P↾p is semiproper. In
this case, p↾γ forces that Bα : Bγ is a direct limit iteration of length ω1 of
semiproper forcings, and hence semiproper by Lemma 37.6. Therefore P↾p is
semiproper.
Case III. Let p ∈P be such that ∀γ < α p↾γ ⊩cf α > ℵ1; we will show that
in this case too, P↾p is semiproper. This will complete the proof that P is
semiproper.
Without loss of generality, assume that p = 1, and since Pα is in this case
a direct limit of the Pβ, it is a direct limit of the Pβi, i < cf α (where α =
limi<cf α βi), so we can assume that α is a regular cardinal. For every γ < α,
since ⊩γ+1 |Pγ| ≤ℵ1 < cf α, we have |Pγ| < α. Also since ⊩γ+1 cf α > ℵ1,
there is a stationary set of β < α (those for which ∀γ ⊩γ cf β ≥ℵ1) at which
Pβ is a direct limit. By Theorem 16.30, Pα satisﬁes the α-chain condition.
Therefore P is semiproper by Lemma 37.7.

Consistency of MM
Theorem 37.9 (Foreman, Magidor and Shelah). If there exists a su-
percompact cardinal then there is a generic model that satisﬁes MM.
Following the proof of Theorem 31.21, we construct a model that satis-
ﬁes SPFA. Instead of proper forcings, we iterated semiproper forcings, and
use the RCS iteration. At each stage α of the iteration, in addition to us-
ing the notion of forcing presented by the Laver function, we also collapse
(with countable conditions) the cardinal |Pα| to ℵ1. By Proposition 37.8,
such iteration is semiproper. An argument similar to the one in the proof of
Theorem 31.21 shows that the iteration up to a supercompact cardinal yields
a model in which SPFA holds.
The consistency of MM then follows from this result:
Theorem 37.10 (Shelah). SPFA implies that every stationary set preserv-
ing notion of forcing is semiproper. Therefore SPFA implies MM.
Proof. Let X be a set of countable elementary submodels of Hλ = (Hλ, ∈, <).
We denote X⊥the set
(37.3)
X⊥= {M ∈[Hλ]ω : M ≺Hλ and N /∈X for every countable N that
satisﬁes M ≺N ≺Hλ and N ∩ω1 = M ∩ω1}.
As in Chapter 31, we call an elementary chain (of length ϑ ≤ω1) a sequence
⟨Mα : α < ϑ⟩of countable elementary submodels of (Hλ, ∈, <) such that
Mα ⊂Mβ and Mα ∈Mβ if α < β, and Mα = 
β<α Mβ if α is a limit
ordinal. (Note that α ⊂Mα for every α.)
Lemma 37.11. Assume SPFA, and let ω1 ≤κ < λ with λ regular and
suﬃciently large. Let Y ⊂[Hκ]ω be stationary, and let X = {M ∈[Hλ]ω :
M ∩Hκ ∈Y } be the lifting of Y to Hλ. There exists an elementary chain
⟨Mα : α < ω1⟩of submodels of (Hλ, ∈, <) such that Mα ∈X ∪X⊥for
every α.
Proof. Let P be the notion of forcing that shoots an elementary chain through
X ∪X⊥: Conditions are elementary chains ⟨Mα : α ≤γ⟩in X ∪X⊥where
γ is a countable ordinal; a stronger condition is an extension. We shall prove
that P is semiproper; then, using SPFA applied to the dense sets Dξ =
{⟨Mα : α ≤γ⟩: γ ≥ξ} (cf. Exercise 37.10), we obtain an elementary chain
of length ω1 in X ∪X⊥.
To show that P is semiproper, let µ > λ be suﬃciently large, let M ≺
(Hµ, ∈, <) be countable, with P ∈M, and let p ∈P ∩M. It suﬃces (cf.
Exercise 37.6) to ﬁnd a q ≤p that is (M, P)-semigeneric.
Claim 37.12. There exists a countable N, M ≺N ≺Hµ such that N ∩ω1 =
M ∩ω1 and N ∩Hλ ∈X ∪X⊥.

37. Martin’s Maximum
685
Proof. If M ∩Hλ ∈X⊥let N = M. Otherwise, there exists a countable
N ′ ≺Hλ such that M ∩Hλ ⊂N ′, N ′∩ω1 = M ∩ω1 and N ′ ∈X. Let N be the
Skolem hull of M ∪(N ′∩Hκ) in (Hµ, ∈, <). We claim that N ∩Hκ = N ′∩Hκ;
hence N ∩ω1 = M ∩ω1 and N ∩Hκ ∈Y , hence N ∩Hλ ∈X.
The equality N ∩Hκ = N ′ ∩Hκ holds because N ∩Hκ ⊂N ′: notice that
for every Skolem function h for Hµ, h ∩Hκ ∈M ∩Hλ ⊂N ′.
⊓⊔
Continuing the proof of Lemma 37.11, let N be as in Claim 37.12. We
can ﬁnd a decreasing sequence of conditions pn ∈N with p0 = p such that
pn = ⟨Mα : α ≤γn⟩, such that every name for a countable ordinal in N is
decided by some pn (as an ordinal in N) and ∞
n=0

α≤γn Mα = N ∩Hλ. Let
γ = ∞
n=0 γn and Mγ = N ∩Hλ. Since N ∩Hλ ∈X ∪X⊥, q = ⟨Mα : α ≤γ⟩
is a condition, and is (N, P)-semigeneric. Since M ⊂N and M ∩ω1 = N ∩ω1,
q is (M, P)-semigeneric.
⊓⊔
Now we ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 37.10. Assuming SPFA, let Q be
a stationary set preserving notion of forcing that is not semiproper. Let κ
be suﬃciently large (so that all Q-names for countable ordinals are in Hκ).
Since Q is not semiproper, there exists some p ∈Q such that the set Y =
{M ≺Hκ : there exists no (M, Q)-semigeneric q ≤p} is stationary. Let λ > κ
be regular and let X be the lifting of Y to Hλ; since κ is suﬃciently large,
X = {M ≺Hλ : there is no (M, Q)-semigeneric q ≤p}. We may assume that
p = 1 is the trivial condition.
By Lemma 37.11 there exists an elementary chain ⟨Mα : α < ω1⟩in
X ∪X⊥. We claim that the set S = {α < ω1 : Mα ∈X} is nonstationary.
Assume that S is stationary and let G be a generic ﬁlter on Q. Since Q is
stationary set preserving, S is stationary in V [G]. Let ˙δξ, ξ < ω1, enumerate
all the names in 
α<ω1 Mα for countable ordinals. In V [G], let
C = {α < ω1 : Mα ∩ω1 = α and (∀ξ < α)[ ˙δξ ∈Mα and ˙δG
ξ < α]}.
The set C is closed unbounded, and if α ∈C then there exists some q ∈G
such that for every ˙δξ ∈Mα, q ⊩(∃β ∈Mα) ˙δξ = β; therefore q is (Mα, Q)-
semigeneric. Therefore S is nonstationary in V [G], and hence in V .
Thus there exists an elementary chain ⟨Mα : α < ω1⟩in X⊥. Let µ > λ be
suﬃciently large; we shall ﬁnish the proof by showing that for every countable
M ≺(Hµ, ∈, <, Q, ⟨Mα : α < ω1⟩), for every p ∈M there exists an (M, Q)-
semigeneric q ≤p.
Let M be such; if δ = M ∩ω1, then M ∩Hλ ⊃Mδ and δ = Mδ ∩ω1, and
since Mδ ∈X⊥we have M ∩Hλ /∈X and we are done.

Applications of MM
The ﬁrst application deals with cardinal arithmetic. Since MM implies PFA,
it follows (by Theorem 31.23) that 2ℵ0 = 2ℵ1 = ℵ2. It turns out that from MM
one can prove much more, including the Singular Cardinal Hypothesis:

Proof of Theorem 37.13. Let Aα, α < κ, be disjoint stationary subsets of
Eκ
ω = {ξ < κ : cf ξ = ω}. We shall prove the following claim that implies the
theorem: For every increasing f : ω1 →κ there exists an ordinal γf < κ of
coﬁnality ω1 such that
(37.4)
∀α < κ α ∈ran(f) if and only if Aα ∩γf is stationary.
(It follows that f ̸= g implies γf ̸= γg.)
Thus let f : ω1 →κ be an increasing function, and let Sα, α < ω1,
be disjoint stationary subsets of ω1 such that 
α Sα = ω1 and that for
every stationary S there exists an α such that S ∩Sα is stationary. We shall
use MM to ﬁnd a continuous increasing function F : ω1 →κ such that for
every δ < ω1, if δ ∈Sα then F(δ) ∈Af(α).
Then if we let γf = supδ<ω1 F(δ), γf ∩
α<ω1 Af(α) contains a closed
unbounded set {F(δ) : δ < ω1}, and (37.4) holds.
Let P be the following notion of forcing: A condition is a continuous
increasing function p = ⟨p(δ) : δ ≤γ⟩where γ < ω1 such that for every
δ ≤γ, if δ ∈Sα then p(δ) ∈Af(α). A stronger condition is an extension. We
will show that P is stationary set preserving and that for every α < ω1 the
set Dα = {p ∈P : α ∈dom(p)} is dense. Then MM applied to the sets Dα
produces the desired function F.
We prove the second claim ﬁrst, by induction on α. Let α be a limit
ordinal, and assume that all Dβ, β < α, are dense; let p ∈P. Let γ be such
that α ∈Sγ. Let λ be suﬃciently large, and let M ≺Hλ be a countable
model with P, p, α ∈M such that η = sup(M ∩κ) ∈Aγ (M exists because
Aγ is stationary). Let ⟨αn⟩n be an increasing sequence with limit α, and
let ⟨ηn⟩n be an increasing sequence with limit η. We construct a sequence
of conditions p = p0 ⊂p1 ⊂. . . ⊂pn ⊂. . ., each pn ∈M, as follows:
Given pn ∈M, Dαn ∈M is dense and so there exists a pn+1 ∈M such
that pn+1 ⊃pn, αn ∈dom(pn+1) and pn+1(αn + 1) ≥ηn. The function
q = ∞
n=0 pn ∪{(α, η)} is a condition, proving that Dα is dense.
Now we complete the proof by showing that P is stationary set preserving.
Let S be a stationary subset of ω1, let p ∈P and let ˙C be a name for a closed
unbounded set. We shall ﬁnd a q ≤p and some δ ∈S such that q ⊩δ ∈˙C.
Let α be such that S ∩Sα is stationary. Let λ be suﬃciently large and let
M ≺Hλ be a countable model with P, p, ˙C ∈M such that η = sup(M ∩κ) ∈

Aα and δ = M ∩ω1 ∈S ∩Sα (see Exercise 37.11). Let ⟨αn⟩n be an increasing
sequence with limit δ and let ⟨ηn⟩n be an increasing sequence with limit η. As
before, we ﬁnd a sequence of conditions p = p0 ⊂. . . ⊂pn ⊂. . . in M such
that αn ∈dom(pn+1), pn+1(αn + 1) ≥ηn, and such that for some βn ≥αn
in M, pn+1 ⊩βn ∈˙C. The function q = ∞
n=0 pn ∪{(δ, η)} is a condition and
since δ = limn βn, we have q ⊩δ ∈˙C.
⊓⊔
Another important application of MM is the saturation of the nonstation-
ary ideal on ℵ1:
Theorem 37.16 (Foreman, Magidor and Shelah). MM implies that the
nonstationary ideal on ℵ1 is ℵ2-saturated.
Proof. Assume MM and let {Ai : i ∈W} be a maximal almost disjoint
collection of stationary subsets of ω1. We shall ﬁnd a set Z ⊂W of size ≤ℵ1
such that 
i∈Z Ai contains a closed unbounded set. That will prove that
INS is ℵ2-saturated.
Let P be the set of all pairs (q, p) such that
(i) q : γ + 1 →W for some γ < ω1, and
(ii) p ⊂ω1 is a closed countable set such that α ∈p implies α ∈

ξ<α Aq(ξ).
(37.5)
A condition (q′, p′) is stronger than (q, p) if q′ ⊃q and p′ is an end-extension
of p. (See also (34.7).)
P can be viewed as a two-step iteration Q∗P ˙S where Q collapses |W| to ℵ1
with countable conditions and P ˙S shoots a closed unbounded set through
˙S = 
i∈W Ai. P is stationary set preserving: If A ⊂ω1 is stationary then
for some i ∈W, A ∩Ai is stationary and remains stationary in V Q. Hence
A∩Ai ∩˙S is stationary and remains stationary in V P . Hence A is stationary
in V P . See Exercises 34.6 and 23.6.
For each α < ω1, let Dα = {(q, p) ∈P : α ≤max(p)}. Each Dα is dense
and so by MM there is a ﬁlter G on P that meets all the Dα. Let
F = {q : (q, p) ∈G for some p},
C = {p : (q, p) ∈G for some q}.
The set C is closed unbounded, and is equal to the set {α : (∃ξ < α) α ∈
AF (ξ)} = 
i∈ran(F ) Ai.
⊓⊔
Reﬂection Principles
An important consequence of MM are reﬂection principles. These combina-
torial principles imply some major consequences of MM.

Part III. Selected Topics
Deﬁnition 37.17 (Reﬂection Principle (RP)). For every regular λ ≥ℵ2
the following holds:
RP(λ) If S is a stationary set in [λ]ω then for every X ⊂λ of cardinality ℵ1
there exists a Y ⊂λ of cardinality ℵ1 such that X ⊂Y and that
S ∩[Y ]ω is stationary in [Y ]ω.
RP follows from Martin’s Maximum, see Theorems 37.21 and 37.23 below.
One consequence of RP is that every stationary set preserving notion of
forcing is semiproper (Exercise 37.13). This in turn implies that INS on ω1
is precipitous (Foreman, Magidor and Shelah [1988], Theorem 26) and is
therefore a large cardinal property.
Theorem 37.18 (Todorˇcevi´c). RP(ω2) implies that 2ℵ0 ≤ℵ2.
Proof. One can show that RP(λ) implies a stronger version of RP(λ), namely
that S ∩[Y ]ω is stationary for stationary many Y ∈[λ]ℵ1 (Exercise 37.14).
If ω1 ≤α < ω2, let Cα be a closed unbounded subset of [α]ω of order-
type ω1, and let D = 
ω1≤α<ω2 Cα. Since |Cα| = ℵ1 for each α, we have
|D| = ℵ2. By RP(ω2), D contains a closed unbounded set: Otherwise, if
S = [ω2]ω −D is stationary, there exists an α ≥ω1 such that S ∩[α]ω is
stationary, a contradiction.
By a theorem of Baumgartner and Taylor ([1982], Theorem 3.2(a)), every
closed unbounded subset of [ω2]ω has size at least 2ℵ0. Therefore 2ℵ0 ≤ℵ2.
⊓⊔
RP(ω2) is not very strong; its consistency follows from a weakly compact
cardinal (a modiﬁcation of Theorem 23.23).
Deﬁnition 37.19. A set S ⊂[λ]ω is projective stationary if for every sta-
tionary set T ⊂ω1, the set {X ∈S : X ∩ω1 ∈T } is stationary.
(Equivalently, for every closed unbounded C ⊂[λ]ω, the projection
(S ∩C)↾ω1 contains a closed unbounded set.)
Deﬁnition 37.20 (Strong Reﬂection Principle SRP). For every regular
λ ≥ℵ2, the following holds:
SRP(λ) If S is projective stationary in [Hλ]ω then there exists an elementary
chain ⟨Mα : α < ω1⟩of countable models such that Mα ∈S for all α.
Theorem 37.21. MM implies SRP.
Proof. Let S ⊂[Hκ]ω be projective stationary. Let P be the forcing notion
that shoots an elementary chain through S: Conditions are elementary chains
⟨Mα : α ≤γ⟩where γ < ω1 and Mα ∈S for all α ≤γ. We will show
that P is stationary set preserving; then if G is a ﬁlter on P that meets
{p ∈P : α ∈dom(p)} for each α < ω1,  G is an elementary chain in S.

Let T ⊂ω1 be stationary, let ˙C be a P-name for a closed unbounded set,
and let p ∈P. We shall ﬁnd a q ≤p and a δ ∈T such that q ⊩δ ∈˙C. Let λ be
suﬃciently large and let M ≺(Hλ, ∈, <, P, ˙C, S, T, p) be a countable model
such that M ∩Hκ ∈S and δ = M ∩ω1 ∈T . Let p = p0 ≥. . . ≥pn ≥. . .

n<ω Mγn. If
we let q = 
n<ω pn ∪{(δ, M ∩Hκ)}, then q is a condition and q ⊩δ ∈˙C.
⊓⊔
Theorem 37.22. SRP implies that the nonstationary ideal on ω1 is ℵ2-
saturated.
Proof. Assume SRP and let W be a maximal antichain of stationary subsets
of ω1. We will show that |W| ≤ℵ1. Consider the set
S = {M ∈[Hω2]ω : M ≺Hω2, W ∈M and ∃A ∈W ∩M (M ∩ω1 ∈A)}.
We claim that S is projective stationary. Let T ⊂ω1 be stationary and let
A ∈W be such that T ∩A is stationary. Let C be a closed unbounded set
in [Hω2]ω. Then there exists a model M ∈C such that M ∩ω1 ∈A ∩T ;
hence S is projective stationary. By SRP there exists an elementary chain
⟨Mα : α < ω1⟩such that Mα ∈S for all α. Let M = 
α<ω1 Mα; we shall
ﬁnish the proof by showing that W ⊂M.
Let A ∈W and assume that A /∈M. Let N be the Skolem hull of
M ∪{A} and for each α, let Nα be the Skolem hull of Mα ∪{A}. Let C be
the closed unbounded set of all α < ω1 such that Mα ∩ω1 = Nα ∩ω1 = α,
and let α ∈C ∩A. Since Mα ∈S, there exists some B ∈W ∩Mα such
that α ∈B. As A ∩B is nonstationary and A, B ∈Nα, there exists a closed
unbounded set D ∈Nα such that A ∩B ∩D = ∅. This is a contradiction,
since α = Nα ∩ω1 ∈D, and also α ∈A and α ∈B.
⊓⊔
Theorem 37.23. For every regular λ ≥ω2, SRP(λ) implies RP(λ).
Proof. Assuming SRP(λ) we prove a stronger version of RP(λ):
(37.6)
If S is a stationary set in [Hλ]ω then there exists an elementary chain
⟨Mα : α < ω1⟩such that {α : Mα ∈S} is stationary.
Let S ⊂[Hλ]ω be stationary. By Exercise 37.19 (since INS is ℵ2-saturated
by SRP(ω2)), there exists a stationary A ⊂ω1 such that for every stationary
B ⊂A, the set {M ∈S : M ∩ω1 ∈B} is stationary. Therefore the set
{M : M ∈S or M ∩ω1 /∈A} is projective stationary, and by SRP(λ)
contains an elementary chain ⟨Mα : α < ω1⟩. It follows that Mα ∈S for
every α ∈A.
⊓⊔
We mention two other consequences of SRP: the Singular Cardinal Hy-
pothesis (Todorˇcevi´c, Exercise 37.20) and 2ℵ0 = ℵ2 (Woodin [1999], Theo-
rem 9.82, proves that SRP(ω2) implies δ1
2 = ℵ2).

Forcing Axioms
Martin’s Maximum (as well as MA and PFA) are principles that postulate
the existence of suﬃciently generic ﬁlter on every forcing notion of a given
kind. In general, let P be a class of forcing notions.
Deﬁnition 37.24 (MA(P)). If P is a forcing notion in P and if {Dα :
α < ω1} are dense (or predense) subsets of P, then there exists a ﬁlter G
on P that meets all the Dα.
Thus MA(c.c.c.) is MAℵ1, MA(proper) is PFA and MA(semiproper) =
MA(stationary set preserving) is SPFA = MM. A useful strengthening of
a given forcing axiom is the following:
Deﬁnition 37.25 (MA+(P)). If P is a forcing notion in P, if {Dα : α < ω1}
are dense (or predense) subsets of P and if ˙S is a name of a subset of ω1 such
that ⊩˙S is stationary, then there exists a ﬁlter G on P that meets all the Dα,
and ˙SG = {α : ∃p ∈G p ⊩α ∈˙S} is stationary.
MM+ is stronger than MM; its consistency follows by a modiﬁcation
of the proof of Theorem 37.9. While MA+
ℵ1 is equivalent to MAℵ1 (Exer-
cise 37.22), MA+(P) is generally stronger than MA(P). A useful special case
is MA+(ω-closed). Among others, it implies the Reﬂection Principle RP and is
therefore a large cardinal axiom. Moreover, it implies (37.6) (Exercise 37.23)
and hence SCH. The following theorem shows that MA+(ω-closed) follows
from MM:
Theorem 37.26 (Shelah). MM implies MA+(ω-closed).
Proof. Assume MM and let P be ω-closed, D a family of ℵ1 dense subsets
of P and ˙S a P-name for a stationary set. Let {Ai : i ∈W} be a maximal
antichain of those stationary sets for which ⊩P Ai ∩˙S is nonstationary.
By MM, |W| ≤ℵ1. Let A = 
i∈W Ai be the diagonal union and let T =
ω1 −A. We have ⊩P ˙S −T is nonstationary (hence T is stationary) and for
every stationary X ⊂T there exists some p ∈P such that p ⊩˙S ∩X is
stationary.
Let Q be the countable support product of ω1 copies of P; let Qα = P
and ˙Sα = ˙S. For every stationary X ⊂T and every q ∈Q there exist some
q′ ≤q and α < ω1 such that q′ ⊩˙Sα ∩X is stationary. It follows that for
every stationary X ⊂T , ⊩Q X ∩
α<ω1 ˙Sα is stationary. In V Q, let ˙R be the
forcing notion that shoots a closed unbounded set ˙C through A ∪
α<ω1 ˙Sα
(with countable conditions). It follows that Q ∗˙R preserves stationary sets.
By MM there exists a ﬁlter G×H on Q∗˙R such that each Gα = G↾Qα is
D-generic, that for all α and β, G meets {q ∈Q : q decides α ∈˙Sβ}, and that
for each α, G × H meets {(q, r) : max(r) ≥α}. Then C = ˙CG×H is a closed
unbounded set and A ∪
α<ω1 ˙SG
α ⊃C. Therefore there exists some α such
that ˙SGα
α
is stationary, and MA+(ω-closed) follows.
⊓⊔

37. Martin’s Maximum

While PFA is a large cardinal axiom and implies that 2ℵ0 = ℵ2 there
are weaker versions that do not need large cardinals, and are consistent with
c > ℵ2: For instance, there is a class P of proper forcings that includes,
among others, the forcings for adding Cohen reals, Sacks reals, Mathias reals
and Laver reals and MA(P) is consistent (relative to ZFC) with 2ℵ0 > ℵ2
(Groszek and Jech [1991]).
Finally, forcing axioms can be further modiﬁed by restricting the size of
predense sets that the ﬁlter should meet. If only Dα of size ≤ℵ1 are involved,
these are known as bounded forcing axioms:
Deﬁnition 37.27 (Bounded MA(P)). If P is a forcing notion in P and if
{Dα : α < ω1} are predense subsets of P such that |Dα| ≤ℵ1 for all α, then
there exists a ﬁlter G on P that meets all the Dα.
The consistency strength of Bounded PFA is below a Mahlo cardinal
(Goldstern and Shelah [1995]). An interesting equivalence for Bounded MM
was proved by Bagaria:
Theorem 37.28 (Bagaria [2000]). Bounded MM holds if and only if for
every stationary set preserving forcing notion P,
(Hω2, ∈) ≺Σ1 (Hω2, ∈)V P .

38. More on Stationary Sets
Stationary sets play a central role in several areas of set theory. In this ﬁnal
chapter we address some of the issues dealing with stationary sets.
The Nonstationary Ideal on ℵ1
The question of considerable interest is whether the ideal INS on ℵ1 can be
ℵ2-saturated. By Theorem 37.16, the saturation of INS follows from MM, and
thus is consistent relative to a supercompact cardinal. This can be improved:
Theorem 38.1 (Shelah). If there exists a Woodin cardinal then there is
a generic model in which the nonstationary ideal on ℵ1 is ℵ2-saturated.
Proof (sketch). The model is constructed by an RCS iteration (up to a
Woodin cardinal), as in the proof of Theorem 37.9, iterating the forcings
described in (37.5), for those maximal antichains for which the forcing (37.5)
is semiproper. An argument similar to the one used in the proof of Theo-
rem 34.8 shows that in the resulting model, INS is saturated.
⊓⊔
Combining this result with Steel’s Theorem 35.21, it follows that the
consistency strength of the saturation of INS is approximately that of the
existence of a Woodin cardinal.
In contrast to that, the consistency strength of the precipitousness of INS
is only that of the existence of a measurable cardinal (Theorems 22.33
and 23.10).
A σ-complete ideal I on ω1 is ω1-dense if the Boolean algebra P(ω1)/I
has a dense subset of size ℵ1. Clearly, every (nontrivial) ω1-dense ideal is ℵ2-
saturated. The following result (that we state without proof) shows that the
consistency strength of “INS is ω1-dense” is exactly the existence of inﬁnitely
many Woodin cardinals.
Theorem 38.2 (Woodin). The following are equiconsistent:
(i) INS is ω1-dense.
(ii) AD holds in L(R).

The saturation of the nonstationary ideal implies (almost) that the Con-
tinuum Hypothesis fails:
Theorem 38.3 (Woodin). If INS is ℵ2-saturated and if there exists a mea-
surable cardinal, then δ1
2 = ℵ2 (and hence 2ℵ0 ≥ℵ2).
⊓⊔
Note that the construction in the proof of Theorem 34.8 yields a model
in which for some stationary set A, the ideal INS↾A is ℵ2-saturated and the
Continuum Hypothesis holds.
Saturation and Precipitousness
By Theorem 23.17, the nonstationary ideal on κ is not κ+-saturated, for
any κ ≥ℵ2. The proof of Theorem 23.17 yields a somewhat stronger result:
If κ and λ are regular cardinals such that λ+ < κ, then INS↾Eκ
λ is not
κ+-saturated. Theorem 38.4 below shows that the saturation of INS↾Reg is
consistent (and not particularly strong). It remains open whether for a regular
uncountable cardinal κ, INS↾Eκ+
κ
can be κ++-saturated.
Let κ be a regular cardinal and let α < κ+. The cardinal κ is α-Mahlo
if the order of κ (as deﬁned in Chapter 8) is at least κ + α. (Thus 0-Mahlo
means weakly inaccessible, 1-Mahlo means weakly Mahlo, etc.)
Theorem 38.4.
(i) Let κ be an α-Mahlo cardinal, with 0 < α < κ+. If INS↾Reg is κ+-
saturated then κ is a measurable cardinal of Mitchell order at least α
in the model Km.
(ii) Let κ be a measurable cardinal of Mitchell order α, with 0 < α < κ+.
There is a generic model in which κ is α-Mahlo and INS↾Reg is κ+-
saturated.
Proof. Cf. Jech and Woodin [1985]. For (i), see Exercise 38.1.
⊓⊔
By Theorem 23.10, the existence of a measurable cardinal is suﬃcient for
the construction of a generic model in which the ideal INS on ω1 is precipitous.
The construction generalizes to obtain the precipitousness of INS↾Eκ+
κ , for
every regular cardinal κ. For the precipitousness of the entire ideal INS on
κ ≥ℵ2, more than measurability is needed. For instance:
Theorem 38.5. The following are equiconsistent:
(i) INS on ℵ2 is precipitous.
(ii) There exists a measurable cardinal of Mitchell order 2.
Proof. Cf. Gitik [1984]. For the lower bound, see Exercise 38.2.
⊓⊔
The consistency strength of the precipitousness of INS on κ ≥ℵ3 is more
than o(κ) = κ+. In [1997], Gitik calculated the exact strength for successors
or regulars, and nearly optimal lower and upper bounds for inaccessible κ (in
both cases, it is the Mitchell order between κ+ and κ++). For successors of
singulars the consistency strength is in the region of Woodin cardinals.

Reﬂection
Let κ ≥ℵ2 be a regular cardinal. A stationary set S ⊂κ reﬂects at α < κ if
S ∩α is stationary in α (see Deﬁnition 23.5). We shall now discuss brieﬂy to
what extent can stationary sets reﬂect.
First we consider the property “every stationary set S ⊂κ reﬂects (at
some α < κ).” This implies that κ is either (weakly) inaccessible or the
successor of a singular cardinal, because if κ = λ+ with λ regular, the set Eλ+
λ
does not reﬂect (see Exercise 23.4). Let κ be an inaccessible cardinal. If κ is
weakly compact then every stationary S ⊂κ reﬂects (Corollary 17.20). If
V = L then the converse is true as well: If every stationary set reﬂects then
κ is weakly compact (Jensen [1972], Theorem 6.1).
Following Mekler and Shelah [1989], let us call κ a reﬂecting cardinal if
there exists a normal ideal I on κ such that for every X ∈I+, {α ∈κ :
X reﬂects at α} ∈I+. Every weakly compact cardinal is reﬂecting, and since
being a reﬂecting cardinal is a Π1
1 property (see Exercise 38.3), every weakly
compact cardinal is a limit of reﬂecting cardinals.
Theorem 38.6. The following are equiconsistent:
(i) There exists a cardinal κ such that every stationary S ⊂κ reﬂects.
(ii) There exists a reﬂecting cardinal.
Proof. Mekler and Shelah [1989].
⊓⊔
A cardinal κ is greatly Mahlo if κ is α-Mahlo for every α < κ+. If V = L
then every reﬂecting cardinal is greatly Mahlo and a limit of greatly Mahlo
cardinals (Mekler and Shelah [1989]). Thus the consistency strength of “every
stationary set reﬂects” is strictly between “greatly Mahlo” and “weakly com-
pact.”
Now let κ be a successor of a singular cardinal λ. The property “every
stationary set S ⊂λ+ reﬂects” is a very large cardinal property. On the one
hand there is this consistency result:
Theorem 38.7. If there exist inﬁnitely many supercompact cardinals, then
there is a generic model in which every stationary set S ⊂ℵω+1 reﬂects.
Proof. Magidor [1982].
⊓⊔
On the other hand, □λ implies that there exists a stationary subset of λ+
that does not reﬂect (Exercise 38.5). As □λ holds in the core model Kstrong
then if (λ+)Kstrong = λ+, □λ holds in V as well (with the same square se-
quence) and one concludes (by Theorem 35.19) that if λ is a strong limit
singular cardinal and every S ⊂λ reﬂects then there exists an inner model
for a strong cardinal. This has been extended by Schimmerling and others to
show that the consistency strength of this reﬂection property is more than
the existence of a Woodin cardinal.

698
Part III. Selected Topics
Now consider the question of what is the largest possible extent of re-
ﬂection. Let us recall (Deﬁnition 8.18) that S < T means that S reﬂects at
almost all α ∈T . If S < T then o(S) < o(T ) and one may ask whether it is
possible that S < T holds whenever o(S) < o(T ). This is possible for κ = ℵ2:
By Magidor’s Theorem 23.23 it is consistent that every stationary S ⊂Eω2
ω
reﬂects at almost all α of coﬁnality ω1.
For κ > ℵ2 it is impossible that S < T whenever o(S) < o(T ). If µ < λ are
regular cardinals such that λ+ < κ then there exist stationary sets S ⊂Eκ
µ
and A ⊂Eκ
λ such that S does not reﬂect at any α ∈A (Exercise 38.7). Thus
let us restrict ourselves to reﬂection at regular cardinals.
Deﬁnition 38.8. A weakly inaccessible cardinal κ satisﬁes full reﬂection if
for every stationary set S ⊂κ and every stationary set T ⊂κ of regular
cardinals, o(S) < o(T ) implies S < T .
Obviously, the property is meaningful only if κ is at least a (weakly)
Mahlo cardinal. The consistency strength of full reﬂection for cardinals in
the Mahlo hierarchy has been established by Jech and Shelah. For instance:
Theorem 38.9. The following are equiconsistent, for every n ≥1:
(i) There exists an n-Mahlo cardinal that satisﬁes full reﬂection.
(ii) There exists a Π1
n-indescribable cardinal.
Proof. Jech and Shelah [1993]. See also Exercises 38.8 and 38.9.
⊓⊔
If κ is a large cardinal such as measurable, strong, or supercompact then
there is a generic extension in which κ remains measurable (strong, super-
compact) and in addition satisﬁes full reﬂection (Gitik and Witzany [1996]).
Stationary Sets in Pκ(λ)
By Theorem 8.28, the closed unbounded ﬁlter on [λ]ω is generated by the
sets CF = {x ∈[λ]ω : x is closed under F} where F : [λ]<ω →λ. Thus
in many applications one considers the space [Hλ]ω and stationary sets are
those S ⊂[Hλ]ω such that for every model (Hλ, ∈, . . .) there exists an M ∈S
with M ≺(Hλ, ∈, . . .).
When κ > ℵ1, the sets CF do not generate the closed unbounded ﬁlter
on Pκ(λ) as the set {x ∈Pκ(λ) : |x| ≥ℵ1} is closed unbounded and does
not include any CF (which contains a countable set). A generalization of
Theorem 8.28 yields the following description of the closed unbounded ﬁlter:
it is the ﬁlter generated by the sets CF and the set {x ∈Pκ(λ) : x ∩κ ∈κ}
(Exercise 38.10; see also Exercises 8.18, 8.19 and 36.17). For more on this
subject, see Exercises 38.11 and 38.12.
By Lemma 31.3, ω-closed forcing preserves stationary sets in [λ]ω. This
does not generalize to Pκ(λ) for κ > ℵ1, as <κ-closed forcing may destroy

38. More on Stationary Sets
699
stationary sets in Pκ(λ). The following concept is relevant to this problem
and has other applications:
A model M ≺Hλ is internally approachable if there exists an elemen-
tary chain ⟨Mα : α < γ⟩with M = 
α<γ Mα such that for every β < γ,
⟨Mα : α < β⟩∈M. In Pκ(Hλ), let IA denote the set of all internally ap-
proachable M. The set IA is stationary, and if κ = ℵ1 then IA contains
a closed unbounded set (since every countable M is internally approachable).
A stationary set S is preserved by <κ-closed forcing if and only if S ∩IA is
stationary (Exercises 38.13 and 38.14).
By Theorem 8.10, every stationary subset of κ can be partitioned into
κ disjoint stationary sets. The situation is more complicated for Pκ(λ). Since
|Pκ(λ)| = λ<κ we may ask whether stationary sets in Pκ(λ) can be parti-
tioned into λ<κ disjoint stationary sets. This is generally not provable, for
two reasons. One is cardinal arithmetic and the other are large cardinals.
The cardinal arithmetic reason is that there may exist stationary, or even
closed unbounded, sets of size λ while λ<κ > λ. For instance, there exists
a stationary set S ⊂[ω2]ω of size ℵ2 (Exercise 38.15), or a closed unbounded
set C ⊂[ω4]ω2 of cardinality ℵℵ1
4
(Exercise 38.16).
A generalization of Solovay’s proof of Theorem 8.10 gives that every sta-
tionary set in Pκ(λ) can be partitioned into κ disjoint stationary sets (Ex-
ercise 38.18). This is best possible as Gitik [1985] constructs a model, using
a supercompact cardinal, in which there is a stationary set S ⊂Pκ(κ+) that
cannot be partitioned into κ+ disjoint stationary sets.
In view of this discussion, the following is best possible:
Theorem 38.10. Let κ be regular uncountable and λ ≥κ.
(i) Pκ(λ) can be partitioned into λ disjoint stationary sets.
(ii) If κ is a successor cardinal then every stationary subset of Pκ(λ) can
be partitioned into λ disjoint stationary sets.
(iii) If 0♯does not exist then every stationary subset of Pκ(λ) can be par-
titioned into λ disjoint stationary sets.
(iv) If GCH holds then Pκ(λ) can be partitioned into λ<κ stationary sets,
and if moreover 0♯does not exist then every stationary subset of Pκ(λ)
can be partitioned into λ<κ disjoint stationary sets.
Proof. Let us consider the following set
(38.1)
E = {x ∈Pκ(λ) : |x ∩κ| = |x|}.
It is easy to see that E is stationary and that if κ is a successor cardinal
then E contains a closed unbounded subset (Exercise 38.19). The question
whether, for an inaccessible κ, the complement of E is stationary, involves
large cardinals; cf. the following lemma and Exercise 38.20.
Lemma 38.11. If {x ∈Pκ(λ) : |x ∩κ| < |x|} is stationary then 0♯exists.

Part III. Selected Topics
Proof. By the assumption there exists a model M ∈Pκ(Lλ) such that κ ∈
M ≺Lλ, κM = M ∩κ ∈κ, and κM < |M|. Let Lα be the transitive collapse
of M. Thus there is an elementary embedding j : Lα →Lλ with critical
point κM, and since κM < |α|, 0♯exists.
⊓⊔
Consequently, the following two lemmas will complete the proof of Theo-
rem 38.10:
Lemma 38.12. Every stationary subset of the set E can be partitioned into
λ disjoint stationary sets.
Lemma 38.13. If GCH holds and if cf λ < κ then every stationary set
in Pκ(λ) can be partitioned into λ+ disjoint stationary sets.
Proof of Lemma 38.12. Assume that λ > κ (if λ = κ we have Theorem 8.10).
Let S be a stationary set in Pκ(λ) such that |x ∩κ| = |x| for every x ∈S.
For each x ∈S, let fx : x →x ∩κ be one-to-one. For each α < λ, let
gα(x) = fx(α), for all x ∈S with α ∈x. There exists a stationary set Sα
such that gα is constant on Sα, with value γα < κ.
Now if µ is any regular cardinal with κ < µ ≤λ, there exists a γ < κ
such that γα = γ for µ many α’s. The corresponding sets Sα are pairwise
disjoint stationary subsets of S. Thus for every regular cardinal µ ≤λ, every
stationary subset of E has µ pairwise disjoint stationary subsets. It follows
easily that every S ⊂E can be partitioned into λ disjoint stationary sets.
⊓⊔
Proof of Lemma 38.13. Assume GCH and let λ > κ be such that cf λ < κ.
First we note that |Pκ(λ)| = λ+, and that every unbounded (and there-
fore every stationary) subset of |Pκ(λ)| has size λ+: If Y is unbounded then
Pκ(λ) = 
x∈Y P(x) and the assertion follows.
Let ⟨fα : α < λ+⟩enumerate the set of all functions fα : [λ]<ω →Pκ(λ)
such that each function appears coﬁnally often. By Lemma 8.26, for every
closed unbounded set C and every γ < λ+ there exists an α > γ such that
C ⊃C(fα) = {x : f(e) ⊂x whenever e ⊂x}.
Now let S be a stationary set in Pκ(λ). By induction on α < λ+ we
construct one-to-one sequences ⟨xα
ξ : ξ < α⟩such that {xα
ξ : ξ < α} ⊂
S ∩C(fα), and that {xα
ξ : ξ < α} and {xβ
ξ : ξ < β} are disjoint whenever
α ̸= β. If we let, for each ξ < λ+, Sξ = {xα
ξ : ξ < α < λ+}, the sets Sξ,
ξ < λ+, are pairwise disjoint, and we complete the proof by showing that
each Sξ is stationary.
If C is closed unbounded, then C ⊃C(fα) for some α > ξ, and since
xα
ξ ∈Sξ ∩C(fα), we have Sξ ∩C nonempty.
⊓⊔
By Theorem 23.17 the nonstationary ideal on κ is not κ+-saturated, for
any κ ≥ℵ2. A similar result is true for the nonstationary ideal on Pκ(λ):
Theorem 38.14. If κ is a regular uncountable cardinal and λ > κ then the
nonstationary ideal on Pκ(λ) is not λ+-saturated.
⊓⊔

38. More on Stationary Sets
701
The result follows easily from Theorem 23.17 when λ is regular: Let κ < λ
be regular uncountable. The proof of Theorem 23.17 shows that there are
almost disjoint stationary sets Aξ ⊂λ, ξ < λ+, such that cf α < κ for all
α ∈Aξ and all ξ < λ+. For each ξ let Sξ = {x ∈Pκ(λ) : sup x ∈Aξ}.
Then Sξ, ξ < λ+, are stationary sets with Sξ ∩Sη nonstationary if ξ ̸= η
(Exercise 38.21).
When λ is singular, the result is a combination of several cases, depending
on κ and cf λ. The nonsaturation of INS on [λ]ω for singular λ is an application
of the concept of mutually stationary sets that we shall brieﬂy describe in
the next section (see Corollary 38.17).
Mutually Stationary Sets
The following deﬁnition, due to Foreman and Magidor, exploits the fact that
if κ is a regular cardinal and λ > κ then a set S ⊂κ is stationary if and
only if for every model A = ⟨Hλ, ∈, . . .⟩there exists some M ≺A such that
sup(M ∩κ) ∈S; i.e., if and only if the set {M ∈P(Hλ) : sup(M ∩κ) ∈S}
is stationary in P(Hλ).
Deﬁnition 38.15. Let A be a set of regular cardinals and let λ = sup A.
The sets Sκ, κ ∈A, where Sκ ⊂κ for each κ ∈A, are mutually stationary if
the set {M : sup(M ∩κ) ∈Sκ for every κ ∈M} is stationary in P(Hλ).
Not much is known about mutual stationarity beyond the following the-
orem:
Theorem 38.16 (Foreman-Magidor). Let A be a set of regular cardi-
nals with λ = sup A. If for each κ, Sκ is a stationary subset of κ such that
cf α = ω for every α ∈Sκ, then the Sκ are mutually stationary. For every
A = ⟨Hλ, ∈, . . .⟩there exists a countable M ≺A such that sup(M ∩x) ∈Sκ
for every κ ∈M.
Proof. Foreman and Magidor [2001].
⊓⊔
One consequence of this result is that the nonstationary ideal on [λ]ω is
not λ+-saturated when λ is singular:
Corollary 38.17. If λ is a limit cardinal then there exist stationary station-
ary sets Sξ, ξ < λcf λ, in [λ]ω such that Sξ ∩Sη is nonstationary whenever
ξ ̸= η.
Proof. Let µ = cf λ and let A = {κα : α < µ} be a set of regular cardinals
with limit λ. For each α < µ, let {Sα
β : β < κα} be a partition of Eκα
ω
into
κα disjoint stationary sets. For each function f ∈
α<µ κα, let Sf = {M ∈
[λ]ω : sup(M ∩κα) ∈Sα
f(α) for all α ∈M}. The sets Sf are stationary in [λ]ω
and if f ̸= g then for any α with f(α) ̸= g(α), the closed unbounded set
{M : α ∈M} is disjoint from Sf ∩Sg.

Weak Squares
The theory of inner models shows that in the absence of very large cardinals,
Jensen’s principle □κ holds whenever κ is a singular cardinal. In this last
section we take a look at some weaker versions of Square.
Deﬁnition 38.18. Let κ be an uncountable cardinal, and let ν be a cardinal,
1 ≤ν ≤κ; □κ,ν is as follows:
(□κ,ν) There exists a sequence ⟨Cα : α ∈Lim(κ+)⟩such that
(i) Cα is nonempty and |Cα| ≤ν, and each C ∈Cα is a closed
unbounded subset of α;
(ii) if C ∈Cα and β ∈Lim(C) then C ∩β ∈Cβ;
(iii) if cf α < κ then |C| < κ for every C ∈Cα.
(38.2)
The principle □κ,<ν is deﬁned similarly, replacing |Cα| ≤ν by |Cα| < ν.
The weakest principle of these, □κ,κ, is also denoted by □∗
κ and is called
Weak Square. By Jensen [1972], □∗
κ is equivalent to the existence of a special
Aronszajn κ+-tree, and therefore, if κ is regular, □∗
κ follows from 2κ = κ+.
The main interest in the principles □κ,ν and □κ,<ν is in the case when κ is
a singular cardinal. The failure of □∗
κ for κ singular (which, as mentioned
below, entails a Woodin cardinal) is consistent: In [1979] Shelah proved the
consistency, relative to a supercompact cardinal, of the negation of □∗
ℵω.
The failure of Weak Square for singular κ has the consistency strength
of (roughly) at least one Woodin cardinal: If there is a measurable cardinal
and there is no inner model for the Woodin cardinal, then □κ,cf κ holds for
every strong limit singular cardinal. This follows from results of Mitchell,
Schimmerling and Steel; cf. Schimmerling [1995].
Exercise 38.5 shows that if □κ holds then κ+ has a nonreﬂecting sta-
tionary set. The proof is easily modiﬁed to show that □κ,<ω suﬃces, see
Exercise 38.23. (In contrast, □ℵω,ω is consistent with “every stationary sub-
set of ℵω+1 reﬂects;” cf. Cummings, Foreman and Magidor [2001].)
The proof of Theorem 31.28 can be modiﬁed to show that PFA implies
the negation of □κ,ω1 for every κ ≥ω1; see Exercise 38.24. This, and the
afore mentioned results on □κ,cf κ and Woodin cardinals yields Schimmer-
ling’s Theorem 31.30.
As a ﬁnal application of weak squares we mention the following; for sim-
plicity, let κ = ℵω. By the pcf theory there exists a scale ⟨fα : α < ℵω+1⟩
in 
n∈A ℵn (mod ﬁnite) for some A ⊂ω. If □ℵω,ℵm holds for some m, then
there exists a scale ⟨gα : α < ℵω+1⟩with this property:
(38.3)
For every α < ℵω+1 such that cf α > ω there exists a closed un-
bounded set C ⊂α and some k such that for all β < γ in C and all
n ≥k in A, gβ(n) < gγ(n).
(See Exercise 38.25.) Such scales were used in Cummings, Foreman and Magi-
dor [2001] to prove (negative) results on stationary reﬂection.

(ii) If κ is a successor cardinal then E contains a closed unbounded subset.
38.20. If κ is supercompact and λ > κ then the set {x ∈Pκ(λ) : |x ∩κ| < |x|} is
stationary.
38.21. Let κ < λ be regular uncountable and let A ⊂λ be such that cf α < κ
for all α ∈A. A is stationary if and only if {x ∈Pκ(λ) : sup x ∈A} is stationary
in Pκ(λ).
38.22. If κ is supercompact then for all λ ≥κ, □λ,<κ fails.
38.23. If □κ,<ω holds then for every stationary S ⊂κ+ there exists a stationary
T ⊂S that does not reﬂect.
[Let ⟨Cα : α < κ+⟩be a □κ,<ω sequence and let f(α) = {o.t.(C) : C ∈Cα}.
Then proceed as in Exercise 38.5.]
38.24. PFA implies that □κ,ω1 fails for every uncountable cardinal κ.
[Let ⟨Cα : α < κ+⟩be a □κ,ω1 sequence, and let T be the tree of all (α, A)
with A ∈Cα, ordered by (α, A) ≺(β, B) if and only if α ∈Lim(B) and A =
B ∩α. Let P = {p ⊂κ+ : p is closed and countable}, ordered by end-extension.
In V P , T↾S ˙G has no ω1-branch. Let ˙Q be the c.c.c. forcing that specializes T↾S ˙G.
Applying PFA to P ∗˙Q leads to a contradiction as in Theorem 31.28. For details,
see Schimmerling [1995].]

38.25. Prove (38.3) using □ℵω,ℵm.
[Let ⟨Cα : α < ℵω+1⟩be a □ℵω,ℵm sequence, and assume that m < n for all
n ∈A. For a limit γ, let gγ be such that gγ > gα for all α < γ, gγ(n) > fγ(n)
for all n ∈A, and such that for all n ∈A, gγ(n) > sup{supβ∈C gβ(n) : C ∈Cγ,
|C| < ℵn}.]
Historical Notes
The ﬁrst consistency proof for the saturation of INS was obtained by Steel and
van Wesep [1982], forcing over a model of ZF + ADR + “Θ is regular” (ADR is
the determinacy of games where moves are real numbers). Following the proof of
Theorem 37.16 (by Foreman, Magidor and Shelah), Shelah obtained the consistency
from the existence of a Woodin cardinal (Theorem 38.1).
Theorem 38.2 will appear in the forthcoming book on AD, cf. Woodin et al. [∞].
Theorem 38.3 is proved in Woodin [1999].
Theorem 38.4: Jech and Woodin [1985].
Theorem 38.5: Gitik [1984].
Theorem 38.6: Mekler and Shelah [1989].
Theorem 38.9: Jech and Shelah [1993].
Theorem 38.10 is a combination of several results, including Jech [1972/73],
Matsubara [1987], [1988] and [1990], Di Prisco and Baumgartner.
Lemma 38.11: Baumgartner.
Lemma 38.12: Di Prisco.
Lemma 38.13: Matsubara.
Theorem 38.14 is a combination of several results, including Gitik and She-
lah [1997], Baumgartner and Taylor [1982], Donder and Matet [1993], Burke and
Matsubara [1999] and Foreman and Magidor [2001].
Mutually stationary sets are investigated in Foreman and Magidor [2001].
For weak squares, see Schimmerling [1995] and Cummings, Foreman and Magi-
dor [2001].

SpringerMonographs inMathematics
This series publishes advanced monographs giving well-written presentations of the “state-of-the-art”
in ﬁelds of mathematical research that have acquired the maturity needed for such a treatment. They
are sufﬁciently self-contained to be accessible to more than just the intimate specialists of the subject,
and sufﬁciently comprehensive to remain valuable references for many years. Besides the current state
of knowledge in its ﬁeld, an SMM volume should also describe its relevance to and interaction with
neighbouring ﬁelds of mathematics, and give pointers to future directions of research.
