6.3 Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Thyroid Axis  
Use this case to answer questions 1 and 2.  
Susan is given chemo-therapy for her breast cancer. Because these drugs depress her appetite, 
she has lost 25 lbs in two weeks.  
 
1. At the end of two weeks of chemo-therapy was her plasma level of T3 changed?  If so, why?   
 
A. Decreased due to fasting state.  
 
B. Increased due to fasting state 
 
C. No change 
 
2. Is her body temperature changed? If so how? 
 
A. Yes. Lower basal body temperature due to overall decreased metabolic rate. 
 
B. Yes. Increased basal metabolic rate due to overall increased metabolic rate. 
 
C. No. Basal metabolic rate is not changed. 
 
3. Mary has a primary hypothyroidism. Is the secretion of TRH and TSH changed? If so, why?  
 
A. Yes. Increased secretion of TRH and TSH due to the decreased negative feedback 
inhibition. 
 
B. Yes. Increased secretion of TSH but decreased secretion of TRH due to negative 
feedback from pituitary. 
 
C. Yes. Decreased secretion of TRH and TSH due to hypo-secretion from the 
hypothalamus. 
 
D. Yes. Decreased secretion of TSH due to hypo-secretion from the pituitary.  
 
4. Predict the effect of exposure to cold on TSH plasma level.  
 
A. Increased secretion of TSH.  
 
B. Decreased secretion of TSH 
 
C. No change in TSH 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Correct Answer 1: A. Decreased due to fasting state. 
Correct Answer 2: A. Yes. Lower basal body temperature due to overall decreased metabolic rate. 
Correct Answer 3: A. Yes. Increased secretion of TRH and TSH due to the decreased negative feedback inhibition. 
Correct Answer 4: A. Increased secretion of TSH.
