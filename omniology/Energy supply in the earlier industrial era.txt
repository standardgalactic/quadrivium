Preface
Preface
It is difficult to claim to have an in-depth knowledge of a subject if such knowledge is restricted to the 
present and the recent past. Information and insights on a particular topic from the past can, in a well 
informed mind, be reprocessed and contribute to the topic in the present and, even more importantly, 
in the future. This is saying no more than Lewis Carroll’s maxim:
‘It’s a poor sort of memory that only works backwards’
This monograph of a little under 8000 words is an attempt to outline fuel supply from the late eighteenth 
century, when steam power was first becoming prevalent, up to immediately before the First World 
War. The treatment is quantitative, there being a number of calculations relevant to fuel performance. 
Prices are brought up to date by use of a recognised index accessible on the Web. The importance of the 
availability of crude oil from circa 1860 onwards is brought out, and growth in the oil industry over the 
next several decades analysed. Social and political themes feature centrally. 
The text is structured as a monograph having sections instead of chapters. It is directed primarily at 
those with professional involvement in energy supply. Those seeking to understand the role of energy 
supply in world affairs – more important now than it ever was – might also benefit from the text. I shall 
welcome comments from readers.

Introduction
1	 Introduction
Fuel utilisation over the period from the late eighteenth century to the early twentieth, spanning therefore 
three to four generations, is discussed in this text. Information presented will be given new perspectives 
by being assessed against knowledge which was not available at the respective periods under discussion. 
It is intended that this will make for continuity of ideas with the present time when energy prices are a 
very strong factor on the world economic scene.

The early late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
2	 The early late eighteenth and 
early nineteenth centuries
2.1	
Preamble
The first census for England and Wales was carried out in 1801. The population was on the basis of it 
given as 8.9 millions, and this has been retrospectively corrected to 9.2 millions [1]. The population of 
London was 0.9 millions. The national population had risen to about 12 millions by 1810 [2]. In 1801 
coal production in Britain was about 12 million tons per year. That is more than a third the current 
production rate but only about a tenth of the rate at the time of the First World War. Such variations in 
coal production over a period of two centuries clearly have an economic basis and if an economic one 
then also a social one. At the present time the coal reserves of Great Britain are very far indeed from 
being depleted and ‘disused mines’ are scattered about the country. Coal will therefore feature in the 
earlier part of this text as will coal products including coal gas and coke. Steam for steam engines was 
raised from coal, and the contribution made by steam technology to industrialisation will be explained. 
We note that in the early nineteenth century, the period under discussion in this section of the text, there 
was no commercial oil production anywhere in the world. Oil therefore belongs to later parts of text. 
2.2	
Newcomen’s steam engine in original and more advanced forms
This was the first steam engine, having come into being circa 1712. It long predates knowledge of 
thermodynamics which later enabled more advanced steam engines and steam turbines to come into 
service. Huge amounts of electricity are at the present time made from steam turbines. These operate 
according to a Rankine cycle, developed by William Rankine (1820–1872). The Rankine cycle is expressed 
as a temperature-entropy diagram, in which the work performing step is accompanied by a reduction 
in entropy. Newcomen himself could not have described his engine in such terms. Such a description 
will be attempted below after a qualitative account has been given. 
In Newcomen’s engine steam is admitted at the base of a vertical cylinder containing the piston, which 
is raised by the pressure of the steam. Once the piston is at full height, corresponding to the total swept 
volume, liquid water is admitted with the result that the steam condenses. The pressure inside the cylinder 
consequently falls and the piston returns to its original position. Referring to the diagram below, the 
basis of the work done is that in the limit where the process indicated by the two crosses is reversible 
all of the energy effect becomes work, and this is equal to the enthalpy change accompanying the step. 
It is often stated that in such an engine work is done ‘by the atmosphere’, on the basis that once the 
pressure inside the cylinder has dropped atmospheric pressure causes the piston to descend. However 
the quantity work done can only be calculated from the properties of the steam as shown below and 
explained in this paragraph.

The basic Newcomen engine underwent a modification attributable to James Watt and effected in 1769. 
The efficiency of a steam engine is simply:
mechanical work out/heat in
and an upper limit of the efficiency of the engine is that of a reversible Carnot cycle working between 
the same temperature [3], which is:
1 – T2/T1
where T2 and T1­ are temperatures corresponding to the upper and lower crosses on the figure as shown. 
Now the steam is saturated at 1 bar and will have a temperature, fixed by the phase rule1, of 373K. 
Condensation is to water in equilibrium with vapour at outdoor temperatures, say 20oC (293K). The 
efficiency so calculated is:
1 – (293/373) = 0.21 or 21%.
As stated this is an upper bound and appertains to a reversible Carnot cycle. Reversibility in the 
thermodynamic sense is best expressed as being conditions such that the equation of state is also the 
equation of path, so that at every point along the step indicated by an arrow in the figure the same 
equation of state would apply. 
The Newcomen/Watt engines would have been highly irreversible in their operation, and any irreversibility 
reduces efficiency. In fact the steam engines of that time were characterised by much lower efficiencies 
than the upper limit calculated, and it is believed that values were sometimes as low as 2%. It has to 
be remembered that this was at a time before the Laws of Thermodynamics were known. Watt was 
nevertheless aware that some engines gave better mechanical return on heat than others, therefore there 
was such a thing as ‘efficiency’, but this was not a major factor in engine usage at this period.

Fuel for steam power in the early 1800s
2.3.1	
Rate of steam usage
By 1800 British industry was using steam power at a rate of 20000 h.p., very largely in the textile industries 
where it was replacing water power [4]. This converts to approximately 15000 kW and from this figure it 
should be possible to estimate the coal requirement. This is attempted in the shaded area below, where 
an efficiency of 5% has been used for the steam devices.

The figure calculated must be compared with the figure of 12 million tons for UK coal production2 
given in section 1.1. The comparison shows that only something like 4% of the coal was being diverted 
to steam engine applications. Most of the remainder was being used to make coke for iron production 
from ore. There was coal gas as a by-product, and as early as 1807 this was used for street lighting in 
London’s Pall Mall [5]. 
2.3.2	
The cost of coal in circa 1800
In the period under discussion Tyneside was one of England’s leading coal producing regions, employing 
about 10000 miners in 1800. According to reference [6], in 1801 coal from Tyneside sold for ten shillings 
and four pence per ton, 52.5p (£0.525) per tonne in modern currency and units. The Brent price for 
a barrel (bbl) of crude oil on the day this is being written is $77.92 per barrel, or £47.77 per barrel. In 
the calculations in the boxed areas below these are compared on the basis of price per unit energy. First  
we consider the crude oil at the current price. We note that a barrel is 0.159 m3 and use 925 kg m-3 and 
44 MJ kg-1 respectively for the density and calorific value of the crude oil.

We now consider Tyneside coal at the 1801 price, noting that Tyneside coal was (is) of high quality and 
would have had a calorific value of not less than 25 MJ per kg3.

The boxed calculations indicate that heat obtainable from burning a barrel of oil at the current price of 
£47.77 would have been obtainable from coal costing £0.137 at the 1801 price. The ratio of the current 
price to the 1801 price is:
(47.77/0.137) = 350

Energy supply in the earlier industrial era

The early late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
From sources such as [7] and [8] it can easily be determined that the purchasing power of the pound 
decreased by a factor of about fifty between the early nineteenth century and the early twenty-first, 
therefore the factor of 350 is reduced to one of about seven. However, modern steam devices are much 
more efficient than those used in the early nineteenth century; the latter had efficiencies 5% or lower, 
and such efficiency was not seen as being important in that period provided that a particular engine was 
suitable for its assigned task. In mechanical energy terms therefore the cost ratio becomes something 
like 40 to 50. One only has to compare miners’ wages at a time before the industry was closely regulated 
with investment in infrastructure for offshore oil production to appreciate why a factor of this magnitude 
applies. 
There were 50000 coal miners in Britain by 1800 [9]. It was a dangerous occupation, and the catalogue of 
fatal mining accidents during the period under discussion is dismal and introduces another dimension 
to the rise of coal production to satisfy an expanding industrial base. The table below gives details of 
four such accidents. A reader should be aware that coal beds release methane (‘firedamp’) abundantly 
and that this has very often been the cause of fatal accidents in mines. 
Location 
Details
Reference.
Wallsend Pit, Tyneside 1803.
Explosion, 13 fatalities. Average age of the victims 17 years.
[10]
Hurlet Pit, Paisley Scotland 1805.
Explosion, 14 fatalities. Victims ranging in age from 12 
to 60. ‘Mortcloth money’ paid (see discussion below).
[11] 
Oxclose Colliery, Tyneside 1805
Explosion, estimated 38 fatalities. Victims 
ranging in age from 8 to 55. 
[12]
Whitehaven, Cumberland 
One of a succession of serious accidents at this site.
[12], [13]
Consistently with the use of a Tyneside coal in the pricing discussion earlier, an example from that 
region of England is in the first row of the table. The second row appertains to an explosion at a mine in 
Scotland in 1805. The dead had funerals in which the Scottish tradition of draping a mortcloth over the 
coffin was observed. Mortcloth money to cover all or part of the cost was paid in amounts ranging from 
four pennies to three shillings and ten pennies (£1.04 to £12.00 at the current value of the pound [7]). 
Moving to the Oxclose Colliery accident, if it really is so that the youngest victim was eight years old 
the mine owner was in violation of the Factory Act of 1802, which set nine years as the minimum age 
at which a child could undertake employment. Its scope went beyond factories to any paid employment 
and it set maximum working hours and standards of working conditions. It was in fact only enforced in 
relation to apprentices learning a trade. The promoters of the Act were concerned only with apprentices 
and not with child labourers even though its scope undoubtedly took in the latter. 
The discussion so far has been concerned with Great Britain. In the table below some corresponding 
facts for other parts of the world are given.

Commencement of coal production in 1810 [22].
One gets the impression from the three rows immediately above that coal production at this time in the 
US was sluggish. That this is so is supported by the US figures for the mid Nineteenth Century given 
later in this monograph when coal and oil at that period are compared. 
Industrialisation, with its revolutionary effects on the way of life in the major countries, was under way 
in the period of interest in this first part of the essay. The next part will deal with the period between 
1810 and the availability of oil in circa 1870. The author sometimes sees this period as the ‘dark ages’ in 
fuel and energy matters and will attempt to throw a little light on them!

The Period 1810–1870
3	 The Period 1810–1870
3.1	
Background
The period covered in this part of the text spans what was known in the UK as the Regency period and 
ends over 30 years into Queen Victoria’s reign. At the beginning of the period covered, the Napoleonic 
Wars were taking place. Over the years 1810 to 1870 the population of the UK increased from 10 to just 
over 20 millions [23]. Over the same period the Australian colonies increased hugely in population and 
in what we’d nowadays call infrastructure and were part of the enormous British Empire. We saw previously 
how coal was the prevalent fuel in the first decade of the nineteenth century. To trace its expansion over 
the period covered in this second part will provide for a seamless discourse. 
3.2	
New applications of coal
In considering this we first recall from what has already been said that in the first decade of the nineteenth 
century most coal was used to make metallurgical reductant, although a not insignificant amount 
was used in raising steam. These purposes to which coal can be put increased over the period under 
discussion, and there was also proliferation of coal gas production. A crucially important factor during 
the period under discussion is introduction and expansion of the railways. Use of coal as a feedstock 
for organic chemicals manufacture, technology originating in Germany, began towards the end of the 
period covered in this part of the text.

Thermodynamic analysis of early steam locomotives
An early steam locomotive might have used coal or coke to raise the steam. To a greater extent in the US 
than in Europe, wood fuel was used for this purpose. Stephenson’s Rocket was built during this period, 
making its debut in 1825 [24]. Its own weight was 4 tons, and when hauling a mixed payload of persons 
and goods making the total weight 17 tons it averaged 12 miles per hour. It ought to be possible from 
this to estimate the coal consumption, and this is in the shaded area below. 
4
That the bottom line in the above calculation is of the correct order of magnitude the reader can confirm 
from figures on the Web for early steam locomotives, e.g. [25]. In the days of the Rocket there was no 
preoccupation at all with greenhouse gas emissions. It is however interesting retrospectively to calculate 
them for the Rocket and such a calculation is set out below.

The Period 1810–1870
3.4	
Coal production internationally in the mid Nineteenth Century
UK coal production in 1850 was 50 million tons [27], a factor of six higher than the US production at 
that time [28] and significantly higher than the recent UK annual production of about 30 million tonnes 
[29]. To what purposes was the coal mined in 1850 put? Less than ten percent of it was exported leaving 
the remainder for domestic use [27]. Only about 1 million tons of the 1850 production was processed to 
make fuel gas [30]. Of the order of 20 million tons was being used in homes for heating and cooking [31]. 
That leaves a comparable amount for use in factories and by the railways. There was no coal combustion 
to make electricity until several decades later. 
These facts will receive further analysis, but first we review coal production in parts of the world other 
than the UK and the US at the time of our discussion. This information is in tabular form below. 
Country or region.
Amounts of coal.
Whole world, 1850
 Total production ≈ 170 million tons, estimated by the present 
author from a graph in [32]. This signifies that UK production 
at this time was about 30% of the world total. 
India
Production of 0.09 million tons in 1846 [33].
Australia.
0.07 million tons produced in 1851 [34].  
(European population of Australia at this time about half a million.) 
Canada
3 million tons produced in 1867 [35]
North Rhine-Westphalia.
1 million tonnes produced in 1839 rising to > 2 million tonnes in 1853 [36].
Austria-Hungary Dual Monarchy. 
1 to 2 million tons consumed within Austria per annum. Consumption 
about an order of magnitude lower in Hungary. See reference [37].
Russia.
Just over half a million tons in 1860 [38].
China and Japan were also in the coal production business during the period of interest. Hashima Island 
is in the East China Sea, off the part of Japan known as the Nagasaki Prefecture. Coal was discovered at 
Hashima Island, which had not previously been occupied by persons, in 1887. The coal there is bituminous 
in rank and has good coking properties. In 1890 Hashima was acquired by Mitsubishi which had, in 1881, 
purchased the mine at Takashima, an island also off the Nagasaki Prefecture. This was a period when 
industrial and military expansion in Japan were rapid, and by the approach of WW1 Hashima was the 
scene of coal production at a level of 150000 ton per year and the population of the island, comprising 
mine employees and their families, was 3000. 
One might have expected this to be an advantageous time for Japan: once oil became dominant she 
was at a major disadvantage through not having any significant reserves of it. The effects of that have 
continued until the present time. China had the advantage that a significant proportion of her coal was 
(is) anthracite, which tends to attract a higher price than bituminous coals.

information is in the table below. The Measuring Worth Calculator [7] has again been used in adjusting 
the prices to present-day values.

Note that in the earlier part of the period of interest coal was expensive in the US. The later part of the period 
of interest takes in the American Civil War. There were fuel demands by both sides, and these had the effect 
of raising the price of coal. There was also an indirect effect of the Civil War on the price of coal. Railroads 
for freighting coal increased in importance during the War and these themselves had a coal requirement. 
Return on unit amount of coal purchased for railroad use increased very significantly over the War years. 
3.5	
Producer gas
Producer gas is made by passing either air or air and steam through a bed of hot coal or coke (a ‘gas 
producer’). The first commercial gas producer entered service in 1823. The resulting fuel gas contains 
carbon monoxide and hydrogen as the flammable constituents but is heavily diluted by nitrogen from 
the influx air. Its calorific value is 4 to 5 MJ m-3, compared with 20 MJ m-3 from ‘coal gas’ discussed 
previously. Nevertheless, producer gas when burnt in air (involving even more diluent nitrogen) is 
capable of melting steel. By the mid 19th Century producer gas was being used in the steel industry in 
England. Its advantages are that it can be made where it is needed and that poor coal which is suitable 
neither for direct burning nor for coking might be used as feedstock. 
3.6	
Oil from shale
Shale features later in this essay, but readers should be aware that illuminating oil was being prepared 
from shale by about 1840 in countries including France and Scotland, so the view that shale oil predates 
conventional oil is correct. Shale oil production in Scotland was at Pumpherston in the Lothians, and 
continued until the 1960s. It was close to the Grangemouth refinery, still the only refinery in Scotland 
and now operated by Ineos [43]. 
Proliferation of coal for locomotives has been a dominant theme in this discussion. The intrinsic 
superiority of liquid fuels for very many applications came with the commencement of the oil industry. 
That is the topic of the next part of the monograph.

Introduction
A natural event at which to ‘start the clock’ in terms of the oil industry in 1859, the year of the celebrated 
Drake well in Pennsylvania. This was not the first commercial oil well in the world – that was about a 
decade earlier in a location distant from the USA5 [44] – but it has captured the imagination of subsequent 
generations to a remarkable degree so its use to commence an oil timeline is appropriate.

The 1860s and 1870s
4.2.1	
Introduction of oil pipelines in the USA
Drake’s well certainly heralded an exciting new product in the US, so much so that the 1860 oil 
production was 25000% higher than the 1859 [45]. Between 1862 and 1911 the average annual increase 
in oil production in the US was 25% [45]. In these very early days the cost of transportation of oil was 
restricting sales. The need for pipelines was recognised, and the first such pipeline was installed in 
Pennsylvania in 1865 [46]. It was made of two inch diameter wrought iron pipe in fifteen feet sections 
joined together by welding, and the welded joints were pressure tested. It conveyed 81 barrels (bbl) per 
hour6, using a steam pump operating at 10 h.p. These data will be evaluated in the shaded area below.

Our discussion at this stage is just at the end of the American Civil War, dates for which are usually 
given as 1861 to 1865. Between 1865 and 1866 there was a sharp increase in oil production in the USA, 
from 2.5 million barrels in 1865 to 3.6 million in 1866 [47]. 
4.2.2	
Formation of the Standard Oil Company
In 1870 John D. Rockefeller, then thirty-one years of age, set up in Cleveland Ohio the Standard Oil 
Company. He had in fact been conscripted to serve in the Civil War (on the Yankee side, obviously) but 
instead took the perfectly regular alternative of paying for a substitute. He first got into the oil business 
during the Civil War years, so acquiring the capital necessary for expansion once Standard Oil was formed. 
By 1870 there was a great deal of refining already taking place in Cleveland, and Standard Oil bought 
out most of the refineries in what in US commercial history is often called the ‘Cleveland Massacre’. 
In fact 22 of the 26 refineries in Cleveland were acquired by Standard Oil at this time [48]. Refineries 
were on a much smaller scale than those which were later to come into service, and the largest one in 
Cleveland at that time had a capacity of 1500 barrels per day at a time when the total USA production 
of oil was about ten times that [47]. Throughout the 1870s Standard Oil continued to acquire assets, for 
example expanding into Kentucky in 1873 by acquiring 50% of Chess, Carley & Company, distributors 
of petroleum products. 
Standard Oil therefore began what we’d now call downstream operations and by 1878 owned 90%  
of the refining capacity of the USA [49]. By then it had expanded into a number of other states including 
Pennsylvania. In 1878 Standard Oil refined about 14 million barrels annually, and in so doing earned 
$33 million. 
It is of interest to evaluate the refining cost, bearing in mind that the primary saleable product from 
oil refining at this time was the kerosene fraction for use as illuminating oil. Prior to the period of the 
discussion tallow – animal fat having several constituents in common with modern biodiesels7 – would 
have been used for such a purpose, and at the period of the discussion there was also significant use of 
coal gas as a fuel for illumination. Calculations relevant to refining costs are in the shaded area below.

Two points in the above calculation can be linked. One is that the figure of 1 gallon of gasoline per 2.3 
gallons of crude oil, representing a 43% yield of gasoline, is not for straight-run gasoline alone but for 
straight-run gasoline plus FCC (fluid catalytic cracked) gasoline from the naphtha as well as naphtha 
simply reformed. Similarly there are further processes on the other fractions, for example sulphur removal 
from diesel. Such processes were not of course available in 1878, and advantageous though they certainly 
are they add to refining costs. That our calculations have predicted a factor of two difference between 
refining costs for 1878 and for 2008 is totally consistent with this.

Standard Oil had a presence in California by the end of the 1870s (see section 4.3). Texas did not become 
an ‘oil state’ until the turn of the century by which time Mexico, where exploratory drilling began in 1869, 
had become a major producer. Each of these will be discussed in its due place in this text. 
Venezuela is a major oil producer and was, about 60 years later than the period covered by this text, one 
of the founding members of OPEC. 
4.3	
Expansion between 1880 and 1900
US crude oil production in 1880 was 26 million barrels. In 1900 it was 63 million barrels [47]. This 
represents growth by an average of 1.9 million barrels per year. Worldwide, production was 150 million 
barrels in 1900 [56]. One of the most significant activities outside the USA was discovery in of oil in 
Sumatra, part of the modern Indonesia, in 1885 [53]. 
California entered the oil industry at this time [57]. Previously there was no major production further west 
than Ohio. The first significant discovery of oil in California was at Pico Canyon, Los Angeles County, 
in 1875. The company having made the discovery were California Star and Oil Works [58]. ‘California 
Star’ was later acquired by the Pacific Coast Oil Company, who by 1880 had a refinery processing 600 
barrels of Californian crude oil per day.

Other oilfields in California included that at Ventura County and that at Kern County: the latter became 
the most productive in the State. As more crude oil was produced worldwide, the need for transportation 
of it became clear. A steel tanker with a capacity of 6500 barrels entered service in California in 1895. 
It was called the George Loomis. By this time there had already been tanker transportation of crude oil 
in the Caspian region. Standard Oil established a presence in California as noted above, and were in 
competition with Pacific Coast. Lacking the capital and the influence of Standard Oil, Pacific Coast Oil 
was acquired by Standard in 1900 although it continued to trade under the Pacific Coast name. Standard 
Oil purchased a 500 acre block of land in San Francisco in 1901 for the building of a refinery [59]. This 
was called the Richmond refinery, and when it began production in 1902 its capacity was 10000 barrels 
per day. It received crude oil solely from California. The Richmond refinery is still in operation, and its 
current capacity is 20 to 25 times its capacity in 1902. 
The period currently being discussed takes in the invention of the internal combustion engine. The 
strongest claimant to the title of ‘inventor of the motor car’ is Karl Benz (1844–1929) whose ‘Patent 
Motorwagen’, powered by an engine operating on an Otto cycle, made its debut in Germany in 1885 [60]. 
Obviously the motor car had a huge effect on the oil industry. It meant not only that more oil needed 
to be produced and refined but that the most valuable product was no longer kerosene but gasoline. 
4.4	
The early years of automobile manufacture
The car manufacturing industry in Germany began with Benz’ 1886 model, and shortly afterwards 
Gottlieb Daimler entered the industry [61] and cars and light trucks were produced. Manufacture had 
expanded to about 900 units per year by the beginning of the 20th Century [62]. There was plenty of 
locally produced fuel. In an arrangement strongly reminiscent of the car industry in more recent times, 
Daimler cars were being produced under licence in the USA. 
The Ford Motor Company was formed in Detroit 1903. Initially production was three units per day, 
comparable to the 900 per year by Daimler at this time. The Buick Motor Company was formed in 1905 and 
was renamed General Motors in 1908 [63]. As with Germany, there was quite sufficient locally produced 
fuel. This was not so in Japan, where car production began in 1907 [64]. Hatsudoki Seizo Company was 
set up in Osaka by a group of scholars from the local university. This too is very reminiscent of more 
recent times, ‘spin-off companies’ from academic activity now being numerous across a very wide range 
of applied science and engineering disciplines. The difference between the Japanese situation and the US 
and German is that Japanese operators of cars in this period would have had to rely wholly on imported 
gasoline. The Hatsudoki Seizo Company, like Ford and General Motors, continues to the present time 
now being known as Daihatsu.

Effects on oil production of the introduction of the motor car were far-reaching; the following figures 
are taken from [65]. US oil production in 1900 was 63 million barrels. This rose to 210 million barrels 
in 1910, an increase of 230%. A remarkable fact of this period is the drop in the price of oil, which in 
1900 was $1.19 per barrel equivalent [7] to $31.38 per barrel at the 2008 value of the dollar. In 1910 
the price was $0.61 per barrel, equivalent to $14.26 per barrel at the 2008 value of the dollar. Over this 
period the oil fields of Texas had expanded, and this might be one factor in the behaviour of the price. 
Investment in the Texan oil fields at this time was huge and companies setting up in Texas provided 
strong competition to Standard Oil. Such companies included Gulf Oil, which traded under that name 
until it merged with Chevron in the 1980s. Humble8 Oil, initially an independent Texan company, later 
affiliated with Standard and the ‘descendant’ of this arrangement is Exxon. 
As already explained, gasoline was now the primary product of crude oil refining. It was recognised that 
there would be great economic benefits from modifying some of the higher boiling fractions to make 
them suitable for blending with gasoline. This is how the technology of cracking came into being. A US 
patent for cracking of heavier petroleum material to make gasoline extender was granted in 1913.
4.5	
The Mexican oil industry
Mexico began to produce crude oil commercially in 1901 and to export it in 1911. Production was at 
oil fields close to the town of Tuxpán. One of the participating companies was Pearson, now a huge 
publishing and media organisation having ownership for example of Penguin Books and Thames Television. 
Pearson had involvement in Mexican oil from 1901 and traded as Mexican Eagle. Shell and Standard Oil 
were amongst the other oil companies active in Mexico during the period under discussion. 
4.6	
Fuel gas usage at this period
Natural gas sometimes occurs with oil (‘associated gas’) and sometimes without there being any oil (‘non-
associated gas’). US production of natural gas in 1900 was 128000 million cubic feet, equivalent in heat 
release terms to 20 million barrels of oil. In 1910 the figure was 509000 million cubic feet, equivalent in 
heat release terms to 80 million barrels of oil. By the beginning of the 20th Century there was a significant 
natural gas pipeline network in the US. 
There was also much manufactured fuel gas in the US and in Europe, and indeed in some distant British 
possessions including Singapore, by this time. Producer gas and ‘coal gas’ have already been described 
and these too made a significant contribution to energy requirements in the early 20th Century.

A glimpse into the ‘future’
5	 A glimpse into the ‘future’9
Whilst it is preferable for a coverage on this scale (8000 words) to restrict itself to a precisely specified 
period, it is of interest to conclude it with an anticipation of what followed that period. That is the purpose 
of this final section. Such events would have been in the future to those alive in the period covered by 
this essay hence the use of that word in inverted commas in the title of this final section. 
Immediately following the period covered by this monograph came WW1 which, of course, brought with 
it its own energy needs. The motor car proliferated at this time, not only in the US but also in Japan.
Toyota10 and Nissan cars became available at about the time of WW1, fuel for them being imported 
largely from the then Dutch East Indies. Coal production was on a large scale in countries including the 
UK, the USA, Germany, China and Japan.

Concluding remarks
6	 Concluding remarks
It was stated early in this text that continuity with more recent times including the present was intended to 
be one of its themes. Accordingly a few points from the very end of the period covered will be examined 
for such continuity. One is that Toyota and Nissan are now amongst the world’s largest car makers 
having manufacturing plants in many countries. Another is that although Japan still has large amounts 
of coal she no longer mines it, importing it instead from Australia, Indonesia and the US. Another is 
that although China still produces coal the mining industry there has a lamentable safety record. Perhaps 
the most surprising point to be made here is that at the period when this discussion closes, that is, at 
about the time of WW1, there was still no oil production in the Middle East, nor was there to be for 
about another 20 years. These are all points which an interested reader can, using the almost unlimited 
resources of the Internet, follow up for him/herself.

Energy supply in the earlier industrial era

Postscript
8	 Postscript
Surely science and technology become all the more interesting and intellectually satisfying when the 
‘human aspects’ are given their due place. Lewis Carroll was quoted in the preface to this book and Neil 
Armstrong, the first man to set foot on the moon, will be quoted in this postscript:
‘One small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind’11
What could express more clearly and more appealingly than that the principle that the rewards of 
advancement belong to the entire human race and not to any individual or even country? 
At the time of the moon landing in July 1969, oil availability was fairly stable and the gas guzzler was still 
prevalent in the US. The following year two scenes of hydrocarbon production commenced operation 
each of which is of major importance at the present time: the North Sea and the Bass Strait. Nevertheless 
there was vulnerability, and it was only three years later that action by the OPEC countries following 
US military involvement in Israel (the ‘1973 oil embargo’) led to the first petrol rationing in the UK 
since WW2. 
This sort of interplay between the engineering and technology of fuel production and social and political 
events has been emphasised in several parts of this book, which is why both the American Civil War and 
WW1 feature. It is a challenge to the writer to link such events closely to the engineering and technological 
principles. That there not only is such a link but that it is a strong one the breakage of which can cause 
world affairs to go awry is clear. For evidence of this one need look no further back than mid 2005. 
Production difficulties caused by a series of Gulf Coast hurricanes including Katrina and an insatiable 
desire for crude oil by China in preparation for the Beijing Olympics caused the price of crude oil to be 
unprecedentedly high, with all the knock-on effects of that on world trade. 
In these times we not only have to meet energy needs but also to do so in a way consistent with 
greenhouse gas reductions. This requires international co-operation and co-ordination on a scale never 
before attempted as it is the very planet which is at risk and regional and national interests have to be 
overridden. This monograph sets the scene long before such matters were on the agenda, yet is helpful 
in understanding how and why the carbon dioxide level of the atmosphere rose by about 100 p.p.m. 
between the early 19th and early 21st Centuries. Here surely is an example of how knowledge from the 
past provides guidance for the future, and at the present guidance in respect of fuels and their emissions 
is of the highest importance.

The phase rule was not of course known in the period under discussion.

The Imperial ton and the metric tonne differ by just under 2%. There is nothing to be gained by 
distinguishing them in approximate calculations such as those on this page.
3.	
The calculation below also features, in slightly different form, in an article by the author currently 
in press with ‘Open Thermodynamics Journal’.

The train operated in England’s north east. Note the statement previously that coal from this region 
was of good calorific value.

This theme is continued in the postscript.
10.	 Toyota himself had made his fortune by developing and manufacturing a new kind of weaving 
loom, and later moved into vehicle manufacture. A resident of Aberdeen is likely to be aware that 
Mitsubishi was founded by an adventurous young Aberdonian who set off to Japan in search of 
wealth in the second half of the Nineteenth Century. His name was Glover. The company which he 
set up after a number of mergers became Mitsubishi. Japan was never of course a British possession 
but a number of enterprising people from Britain did go there at that time and set up businesses. 
Gilbert and Sullivan’s Mikado is reminiscent of the English-speaking community in Japan at that 
time. There is limited basis for comparison with Siam (Thailand), which was also the destination 
of hopeful British migrants at that time. The story Anna and the King, known in its musical form 
as The King and I, is set in the Siam of this period. The difference between Japan and Thailand 
is that the former became a manufacturing country whereas the latter was only a trading centre 
strategically placed in relation to places such as Singapore and Sumatra. More on this in Joseph 
Conrad’s novel Youth.
11.	 The author is aware that the precise form of the words uttered by Armstrong has been disputed.
