Chapter 1 - The Obligatory Introduction
A
hh, online dating.  It truly is one of the greatest gifts that the Internet has bestowed upon us.
Wait, scratch that.  Let’s try that again.
It’s one of the greatest gifts for women and truly a curse for any man who has even attempted to get 
close to a woman by using it.
Maybe you haven’t noticed, but men greatly outnumber women on ANY dating site.  You know what 
this means?  Competition – and lots of it!  Women on dating sites receive dozens or even hundreds of 
messages per day from men wanting their time and attention.  Do you know what happens to most of 
those messages?  *DELETE*!  That’s what they do.  They delete you.  Taste the rejection, fellas.  It’s a 
bitter pill to swallow, and is only soured by the mass deleting of those unread messages that plead for 
her love and time.  
What worsens your game is that women love to play games too – and they play them far better than 
us.  Imagine if you were up on a pedestal and you had tons of potential lovers clamoring at your feet.  
Wouldn’t you make those people work hard and suffer to get your attention (admit it, even if you’re a 
nice guy, you’d play the game too)?
Women in the online dating world, as well as in real life, have unrealistic 
expectations of romance from men.  Blame Hollywood or blame that one guy 
friend of yours who is a complete doormat, but women generally want more than 
what they’ve already got; or they’re after men for cash; or they are professional 
cock teases who enjoy rejecting and ripping out the hearts of men for sport; or 
you may get the single mother looking for a new baby daddy so she can get some 
free baby-sitting out of you, and maybe a lay and some cash on the side.  And 
they wonder why we drink.
This, my friends, this is what you’re up against.  You spend countless hours 
perusing profiles and sending messages, only to be rejected.  But fear not!  You 
can turn the tables.  You can flip the switch.  You can play these women as hard as 
they play you, and harder!  This book will teach you how to truly enjoy the online 
dating experience for the incredible, love-and-sex-giving gift that it is.
Welcome
Deleted messages, rejection, zero replies to your messages, cancelled dates…these are the daily fare of 
far too many males in the online dating world.  But this book will not only show you how to get a reply, 
but how to get a date too.  And then a second date.  If you actually finish reading this book and practice 
what it preaches, you probably will even get laid!  And if you want to stick with the same woman, good 
on you (we have you covered there, too).
Who The Hell Am I?
I know, you’re probably wondering who this jackass is who thinks he’s some sort of quasi online dating 
expert, right?  Well let me tell you a little bit about myself.
On my wall hangs an Arts degree in English Lit., a Fine Arts degree in Film and Television Production, 
a Diploma with Honors in Digital Media Entertainment, a Masters Degree in Business Administration, 
Marketing and Internet Technology, and I’ve also studied psychology and understand the inner workings 
of both the male and female psyches.

Chapter 1 - The Obligatory Introduction
Most importantly though, I’m a real guy with real experience. I’ve walked the walk and humped the… 
well, you get the idea.
You may think that after reading this I’m a great looking dude who’s got some extra cash in his bank 
account and has no problems meeting women.  WRONG!  Believe it or not, I’m an average middle aged  
guy plugging away at an average job.  But I am smart.  And I’m creative and can easily pour on the 
charm when I need to.  I can carry a decent conversation, I’m funnier than hell, and I am a serial flirt.  
All of this coming from a slightly overweight guy (hey, I’m working on it, alright?) who’s been referred to 
as a chubby-faced Muppet.
So why am I telling you this?  I want you to know that I’m just like you.  I know what it’s like to be 
rejected.  I know what it’s like to have drinks thrown in my face, to be slapped, dumped, ditched and 
forgotten.  I know the HELL of trying to meet women online, in bars, in malls, and wherever else you 
can think of.  It can be frustrating beyond belief.  But I want you to know that you’re not alone.  Many 
men feel the same and have gone through the exact same bullshit.  But guess what?  I never gave up 
and I dedicated thousands of hours trying to figure women out.  And after you read this book, you’ll 
know what women are all about and you’ll be a Dating Commando - The Ultimate Kick-Ass Weapon To 
Conquering Women Online!
This book has taken years to write.  I have personally conducted hundreds of hours worth of research;  
creating, monitoring and documenting the profiles of many different types of men and women.  I have 
compiled hundreds and hundreds of pages of correspondence data.  I’ve been on more dates than 
you or I would ever care to count, and I have bedded over a hundred different women.  The years of 
research I’ve done and the thousands of dollars I’ve invested have resulted in discovering the true 
hidden secrets of online dating and how to turn online dating into a success story.
I know what works, what doesn’t, and how to play the game.  I have cracked the code.
I have a solid and consistent 95% conversation rate with women online.  I target some of the 
HOTTEST women and I almost always get dates.  Wait – get this: they compete for me!  Hell, 
sometimes I have a hard time just getting rid of one so I can move on to another.
This is my game.  This is my sport.  It’s all about the hunt and kill.  To win it, you’ve got to play it. As 
the Great Gretzky said, “one hundred percent of the shots you don’t take will not score.”  It doesn’t 
matter if you’re in it for that one-night stand or to find your soul mate: you’ve got to PLAY to WIN 
because if you don’t, someone else will!
The Research And Research Methods
Producing this book and gaining such incredible insight into women and online dating required 
extensive research and lots of first-hand experience on dating websites.  The research was conducted 
over a 24 month period and involved the creation and setting up of multiple female AND male accounts  
across several age groups.  All images used were from licensed staged models, and some accounts 
didn’t even include photos (though don’t take this as a good example; always include photos in your 
profile!).
I played the game differently based on gender.  Female accounts were left alone to generate and 
attract male responses.  Occasional responses were given and follow up was documented, measured, 
“One hundred percent of the shots 
you don’t take will not score”

and evaluated.
Male accounts were used to contact women.  Each male account would contact the same set of 
women over a given period of time.  Different scripts and techniques were used by each male account, 
and the women’s responses (or lack thereof) were documented, measured, and evaluated.
Successful responses led to first and second dates and all the fun outcomes pertaining thereto.  
Techniques were field tested, evaluated, and then documented again.  These responses, my friends, I 
have divulged to you in this book.
The Typical Online Dating Experience
	
Maybe it’s early in the week and you want to make plans that include a hot date for Friday night.  I 
mean, your friends already have their dates all lined up, right?  So why not you?  Maybe you’re jaded 
by the bar scene, maybe you can’t compete with the popped collared, ultra tanned idiots in the club.  
Whatever it is that has lit the fire under you (please tell me it’s not an STD), you choose to jump 
online and find a quick date and maybe – just maybe – a quick lay.
You decide to visit one of those online dating sites that your friends have told you about.  On the 
sign-up page, you enter your age, your gender, your location, and then you search.  Waiting…waiting…
scrolling…stop.  There. There she is!  Tight body, glossy hair, and eyes and lips that could kill.  You 
quickly scan her profile – no kids, awesome pictures, so you choose to contact her.  You probably 
wrote something like this:
SUBJECT:  hi
MESSAGE:  I saw your profile.  You’re really pretty.  We seem to 
have similar interests.  I’d love to go out with you.  Check out 
my profile and please write back.
You click the “send” button and cross your fingers.  You back out and look through other profiles.  
Whoa, more hotties!  You pretty much keep copying and pasting that original message to every one of 
these girls you’d like to get next…and on to…and…well I’ll stop there.
You figure no woman can resist a guy with a profile like this:
Good lookin dude who enjoys working out. Camping, fishing, hiking, 
dining, and catchin’ the game on TV are all things I reely like.  
Been a huge fan of hockey since I can remember.   Please – no 
flakes.  LOL.  Been there done that, tired of the d8ing scene and 
am now looking for someone normal.  If you like to work out and 
has a gr8 job write 2 me. 
Bangin’, right?  Your pictures are pretty good, too: a decent wide shot of you in front of a raging 
river holding a fish (down to earth!); another of you with your buddies getting righteously smashed 
on cheap beer in Mexico (adventurous AND fun!); your favorite goofy face photo – a CLOSE UP shot 
(I have a sense of humor!); a great shot of you looking VERY happy next to your ex-girlfriend (she’s 
cropped out; that little bit of arm showing and blond hair isn’t a dead give away, right?); and then 
there’s that snap shot of you posing with your dog (I’m a caring, responsible guy!).
So here comes Thursday night.  Well…no replies yet, but maybe on Friday.  Friday night comes 
around – nope, still nothing.  You may even start hitting the refresh button on your email’s inbox a 
couple of times before 1am in hopes that something may change.  Then comes Saturday.  Then rolls 
around Sunday.  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday… what’s wrong with these girls?  You sent out dozens 
of messages and not even one reply?  Jeez, you even sent some messages to some homely looking 
butter face chicks and they’re not even biting.  What gives?
I’ll tell you what gives.  You suck.  Well, maybe not you, but your profile and your methods certainly

Chapter 1 - The Obligatory Introduction
do.  Get this through your head: the women you are meeting online get tons of messages from guys 
like you every day – even the homely butter face girls that you thought were a sure score.  In this 
game, women hold ALL the cards.  They’re the ones in control.  They’re the ones with the power. 
They’ve got what you want and, believe me, they know it.  They’re not going to give it up for just 
anyone, especially some schmuck with a profile indistinguishable from ten thousand others.  Whether 
you’re some skuzzy toad from New Jersey or a wealthy golden Adonis, the only way you’re going to 
get any of these women is if you take them with first impressions that light their fires!
You may be feeling a bit bad about yourself right now.  Good, you should be.  But fear not!  In the 
next few chapters I will show you exactly what is going on and what you’re doing wrong.  I’ll show 
you how to conquer these women online and experience message-to-response-to-date conversation 
ratios as high as 95% (sure looks better than your 0.05%, doesn’t it?).  I’ll show you how to kick ass 
and GET some ass, and how to nail that first date…and then the second…and hey, maybe you two 
will turn out to be something really special and then invite me to the wedding!  Open bar, ‘cause I’m a 
cheap bastard.
What Women Want
If you’re like most guys, you have no idea what women want. And guess what? 
Most women have no idea what they want ‘till they see it.  Your moon has to hit 
their eye like a big pizza pie, capiche?  Oh, they’ll tell you that they want a nice 
guy. They’ll tell you that they want a REAL MAN who will treat them well.  But 
then you meet their man of choice and he’s a total jerk-off who treats them like 
trash.
I’m going to let you in on a bit of a secret.  Women who are on the dating sites, 
particularly free ones, are there for two reasons (it doesn’t matter if they’re 19 or 
64):
1)	 They’re looking for their valiant Prince Charming, their knight in shining 
armor, their Leonardo DiCaprio from Titanic. They want to find that guy who will 
sweep them off of their feet in a whirlwind, Hollywood-type romance and who will 
love them more and more each day, forever and always.  They want – no, they 
EXPECT – to find the PERFECT MAN.  They dream of the day they’ll find him 
and then ride off on a white Unicorn into the golden sunset. ...And all you want 
is to get laid. Hey, who said life was fair?
2)	 They’re hornier than hell, they love to flirt, and they love to be flirted with. 
They want some action, but only with the right guy (see point #1 above).
But wait…, you need to understand something incredibly important.  While women 
say that they’re looking for a nice guy, they’re actually looking for a bad boy who 
treats them well and with respect, but who they feel can be tamed.  Remember, makeover is a huge 
word in the female vocab.
NOTE: By bad boy, I don’t mean some criminal asshole who’s dealing drugs to school kids out of the 
Women typically 
get 10-40 messages 
every day from guys 
JUST LIKE YOU!  
The guys all say the 
same thing, have 
the same photos 
and have the same 
lame lazy-assed 
profiles.  
So why should she 
respond to you? 
What makes you

back of a windowless van.  Read the Bad Boys segment in Chapter 5 to understand what women think 
a bad boy actually is.
If you design and play your game right, you’ll find that getting dates is as easy as ordering a 
pepperoni pizza, hold the anchovies.
What You’re About To Learn
I’m going to show you how to maximize the performance of your results on online dating 
websites, such as Plenty of Fish, Match.com and LavaLife.  You’re going to learn how to write a killer 
profile, how to post the best and most appealing photos, how to write a winning introduction 
and follow up scripts, how you’re going to lock down a first and second date, and ultimately how 
to bring the girl to your bedroom (be sure to start cleaning it up now).
You’re going to transform from an everyday average guy to a Dating Commando.  You will surpass 
the levels achieved by a regular dater, a player, and even an elite player.  You’ll learn how to create 
and build a concrete dating plan and how to base that dating plan not just on your confidence (have 
none? You will soon), wit, and charisma, but also how to base it on solid intelligence gathering and 
background research.
You will notice that I take a very academic and business approach to the art, science, and business of 
dating (yes, it really IS all of those things!).  In this context, this book is unlike any other you’re going 
to find on the subject matter.  I have personally reviewed and read almost every book and eBook on 
the subject of dating and online dating.  While some are good at telling you what you should do, none 
actually break down and show you how to do it.
This is a serious game.  I consider winning it to be of utmost importance.  While other books simply 
skim along the surface of how to be a player, or what they THINK is a player, I’ll take you into the 
deep, dark recesses of what it means to be a Dating Commando.  The top of the food chain.  The 
best of the best.  It’s a place where being the best isn’t an opportunity, it’s a requirement.  Your very 
dating survival depends on this book.
Together, we’re going to help you conquer women online!
Time Out – A Word Of Caution
Look,  even though this book is going to get your game tight, it doesn’t mean that a woman deserves 
to be treated with disrespect.  Always respect her, even when she rejects you or says something nasty  
or cruel.
This book isn’t about forcing a woman to do what she doesn’t want to do; it’s about teaching YOU the 
proper tactics on how to inspire and move them to want you and willingly give themselves to you.  So 
don’t be a dick.
Another caution you should take into consideration here: DO NOT date women friends or female 
colleagues.  These two groups of women are off limits.  Not only are you destined for complete and 
utter failure, but you’re also bound to lose some great friends and possibly even your job.  Trust me, 
it’s not worth it.
Remember to respect yourself.  You know that buddy of yours who is every woman’s doormat?  Yeah, 
that guy doesn’t respect himself.  You do not need to take crap from anyone, even if it’s a woman 
whose pants you really want to come off.  If she doesn’t give you the respect that you deserve and 
reciprocate the respect you’ve given her, it’s over.  Just walk away and move on to the next girl (there 
are plenty out there).  Don’t debate it, don’t discuss it, and don’t rationalize it.  Move right along. 
Lastly, get to know this word very well: REJECTION.  If you play the game right, no matter how

Chapter 1 - The Obligatory Introduction
tight your game is, you’ll be rejected more times in a night than most guys experience in an entire 
lifetime.  Know why?  Because you’re playing the game like a Dating Commando.  Don’t fear 
rejection; embrace it!  Rejection is a true badge of honor.  
This book is a step-by-step guide to conquering women online and, ultimately, winning them as 
a date or even more.  So right here, right now, kick off that loser nice guy persona and commit to 
playing this game like a winner.
“Women want a Prince Charming ‘bad 
boy’ who treats them well and with 
respect and whom they can tame!”
Chapter Conclusion
Welcome.  You need help, that’s why you bought this book.  I’m here to help.
Why should you listen to me?  Because I’m like you – only I’ve figured out the secret to what 
makes women tick.  I’ve put in thousands of hours of work and dollars and real practice into 
my craft.  
Online dating tends to suck, unless you know how to play the game.  You, my friend, are 
about to naturally live and breathe this game.  I’m going to devastate and rock your world and 
you’re going to devastate and rock hers!
From this point on, I require a 100% commitment from you so that you can transform from 
your helpless self to a true Dating Commando.
No commitment, no ladies.  It’s that simple.  Now let’s get you some dates!

Chapter 2 - Research Methods & Marketing Intelligence
B
efore you get your panties in a knot about being considered a product, please allow me to 
appropriately bitch slap you and tell you why you need to get real: you are an item that women 
(and possibly men) have already window shopped, test driven, and tried out under warranty.  And 
you’ve done the same goddamn thing, so don’t start telling me about how insensitive this is.
If you have read any of the dating books or e-books out there, you may have noticed already that I 
take a much different approach to online dating than most of the so-called experts.  You already read  
my credentials in chapter 1; I have run my own businesses and have implemented and managed the 
worldwide advertising campaigns of some of the largest film and video game companies in the world.  
I’m what some people would refer to as a real go getter.
Whether you like it or not, you are a product.  You are a brand.  You are a package.  You offer promise 
and hope.  You are the solution to a problem.  Like any other product, you need to be marketed 
carefully and well.  Like any other product, what will allow you to stand out from and crush the 
competition is a well thought out and properly executed marketing plan.
I’m going to use marketing terms, like market research, target market, and more.  Stick with me, this 
shit will pay off for you big time.  I’m not demeaning the process here; I’m trying to clearly illustrate and 
reinforce the concept that we are marketing and selling you to the world.  This book is going to show 
you how to package, pitch, and sell yourself for love.  After you do that, the challenge of maintaining the 
love kicks in and that’s way beyond marketing. Taking a marketing approach may sound a bit cold and 
calculated, but trust me…it’ll work.  Besides, you wouldn’t have bought this book if you didn’t need help 
with your love life.  So let’s go kick some ass and rise to the top of the dating scene!
Marketing Intelligence (MI)
Before we go any further with teaching you how to be successful in today’s dating market, you must 
gain a sort of understanding about what Marketing Intelligence, or “MI” as we will refer to it here (I’m 
too lazy to type out the two words every time), is.  According to Cornish, MI is “the process of acquiring 
and analyzing information in order to understand the market (both existing and potential customers); 
to determine the current and future needs and preferences, attitudes and behavior of the market; and 
to assess changes in the business environment that may affect the size and nature of the market in the 
future.” (Product, 1997, p147).
Dig the fancy academic citation?  Yeah, I did my research and you know it!
Every time you log on to a dating website, look at it as a market, a DATING 
MARKET.  Go to a bar and think the same thing.  Collectively there are certain 
trends and statistics that make it easy to form generalizations about the dating 
market. From this, YOU can adapt and adopt an approach that will give you a huge  
dating scene advantage (I’ll share with you some amazing stats in the next chapter 
that will open your eyes to the wonderful world of SUCCESSFUL online dating).  
Each person in that generalization is a product in that market (this includes YOU, 
in case you didn’t realize).
Now, moving on to the second point, you have probably been through enough 
online dating profiles to get some perspective on what women are looking for.  If you have been as 
obtuse as to not even note what it is that women seek, do your damned homework and start by re-
reading Chapter 1!

You are a product. 
A brand. A package 
that offers promise.
You, my friend, are 
the solution to her 
problem!

Chapter 2 - Research Methods & Marketing Intelligence
Here’s a quick run down of what women say they want:
•	
Attractive men
•	
Successful men (translation: MONEY)
•	
Sense of Humor
•	
Good teeth
•	
Good job
•	
Decent height (5’10” or taller)
•	
Decent hair
•	
A bit of a “bad boy” (we’ll thoroughly explore the bad boy phenomenon Chapter 5)
•	
Chivalrous men
By chivalrous, I mean those guys who will bring flowers home for their woman for no reason, those 
guys who will run a candlelit bath for their woman for no reason, those guys who will rub their girl down 
and suck on her toes with no expectations of any sort of sexual gratification in return.  You know, Saints.
Let me tell ya, there are no future expectations that will alter this market – they will generally remain 
the same as above, forever and always.  You won’t need to re-examine what the market on the whole 
wants; you will have to re-examine what each individual woman or target you meet with wants from the 
list above.
With that list in mind, you want to think about what sort of strategies you will need to employ to garner 
female attention, depending on how you are seeking dates.  The online dating scene goes by different 
rules than the real life dating scene.  Before you start having a panic attack, just chill out.  We will point 
out the differences with the different types of dating available to you, and help you create appropriate 
strategies for each.
I promise: If you follow my instructions carefully and correctly, and you play your 
game right Thou shalt be laid before the year’s close!  (Unless you’re reading this 
book on New Years Eve. In that case, you’re probably shit outta luck, bro).
Gathering Information On The Dating Scene
When marketing and branding yourself, you first gotta figure out:
*	 Who is your target dating market?
*	 What is it that you can do better than every other Joe Shmoe on 
the planet?
*	 Why exactly do you do whatever the hell it is you do with your life?
*	 How do you stand out and above the rest?
Again, if you dare say “I don’t know” to any of these questions after reading this book, you just aren’t 
thinking hard enough.  And you probably don’t deserve a woman and should get used to enjoying dates 
with warm pies and your tight fist ‘til the day you die.
Gathering dating information online is fairly easy, given that you can just click on a profile and, 
assuming that the girl is telling the truth, see what she likes, dislikes, and what she’s looking for in a 
man is blatantly stated and disclosed.  But use your smarts.  If a woman’s statement is really a raw, 
explicit sexual come on, she may be a working girl.
I’m not asking you to break out your old high school notebook and a number 2 pencil, but again, if you 
haven’t been taking any notes about what girls want and are looking for, take a night or two out of your 
quest for love to find out.  Are you what they’re looking for?  Even if you think you’re not, dig deep and 
find that one part of you that is.  I’ll show you how to breathe some life into that part.
It’s a good idea to actually jot down what you ARE good at: what are your talents?  What are your

skills?  What are some things that you are complimented on regularly, or hell – at least once? 
Compliments from your mother DO count, by the way.  Write them down.  It’s important to know your 
“specs” as a product.  You need to know and believe in what you have to offer.  These are your “points 
of differentiation.”
Once you have figured out what you’re good at, do start to make connections with what you have 
to offer and what girls are looking for.  You think you’re funny?  Awesome.  You fulfill the humor 
requirement.  You’re over 5’10” tall?  Excellent.  Be sure to mention that in your profile and during 
future conquests.  Continue to draw similarities with both the general market, and then when you start 
to single out girls you want to contact, be sure to play connect the dots with both of your interests, 
likes, dislikes, etc. as well (we’ll talk about this again later on).  And frame your good features with 
some skill.  Notice the difference between saying, “I spend a lot of time on my computer” and “if 
you’ve got a problem with your computer, I can probably fix it.”
You may also want to venture outside of your house to gather information on the real-life dating 
scene.  First, choose a pub (not a club, they’re far too noisy and annoying) that caters to the same 
age demographic as the women you seek (for instance, if there’s a pub in town that has mostly 50+ 
year olds and you’re looking for a hot 22 year old girl, don’t waste your time.  Different ages are 
looking for different things in a relationship or sexual encounter).  Once you’re there, run a poll!  Balls 
up and approach all women in a non-threatening, non-perverse way and tell them you’re conducting a 
survey on “what women want”.  They will probably assume that you’re using this as a cheesy pick up 
line, but as long as you’re posing no threat to them, there’s a good chance they will let you in on the 
female mind.
Best of all is when, after you have your answers, you thank them politely and do not continue to hit 
on them.  Believe me, most girls will be shocked, and probably will hunt you down later that night 
with more advice, or just chase you around and tease you.  It’s WAY better than your typical Thursday 
night at home with a beer and the TV, right?
Here’s the bonus: You might think you’re being a complete dork, and buddy...you are.  BUT!  This will 
get you used to approaching women in a friendly non-threatening way.  This is a skill that will get you 
laid more often than you can imagine.
Be sure to read the next chapter on statistics and further information on the online dating scene to 
begin to appreciate and hone your skills.  The more you know and utilize the information in this book, 
the more successful you will be.
Deciding Your Target Market
Listen up!  You need to figure out what you’re looking for in a woman.  The standard shot gun 
approach of blasting emails out at anything that moves just ain’t gonna cut it.  What do you want?  
Fat, skinny?  Smart, dumb?  Educated, drop-out?  Smokin’ hot, ugly?  Young, old?  Freaky, straight?  
You need to figure it out and you need to figure it out fast.  If you can’t define what your target 
market is, you won’t be able to sell the solution (you)!  So here’s the thing I hear from most guys: “I 
want a younger woman”, or “I want an older woman.”
Alright, I have to take a moment out of my day here to explain to you that if you’re 50, your 
chances of scoring a 20 year old babe are extremely – EXTREMELY – slim.  Of course, there are

gold diggers out there who will jump you if you happen to drive a Ferrari, own a yacht and flash your 
thirty thousand dollar Rolex when you shake her hand.  For the other other 99.9% of us, you’re shit 
out of luck.  If you’re 50 and you’ve accomplished nailing a 20 year old (assuming you are not Hugh 
Heffner), please call me and share your secrets. 
For the most part, women are looking for men somewhere within 10 years of their age, with a 
preference for an older man than a younger.  So if a girl is born in 1980, she will generally accept any 
offers from a guy born from 1970 to 1990.  Any guy who is born after 1990 doesn’t really stand as 
much of a chance as the guy born in ‘70 at getting into her pants.  
Ideally, girls will tell you that they want a guy who is 2-5 years older than 
them.  Why an older guy?  Older guys are (presumably) more established in 
their career, with their finances, with their vehicles, homes, and whatever else 
that spells S-E-C-U-R-I-T-Y to a female.  It is important for you, as a man, 
to recognize this general preference.  Look for women who are 2 to 5 years 
younger than you for optimal success.  If you’re too old, you’re too old. Deal 
with it. 
I’m not necessarily trying to discourage you from trying for that hotter, 
younger piece.  No, I completely applaud you for trying.  But I also want you to  
be real with your expectations.  This being said, if you’re a 50 year old man, a 
35 year old woman may very well give you more consideration than a 25 year 
old woman would give to a 40 year old man.  Still a 15 year age gap between 
the two, but what a 25 year old desires and where she is at in her life is far 
different than that of a 35 year old female.  A 35 year old woman who is still 
single is staring into the abyss of spinsterdom.  Your morning wood could keep 
her from falling in - see what I’m saying?
Older Women
I think it’s also important to talk about going for the older woman.  Some of you young guys really 
go for this.  I’m going to tell you that generally, younger men going for older women will prove far 
more successful for SEX, but far less successful for a RELATIONSHIP.  Most older women don’t 
want devotion and commitment, they want a good time!  Most of them have been married anywhere 
from one to five times, and they cannot be bothered with that whole love business.  They wanna get 
laid.  A young guy can out last an old guy.  So if you want sex, here’s your ticket.  And when I say 
sex, bank on my words here, an older woman is far more into experimenting and doing freaky-shit 
than her younger counter-part.  Maybe it’s the ticking clock, or maybe it’s boredom.  Who cares!  If 
you want the ride of your life, go for the old broad.  If you want a soul mate, steer clear or be wise, 
compassionate, mature and loving far beyond your years.  Good luck!
Younger Women
This book is generally written with the idea of men going for women who are around the same age, 
or younger.  The truth is though, the majority of men, regardless of their own age, DO want a younger 
woman, girls already know this.  They know this and the younger and hotter they are, the harder they 
will make you WORK FOR IT.  So this is why I’ve written this book: to show you how to conquer these 
women and fulfill your quest for physical, and perhaps even emotional, fulfillment.
Marketing Resources
I’m focusing on online dating, so we’ll be stressing the keyboard approach to unlocking her heart and 
then attempt to guide you by the hand when you first meet her so you don’t completely screw it up.  
When looking at your market resources, however, it’s a good idea to check out a number of different 
online dating sites, as well as other dating resources for information on what’s out there in the market.

Chapter 2 - Research Methods & Marketing Intelligence
I know.  I know.  Your saying, ‘But Dating Commando, 
I don’t wanna do research, I wanna get laid!’  Just chill. 
The main purpose of all of this research is so that you can 
appropriately BRAND yourself and decide just what kind of 
product you are, and also come to a better understanding of 
what you actually want: do you want that busty 23 year old 
with no commitments and a bitchy attitude?  Or do you want 
the 35 year old looking for marriage and maybe a baby or two? 
Something better, perhaps?  
Read on for some market research tips:
Newspaper Advertisements
Newspaper classified personals are especially useful when 
trying to see what’s out there locally, as well as what kind of 
guys are looking for WHAT.  For instance:
35 SWM seeks fun loving, warm 20-30 SWF
Okay, so the 35 year old dude thinks he can bag a hot 20-30 
year old woman.  GOOD LUCK, asshole.  
Boy-like 29 year old man looking for 
true love in an adventurous 25’ish lady.
Alright, see?  Now here’s where you start seeing trends.  Guys around the 30 year old mark are 
wanting FUN and ADVENTUROUS (translation: LOOSE and EASY) hot chicks who are, hopefully closer 
to 20 years in age, but they’re also accepting applications from 30 year olds.
Anyway, the point here is, you now have the average age of guys who are looking for a certain age of 
woman.  Are you that age?  Are you also looking for women with similar qualities?  See how much this 
newspaper ad sucks?  Just what the hell does boy-like mean (below the belt, mayhap?)?  These guys 
are your competition.  Start looking at them that way, rather than wishing their sorry asses luck.  
They’ll certainly need it once you graduate to Dating Commando status.
Oh, and these are pretty funny, though they won’t help you with your research:
HAVE VIAGRA
Need woman.  Any woman between 18 & 80.
WANTED: somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke 
[address removed]
34 SWM seeks woman or cat to keep lap warm.  Red heads preferred
Cadillac cruiser seeks deluxe seat cover (an actual ad)
Online Personals
There are tons of free online personals out there, apart from those on dating websites.  One of my 
personal favorites is Craig’s List (www.craigslist.com).  Lots of material, although this website is less 
valuable for finding what men are looking for, and vice versa, due to poor organization and well, shit 
like this:
Friends with Benefits...you Benefit Financially!!! - 31 (*******)
The Dating Commando

21
Chapter 2 - Research Methods & Marketing Intelligence
I’m 31, in the financial industry 6 feet tall, about 175 Ibs, 
brown eyes, black hair, i’m half persian/have indian, i work 
insane hours and travel insane amounts of the time 
No wonder i’m single!! 
So what am I looking for, this is where you think I’m an idiot, 
or you might be interested in a Friends with Benefits arrangement; 
I want someone amazing to spend time with. That can make me 
laugh, can make me yearn all day to talk to her. I’m open to a 
casual relationship, where we meet 5-6 times a month, have an 
amazing time with each other with no commitment. This would start 
off as a physical relationship but develop into a friendship that 
benefits us both. I’m also willing to reimburse you financially for 
those visits. 
If your interested, write back with a photo. Hopefully your the 
one I’ve been looking for.
So many things are wrong with this… grammar: incorrect.  Weight: incorrect (you know being about 
175 lbs means at least pushing 200 pounds).  YOU benefit financially:  INCORRECT.  I’m not sure 
if this is an advert for hiring a prostitute or what, (he will “REIMBURSE [ANY WOMAN] FINANCIALLY 
FOR THESE VISITS”).  Holy crap!  I’m half tempted to contact this asswad myself and ask him if any 
woman has actually responded in a POSITIVE manner.
There are some ads though that will help you with gathering some insight, such as the one below:
I want a Woman that Knows what She Wants - 31 (******)
I am a well put together, established and financially set guy. 
What I want is a woman who doesn’t play head games to figure out a 
man because I know what I want. I’d love a woman who knows what 
she wants and does not have to beat around to the bush to get it. 
I’ve dealt with enough insecure women who would constantly find 
guys to hurt in order to make themselves feel better. I’m simply 
looking for an attractive woman, age 24+ who is not going to play 
games. A woman who is faithful and knows how to treat someone 
right as I do know how to treat a woman right. Someone reliable 
and puts their partner on priority. 
I hope this is not too much to ask. Please reply if you feel the 
same way. 
Phone Services
Ever called into those dating chat lines?  You know those ones that are advertised later at night (and 
no, I’m not talking about the SEX chat lines – DATING chat lines).  Livelinks and Quest are good 
examples. Anyways, you can sign up for “free trials” (just be sure you do not get yourself looped 
into any long term commitments) and just listen to some of the messages left by both the men and 
women.  Listen to:
*	 Their ages, and the age of man or woman they are seeking
*	 What their interests are
*	 Qualities they are looking for in the opposite sex
*	 Any mention of how one should dress or be groomed
*	 What they would like to do on a date
These things are all part of your market research plan and will help you craft your game.
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online

Chapter 2 - Research Methods & Marketing Intelligence
Here’s an example of a phone service dating transcript:
“[deep breath] Hey ladies, I’m Jeremy, a tall 6’2” 43 year old 
guy just looking for his Miss Right. I love women with a sense of 
humor and a great appreciation of the Arts.  She’d also be my age 
or maybe 5 years younger.   If this is you, leave me a message at 
*****”
So there you go, a 43 year old man wants a woman within 5 years of him.  See the trend of men 
wanting women within 5-10 years (younger) than them?  Not so uncommon.
Live Chat
It’s excellent practice to spend about 30 minutes in a live dating chat, such as Yahoo! Chat or 
whatever other free chat services there are.  Poll a few of the men and women in the room, either 
publicly or through private message, and ask them the same questions as mentioned above: age, 
what their interests are, what they’re looking for in a mate, etc.  Be sure to make note of everything, 
and hey – if you feel like trying to work a bit of the game you’ve already developed just from reading 
this much of the book, be sure to practice on ‘em!
Here’s an example of a live chat conversation:
JustMe1234 [pm] Hey, how’s it going tonight?
MissyMooBrownCow [pm] Just fine, tx!
JustMe1234 [pm] Just curious (and no, I’m not trying to be a 
total creep) what are women in this chat usually looking for?
MissyMooBrownCow [pm] lol np, uhh, usually ne guy from 30 – 50 
yrs old, not completely broke and NOT MARRIED..!!!
JustMe1234 [pm] Ha ha oh yeah, I hear you on the not married 
thing!  I’m guessing you’re looking for a guy with a sense of 
humor?
MissyMooBrownCow [pm] ya, and at least a bit intelligent.. 
dark & hansome… caring & sweet.. u know?
JustMe1234 [pm] When you find him, send me his number =P Just 
kidding!
“PM” means private message to you noobs (or newbs) who don’t have a clue about online dating 
yet.
You’ll find that the older the woman gets, the more she’ll stress that she doesn’t want a married man 
and how she doesn’t want a guy who is broke.  Younger women will say they want rich men; older 
women just want a guy who can pay his rent.  Funny how their expectations change with age!
Branding
Who are you?  No, I don’t mean your goddamn name, I mean who are you?  What do you do with 
your free time, what’s your opinion on life in general?  What do you stand for?  What you like to do 
when out on a date, what do you wear, how do you stand…
Yes, these things AND MORE are all part of your BRAND.  Even how you lean against a wall or what 
kind of socks you wear are all part of YOUR BRAND.  What you wear and how you act speak volumes 
about who you are – far more than what you actually do say.  The ominous “they” tend to believe that 
women and men alike pass judgment and decide who you are to them within a fraction of a second.  
Scary, huh?
Decide What You Have To Offer
You must start thinking of WHY you are better than that next asshole standing beside you.  What do 
The Dating Commando

23
Chapter 2 - Research Methods & Marketing Intelligence
you have to offer that he doesn’t?  Yes, feel free to use this as an ego-boosting session (hell, we can 
all use those from time to time, right?).
Show your expertise whenever you possibly can.  When brainstorming, don’t stray away from basic 
skills.  Say you’re good at fixing small mechanical things or you’re a wonderful graphic designer.  
Telling her that you have a keen sense of smell and can open a beer bottle with your teeth is useless 
information that’s not going to impress her.
Next, think about what you have going on inside that makes you awesome.  Driven?  Intelligent?  
Maybe you’re empathetic and understanding.  Maybe you’re all four!
Be sure to make note about your good outer qualities as well.  If you think you’re handsome, believe 
in it!  If you like the shape of your feet, great.  If you have perfectly manicured fingernails, that’s just 
fantastic.  Write ‘em down and pat yourself on the back, big guy.
Education, cars, home, and money also count fellas, so for those of us who can boast about shit like 
that, remind yourself that you earned those things and you should feel proud.  Girls who you date 
could potentially also stand to benefit from your good fortune and hard work.
Be Seen
If you’re reading this book, chances are you were and still are a bit of a wall flower.  Don’t worry, by 
the time you’re finished with this shit, you’ll definitely be visible to the ladies and on their radar.  
We will speak again later about what to wear and how to decide WHAT to wear, but here are some 
general rules to go by (or “buy”):
Clothing 101: What (NOT) To Wear
1)	 No knee socks
2)	 No socks with sandals (I know, I know, it’s comfortable, but chicks hate it alright?  You gotta 
play by their rules for the time being)
3)	 Invest in a quality coat/jacket, watch, suit and sunglasses.  These are staples that you will 
wear OFTEN and will be seen in OFTEN.
4)	 Scrimp on jeans, t-shirts, button-down shirts, socks, ties and belts
5)	 Be sure to wear underwear FREE FROM HOLES, FREE OF STAINS and FREE FROM BEING 
OVERSTRETCHED (I’m not referring to you stretching out the crotch area, perv).  Wear boxer 
briefs, if possible; they are rather complimenting to most male figures.  Women tend to laugh 
at briefs (aka “TIGHTIE WHITIES”) so avoid these at all costs.
6)	 NO LOGO TEES.  For the love of GOD, who the hell thinks that shit is cute?  “My shirt 
expresses my inner feelings and what I like!”  Shut up.  No one cares.
“If you wear Tighty Whities, she’s 
going to laugh at you...and you   
deserve it!”
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online

24
Chapter 2 - Research Methods & Marketing Intelligence
7)	 NO HAWAIIAN SHIRTS or GAWDY PATTERNS.  I don’t know why Hawaiian shirts ever gained 
popularity…I call these “fat man party shirts” for a reason.  Think about who you usually see 
in ‘em.  Christ, even Hawaiians don’t wear them!
Now take a look at the car you drive.  Shallow, yes, BUT important.  If you’re driving around in a 
beat up rusted 1989 Toyota Tercel, no matter what you do, you are NOT getting pussy.  I know kids in 
high school who won’t get laid in that kind of car!  It may be time for you to consider trading it in.  We 
will talk about this again later on, but use your common sense:  Ferrari or Ford?  New car with power 
EVERYTHING, or old beater missing the left back window?
Traits To Live By
Here are some of the top words that women use to describe exactly what they are looking for in a 
man (just in case you haven’t actually done your market research like I told you to!):
Laid Back
Easy Going
Creative
Down to Earth
Funny
Caring
Positive
Artistic
Adventurous
Driven
Thoughtful
Wild Side
Passionate
Warm
Devoted
Loyal
Athletic
Intelligent
Now please don’t be a dick and add every single one of these traits to your profile.  I mean, come on 
and get serious.  She’s not going to believe it if it sounds like the copy was written by an ad agency.  
Besides, you fuck it up for the rest of us.  I’ll show you how to write a killer profile in Chapter 4.
I always recommend that you write down a ton of words like this that are actually relevant to you.  
Pick the best two or three, and use them when describing yourself to women.  If one of the words 
doesn’t seem to be going over well with the ladies on a regular basis, change it up.
Choosing your qualities will tie in again in Chapter 4 when creating your online “tag name”.
Envision The Finished Product
What’s most important here is how you see yourself, and then projecting that image all the time.  I’m 
guessing you aren’t seeing yourself as some slump shouldered, hump backed hopeless romantic that’s 
begging for a date.  I’m HOPING that you’re seeing yourself with a straight back, strong shoulders, 
raised chin and a confident stride.  Whether you’re laid back and easy going, or driven and a go-
getter, this posture says everything.
See the clothes: what are you wearing? What style of jeans do you have on?  Does your shirt have 
a collar?  Think about the hair cut and the shoes you decided to throw on your feet.  Think about the 
colors you’re wearing (colors can speak volumes about character, or even how one is feeling on that 
particular day).  Think about how much more awesome this guy looks than you.
I often advise people to try and picture a person whom they admire and copy them: posture, clothes, 
hair cut, anything and everything possible.  Spice it up with your own good qualities and personal 
touches, and then BAM!  Make it your own.  You GO, boyfriend!

Chapter 2 - Research Methods & Marketing Intelligence
Chapter Conclusion
You are a product.  The goal here is to turn you into a product of desire.  A solution to her 
love and romantic problems.  
Learn what you’re up against so that you can prepare yourself appropriately.  The dating 
scene in my area may be different from YOUR dating scene.  I can guarantee you the dating 
scene in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan (yeah, there really is such a place!) is WAY different than 
Los Angeles; find out what you’re up against to plan the best strategy.  This is how a true 
Dating Commando rises to the challenge of dating women online.
Have realistic expectations of the age of women you will be dating.  If you’re 70 years old 
and don’t have any cash in the bank, that 21 year old hottie is probably not going to even give 
you a once-over.

Chapter 3 - The Unofficial Dating Site Manual
True Dating Commandos do their research.  Then they do MORE research.  And - can you guess 
what’s next? - MORE research!  As you just learned, you MUST know the market you are working with 
and what you are up against before you can execute a flawless game plan.  Research is what will set you 
apart from all other players.  And it doesn’t have to be boring.  This is applied research.  You’re doing it 
in order to apply yourself to something that is the most fun you can have without laughing.
I’m assuming that most of you guys who are reading this book have explored 
the online dating pool.  If you’re an online dating virgin, you’re in for the shock 
of your life!  Almost every girl imaginable is online and they’re all looking for that 
one guy who is going to make their life complete.  Hmmmm...sounds like the 
same thing you’re looking for!  Though you may not actually be that guy, you can 
certainly take a risk and send her a message.  Far less intimidating than actually 
approaching her, isn’t it, you pussy?
You’ll find yourself skipping out on the bar nights and clubs on Friday and Saturdays just to view 
pictures of hot girls online (and believe me, there are a LOT of pictures that may make you a bit 
uncomfortable in the pants).  It’s easy to get caught up and send out as many messages to as many 
hotties as you possibly can.  Like I said, it’s a number’s game, right?  Sending out this message should 
work:
Hey im Chris.  ur super sexxxy.  msg me!
WRONG!  You’re playing this shit all wrong, and so are most of the guys out there.  Besides, 20% 
of women out there probably think “msg” is a food additive (look it up!).  Dating sites, unfortunately, 
do not come with a user’s manual (though they REALLY should).  This is where I step in.  Whether 
you’re fresh on the scene, or you’re an old online dating vet trying to catch a break, if you follow my 
instructions and play your game right, I can pretty much guarantee that you’ll be getting replies to 
YOUR messages.
Before I teach you all of the tricks of the trade, you’ll first need to read this book in its entirety.  That’s 
right, READ THIS BOOK BEFORE YOU CONTACT ANY WOMEN.  If you want success with a girl, this 
is a fuckin’ INVESTMENT right here.  
First, we’ll start with some of the marketing research I did myself to help you lazy assholes who DIDN’T 
do the work I told you to do in Chapter 2 (am I awesome or what?).
Statistics
If you’ve been checking out some dating sites at least semi-sober, you will have already realized 
that some of the sites publish statistical information for marketing purposes and to promote the site’s 
advertising capabilities.  Don’t like reading statistical information?  Fuck off, this is useful shit AND it’s 
the kind of shit that makes YOU a Dating Commando!
So the goal with the stats is to understand YOUR TARGET MARKET.  You need to know:
•	
WHO they are
•	
WHERE they live
•	
WHAT they do
•	
WHY they do it
...and a hell of a lot more.

Geographic Distribution
Were you aware that dating sites receive well over 48 million visitors every month from the US of A?  
Another 21 million visitors live in Canada, with 12 million visitors logging in from the UK and, bringing 
up the rear, is Australia with 2 million visitors.  For those of you who are more visually inclined, I have a 
fancy pie chart for you below:
 So as you can see here, the United States comprises over half of all visitors that hit up dating sites.  
Either we’re advanced daters (because we’re using technology to hook up and all) or we’re incredibly 
bored and desperate.  If you’re living in Australia, it looks like you’re shit out of luck in the dating 
market.
 
Age Distribution
As you can probably tell from this chart, there is a fairly even age distribution amongst those 18 to 
29 years of age, 30 to 40 years of age, and 41 to 50 years of age.  The part that blows MY mind is 
the number of people over 50 years old who are dating online.  I’m sure this number is only going to 
increase as years pass.  Get your cougar spray holsters ready!
As you can see, there’s 
enough for everyone!

41 to 50 - 24%
Over 50 - 17%

Income Distribution
This is the part where you probably feel shitty about your McJob (don’t know what that is?  Look it 
up in that urban dictionary online) and your shitty by-the-hour pay.  This chart is showing that the 
average income of online daters is actually only $25,000 to $50,000 per year.  Guess there are not too 
many high rollers out there hitting the online dating scene.
Okay, let’s look at it this way.  There’s roughly 100 million online daters out there.  So, doing the 
math, that means that 19 million earn less than $25,000 per year, 22 million earn between $25,000 
and $35,000, 21 million earn between $35,000 and $50,000, 19 million earn between $50,000 and 
$75,000, 5 million earn between $100,000 and $150,000, and 4 million are raking in over $150,000 
each year.  Anyone up for a little gold-digging?  Any rich ladies out there looking for a boy toy?
Gender Distribution
So are you wondering how 
many penises there are to 
every vagina out there?  This 
was one of my concerns 
when looking up stats, 
mostly because I also really 
had no IDEA how many men 
there were compared to

I was a bit disappointed 
to discover that men 
outnumber women at a 
typical ratio of approximately 
1.5 to 1!  For every two 
women, three guys await.

THE BAD NEWS:  I’ve carefully researched statistics related to gender 
distribution on a number of online dating sites.  Sorry to tell you guys that the 
numbers are even more grim.  For niche-based dating sites, men comprise of 
about 70% of all visitors, making the ratio of men to women jump from 1.5 
to 1, to 2.3 to 1.  And it gets worse on the hook-up sites where men average 
about 90% of the subscription base!  A 9 to 1 ratio...good luck getting a Friday 
night date!
Availability Status
Surprised to find out that not everyone on a dating website is looking for 
love?  They aren’t all just looking for a booty call, either!  Some women are 
there JUST to make friends (aww, how quaint!).
Some women are on the site to find a replacement partner; someone better 
than what they have in order to move on, or they’re cheating on their current 
partner (if you’ve bought the e-book version of this book, you have already 
received “The Cheater’s Guide To Online Dating” as a FREE bonus).  Some of 
these women are separated, divorced, married, or living in SIN (Sex Infrequently Numbnuts).
Body Types
Apart from the age statistics, body types are usually the most interesting stat to us guys.  No shit, 
right?  I mean, it’s no surprise that men are driven to seek out a woman with a body and a face that 
they like.  No offense to the ladies, but this is really the most important part to any guy; you may be 
the nicest woman on the planet, but if you don’t have the ass, tits and the eyes that we’re looking for, 
we’re heading in the other direction...unless we’re desperate.
Here’s a disturbing fact:  Women LIE about their body type.  Yes, it’s true!  They usually make 
themselves “one size down”, so yeah, some of them are fuckin’ liars.  That’s what you’re up against!
Okay, so a quick analysis of the stats tells us that 17% of women online do not disclose their body 
type (translation:  1 - THEY’RE FAT, 2 - They’re  bean poles, 3 - One tit is twice the size of the 
other).  You don’t know what you’re in for with these ladies, so I’d strongly suggest avoiding them like 
the plague.  Unless horrifying surprises are your thing, in which case go to ‘er man!
12% of the women online report having a thin body type, 18% claim they’re athletic, and 18% claim 
that they’re average.  Now, take into consideration that the news and medical professionals have told 
The ratio of men to 
women averages 
1.5 to 1 on the 
mainstream sites.  
The niche sites can 
see a jump as high 
as 2.3 men to every 
woman.  The ratio 
is even higher at 
9 men to every 1 
woman on the sex 
sites.

us that over half of Americans are overweight, so since the other half are then perfect or underweight, 
this may be true.  18% of women report being slightly overweight, whereas 17% report being big and 
tall aka “big boned.”
Horniness Factor aka Search Type
Yeaaaah this is by FAR my favorite demographic!  Hell, I’m going to assume that it’s EVERYONE’S 
favorite demographic (how could it not be?).  Assuming that each woman who has signed up and 
registered with a site understands what she’s actually saying, this is a good indicator of what they’re 
actually looking for.   
If she says she’s looking for:
*	 Intimate Encounter: She wants to fuck!  QUICK!  Though umm, some women actually do 
think that this means “looking for a long term relationship” so just be careful with this one.  
Your one night stand may turn into marriage if you aren’t too careful.
*	 Talk/E-mail:  Self explanatory.  She wants to talk or email with you.  “Friend”.
*	 Friendship: Also very self explanatory.  
*	 Other:  Who the hell knows what they want?

The last three you generally want to avoid if you are looking for love or sex.  They are, I would say, a 
WASTE of your time.
Why is all this statistical information important to a Dating Commando?  
Well, let’s throw a scenario out there: you’re a 35 year old single guy, living in the United States and 
you want to find an athletic woman in your age category, and you want a long term relationship.  You 
also want her to bring in at LEAST $65,000 a year.  What are your chances?  
Or here’s another scenario: you’re a 21 year old male who wants an older woman in her later 
twenties or early 30s with an established career (hoping she can help you with yours, you lazy 
bastard).  Again, what are your chances?  
It’s these types of questions that the stats will help you answer.
Dating Site Tours
Unless you’ve been living under a fuckin’ rock for the past couple of years, you should know the url’s 
of at least 4 major online dating sites.  www.match.com  www.lavalife.com  www.eharmony.com  
www.plentyoffish.com (don’t worry, I’ll give you an extensive list on the Dating Commando website).  
Easy enough to remember, right?  Good.  Now don’t forget them.
Look, this shit is really simple and I almost feel like a cad for wasting trees telling you this.  So 
instead of fuckin’ around getting into painful details (which aren’t really that important any way), I’m 
going to give you a global overview of what you’ll typically find.  Seriously dude, every friggin’ site out 
there is almost the same.
The home page of every single site out there will provide you with a chance to either log into your 
account, register for an account, or browse through the profiles.  Of course, some sites insist you sign 
up for an account before they’ll let you browse the profiles.  Just the way it goes.
Almost every site out there will let you sign up for free.  Take this in its literal meaning - you can sign 
up for free, but you won’t be able to message or communicate with anyone unless you pay - unless of 
course you’re on a 100% free site like Plenty of Fish.
The Dating Commando

Chapter 3 - The Unofficial Dating Site Manual
NOTE:  I am in no way affiliated with Plenty of Fish, but I am going to refer to them a lot in this 
chapter.  The reason is that not all of you can afford to spend $29.99 per month on a membership 
site, and I respect that.  Besides...it’s free.  As in FREE.  So damn, makes it really easy to talk about.  
Especially considering that most sites, short of cosmetics, are pretty much the same.
Here’s a quick review of what you’ll find on most of the sites:
*	 Mail box: just like your email, this is where you’re going to find all the messages coming from 
interested ladies!  Usually this area will link you to your sent and saved messages too.
*	 Profile: We’re talking yours here.  God...this should be pretty straight forward.  You can post/
edit/change the information that others see about you right here.  You’ll be able to manage 
your image collection, preferences, profile scripts and much more from here.
*	 Online: Sometimes this is a link, sometimes it’s a piece of text attached to her profile.  But 
this lets you know who is online right now.
*	 Search: Slightly different than the Browse option, this will allow you to search the profiles 
on the site based on a selection of criteria such as distance, age, type, and more.  Advanced 
search grants you more search parameters.
	
TIP: This is the best way of finding the targets in your area that meet most of your 
criteria.
*	 Forums/Chat: Most sites maintain user forums or user managed chat rooms.  They are 
generally topic driven based on a variety of interests. 
	
TIP: Avoid the Forums and Chat areas, anything you write here is permanent and 
can be used against you. As well, until you become a Dating Commando, you run the risk 
of writing something completely asinine.  However, it’s a good place to do a little Market 
Intelligence research on potential targets.
*	 Logout: This is pretty obvious.  But seriously, when you’re done...log out.  Nothing will suck 
more than your kid sister, brother or one of your asshole friends or coworkers jumping on the 
site and fucking you up.
*	 Matches: Most sites do their best to intelligently (I’m being snarky!) connect you to other 
members.  The Matches area will display the profiles of women who the AI system thinks are 
ideally matched to you.  Besides that the major criteria used tend to just be age and gender, 
this is a great place to start your search.
*	 Favorites: Some of the sites allow you to store a list of favorites.  I use it as a system 
of bookmarking.  When I find someone I like and want to contact later, I add them to my 
favorites.  However, you should be aware that many sites allow users to see who’s added 
them to a favorites list!
That’s the basic tour.  Seriously, most sites are pretty easy to navigate, and there’s not much more to 
know.  If you don’t get it after ten minutes of snooping around, you’re a lost cause or the site is shit.
 
Profiles
So before I get into how to write your own profile, let’s talk about the extreme importance in learning 
how to read a woman’s profile.  Profile analysis will help you determine if you are dealing with a dud 
or a prime dating candidate.  I want you to keep two things in mind: 1) what, or who exactly are you 
looking for? and 2) Most people lie on their profiles (don’t you do it though!).
All of the dating sites include detailed profiles that help you find what you’re looking for.  You can 
search for such things as the last time a woman has logged in and used the site, the city in which 
she lives in, whether she’s a smoker or non-smoker, her “sign” (astrological, at least I’m assuming 
anyway).  But seriously, do you really want some crazy be-atch that depends on the planets to 
determine who her next fuck buddy should be?  Sounds like she’d be the stalker type when you break 
up with her.  But I only say that because I’m a Leo.  Her body type (again, remember that EVERYONE

lies about this!  Factor in that she’ll reduce her size by the next lowest option selectable), height, 
religion (Dude!  Seriously, religious chicks can be the HORNIEST sluts out there!), age (don’t be a 
stupid asshole; an 18 year old woman has NO FUCKING INTEREST in a 40 year old man, no matter 
how many times you’ve seen a young filly drool over an old man in those XXX flicks sitting on your 
shelf), ethnicity (heh heh...yeah!  Asian chicks!), profile photos (as in the availability or lack of - and 
again, most chicks LIE!!!  Expect the photo to be of them when they used to be in their prime), what 
they’re seeking in a relationship (hot sex, walking wallet, etc.), drinking preferences, marital status, 
income, and the list goes on and on and on.
There are four, yes FOUR sections on her profile that are of UTMOST importance to the Dating 
Commando.
•	
Appears On #’s Friends Lists (or Favorites)
•	
Interests
•	
About Me
•	
First Date (or other such fluffy fodder)
Appears On #’s Friends Lists: Okay, listen up and listen up but good.  Regardless of what the site 
calls it, friends, favorites, hotties, whatever; this is THE MOST IMPORTANT part of her profile.  Even 
if she claims she has no control over who’s lists she appears on.  They do have full control in that they 
can remove themselves from a being a favorite at any time.
I tell you this because any woman who appears on more than a reasonable number of favorite’s lists 
is WASTING YOUR TIME!  She’s either a skanky fuck-slut or she’s there to prove to herself that 
she’s hot and in demand.  Even an ugly girl can get on a hot list.  Show a little skin; pose seductively 
in nothing but a bra and panties on a bed and blammo - instant online hit.  Why not just run a hooker 
ad?  I get such a kick out of these women when they complain about guys hitting on them for sex.  
What the hell do they expect?  
Anyway, here’s the problem with a chick who appears as the favorite of hundreds of guys - there’s 
way too much competition for her time and affection and you don’t stand a hope in hell with her.  Keep 
in mind that for every one guy that added her to his favorite list, at least another 6 to 10 have sent 
her a message.  So if the chick appears on the favorites of 250 men, she’s probably received over 
2500 messages.  Holy bat shit!  She’s not dating, she’s running a friggin’ post office.  Waste of time.  
And what’s a reasonable number?  Personally, depending on how hot she really is and what she’s 
doing in her photos, any more than 15-20 favorites and I move on.
Interests:  This is an excellent place to find common interests that you share with the woman you’re 
targeting, and it is also an excellent starting point from which to develop conversation.  I always try to 
incorporate their interests into my initial scripts and from time to time will refer back to their interests 
in a clever or not-so-obvious sort of way.  I’ll discuss how to do this later.  But you should spend time 
reviewing her interests. 
This is also an excellent way to find out if the girl you are targeting is going to be a decent match.  
Whether you’re looking for a one-night stand or a long-term relationship, it’s important to have 
something in common that allows you to connect.
“If she appears on the favorites list 
of 250 men, chances are she’s received 
over 2500 messages already!”

Chapter 3 - The Unofficial Dating Site Manual
Make notes of her interests and always keep them handy.  If she likes rock climbing and you’re 
terrified of heights…chances are it’s not going to work out.  At some point you will have to meet and 
interact with her.  If you lied just to get the date, it’ll be the first and last date she’ll ever give you (like 
your height or weight – don’t be a dick, don’t lie).  If your interests do not align, it’s okay, just move 
on.
Here’s the really cool thing though that allows you to salvage her if your interests don’t match up.  If 
you find one of her interests “interesting” and it’s something you would like to learn more about or 
even try...blammo.  You’ve got a GREAT starting point for communication and dating.  
Let her know that you’ve always had an interest in rock climbing and it’s something you would really 
like to do, but your fear of heights has always somehow managed to get in the way.  You can let her 
know that you’d love to talk to her about her adventures and what she loves about rock climbing…and 
who knows, maybe you’ll actually work up the courage to do it, especially if you get to watch her ass 
jiggling above you.
About Me: Her actual profile or description of herself is the second most important part of the 
profile.  You need to spend a lot of time reading, reviewing, and understanding what is said here.  It’s 
sad, but some women on the dating sites are major time wasters.  No wait; MOST are time wasters.  
They are on the site to reinforce their sense of self, or to screw guys over due to some baggage 
they’re carrying from past relationships, or they’re completely uncertain about the whole online dating 
thing and are just testing the waters.  Or, I swear some of them just want some guy to add to MSN 
to talk to constantly yet never meet in person (the fuck’s up with THAT?).  And this is probably why 
you’ve been experiencing the horrible miserable luck that is your online dating life.  Fear not and read 
on my good friend.
When you learn how to read the About Me section you’ll develop a keen sense for the time wasters.  
They are actually easy to spot because they make the same mistakes and say the same things that I 
caution guys against.  Their profiles are negative in tone – “tired of dating the same boring guys and 
want someone interesting”.  That’s a sure giveaway that she’s got problems and you should just ignore 
her and move on to the next one.
Or maybe the profile is too short and demanding.  “I’m really special and you better be too.”  
Whatever!  Move on to the next girl as any girl saying this is high maintenance.  
My absolute favorite is the “way too high expectations” girl who’s is looking 
for the “buff 6 foot 2 inch firefighter calendar model, who works out every day, 
well travelled, excellent chef, well educated, financially secure, great looking, 
wonderful sense of humor, interesting, owns a huge gorgeous home, reads 
to handicapped homeless children in his spare time or when he’s not rescuing 
cats, and drives a Maseratti.”  Wow.  If you find this guy, let me know – I’d like 
to date him too!  Joking of course, so all you buff Maseratti calendar models 
can go fish in another pond ‘cause this fish ain’t biten’!
I rank this kind of guy with Santa Claus.  Neither exists, they’re both 
fantasies.  Okay, there’s one in Florida and two in California, but let’s be real. 
The girl that advertises this in her profile is not going to be happy with anyone 
she finds and is most likely a serial dater.  Avoid serial daters like the plague.  
That is, unless you enjoy being dicked around, wasting time and money, and 
having your heart and ego stomped on.  In which case, go for it and enjoy.  It 
could be as much fun as whipping yourself on Shrove Tuesday.
Just as with the Interests section, this is prime picking for your initial contact script.  If you read, 
study and understand her profile, you’ll be able to nail a response almost 100% of the time.  It’ll be 
highly focused and perfectly tailored to her.  If she doesn’t respond, she lied.  It’s that simple.  That’s 
of course assuming you followed my instructions on how to write your initial contact script in the first 
place.
If her profile is 
negative or she 
says dumb things 
like “tired of dating 
the same boring 
guys” or “tired of 
the mind games,” 
ditch her and move 
on.  She’s a time 
waster and has way 
too much baggage.

A word of caution.  Some women are so fucking full of themselves that they believe this makes for a 
good profile description:
anything fun and spontaneous but a chance to have some good 
conversations, if you want to know anything just ask
What the fuck?!  How are you supposed to work with that?  I’ll tell you how - you don’t.  This girl 
is lazy beyond belief and expects you to do all the work.  She’s giving you nothing to go on and you 
don’t stand a snowball’s chance in hell of “guessing” what she wants.  What is she?  All together 
now...”A Time Waster!”  Getting the idea here?
First Date: In my most humble of opinions, and I’m not very humble, this section is a waste of time 
and is bullshit.  However, it will give you a good sense of what she is all about.  Remember what I told 
you in the introduction.  Most women are on the site for two reasons:  
1)	 They’re looking for Prince Charming, and or;
2)	 They are very, very horny.
The First Date section will indicate what their intentions are and what degree of romance their minds 
are set to.  Some women will expect a guy to whisk them off their feet and surprise them with a 
private jet to Paris for a Cappuccino.  Other women will expect their man to show up in a limo and 
take them sports fishing.  Yet other women are a little more realistic and want to meet in a safe 
location over a quick coffee.  
And still others yet will flat out say that they expect the first date to be everything but the ordinary 
and if you even dare propose the idea of the typical coffee meeting then they won’t waste their time 
to respond.
Do make note of what they have said in that First Date section of her profile, because you will use 
this information in your initial contact script.
In my opinion, the first meeting should be a coffee meeting.  I’ll get into more detail later, but my 
idea of the first date is this:  
We’ll meet for a quick coffee, because who knows?  Maybe you’re a 
man posing as a woman or maybe I’m a woman posing as a man.  If 
we keep it to 15 minutes, you and I have an easy out.  But hey, 
if we hit it off, and I mean really hit it off, be prepared for a 
fantastic night out on the town.  
Registration
Hey!  Before you jump off all half-cocked (pun intended jackass), note that I want you to just simply 
read this section first.  Do not attempt to set up your account yet.  I’ll walk you through the account 
set up in Chapter 4 - so patience my friend, patience.  Wax on...wax off. 
If you want to go on dates, you need to set up an account.  Always start with a FREE account and 
do a little recon work first before you flip open your wallet and shell out 30 bones (recurring unless 
you somehow manage to find their phone number and call in to cancel).  You do this by clicking the 
REGISTER button.  Holy sheep shit it’s that easy! 
Now remember, I asked you not to set up an account yet, but rather to first read this section very 
carefully.  Again, I’ll show you how to do all this in Chapter 4, and in great detail.  For now, I just 
want to focus on showing you what to expect.
The first thing you’re asked for is a “user name”.  Selecting the right user name is EXTREMELY 
The Dating Commando

37
Chapter 3 - The Unofficial Dating Site Manual
important.  When you send an email message to a woman, she will often look at the subject line first 
(what is this message about?), followed by the user name (who is this message from?), and then 
she’ll conclude with reading the message (what is the message?).  The user name not only identifies 
you, it tells her who you are as a person and whether she should consider giving you the time of day.
It is imperative to pick a user name that will grab her attention and as well as captivate her at the 
same time.
You are then asked for a password.  Don’t be an idiot and pick “1234” or some bullshit.  Pick a secure 
password.  You don’t want some angry woman or ex-girlfriend to hack your account and mess your 
game up (and they WILL; oh, how they will).  A strong password consists of at least eight characters 
and includes upper and lower case characters, special characters, and numbers.  For example:
$eXxYf@ck34
	
(Translation: sexxyfacker)
B0$$m@nm3
	
(translation: bossmanme)
	
Pu$$ywr3nch
	
(translation: pussywrench)
You get the idea?  Good.
The next step is to supply an email address.  Email addresses are never revealed to other members.  
However, the system will notify you when new matches are found, when events occur in your area or 
online, or when a member contacts you.  You can turn all of these settings off later, but do be aware 
that you may not want to use your work email account.  In the bonus book, “The Cheater’s Guide to 
Online Dating”, I provide a lot of information about setting up anonymous, secure email accounts.
The final questions ask for your gender, birth date, country of residence, and your ethnicity.  Ethnicity 
is not a form of racism; think about it.  You may prefer Asians or Latinas.  Not all people like dating 
outside of their own ethnic group, either.  It’s nothing personal; it’s just the way it is.  
Answer these questions honestly.  Don’t kid yourself; women will be able to tell that you’re 50 when 
you said you were 25, or that you are white when you claimed you were Chinese.  Hell, even my blind 
grandmother could tell.  Don’t be an asshole and waste everyone’s time; lying won’t do you much 
good.
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online
Chapter Conclusion
The ratio of men to women on online dating sites is any where from 1.5:1 to 2.3:1.  This 
means that we guys have to work a lot harder than women to get ANY action. 
If you’re looking for a date, stick with any women looking for Dating, or be brave and venture 
into the Other and Activity Partner categories.  Don’t bother with the rest if you are looking 
for a girlfriend (unless you wanna get laid.  In that case, definitely contact those ladies in the 
Intimate Encounters section!).
If a woman is on too many favorite lists, make note that you will want to avoid contacting her 
for good times (I don’t CARE how hot she is!).
When creating your password, make it as complex as you can while still being able to 
remember it.  Capital letters, lower case letters, numbers and symbols, will protect your 
account from being hacked (either by a computer nerd or an insane ex-girlfriend).

A
re your palms sweating yet?  Are you salivating at the idea of beginning your dating quest?  
Well you should be.  Here it is, the beginning of your new life: setting up your brand spankin’ 
new online dating account.  
The rules that I’m going to mention in this chapter apply to ANY and ALL dating websites.  Specific 
questions may be a bit different or contain slightly different wording but hell, you can figure out where 
the differences lie and how to respond in kind.
If you can’t figure that out by yourself, just go the fuck home.  I can’t help your Forest Gump single 
digit IQ.  Although Forest did alright.  Come to think of it...keep reading.
An English Lesson – Adjectives, Adverbs, And Verbs
Let’s divert for just a moment and discuss three very important components of communication:  
Adjectives, Adverbs and Verbs.  No, don’t rip the book in half!  These three building blocks of the 
English language are important, dude.  They will give zest and meaning to your emails, profile, subject 
lines, and user name.
I know having to take an English lesson sucks, but these three components alone will make your profile 
and messages stand out well ahead of the pack (see? English class DID have a use after all!).  Proper 
use of Adjectives, Adverbs, and Verbs will get you responses to your initial contact scripts.  I don’t 
expect you to become an English scholar, but the way you express yourself counts.  Like it or lump it, 
regardless of what she’s written, grammar counts!
Adjectives:  These are words that describe or modify another person or thing in a sentence.  Examples 
can include good, bad, little, much, many, some, far, beautiful, rich, impossible, sufficient, unique. 
Adverbs: These words are used to modify a verb (action word) or an adjective.  They typically answer 
questions such as how, or in what way, where, why, and to what extent.  Most end with “-ly”.  Examples 
include:  slowly, quickly, softly, suddenly, gradually, recently, effectively, frequently, well, badly, little, 
much, early, happily.
Verbs:  These are action words.  A verb is a word that denotes an action, an occurrence, or a state of 
being.  They help put objects or concepts into motion and they help to clarify objects and concepts in 
meaningful ways.  Examples include:  appraise, appreciate, ask, attack, connect, concentrate, crawl, 
crash, sneeze.
You get the idea.  It doesn’t need to be more complicated than this.  In fact, this is pretty easy stuff.  If 
your head hurts just from reading that, you seriously need some help.
Use adjectives, adverbs, and verbs when creating your user name, subject line, profile, and contact 
scripts.  I’ve created an appendix of adjectives, adverbs, and verbs at the end of the book to help you.
The UserName 
The username means a lot more than you realize.  So much so that, if you can’t come up with 
a good user name today, I say walk away from the computer and try again tomorrow.  Seriously, it 
matters just that much.  This is your handle, your PERSONAL IDENTIFIER that defines who you 
are and what you stand for in less than 1 second.  Change just one letter in a name and everything 
collapses, i.e.,  Harrison Fork, George Clowney, Cameron Ditz.  Your username is a reflection of your

unique and “beautiful” personality.  It sends a strong message about just who you are and what your 
women suitors can expect.

Which one sounds the most intriguing and exciting?  
FERRARI
JUSTANOTHERFORD2873
Expensive
Cheap
Exclusive
Lots of them around
Classy
Lackluster, plain
Exotic
Typical, boring
High Performance
Plodding, slow, lethargic
Highly Desired
Nobody Cares
Don’t like European sports cars?  How about this:  
 
2010 Dodge Challenger Hemi or Honda Civic 23.  Which one seems more interesting?  Which one would 
you rather take out for a drive on a hot sunny Saturday afternoon?
How To Create The Right User Name
Choosing the right username can, and should be, a complicated and time consuming task.  In fact, this 
should be the one element, next to your profile description, on which you spend the most time. 
You are a brand.  Remember this from Chapter 2?  If you have already 
forgotten, put down the beer, turn down the game and start reading from the 
beginning again.  Like any great and desirable brand, you need a name that is 
unique, interesting, and easy to remember.  It needs to sound good, make sense, 
has to be easy to say and is somehow memorable.  You also need to ensure that 
you spell it correctly or, if you decide to spell it in a clever or cute way that it can 
be easily understood and identified.    
The end goal here is to get women to respond to you rather than run away.  
Risqué or questionable names can be a complete turn off.  Also remember that you 
will eventually meet some of the women you’ll be connecting with.  You want to be 
sure that your user name won’t cause either of you any sort of embarrassment, such as:
SausageSlinger420
BabyNips
IGotanAudiBellyButton
BuddyDooDoo
Your username should inspire curiosity and dialog, not nausea and revulsion.  You want her to ask you 
what it means and you want to be able to respond with something clever and engaging.
Research the usernames of other men on the site.  Do this by changing your search preferences from 
Man looking for Woman, to Woman looking for Man.  These guys are your competition.  And no, it’s 
not gay to do this kind of a search...you fag.  Find out who has a great username that really catches 
your attention and then dissect that name to figure out why it had impact.  Just as important, look at 
the lame usernames and make note of what makes them so bad.  Don’t make the same mistakes as 
your competition.  The good news is that you’ll find that really compelling and cool user names are few 
and far between.  You want to stand out from the herd of ho-hum monikers.
Like any great and 
desirable brand, 
you need a name 
that is Unique, 
Interesting, and 
Easy to Remember!

Chapter 4 - How To Setup Your Online Account
Do not use your real name or variations thereof unless you do not value your privacy.  Avoid using 
profanity or any sort of derogatory terminology or phrases.  Don’t use your zip or postal code, and do 
not use your address.  Don’t use your email address or phone number.  Don’t use numbers, and avoid 
the use of emoticons or any words that imply emotion such as love, loneliness or desperation. 
Take a few minutes and write out 10 things that interest you.  These can be hobbies, sports, things 
you like to do on a Saturday night, and things you like to do on a Sunday morning.  Keep them 
positive and avoid anything that is sexual or implies emotion (that means “masturbation” is out!).
Here’s my list:
1.   Beagles
2.   Coffee
3.   Workout
4.   Diving
5.   Travelling
6.   Photography
7.   Writing
8.   Design
9.   Gaming
10. Movies
Now take a few minutes to write out 10 words that describe your lifestyle.  Keep it positive and 
avoid anything sexual or implies emotion.
Here’s my list:
1.   Night Owl
2.   Early Riser
3.   Quirky
4.   Fun
5.   Yuppie
6.   Digital
7.   Straight Edge
8.   Achiever
9.   Experimental
10. Adventurous
To help you out, I’ve provided extensive lists of both common interests and lifestyles in the 
Appendices at the end of the book. 
The final step is to write out 10 Adjectives or Adverbs that seem to describe you or your 
personality.  Again, kept it positive, avoid anything that is sexual or emotional.
Here’s my list:
1.   Adorable
2.   Adventurous
3.   Cheerful
4.   Cute
5.   Devilish
6.   Dynamic
7.   Fearless
8.   Handsome
9.   Humorous
10. Vivacious
11. Zesty
Yeah, I did 11.  That’s how I roll – plus I’m just that damn interesting!  Feel free to add as many as 
you like.  If you use the list at the back of the book, it’s really easy (just like I told you it would be).
The next step is to grab a Thesaurus (you can use www.thesaurus.com) and come up with as many 
variations on each interest and lifestyle description you’ve selected as possible.  You know what?  
Change that...don’t do more than 10.

Putting It Together
If you’ve made it this far, you’re going to be okay from here on in (congratulations).  If you’ve 
struggled, don’t feel bad.  It took me almost three days to do this the first time I tried.  Most guys 
seem to get it within a few hours – granted that’s if they put that beer down like I fuckin’ TOLD them 
to a few paragraphs ago!
To put together a username, all you need to do is follow this formula:
Interests + Lifestyle + Adjective (or Adverb) = UserName
You don’t have to follow that order.  It can be in any order you like.  Since there are only three 
variables, here are all the possibilities:
Interests + Adjective + Lifestyle
Adjective + Interests + Lifestyle
Adjective + Lifestyle + Interests
Lifestyle + Adjectives + Interests
Lifestyle + Interests + Adjectives
Let’s give it a try.  I like the following words from the Interests Matrix:
Sleuth   Coffee   Cappuccino   Athlete   Adventurer   Poet   Artist   Cinema   Diver
The Dating Commando

Chapter 4 - How To Setup Your Online Account
I like the following words from the Lifestyle Matrix:
Nighthawk   Quirky   Kinky (this is a dangerous word as it has sexual connotations)   Ticklish   Witty
Brainiac   Hip   Trailblazer   Daring
Let’s put together a new matrix:

Adjectives
Sleuth
Night Hawk
Adorable
Coffee
Quirky
Adventurous
Cappuccino
Kinky
Cheerful

I bet you can already see names starting to form!  Keep in mind, this isn’t a strict form, and by that 
I mean you can change up any of the words to suit your needs.  For example, Cinema might not 
work as well as Filmmaker.  Feel free to change it up.  Or, maybe after completing your home work 
assignment you don’t feel you have a username that really nails what you’re all about and represents 
your brand perfectly, you might find some inspiration that helps guide you a little closer.  
Also keep in mind that coming up with 10 words in each category doesn’t mean you’ll end up with 30 
usernames that are great.  You might only end up with one.  And that’s the point…you just need one 
good one.  Let’s take a crack at it:
Fearless + Cappuccino + Diver = FearlessCappuccinoDiver
Devilish + Brainiac + Poet = DevilishBrainiacPoet
Cute + Quirky + Adventurer = CuteQuirkyAdventurer
You don’t need to mash all the words together either.  It’s perfectly fine to separate them with 
underscores (_) or dashes (-).  Here’s they are again:
FearlessCappuccinoDiver
Fearless_Cappuccino_Diver
Fearless-Cappuccino-Diver
DevilishBrainiacPoet
Devilish_Brainiac_Poet
Devilish-Brainiac-Poet
CuteQuirkyAdventurer
Cute_Quirky_Adventurer
Cute-Quirky-Adventurer
You’ve got to admit those names are kind of fun.  They certainly make a statement and they 
definitely serve as conversation points.  I can pretty much guarantee any woman will want to 
know the story behind the name.  And that’s EXACTLY the goal.  Get them speaking to you, asking 
questions, responding.
Yes, I know, it’s been so long since a woman responded to you, but believe me – they can, they do, 
and they WILL.  And notice that I capitalized the first letter of each word?  This makes it much easier 
to read.
Here’s a few more usernames that come to mind:

words work, GREAT!)
Hip-Artist
Fearless-Poet
If none of your words seem to be working for you, try creating the matrix again.  If that still doesn’t 
work, you might want to go abstract with it.  An example of abstraction would be:
Caffeinated-Squirrel
In itself, it doesn’t make much sense but it does paint a strong visual picture and should inspire 
dialog.  It does not imply emotion, sexuality, or negativity.  While it is reasonably safe, it also doesn’t 
really say much about you and that may be counted against you.  Use abstraction as a last resort and 
at your own risk. 
           
Examples Of Really BAD User Names
Anything that implies negativity, sexuality, or emotion MUST be avoided.  It never ceases to amaze 
me at how many guys simply just don’t get that women do not want to know your emotional state or 
how well hung you are.  Besides, if you have to “say it”, you probably can’t “prove it.”  
Here are some examples of really bad user names.  Some are a bit ridiculous and some are pretty 
typical.
HungLikeAHorse
LastChance2MeetMe
EarnMe
2KnowMeIsToLoveMe
MassMurder101
Suicidal2
StalkerGuy
RegularJoe200
FedUpWithWomen
Lovin2meetU:)

DivorcedAndLooking
SuperHung
TiredOfDating
CanTurnYouOn
PamperedPrincess
Frank348
69-4-U
Cockasaurus
CockasaurusRex
Vaginator
VaGeeJay
ManGina
Just to be absolutely safe, let’s review those names quickly.  This will give you an idea of why they’re 
so bad.   Ask yourself what type of mental picture does each name paint and what does each name 
say about the person.
HungLikeAHorse: If you’re hung like a horse, maybe you should be dating a goddamn horse.  
Seriously, women are not sexually interested in you yet…give it some time.  Besides, if you really 
are hung like a horse, imagine how pleasantly surprised she’ll be later (and don’t kid yourself, she’ll 
notice long before you end up in bed).  This is an okay-ish name if you’re on a sex or gay site.  But 
for women, either they’ll think that you’re a fucking liar, or you’re an egotistical idiot who is not worth 
their time.  To which they then say, NEXT!
LastChance2MeetMe:  Why?  Are you dying?  Are you giving up on dating?  This almost sounds like 
a threat.  Threatening calls to action are best left in television ads.  Clingy, needy, and desperate.  It 
reeks of shit, and women are not particularly fond of that, so they’ll step right on over you.
EarnMe:  Sounds like a lot of work.  Implies you are high maintenance.  Besides, women want you to 
earn them (as you justifiably should, at least in the beginning).
2KnowMeIsToLoveMe: Well, I don’t know you.  Guess I don’t love you.  If you’re such a Don Juan, 
I don’t think I want to get to know you out of fear of accidentally falling for you.  You seem full of 
yourself (this is a bad thing, by the way).  This name is also kind of clingy, needy, and desperate.  
Smells of shit, step right on by (unless you feel like hosing off your shoe later).

MassMurder101:  First, the obvious.  How many women are interested in dating mass murders?  
Probably none.  And you’re the 101st mass murderer?  Wow.  This says nothing positive about you at 
all.  Extremely negative and you need help…or imprisonment.
Suicidal2:  I’m not suicidal so don’t include me.  And if you are truly suicidal you need psychological 
help, not a date.  SEEK COUNSELLING IMMEDIATELY.
StalkerGuy:  Just what every girl needs, a personal stalker to call their own.  Not funny, not cool - 
unless you like restraining orders.
RegularJoe200:  Boring.  And there’s 200 of you?  How sad…
FedUpWithWomen: If you’re so angry and frustrated why are you on a dating 
site?  Maybe you should be dating guys instead.  This name is just downright 
hostile.  Women will opt to avoid you rather than take pity on your bad luck.  Good 
luck, asshole.
Lovin2MeetYou:  Clingy and needy.  Reeks of desperation.  As cute as it may 
have sounded to you when you wrote it, it’s just freaking creepy and gross.  PASS!
FatGuy: First off, it’s not very attractive.  The type of women that will come to 
you are probably in worse emotional and physical shape than you are.  Also, it 
lacks confidence and security.  Sounds like you’re making excuses before they’ve 
even had a chance to meet you.  And trust me, at this point they do not want to 
meet you.
Okay, you get the idea.  I’ll let you finish off the last few on your own.

Homework Assignment 1:
Examine the real usernames above.  Check off the ones that actually speak to you and say something 
about the person that is interesting, sparks your imagination, and inspires you to ask questions.  Write 
down what those questions are.
Cross out the ones that don’t do anything for you.
Now, when creating your own username, you want to make sure you pick ones that are actually 
interesting, spark your imagination, and inspire questions.  You don’t want to pick names that just 
don’t cut it.
Cockasaurus and 
TheVaginator 
are examples of 
incredibly bad and 
offensive names 
that should be 
avoided - unless 
you’re on a gay 
dating site and 
looking for men.

Chapter 4 - How To Setup Your Online Account
Homework Assignment 2: 
I want you to write out 10 words that describe your interests, 10 words that describe your lifestyle, 
and 10 adjectives or adverbs that describe your personality.  Use the Appendices at the back of this 
book to help you.
The Final Registration And Profile Form
Now that you’ve successfully created a kick-ass username that’s really going to get some attention 
and inspire her to ask you questions, you can fill out the rest of the basic registration form.  Provide a 
password, email address, your gender, date of birth (I usually offset mine by a month and a random 
few days to prevent identity theft, but then I’m a wee bit paranoid), the country you live in, and your 
ethnicity.
 Zip code/Postal Code: All of the dating sites use this in combination with your city, State/Province, 
and country to locate matches near you.  Report it correctly for the best responses (no, they are not 
going to send you shitty advertisements in the mail).
Seeking a: Generally there are only two options here, female or male.  I don’t think this requires 
explanation, but what the hell…I’ll do it anyway.  If you’re a male, select Female.  If you’re a female, 
select Male.  If you get hung up on this detail, I must ask: how the hell do you function in life?
Do you want children? :  Many women use this as a method of determining whether or not you’re 
husband or daddy potential.  Even if you do want kids, I suggest leaving this as Prefer Not to Say, or 
Undecided/Open.  Here’s the reason why:  You need to keep a little mystery about yourself, and you 
don’t want to say too much up front.  You need to have something to talk about later.  Answering this 
up front kills conversation topics and reduces the number of potential targets.  Plus, some women find 
the idea of children intimidating, especially if they’re younger and are undecided themselves.
Marital Status:  It is very important to answer this option honestly.  She will find out eventually and 
if you lied, it won’t be good.  If you’re married and you answer single, keep in mind that women can 
be pretty nasty about seeking revenge and most won’t think twice about ratting you out to your wife.  
Let me rephrase that:  ALL OF THEM won’t think twice about ratting you out to your wife.  If you’re 
single, say it.  If you’re divorced or widowed, say it.
Height: Again, report your height honestly.  The goal is to meet the women you connect with online.  
If you report that you’re 6’2” and you’re actually 5’4”, you’re going to have a hard time explaining the 
difference.  Additionally, relationships that start out with lies tend to fizzle and die out tragically quick.
Do you have children? :  Again, provide an honest answer here.  If you have kids, be proud of 
it.  It gives you some great conversation fodder.  Women tend to find men with children far more 
endearing.
Body Type: I’m going to warn you again:  most people report their body type inaccurately.  For 
some reason, they select the option that is one less than their real body type.  If you’re truly serious 
about second dates or more, don’t fuckin’ lie!  Resist the urge to lie and claim that you’re athletic 
(even if you’ve been working out), if you’re a few extra pounds.
Do you smoke? : Again, answer honestly.  Smoking, in my opinion is a disgusting habit.  However, 
I don’t judge those who do it.  I just prefer not to date them.  If you are a smoker, keep in mind that 
non-smoking women will most likely not be interested in you.  If you’re a smoker, you might want to 
find women who do smoke.
Do you do drugs? : Unless you’re looking for a drug addict, your answer should be no.  Druggies 
have problems and a lot of baggage.  Most women prefer to avoid drug addicts.  Can you blame them?
Do you drink? : If you drink, and most of us do, your answer should be Socially.  Leave it at that.

The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online
If you’re a raging alcoholic, she’ll find out quick enough and maybe you should be in AA rather than 
hitting the dating scene (do NOT go looking for dates at AA!).
I am looking for: The best answer here is Dating.  After all, you’re on a dating site.  Dating can 
lead to other types of encounters, but you need to get the date first.  If you’ve bought this book, it’s 
because you’re having problems getting those dates.  Leave the other answers alone until you’ve built 
up a bit of experience.
Religion: This is a tough one.  Personally, it’s my opinion that religion shouldn’t come into the 
equation until long after the first date.  However, it is important to some.  I believe that if you’re truly 
serious about your religious beliefs, you should declare them.  If you’re a non-believer or if you’re not 
interested in sharing this aspect of your life, select Other.  Selecting Other also gives you a lot to talk 
about if she has strong religious beliefs.
Do you own a car? : Best answer here is yes.  Seriously, unless you’re being chauffeur driven 
around town, why would you not own a car?  Most women are not interested in dating guys without 
cars.  And a note for guys: you WANT to date a woman who has her own car and can drive.  However, 
if you don’t have a car, select Prefer not to say.  Play it off, if she asks, as you having an awesome 
vehicle you don’t care to boast about.  When she doesn’t see it the first date, claim that it’s in the 
shop.  If you make it to a second date, you may have some explaining to do…or you may blushingly 
admit that you’re a bicycle riding environmentalist good guy.
Income Level: You are best off leaving this at Prefer not to say.  If you’re making a million a year, 
it’ll become very apparent after the first few dates and you won’t need to tell her.  If you’re living on 
income assistance, she’ll figure it out too.  Show, don’t say.
Education: At a minimum, you should select High School.  If you’re in College or University, select it.  
Women really dig smart guys.  The smarter you are, the better.
If you’re lacking in the “smarts” department, read on.  I’ll help you to appear more intelligent to 
women, even if you are a complete dumbass (which obviously you’re not!).
Profession:  Be as vague as possible.  Remember, we want to keep a little mystery about ourselves 
and have a something interesting and fun to talk about later.  There are also some things that you 
should just not admit to, such as being a fluffer (don’t know what one is?  Look it up).  Think twice 
about using “waste management.”  Tony Soprano took that one.
Interests:  It’s important to take some time and complete the Interests field.  The Interests field 
helps her to communicate with you and gives her good idea of the type of person you are.
The Interests field will also help her to find things of common interest to write to you about.  In 
addition, it will serve to help you write your profile and to create your initial contact script.
I’ve created a small table of interests in Appendix A at the end of this book.  You should try to 
provide at least 10 items of interest.  Interests do not necessarily need to be things that you currently 
do or participate in.  They can also include things that you would like to know more about, would some 
day like to do, or are just plain interested in.
You should consider the Interests field to be of great importance. 
Headline
If we think of your username as your personal brand, the headline is your branding statement.  A 
branding statement is also known as a positioning statement.  It expresses how you want to be 
perceived by the rest of the world.  It speaks loudly about who you are, what you represent, what’s 
different about you, and what unique characteristics make you the best option.  Unless you have none, 
in which case you are a lost cause.

Chapter 4 - How To Setup Your Online Account
The automaker Lexus has a strong positioning statement:  “The relentless pursuit of perfection.”  The 
statement speaks strongly and says many, many things.  First, it makes the claim that each Lexus 
is crafted to a high standard where perfection is the goal.  It claims quality, thought, and class.  It 
indirectly claims that no other car offers these same qualities or is crafted with the same degree of 
care and attention.
When searching profiles, women almost always tend to see the username and headline first, before 
anything else.  In other words, the username and headline could be your first and only chance to 
make an impression.  
Statistically speaking, 8 out of 10 women will read the headline, but only 2 out of 10 will bother to 
read your goddamn profile.  It’s therefore really, REALLY important to get the headline right.  The 
better the headline, the more likely you are to experience greater responses and dating success.  This 
is also an incredible opportunity to demonstrate your unique character and individuality, as well as 
being an opportunity to be playful and a little flirty.
We’ll discuss the concept of sexualizing every conversation and interaction a little later in this book.  
Until then, understand that if you want to have women see you as a serious 
dating candidate, a lover and more than just a friend, you need to sexualize the 
relationship as quickly as possible, with a combination of tact, skill and humor.  
Remember, women DON’T want an animal! They want a fun, caring, engaging 
man…who’s also an animal.
Here’s an example of what I mean.  A good friend of mine runs his own creative 
business where he is exposed to hot women every day.  He used to boast about 
having a different dinner date every night – and all of them super hot.  Yet he 
never really had a girlfriend or even romantic encounters.  One night I called him 
on his boast.  “Are you really out on a date, or are you just out for dinner?” I 
asked.  “Oh no, it’s a date!” he retorted back.  Really?  Does she know?  I had to 
wonder.
Of course, she didn’t.  She had no idea why he was out with her and what his 
intentions were.  He was the safe “gay friend” (even though he’s not gay, but he 
may as well have been.  Refer to the GFS section of the book for more information 
on this horrible syndrome).  He asked for help, so I hooked him up because 
I’m nice like that.  I met up with them after their dinner for drinks.  Within two 
minutes, I had his date twirling her finger through her hair, leaning in close to talk to me, laughing at 
all my jokes and even telling a few of her own, and touching me every time she spoke.  When it came 
time to order drinks, I ordered a Tom Collins.  She had never heard of it before and asked what it was.  
I leaned in and coyly whispered to her that back in my University days we used to refer to it as panty 
remover.  She looked shocked, laughed and then told the waitress that she’d like to have one too.  On 
top of it, she ordered tequila shooters to boot.  My friend damned near choked to death.
Now THAT’S a sexually charged date and I never once said anything even remotely like “You have a 
great body, I’d like to jump you”.  Don’t ever be on the nose about sex with a woman you’ve just met 
unless she’s charging money for her time  
Oh, and for the record, tequila is just as effective a panty remover as a Tom Collins.
Your headline must be equally sexually charged or you risk being just another one of the sheep in 
the herd, or worse…a really nice guy.  The gay friend.  If you really want to know what I mean by gay 
friend watch the movie “Over Her Dead Body” starring Eva Longoria Parker and Jason Biggs.  See if 
you can spot the poor heterosexual gay pal. 
The better the 
headline, the 
greater number of 
responses you’ll 
get.  The headline 
is your opportunity 
to show your 
unique character 
and individuality, 
and it’s a great 
opportunity to 
Flirt!

How To Make A Great Headline
The rules that apply to writing a positioning statement also apply to writing your headline.  Your 
headline needs to be clear and concise.  Whatever you decide to say, you should be able to say it in as 
few words as possible and still convey meaning.  The headline should also relate directly to what you 
think women are looking for; or rather it should relate directly to what you are offering women. Yes 
you will need to do some thinking and DECIDE what you have to offer, but read the book first; I’ll give 
you some great ideas.
It should be written in the present tense.  Avoid the use of “was” and instead replace it with “am”.  
The headline should also indicate what your interests are, along with your unique qualities and 
characteristics.
Use your Interests and Lifestyle Matrices to help you design and develop your headline.  If you’re 
funny, demonstrate your sense of humor.  If you’re not funny, spare us the knock-knock jokes.
Let’s play with a little marketing to write some interesting and compelling headlines.  
The first concept is that of social proof.  This is a strategy that implies there 
is already strong demand or desire through indirect proof.  It works like a charm 
most of the time:
Who else wants ______
Example:  Who else wants the Perfect Date? 
Example:  Who else is looking for Mr. Right?
You should now have a great idea of how social proof works.  Play around with it.  
You don’t have to use who else.
The second concept is that of the big secret.  It’s used quite often in Internet 
marketing and it does work.  It’s based on the concept of insider knowledge that 
translates into a direct benefit for the reader.  When applied to your dating profile 
it can be a lot of fun and quite humorous.
The Secret of _______
Example:  Learn How Men Think – Secret Revealed!
Example:  The Secret of the World’s Best Date!
Example:  Little Known Ways to Guarantee the Best Date!
The next concept is the Do Something Like concept.  Companies that want to associate their 
products with a celebrity or a classy or reputable concept usually use this one.  Again, it works well 
with online dating.  It appeals well to vanity, dissatisfaction, or desire.
Date Like A ______
Example:  Date Like A Rock star!
Example:  Enjoy the love of your life!
Example:  Date Me At Your Own Risk!
The fourth concept is the Warning.  Warnings always catch the attention of the reader.  But you 
need to use this one with a grain of humor.
Warning: ______
Example:  Warning: This Profile is Addictive!
Great headlines 
adhere to five 
basic marketing 
concepts; Social 
Proof, the 
Big Secret, do 
Something Like, 
Comparative, 
and the Warning.  
Utilizing these 
concepts will yield 
greater success.

Example:  Warning: Reading this will change your life!
The fifth example is the Comparative.  We compare what she is to what you are.
If you love _______, I can _______
Example:  If you love scuba, I’ll show you an ocean you’ve never 
seen before.
Example:  If you’re a princess, I am your prince charming.
These should give you a really good idea of where you can go with the headline and how to create it.  
In the meantime, here are some examples of real headlines that should inspire your creative muse:
Student of life indulges passion for culture
What’s the offside rule?
Brains and brawn in equal portions
Can I ask you for directions?
Cat lover seeks Purrrfect lap!
Inspire me to write a love poem for you
Budding chef needs willing taster
Well preserved, but not quite pickled
Office worker by day, Superman by night!
Funny Guy with Killer Body and Money to Burn Seeks Gullible 
Woman.
Examples Of A Bad Headline
Searching for my Soul mate
This one is so overused, so desperate and so sad.  Any guy who uses that headline will have to adjust 
to life with his left hand since no woman is going to FUCK him.
I might be the one you’re looking for
AGAIN, this is OVERUSED.  MIGHT be the one?  No no, she wants the real deal, hot shot.  If you 
might be it, then perhaps she might just glance right over you.  No, wait – there’s no might here, she 
WILL glance over you.
Hey baby/Hello Beautiful/G’day Mate
This said sad shit all about you!  You’re simply saying hi which, though polite, is incredibly boring and 
incredibly USELESS.  Utilize the tools and the space they give you, you yutz!  Don’t waste time with 
some shitty HELLO bullshit.  Besides, every knumb-nut out there says this exact same thing.  Trust 
me, her mailbox is full of Hey Baby or Hello Beautiful.
I don’t know what to write
Uhh, okay, then come back when you fuckin’ do.  Because until then, you are boring, boring, and 
hey!  Allow me to add another heaping helping of BORING.
Lookin 4 a beuatiful lady
Okay, in case you are not aware, every fucking guy on the site is looking 4 a beautiful lady, and 
having obvious spelling errors in your headline is not ENDEARING, it’s downright idiotic.  Avoid 
substituting numbers for words, and for Christ sakes, be original!
First Date
Many women will eventually ask you for your idea of the ideal first date.  Some sites make you

supply this up-front, and some don’t.  First dates are difficult at best; I’m not gonna lie.  This is a 
great opportunity to have a little fun though, enjoy some interesting conversation, and show her your 
incredibly romantic and creative side.  Remember, women CRAVE romance.  So stop being a lazy 
bastard and show the lady a good time (you can get lazy later on in the relationship). 
I’ll talk about this more in depth in Chapter 12, but this is good introduction to the First Date idea 
and hopefully will get you thinking.
Your interests play into what an ideal first date would be.  For example, if your interests include 
motorcycles and traveling, an ideal first date might be a motorcycle trip for two to the hot-dog shack 
on a nearby beach where after you’ve had a quick snack you’ll give her a riding lesson on the bike, 
walk along the beach (by the way, most chicks find the walk on the beach thing incredibly cliché) and 
talk about love, life, and the universe.  If the timing is right, maybe you’ll even get to catch the sun 
setting across the water.  Let’s give it a try:
I’ll surprise you with a ride on my motorcycle.  We’ll drive 
through the park and enjoy the wind through our hair while on the 
way to the beach.  There’s this great hot dog shack that is to 
die for!  You’ve just got to experience it to believe it.  We’ll 
walk along the beach, talk about love, life and the universe.  
And hey, if the chemistry is right and the sparks are flying, 
there’s a great Italian bistro that serves the best prima vera in 
town.  We’ll sip a little wine and watch the sun set across the 
water as I try to think of the best way to move in for a nice, 
long romantic kiss.
Hot dog shack, eh?  Little Freudian messaging going on there or what? And by the way, if she says in 
her profile that she’s a vegetarian, blow her mind with how considerate you are by biking her to that 
tofu wiener stand on the far side of the lake.
Later in this book I’ll be teaching you how to sexually charge every conversation and every message 
without being overtly obvious about it.  I’ll explain why sexualization is important later, but the First 
Date is a GREAT place to start sexualizing.  Just read this fantastically romantic first date statement:
My idea of a first date doesn’t involve a coffee shop, chain 
restaurant, go-cart racing, or a movie.  But it may involve 
dining out, a little live entertainment, and a lot of excitement.  
By the time we finally meet for our first date, we’ll have built 
up such incredible chemistry that when you open the door, I’ll 
grab you by the back of the neck and kiss you before we even get 
a chance to leave the house!  It’ll be the start of many long, 
drawn out moments where we just won’t want to say good night.
It already sounds romantic!  I bet the man who wrote it has received a lot of responses.  
Here’s the thing:  most guys on these websites, your competition, ignore the importance of 
describing their ideal First Date.  At best, they’ll write up a lame sentence or two about going for a 
coffee or maybe dinner and a movie.  BORING!  If you write something a little more creative, a bit 
romantic, bold, and a lot of fun, you’ll have a chance at getting a bit of attention (assuming that your 
idea of a good first date is not sitting around your house, having her watch you play online poker or 
hosting a Windows 7 party).
When writing your first date statement, there are some things to keep in mind.  You want to be as 
descriptive as possible.  Women enjoy juicy, romantic, seductive details.  Women don’t like to be 
kissed; they like to be slowly and romantically seduced.  They like a man to take control, but don’t like 
to be controlled.  They want excitement and they want to be safe. 
You can find some great ideas for romantic dates from the movies.  Do an Internet search on that

shit if you need a bit of help.  There’s no shame in it!
The reality of the first date will be significantly different than the fantasy.  For 
the serious dater, the first date should be kept simple, easy to get out of if she’s 
a troll, and easy to escalate if there is a spark.  I’d also be very careful about 
grabbing her the moment she opens the door.  Be sure that she’s warming to you 
physically before you make your first move.  You’ll know the warming signals and 
if you don’t the old twig ‘n berries will when she firmly plants her knee into them.
 
The Profile
Be Original
Originality is key.  Do you really think the girl is going to read your profile when it 
sounds like you copied it from the last guy’s profile she read?  And the guy before that?  Oh, and the 
guy before THAT?
Being original not only makes you sound more fun, but it also makes you stand out and (hopefully) 
appear intelligent.  Blabbing on about how you’re looking for your soul mate and how you have an 
older brother you admire isn’t going to cut it.
Be Yourself
I don’t know who you are trying to fool, but if you aren’t being yourself, the girl is going to know it.
People who put up fronts in their profile are often called out on it.  If you’re fortunate enough to skim 
by with your profile not being called out , then your date will almost certainly do it when you meet  
(and yes, you will meet your date in person.  I PROMISE you).
Be Concise
No one wants to read some barf on the page that is lengthy, tedious and boring to read.  Hell, they 
WON’T read it.  Remember the K.I.S.S. principle: Keep It Simple Stupid!  This goes for your headlines 
too: headlines should be no longer than 3-6 words, and first date statement should also be kept to a 
paragraph.  Your description is allowed to be maybe 3 paragraphs in length, but again, keep it SHORT. 
Especially avoid excessive use of adjectives in describing yourself or your interests.  Read over the 
adjectives you use and, in line with a cardinal rule of good writing, if in doubt, take it out.
Remember, the 2000 letter or so character limit is a limit which does NOT need to be reached.  Keep 
some mystery about yourself, goddammit.
Be Clear
No woman is going to take the time to guess what you may mean by something if you are not 
blatantly clear about it.  If you believe that making your profile confusing or obscure is going to draw 
out a, “What are you talking about?” opening message from a female, you are fuckin’ delusional.  
They’ll assume that you have a mental disorder and will keep on with their search.
Be Positive
Remember the username “FedUpWithWomen”?  That sends out a clear signal: I am pissed off and 
you women can go fuck yourselves.  
You’re on a dating site to get laid or get some lovin’, right?  Act like it!
We’ll get into this more later on in the book, but being positive is KEY to obtaining and maintaining 
Women love the 
juicy, romantic, 
seductive details - 
they don’t like to be 
“kissed,” they like 
to be romanced and 
seduced.  Women 
fall in love with the 
details of the story.

53
Chapter 4 - How To Setup Your Online Account
a relationship.  No woman wants to hang around with a guy who has a perma-frown or who bitches 
and complains about every little thing.  Smile!  Be happy!  Think of all of the positive things that have 
happened to you.
And if you can’t think of anything, make something up and put her sexy profile pic into it. You don’t 
have to have great expectations, just positive ones.
Be Fresh
Change up your profile every once in a while!  If it took you two hours to think of a headline that has 
received little to no responses, then change it!  And keep changing it!  Hell, even when you have a 
headline that works, change it again.  This sends out two messages to the ladies:
1)	 You’re still on the market; and 
2)	 You take this online dating stuff seriously because you take care of your account
Examples Of BETTER Profile Descriptions:
Just in case you’re a bit stuck, here are some better profile descriptions that are out there; you can 
probably see WHY if you bother to read them (and you damn well better if you want any hope in hell 
in seeing a lady in your bed):
Weird things happen to me; nothing that you should be afraid of, 
but just realize that if we get together, you’re in for a wild 
ride.  I only have eyes for you, you only have eyes for me and 
we communicate this verbally, physically and often.  Down and 
dirty sex and warm and comforting cuddling are ever present.  
Unparalleled companionship, unprecedented generosity and 
unconditional love.  Laughing is essential.  You must be willing 
to expose yourself emotionally, because I am.  It’s the only way 
to reap love’s greatest rewards.  I’m pragmatic but spontaneous.  
I must admit, I am a bit of a bad boy -- not an awful, I’m-going-
to-treat-you-like-crap kind of guy, but someone who’s going to 
push you to your limits and then pull you back with a warm hug 
at the last minute.  I love staying up late -- whether it’s to 
party, have sex or just read a good book -- but I almost always 
sleep in on weekends.  I definitely have an adventurous streak -- 
whether it’s trying out an exotic recipe in the kitchen, hiking 
with my dog or travelling the world thanks to my good friends 
at Orbitz.  I’d rather be with a gal who has big dreams and no 
money than a gal with no dreams and big money.  Truth is, I’m 
just a nice guy (most of the time) who’s looking for some fun and 
companionship (not necessarily in that order).
I love funny gals who can hold me spellbound with a story or 
make me laugh until I cry.  I also love creativity and passion. 
Maybe it’s your love of ‘80s movies or the fact that you moved 
across country with only a duffel bag -- it doesn’t matter.  The 
right woman not only fascinates me but also brings out the best 
in me.  We push each other to be the greatest people we can be.  
We bolster each other’s egos and we leave short, thoughtful love 
messages for each other when we’re away on business trips.  If 
you’re comfortable in your own skin, have a strong sense of self 
and aren’t afraid to expose your flaws, I’m sure we’ll get along 
just fine.  But I will say that if you’ve got blue eyes, and can 
write a mean reply, I’m already melting.

Chapter 4 - How To Setup Your Online Account
Discretion is imperative for both you and I.  If you ask, I’ll 
send a photo - but be prepared to send one first.
This profile is great because:
•	
The first paragraph immediately describes what you are looking for 
in general right off the bat.  Within 5 seconds she can tell just what 
kind of guy you are.  If it takes any longer than that, she probably 
won’t bother – unless you have a smokin’ photo on your profile. 
•	
The second paragraph describes WHO YOU ARE.  So if you interested her with 
your thrilling opening paragraph, she can see if she still may or may not bother 
contacting you (if you do a good job with your second paragraph, she will) 
•	
The last paragraph clearly states what YOU are looking for in a 
woman.  All because you are a man and perhaps DESPERATE for a date 
doesn’t mean you have to sound as if you’re a desperate horn dog. 
•	
The entire thing is sexualized.  “Sexualized” doesn’t mean coming right out and 
telling her that you’re looking for a good lay, but it does suggest that you are 
not interested in being her FRIEND. You want to be her BOYFRIEND (or lover).
So to summarize, the basic rules of writing a great profile are to:
1) Open with a great short first sentance
2) Immediately describe what you are looking for
3) Describe who you are, but do so in an interesting, compelling, and thrilling manner
4) Describe what you are looking in terms of the specific qualities you look for in a   
    woman and how they impact you
5) Sexualize, Sexualize, SEXUALIZE
Pretty simple.  Use the sample profile to guide you through the process.
Uploading A Photo
Anyone who has experience with online dating will tell you that profiles with photos receive over ten 
times as much attention.  Some women will block male users from contacting them if the male does 
not have a photo on his main profile.  This is usually to assure that the man they are communicating 
with is not married.  Most married men will not post a photo, so as to not be seen by either their wife 
(though why SHE is on the site is also questionable) or recognized by one of her friends.
There is a fine art to selecting the perfect photo for your profile.  You don’t want to come across as a 
troll, nor do you want to appear as some sort of adrenaline junkie or psychotic murderer.
Most sites provide you with enough space for plenty of photos.  I suggest you select 3 photos and 
make them publicly visible, and another 3, which you make private.  
What Makes A Good Photo
A smile.  A smile makes a good photo.  And I’m not talking about one of those fake smiles, or one of 
those smiles that make you look like an egotistical jackass.  Think of a happy moment in your past.  
Feel the corners of your lips twitching?  That’s the beginning of a GOOD, GENUINE SMILE.
Outdoors, indoors, that doesn’t matter so much.  But the people around you should also be 
respectable and nicely dressed.  If you have a nice genuine smile on your face and there are a ton 
of scantily clad women prowling about in the background, you’ll look like a sleeze.  Cropping won’t 
necessarily save your ass, either; I’ve had many women ask for uncropped versions of my obviously 
The Dating Commando

55
Chapter 4 - How To Setup Your Online Account
cropped photos.  NOT a good scene.
If you’re with a bunch of dudes, be sure that they also don’t look like idiots.  I know, she’s not trying 
to date your friends, but your friends say a lot about who YOU are.  If they look decent, and you look 
decent, this affirms that you are actually normal and not a creep or serial killer.
In your pictures, you want to be sure that your attire is also appropriate.  What you wear is your 
brand, remember?  So even if you have a great smile in a picture, if you’re wearing a wrinkled shirt 
and pea-green pants, you’re fucked.  You may as well burn that picture and move on to the next best 
choice.  If you look like the PC guy in the PC versus MAC commercials, do you really think the tattooed 
biker chicks you dream about are going to respond?
What Types Of Photos To Avoid
The most obvious type of photo to avoid is a nude shot.  If the site finds the shot or if a member 
reports you, the shot will be deleted from your profile.  You also risk having your entire profile deleted.  
You mostly risk making a complete and utter ass out of yourself.  No woman wants to see the twins 
yet, okay bud?
Avoid photos with any sort of sexual overtones.  This includes the shirtless photo of your bare chest.  
Unlike guys, most women find this sort of thing to be a major turn off.  Besides, with all the other 
classy, clean choices out there, why would they go for you?  Plus men usually make disastrous sexual 
pictures; save that shit for a long term girlfriend who has to at least PRETEND to like ‘em.
Avoid photos that display anger, rage, or any other negative emotions.  While it’s true that misery 
enjoys company, most women on the site are quite happy and content with their lives and are not 
interested in taking on your personal baggage and issues.  A photo that displays a negative emotion 
is a major turn off.  Negative emotions include looking frumpy, mad, miserable, humorless, shoulders 
down, head down, and eyes covered by hair (the women really want to see your eyes!).
Avoid using photos in which you look like a slob or a bum.  If you’re a car mechanic and had a 
moment where you’re completely doused in oil from an oil change that went wrong, and the photo is 
humorous, AND you have at least 4 other good photos to support it, then go ahead and use it.  She 
might get a kick out of it.  But if you’re just an average guy with a lit cigarette hanging out of your 
mouth, unshaven, hat backwards, wearing torn, dirty or soiled clothing, look like you haven’t had 
a shower during the past few weeks…you’re going to turn her off.  Don’t use these kinds of photos 
unless you really like wasting your time, getting no results, and having women think you’re a bum.  
Even if you’re one of the 3 million liars pulling in over $150,000 a year, she ain’t gonna buy it.
Pets.  Why, oh why do so many people pose with their pets?  Are you on the site to date someone’s 
Chihuahua?  I think many users make the grave error of thinking that posing with their pet is cute and 
shows some sort of ability to be responsible or caring.  It’s great that you’re an animal lover, but you 
don’t need to pose with your pet to prove it.  Just show photos of yourself.
Children.  Every time I see a photo of a parent posing with their child I cringe in horror.  I can’t 
possibly imagine why parents think it’s a great idea to post photos of their children on a dating site.  
I know they’re not doing it with ill intent.  I know they love their kids.  I just don’t understand what 
they are thinking of.  Do not post photos of you with your kids.  If you’re a single parent, say it; don’t 
show it.  If things work out (and they should if you stick to the processes detailed in this book), she’ll 
get to meet them in due time.  You rob your children of their much needed privacy and protection 
when you do this.  There are some really sick people out there and you don’t want to unintentionally 
victimize your kids.  Besides, we’re selling “you”, not you AND your kids.
Women are particular on dating sites.  Some will complain at the drop of a hat if you haven’t done 
everything just right.  Whether you like it or not, the women run this show.  Women do not like men 
who post really long or distant shots where the face can barely be seen.  They will report this to the 
site administrators and your image will be deleted from your profile.  It’s harsh, but it’s true; so either 
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online

56
Chapter 4 - How To Setup Your Online Account
play by their rules or toss this book out now and continue failing.
That being said, do not use distant wide shots in which you can barely be seen.  And whatever you 
do, do not include your past girlfriends (I HOPE that’s obvious) or, if you can avoid it, do not use your 
friends in the shot either.
Chapter Conclusion
You’re now armed with enough information to create a killer profile on any dating site, for 
that matter.  But a profile isn’t enough to win this game.  Seriously, anyone can write a decent 
profile and as you’ve seen, it’s not that hard once you know a few secrets.  There are even a 
few websites that will automatically write them for you.  The real challenge is targeting women, 
getting their attention, getting them to reply to you and getting them to provide a phone 
number.
Think of it this way: using our Ferrari analogy from earlier in the chapter, you’ve just bought 
the Ferrari, now you need to drive it like a pro.

Chapter 5 - The Rules of Engagement
A
lright, if you have made it this far through the book, congratulations!  Here is where stuff starts 
to get REAL good.  Wondering what I mean by rules of engagement?  In military terms those 
rules determine where, when, and how force shall be utilized.  Such rules of engagement are typically 
only known to the force who intends to use them (this force would be you and your awesome Dating 
Commando skills).
Have Fun
Dude…you have GOT to have fun with this.  Otherwise you’ll feel crushed, obliterated and sob wistfully 
into your pillow each night.  That means even having fun with rejection.  Think of it as character 
building while you’re scoring better than ever before in your life.  
For centuries women have been giving men crap.  Take Macbeth, for example: did Lady Macbeth roast 
her hubby’s hump for not killing King Duncan fast enough so he could become king?  That kind of crap, 
which happened hundreds of years ago, is still going on today!  Sure, MacBeth had the muscle, but Lady 
M. had the Machiavelli.
To have fun, you really need to build up your confidence – both by faking it, and by truly feeling it.  
You have to keep reminding yourself that this is all just a game…it’s all just a game…and you’re bound 
to lose (at times, you may lose a LOT).  BUT when you win, you win big.  The more often you play, the 
more often you win, so let’s get you off the starting block!
What Is The Game?
After spending all that time setting up your profile, you’re probably ready to get going and start 
conquering the ladies.  Remember:  You are a Dating Commando.  You surpass the status of player.  
So get your head in the game and act like a winner.
Not sure what I mean by treating this like a game yet?  Here’s a great story for you.  A few months ago 
I went to a wedding in a city about 5 hours away.  I couldn’t help that notice between the speeches and 
other relatively boring shit that there was a smokin’ hot blonde bartender there.  Don’t think that I was 
the only one looking; every guy there was too, married or not!
My buddy was taking photographs for the event, and since he was single, he was going after her HARD.  
He’d approach her, and while she was fixing his drink, he’d tell her over and over again that she was 
really pretty.  Eventually he pulled out his sure-fire killer pick-up line:  “I would love to have you model 
for me and take pictures.”
(If you’ve been paying attention while reading this book, you damn well know that he broke one of the 
cardinal rules of dating: DO NOT TELL A GIRL SHE’S PRETTY!  She already knows it and saying so 
just makes you look like a suck-up.  And the old “Be my model” line is just fuckin’ lame beyond belief!)
I explained to him that his attempts were pathetic.  “But I gave her my business card and she’ll call 
me,” he says.  “Actually, I gave her three just to be sure she won’t lose my number”.  Now how fucking 
weak is that?!  What’s she supposed to do, keep one in her wallet, one in her pocket, and one shoved 
some where else (think about that one for a minute…)?  
I tell him to watch me, and watch me close.
I casually walked up to the bar with a smile on my face.  I leaned over the table slightly and asked 
The Rules of Engagement

Chapter 5 - The Rules of Engagement
her for a drink.  I barely speak to her, barely even paid her any attention...instead, I let her talk to 
me.  When the drink was served, I walked away without looking back.  I didn’t even take time to notice 
if she was still talking.  I repeated this a few more times during the evening, all the while keeping the 
conversations really short, without telling her much about myself, and also becoming progressively more 
sexual and flirty.
My fifth drink (who the hell was counting anyway?) from this amazingly hot bartender tasted more like 
gin than orange juice.  So I asked:
“If I didn’t know any better, I’d think you were trying to get me drunk!”
She coyly replied: “Maybe I am.  Would that be so bad?”
GAME ON!  I then walked away without saying another word, smiling at her as I left, of course, then 
continued to get my drink on.
I began requesting drinks while she was busy, but then would leave before getting my drink and head 
back out to the party.  Keep in mind that all the while, my buddy was still rambling on with her for 30 
minutes at a time, desperately trying to pick her up by telling her every single detail of his life (little did 
he know that he was cock-blocking himself and inadvertenly serving as my wing-man).  She would make 
the drinks for me and then actually HUNT ME DOWN to give them to me, claiming that she didn’t want 
the “our ice to melt too much”.  I had her looking for ME, and that’s with a long line of people at the bar 
waiting for her to return!
Since I’m from out of town, I was able to act like a tourist (I’ll discuss how this is an awesome way to 
get a woman later in this chapter) and asked her, “So what are some of the fun things to do around here 
when you’re done?”
“There’s a really good night club just about ten minutes from here, I’ll be going with some friends...why 
don’t you let me take you and buy you a few drinks?” she replied with a playful pensive look on her face.
SCORE!
But wait, it gets so much better, I say:
“Hmm… well, okay… but ONLY if you behave yourself, my mother did warn me about girls like you after 
all.”  
SNAP!  This definitely got a huge grin outta her and she ran her hand through her hair (that’s a good 
sign, guys).
“We’ll see about that,” she said, while biting her lip and then turning to head back to the bar.
Needless to say, we both had a great time at the club that night.  The flirting continued and turned into 
lots of tongue and lots of petting.  My buddy...well, whatever...fuck him.  Needless to say, I’m sure you 
can figure the rest of the night out for yourself.  Now that’s the game.  You don’t need to play it well, 
just better than anyone else.

Chapter 5 - The Rules of Engagement
Sex is a time sensitive thing.  Wait too long and a woman will naturally reconsider, re-evaluate, and 
probably turn you down because she fears, upon first meeting you, that she’ll look like a “slut”.  Ironic.  
More on this later.
How To Be Dangerously Attractive
Before we get into just what will make you irresistible to women, you must understand one thing: 
women are like mind readers.  No, scratch that: they ARE mind readers.  They are more perceptive 
than us, they are far more intuitive, and the attraction goes far beyond what you’re wearing or how 
you decided to gel your hair in the morning.  This especially applies to online dating, when she cannot 
even see you every day and, honestly, in the beginning doesn’t give a crap about what you may be 
wearing on that day.
In this segment, we are going to focus mostly on what goes BEYOND your actual face and dress.  
We’re going to unpack your attitude, your confidence and your charm with great tenacity and show 
you how to work what you got, or perhaps add on to what you already work with, for success with the 
women.
Don’t Fake It
Okay, if you have been misunderstanding me and thinking that I’m telling you to be someone you are 
not, you are mistaken.  I’m simply suggesting that you ENHANCE who you are through these methods.  
If you are pretending you’re someone you are not, you’ll wear yourself out trying to carry around that 
huge false mask and women will know anyway.  Hell, they’ll know even before YOU know.  They just 
know, alright?
If you’re a computer geek and try to be Eminem, it’ll be obvious.  If you’re a businessman and are 
trying to act like a cool, laid back snowboarder, you’re setting yourself up for an epic fail.  No matter 
what, be who you are.  It may take some time to perfect the art of being you (don’t feel ashamed, we 
all need to perfect and fine-tune ourselves from time to time – even me!) but once you do, you’ll be 
rolling in the ladies.
Dress
Think your style is lacking?  If I know you like I think I do...trust me, your style’s lacking!  Ask a 
sister or a close girl friend about what’s hot and ask her to go to the mall with you (tell her you’ll buy 
her lunch, she’ll definitely come along for the ride and get kicks along the way).  When you’re in the 
grocery store, pay some extra attention to those paparazzi rags they sell at the check out and see 
what the guys are wearing.
CAUTION: You probably don’t want to dress like some of those gangster rappers do.  Not only do 
women find it unappealing, but that shit will get you shot.
What I suggest is that you dress in such a way that somewhat accentuates your personality.  For 
instance, if you’re a business man and love working in the office, throw on some formal clothing, like a 
white collared suit and a tie, to show that THAT is who you actually are.  If you’re in to music, I guess 
you can throw on a band shirt…though I’d more strongly suggest that you choose clothing that you 
see your favorite lead singer currently wearing.  Really, that Nirvana smiley-face t-shirt is so passé.
It’s important to realize that clothing is a big form of marketing, just like we talked about in Chapter 
2.  It’s the wrapping on the present.  It’s like your billboard.  Market yourself just as you would with 
any product.  But what I’m suggesting to you is to not wear your dirty, dingy or worn out clothing that 
does nothing for your body shape.  And stay the fuck away from any clothing with stupid slogans on 
them (girls tend to not find them funny, though they may say so just to get you out of their face).
Now let’s move on to hair.  I don’t care if you are that business man or a peace-loving hippie: keep it

clean.  If you have stringy, greasy hair, no woman is going to want to run her fingers through it.  Hell, 
I bet she would be stopped by endless knots about one-fifth of the way THROUGH your hair.  If you 
want to keep your hair on the long side, fine.  But keep it tidy.  Also recognize that long hair is often 
something that takes away from your attraction, so you’re minimizing your choice of ladies.
Short to medium hair styles are generally far more attractive to women.  Short hair is always a good 
choice; it’s masculine and helps define you as a man.  Medium length hair is questionable, but if you 
can pull it off, it works well to your advantage.  Women, in general, do not seem to mind a medium 
length hair cut – hell, some even prefer it!  It gives them something to really grab on to.  Yeah, that’s 
right.  Women like having something to hold onto as well when their toes are curling toward the 
ceiling. 
Let’s talk about tattoos and piercings.  There are many relationship experts who will tell you to cover 
them up, but I say wear ‘em with pride.  Even if you have your head (both of them – think about it) 
pierced, keep them in.  Both tattoos and piercings work wonders in giving you that bad boy persona 
without the criminal record.  That said, I’d generally avoid psycho killer images or a fox tail sticking 
our of your anus.
Hats can also work to your advantage: a baseball cap says you’re sporty; a wool hat says you’re 
laid back and cool; a doo rag says you’re creative and socially aware (possibly).  Just be sure to 
not ALWAYS be wearing a hat.  Girls tend to suspect that, when guys are always wearing hats, that 
they’re balding which again does not work in your favor.  Remember that they ultimately want the best 
of the best of the gene pool, and baldness is not always an appealing factor.
This being said, being purposely bald can be incredibly sexy to a woman – as long as you do not have 
an oddly shaped or misshapen head.
Being The Bad Boy: Adopting Jerkitude
I’ve been the puzzled observer guy… you know, the guy sitting in the back corner, 
watching a complete jackass have the women sidle up to him and make moo’ing 
and kissing noises at him.  I wonder, “What does this asshole have that I don’t?”  I 
considered dealing non-medical grade pot or starting some covert and illegal sting 
operation to really heighten my bad boy appeal, but I really didn’t want to face 
spending the rest of my life in a 6 foot by 6 foot cell as Bubba’s girlfriend.
When I got to thinking about it, I realized that what women want is not a BAD 
boy, per se.  They don’t want some guy who is going to emotionally abuse them 
and berate them, call them names, or slap ‘em around.  They don’t want that guy 
who sells Mary Jane to the school kids or who works as an undercover hit man.  
Women only want some of the traits that are associated with bad boys and jerks, 
such as…
Confidence
Ahh, haven’t I been touting confidence enough in this book?  There’s a good 
goddamn reason: women LOVE it!  Just as men are naturally drawn to a more 
CONFIDENT woman (do you ever go after that sheepish looking bitch in the corner?  I don’t), women 
are especially drawn to men who have some cajones.  
Make decisions and stick with them.  Be sure of your decisions, even if what you choose may be 
wrong.  If you are wrong, admit it and move the fuck on.  “Okay, so I was wrong.  So what?”
This is the attitude you must have.  Everyone is going to be wrong at SOME point in their life; if she 
wants to grill your ass about going “right” instead of “left” when you guys were trying to drive to some 
restaurant, give her your short piece (like the one above) and preferably leave her on the curb.  No

one wants to live with that shit.
Aloof
Being indifferent drives women NUTS.  Prepare for a lot of moaning and bitching if you choose to take 
up this practice, but my GOD will you be glad that you did.
Here’s a tip for you guys out there: showing your emotions will only get you in trouble a lot of the 
time.  No matter what you’re feeling, it isn’t damn near as important as whatever it is that SHE’S 
feeling, whether you’re right, wrong, or otherwise.  So just shrug.  Don’t answer when questions 
are asked of you, and do not offer up information freely.  You want to keep her guessing and asking 
questions.  Be a bit challenging, for god sakes.  If it helps to keep a role model in mind, be Clint 
Eastwood, not Woody Allen. 
Put on the poker face so you can poke her, I say!  Play close to the vest until you find the right 
moment to strike, as I’ll discuss in a couple of segments.
Don’t Take Her Shit
Seriously, the second you start giving in to her whims and wishes, you’re fucked!  Anyone will take 
advantage of a person who allows it.  If she starts bitchin’ about you picking up your cell phone at 
a restaurant and you need to take that call, don’t stop and let her tell you otherwise.  You take that 
call; explain to her that it was important.  If she doesn’t get it, leave (or tell her to leave).  Say no, 
stand your ground, and walk away from impossible situations and scenarios.  Practice your aloof poker 
face and remind yourself that you are not here to be some woman’s servant; you are both here to 
complement each other and have great sex.
Don’t Wait By The Phone
If you are always available, she’ll take advantage of you, hands down.  Women are also great at 
trying to bully you out of hanging with your guy friends or spending a night at the poker table.  If 
you have plans when your woman calls and wants to do something, tell her no.  Offer up a couple of 
other nights where you are free, and if she doesn’t like them, tough shit.  And for god’s sake, don’t 
feel guilty about standing up for yourself.  I have to say this because she has 1,001 ways, overt and 
subtle, of making you feel guilty.  No, I don’t hate women.  And no, I’m not stupid.
Do not continually refresh your email account, seeing if she’s written.  Do not continually check your 
phone and voice messages to see if she’s called.  Do not check your texts to see if she’s typed at you.  
And for God’s sake, DO NOT think about phoning her!  This will make you feel tense and needy.  And 
in some way that science does not yet comprehend, she’ll feel it…five hundred miles away.  Make your 
plans, and hell, even turn down a date or two to prove that you aren’t always JUST THERE to please 
HER.
Harness Your Sexual Prowess
Nothing is more hot to a woman than a man who is sexually in charge and confident.  Weak men in 
the bedroom are an immediate turn off.  I do not mean this as only applying to sex either; think about 
kissing, or even holding her hand.  How erotic is a wet noodle?
While you’re exuding confidence, balls up and take initiative.  She is waiting for obvious physical cues 
from you to give her the excuse to go ahead and fuck you, alright?  If you do not make these cues 
obvious, 9 times out of 10 you are not getting laid, or aren’t even hearing from this girl ever again.
Let Her In
So you act like a jerk and may get away with it for a while.  But if you do not let her in and frequently 
The Dating Commando

Chapter 5 - The Rules of Engagement
show her your softer side, you will eventually be kicked to the curb – probably by her heavy fisted 
father or older greaseball  brother.
You have to choose the right moments to let her into your heart and soul.  Sharing a childhood 
memory or story is a great way to let her in.  Sharing how you feel about something, especially if it 
involves you feeling touched or passionate or saddened, she’ll melt.  Expect a hug and a hand job 
within 5 minutes if you do this. “But we’re on an elevator!”  Doesn’t matter.
Women want a guy with a hard exterior, yet with soft and pliable innards.  Be sure to only reveal 
this softer, more human side of yourself to her and to her only; reserve the harder exterior for your 
friends, her friends, and the general public.
NOTE: This is not to say that you should treat anyone with disrespect.  Always be respectful and 
cordial – just don’t tell these people your life story with your heart on your sleeve (at least not in front 
of her).
Image
By the end of this book, you’re going to be fed up with the amount of image references made.  If 
you’re having any difficulties with body issues, think about hitting up the gym and working your back 
and shoulder muscles.  Within two weeks you will immediately be noticing a change in your posture.
Body image applies both to real life dating and online.  I’m sure you’ve seen some pictures of guys 
who look like total dweebs in pictures, right?  Hell, I bet you’ve seen yourself looking rather bad in 
a LOT of pictures.  Consider taking this body image segment into account when posing for pictures.  
Always be aware of where the cameras are (yeah, I said it.  Pretend the paparazzi are after you, and 
be sure you’re always looking fly).
Eye Contact
You have undoubtedly encountered at least one person in your life who was not 
able to hold your gaze and instead was constantly looking elsewhere.  No, not your 
dog, dufus.  Hell, I used to have a friend who would stare at my lips rather than 
my eyes.  And it was a GUY.  I think you can assume just how annoying THAT 
was.  Think about the impression you got from that person who couldn’t hold eye 
contact.  Didn’t they seem distracted, uncaring, nervous, shifty…?  I don’t know, 
throw in any other words in there to describe it, but it wasn’t a positive experience, 
I bet.
This isn’t to say that you should STARE at the girl.  God, no.  That’s even worse 
than not looking at her at all!  But practice smiling with your eyes.  Practice holding 
her gaze for anywhere from 5 to 10 seconds before briefly looking away, and then 
bringing your eyes back to hers.  This will make the girl feel:
•	
Comfortable
•	
Secure
•	
As if she’s interesting (even if she’s not)
•	
Complimented by you without you having to say a word
If you have good eye contact with the camera that’s taking your picture, the girl 
will probably get the same good vibes.  Just be sure that you aren’t staring down 
the camera in some stupid drunken manner or glaring at it like Svengali trying to hypnotize a toad – if 
you are, never ever show her that picture.  NEVER.
If a girl gets good feelings and vibes when she’s around you, she will want to STAY around you.  Keep 
that in mind always.

is important, 
especially in the 
beginning of your

while holding

seconds

Chapter 5 - The Rules of Engagement
Posture
Again, it is extremely important that you take note of your posture.  If right now you’re sitting 
slouched over this book, take a deep breath, raising your head slowly, and imagine your spine being 
attached to a taut cord that is being pulled gently from above, guiding you to sit up straight.  Keep 
those shoulders parallel!  Keep that chin pointed slightly forward and upward!  RELAX!  Does this feel 
like an army drill yet? 
Having good posture makes you at least APPEAR self assured, and hell, with a posture like that, you 
will probably even begin convincing yourself that you are!  This is all good.
The Head Tilt
This seems to be a bit controversial, as I’ve heard from so-called experts that tilting one’s head is 
actually a sign for boredom.  I gotta tell you, from my experience, the head tilt exhibits awareness 
and attention to what the speaker is saying, especially if the head is tilted toward her and not toward 
the boobs of the Goddess at the next table.  When I’ve used this method with girls I’m listening to, it 
usually encourages them to keep right on talking (which is what you want – let them do most of the 
talking.  They want to hear themselves, anyway).
The head tilt means you’re friendly.  The head tilt means you’re listening.  Just don’t use the head tilt 
TOO much – girls may assume that you’re a bit too friendly and throw you in the friend zone.  You DO 
NOT want to succumb to GFS (otherwise known as “Gay Friend Syndrome”), which is so depressing 
that I’ve saved it for later in the book. 
When the cameras are flashing, though, do not tilt your head.  Keep it straight and confident; stare 
that thing down with your smiling eyes!
Arms And Legs
A lot of guys who I talk to always tell me about how they don’t know what the hell to do with their 
arms during a conversation with a girl – sorta like when you’re trying to get comfortable when going 
to bed but at least one arm is always in the way.  What you can do with your arms isn’t so tough when 
you think about it.
Keep your arms at your sides.  Guys often feel uncomfortable doing this, because they think it makes 
them look stiff.  Some guys like to tuck their arms behind their back, but I often find that this both 
makes me look too nice and immediately puts me in the friend zone, or it just comes off looking weak.  
If need be, alternate keeping your arms at your sides and propping one or two on your hips from time 
to time.  This often works well for pictures too.
Your legs are usually not a big issue for guys since you just, well, STAND there.  Just be sure that you 
don’t start bouncing your leg up and down, cross them, or have them spread too far apart or pushed 
too closely together (you don’t want to look like a goddamn bean pole).  Shoulder width apart, and 
relaxed enough that you could easily bend your knees if you wanted to.
And while I’m at it...don’t be fidgety.  Yeah you’ve got ADD.  Who the hell doesn’t these days?  You 
don’t need to be constantly vibrating your legs or tapping the table with your finger or playing the air-
drums.  This will not only drive her insane, it’ll make her nervous and she’ll want to get away from you 
as quick as she can.
‘nuff said.
Hand Gestures
Okay, so this one really applies mostly to in person rather than online.  I hate it when I see guys 
excitedly flailing their arms everywhere, thinking that they look expressive and fun when they really 
The Dating Commando

65
Chapter 5 - The Rules of Engagement
just look like a raving lunatic.
Keep hand gestures either at mid-body height or below.  Take into consideration that open hands with 
palms showing also show an openness and vulnerability, while close fists can look intimidating and 
make you appear aggressive. If you have to gesture big and often, enroll in an Italian opera.
Remember that these hands that you are using to gesture during conversation should be treated 
as a pleasure device for her.  Whether she’s aware of it or not, she’s checking out your hands and 
imagining them feeling up and caressing her body, running up her thighs, back, and whatever else 
gets her going.  The more appealing you make your hands seem, the more she’ll feel inclined to let 
them touch her, but only if the nails are clean and reasonably manicured.
Body Language
Have you ever noticed that you will angle your body towards the person or persons you are attracted 
to and interested in, and angle your body AWAY from those you wish would just go the hell away?  
When we are interested in someone, we tend to either lean in or tilt our pelvis towards them, without 
even being aware that we’re doing it.
As for positioning, take note of your distance in relation to people when you are engaged in a 
conversation.  If you’re too close, you will appear to be too pushy and be extremely aggressive.  This 
will just cause a shut down response in any woman you’re interested in.  
That being said, if you stand too far away, you appear shy or disinterested.  Try taking a step or two 
towards the girl in this situation.  If she doesn’t move, awesome – you’re at a perfect arm’s length 
away.  If she steps back, however, be sure not to more forward again until you work your game a little 
harder.  If five minutes later she’s still stepping away from you, it’s probably a good time to take her 
body cues as don’t touch me and get the fuck away and move along to the next target.  If she starts 
to touch you during conversation – a little pat on the fore arm, her shoulder bumps yours as she’s 
sitting beside you – this is an extremely good sign.  Don’t reciprocate by grabbing her boob, but a nice 
smile at such a moment can really deepen the chemistry.
Mouth
Oh, how your mouth speaks – in more ways than you probably think!  Yes, I know you asshole, your 
voice comes out of your mouth, but what I’m talking about is how you MOVE your mouth during a 
conversation.  Just like the hands, think about how the shapes you make with your mouth are being 
perceived by a woman.  She is also subconsciously thinking about how that mouth would feel ON HER, 
so make it appealing, friendly, and open.  Refrain from chewing food with it while talking to her.
If your mouth is tense, she will be able to pick up on that right away.  This is not a good sign.  A 
tense mouth either shows you’re nervous, or you’re pissed, or you’re annoyed.  These are all bad 
emotions that don’t make her feel good about you.  Keep your mouth soft and supple. Twist it to 
the side a bit to show you’re thinking, especially when she’s being deep about something.  Lick 
your lips from time to time, just to be subtly suggestive.  Try biting your lip once or twice during a 
conversation, too, to show her that you’d love for her to take a nibble at it too.
I hope I don’t have to say this, but some of you need it: smile when you’re in pictures!  Don’t FROWN 
at the camera and cross your arms – you do not look like a gangsta and you never will.  And even 
if you do somehow manage to look tough, remember that gangsta is one notch below chronic bed 
wetter on her mating wish list.  What a shitty pose…I hate it when I see it, and I know girls do too. If 
this is how you’re trying to portray your bad boy image, you fail.  EPIC fail!
If you’re going for a tougher look rather than an open, friendly smile (which is very appealing to 
women, so practice that grin) try smiling with your eyes but be sure to keep your mouth loose and 
free from being tight and tense.  It actually takes a lot of work to master this smoldering sort of look, 
so please, for your own sake, PRACTICE THIS BEFORE YOU USE IT.  Otherwise I guarantee that you

There are basically 
three types of 
Social Status.

is that which 
you’re born with.  
Achieved Status 
is that which 
you earn.  And 
Perceived Status is 
that which others 
think you have.
will look like an oblivious fool in any pictures taken of you.
Social Status
It’s sad but true: your social status matters.  There are basically three types of social status:
Ascribed Status:  You’re born with this.  So if you’re Prince William or Prince Harry, you’re set. Such 
status was originally founded on something called the divine right of kings which is pure utter bullshit, 
made up out of thin air, but that’s another story.
Achieved Status:  You actually earned this status, by going to school for a decade to become a 
surgeon or working hard at you music career to become Bon Jovi. 
Perceived Status:  This is the status that people think you have.  You’re granted this by the way 
you carry yourself, your attitude, your confidence, and your charm.
Rock stars get women because other women are competing for them, creating some false value for 
that particular man.
CEOs, Lawyers and Doctors get the women because they make the cash.
Politicians get the women because they have the power.
Polygamous religious cults get the women because God said so.
Kings and Princes?  Well, they obviously get the women because they’re friggin’ royalty.  Need I 
explain further?
It doesn’t matter what status you enjoy.  Just know that the higher your status 
is, the more desirable you are.  This is a fairly obvious fact, right?  Girls will date a 
lawyer before they date someone who’s slaving behind the Burger King grill.  I’m 
not trying to suggest that girls are all gold diggers; they’re not.  Some will settle 
for silver, copper, brass and even tin.  What I am trying to suggest here is that 
women want a man of decent social status, with no criminal record, and with some 
show of proof that he’ll be able to provide for both her and their future children, 
preferably in a nest that isn’t on wheels.
So you weren’t born a king, a prince and you have no desire to slice people open 
for a living or empty their pockets in divorce court.  When talking to a woman, 
be sure to go through your credentials: schooling, where you grew up, mention 
what your parents did or do for work, and talk up the job you have and where you 
live.  Though I will suggest that you make fun of yourself gently in other topics, 
your social status is not a laughing matter.  Girls take this seriously, whether they 
realize it or not, so you need to as well.  Look, all I’m saying is you just really need 
to try.
Let’s say you live near a swamp and work as a customer service guy for some 
little company, pulling in $8 an hour:
“I live about 20 minutes from here.  I love it because it’s close to the city, but it’s also so close to 
nature, y’know?  I respect nature; it keeps me grounded.  I’m not a religious guy at all, but there’s 
something almost…magical…spiritual about nature.”
Shyeah, right.  Nature.  It’s a damned swamp, but she doesn’t have to know.  If you’re taking her 
home, it’ll be too dark out for her to see it anyway.
And if she’s still there in the morning and starts commenting on how it’s just a swamp you can gently 
The Dating Commando

67
Chapter 5 - The Rules of Engagement
ridicule her lack of respect for nature:
“I find swamps fascinating.  All aspects of nature are; you just have to be able to find the beauty in 
something that, to others, may be distasteful.”
What a soul-searching, down to earth asshole you are.  Bravo!  Now get her out of there before the 
’gators come to ransack the garbage.
And about the job?
“I love being able to be supportive of people in my work.  I really am an integral part of the team 
there.  It’s a small company that not all too many people have heard of, but I’m excited to be a part of 
it.  There’s a lot of room for advancement; in fact, I’m up for a promotion next month!”
You didn’t actually say you are a customer support representative; you simply said that you were 
supportive of people in your work.  This can mean ANYTHING.  But when a girl first meets you, this 
kind of response will do.  Honestly, all she’s looking for is a man with a job and a goal.  Stating that 
you’re up for a promotion and looking for advancement satisfies both quotas.
Pimp Your Life
This is basically a continuation on the whole “social status” thing.  Know what gets women?  Money.  
Bling.  WEALTH.  Know what reflects these things?  House, car, and the expendable income you have.  
This indirectly proves to the woman that you’ll be able to actually take care of her, because that’s what 
women want: men to be men and to take care of the pack.
Having a decent place is probably the most important to a woman.  If you’re living in some shit shack 
that reeks of moth balls, or if you’re living with your parents, you will not have such an easy time with 
the ladies.  I’m not trying to suggest that you should or need to be living in some incredible palace; 
but you should have a place of your own (or at least be with a roommate who will screw off when you 
need him or her to).  This place of your own should be neat, and decently decorated.  If you’re sitting 
around on empty cartons and are using a cardboard box for a table, get some damned furniture.  Be 
sure that you have a comfy couch, and be sure that you definitely have a comfy bed.  We’ll go over 
how to prepare your home for her a bit later on, but those two are essential.  
Oh, and try to keep a nice bottle of wine around.  It’ll help take the edge off of things, if need be.
Cars are almost as important to chicks as the place where you live.  This is, perhaps, the most 
visible status symbol.  See that guy puttering around in that 1988 Tercel?  Do you see a woman in the 
passenger seat?  Probably not.  Girls expect guys to have a decent ride (unless you’re in high school).  
Girls also really like it if you have an above-average car, too.  
What girls do not love are old “clunkers” that break down on the highway, mini vans, and cheesy 
convertibles.  Come on guys, all because the top goes down on your ‘84 Lebaron does not mean that 
it’s a cool convertible.  Most girls would be embarrassed to be seen riding around in that shit with you.  
I had a brand spankin’ new Porsche 911 for a few years, and man, did I ever get laid!  Not only that, 
but I got out of police tickets and garnered what others may very well think is undeserved respect.

Chapter 5 - The Rules of Engagement
But chicks loved it.  They also love Jaguars, BMWs, Audi’s and any other European car that smells 
of fresh leather and one thousand dollar bills.  Don’t steal one just because you think it’s essential to 
dating success.  Only one thing is essential.  YOU. 
Now, I know, not everyone can lay down the cash for a Benz or an Escalade.  You can still get some 
pretty decent cars these days that look stylish and that chicks like.  Acura’s seem to be a favorite 
(they’re a good choice over Hondas, since the Civic is a bit boring and played out to women).  Some 
Mazda models are pretty awesome, and Mitsubishi has some pretty affordable yet very sporty looking 
cars.  If you need to spend a bit less, go for a decent American car, like a Pontiac Sunfire or Gran Prix, 
or something like a Ford Focus.  These are pretty boring cars, so chicks aren’t going to do a double 
take when you drive by.  But hey, it’s better than taking the bus.
On that note: If you do have to take transit everywhere, at least on the night that you meet the girl 
and bring her home, TAKE A CAB.  Do NOT take her on the loser cruiser (aka: bus) – that’s insanely 
lame and she will not be impressed.  In fact, even if she’s been rubbing up 
against you all night, should you suggest going to your place on the bus she’ll 
be out of there so fast your head will spin.
How much money you lay down also greatly shows what kind of money you 
have in your bank account.  Don’t be cheap.  Remember George Costanza from 
Seinfeld?  He was one cheap bastard.  Did he get women?  Not often!
If you’re out with the girl, be sure to treat her.  Buy her a drink.  If you’re at a 
restaurant, even if she’s sitting across the room and didn’t come with you, offer 
to buy her dessert.  If you’re out on a date, pay.  This is particularly important 
for the first date.  A quality girl will offer to pay and almost downright INSIST 
on it, but believe me – they expect you to foot the bill.
It’s also important to give the girl perhaps a little token when you first meet 
her too.  Flowers are great; a nice piece of jewelry is better.  But don’t go blowing your wad yet.  
K.I.S.S.  Anything more than a simple token will creep her the hell out and set you up as some sort 
of a psycho.  In fact, if she mentioned Ruby’s are her favorite, buy a ruby diamond candy ring from 
a dime store.  Offer it up with a bit of a joke and she’ll appreciate that you were paying attention, 
thought of her, and have a terrific sense of humor.
This does not pertain only to meeting a girl in person.  If you’ve met a girl online, you can begin 
almost immediately showing her that you are a man of means.  Mention all of the fun things you have 
been doing in the past 6 months and any trips you’ve taken.  Once you get her house address or find 
out where she works, send her some flowers.  Believe me, she’ll be mind blown.  She’ll also find it 
hard to say no to a date at this point.  And I don’t know how many times I have to tell you this...don’t 
be a fucking creep about it!  K.I.S.S. and funny!
Don’t mistake this as kissing her ass.  If you send her flowers, leave a note in the card about having 
a good talk with her the other day and leave it at that.  Nothing sappy.  Or include an inside joke that 
you two had in the conversation.
NOTE:  Only do this with a girl that you have made some sort of arrangements for meeting up.  
Otherwise you could just be wasting your money.
Energy
A problem with men is that we tend to be unable to maintain the energy that drives our conquest.  
Too many rejections, too many drinks – whatever it is, that spark is gone, and by the time the guy 
finds a potential lady friend for the evening, he’s so beaten down or worn out from the chase that 
even SHE’S not interested.
Energy truly is contagious.  It’s a natural high, and everyone wants a piece of it.  This plays a huge

Chapter 5 - The Rules of Engagement
role in why it is important to be optimistic and positive.  Optimism and happiness are addictive.  
People will sense your radiating joy from way across the room,  whether it’s a real room or an online 
chat room.  You will naturally be the life of the party.  A girl on her best, and even her worst day, will  
naturally be attracted to a guy with a zest for life, and a joie de vivre attitude.  We will get more into 
how to be positive later on, but it is important to look at life with the attitude that you only live once.  
Grab life by the balls and make it run to keep up with you.
Spontaneity is also something that girls absolutely love.  If you meet a girl somewhere, suggest that 
you do something crazy (not too crazy, like robbing a bank) but you can suggest that you both go for 
a late night swim at the lake or ocean; suggest you go and play 5-second hide and seek in a room 
you’re in; do a crazy, nasty tasting shot; or even race her to the nearest coffee shop or McDonalds 
(this worked for me once, I swear).  Get creative and get a little wild.  It’s amazing how much people 
just wanna play sometimes.  Make it happen.
High energy also moves things very naturally towards passion.  Chicks love passionate men, and a 
guy with a love for life definitely has passion.  Of course, passion  also makes them think of how you’d 
be in bed – and if you have passion, it’s only the good things that they’re seeing.  Energy is a natural 
turn on.  If you make a girl happy, the endorphins in her brain are also released, so scientifically 
speaking, she is truly physically joyous.  Pretty awesome, right?
We will talk more about your CHI in Chapter 12.  So stick around!
Honesty
Chicks dig honesty. I hold strong to the belief that lying by omission is still being dishonest, though; if 
she didn’t ask directly about something, you don’t need to offer up the information.  Of course, if she’s 
driving and you know the bridge is washed out up ahead, it might be a good idea to speak up.
Being honest about feelings and emotions is usually what girls understand as being honest.  How 
many people you’ve slept with doesn’t matter as much – at least on the first night – as how you feel 
about the girl you’re with.  Then again, if you feel ridiculous being with her because she’s such a 
butter face and below your standards, then omit honesty and concentrate on an exit strategy.
And since we’re being all honest and touchy-feely, I should tell you (in case you don’t know) what 
butter face means.  Everything about the girl is hot...but her face.  Get it?
The most important part to honesty is not so much about trotting out all the garlic breathed skeletons 
in your closet.  It’s more about being genuine and keeping it real.  Always, ALWAYS remember that 
girls can smell BS before you even speak it.  They are masterminds: they will read your body language 
before you even realize you’re moving.  They will tell you what story you’re concocting before you 
even know the punch line.  Don’t think that because you may be typing to her over a computer that 
she can’t tell you’re lying either – SHE CAN.  If you’re genuine, they’ll know it.
How To Compliment Her Without Ingratiating Yourself
“You’re so pretty!”
“You’re a totally awesome person.”
“Oh my god, you’re so perfect…”
“I think you’re just swell!”
Okay, maybe no one actually uses the last line there, except for my grandma.  But all of the above 
are examples of compliments that women do not want to hear!  Get it through your thick skulls: 
women know that they’re better looking than you.  It’s true.  But women are self deprecating enough 
to know that they are NOT perfect, so don’t call them that – they’ll know you’re full of BS.

Chapter 5 - The Rules of Engagement
Number one mistake made by guys:  You compliment her far too often.
“Where’d you get that dress?  It looks great on you.  Oh, and 
you’re so funny and sweet!  You’re AWESOME!”  
Yeah, okay, everyone likes to be appreciated, but back off, man.  Complimenting her too much makes 
you look like a pathetic wimp.  Believe me; you do NOT want to be that guy.  Keep in mind that you’re 
going for a bad boy persona here.  The only ass kissing you want to do is literal ass kissing.
So when do you compliment her?  Compliment her on something that she’s proud of doing – even if 
it’s her chugging a whole pitcher of sangria at a bar.  Throw in a compliment about being impressed 
by her swallowing technique (this also sexualizes the conversation, which we’ll go over later).  
Compliment her if she’s ever feeling down about something, too.  A happy woman is a woman who will 
go home with you.
Be sure that the compliments you’re giving aren’t totally fake or phony, too.  Remember, girls 
know when you’re lying to them.  Only pay a compliment if you are being sincere.  If you have 
no compliments for her but fake ones, why are you even bothering with her in the first place?  Do 
remember, that if you compliment her all the time, you trivialize the compliments.  They become 
devalued and she won’t treasure them even when the compliments are well deserved.
The key to a successful compliment is, first and foremost, to come up with something original.  Say 
something that she has never heard before, but is relevant and personal.  You also want to disguise 
your compliments.  An indirect compliment can mean a lot more than an obvious one.  Some 
examples of this are:
“Most girls I know couldn’t pull that dress off.”
(It’s easy to sexualize a comment like this, such as “But I could 
pull that off of you”).
“Wow, I’ve heard that job takes a lot of patience and 
creativity!”
“I usually don’t like brunettes, but you’ll do.”
“Really?  You’re reading that book?  Jeez, most of my friends 
don’t have an IQ high enough to understand it.”
“You play guitar?  Cool.  Yeah, I bet you’re good at it.  You 
have nice, long slim fingers that have probably completely 
mastered that fret board.”
For the most part, you want to compliment not so much her appearance, as you compliment her 
intelligence, her interests, and what she is actually doing.  
Here are some great compliments that work and won’t make you seem like a complete jackass:
“[Insert celebrity or well-known hot chick] has NOTHING on you.”  
This shows that you acknowledge the beauty of other women, and it gives her a sense of 
competition.  But you’re letting her know that, at least for now, she’s winning that game.
“I wish I would have met you sooner… but I’m glad to get to know 
you now.”  
This compliment is best used when you have perhaps already discussed all of the other women that 
you’ve had in your life.  You’re acknowledging that you’ve had interest in other women than her, but 
hey… she’s the best at this point in your life.

Chapter 5 - The Rules of Engagement
“Nice car.” 
Simple enough.  Reserve this one for the first time a girl picks you up on a date, or the first time you 
see her car.  A car is often a very personal item to a person – chicks included – so complimenting the 
car is, in fact, complimenting them and their good taste.
“My mom is going to LOVE you!”  
Hey, you didn’t say you loved her – nope, you didn’t, even though that might be what she thought 
she heard.  This one’s great, because it gives the sense of you two getting closer (with the expectation 
of meeting a parent) and it also has the girl feeling loved without YOU having to actually LOVE her!  
You can also substitute your mom for your friends.
“My mother warned me about girls like you.  Good thing I’ve never 
listened to her.”
This response is coy and teasing.  You’ll have the girl smiling, while also pretending to be offended, 
and then ask you exactly what a girl like her IS.
Okay, so just for fun, I’m throwing in some bad compliments, just so you definitely know what NOT 
to do:
“You look just like I remember. Except you seem shorter.”  
This is just awful, but it’s a classic error.  Okay, so your heart may have been in the right place, and 
maybe you like short chicks, but girls do NOT take being short as being a compliment.  For whatever 
reason, they all want to appear tall because tall is beauty.  Whether or not that’s true in your eyes, 
who cares.  Just don’t say it.
“You’re not what I expected… for an accountant.
Place any race or any occupation in there.  It’s equally confusing and horrible.  Is it an insult?  Or 
are you complimenting her?  Chances are, she’ll take it as an insult and think you’re a complete idiot.  
Plus it can make you look like a bit of a snob or a racist (huge turn off, in case you didn’t know).
“You’re better at [insert something relevant] than my ex.”
NO GIRL WANTS TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR EX GIRLFRIEND, especially at the beginning.  Just 
avoid bringing up the ex all together.  That’ll definitely kill your chances.
“You’d look better with your clothes off.”  
If I have to tell you what’s wrong with this statement, you’re a lost cause.
Compliments are just as easy to work online as they are offline.  Here’s an example that was sent to 
me that seems pretty good:
Jezziebelxoxo: I couldn’t believe that da bitch went out and got 
the same dress as me.  She iz gonna ware it to [name of the club] 
2!
(guy): Who cares?  It’ll look better on you anyway.  You know how 
people always ask if “this makes them look fat?”  Well, she looks 
fat in everything.
I’m sure you do not give a crap about her and her friend buying the same shirt.  But hey, if she’s 
telling you something that leaves you open to sneaking in some compliment, go for it.

Chapter 5 - The Rules of Engagement
Some other examples of compliments that you can give without being a complete idiot are:
“I love your energy”
“Man, you’re way more interesting than most girls I talk to here”
“You definitely are a girl who knows what she wants.  I admire 
that.”
“GodDAMN you’re a confident woman.  That’s hard to find nowadays.”
“You’re so… expressive. You know what you want to say, and you 
say it.  I’m glad you don’t shy away from the truth like most 
people do.”
“You are pretty DIFFERENT, I guess, from the other girls in here.  
You actually have an opinion. Yes!  Finally!  Tell me more about 
[insert subject here]”
Compliments like these make a woman feel good about herself as a person, not merely as an object 
of your lust or your horny manipulations. 
Kicking The Shyness
Believe it or not, I am by nature a really shy guy.  I was the type who would get red in the face if a 
woman even looked at me.  Believe me, I would never even consider APPROACHING a woman either.  
I’m not going to get into the psychology behind it, such as asking you to search your soul and “figure 
out what makes you shy”.  What helped me the most for kicking the shyness was faking it (women 
are used to this tactic themselves; they’d understand if they found out).  By faking it I mean exuding 
self confidence while actually being nervous as all hell on the inside.  This may sound lame, but think 
of a guy whom you admire; of a guy who appears to be the definition of self confidence.  Here, you’re 
acting as if you’re confident as a way of training yourself to actually be confident.  Keep at it.  This 
kind of faking is very different from giving her fake compliments, as discussed above.  In the first, 
you’re simply working on yourself, in the latter you’re deceiving her.  Big difference.
Got it?
Now adjust your shoulders to look like the super confident guy you’re imagining.   
Do it, right now while you’re sitting there (no one’s watching).  Raise your chin 
about, just like how this guy would.  Smile.  Practice this stuff in the mirror.  This is 
the posture and the pose that you’ll be striking when you hit the streets and go on 
your date.  Be sure to also wear clothing that makes you look and feel confident, 
as we discussed earlier.  And remember, wearing a t-shirt with the logo “I’m no 
gynecologist, but I’ll take a look”  is NOT a statement of confidence.
Here is the most important part of all: look and act approachable.  There’s more involved in this 
than you may think.  Laugh often, even if it’s laughing at stuff you don’t find all that funny.  Body 
language is a universally understood language that anyone can read the second they meet you.  Body 
language tells a person if you’re happy, if you’re sad, if you’re scared, and especially if you’re shy.  We 
will dig into this topic again later when you’re on your date, but for now I’m going to teach you what 
body language you must have in order to even GET the woman interested in you.
Good posture and standing tall exudes confidence and manliness – two traits that women drool over.  
That’s right, you better not be hunching those shoulders or be forming some sort of concave shape 
with your back.  Stand tall.  Keep your head high too.  Just be sure not to keep it TOO high.  No one 
wants to check out your nostrils.  Imagine you’re a penis. Which would excite a girl more?  Limp or 
erect?

I also like to stand with my hands on my hips.  Not only is it complimenting to my size (it makes me 
look taller and stronger) but my hands are also pointing to my greatest area of interest, if you get 
what I’m saying.  
Smiling is something that I also consider as being part of body language, since your smile is 
obviously a physical exression.  Not only does smiling show that you’re a positive and happy person, 
but it also is a great lead in for women to start a conversation with you.  Hell, who doesn’t want to 
talk to a happy person?  Even those emo or goth kids who claim they hate happiness are drawn in by 
a smile.
So let’s talk about being positive.  You may think that this sounds lame, but I must stress that being 
positive makes you a force that women are DRAWN to.  Women, in particular, are prone to having 
bad days and moody days (no PMS jokes, please) and they need that positive force (YOU) in their 
life to make them feel better.  Don’t you want to be the guy who makes her feel better, at least for 
just one night?  Sure you do!  Be optimistic about life, just as you should be optimistic about being 
rejected 100 times in one night.  Well okay, 10 times.  After all, this is a number’s game; rejected 10 
times means that you’re just that much closer to getting a woman in your lap – and I don’t mean a 
paid stripper.  Just be careful.  My buddy Leo got a lap dance from a drunk 260 pound booty babe and 
ended up with a pulled groin.  Pulled groin?  Get it?  I’m giving you gold here and I’m getting nothing 
back!
Shyness is not who you ARE, it’s simply an emotion.  You can easily overcome shyness by being 
bolder, confident and more outgoing.  You’re a Dating Commando!  Now act like one!
So let’s get down to practicing.  I’m not going to start out asking you to “dig deep within your soul” 
and assess your best qualities and then brag about them to the girl you’re asking out.  I’m not going 
to ask you to visualize asking her out either, though you can do that if you think it’ll help (though I’m 
guessing you’re visualizing something else when you’re thinking about girls).  
What I am going to do is give you practical advice.  Mentally prepare yourself for a no but be ready 
for the yes.  This has much to do with not pinning all of your hopes and dreams on one single target. 
If you are obsessed with one woman, for god’s sake don’t act obsessed around her unless she happens 
to be staring at your crotch and licking her lips noisily.  Honestly, even the best daters out there 
have a 20% success rate.  But don’t look at no as a sign for you to give up trying.  A no is simply an 
excuse.  If you persist a bit in an easy, fun and spontaneous way, and eliminate the excuses, all that’s 
left is yes.  If she still says no, then move on, dude.  
The Practice Girl
So what if this sounds mean?  It’s imperative that every guy seek out a practice girl to test and 
practice your mad Dating Commando skills.  The practice girl will also allow you to hone your game 
to perfection.
What exactly is a practice girl?  Let’s first state the obvious: there are different leagues out there to 
which we all belong: two bagger ugly (the second bag is in case the first one falls off), butt-fuckin-
ugly, plain ol’ ugly, moderately ugly, plain Jane, 6 out of 10, pretty, hot, super hot, and untouchable.  
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online
“Not only does smiling show that 
you’re a positive person, it’s also a 
great conversation starter!”

74
Chapter 5 - The Rules of Engagement
These same categories also apply to us guys of course.  Duh.  Figure out where you are on the 
spectrum – AND BE HONEST.  If you’re moderately ugly, be real about it.  The purpose of categorizing 
will come in handy when choosing your practice girl, and even the practice girl will have your league 
picked out for you.  If she orders three doggy bags from the waiter, you’re in trouble.
(If you need help with this, put your picture up on www.hotornot.com and see how many points you 
get.  To find an appropriate practice girl, look for a girl on the site who is a full 1 to 2 points below 
you.  If you’ve only been ranked a 1 or even less, I guess you’re shit outta luck when using this trick.)
Now, whatever league you’re in, start looking for a girl who is a league BELOW you.  This is your 
practice girl.  Sounds kinda crass, I know, but you’re not doing this to be mean to the practice 
girl. You’re doing this to learn how to communicate with a member of the opposite sex who won’t 
intimidate you and is more receptive to your advances...and who knows, you might even fall in love 
with her and find practice makes perfect with one woman.
NOTE: Because they have breasts, women, regardless of the league in which they belong, tend to 
think they are at least a league or two above almost any man.  Be aware of this fact and be sure 
never to mention that you THINK you’re a league above her.  Act it.  She’ll be convinced.
One important thing to keep in mind:  You cannot practice on girls above your league, because they 
won’t even blink at you.  Remember...you’re here to practice your game and find out what works for 
you and what does not - and then advance to the bigger leagues.  The girls below you will give you a 
chance.
Online Girls
So let’s say you’re browsing online and, among the hotties you WANT to contact, you see a rather 
homely, but decent looking girl.  You check yourself in the mirror, muss your hair a bit, and you’re 
pretty convinced that you’re hotter than she is (if at all unsure, check with your sister or any lady 
friends you may have.  They will be brutally honest with you).  You can see yourself banging her 
without gagging.  GREAT!  This is the one for you!  Time to send her a message.
Here’s an important thing to remember: you must take this practice girl session just as seriously 
as you would for dating a hot girl you’re creaming your pants for.  Be sure not to come off as overly 
confident and cocky, just because you think you’re prettier than her.
Foreign Girls
Another great way to practice is to practice with foreign girls.  Should you be fortunate enough to 
travel a bit, take advantage of the social hot spots in whatever city you are in: coffee shops, pubs, 
grocery stores, WHATEVER.  This is the time for you to play the dumb tourist with an accent (which 
you will have if you travel outside of your state or country...and remember: chicks DIG an accent).  
One of the best ways to initiate a conversation in a foreign country with a woman is simply asking 
where something is.  Women LOVE giving directions, they LOVE being helpful, and they will talk your 
ear off when all they really had to say was, “It’s around the corner – to the right”.  Take advantage of 
this!  
A really cool thing about practicing with the foreign babes is that they don’t know who the hell you 
are, who your friends or family are, and will probably forget you the moment you turn the corner!  
This means you have no reason to stress or lose confidence.  You can be as bold and as cocky as 
you like without any consequences.  I once spent 2 hours in a French nightclub trying to pick up two 
hotties (yeah at the same time).  My French, even though I once spoke it fluently, SUCKED and they 
laughed their asses off at me everytime I spoke.  Nonetheless, I bagged me some Frenchies!
Once you have them in a conversation about the best way to get to Carnegie Hall (the answer: 
Practice!  Ba da bum!  Lame joke...let’s see you do better!), ask about other hot spots.  Where does

Chapter 5 - The Rules of Engagement
she like to go?  What kind of atmosphere is it?  What’s the best time of day or day of the week to go 
to this wonderful place?  Strike up a conversation about her too, like how long she’s been living in this 
city and mention any relevant current events.  If you’re game is really tight, you can ask her:
“If you were touring a long lost friend around town, what are 
some of the places you’d take him? [wait for answer]  Here’s an 
idea, why don’t you take me?”
If she’s mentioned a favorite restaurant, offer to buy her lunch in exchange for being your private 
tour guide.
Another great thing about foreign women is this: if you say something offensive, and they act 
offended, you can easily blame it on their misunderstanding of the English language or claim that 
whatever the hell you said means something different in your country of origin.  There’s a good chance 
that SHE will be the one apologizing to you, when in fact you were just doing a shitty job at being a 
Dating Commando.
You can use this on foreign women who are online as well.  Going to be visiting Germany any time  
soon?  Try connecting with a girl from Germany a couple of months beforehand.  Strike up a seemingly 
innocent conversation with her online.  Ask her questions about her area, what she likes and doesn’t 
like.  Ask her to recommend places like museums and galleries to visit.  If you play the game right, 
you’ll have a sweet German escort to show you the hot spots when you fly in to Frankfurt.
Older Women
Older women are FANTASTIC practice girls.  One, they definitely are not looking for anything 
long term.  What they really want is a cabana boy, a young piece of meat to keep around to do their 
bidding.  They want no commitment from you, no marriage, no babies, and no girlfriend/boyfriend 
label.  Word to your brain: YOU’RE being treated like a sex object.  Funny isn’t it, the very thing that 
pisses off women is perfectly okay with us.
Secondly, older women will also show you the ropes.  Younger women tend to be shy about taking 
the lead and telling YOU what they want.  Older women are rather brazen and will let you know 
immediately what they want and how they want it.  Take one of these fine ladies for a spin if you feel 
like learning a thing or ten about women.

Chapter Conclusion
If you’re not having fun with the game, what’s the point?  Until you can let loose a little and 
enjoy the challenge of conquering women, online dating may not be for you.
Your attitude, dress, and body language are the three most important things involved when 
trying to attract a woman.  Put it all together  as stated in  this chapter and you’re guaranteed 
success.
Compliments are great – unless they make you look like a pathetic dweeb.  There is such a 
thing as “over complimenting” a woman, and  most men do it to a complete and utter fault.

Hey, loving your profile.  You like Monopoly?  So do I!  I’d love to 
beat you at it.  I’ll even let you be the car and I’ll be the shoe.  
Let me know what day works for you.
Cute, light hearted, and hey, you CLEARLY read her profile, right?  I gotta admit, even I don’t hate 
this opener.  With the right kind of girl, you’d get a positive response.  You’re BANKING on a positive 
response.  But instead you get this:
No tx
What the… NO “TX”?!  But you were so cute!  You spent so much time looking at her profile (especially 
her pictures – admit it), figuring out what you two had in common, memorizing her likes and dislikes… 
What a waste of time!  And...how could she possibly do this to you?
That’s it, your fingers are itching.  Your face is getting hot and you may be a bit damp underneath the 
armpits.  You can’t help it. You have just got to put this bitch in her place:
Know what?  I’m sorry I wasted my time on a bitch like you.  You’re 
obviously not looking for someone who’s funny, attractive, and oh 
yeah, did I mention that I’m rich?  Good luck with your shitty 
dating attempts, ho, ‘cuz you’re gonna need it!
I absolutely CRINGE when I hear of guys that do this!  This is where I suck the air in between my teeth 
and ask, “Why, dude?  Why?”  An hour later, the guy who has written something like this has probably 
put Radiohead on their iTunes or mp3 player and then cried on the inside because he felt like a piece of 
his heart was just trampled on.
Here’s another rejection example: let’s say you’re out on the town and at a club.  You see a hot girl 
across the room making all of the right moves with her body, and you’re just absolutely yearning to get 
a piece of that.  So you put your game face on, you work your swagger, you approach her, and say:
“Would you like to dance?”
She then gives you that raised eyebrow and semi-sneer and you can see her mouth the word “No”, or 
something similar.  You laugh, draw her closer to you by the arm and say: 
“Sweetheart, I wasn’t asking you to dance.  I said you LOOK FAT IN THOSE PANTS.”
 At this point you may either get a drink in the face, a slap or make her cry.  This is not how Dating 
Commandos behave.  I’m going to teach you the skills so you know how to overcome rejection.  I’m 
going to teach you how to avoid becoming needy and pathetic, while also not turning you into a jaded 
and bitter bastard.  There is hope for you yet, my friend.  Let us enter the rejection zone TOGETHER.
NOTE: overcoming rejection does not involve getting drunk, getting a hooker, or combining the two.)

Chapter 6 - Dealing With Rejection
on the female masses.  I’m doing this to make a point: rejection will happen.  It WILL.  No matter how 
tight your game, no matter how fly you think you look, girls will reject you for a number of reasons, 
many of which do not even involve you personally.  A girl may reject you because you used a three 
syllable word and she’s intimidated.
Rejection makes us (men AND women) behave like fools.  Lots of guys don’t realize that ONE TIME 
rejection by a girl doesn’t mean that you don’t have a chance in hell with her.  This rejection leaves an 
opening for you to slither back in and try to work your mojo magic again.  We will talk about that later in 
this chapter.  For now, you must learn the skills to be able to overcome rejection and keep your head in 
the game for success.  Let’s take a look by starting with a little prevention:
Don’t Become Emotionally Connected
You’ve found her: the one girl in the city who loves Samurai X as much as you do (don’t know what 
that is?  It’s a shitty anime show.  Moving on…).  She also comes from a family with two brothers who 
are just around the same age as YOUR brothers.  She loves the same foods as you, she loves a lot of 
the same music, and she has a really, really kind smile – the kind of smile you’d love to be looking up at 
you from your pillow.
You may have checked out a couple of profiles before hers, but you know this is the one.  She’s your 
soul mate.  You can just sense it.  So, like the guy a moment ago, you send off what you consider to be 
a heartfelt and genuine message that adequately expresses how you feel about what you and she share 
in common:
You are truly a rare gem.  I stopped immediately when I saw a 
fellow Samurai X fan.  I’m also a huge Placebo fan (I went to their 
concert in November – maybe we saw each other there and didn’t know 
it?  LOL how weird eh?).  To make things even stranger, did you 
know that we both have brothers who are the same age?  Wonder if 
they were in the same grade in school, too.
Oops, guess I got so excited I forgot to tell you my name.  I’m 
Andrew, aka “The Drew” (don’t feel obligated to call me that, tho 
=P).  I’m really looking forward to hearing from you so I finally 
have someone to talk anime with!
	
*SEND*!  
You close the dating site window right then and there, because you know this is the one.  There’s no 
need to look further.  You can already see her in that white dress walking down the aisle.  Maybe you’re 
even envisioning it anime-style!
Too bad, because a couple of days later you get this back in return from her:
same concert?  anime?  All cuz i said i liked it does not mean i 
want to talk about it.  enjoy your samurai x.
And with that, your heart shatters like glass and you fall to pieces – pathetic shit-particle pieces that 
need to man up and GET OVER IT.  Instead, you head out to the garage and take a hammer to your 
Samurai X DVD.
Yes, I know how hard this is.  You’ve been rejected time and time again, and it would be so easy to 
either:  
a)	 Send an angry response back to her, letting her know how much of a whore she is, or;
b)	 Become jaded and angry and refuse to date any girls anymore EVER.  You will vow to find easy 
sluts to use as sex partners and nothing but.

Chapter 6 - Dealing With Rejection
Both of these are horrible responses.  Neither is productive nor helpful; they simply ruin your game 
rather than enhance it in any way.
When it comes to rejection, the “it’s not you, it’s me” explanation applies.  Though she is not literally 
saying it, this is what’s going on here.  What I mean by this is that she just isn’t feeling it on that day.  
Here are some things that affect a girl in saying no to any guy – and I do mean ANY guy – no matter 
how rich, beautiful, or wonderful he may seem:
•	
Bad day at work
•	
Bad day at home
•	
PMS
•	
Recent break up
•	
Received a rejection message from a guy themselves that day
•	
Tired
•	
Financially stressed
•	
Just a bitch who gets kicks from rejecting men
See how none of these are your fault?  But these things do happen to all of us and girls in general let 
such things temporarily bring them down far harder than men.  So though that girl is a Samurai X fan, 
maybe something more important, like a parent or sibling falling ill or dying, has happened recently.  
Maybe she’s currently re-evaluating what is meaningful in her life and Samurai X isn’t making the cut.  
This all the more reinforces the concept of CHI coming up soon.  You need to be positive, have a little 
charm, be humorous, be intelligent.  Project these values and she’ll feel awful about saying no and 
may even give you another chance.
Don’t Place Value On The Target
This is related to the whole “do not become emotionally involved” mantra but is more about not 
letting your dick make your decisions for you.
When browsing profiles, you’ve undoubtedly come across some girls that make you schwing! and 
others who really just do nothin’ for you.  Maybe some even make you wanna gag, hurl, or cry.  It’s 
important for you not to invest a ton of time fantasizing or stressing over any one girl in particular.  So 
that girl who looks like your dream girl, with that whole Jessica Rabbit look, who you’re just dying to 
tap – spend 5 seconds dreaming of fucking her and MOVE ON.  
Don’t out all your focus on the physical component of that one girl, because really all of them should 
be treated fairly.  All of these girls you contact should be receiving 100% positive effort from you – no 
getting lazy with the ones whom you think are beneath you, including the practice girls we mentioned 
in Chapter 5.  You are contacting these girls because you want a chance with them all, and they are 
deserving of a well thought out and considerate message, regardless to whether they’re a 3 or a 10. 
Remember, this is 3-10 in your estimation only.  One man’s 3 may be another man’s 9.  Beauty is in 
the eye of the beholder.  Taste is in his little lecherous tongue.
  Overemphasizing your target’s physical attributes can also distort the attitude of the message 
you send.  Plus, it’s a lot easier to overcome the rejection if you haven’t gone totally gaga about 
her physical appearance, told all your friends and family about her, and have already picked out the 
wedding ring.  Be easy, be cool, and do not continue to dream and fantasize about every Tempty 
Temptresses breasts pressed against you.  There is a very good chance that you’ll never be feeling 
them.  In the words of the old rock classic “If you can’t feel the tit you love, love the tit you feel.”
Lastly, do you realize that overvaluing your target’s physical appearance can also make YOU come 
off looking desperate?  You’ll come off as though you’re trying to elevate your status and the girl will 
smell your desperation and instantly play the rejection card.  You’re too much of a great guy to get 
stuck on some physical aspect of the girl.  Besides, those double D’s right there hang off of lots of 
girls’ chests.  A film director once told me “Hot girls are a dime a dozen!  You can’t throw a stick in 
this town without one of them fetching it.”  You’ll get ‘em eventually, tiger.

Chapter 6 - Dealing With Rejection
Don’t Place Importance On The Conquest
This is a game, remember?  When you lost playing Risk or Candy Land as a kid, did you spiral down 
into some dark, depressed state of mind?  Probably not.  When you played Quake Online and got 
shot dead 2.4 billion times, did you brood for months?  No.  Forget what all the Player manuals try 
to teach you.  The goal here is to have fun with the conquest.  Besides, a conquest isn’t a conquest 
unless it’s at least moderately difficult, right?
And get this. Really get this!  Being rejected helps you improve your game.  Having some girl telling 
you to take a hike only makes your next approach that much better.  Rejection is just as valuable as 
the conquest, in spite of what Mr. Happy thinks.
I know, it hurts our pride when we don’t get the girl, but remind yourself of the points I made above:  
it’s not you, IT’S HER.  And if it is you, well, then you two just aren’t meant to be.  I hate to state 
the obvious here, but rejected men seem to forget that not every woman and man are made to be 
together.  With that, I bring us to the next point:
Soul Mate, Shmoul Mate!
There is no such thing as a soul mate alright?  This is just some sappy term that some jackass 
screenwriter came up with YEARS ago to get women to sleep with him – and it worked.
This is all about forcing yourself not to invest entirely in that one girl that you swear will complete 
you in every way imaginable.  “I can’t be happy without you” is the statement of a sorry, deluded 
person.  “I can live without you, but I choose to give my love to you” is healthy and empowering. 
Dude.  There are thousands of girls who have the same shit to offer you, or if not that, slight 
variations that would also work out well for you.  Consider all of the women in the world.  You really 
think that one woman was mysteriously made just for you and that it is your noble duty to seek her 
out and then make babies?  Get real.  And one last pontificating word on this.  Instead of looking for 
Ms. Right, try being Mr. Right.
Get Revenge on Rejection
Here’s the best way to get revenge on rejection:  Forget about it.  Seriously, the longer you live 
feeling dejected and rejected, the more harm you’re unnecessarily causing to your self-esteem, your 
endorphins AND your game!
So what do I mean by getting revenge on rejection?  By kicking it square in the ass.  How do you kick 
rejection square in the ass?  By:
•	
Tell it (rejection, not the girl!) to fuck right off
•	
WORKING SMARTER, not working harder.
•	
Reminding yourself that you’re the one in control.  Only you get to decide how 
you feel, not some stranger with her own baggage.  Own your shit!
•	
Reminding yourself of how awesome you are.  Hey, it’s deserved every once in 
a while.  Confidence is not arrogance. 
•	
Looking at the good shit that happened today.  Did some girl give you the once 
over on the subway and seem interested?  SHE didn’t reject you.  Did your 
manager leave you alone at the office?  Hey, a day at work can’t get any better 
than that.  That’s a “win” right there.
•	
Keeping clean and presentable.  Do your hair, brush your teeth, put on a clean 
shirt.  There, feel sexier?  Good.  You should.
•	
Responding to those rejection messages with humor, charm, and intelligence.  
Maybe you’ll get a second chance at her - maybe you won’t.  We will talk about 
HOW to do this in Chapter 10 – Responding to messages.

Chapter 6 - Dealing With Rejection
For some women, a no may very well mean come back later or, “I didn’t have time to read it and 
perhaps I should have.”  
In summation, just be sure not to respond to a rejection by writing her back with something like this.
U no what?  It is ok that u don’t want to date me.  Yeah, know 
why: u remind me of my sister (and not in a good way!!!!!)  am 
not even attracted to u in that way I just figured we’d have a 
good time together.  But no, someone (u) had to b a bitch (u) and 
totally just mis-interprett my intentions (U!!!!).  no what? Fuck 
u slut.  ur probably on here looking for some UFC champ or some 
other guy with huge biceps and a small d!ck to fuck.  Get real, 
u aren’t even that good looking.  Best u do is some jerk off who 
looks like an uglier version of Carrot Top, and I haven’t even 
MET ANYONE UGLIER THAN CARROT TOP!!!!!!
Get fucked.  =D

Chapter 7 - Going Tête-à-Tête: The Conversation Do’s and Don’ts
Y
ou bought this book because you think talking to women sucks.  It doesn’t need to, but you 
feel that when you don’t know them, don’t know their interests, and have to approach them 
like a bad telemarketer, it sucks.  What’s even worse is being left completely tongue tied when you 
actually approach a girl you’re interested in.  You stand there like a deer in the head lights.  She says 
something catty: “Take a picture, it’ll last longer!”  You say, “Uhhh…”  Her friends laugh.  She rolls her 
eyes.  They move away from you.  GAME OVER.
You send her a message on the internet:
You sound like a really fun, caring person.  We have a lot in 
common, too.  Wanna chat?
There it is – a reply in your inbox!  Your palms break into a sweat.  You lick your lips in anticipation.  
You open the message only to find:
That’s ok.  Enjoy ur day.
What in the Fuck?!… why?  What the hell are you doing wrong?
Everything, you pansy.  Everything.  But we’ll get you on your path to success.
You also have to remember that talking to a woman online is a bit different than talking to her in 
person.  We’ll show you how to perfect both the art of meeting and greeting ladies online, and how to 
continue in person.  If you’re ready, let’s remove the suck and show you how much fun approaching 
complete strangers can be!
Stop Over Thinking
That’s right, stop over thinking.  Or for some of you, just stop thinking ALTOGETHER.  The problem 
that 99% of guys have when talking to women is that they over think the situation and just end up 
getting all frazzled and nervous for no good reason.  You know it’s true.  How many times have you sat 
there, drinking beer after beer, trying to come up with some topic of conversation?  
Pathetic, dude.  Pathetic.
If you are thinking too much about what to say, chances are that what you’re saying is typical.  Typical 
means boring.  Boring means her turning around on her heel and returning to her friends, who are 
undoubtedly laughing at your ass.  Hurts, don’t it?  Well, don’t take it personally.  You’ll never see them 
again.  Or at least if you do, you may very well get one or 5 of them in the sack.
Do A Background Check
So you’ve picked out one or a few girls that you really want to date.  Hopefully, you’ve actually book 
marked their profile pages so you can easily get back to ‘em and review their profile.
	
NOTE: Background checks apply to whenever you obtain any information on her, as we will discuss 
below.  You may have to put a background check off until after you actually speak to your target and 
obtain the necessary information.
Yes, I said it again: review her profile.  But you, as a Dating Commando, must rise ABOVE her profile.  
You must perform your very own background check on the girl for a couple of reasons:

The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online

Chapter 7 - Going Tête-à-Tête: The Conversation Do’s and Don’ts
1)	 To prove that she isn’t a psycho
2)	 To collect some ADDITIONAL interests or tidbits of information that she hasn’t shared on 
her profile.  You can then mention these things in your headline, opening line or first few 
conversations to make it seem as if you two have a lot in “common”.  She’ll have no idea you 
looked that shit up and are talking out of your ass!
First what we’re going to do is take her online name and plunk it into a search engine.  You’ll be 
surprised by what may come up.  I’ve had Craigslist ads come up, mostly showing some shit that the 
girl was selling, and I’ve also had porn websites come up (and yes, it was the same girl that I met from 
an online dating site).  But you will probably also get some high school or college news or hell, maybe 
nothing at all.  
There is a good chance that she has a Facebook page, Twitter or Myspace.  If she comes up on either 
site, jump on that shit!  Facebook now has some pretty hardcore privacy rules in place, so if she’s smart 
enough to have set up her privacy controls properly, you shouldn’t be able to see a thing about her.  
But hey, if she hasn’t bothered to make her online life private, then definitely take some time browsing 
her pictures (this way you know what she REALLY looks like), her likes and dislikes, read her wall, and 
even check out a couple of her friends if you can.  You’ll be shocked by how much info you can get off 
of Facebook and all of these other social networking sites.  It can be pretty fun checking out her hot 
friends, too.
Another thing that I like to do is to take her online name and look her up on any dating site forums or 
message boards for the site I found her on.  See what sorts of questions she’s responding to (are they 
man bashing?  Sex related?  Friendship related?) and how she’s responding to them.  Try to gauge what 
the emotion is behind each message.  Once you do this, you then know:
•	
What her views on dating are
•	
What sort of dating (or other) topics she deems worth of her time, so you can 
create a conversation opener and script based on that topic
•	
Whether or not she habitually trolls for guys and dumps them, just to add notches 
to her chastity belt.
•	
Whether she’s a fuming man hater or a kind, loving soul
Here’s perhaps my most stalker-ish suggestion of all: if she has posted or sent her phone number 
(surprisingly, many women do, whether it be on their online dating profile or their social networking 
site), do a reverse look up of phone her number to find out where she lives.  I’m not suggesting that 
you go and show up at her door, or hide in an alleyway while watching her with binoculars.  The reason 
for doing this is to find out what’s in her area (think restaurants, entertainment, and other landmarks).  
This will help by:
•	
Again drawing more commonalities between you two.  You can say in passing, 
loving “Pizza 55” which just so happens to be on the corner of her street.  What 
a coincidence!
•	
She will feel more comfortable saying “yes” to going out for a first date to some 
place that is in her neighborhood 
You can definitely pick up on some very personalized hot conversation starters for your target of choice 
by taking a few minutes out of your day and doing a bit of work.  Some chicks really dig creating user 
names based on some sort of airy-fairy philosophy.  Searching the name might give you additional 
insight into her psychy.  If you just can’t seem to get any information on this rather elusive lady, there 
are some other hot topics that usually get a woman talking.
Hot Topics
Wondering what gets the ladies talking?  Try out any of these ten things for guaranteed results:

Chapter 7 - Going Tête-à-Tête: The Conversation Do’s and Don’ts
•	
Hopes, aspirations 
•	
Hobbies/interests in general
•	
Music 
•	
Dreams
•	
Romance
•	
Friends
•	
Travel
•	
Vacations
•	
Movies
•	
Entertainment
Not only are these hot topics great if you really don’t have a thing in hell to say to a woman, whether 
in person or online, but they are a surefire way to get her to talk at ANY point in your relationship 
together, whether it lasts 5 hours or 5 years.
One thing that I should also mention is that women ALWAYS enjoy talking about THEMSELVES.  
A lot of these hot topics can serve as good ways to get women to talk about themselves: hopes and 
aspirations; hobbies; music; dreams; friends; hell, even entertainment can be spun around to be 
about them.  Even questions about their day, their clothes and their friends are sure to yield positive 
results.  
Be sure you also use these topical conversation starters to introduce yourself into the exchange. 
Coming up shortly: some tips on how to do just that.
Bad Topics
No matter how much of a chatterbox your female companion may be, these ten topics below are sure 
to either bore her or make her cringe.  This does not apply to ALL women of course.  There are always 
exceptions.  But for the vast majority, avoid talking about: 
•	
Politics 
•	
Other dates 
•	
Past relationships 
•	
Science fiction 
•	
Religion 
•	
Celebrities 
•	
Science 
•	
Antiques 
•	
Money 
•	
History 
Did I mention this before – at least three times!  DO NOT be overtly sexual.  Yeah, sexualizing a 
conversation is fantastic, but it’s also a skill, an art.  Being blatantly horny is just perverted.  This 
means:
•	
No noticeable breast comments (“What are those, double D’s?  Bet I could get 
my motorboat in there…”)
•	
No obvious “below the belt” comments (“You look as if you’re as tight as a 
nun”)
•	
No  blatant sexual comments (“Popping your cherry will be the cherry on top 
of my day”)
•	
No hardcore grossness (“I’d take a blowjob over a Dirty Sanchez any day.”)
Believe it or not, even the horniest of women do not want to be treated like a whore, which is 
essentially what you’re doing.  Plus comments like these will more than likely get your ass beat.

Chapter 7 - Going Tête-à-Tête: The Conversation Do’s and Don’ts
Politics: Not a great dating topic.  Most people, male or female, aren’t even into politics – and if they 
are, they’re often so polarized in their views that if you back the wrong party, you’re toast, just like 
that.  Either way, reserve your political rants and commentary until at least 3 to 5 dates in.
NOTE:  If you met the girl at a political rally, stick to the “politics” that are related to that one 
particular interest.  Do not stray into other areas that she may or may not be interested in.  The risk 
of offending her is too high; it may very well cost you a good lay.
Social Issues are another area that you want to stay away from until later.  If you want to get laid, 
don’t sound off about putting shovels in the hands of the homeless or sending drug addicts to an ice 
flow in Antarctica.  If she does happen to bring something up, nod sympathetically, but keep your 
damn mouth shut.  Wait for her to finish and give her a hug to assure her everything will be okay.  If 
she asks for your opinion, simply tell her that you definitely see her point and it’s opened your eyes.  
But do not give your opinion, whether you agree or not. 
Religion is another extremely touchy subject.  Though organized religion is becoming less prevalent 
with each passing day, it still can sour any conversation far too easily for you to even risk using it as 
a topic of discussion.  If she opens a conversation with “Have you found Jesus?”, don’t let Mr. Happy 
force you to say yes.  Frankly, my smart-ass answer has been to respond with “Geez...I didn’t know he 
was lost.  If I do find him, I’ll be sure to let him know he should call home.”
There is an exception to the rule, however: if you met at church camp, or at some religion’s website, 
then feel free to praise whomever all you want.  Just make sure it’s the same deity she’s praising, 
infidel.
The number of Sexual Partners is, foolishly enough, something that guys will ask right off the 
bat.  This is a sure fire way to NOT get laid.  One, do you really care?  Does it really matter?  Two, 
you know the conversation will be reversed and the question will be asked of you.  Let me tell ya: no 
answer that any man or woman can give to this is the right answer.  Unless you’re a virginal female.  
Women don’t want virginal men.  
But they also don’t want whores.
See how complex they are? Screwed if you do, screwed if you don’t.  Let me rephrase that…
Conversation Starters
Though some of the conversation starters with women are the same online as they are in person, 
there are still some big differences.  For starters, you cannot simply walk up to a woman on LavaLife 
and compliment her choice of purse.
After you have taken the time to read her profile and perform a background check, or conduct a little 
market research as I prefer to call it, you can give some of these conversation starters a try:
If she’s doing or has said something – ANYTHING:
“Oh man, that totally reminds me of…[insert what it reminds you 
of]”
If there’s some hot topic in the news (controversial or not and without diving into politics):
“What’s your take on the whole [insert news] situation?”
If you’re at a club or bar and a popular song comes on (works well, if it’s older):
“I totally remember where I was when I first heard this song [you 
can insert your funny story here]. Where were you?”
The Dating Commando

Chapter 7 - Going Tête-à-Tête: The Conversation Do’s and Don’ts
If you’re online specifically and found her on a dating site:
“I remember how I first heard about this site… [Insert funny 
anecdote].  How’d you hear about it?  What are your experiences?”
Ok, so there’s this pick up artist who seems to think that this totally douchebag line is a good idea:
“I just had to come over (or, if online, “contact you”)… you’re 
beautiful. Can I have your autograph?” 
To me, that’s a bit too close to kissing ass.  It violates one of the most important rules: Do not tell 
her she’s pretty!  Not to mention that it’s very much what every guy online writes to her.  But if you 
wanna be a kiss ass, become her bitch and struggle to get her attention, give that conversation starter 
a go.  
One word of caution: Don’t make it seem like a job interview.  How can you make it seem like a 
job interview?  By asking these dumbass questions:
“So what do you do?”
“How many siblings do you have?”
“How do you plan on supporting yourself in the future?”
Yawn.
How do you avoid the job interview?  Rephrase what you say rather than asking an actual question.  
For instance, instead of “what do you do?” you can take something that she said previously and 
restate it:
“So you like helping children? Very commendable.  I’d love to 
hear more about it.”
Then she will go on and on about that.  Be sure to keep on interjecting some 
quick anecdotes about yourself in the conversation, and be sure to make yourself 
sound interesting.
If you have any problems coming up with a conversation starter, try giving one of 
these a try:
•	
Do you believe in psychics and tarot card readings?  
•	
Have you ever had a psychic reading or tarot card reading?  What were 
the predictions?  You’ll be surprised how many women have done this.
•	
Why does Maury run shows on “who da baby daddy?”  Why does TV 
continue to run Maury at all?
•	
Have you ever met anyone famous?  Where?
•	
What’s the deal with incense – sexy or allergy-inducing?
•	
Do you believe in ghosts? … have you ever had an experience you couldn’t explain? 
Again, you’ll be amazed how people have.
•	
Do you have any phobias, like a fear of apples?
•	
You said you liked hiking in you profile…ever meet a bear or a cougar?
•	
Are vampires really that interesting?  Why is Twilight such a big hit?
•	
English accents: a turn on?  Or just plain annoying?
•	
Ever been stuck in a car with four girls – all suffering from PMS – who proceeded to have 
a food fight in the damn car?
TIP: Girls always 
have an “emotion” 
linked to anything 
and everything, 
so be sure to keep 
asking about 
THEMSELVES 
rather than blather 
on and on about 
yourself.

•	
When I was in the hospital with [whatever illness], it really made me re-evaluate my 
life.  Have you ever been in a situation like that?  What sort of revelations came to you?
•	
If you had to exist in the wild for a week like Survivorman would you choose a blistering 
hot climate, or a freezing cold area to try and survive in?
•	
You have a chance to win a million bucks.  Would you eat a bull penis like they did on Fear 
Factor?  You sexualizing devil, planting the image of bull penis in her mind!

Am I missing something…? Why are the Jonas Brothers such a hit?

Why did they take Grimmace out of the McDonald’s ads?

Are you a passionate person?

Is there more to you than meets the eye?  Sorry, lame Transformer’s quote… but seriously,

What are your three best qualities?

Can you cook?  Tell me, how many different recipes are there that use rhubarb?
Have A Story
Do you consider yourself an interesting person?  Okay, how about REMOTELY interesting?  Everyone 
has a story, no matter how lame you may think it is.  Think about it: what happened last night when 
you went out?  Or while you were watching television?  Did you go on any vacations or fun adventures 
at any point in your life?  If you’re stuck, think about:
•	
Where you grew up
•	
Your experiences in both grade school and high school
•	
Any extra curricular activities you did when you were young
•	
Any hobbies that you have now
•	
How you met your best friend
•	
Your friends’ stupid antics
Yes, even talking about your dumb ass FRIENDS can be grounds for an excellent story.  Or you can 
directly steal one of their stories and tell it!  If it’s a bad boy story, make sure it’s not a buzz killer 
story about mugging a little old lady or robbing the 7-11 at gun point.  I exaggerate, but you get the 
idea.
In addition to being a great way to get the conversation ball rolling, stories are also an opportunity 
to introduce yourself without any of the obvious flirtations and formalities.  What is also great about 
this is that a story is never addressed to just ONE PERSON.  So if you’re in a group chat environment 
of any kind, or are at a bar and talking to a group of girls in person, you can gauge which girl you may 
have the best chance with by her reaction to your story.
A story will come in handy when deciding your opening script line or lines for contacting women, as 
well.  Giving a quick summary of the story in one or two lines – without the details – will capture her 
interest:
Would you believe it if I told you I once beat Snoop Dogg in a 
rap battle?
Or
I once was lost in downtown Shanghai and could not find my hotel -

for three days!
Or
I won the lottery once, and guess what I bought?  A button.
A short summary of two or three of the interesting things in your life are a great conversation starter 
or opening script, such as:
I partied hard in both Los Angeles and New York and got thrown 
out on my ass both times – for two different reasons – both 
resulting in me losing my shirt.
Or 
I was attacked by both a shark and a horse within 24 hours.  Ask 
me how!
Two Truths And A Lie
The name of this game is pretty self explanatory: you tell two truths and one lie, and whoever is 
listening or reading these three pieces of information has to pick out which is which.
You may think that this game sounds kind of lame, but trust me.  Girls love this kind of challenge, 
especially if you have really GOOD truths and a lie.  Plus it brings out your “wild, fun, crazy” side – 
without being too crazy.
Not sure how the game works?  Here’s how it goes.
Think of two truths about yourself.  ANYTHING.  Such as:
•	
Past experiences
•	
Your current occupation
•	
Where you have traveled 
You know, shit like that.  I’m not going to list them all, because I hope to God that you’re smart 
enough to get the idea.
So you need to come up with two “truths”, the crazier the better.  Two crazy truths for me are: my 
shirt caught fire when on a Britney Spears music video shoot, and I once had to kill a boa with my 
bare hands so I could eat while traveling in the Amazon.
One lie is: I’ve been to 50 cities that begin with the letter “s”.
Get the idea?  She then has to guess which one is the lie.  She’ll probably be shocked by your crazy 
experiences and start asking about those two stories, as well as ask how you came up with the lie.
The great thing about this game is that, later on, you can easily sexualize it.  Hold off doing that, 
though, when you’re using this as a conversation opener.  I doubt a girl would want to play this game 
if the three topics are:
I’ve fucked over 30 women, I have contracted gonorrhea twice, and 
my dick is 12 inches hard!
On second thought, don’t ever use this one ever.  You look like a shit piece, no matter which one is a 
lie and which two are truths.

Play 20 Questions
If you’ve ever played 20 questions, you  know how goddamn ANNOYING that game becomes after 
question 4.  It feels like either a really bad job interview, or an interrogation with a clueless cop down 
at station.
What your job is in this case is to come up with 20 GOOD questions to ask the girl.  Questions 
should, preferably, be related to her profile and the information she posts.  If it’s some random ass 
question, she’ll know that you aren’t even trying and will realize that this is 
just some bad scripted response.
What you also need to do is to play 20 questions with YOURSELF.   This helps 
prepare you for any questions that may be coming your way so you will be 
able to prepare some GOOD answers – no weak ass “uhh, I dunno” sort of 
responses.  Girls HATE that!
Here’s an example of 20 questions you can ask a girl or yourself:
•	
Of all of your “bad habits”, which is your worst?
•	
Are you more competitive or laid back?
•	
What is the dumbest thing you have ever purchased?
•	
If you won $1,000,000 what would you do with it?
•	
If you could enter someone else’s body and be them for a day, who would it be?
•	
Do you believe in monogamy? (if so, why? To avoid yes-no answer)
•	
How many pillows are on your bed?
•	
What is your favorite movie?
•	
What body part do you love to have massaged?
•	
What is your bed-time routine?
•	
What part of your body is the most ticklish?
•	
It’s Sunday morning: what are you doing?
•	
If you could hook up with anyone on this planet, who would it be and why?
•	
Would you pose naked for an art class – for free?
•	
How do you release stress?
•	
Where is the one place you would travel to today if you were dead tomorrow?
•	
Who would you most aspire to be (the person can be alive or dead)?
•	
What is the one thing that the opposite sex MUST KNOW about you?
•	
How often do you  sunbathe in the nude?
•	
What is your guiltiest pleasure?
Learn How To Ask Questions
I know that a lot of you guys out there do not even know how to flirt.  The best way of flirting is not 
telling the girl information; it’s ASKING her FOR information.  
Now, here’s a very important point when flirting and asking questions: never ask questions with a 
YES or NO answer.  NEVER.  This makes the response far too easy, and far too boring for everyone 
and anyone involved.
FYI: Girls DO 
NOT respond well 
to shitty, obviously 
scripted messages. 
They cannot hit the

Chapter 7 - Going Tête-à-Tête: The Conversation Do’s and Don’ts
For instance, instead of using the cheesy line (NEVER USE IT! NEVER!), “Do you come here often?” 
ask her a more inquisitive question such as, “So what is it about this place that brought you here?”  
See how it makes her think?  SEE how it offers up far more information than a freakin’ “yes”?  And it 
doesn’t sound nearly as creepy.
Good flirting questions have great root questions, such as:
•	
“How do I ask you…”
•	
“How can I possibly tell you…?”
•	
“Perhaps I could ask you first…”
•	
“What’s different about…?”
•	
“How would I know…?”
•	
“What do you think about…?”
•	
“What do you want to do about…?”
The great thing about these questions is that you can make them as in depth or as shallow as you 
want.
For example, “How could I possibly tell you that you look gorgeous tonight without sounding like 
every other guy in here?” is what I consider to be a fairly shallow question.  Flip it and ask, “What is 
more difficult for you; looking into someone’s eyes when you are telling someone how you feel, or 
looking into someone’s eyes when they are telling you how they feel?” and you are in a whole different 
league of questions.
Exaggerate!!!
There is nothing more goddamn boring than a literal, colorless retelling of a tale or event, no matter 
HOW exciting the premise is.  If someone’s talking about almost getting hit by a car by simply saying, 
“You know, today I almost got hit by a car.  How scary”  It is not nearly as interesting as a lively, 
descriptive story, such as:
So I had just bought a jumbo dog from that cart on Main and 33rd 
– you know the one? The one that sells crab juice?  Right, so I 
had just gotten this jumbo dog that I layered in sauerkraut, and 
just as I’m taking a large bite from the jumbo dog I step – JUST 
ONE FOOT – off of the side walk, since the little “walk” man 
had flashed up on the crosswalk.  But oh no, apparently SOMEone 
couldn’t follow directions.  Suddenly all of the air sucked in 
around me and, in a snap, a Civic tears right past me and blows 
that sucked air right back in my face, nearly running me over!  
I swear to god, my toes were an inch from where the tire treads 
landed. My dripping mustard was IN the tire tread.
Far more interesting, right?  Another note you must make here is that women are interested in the 
DETAILS.  Fuck, they’ll even want to know what shoes you were wearing and try to gauge just how 
much your Converse or Nikes would protect your toes had that car run over your foot.
So be free with the information.  Exaggerate.  Be playful.  She’s begging for it.
Keep in mind that some girls will be too drunk, too dumb, or too pissy on that given day to even 
listen to what you’re saying.  Do not become dismayed by your particular topic of conversation.  You 
can recycle ones you’ve used before (we’ll discuss back up plans shortly).

Conversation Killers
In real life or online, a conversation killer is certainly easy to spot.  It may involve a phrase or 
sentence that had its meaning misunderstood, such as:
Damn, you are a shapely girl!
(You meant to say that she has bangin’ curves.  Translation to the woman: I’M FAT?!?)
I swear those girls’ breasts over there are the same size as 
yours.
(You meant: you both have gorgeous, big titties.  Translation to the woman: I’m not unique or 
special)
Oh man, have you been working out?
(You meant: you’re fine as fuck!  Translation to the woman: Shit, should I be working out?  Was I fat 
before?)
Do you see a common trend?  If you don’t, look again: each conversation killer I mentioned up here 
was a compliment on the WOMAN’S BODY.  This is a lose-lose situation.  
Look, whether women want to admit it or not, most of them are incredibly self conscious about 
their appearance and they all seem to think that they’re too fat, or too flat chested, or just not pretty 
enough.  Trying to compliment or open a conversation on their appearance just brings all of these 
fears rushing back to them – which creates bad feelings – which makes you a bad man.  
What seems to have occurred to me during my research, however, is that we actually fuck up with 
our conversations far more ONLINE than we do in real life!  Maybe it’s that sense of freedom or being 
untouchable, or having that 2000 character limit that makes us think that we need to go on and on 
about ourselves.  Whatever it is, it’s sabotaging our efforts to get “in” with the women.
I’ve included some examples of bad conversation starters below, including my “grade” and an 
explanation as to why they suck (as if it’s not obvious).  
Let’s begin with this “winner”:
[Your Subject Line]: Good morning….starshine……
Man are you EVER cute!!!
Do you remember why this is bad?  Remember, every guy on that goddamned dating site has told 
her how cute, how pretty, how gorgeous, beautiful, stunning, hot and sexy she is.  She will look at this 
message and think,
“Well, YEAH.”  *delete*
It also does not indicate that you read her profile at all (which you probably didn’t, right?).  She may 
very well think you’re just some dirt bag who checked out her pictures, possibly wanked off to the 
more scandalous ones, and now are trying to get her in the sack with a cute little pet name.  
My Grade: F
[Marcus]: hi there
What the… huh?  What IS this?  What do you expect her to write you back with, her life story?  This 
doesn’t prove at all that you even read her profile or took note of her interests.  This is plain old

laziness and will definitely get you no where.  And believe it or not, the asshole who sent this used the 
site moderator’s name with the hope that she’d read the goddamned thing thinking it was some sort 
of important message.  Seriously...what a dickwad.  
At least the previous message used a cute nickname: “starshine”.  A desperate, lonely girl may 
actually take a bite at that one.
My Grade: F-
[Good hearted Man – Loves Children]: Hi,  I thought I would try 
to get your attention
Here is some basic information about Colin, moi  !I have had no 
luck fishing this sea, but your beauty caught my attention.  Below 
is some general traits about moi  !  Your features really caught 
my eye !!! Your profile is very cool.  Your inner beauty is what I 
seek a relationship with, friends first----cause I have so much to 
share
I’m laid back, hardworking,kind,considerate,committed,loyal and 
VERY passionate about love and life- I’m cultured, and educated. 
----Love to have fun, laugh.  If you have established intimacy 
with yourself-and recognize your wonderful gifts you bring to 
life… It should be a great life, ya!!
I worked on a family farm in the Eastern Townships of Quebec… 
I was born in Montreal.  You could assume I’m cultured and 
educated…
I have a gift with children…
Okay, I have to stop RIGHT THERE.  This is awful.  This isn’t even the entire message, either – this 
is about one third of the crap that he spewed.  Let’s pick this apart one by one, shall we?
The nickname, “Good hearted Man – Loves Children” makes the guy sound like a child molester.  It 
doesn’t convey the message of him being a good guy at all; it’s just creepy.
The next thing that I absolutely hate about this message is how he threw in some random “moi” crap 
in there.  Is this his idea of sounding cultured by throwing in some basic French?  Is the girl supposed 
to cream her pants over this?  
Below is some general traits about moi  !  
Bad grammar and goddammit there’s that pretentious  MOI again!  In case you are not aware, 
“traits” is plural, so be sure to use “are” when in reference to something that’s plural.  Even the 
dimmest of girls will read this and know something’s not right with it, even if they aren’t an English 
major.  See?  Bad grammar just makes you sound dumb (except when I do it - in which case it’s hip).
Your inner beauty is what I seek a relationship with, friends 
first----cause I have so much to share
Ew.  Seriously?  She will be left thinking, you’re trying to become my friend and have so much to 
“share”’?  Girls will read between the lines: by share, you definitely don’t mean a coffee.  You mean 
your penis.  
Unless, they’ve already fallen for you, they’d rather have the mocha, thanks.
If you have established intimacy with yourself-and recognize your 
wonderful gifts you bring to life...

Chapter 7 - Going Tête-à-Tête: The Conversation Do’s and Don’ts
Established intimacy with myself?  Is this guy talking about masturbation?  Because that’s the first 
thing that comes to my mind.  Sure, I’m a dude, so masturbation matters, almost as much as hockey,  
but I guarantee you that that’s the first thing any girl is going to think too. 
Now about these “wonderful gifts”:  this guy wouldn’t know about this girls’ wonderful gifts.  He 
doesn’t know her well enough.  This is a total kiss ass line and will not be appreciated by the receiver.
I worked on a family farm in the Eastern Townships of Quebec… 
I was born in Montreal.  You could assume I’m cultured and 
educated…
All because he was born in a Province that is en français does not MEAN that he is cultured.  Fuck, 
first off this dude grew up on a frigging FARM.  Secondly, it’s a farm in Quebec.  You ever met a 
Quebecois?  They’re crass, rude, racist, intolerant, uneducated and the least cultured people you’ll 
ever meet.  And I should know...I was born there.  If you’re from another country or area of town, do 
not make this kind of comment.  Right now, she’d be rolling her eyes.  It sounds as if the guy is telling 
HER how she should be thinking of him – not cool.  In her eyes, that shit comes across as controlling.
I have a gift with children…
Again, a bit too creepy.  Statements like these also make one assume that the writer wants to have 
children, and wants to have children soon.  Most girls aren’t down with that, at least not so quickly.
This message is horrible for so many reasons.  It’s too long, it’s too divulging of uninteresting 
features of the guy’s life, leaving no element of mystery or teasing, and again, it does not really say 
anything about what he read in her profile.  Saying that a girl has “inner beauty” does nothing but say 
to them that the guy wants to get in her pants, especially when the guy knows far too little about the 
woman to comment on anthing “inner”.  This guy takes the fine art of douchebaggery to a whole new 
level.
My Grade:  F- - -
The LOL’er
Have I mentioned this yet?  No?  Okay then.  If I have, I’m going to damn well mention it again: CUT 
THE LOL’S.  This includes LMAO, LMFAO, ROFLMAO and ROFLMFAO etc, etc, etc.  Just stop with the 
emoticons and text lingo already.  LOL’s have become a replacement for thinking creatively, or just 
realizing the fact that you have no idea what the fuck you can possibly say in return!  All too many a 
conversation carries out like this:
B00tsm8e4walkin: omg & then she told me she thought i was sum 
kind of ho
[YOU]: LOL
B00tsm8e4walkin: and i couldnt beliee it.  likre, all cuz i made 
more $$ waitressin im a ho?  get real
B00tsm8e4walkin: its just so ridiculus
[YOU]: LOL
B00tsm8e4walkin:  Uhh, hello  ?
See how she just assumed you basically disconnected from the chat AND the conversation?  Please… 
PLEASE tell me that you can see just how weak this is.  This is awful.  Honestly, it looks as if you’re 
not even paying attention to her.  This is the online equivalent to a guy just staring into the depth of 
a woman’s cleavage and giggling like a slack-jawed doofus.  At worst, it sounds like you’re typing LOL 
with your left hand while downloading porn jpegs with your right. 
Do not LOL.  Do not LOL.  DO NOT.  I don’t care how “acceptable” or “trendy” it is to LOL at 
someone’s joke, it’s gotten to a point that it is no longer appropriate to LOL all of the time, as 
many people do.  When you get right down to it, it’s just a sign of laziness.   The LOL’er unwittingly

communicates that he/she has not taken the time to listen to you and think creatively about your 
situation.  So… why would this LOL’er even be worth your time then, hmm?
If something is funny to you, say so.  LOL means, literally, “laugh out loud”.  So unless you have 
made some sort of laughing noise with your mouth keep FAR AWAY from the LOLs.

Have A Back Up Plan
This does take a bit of premeditating but it’s extremely important for you to have a back up plan.  
You have got to plan a certain flow to a conversation - a flow that has a couple of alternative endings 
or routes as backups.  Did you ever read those “Choose Your Own Adventure” books as a kid?  It 
should look something like that.
Here’s an example of a basic back up plan:
You: Hi
Her: Hello…
You: I couldn’t help but notice… what’s the story behind that 
necklace you’re wearing? [Look with feigned interest – though she can’t 
tell it’s feigned]
Her: Oh, it’s been passed down to me from my grandmother
You: Wow… 
Stuck?  Don’t be.  There’s tons of different routes here, just be sure to compliment her grandmother.
Example 1:
You: Your grandmother sure has great taste.
Example 2:
You: I love family traditions.  See this ring here?  This was 
passed down to me from my grandfather.
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online

96
Chapter 7 - Going Tête-à-Tête: The Conversation Do’s and Don’ts
Example 3:
You: Wooo!  Looks like your grandma was quite the fox back in the 
day.  I’m lovin’ that necklace!
Example 3 should be used with a bit more caution because you’re starting to sexualize the 
conversation, but really, when you’re talking about someone’s grandma being a fox, it’s quite PG and 
acceptable.  Hell, usually the grandkids take it as a compliment to have such a fine grandparent.  It 
reflects nicely on their designer genes.
Some general rules behind having a conversational back up plan are the following:
•	
Paraphrase what she has already said to try and extract more information out of her
•	
Ask about any persons involved in her conversation
•	
Relate what has been said to something about YOU and encourage her to ask questions 
(i.e. Guess how many points I got in that one basketball game?  Guess how I broke my 
ankle?  Which of the two options do you think I took?)
•	
Have a joke or great story about yourself lined up
•	
Use obviously corny pick up lines (“So what’s YOUR sign?”) to continue a conversation – 
and make sure she KNOWS you’re using the line as a joke
•	
If the conversation gets awkward, laugh about how awkward it is (WITHOUT LOL’ing) and 
restate your interest in her in some way
•	
Move her!  Yes, I do mean PHYSICALLY MOVE HER to another location, even if the 
location is only 10 steps away.  A change of scenery may spark a conversation.
This brings us to…
The Magic Touch
During conversation, touch the woman, but not too much.  What I mean by this is to not make any 
awkward or lewd movements.
Here are some examples of good touching that will move your conversation forward:
•	
Gently placing your fingers on her upper arm (Don’t leave them there, dummy!)
•	
Softly touch her lower back (Beware: this does not mean her ASS, alright?  Keep it to 
the back!)
•	
Caress one of her fingers briefly before guiding her to where you would like to take her. 
(i.e., a restaurant booth, a seat, etc). You can also guide her by pressing on her lower 
back, or by nudging her lightly with your upper-arm touch
NOTE: Girls love to be guided.  Though they do not like to be controled, they do expect you to “be a 
man” and be in command of where she’s going, especially when you’re meeting for the first time.
This being said, be warned: if a woman is not receptive to being touched, you are definitely going to 
end up with your ass FLAT on the floor.  Here are some tips on how to tell a woman does NOT want to 
be touched:
•	
She’s scowling (unless that’s naturally how her face is… but do you want to “tap that” 
anyway?)
•	
She’s frowns or “squints” at you upon being touched.  I think this is pretty self explanatory…

Chapter 7 - Going Tête-à-Tête: The Conversation Do’s and Don’ts
•	
Her arms are crossed in front of her body.  CLASSIC defensive pose.  You touch her now, 
and you’ll be seeing her back hand
•	
She has her hip cocked to one side.  She may or may not have her hand propped up on it 
too.  Even if she’s doing this in a flirtatious manner, she still has most of her defenses up 
at this point and is still measuring you up.  Girls hate being touched by guys they don’t 
trust, so don’t to it!
•	
Her back is turned to you.  I don’t know WHY some jack asses think it’s a good idea to 
come up behind a girl and either:
- Hump and thrust at her like a rabid animal
- Grab at her like a rabid animal
- Hug her from behind as if she’s in the psych ward and requires restraint
•	
If she has rolled her eyes at you within the past 5 minutes, you don’t stand a chance in 
hell of touching her without being brushed off.  The girl isn’t taking you seriously enough 
to consider your filthy grubs touching her
Be sure to gently place your fingers on her upper arm, or her lower back, but don’t spank or grope 
her.  She’ll feel as if you are belittling her and treating her as if she were some common whore.  Not 
cool.  Think ‘respectful affection’ when you touch her.  It’ll help.
Something else that some guys do that you need to be aware of: never lean against a wall, with or 
without your arm bracing yourself.  Like I mentioned before, this is pretty aggressive body language 
and immediately makes the girl feel as if she’s trapped.  Chicks do NOT dig this kind of shit.  Trust me.  
Remember that the goal here is to get them coming back to you WILLINGLY – and maybe even full out 
breaking into a sprint to catch up to you.
Here’s a good general rule: if the girl has not touched you yet, she probably isn’t overly receptive to 
you touching her.  But if you wanna give it a go, look for these signals before making any attempts at 
touching:
•	
If she is leaning towards you, or hell, INTO you (if you’re lucky) then by all means touch!
•	
If she asks you where something – ANYTHING – is,  you then have the right to be 
courteous and gently guide her by the elbow or hand, as described above, to that 
destination – and let your fingers linger a bit after you’ve reached where you’re going, 
but don’t keep holding on.  It’s a bit of a teaser, completely non-creepy and she’ll like it.
•	
While dancing: If she is in front of you and FACING YOU touching happens as part of 
dancing.  Remember, you don’t want to attach yourself to her hips from behind and stay 
there.  Girls HATE that.   It’s okay to hold them from behind, so when they  spin around, 
smile, laugh, and either keep up with her dancing (if you can) or take her hands and 
guide her into a silly waltz.  Girls LOVE that shit!
As the touching and the night progresses, you can start to touch a bit more.  You want to be sure to 
keep your touches gentle, sensuous, yet in appropriate places of her body.  Do not, by any means, 
slam your hand down her pants or up her skirt.  Do NOT, under any circumstances, cup a boob.  It 
isn’t appropriate.  If she presses her boobs against you while waltzing, tighten your chest muscles for 
just a second.  She’ll feel it and think that she has excited you. 
When touching a woman, think of how your touches are reflecting your skills in the bedroom.  
Women love tingly feelings.  Running your fingers ever so softly up her upper arms is sure to give her 
the pleasure tickles.  Try running them up and down her spine too (no matter how tempting, do not 
grope her ass!), or if you’re sitting, run them up her thighs – just not too high.  Maximum height is 
three-quarters of the way up (though I’d suggest staying half way up the thigh and down to the knee).
Be sure to keep smiling, and look into her eyes, even when touching.  Now isn’t the time to gawk at 
her and make her uncomfortable.  Keep up with the conversation while touching her, too, to somewhat

distract her from what’s going on and to give the impression that your sensual caresses are second 
nature to you.
And hey, if you need to cross your legs after all this touching (YOU know what I’m talking about) be 
sure to do that.  Oh, and on that note, be sure to wear some kind of heavy-weighted pant material, 
like jeans.  These are WAY better at concealing excitement than sweat pants.
False Time Constraints
This section is all about closing the conversation and putting the pressure on by making her think 
that you have somewhere else to be.  You and I both know that you have nowhere to be, but she 
doesn’t need to know that.  Letting her know that you have somewhere you (supposedly) need to be  
makes you look important.
You have undoubtedly watched those awful infomercials at 3am, right?  The ones that tell you for 
a “LIMITED TIME ONLY, YOU CAN (blahblahblah)”?  This is called PRESSURE SELLING.  Remember 
Chapter 2, when you learned that you were a product?  Now is the time where more marketing skills 
come in to play.
You should be in and out of a conversation with any girl in under 5 minutes.  If you are in a dating 
chat room, no matter how excited (in every way and form) you may be, you need to have the will 
power to log off and talk to her again IN PERSON.
So just how do you create a false time constraint?  Say shit like…
You know, if I didn’t have to take off right now – which I do – I 
would…
Or
I’m only here for a second, I’m at my friends’ place.  So here’s 
my answer/my opinion in under a minute…
Or
I only have a minute here, so I’ll have to be quick.  But here’s 
the deal…
Busy, busy, busy!  False time constraints force the girl to realize that you can easily be lost to her 
unless she puts the effort in.  
I will go into more detail about how handy false time constraints are with your scripts in Chapter 9.  
If you haven’t gotten girls to actually meet up with you and go on a date, this information will be a 
godsend!
Practice Makes Perfect
When it comes to talkin’, you need to be practicin’.  Even with this crazy online dating business, 
speaking to people regularly IN PERSON will greatly improve your game.  Trust me, it will help.  Here 
are some tips on helping your conversational game:
How To Improve Your T-Game (Talk Game)
Be talkative.  Talk to any damn person, man, woman and child, and smile when in public.  Get used 
to being open and invite the challenge of seeking topics to speak about with anyone.

Chapter 7 - Going Tête-à-Tête: The Conversation Do’s and Don’ts
Do not show off!  Your goal should not be to show off.  Do not bother impressing anyone.  Just 
bother yourself with coming up with interesting shit to say.
Stay away from weird shit.  Your comic book collection is not a good place to start in with anyone.  
Vampires and zombies aren’t either, unless they’re a Twilight fan.
Keep the target moving.  Practice moving your target to another destination, such as forward three 
steps (small victories ARE still victories) or to a park bench.  
Be vulnerable.  Make yourself appear vulnerable by taking jabs at yourself.  
Look for common interests.  Seek out what is common between you and your listener (besides 
being human – I hope).
Practice!  PRACTICE your pre-written stories and answers to the 20 questions (as previously 
discussed).
Practice some more!  PRACTICE shit that you haven’t even prepared yet.  Be spontaneous every 
once in a while and see how it goes.
Take the lead.  If something’s boring, change the subject ASAP.
Be interesting.  Think of fun, compelling and interesting subjects that will easily get a reply or an 
opinion.  Topics that involve emotion (positive or empathetic, if possible) are great conversational 
starters.
Shut your yap!  Don’t disagree with everything she says – just shut it and be agreeable.  
Chapter Conclusion
Women like talking about themselves.  So let them.
Be sure to have stories about yourself lined up to use as conversation pieces.
Avoid topics like politics, religion,  number of sexual partners and sexual history.
Never LOL.  Never LOL.  Don’t you DARE have me catching you LOL! 
LMAO (Lecturing My Ass Off).
There are ways that you can touch a woman that will propel the conversation forward – just be 
sure to touch when appropriate and if permitted by her.

8  How To Write A Killer Script
The Dating Commando
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide to Conquering Women Online

Chapter 8 - How To Write A Killer Script
I
n the world of online dating, having a killer script means EVERYTHING.  It means you’re 
interesting, it means you’re captivating, it means that you have at least a slim chance that a 
woman will pay attention to you and respond to your efforts.
I’m going to start off this chapter by sharing something very personal with you – one of my first test 
scripts.  In fact, what you’re about to see are some of the actual messages sent or received during my 
research.  This particular test script did not yield many successful prospects; as a matter of fact, I don’t 
think any women actually replied to it at all.  You will no doubt recognize its shortcomings as you read:
You know those moments where your heart skips a beat?  The 
excitement and rush you feel when you meet someone new?  The raw, 
unadulterated passion of your first time together?  The sheer 
thrill of walking into a room and seeing each other?  That time you 
spend alone counting each and every minute until you’ll see each 
other again?  The craziness of spending every single waking moment 
thinking about that special someone and not being able to get your 
mind onto anything else? 
And while you’re wondering what’s wrong with you, you’re smiling 
and just can’t stop.  The irony is that every one of these feelings 
are emotions you LOVE and wouldn’t trade for anything in the world.  
The woman I’d like to date makes me feel that way, and I make her 
feel the same.  She’s that special someone who makes me feel like a 
giddy teenager sneaking out of the house.
I’m a really happy person with a fantastic sense of humor. I’m fun, 
interesting, creative, and a child at heart.  I have a bold sense 
of adventure, but am more “dumb” than I am brave.  Yes, I’d jump 
out of an airplane, but I’d cry every inch of the way down and then 
tell you I had a bug in my eye.    
Complacency has gotten the better of me and I need a change. I 
need adventure and excitement.  I crave those heartbeat skipping 
moments.
If you’re feeling the same, why not take a chance and say hello?
What’s the first and most important thing that jumps out to you that proves that this script is all 
wrong?  Did you guess it yet?  I’ll give YOU the answer at the end of the chapter.
Let’s get back to you: assuming that you’ve already tried your hand at online dating, I bet that you 
have some semblance of a contact script written out.  If you’re smart, you probably have it saved in 
Notepad on the computer as well.  You may even have a live chat environment script all planned out, to

winging it.”

Chapter 8 - How To Write A Killer Script
use when meeting girls in a live chat room or on MSN:
Hey girl, What’s going on?  I’m a hot 32/M/West Virginia with brown 
hair and a stacked body.  ASL?
For those of you not in the chat know, ASL means “Age, Sex, Location”.  Here’s another example of a 
chatroom script that does not measure up to that of a Dating Commando:
U seem really cute.   What brought you here?
A bit less lame, but it still sucks.  A LOT.
While we’re on the topic of what to say to chat room girls, do not go about sending her your topless 
pictures, or even worse, your genitals.  As much as we guys would like being sent naked pictures of 
girls, girls do NOT appreciate such love mementos, if I dare call them that.
Your email script, I’m guessing looks something like this:
Hey Im Chris and Im a 28 yr old construction worker.  I couldnt 
help but notice how beautiful you are.  I think you may have the 
beautiful soul Im lookin for.  Check out my profile and tell me if 
we are a good match!
This is no good.  Know why?  For one, incorrect punctuation.  Two, you’re again complimenting her on 
her hotness (remember how every guy does this?  The goal here is to stand OUT from the crowd, not to 
blend in).  Worst of all, you’re leaving the power in her hands to tell you if you two are a good match.  
How weak is that?  Very.
Another script you may have written out, perhaps under the misguided belief that this would be 
FUNNY:
Yo shawtie sup?  I jus stopped by to tell you how phat you be 
lookin’.  Youz supa fly!!! =D Holla back witcho digits
No girl is going to respond to this crap.  Are you kidding me?  Sure, there are dudes out there who 
actually speak like this on the daily!  She doesn’t know that you’re joking, given that she doesn’t even 
know you.  Really, she’ll think you’re some sort of wankster with zero street cred.  Loser.
Remember the script from the previous chapter?  Hell, I even had to chop that thing into little bite 
sized pieces because it was so long.  That’s another mistake you don’t want to make: don’t give your 
bloody life story.  She doesn’t care, though even more importantly, it leaves nothing to be discussed and 
explored later on.
When writing your script, look into what sort of conversation starters and questions you are wasting 
before you even meet her.  See how this one fails:
Hello, I couldn’t help but notice you when browsing through the 
profiles on here   I usually do not use this site, only from time 
to time.  What I’m usually doing is either working at my insurance 
job, doing my night classes for business admin at Clarks College, 
or I’m cooking.  I’m not a good cook though, so don’t expect 
anything fancy.  But if you’re a fan of hotdogs with loads of 
ketchup, I’m your man!
I’m 25 years old and want to become a manager or CEO of myown 
small business some day.  I’m thinking of opening a store like a 
Kinkos.  I know alot about the copying business, given how my dad 
used to have a business like that too when I was a kid (he doesn’t

any more; he’s retired and does puzzles all day.  Funny, huh?).  
My mom died when I was young, so I can onlyimagine she’s doing 
Sudokus up on inheaven!
I have one sister, she lives in Maine and she works for 
Microsoft.  I’m not sure what she does there, so don’t ask.  I 
credit her for teaching me how to treat a woman properly.  I 
think we’d have a good time, and I’d like to treat you to an ice 
cream and a walk on the board walk- no pressure!  
Look forward to hearing from you.
It’s too soon to mention why you’re going to school and what your aspirations are.  It’s too soon 
to mention how much of a puzzle fiend your father is, what your sister does, and to tell the girl that 
your mom’s dead and in heaven with a Sudoku book and pencil in hand.  Not to mention you used a 
goddamn SMILEY in your message.  Really, this is just too much and will overwhelm the girl, which will 
make her feel unsettled and uncomfortable.  Besides, you didn’t even talk about her at all.  You think 
she’ll bother replying?  No, she most likely will not.  Though, if she does, it’s almost worse than if she 
didn’t at all.  Her reply may be something like this:
Hey sounds like ur a buzy guy.  Sorry 2 hear bout ur mom.  Tx 4 
ur msg but I dont think wed be a good match   tk care!
Ugh.  Take care is really the girl saying fuck off nicely.  Whatever you do, curtail 
the angry, hurt, and disappointed feelings you may be experiencing.   Do NOT 
write back with something as pathetic and lame as this:
Y’know, I’m a nice guy, a hard working guy, and I’m a treat 
to any woman who’ll give me a chance.  You’ve missed out on a 
great love opportunity.  TAKE CARE.
This is so sad.  What are you expecting to gain by responding like this?  You 
expect the girl to come running back, suddenly realizing how the guy she doesn’t 
know actually truly IS awesome and sweet and everything she’s dreamed of?  
Or do you want her to apologize and grovel for a second chance?  Not going to 
happen.  She’s either going to smirk and delete it, or share it with all of her friends 
for a good laugh.
Or she’ll post it up on her Myspace or Facebook page for the world to see what an incredible loser you 
are.
We will show you how to reply to these sorts of messages in the next chapter, but for now, just chill 
out and don’t bother replying yet.
What Makes A Killer Script
As you have hopefully learned by now, writing a killer script does not involve you spewing your life 
story out to the girl.  Writing a killer script does not mean writing an essay.  There are some key rules 
to writing a good opening script that will improve your online dating success tenfold.
*	 NO long paragraphs allowed!  This includes email scripts.
*	 NO messages beyond 2-3 sentences allowed.  She won’t read anything longer.  Writing 
anything longer than 2-3 sentences also is giving away too much information about yourself.  
Keep it mysterious and tantalizing.  You’re sending out the hook – now you just need for her 
to bite.
 
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online
Don’t say too much 
too soon and be 
sure to talk about 
her and show in 
your email that 
you’ve actually 
read and paid 
attention to her 
profile.

104
Chapter 8 - How To Write A Killer Script
Be sure to give her just enough information to allow her a decent, intelligent reply.
*	 SPELL CHECK.  This is incredabully importante.  It doesntt matter how stupit her massages 
or write up iz, you need to b sure that yor spellig and grammer are dam neare prestine.  
You wnt to shew her that you haff comand ofer the English langwage.  This type uf control 
cumes acros as bein “sexy” to a women.  Not only thatt, but it shows that youe are edacated, 
consciountious of whut is bein sayedd, and haff take the time and resthect to write to her 
PROBERLY and with INTELLIJENCE.
 
Just to prove my point: did you take my shit seriously when you read it riddled with spelling 
errors, grammatical nightmares and typos?  I think not.
*	 NO emoticons and smiley’s allowed - EVER!  If you need to show that you’re being funny 
or cute with an emoticon, you’re not funny or cute, your joke didn’t work, and you’re just an 
asshole.  Rewrite the damned thing until it is obviously funny, or give up on TRYING to be 
funny and save it for when you have some face time. 
*	 NO txtlngo:   Later is not l8tr.  If you’re using your cell phone to reply or post messages, get 
a better cell phone with a proper keypad.  Besides, don’t be a dick and constantly text your 
shit.  It’s as annoying as all hell and if you’re driving, it’s dangerous.  You’re also not in grade 
8.  I’m assuming you’re an adult, so type like one.  U R PRTY does not spell you are pretty, 
it spells “I’m a lazy dickwad who doesn’t think you’re worth wasting effort on.”  While I’m at 
it, dump the LOL, LMAO LMFAO, ROFLMFAO, and ROFLCOPTER (We just finished covering this 
in the last chapter, but it’s so important that I decided to nag you about it again).  It’s okay to 
say, “man, that was really funny.  I haven’t laughed that hard in a long time!”  It is not okay 
to continuously LOL at the girl, especially if what she’s saying does not make you actually 
laugh out loud.  You’ll look like a desperate loon lol’ing at all of her comments.  Jerk.
*	 No L337 speak (aka LEET speak, or ELITE speak).  This should be a goddamn given… this 
is the geeky lingo to the extreme on the Internet that incorporates numbers as letters and all 
that crap.  Not sure what it is?  Here’s an example of you are hot in L337 language:
 
j00Z r |-|07 
 
Translation:  j00z (“you’s”, “youse”) r (are) |-|07 (hot)
Disgusting.
If this has been your game so far, I think it’s quite evident as to why you still have that pack of 
condoms that “j00R /\/\0/\/\” (translation: your mom) bought you when you were 13 (Just in case!).
And if you have been writing like that, I’m betting you’re STILL 13, no matter your chronological age.
*	 Provide a call to action, and let it be known that this is a limited time offer.  We 
touched on this for a brief moment earlier.  Do you know how many girls will read your 
message and just leave it til later?  Then they are bombarded with more messages… and more 
messages… until yours is just part of the heap and is ignored (whether it be intentional or 
not).  A call to action will help put the pressure on her to respond quickly.
NOTE: Call to action does NOT mean asking if she would like to go on a date with you.  This is not 
creative, it’s tiresome and so passé in this situation.
Some examples of a bad “call to actions” are:
The Dating Commando

105
Chapter 8 - How To Write A Killer Script
This is a one time offer!  You have 18 seconds... 17 seconds… 16 
seconds to take advantage of this offer… 13… 12 seconds…
Respond to me within the next hour and you get the second date 
absolutely free!
Call ***-***-**** within the next 5 minutes and you’ll receive a 
FREE glow in the dark condom.  FREE!
*	 NEVER give out your phone number or email address on first contact.  Most guys do 
this, thinking that a girl will jump all over that and instantly give the guy a call.  WRONG!  
Your more personal contact details will go unappreciated at this point since, well, she doesn’t 
even know you.  Save giving her these until she knows you better, and be sure to make her 
ask for them.  Remember: Our goal is to get her to work hard at snagging you!  You are her 
prize, she’s not yours!
And, most importantly:
*	 Read her Goddamned profile.  Remember when I stressed this earlier?  Here it is again 
– SMACK!  Read the damned thing.  It’s incredible how much ammo is in those short little 
online profiles.  Read it, learn it, manipulate it.  Let her know that not only did you read her 
profile, but some of it actually stuck with you.  This WILL impress her.  Appreciate the fact that 
she probably worked all day on the friggin’ thing, no matter how lame it may seem.
The ultimate goal here is to hook her in and cull her from the herd.  Once she’s taken offline and not 
being bombarded by a billion other assholes, she’s yours for the taking.
The Winning Formula
That’s right, you’re fortunate enough to have me hold your desperate hand throughout the entire 
script writing process.  And this is one of the biggest differences between this book and all the 
others...instead of just telling you that you need a winning formula, I’m actually going to give you the 
winning formula.  So let’s dive right into writing the opening script, shall we?  We will begin with:
INTRODUCTION
[Be sure to repeat her online name]  
[Explain why you are contacting her – and none of that U R PRTY or You have a 
beautiful soul bullshit.  Think outside the box and have fun with it.  She already knows 
you want a date with her, so make it creative.]
CONNECTION PARAGRAPH 1
[Repeat what she said, but relate it to a personal experience of your own. Sure, this 
can be a bit obvious, but if you’re playful about it that won’t matter.]
CONNECTION PARAGRAPH 2
[This is where reading her profile will really pay off.  Incorporate something from her 
profile in your message, but not in a completely obvious or creepy manner.  Use this 
time as an opportunity to tell her a brief story about yourself.  The story should reflect 
how damn interesting you are and why she should want to take time out of her day to 
continue talking to you.]
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online

106
Chapter 8 - How To Write A Killer Script
[End this with a question.  This will inspire a response. And it should be obvious by 
now that I’m NOT talking about a question like: So will you date me now?]
CALL HER TO ACTION
[Stress to her that your time is limited without being a douchebag about it.  Girls have 
a habit of making online friends with men, and never meeting up with them.]
[Continue to try to engage her interests in this call to action]
[The goal is to cull her from the herd!  Move everything along at a quick pace.  You’re 
busy, and don’t want to waste your time.]
SIGN OFF
[It’s important to finish off with your real name and to not provide her with any further 
contact details such as your phone number or email address. Avoid lengthy goodbyes.  
Keep it simple.]
Let me show you an example of piecing it together here:
Her Profile: {WaterVirgin}-  24, loves to cook, enjoys fine dining, interested in 
learning how to water ski, and loves to travel.
Your scripted response:
[Introduction]: Hello WaterVirgin,
[Introduction/why]: I see that you love to cook and travel, and 
that you’re fond of fine dining.  Me too!
[Connection Paragraph 1]: One of my favorite restaurants is 
Lumiere.  Have you ever been there?  It’s a bit expensive, so I 
only get out to it once or twice a year.  If you ever do get a 
chance, try the lobster bisque.  It is just to die for!  Just the 
thought of it is making me hungry.
[Connection Paragraph 2]: I just got back from a really nice 
vacation in Mexico.  It’s quickly becoming one of my favorite 
places.  But I guess I’m just a sucker for the sun.  Do you 
travel often?  What’s your favorite place of all time?
[Call to Action]: I’m at work right now, so I have to keep this 
short.  Are you up to meet this weekend?
[Sign Off]: Kris
Let me break this down for you and explain what the hell I just did.  But before I do, I need you to 
understand one simple concept:  You don’t have enough of her time to waste your words.  Everything 
you say, every single word must be loaded with subtext, meaning, and purpose.  Every word must 
count and every word must be designed to elicit her response.
Introduction:  I addressed her by her online name (I’ll use her Real Name once she provides it).  
This tells her that I’ve most likely read her profile, or at least enough of it to know her online name.  
You’d be surprised at how many guys will send her some canned bullshit like Hi and no name after 
it.  They simply cut and paste that shit in and she knows it.  I continue by identifying WHY I’ve just 
contacted her:  likes to cook, travel, and fine dine...and so do I.  Again, this says that I’ve read her 
The Dating Commando

107
Chapter 8 - How To Write A Killer Script
profile and simultaneously identifies that we have common interests.
Connection Paragraph 1:  I creatively repeated what she said in her profile by relating it to my own 
personal experiences.  She likes fine dining and my favorite restaurant is a fine establishment called 
Lumiere.  
I followed up by immediately asking her a question.  I don’t really give a shit if she’s eaten there 
before and chances are that I’m not going to take her there any way.  However, what I am doing is 
baiting her into a conversation.  There’s only 4 possible responses: 1) she has, 2) she hasn’t, 3) she’s 
never heard of it, or 4) completely ignore the question.  
I’ve also identified a possible first date:  Lumiere’s restaurant.  Simultaneously, I’ve made it very 
clear that I’m not some douche who invites every girl he meets there.  I’ve also made the location 
very special and unique to us.  It’s a place I don’t go to often, it’s a fine dining establishment - just 
like what she likes, and it’s expensive.
I’ve closed the paragraph by very subtly suggesting that she’ll have to work to get my attention by 
suggesting that the next time she’s there, she try the lobster bisque.  Note that I didn’t say “if I take 
you” or “if we end up dating”?  Every jackass on the Internet has already said this to her to kiss her 
ass.  I want her to be left with the impression of uncertainty.  I want her to work at capturing my 
attention.  Ideally, I want her to ask me out to Lumiere.
Bonus points if you’ve noticed that I also ended the paragraph with a sense of urgency.  The thought 
of the lobster bisque and Lumiere is making me hungry...as in right now.
Connection Paragraph 2:  Again, I’ve reinforced that I’ve read her profile.  She likes to travel and 
so do I.  I’ve told her a very short, albeit interesting story about myself that should serve to bait her 
even further into conversation:  I just got back from a really nice vacation in Mexico.  It’s quickly 
becoming one of my favorite places.  I’m becoming a sucker for the sun.  
This is pretty interesting stuff.  It’s full of action words (remember our lessons from earlier?) and 
it says a lot about me.  It should inspire her to ask me questions.  Why was it really nice?  Why is it 
becoming one of my favorite places.  What are other places that I’ve been to?  What are the other 
places I’ve been to that are comparative to the Mexico experience?  
At the same time I’ve also told her through sub-text that I’m active, I’m out-doorsy, I travel a lot, I’m 
affluent, I’m worldly, and I’m smart.  Isn’t it incredibly interesting how much was communicated with 
so few words?  Now don’t misunderstand me.  She’s not going to conciously break down my message 
like this.  However, subconsciously, it will all have clicked.
I closed the paragraph by asking her two more questions.  It’s not that I really give a damn about 
how often she travels or what her favorite place is.  However, I do need to engage her in conversation 
and I don’t expect her to do all the work.  In fact, I’ve just made it really easy for her to respond to 
me and I’ve given her a lot to talk about and all of it is about her (Remember that I told you that 
chicks really dig talking about themselves!).  And I’ve done all of this in context of my message and 
without making her feel as though she’s being interrogated or quizzed.
Call to Action:  This is a great call to action.  I’m letting her know that my time is limited - I’m at 
work, but I made time to contact her.  This will help me to avoid lengthy online chat sessions and 
courtships.  Remember, our goal is to get a date with her and remove her from the online dating 
scene.  The longer she stays online, the greater the number of men who will contact her and the more 
difficult it will become to get her attention.
My call to action tells her that even though I’m busy, I went out of my way to make time for her.  The 
subtext is that I have a job and am therefore stable and worthy of trust.  The subtext also says that 
I’m not online contacting as many women as I possibly can - I selected just her, she’s not merely a 
number to me.

Chapter 8 - How To Write A Killer Script
I’m also trying to keep the action moving at a decent pace.  By asking her if she’s available on the 
weekend, I’ve made my intentions very clear.  I’m not looking for a new BFF, I’m not looking for a 
lengthy online relationship, and I’m not looking to waste time.  She may respond that things are 
moving a little too fast for comfort, or she may respond saying that she’s busy this weekend but will 
suggest a different time, or she may respond by agreeing to meet.  Regardless, she will respond.
Sign Off: The sign off is as simple as it gets.  My name.  That’s it.  No more, no less.  Notice that I 
didn’t include my phone number or a “call me.”
 
Just as an FYI, that particular script netted a 95% response rate.  To be clear, 9.5 
women out of every 10 that it was sent to, responded.  Most responded favorably.
I find that communicating with online dating messaging systems to be a lot more 
difficult than approaching a girl in person, especially considering the sheer volume 
of messages she receives every day.  This is why it’s absolutely IMPERATIVE that 
your messages are different and stand out.
Lucky for you, I have a few more tips that will make communicating with her 
easier and help increase your response rate.  
READ HER PROFILE
Pick out her interests.  Anything stand out in particular?  Does anything irk you or engage you about 
her interests, her dislikes, her family?
READ YOUR PROFILE
It’s always good to review your profile every so often and to review what exactly YOUR interests are.
COMBINE YOUR INTERESTS WITH HERS
When I say this, I do not mean:
“You like ice cream? What a coincidence, I do too!  I’d love to 
take you some time”
Weak.  This email is the correct length, but the content sucks.  If all you really have in common is ice 
cream, at least make up something ridiculous, such as:
“I scream, you scream, we both will be screaming for ice cream in 
the heat this weekend (?) (personal favorite: tin roof sundae).  
What’s your flavor?”
What I mean by combining interest is taking something she likes to do, and combining it with 
something YOU like to do, to come up with something funny, witty, or just plain interesting.  Let’s try 
it out here:
Your interest: Sky diving
Her job: Dental Assistant
“I credit all dental assistants for inspiring my current 
fascination  with  jumping out of planes at high altitudes.  Do 
they still give out those parachute men after kids get their 
cavities filled?”
Your like: Horses

Chapter 8 - How To Write A Killer Script
Her dislike: People who chew with their mouths open
“My horses chew with their mouths open.  I guess you won’t be 
riding with me anytime soon?”
Your like: Metallica
Her like: Metallica
“You know it’s sad but true: I have tickets to Friday’s Metallica 
concert and you don’t.”
Intrigue Her With Your Interests
You can try to mention and hook her in with some interests of your own or little factoids about 
yourself.  Here’s some examples of intriguing her:
“Guess who has a third nipple?”
“I drove to, drank in, and died in San Francisco.  TWICE.”  
“Ever had a 100 foot free fall… down a water fall… with a bear 
chasing after you for your hotdog?”
“Bet you can’t say ‘betchershmugerger’ ten times fast.  But I 
can.”
The key here is to use an intriguing example that isn’t being used to directly boast about yourself.  
Here’s a bad example of intrigue:
“I’m guessing you’ve never talked to a guy who can press 1500 
pounds, huh?”
She’s going to look at that, make a pssssh noise, perhaps toss her hair, and let out an almighty what-
EVER.  Then guess what?  That’s right – that message you obviously spent so much time writing will 
find its way into her virtual trash can.  This takes us to our basic rules:
1)	 	DON’T brag, but DO be honest.  It’s all about picking appropriate information to share. 
The quirkier, the better.  If it’s borderline “socially unacceptable”, however, you may want 
to keep it to yourself (for instance, don’t rave about your comic book collection, or the most 
amount of times you have masturbated in a goddamn day).
2)	 	DON’T be probing, but DO be inquisitive.  This is all about kicking those questions that 
may be a little bit too strong for the first date (how many people have you slept with?  What’s 
your address?) and instead finding ones that will guarantee light-hearted, fun, and simple 
answers.  Let’s say she works with children.  A question such as, “Have you ever taken them 
to the water park on [such and such] street?  I used to love going there as a kid” is light, 
non-threatening, and gives a glimpse into your own childhood.
3)	 	DON’T make fun of her interests, but DO tease her about them.  Some interests aren’t 
very tease-worthy, but most can be turned into a gentle and light hearted joke.  If she likes 
to cook, ask her how many pans she’s ruined, or if she’s ever burned rice – like you have – 
over 10 times.
4)	 	DON’T be a pervert, but DO sexualize when appropriate.  Alright, this applies more to 
when the conversation has progressed beyond your initial contact and scripting.  Read her 
cues: if she’s sexualizing the conversation already, then hey, jump aboard!
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online

110
Chapter 8 - How To Write A Killer Script
5)	 	DON’T be long winded, but DO give some information.  Again, it’s important to 
remember that only a sentence or three is what’s required of you when first making contact, 
whether you are writing to a girl in a live chat environment, messaging her on an online 
dating site, or sending her an email.  Your sentence(s) should contain one or two interesting 
factoids about yourself that leave many questions unanswered.
6)	 	DON’T give her the chance to decide whether or not you two are a good match and 
DO convince her that you are.  Remember that script earlier, asking the woman to check 
out his profile to decide whether or not they’d get along?  Tsk tsk.  This is all about convincing 
her that you two have common interests, chemistry, and will have something to talk about 
when you meet and go on a date.  Do not give her that easy bail out option, because she will 
take it.
7)	 	DON’T send a flirt, but DO be a flirt.  This goes for those websites that have the capability 
of having singles send “flirts” to each other, or “roses”, or “smiles” or whatever other useless 
gimmicky bullshit they’ve added to try and “enhance” their site.  This shit is for pussies.  
Seriously.  REAL men will send a REAL message, not some little token to show they’re 
interested.  This crap is the equivalent to you driving by a woman on the street and honking 
your horn, only to never speak to or see her again. 
Got a good idea of how to put a script together?  Good.  Here are some more examples of real 
messages sent to one of my female research profiles that demonstrate how NOT to do it:
From:   *** 
Subject: Nice 	
 
	
   So Passion is it for you. So what are some of your passions?? 
I have passion for sunny winter days in mexico at nice beaches. 
I have passion to Love and be loved. To see you from across the 
room and know you want to be in my arms. PASSION. Hugs Darryl
“Passion!”  I’m not going to poke fun at his grammar so much, since I suspect English is NOT his 
first language, but this is too much.  Poor Darryl, I should write him back and see if he has had any 
success yet, outside of buying a few pounds of passion fruit..
Here’s another one that perplexes me:
From:   *** 
Subject: Hello 	
 
  
Hi,
I really enjoyed reading your profile.
Seemingly very genuine and real.....and refreshingly so!!?? 
...... but of course, what do I know?? Kidding!
Would you be interested in talking (whatever that looks like to 
you??)...... I would!
I hope your weekend was fun!
Cheers,
Mark
He’s saying she seems genuine and real – but she doesn’t even exist!  Then you’re… kidding?  Huh?  
See, it’s these stabs at humor that force me to tell you to re-write your script ‘til you have that humor 
shit down right, or to just give up on trying to be a funny guy.

Chapter 8 - How To Write A Killer Script
He invites her to “talking” and then adds the ridiculous “whatever that looks like to you”.  Talking is 
talking.  Don’t confuse her by suggesting it could look like something else.  This guy’s a head case.   
You do NOT want to come across like this.
Here’s another priceless script that obviously shows that he read NOTHING about “me” (or my female 
fake persona):
From:   *** 
Subject: U r Beautiful! 
	
   simply beautiful.
and simplicity is beautiful.
I am an artist art painter / photographer (my art website:
www.xxxxx-xxxxx.com);
a software developer; an structural engineer; a pro skier and a
sailer / windsurfer. I do many other things.
when I see beauty though the rhythm of my heart changes, world
around silents.
Just beauty, simple beauty.
as an artist I find you exquisit, as a man I am irresistible
attracted. Your feminity captivates me, all shapes and angles of
your presence, the mild fragrance and the movement.
Combining the two of me I’m prompted to paint a picture! But what
is a picture without a soul?
Could I meet the soul of this amazing beauty?
Biff [not his real name]
I understand what this guy is at least TRYING to get at here; he’s trying to look artsy and thoughtful 
and, dare I say, POETIC.  But he’s failing miserably and still proving that not one guy who responded 
actually bothered to read MY profile, or take MY interests into account and sounds like a self absorbed 
asshole who thinks I’m pretty.  And any woman with active brain cells will just shake her head at an 
“artist/engineer/software developer” who can’t spell simple words.  Jeezus!
This is what you’re up against.  After what you have just learned, it shouldn’t be too hard now 
to step up above the competition and stand out like a true champion.  After all, you are a Dating 
Commando!
By the way, remember the question I posed at the beginning of this chapter right after my first test 
script? 
The answer is that I hadn’t read and then referenced her profile.  Not even once.  It was all about 
me.  This made my test script impersonal and ad-like.  No wonder I didn’t get any responses!
Chapter Conclusion
Killer scripts involve not taking up all of the character space available.  Keep it short and sweet.
Your script – though it IS pre-written – should still also involve elements that relate directly to 
her likes and dislikes and interests.
Use proper English!
Always end with a call to action.  You aren’t hanging around this dating site just to talk to her; 
you’re only available to her for a very limited time.

Chapter 9 - How To Respond To Women Successfully
T
he most exciting aspect of online dating is getting a response from a girl.  You log on in the 
morning, frazzled and decaffeinated, and suddenly your whole day is full of sunshine and 
rainbows, your heart skips a beat, you break into a sweat, you want to skip and jump with glee...all  
because you finally see a message from the girl of your dreams.
Excited, you click on the message to open it and…
Nothin’.  Nada.  Zilch. 
Why is she sending you a blank email?
Or you click on the message to open it, and she says:
Thx 4 the email but I really don’t have the time for d8ing rite 
now.  Good luck!
Or…
Get real.
Or…
Sorry, I don’t date guys like you.  Don’t take it personally, I 
just don’t.
Or…or she just doesn’t respond.  EVER.  A day goes by, no reply.  Two, three, four days go by and still 
no reply.  If, after a week, you have not gotten a response from a woman, there is not going to BE a 
response.  It sucks, but it’s true.  This is why you must not place all of your eggs in one basket, to coin 
a phrase.  Do not become emotionally attached to any one girl yet.  Remember: In the online 
world, IT’S A NUMBERS GAME.
So listen up.  Any girl who responds to you in this manner should instantly be 
relegated to the Practice Girl category.  She’s fair game now for you to practice and 
hone your mad Dating Commando skills on.  Your goal is to try different scripts and 
responses to see what will work and what will not.  So let’s check out how to reply 
to these emails…
Blank Email
What…?  Huh?  Now, it is possible that there was some error with the message 
being sent.  Most people would not bother to send a blank email as a reply, 
especially when they can just as easily ignore you.
If you feel upset by this, take a breath.  If you feel excited and hopeful, take a breath.  This is a great 
opportunity to send off perhaps a scripted response, like:
It looks like someone’s shooting blanks!
Intriguing – CHECK!  Funny – CHECK!  Sexualizing – CHECK!  We’ll talk a bit more about sexualizing in 
a few minutes, but this is the type of response you may want to save for future reference.

Chapter 9 - How To Respond To Women (Successfully)
The “Good Luck’s” And “Take Cares”
Rejection hurts, and when freshly rejected, such lines as good luck and take care can seem 
overwhelmingly heartless and offensive.  Good luck…good luck with WHAT?  Women?  You don’t need 
luck!  You can get any woman you want!  Well, except her, so it seems.
I mentioned in the previous chapter how the take care is also a very gentle and kind way of a woman 
telling you to screw off, do not contact her again, she won’t give you the time of day.
Before you even begin to reply, be sure that you are calm.  Turn on your wit, your charm, and be cool.  
Feel complimented that the girl was even courteous enough to get back to you rather than outright 
ignore your existence.  The fact that she replied at all still leaves a slim chance of her responding to you 
again, granted that YOUR response catches her eye.  Look at this as a second God given chance to get 
the girl to talk to you.
Here are some of the ways you can respond to a good luck message:
Hey, thanks for the good luck wish!  You know, my friends call me 
“little lucky” because I’m my own lucky charm.  Why not say hi if 
you want to feel a little lucky for yourself?
See how nicely that was sexualized?
I’m Irish.  I’m my OWN lucky charm!  Why not say Hi if you’re 
feeling a little lucky yourself?
This is not only divulging the smallest of personal information about you, but girls tend to find this sort 
of shit cute and endearing.
Luck’s the last thing I need.  A horse kicked my “rear end” so hard 
as a child that I’m pretty sure the horseshoe is still up there.
Again, this plays on the whole they must have a horseshoe up their ass! phrase about luck.  Girls take 
this sort of stuff to be quick, witty, and funny.
Notice that I’m not trying to be Chris Rock funny?  I’m trying to be a bit charming, a bit gracious, not a 
comedian but light-hearted.  Save the super funny stuff for the next message.
As a response for take care, you can consider a reply along the lines of:
No time to take care right now.  Only have time to take myself to 
the gym/pub/club/Costa Rica/ [any other exciting destination that makes 
you sound fun and will make a woman want to get to know you]
Here are some examples of how not to reply to both good luck and take care:
Take care?  How about I take a shit on your keyboard you *&^%.
I’ll have you know I don’t need luck. =P I don’t need anything, 
especially YOU.  SLUT!! =D
I think you’re the one needing to “take care”, by the looks of your 
pics… eat a salad every once in a while hun.  It’ll do the body 
good. LOL
Who do u think u r.  Honest, who?  U think its funny goin around 
rejectin good guys like me?  Ur going to end up alone.  Sad and 
alone.  Enjoy rottin in ur house alone, future cat lady

Chapter 9 - How To Respond To Women Successfully
This is just useless.  It may feel great at the time, but what are you expecting to gain from this?  She 
will delete your message.  There’s a good chance she deleted it without even READING it in the first 
place!  If she does actually respond to your message, it’s going to be nasty, and believe me, she’ll 
either call you out for being an idiot (true) or she’ll sling more hurtful and ego-killing words back at 
you.  If that appeals to you, you might want to consider placing all future dating posts in the BDSM 
online classifieds.
Anecdotal: I’m working away at the office the other evening.  My buddy is in the next 
room and starts swearing up a storm.  I check in to see what’s wrong.  Turns out he’s 
e-chatting with some chick online and she started to curse him out.  He’s getting ready 
to fire back some of the meanest, nastiest shit when I stop him.  I tell him “look...this 
one may be lost, so why not have some fun with it and see if you can bring it back?  “I 
tell him to sexualize like crazy and suggest the following: With a mouth like that you’re 
really turning me on.  You keep talking like that and I’m going to have to put you over 
my knee and give you a spanking!  And who knows what else might pop up!”
To keep the story short, he got laid that night.  The point is...keep your cool, no 
matter what she says.  Text based conversations are very misleading and easy to 
misinterpret. 
The Girl Who Is Too Busy
By too busy I pretty much mean that this girl does NOT have the time to be screwing around on this 
dating site and wants her Mr. Right to fall into her lap with little-to-no effort on her part.  If you want 
to even be held on contention with this girl, you have to:
•	
put in MAJOR effort
•	
have an AWESOME photo (think firefigher calendar model); and 
•	
Your pitch must be absolutely perfect (for her)
Your chances of achieving a perfect pitch:  0.5%
Want my opinion?  I gotta wonder…if a woman is so busy, what is she even doing on an online 
dating site to BEGIN with?  This is the perfect example of a woman who just wants that perfect man 
and won’t settle for less.  She’s looking for a drop-dead gorgeous man with perfect pecks, drives a 
Maserrati, is charming, witty, worldly, well read, works as a doctor, makes a high 6 digit salary or 
better, can dance, loves the opera, reads to terminally ill children in his spare time, can tame a wild 
horse just using charm alone, has written books, is a budding chef, dresses great...well you get the 
idea.  He’s the man that Disney bases all their fairy tales on.  He’s a fantasy that doesn’t exist.  Expect 
her to still be on this site a decade from now, still wondering where all the great men of the world 
have gone (when she really has just failed to open her eyes a bit more to the possibilities right in front 
of her face).
I say, pass on this one and don’t even bother.  Not even as a practice girl, since you probably won’t 
get any feedback or responses whatsoever.  And besides, this chick has High Maintenance and Drama 
stamped all over her.
The Girl With Bad Grammar
Nothing irks someone more when they receive what appears to be a rejection from a complete 
dimwit.  What I’m talking about are replies like this:
U seem like nice guy, but rly no comon intsts.  enjoy da sun 
2day!
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online

116
Chapter 9 - How To Respond To Women (Successfully)
Seriously, what the fuck?!  Go ahead, LOL to yourself (just do not write it in your reply message!).  
Consider yourself lucky to have avoided this disaster.  You can reply with something like:
You and I would get along great.  I’m a fantastic English tutor.  
My house or yours?
Unless she truly IS stupid, she will either take offense to this or will find it funny.  It’s about an 80/20 
chance, in favor of her being offended.  That being said, you’ve got nothing to lose; why not just GO 
for it?
These messy language responses can get pretty weird:
“You” seem like “A” nice guy, but WE HAVE NO comMon INTERESTS.  
Enjoy THE sun today.  I’m a master of grammar, as well as a 
variety of other subjects. I won’t let my meat loaf if you don’t 
let your participle dangle.
Responses like this often get a grammar lesson from me:
I have a dangling modifier I’d like to squeeze into your sentence.  
Again, sexualize, sexualize, sexualize!  Sometimes these girls are so dull in the brain they won’t pick 
up on your sexual innuendos and won’t take offense.  Personally, I say take the risk.
The Offensive Replies
Most girls have more tact and have been brought up better than to reply to your 
message with a no way, get real, or an ew.  But, if you’re playing the game right 
and contacting enough girls, you will come across those that just have no manners 
at all.  They may even say something far worse than ew, which involves cursing 
and name calling.  Restrain yourself, and laugh at her a bit.  Then come up with a 
witty reply, such as the example I gave you in the previous anecdote:
With a mouth like that, you’re going to find yourself 
bent over my knee and getting spanked
See how her being naughty can turn into a great opportunity to sexualize the 
conversation?  These girls obviously need some taming, so the threat of spanking 
may actually get ‘em off.
You need to go to time out.  It’s on top of my mattress.
Naughty girl!  How should I punish this naughty girl…?
This is not to say that every response can be sexual.  You can try for a bit of humor with a reply like 
this:
My mom warned me about girls like you!  I should be afraid, but 
instead am intrigued.  Is that wrong?
The best way to react to these messages is to behave the complete opposite of how she’s behaving.  
If she’s vulgar and filthy, be kind and polite.  If she’s swearing, don’t you dare use anything that may 
be considered “poor English” in return.
And for God’s sake, avoid responses like:
I know what I can stuff in that mouth to keep it quiet!
NOTE: When 
responding to her, 
be sure to sexualize, 
Sexualize, 
SEXUALIZE your 
message (subtly is 
King!).  I’ll show 
you how in a few 
minutes.

The Girl Who Doesn’t Date A Guy Like You
I hate this sort of reply, because it leaves too many open ended questions:  
A guy like me?  
Like who? 
What is it about me that is so off putting that you won’t give me a chance?  
Do not, under any circumstances, ask these questions of her, no matter how tempting.  These girls 
have a lower success rate of being datable than the filthy mouthed trailer trash above.  Why?  They’ve 
already made up their mind about what they want in a man.  They’ve already decided that they want 
the Prince Charming, the lawyer or the doctor with millions and a Jaguar and a huge house in a gated 
community.  They have not yet been forced to deal with the harsh reality that what they are seeking 
they will never find.
The low success rate with these girls doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t try; it just means that you 
can get a bit more experimental with it and HAVE FUN.  These are the PERFECT Practice Girls!  For 
example:
A guy like me… a guy like me who has 2 tickets to Cirque du 
Soleil this weekend and no date?
Was it the goatee that killed my chances?  I’d consider shaving 
that off for you, given that you shave yours.
The first reply shows clear intentions of what you were planning to do on your date with her, which 
she may really want to do.  But it is also a bit kiss ass.  
The second reply is, again, sexualizing the conversation.  If she takes offense and thinks you’re 
talking about facial hair, correct her:
Darling, I wasn’t talking facial hair...if you know what I mean.  
Saturday work for you?  I have a spare razor.
The Girl Who Doesn’t Reply
So this is a dicey one.  There are two solid reasons why she may not have replied.  The first is that 
she didn’t see your message.  Maybe it got lost in the heap.  Maybe it was deleted without being read.  
Maybe she didn’t have time.  Whatever.  The second is that she either couldn’t be bothered to respond 
(not interested), or she lost track of it (not important enough for her to remember).
Most of the time, I’m going to suggest that you don’t bother contacting any girl who doesn’t have the 
time, respect, or decency to reply to your message.  But if one or two girls have particularly caught 
your interest, and you really want to give it the ol’ college try, then what is there to lose?  Just be sure 
that whatever you say the second time around doesn’t come off cheesy and desperate.  Girls HATE 
that shit.
Before we get into how to reply to the no reply, there are some general rules about replying to 
“The ‘a guy like you’ girl is the perfect 
Practice Girl.  Experiment at will, no 
holds barred!”

Chapter 9 - How To Respond To Women (Successfully)
messages online.  If a girl replies to you (positive or neutral response) within 24 hours, she’s really 
interested and you stand a good chance to get her out on a date.  If she replies within 2 to 3 days, 
she’s still interested, but is hanging back a bit.  This is perfectly fine; just continue on with your witty 
and intelligent banter.  If she hasn’t replied for over a week, she isn’t ever going to, unless her ISP 
has been down for a week and how likely is that?  If you don’t want to throw in the towel just yet after 
those 7 days, re-read her profile and see what she likes.  Pair something up with your own likes or 
dislikes.  And DO NOT repeat what you said in your first message to her.  For example:
When I read that you liked [insert type of music], it reminded me 
of the first time I had to get up on the bar and dance – without 
pants – in Vegas.  Be sure to never wear tightie whities in 
Vegas.  NEVER.
She can then see that you actually did read her profile, and that you have at least ONE interesting 
story to share.  A story like that only makes one think that there must be more to come, and she will 
definitely want to hear it.
Here are some other responses you can give a go:
Funny, I’m eating [insert a favorite food of hers] right now.  
Little tip: try adding a little [insert girl’s name here] to 
really spice things up!
or:
You know, the bar/winery (insert name of bar or winery) serves 
the best [insert her favorite drink here].  Check it out some 
time, and then ask for a “Blow Joe”.  It’s my signature drink and 
don’t you dare say it’s a typo.
You may think it’s necessary to mention the fact that you messaged her a week ago, but it’s not.  
Actually, I’d say it is preferable that you do not mention a thing.  Maybe she was having a bad day 
and checked the little box next to all of her Plenty of Fish, eHarmony, Lavalife, Match.com – whatever 
site – emails from that day and clicked “delete”.  Or maybe she just didn’t like your initial opening line.  
Whatever it is, keep in mind that this chick has received hundreds of emails since yours, and there is a 
very slim chance that she’ll remember who the hell you are the second time around.
If the second time around doesn’t prove successful, you need to let her go.  You aren’t going to get a 
reply, bud.  Move on to the next one.
The Gay Friend Syndrome (GFS)
Before you take offense to me using the word gay, let’s be real here: men who are too friendly 
with women always fall into the all too well-known friend zone.  You, a straight guy, are not even 
recognized as being a heterosexual male.  As far as she’s concerned, you my friend, may as well be 
GAY. 
So how does the Gay Friend Syndrome (to be referred to as GFS from here on) come to fruition?  
Well, let’s say you find a girl online whom you really, REALLY like.  You figure, “Hey, I’ll get close to 
her by being friendly and unintimidating...and when I’m really, really sure we’re clicking and she’s 
comfortable with me, I’ll declare my intentions.”  Sounds like a solid plan, right?  You can get real nice 
and close to her without scaring her off, and then slide yourself right into her arms.  You’ve read her 
profile; you think you have your game on, so now the time has come to send her a message:
Oh my god!  That thing about guys always just dicking around?  
Too true.  Not that I’M like that, but my friends are. I’m always 
lecturing them on it too.  Here’s to hoping we BOTH stop getting 
dicked around!

That’s nice, right?  You think it’s cute.  You think she’ll like it.  And hey, she must have, because she 
actually sent a reply:
Ugh your friends need yu to teach them a lesson!  LOL  I have 
lots of guys I can recommend to take your course if you ever make 
one up!
AWESOME!  This is great, especially since you haven’t gotten any replies for well over a week.  You 
grin to yourself, crack your knuckles, and hunker down over that keyboard to reply.
I’ll definitely make one up. Maybe the community college will let 
me do it?  Hey, you can even come and be a guest speaker.  I 
think we’d make a fantastic duo!
You figure that the reference to you and her being a duo is a witty way to suggest, “LET’S DATE!”  
And, oh dear lord, she replies AGAIN!!  This time:
I’d be so down for that  LOL  just in case you need it, here’s my 
cell  ***-***-****
SCORE!  You actually got her digits!  You could not BE more thrilled.  You contemplate calling...or 
continuing with the safer emailing...or calling...then you remember:  I should call.  Shows that I have 
balls.  Shows I’m a man.  You dial those digits.  You hear it ring.  Then you hear her pick up.
She sounds pleased to hear from you, allaying all your irrational fears and raising your hopes.  You go 
through the formalities:  
Hi, how are you, I’m good, that’s great, bullshitbullshitbullshit.  
Then you crack a joke about needing her to help you with your course planning.  She laughs, says “Of 
course!” and then she drops this bomb on you:
“I’m actually seeing a guy right now who could totally use your 
course!  Ha ha ha He’s off of that website too... you’re, like, 
the one nice guy who’s on there.”
“Uh... oh?” you stutter.  You’re not sure how to react here.  Seeing a guy... from the same site?  
“When did you start seeing him?”
“He messaged me two days ago.  We met up for coffee, and though 
I LIKE him, he’s totally got a bit of a bad side to him.  We’re 
meeting up again on Thursday night, I’m hoping it’ll go more 
smoothly then.”
Your heart, soul, and every other body part sinks.  This guy messaged her after YOU messaged her, 
and HE got the date?  And he’s “bad”?  AND she’s giving him another chance?
Fuck that!
You should be glad, however, that you realized you were in the friend zone before you invested any 
more time in the relationship that you thought you had somehow masterfully pieced together with 
your shitty dating skills.
Recognizing The Signs of GFS
•	
You have found a girl you truly like and decide you do not want to scare her off
•	
You become her friend with the hope of getting closer to her

Chapter 9 - How To Respond To Women (Successfully)
•	
You avoid anything that is remotely sexual or relationship-esque (i.e. you 
avoid advancing physical movements, any implications of you two really being 
together through email and speech, etc.) 
•	
You want to be sure that she is 100% comfortable around you 
•	
Your “hang outs” involve shopping, bitching, therapy sessions, and even coffee 
dates that involve therapy sessions.
•	
You hang out with each other every day, you have fun together and do stuff that 
you’d normally do with your buddies or hers – watch movies, watch Football, 
play videogames, WHATEVER.
•	
You talk every day, usually even MULTIPLE TIMES during the day.  You both 
even contact each other at work to share some sort of silly or interesting event 
that happened to you within the past hour.
•	
You’re fun, witty, interesting, and she can’t go an hour without missing you, but 
without ever moving things toward sex/romance.
•	
She tells you that you’re her BEST BUDDY and then…
!!!BOMBSHELL!!!  
Why can’t all the other guys in her life be more like you?
!!!BOMBSHELL!!! 
 “So and so” is really interesting, can you help her get a date with him?
!!!BOMBSHELL!!!  
She just had the best date of her life last night and she wants to tell you all about him!
!!!BOMBSHELL!!!
You’re a guy – can you give her pointers on what she may be doing wrong when giving blow jobs?  
“This guy I’m seeing just doesn’t seem to like them as much as my ex boyfriend”
(The answer to that one is to “use less teeth”, by the way)
Why Does This Happen
Okay, I’ve read tons of dating books, and they all stress that you should make the girl feel 
COMFORTABLE.  I think it’s that kind of bullshit that’s leaving a lot of you poor saps in the friend-
zone.  You read bad advice, or the book does not fully explain when to cut off that “LET’S MAKE HER 
COMFORTABLE AROUND ME” crap.  Hell, an old sweater can make her comfortable and has a better 
chance of going to bed with her than you do!
You have been working so damned hard to make her your FRIEND that, well, you’ve actually 
succeeded (maybe you should write a book about how to make friends with the opposite sex - oh 
wait, no one would BUY it).  I bet if you asked her to get into a hot bubble bath with you and light 
some candles she would completely oblige, but there would be NO sexy times.  Hell, she’ll let you see 
her butt-naked and still make absolutely no advancements towards you (if you tried to kiss her, by 
the way, she’d freak the fuck out, so don’t do it!).  You’re her best gay friend.  Though you may not 
literally BE gay, as far as she’s concerned, you have a vagina.
What NOT To Do
As I mentioned up there, most guys who realize that they are in the friend zone quickly try to 
correct the problem by going right on ahead and kissing the girl, thinking that they are asserting their 
heterosexuality and clearing the air.
DON’T FUCKING DO IT!!!
Other geniuses, rather than taking the kissing approach, lay out a game plan  to profess their 
undying love and attraction to the girl at some perfect moment looming in the near future.  They 
The Dating Commando

121
Chapter 9 - How To Respond To Women Successfully
ignorantly assume that she’ll find this romantic, and think she’ll swoon as she’s being swept off her 
feet...
DON’T FUCKING DO IT!!!
Other guys will take the more direct route and straight up tell the girl:  HEY, I’M NOT GAY.
DON’T FUCKING DO IT!!!
Girls treasure having a male confidante, which is exactly what you have become (congratulations, 
dumbass).  They have loved having your company, your wit, your funny stories, all given without any 
threat or stress of there being a relationship.  You’re just the friend and you’ve taken yourself out of 
her dating pool.  Coming clean about your intentions will be just about as creepy 
as her brother confessing his love for her. 
Consider how betrayed she’ll feel.  She’ll feel that you’ve being lying to her, 
and she (along with her bitchy friends who have been jealous of her new-found 
friendship with you) will quickly label you as the biggest creep stalker to ever have 
walked the planet.
And they will tell everyone about it.  EVERYONE.  There’s a good chance they will 
also try to destroy your online persona with tactless messages and accusations.  
Remember. “Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.”  Forget land mines.  Forget 
dynamite.  Forget those bombs that you see in movies that always have about 5 
seconds to disarm (Red wire?  Blue wire?  Fuck it, go for the green wire).  Women 
are a ticking time bomb that, more often than not, cannot be disarmed.  Oh…you may THINK you 
have, they may be smiling at you and pretending everything’s okay, but within days, months or years 
they come back full force and really kick you in the ass.  
Curing Gay Friend Syndrome
Before we go any further, you must understand one thing:  You may not be able to fix the GFS.  It’s a 
sad but true fact.  Once you’ve fucked yourself over on this one, you will probably remain fucked.  It’s 
like a wicked case of the clap.  Once you’ve got it...you’ve got it for good.
If you are planning to try and get yourself GFS-free, then you first must recognize that the longer 
you stay trapped in the GFS zone, the more difficult it becomes to escape it.  Repeat after me:
The longer I stay trapped in the Gay Friend Zone, the more difficult it becomes to 
escape it!
Turn Up The Heat!
Should you seek escape, it is important that you start slowly - and I do mean SLOWLY - begin to 
sexualize the conversations.  Sexualizing the conversations must be a very gradual process; otherwise 
you risk completely creeping her out.  Once she’s creeped out (which is what tends to happen) you 
may as well throw in the towel and go watch some porn at home.
The goal here is to make the line between gay friend and potential lover increasingly fuzzy, but doing 
it so slowly that it is not blatantly obvious.  You want her to wake up one day and think, “Hey... that 
Rob is kinda hot.  Too bad he’s gay”.  If you work your flirting and sexualizing skills just right, this will 
turn into, “Hey, that Rob is kinda hot.  Maybe I should try something with him... see how it goes.”
You’re probably feeling rather lost about what kind of flirting skills to use.  Here’s an example for you:

Chapter 9 - How To Respond To Women (Successfully)
Say you go out for dinner, or for coffee, or are just hanging out.  Pick a point when she’s walking up 
the stairs, or even just walking in front of you, and make a comment about how she has an absolutely 
perfect ass:
“Wow, I can’t believe I never noticed this before.  You have the most perfect ass I’ve 
ever seen”.
She will probably respond with a laughing, “Whu-hu-huuut?” since there’s no way in hell she 
expected this from you (although she may have heard it from all the other guys who tried to pick her 
up...see where I’m going with this?).  I’d then add:
“If we weren’t friends, I’d be so tempted to take you – right here, right now.”
After that, be sure to keep the conversation completely sex-free for AT LEAST 30 MINUTES.  AT 
LEAST 30 MINUTES.  I will stress this again: LEAVE OUT ANY SEXUALIZING FOR AT LEAST 30 
MINUTES.  She has heard your comment, and her mind is still digesting and processing what you just 
said. She may not know what to do with it yet, since it’s coming from her gay friend, so give her some 
time with it.  If you come on too strong, you’ve completely blown your chances.
I Love Pussy!
The next step to take is to let her know that you are interested in dating WOMEN.  Since you were 
playing the “I’m nice and innocent” card to begin with, I bet you didn’t express interest in any other 
woman but her (which she then mistook as friend interest).  This is also very tricky, and takes a lot of 
skill, timing and planning.
A good way to start is to sexualize your body language. Give her visual cues that reflect romantic 
interest in her without being overly obvious.  Some visual cues you can give are:
•	
Extended eye contact
•	
Smiling  and laughing softly at her jokes while retaining eye contact
•	
“Flicking” your eyes quickly at an area of her body (breasts, legs, lips) and 
smiling, licking your lips, or biting your lip (remember: this must be executed 
within 1 second or less and you can’t be fucking CREEPY about)
•	
Subtle, accidental touching
•	
Light head tilting (don’t tilt your head too much or too often - this may only 
verify her suspicions that you are actually gay)
Remember these visual cues, because women also give off the same visual cues 
when they are interested.  When you notice that she’s starting to give you these 
cues too – and only when you notice it – start mentioning more often that you are 
interested in women; verbalize your observations on other women (their dress, 
their ass, legs, whatever).  Once you are ABSOLUTELY SURE she’s expressing 
some sexual interest in you, then drop this bomb on her:
“…I wish I could find a girl just like you.  Will you help me?”
SNAP!  Right in the face!  This embeds an idea in her head, you see.  You have 
stated that you like her in a relationship sort of way, as you are seeking a girl just 
like her to date.  You have stated sexual interest in other women and now you drop the bomb that 
of all those women, she is the one you’re most interested in – without having come out and actually 
saying it. 
Again, be sure that you execute this move only when you are sure that she has taken a notice that 
you’re a straight man who likes the va-gee-jay.  This is the point where she will most likely hit the 
road, or stick with you for the long haul, so it’s worth waiting to drop it on her.
TIP: To really amp 
up the jealousy a 
notch, have her 
introduce you to 
her friends and 
then start flirting  
with them big 
time.

Chapter 9 - How To Respond To Women Successfully
Now let’s say she actually bites at this opportunity and says, “Sure, I’ll help you!” then definitely 
run with it.  Allow her to help you find women!  Hell, who knows who you may find.  The goal here 
isn’t to use her as your personal matchmaker, however; the goal here is to make her jealous while 
simultaneously emphasizing that none of the women she finds lives up to herself.  If you think it won’t 
happen, give it time.  The jealousy will build.
When you have built up what you feel to be a sufficient amount of jealousy, it’s time to strike.  The 
important thing to recognize here is when she is JEALOUS ENOUGH to abandon all thoughts or hopes 
of you being gay.  You also don’t want to go so far as to really piss her off.  Again, read her body cues:  
Is her body language telling you that she’s interested in you?  When she’s being nasty or mean to you 
(playfully or not) is she still playing with her hair?  Are her feet still pointed towards you even when 
she says that she really has to go somewhere and leave you?  Also be on the lookout for comments 
like this when you mention other girls:
“She’s way too fat for you.  You deserve someone hotter.”
“Oh my god, her?  No.  You have really bad taste… except you’re my friend, so you 
must have SOME taste…”
“I’m hotter than THAT”
“Her breasts are so saggy, man.  Seriously, look at how perky they SHOULD be” 
[motions to her own breasts, or whatever body party of the other girl she’s insulting] 
When a girl is comparing herself to other women, and forcing you to CHECK HER OUT, that means 
she’s interested.  She wants you to take notice.  She wants you to recognize that she is better than 
whatever other chick your eyes were just on.  She wants YOU.
Okay, okay, so back to going in for the kill.  Once you are SURE she’s interested in you sexually, you 
have to share this revelation that’s, well...been bothering you for a while now… and that has come to 
you as a complete shock (bullshit; but act the part).  What’s the revelation?  It goes a little something 
like this:
“I have just… I need to talk to you about something.  Okay…sorry, I haven’t slept all 
night.  I was out on a date with [whoever you’re seeing], as you know, and I just… 
I can’t help but notice how much she’s like you.  And then all I think about is… well, 
YOU, and not her at all.  Is that weird?  It’s like… it’s like you and I should be together.  
It’s totally fucked up, because you are my closest friend and I love you as my friend, 
but then I just… I want to be with you all of the time… you know?  It’s really confusing 
and frankly, I just don’t understand it.”
DISCLAIMER:  It’s very hard to get out of the GFS.  It’s especially hard to get out of the GFS if you 
do not execute what you are going to say to her with genuine sincerity.  You know best how this girl 
can take news; be sure to use that to your advantage and don’t use the above scripted response word 
for word, as I’m sure you definitely were planning to do.  Asshole.
At this point, it’s either sink or swim.  Unfortunately, you are leaving your future together completely 
in her hands at this point, but you know what?  No matter what happens, be proud of how far you 
made it.  You may lose a very good friend by doing this too, which hurts, but let’s be real: if you never 
took this chance, you’d be jerking off to thoughts of this woman until the day you die.  Worse, you’d 
have those flogging sessions dampened by imagining the sounds she’s making as some other guy puts 
the blocks to her.  You’d continue to think of her as the one who got away or whatever that bullshit is, 
and no one should have to live with that on their mind and heart.  If it happens, move on. 
If she goes for it, consider yourself very – VERY – lucky.  Congrats, bro!

How To Stay Out Of The GFS “Comfort” Zone
Like I mentioned earlier, too many dating books are about creating some sort of comfort zone, but 
really, if you don’t play it right and slip up, this will only toss you right into the hellish GFS zone that, 
4 out of 5 times, you will not be able to get out of (the odds are probably even slimmer, I’m just being 
generous).
Cut off the comfort feeling before she gets too cozy.  Cut it off early.  Imagine her coming into your 
office for an interview, and then you needing to excuse yourself within 5 minutes.  Yes, you only have 
5 minutes to impress this girl the first time you speak or instant message, chat, or phone.  You must 
create false time constraints, as I have mentioned in previous chapters.  This way, you have control 
over the conversation.  
If you are speaking to her in person, begin rocking on your heels to show her in a non-verbal way 
that you do need to go.  Then drop lines like this:
“Sorry, I’m only here for a really short time for my friends’ birthday, but I’d like to 
continue this…”
Online it’s even easier to create fake reasons to have to go.  For instance:
Okay, I only have a minute here, but get this…
Or
Whoa, time flies. I’m going to have to head out of here in a 
second, but something I wanted to mention is...
Or
Sorry, I have to leave in a couple, but I wanted to know your 
opinion on…
If it’s your first time talking to the girl, you can make a sly attempt to get her digits.  Tell her you will 
talk to her later and ask if it’s okay to call her (then get her number).  And be sure to contact her the 
next day.
On that note, it is important to get her phone number AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  One of the number 
one reasons why online guys get thrown to the GFS wolves is because they chat for too long.  Once 
you do that, she’ll continue to message you throughout the entire night about complete bullshit with 
you both basically running in nice chitty-chatty circles.  Oh, you think you’re 
getting somewhere by sharing your childhood stories and the events of the day 
with her, but really she’s just seeing you as someone who’s really cool and fun to 
talk to.  The longer this goes on, the less you become someone she’d be interested 
in dating.
By asking for her phone number, you’re taking initiative.  This is a sign of interest 
in a woman.  This is a cue that YOU are a strong man who has a romantic or 
sexual interest in her.  She will respect you all the more for it; believe me – even 
if she is shooting you down in the end.  Besides, do you really want to waste 
weeks of your time only to find out that she’s not interested in giving you a phone 
number but would like to remain online friends?  Fuck that.
Lastly and most importantly, you can stay right out of the GFS zone by sexualizing 
the conversation up front.  This blatantly states that you have no interest in being 
the girls’ friend.  You want her body.  You find her attractive and you desire a romantic relationship – 
To avoid the 
GFS zone, you 
need to take 
control.  Use false 
time constraints 
to control the 
conversation and 
sexualize as soon 
as you can.

whether it lasts a day, week, or a year is up to you – but you still desire a ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP 
with her and NOT A FRIENDSHIP.  A woman would have to be completely obtuse to think that a gay 
man is using sexual innuendos with her.
VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:  Look, there is nothing wrong at all with being her 
friend, as long as you and she are happy with the arrangement.  Let’s face it: our 
lady friends are often way more interesting than most of our beer swilling, football 
watching guy friends anyway.  Besides, she’ll have plenty of female friends that 
she’ll be more than happy to set you up with.  And she’ll go out of her way to keep 
you in line and to keep you sharp and datable.  Hell, she may even help you find 
the perfect match!
And with that, we go to the next and perhaps most important segment…
Sexualizing The Conversation
Okay, I’ve been talking a lot about sexualizing the conversation and doing my best to stress how 
important it is.  So here’s the big moment you’ve been waiting for!
Sexualizing the conversation (definition): Flirting, amping up the sexual charge; 
using cute jokes, innuendos and or implications to reveal your true sexual intentions 
with a person in a subtle, covert but playful way.
I will start this segment off with a real-life conversation that has taken place more than once in 
random bars across the country:
Waiter: Can I get you something from the bar?
Me: Yes, a Tom Colins please.
The Date: What’s a Tom Colins?
Me: (lean in and say it under my breath, playfully)  Back in my University days, we 
used to call it panty remover (little laugh)
The Date: (laughs)  I’ll have one of those too!
Immediately the intentions are set – and hell, now I know where her mind is too!  Nice to know she 
wants her panties removed.  If that’s not inspiration to learn how to sexualize a conversation, I don’t 
know what is.
A good follow up to further sexualize the conversation is something along the lines of, “Jeez, promise 
you won’t take advantage of me later” or even say something like “too bad I didn’t wear my panties... 
wait, did I already have this drink today?!”
Sexualizing the conversation, if you’re not already a bit of a dirty pervert, may be giving you a 
headache, but fear not.  It will become completely effortless and natural to you by the end of this 
book, or by the end of your first wildly successful date!
We will start with exploring why you will be sexualizing the conversation.  In case it hasn’t been 
explained enough, listen up.  Sexualizing the conversation has one sole purpose: to make the girl 
think about sex while talking to you.  That’s it!  The whole point is to get her fantasizing about sex 
with you and then slowly to turn her on and increase the horniness factor without YOU actually being 
explicit about having sex with her.  To repeat:
While there’s 
nothing wrong with 
being friends, your 
ultimate goal is to 
create a romantic 
relationship.

In her mind: you = sex
Another example:  I was out with a gorgeous Spanish lady who ordered a Penne Alfredo dish.  Being 
the cultured asshole I am, I say: 
Me: Isn’t penne Spanish for penis?
Her: (laughs) Actually, yes it is!  
Me: (laugh very playfully while reassuringly and gently touching her hand) Well, we 
didn’t need to come here if that’s what you were interested in!  I have wonderful 
penne at home!
Remember in the GFS segment I told you to sexualize and then leave it alone for 30 minutes.  A 
similar rule applies here.  Sexualize and then let her respond.  Depending on where she takes it, this 
will determine where you can go next.  Fortunately for me, my Spanish lady friend had an even more 
warped sense of humor than I did.  The rest of the night was full of highly charged sexual inneundo 
that led to some of the best sex I’ve ever had!
Guys always ask me when it’s cool to start sexualizing the conversation with a girl.  Here’s a couple of 
quick tips:
Tip #1: Watch the girls’ body language.  If she seems closed and stand-offish, do 
not start the conversation with sexual connotations.  This also goes for online.  If the 
girl’s profile shows her as a camp counselor who loves her family and her cat and 
her favorite show is some televangelist crap (unlikely, but you never know) then do 
not start with the sexy stuff.  If she is religious, do not start with the sexy stuff – but 
definitely do it as soon as she allows you to.  Warm her up to it first.
If she seems a bit wilder and is a party girl, ease in to sexualizing the conversation 
immediately.
Tip #2: If the girl starts off sexualizing the conversation with YOU, then you know it’s 
on.  Have fun trying to keep up with that untamed mistress!
How To Sexualize Using Role Reversal
Role reversal is an excellent way of sexualizing the conversation innocently, because you’re really 
turning the tables and making your dirty and filthy ideas seem like they are actually HER ideas.  
Role reversal also helps elevate your status and value in the eyes of the girl without you really having 
to do a shitload of work.  Below are some good examples of how you can practice role reversal:
“To really get her motor running, sexualize 
the conversation and then let her respond.  
She’ll let you know where you can take it 
next.”

“Are you trying to get me drunk?” (say if she offers to meet you in a bar – this one’s 
great)
“Don’t think you’re gonna get something just because you’re buying me a drink”
“Are you always this fast?”
“I don’t want to rush into things…”
“Whoa, whoa, hey… that question’s a bit too close to the heart for me.  I don’t want to 
get hurt; I need to build up some comfort and trust with you first.”
“I don’t do that on a first date!”
If she makes a sexually suggestive proposition:
“I’m not that kind of guy.  Do I look like that kind of guy?” (said with a smile)
“Before we do that, I want to get to know you better first.
“Oh, you just want me for my body.”
“I know, I know… you girls just want ONE THING from me.”
“Are… are you GROPING me?”
“Hands off the merchandise!  The cow doesn’t give the milk away for FREE!”
“I wore my old boxers tonight just to be sure that nothing happens.”
“You see that guy over there?  Yeah… he looks PERFECT for you!”
“Buy me a drink and we’ll see from there.”
“Pfft… if you’re lucky…”
Innuendos And Double Entendres
Double entendre is your friend!  Just in case you don’t know, this is the fancy French way of saying 
“double meaning.”  The great thing about double entrendre is that you can always play the innocent 
and claim she’s taking the meaning out of the spirit intended.  They can also be a lot of fun, quite 
funny, and great conversation openers.
Here’s some examples of sexy double entendre:
Lauren Bacall to Humphrey Bogart: “You know how to whistle, don’t you? You just put 
your lips together and…blow.” (from the movie To Have and Have Not)
or:
I’ve never come across such white teeth before!

or:
One of my life’s goals is to take a tour of Lake Titicaca.
or:
I hear that Voyager 2 is probing Uranus.  God, I wish I had thought of it!
There is really nothing better than coming up with witty or corny sexual innuendo and double 
entendre.  Some fun ones that come up in every- day living are:
“Excuse me sir, would you like for me to butter your muffin?”
(A waitress said this to me this morning)
“I’ll show you the biggest piece of wood you’ve ever seen!”
(Innocent & passionate hardware store merchant)
“Could you empty your junk into my box?”
(Thrift store worker telling me where to put my… “junk”)
“Just let me put my wiener in your bun here…”
(Hot dog salesman)
“Do you see how hard and firm this is?”
(Mattress saleswoman)
These are fun, show a sense of humor and are also relatively harmless, unless you have a prude on 
your hands.
Double entendres usually illicit an Ooo! mocking response from the listener, or winking, or nudging.  
Some things to be on the lookout for to make sexual innuendos and double entendres towards are:
Food: sausages, cucumbers, bananas – basically anything phallic shaped.  Any food 
that can be “stacked” is also a good start (think pancakes).
Architectural designs: arches, erections
Engineering: knobs, gear sticks, screws, any engine or mechanical parts that squeak 
or do not work when not appropriately “lubricated” (greased).
Computers & Electronics:  Hard drive, floppy disk, disk drive, RAM, plugs.
I’m not going to do all the work for you, but here’s an example of using food to sexualize the 
conversation.  We were standing at a carnival concession stand when she mentioned she wanted a 
pretzel.  
ME: Do you like the soft pretzels or the hard ones?
HER: I like them hard
ME: Mhmm, I bet you DO
I once struck up a conversation in a coffee shop with a girl and had plans on ordering a tea.  I asked 
her what she was getting:

GIRL: Coffee
ME: Yeah?  Do you like it hot?  Or do you like it cold?
Putting It All Together
You definitely don’t want to dive immediately into the hardest and sexiest depths of sexualization.  
Ease into it with some lead-in questions, such as:
*	 Do you enjoy doing things spur-of-the-moment?
*	 If we were to play Truth or Dare, you look like you’d choose “dare”…
*	 Do you consider yourself to be spontaneous?
Ask this while moving in closer to her, decrease the barrier zone, and hold her eyes with yours, just 
be sure not to appear as if you’re leering at her.  If she says no and moves away, try your tactic a bit 
later, she probably hasn’t warmed up to you enough yet.  Read her body language for hints and clues 
as to when and whether she is receptive.
If she says yes, take her up on something that is spur of the moment.  Call her to action!  Asking for 
a kiss is generally acceptable.  When you do this, be sure to take her hand, draw 
her in even closer to you, and make your proposition:
“Oh yeah?  Then lay your best kiss on me.  Right here, right now.  I dare 
you!”
If she doesn’t’ take you up on it, don’t force the issue.  You can playfully express 
your disappointment with an “aww”, or you can playfully call her a chicken, or you 
can give her a friendly shrug and move on to something more fun.
TIP: If she seems interested, but you aren’t getting that “kissing” vibe about her, 
comment on how wonderful she smells – this includes commenting on the scent of 
her hair.
Now guys...I have to caution you here.  If you’re not careful about how you do this, if you don’t make 
it playful and innocent enough, you will come across as a creepy major asshole.  Think about it this 
way...if some Dude came on to you with this, how would you react?  Yeah, that’s what I thought.
If she goes for the kiss, don’t force another one on her.  Don’t encourage a make-out session; wait 
a good 5 to 15 minutes before striking up a similar conversation that will encourage her to become 
physical with you.
After kissing, it’s all about moving up toward a wonderful sexual crescendo!  You can either do this  
physically by caressing the back of her neck while kissing, gently touching her breast, or verbally by 
expressing your physical intentions with her.
Common Sexualizing Errors
One of the biggest mistakes that guys make when they are trying to sexualize their rather PG 
experience with a woman is to use cute or sexy nicknames.  This includes but is not exclusive to:
*	 Baby (ICK!)
*	 Babe
*	 Sweetie
*	 Darlin’
*	 Hun
Be careful when 
putting it all 
together.  If you’re 
not playful and 
“innocent” enough, 
you’ll come across 
as some sort of 
creep or weirdo.

Chapter Conclusion
The purpose of sexualizing is to make sure that your intent is clear: you do not want to be 
friends with her; you want to be her lover
You want her to think about having sex with you
Sexual innuendos give you an “in” with a built in “out”.  If she mistakes what you say as being 
“sexual” in nature, though it’s not blatantly so, you can blame her for interpreting it that way.  
She has the dirty mind; not you.  But tell her this in a joking way.
Be sure to deliver all lines with a sense of innocence and naivety.  Otherwise you will come off 
looking like a scumbag like all of the other idiots out there.
“Cute” nicknames are not cute.  Don’t even consider using cutesie nicknames until you and she 
build up a rapport.
*	 Pumkin
*	 Sweetie
What is absolutely horrible about using these nicknames is that they give a girl a sense that you are 
trying to dominate and control her.  If you’ve been addressing a woman as “baby”, “darling”, “hun”, 
etc., this is where you fail.  No, it’s not cute; it’s not endearing; it’s demeaning.  Lose it or lose her.
I have to mention this next one, because the phrase alone has been enjoying great success lately.  
The phrase is:
“That’s what she said!”
Okay, there is a popular TV show on right now where the main character tends to follow up many 
conversations with a “that’s what she said.”  That character is also made out to be an idiotic lamewad 
who enjoys very little success with the ladies.  Do you want to be that lamewad who enjoys very little 
success with the ladies?  I don’t think so.  
Don’t TOUCH the “That’s what she said” unless you’re clearly using it in a mocking manner.  
While we’re on the subject, be aware of overusing ANY particular phrase, you know what I’m saying.  
Even if the phrase has been in common use, you know what I’m saying.  It can really grate on the 
listener to keep hearing it over and over, you know what I’m say- BITCH SLAP! – ow!

Chapter 10 - Meeting In Person
M
eeting a woman in person is a lot of fun and doesn’t need to be a daunting task.  I figured 
that this chapter was required, just in case you want to make the leap from online dating to 
picking up women in person.  
I’m going to show you where to meet a woman, the attitude that YOU need to have to approach a 
woman, how to spot the one you want to take home and how to work your actual approach.  I’ll also 
explain the differences between long term and short term relationships with the ladies, where applicable.
Before we go any further, let’s talk about telling the difference between a girl who’s looking for a quick 
lay and a girl who is looking for her Prince Charming.
The Hook Up
So you’re sitting at the bar, checking out the scene, and you see her - that hot chick that you’d love 
to see leaving your house at 3am after a good romp in the sack.  FANTASTIC.  Okay, keep an eye on 
her for the next ten to thirty minutes without her noticing you.  If she approaches any guy on her own 
accord, it’s an indication that she’s looking for a quick “bang bang” herself.  You know at that point that 
she’s there for two purposes: to fuck or to party.  When you approach her, be on the lookout for any lip 
biting or sucking.  Believe it or not, these are usually little cues that she wants to suck something else.  
The hook up will also be generous with the touching.  She’ll probably make up some lame excuse to feel 
up your bicep, chest, hair, and will run her fingers up and down your body.  She will also lean into you 
and look up at you with the so-called bedroom eyes.  More than likely her boobs are touching your body, 
and she may even be flipping little glances at your crotch or bumping hers against you while pretending 
that she’s not.  If these aren’t obvious signs that the girl wants to get laid, I don’t know what are. 
As for conversation, Miss Hook Up will ask some questions, but they won’t really be of substance.  
These questions will be dumb and flirty, like:
“How’d you get so strong?”
“Did you drink a lot of milk when you were younger?  Because you are HUGE!”
“Does your foot size reflect the size of something else?”
See?  Dumb questions.  But they are also extremely flirty and offer you the opportunity to respond with 
something sexy and witty.  Yes men, you will have to think a little bit here to get her in the sack - but 
not too much.  If you can’t think of anything, my best advice is to act aloof and mysterious.  Girls LOVE 
that kind of shit!
The “Forever” Girl
Relationship girls definitely operate in a different kind of way.  With body language, relationship girls 
will lean into you, but it will be more with their shoulders leading the way rather than their crotch. 
There will be no breasts pressed up against you with this one.  She’s showing you that she’s pleasantly 
engaged, but she’s not about to lay everything out for you.  Any touching is limited to playful hitting or 
the gentle placement of her fingers somewhere that is APPROPRIATE on your body (this means above 
the waist).  Look for any hair twirling, smiling, and the maintaining of eye contact.  But do not mistake 
this eye contact for bedroom eyes - the eyes will be smiling up at you with interest and nothing more.

Chapter 10 - Meeting In Person
If you actually work up the balls to talk to the forever girl, her questions will definitely be more 
probing: 
“Where did you grow up?”
“How did you get that scar?”
“How old did you say you were?”
Relationship girl is asking questions to seek compatibility, not humpability.  Wait a few minutes before 
you begin sexualizing the conversation with this one.  Though she will definitely appreciate it, she has to 
get to know you a little bit first, else you risk coming off as a total ass.
Location
So your luck has sucked at the bar.  Really, are you that surprised?  Women go to bars with their guard 
up, as they know all too well that the guys there are drinking liquid courage so they can beg for a phone 
number and some action (word to all you players who thought you could game up at the bar and snag 
a number - girls can read too and are on to you).  They also know that no guy in there is going to hear 
anything that they have to say over that forever present bass beat or Celtic music in the background.
Bars are a definite no-no for the long term girls.  Chances of finding your soul mate here are about one 
in a million.  But if you happen to be at a bar and want to try your luck, remember the body language 
signals that you just learned and apply them to get what you want.
So if the bars are out, just where are the best places to meet a woman?
The Mall
The mall is an obvious choice – it’s a woman’s retreat, a haven they run to in order to de-stress and 
enjoy.  It is also the place where you can perhaps make your best move.
My advice to men is to make a “round” of the entire mall.  Pick out stores for women that display 
clothing that appeals to you (chances are, you’ve found at least a few).  Now go into those stores and 
begin picking out pieces of clothing.  Work on appearing confused.  Work on checking out the female 
shoppers, or even the salesgirls you may be interested in.  With a shirt and pants or skirt in hand, play 
the dumb male card and ask them: 
“I’m looking for something for my sister.  Do these two things go well together?”
NOTE:  If you do not have a sister, say mother.  Or niece.  Just be sure not to lie about any family 
relations, because it can come back to bite you in the ass.
Here’s a tip: be sure that whatever you picked out does NOT go well together.  Play the dumb man card 
– it works wonders on the ladies.  They take pity on our so-called lack of fashion sense, so capitalize on 
this false belief.  Here’s another tip: Do not pick out anything too sexy like lingerie or crotchless panties, 
for reasons too obvious to explain.
As long as you choose something hideous, she’ll tell you that what you chose is not looking so hot.  
Pick one of the two articles of clothing, say you really like whatever piece that is, and ask her opinion of 
what would go with it.  That, my friend, is a great entry to conversation and to bedroom fun times.
The Grocery Store
This location is an absolute classic.  The great part about the grocery store is the element of surprise.  
Women definitely are not looking for love between the aisles, and you can usually tell by the sweat 
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online

134
Chapter 10 - Meeting In Person
pants and lack of makeup.  But hey, in my opinion, if you see a woman who is under dressed in the 
grocery store and find her attractive, this is proof of a true beauty.
The grocery store is also a place with a wealth of potentially sexualized topics.  Just one word 
of caution:  Stay away from commenting on her melons.  How old is that?  How corny.  How 
PREDICTABLE.  You do NOT want to be “that guy”.
There are some other lines, though, that you can use and that will come out as accidentally sexual.  
I like to play it as if I didn’t mean to make the double entendre (after all, that’s the point of double 
entendre isn’t it?).  If she gives you THAT LOOK after you make the double entendre or innuendo (you 
know the one – the raised eyebrow, or even a chuckle if she’s really cool) you can then pretend to be 
embarrassed and introduce yourself.
A good area of the grocery store for sexual innuendos is  the meat aisle.  Ask about different cuts, 
how to cook it, any advice and even some tasty recipes that she may know of.  Just for fun, here’s an 
example of a grocery store comment you do NOT want to make:
“Is this the laxatives aisle?  Because the thought of seeing you later tonight has been 
running through my mind…”
Yeah, awful image there, bud.  AWFUL.  Avoid any images that conjure up the toilet bowl.
Cookware/Kitchen Stores And Liquor Stores
See?  There IS a benefit to burning your pots and pans!  If you’re shopping 
around for some new cookware, be on the lookout for new targets.  When you pick 
up some cookware, invite her over to sample some of your cooking and  some 
wine!
Join The Hippies
Okay, I don’t mean this literally.  But what I do mean is for you to try picking up 
a girl at a special interest group.  Save the trees, anti-war demonstrations and 
any sort of PETA rallies will do the trick. The girls there already have bleeding hearts for a certain 
cause and are obviously capable of passion – why else would they be at these rallies on a perfectly 
good Saturday afternoon?  Being the sensitive guy who feels for a similar issue as the women will do 
wonders for your love life.  
A  word of caution, though, if you have no idea WHAT the cause is, do not even attempt to pick up 
these chicks.  DO NOT.  Especially if you plan on seeing her beyond one night.  She will ask questions, 
and you will have no answers.  Or your answers will put you at the risk of looking like a complete 
jackass or looking like you’re only there to pick up chicks.  Imagine that!
This being said, if you do have any social issue interests, this is the time to hit up some clubs or 
groups on the subject.  You may be pleasantly surprised just how much of a chick convention these 
events are, and how easily they can be to get a babe in the sack.  Plus you get to indulge in an actual 
interest of yours at the same time.  It’s a win-win!
NOTE:  A lot of guys stay away from various extreme activist causes.  The women involved in these  
are usually quite grubby and gross.  On the bright side, you’ll have very little competition, if any at all.   
But remember the words of the late, great George Carlin: “Why is it that most of the women in the 
feminist movement are women you wouldn’t want to fuck anyway?”
Book Stores
Nothing beats finding women in the bookstore.  Interested in Shakespeare?  So is she!  Love Stephen 
King?  So does she!  People who read seem to be a rarity these days, so you will look like some

exotic, foreign being to her, which is mysteriously appealing.  Of course, this is directed to guys who 
DO read.  However, even if you’re not big on books, think back to anything you were forced to read 
in high school.  If you don’t remember the author or name of the book, start Googling.  Go with that 
book name and author in mind and hang around that section in the bookstore.  If a woman comes up 
and seems to be interested in that particular section of the store, start asking questions.  Does she 
know that author well?  What authors is she into?  Oh yeah?  THAT author?  You like them too! (That’s 
a total lie, but it’ll work – just be sure to quickly change the subject and paraphrase anything she says 
about that author or book so you sound like you KNOW what you’re talking about). 
WARNING: If you try to pass yourself off as book-knowledgable with a really bright, well read 
woman, and you aren’t – she will tear your game to shreds in seconds.
Here’s a hint.  There are a ton of book review websites online.  Just Google “book summaries,” 
“book reviews” or “book synopsis” and you’ll find them.  Bookrags.com is a great place to start.  
Alternatively, Amazon generally includes a well detailed description of every book it sells.  This is great 
information that you can use to your advantage if you don’t have time to read the damned thing.
Here’s another great feature of most bookstores: they have coffee shops!  They are built right into 
the freakin’ place, so it’s easy for you to coerce your lady reader to sit down for a latte and discuss 
whether or not “The Stand” or “Pet Cemetery” was a better book.  
If you get to the coffee shop, pat yourself on the back, my friend.  That is a certified date.
Coffee Shops
Coffee shops are perhaps one of the most obvious of places to go and meet women.  Why?  The 
atmosphere tends to be very warm and inviting.  Music is almost always playing at an appropriate 
noise volume, not too loud to talk over, but loud enough to listen to and comment on, and there are a 
variety of targets available to you – business women, students, the unemployed.
Not only that, but chances are you’ll be shuffled into a long line up.  The line up alone offers plenty of 
Dating Commando opportunities since most women in that line up are generally bored and antsy to 
get their cup o’ Joe; capitalize on that.
Wine Tastings
This one, really, should be incredibly obvious, but men just don’t tend to think.  Wine tastings are 
great, because there is alcohol involved, and it has a far more romantic air than your standard bar or 
club.  Women and men alike are there to relax and have a good time, so there’s a very good chance 
that any woman you see there and are interested in will have her guard down, especially after the 
sixth or seventh tasting.
Another plus to wine tastings is that chicks seem to think this is something fun to do before they 
go watch strippers as part of their bachelorette party.  Bachelorette parties mean hot, single girls 
between 20 to 35 years of age who are being forced to dream of their own wedding plans and who are 
probably yearning for a bit of romance for themselves.  I cannot tell you how much you have to take 
a wine tasting tour, no matter how lame you may feel doing it.  Get a buddy to come along – chances

shops.  Discussing your book pick over a

are he’ll certainly agree when you present him with these juicy facts.
Strip Clubs
DON’T CLOSE THE BOOK YET!  I know, you probably think I’m crazy for suggesting this, but think 
about it: as with the wine tastings, lots of girls think that it’s fun to hit up a strip club when their 
girlfriend is getting married.  Or they just do it to feel like a man for an evening.  And by feeling like a 
man, that may also mean trying to just fuck and chuck like a man.
You’ve been to a strip club, right?  You know that there’s a lot of down time between acts.  This is 
when you make your move and talk up some girls, especially if you see a group of half pissed hotties 
with only one of them wearing a veil.
The best way to approach the strip club is to also look at it as not going to see the strippers (though 
hell yes you WILL see them!).  Within the first half hour, pick out a girl – or a group of girls – who you 
think are pretty damn cute.  Pay attention to THEM while girls are on stage.  Make a point to talk to 
THEM and maintain eye contact with them while the strippers are on stage.  This will give the girl a 
huge ego boost and make her feel good about herself.  Fabulous silicone boobs are jiggling just over 
there and you’re watching HER!  It’s a great technique, it works, and it’s gotten me laid at least 5 
times.
If you’re going to the strip club to see some titty, go another night when you turn off your newly 
acquired Dating Commando macking powers.
NOTE: Don’t you dare stray from your purpose here and try to date the strippers!  They are PAID 
to be nice to you.  That’s right, they are PAID to act as if they like your ass.  To a stripper, you are 
nothing but a walking ATM machine.
Hospitals And Seniors Homes
Before you call me a skeeze, think about it: the women working there are compassionate and caring, 
and they are likely to be good quality ladies (this is particularly important if you’re looking for your 
forever girl).  The other thing I’ve noticed about both hospitals and seniors’ homes is that the women 
working there tend to be pretty damn cute!  Maybe hospital administrators like to have eye candy 
around, too?
If you’re there to visit grandma, great!  Take time to go and chat up the nurses about your grandma, 
then gradually turn the conversation to them.  Any commonality between the nurse or care taker 
and your grandmother is a great segue into conversation.  Girls also love family men who adore 
the women in their own family (mothers, grandmothers, and sisters especially) so you don’t come 
off looking like a dirt bag, but rather a caring and loving individual.  Bring granny flowers too, you 
conniving little shit. 
Here’s another good reason for visiting the hospital or a senior’s home:  The person you’re visiting, 
especially if it is a parent or a grandparent, will actually vouch for you!  They’ll brag about their 
wonderful son, grandson, great grandson, nephew – whoever you are in relation to them – so the 
female employees will at least think you’re a quality person.  Unpaid testimonials are the best!
If you’re not there to actually visit someone though, and they certainly will ask you who you’re 
visiting – they know the place inside and out, you’d best stay away.  Otherwise you look like some 
crazy creep who may end up being dragged out by security.  Makes for a good story, but it also makes  
a bad impression.
The Beach 
“The beach is the place where all shapes and sizes

Chapter 10 - Meeting In Person
Lack girdles and pads to make their disguises” 
	
	
	
	
	
Mad Magazine	
Obvious, right?  But have you gotten laid by a girl you picked up from the beach?  I bet NOT.  You 
probably spent a good amount of time ogling all of the girls in bikinis, which other girls of course 
noticed, and that makes you look like a dirt bag, which prevents you from getting laid.  
You can’t go to the beach acting like a horn dog.  Seriously, cut that act right out of your repertoire.  
Go with a book and an iPod, and maybe polarized glasses (these are so that girls cannot follow your 
eyes as easily, so you might be checking out other women, but they would be none the wiser).  The 
book and the iPod are conversation pieces.
Also, be sure you’re looking fine.  If you have a bit of a gut, throw a shirt on over that.  If you’re 
tight, be sure to flaunt it.  Openers at the beach are as simple as:
“Excuse me, could you tell me the time?”
“Sorry, I know this sounds like a bad pick-up line, but seriously – could you put some 
lotion on my back?”
“Do you know where the concession stand is?”
“Have you been in the water?  Is it freezing?”
Don’t question the lotion one.  Once you point out the obvious, girls will think that you are not GOING 
for the obvious (for them to touch you, and possibly give you sex).  Little do they know that you’re 
playing reverse psychology and you really just want what they THOUGHT you wanted in the first place. 
It works.  Laid twice with that line.  
Once you have an opener, make a note of what she’s doing: does she have a book?  An mp3 player?  
If she has a book, hold yours up and point out the obvious: you’re reading too!  What’s her book 
about?  Be super casual about it, though.  If you seem too interested, she’ll smell that desperation 
on you and it’s game over.  With the mp3 player, make a reference to a commonly liked band.  Stay 
away from Miley Cyrus, and talk about the Beatles, Rolling Stones or U2.  Even if you know nothing 
about them.  Chances are neither does she, but people generally recognize that such bands command 
respect and admiration.
Laundromats
Yeah, alright, another one that you’ve thought of once before, I know.  But have you had SUCCESS 
with it?  What makes Laundromats so great for conversation is that everyone in them is damned 
BORED.  Bored out of their minds, and hungry for discussion.  This alone makes the Laundromat a 
great ground for finding women.  
If you can find some witty comment about being near a bunch of vibrating machines (the driers, NOT 
what you may have initial thought) then more points to you.  Just be sure not to approach a girl while 
she’s going through her bras and thongs; she’ll feel embarrassed and is certain to turn you away.  
Here’s a little something that works well:
You: “You know what makes laundromats so great for conversation?”
Her: “Uh...no...”
You: “Everyone in them is so damned bored.  We’re bored out of our minds ... 
starving for conversation”
Her: [laughs] “Yeah, I guess so...]
You: “You guess so?  Man, a friend of mine tells me that his favorite place to meet 
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online

138
Chapter 10 - Meeting In Person
women is the laundromat because of it.  I’m so bored waiting for my clothes to dry 
that it’s actually starting to make sense...”
And you get the idea.  
Pick The Loser
So the title sounds a bit mean.  Sue me.  What I mean by this is, if you are in to any competitive 
sports or games, if there’s a girl on the other team that lost who you think is pretty cute, go and 
introduce yourself.  There are two benefits from picking the loser:
1)	 You both obviously have a common interest (whatever you kicked her ass at) so you have 
something to talk about.
2)	 You can point out the great plays or strategies she used during the game – hell, even if it is 
chess, she’ll appreciate the banter and having someone to actually talk about the game to.
If you’re a real dork, you can branch this out to any online game play.  Like to play Xbox or 
Playstation online?  Take note of anyone that you think is female on there and where she’s located.   If 
she’s within suitable distance, you can befriend her and start with some flirting and play either against 
each other or as a team.
This also would work for other role playing games, or RPG’s as I think the cool kids call them.  
Second Life, World of Warcraft, and whatever other dork games are out there.  Jeez, now I feel like a 
loser for even talking about this crap.
So these are only some of the potentially awesome places to pick up chicks in real life (I think 
the World of Warcraft kids call this “IRL”).  The point here is this: girls are virtually (pun intended) 
everywhere.  EVERYWHERE.  All places are like an untapped booty resource just waiting for you to 
“tap it”.  You just have to use your brain a little and think of some witty and sexually clever things to 
say.  Do that, and you’re sure to enjoy great success.
Off-Leash Dog Parks
What more casual place is there on the planet than an off-leash dog park?  Not only is it swarming 
with chicks, but it’s swarming with obvious conversation starters:
“Is that your dog?  What breed is he?”
“Your dog’s gorgeous!  What’s her name?”
“How old is he?”
See?  These are basic, simple questions that even the most stunted individual can come up with and 
spit out without looking like an idiot.
There are some draw backs to this location, though.  If you’ve been to an off-leash dog park, you 
know full well that most of the women there are either:
•	
there with their boyfriend; or
•	
there with their husband; or
•	
the ones that are there alone tend to be 30+ years of age, or teenagers who aren’t yet 
legal for you to even LOOK at.
Sometimes there are hot dog walkers, though, who tend to be between 18 and 25 (college kids trying 
The Dating Commando

139
Chapter 10 - Meeting In Person
to make a couple bucks) so really, there’s someone there for everyone.  It may take a bit of poaching, 
and you may look a bit strange if you don’t actually have a dog, but you can either borrow your 
friends’ pooch or claim you’re interested in getting a dog and just want to learn more about them.
Be An Expert
Just think about it.  What are you good at?  If you’re coming up with nothing, or totally coming up 
with lame answers, you’re not thinking hard enough.  This is more about marketing yourself; think 
about a skill or talent that you have.  Are you good at art?  Are you a good cook?  Maybe you’re a whiz 
at computers, or you know how to sell shit on eBay.  Why not put out an ad in the paper or on a free 
website (such as Craigslist.com) offering your services?
For example:
Cooking for Single Women
Want to tantalize your taste buds?  Learn some simple yet delicious recipes from a 
talented chef for a limited discount price of $15 per lesson.
Best of all, you eat what you make!
Not only are you a product, but you’re also selling a product.  Sell, sell, and sell until you can’t sell 
any more!  Something like this will also guarantee you to be surrounded by women whom you know 
are single, and who’ll  just love being taught how to cook by a stud like you.
Attitude
Attitude is so important.  The popular title today used to describe a rather disagreeable man is 
douche bag.  Here are some pointers on avoiding being called a douche bag:
Confident vs. Cocky 
Yes, I have been stressing the confidence factor throughout this entire book.  
Women love confident, strong men – but they don’t like cocky men.  What’s the 
difference?  Along with confidence comes a sort of graciousness and respect.  
Along with cockiness comes an air of assholery and snobbery.
In conversation, a confident man will stand tall, straight shoulders, smile, and 
paraphrase what the woman is saying.  He will then also give his own input in 3 
sentences or less.
A cocky man, however, will probably lean or cock his hip, may or may not be 
wearing sunglasses (even though you are indoors or in a club), may or may not 
have a popped collar, and will either interrupt, interject, carry on talking for 5 
minutes about complete bullshit, or make inappropriate and unrelated comments 
to whatever the girl is talking about.  Nine times out of ten, he’ll be much more interested in 
impressing her than in listening to anything she has to say.
Sure, sometimes what girls talk about is downright boring.  But you at least have to pretend to be 
interested to get anywhere.  Women have the advantage here; deal with it or go home.
Self Assured vs. Self Righteous
This one is directly linked to confidence.  Being self assured means that you are sure of what you 
want, that you are sure of what you know, and that you can make decisions.  Girls love guys who can 
make decisions.  Being self assured, however, also means being open to suggestiona and alternative 
views or beliefs.  You’ll listen to them, accept them, even if you still have your own ideas of how things 
should be done.

Being “cocky” will 
make you seem 
like a dick.  Being 
“confident” and 
“self-assured” will 
create attraction 
between you and 
her.

140
Chapter 10 - Meeting In Person
Self righteous, on the other hand, is really just a nice way of saying asshole.  Self righteous people 
think that they and only THEY are correct in any situation.  They aren’t open to suggestions or seeing 
anyone else’s view points and they certainly don’t give a damn about what you think.  They are also 
forever on the defense, which gets real damn tiresome after 5 minutes.  Such assholes would rather 
be right than happy.  If you’re a self righteous kind of guy, can it or get used to firing off knuckle 
children every night.
Positive vs. Preposterous
By preposterous, I mean INSANE.  What do I mean by this?  Okay, chicks dig the positive attitude.  
They like to have a person with them who has a bright, hopeful outlook when it comes to the future 
and even present events.  What they do NOT want is someone who is so ridiculously positive that it is 
just, well, RIDICULOUS.
For example, a woman says, “I just feel so sorry for those kids slaving away for Wal-Mart in China…”  
A preposterous person will go ahead and try to even make THIS kind of comment positive with such 
things as:
“At least we get to save money!”  
You say this, and you’ll get slapped by this woman.  
“Good to know they don’t have time to be bored.”  
Uhh, yeah.  Also awful.
“You know they’d just be at home playing around on the computer or Xbox.  At least 
they’re being productive.”  
You are a horrible human being if you think that this is at all POSITIVE.
The correct response would be to nod your head soberly and agree that something MUST be done 
to correct this issue – and maybe make some bright suggestions on how this can be done in the 
future.  Or bullshit your way through a conversation about wanting to go to China to visit one of these 
factories, and attempt to set the fat-cat factory owner straight.
What?  You need another example?  Okay.  How about Tom Cruise jumping up and down on Oprah’s 
couch while professing his love for Katie Holmes?  That’s just a little too creepy positive if you ask me.
Flirty vs. Forceful
No girl wants to feel trapped in a conversation with you.  By flirty, I mean 
keeping the conversation light and playful.  I mean giving the girl some easy 
outs in case she’s not interested in talking to you (remember: take no offense, 
it may just not be a good day for her).  By flirty, I mean fun.  Some guys come 
on a bit too strong, though, and have what I call forceful conversations.  Even 
the body language is forceful: they place an arm against the wall so the woman 
cannot easily escape that way, they tend to have a wide, blocking stance and I’ve 
also noticed that they tend to crane their neck forward just a bit too much so it’s 
noticeable.  Their conversation also tends to be about what he wants to talk about.  
If you find yourself not even paying attention to what the girl’s really saying, or 
trying to change the subject, you’re probably the forceful breed of asshole, which 
is why you’re finding no luck with women. 
Powerful vs. Pathetic
Girls know a pathetic man from a mile away.  Believe me, they have a stunning capacity for observing

flirting is playful.

being flirty and will

detail and probably made you about five minutes before you saw them.  This is, again, where I restate 
the importance of your dress and posture.  Be sure you dress like a winner.  You don’t have to sell the 
farm for an Armani suit, but even throwing on a black collared shirt and a good pair of jeans will work 
wonders for you.  Invest in a good leather jacket too.  Chicks dig leather since it gives off that bad boy 
vibe without you needing to be a hardcore biker or drug dealer.  Stand tall, walk with a purpose, and 
have a pleasant look on your face.  You don’t have to be grinning like an idiot, but definitely appear 
pleased with what you see around you.
Pathetic men tend to have ill-fitted pants and shirts on, usually faded and unkempt.  Their shoulders 
tend to curve inwards and they may walk with their head down and appear somewhat lost.  Be sure 
to pay attention to your pose, whether you’re hunting for women on the streets or meeting a woman 
for the first time.  I cannot stress enough how important body language is.  This will not only help you 
with women, but with all aspects of life.  Trust me, I know and practice what I preach.
Approach
How do you approach a woman successfully?  Walk with a purpose.  Hold your shoulders in such a 
way that you imagine them horizontally straight – though be sure not to be stiff.  Again, practice in the 
mirror if you need to.  Most importantly, have your head up high.  Don’t know what to do with your 
hands?  Shove them in your pockets.  Alternate between having them in your pockets and resting one 
or both hands on your hips, like I suggested earlier.
The “pick up line” (which shouldn’t sound like a pick up line if you want a damn chance) should be 
relevant to the situation you are in.  I went over some of the potential pick up lines earlier.  One that 
is pretty standard is asking for the time.  You can stop any woman on the street and ask her for the 
time:
“Excuse me, do you have the time?”
She’ll then rummage through her bag for her cell phone, OR she will actually have a watch.  She’ll 
then tell you the time.
“Thank you – [NOW INTERRUPT HER LEAVING] oh, where did you get your watch?  It’s 
gorgeous, something like this would be a great birthday present for my mother.”
or:
“…oh, where did you get that cell phone?  My [sister/niece/aunt/mother] has been 
looking around for one that’s this kind of style.”
Why do you always mention a female family member?  Because mentioning a woman shows that you 
have some experience with women in general, even if it’s not romantically.  Actually, the less romantic 
the relationship, the better (that’s why we stay away from mentioning any female friends; women feel 
threatened by them and will always suspect you want to bang ‘em).  Mentioning family also proves 
you’re a family type of guy, who most women (especially young women) are ultimately looking for 
since they will or DO want their own family.
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online
“Pathetic men tend not to take care of 
themselves. Their shoulders slope and they 
walk as though they’re lost.”

142
Chapter 10 - Meeting In Person
Even after interrupting them, it’s pretty easy for a woman to race away and carry on down the street 
if she wants to.  A true Dating Commando will use this as the conversation opener and evenutally 
work his way into getting her number and a date. 
When you do get a girl to go past those first two lines, you want to be sure to maintain eye contact 
and, no matter how painful, listen to her.  Just listen.  That’s what all women on the planet want: 
someone to sound off to.  Men didn’t invent gossip.  Well they didn’t.  You also will want to prove 
that you are actually listening to her by restating what she’s said in a paraphrase.  Make a situational 
comment to reassure her that you are both there together.  Laugh.  Nod with concern.  Make actions 
that are appropriate, and be sure to interject with some personal commentary that will hint that you 
are a guy with some kind of cool LIFE going on.
Chapter Conclusion
If a hook up is what ye seek, look for the loud and physical girl who is mingling with a lot of 
men.
If a long term relationship is what ye seek, stay away from the bar scene; your forever girl is 
quieter and more reserved and prefers a more intimate setting.
You can find a woman almost anywhere.  It’s all how you play the game that makes the 
location successful.
 Project a general sense of well being and confidence and keep your ego in check.  This will 
guarantee a successful approach to any woman.

Chapter 11 - Culture Shock
D
on’t think it’s important to appear at least a wee bit cultured?  Think again.  Here’s a little tip 
for ya:  Sitting around in your boxers watching a baseball game and talking about what so-
and-so celebrity did last weekend isn’t really CULTURE.  I don’t know why so many guys seem to think 
that yesterday’s sports games or the newest gaming console is what culture is about.
Appearing cultured is to appear worldly.  To appear worldly is to appear interesting.  To appear 
interesting is to get sex and to get second dates.  If you’ve been reading this shit up to now, you’ll know 
that I’ve been drilling the idea of differentiation into you big time.  You’ve got to be different than all the 
other assholes that are contacting her or you don’t stand a freaking chance.  Got it?
If you’ve just been trolling behind a screen for the past few months, it’s time to get out and do 
something interesting.  It’s time to crack open a book or a newspaper and read.  You see, all chicks 
really dig this sort of shit...even the trailer trash skanks.  It’s time to go and BE something, alright?  
Here’s where you need to start:
Current Events
There is no way to appear more cultured than to at least have some remote idea of what’s happening 
on this planet that you have been ignoring.  Stop and read the newspaper every once in a while and 
keep yourself hip to both local and worldly events.  If there is a popular topic going on in the news – 
again, local or global – be sure you know what the fuck is up with it.  Know what it is. Have an opinion.  
It’s important.  Women aren’t really keen to be with a guy who doesn’t have a clue.
If you have a date planned for tomorrow and you don’t have time to read the paper, flip CNN on or 
any other sort of news babbling channel and watch it for 5 minutes.  Watch the main event that they’re 
talking about, and be sure to read the scrolling text at the bottom of the screen.  You will get bite-
sized pieces of shit that’s going on, which should be enough to at least give you some idea as to what’s 
happening.  As well, cnn.com will give you bite-sized readable news clips that will help make you seem 
in touch with what’s going on around you.
Another important part to being hip to current events is knowing what the 
“celebutards” (aka celebrities, or rich, talentless, self important assholes) are up 
to.  What’s Paris Hilton doing or sucking?  Isn’t that divorce between so-and-so and 
what’s-her-ass so crazy?  If you need help with this, visit the celebrity section of 
any major Internet site like Yahoo! or MSN (and no, I’m not being paid to endorse 
any site I’ve mentioned) or hell, visit that site created by “Perez Hilton” (I simply 
refuse to plug him any further).
NOTE:  I generally recommend refraining from bringing up celebrities when 
talking to girls on dates.  It’s shallow and lame.  The reason YOU need to have 
some kind of an idea, though, is so if SHE brings it up you’ll have some ammo.  
Don’t know who Jon & Kate are?  You should (though I personally would be fuckin’ 
proud if you didn’t).
Wine
Does anything say cultured more than knowing all about wine?  I have had all too many girls 
compliment me on my fine wine knowledge.
“Wow, how did you know this Shiraz would go so well with this lamb?”

Chapter 11 - Culture Shock
To which I then make up some story about either learning this shit while traveling in France or learning 
it on some wine tour…it’s a good lead in for an interesting story.
If you have already planned a dinner or even a lunch date with the girl, you probably have the 
restaurant picked out.  Assuming you aren’t taking her through the Wendy’s drive-thru or to the “BK 
Lounge Room” (this is my fancy phrase for Burger King), then there will probably be a wine list and also 
a menu list.  Look the place up online or phone to find out what they have available.  If not, it’s worth 
it to swing by and grab a menu.  Don’t be afraid to ask the staff BEFORE you get to the restaurant what 
they’d recommend with the different meals.  Nothing will make her say holy shit faster than your waiter 
complimenting you on your choice of wines.
Look at what kind of foods are offered.  Is it a seafood place?  Italian?  Is it some sort of steak house?  
If the majority of foods are, say, beef, you may want to learn what kind of wines go best with beef.  A 
quick Internet search will then guide you to consider suggesting to her a Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot.  
These are two popular wines, and are undoubtedly on this restaurant’s wine list.
I’m assuming that you’re a bit of a lazy bastard, so I’m going to provide you with a quick list of what 
wines go well with some main course foods below:
TYPE OF FOOD
BEST WINES
Beef
Chardonnay (white), Merlot (red), Zinfandel (red), 
Cabernet Sauvignon (red)
Chicken
Chardonnay (white), Pinot Noir (red), White 
Zinfandel (pink or rose; particularly good with 
barbeque chicken)
Lamb
Cabernet Sauvignon (red), Merlot (red), Zinfandel 
(red)
Seafood
Chardonnay (white), Pinot Noir (red), Sparkling 
wines
Pasta 
This is a tricky one!  Depending on the sauce, a different 
wine can go well with the dish. When in doubt, suggest 
Chardonnay
Chardonnay (white), Sauvignon Blanc (white), Pinot 
Noir (red),  Merlot (red)
Vegetarian
Sauvignon Blanc (white), Merlot (red)
I’m hoping from this list you’ve also deduced that some wines go well with more 
foods than others.  Here’s a tip: always have a nice bottle of chardonnay and 
merlot in your place.  Throw in a pink wine if you really want to be sure that you 
have something she likes.  That way, when you take her home later after the date 
(which you WILL, you stallion) you will have a good wine to offer her to smooth the 
way to the bedroom.
Dry or Sweet?  Because I like you and I really want to see you succeed in your 
dating quest, I’m going to give you another wine tip.  The sweetness or dryness 
of a wine is measured using a ratio scale of acid to sugar.  There are 4 basic 
categories:  Dry, Medium-Dry, Medium-Sweet, and Sweet.  0 to 1 is considered 
Dry.  1 to 2 is considered Medium-Dry, 2 to 4 is considered Medium-Sweet, and 
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online
“Nothing will make her say Holy Shit! 
faster than a waiter complimenting your 
choice of wines with dinner.”
The safest bet to 
covering your bases 
is to keep a bottle 
of Chardonnay 
(white), and Merlot 
(red) on hand for 
those home-cooked 
meals.

146
Chapter 11 - Culture Shock
4 or above is considered Sweet.  Again, the ratio is acid to sugar.  1:0 to 1:1 = Dry; 1:1 to 1:2 = 
Medium Dry; 1:2 to 1:4 = Medium Sweet; and 1:4 or greater is Sweet.
You’ve probably seen wine tasters swirl a bit of wine in their glass?  They then hold the glass still 
and watch the residual liquid as it crawls down the side of the glass.  What they’re watching for is the 
legginess (legs) of the wine.  Those are the straight line streaks that form.  They’re 
caused by the sugar in the wine.  Oh oh...there we go with the sweetness scale 
again!  The sweeter the wine, the leggier the wine.
Okay, one last word on the whole dry/sweet thing.  Sweet wines will give her a 
headache and make her want to puke after awhile.  Red wines tend to have more 
preservatives in them which can cause intense headaches.  Most wine newbies 
prefer white.  If in doubt error towards the medium dry whites.  Fuck...look at you 
now!  Wow!  You’re going to sound like James Bond when you order a Chardonnay 
medium dry with that Pasta Prima Vera!
Just don’t get her TOO drunk.
Okay, I’m just WAY too excited for you now.  I know I said last word about the whole wine thing, 
but let’s really amp this up to a pro level and impress this girl by showing off your wine and cheese 
knowledge.  
TYPE OF CHEESE
BEST WINES
Creamy Cheeses (Brie and Camembert)
Chardonnay (white), Champagne
Mild Cheeses (Mozzarella, Monterey Jack)
Chardonnay (white), Pinot Noir (red)
Medium Cheeses (Cheddar, Gouda)
Merlot (red), Pinot Noir (red)
Pungent Cheeses (Blue Cheese, Aged 
cheeses)
Sauvignon Blanc (white), Cabernet Sauvignon (red)
Food
Taking her to the most fancy and expensive restaurant in town does not mean that you are cultured.
On the other hand, taking her to a fast food joint definitely says you are not.  What it does say is that 
you suck.  HARD.  
What I like to do is to make plans to go to a smaller more quaint restaurant with which she may 
not be familiar.  Know of a little Italian bistro?  Take her there!  That small Spanish joint right around 
the corner is also a really good choice.  A girl should be and is more impressed when you take her 
somewhere nice and different than if you lay down $300 on a Steak and Lobster dinner.
By the way, that Steak and Lobster shit doesn’t cost 300 bones!  If you really want to impress her, 
and I mean totally blow her mind (and maybe she’ll blow you!), offer to take her out for Steak and 
Lobster at Chez Moi (that’s cutsie French for your place).  Spend some time and effort on buying some 
great ingredients and learning how to cook it up nice (the people at the meat counter of the grocery 
store will have some great advice for you!).  Buy a nice medium-dry Chardonnay, some Camembert 
and Monterery Jack cheese and you are Golden my friend!  Not only will she be totally blown away, but 
it’ll cost you less than 60 bucks!  Use the savings to buy condoms, stud!
Dancing
What makes a man seem more cultured and sophisticated than knowing how to dance?  I’m not 
suggesting you go pro and make it to the semi-finals on that Dancing with the Stars bullshit.  I’m also 
not suggesting you try to remember those horrid line dancing moves that we all had to do during gym

class (haunting memories, right?).
Women, in general, are impressed by a man who knows some ballroom dancing.  This includes The 
Waltz, the Samba, the Rumba, and even the Cha-Cha-Cha (recommended for beginners!).  The Tango 
and Foxtrot are also classic favorites.
Why do girls love ballroom dancing?  It’s romantic, cheesehead! or so they have been lead to 
believe.  They have been watching shitty female-targeted programming since the day they were born 
that brainwash them into thinking that dancing with a man who KNOWS how to dance is one of the 
loveliest and hottest things in the world.  Prince Charming would know the Rumba; so you should 
know it too.
Salsa is also extremely impressive, and very sexually charged.  I highly recommend YouTube’ing 
some salsa moves and practicing them before  the mirror.  If you whip out a couple of Salsa moves on 
the dance floor, your date will be quite impressed.
Other dances worth checking out are the Swing and the Lambada.
Some dances do NOT bother with: line dancing (unless you’re in a country Western bar; but why 
are you there in the first place…?), the Polka (need I say more?) and any of those awful dance moves 
from the 50s, like the fuckin’ mashed potato.  Only pull this shit out to be jokey-jokey funny-funny, 
but keep the moves to under 5 seconds.  Anyone seen with a date doing the goddamn Chicken Dance 
is bound to be very embarrassed.  Unless you’re 90 years old, in which case just waking up will have 
impressed her.
TIP: Taking her out to a culture-themed restaurant?  Learn a dance that is appropriate to that 
culture.  Even if you don’t go out dancing afterwards, who’s to say that you can’t do a little fun 
dancing on the walk back to your place or in your apartment?
When you make it to actually ASKING her for a second date you can even suggest 
dance classes.  Dancing is a free pass to touch her, and it usually reminds the girl 
of having sex.  Is that a win-win or WHAT?
And since I’m on the whole dance class schtick, you know how bars have a 
lady’s night where the girls get in free and even get a complimentary first drink?  
Guys of course pay full cover charge and pay for the drinks.  You know all those 
dating sites where it’s free for women to sign up?  Guys pay full price and pay for 
connections and messages.  It’s done this way because if you can fill the bar or 
website with drunk, horny women...guys will pay money by the bucket load to join 
in on the pussy-fest.
However, there is one place where it doesn’t work like this.  Ballroom dance 
classes.  You see, these places are filled with women who paid top dollar to be 
there...but there are very few, if any, guys.  Guys are a rare commodity at these 
places.  Dance schools will sometimes give guys FREE lessons just for showing 
up.  Usually they’ll give us guys the first lesson for free and try to pair us up with a 
single hottie to ensure we’ll come back.

Chapter 11 - Culture Shock
Travel
Travel is an indicator of being cultured.  Traveling to your grocery store isn’t so impressive and 
doesn’t count.  But if you have been across the ocean, gone south, or hell, even if you’ve been to 
CANADA it’s worth mentioning.  You can then go on and on about the beauty of where you went and 
the impact that it has had on your life.  And yeah, travel and experiencing other cultures is supposed 
to have some sort of profound impact on you - so make something up if it hasn’t.  Even your trip to 
Delaware could have had a huge impact on your life.
It is important, however, not to boast about where you have been, and it can be very easy to fall into 
that trap.  When one tries to appear modest, it looks as if they’re trying to brag.  Such as:
HER: So where have you traveled to?
HIM: Oh, not too many places… of course, Las Vegas, New York, Los Angeles – those 
are staples.  I went backpacking in Europe 5 years ago!  Yeah, I know, typical college 
guy vacation, right?  Oh, and then I went to Thailand this year, actually… Japan… 
y’know, not too many places.
This is where she can easily roll her eyes and also perhaps feel bad because she’s 
hardly ever even crossed the street, let alone the state line.  
My general rule is, when you’re talking about your travels, don’t be MODEST 
about where you’ve gone; be GRACIOUS.  Mention how goddamn fortunate you are 
to have had the ability to experience these places and don’t be afraid to say just 
how much fun you find travelling to be.  You can also allude to taking her on a trip 
some time too – NOT TO PARIS – but to, say, somewhere a couple of hours away 
– a beautiful mountain lake, a scenic valley that features a great Greek restaurant.  
Think of where there may be a nice beach or ski resort nearby.
TIP: Talking about travel is a great conversation starter when on a date.  After discussing where 
each other has been, play that stupid game “What would you like to see before you die” or “Where 
would you travel to if you knew you’d be dead in a week”.  Chicks dig that shit.
Books
For whatever reason, girls really like guys who read.  I’m guessing it makes us look smart or 
thoughtful or a better potential earner or some shit.  Whatever the reason, if you mention that you 
read, she’s into it.
Wait, let me rephrase that – if you mention that you read QUALITY books (I’m not talking John 
Grisham here) then she’ll be impressed.  Sure, mention that you like Michael Crichton, but that 
doesn’t show that you’re cultured.  If you’re going to fess up to reading Dean Koontz, be sure to 
include other more notable authors.
I need to make another point here as well: if the only notable author you can think of, and mention, 
is SHAKESPEARE, she’s gonna know that you haven’t picked up a fuckin’ book since HIGH SCHOOL.  
You want to pick out at least 3 classic authors and then throw in one more obscure one who maybe 
wrote a book that’s currently on that Oprah Book Club list.  Some authors that seem to impress the 
women are:
George Orwell
John Donne
William Wordsworth
James Joyce

not to brag though

Chapter 11 - Culture Shock
T.S. Elliot
Ernest Hemingway
Dylan Thomas
Edgar Allen Poe
Most girls who have stuck it out to at least grade ten, have heard of the above authors.  Chances are 
they haven’t read their shit, though, so they’ll be impressed that you did.  For extra points, throw in 
a female author, like Virginia Woolf, Margaret Atwood, the Bronte sisters or Jane Austen.  Even if they 
haven’t read the book, they’ve no doubt seen one of the 15 British remakes of Pride and Prejudice.
The Performing Arts
Do people actually go out and SEE plays any more?  And what about ballets?  Answer: HELL NO!  I 
guess the fact that no one really does is why girls are impressed by this shit.  Personally, I think that 
plays are snooty and lame, but this book isn’t written for me, is it?  And before you give me grief 
about my attitude, keep in mind that I worked in live theater for a few years...so I know what I’m 
talking about!
If there’s a good play in town, be sure to ask if she wants to go.  She will probably say “yes” because 
going to watch a play is seen as being cultured and, let’s be real here: what guy in his right mind 
would ask a girl to a play?  Or to the opera?  You KNOW none of her previous dates have invited her to 
a play, so at least you’re being original.
Oh, and if you do invite her to a play, ballet or opera, be sure that you understand the premise of the 
performance before inviting her AND before going.  That way, when she leans over to ask you, “What 
the FUCK’S going on?” you’ll have an answer for her (see how smart you’ll look then?).  You can find 
information on pretty much anything through Google.
The Visual Arts
Okay, this to me is far easier to stomach than the performing arts.  If you’re like most of us sane 
people, you did not get a degree in Art History.  HOWEVER the guys who DID certainly can impress 
the ladies with their appreciation of the visual arts (visual arts to me really just means admiring a 
smokin’ hot woman).  Some of you more cultured dudes may think I sound like a Neanderthal and 
again I must remind you that I have a Fine Arts degree and a Master’s Degree so fuck you.  This is a 
book about getting laid, dickwads.
The visual arts include sculpture, architecture, photography, film and painting.  It would be a good 
idea to teach yourself just a wee bit about art theory and aesthetics.  Google selected art criticisms 
just to sound as if you REALLY know what you’re talking about.  Hell, invite her along to the art 
gallery, though I say the smaller the gallery, the better (yawn).  If you go to a large gallery, there may 
be more notable and famous paintings there which she will expect you to know lots about.  Smaller 
galleries will only have local art and she won’t expect you to know about the artist or the art.  Plus, 
fewer paintings means you can get to the fun part sooner.
Tidy Up Your Social Networking Accounts
If you don’t have your social networking sites, like Facebook and Myspace on high security mode, the 
girl will probably be able to look up your profile.  And, believe me, she WILL (just as you should have 
with her).  She’s not looking to invade your privacy, she’s only looking to be sure that the guy she’s 
hooking up with at the end of the night isn’t a total creep.
Be sure that you do the following things if you haven’t already:
•	
Remove ALL DRUNKEN PHOTOS OF YOURSELF
•	
Remove ALL PHOTOS OF YOU BEHAVING POORLY

Chapter 11 - Culture Shock
•	
Remove ALL BAD PHOTOS OF YOURSELF (at the very least, “untag” yourself so it’s not 
easy for her to find these shots of you)
•	
Troll your message board.  I bet your friends are idiots (really, are you going to disagree 
with me on this one?).  They’ll leave you some bad and inappropriate wall messages, I’m 
sure, so delete those as soon as you notice ‘em.  
•	
If you belong to stupid, inappropriate groups (like The Ejaculator’s Club – get real) 
REMOVE YOURSELF.  Also then wonder WHY you even joined them in the first place.  
Answer:  You are a sad, sad man.
•	
Change your background images.  This applies more to Myspace than it does to Facebook.  
If your background images are breasts and scantily clad women, change that shit.  How 
desperate ARE you, anyway?  Stick with a fuckin’ blue background.
•	
Eliminate ALL personal information that may seem a bit too personal.  This includes 
the amount of kids you wanna have, if you ever want to get married, and your annual 
income.  Remember how you are not supposed to respond to these on your online dating 
profile?  You’re not going to be advertising your answers here either.   
Music
Do you know what the number one song on the charts is right now?  FIND OUT WHAT IT IS.  While 
you’re at it, find out what the top 10 are and then look ‘em up and listen.  Go to www.billboard.com to 
get the top 10 charts of each genre.  You want to be sure to show that you have somewhat of a clue 
as to what’s going on.  I nailed some babe that was a huge fan of Nickleback.  Lucky for me I knew of 
a couple of their tunes and was able to research others.
Fortunately, since almost EVERYONE likes, enjoys, and connects with music, there’s probably not all 
too much learning involved here.  I’m not asking for you to learn musical notations or measures or any 
of that shit.  Chords, note names, treble or bass – nope.  I’m simply suggesting that you learn and at 
least PRETEND to appreciate some of the classics (Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Madonna, even Mozart if 
you really want) and at least know what Britney Spears’ latest song is.  
In case you’re stuck, here are some “classic” artists that are worth name dropping:
•	
Micheal Jackson
•	
The Beatles
•	
Elvis Presley
•	
AC/DC
•	
Bob Marley
•	
Led Zepplin
•	
The Rolling Stones
•	
Pink Floyd
•	
U2
•	
The Eagles
•	
Metallica
•	
Jim Morrison
•	
Guns ‘n Roses
•	
Van Halen
•	
KISS
In case you’re an idiot, here are some artists that you should avoid name dropping:
•	
98 Degrees
•	
Celine Dion
•	
Ace of Base
•	
Reba McEntire
•	
Miley Cyrus
The Dating Commando

151
Chapter 11 - Culture Shock
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online
•	
Billy Rae Cyrus
•	
Roxette
•	
The Backstreet Boys
•	
O-Town
I should say, don’t mention these unless SHE does.  If you begin expressing your love for Nick Lachey 
and his band (don’t know who he is?  Bone up on your celebutard knowledge, jackass) she’ll think 
you’re, well, either very odd or are actually the “G” in GFS.
Movies
Yes, seeing movies DOES make you seem cultured.  Or if it doesn’t, at least the 
girl will know that you get out.
It’s always a good idea to have some favorite classic flicks in mind.  If she ever 
asks you what your favorite movie or movies are (which is bound to happen) you 
have an answer.  And no, your answer better not be Borat.  Yes, I know, funny 
movie, but it shouldn’t be your FAVORITE movie of all time.  God, even saying Top 
Gun is a better choice.  Chicks generally see Borat as a species of anal fluke.
Any of the following are good favorites:  The Rock, Bad Boys 1 and 2, Con Air, 
Pirates of the Caribbean (the first one), Army of Darkness.  Okay, those are some 
of my favorites.  I’ve included a list of the top movies of all time at the back of the 
book.  Be sure to watch some of them so that you can explain what you liked and 
why.  And just like books, you can Google this shit to find awesome reviews that 
will save you the time of having to watch them.
If you know any older classic movie favorites, be sure to mention them.  Hearing that someone’s 
favorite movie is Casablanca is FAR more impressive than Weekend at Bernie’s (or, even worse, 
Weekend at Bernie’s 2.  Yeah, those assholes made a sequel; I was surprised too!).
Chapter Conclusion
Being “cultured” will make you seem respectable and relate-able.  
Knowing what’s happening in the world in many different facets gives you hot conversation 
topics that you can whip out should you ever find yourself conversationally stunted.
Remember: be gracious.  If you try to seem TOO cultured, you’ll come off looking like a snob.

12  The First Date
The Dating Commando
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide to Conquering Women Online

 Chapter 12 - The First Date
I
f you have gotten to this point with a woman, CONGRATULATIONS!  It can be pretty damn hard 
to get a woman to agree to a first date, so pat yourself on the back!  You’re on the fast track to 
becoming a Dating Commando.  If you are reading this and still feel lost on how to get a woman to 
agree to date you, I’ll quickly run over the basics of what you should have learned so far:
•	
Read her profile
•	
When messaging the girl for the first time, be sure to personalize it to show you 
have READ her profile
•	
Begin to sexualize almost immediately to prevent yourself from being easily 
ignored, or to prevent suffering from GFS
•	
Limit the time you speak to her – keep it under 5 minutes
•	
Ask for her number and make plans to meet up almost immediately
Shut The Fuck Up And Let Her Talk
If there is one thing that girls are good at, it’s talking.  How many times have you had your ear talked 
off by your sister or previous girlfriends about the minutest shit that you think no one should care 
about?  Everything and anything is important to them.  Everything that happens or is said alludes to 
something else (even if it doesn’t, they certainly like to believe that it does).
And if the girl ain’t talkin’, then you are definitely doing SOMETHING wrong.
Remember what you’ve been taught already: do not make your conversation with the girl seem like an 
interview for some tedious office job.  You want to keep it fun, interesting and fresh.  Ask questions, but 
also restate what she says from time to time to further encourage her to expand on any given topic.
The great thing about women is that they generally have an opinion on almost everything.  You can 
think of the weirdest shit and they will have something to say about it.  You can think of anything – 
ANYTHING – and she will comment.  You just don’t want to be stuck with the “uhh’s” and “umms” and 
“I don’t know” responses, either from you or she.  Any of the conversation starters cited in this book, 
though, have proven to keep a conversation going for at least 20 minutes before having to dig into the 
well for additional topics.
Whatever you do with your questions, be sure not to do all of the talking.  You think she cares?  No.  
Let HER do the talking but do have something to say when it’s your turn.  It will go far better for you if 
you do so.
Ignoring Her Commentary About You
This may seem incredibly rude, and it sort of is – but it works.  Ignoring what a girl says, when either 
you do not have a good answer to it, you don’t want to answer it, or it can be construed as rude, is very 
effective.  For instance, if when you first meet a girl she says,
“What’s with what you’re wearing?”
Ignore her comment.  You can either chuckle and introduce a new comment, or steam roll ahead 
without even acknowledging she’s spoken and ask her something about herself:
“So you said that your friends and you went to Club Azure this weekend.  Were there 
any guys with popped collars there?”

Chapter 12 - The First Date
Or she may say something like, 
“I saw you were talking to LuLuLisa on Plenty of Fish.  How’s that going?”
Smell the jealousy?  This is a good sign for you, by the way.  Ignore her by looking over her shoulder at 
something, and making a keen observation (insulting other women works well):
“That girl should not be wearing that dress…she can’t pull it off as well as you can.  Good 
taste!”
Note the sexual innuendo?  When she comments on her own good taste be sure 
to sexualize the conversation from that point onward, by coyly asking:
“What else do you think tastes good?”
Comment On What she’s Doing
If you are ever stuck for a conversation starter, comment on what the girl is 
actually physically doing with her body.  A good example is:
“I like the way you play with your hair.  You look so cute…are you coming on to me or 
just trying to come up with a new hairstyle?”
Or
“Your ears wiggle just a little bit when you laugh.  No, don’t be embarrassed!  I think 
that’s so adorable.  Have you ever noticed that?”
Or
“Don’t bite your nails!  Your hands are pretty the way they are.  Besides, I have 
something far more interesting for you to bite!”
If she is sitting there swinging her foot, mention how she didn’t mention that she plays soccer on her 
profile.  If she is wearing a lot of one color (such as a red dress and red lipstick) mention how you didn’t 
know that red was a favorite color of hers – or if she mentioned liking the color red, tell her you like how 
she stays true to what she loves.
Body Language
Didn’t I tell you earlier that there would be a whole lot of body language talk in this damn book?  
There’s a reason for this: body language says everything without anything needing to be said.  You will 
know just from looking at the angle of her foot whether or not you have to step your game up.
This segment is about reading her body language and mastering your own to create solid, hot 
attraction between the two of you.
How To Tell A Girl Is Interested
It’s not all too difficult to tell when a girl is digging you, though lots of guys are dumb enough to 
think that a chick with her back to them is STILL INTERESTED IN HIM.  Not so, you dumbass.  It’s also 
important to recognize that girls are extremely good at faking things  What they say may sound as if 
they’re interested in you, but read her body language.  Her body language will tell you whether or not 
she’s lying.  So without further adieu:

*	 A girl is interested if she reinitiates conversation with you once you stop talking 
(which should not be for long)
*	 If she giggles, a genuine giggle, she’s interested
*	 If she touches you at all, this is a telling sign that she is interested (girls are usually 
not so free with who they touch)
*	 If she’s looking for more common interests, she’s interested
*	 If she smiles at you, a genuine smile, she’s interested (look for any tenseness in her 
lips that may suggest she’s forcing the smile)
*	 If she compliments you at all, she’s interested
*	 If she is playful and sets up small challenges, she’s interested
*	 If she disagrees with you in a playful manner, she’s interested
*	 If she’s punching your arm lightly (A FORM OF TOUCH!), she’s interested
*	 If she has adopted any nickname for you – besides your screen name – she’s 
interested.  Hell, she took the time to actually think of one.  Be flattered!
*	 If her leg touches yours and she does not withdraw after several minutes, she’s 
interested
*	 If you say that you like something, and she states that she likes it too
*	 If she needs instruction on how to do something (i.e. I’d love to golf, but I just don’t 
know how to hold the putter!), she’s interested – she wants YOU to show her.
*	 When ever she says or does anything, she’s quick to glance at you to check for your 
approval and/or reaction.
*	 She calls you a player
*	 She calls you a heartbreaker
*	 She tries to build a rapport with you and forge some type of comfort with you
*	 If you move, she follows you and/or waits for you to return
*	 She does not retract when you move in closer to her
*	 She does not resist when you touch her; or, when touching her, she states “I don’t 
want you to think I’m a slut”.
How To Tell A Girl Is NOT Interested
Ahh, this one hurts.  But it is perhaps more important to memorize these signs so as to know when 
to cut your losses.  Some of the signs to look out for are:
*	 Look for any face touching.  It is said that when a girl touches her face while she’s 
talking to you, she is lying.  
*	 She avoids eye contact at all costs
*	 She ignores you – continuously – and seems distant
*	 She does not contribute to the conversation at all.  She appears completely 
disconnected
*	 She becomes impatient with you and your well-intentioned efforts
*	 She looks away a lot and appears distracted
*	 She leans away, crosses her arms, turns her back, or even initiates a conversation 
with someone else
*	 She simply agrees or nods to everything you say.  There is zero input on her part
*	 If you move, she does NOT move
*	 If she yawns without immediately apologizes or seeming embarassed
*	 If she is nodding excessively and/or saying “mhmm” or “uh huh” to everything you 
say – again, zero input.
*	 If her feet, when standing, are pointed towards the door.  The feet are the furthest 
body part from our brain, so they tend to follow our subconscious desires rather 
than cues that we consciously direct.

Chapter 12 - The First Date
My take on any of these signals is this: GET THE FUCK OUT.  Don’t waste your time on some girl 
who clearly isn’t impressed by you.  Forget that!  Leave as soon as possible and move on to the 
next target to conquer or risk humiliating yourself and looking like a jackass in front of her and your 
friends.
Monitoring Your Own Body Language
First and foremost, I’ve got to stress that your body must always be pointed in her direction.  Head, 
shoulders, hips, feet – all aimed at her.  Even if there is some other hot piece in the other corner of 
the room, wait until your date is over to go and then talk to that girl.  Focus on the target at hand.
*	 Pay attention to your arms.  Your arms should never be crossed, except in jest 
when you are “displeased” by something that she says.  Keep them down or on the 
table.  Be sure that your hands are also never clenched.  Either just keep them open 
(you may need to, just to air them out so they don’t get TOO sweaty and nasty) or 
intertwine your fingers and rest them in front of you.
*	 Pay attention to your legs.  Be sure that your feet are pointed towards her.  Keep 
your legs slightly spread, but not so much so you may be doing a “spread eagle” 
(NOT ATTRACTIVE) and try to prevent yourself from crossing them if you are a leg 
crosser.  Hell, you want to give her a chance to glimpse at the goods while you’re on 
the date, don’t you?
*	 Pay attention to your head.  Make sure your head is straight and pointed at her.  Be 
sure that your chin is on more of an upwards tilt than a downwards tilt.  Also be sure 
that you actually do move your head from time to time to reflect “expressiveness” – 
you don’t want to look like stiff.
*	 Pay attention to your shoulders.  Your shoulders guide you, and they should 
always be pointed towards who you are interested in.  And for the love of god, DO 
NOT SLOUCH!  Keep a good posture, for fucksakes.  No one wants to be dating a 
humpback.  Shoulders up too high indicate you are tense.
*	 Lean forward and retain eye contact.  This shows you’re interested and listening
*	 Mirror your date’s behavior.  Seriously, this works great on a subconscious level.  If 
you start imitating your date’s behavior, somewhere in the depths of her mind she’ll 
will pick up on this and think that you and she have a lot in common because you 
react similarly to whatever the hell’s being said or whatever’s going on.  Don’t make 
it blatantly obvious, otherwise you’ll just look like a psychotic creep.
With these things in mind, you should be able to further coerce your chosen woman into your 
apartment.
Practice Good CHI:  Charm, Humor, And Intelligence
Chi (pronounced chee and also spelled qi or ch’i) (definition): is energy - the life giving energy that 
unites body, mind and spirit.
In this case, what we want to unite is you and your date!  You will be energy.  You will be the life 
force that she recognizes she has been missing all of her life.  All you need to do is practice your 
Charm, Humor and Intelligence.
That’s right, practice your intelligence.  Fear not, this does not require you enrolling in university 
again or trying to complete your high school diploma.
Charm
No, believe it or not, that jackass George Clooney was not BORN with charm – it is a learned art that 
The Dating Commando

 Chapter 12 - The First Date
takes development and practice over time.  
Many men have told me that they have no idea what the hell charm even IS.  Is 
it being nice?  Is it smiling and not bringing up controversial topics?  Just what IS 
this charm shit and why is it so highly acclaimed?
Charm is, quite simply, projecing an attractive personality.  Sure, every person 
is attracted to different things, but there are some general rules to go by that are 
universally recognized as someone being charming.
Believe it or not, I have already taught you how to be moderately charming up to 
this point.  Be relaxed, don’t be stiff!  Be sure to look whoever you are talking to in 
the eyes, but don’t STARE them down; smile with your eyes and your mouth.  As I 
suggested earlier, practice this shit in the goddamn mirror.  Take a shot of whiskey 
if that helps you feel any less of a fool for doing it.
A general rule to charm (this hopefully does not apply to your date) is to remember peoples’ names.  
Be sure that, before you go on this first date, you know her REAL goddamn name.  No, this does not 
mean her SCREEN NAME, I mean her REAL NAME.  If it’s a hard one to say, practice it a few times...
she’ll be impressed that you got it while most don’t.  You’ll score extra points if you remember the 
name of her mom, her dog, her best friend, her worst enemy – whoever she’s mentioned.  I hope 
you made some notes about them so you can use their names.  Don’t ever mention the names if you 
stalked her Facebook account to find them.  Make sure she has mentioned them to you.  This means 
that you bothered to listen to her, and bothered to invest some time thinking about her situation with 
and relation to whomever it is.  You can then drop awesome lines like:
“How’s Ashley doing?  I remember you telling me that she just broke up with her 
boyfriend – what’s his name again?”
SCORE!  Added bonus: the girl will undoubtedly mention to Ashley that you remembered her and her 
situation, and then Ashley will also like you.  Getting friend approval is huge for women.  Work for it!
Another aspect of charm, as I hope you learned in previous chapters, is to be interested in your date 
and her daily events, her family, her friends – everything.  Again, let her fuckin’ talk, man!  She will 
love you for letting her vent or just ramble on about whatever it is that she needs to get off of her 
chest, especially if you occasionally make helpful comments on what she’s telling you.
“You mentioned that your dad was in the hospital.  How is he doing now?”  (for extra 
points, if you have a car, suggest dropping her off for a visit some time and then 
taking her out for dinner afterwards).
Another great way to be charming is to draw out say, a hobby of hers, continuing to ask more 
questions:
“Scrapbooking?  How do you plan out where to put the pictures?  Where do you get 
your materials from?  I hear some people make a living from doing it – you ever 
consider doing that?”
Here’s another way to definitely set you apart from the gender femalia as a man’s man:  Do not 
indulge in negative gossip.  Choose to bring up POSITIVE aspects about a person or a situation rather 
than tear whoever or whatever down.  You come across as being sincere, and also as a positive force 
in her life.  Girls LOVE having someone positive in their life, since they often are so self conscious and 
jealous themselves.  Prove that you can be the guy to keep the sun shining in their lives and they will 
never let you go.
Now, if the girl for any reason should compliment you, be sure to accept these compliments with

and spirit.

Chapter 12 - The First Date
grace and modesty.  You can actually turn the compliment you receive as a compliment for them, 
once again making the girl feel positive and valued (to put it simply, you’re making her feel good).  For 
example, she may compliment you on your choice of words on a certain subject.  You say:
“Oh, well thanks.  Very few people would have noticed.”
Or, if she compliments you on your choice of shirt or cologne:
“Thank you.  I picked it out because I thought you would like it.”
Another big part to being charming is to control your freakin’ voice.  Yeah, I’m sure you’re pumped 
and extremely excitable, granted that you’re on the first date you’ve had in two years, but you need 
to keep it DOWN.  Be very conscious of how your voice sounds, the intonations you’re using, and if the 
volume is appropriate for the situation.  In a bar, yes, you may need to shout.  But in a restaurant or 
coffee shop yelling at her is unnecessary:
“I REALLY LIKE THAT DRESS YOU’RE WEARING!”
Instead, keep it cool and say, 
“I really like that dress you’re wearing.”
Feel the difference?  Speaking too quietly is also a sign of weakness and can seem effeminate and 
insecure, qualities that women want no part of in any man she’s seeing.
Charm also involves manners and etiquette.  No, you do not need to know what each utensil is for 
(please, none of us know why we’re given 5 fucking spoons when only one course involves SOUP) but 
it does mean using polite phrases, such as:
“Thank you”
“Please...”
“Excuse me…”
“Pardon me…”
“May I…”
“Allow me…”
“Thank you” is better than “thanks”.  “Pardon me” is better than, “Can you move over?”  “May I” is 
far more polite than “Can I” and “Allow me” is better than “let me”.  And you can never go wrong with 
a well placed “Please.”  Even the trashiest trailer park skank appreciates a little charm.
NOTE:  Don’t riddle everything with polite phrases.  You don’t want to seem like a stiff bastard from 
the Victorian era.  Those guys didn’t get laid EVER!  Only spanked!  I’m surprised humanity pulled out 
of that era alive…
Lastly, to be charming, you mustn’t complain.  Yes, I know, she’s probably been bitching for the 
past hour, but that doesn’t mean that you SHOULD.  Trust me; she does NOT want to hear it.  Your 
bitching will only turn you into a negative force, which she has enough of in her life (herself).   If you 
are talking about your day, be sure not to tell her how much it sucked; instead, make some keen and 
enlightened observations.  Save your bitching for later in case she’s bad in bed.
Humor
If you’re not a funny guy, start watching funny movies and reading humorous books.  If you have 
any funny friends (I bet you do) start hanging out with them more often.  Don’t tell them that you’re 
observing their style, just do it on the down-low.

 Chapter 12 - The First Date
Some scientist once said that exercise stimulates the mind and can also increase the sense of humor.  
I don’t know how true that is, given how many whale-like professional comedians there are out there, 
but hey, it’s worth a try.  Girls dig a dude who exercises too, so you can’t lose.
Humor is so good because it makes people laugh.  Laughter makes people feel good about everything 
in general, including themselves.  Science tells us that laughter enhances the flow of feel-good 
neurotransmitters in our brain.  Laughter is a time-out from the daily drag.  If you’re looking for me to 
tell you how to train yourself to be funny, I can’t.  Everyone has their own unique brand of humor.  But 
a good way to start is to not take things too seriously.  When something bad happens, make a joke 
out of it.  If you can only come up with some lame, horrible joke, then be sure to acknowledge that it’s 
lame by using a silly tone of voice, or using a facial expression to show you know what you said was 
dumb.
And for the love of God, I am NOT suggesting you become a walking, talking Mr. Rogers who is so 
super-positive that he makes Tom Cruise look like Oscar the Grouch.  Don’t make me barf!  I’m just 
saying it’s okay to have a shitty day, and you can tell her it’s been a shitty day, but move on quick and 
fast and try to be fun.  The film director John Houston used to say “It’s been a good day, nobody died.” 
And he meant it!  Literally.  More people died making his films than all the wars combined.  Now that 
shit is funny!
Become A Master “Tease-Her”
Teasing is another great way to be funny, but by teasing I don’t mean the shit that your brother and 
sister did to you when you were younger.  Teasing shouldn’t be mean, but rather gentle and silly.  Pro-
teasers will use teasing to bring out the best in someone, or to draw out the other person’s funnybone 
skills.  Some examples of good teasing are:
“Oh c’mon, I bet you can’t put your ankles behind your ears”
 (Okay, maybe this is a bit too risqué for some…)
“There’s no way you’re going to eat that duck tongue.  You don’t have the guts!”
(This got me laid after taking a hot Asian number for dim sum after we met online.  Apparently any 
mention of tongue really turned her on!)
“I bet you can’t beat me to the front counter; those pants are too tight, too restrictive. 
They’re holding you back and will need to come off.”
(Used this one at a bank with a random girl.  She took off the pants a couple hours later – in my 
condo!)
If you are in a group of girls out in public, a good strategy to use is to, well, IGNORE her.  Yes, that’s 
right, you heard me: IGNORE HER.  You say something, the girl of interest makes a comment, and you 
simply say, 
“I didn’t ask you” or “Wait your turn, missy!”
Try pretending that you are speaking to her group of friends and ignoring her.  I LOVE pitting the 
girl’s friends against her!  This works really well, since it gives the false impression that you are 
actually paying attention to the girls’ friends more than her.  To be honest, it’s knocking her ass down 
a peg, so she’s coming down to YOUR level (admit it; she was in a higher league.  It’s okay).
Here’s an example of pitting her friends against her:
ME: …right?  
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online
www.Ebook777.com

160
Chapter 12 - The First Date
HER: Oh come on!  There’s no way.
ME: Uhh, let me finish!  [Turn to her friends]  She really likes to interrupt, doesn’t 
she?
One of my favorite teases are reserved for models, since they already have such high self esteem and 
think that they are a 10++ on the league scale:
HER:  I’m a model (she gives a “can’t you TELL?” look)
ME: (roll my eyes) Oh yeah!  I thought I recognized you… you modeled the oven mitts 
in IKEA’s spring 2007 catalogue, didn’t you?  Your hands looked GREAT in those things.
If you say something incredulous and silly, and she reacts appropriately, you can say something along 
the lines of:
“Oh man, thank God you got that.  That was just a little test to see if you have a mind 
of your own or if you just believe whatever any guy in this place tells you.”
Another form of teasing is to use false statements of the reverse psychology kind.  If you feign 
disinterest or disapproval of her with these statements, and do it with a light touch, she’ll likely start 
to think of you as someone who may be better than her and that she needs to prove herself to you.  
Some examples of false statements to boost your value are:
•	
I just can’t see it working out between us.
•	
Here’s your pink slip.  Now get out.
•	
You’re just too nice for me
•	
Jeez, I can already tell – we are NOT going to get along at all
•	
I think that guy… yeah, THAT guy over there… he looks perfect for you
•	
That’s it, we’re so done.  I want my Beastie Boys CD back!
•	
Let’s just be friends
Use these only if you know you already have some cred with the girl and you’re certain you need the 
extra help to get past that snooty “won’t give you the time of day” arrogance.  She’ll work harder to 
prove you’re wrong.  If you’re already doing well with her, these lines just might really piss her off and 
make you out as some sort of douchey asshole who deserves a bit of a bitch slap.
Exaggerating Stories And Scenarios
This is bringing us back all the way back to Chapter 7: By making ridiculous comparisons in your 
story telling and making them larger than life, you’ll get her attention.  The girl will be drawn into 
asking equally ridiculous questions about your blown-up story and will find it fun and challenging 
to keep up with you.  She’ll also probably try to match your silliness, which is sure to bring out the 
smiles.  Either that or she’s too stupid to figure it out and well...she shouldn’t be too much of a 
challenge for you.
Your story doesn’t even necessarily have to be true at this point.  As long as it’s goofy and outlandish 
enough, she’s sure to pay attention.  There’s always that mystique of it being real, and even if it’s not, 
it should be fun to imagine if it was.
Being Appropriately Inappropriate
Being cleverly inappropriate is fantastic, though there are, of course, different levels of inappropriate 
behavior.  You have to find a way to be appropriately inappropriate.  Every girl has a limit; you just 
have to work slowly and gently to find where that limit is.  Sexualizing the conversation is definitely 
the best way of being inappropriate, as we covered in Chapter 9.  So we’ll explore some other 
The Dating Commando

161
 Chapter 12 - The First Date
methods of how to be inappropriate here.
 How can you test the waters to see how inappropriate you are allowed to be with this girl?  Say 
something that is a bit offbeat, but stay away from any racial remarks.  I know this is awful to say, but 
I had the most success when gently insulting OTHER girls where ever we were (it seemed to make the 
girl feel better about herself).  For instance, I’d comment on how some strangers’ Apple Bottom jeans 
should really be called Watermelon Bottom jeans.  Yes, it’s a lame comment, but it 
had the girl snorting at my lameness and also appreciating how I clearly found her 
own ass to be nowhere near watermelon proportions.
You can step up from that point to something like trying to curse at people in a 
different language, or asking them how to.  Then you have to go around and try 
out the curse word or words.  Just be sure not to overdo it – you don’t want any of 
your game skills to be played out with a slap in the mug.
Once again, step it up.  Make a comment later on about how she isn’t really your 
type but you’ll make an exception.  Here’s one example:
“You’re not really my type, y’know.  I usually go for girls who resemble two-by-fours 
[if you’re in person, look her up and down, gazing just a second longer at her breasts] 
but you’ll definitely do.”
Or if you are going for a skinnier girl:
“You’re not really my type.  The girls I often chase I can hunt down quick… hogs don’t 
move so fast.”
Yes, these are awful.  But they’re examples of how you can push the boundaries of being 
inappropriate.  And for crying out loud, make sure you’ve got at least a bit of a reporte going with her 
before you try this shit.  You don’t want to scare her off before you’ve even had a chance to introduce 
yourself.
Intelligence
Before I go any further into this topic, if she hasn’t clued in that you are intelligent by your charm 
and humor, and then re-read those sections and TRY AGAIN.  Charm shows class; humor is a strong 
indicator for intelligence (it takes some quick wit and keen observational skills to be funny).
Now when I say intelligence, I do not mean this:
“Oh, yes, I graduated from PRINCETON and earned my Bachelors in law.  Oh, did I 
mention that I minored in pre-med?  Oh yes, and then for my major I…”
YAWN!
If there’s one thing I’ve learned, going to school and getting a degree does NOT make you smarter.  
Actually, the douche bag ratio of guys who went to school and those who never finished it is about 
4:1.  
Here’s another example of what NOT to do:
“I have an IQ of 160.  Did I tell you I received an invite from Mensa?  I turned them 
down.”
Yeah… no one gives a flying fuck.

Chapter 12 - The First Date
Here’s the thing: you can say you’re intelligent and have a ton of diplomas on your wall.  But until 
you demonstrate that you are intelligent, NO ONE CARES!  Especially girls.  Only the money grubbing 
golddiggers may care about the diplomas on your wall – IF the diplomas spell C-A-S-H (no, I don’t 
mean LITERALLY, dumbass).  Besides, diplomas and boasts about Mensa can be intimidating to her.  
You risk scaring her off rather than impressing her...and how smart is that Brainiac?
I’ll go over the two types of intelligence that are important here: the IQ, and the EQ.  Both play an 
important role in impressing a chick, so listen up if you want any chance at her pooty-tang.
The IQ
I don’t think I really need to explain what IQ is.  But smart guys often have a really hard time 
showing that they’re actually intelligent!  They studied so hard, they lost their spontaneity.
 Think about how many times you’ve messaged or talked to a girl, explaining some smart 
accomplishment of yours – like finishing some project at work that you have been working on for 
weeks.  Did she drift off and begin snoring?  Probably. That’s because you did not frame and present 
your material properly.
Problem Solving IQ
Perhaps one of the best ways to show your intelligence is to show your problem solving skills.  
Remember those stupid problem solving questions we had to answer back in school?  There was a 
purpose to those, guys – to help you get LAID.  So let’s say you’re sitting with your date, and you’re 
hyped up from getting that 30 day budget finished a couple of days early, and that you had to jump 
through a million hoops and figure out why there was a deficit, blahblahblah…
YOU: Oh man, today is a great day.  Not only do I get to sit here and relax with you, 
but I can take it easy and be lazy at work for the next couple of days!
HER: Yeah?  I know I’m going to be working my ass off.  How’d you get so lucky?
YOU: Ugh… well I work with an accounting firm, right?  Yeah, I know, boring… I’ll 
try to make this painless.  Well my boss is just… oh man, he’s the worst.  Remember 
Newman from Seinfeld?  Picture that sweaty, uncomfortable man being your manager.  
He completely messed up the budget for this large, prestigious company we work for… 
I picked up the slack, though, and fixed all of his mistakes.  It took me about 30 days 
of hard work to do it, but I was able to find them and correct them.  I swear some 
managers should NOT be managers - like maybe yours?  Why are you going to be 
working your ass off?
One: you showed that you corrected someone who is higher up than you, which makes her think 
maybe you’ll get a promotion?  $$$!!!  Two: You made it colorful with the funny Newman-Seinfeld 
reference. And  three: At the end there, you switched the conversation BACK to her – so even if 
she was a bit bored by your accomplishment (that bitch) she won’t realize it since you switched the 
conversation back to HER, who is, of course, the most interesting person on the planet (insert eye roll 
here).
It’s also a great idea to use your problem solving skills to creatively help her.  She will undoubtedly 
bring up some sort of dramatic event that is going on, or some issue, where you can offer some gentle 
and well thought out solutions.  
HER: And this is why you should never go into business with your friend!  You end 
up doing all of the work, and not being able to say a damn thing to them about it, 
otherwise your friendship is toast.

 Chapter 12 - The First Date
YOU: Oh man, that’s tough, but I think you can get through to her.  Have you 
delegated any tasks to her, like, ask her to do the books for the day and you do the 
clean up?
HER: [head nod] But then she doesn’t actually get it done on time so I end up 
spending MY night doing it.
YOU: I think you need to put the pressure on a bit more; you’re taking on all of the 
stress and the work!   I mean, obviously you’re a very strong person – I don’t know 
how you do it – but eventually too much is too much, right?  
HER: True…
YOU: Go home early tomorrow.  [Incredulous look from her] No, seriously; do it.  One 
day of you going home early is not going to make or break your business.  But you 
know what it will do?  It’ll make her realize just how hard it IS to run this business 
alone – which is essentially what you have been doing.  Call her at the end of the day 
to see how it went.  When she starts bitching about how hard it was, start bringing up 
some good examples of how you feel you have been left alone with the business.  Pre-
plan what you’re going to say, too; that way you can get her at all angles.
HER: You really think that’s a good idea?
YOU: Yeah, I did that once when I worked with my dad and brother in our family 
business.  TOTALLY worked.  And hey, if you have nothing to do when you leave 
early, I’d love to take you out for lunch or a coffee!  You have a lot on your plate and 
definitely deserved some relaxing “you” time.
See how you snuck in that date suggestion there?  I had this exact conversation with a girl.  I got 
that second date, though it may very well be considered part of the first one.  She stayed over that 
night and ended up just not going in to work at all.  Cha-ching!
Show Your Skills
Another way to show your intelligence is to prove that you are handy.  Is she having car problems?  
Help her out.  Does she need help with her furniture or something electrical?  Help her out.  Doing 
something as simple as putting up freakin’ SHELVES or unclogging her sink will go a long way to prove 
that you are smart (because you are a “jack of all trades”) and that you are valuable to keep around.
Even rearranging her furniture to give her more space or suggesting that you do little fixes around 
her place (filling a hole or fixing a door handle) will increase your value to her.  As an added bonus, it 
gets you in her house!  You know where to take it from there… (Or at least you WILL after you read 
this book).
Yeah, you may not feel like putting up her shelves, but trust me, her watching you do some kind of

Chapter 12 - The First Date
physical labor FOR HER is a huge turn on.  It’s masculine to them; so just suck it up and do it.  You 
can be lazy later (and let’s be real here, you can probably use the mental and physical work out).
Spelling & Grammar Check Skills
This was brought up in an earlier chapter: when messaging a girl, be sure to use proper ENGLISH.  
Don’t use “u” for “you” or “l8r” for “later” (how dumb is that shit?).  This has to carry on through to 
your actual verbal skills as well.  She can get away with the dumbest shit, you can’t.
If you meet this girl for the first time and you say shit like, “Hey yo babe, fo-shiz how is you be 
doin’?”  She’s going to either laugh because she thinks that someone who sounds so dumb must be 
JOKING, or she’s going to spin on her heel and trot her fine ass outta there ASAP.  The girls who think 
that kind of talk is cool, you don’t want to know for anything other than sex. 
Again, it doesn’t matter how shitty her grammar is, all that matters is how GOOD your skills are.
Do not say “how is you” no matter how hip it may be to use poor grammar in hip-hop songs lately.  
Say, “How are you.”  Do not say, “S’up?”  Say, “How has your day been?”.  Do not say “Chillin” or 
“chillaxin” or “maxin’ and relaxin”, say, “I’ve had an easy day”.
In case you’re missing the point here, here’s a list of things you should NOT say and what you 
SHOULD say instead:
DUMB WORDS AND PHRASES
SMART WORDS AND PHRASES
How’s it hangin’?
How are you?
You be lookin’ fine/phat/hot!
I really like that dress you’re wearing.
‘sup?
What have you been up to?
Conversating (or Conversatin’)
(This isn’t a damned word!) Conversing, 
conversation, speaking with, talking to...
I gifted them this nice TV
(This isn’t a damned word!) I gave them...I 
presented them with...I bought them a...
Addiciting
Addictive
Word (or Word Up)
Right.  I agree.  Hello.
Shizzle (as in fo’ shizzle)
Sure.  Shit
Irregardless
(This isn’t a damned word!) Regardless of...
I gotta bounce
I have to leave.  I have to go.
That was so gangstah
That was so awesome!
Funner
More fun.
Some general rules to follow are:
1)	 Did you hear the word or phrase in a rap song or in a popular song on the radio?  Yes?  AVOID 
IT.
2)	 Do you remember learning that word in grade school?  Yes?  USE IT.
3)	 Do you feel 100% confident using that big word with over 3 syllables, or are you just guessing 
that you’re using it in the correct context?  If you’re not sure, AVOID IT.  It’s always better to 
use a simplified word or phrase to properly convey a thought or feeling than a big word that 
you are probably using incorrectly.
4)	 Can you spell the word?  No?  AVOID IT.
The Dating Commando

165
 Chapter 12 - The First Date
5)	 Can you even pronounce the damn word correctly?  No?  FUCK OFF.
The Case Of The “Uhhs”, The “Umms” And The “I Don’t Knows”
Maybe this is just a pet peeve of mine, but I’ve met enough girls to know that a guy who is plagued 
with “uhhs” and “errr” and “umms” in his conversations (or dare I say, “conversatings”) is a guy who 
isn’t about to get any ass.
Using these sorts of pauses in your speech, UNLESS they are used for dramatic effect (which is a rare 
occasion) makes you seem unsure.  They also make you sound very dumb.  Saying “I don’t know” 
DEFINITELY makes you look dumb.  Using these also makes it appear as if the sentence you are 
using is not thought out, which makes HER, in turn, feel as if she is not worthy of a quality response 
from you.
If she asks you a question, have an opinion.  NEVER say “I don’t know.”  NEVER begin a sentence 
with “I don’t know” and then begin to give your opinion (she HATES it when you do that!).
If you need to take an extra second or two to formulate a good, quality response, TAKE IT.  This isn’t 
to say that you should sit there in silence, humming and hawing for an entire minute making her wait 
for an answer about what your favorite fucking food is.  The pause has to be equivalent to the gravity 
of the question.
Low Gravity Questions:
•	
What do you like to do for fun?
•	
Where did you grow up?
•	
What did you think about the newest Transformers movie?
•	
How long have you been in the area?
•	
What do you think of your pasta?
•	
What’s your favorite part about living in this city?
High Gravity Questions:
•	
Why do you think African children die from Malaria whereas it is nearly 
unfounded in North America?
•	
Do you agree with the free trade agreement?
•	
Should the IMF (International Monetary Fun) forgive all debts for third world 
countries?
•	
What do you think about Obama’s current healthcare reform?
•	
Do you think that the whole September 11th or 9/11 debacle was an inside job?
Do you see the difference between the content of both sets of questions?  If it takes you even a few 
seconds to tell her what your favorite part of the city is, you’re fucked.  If it takes you a minute or 
two to come up with some sort of response to the high gravity questions, however, this is going to be 
perfectly acceptable.  They are thoughtful questions; your favorite food isn’t all that thoughtful.
The EQ
Ahh, now here’s the one that you as a man probably have not heard of.  But I guarantee you that 
your date, your mom and your sister are all familiar with the EQ.  Here’s what it is:
EQ (definition): Emotional quotient, a metric similar to IQ but measuring one’s perception of 
emotions
Did you hear that?  EMOTIONAL.  Chicks really dig this one, though you probably already gathered 
that when you realized FEELINGS were involved.
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online

166
Chapter 12 - The First Date
The EQ isn’t an exact science, but it certainly is some trendy new bullshit that has girls creaming 
their pants.  They, of course, think that the EQ is extremely important.  I’m going to take the model 
that some guy named Daniel Goleman1 came up with, because this is the most well understood 
understanding of the emotional quotient – meaning this is probably what the girls think EQ means.
The EQ consists of four parts:
1 - Self-awareness: the ability to read the girls’ emotions and recognize the 
impact on her while also using those “gut feelings” or, dare I say, “intuition” to 
guide decisions.  Take body language, her actions and the tone of her voice before 
you take her actual words literally.
2 - Self-management: this one is all about being able to control your desires, 
impulses and emotions in an environment that’s changing.  So all because you 
get her into your bedroom, it doesn’t mean you should then pounce on her as if 
you’re a lion and she’s the prey.  It’s about adapting to her emotional states in a 
balanced, positive way no matter what the time or place.
3 - Social awareness: the ability to sense, comprehend, and react appropriately to others’ emotions 
while understanding the surroundings or involved social networks.  This includes, for instance, 
involving her friends in any conversations (if you are speaking to her in person) and doing so in a way 
that is sensitive to who they are and where they’re coming from.  It’s also being aware of that guy 
over your shoulder who’s also trying to mack on your target.
4 - Relationship management: the ability to inspire, influence, and develop others while still 
managing conflict.  Handling this one well means that in spite having a bad day at work, you put on 
your game face when you come to see the girl and you talk about HER day rather than YOUR shitty 
day.  This also involves not cursing like a sailor when stressed.
As you can imagine, the more you appear to be in tune with a girl emotionally, the more she’ll love 
you for it.  Ever heard of the word empathy?  Use it often with women.  They want you to relate to 
their feelings and understand them (you can totally fake this shit, by the way with a sympathetic head 
nod and gentle hand caress.  If you find you’re faking it a LOT, man you in da wrong relationship.).
TIP:  If you want to appear very intelligent, just shut the hell up.  Silence makes you appear pensive, 
contemplative, and deep – and it keeps you from saying some really dumbass shit!  As a bonus, if 
you’re quiet, the girl will feel as if she needs to work harder for you. Worst case: “Better to remain 
silent and be thought a fool than to speak up and remove all doubt.”
Intelligence does not mean book smarts alone.  Intellectual intelligence and emotional intelligence 
are what you want to aim for.  The latter involves developing your capacity for empathy; being 
sensitive to what your partner is feeling.  Never underestimate that capacity.  A relationship is pretty 
much doomed without it.

Chapter Conclusion
Shut your mouth and let the girl do most of the talking.  The less you say, the more intelligent 
you appear – AND the harder she will think she has to work for you.
Pay attention to her body language to see how well the date is going.  Body language is 93% 
of our conversations!  Check in with your own body language from time to time to be sure that 
you are sending out the right signals.
Be charming, be humorous, and at least TRY to appear intelligent.

Chapter 13 - Get Your Sex On
S
o you finally got a woman to accompany you home.  I TOLD you that this book would work 
wonders for you!  If you’re like most men you probably don’t have a clue in hell as to what 
to do with her when she walks through the door and are praying that she does and will guide you 
through it.
Many guys get the girl into the apartment, but they don’t actually get into her (if I dare be so blunt).
So what do you do?  How can you be sure that she’ll stick around?  Read on, young Adonis, and ye 
shall find success because I’m sharing a chapter taken from my Master Course.
How To Prepare Your Home For Her
That’s right, the foreplay begins before you even MEET her for the date!
Look, I’m a dude, and I’ve been around enough OTHER dudes to be able to tell you that we’re all 
fuckin’ disgusting.  We leave the seat up (they like it down by the way), leave piss in the toilet, and 
leave little shaving hairs all around the sink.  We seem to be blind to mold and dirt and that weird brown 
shit that gets stuck to the side of the tub and in the corners of the floor.
The washroom is extremely important to keep clean.  It’s an area OF cleanliness, 
so it should also APPEAR to be an area of cleanliness.  Break out the Vim, Lysol, 
some gloves and a toilet brush, because you want your porcelain to be pearly and 
your shower to be shining.  *BLING!*  Try cleaning the mirror every once in a 
while, too; no one likes that toothpaste spit shit that always seems to end up on 
there and on the faucets.  Oh sure, it’s fuckin’ funny now that I bring it up...but it 
won’t be when she steps in there and sees this crap all over the place.
The next room on the cleanliness hit list: the kitchen.  Don’t leave a pile of dirty 
dishes in the sink. Wipe down the counters!  If you have any stuck-on spills in the 
fridge, clean that shit up too.  I don’t mean to sound like your mother, but don’t be 
a gross pig.  Ants and mice will invade.  She’ll see ‘em. Game over.
Oh yeah, be sure that you have some good snacking stuff in that fridge and some 
breakfast foods.  Bacon, fruit, and some juice will come in handy when she stays 
overnight (and be sure that stuff hasn’t gone bad!).  Women don’t want to come 
over and snack on pickles and mustard, okay?  And don’t forget the wine.  As 
mentioned earlier, women like wine and prefer it over beer.  Plus, having wine also makes you APPEAR 
classier (though you and I both know better).
Now we move on to the living room, the room where you will probably commence your vaunted 
macking skills.  Again, practice basic cleanliness: vacuum, dust, and put things back where they belong.  
No woman wants to get it on if the room’s a pig sty.  You might want to use some FEBREEZE on the 
upholstery if your room smells a little funky.  Consider breaking out some candles and mirrors, and place 
them on the coffee table, window sills, and somewhere close to the entrance of your place.  You want 
your place to feel surrounded by candlelight.  Lightly surrounded, not lit up like a fucking Cathedral.
Another consideration you may want to make is the furniture arrangement.  Some guys I know just 
have a couple of single, overstuffed chairs in the room and they are usually spaced far apart.  If you’re 
bringing a date over, push them together or have them face each other.  Be sure that the coffee table 
isn’t so close that it seems stifling, but that it’s close enough for you or her to put a glass down on, or to

going to end up at 
your place, so it 
had better be clean 
and tidy.  Make

because she’ll be 
spending some time 
in there.

prop your feet up on.
Something that you may want to consider is throwing some overstuffed pillows on the ground in front 
of the TV, fireplace (if you’re lucky enough to have one) or a cozy corner that is fairly close to the main 
seating area.  You want to create an inviting place to mess around on, especially if the furniture that you 
currently have sucks ass.  The more you move around the room, the more she will feel inclined to move 
into OTHER rooms – if you catch my drift.
So let’s talk about this OTHER room: the bedroom.  This is your sanctuary, your area of refuge, the one 
place that should definitely be personalized to your tastes.  If it’s not, consider re-decorating, fucker.  I 
cannot stress this point enough: your bed is the focal point of the room and, as such, needs to be 
inviting.
In case you didn’t catch that, here it is again:  YOUR BED NEEDS TO BE INVITING.
An inviting bed includes:
•	
NICE bed sheets that are soft and modern.  They should preferably match the 
style or “feel” of the room.  If you can afford silk or Egyptian cotton with a 300 
thread count or whatever the hell that shit’s about, then do it. Are your sheets 
stained or funky smelling? You might as well let loose an 8.6 Richter scale fart.
•	
Pillows that are fluffed and well positioned
•	
A NICE, stuffed duvet/comforter
•	
A bed frame, preferably with a headboard 
•	
A decent mattress that isn’t sagging, and a box spring for the mattress to sit upon
•	
The bed has to be MADE!  Your ma taught you to do this at a young age for a 
REASON. Women are genetically programmed to feel nausea at the sight of an 
unmade bed.
A shitty bed includes:
•	
“Tired” looking bed sheets made of scratchy polyester blends
•	
Bed sheets that have superheroes and shit on them.  If you like Batman, that’s 
cool; but your bed doesn’t have to look like a goddamn 10 year old sleeps in it
•	
A bare mattress on the floor.  Hell, I bet you don’t want to sleep on that thing 
either!
•	
Only one pillow
•	
If it is a “single” bed that hardly even fits your ass
•	
One or more pillows of shitty, inferior quality
•	
Ugly bed sheets, bad color or pattern choice (if you have floral sheets because 
that’s what your mom bought for you, take that shit to your local thrift store for 
a grandma to enjoy)
•	
No pillow covers
•	
No mattress cover
•	
No bed frame
•	
A racecar bed
•	
A bunk bed
•	
A stinky bed – body odors, sweat, PERFUME from the last girl who was there.
•	
Obviously stained mattress (ew!)
In summary, your bed needs to look soft.  It needs to look fluffy.  It also needs to look large enough for 
both of you to fit on.  It needs to smell nice.  The goal here is to have your bed look good enough to just 
dive right into and have some wild fun on.
You also want to take a look at what you have on your walls.  You have posters of bitches with their 
titties hanging out?  Take ‘em down.  Naked women on your walls?  TAKE THEM DOWN.  Posters of 
musicians or movies that you like are allowed to stay, as these are generally non-threatening to most

women and also show your personality.  If you have some painting of Raggedy Anne that your mom 
made for you when you were 1 and have it up on your wall, you may want to consider taking that 
down for now.  Bring it out later when the girl will find it endearing – which is AFTER the first date.
Ideally, furniture items in any given room should be in decent shape with a matching color scheme.  
Make sure your clothes and shirts are folded and put away in drawers nicely so they aren’t hanging 
out of your dresser.  Don’t leave dirty laundry laying around where she’ll see it.  Make sure any porn 
that you have stashed ANY WHERE is put on a high, high shelf in a box that she is not going to be 
opening on the first date (she may be into that kind of thing, but her first foray into your bedroom is 
NOT the time to be having that discussion).
I like to either have some tea light candles set up in the bedroom or I’ll bring them in from the 
living room.  You don’t want to turn on the light in the room; it’s too stark and will make her feel too 
revealed when she starts undressing.  Stick to candles.  They’re also easy to blow out if she’s self 
conscious and wants to undress in the dark.  And most girls are self conscious and will likely insist the 
lights be out.  Let her have that one.
What Girls Hate About Men’s Apartments
I figured I’d give you a run down about what women generally hate about men’s apartments.  This 
list was compiled with the help of quite a number of women friends who were only too happy to 
participate.  I’ll ignore the obvious: being untidy and generally disorganized:
*	 The smell.  This isn’t to say that a man’s apartment stinks, per se, but some guys do have 
musty and musky apartments.  Some guys jog and workout and leave sweat drenched clothes 
and gear around, funkifying the atmosphere.  Some make the mistake of lighting incense 
when a girl enters the place.  Incense isn’t the smartest idea, since it also usually induces 
sneezing and the scent you thought smelled so great may very well not smell so good to her.  
Stay away from incense.  Sprinkle some baking soda on the carpet and vacuum it up after ten 
minutes or so.  She doesn’t expect your place to smell like flowers, but it should smell clean 
and lemony fresh. 
*	 Busted furniture.  If your furniture has seen better days, please replace it.  It’s a worthwhile 
investment!  If your couch doesn’t look so comfortable, she ain’t gonna wanna sit on it, never 
mind lay back on it to let you work your magic on her. 
*	 Busted carpet.  Yeah, okay, so if you’re renting, there’s no way you’re going to replace the 
whole goddamn carpet on YOUR dime.  But you may want to consider getting some area 
carpets to cover up any bare or ugly areas. 
*	 Bad paint jobs.  Have any chipped paint?  Repaint or cover it with something.
*	 The videogame console is THE CENTER of the room.  If your XBOX, or Wii or Playstation 
or whatever the hell you play with is hanging out there, she will instantly get the impression 
of what kind of guy you are: GAMER.  Chances are she isn’t as into videogames as you are, so 
tuck it away until she’s gone. 
*	 A barren apartment.  Guilty as charged!  Us men tend to be a bit more minimalist than 
women, and we don’t like putting nic-nacs up on the walls and decorating.  Take a bit of time 
TO decorate and be thoughtful about where you put your shelves.  I’m not saying that you 
need to run out and buy a bunch of useless shit to make your apartment look better, but take 
advantage of what you’ve got and put it on display!

Chapter 13 - Get Your Sex On
She’s Time Sensitive
I think it’s important to mention here that, from the moment you walk away from your first meeting 
with her, her internal slut timer starts ticking and counting down.  When the counter reaches “0”, she’ll 
retract from you and your advances out of fear of feeling like a slut.  Each woman has a different 
timer, but they all have one.  When the counter hits zero, you ain’t gettin’ any...and you’ll be instantly 
relegated to the dreaded GFS zone!
You’ve heard it, the “I can’t do this, you’ll think I’m a whore!” or “Oh god, no… I’m not a slut… I 
swear”.  This is her timer ticking down to the very last few seconds and time’s about to run out for 
you.
NOTE: By saying that her slut meter time sensitive, I am in NO WAY condoning you forcing yourself 
upon her at the earliest opportunity.  That’s incredibly uncool and will result in a much deserved slap 
to your face or a ride in a cop car.  Hang tight, sailor, because I’ll help you out here.
The more you sexualized the conversations, the more you practiced good body language and the 
more you practiced good touching, the more time you have added to the slut timer.  It is imperative 
that you execute these three things as well as possible to grab as much time as you possibly can.
As soon as you get the yes to going back to your place, do not start laying on the moves.  Behave, at 
least physically, the same way you had been the entire night.  When leaving the place you’re at, either 
guide her out by gently pressing on the small of her back, taking her hand, or playfully offering your 
arm for her to take.  Touch, but don’t touch in a perverse or impolite fashion.
This is the time to up the ante when it comes to sexualizing the conversation.  
This is not the time to say something stupid, like “Uhh, so what movie do you 
wanna watch?”.  Don’t ask what movie she wants to watch; she doesn’t know what 
goddamn movies you have.  Make suggestions instead: does she feel like laughing 
until she pees herself?  Being scared to the point of peeing herself?  Or perhaps 
watching someone get peed on (golden showers – it’s a porn-alluding joke, in case 
you didn’t get it).  
What I like to do when inviting a woman back to my place is to do palm readings.  
I don’t know the first fuckin’ thing about palm reading, but I can certainly bullshit 
my way through it.  And if she calls me on it, so what?  I make up some excuse 
about being an apprentice and by that time she’s usually laughing at the whole 
situation anyway.  Google some basics on palm reading.  The palm only has three 
main lines.  How hard can it be?
Palm reading is great because it allows you to work your creative muscle (brain) and it gives you the 
excuse to touch her hand, and to gently stroke her palm.  Stroking a woman’s palm is very calming 
to them, and also very pleasurable.  Try it on yourself; you like it too, don’t ya, big guy?  It keeps 
the physical and mental stimuli coming at her, which is what she needs to remain interested and 
DISTRACTED from the slut timer that will turn her into a spinster pumpkin at midnight.
Dancing is another good way to keep her distracted from the slut timer by stimulating her physically 
and mentally in an ‘acceptable’ way.  Ask her to come home and practice the Waltz with you, or Salsa,

Chapter 13 - Get Your Sex On
or whatever you hopefully learned after you read Chapter Eleven.  For girls with a very short timer, 
I’ve even danced with them back to my car in the parking lot or IN the parking lot.  Be sure to actually 
teach the girl moves, so her brain is focused on keeping in step with you.  Put on some music for 
added stimulation, and keep touching her body nicely so she can tell how warm and safe it is to be in 
your arms (Don’t say ‘yuck’, macho man.  This shit actually works!).
No matter WHAT your efforts, the girl may still whip out the whole, “I can’t, I’m not a slut” line on 
you.  Actually, bank on that happening, especially right before you get on top of her.  When a girl says 
that she’s not a slut, I tell her she’s beautiful and seal it with a kiss.  When a girl says she can’t, I tell 
her she’s beautiful and seal it with a kiss.  When a girl tells me she doesn’t usually do this, I tell her 
she’s beautiful and seal it with a kiss.
Notice a trend?
When a girl says “No” or “Stop”, you fuckin’ stop.  You have to, no matter how charged and excited 
you are.  “NO” and “STOP” are very different from the slut timer, alright?  The slut timer is usually 
her putting up a front to help pad her own conflicting feelings of desire and resistance; she really 
wants to do it, she just doesn’t want to feel guilty about it.  “NO” and “STOP” literally mean NO and 
STOP.  Back off, apologize if need be and ask her to hang out in your bed for a bit 
while you leave the room to go get something.  Offer to get her a drink of water 
or make tea or even get her a pickle if that’s all you have in your fridge (don’t say 
I didn’t warn you earlier in the chapter!).  You need to give her some time alone 
to regroup.  If you don’t, she’s going to blast out of there in embarrassment and 
shame (and you’ll probably never hear from her again).
Try to stay out of the room for a good 3-5 minutes.  You can also probably use the 
time to cool off and tame your mini me.  I usually make tea and a sandwich for the 
girl, even if she said she didn’t want anything.  These are comfort foods that will 
help her feel more at home with you, and make you seem safe.  Do not offer more 
alcohol, as she either has to drive back home soon or she will think you’re trying to 
take advantage of her.
No matter how much you wanted to stick it in her that night, showing yourself to 
be a true gentleman if she says no only increases your chances of getting a chance with HER on your 
second date (and trust me, if you play this part right, there WILL be a second date).
Erogenous Zones
Ever wonder what parts of the female form are most likely to get you laid?  If not, I’ll help you out, 
rookie.  I’ll start from the polled least favorite places on a woman’s body to the most favorite amongst 
women.
Behind The Knees
Surprised?  So was I.  But next time you doubt me and this information, ask to have your girl to 
tickle you behind the knees.  You like it, don’t you?  Soothing and soft, it’s both a calming sensation 
and an exciting sensation.  This definitely works well in the bedroom.
Feet
This is one that we all assume should be on the list, right?  How many women come in from a day at 
work and pout to have their feet rubbed?  This is a great way to initiate some kind of foreplay and get 
some.  Massaging the feet is extremely pleasurable, but so is kissing and sucking.  Try sucking on her 
toes some time and see how she feels.  Just pray to the good lord above that she washed!
Word of warning: a lot of girls are a bit self conscious about their feet, because they’re afraid they

may stink (and they very well MAY stink).  Ask before you ever go for the feet.  If she’s afraid of 
disgusting you with her foot odor, it will be an instant turn-off for her since she will be in defensive 
mode.
Inner Thighs
Oh yes, this area is particularly delicious if you have already been stimulating her pelvic area.  Don’t 
go diving right into this area right off the bat; she won’t find it pleasurable.  But if you lick, kiss and 
nibble your way up there after having spent a good 5 to 10 minutes pleasuring her elsewhere, she will 
definitely appreciate it.
This area is, obviously, a great way to forge a trail to her pussy.  Her thighs are a fantastic area for 
teasing, so take advantage of that.
Her Butt
Chicks dig it when you caress that underside of their ass cheeks – it seems to drive them wild, a lot 
more wild than spanking (though don’t get me wrong, spanking is great too).  
Her ass also invites kissing (yes, literally this time), sucking, and even penetration.  Yes, some chicks 
really DO dig anal penetration, whether it be by one of your WELL LUBRICATED fingers, penis, or god 
knows what else.  Before you enter that zone, though, be sure to ASK PERMISSION.  More often than 
not, a girl will tell you she ain’t all too comfortable with your plans and ask for you to back the fuck 
off.
But if she’s down, you have a winner.  Consider marrying this one, keeping in mind that a marriage 
built on a foundation of anal sex is not likely to set any longevity records.
Her Ears
Admit it, you like having your ears kissed, sucked, nibbled and breathed on, right?  Well then it 
should come to no surprise that she’s down with that shit too.  Some gentle hair pulling with any sort 
of ear lovin’ is also generally appreciated – just don’t yank her hair out of her head (yes, some guys 
have done that…fuckin’ idiots).
	
Ears are a great way to tease her before kissing her on her lips.  Pay attention to the ears before you 
pay attention to her lips for a truly tempting experience.
Her Breasts (Nipples Included)
Have you ever stared at those two milk bags on the front of your lady and acknowledged that, though 
they are appealing, you haven’t the foggiest idea of what to do with them?
Women love this area of their body being touched, since it is fairly sensitive, so it is important that 
you, as with any body part on a woman, move slowly and softly, caressing lightly with your palms and 
finger tips.  Be sure to also kiss her nipples and blow on them lightly to really get her going.  Go very 
lightly at first and gauge by her responses whether or not to segue into rabid grope mode.
And if you really want to go rough on her, be sure to ask first.
Her Pussy
Yeah, you’re thinking, “THANKS, Captain Obvious!” right now, correct?  Well fuck you.  Most guys 
never take the required time to tempt and tease this area of the body.  Too many guys treat this area 
of her body like a “break and enter” fucking crime scene.  Get in, grab the jewels and get out.
Take time to appropriately finger, tongue, or finger AND tongue her clit to really get her body

moving.  Kiss and suck gently on her crotch lips (aka the “labia”).  Play with her vagina by finger 
banging her.  This is also a good way to go on the hunt for her G-spot (it DOES exist!).  Hell, even if 
you don’t find it, both she and you will have had fun during the search.  Remember, not all women 
enjoy having a man go down on them.  There are many reasons for this.  Respect them all, no matter 
how Puritanically ridiculous they may seem.
Her Lips
These two lovely pieces of flesh are the gateway to your sexual happiness.  If the lips approve of you, 
the rest of her body tends to approve of you as well and she’ll let you in.
Whether it’s kissing, or perhaps sucking, or even biting and licking her lips, if done correctly you’ll 
definitely score.  Read the next segment VERY CAREFULLY if you want any chance of progressing past  
masturbating alone in the shower.
How To Lay Your Lips On Her
Ahh, kissing.  Kissing is the best prelude to sex of them all, so you better not suck at it.  Pardon the 
pun.
No matter how much time you have spent practicing in the mirror, no matter how much time you 
have spent trying to suck at and make out with your forearm, if you haven’t had some good quality 
kissing down time or ever been instructed by a woman on how to do it right, you probably AREN’T 
doing it right.
I think that it’s best that I start off with what guys tend to do wrong when kissing:
•	
Guys kiss too hard.
•	
Guys suck too hard.
•	
Guys do not practice good lip health (i.e. lip chapstick so that their lips are soft and 
supple).  Don’t go in for a kiss if your lips are dry; give ‘em a quick lick, at least.
•	
Guys do not shave well enough and scratch the girls’ face to shit when making brazen 
attempts to make out with her.
•	
Guys do not utilize their tongues appropriately.  Swishing that thing around in a girl’s 
mouth, or trying to reach her tonsils, does not make for a good smooch.
•	
Guys need to check their breath.  Bad breath will destroy your chances of getting laid, 
guaranteed (would you want some chick with onion breath panting in your face?  Not 
likely!)
We as men need to lay off the aggression when going in for the kiss.  Yeah, we may like it when a girl 
straddles our lap and presses every part of herself firmly against every part of US, but most women 
prefer a softer approach – that includes keeping your hands off her butt and breasts (at least initially).
Did you know that just putting some goddamn Vaseline on your lips once a day can go a LONG way 
in keeping them soft and kissable?  After you shave in the morning, just swipe some on.  It’ll take 
two seconds (and believe me, you’ll see results almost immediately with your woman if you have 
nice lips).  Oh, and yeah, DO remember to shave.  If you’re that guy who has a 5 o’clock shadow at 5 
o’clock, then take care to get out the razor and clean yourself up a bit.
As for breath, keep some mints or gum in the car, and a bottle of water.  Water can actually go a long 
way in whisking away that nasty bacteria that’s causing your dragon’s breath, plus you’ll be happy 
you’re hydrated if you get her in the sack later (being dehydrated will only cause your muscles to seize 
whilst in the throes of passion – which SUCKS!).
Oh yeah, and brush your teeth.  Floss too.  Admit it, you haven’t flossed in weeks; here’s your excuse

to get on to practicing good oral hygiene again.
Now that you know a bit about the hygiene DON’TS we can move on to the good shit.
How To Move In For The Kill
Kisses, especially the FIRST kiss, should not be some sort of sneak attack.  You need to have her 
acknowledge in some way (does not need to be verbal) that you are going to kiss her and have her 
consent to the kiss by leaning in to accept it.  Otherwise, she’ll slap you, push you away, or bitch at 
you for even trying. 
Fortunately, this isn’t the 1950s where all women seemed to be prudes.  These days, it’s pretty 
acceptable to kiss on the first date (though some girls will still give you a hard time over that shit).  A 
good time to kiss her is closer to the end of the night.  At this point, you should be in close proximity 
to her, so your reach should be good for kissing.  When you two share a story, an opinion, or just a 
moment together, you will lock each other’s gazes.  When this happens, soften your eyes slightly, 
soften your lips, and slowly lean in.  Don’t go in all of the way; watch her to be sure that she’s leaning 
in at least a little bit to accept it.
If she’s leaning back, STOP.
If she’s just staring back at you and not moving, STOP.
If she’s laughing at you or beginning to become uncomfortable, STOP.
But I’m telling you, more often than not, a girl will go in for the kiss just out of sheer curiosity.  And if 
you’re really uptight about making the move, you can always preface it with this question:
“Would you be upset if I kissed you right now?”
The first kiss shouldn’t be anywhere close to a French kiss.  Honestly, girls have complained about 
that to me enough for me to have to share that information with you.  Avoid ALL TONGUE CONTACT 
with that first kiss!  This should be lips to lips, and only that.  It should be soft and gentle, like a sigh 
has just been put into the form of a kiss.  Sometimes (yes, it happens), she will slip her tongue into 
your mouth first and kiss turns to bliss.
Moving Forward From The First Kiss
How you move forward after that first kiss is really up to the girl.  Read her reaction and follow 
her cues.  If she pulls away and does not lean back in, then pull away too.  She may be blushing or 
giggling, or most likely just smiling and (hopefully) looking pretty pleased.  This is where you can 
make up some bullshit excuse for kissing her, like:
YOU: Sorry, I just couldn’t help it any longer.
Yeah yeah, whatever.  She’ll say it’s okay that you did what you did and she may even comment on 
liking it.
If she looks happy and keeps talking to you after that first kiss, be sure to try to kiss her again right

fact, you should avoid all tongue contact 
with the first kiss!”

Chapter 13 - Get Your Sex On
before you two part ways at the end of the night.  Treat it like a first kiss again when you kiss her.  If 
she kisses you back this time, you can start using some more advanced techniques.  If she doesn’t 
kiss you back again, don’t push it; let her go with that lingering memory of you on her lips.
For the girls who keep right on kissing at any point, this is where shit gets fun.  You can try some 
different techniques on her to really drive her wild, kiss different areas, and you can really tease her.  
Here are some techniques you may be interested in trying:
Search High And Low
	
Start off by kissing her top lip, then kiss her bottom lip, then give her a delicious kiss on both lips at 
the same time.
Slick Lick
	
Before kissing her, run your tongue (GENTLY) over your partner’s lips for a truly tantalizing sensation.
Sensuous Secret
	
Before kissing your amour, draw yourself right beside her ear so that your lips are just brushing her 
ear.  Whisper to her how much you want to kiss her, draw away and lock eyes, and then go in for a 
firm passionate kiss.
Finger Fetish
	
Take your pointy finger (be sure that shit’s clean, dude) and gently run it over her lips, starting with 
the corner of her bottom lip, and then having it graze over her top lip.  Lean in and either deliver the 
kiss, or retract right when she was expecting some mouth sex and repeat the process; or try the next 
technique.
Everywhere But…
This is when you begin to kissing her forehead, her nose, and move to kissing her softly along her 
jaw line, to up her ears and then nibbling on her lobes.  You kiss her EVERYWHERE BUT her lips.  She 
may beg for it, but make her beg for a while until you decide to give in.
Whatever you do, do not start off with those cutesie kissing moves.  Don’t know 
what I’m talking about?  Think Eskimo kiss (rubbing your noses together).  Think 
Butterfly kisses (blinking rapidly while both of your eyelashes are touching).  She 
will probably think you’re pretty lame for doing these things.  Or, even worse, you 
are setting a precedent that you are into that lame shit.  If you are, okay – all 
power to you.  But if you aren’t, do NOT start with that crap.
 
More advanced kissing (at least, kisses on the lips) involves kissing with food in 
your mouth (no, I’m not talking about chewing up a nacho and spitting it in her 
mouth) like taking a strawberry and having her retrieve it from between your lips, 
or kissing while holding ice in your mouth.  Kissing her entire body while you have 
ice in your mouth is also a great way to turn her on.  This also involves using your 
tongue, such as in the rightfully famous French kissing.
Initial Foreplay
You have heard about the importance of foreplay, right?  Women don’t tend to go from 0 to 60 like 
a European sports car.  They’re more like a 1940’s Volkswagon; they take some time, gentle coaxing, 
caressing and some cuddling to get warmed up.  Especially when it’s the first time a woman’s met 
you.  You will need to invest some good time in the foreplay zone before you can move to the full-on 
PLAY zone.

Sex On The Brain
What the ominous “they” say is true: sex for women is in the brain.  The body is simply the vehicle 
to the pleasure.  If her head isn’t in the right place, you’ll have very little success.  No matter how 
delicious your physical skills are, if her brain is saying, “Meeehhh” then you’ll get NADA.
This is why sexualizing the conversation is so damn important.  I stress things for a reason!  Like I 
mentioned before, you want to put the idea of her having sex with you in her mind in subtle, gentle 
ways so you can advance to actually HAVING that sex with her.
As the night progresses, you should have been testing her limits with the sexualizations.  Continue 
to graduate to filthier analogies and ideas.  Don’t be overbearing.  Don’t sexualize constantly,  but 
bring it up often enough so that it does not go ignored.  And for Christ’s sake, keep it PLAYFUL or risk 
coming off like some love-sick horny Peacock duchebag.
Another way to get sexy with her head is to practice fantasy sharing and dirty talking.  This will 
probably happen at some point after she’s stepped into your apartment or the restaurant and made 
herself comfortable.  Having her share a fantasy is a great way to turn you both on.  If she blushes 
and says, ”I don’t know” then don’t push the subject.  Move on to something that isn’t sex related for 
a while.  Too many guys make the mistake of continuing to coax her:
HER: Oh, I just… fantasy? [giggle] Don’t have one… not really
YOU: Aw, come on.  EVERYONE has a fantasy.  Like, my fantasy is – 
STOP RIGHT THERE!  Do not share your fantasy.  Nope.  Don’t do it.  Do not share your fantasy 
ESPECIALLY if she isn’t sharing hers.  You have to hear her fantasy first to gauge how freaky and 
adventurous she is, and then tweak yours to suit her level of comfort.
To get the idea of touching and sex into the girls’ head, I’ll ask her how she likes to relax.  She 
may say she likes to read, to enjoy a glass of wine, run, watch TV, whatever.  When she throws the 
question back at me, I’ll throw in a couple of those typical answers – but I’ll also include some physical 
and more sexually suggestive ways I like to relax too:
ME: I really enjoy reading while taking a hot bath too!  Ha ha.  But a good, deep 
massage of my shoulders…wow, nothing can compare to that.  I can feel my muscles 
being squeezed and then releasing completely – I can feel the tension just leaking out 
of them.  
If you want to get sex on her brain and you don’t feel like palm reading or dancing, suggest making 
a dessert at home together (be sure you have the ingredients, or go shopping quickly together for 
some stuff).  This is also a creative and playful way to get her back to your place.  Grocery shopping 
and cooking together will bring about those domestic settling down feelings, which will make her feel 
less guilty later on for sleeping with you.  She will also feel more comfortable with you, which in turn 
makes her less resistant to your advances.  Dessert is also a pleasurable and tantalizing dish, even if 
it’s just Jell-O.  Again, you’re putting her head in that pleasurable mindset. 
If you really are going to watch a movie with her (YAWN!) at least choose a movie together that has 
a lot of sexual innuendos, somewhat graphic sex scenes (make sure they aren’t too graphic, otherwise 
she’ll feel embarrassed and uncomfortable) and has attractive people in it.  Now is not the time to 
throw on The Color Purple or any other thoughtful films.  I hate to say it, but put on something stupid 
and that doesn’t provoke a lot of thought.  Later on, by all means move on to movies that are WORTH 
YOUR TIME.
Now I think we have to go over what will NOT work to turn her brain on:

How To Cock Block Yourself
Obviously taking her to see a French flick will definitely cock-block anything you plan on for the 
evening.  What the fuck is with the French?  Geezus!
•	
Any mention of past lovers and girlfriends.  Do NOT talk about this shit, not now, not 
EVER.
•	
How many sexual partners you or she has been with.  No matter what the number, the 
end result is the same: BAD  
•	
Mentioning that one time you caught an STD in Thailand…
•	
Watching anything on television.  BORING!
•	
Watching overly sexed-up scenes on television – again, it will make her uncomfortable 
and antsy to get the hell out of there.  Cartoons and infomercials are just as bad
•	
Discussing any serious issues regarding you (health, work, school) or the world (wars, 
poverty, starvation, swine flu)
•	
Burping and farting in her company
•	
Changing into sweat pants when you get home.  Ugh…
•	
Being overly forceful with any topic of conversation or any opinions.  If she says something 
you don’t agree with, nod and say, “Hmm… well I’ve never looked at it like that before”.  
See, even if you don’t agree, you aren’t saying that you DO agree.  She won’t bother to 
ask you to clarify on that either
•	
Interrupting her.  Girls hate this.  Guys hate this.  Though she may be interrupting you, 
this doesn’t mean that you should return the favor.  Just move her into the not girlfriend 
material pile.

Horrible Anecdote:
So back in my college days there was this Asian girl.  Fucking hot beyond belief and I wanted to tap her ass so 
bad!  Being younger and much dumber (reads: less experienced), I thought taking her to a movie would be the 
cat’s meow.  Big mistake.  Being one of those artsy types, she picks “Monsieur Hire” - a French flick.  Fuck...
should have known better.  
You can Google this piece of shit later, but here’s the basic plot:
Mr. Hire is an aging, balding old fuck that has the hots for a twenty something young thing 
that moves in next door.  Her boyfriend is a miserable prick that murders an old woman - 
witnessed, of course, by Mr. Hire.  Mr. Hire hides away the one piece of evidence that would 
land the bastard in prison and blackmails the hottie chick into moving to Switzerland with him 
and live the remainder of their lives in a beautiful condo he’s bought for her.  She turns the 
tables on him, frames him for the murder.  His love is so true for her that he leaps from the 
top of his apartment building to his death, taking the horrible secret with him, so that she 
may live with her one true love.
Now that’s fucked up shit!  And it’s the worst fucking movie you could ever take a first date to.  Holy shit.  I 
never heard back from the girl again.  So much for tapping that ass!  But I am a better man for it, and now so 
are you.

Chapter 13 - Get Your Sex On
It’s because men lack patience.  Men lack the UNDERSTANDING of patience.  We also tend to lack 
skill, but this book will teach you all about that.
Keep in mind that your date with the girl is not some race to see how quickly you can get her into 
your bed.  If you’re meant to get laid, you shall be.  Nothing will destroy the magic for her like feeling 
pushed into sex.
It’s important to understand that sexing her body comes after sexing her mind.  Once she either 
consciously or subconsciously understands your desires with sexualizing the conversation, she will 
either permit you to touch her slightly (elbow guiding, hand touching) or she’ll retract and probably 
won’t come out of her shell for the entire date (I say basically throw in the towel at that point).  If she 
has allowed you to move on to gentle touches, then you have to come up with creative ways to touch 
her MORE, though still avoiding what my parents called the bathing suit area and they weren’t talking 
about the pool.
If you have actually been reading this book sober, you will recall I mentioned palm reading and 
dancing as sexing up the mind.  Of course, this requires touching her body, so it also works at sexing 
up her body as well.
Some other ways to touch her without being completely obvious are showing her yoga or work out 
positions and then helping her into those positions; showing her how to perfect her form when playing 
ANY sport by standing behind her and guiding her hands; guiding her when trying to teach her to play 
a musical instrument you know how to play; and so on.  Look at your skills: what are you good at?  
Share them with her!  Then SHOW them to her.  If the girl’s interested in you, she’ll make a shitty 
attempt at doing what you enjoy doing.
If that doesn’t work, find out what skills SHE has and ask her to show you.  Saddle up nice and close 
and friendly like with her while she’s showing you.  Don’t believe this will work?  Think again!  I had a 
smokin’ hot fitness trainer helping me shed a few pounds.  While I never did land her in the sack, we 
had some really great and close times with each other.
Some foreplay touching actions that I’ve never understood are thumb wars and arm wrestling.  
Excuse me?  When does any woman give a fuck about arm wrestling?  And you better pray to GOD 
that you are stronger than her and will win the arm wrestling.  If you don’t beat her at that, seriously 
– go hit the gym.  This book cannot help you until you build up a little somethin’-somethin’.
Even if no event crops up that allows you to take advantage of initial touching foreplay, that’s alright.  
Continue to touch her ever so often, softy and appropriately, and continue to sexualize so she’s 
getting your signal loud and clear.  If you are somewhere that requires you two moving around, such 
as a club or even the mall, practice gently guiding her along with you by the elbow or by applying light 
pressure to the small of her back.  Remember, you’re not steering her as much as you are applying 
gentle affectionate, respectful contact.  She will appreciate the mild control you’re exerting.  Or if she 
doesn’t, she will certainly let you know.
Advanced Foreplay
Sex On The Brain
Do you remember what I told you before, big guy?  As I have been tellin you, a woman’s G-spot is 
actually in her brain.  So before you can advance on to better, more fun activities, you have to get 
HER head in the game.  If her head’s in the game, you’re in the game.
Assuming sexual activity is underway in your relationship (meaning that you’re regularly tapping 
her), you can step your game up.  This can be achieved by becoming more lewd (“I want to stick my 
hot, throbbing cock into your tight pussy”) or you can play games to add a bit of spice to things.

Chapter 13 - Get Your Sex On
Before you freak out and whine about not being able to come up with any fun games, fear not: I 
have the answers you seek  - well, some of them, at least.
Tantalizing Truth or Dare:  This game is based on that wonderful classic, with a sexy and horny 
twist.  I’m not going to lay out MY entire game to you, but will rather point out that you must have a 
set of pre-thought out questions for truths and dares.  Here are some examples of truths:
•	
Tell me the most forbidden place you have ever wanted to make love
•	
If you could dress me to be the sexist, most fuckable piece of meat on the earth, 
what would I be wearing?
•	
What is the hottest technique you have had used on you or wanted to be used 
on you?
•	
What is the most dirty, naughty dream you have had?
•	
What’s a dirty secret about you that you have never told anyone?
And now, for the dare portion of this section:
•	
You’re my sex slave for the next 10 minutes and you must fulfill my every whim 
and desire.
•	
I’m a XXX photographer.  Give me 5 poses for your hot photo shoot
•	
You have two minutes to make me blush with your filthiest dirty talk.
•	
Remove any piece of my clothing – but you can only use your teeth
•	
I’m a hot stranger at the club.  Give me your best moves and convince me to go 
home with you.
Get it?  Good.  And if you’re thinking what I think you’re are, you’re right.  If you’ve got a good vibe 
going with your girl on your first date, these are fucking AWESOME conversation starters!
Dicey Dice:  All you probably need is one die for this, though if you’re adventurous, throw in two 
dice.  This is all about the number on the dice correlating with a predetermined action.  If you still 
don’t get it, then consider this as:
2 = Lips
3 = Between the breasts
4 = Nipples
5 = Neck
6 = Inner thighs
You can also throw in outer thighs, that area between the thigh and groin, toes, spine…you get the 
picture.  And just to be clear, if you try this game as an opener on your first date, you’re fucked - and 
not in the good way.
There are some games that are pre-made in stores, but…do you see what I just did?  You can either 
pay $40 for some game that may make you look like a bit of a perv, or you can come up with it on 
your own and look spontaneous AND creative.
Go the cheap route this time, dude.  Make that shit up on your own.
Role Playing:  I think that this is fairly obvious, yes?  I think that this game may be perhaps the 
most favored amongst women, since they are then able to behave in such a manner that they, 
themselves, would not act.
For some reason, setting up some situation and throwing a costume at them really gets them going.  
Whatever reason that IS, I like it.
Be sure that you have props that are also appropriate for the situation.  You know, whipped

Chapter 13 - Get Your Sex On
cream, cucumbers and chocolate sauce are not always the best choices for making a situation sexy.  
Experiment with ice, tea, chairs, chocolate liqueurs, and candles.  Ask her what she would like to use, 
and what sexy situation she would like to act out.  I bet she has a sexy corset or bra and panty set 
that will make you cream your undies and a hot new idea that you may have never thought of.
Props
On the mention of props, here are some rather unlikely ones that you can still use to maximize your 
play time:
Oven Mitt
Use as a cushion under her ass while you’re getting it on (if you’re on the kitchen counter); can hold 
ice cubes for longer periods (use the cubes to trace around her nipples and where ever else you two 
enjoy).
Bed Sheet
Use to tie her or yourself up with; fool around with the sheet between you two; use it as a sex picnic 
blanket in the backyard or, dare I say, in a public park.
SOFT Paintbrush (none of that hard, used paintbrush shit.  Yikes)
Great for stroking your partners’ no-no bits; can use it to paint dirty words on your lover’s back, and 
then have them guess what you’re writing (I’m not endorsing this game; never worked well for me, 
but did for a friend of mine, so I’ll add it); dipping the brush in chilled water and letting the water drip 
between their breasts, down their belly, and between their legs.
Popsicle
Offer it to her and watch her suck at it in a sexy way (and trust me, she’ll do it); Make a path along 
your woman’s body, and then follow the trail with kisses and licks; suck on the popsicle yourself, then 
go in for a chilled kiss (this can be lips, thigh, clit, whatever gets her goin’).  If she’s feeling really 
playful, use it to penetrate her and be sure to lick and suck it every chance you get (word of caution: 
you don’t want to give her an infection though!).
Mirror
Uhh, do I even have to tell you?  Christ…
Pillow
For propping her ass up during sex if you plan on doing the missionary later; have her hold a pillow 
above her head and KEEP it there while you pleasure her; great for doggy style later on, too.
Before I end this little segment here, I must remind you to always, ALWAYS ask her what she likes.  
Memorize it, and practice it.  Even if you suck at first, she’ll have incredible patience and be impressed 
that you’re even trying.  Hell, she’ll probably be impressed that you even asked.  You would be 
surprised how many men just pound away at the pussy and don’t ask shit about HER experience.
Games To Play:
These are not so much games as they are techniques.  I guarantee you, your girl will love them so 
much that you will definitely enjoy having hot, hot sex if you can lay down and master some mad 
skills in this department.  Trust me.  If you give these a try, she’ll repay you by giving you a try later 
tonight.

Chapter 13 - Get Your Sex On
Method #1: The Art of Undressing
This is all about you stripping your girl down to nothing.  What you want to do is stand right in front 
of your woman and be sure to undress her SLOWLY, being sure to kiss each and every part of her that 
comes into view.  When she is completely naked, grab a bottle of her favorite lotion and pay some 
much needed attention to her otherwise neglected areas (like her inner, upper arms and behind her 
knees).
Method #2:  Create your Own Treasure Trail
Once she’s naked, it’s time to make full use of your lips and fingers.  Use these fingers to trace a 
trail along the entirety of her body, starting at her toes and stopping at each and every one of her 
erogenous zones to pay some extra, much needed attention.  I suggest changing up the pressure 
that you’re applying, but be sure to never press TOO hard; that’ll just make her uncomfortable or 
experience unspeakable pain (shame on you).  If you do the pressure thing right, she’ll be so aroused 
by the time you get to her crotch that she’ll pretty much cry out when you don’t touch her clit.  Don’t 
listen to her; retrace your way up her body, except rather than using your fingers, use your tongue.
Method #3: Put her to Work
That’s right, you’ll be putting HER to work – so be sure your girl is receptive to this before attempting 
(some women really do expect you to do all the work all of the time).  Lie on your back, and coax 
your girl to straddle you.  Aim to have your cock under her, but not inside of her (remember, this is 
foreplay; not fucking).  Apply some lube to your groin area, and or hers if necessary, and encourage 
her to grind against your pelvic bone.  As she does so, be sure to caress her thighs and ass.  If 
you want to increase the pleasure, lift your hips and move in a direction that pleasures both of you 
(though primarily her).  This may be back and forth, or circles, or even up and down.  
Hell, give all three a shot.  They’ll all feel good – I guarantee it.
Another way to put her to work is this:  Have her lie down (naked, of course) and be sure that you 
are able to still see her.  Once she does this, request that she touch one of her body parts.  
Here’s where you go to work.  You then tell her how you would pleasure that particular area.  Be sure 
to use as much detail as possible.  Though in real life you may feel ridiculous describing the amount of 
pressure you would be applying to a woman’s clitoris, in the bedroom it is perfectly acceptable.
Shed the decency and revert to pervert.  That’s right, I said REVERT.  You know we guys all are, deep 
down.  Take pleasure in her pleasure and have fun with it!  Almost all women really want to let loose.  
Help her in this great task.
Oral Sex
Some people claim that this is actual sex, while others take the Bill Clinton approach and claim it as a 
NON-sex.  I like to think of oral sex best utilized as a form of foreplay, though if you or she gets to the 
point of climax with it, high fives for both of you!
Some Science For You
I’m throwing this in here, because I think it’s important for you to understand just what you’re 
dealing with here: i.e, a part of the body that has more nerve endings than any other area of the 
human body – approximately 8 000 nerve endings, to be exact.  So don’t be fooled by its rather small 
and innocent appearance.  The clitoris will either make or break your game skills.
A woman’s entire pelvic region is also very sensitive, especially when it is aroused.  Be sure to also 
give the undersides of her butt some caresses, kiss and lick her inner thighs, and pay attention to her

Chapter 13 - Get Your Sex On
other set of lips, the ever so delicious labia. 
Be Well Groomed
I’m hoping that she is at least, well, quite well groomed down there in a fashion that you can 
appreciate (hardwood floors, landing strip, or hey, if you’re into full on bush then enjoy that Garden of 
Eatin).  You want to make sure that YOU are well groomed, though, and I don’t just mean trimming 
your pubes or shaving your nut sack.
If you have facial hair, be sure that it’s well trimmed and as soft as possible.  If you have stubble, 
shave it off.  Women are extremely sensitive down there so any rough surfaces, such as your 
goddamn 80 grade sandpaper face can ruin the whole experience.
You will be touching her with your fingers, so make sure those nails are clean, trimmed and don’t 
have any ragged or sharp edges.  You don’t want to be nicking her with your 
fingers.  If you have calluses on your hand, try to use the softest parts of your 
hands to touch her with, if possible.
Ask For Guidance
Women do NOT mind giving you guidance, fellas.  A lot of guys wanna jump in 
there, acting as if they’ve given oral a million times and they KNOW how to turn a 
woman on.
Take your macho act and shove it, dude.  Even if you have given oral a million 
times, every woman is different and likes different things.  Yes, guys all like to get 
sucked almost the same way; which is to say, anyway at all, but women are quite 
a bit different and have their own set of preferences that come with the Promised 
Gland zone you’re in.
Even if a girl starts off with the giggles and the “I don’t know” responses, keep trying different things 
and ask her if she likes it.  She’ll let you know, usually by starting to moan and gasp incoherently
Use Your Hands!
Hands are great for more than just changing tires, they’re also great for changing things up and, 
let’s be real here…your tongue will probably get tired after even a few minutes of lapping at her.  She 
will not mind if you decide to use your fingers to stimulate and rub her clit, her butt, or your thumbs 
to massage the insides of her thighs.  Hands can also explore many other parts of her, including the 
inside of her (I’m not suggesting fisting unless she’s into that kind of thing).
Common Errors Guys Make
We usually find ourselves in an uncomfortable position.  If you have to move yourself, or even her, 
around to make giving oral an experience that isn’t going to result in needing chiropractic help, then 
do it.  You think she cares?  No.  Anyway, by doing this, you’re ensuring that she’s comfortable too 
(girls often don’t speak up if they are uncomfortable, especially the younger ones).
We are too rough.  This isn’t to say that a bit later on  she may want your tongue to press a lot 
harder than initially, but a lot of guys start off with just slabbing their tongue on her pussy and 
begin lapping at it like a chow starved Rottweiler.  This is not TANTALIZING or EXCITING for her; it’s 
bothersome.  Don’t be too rough or maniacally persistent as she may be too sensitive to climax at the 
time and you just need to back the hell off.
Try using the tip of your tongue rather than laying your tongue FLAT on her.  The tip offers the ever 
so delicate balance of pressure and softness that a woman’s clit craves.  Only if she insists on you 
going harder should you ever consider using the flat of your tongue.

Chapter 13 - Get Your Sex On
We move too fast.  Remember that whole bit up there about foreplay?  I put that at the BEGINNING 
of the chapter for a goddamn REASON.  Don’t dive into her pants and go at it immediately.  You gotta 
warm her up.  This includes altering the pressure you are putting on her upper inner thighs, the thigh 
or groin connection spot, her labia and her clitoris.  Start off slowly and softly.  Gradually work your 
way up to fast and firm, but when you start to increase the pressure or speed, turn it down a notch to 
make her really want  you to resume the quicker tempo.
We suck too much.  One main complaint that I get from women is that we SUCK at them too much 
and too hard.  Yeah, I know, WE like getting sucked, right?  Sucking on the clitoris too vigorously or 
for too long just makes it too sensitive, so it just destroys her chance to climax.
We drool too much.  Do not – I repeat – do NOT slobber all over your girl’s pussy.  And please, for 
the love of GOD do NOT spit on it!  Yes, believe it or not, guys have DONE THIS! They see it in a porn 
film and think that’s how it’s done.  NOT.   You’re using your mouth already, you jackass!  Unless 
you’re suffering from dry mouth, the saliva that is applied by your lips and tongue is MORE than 
enough to provide that sexy glide.
We bite – sometimes.  Okay, if you’re a biter, go and get yourself a chew toy.  A woman’s vagina 
is not to be gnawed on.  Hell, nibbling on her labia or clit is completely unacceptable unless she 
REQUESTS it (bet you $100 she won’t).  You can ever so gently nibble her inner thighs, right up to 
where it joins her pelvis, but stop there.  And please – no biting.  
And this is for the mentally retarded:  do not VOMIT, do not FART, do not take a phone call and do not 
EAT during oral sex – unless it’s some sort of food that you’ve put on each other.  If you’re too sick, 
too gassy, or too hungry to go without doing one of those things, just save the oral for later.
Getting It Right
There is no precise science on how to give good oral sex, but there is common 
sense.  
With your tongue, be sure to vary the speeds and the motions.  Change to 
clockwise, counter clockwise, and up and down.  Some women even like it if you 
make a sort of “X” marks the spot motion with your tongue over her clit.  Changing 
tongue motion and speed also changes the pressure being applied to different 
areas of her body.  Variety is the spice of lips.
As a general rule, start off as gently as possible.  The closer you get to the clit, 
the gentler you have to be.  Again, remember:  8,000 nerve endings.  Yikes.  Ask 
her before going harder, and keep checking in with her, no matter what you’re 
doing, to see if she’s still enjoying it.
Be sure to use your hands for more than just holding yourself up (if you ARE having to hold yourself 
up, be sure to change positions or else your shoulders WILL seize up on you).  One great move is to 
use your thumbs to slightly lift the skin at the top of her pubic bone to expose more of her clit.  This 
will help you reach all the spots you need, plus you’re touching her pelvis, which is also incredibly 
arousing.
You can also use your forefinger or even middle finger to tease the entryway of her vagina.  Just 
when she’s moaning and wriggling a bit, slip your finger inside of her slowly and continue to stimulate 
her clit gently.  If you’re lucky, you’ll feel her squeezing you as she’s about to climax (total turn on!).  
Try sliding another finger in there too after a few minutes; she’ll appreciate it.  The hotter she gets, 
the more she wants. Imagine that!

of life.  Change up 
your patterns and 
motions frequently

to really bring her

Marital Aids (aka Sex Toys)
Toys can be a touchy subject for some women.  Most are thrilled and excited to try them out 
(especially if it has a vibrating function of ANY kind).  Some women, however,  will be  downright 
offended that you even would make the suggestion and are instantly turned off.  They seem to think 
that you are suggesting that she and her sex are boring if you need toys.
It will take a bit to convince her otherwise, so just try to go for a basic vibrating boy to introduce her 
to how fantastic these toys can be, and how they truly are there to enhance your mutual pleasure.
I gotta say this first, though, before we go any further:  Do not – I repeat, do NOT – reuse any past 
toys that you may have bought with your ex girlfriend.  Even if you bleached them to shit, not only 
is it still disgusting, but it’s also a bad reminder for the girl of your previous sexy times with another 
woman.  She’ll shoot you down faster than a turkey on Thanksgiving if you pull that shit and she finds 
out.  And how will she find out?  Fuck, they always seem to somehow.
I know toys are expensive, but it’s worth going to Ye Olde Adult Shoppe and choosing a toy together 
and buying it NEW.  Failing that, buy one online together.  You won’t be able to fuck around with it 
that night, but the anticipation of getting it in the mail can be pretty damn exciting.
Vaginal Toys
This almost always involves some sort of clit stimulator (smart move, sex toy industry) and often 
involves some sort of fucking instrument, most commonly the dildo or rubber penis.  Sometimes those 
plastic neon penises even have smiley faces on them (not quite sure WHY, but I guess it’s cute…?).
You can find clit stimulators, or more commonly referred to as vibrators in the shape of bunny ears, 
humming birds, butterflies, dolphins, flowers…the list goes on and on.  I personally recommend the 
bunny ears.  I have not had one girl complain about that shit.  Also, test drive a sample vibrator 
before you make your purchase choice.  Sex shops are very cool and straight forward about this.  Just 
test it in the palm of your hand or along your finger tips.  You don’t want some weak little unit that 
doesn’t even vibrate as much as your cheap electric razor.
Be sure to ask your girl what she’s interested in when you’re checking this shit out.  As you probably 
have noticed, there’s a ton of different sized cocks in there.  Hell, you can even stick some of those 
suckers to a wall in case she becomes aroused by the apartment itself.  Don’t encourage her to get 
a larger cock size than she’d like either; let her choose.  She knows what she can handle.  If she 
chooses a dildo that that’s three times the size of your wazoo, you’re in trouble, dude!
Oh yeah, and uhh, maybe stay away from the rubber fists until later.
Anal Toys
A lot of girls, whether they are aware of it or not, really like having something up their ass!  I was 
a bit shocked when I first discovered this, and lots of women are still incredibly embarrassed or 
disgusted by the thought of something being shoved where the sun don’t shine (including YOU) so 
introduce this idea after discussing what she does and does not like, and what she will consider doing 
and what she absolutely will never do.
Some anal toys out there are butt plugs and beads.  FYI: the beads tend to stay in better during sex, 
but no matter what you put in there, it’ll probably come out by the time she orgasms.  When she’s 
experiencing an orgasm, her anus and vagina are contracting like crazy, so she will often dislodge 
whatever you put in there due to that alone.
It’s also a good idea to try using a well lubed finger and insert it in her anus before spending $30 on 
a piece of rubber.  Some chicks learn to love it, others just never will.  Accept whatever she likes.

Male Toys
Men can enjoy the anal toys mentioned above as well, though we have our own sort of toys too.  
Most are made to help us sustain ourselves during intercourse, like the cock ring.  These often come 
with (can you guess?) a vibrator, so when you’re slamming your woman she’s getting that additional 
sensation.  Be sure you get an appropriate size, though; you don’t want your cock getting choked 
out, or having the damn thing continually slip off.  Signs that it’s too tight include the obvious ones:  
discomfort, purple head, veins bulging, passing out.  Be sensible.
You can also consider getting a penis extension or sleeve to help you keep going during sex.
While you’re shopping with her, avoid penis pumps (lame), pocket vaginas (lame!) pocket anuses 
(also lame!) or blow up dolls.  Unless she suggests it.  Otherwise, come back on your own later.
I’m not going to list all the sex toys here, since that’s goddamn impossible.  But be on the look out 
for shit you have at home that can be used as a sex toy.  For instance, a belt, especially a wider 
one, is awesome.  Not only is it a great spanking device, but you can also hold it up across your hips 
and use it during doggy style sex to draw yourself into her.  It’s like having your own personal set of 
portable handles!
Basic Sex Positions (& How Women Rank Them)
While it may be true that every woman has her own personal preference, for the rookie who has yet 
to really get his sex on, you may need a bit of help deciding which positions are worthwhile to try.  
Below I’ve taken the time to interview and chart out womens’ general opinions on some of the more 
standard sex positions.  Just bear in mind, though, that each woman has her own certain freaky ways, 
so where one lady may prefer the classic missionary, the next may want a fist up her ass.

Experimenting
Oh yeah, every guy out there is totally down with SOME sort of experimenting.  So you may not want 
your balls stomped and have a girl slap you silly while you’re getting it on; that’s fine.  I’m not into 
that either.  But there are some things that can or are considered to be experimental, especially for 
women, so we’ll cover these in this section.
NOTE:  Experimenting is NOT for the first date.  Go with the boring ol’ missionary and keep it on 
the romantic side if you want a chance of seeing her again.  Wait until at LEAST until the third date 
(especially if she seems like the freaky type) to introduce any experimenting.
Toys
We’ve pretty much covered this, but I want to remind you again – this is experimenting.  Not every 
girl is into toys, and I know a lot of guys who aren’t into toys either.  Some men and women associate 
them with being sexually deficient.  They may even construe the use of toys as somehow to be 
cheating on each other.
If you are thinking of experimenting with toys, start with the ready to hand household items 
mentioned above:  Belts, removable showerheads, ice, vegetables (yes, I’m talking to YOU, 
cucumber!).  If she shows interest in using these sorts of things, then step it up a notch by suggesting 
you both check out some shit online when you’re in the mood.
Porn
Believe it or not, but a lot of women find porn completely and utterly disgusting.  I know!  I’m 
shocked too!  I haven’t been so shocked since I discovered that the sexual harassment training at 
work was actually anti-harassment!  Some have a real hang up with it and will outright REFUSE to 
watch it, because it is all about demoralizing an innocent woman or it’s painting sex to be some crazy 
animalistic act rather than a romantic thing.  Other girls I know get off on the shit and will watch it on 
their own.
If you think your girl MIGHT be down with porn, try using soft core shit first.  Hell, try starting her 
off with a steamy scene in an average movie, like some James Bond flick.  Gauge her reaction:  Is she 
blushing and looking away?  Or is she smiling?  Or is she starting to shift around while still watching 
the screen intently?  I had a girlfriend once insist that I fast forward through these scenes (she didn’t 
last too long) and I also had another one who wanted to just watch these parts of the movie over and

over again.  If she’s not showing signs of complete disgust, try finding a porno that has a romance-
based storyline, or a storyline where the woman is more in control than the man.  Chicks seem to 
dig this shit more than the stuff we guys like to watch.  They particularly like scenes when the man is 
pleasuring the woman.
Keep an eye out for porno with storylines, powerful female roles, and romance.  Nina Hartley flicks 
are a good place to start, as are those Playgirl videos that you can often find for rent.  What may 
seem cheesy and needless to you (a storyline to get to the sex?  SO unnecessary) is needed for her.  
Suck it up and enjoy the titty action.
Anal Sex
We all want it, but many women don’t want to give it.  Yeah, those girls in the porn videos really 
seem to love it, right?  Well, real life women have a different take on it.  Many women find anal sex 
downright painful, and there’s a good reason for that: you’re forcing open an extremely strong muscle 
that is also covered with very delicate skin that is prone to tearing and ripping.  So don’t cite that 
bullshit I hear from guys about girls disliking anal, like she’s lying or just being a tease.
Anal sex really is a very delicate thing.  It takes a lot of patience, understanding, and trust.  This is 
why you hopefully aren’t trying to bang the girl in the ass on date #1 (unless she indicates that she 
wants it like that – then, by all means have fun!).
So when can you actually introduce the idea of anal sex?  After at least 2 nights of REGULAR SEX, 
you can either:
1)	 express interest immediately before starting any vaginal intercourse; or
2)	 if you are able to go more than once in a short period of time, introduce the idea during 
round 2.  She will likely be tired half way through round 2, where this technique can work 
particularly well:
Ask the girl to lay on her tummy (naked, of course) and then straddle her from behind.  Ideally, you’ll 
want your cock reaching the base of her ass cheeks and touching just a bit between her thighs.  Start 
by massaging her thighs, her butt, and her shoulders to really get her going.  She’ll find both your 
position and the massaging extremely erotic and will become incredibly aroused (this is where putting  
sex toys to work pays off).  You will probably even have her wiggling and wriggling, and clenching her 
butt cheeks (this will probably result in her squeezing your penis between her cheeks too, which is a 
major turn on).
Right at the point where you’re both extremely excited, gently press the tip of your cock into her 
anus – and I do mean GENTLY.  Remember what I said about women finding anal sex painful?  This is 
why you have GOT to TAKE IT SLOW.
If she asks you to stop, STOP.
If she guides you away (probably back to her pussy) then STOP TRYING FOR ANAL SEX.  This is just 
another sign she’s giving you, letting you know that she is NOT into the idea.  Accept it and try again 
another day (you should be happy that she’s willing to even let your cock any where NEAR her naked 
body).
If she doesn’t reject you, SCORE!  Just remember: take it SLOW.
Anal Tips
•	
To successfully penetrate a woman’s anus, you may need to make up to 10 attempts to 
enter before you are actually able to do so.  Take your time, and try not to put a lot of 
pressure on her to have the first attempt be a success
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online

Chapter 13 - Get Your Sex On
•	
USE LUBRICATION.  You’ve probably been pre-cumming like crazy, and she probably 
has some lube going on too, but invest in a good quality lubricant if you are thinking of 
trying anal sex (many drug store brands won’t cut it, so try visiting some adult-oriented 
stores for better options).  There are even some numbing lubricants on the market in 
case she does find anal sex painful, but these can sometimes be completely useless and 
may adversely affect your penile enjoyment.
•	
Never ever go from ass to pussy without thoroughly cleansing your dick.  If you practice 
such nasty behavior, your girl is going to get one hell of an infection.
How To Go Again…And Again…
This saddens me, but it’s a goddamn truth: the average time it takes for a man to ejaculate once 
he penetrates a woman is anywhere between 6 and 8 minutes.  THAT’S IT.  Wham, bam, thank you 
ma’am indeed!
If you find yourself in a position where you have blown your load and your lover is still writhing in 
bed, waiting to be pleased, and you basically shrug and tell her, “That’s all, folks!” and then rush off 
to get a glass of water.  Within 2 minutes, she’ll turn into a monster bitch (understandable) and storm 
out.  Within 5 minutes, each of her friends will know that you’re a shitty lay and a one minute man 
piece of shit.
Let me tell you, if you’ve never been in that position, it’s not fun.  But if you have been, which most 
dudes have, it really sucks.  So what can you do to help improve that stamina of yours?
Fitness
It’s true, the better physical shape you are in, the more stamina you will have.  I mean, think about 
it: sex involves a lot of arm work, shoulder work, abdominal work AND leg work.  So it’s not all about 
a lot of dick work; all of the muscles of the body, when fine tuned, will be optimal in the bedroom.
Unfortunately, too many of us associate a six pack with a goddamn pack of beer rather than our own  
fat layered abs.
It may seem unfair, fellas, that women can basically lay back and just take what they have coming to 
them from us, but that’s just how it is.  Even though a woman’s fitness may suck and she insists on 
laying back in missionary mode due to being tired after 2 minutes of bouncin’, you cannot pull off the 
same shit.  
Go for a run.  Stop smoking, and drink more water than beer.  Oh, and maybe do a few push ups in 
the morning.  It’ll greatly improve your longevity underneath the covers.  And give up the coffee.  It 
negatively affects the size of your load and your ability to ejaculate.
Masturbation
This is one of those age old tricks that most guys swear by.  This involves a guy wanking off any 
where from 30 minutes to 2 hours before his date, or anticipated fucky fucky times with his woman, 
so he won’t blow his load too soon.
Now, I think that this logically works best for younger guys.  They recharge faster (generally) so they 
will be ready to go again before an older guy will be.  I suggest that you test this theory a couple of 
times before you put it to real practice, just to be sure that you have the timing for your body down 
right.
Desensitizing Ointments And Creams
Remember in the anal sex section when I mentioned numbing lubricant?  That is a desensitizing 
The Dating Commando

191
Chapter 13 - Get Your Sex On
ointment of sorts.  There are a lot on the market that are basically made for those guys who suffer 
from PE, otherwise known as premature ejaculation.  These pretty much numb your whole dick so you 
can go longer without cumming because, well, you can’t feel shit all.
This can be affective, but there are a few things you have to consider before you jump all over this 
crap.  One thing to think about is how much to apply.  Guys often just lather that shit right on their 
cocks and then sadly discover that they can’t feel anything for HOURS.  Most girls – and guys – don’t 
have hours upon hours for sex without reaching climax, so chances are you’ll give up before you get to 
cum.  Second, often this kind of shit is transferred to your partner.  So if you put this stuff on yourself, 
it will probably get on her vagina and other sensitive areas, like her pelvis and clit.  So if she’s 
numbed, she isn’t enjoying the experience.
ALTERNATIVE PRACTICE:  Layering Condoms.  This can work, but again be sure that the fuckin’ 
things stay ON you.  You don’t want to be fishing around in your lover’s snatch for your stray condom 
or, even worse, taking her to the emergency room so that they can remove it (unfortunately, you 
really can’t leave those things up there).
Exercises
You’ve heard of kegels, right?  It’s usually associated with women who have a loose pussy and who 
want to tighten it up naturally through exercise.  Well guys can do kegels too.  This exercise involves 
tightening the muscles from your anus to your urethra.
Next time you’re taking a piss, cut off your stream.  Feel that?  THAT is a kegel.  If you’re just sitting 
around at home watching TV, why not try to do some reps of 5 or 10?  You’ll be glad you did them 
later in life, too, when you don’t have to be strapping on diapers like the rest of them.
Medication
Medication is really a last resort, unless you seriously do have a premature ejaculation problem that’s 
causing major issues for you and or your lover.
If you think that you do have a premature ejaculation problem, your doctor will probably prescribe 
you some sort of antidepressant medication, or an SSRI.  Though these of course are not made for 
this exact purpose, the side effect is the delay of sexual response, so you should be able to last longer.
DO discuss the possible side effects of these medications with your doctor.  Don’t get hit with any 
nasty medication surprises.
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online
Chapter Conclusion
A woman must be warmed up like your car must be in the dead of winter (unless you live in 
California or Florida).  Foreplay, foreplay, and more foreplay.  Remember: this isn’t a race.
Don’t be too afraid to test drive some different positions, toys, and techniques with her.  Just 
keep asking how she’s doing and whether or not she’s enjoying what you’re doing. 
Sex on a first date with a woman you want to continue to see may not be the best of ideas.  
You both may get the wrong impression of one another, which will sabotage any “future 
potential”.

Chapter 14 - Kicking Her Outta The Sack
D
id the last chapter get you laid?  It did?  I fuckin’ told ya so.  Believe me when I say you 
should listen to me now?  
Here’s a rather difficult part to talk about: kicking her out of your bed.  Also known as the fuck ‘n 
chuck.  And before you rag on me for being a douchebag coming up with such a name, it was told to 
me by one of my women friends.  Anyway, if you followed my tips and tricks from the previous chapter, 
chances are she’s going to want to roll over and carry on with the date the next morning when all you 
want to do is sleep and tell her to get the hell out of your house.  But of course, to do such things 
requires tact and careful planning.
Just to be sure that we’re on the same page here; the claim to having an “early morning meeting” isn’t 
going to cut it.  This phrase has become code for, “Get the hell out of my bed and go home”.  You may 
be selfish enough to not care about hurting her feelings, but you should care.  Not only are you blowing 
your chances at having another date with this girl but she WILL tell all of her friends about the shitty 
things you’ve done and they WILL come after you (I had one girl bury rotten eggs in the soil beneath my 
living room window.  Within days my house reeked and I had no clue WHY until she told me her friends 
buried the eggs there.  I would have never found them otherwise).  Besides, are you really that big of 
an asshole that you have no empathy towards the feelings of someone who gave themselves to you?
So I think it’s important to start with…
How to Kick a Woman Out of Your Bed
I’m going to start out with some inexcusable excuses here that men sometimes try to shovel to women 
and expect them to lap up.  We already mentioned the early meeting, but some others are:
•	
I have a flight to catch in the morning… (if dropped at the last moment – see 
below)
•	
My mom is actually going to come over at about 7am to help me with some 
housework, so…
•	
My roommate really doesn’t like girls staying over.  Freaks him out or some shit.  
I’m kind of behind paying rent and I owe him, so…
•	
I have this disorder where I can’t actually sleep when someone else is in my 
room.
•	
I got what I wanted from you.  Now find your way home.
These all fail.  
The Preamble
Kicking a woman out of your bed begins before you even get her in it.  If you do legitimately have 
a flight to catch in the morning, mention that during the date portion at the restaurant, bar, café, or 
where ever you go for your date and then drop it.  Don’t worry; she’ll remember that you’re traveling 
somewhere because that’s interesting.  When you mention it later that night, she’ll know you’re telling 
the truth.
Hell, even if you don’t have a flight to catch in the morning, that’s always a good one to use.
This also works for early meetings, or if you ARE meeting up with your Ma early to do some housework 
or go shopping with you.  Think of any excuse that would leave you leaving the house early, and having 
Kicking Her Outta The Sack
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online

194
Chapter 14 - Kicking Her Outta The Sack
to have her get the hell out because she doesn’t have a key to lock your door.
NOTE:  I don’t care how much you like this girl; do NOT give her a key to your door, even if you’re 
certain that you are completely in love with her!
After mentioning an event forcing you to leave early in the morning, be sure throughout the date to 
not get her completely sloshed.  And I mean WASTED.  This girl should be conscious at all times so the 
option of sending her home is always feasible.  If the girl is a total lush, you’ll know this by the first or 
second drink.  Try to help pace her if she does seem like a complete boozehound.  She wants another 
drink?  Go for a walk.  Go dance.  Get her to drink some water and eat some bread or pasta.
I’m not going to lie: keeping a girl from getting drunk is pretty hard.  She sort of WANTS to be drunk, 
so she can be taken advantage of and then blame it on the booze.  Then again, she doesn’t want to look 
like a complete fool either.  Because of this, it’s helpful to lean in close to her if she’s getting a bit tipsy 
and tell her that she’s starting to look a bit messy and follow up with “I like that sort of thing”.  She 
won’t even hear that last bit you said; she’ll be focusing on you saying she looks messy and then obsess 
about appearing normal and pretty.
Another good way to kick a girl out of your bed is to make a promise for later.  Promise to see her 
again.  Talk about a second date before you two get to bangin’.  Talk about how much you enjoy her 
company and talk about different ways to contact her: email, instant messenger, and phone, whatever.  
If you are quite attracted to the girl, hopefully you’ve been smart enough to make another date already.  
If you aren’t so attracted to her but want to give it a go, make tentative plans to call her later in the 
week and figure shit out.
Having a later date makes it easier to kick her out since she knows she will see you again.  Sex, for a 
woman, is an emotional bond; it’s not just a physical thing.  If they know they’ll see you again, or at 
least have that idea floating around in their brain, they’ll feel less inclined to stick around since they 
know they’ll be back in that bed later.
After The Moment
If you played your cards right, you will be able to use your earlier excuse to get the woman out of your 
bed after sex successfully.  But when do you drop this bomb on her?
No, you do not tell her right after you climax that you have an early meeting.
No, you do not roll over, begin to fall asleep and mumble to her that she better leave now because you 
have that flight you told her about.
No, you do not wait until she’s half asleep to suggest to her that she dress and get back to her place.
After sex, you both need a cool down period, when you separate and allow the sweat to evaporate from  
your bodies.  Then when she’s comfortable, she will either move to you or lay her head on your chest 
or, in 2-5 minutes, you invite her over to cuddle or suggest that you spoon her from behind.  Talk a bit.  
It doesn’t have to be about how GREAT the sex is (though a quick mention of how beautiful she is can 
work well); talk about casual things that make sense to the flow of the conversations you were having 
prior to sex.
I can’t really help you with the subject here, since who the fuck knows what you two were talking 
about.  Whatever it is, though, include kissing her body – shoulder, hands, neck – and continue to softy 
caress her body.  She wants to feel loved and cared for, dammit, and it’s your responsibility to ensure 
that she does. 
Just when she seems like she may be becoming a tad too comfortable laying there next to you, you 
must make your move (it’s plain rude to try and move someone when they’re on the brink of sleep, so 
be sure to avoid doing that.  Otherwise, she’ll have a soured view of you).  That’s when you kiss her and 
The Dating Commando

Chapter 14 - Kicking Her Outta The Sack
softly say,
“Hey babe, so remember that flight I told you about earlier?  I have to be up in a 
couple of hours for that, but I want to be sure you get home safe.  Shall we end the 
date in my car?”  
If you don’t have a car, offer to pay for her taxi.  No, you are not paying for sex, you’re taking care of 
a woman who has spent her evening sharing herself with you and, as a good man, are ensuring she’s 
getting home properly.
Since you mentioned the flight earlier, long before you guys even ended up in this situation, she’ll 
have no reason to NOT get out of your bed.  I guarantee you she will act surprised or embarrassed 
and say something along the lines of, “Oh!  Of course!  Yeah… just give me a 
second here…”  And then give her the respect of getting dressed in private if she 
seems to need that time (most girls do; they think we give a shit about cellulite or 
breast shape.  I honestly don’t, just as long as I’m getting some).
If you did not bother with the preamble set up, you’re fucked.  There has been 
no mention of having to get out of your place early or your roommate having 
some sort of issue.  It’s a Sunday tomorrow, the day of rest, and she’s under the 
impression that she’s free to stay the night and rest.
This is a very tricky and delicate situation.  Now, you can claim to have some 
early flight or roommate issue, but she’ll instantly be suspicious.  If you choose to 
go this route, be sure to make plans to see her again.  And be sure you actually 
DO make plans to see her again.  If you say you’re going to call tomorrow, CALL 
TOMORROW.  Otherwise she AND her friends will think you’re a piece of shit and you will suffer 
greatly, which we’ll cover in the next segment.
Another way to try and get her out is to compliment her on her appearance (it’s appropriate at 
this point, since you’ve seen her naked) and then continue to compliment her on her intelligence.  
To compliment her intelligence, link it to something she said earlier that could be construed as 
intelligence, like bring up her time she spent in college or in the army or whatever-the-fuck.  Just be 
sure to not focus on appearance compliments, otherwise she WILL feel like just another piece of ass.  
Then tell her that you want to see her home safely and you’ll get the car warmed up for her, OR you 
want to go with her in the cab to be sure she arrives home safely.
That’s right, you get your ass in that cab with her and make sure she gets home safely.  No guys do 
that, so you need to be the guy who does.  You want to be sure to take care of your lady, even if she’s 
just your lady for one night and you have NO interest in talking to her ever again.  She’ll protest and 
say that you don’t need to come with her in the cab, blahblahblah, but do it anyway.  She wants you 
to.  She’ll feel flattered and loved.  So just fuckin’ do it and pay the double cab fare.
Hell, even if you have a car, offering to do this will make a very positive impression on her, so 
consider it – especially if she lives fairly close to you and you can get away without paying through 
your ass for a ride.
How To Cover Your Tracks
Nothing’s worse than being called out on your slutty ways.  NOTHING.  This is why it’s important for 
you to cover you tracks at all costs.
First, it is absolutely imperative that you keep abreast of the happenings on your social networking 
and dating profile walls.  If anything on those sites alludes to you having dates recently or being a 
slut, DELETE THEM.  If any of the pictures that are up show you with lewd women and disgusting 
men, DELETE THEM.  If anything that you have up on these sites is something that you previously 
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online
It’s really important 
to set up your 
exit plan well in 
advance if you 
expect her to “buy 
it.”  Otherwise, you 
might find yourself 
in a very awkward 
situation.

196
Chapter 14 - Kicking Her Outta The Sack
lied about, DELETE THAT INFORMATION.  You want to be sure that your social networking sites and 
dating profile match up with the shit you’ve been spewing to your women.
This also means keeping your profiles on these sites free from mentioning that you are a player, a 
pimp, or even a Dating Commando.  If you have options to recreate your status, like on Facebook, 
keep the updates respectable.  Don’t think that using some inside joke with your friends is going to 
fool any girl you date either; we all get your shitty joke, alright?
Speaking of Facebook, if you were dumb enough to add her as a friend be sure to keep her on 
LIMITED PROFILE.  Facebook will now allow you to limit just one person’s access to whatever parts 
of your Facebook page that you do not want them to see.  Though she may suspect that you have 
blocked her from some things, girls more often than not don’t bother mentioning it.
Now, this little bit doesn’t apply to you if you have found your dream girl who you want to marry and 
all that bullshit.  But chances are, the girl that you slept with last night is not your DREAM GIRL.  She 
is just a girl whom you enjoyed, though you may not have any REAL interest in seeing her again.
So how do you cover your ass when you promised to call the girl tomorrow but have no real interest 
in seeing her again tomorrow?
You call her again.  And you make plans to see her tomorrow.
Okay, yes, I know, it’s far easier for you to avoid her completely or to just NOT CALL.  But do you 
know how many men and women pussy out and take this route?  Really, it’s quite disgusting.  So take 
the minutes out of your day to tell the girl IN PERSON, either directly or in indirect ways that will allow 
you to avoid her calls later.  Man up about it and own your shit.
Again, if you agree to call or contact her in a specified amount of time, you MUST do it.  Here’s some 
consolation, though: women are far more prone to not pick up your calls or respond to your messages 
out of embarrassment, so from that point on you’re off the hook!  If they do pick up, however, make 
plans to meet them again at any place they want.
When you actually meet her for the second time, you have two options: Come out and tell her 
that you are dating around and getting a feel for the scene, so would she mind being in an open 
relationship (though this risks her not calling you back if she is down with that sort of thing)?  Or 
you can act completely disinterested throughout the entire date and be distant (though this risks her 
calling you back too - if for no other reason than to scream about what a dick you are).
Oh, wait…there is a third option: tell her you’re going into the Army.  Navy.  Marines.  Whatever will 
take you away from that area for a good length of time.

I know some of these tactics may appear harsh or manipulative, but what’s the alternative?  If the 
girl really likes you, but it’s not working for you, try telling her the truth and see how that cheers her 
up.  You’re attempting to break things off with her here, without crushing her ego.  Which leads to…

How To Break It Off (As Nicely As Possible)
If you are truly not interested in contacting this woman again, either for conversation or sex, there 
are many different ways you can go about breaking it off.  Each come with their own pros and cons, 
and both will probably result in you getting in a bit of hot water, but some women are more conducive 
to certain closings than others.  We will begin with…
The Direct Approach
This is exactly how it sounds.  You tell her straight up that you don’t want to see her ass again – 
though not in those EXACT words.  
YOU: “Look, I’ve had a great time getting to know you and I look at you as being a 
blessing and positive influence in my life.  Unfortunately, you’re just not the one.  I 
want to tell you this up front and right away because I feel you deserve the best in 
your life and you shouldn’t have to wait or waste your time in a relationship that will 
ultimately end.”
Be sure not to insult, or pick out her flaws.  Simply tell her that you do not think things will work out 
between you both, or do not make plans to see her again.  Just say no.  Sure, the truth hurts here, so 
make it as respectful of her feelings as you can.
Works best with: serial daters, confident women, busy women
The Gradual Approach
This is what most guys seem to do.  To gradually remove a girl’s talons from yourself, you stop 
returning her calls.  When you DO return her calls, you keep conversations to less than 5 minutes and 
always have some excuse for having to go (work, friend, someone else calling you).  You do not make 
any future plans to meet up, and you give her probably one of two bullshit lines:
“I’m really busy with my career right now and need to focus on it…”
Or
“I just got out of a long term relationship and I don’t think I’m ready to date yet…”
Not ready to date yet, but ready to get laid, right chief?  But don’t tell HER that.
Works best with:  Occasional daters, girls just out of relationships, Delusional girls, dreamers
The Ex Approach
This is when you tell the girl (or let’s be real here – LIE) that you are reconciling with your ex-
girlfriend.  You and she had a long drawn out discussion yesterday and you have decided that your two 
year relationship or whatever-the-fuck isn’t worth tossing out quite yet.
Now, this may SEEM to be a good approach at the time.  Girls will empathize, they won’t take offense 
(they understand the whole “ex’s getting back with ex’s” deal) and they may even wish you both luck.  
But this shit takes a LOT of maintenance!
Remember where you met this girl: AN ONLINE DATING SITE.  Remember who you are no longer 
dating: THIS GIRL.  So where do you think she’ll be hunting down her next man?  THAT SAME DAMN 
SITE!
If she notices you changing your headlines, your pictures, not altering your status, or just hanging 
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online

198
Chapter 14 - Kicking Her Outta The Sack
around there in general, she will instantly be suspicious and think that something’s up.  If you use this 
line and want to seem convincing, you stay the hell away from your profile for a good two weeks (if 
not more).  After two weeks, a valid amount of time has passed for both you and your ex to realize 
that you are NOT soul mates, and that you both have moved on to greener pastures, as they say.
If she notices you’re back on that shit that same day, expect womanly wrath.  In 
case you haven’t experienced it, trust me – it’s worse than a root canal with no 
anesthetic.
Works best with:  Women who have just gotten out of relationships, positive 
women, dreamers.
The Pussy Approach
This is when you just full on avoid calling the girl back.  She’s expecting a call 
from you, she’s calling YOU, messaging YOU, emailing YOU and you’re just shoving 
your head in the sand and waiting for her to go away.  You think maybe she’ll get 
the hint – and oh, she will – but trust me, this kind of shit will definitely have both 
her and her friends hunting you down for the kill.
Works best with: NO ONE.  Balls up, jackass, and call her back.  
How To Keep Her Friends From Killing You
Let’s face it, if you end the date badly or practice ANY shitty behavior, the scorned girl is going to run 
to her girlfriends and they’ll have a goddamn hen party over your ass.  They’ll come up with the worst 
names to call you, and the best ideas on how to get back at you.
More often than not, the girl and her friends hardly bother to get revenge on an asshole that made 
the wrong move.  But when you’re online, and she knows you’re online, and she knows WHERE you 
are online, she and her friends will be sorely tempted to leave nasty messages on your online account.   
Some of these messages include:
Slut!  MANWHORE!  MOTHERFUCKER!!!!
And
Do NOT date this man.  He gave me three STDs and all we did was kiss!
Or
He may say that he’s tucking his dick between his legs, but there is no dick there.  It’s 
a vagina.  He is a she!
Okay, no matter HOW unbelievable these stories may be, what these say to other women is this:  
You know how to piss off women; you are probably a jerk, so she better avoid you because you spell 
T-R-O-U-B-L-E.
Keeping yourself in the good zone with both the girl you dated AND her friends is to be one suave 
motherfucker.  Don’t get angry; get flirty and funny.  For instance, instead of commenting angrily to 
that middle comment, you can say something along the lines of:
That wasn’t from me, sweetie.  That was from the toilet bowl you kissed after you had 
one too many martinis.  I’m hoping my kissing skills were better than the porcelain 
throne, though.

Chapter 14 - Kicking Her Outta The Sack
Bear in mind that these messages left for you ARE often from her friends; if her friends didn’t directly 
do it, then they probably gave her the lines or coaxed her into it.  Her friends or your ex-date  will 
either reply calling you an asshole, laugh, or she’ll comment on how your kissing skills suck ass.  Do 
not take the opportunity to retort; laugh it off, suggest you could tell how much she liked them, and 
compliment her on her skills (“I love that little thing you did with your tongue.  Fantastic”).  I find that 
after her second attempt at pissing you off fails, she both jumps right back on you and begins flirting 
back, or she fucks off.
It’s important for me to mention here to the idiots that, if she and her friends are leaving these 
messages for you publicly, delete them.  Then reply to her in a private email.  If she replies publicly 
again, delete the message again and reply in a private email.
If she or her friends send a barrage of angry, hate filled messages to you, ignore them.  They’re all 
just raging and you have far more important things to do with your time.  They’ll soon tire of it when 
they see you’re not responding.
In Person
So you’re at a bar, you’re hanging with your friends when a group of three women you have never 
seen approach you.  And you think “sweet!” but wait...
You can probably see them coming from afar, like a group of bitchy ball busters who have their screw 
faces on (I learned that one from the urban dictionary.  Translation: “to scowl or frown at another 
individual; a look of disgust or distaste”).  You figure they cannot possibly be coming up to you 
(because you’re innocent and nice, right?) but you’re preeetty sure that they’re looking at you and not 
your buddy beside you.
And then they stop right in front of you.  Oh god… oh dear god…
FRIEND #1: “Hey ASSHOLE. What the FUCK?” 
You’re not exactly sure what they’re talking about, so you ask for clarification.
YOU: “Uhm, hi… sorry, do I know you ladies?”
FRIEND #1: “YEAH.  We’re Jasmine’s FRIENDS you ASSHOLE.  What the FUCK?”
You’re still pretty confused.  Jasmine, Jasmine… Ooooh JASMINE.  You dated and slept with the girl a 
couple of weeks back and pretty much dumped her, but how did these bitches know who you were?
FRIEND #2: “We SAW your FACEBOOK and we RECOGNIZED YOU.”
Fuckin’ Facebook.  You curse and silently vow to delete your entire profile when you get home.  But 
in the mean time, your grinning, idiot buddies are laughing at you and these women CLEARLY want to 
bust your balls.  
Keep it cool, keep it together.  Breathe.  Time to flirtatiously reason with these women.
YOU: “Okay, okay… so I’m guessing you didn’t like the fact that I cut things off with 
Jasmine.”
FRIEND #1: “YEAH.  You FUCK her and then you CHUCK her?  What the FUCK?”
NOTE: one friend will be doing the majority of the talking, while the other two usually are standing 
there with their screw faces STILL on and their arms crossed.  Target the talker; she’s the ring leader.

Chapter 14 - Kicking Her Outta The Sack
YOU: “I know, okay.  Look, I really like your friend Jasmine.  And we had a good time 
which, I’m not sure if she told you, but we BOTH agreed to and we BOTH had fun.  But 
I think she was looking for a quick lay and I want something a bit more long term.”
This is totally complete bullshit and the opposite from the truth.  Undoubtedly the girls will begin 
tossing their hair and clucking like hens at you.
FRIEND #3: “That’s SO not true!”
FRIEND #2: “She thought she had something long term with you!”
FRIEND #1: “You KNOW that’s bullshit.  She REALLY REALLY LIKED YOU.”
Time to make up some bullshit excuse about how you feel slightly used.
YOU: “Well, she was putting the pressure on all night for the “fun” activities later.  I’d 
try to take things a bit slower, and she kept pushing me.  If I was wrong about her, I’m 
very sorry.  I meant no disrespect.  Really.”  
Now drop your eyes and check out the ring leader for JUST a second.  She may have an offended 
look on her face and start bitching.  Again, apologize and use an opening line that I taught you from 
the beginning:
YOU: “I’m sorry, it’s just that… that dress looks stunning on you.”
REMEMBER, it is important to not say that she’s PRETTY or BEAUTIFUL, compliment what she’s 
wearing.  You’ll melt this ice queen with lines like that and, if you play the game right, you’ll bag this 
girl too.
I have to issue a warning here.  If you are too flirty with the girls’ friends, word will get back to the 
initial girl and they’ll want your head on a stick.  If her friend doesn’t go along with your flirting, she’ll 
remain pissed at you and call you a dog along with more unflattering names.  If she DOES, however, 
get suckered in by the flirting, she’ll no longer hate you; she will hate her friend.  Go figure.
Some of the friends will not be receptive to your flirting whatsoever, especially if they are already 
in happy relationships and have no interest in men like yourself.  Apologize, ask for the friends to 
send your apologies along to the girl you offended and WALK AWAY.  Leave the scene.  Women will 
continue to pick at you and pick at you until you DO leave, so it’s best to walk away from the scene for 
a few minutes to allow them to vacate the area.
Whatever you do, do not be snide, snippy, insulting, or cruel in response to her friends.  They may 
be immature enough to swear and berate you in front of tons of people, but if you behave maturely 
and take the high road, they will be the ones left looking foolish.  Worse case scenario: there you are, 
gang swarmed on the floor; irate, screaming chicks putting the boots to you.  Oh well.  Take your shit 
kickin’ like a man and then run (you can’t hit a girl, so don’t even think about it!).
Avoid Where You Met Her
This is important, both online and offline.  Offline, it’s easy to explain; if you met a girl in a bar or a 
café, then it is smart to choose to go to the Starbucks that is undoubtedly across the street from your 
usual Starbucks of choice.  Avoid that bar for a couple of months and go to another one, or drink at 
home (you’ll save money too.  What a bonus!).
Online is a bit more tricky, but this is why it is a good idea to have more than one dating profile on 
the internet.  Set one up on Lavalife, set one up on Plenty of Fish, hell even set one up on Craigslist.  
The Dating Commando

201
Chapter 14 - Kicking Her Outta The Sack
Keep in mind that if you dated a month or longer, the girl will troll for you for quiet some time.  If you 
met her on Plenty of Fish, either move on to another of your internet profiles OR, if that’s not possible, 
make very few changes to your profile. 
•	
No major picture changes.
•	
No major headline changes.
•	
No increase in being on favorite lists.
Making major changes to your profile will only make her feel all the more rejected since you are 
returning to the dating pool where you met her, and indirectly tells her she wasn’t good enough.  This 
will only upset the poor lass and will either cause her or one of her friends to lash out at you.  Besides, 
you’re better than that.  Your motto should be to return them in better condition than you found them 
in.
If you met the girl online via another online route (say, some sort of chat room or game like Second 
Life) avoid going to that chat room for awhile, or when playing Second Life do not return to the places 
where you usually met this woman.  Basically follow common sense here: where you know she goes, 
you do NOT go.  However, if you run into her…
How To Leave Her Wanting More (Even If You Were A Complete 
Jerk!)
…you can still turn the tables and make her want more of you.  Even if you ended things poorly, 
like not calling her when you said you would or even cutting out on a date that you two made, it is 
possible to salvage this shit.
A very important thing to keep in mind here is that if a girl is going to bother holding a grudge and 
being very angry and verbally abusive towards you, she fuckin’ CARES about you.  Respect that.  It’s 
the girls who don’t say shit and just sneer at you that don’t give two shits.
Anger is passion.  Passion is sexy.  Capitalize on that shit – or at least TRY (even 
though you may very well fail).
Running Into The Hot Head
If you run into the hot head, you’ll know it.  She’s the one who will stride through 
any place she sees you in; she will get right up in your face, and start a tantrum in 
front of everyone.
“You think it’s okay how you treated me?  You think it’s OKAY to make promises that 
you can’t keep?  Hmm?  Who do you think you are?  Just what kind of asshole ARE 
you?”
In real life this is marked with far more expletives, but you get the picture.
Do not TOUCH the hot head; do not INTERRUPT the hot head with your own angry remarks.  As soon 
as she starts in at you, start backing up while motioning and softly verbally coaxing her to move to 
a quieter, less dense area of where ever you are.  Keep your tone low; this is important, since she’ll 
eventually feel like a bully by yelling at you, and she will soon lower her tone to match yours.
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online
“It’s best to return her in better condition 
than she was when you found her.”
Anger is PASSION.  
Passion is SEXY.  
Capitalize on her 
passion!

Chapter 14 - Kicking Her Outta The Sack
So now comes the big question.  You didn’t call her back; why not?
YOU: “I felt…used.” (This one’s always great if you two had sex)
She’s going to scoff at this.  All girls do; they figure that we’re a bunch of whores that are just out to 
get a piece (not an entirely false assumption).
HER: “Used?  USED?  Oh my god, YOU used ME!”
YOU: “No… no, though things did move very fast and you and I just got along so well 
it… it scares me, that’s all.”
She’ll ask you why you are or WERE scared, and here is where you blather a bunch of bullshit about 
the shit you two had in common, how you still find her both physically and mentally very attractive 
and how you were not banking on you two becoming such an ideal match.
HER: “You could have called me to TELL me that though, you know?  Leaving me 
waiting and waiting and wondering is just rude.”
YOU: “You’re right, I’m not proud of how I reacted in this situation.  But seeing you 
again here, in front of me...even though you’re yelling at me and clearly pissed, 
I’m very happy to see you again [smile].  I really enjoyed our time together.  Look, 
I messed up the first time, but could I perhaps take you out for an apology dinner 
tomorrow night?”
If she takes you up on that offer, FANTASTIC.  If she doesn’t, offer another day of the week.  If she 
doesn’t take you up on that offer, and she does not have another suggestion for another day, she’s 
not interested.  Conclude with how nice it was to see her again and wish her the best in whatever 
endeavor she is pursuing at the time.
If you two did not have sex, but she expected the call back that she never got, skip the used line and 
move right into the I’M SCARED bullshit.
The Sarcastic, Witty Woman
These are the girls who will approach you, not angrily, but usually with a twisted lip and a snide 
remark, like, “Hey, thanks for calling me back.”
The good news is that they ARE angry, but the bad news is that they’re probably even more bitter 
and jaded by the situation than the hot head.  They’ve probably processed your rejection more deeply 
and are taking a greater hit to their self esteem (nice job btw, asshole).
You can try the “I’m scared” line on them, but these girls seem to be able to read bullshit far better 
than the hot heads.  If you pull that line on them, you’ll get a raised skeptical eyebrow and more snide 
remarks.
With these girls, I like to call myself out directly.  If she’s being sarcastic, she’s beating around the 
issue, so you should show your maturity and acknowledge that yeah, you ARE a bit of a dick!
YOU: “Know what?  You’re right.  I’m a dick and a total pussy for not calling you 
back.”
HER: “Let me guess, you asked for my number and yet had NO intention of calling me 
back, right?  Pfft.. Typical.”
The Dating Commando

203
Chapter 14 - Kicking Her Outta The Sack
YOU: “No, that’s not true.  I wanted to call you back, but I honestly didn’t think that 
you were that into me.  Hell, when I thought about it, I was sure that you gave me 
your number just to be polite!”
See how you put it on her?  Now SHE has some explaining to do, even though she really did nothing 
wrong.
HER: “Why oh why would I give you my number to be polite?  I would have given you 
a fake one.”
YOU: “Hey, I never claimed to be the smartest guy on the block [insert laugh here].  
Look, I’m really sorry; I didn’t mean to hurt you.”
HER: (She’ll probably interject quickly here) “You didn’t hurt me.”
YOU: “Well, what I did was rude and unkind, and I am sorry.  You’re a wonderful girl 
and I’d love to make this up to you…”
And that’s where you try to set up another date.  Remember, offer two days, and if she rejects both 
dates and doesn’t have a day to suggest that works for her, say goodbye and close politely.
Even if you don’t get a second date out of the deal, you still can end things on a positive note so you 
are not harming your treasured reputation.
The Silent Type
Oh god, these are my least favorite of all.  These are the girls that will turn their eyes into slits and 
glare at you from the corner of the coffee shop, and everyone in the place KNOWS she’s killing you 
with her stare.
This girl doesn’t have the balls to approach you, though she’s obviously still seething.  This is where 
you have to take control of the situation and put her at ease.  Go get your drink, your food, or 
whatever it is, meet her gaze (not with anger but with a pleasant, friendly expression) and walk to her 
table.  Ask if you may sit down with her.  If she has friends at the table, ask if you could speak to her 
for a moment privately; her friends need not be there to chip in to the conversation.
YOU: “I’m not going to pretend I don’t notice you staring me down, and I’m also 
not going to pretend that I didn’t call you back.  I know I didn’t, and I can see it’s 
upsetting you.”
Either she will deny, or she’ll stay silent (I hate it when they don’t say shit; it doesn’t give you much 
to work with, but she’ll open up eventually).
YOU: “I didn’t call you back because I thought you were just giving me your number 
to be nice.  There were a few times when we were talking when you just didn’t seem 
interested.”
NOW she’ll reply.
HER: “What?  Like when?”
YOU: “Like when I was talking about [whatever the hell you two talked about], your 
eyes seemed to wander a bit so I thought you were just humoring me the whole time.”
The Ultimate Kick-Ass Guide To Conquering Women Online

Chapter 14 - Kicking Her Outta The Sack
HER: “That’s so not how it was.”
YOU: “Well, that’s what I saw.  If I misunderstood, I’m sorry.  I just didn’t want to 
call the number and get a WRONG number like so many girls do…or to be rejected…I 
should have put the effort in though.  Maybe we can give this another shot?”
She may say yes, which gives you the easy in to make a date.  If she says no, take one more stab at 
it.
YOU: “Look, I wouldn’t have bothered to come over here and talk to you if I wasn’t 
interested.  Let me make things right.  My treat.”
If she still says no, fine.  But I bet she will probably say yes.  ONLY go this route if you really want to 
see her again.  If not, don’t be so foolish as to set yourself up for more of the same greed.
NOTE: Remember that the most important thing here is to diffuse the situation.  You want to drain 
the anger out of her and, even if you can’t make her love you, you can at least get her to like you 
enough to leave you the hell alone.
The Closer
You already fucked up on the closer once with these girls; it’s important that you close 
APPROPRIATELY so that they do not end up hating you even more the second time around.
NOTE:  The second time around, closing with an explanation that you don’t really think it would 
work out between you two is perfectly appropriate – just not immediately after sex.  She will still feel 
rejected slightly by you, as everyone naturally does, but a rational girl will appreciate the fact that you 
actually gave her that explanation and moved along.
An irrational girl, however, is always an irrational girl.  You may just have to ignore her until she fucks 
off completely if she’s still coming at you.

Chapter Conclusion
Always create an escape route during your first few dates on the off-chance that you do 
have sex with this girl (unless you are one of the few guys who enjoy having company in the 
morning).
If you want nothing else to do with the girl, do not keep her hanging around!  Block her off 
from any social networking or dating sites that give her access to you.
Call the girl and explain whether you are or aren’t interested.  Hold to that promise to call. This 
is a sure-fire way to prevent having some girl hell-bent on revenge attacking you, either on the 
computer or in real life.
Oh, and stay away from the places where you’ve met, either on the computer or in real life.
Mack on her friends if you have “broken up” with your target.  Hey, an opportunity is an 
opportunity, right?
