 Preface 
 I wrote the first two editions of this book on organization devel-
opment (OD) in 1987 and 1994, respectively. The significant change 
for this third edition is the addition of my coauthor, Debra Noumair. 
We have been colleagues at Teachers College, Columbia University, 
for two decades and have worked together on numerous projects and 
several courses within our social-organizational psychology programs, 
which she now directs.  
 It was clear that the second edition, slightly more than 20 years 
old, was dated. It was also clear that some more recent perspectives 
and additions were in order, such as integrating covert processes 
into organization diagnosis, consulting to loosely coupled systems, 
and coaching and OD. Although massive change in the field has not 
occurred in the last two decades, plenty of change has evolved. There-
fore, instead of the 11 chapters in the second edition, we now have 
14, and with an exception or two (history remains the same), all other 
chapters have been revised, some significantly, such as  Chapters  2 , 
 12 , and  14 . A chapter-by-chapter summary follows, but a few words 
of clarification first: the intended audience for this book and some 
personal biases.  
 We have three audiences in mind: (1) the manager, executive, or 
administrator—that is, a potential user of organization development; 
(2) the practitioner in the field—that is, a user who may need some 
guidelines for his or her practice either as a consultant internal to an 
organization or as an external consultant working with a consulting 
firm or as an independent practitioner; and (3) the student—one who 
may in the future use the information provided in either of roles (1) 
or (2).  
 And now a brief word of clarification: Although we believe we 
have been reasonably objective in defining and describing OD, the 
theories underlying the field, and the way practitioners typically work, 
we do have a bias. While defining OD, we also present what we think 
OD  should be; that is, a clear goal of change in the organization’s cul-
ture. An organization’s culture is the single greatest barrier to change 
for any system, whether profit-making or nonprofit, government,

xiii
educational, or religious institution. Not everyone will agree with this 
bias, but agreement or disagreement should not prevent a reasonable 
understanding of how we  have described the concepts and practices 
of organization development.  
 What follows is a summary statement of the content for each of 
the 14 chapters organized in three parts plus a Conclusion.  
 Part  I , “The Field of Organization Development”  
 Chapter  1 , “What Is Organization Development?,” presents an 
actual case based on a consulting assignment, which succinctly 
illustrates the primary characteristics of OD practice, although 
taking into account what OD should be (our bias), it does not 
exemplify what OD really is.  
 
 Chapter  2 , “Organization Development Then and Now,” is sig-
nificantly revised and focuses on the impact of the external en-
vironment on OD. It first summarizes the previous second edi-
tion with the nine significant changes between 1969 and 1994 
and then covers nine newer trends that are under way as of 
2014 and likely will be influential for the foreseeable future.  
 
 Chapter  3 , “Where Did Organization Development Come 
From?,” remains essentially the same as before and traces the 
roots or forerunners of the field as well as briefly describes ten 
theories related to organizational behavior that underlie OD 
practice.   
 Chapter  4 , “Organization Development as a Process of Change,” 
covers the fundamental models of change that guide OD prac-
titioners and, using another actual case to illustrate, also covers 
the phases of consultation that OD practitioners follow in their 
practice.    
 Part  II  , “Understanding Organizations: Diagnosis”  
 Chapter  5 , “Defining the Client: A Different Perspective,” ad-
dresses the question of who the client is, which might seem 
obvious, but isn’t. This perspective considers the client in terms 
of relationships.  

xiv 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 
 Chapter  6 , “Understanding Organizations: The Process of Di-
agnosis,” describes some of the most common frameworks or 
organizational models that OD practitioners use after they have 
conducted their interviews and perhaps administered question-
naires, made their observations, and read some documents and 
then attempted to make systematic sense out of what often at 
first seems a mass of confusing data.  
 
 Chapter  7 , “The Burke-Litwin Model of Organizational Perfor-
mance and Change,” extends and builds on the previous chap-
ter by describing our own way of thinking about organizations 
and changing them. The significant change that occurred at 
British Airways during the latter half of the 1980s is explained 
to illustrate how the Burke-Litwin model was used as a frame-
work.   
 Chapter  8 , “Understanding Organizations: Covert Processes,” 
is a new chapter that addresses those organizational issues that 
exist beneath the surface—the “undiscussables,” matters of col-
lusion, and what might be referred to as the collective uncon-
scious. Central to the chapter is an actual case that brings these 
issues to the surface and provides a framework for integrating 
covert processes with OD models, tools, and practice.  
 Part  III  , “Changing Organizations”  
 Chapter  9 , “Planning and Managing Change,” explains what 
OD practitioners do after the diagnostic phase and includes 
many of the primary steps involved in managing change as well 
as theory about organizational culture change. With change in 
general being more rapid than ever and with organizations be-
ing more differentiated than ever, we end the chapter with two 
caveats—we may not have as much time to plan our change 
effort as we would like, and we can no longer assume that most 
organizations today follow the organizational model of General 
Motors in the days of Alfred P. Sloan (1946),  the model of its 
day for corporate America.  
 
 Chapter  10 , “Understanding and Changing Loosely Coupled 
Systems,” another new chapter, compares and contrasts loosely 
coupled systems with tightly coupled systems and explores the 

 
PREFACE 
xv
complexities of attempting to change a loosely coupled system, 
a network or political party, for example. Social network analy-
sis is a popular and useful tool for understanding loosely cou-
pled systems. Other political tools and interventions, such as 
large group techniques that can be useful for changing a loosely 
versus tightly coupled system, are explored.  
 
 Chapter  11 , “Does Organization Development Work?,” pres-
ents some summary evidence that OD does work, brings the 
evidence up to date, highlights the issues in evaluating OD ef-
forts, and provides the key reasons in support of conducting an 
evaluation.   
 
 Chapter  12 , “The Organization Development Consultant,” is 
significantly revised and covers OD consultant roles and func-
tions, abilities required of an OD practitioner, OD values, ways 
to become an OD consultant, self as instrument, and reflective 
practice. This chapter also addresses the shift toward integrat-
ing OD skills into line functions and managerial and leadership 
roles in organizations.  
 
 Chapter  13 , “Coaching and Organization Development,” an-
other new chapter, covers the field of coaching and its relation 
to OD. Although coaching as a process of teaching and learning 
has been around for centuries, as a distinct field within organi-
zations and primarily for executives, managers, and supervisors, 
it is comparatively new. There are different roles and functions 
of coaching and OD practitioners need not only be aware of 
these processes, but also incorporate coaching into organization 
development and change.  
 Conclusion  
 Chapter  14 , “Organization Development and the Future,” 
is significantly revised and provides an overview of current 
and future trends in OD and then summarizes four primary 
trends currently under way and likely to influence the field 
of OD in the foreseeable future. These four are dialogic OD, 
leadership development, positive psychology, and agility both 
organizational and individual. The chapter ends with an overall 
summary.

ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Writing a book—even one that is a revision, a third edition of an 
earlier one—requires long hours of digging into the more recent and 
relevant literature, concentrating on what needs updating, what new 
topics need to be added, and what is not necessary to incorporate into 
this latest edition. But the long hours have been rewarding because 
new learning for us has been realized. This learning has come from 
both new theory concepts and research, as well as from new and dif-
ferent practice. The joy comes from seeing how theory and research 
can influence practice and how practice can inform  what new research 
and theory needs to be conducted. Completing this third edition 
therefore strengthens our self-identity of being scholar-practitioners.  
 And, finally, with respect to helping us to bring this book to the 
printed page, we wish to express our deep gratitude to Ms. Ambar 
Ureña for her skill at typing and use of the computer, her administra-
tive abilities, and most important, her positive, can-do attitude.

 What Is Organization Development? 
 The term  organization development, or OD, the label most com-
monly used for the field, has been in use since at least 1960. In the 
’60s and early ’70s, jokes about what the abbreviation OD meant were 
common. Today, few people in the world of large organizations asso-
ciate OD with overdose, olive drab, or officer of the day, however. 
Organization development as a field may not yet be sufficiently known 
to be defined in the dictionary or explained in the  Encyclopedia Bri-
tannica, but it has survived some turbulent times and will be around 
for the foreseeable future. Although not defined in these well-known  
standards for definitions, organization development is defined in the 
 Encyclopedia of Management Theory, Volume Two (Kessler, 2013) 
albeit requiring more than five double-columned pages. Moreover if 
we do check Webster’s dictionary and look for the definition of  devel-
opment, we will find that part of the definition is as follows: 
 
•  Evolve possibilities 
 
•  Make active 
 
•  Promote growth 
 
•  Make available or usable resources the organization has 
 
•  Move from an original position to one that provides more 
opportunity for effective use  
 In other words, we could hardly do better attempting to find a 
more appropriate lead-in to what OD means.  
 Explaining what OD is and what people do who practice OD con-
tinues to be difficult nevertheless because the field is still being 
shaped to some degree and because the practice of OD is more of a 
process than a step-by-step procedure. That is, OD is a consideration 
in general of how work is done, what the people who carry out the 

2 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
work believe and feel about their efficiency and effectiveness, rather 
than a specific, concrete, step-by-step linear procedure for accom-
plishing something.  
 An example should help to explain. The following case represents 
a fairly strict, purist stance for determining what OD is and what it 
is not.  
 A Case: Organization Development or Crisis 
Management?  
 The client organization was a division of a large U.S. manufactur-
ing corporation. The division consisted of two plants, both of which 
manufactured heavy electrical equipment. The division was in trouble 
at the time I (Burke) was hired as an OD consultant. There were 
quality and control problems and customers were complaining. The 
complaints concerned not only poor quality, but also late delivery 
of products—inevitably weeks, if not months, later than promised. 
Several weeks prior to my arrival at the divisional offices, a senior 
vice president (VP) from the corporation’s headquarters had visited 
with the division’s top management team, a group of six men. The 
corporate VP was very much aware of the problems, and he was any-
thing but pleased about the state of affairs. At the end of his visit, 
he made a pronouncement, stating in essence that, unless this divi-
sion was “turned around” within six months, he would close it down. 
This ultimatum would mean loss of jobs for more than 1,000 people, 
including, of course, the division’s top management team. Although 
the two plants in this division were unionized, the corporate VP had 
the power and the support from his superiors to close the division if 
he deemed  it necessary.  
 For several months before this crisis, the division general man-
ager had taken a variety of steps to try to correct the problems. He 
had held problem-solving meetings with his top management team; 
he had fired the head of manufacturing and brought in a more expe-
rienced man; he spent time on the shop floor talking with first-line 
supervisors and workers; he authorized experiments to be conducted 

 
CHAPTER  1 • WHAT IS ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT? 
3
by the production engineers to discover better methods; and he even 
conducted a mass rally of all employees at which he exhorted them to 
do better. After the rally, signs were placed throughout the division  
announcing the goal: to become number one among all the corpora-
tion’s divisions. None of these steps seemed to make any difference.  
 The general manager also sought help from the corporate staff 
of employee relations and training specialists. One of these special-
ists made several visits to the division and eventually decided that an 
outside consultant with expertise in organization development could 
probably help. I was contacted by this corporate staff person, and an 
exploratory visit was arranged.  
 My initial visit, only a few weeks after the corporate vice presi-
dent had made his visit and his pronouncement, consisted largely of 
(1) talking at length with the general manager, (2) observing briefly 
most of the production operations, (3) meeting informally with the 
top management team so that questions could be raised and issues 
explored, and, finally, (4) discussing the action steps I proposed. I sug-
gested we start at the top. I would interview each member of the top 
management team at some length and report back to them as a group 
what I had diagnosed from these interviews; then we would jointly 
determine the appropriate next steps. They agreed to my proposal.  
 A couple of weeks later, I began by interviewing the six mem-
bers of the top management team (see  Figure  1.1 ) for about an hour 
each. They gave many reasons for the division’s problems, some of 
the presumed causes contradicting others. What became apparent 
was that, although the division’s goals were generally understandable, 
they were not specific enough for people to be clear about priori-
ties. Moreover, there were interpersonal problems, such as conflict 
between the head of marketing and the head of employee relations. 
(The marketing manager believed that the employee relations man-
ager was never forceful enough, and the employee relations  manager 
perceived the marketing manager as a blowhard.) We decided to have 
a two-and-a-half-day meeting of the top management team at a hotel 
some 90 miles away to work on clarifying priorities and ironing out 
some of the interpersonal problems.

 The off-site meeting was considered successful because much of 
what we set out to accomplish was achieved—a clearer understand-
ing of the problems and concerns and an agenda for action. The cru-
cial problem did indeed surface. A layer or two of the organizational 
onion had been peeled away, and we were finally getting at not only 
some causes but specifics that we could address with confidence that 
we were moving in the right direction. The key problem that sur-
faced was the lack of cooperation between the two major divisional 
functions—engineering and manufacturing.  
 As the organization chart in  Figure  1.1 shows, the division was 
organized according to function. The primary advantages of a func-
tional organization are clarity about organizational responsibilities 
because of the division of labor and the opportunities for continu-
ing development of functional expertise within a single unit. The 
disadvantages also stem from the distinct divisions of responsibility. 
Because marketing does marketing and manufacturing manufactures, 
the two rarely meet. In this case, the problem was between engineer-
ing and manufacturing. The design engineers claimed that the manu-
facturing people did not follow their specifications closely enough, 
while the manufacturing people claimed that the design engineers  
did not consider that the machinery for manufacturing was old and 

 
CHAPTER  1 • WHAT IS ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT? 
5
worn. Because of the condition of the machinery, the manufacturing 
people were not able to follow the design engineers’ specifications to 
the desired tolerances. Each group blamed the other for the drop in 
overall product quality and for the delays in delivery of the product to 
the firm’s customers.  
 This kind of conflict is common in organizations that are orga-
nized functionally. The advantages of such organizations are clear, of 
course, but a premium is placed on the need for cooperation and com-
munication across functional lines. Moreover, the pressures of daily 
production schedules make it difficult for managers to pull away and 
clearly diagnose the situation when conflicts occur between functions. 
Managers spend a great deal of time fighting fires—that is, treating 
symptoms rather than causes. An outside consultant who is not caught 
up in this day-to-day routine can be more objective. Thus, my primary 
role as consultant to this  division was diagnostician.  
 The next step was to deal with this problem of intergroup conflict. 
Another off-site meeting was held about a month later with the top six 
people from engineering and their equivalent number from manufac-
turing. These men were predominantly engineers, either design engi-
neers assigned to the engineering function or production engineers 
working in the manufacturing operation. These two functions were 
supposed to interact closely. The design engineers sent blueprint-
like plans to manufacturing for production of the specified electrical 
equipment. The manufacturing people reiterated their complaint that 
the design tolerances were too stringent for their worn-out machinery 
to handle. Meeting the design  specifications would require purchas-
ing new machinery, but the cost was prohibitive. “And besides,” they 
added, “those design guys never set foot on the shop floor anyway, so 
how would they know whether we complied with their specs or not?” 
 These comments and the attitudes they reflect are illustrative and 
common. Communication is rarely what it should be between groups 
in such organizations. It is also common, perhaps natural, for func-
tional groups to distance themselves from one another to protect their 
own turf.  
 Using a standard OD intergroup problem-solving format, 
I worked with the two groups to understand and clarify their 
differences, to reorganize the two groups temporarily into three 

6 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
four-person, cross-functional groups to solve problems, and to plan 
specific action steps they could take to correct their intergroup prob-
lems. The object in such a format is to provide a procedure for bring-
ing conflict to the surface to enable those affected to understand 
it and manage a solution more productively. An initial exchange of 
perceptions allows the parties to see how each group sees itself and 
the other group. Next comes identification of  the problems that exist 
between the two groups. Finally, mixed groups of members from both 
functions work together to plan action steps that will alleviate the con-
flict and solve many of the problems. See “Conflict in Organizations” 
(Burke, 2014a) for a detailed description of this process and see  Fig-
ure   1.2 for a summary of its application in this case. 
 The outcome of this intergroup meeting clearly suggested yet 
another step. A major problem needing immediate attention was that 
the manufacturing group was not working well as a team. The design 
engineers produced evidence that they often got different answers to 
the same design production problem from different manufacturing 
people. Thus, the next consulting step was to help conduct a team-
building session for the top group of the manufacturing function. 
Approximately two months after the intergroup session, I met off-site 
for two days with the production engineers and general foremen of 
manufacturing. In this session, we set specific manufacturing targets, 
established production priorities, clarified roles and responsibilities, 
and even settled a few interpersonal conflicts.  
 By this time, I had been working with the division on and off 
for close to nine months. After my team-building session with the 
manufacturing group, I was convinced that I had begun to see some 
of the real causes of the divisional problems; until then, I had been 
dealing primarily with symptoms, not causes. I noticed, for example, 
that the first-line supervisors had no tangible way of rewarding their 
hourly workers; they could use verbal strokes—“Nice job, Alice,” or 
“Keep up the good work, Joe”—but that was about it. They could 
use negative reinforcement, however, if they so chose—for  example, 
threatening a one- or two-week layoff without pay if performance did 
not meet standards. This type of action was within the bounds of the 
union contract.  

 
CHAPTER  1 • WHAT IS ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT?

 The hourly employees were paid according to what is called a 
measured day-work system. Their pay was based on what an industrial 
engineer had specified as an average rate of productivity for a given 
job during an eight-hour day. Incentive to produce more for extra pay 
was not part of the system.  
Procedure to Resolve Conflict
Participants
Manufacturing Department              Engineering Design Department
           (six people)                                           (six people)
Step 1: Identify Perceptions
Each department’s six representatives work as a group and separately
from other departments to generate three lists: how we see ourselves,
how we see them, and how we think they see us.
Step 2: Exchange of Perceptions
Meeting as total community of twelve, each departmental group of six
presents its lists of perceptions to the other departmental group.
Step 3: Problem Identification
Employing information presented in Step 2, the two groups, again
working separately, identify the primary problems that exist
between the two departments.
Step 4: Problem Exchange
Each group presents its problem list to the other group.
Step 5: Problem Consolidation
The total group, or representatives from each department, consolidate
the two lists into one.
Step 6: Priority Setting
Together the twelve people rank the problems listed from most to
least important.
Step 7: Group Problem Solving
The total community is reorganized into three cross-departmental,
temporary problem-solving groups. Each of the three groups, consisting
of four people, two from manufacturing and two from engineering
design, takes one of the top three most important problems
and generates solutions.
Step 8: Summary Presentations
Each of the three groups presents its solutions to the other two groups.
Step 9: Follow-Up Planning
Final activity in total community of twelve is to plan
implementation steps for problem solutions.

ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 I suggested to the division general manager that a change in the 
reward system might be in order. At that suggestion, the blood seemed 
to drain from his face. He explained that the present president of 
the corporation was the person who, years before, had invented the 
measured day-work system. He did not believe in incentive systems. 
The division general manager made it clear that he was not about to 
suggest to the corporate president, the big boss, that the measured 
day-work system should perhaps be scrapped. I discussed this matter 
with my original corporate contact, the staff specialist. He  confirmed 
the origin of the reward system and stated that changing the reward 
system was not an option. I became extremely frustrated at this point. 
I thought that I had finally discovered a basic cause of divisional, if not 
corporate, production problems, but it became apparent that this root 
of the problem was not going to be dug up. The next step I nonethe-
less recommended in the overall problem-solving process—to change 
some elements of the reward system for hourly employees, if not the 
entire system—was not a step the division general manager was will-
ing to take. The corporate staff person  was also unwilling to push for 
change in this aspect of the system. My consulting work with the divi-
sion ended shortly thereafter.  
 The point of this consultation case is as follows: What I used as 
a consultant was the standard methodology of organization develop-
ment, but the project was  not, in the final analysis, organization devel-
opment. Having described the case, I will now use it as a vehicle for 
clarifying what OD is and what it is not.  
 Definitions  
 In the consultation, I used OD methodology and approached the 
situation from an OD perspective. The methodological model for OD 
is  action research; data on the nature of certain problems are system-
atically collected and then action is taken as a function of what the 
analyzed data indicate. The specific techniques used within this meth-
odological model (few of which are unique to OD) were as follows:  
  
1.  Diagnosis.  Interview both individuals and groups, observe the 
situation, then analyze and organize the data collected.  

 
CHAPTER  1 • WHAT IS ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT? 
9
  
2.  Feedback. Report back to those from whom the data were 
obtained on the organization’s collective sense of the organiza-
tional problems.  
  
3.  Discussion. Analyze what the data mean and then plan the steps 
to be taken as a consequence.  
  
4.  Action. Take those steps. 
 In OD language, taking a step is making an  intervention into the 
routine way in which the organization operates. In the consultation 
case, there were three primary interventions: team building with the 
division general manager and the five functional heads who reported 
directly to him, intergroup conflict resolution between the engineer-
ing and manufacturing groups, and team building with the top team 
of the manufacturing group.  
 The case does not qualify as an effort in OD because it meets only 
two of the three criteria for OD as they have been defined (Burke & 
Hornstein, 1972, p. xviii). For change in an organization to be OD, it 
must (1) respond to an actual and perceived need for change on the 
part of the client, (2) involve the client in the planning and imple-
mentation of the change, and (3) lead to change in the organization’s 
culture.  
 As a consultant, I was able to meet the first two criteria, but not 
the third. For cultural change to have taken place in this case, the 
reward system would have to have been modified. The bias presented 
in this book is that  organization development is a process of funda-
mental change in an organization’s culture.  By fundamental change, 
as opposed to fixing a problem or improving a procedure, we mean 
that some significant aspect of an organization’s culture will never be 
the same. In the case described, it was the reward system. In another 
case, it might be a change in the organization’s management style, 
requiring new forms of exercising authority, which in turn would lead 
to different conformity patterns because new norms would be estab-
lished, especially in decision making.  
 Now that we have jumped from a specific case to more general 
concepts, perhaps we should slow down and define some terms. Any 
organization, like any society, has its own unique culture. A given cul-
ture consists of many elements, but the primary element is the unique 
pattern of norms, standards, or rules of conduct to which members 

10 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
conform. Other significant elements of an organization’s culture are 
its authority structure and way of exercising power, values, rewards 
and way of dispensing them, and communication patterns.  
 Our definition of culture emphasizes norms and values because 
doing so gives us an operational understanding of culture: conforming 
patterns of behavior. Norms can be changed. The changed behavior is 
a different conformity. This position, albeit perhaps limited, is never-
theless consistent with Kurt Lewin’s thinking concerning change in a 
social system (Lewin, 1958; see  Chapter  3 , “Where Did Organization 
Development Come From?,” of this book).  
 Edgar Schein (1985) defines culture at a  deeper (emphasis added) 
level, as  
 basic assumptions  and  beliefs that are shared by members of 
an organization, that operate unconsciously, and that define 
in a basic “taken-for-granted” fashion an organization’s view 
of itself and its environment. These assumptions and beliefs 
are learned responses to a group’s problems of  internal in-
tegration. They come to be taken for granted because they 
solve those problems repeatedly and reliably. This deeper 
level of assumptions is to be distinguished from the “artifacts” 
and “values” that are manifestations or surface levels of the 
culture but not the essence of the culture (pp. 6–7).  
 According to Schein’s definition, I—as the consultant in the man-
ufacturing case—was dealing with surface levels. And this is true—
almost. The OD practitioner’s job is to elicit from the client implicit 
norms, those conforming patterns that are ubiquitous but are just 
below the surface, not salient. These behaviors are  manifestations of 
basic assumptions and beliefs as Schein notes, and may not be the 
essence but constitute more operational means for dealing with orga-
nizational change. These issues concerning covert data are addressed 
in  Chapter   8 , “Understanding Organizations: Covert Processes.” 
 At the outset of an organization consultation, it is practically 
impossible for an OD practitioner to deal with data other than 
fairly superficial behavior. To discover the essence of organizational 
culture, the practitioner must establish not only good rapport with 
members of the client organization, but also a sound basis for trust. 
If organization members are reluctant or even unwilling to talk openly, 

 
CHAPTER  1 • WHAT IS ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT? 
11
the OD practitioner may never discover the true culture. To find out 
why its members behave the way they do, the OD practitioner must 
therefore truly engage the client organization’s members. This is done 
by asking discerning  and helpful questions and by showing genuine 
interest in the members as people and in what they do, what they are 
responsible for, what their problems are, and what helps or hinders 
them from making the kind of contribution they want to make as well 
as what will be beneficial to the organization. Engaging people in this 
way is an  intervention into the organization, not simply observation. 
 Schein (1991) terms this form of organizational consultation and 
research  clinical research. He maintains that one cannot understand 
the culture of an organization via the traditional scientific model; that 
is, making observations and gathering data without disturbing the sit-
uation. It is practically impossible to collect data without disturbing 
the situation. The classic Hawthorne studies, as Schein appropriately 
points out, demonstrated rather clearly that changes observed were 
due more to the researcher’s presence than to any of the other modi-
fications in the workers’ environment; for example, change in lighting.  
 Schein’s point, therefore, is this: To discover the essence of cul-
ture, the practitioner must  interact with the client—ask questions, 
test hypotheses, and provide helpful suggestions. He states that “once 
the helping relationship exists, the possibilities for learning what really 
goes on in organizations are enormous if we learn to take advantage 
of them and if we learn to be good and reliable observers of what is 
going on” (p. 5).  
 In summary, the OD practitioner begins with asking about and 
observing norms and values in the client organization. Inherent in this 
process is building rapport and trust with the client organization as 
well as testing the values and norms presented and observed. Gradu-
ally, then, the OD practitioner becomes clearer about the essence 
of the culture and can sort out what needs to be maintained, if not 
strengthened, and what needs to change.  
 For an organization to develop (see definitions of  development in 
the opening paragraph of this chapter), then, change must occur, but 
this does not mean that  any change will do. Using the term  develop-
ment to mean change does not, for example, mean growth. Russell 
Ackoff’s distinction is quite useful and relevant to our understanding 
of what the  D in OD means: 

12 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Growth can take place with or without development (and vice 
versa). For example, a cemetery can grow without developing; 
so can a rubbish heap. A nation, corporation, or an individual 
can develop without growing.... [Development] is an increase 
in capacity and potential, not an increase in attainment.... It 
has less to do with how much one has than with how much 
one can do with whatever one has (Ackoff, 1981: 34–35).  
 OD, therefore, is a process of bringing to the surface those 
implicit behavioral patterns that are helping and hindering develop-
ment. Bringing these patterns of conformity to organization mem-
bers’ conscious awareness puts them in a position to reinforce the 
behaviors that help development and change those that hinder. OD 
practitioners help clients to help themselves.  
 More specifically, OD practitioners are concerned with change 
that integrates individual needs with organizational goals more fully; 
change that improves an organization’s effectiveness through better 
utilization of resources, especially human resources; and change that 
involves organization members more in the decisions that directly 
affect them and their working conditions.  
 At least by implication and occasionally directly, we shall define 
OD several times throughout this book. The following general defini-
tion provides a starting point: Organization development is a planned 
process of change in an organization’s culture through the utilization 
of behavioral science technologies, research, and theory.  
 What if an organization’s culture does not need any change? Then 
OD is neither relevant nor appropriate. Organization development is 
not all things to all organizations. It is useful only when some funda-
mental change is needed. Then how does one recognize when funda-
mental change is needed? Perhaps the clearest sign is when the same 
kinds of problems keep occurring. No sooner does one problem get 
solved than another just like it surfaces. Another sign is when a variety 
of techniques is used to increase productivity, for example, and none 
seems to work. Yet another is when morale among employees is low 
and the cause can be attributed to no single factor. These are but a 
few signs. The point is that OD ultimately is a process of getting at 
organizational root causes, not just treating symptoms.  

 
CHAPTER  1 • WHAT IS ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT? 
13
 To be clear: Much of what is called OD is the use of OD tech-
niques—off-site team building, training, facilitation of ad hoc meet-
ings; providing private and individual feedback to managers and 
executives; and so on—but not in our purist definition. According 
to our definition, organization development provides fundamental 
change in the way things are done, modifying the essence of orga-
nizational culture. Many, perhaps most, practitioners, therefore, are 
conducting sessions and processes that rely on OD technology—and 
that’s fine. But using OD techniques is not necessarily providing orga-
nization development.  
 A Total System Approach  
 The target for change is the organization—the total system, not 
necessarily individual members (Burke & Schmidt, 1971). Individual 
change is typically a consequence of system change. When a norm, a 
dimension of the organization’s culture, is changed, individual behav-
ior is modified by the new conforming pattern. Organization develop-
ment is a total system approach to change.  
 Most practitioners agree that OD is an approach to a total system 
and that an organization is a sociotechnical system (Trist, 1960). Every 
organization has a technology, whether it is producing something tan-
gible or rendering a service; a subsystem of the total organization, tech-
nology represents an integral part of the culture. Every organization is 
also composed of people who interact to accomplish tasks; the human 
dimension constitutes the social subsystem. The emphasis of this book 
is on the social subsystem, but both subsystems and their interaction 
must be considered in any effort toward organizational change. 
 The case at the beginning of this chapter illustrates the socio-
technical qualities or dimensions of an organization. The problem 
between the engineering and manufacturing groups was both techni-
cal (out-of-date machinery) and social (lack of cooperation). The case 
also illustrates another important point. A cardinal rule of OD is to 
begin any consultation with what the client considers to be the prob-
lem or deems critical, not necessarily what the consultant considers 
important. Later, the consultant can recommend or advocate specific 
changes, but the consultant begins as a facilitator.  

14 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Whether the consultant’s role should encompass advocacy as well 
as facilitation is in dispute within the field of OD. Practitioners and 
academicians are divided according to their views of OD as contin-
gent or as normative. The contingent camp argues that OD practitio-
ners should only facilitate change; according to their view, the client 
determines the direction of change, and the OD practitioner helps 
the client get there. The normative camp, significantly smaller, argues 
that, although the approach to OD should be facilitative at the begin-
ning, before long the practitioner should begin to recommend, if not 
argue for, specific directions for change.  We place ourselves in the 
normative camp, the minority. Although we are taking a position, we 
shall make every attempt to be comprehensive and as objective as 
possible in our coverage of OD.  
 In the consultative case introduced previously, I (Burke) dealt 
almost exclusively for more than nine months with what the cli-
ent considered to be the central problems and issues. As I became 
more confident about what I considered to be not just symptoms but 
causes, I began to argue for broader and more directed change. Until 
then we had been putting out fires, not stopping arson. Although the 
organization was correcting problems, it was not learning a different 
 way of solving problems—that is, learning how to change, the essence 
of OD. This essence has been elaborated on by Argyris and Schön 
(1978),  who call it  organizational learning, and by Senge (1990). 
According to Senge, for organizational learning to occur, members 
and especially managers and executives must develop systems think-
ing. To understand complex managerial problems, one has to visual-
ize the organization as a whole, how one aspect of the system affects 
another within an overall pattern. These ideas are highly compatible 
and consistent with what we mean by OD.  
 When a consultant takes a position, regardless of how well 
founded, he or she risks encountering resistance. This obviously hap-
pened in the case I described earlier. I didn’t consult much longer 
than the first nine months. As it turned out, I did help; the division 
did turn around in time to keep the corporate vice president from 
acting on his threat to close the plant unless quality and delivery time 
were improved. As a consultant, I take satisfaction in this outcome. 
From an OD perspective, however, I consider that my work was a 

 
CHAPTER  1 • WHAT IS ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT? 
15
failure. That assessment stems from two perspectives,  one concerning 
research and the other concerning values.  
 Research evidence regarding organizational change is now very 
clear. Change rarely if ever can be effected by treating symptoms, 
and organizational change will not occur if effort is directed at try-
ing to change individual members. The direction of change should 
be toward the personality of the organization, not the personality of 
the individual. My knowledge of the research evidence, my realiza-
tion in the consultation case that a modification in the organization’s 
reward system was not likely, and my acceptance that OD, by defini-
tion, means change led me to conclude that, in the final analysis, I had 
not accomplished organization development.  
 The values that underlie organization development include 
humanistic and collaborative approaches to changing organizational 
life. Although not all OD practitioners would agree, decentralizing 
power is part of OD for most organizations. In the consultation case, 
it seemed that providing first-line supervisors with more alternatives 
for rewarding their workers positively not only was more humanistic 
but would allow them more discretionary and appropriate power and 
authority for accomplishing their supervisory responsibilities. Chang-
ing the reward system was the appropriate avenue as far as I was con-
cerned, but this change was not to be and, for my part, neither was OD.  
 By way of summary, let us continue to define what OD is by con-
sidering some of the field’s primary characteristics. The following five 
characteristics serve as a listing so far; thus we have just begun:  
  
1.  Our primary theoretical father is Kurt Lewin. We begin sum-
marizing his work in  Chapter  3 , “Where Did Organization 
Development Come From?,” and continue in  Chapter  4 , “Or-
ganization Development as a Process of Change.” His “field 
theory” is derived from physics and states that human behavior 
can be understood as reactions to forces in our environment 
that influence us one way or the other. But it is not just envi-
ronmental forces. Each of us as individuals have a personal-
ity the sum total of who we are as human beings. Lewin puts 
these two elements, personality and environment, together in a 
simple formula—Bf P/E: Behavior is a function of the inter-
action between personality and how one perceives his or her 

16 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
environment. Thus, we cannot understand human behavior un-
less we take into account  both personality and context. The orga-
nization serves as context and the organizational member has a 
personality. As OD practitioners, we must attempt to under-
stand individual behavior through the eyes of that individual, 
how she or he interprets the context and how the person’s per-
sonality helps to explain her or his behavior accordingly. There 
is much more to Lewin but his formula explaining behavior is 
fundamental. As authors of this  book, we are in part Lewinians. 
  
2.  Besides field theory, there is system theory to which we sub-
scribe. Organizations are open systems with input, throughput, 
and output with a feedback loop. This means that we consider 
the roots of organizational issues and problems to be primarily 
systemic in nature, thus the problems we seek to solve do not 
reside with individuals who are idiots but with systems that are 
idiotic.   
  
3.  Our work in OD must be data-based; otherwise, we come 
across as opinionated with no real basis for our opinions. Our 
data may be either qualitative or quantitative, preferably both, 
and grounded in what we learn from clients.  
  
4.  Our clients have the solutions to their problems. They may not 
know it at the outset; therefore, our job is to help our clients 
find the solution—not hand a solution to them.  
  
5.  And perhaps most important of all, we are values-based regard-
ing OD practice, but there are many values to which we sub-
scribe, and it is therefore important for us to know what our 
priorities are. Is treating people respectfully more important 
than resolving conflict? And when does the bottom line and/or 
meeting our budget demands take precedence?  
 Conclusion  
 What we have just stated is likely to raise many more questions 
than answers. But we have only begun. Let us move on now to more 
clarity and, we hope, answers. In the next chapter, we explore a 
broader context for OD as a way of clarifying further the work of OD 
practitioners and the domain of their work for the future.

 Organization Development 
Then and Now  
 The purpose of this chapter is to consider trends in the external 
environment that have had and will have a significant impact on orga-
nization development. To specify these important trends, this chapter 
revisits in a condensed form the original  Chapter  2 from 1994 and 
then in the second half addresses what has happened since in terms of 
major events in the last 20 years, for example, 9/11, followed by cur-
rent trends and movements in our society that have implications for 
organization development (OD).  
 Some Significant Changes Between 1969 
and 1994  
 Perhaps the most significant event to affect the field of OD, at 
least from an economic if not competence perspective, was the oil 
embargo and recession of 1972–1973. Organizations cut back, espe-
cially in the “soft” areas of training and human resource development. 
Many OD consultants had to change labels. The less experienced 
and less competent were weeded out. By 1994, OD practitioners, 
especially those who survived the economically tough times around 
1973 and remained in OD, were more competent. Those newer to 
the field had taken advantage of the greater pool of knowledge about 
OD to quickly learn the concepts  and skills required to practice OD 
effectively.  
 With respect to organizational dynamics and approaches to man-
agement in general, there were at least nine significant shifts between 
1969 and 1994 (see  Table   2.1 ).

 From Growth to Decline to Consolidation  
 Perhaps the biggest change is that organizational growth, while 
not a thing of the past, was far more limited by 1994. Growth was 
limited to certain industries and entrepreneurial activities and was not 
nearly as widespread as during the 1960s. Moreover, competition in 
1994 was far keener than a quarter of a century before and occurred 
not just from around the corner, but worldwide. The pressure on 
many businesses was to become  global; they must not only be more 
efficient, but also be able to compete more effectively.  
 In addition to the global movement,  consolidation was a primary 
goal of corporate management by 1994. Executives were working 
harder to determine their corporations’ core business and then to 
shed those divisions that did not fit the defined core. It also seemed 
that core or not, many businesses were being shed simply because of 
their inadequate profitability.  
 Another form of consolidation is the merger or acquisition. This 
form of consolidation occurred in the pharmaceutical industry, which 
had traditionally involved a great many firms with a strong market 
leader. Merck & Co., the market leader at the time, accounted for less 
than 20 percent of the world market; the remainder of the market was 
divided among hundreds of other players. In such an industry, some 
joining up became the logical thing to do (Burke & Jackson, 1991; 
Burke & Biggart, 1997).  

 
CHAPTER  2 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT THEN AND NOW  
19
 The movement from managing growth toward managing consoli-
dation had implications for the organization consultant. In 1969, we 
did a lot of team building; today, even more is required. Consultants 
needed to be highly knowledgeable and skilled about such matters as:  
 
•  The psychological consequences of “downsizing”—layoffs—on 
both employees who are let go and those who remain. (See, for 
example, Brockner, 1988; and Brockner et al., 1986.)  
  
•  Downsizing with the least amount of psychological pain 
(Brockner, 1992).  
 
•  Designing and managing flatter organizational structures. The 
old maxim that an optimum span of control is 7, 8, or 9 is just 
that— old . OD consultants needed to know how to help man-
agers deal with 15, 20, or even 50 direct reports, not a mere 
7 subordinates. This meant, for example, that they must be 
knowledgeable about semiautonomous and self-managed work 
groups (Hackman, 1989).  
 
•  Defining core competencies required to execute a corpora-
tion’s core businesses. This required on the part of OD con-
sultants (1) knowledge about the business and (2) the ability to 
determine (by means of interview, observational, and analytical 
skills) whether individual organizational members possess the 
requisite competencies.  
 
•  The particular nature of the client’s business itself, the larger 
industry in which the business is a player, and the primary fac-
tors that cause ups and downs in that industry, such as seasonal 
differences, changing government regulations, and changing 
technology. A chief executive officer (CEO) at the time said 
that the number-one value of his human resource chief (a 
Ph.D. I/O psychologist) was the fact that he knows, studies, and 
cares about the business.  
 This list provides only a taste of the knowledge and skills OD 
consultants needed to work effectively in the world of leaner, flatter, 
tighter, and bottom-line focused organizations.  
 Implication for OD: Practitioners are expected to be competent 
about how to lead and manage organization change.  

20 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Time: From Moderate to Warp Speed  
 Everything seemed to be at a faster pace those days, even 
organization change. Change occurred rapidly when precipitated by 
traumatic events, such as a leveraged buyout, an acquisition, a sudden 
downturn in the market, or a scandal. Even organizational cultures 
seemed to change more rapidly. Although not everyone was con-
vinced that culture can be changed at all, we were convinced. Having 
been involved from 1985 to 1990 in the effort of British Airways (BA) 
to change from a government agency to a private corporation, it is 
clear that significant change in BA’s culture did indeed occur (Good-
stein & Burke, 1991;  Burke, 2014b) in just five years.  
 In a related effort that shaped a newly merged culture from two 
different businesses (in somewhat the same industry) and two differ-
ent nationalities (British and American), the time required was less 
than three years (see Burke & Jackson, 1991; Bauman, Jackson, & 
Lawrence, 1997).  
 Unequivocal documentation of the comparative times needed for 
culture change is not possible and is less to the point than the fact that 
applying what we have learned about culture change (see, for exam-
ple, the book by Kotter & Heskett, 1992) may expedite change. It 
is clear that executive clients expect faster change. Moreover, CEOs 
themselves today rarely have five or more years to manage such a 
change.  
 Those of us who claimed to be organization consultants needed to 
be knowledgeable about the nature of organization culture (see such 
books as Deal & Kennedy, 1982; Sashkin & Kiser, 1993; Schein, 2004; 
Frost et al., 1991) and skillful in applying such knowledge (see, for 
example, Lawler & Worley, 2006; Nadler et al., 1992).  
 Unlike the way many of us were trained, we could not wait for 
more evidence before offering advice or direction to clients. Although 
the client may have seemed to have been moving too rapidly, without 
sufficient documentation, even half-cocked, we as consultants were 
expected to respond, to help. Managers then and today are admon-
ished to be innovative, to take risks, and to act more quickly.  
 Implication for OD:  Like our clients, we must be willing to take 
risks as well.  

 
CHAPTER  2 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT THEN AND NOW  
21
 From Moderate Complexity to Even Greater Complexity  
 Complexity has been with us for quite some time—and remains. 
In the late ’80s, Kanter (1989), for example, expressed complexity in 
the form of paradoxes. Her list from back then is amazingly relevant 
for our organizational world today. Consider the following demands 
facing managers and executives that she listed back then:  
 
•  Be entrepreneurial and take risks—but don’t cost the business 
anything by failure.  
 
•  Continue to do everything you’re currently doing, even 
better—and spend more time communicating with employees, 
serving on teams, and launching new products.  
 
•  Speak up, be a leader, set the direction—but be participative, 
listen well, and cooperate.  
 
•  Succeed, succeed, succeed—and raise terrific children. 
 Corporations as well face escalating and seemingly incompatible 
demands, according to Kanter:  
  
•  Get “lean and mean” through restructuring—while being a 
great company to work for and offering employee-centered 
policies, such as job security.  
 
•  Encourage creativity and innovation to take you in new 
directions—and “stick to your knitting.”  
 
•  Communicate a sense of urgency and push for faster execution, 
faster results—but take more time to deliberately plan for the 
future.    
 We add to the list of paradoxes, several slanted more toward the 
OD consultant’s world:  
 
•  We organizational and psychological consultants are becoming 
specialists even as organizational conceptualization is moving 
more toward systemic and holistic thinking.  
 
•  Organization members experience more stress than ever due to 
change and, consequently, have a desire for some stability, yet 
chaos is more likely to be the new norm.  

22 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 
•  With tougher times facing most organizations,  how one man-
ages is as important as achieving results.  
  
•  Organizational members cry out for leadership and direction, 
yet demand more participation.  
 
•  There is more talk than ever about vision, mission, new direc-
tions, values, and promises to customers, yet one of the most 
significant issues concerning top management today is that so 
many managers and executives do  not “walk the talk,” as the 
expression goes.  
 
•  Competition in business is keener than ever, yet there is a clear 
movement afoot, especially in mature industries, to join with 
the enemy via strategic alliances and joint ventures—witness 
IBM and Apple, at the time.  
 
•  OD consultants seem to be moving more toward “traditional 
management consulting” (that is, concern with business mat-
ters) and traditional consultants seem to be moving more 
toward the “soft” domains (that is, concern with process issues).  
 These baffling contradictions can not only be confusing, but at 
times perhaps immobilizing, yet it is important in our complex world 
of OD to embrace paradox and seeming inconsistencies. Turning to 
the natural sciences can be helpful to our understanding. The theoriz-
ing of Ilya Prigogine (Nicolis & Prigogine, 1977) and the subsequent 
writings of Erich Jantsch (1980) are relevant to our understanding 
of change. They state that to understand evolution, you must focus 
more on disequilibrium than on equilibrium, the implication being 
that change is not linear. Jantsch also contended that evolution is 
accelerating, just as the overall process of  change appears to be. This 
theory has been heralded by some as a paradigmatic shift comparable 
to Einstein’s move away from Newton.  
 Just as Einstein’s theory of relativity wrested the physical sci-
ences away from Newton’s static ideas of gravity, Jantsch’s ideas chal-
lenge us to view movement, relativity, and change in living systems as 
 constant. He argued that all living things are always coevolving, yet 
maintaining a “relativity” to one another. Both Jantsch and Prigogine 
believed that the disequilibrium and perturbation that arise from time 
to time in living things are actually a kind of “molting,” a shedding 
of the old within organisms as they strive to attain a higher level of 

 
CHAPTER  2 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT THEN AND NOW  
23
existence. These perturbations, activities of disequilibrium, are signs 
of positive change that  lead to self-organization rather than to decline. 
(See  Chapter  5 , “Defining the Client: A Different Perspective,” for 
more elaboration on the work of Prigogine and Jantsch as well as that 
of Fritjof Capra.)  
 From an organization change perspective, this theory reminds us 
of Greiner’s (1972) ideas about the life cycle of organizations as well 
as the work of Adizes (1979). At times, organization change should 
occur like a perturbation or a leap in the life cycle of the organization, 
not as an incremental process. The management of the change should 
be incremental, but not always the initiation of the change itself.  
 Implication for OD: Accepting the complexity of paradox and 
being grounded in theory beyond organizational theory may be help-
ful to our understanding of organization development and change.  
 From Strategic Planning to Strategic Implementation  
 Strategic planning was not passé at the time, but executives had 
to learn that planning is about 10 percent of the effort to change an 
organization, whereas implementing the plan, the tougher part of the 
job by far, requires the remaining 90 percent of the effort. Here, the 
work of Lawler and Worley (2006) in their book,  Built to Change, is 
useful. They emphasize that strategic planning as we have known it, 
a planned event that often is conducted once a year, is inappropriate 
for today’s fast-paced world of business. Rather, strategic planning 
should be a daily process—not an event—and the more appropri-
ate term, therefore, needs to be  strategizing, which puts the focus 
on constant change (and “changing”), not a singular once-in-a-while 
activity. Thus, managing change is, as a routine, the emphasis today 
(see  Chapter  7 , “The Burke-Litwin Model of Organizational Perfor-
mance and Change”).  
 Implication for OD: The more an OD effort is aligned with the 
organization’s strategy, the better.  
 From Consultant Jargon to Popular, Accepted Concepts  
 The language of organizations has changed. Years ago, clients 
would ask what was meant by  culture; today, they use the term before 

24 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
we do.  Value is another term that clients use before we do as well as 
 vision, mission, climate, and  leadership. We welcome this language 
change, yet are uneasy about it because even after many years of OD, 
we are not certain that we truly understand these terms or concepts. 
Do clients really understand these terms they so loosely bandy about?  
 Clients today use OD jargon quite easily, yet are very uneven in 
their level of understanding and commitment to the action the words 
betoken. Thus although they all may use the words, not all act on 
them. Even though most use the terms, some remain skeptical about, 
if not resistant to, change.  
 Implication for OD: Clients may not always know in depth the 
words about change that they use, but assume that they are more 
sophisticated than a decade or so ago.  
 From Management to Leadership  
 In 1969, leadership was not mentioned very often. It was not con-
sidered unimportant, but the term simply was seldom used. Today, 
leadership and its distinctions from management are discussed and 
debated frequently (see, for example, Bennis & Nanus, 1985; Burke, 
1986; Zaleznik, 1977). The leadership function is not only highlighted 
more today, but it is also emphasized by many in the context of 
bringing about organizational change.  
 Implication for OD:  Initiating change needs leadership; imple-
menting change needs management.  
 From Unilateral, Top-Down Management to Multilateral, 
Participative Management  
 Organizational members today are less tolerant of the arbitrary 
use of power than was true in the past. And while conflict resolution 
and effectiveness in lateral relations were acknowledged as impor-
tant in 1969, they are viewed by most executives as critical for effec-
tive organizational functioning today. This shift is due in part to (1) 
more decentralized authority and flatter hierarchies, where getting 
work done depends more on influence skills than on the exercise of 
power as a function of status or position; (2) the emphasis being given 

 
CHAPTER  2 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT THEN AND NOW  
25
to collaborative, joint approaches to labor-management relations as 
opposed to adversarial ones; and  (3) the occurrence of mergers and 
acquisitions, where achieving integration or at least some degree of 
smooth working relationships is important. This trend is covered in 
more depth in  Chapter  10 , “Understanding and Changing Loosely 
Coupled Systems.”  
 Implication for OD: Remember the OD mantra: “involvement 
leads to commitment.”  
 From Little Concern for Ethics to a High Concern for 
Ethics  
 In part, at least, increased competition has no doubt caused some 
managers to cut corners. Scandals either occur more frequently today 
or they are more likely to be exposed than was true in the past. Many 
managers are therefore caught in the vise (if not paradox) between 
meeting targets more rapidly than ever before and with less cost 
and emphasizing high quality. The two do not have to be mutually 
exclusive. In fact, managers are perhaps more wary about short-term 
measures, knowing that in the long run a large price will be paid one 
way or the other. Yet, they  feel the pressure.  
 OD consultants are on occasion put in the position of serving as 
conscience for the client. This is an uncomfortable role, to be sure, 
but can be quite helpful. Sometimes managers simply need to be 
reminded of the ethics of a situation. When reminded, they often feel 
relieved that someone will support their doing the right thing. We 
cover this topic again later in the chapter.  
 Implication for OD: Although we may differ about a definition of 
OD, in the end it is about being values-based.  
 From a Micro Perspective to a Macro Perspective  
 The shift from micro to macro perspective since 1969 is perhaps 
more specific to the practice of OD than to management or organi-
zational dynamics in general. In the 1960s, OD practitioners viewed 
organizational issues mostly in terms of individuals and small groups 
(sensitivity training, T-groups, management development), whereas 

26 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
today OD practitioners take a larger, more systematic perspective 
(reward systems, strategic planning, structure, management informa-
tion systems). This shift is far more realistic for purposes of organiza-
tional change.  
 Implication for OD:  A recent study comparing values of OD 
practitioners reported in 1994 compared with 2014 (Shull, Church, 
& Burke, 2014) showed that OD practitioners have shifted yet again 
but now back to micro activities; for example, leader development, 
coaching, and training. This is a concern because OD is usually 
defined as systemic change; that is, more macro than micro.  
 The nine shifts described here are not the only ones since 1969, 
but they are the most significant for OD. OD practitioners are in the 
business of change and they involve people in decisions and activities 
that directly affect them. These nine shifts concern in various ways 
organization change and differences in the way people are managed.  
 The New Corporation  
 To broaden our context regarding changes since 1969, let us 
consider briefly the work of John Naisbett. Naisbett’s best seller 
 Megatrends (1982) caused readers to think about the changing nature 
of organizations. His later book, coauthored with Patricia Aburdene 
(Naisbett & Aburdene, 1985), was more to the point of organizational 
shifts, however. The following list is their observations of how the 
corporation was being reinvented at that time:  
  
1.  The best and brightest people will gravitate toward those 
corporations that foster personal growth.  
  
2.  The manager’s role is that of coach, teacher, and mentor. 
  
3.  The best people want ownership—psychic and literal—in a 
company; the best companies are providing it.  
  
4.  Companies will increasingly turn to third-party contractors, 
shifting from hired labor to contract labor.  
  
5.  Authoritarian management is yielding to networking, people-
style management.  
  
6.  Entrepreneurship within the corporation—“intra-preneur-
ship”—is creating new revitalizing companies inside out.  

 
CHAPTER  2 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT THEN AND NOW  
27
  
7.  Quality will be paramount. 
  
8.  Intuition and creativity are challenging the “It’s all in the num-
bers” business-school philosophy.  
  
9.  Large corporations are emulating the positive and productive 
qualities of small business.  
  10.  The dawn of the information economy has fostered a massive 
shift from infrastructure to quality of life (pp. 45–46).  
 It seems clear that Naisbett and Aburdene’s observations regard-
ing the future of the corporation had a prescient quality with the 
possible exception of their last two—large corporations emulating a 
small business and a shift to quality of life—their “reinventions” of 
the corporation are fairly accurate. And even though characterized 
by considerable foresight, the work of Naisbett and Aburdene was in 
the early to mid-1980s. Much has happened since then and since the 
publication of the second edition of this book in 1994. Thus, the 
remainder of this chapter is devoted to events, trends, and move-
ments since 1994 that have affected  our world, in general, and OD 
in particular.  
 Significant Changes Since 1994  
 What follows is our current list of nine trends or movements since 
1994 that no doubt have emerged over the past two decades or so as 
consequences one way or the other from big events. At the top of the 
events list would be 9/11, followed by long-standing wars in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, the 2008 financial crisis, the emergence of the Tea Party, 
the election of the first African American as president of the United 
States, and climate change. This is not a complete list by any means, 
but more of an illustration of how much has changed and how signifi-
cant and impactful these events have been. But with respect to these 
big events since 1994, and our list of trends since then to follow, it is 
not clear what is cause and what is effect. To link a trend, say, more 
caution regarding major business decisions, to the 2008 financial 
crisis might be an attractive hypothesis, but such a suggestion would 
be purely speculative and probably unwarranted. Our main objective, 
then, is to identify trends irrespective of the causes behind them but 

28 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
rather to provide context and to draw an implication or two for OD 
now and in the  future.  
 Before plunging into our inventory of trends and movements over 
the past 20 or so years, let us consider briefly one other declaration 
for the purpose of providing additional context—the constancy of 
change. Change has always been with us, a constant of life, so what 
is new? The growing recognition and  acceptance, finally, of this con-
stancy. Instead of two inevitabilities—death and taxes—we now have 
added a third—change.  
 With these matters of context as background, let us now move 
to the foreground of changes since 1994 or what might be labeled as 
shifts, trends, or movements in our society that have implications for 
OD. In other words, these nine trends are not  the nine; rather, they 
emerged for us as the ones that may be the most impactful regarding 
OD. Thus, for each case, we end with “ Implication for OD ” as we 
did in the section on trends between 1969 and 1994. In no particular 
order, the following sections explore the nine trends that we think are 
important for  the field.  
 Agile, Nimble, and Quick  
 With competition being as tough as ever, technology that is ever-
changing, and consumer preferences seeming to bend with the wind, 
organizations whether in the corporate world, government agencies, 
nongovernment organizations (NGO), or nonprofits, in general, are 
expected to be responsive and quick to do so. A spate of books cover-
ing this ability to be nimble and agile has brought to the table advice, 
admonitions, and ideas about the subject. Brief summaries of those 
books are provided in  Chapter  14 , “Organization Development and 
the Future,” which will be part of our coverage about the future.  
 Understanding agility over the past five years more deeply 
has led to several faculty and doctoral students in the social-
organizational psychology program at Teachers College, Columbia 
University, attempting to measure behaviorally the concept of learn-
ing agility for more than five years. So by adding this work, we are not 
just making observations and commentary, but have joined the trend 
ourselves. Learning agility, an intriguing concept, is not easy to define, 
much less measure. There are two primary components—the key idea 

 
CHAPTER  2 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT THEN AND NOW  
29
or  concept and one’s  motivation . The concept of agility means being 
agile particularly when confronted with a new and different situation. 
The  learning aspect concerns whether what one has learned from 
experience, how one thinks and behaves, is applicable to the new and 
different situation and if not, what does one then do? Motivation con-
cerns one’s willingness to take risks in attempting to deal with a novel 
situation when not knowing exactly what to do. In addition to risk-
taking is seeking feedback about how one is doing regardless of how 
threatening this action might be to one’s self esteem. Other relevant 
terms include flexibility, speed, and avoiding being defensive—that is, 
justifying one’s actions regardless of the uniqueness of the situation. 
Learning agility,  therefore, is the combination of  motivation, willing-
ness to engage and stay engaged with a novel situation, and the  skill to 
discern quickly the consequences of one’s actions and then determine 
what to do next in order to continue the process of learning.  
 This brief coverage of learning agility is expanded in  Chapter  14 
regarding the future. Thus, because of its importance, agility, being 
quick and nimble, is covered twice, here in terms of a clear trend that 
has implications for OD and again in our final chapter, where agility 
is one of four important considerations for the future.  
 Implication for OD: This trend is highly compatible with the 
objectives and values of OD. After all, OD people are usually advo-
cates of change; thus, helping people in the workplace to be more 
agile is fundamental to the practice. This means finding ways and 
means behaviorally for organizational members to learn to feel more 
comfortable with embracing ambiguity and to experiment and take 
risks with new and different ideas. And assuming that increased agility 
leads to greater organizational adaptability and less rigidity, which in 
turn can lead to more innovation, perhaps we in the field should go so 
far as to  be advocates for enhancing these kinds of behaviors.  
 The Haves Versus the Have Nots  
 This trend of more and more of a chasm between the highly 
wealthy and the rest of us strikes at the heart of individual beliefs 
and values. When 1 percent control most of the wealth in the world 
and when “CEOs enjoy incomes that are on average 295 times that of 
the typical worker, a much higher ratio than in the past, without any 

30 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
evidence of a proportionate increase in productivity” (Stiglitz, 2014, 
p. SR 7), people pay attention. Supposedly we in the United States 
live in a democracy, not an oligarchy. Moreover, the financial crisis of 
2008 raised issues  about how money is made and accumulated. It is 
not that the value system of OD practitioners resides in the domain of 
socialism, but it does advocate fairness and social justice. Incidentally, 
this issue of inequity is not merely one for profit-making corporations. 
Discrepancy and inequity exist as well in universities, health-care sys-
tems, religious institutions, and in the U.S. Congress. The economist 
and Nobel laureate, Joseph Stiglitz, quoted above, argues that the 
problem of inequality is more about politics than economics. It is a 
matter of ensuring that the haves pay their fair share of taxes. He goes 
on to  state that “We are not embracing a politics of envy if we reverse 
a politics of greed....[it’s] the right to justice for all.” (Stiglitz, 2014, p. 
SR 7).  
 Implication for OD:  Later in the book,  Chapter   12   , “The Organi-
zation Development Consultant,” addresses more specifically values 
that underlie the field of OD. For now, it is important to understand 
that high on the list of values are fairness and equity in the workplace. 
In the early stages of OD work, facilitation is more the norm than 
advocacy. Except for declaring our “point of view” about how we nor-
mally work (follow a particular framework or model of organization 
change, for example), we typically facilitate what the client wants. At 
some later stage, however, we may choose to take a position about 
what the organization should do. In the case described in  Chapter  1 , 
“What Is Organization Development?,” after several months of work, 
the consultant argued for changing the organization’s reward system. 
The client resisted such a change and the consulting work with that 
organization soon ended. It may be, nevertheless, that in this grow-
ing world of inequity, confronting such issues could be considered 
appropriate, at least from the standpoint of acting consistently with 
OD values. But the tactic in this case would not necessarily be one 
of declaring that the CEO’s compensation is way out of line, making 
it nothing more than a moral issue, but instead stating that the com-
pensation discrepancy does no doubt lead to a feeling of unfairness 
on the part of employees, which may affect morale and a decrease in 
motivation and in turn eventually have an impact on organizational 

 
CHAPTER  2 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT THEN AND NOW  
31
performance; that is, the bottom line. This kind of consultant action 
combines an inequity problem with a very practical business issue.  
 Cautious Decision Making  
 Organizations of all types are more cautious about making deci-
sions requiring large expenditures. This is particularly true of corpo-
rations. Major companies are “sitting on” tons of cash. Perhaps the 
financial crisis of 2008 is the culprit here, but time has passed with 
no further crises—at least none in the world of finance. Mergers and 
acquisitions are back in vogue, thus some of the dormant money is 
being spent on buying other companies. This return to mergers and 
acquisitions is in spite of the dismal record regarding these kinds of 
deals; that is, the consequences are more likely to result in  “wealthy 
destruction” than wealth enhancement—see, for example, Moeller, 
Schlingemann, and Stulz (2005) in the academic literature and a more 
recent summary article in  The New York Times by Sommer (2014). 
 Implication for OD: Practitioners in OD can help to promote the 
fact that knowledge exists about what works and what doesn’t when 
attempting to integrate two organizations for the first time; that is, a 
merger but much more often an acquisition. Serving on a National 
Research Council task force for the Academy of Science, Burke and 
Biggart (1997) conducted a study of interorganizational relations, 
including mergers and acquisitions. They found that upwards of 75 
percent of mergers and acquisitions fail; that is, fall short of accom-
plishing the goals set forth in justifying the decision to come together. 
Their study included a summary of what contributes to success 
regarding a merger or acquisition, for example, having a clear vision 
about the “new” organization and what can be expected, and what 
contributes to failure, for example, an imbalance of power between 
the two parties. In other words, when an organization does decide to 
spend its cash reserves on an acquisition, OD professionals can help 
to make it a success.  
 Another opportunity for an OD practitioner to capitalize on this 
trend would be to advocate the organization’s investing in its people. 
There might be an opportunity to “sell” a program or initiative that 
would help the organization to have more competent employees. 

32 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
Some examples include improving procedures and criteria for select-
ing high potentials for leadership, establishing a long-term program 
for leader development, revising the performance management and 
reward system to focus not only on results but on  how those results 
are achieved as well, and perhaps a program on group and cross-
cultural dynamics. Experienced OD practitioners are likely to be 
primed  to deliver on these kinds of people development possibilities.  
 Emphasis on Innovation  
 As long as the United States has been a sovereign nation, there 
has been an emphasis on innovation. When he was president and 
commander in chief of the U.S. Army, Abraham Lincoln was con-
stantly interested in new weapons for the war. We remain a nation of 
innovators. Yet with global competition continuing to increase and the 
math and science scores of our schoolchildren not being sufficiently a 
match for children in other countries, the pressure on being innova-
tive is on the rise. Interestingly, we could have a problem with cau-
tion regarding major decisions compared with this innovation trend 
because the latter requires at least some degree of risk-taking. Even 
though risk-taking is involved, it takes different forms depending on 
the type of innovation that is being pursued. There are at least three 
forms or levels of innovation for organizations: (1) things, (2) the ways 
work is done in the organization, and (3) competition for the organiza-
tion within its industry. Innovation with things means developing new 
or improved products and services. IDEO is a successful consulting 
firm that provides innovation for client organizations by designing a 
new or modified product or service for their clients. A second form 
of innovation is to change ways and means of working in order to 
compete more effectively in the organization’s markets. Improving 
quality by way of a Six Sigma program would be an example. A third 
form is to change the way an organization competes in its respective 
industry. An example of this third form is represented by the work 
of Clayton Christensen (1997) and Christensen and Raynor (2003). 
Christensen’s assessment of competition within industry groups rests 
on the notion that successful companies doing everything right—
serving customers well, constantly improving the ways they conduct 
their business, and so on—are susceptible to competitors who are  

 
CHAPTER  2 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT THEN AND NOW  
33
minor players entering their market(s) with cheaper products that are 
lower in quality; yet over time, these smaller competitors begin to 
encroach into the larger company’s territory. The larger, more suc-
cessful company continues to do business the way they have been for 
years. Why should they change? Their ways work. But this “disrup-
tive innovation,” as Christensen calls it, gradually gains a competitive 
edge and then wreaks havoc for the larger, more successful company. 
Examples of companies that got caught in this disruption include 
Sears, Digital Equipment Corporation, Xerox, and AT&T.  
 In passing, it should be noted that even though Christensen’s 
books have been best sellers and that he has disciples everywhere, his 
theory of change has been criticized as founded on panic, anxiety, and 
shaky evidence. A primary critic, historian Jill Lepore, puts it this way: 
 Disruptive innovation is a theory about why businesses fail. 
It’s not more than that. It doesn’t explain change. It’s not 
a law of nature. It’s an artifact of history, an idea, forged in 
time; it’s the manufacture of a moment of upsetting and edgy 
uncertainty. Transfixed by change, it’s blind to continuity. It 
makes a very poor profit (Lepore, 2014, p. 36).  
 Businesses do fail for lack of innovation, but these failures may 
not occur quite the way that Christensen depicts them. The point is 
that with more emphasis on innovation, we must get it right.  
 Implication for OD: Innovation involves change. OD is about 
change. This trend is, therefore, good for OD—of the three forms or 
levels of innovation described above, the latter two are more within 
the practice of OD. Improving products and services involves design 
skills that most OD practitioners do not have. OD practitioners can 
be useful in helping to change ways of doing things, processes, and 
procedures because these factors are endemic to the organization’s 
culture. OD practitioners must be culture experts. Off-site team-
building sessions can be appropriate activities for changing processes, 
so can resolving intergroup conflict, and work-out sessions.  
 With respect to the third area of innovation, the organization’s 
relation to its industry, OD practitioners can be helpful here as well. 
Any OD effort should begin with an assessment of the organization’s 
external environment. What forces “out there” are having an impact 
on the organization—industry competitors, government regulations, 

34 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
changes in technology, and so forth? Helping executives to craft 
scenarios about which forces to tackle and how to deal with them 
is a worthy endeavor and should be done early in an OD process—
see  Chapter  2 in Lawler and Worley (2006) for ideas and suggestions 
for conducting environmental scenarios followed by “strategizing” in 
 Chapter  3 . 
 More often than not, OD practice involves innovation, or at least 
it should. The work is about change, whether an effort is transforma-
tional or one that focuses on improving what exists.  
 Greater Dispersion of Power and Politics  
 At a global level with the possible exceptions of North Korea, 
certain nation states in Africa, and arguably Russia, power is not as 
concentrated in one person or office as in the past. And the political 
world is in many respects deadlocked with little agreement among 
parties and thus unable to get important issues on the agenda, much 
less move legislation forward. These statements are not meant to be 
hyperbolic; moreover, there is evidence to support them. The primary 
evidence comes from a book,  The End of Power , by Moisés Naim 
(2013). The subtitle of the book conveys the range  of coverage—
 From Boardroom to Battlefields and Churches to States ,  Why Being 
in Charge Isn’t What It Used To Be . Naim attributes these shifts in 
power, or revolutions, to the “3Ms”— more ,  mobility , and  mentality . 
Here are brief definitions and the main point for each:  
 
•   More.  Profusion is the operative concept. There is more of 
everything, everywhere—more people, cities, countries, armies 
(large and small), political parties, goods and services with more 
businesses selling them, more weapons, computers, criminals, 
and iPhones. Naim also notes that the more people have, the 
more they want. People are living longer, and with many excep-
tions, are enjoying healthier lives. What’s the point? “ When 
people are more numerous and living fuller lives, they become 
more difficult to regiment and control ” (Naim, 2013, p. 58—
italics in the original).  
 
•   Mobility.  People are on the move. Migration continues at a 
rapid pace with people searching for a better life. As noted 

 
CHAPTER  2 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT THEN AND NOW  
35
above, there are more cities with urbanization accelerating, 
particularly in Asia. Borders between countries (take Europe, 
for example) are becoming more porous. Social media facilitate 
this increase in mobility. Practically everyone has access to the 
Internet. What’s the point?  With such mobility and access to 
information, people are harder to control . 
 
•   Mentality.  This shift or revolution is all about expectations 
that people around the globe now have. This is especially true 
for the middle class, which is expanding in the less-developed 
countries, but shrinking in the more wealthy countries (see the 
previous section on the haves and have nots). Where expansion 
is occurring, there is a consequent quest for more education. 
And with greater education, expectations, or developing a men-
tal set of having a  right for more, increase. Rising expectations 
create demands. What’s the point?  For people holding positions 
of power, it is becoming more and more difficult for them to 
meet expectations  that their constituents have and will have in 
the future . 
 All one has to do is travel the world to see that Naim is largely cor-
rect in what he proclaims. In addition, the Endnotes of his book that 
provide support for his points comprise 20 pages. Power may not be 
ending, but it is changing, becoming more dispersed with less of the 
qualities of command and control and authoritarianism.  
 Implication for OD: Involvement of individuals in the making 
of decisions that directly affect them and a bias toward participative 
management have been long-standing values and arguments of pro-
fessionals in the field of OD. Sharing power and shared leadership are 
further manifestations of these values and biases. Thus, the disper-
sion of power is largely welcomed by OD professionals. But there are 
at least two resultant issues. One concerns loosely coupled systems 
where power is dispersed and, therefore, understanding how to work 
with these kinds of organizations where hierarchy barely exists if at all, 
as in say, a network, is highly important. In our OD practice, it is clear 
that we know more about how to loosen a tightly coupled system than 
to tighten a loose one.  Chapter   10 is devoted to this issue. 
 A second issue concerns the nature of authority. Getting things 
done with people requires dealing with the reality of the exercise of 

36 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
power, which in turn involves leadership, management, and authority 
in one form or another. Knowing how to deal with issues of authority 
is critical to the success of any OD effort. The fundamental question 
is: Who among us is authorized to do our bidding? When  authorizing 
someone, what does that process entail and what does it look like? 
Authorizing means that someone or a number of people are “given 
the right” (the operative term) by the larger group or  system to make 
decisions on behalf of that larger system. Authorizing or giving the 
right may be temporary or more permanent, but the expectation is 
that having been given this right should not be taken for granted. 
These are the kinds of issues and questions that must be addressed by 
OD practitioners as the revolution of power in the world shifts.  
 More Emphasis on Talent Management  
 We can remember the day when TM stood for “transcendental 
meditation”; today, it is  talent management . Organizations around the 
world are competing for talent. Our information age demands that 
employees have more than one skill, are interpersonally competent, 
and know something. If they do not know something, they at least 
know how to find what they need to know, and this does not mean 
always relying on Google or Wikipedia. It may mean attending a work-
shop or conference, taking a course, or pursing a graduate degree.  
 The management of talent follows a cycle: 
 
•   Selection .   Understanding the criteria for finding the talent 
desired and needed and then actively recruiting them  
 
•   Development .  Providing a variety of job/role experiences along 
with feedback and coaching regarding how they are doing so 
that learning can occur  
 
•   Measurement .  Performance on the job as well as multi-rater 
feedback and assessment  
 
•   Deployment .   Further assignments to ensure further growth 
and development especially cross-cultural experiences to learn 
from regarding issues of diversity and/or global opportunities  
 
•   Incentives .  Providing incentives within a larger reward system 
that is competitive in the labor market  

 
CHAPTER  2 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT THEN AND NOW  
37
 Implication for OD: Talent management is a natural for OD 
practitioners. Combining TM with OD, one in support of the other, 
means that OD is linked to the life force of the organization, its mis-
sion and strategy, and how to implement these organizational activi-
ties in the best possible way for the initiation and sustainment of 
change for the future. For example, it was critical to the success of 
the change at British Airways (BA) (see  Chapter  7 ) to hire, place, and 
develop people who would be highly customer-focused and service-
oriented. Because the airline industry, particularly for the front-line 
people—ticket counter agents,  gate attendants, and cabin crew—is 
largely about emotional labor (dealing with customers at times under 
stressful circumstances), it is essential to get the right people in the 
right jobs.  
 The BA example is about talent in general and for large segments 
of the organization’s members, but what if we are linking talent man-
agement to high potentials in the organization? This is often the case 
in large corporations. This differentiation raises the issue of high 
potentials versus those who are not yet valuable to the organization. 
A value of OD is that all organizational members should be treated 
equally in many important ways—involvement, engagement, pro-
vided with opportunities for growth and development, to name a few. 
TM based on high potentials is by definition discriminatory, so do 
we have a situation of OD versus TM? Church (2013) has addressed 
this question. His research indicated that high potentials in terms of 
engagement and related processes were not that different from others 
in management positions at least in the consumer products company 
that he studied. So, it may be that TM and OD can coexist peacefully. 
Parenthetically, Church (2014) in a more recent article provides such 
a possibility in his coverage of “the role of OD in strategic talent man-
agement.” Following Church’s (2013) lead, it would be enlightening 
to conduct similar studies in other organizations that are identifying 
high potentials and treating them  differently.  
 The Ever-Changing World of Technology  
 There are at least four major developments in technology that have 
meaning for OD practitioners:  social media, including the underlying 

38 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
foundation of the Internet and e-mail, of course,  data analysis, simu-
lations, and  information retrieval. 
 The  social media has been transformative. Part of the attraction 
of Twitter, Facebook, and so on is both the speed of contacts—we 
can reach one another in a matter of seconds—and the breadth of 
contacts with the possibility, for example, of forming networks for 
multiple purposes, like sharing common interests such as backpack-
ing, scientific domains, the ever-popular spelunking, and so on, and 
the sharing of information among professional groups, not to mention 
the sharing of jokes, cartoons, and a favorite photograph or video. 
Smartphones, especially, have had an impact on organizational life; 
for example, colleagues will text each other in real  time in meetings. 
It has given new meaning to what we think of as “undiscussables” or 
issues that are under the table (Marshak, 2006).  
 Data Analysis : Three terms that are highly relevant for OD cap-
ture this technology trend—Big Data, People Analytics, and algo-
rithm. The term  algorithm is not new, of course. It is in the dictionary 
and is defined as a set of rules for solving a problem in a finite number 
of steps, then finding the most significant common divisor, a “com-
mon denominator.” It involves programming a computer to solve a 
specific problem. In this case, an algorithm is applied to Big Data and 
People Analytics, for purposes of solving complex problems. Big Data 
means what you would assume it to mean—BIG—huge volumes of  
data that are gathered into one or more sets to understand a prob-
lem more clearly than we could have done before; that is, “informa-
tion that can’t be processed or analyzed using traditional processes 
or tools” (Zikopoulos, Eaton, deRoos, Deutsch, & Lapis, 2012, p. 3). 
Enter algorithms. Now consider a situation for a company that may be 
puzzling. The overall economy, let’s say, is on the rise, other compa-
nies in the same industry appear to be doing well, and consumer con-
fidence is increasing, yet the company of interest has products where 
sales are flat with some even sinking, and competitive companies  with 
similar products are doing well. Why? Using a Big Data approach, one 
would amass information about such factors as economic status, age 
range, educational level, degree of mobility, and so forth of the com-
pany’s consumers; which products of the competitors are selling well 
and where geographically; inflation rate within the overall economy; 
new technology in the industry; and so on. One would then enter all of 

 
CHAPTER  2 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT THEN AND NOW  
39
these data into an algorithmic computer program and search for com-
monalities, if any, across many sources. If common divisors emerge, 
they may provide clues as to what action to take.  
 People Analytics is about applying Big Data to issues, problems, 
and operations in general that concern human resources, typically 
in large organizations. One of the first People Analytics examples, 
and perhaps best known, is Billy Beane, the general manager of the 
Oakland Athletics major-league baseball team. Beane applied infor-
mation from large data sets to make decisions about which players to 
hire and which to reject. His success story is told in a book,  Money-
ball, by Michael Lewis (2004). In addition to hiring decisions, People 
Analytics can be applied to problems of turnover, poor performance, 
and determining important criteria for finding and  hiring highly 
talented, and perhaps specialized, people. For more depth about how 
Big Data and People Analytics relate to and can become a part of OD, 
see the article by Church and Dutta (2013).  
 Simulations  have been around for quite some time. Business cases 
where participants make decisions that are judged against financial 
performance criteria are common today especially in business schools. 
But now we have simulations that are more sophisticated, more of an 
interactive process between the participants and the computer pro-
gram and among the participants, and criteria for performance that 
are based, for example, on what we know about managing change 
that leads to a successful outcome grounded in what works and what 
doesn’t. Points for participant teams are allocated accordingly.  
 With the advent of Google Scholar and other sources from the 
Internet, we rarely have a need to visit the library—we can have 
instant  information retrieval . If it is an article, we can find it, and 
download it if we desire, in a matter of minutes. If it’s a book, we can 
order it from Amazon and have a tangible copy in our hands within 
a day or two, or more immediately, as an e-book. We operate today 
in an age where information quickly retrieved cannot only be valu-
able, but powerful as well, for example beating the competition to the  
punch, or accessing the digital footprint of someone you are trying to 
recruit for a key position.  
 Implication for OD: To what extent does networking on Face-
book, for example, spill over into the workplace, the organization, and 
if so, does it matter? Obtaining information from Twitter might be 

40 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
useful for the organization such as in the arena of marketing. What 
seems to be some primary interests of people in certain age groups 
and areas of the country? The point for OD practitioners is to be cog-
nizant of and sensitive to any relationship between networks in the 
social media and informal networks in the organization and to note 
any overlap. If overlap exists, does it matter? With the example  of 
texting in real time, OD practitioners must explore not just patterns 
of communication, but modes of communication as well. It is a matter 
of determining what influence social media have on people in their 
working lives.  
 With respect to  data analysis, OD practitioners must be data 
analysts both in terms of data that are quantitative and data that are 
qualitative. Unless the organization is largely based on science and/or 
engineering, not that many organizational members are likely to be 
adept at analyzing data, especially survey data and data based on rat-
ings like those in the category of multi-rater feedback. Although one 
does not have to be the greatest of statisticians, it is important to know 
a few things to help clients make sense of and to draw meaning from a 
large, complicated set of data, such as  which numerical outcomes are 
significant and which are not, what aspects of the respondents’ demo-
graphics (gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, age, 
number of years working in the organization, level of position in the 
organization, etc.) relate to what outcomes (motivation, performance, 
job satisfaction, etc.) if any relationship at all.  
 As noted, the world of simulation for learning purposes has 
become more sophisticated, and thus it behooves the OD practitioner 
to learn about these forms of learning and development for organiza-
tional members. And, finally, with respect to information retrieval, 
access to information required to conduct OD more effectively is now 
at our fingertips.  
 Diversity  
 We (the authors) live and work in New York City, one of the most 
diverse cities in the world. Diversity is manifested and enjoyed in a 
great variety of food and drink, arts and entertainment, languages, 
and cross-cultural experiences. Living in a diverse environment, how-
ever, does not make leveraging the strengths of diversity or managing 

 
CHAPTER  2 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT THEN AND NOW  
41
the complexity of diversity any easier. With so much diversity, clas-
sifying people when responding to a census form, for example, can be 
frustrating. A woman, age 41, from Puerto Rico, was asked to identify 
her ethnicity and then her race. She considered herself to be  “all of 
these.” Annoyed and exasperated, “she checked Hispanic, and then 
identified herself as white, black, and ‘some other race’” (Vega, 2014, 
p. A12). To say that the world is becoming even more diverse via 
marriage, immigration, and life/work experiences is an understate-
ment. While understanding and being tolerant of human differences 
is desirable for living and working together harmoniously, classifica-
tion may be becoming less important. Moreover, research evidence 
regarding diversity and performance is anything but obvious. There 
is evidence that groups with heterogeneous learning styles outper-
form those with homogenous learning styles. In other words, group 
members with similar preferences for  how to learn do not perform 
on a variety of tasks as well as those groups with members having a 
mix of learning styles (Kayes, Kayes, & Kolb, 2005). But for groups 
composed of a mix of, for example, gender, age, ethnic background, 
and more macro demographic factors, the picture is much more com-
plicated. No study shows that the greater the demographic diversity 
of a work group, the higher (or lower for that matter) the group’s 
performance. Simple dispersion of group members does not predict 
group performance. Studies have classified people demographically, 
for example, gender, age race, ethnicity, or according  to job-related 
attributes, such as differences in education or functional background, 
or according to personality, attitudes, and values. None of these clas-
sifications relate directly to work group performance. In other words, 
there is no reliable link between the positive and negative effects of 
diversity to types of diversity. These statements are based on an exten-
sive review of the research literature between 1997 and 2005 con-
ducted by van Knippenberg and Schippers (2007). These researchers 
argue that determining the true effects of diversity on performance 
runs deeper than the more general dimensions of gender, educa-
tion, or personality. With diversity serving as context,  such variables 
as status and power differentials may be more important to study. 
Rather than study dispersion per se, women compared with men, as 
van Knippenberg and Schippers suggest, investigating the degree 
of difference is more important. A ten-member group of eight men 

42 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
and two women is not the same as one composed of eight women 
and two men. Although this is gradually changing, for now women 
in the Western world are more accustomed to being in the minor-
ity than men are. Thus, the dynamics within the group would differ 
and in turn have a differential impact on performance. Such research 
would tap into subtle differences of diversity and help to explain their 
influence on outcomes. Although the gender study just mentioned 
has probably not been done, studies of these more subtle differ-
ences have been conducted. For example, “the degree and nature 
of interdependence between group members moderates [that is, has 
an effect on] the relationship between work group diversity and out-
comes [that is] cooperative interdependence would thus be expected 
to be associated with effects of diversity that are more positive” (van 
Knippenberg & Schippers, 2007, p. 529). For example, Chatman and 
colleagues (Chatman, Polzer, Barsade, & Neale, 1998; Chatman & 
Spataro, 2005) demonstrated that when groups with collectivistic 
norms emphasized cooperation rather than independence and com-
petition, diversity was associated more with positive, as opposed to 
negative, group process and performance.  
 The point is that the term  diversity covers a lot of territory, and 
when it comes to understanding the relationship between the concept 
of diversity and performance, it is the subtle, less-obvious aspects of 
dissimilarities that are far more important than whether group mem-
bers are old or young, female or male, extravert or introvert, and 
so on.  
 Implication for OD: Assuming current trends will continue, half 
of the population in the United States by around the year 2050 will 
be a composite of Latino, African American, and Asian. This means 
that OD practitioners must become as astute as possible about the 
implications of these population shifts in the workplace. Although 
we can consider diversity at the organizational level; for example, its 
impact on the organization’s culture, the extent to which top execu-
tives incorporate issues of diversity into their planning and decision 
making particularly regarding mission and strategy, and the organi-
zation’s stance about how it wants to be seen  in the local commu-
nity, and beyond if a global operation; that is, not only tolerant of but 
seeking to employ a diverse workforce, the primary focus for the OD 
practitioner is at the work group level. There are at least two reasons 

 
CHAPTER  2 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT THEN AND NOW  
43
for this argument. One is the fact that by far most of the research on 
diversity has been conducted with groups not at the organizational 
level. Therefore, what knowledge we have to apply to our practice is 
predominantly at the group level. Second, the work group is where 
the action is on a daily basis in organizations. The OD practitioner, 
then, needs to be highly skilled in team building, perhaps still the cor-
nerstone of OD anyway; conflict management and resolution, includ-
ing intergroup conflict; and group dynamics in general, helping work 
groups (face-to-face and virtual, in real time and asynchronously) 
to deal with issues of boundaries, authority, roles, and the tasks at 
hand—not to mention expertise in how to run an effective meeting.  
 Dominance of Large Consulting Firms  
 Organization development operates within the larger world of 
organization change, or referred to as managing change, and this 
larger world is getting larger. This is not to say that individuals who 
prefer to work on their own can no longer do so. Nor are we claiming 
that there is no room in the organization change consulting arena for 
the boutique firms, say a company or partnership of 20 or so people. 
In fact, those boutiques that compete well can indeed grow. What 
we are saying is that this competitive process is more prolific and dif-
ficult now and is likely to  remain so for the foreseeable future. Why, 
you may ask? One reason is probably due to the complexity of the 
change process itself. It is now well known that the failure rate of 
organization change efforts is significant—beyond 70 percent (Burke, 
2011b). Moreover, it is more commonplace today for executives at 
the top of organizations, whether a consumer products company or a 
medical complex, to have experienced failure, or at least to have had 
an experience that could be described as “less than a success.” Thus, 
there is a growing appreciation among executives, especially those at 
the top of large  bureaucracies, that help is needed. And the larger and 
more complicated the organization, the more executives are likely to 
turn to a large consulting firm with a variety of expertise that can deal 
with complexities more effectively than a solo operator or small bou-
tique. Those potential clients are therefore more likely to seek help 
from Accenture, Deloite, Korn Ferry, Mckinsey, and other big firms 
that have been around for a while. Another possible reason is simply 

44 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
competition. The larger firms compete with one another, of course, 
and got bigger often via acquisitions of smaller firms, and in any case, 
are more aggressive regarding sales and marketing than smaller play-
ers. This trend is quite clear and is likely to continue.  
 Implication for OD: For those OD practitioners who are exter-
nal consultants rather than internal employees and are solo, more 
experience, as is usually the case, would be beneficial. However, an 
advantage for a boutique firm is to have specialties that few others 
have. For the smaller firms, attempting to be all things for all clients 
is not a good idea. Otherwise whether internal or external, working 
in large firms is the alternative, which means that OD practitioners 
in this category, employed by the larger organization, must be team 
players working together in groups to serve large-system clients. The 
implication here is  that until one has more time in, developing one’s 
emotional intelligence and capacity to work collaboratively is what 
can help to hold one in good stead in the short term (and the long 
term). In the world of consulting, there is little room for the young 
practitioner who may want to run her or his own show.  
 Conclusion  
 The field of organization development does not exist in a vacuum. 
The work is influenced by larger societal issues and trends every day. 
In the first part of this chapter, the trends from 1969–1994 in the 
second edition of this book were condensed. The latter part of the 
chapter addressed trends since 1994. By including the “ Implication 
for OD ” points for all the trends, we have leapt ahead of ourselves and 
in some cases touched on areas we cover in more depth in later chap-
ters, such as being nimble and agile and issues of power and politics. 
Treat our hastiness  as forthcoming attractions, the next of which is to 
cover the important origins of the field.

 Where Did Organization Development 
Come From?  
 Evolution is a better term than  birth to characterize the begin-
nings of organization development (OD) as a singular event. This 
chapter thus traces the evolution of OD from its forerunners and 
selected theoretical roots.  
 Before OD  
 Even in evolution, we must start somewhere. There was no “big 
bang” or “blessed event” in OD, but considering three forerunners or 
precursors will help us to understand the beginnings; that is, where 
OD came from. These three precursors are sensitivity training, socio-
technical systems, and survey feedback.  
 Sensitivity Training  
 From a historical perspective, it would be interesting to know 
how many events, inventions, and innovations that occurred around 
1946 had lasting impact through the subsequent decades. Apparently 
once World War II ended, people felt free to pursue creative endeav-
ors. Both sensitivity training, later “housed” at the National Train-
ing Laboratories (NTL), and a similar yet different version of human 
relations training independently founded at the Tavistock Institute in 
London, began about that time.  
 On the U.S. side, sensitivity training, or the T-group ( T for train-
ing, or laboratory training), all labels for the same process, consisted 

46 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
and still consists today of small-group (eight to ten people) discus-
sions in which the primary, almost exclusive source of information for 
learning is the behavior of the group members themselves. The feed-
back participants receive from one another regarding their behavior 
becomes a source of personal insight and development. Participants 
also learn about group behavior and intergroup relationships.  
 T-groups are educational vehicles for individual change. During 
the late 1950s, when this form of education began to be applied in 
industrial settings for organizational change, the T-group became one 
of the earliest so-called interventions of organization development.  
 Sensitivity training began to be used as an intervention for organi-
zational change. Members of the small T-groups were either organi-
zational “cousins”—from the same overall organization but not within 
the same vertical chain of the organization’s hierarchy—or members 
of the same organizational team, so-called family groups. Douglas 
McGregor of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology (MIT) conducted this kind of training at 
Union Carbide. Similar events at Esso (now Exxon Mobil) and at the 
Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake, California, represented 
the early forms of organization development, which usually took the 
form of what  we now call team building (Burck, 1965; McGregor, 
1967).  
 During the same period, circa 1959, McGregor and Richard 
Beckhard were consulting with General Mills. Working on what we 
now call a sociotechnical systems change, they helped to change some 
of the work structures at the various plants to introduce more team-
work and decision making at the shop-floor level. Although they fos-
tered more “bottom-up” management, they didn’t want to call what 
they were doing  bottom-up. Nor were they satisfied with  organiza-
tion development,  the label that became the name for the work Herb 
Shepard, Harry Kolb, Robert R. Blake, and others were doing at the 
Humble Refineries of Esso. Nevertheless, McGregor and Beckhard  
called what they were doing organization development. Meanwhile 
across the Atlantic at the Tavistock Institute, the label sociotechnical 
systems stuck.  

 
CHAPTER  3 • WHERE DID ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT COME FROM? 
47
 Sociotechnical Systems  
 In the United Kingdom at about the same time that sensitivity 
training began in the United States, Eric Trist and Ken Bamforth of 
the Tavistock Institute were consulting with a coal-mining company. 
They found that coal was mined by teams of six. Each team selected 
its own members and performed all tasks from extraction of the coal 
to loading to getting it to the surface. Teams were paid on the basis of 
group effort and unit productivity, not individual effort, and tended 
to be quite cohesive.  
 Problems arose with the introduction of new equipment and a 
change in technology that changed the way work was conducted. 
Individual, not group, labor became the norm. As work became more 
individualized and specialized and jobs more fractionated, productiv-
ity decreased and absenteeism increased.  
 Trist and Bamforth suggested combining the essential social ele-
ments of the previous team mode of work with the new technology. 
When the company’s management implemented their suggestions, 
productivity rose and absenteeism decreased. The specifics of this 
early work, including the documented measurements and outcomes, 
are reported in Trist (1960) and Trist and Bamforth (1951). Simi-
lar work was done by A. K. Rice, another Tavistock consultant and 
researcher, in two textile mills in Ahmedabad, India (Rice, 1958).  
 The approach pioneered by the Tavistock consultants is based on 
the premise that an organization is simultaneously a social and a tech-
nical system. Whether they produce something tangible or render a 
service, all organizations have technology, a subsystem of the total 
organization and an integral part of the culture. All organizations also 
are composed of people who interact around a task or series of tasks, 
and this human dimension constitutes the social subsystem. The 
emphasis of OD is typically on the social subsystem, but it should be 
clear that both subsystems and their interaction must be considered 
in any effort  toward organizational change.  

48 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Survey Feedback  
 Organization development has been influenced by industrial/
organizational psychology. This influence is perhaps manifested most 
in the third precursor to OD, survey feedback. Rensis Likert, the 
first director of the Institute for Social Research of the University of 
Michigan, started by founding the Survey Research Center in 1946. 
Kurt Lewin had founded the Research Center for Group Dynam-
ics at MIT. With his untimely death in 1947, the Center was moved 
to the University of Michigan later that year. These two centers ini-
tially constituted Likert’s institute. The two primary thrusts of these 
centers, questionnaire surveys for organizational diagnosis and group 
dynamics, combined  to give birth to the survey feedback method. As 
early as 1947, questionnaires were being used systematically to assess 
employee morale and attitudes in organizations.  
 One of the first of these studies, initiated and guided by Likert 
and conducted by Floyd Mann, was done with the Detroit Edison 
Company. From their work on the problem of how best to use the 
survey data for organization improvement, the method we now know 
as survey feedback evolved. Mann was key to the development of this 
method. He noted that, when a manager was given the survey results, 
any resulting improvement depended on what the manager did with 
the information. If the manager discussed the survey results with 
his subordinates yet failed to plan certain changes for improvement  
jointly with them, nothing happened—except, perhaps, an increase in 
employee frustration with the ambiguity of having answered a ques-
tionnaire and never hearing anything further.  
 Briefly, the survey feedback method involves, first, the survey, 
collecting data by questionnaire to determine employees’ perceptions 
of a variety of factors, most focusing on the management of the orga-
nization. The second step is the feedback, reporting the results of the 
survey systematically in summary form to all people who answered 
the questionnaire. Systematically, in this case, means that feedback 
occurs in phases, starting with the top team of the organization and 
flowing downward according to the formal hierarchy and within 
functional units or teams. Mann (1957) referred to this cascade as 
the “interlocking chain of conferences.” The chief executive officer, 
the division general manager, or the bureau chief, depending on the 

 
CHAPTER  3 • WHERE DID ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT COME FROM? 
49
organization or subunit surveyed, and his or her immediate group of 
subordinates receive and discuss feedback from the survey first. Next, 
the subordinates and their respective groups of immediate subordi-
nates do the same, and so forth downward until all members of the 
organization who had been surveyed hear a summary of the survey 
and then participate in a discussion of the meaning of the data and the 
implications. Each functional unit of the organization receives general 
feedback concerning the overall organization and specific feedback 
regarding its particular group.  Following a discussion of the meaning 
of the survey results for their particular group, the boss and his or her 
subordinates then jointly plan action steps for improvement. Usually, 
a consultant meets with each of the groups to help with data analysis, 
group discussion, and plans for improvement.  
 This is a rather orderly and systematic way of understanding an 
organization from the standpoint of employee perceptions. Process-
ing this understanding back into the organization so that change can 
occur, with the help of an outside resource person, not only was a 
direct precursor to and root of organization development, it is an inte-
gral part of many current OD efforts.  
 Current OD efforts using survey feedback methodology do not, 
however, always follow a top-down, cascading process. The sur-
vey may begin in the middle of the managerial hierarchy and move 
in either or both directions, or may begin at the bottom and work 
upward, as Edgar Schein (1969) has suggested. For more information 
about and guidelines for conducting survey feedback activities, see 
David Nadler’s book (Nadler, 1977).  
 Finally, it should be noted that there are other forerunners or 
precursors to OD. A case in point is the activity prior to World War 
II at the Hawthorne Works of Western Electric. There, Mayo (1933), 
Roethlisberger and Dickson (1939), and Homans (1950) established 
that psychological and sociotechnical factors make significant differ-
ences in worker performance.  
 The work at Hawthorne and its consequent impact occurred 
some two decades prior to the three precursors we chose to discuss 
in some detail. Thus, sensitivity training, sociotechnical systems, and 
survey feedback had a much greater and more direct influence on the 
beginnings of OD.

ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Theoretical Roots  
 Organization development has other roots in the area of concepts, 
models, and theories. What follows is a synopsis of some of the think-
ing of a fairly select group of people who have helped to provide most 
of the theoretical and conceptual underpinnings of OD. Ten theorists 
or conceptualizers were selected to represent the theory associated 
with OD because no single theory or conceptual model is representa-
tive or by itself encompasses the conceptual field or the practice of 
OD. We have instead a group of minitheories that have influenced 
the thinking and consultative practice of OD practitioners; each helps 
to explain  only a portion of organizational behavior and effectiveness.  
 Ten theory categories were selected because they best represent 
the theory we do have within the field of OD. Some prominent names 
in the field of OD were not included because their contributions have 
been more descriptive than theoretical (an example is Blake and 
Mouton’s 1964  Managerial Grid ). The selection is a matter of judg-
ment and could be debated. In fact, I (Burke) have heard Frederick 
Herzberg state that he did not associate himself with the field. B. F. 
Skinner probably never heard of organization development. In other 
words, these theorists did not elect themselves into OD. We have 
chosen  them because we believe their thinking has had a large impact 
on the practice of OD.  
 Need Theory—Maslow and Herzberg  
 According to Maslow (1954), human motivation can be explained 
in terms of needs that people experience to varying degrees all the 
time. An unsatisfied need creates a state of tension, which releases 
energy in the human system and, at the same time, provides direction. 
This purposeful energy guides the individual toward some goal that 
will respond to the unsatisfied need. The process whereby an unsatis-
fied need provides energy and direction toward some goal is Maslow’s 
definition of motivation. Thus, only unsatisfied needs are motivating; 
a satisfied need creates no tension and therefore no motivation.  
 Maslow contended that we progress through a five-level need sys-
tem one level at a time. The hierarchy represents a continuum from 

 
CHAPTER  3 • WHERE DID ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT COME FROM? 
51
basic or physiological needs to safety and security needs to belonging 
needs to ego-status needs to a need for self-actualization.  
 It is on this last point, a single continuum, that Herzberg parts 
company with Maslow. Herzberg (1966; Herzberg, Mausner, & Sny-
derman, 1959) maintains that there are two continua, one concerning 
dissatisfaction and the other concerning satisfaction. It may be that 
the two theorists are even more fundamentally different in that Herz-
berg’s approach has more to do with job satisfaction than with human 
motivation. The implications and applications of the two are much 
more similar than they are divergent, however.  
 Herzberg argues that only the goal objects associated with 
Maslow’s ego-status and self-actualization needs provide motivation 
or satisfaction on the job. Meeting the lower-order needs simply 
reduces dissatisfaction; it does not provide satisfaction. Herzberg calls 
the goal objects associated with these lower-level needs (belonging, 
safety, and basic) hygiene or maintenance factors. Providing fringe 
benefits, for example, prevents dissatisfaction and thus is hygienic, 
but this provision does not ensure job satisfaction. Only motivator fac-
tors, such as recognition, opportunity for achievement, and autonomy 
on the job ensure satisfaction.  
 Herzberg’s two categories, motivator factors and maintenance or 
hygiene factors, do not overlap. They represent qualitatively different 
aspects of human motivation.  
 One other point of Herzberg’s is important: He states that not 
only does the dimension of job dissatisfaction differ psychologically 
from job satisfaction, but it is also associated with an escalation phe-
nomenon, or what some have called the principle of rising expecta-
tions: The more people receive, the more they want. This principle 
applies only to job dissatisfaction. Herzberg uses the example of a 
person who receives a salary increase of $1,000 one year and then 
receives only a $500 increase the following year. Psychologically, the 
second increase is a cut in pay. Herzberg maintains that this escala-
tion principle is a  fact of life, and that we must live with it. Manage-
ment must continue to provide, upgrade, and increase maintenance 
factors—good working conditions, adequate salaries, and competitive 
fringe benefits—but should not operate under the false assumption 
that these factors will lead to greater job satisfaction.  

52 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Job enrichment, a significant intervention within OD and a criti-
cal element of quality-of-work-life projects, is a direct application of 
Herzberg’s theory and at least an indirect one of Maslow’s.  
 Expectancy Theory—Lawler and Vroom  
 Expectancy theory (Lawler, 1973; Vroom, 1964) has yet to have 
the impact on organization development that need theory has had, 
but it is gaining in acceptance and popularity. This approach to under-
standing human motivation focuses more on outward behavior than 
on internal needs. The theory is based on three assumptions:  
  
1.  People believe that their behavior is associated with certain 
outcomes. Theorists call this belief the  performance-outcome 
expectancy. People may expect that if they accomplish certain 
tasks, they will receive certain rewards.  
  
2.  Outcomes or rewards have different values ( valence ) for differ-
ent people. Some people, for example, are more attracted to 
money as a reward than others are.  
  
3.  People associate their behavior with certain probabilities of 
success, called the  effort-performance expectancy. People on 
an assembly line, for example, may have high expectancies that 
if they try, they can produce 100 units per hour, but their ex-
pectancies may be very low that they can produce 150 units, 
regardless of how hard they may try.  
 Thus, people will be highly motivated when they believe that 
their behavior will lead to certain rewards, that these rewards are 
worthwhile and valuable, and that they are able to perform at a level 
that will result in the attainment of the rewards.  
 Research has shown that high-performing employees believe that 
their behavior, or performance, leads to rewards that they desire. 
Thus, there is evidence for the validity of the theory. Moreover, the 
theory and the research outcomes associated with it have implications 
for how reward systems and work might be designed and structured.

53
 Job Satisfaction—Hackman and Oldham  
 Hackman and Oldham’s (1980)  work design model is grounded in 
both need theory and expectancy theory. Their model is more restric-
tive in that it focuses on the relationship between job or work design 
and worker satisfaction. Although their model frequently leads to 
what is called job enrichment, as does the application of Herzberg’s 
motivator-hygiene theory, the Hackman and Oldham model has 
broader implications. Briefly, Hackman and Oldham (1975) contend 
that there are three primary psychological states that significantly 
affect worker satisfaction:  
  
1.  Experienced meaningfulness of the work itself 
  
2.  Experienced responsibility for the work and its outcomes 
  
3.  Knowledge of results, or performance feedback 
 The more that work is designed to enhance these states, the more 
satisfying the work will be.  
 Positive Reinforcement—Skinner  
 The best way to understand the full importance of the applica-
tions of B. F. Skinner’s (1953, 1971) thinking and his research results 
is to read his novel,  Walden Two (1948). The book is about a Utopian 
community designed and maintained according to Skinnerian prin-
ciples of operant behavior and schedules of reinforcement. A simi-
lar application was made in an industrial situation in the Emery Air 
Freight case (“At Emery Air Freight,” 1973). By applying Skinnerian 
principles, which are based on numerous research findings, Emery 
quickly realized an annual savings of $650,000. Skinner was neither 
an OD practitioner nor a management consultant, but his theory and 
research are indeed applicable to management practices and to orga-
nizational change. For Skinner, control is key. If one can control the 
environment, one can then control behavior. In Skinner’s approach, 
the more the environment is controlled, the better, but the necessary 
element of control is the rewards, both positive and negative. This 
necessity is based on a fundamental of behavior that Skinner derived 
from his many years of research, a concept so basic that it may be a 

54 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
law of behavior, that people (and animals) do what they are rewarded 
for doing. Let us consider the principles  that underlie this fundamen-
tal of behavior.  
 The first phase of learned behavior is called  shaping, the process 
of successive approximations to reinforcement. When children are 
learning to walk, they are reinforced by their parents’ encouraging 
comments or physical stroking, but this reinforcement typically fol-
lows only the behaviors that lead to effective walking.  Programmed 
learning, invented by Skinner, is based on this principle. To maintain 
the behavior, a schedule of reinforcement is applied and, generally, 
the more variable the schedule is, the longer the behavior will last.  
 Skinner, therefore, advocates positive reinforcement for shaping 
and controlling behavior. Often, however, when we consider control-
ling behavior, we think of punishment (“If you don’t do this, you’re 
gonna get it!”). According to Skinner, punishment is ineffective. His 
stance is not based entirely on his values or whims, however. Research 
clearly shows that, although punishment may temporarily stop a cer-
tain behavior, negative reinforcement must be administered continu-
ously for this certain process to be maintained. The principle is the 
opposite of that for positively reinforced behavior. There are two very 
practical concerns here. First, having to reinforce a certain behav-
ior continuously is not very efficient. Second, although the punished 
behavior may be curtailed, it is unlikely that the subject will learn 
what to do; all that is learned is what  not to do. 
 Thus, the way to control behavior according to Skinnerian theory 
and research is to reinforce the desirable behavior positively and, 
after the shaping process, to reinforce the behavior only occasionally. 
The implication of Skinner’s work for organizations is that a premium 
is placed on such activities as establishing incentive systems, reduc-
ing or eliminating many of the control systems that contain inherent 
threats and punishments, providing feedback to all levels of employ-
ees regarding their performance, and developing programmed-
learning techniques for training employees.  
 The application of Skinner’s work to OD did not occur system-
atically until the 1970s. Thus, his influence is not as pervasive as is 
Maslow’s, for example. Skinner’s behavior-motivation techniques as 
applied to people also raise significant questions regarding ethics and 

 
CHAPTER  3 • WHERE DID ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT COME FROM? 
55
values: Who exercises the control, and is the recipient aware? Thus, it 
is not a question of whether Skinner’s methodology works, but rather 
how and under what circumstances it is used.  
 The Group as the Focus of Change—Lewin  
 The theorist among theorists, at least within the scope of the 
behavioral sciences, is Kurt Lewin. His thinking has had a more per-
vasive impact on organization development, both direct and indirect, 
than any other person’s. It was Lewin who laid the groundwork for 
much of what we know about social change, particularly in a group 
and by some extrapolation in an organization.  
 According to Lewin (1948, 1951), behavior is a function of a per-
son’s personality, discussed primarily in terms of motivation or needs, 
and the situation or environment in which the person is acting. The 
environment is represented as a field of forces that affect the person. 
Thus, a person’s behavior at any given moment can be predicted if 
we know that person’s needs and if we can determine the  intensity 
and  valence (whether the force is positive or negative for the per-
son) of the forces impinging on the person from the environment. 
Although Lewin borrowed the term  force from physics, he defined 
the construct  psychologically. Thus, one’s  perception of the environ-
ment is key, not necessarily reality. An example of a force, therefore, 
could be the perceived power of another person. Whether or not I 
will accomplish a task you want me to do is a function of the degree 
to which such accomplishment will respond to a need I have and how 
I perceive your capacity to influence me—whether you are a force in 
my environment (field).  
 Lewin made a distinction between  imposed or induced forces, 
those acting on a person from the outside, and  own forces, those 
directly reflecting the person’s needs. The implications of this distinc-
tion are clear. Participation in determining a goal is more likely to 
create own forces toward accomplishing it than is a situation in which 
goal determination is imposed by others. When a goal is imposed on 
a person, his or her motives may match accomplishment of the goal, 
but the chances are considerably more variable or random than if the 
goal is determined by the person in the first place. Typically, then,  

56 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
for imposed or induced goals to be accomplished by a person, the 
one who induced them must exert continuous influence or else the 
person’s other motives, not associated with goal accomplishment, will 
likely determine his or her behavior. This aspect of Lewin’s theory 
helps to explain the generally positive consequences of participative 
management and consensual decision making.  
 Another distinction Lewin made regarding various forces in a 
person’s environment is the one between  driving and  restraining 
forces. Borrowing yet another concept from physics, quasi-stationary 
equilibria, he noted that the perceived status quo in life is just that— 
a perception. In reality, albeit psychological reality, a given situation 
is a result of a dynamic rather than a static process. The process flows 
from one moment to the next, with ups and downs, and over time 
gives the impression of a static situation, but there actually are some 
forces pushing in one direction and other, counterbalancing forces 
that restrain movement. The level of productivity  in an organization 
may appear static, for example, but sometimes it is pushed higher, say 
by supervisory pressure, and sometimes it is restrained or even dimin-
ished by a counterforce, such as a norm of the work group.  Force-field 
analysis is used to identify the counterbalancing forces that deter-
mine situations.  
 Change from the status quo is therefore a two-step process, 
according to Lewin. Step 1 is to conduct a force-field analysis, and 
step 2 is to increase or decrease the intensity of a force or set of forces. 
Change can be fostered by adding to or increasing the intensity of the 
forces Lewin labeled  driving forces —those forces that push in the 
desired direction for change. Or change can be fostered by dimin-
ishing the opposing or restraining forces. Lewin’s theory predicts 
that the better of these two choices is to reduce the intensity of the 
restraining forces. By adding forces or  increasing the intensity on the 
driving side, a simultaneous increase would occur on the restraining 
side, and the overall tension for the system—whether it is a person, a 
group, or an organization—would intensify. The better choice, then, 
is to reduce the restraining forces.  
 This facet of Lewin’s field theory helps us to determine not only 
the nature of change but how to accomplish it more effectively. 
Lewinian theory argues that it is more efficacious to direct change at 
the group level than at the individual level.  

 
CHAPTER  3 • WHERE DID ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT COME FROM? 
57
 If one attempts to change an attitude or the behavior of an indi-
vidual without attempting to change the same behavior or attitude in 
the group to which the individual belongs, then the individual will be 
a deviate and either will come under pressure from the group to get 
back into line or will be rejected entirely. Thus, the major leverage 
point for change is at the group level—for example, by modifying a 
group norm or standard. According to Lewin:  
 As long as group standards are unchanged, the individual will 
resist change more strongly the farther he is to depart from 
group standards. If the group standard itself is changed, the 
resistance which is due to the relation between individual and 
group standard is eliminated (1958, 210).  
 Adherence to Lewinian theory involves viewing the organization 
as a social system, with many and varied subsystems, primarily groups. 
We look at the behavior of people in the organization in terms of (1) 
whether their needs jibe with the organization’s directions, usually 
determined by their degree of commitment, (2) the norms to which 
people conform and the degree of that conformity, (3) how power is 
exercised (induced versus own forces), and (4) the decision-making 
process (involvement leading to commitment).  
 Changing Values Through the Group—Argyris  
 It is not possible to place the work of Chris Argyris in one cat-
egory, one theory, or one conceptual framework. He has developed 
a number of minitheories, whose relationship and possible overlap 
are not always apparent. He has always focused largely on interper-
sonal and group behavior, however, and he has emphasized behav-
ioral change within a group context, along the same value lines as 
McGregor’s (1960) Theory Y. The work described in  Management 
and Organizational Development (Argyris, 1971) best illustrates this 
emphasis.  
 Argyris’s early work (1962) emphasized the relationship of indi-
vidual personality and organizational dynamics. To improve satisfac-
tion in this relationship, the organization must adjust its value system 
toward helping its members to be more psychologically healthy, less 
dependent on and controlled by the organization. The individuals 

58 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
must become more open with their feelings, more willing to trust one 
another, and more internally committed to the organization’s goals.  
 In his thinking, research, and writing during the late 1960s and 
early 1970s, Argyris became more clearly associated with organization 
development. His thrust of this period was in (1) theorizing about 
competent consultation, and especially about the nature of an effec-
tive intervention and (2) operationalizing organizational change in 
behavioral terms by McGregor’s Theory Y (Argyris, 1971). Argyris 
(1970) contends that, for any intervention into an organization-social 
system to be effective, it must generate valid information, lead to free, 
informed choice on the part of the client, and provide internal com-
mitment by the client to the choices taken.  
 Later, Argyris turned his attention to the gaps in people’s behavior 
between what they say (he calls it espoused theory) and what they do 
(theory in action). People may say that they believe that McGregor’s 
Theory Y assumptions about human beings are valid, for example, but 
they may not act accordingly. Argyris goes on to argue that as people 
become more aware of these gaps between their stated beliefs and 
their behavior, they will be more motivated to reduce the differences, 
to be more consistent.  
 In collaboration with Don Schön, Argyris studied and elaborated 
the learning process involved in obtaining greater self-awareness 
and organizational awareness about human effectiveness (Argyris 
and Schön, 1978). Argyris and Schön argue that most organiza-
tions accomplish no more than  single loop learning, that problems 
are solved or fixed and a single loop of learning is accomplished. To 
improve an organization significantly and to ensure its long-term sur-
vival and renewal, however, change must occur in more fundamental 
ways. Although problems must be solved in a single loop, new ways of 
learning how to solve problems must be learned as well. Another loop 
is thus added to the learning cycle—what Argyris and Schön refer to 
as  double loop learning. This process of learning is analogous to if not 
the same as the way OD is sometimes defined as a planned process of 
change in the organization’s culture—how we do things and how we 
relate to one another.  

 
CHAPTER  3 • WHERE DID ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT COME FROM? 
59
 The Group Unconscious—Bion  
 Most people believe that everyone has an unconscious: Freud has 
clearly had an effect. Wilfred Bion believed, as others do, that there 
is also a group unconscious—a collective unconscious that is more 
than the sum of the individual unconscious. Bion gave compelling but 
complex arguments for this theory (Bion, 1961; Rioch, 1970).  
 Bion believed that every group is actually composed of two 
groups, the work group and the basic-assumption group; that is, every 
group behaves as if it were two groups, one concerned with group 
accomplishment and rational actions, the other concerned with activ-
ity that stems from the unconscious and is irrational. Bion did not 
mean simply that a group is both rational and irrational. He went far 
beyond this commonly accepted dichotomy.  
 The  work group is the aspect of group functioning that is con-
cerned with accomplishing what the group is composed to do, the 
task at hand. The work group is aware of its purpose, or at the outset 
knows that its initial task is to establish clarity of purpose. The work 
group is sure about, or quickly becomes sure about, roles and respon-
sibilities in the group. The work group is also clearly conscious of the 
passage of time and the procedures and processes needed to accom-
plish the task.  
 How many times have you been a member or leader of a group 
that fit such a description? I suspect that it has not been very often, if 
ever. Bion stated that groups do not behave in this clearly rational and 
sensible way because there is always another group operating simul-
taneously—the  basic-assumption group. 
 Bion theorized that all groups function according to basic assump-
tions, that groups operate as if certain things are inevitable. Perhaps 
an analogy will help to explain. In the early days of automobiles, many 
people made the basic assumption that no motorized vehicle could 
go faster than a horse, and these people acted accordingly. In fact, 
some of them eventually lost money because they bet heavily on their 
assumption. The point is that they acted as if their beliefs were true 
and inevitable.  

60 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 There are three types of basic-assumption groups: the dependency 
group, the fight-flight group, and the pairing group. The  dependency 
group assumes that the reason the group exists is to be protected and 
to be assured of providence by its leader. The group members act 
immaturely, childishly, and as if they know little or nothing as com-
pared with the leader. The leader is all-powerful and wise. In the 
dependency group, the leader is typically idolized. However, because 
we mortals are neither omnipotent nor omniscient, group members 
soon realize that they must seek someone new to depend on and the 
cycle then repeats  itself with a new leader.  
 The  fight-flight group assumes that it must preserve itself, that its 
survival is at stake, so group members act accordingly. Taking action 
is the key to survival, as in the proverbial army command: “Do some-
thing even if it’s wrong!” It is the  group that must be preserved, so 
individuals may be sacrificed through fight or abandonment (flight). 
The leader’s role in this basic-assumption group is clear: to lead the 
group into battle or retreat. The best leader is one who acts in a para-
noid manner, assuming that “They’re out to get us, gang!” Eventually 
and inevitably, the leader will not meet all  the group’s demands, at 
which point the group panics and searches for a new leader.  
 In the  pairing group, the assumption is that the group’s purpose 
is to give birth to a new messiah. The leader in this case is purely 
incidental, and the group must quickly get on with the business of 
bringing forth the new savior. Two members therefore pair off to pro-
create. The two may be both male, both female, or male and female, 
but the basic assumption is that when two people pair, the pairing is 
sexual in nature, even though it may take the innocent form of estab-
lishing a subcommittee. Although new life and hope may be provided, 
the new messiah,  as with the Christian Messiah, will soon be done 
away with. All the basic-assumption groups behave as if the leader 
must be replaced or, to use Bion’s more dramatic and graphic termi-
nology, as if the leader must be crucified.  
 Although the work group and the basic-assumption group 
are functioning simultaneously, their degree of activity varies. At 
times, the work group is predominant and at other times the basic-
assumption group holds sway.  

 
CHAPTER  3 • WHERE DID ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT COME FROM? 
61
 Bion was never an OD practitioner; he was a psychotherapist. His 
theory, however, is applicable to interventions with teams, consulta-
tion with leaders, and diagnosis of possible processes of collusion. For 
a direct application and extension of the latter group or organizational 
dynamic, see Harvey’s “The Abilene Paradox” (1974), an extension of 
Bion’s theory that explains collusive behavior on the part of members 
of a group.  
 For the OD practitioner serving as a consultant to an organiza-
tional team, Bion’s theory is particularly useful for diagnosing internal 
problems, especially those concerning team members’ relationships 
with the leader. For example, when subordinates defer to the boss 
for most if not all decisions, a basic-assumption mode of dependency 
may be occurring, with the work group mode being submerged. 
Calling this process to the attention of the group may break the 
basic-assumption mode and help to facilitate the group’s task accom-
plishment. An OD practitioner might intervene with a comment like, 
“We seem to be looking to (the boss) for practically  all of our problem 
solutions,” and follow up with a question such as, “Don’t we have 
experience among us that we could tap into more?” Helping a work 
group to stay focused on its task is a way of preventing flight and 
another example of how to apply Bion’s theory.  
 Bion’s work, not surprisingly, has spawned additional theoriz-
ing. Two other basic assumption groups have been postulated. They 
are  oneness and  me-ness . In the  oneness group (Turquet, 1985), the 
assumption is that if group members surrender their individuality in 
service of joining a powerful union with an omnipotent force, they 
will feel existence, wholeness, and well-being, at one with the all-
powerful other. An example of basic-assumption  oneness is a religious 
cult in which the group is bound together by its veneration of a person 
or an ideal.  
 As proposed by Lawrence, Bain, and Gould (1996), basic-
assumption  me-ness is the opposite of oneness. In basic-assumption 
me-ness, group members act as if there is no group because if there 
were a group, it would represent all that is negative in group life. 
Individuals focus on their own personal boundaries and engage solely 
in instrumental transactions as they fear that joining the group would 
lead to becoming part of an undifferentiated mob. The me-ness basic 

62 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
assumption is hypothesized to be a reflection of postindustrial soci-
ety in which the perceived demands of the external environment are 
such that one must deny their  existence and focus exclusively on one’s 
inner reality.  
 Participative Management—the One Best Way—Likert  
 Likert is best known for two concepts: the linking pin notion of 
management and the four-system model of organizations. He is also 
known for his unequivocal advocacy of participative management as 
the approach to be taken by managers, regardless of organizational 
type. Likert’s method for organization development is survey feed-
back. We shall consider each of these concepts briefly.  
 Likert’s (1961) idea of the linking pin originated from his desire to 
design organizations in a more decentralized form without eliminat-
ing the hierarchical structure. He also wanted to incorporate more 
opportunity for group activity, especially group decision making, in 
the managerial process. Thus, each manager is simultaneously a mem-
ber of two groups, one in which he or she manages and is the leader 
and one in which he or she is a subordinate and follows the leadership 
of a boss. By being a member of both these hierarchical groups, the 
person becomes a key  link within the vertical chain of command. This 
linkage manifests itself primarily in activities involving communica-
tion and resolution of conflict. The manager-subordinate, therefore, 
is the primary conduit for information and facilitates the resolution of 
conflict, by virtue of the linking position, when there are differences 
between the two vertically connected organizational groups. An orga-
nization chart is drawn so that groups overlap vertically rather than in 
the more traditional way, as separate boxes connected only by lines.  
 Likert (1967) described four major models or systems of organi-
zation design: the autocratic, the benevolent autocratic, the consulta-
tive, and the participative. He used seven organizational functions to 
describe the four models differentially: leadership, motivation, com-
munication, interaction and influence, decision making, goal setting, 
and control. His “Profile of Organizational Characteristics,” a diag-
nostic questionnaire, is organized according to these seven functions 

 
CHAPTER  3 • WHERE DID ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT COME FROM? 
63
and four models. Organizational members’ answers to the question-
naire provide a perceptual profile of the organization. The profile is 
derived from the respondents’ views of how the seven functions are 
managed and depicts which of the four systems seems to be  predomi-
nant, at least in the eyes of the respondents.  
 Likert not only argued that there is one best way to manage, he 
also espoused one best way to conduct an OD effort. His method is 
survey feedback; his survey instrument, the Profile of Organizational 
Characteristics, organizes feedback for analysis according to the four-
system model of organizational management. In an OD effort, then, 
Likert’s approach is highly data-based, but the diagnosis is largely lim-
ited to the functions he deems important. Once the survey data are 
collected, they are given back in profile form to organizational family 
units—to a boss and his or her team—as described earlier.  
 Although organizational change agents may be uncomfortable 
with Likert’s one best way and may prefer an approach that is more 
contingent and perhaps more flexible, they can be very sure of the 
direction and the objectives of the change effort.  
 It All Depends—Lawrence and Lorsch  
 For an organization to operate efficiently and effectively, one per-
son cannot do everything, and every organizational member cannot 
do the same thing. In any organization, therefore, there is a division 
of labor. Lawrence and Lorsch (1967, 1969) call this  differentiation. 
In an organization with many divisions, some people must provide 
coordination, so that what the organization does is organized in some 
fashion. Lawrence and Lorsch label this process  integration. Their 
approach is sometimes referred to as a theory of differentiation-
integration. A more appropriate label, however, and the one they 
prefer, is  contingency theory. They believe that how an organization 
should be structured and  how it should be managed depend on sev-
eral factors, primarily the organization’s environment, or its market-
place. The central elements of the Lawrence and Lorsch contingency 
theory are differentiation, integration, the organization-environment 
interface, and the implicit contract between the employees and 
management.  

64 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Differentiation means dividing up tasks so that everything that 
needs to be done is accomplished. To determine the degree of dif-
ferentiation in an organization, Lawrence and Lorsch consider four 
variables:  
  
1.  Goal certainty. Are goals clear and easily measured or ambigu-
ous and largely qualitative?  
  
2.  Structure. Is the structure formal, with precise policy and pro-
cedures, or loose and flexible, with policy largely a function of 
current demand?  
  
3.  Interaction. Is there considerable interpersonal and intergroup 
communication and cooperation or very little?  
  
4.  Timespan of feedback. Do people in the organization see the 
results of their work quickly or does it take a long time?  
 The more that units within an organization differ from one 
another along these four dimensions, the more differentially struc-
tured the organization is. Some units may be very sure of their goals 
while others are not so sure, and some units may follow strict and 
precise work procedures while other units are still trying to formulate 
working procedures. It should be clear, therefore, that highly differ-
entiated organizations are more difficult to coordinate. In a pyramidal 
organization, the coordination and the resolution of conflict are han-
dled by the next higher level of management. When organizations are 
simultaneously highly differentiated and decentralized with  respect 
to management, Lawrence and Lorsch argue that integrator roles are 
needed, that certain people must be given specific assignments for 
coordinating and integrating diverse functions. These people may or 
may not be in key decision-making positions, but they ensure that 
decisions are made by someone or by the appropriate group.  
 How should an organization be structured, differentiated, and 
centralized (pyramidal) or decentralized? We already know the 
answer: It depends. But on what does it depend? Lawrence and Lorsch 
argue that it depends primarily on the organization’s environment, on 
whether the environment is complex and rapidly changing, as in the 
electronics industry, or relatively simple (one or two major markets) 
and stable (raw materials forthcoming and predictable and market 
likely to remain essentially the same in the foreseeable future). The 

 
CHAPTER  3 • WHERE DID ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT COME FROM? 
65
more complex the environment, the more decentralized and flexible 
management should be. Lawrence and Lorsch’s reasoning is that, the 
more rapidly  changing the environment, the more necessary it is that 
the organization have people monitoring these changes, and the more 
they should be in a position to make decisions on the spot. When the 
organization’s environment is not particularly complex and when con-
ditions are relatively stable, management should be more centralized 
because this way of structuring is more efficient.  
 Lawrence and Lorsch consider matters of conflict resolution 
because conflicts arise quickly and naturally in a highly differenti-
ated organization and the management of these conflicts is critical 
for efficient and effective organizational functioning. Moreover, if 
the organization is highly differentiated and decentralized, conflict is 
even more likely.  
 Finally, how well an organization operates is also a function of 
the nature of the interface between management and employees. 
Lawrence and Lorsch recognize the importance of individual motiva-
tion and effective supervision. They tend to view motivation in terms 
of expectancy, believing that employees’ motivation (and morale) is 
based on the degree to which their expectations about how they should 
be treated are actually met by management in the work environment.  
 In summary, Lawrence and Lorsch, contingency theorists, advo-
cate no single form of organizational structure or single style of man-
agement. The structure and the style depend on the business of the 
organization and its environment—how variable or how stable it is.  
 Lawrence and Lorsch have been among the most influential theo-
rists for OD practitioners. Considering contingencies before acting 
has proven to be a popular approach to OD.  
 The Organization as a Family—Levinson  
 Harry Levinson believes that an organization operates like a fam-
ily, with the chief executive officer taking the role of all-powerful par-
ent, either father or mother, depending on the culture and structure 
of the organization. According to Levinson, all organizations “reca-
pitulate the basic family structure in a culture.” The type of organiza-
tion Levinson understands best is the family-owned business, and his 

66 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
theory about organizations and how they operate and change has its 
roots in Freudian psychology (Levinson, 1972a, b).  
 Levinson does not look at organizations exclusively through psy-
choanalytical glasses, however. He is well aware that structure, the 
type of business, and the outside environment affect the internal 
behavioral dynamics of organizations. More important for Levinson’s 
diagnosis of an organization, however, is the nature of the organiza-
tion’s personality (we might call it culture). He believes that an orga-
nization has a personality, just as an individual does, and that the 
health of an organization, like that of a person, can be determined in 
terms of how effectively the various parts of the personality are inte-
grated. He refers to this process as   maintaining equilibrium. Levin-
son also believes that implicit psychological contracts exist between 
management and employees, based on earlier experiences from fam-
ily life. If the employees behave themselves (are good boys and girls), 
the parents (management) will reward them appropriately. Thus, the 
psychological contract is characterized by dependency. Note that this 
aspect of Levinson’s theory is similar to Argyris’s theory.  
 Continuing the psychoanalytic paradigm, Levinson theorizes that 
the chief executive officer represents the ego ideal for the organiza-
tional family and that this ideal, for better or for worse, motivates the 
kinds of people who are attracted to the organization in the first place, 
the interaction patterns among people in the organization, especially 
in matters of authority, and the kinds of people who are promoted. If 
a chief executive officer stays in office for a long time, the personality 
of the organization slowly crystallizes over the years; those who aspire 
to the ego ideal stay in the organization, and those who  do not leave. 
Accordingly, Levinson believes that history is a critical factor in diag-
nosing an organization.  
 In summary, as a consultant, Levinson uses the clinical case 
method in diagnosis, intervenes primarily at the top of an organiza-
tion, and bases his theory on psychoanalysis. In his own words:  
 You’ve got to take into account all the factors in an organiza-
tion, just as you gather all the main facts of a person’s life in 
taking a case history. But you need a comprehensive theory 
like psychoanalysis to make sense of all the facts, to make it 
hang together in a useful way (1972a, 126).

 Conclusion  
 At the risk of oversimplification, we have summarized ten the-
ories by categorizing them according to perspective, emphasis, and 
application. A summary of these factors is given in  Table  3.1 . Keep 
in mind that there is no single, all-encompassing theory for organiza-
tion development. What we have are several minitheories that help 
us understand certain aspects of organizational behavior and OD. 
Taken together and comparatively, they become more useful to the 
practitioner who must cope with an ever-changing, complex, total 
organization.  
 Thus, OD comes from many sources and has its roots in more 
than one methodology and in a variety of theories and concepts. The 
background provided in this chapter, though varied, nevertheless has 
commonality. The trunk from these roots might be expressed as the 
attempt to improve an organization with methods that involve people 
and to create conditions whereby the talents of these people are used 
more effectively.

 Organization Development as a 
Process of Change  
 Recall the definition of organization development (OD): a 
planned process of change in an organization’s culture through the 
utilization of behavioral science technology and theory. The focus of 
this chapter is on the process of change and on utilization of theory.  
 Although the practice of OD may be based on portions of several 
theories from the behavioral sciences, as stated in the previous chap-
ter, there is no single, all-encompassing theory of OD. This no doubt 
constitutes a weakness of the field, but it is not surprising because it is 
a very young field, having its origins around 1959, and is based on 
several disciplines. Nevertheless, most practitioners agree that three 
models are the underlying and guiding frames of reference for any 
OD effort: (1) the action research model; (2) Lewin’s three-step 
model of system change—unfreezing, moving, and refreezing; and 
(3) phases  of planned change as delineated by Lippitt, Watson, and 
Westley (1958).  1 These models are not mutually exclusive, and all 
stem from the original thinking of Kurt Lewin.  
 Action Research  
 The words  action research reverse the actual sequence (Brown, 
1972). In practice, research is conducted first and then action is taken 
as a direct result of what the research data are interpreted to indicate. 
As French and Bell (1978) have pointed out, action research came 
from two independent sources, one a person of action, John Col-
lier, who was commissioner of Indian Affairs from 1933 to 1945, the 
other a person of research, Kurt Lewin. Collier worked to bring about 

70 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
change in ethnic relations and was a strong advocate of conducting 
research to determine the “central areas of needed action” (Collier, 
1945).  He coined the label action research.  
 Although Lewin was an academic—a scholar, theoretician, and 
researcher—he was just as eminent a man of action (Marrow, 1969). 
Moreover, he pulled it all together when he stated that there is “no 
action without research, and no research without action” (Lewin, 
1946). Lewin and his colleagues and students conducted many action 
research projects in several different domains: community and racial 
relations, leadership, eating habits, and intergroup conflict. The action 
research project that is perhaps most relevant to OD was conducted 
by John R. P. French (a student of Lewin’s and subsequently a profes-
sor at the University of Michigan) and his  client, Lester Coch. Their 
famous study of workers’ resistance to change in a pajama factory not 
only illustrated action research at its best but provided the theoreti-
cal basis for what we now call participative management (Coch & 
French, 1948).  
 Wendell French (1969); Frohman, Sashkin, and Kavanagh 
(1976); and Schein (1980) made the action research model directly 
applicable and relevant to the OD process.  Figure  4.1 shows French’s 
adaptation.   
 Lewin’s Three-Step Procedure of Change  
 According to Lewin (1958), the first step in the process of change 
is  unfreezing the present level of behavior. To reduce prejudice, for 
example, the unfreezing step might be catharsis (Allport, 1945) or 
participation in a series of sensitivity training sessions (Rubin, 1967). 
For organizational change, the unfreezing step might be a series of 
management training sessions in which the objective for change was 
a more participative approach (Blake, Mouton, Barnes, & Greiner, 
1964; Shepard, 1960) or data feedback from a survey that showed 
serious problems in the managerial process of the organization 
(Bowers, 1973; Nadler, 1977). With respect to the  change at British 
Airways (BA) (see  Chapter  7 , “The Burke-Litwin Model of Organiza-
tional Performance and Change”), it was the double whammy of (1) 
Prime Minister Thatcher declaring that BA would become a private,

71
stock-owned, profit-making company and no longer a government 
agency and (2) the new CEO Colin Marshall’s reduction of the work-
force from 59,000 to 37,000. These kinds of actions do indeed get 
people’s attention and tend to unfreeze the system.  
 The second step,  movement, is to take action that will change the 
social system from its original level of behavior or operation to a new 
level. This action could be organization structuring (Foltz, Harvey, & 
McLaughlin, 1974), team development (Beckhard & Lake, 1971), or 
any number of what OD practitioners call interventions.

 The  refreezing step involves establishing a process that will make 
the new level of behavior “relatively secure against change” (Lewin, 
1958). Refreezing may include different conforming patterns, or new 

72 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
forms, such as collaboration rather than competition (Davis, 1967; 
Tannenbaum & Davis, 1969), a new approach to managing people 
(Marrow, Bowers, & Seashore, 1967; Seashore & Bowers, 1970), or a 
new reward system that will positively reinforce the desired behavior 
change (Lawler, 1977; Lawler & Worley, 2006; Burke, 2014b).  
 Thus, according to Lewin, bringing about lasting change means 
initially unlocking or unfreezing the present social system. This might 
require some kind of confrontation (Beckhard, 1967) or a process of 
reeducation. Next, behavioral movement must occur in the direc-
tion of desired change, such as a reorganization as in the BA story. 
Finally, deliberate steps must be taken to ensure that the new state 
of behavior remains relatively permanent. Changing the performance 
appraisal and reward systems at BA were the primary interventions to 
reinforce the new managerial behaviors (openness in communication, 
teamwork, trust building, etc.). These three steps are simple to  state 
but not simple to implement. Lippitt, Watson, and Westley (1958) 
and Schein and Bennis (1965; see especially  Chapter  10 in their book) 
have helped to clarify these steps by elaborating on them.  
 Schein’s Elaboration of Lewin’s Three-Stage 
Model  
 As Schein points out: “These stages overlap and may occur very 
rapidly, but they are conceptually distinct, and it is important for the 
helper [OD practitioner] to be aware of what stage he is working in” 
(Schein, 1987, p. 93).  
 Stage 1. Unfreezing: Creating Motivation and Readiness 
to Change  
 Schein describes three ways of unfreezing an organization: 
 
•   Disconfirmation or lack of confirmation.  Organizational mem-
bers are not likely to embrace change unless they experience 
some  need for it. Embracing change typically means that peo-
ple are dissatisfied with the way things are—quality is below 
standard, costs are too high, morale is too low, or direction is 
unclear, for example.  

 
CHAPTER  4 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT AS A PROCESS OF CHANGE  
73
 
•   Induction of guilt or anxiety.  This is a matter of establishing a 
gap between what is current but not working well and some 
future goal that would make things work better. When peo-
ple recognize a gap between what  is and what would be better 
and more desirable, they will be motivated via guilt or anxi-
ety to reduce the gap. But disconfirmation and induction are 
not enough to accomplish the unfreezing stage, according to 
Schein. One more process is necessary.  
 
•   Creation of psychological safety.   To face disconfirmation, expe-
rience guilt or anxiety, and be able to act or move, people must 
believe that moving will not bring them humiliation or loss of 
self-esteem. People must still feel worthy, psychologically safe. 
The consultant must therefore be concerned with people not 
losing face and must take care that when people admit that 
something is wrong, they will not be punished or humiliated.  
 Stage 2. Changing  
 This stage entails what Schein calls  cognitive restructuring; that 
is, helping people to see things differently and to react differently in 
the future. There are two main processes for accomplishing this stage:  
 
•  Identifying with a new role model, mentor, boss, or consultant 
to “begin to see things from that other person’s point of view. If 
we see another point of view operating in a person to whom we 
pay attention and respect, we can begin to imagine that point 
of view as something to consider for ourselves” (Schein, 1987, 
p. 105).  
 
•  Scanning the environment for new, relevant information. A 
brief, personal consulting example should help to clarify this 
point of Schein’s. In working with the chairman of a company 
and the president or CEO, the three of us explored many rea-
sons for their conflict with one another. To help with reduc-
ing some of this conflict, we worked hard on clarifying roles 
and responsibilities. In addition, the consultant (Burke) volun-
teered to bring to them other chairman-president/CEO models 
from other client organizations, some that worked very well and 

74 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
some that did not. This process was an activity of bringing to the 
two of  them new, relevant information that might help them 
move forward with the changes needed in the relationship.  
 Stage 3. Refreezing  
 This final stage is one of helping the client integrate the changes. 
Schein sees this stage in two parts—self and relations with others: 
 
•  Personal refreezing is the process of taking the new, changed 
way of doing things and making it fit comfortably into one’s 
total self-concept. This process involves a lot of practice—try-
ing out new roles and behaviors, getting feedback, and making 
adjustments until the new way of doing things feels reasonably 
comfortable.   
  
•  Relational refreezing is the process of assuring that the client’s 
new behavior will fit with significant others. In a system, when 
one begins to do things differently, will this difference quickly 
and, in any case, eventually affect others with whom the per-
son interacts? If you and I interact frequently and I change, 
to maintain the relationship you will have to change as well, 
at least to some extent to maintain the relationship. This pro-
cess involves openly engaging with others about the new way of 
doing things, to help them see why the change is better than the 
old way. The  process applies Stages 1 and 2 to others to get to 
Stage 3.      
 Phases of Planned Change  
 The Lippitt, Watson, and Westley (1958) model of planned 
change expands Lewin’s three steps to five phases. They use the 
word  phase deliberately because  step connotes a discrete action or 
event rather than the more likely reality, that step 1 has probably not 
been completed when step 2 is being taken, and so forth. The five 
phases are:  

 
CHAPTER  4 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT AS A PROCESS OF CHANGE  
75
  
1.  Development of a need for change (Lewin’s unfreezing) 
  
2.  Establishment of a change relationship 
  
3.  Working toward change (Lewin’s changing) 
  
4.  Generalization and stabilization of change (Lewin’s refreezing) 
  
5.  Achieving a terminal relationship 
 Lippitt, Watson, and Westley viewed the change process from the 
perspective of the change agent. Their concept of change agent is a 
professional, typically a behavioral scientist, who is external or inter-
nal to the organization involved in the change process. In OD terms, 
this person is the OD practitioner or consultant. Lippitt and his col-
leagues go on to state:  
 The decision to make a change may be made by the system 
itself, after experiencing pain (malfunctioning) or discovering 
the possibility of improvement, or by an outside change agent 
who observes the need for change in a particular system and 
takes the initiative in establishing a helping relationship with 
that system (Lippitt, Watson, & Westley, 1958, p.10).  
 With respect to Phase 1, development of a need for change, Lip-
pitt, Watson, and Westley suggest that the unfreezing occurs in one of 
three ways: (1) A change agent demonstrates the need by, for exam-
ple, presenting data from interviews that indicate a serious problem 
exists, (2) a third party sees a need and brings the change agent and 
the potential client system together, or (3) the client system becomes 
aware of its own need and seeks consultative help.  
 By establishment of a change relationship, Phase 2, the authors 
mean the development of a collaborative working effort between the 
change agent and the client system. Lippitt and his colleagues make 
an important point when they note that “often the client system seems 
to be seeking assurance that the potential change agent is different 
enough from the client system to be a real expert and yet enough like 
it to be thoroughly understandable and approachable” (p. 134). Strik-
ing this balance is critical to effective consultation in OD.  
 Most of their elaboration on Lewin’s three steps is in the moving 
phase, or, as Lippitt and his colleagues call it, working toward change. 
There are three subphases to this third major phase:  

76 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
  
1.  Clarification or diagnosis of the client system’s problem con-
sists primarily of the change agent’s collecting information and 
attempting to understand the system, particularly the problem 
areas.   
  
2.  Examination of alternative routes and goals involves establish-
ing goals and intentions of action and also includes determin-
ing the degree of motivation for change and the beginning of a 
process of focusing energy.  
  
3.  Transformation of intentions into actual change efforts is the 
 doing part—implementing a new organization structure, con-
ducting a specific training program, installing a new record sys-
tem, and the like.  
 Refreezing, or the generalization and stabilization of change, is 
the fourth major phase. The key activity in this phase is spreading 
the change to other parts of the total system. This phase also includes 
the establishment of mechanisms or activities that will maintain the 
momentum that was gathered during the previous phases. Lippitt and 
his colleagues call this a process of institutionalization. Hornstein, 
Bunker, Burke, Gindes, and Lewicki (1971) view this as both norma-
tive and structural support for the change. Normative support means 
that, in the refreezing phase, organization members are conforming 
to new norms. To ensure this form of institutionalization,  organiza-
tion members must be involved in planning and implementing the 
action steps for change. Involvement leads to commitment—in this 
case, commitment to new norms. Structural support may take the 
form of new organizational arrangements—that is, new reporting and 
accountability relationships, as reflected in a new organization chart—
or the placement of guardians of the new culture, the new conforming 
patterns. These guardians, or facilitators, of the new culture are peo-
ple whose job it is (1) to monitor the state of the organization’s effec-
tiveness, (2) to see that the information that is monitored is reported 
to the appropriate people in the organization,  (3) to provide help in 
understanding the information, especially in the diagnosis of prob-
lems, (4) to assist in the planning and implementation of action steps 
for further changes, and (5) to provide additional expertise in helping 
the organization to continue to change and renew where appropriate. 
Their primary responsibility, therefore, is to help regulate change as 

 
CHAPTER  4 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT AS A PROCESS OF CHANGE  
77
an organizational way of life. Hornstein and his colleagues go on to 
state:  
 Initially, this role is typically fulfilled by an outside consultant 
to the organization. Frequently, he attempts to work in con-
junction with some person (or persons) inside the organiza-
tion. If the internal person is not trained in OD, the external 
consultant will usually encourage the internal person(s) and 
other key individuals in the organization to develop their own 
resources in this area (Hornstein et al., 1971, p. 352).  
 In other words, the more the consultant can arrange for OD-
trained people to be permanent organization members, the more 
likely the initiated change is to last and become institutionalized as a 
way of life.  
 For the final phase, Lippitt and his colleagues argue for the 
achievement of a terminal relationship. What they mean is that the 
relationship between the change agent and the client must end. They 
contend that it is common for clients to become dependent on change 
agents and that change agents’ ultimate goal is to work themselves out 
of a job. The underlying value of this model for change is that it cre-
ates within the client system the expertise to solve its own problems in 
the future, at least those problems that fall within the same universe 
as the original change  problem.  
 Summary of Action Research Methodology  
 Lewin’s three-stage model has been a fundamental aspect of 
OD practice for a long time (Lewin, 1947). Most OD practitioners 
as a rule think and act according to these three steps or stages or 
phases. Remember they overlap and are therefore not discrete. More 
recently, there has been some criticism that Lewin’s model is no lon-
ger apropos and, for example, is a bit too simplified for modern times; 
see Dawson (1994), Hatch (1997), and Kanter, Stein, and Jick (1992). 
Bernard Burnes (2004), citing theory and evidence, has responded to 
these criticisms. He summarized the criticisms into four categories 
and responded  to each:  

78 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 
•   Criticism 1.   The three-step model is too simplistic and mecha-
nistic. Burnes’s response: Lewin did not view change as linear 
and unidimensional; social settings are in a state of constant 
change. So, Burnes’s response is that this criticism is a misread-
ing of Lewin’s ideas and theory.  
 
•   Criticism 2.   Lewin only addressed incremental and iso-
lated change projects, not transformational change. Burnes’s 
response: This criticism is more about speed than the scope 
of change. Moreover, incremental changes over time can lead 
to transformation. Because Lewin concentrated on behavioral 
change at all levels, individual, group, and organizational time 
and effort are required. The critics do seem to agree that trans-
formation occurs with structural and technical changes, which 
can be achieved fairly rapidly but not with cultural change 
requiring new behavior. The culture change at BA (see  Chapter 
 7 ), which was largely based on acquiring new behavior, took the 
better part of  five years.  
 
•   Criticism 3.  Lewin ignored issues of power and politics as 
well as conflict within organizations. Burnes’s response: He 
found this criticism strange. After all, Lewin was significantly 
involved in race relations, religious intolerance, value differ-
ences, problems of status and caste, economic discrimination, 
political leadership, and leadership in general. And as Burnes 
points out, the original treatise on the bases of social power was 
written by French and Raven (1959). French was a student of 
Lewin’s and the same French of Coch and French (1948) and 
Raven, a social psychologist, was highly influenced by Lewin’s 
theory and research (Raven, 1993).  
 
•   Criticism 4.  Lewin was an advocate of top-down, management-
driven approaches to change and essentially ignored bottom-up 
change. Burnes’s response: Actually, Lewin’s sympathies were 
obviously with the underdog, the disadvantaged and those who 
were discriminated against. Lewin worked with a wide range 
of groups and organizations and he consistently emphasized 
learning and participation of everyone concerned.

 Burnes concludes that these four criticisms are for the most part 
unwarranted. There is little substantiation to support them. His fur-
ther conclusion, which captures much of the man, Lewin, and his 
contributions, are best conveyed in Burnes’s own words:  
 Looking at Lewin’s contribution to change theory and prac-
tice, there are three key points to note. The first is that 
Lewin’s work stemmed from his concern to find an effective 
approach to resolving social conflict through changing group 
behavior (whether these conflicts be at the group, organiza-
tional or societal level). The second point is to recognize that 
Lewin promoted an ethical and humanist approach to change, 
that saw learning and involvement as being the key processes 
for achieving behavioural change. This was for two reasons: 
(a) he saw this approach as helping to develop and strengthen 
democratic values in society  as a whole and thus acting as a 
buffer against the racism and totalitarianism which so domi-
nated events in his lifetime; (b) based on his background in 
Gestalt psychology and his own research, he saw this approach 
as being the most effective in bringing about sustained behav-
ioural change. The last point concerns the nature of Lewin’s 
work. Lewin’s Planned approach to change is based on four 
mutually-reinforcing concepts, namely Field Theory, Group 
Dynamics, Action Research and the 3-Step model, which are 
used in combination to bring about effective change. His crit-
ics, though, tend to treat these as separate and independent 
elements  of Lewin’s work and, in the main, concentrate on his 
3-Step model of change. When seen in isolation, the 3-Step 
model can be portrayed as simplistic. When seen alongside 
the other elements of Lewin’s Planned approach, it becomes 
a much more robust approach to change (Burnes, 2004, 
pp. 995–996).    
 The Generic Model for Organizational Change  
 The four models covered so far in this chapter—action research; 
Lewin’s three steps of unfreezing, moving, and refreezing; Schein’s 
elaboration of Lewin’s three stages; and Lippitt, Watson, and 

80 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
Westley’s five phases of planned change—are all part of a generic 
model for bringing about organizational change. This is not acciden-
tal, of course, because all four models are based on the original think-
ing of Kurt Lewin.  
 The generic model might be described as a process by which a 
consultant collects information about the nature of an organization 
(the research) and then helps the organization to change by way of a 
sequence of phases that involve those who are directly affected—the 
organization members themselves. This more general model consists 
of the following elements:  
  
1.  An outside consultant or change agent 
  
2.  The gathering of information (data) from the client system by 
the consultant for purposes of understanding more about the 
inherent nature of the system, determining major domains in 
need of change (problems), and reporting this information back 
to the client system so that appropriate action can be taken  
  
3.  Collaborative planning between the consultant and the client 
system for purposes of change (action)  
  
4.  Implementation of the planned change, which is based on valid 
information (data) and is conducted by the client system, with 
the continuing help of the consultant  
  
5.  Institutionalization of the change 
 To summarize and integrate the four models of change that we 
have considered thus far,  Figure  4.2 shows a comparison of Lewin’s 
(1958) three steps; the action research model provided by Wendell 
French (1969) and Schein (1980, 1987); and Lippitt, Watson, and 
Westley’s (1958) phases of planned change. As shown in the figure, 
the action research model for OD is the main reference point for 
comparison.  
 It should be noted that earlier thinking about planned change, 
especially Lippitt et al. (1958) emphasized the role of the change 
agent as data collector, data interpreter, feedback provider, and so on. 
The change agent was depicted as doing practically everything. Cur-
rent practice of OD emphasizes the role of the practitioner more in 
terms of  facilitation, helping the client to do many of these activities 
themselves (Schein, 1987). Organizational development consulting is

distinct in this regard from management consulting, where the con-
sultant usually does all of this work for the client.

 Even though we have labeled this section “the generic model,” 
it may not be. Organization change is sufficiently complex that no 
generic model may yet exist. In any case, it is quite appropriate to 

82 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
refer to another model that has been given the label of generic. The 
difference is that what we have called generic encompasses diagnosis 
and intervention whereas the one we are now referring to is labeled 
by its authors as a “generic model of intervention” (Bushe & Shani, 
1991).  
 Building on the earlier work of Howard Carlson at General 
Motors (Miller, 1978) and Zand (1974), Bushe and Shani make the 
argument, with case examples to support their points, that (1) bureau-
cracy remains as powerful and influential as ever as a primary way for 
organizational functioning (or nonfunctioning as the case may be), 
and therefore (2) parallel structures are required for innovation and 
change in large, complex bureaucracies. Galbraith (1982), using simi-
lar arguments, has also suggested alternative structures for innova-
tion. These parallel learning structures, as Bushe and Shani refer to 
them, are used typically temporarily to overcome the limitations of 
bureaucracy. Bushe and Shani describe eight phases, which are simi-
lar to those of Kolb and Frohman (1970) and to the phases described 
later in this chapter.  
 While focusing primarily on the intervention aspect of change, 
these ideas of Bushe and Shani are sufficiently broad and applicable 
to be worthy of the label  generic. 
 Now we shall consider a case that should help to understand how 
these models of action research—including principles applied by 
Bushe and Shani, and Lewin’s three stages incorporating the elabora-
tions of Schein and Lippitt et al.—are applied in an actual OD con-
sulting example.  
 Practicing OD: A Case History  
 The action research model and the phases of planned change 
provide the framework for OD practice. We shall consider in more 
specificity these practice phases, but first let us consider an actual 
case of OD consultation that should help our later understanding of 
the phases of OD practice.  
 I (Burke) was contacted initially by Carol, the manager of human 
resources for a regional division of a large, international financial 

 
CHAPTER  4 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT AS A PROCESS OF CHANGE  
83
corporation. She reported directly to Ron, the regional manager. 
Carol called me because I had previously consulted with other divi-
sions of the corporation and was therefore familiar with their busi-
ness. She also told me that she had sought advice from others in the 
corporation and that I had been recommended. She explained that 
Ron was new in his position as regional manager and was anxious to 
make some changes. He was considering an off-site meeting with his 
senior management  group and believed that an outside consultant 
might be helpful, Carol then asked if I would be interested and, if so, 
if we could have lunch together soon to explore the matter.  
 Exploration  
 At the lunch meeting a few days later, Carol and I asked each 
other many questions. She was interested in what I had done before, 
how I liked to work, what I might do or suggest if such and such were 
to happen, what I knew about her company’s business, and whether 
I would be interested in continuing to consult with them if the ini-
tial effort went well. I asked her such questions as why the business 
had lost money four years in a row; what Ron’s predecessor was like; 
what Ron was like—his managerial style; his previous job history;  how 
people in the region, especially the senior management group, felt 
about him, and whether any of the others thought they should have 
become the new regional manager instead of Ron; how the senior 
management group worked together—if off-site meetings were com-
mon occurrences; and so forth. Toward the end of our exploratory 
discussion, Carol explained that she needed to talk further with Ron 
and that she would be in touch with me again soon.  
 Meeting with Ron  
 The following week, Carol called to schedule a meeting for me 
with Ron. In my meeting with Ron, it was soon clear to me that he 
trusted Carol a great deal. He was essentially sold on me, and all we 
needed to do was to discuss details. He explained that, although he 
had been in the region for more than three years as head of consumer 
services, he had only been regional manager for a month. He felt 

84 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
pressure from higher management to make the region profitable, and 
he reasoned that he must have his senior management group solidly 
with  him in order to “turn the region around.” He further stated that 
he wanted to have an off-site meeting with his senior management 
group to establish two-year profit goals, to develop an overall regional 
business strategy, and to begin the process of building a senior man-
agement  team. 
 I explained that I would like to conduct individual interviews with 
the members of his senior management group, including himself, 
determine if they thought an off-site meeting was appropriate, sum-
marize and analyze the information from the interviews, meet with 
him again to go over the data, plan the meeting (if warranted), and 
clarify our respective roles—that he would lead the meeting and I 
would help. In OD language, my role would be a facilitating one.  
 Agreement  
 We reached agreement concerning what Ron wanted and how I 
wanted to proceed. This verbal agreement was followed a few days 
later with an exchange of letters to confirm our agreement in writing.  
 Interviews  
 Over a one-week period, I conducted one-hour interviews with 
each member of the senior management group. This group is depicted 
in the chart shown in  Figure  4.3 . I explained to each manager that the 
interview would be confidential and that only a summary of the inter-
views in aggregate form would become public.  
 Although I asked many questions in each interview, I asked four 
general questions of everyone:  
  
1.  What are the strengths of the region? 
  
2.  What are the weaknesses of the region? 
  
3.  Are you in favor of the off-site meeting? 
  
4.  What should be the objective of the off-site meeting?

 The interviews went well. All the managers were cooperative and 
expressed themselves openly and candidly, and I took many notes.  
 Summary and Analysis of Interviews  
 Although some of the managers thought the off-site meeting was 
somewhat premature because Ron had only been in his position for 
one month, others believed that the timing was right. Regardless of 
the timing, however, all thought an off-site meeting was a good idea. 
Thus, the summary of my interviews was categorized according to the 
three other questions—strengths and weaknesses of the region and 
objectives of the off-site meeting.  Table  4.1 provides a partial listing 
of some of the major points of the interviews. As is typical for such 
an activity, the weaknesses listed outnumbered the strengths. People, 
especially managers, tend  to focus more on problems than on what is 
going well or is positive for the organization.

CHAPTER  4 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT AS A PROCESS OF CHANGE  
87
 Some general problems in the region became clear to me as a 
result of the interviews. Although the group believed that they were 
highly knowledgeable and experienced in their business, they recog-
nized that remaining unprofitable was not going to get them to where 
they wanted to go, especially in their individual careers. There was 
also a conflict over whether theirs was a marketing and sales organiza-
tion or a consumer services organization. Actually, it had to be both, 
but, from the standpoint of strategy and with respect to individuals’ 
roles and responsibilities in lower levels of management, there was 
considerable ambiguity.  This ambiguity contributed to problems of 
priorities, numbers 2 and 3 in the list of weaknesses. The emphasis 
on structure and financial objectives was therefore appropriate in the 
major objectives for the off-site meeting.  
 Planning for the Off-Site Meeting  
 Ron and I met before the off-site meeting to go over my summary 
and analysis of the interview information and to plan the meeting. I 
gave him the summary and analysis of the interviews just as I would 
later give it to the entire group. Thus, Ron received the same infor-
mation but received it earlier. The purposes of this advance notice 
were (1) to use the information as a basis for planning an agenda for 
the meeting and (2) to allow Ron to have time to understand and 
react to the information before the meeting. Ron would then have an  
opportunity to discuss his reactions to the information, particularly his 
feelings so that if he felt defensive, for example, he could talk about 
it with me and not be as defensive during the meeting. In such situa-
tions, especially if it is the first time, bosses frequently receive more 
criticism for problems than any other member of the group. Even if 
interview comments are not specifically directed at the bosses, they 
may feel responsible and accountable for the problems because of 
their positions, regardless of where the actual causes may lie. In Ron’s 
case, he was not angry and he was  not particularly defensive. He didn’t 
think he had contributed to the weaknesses and problems any more 
than anyone else had. If he had been regional manager longer than 
a month, of course, his feelings may have been different. Ron was 
pleased with his group’s openness and accuracy regarding the issues, 
and he was enthusiastic about the upcoming meeting.  

88 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Our plan for the meeting was simple and straightforward. We 
wanted as little interference and distraction as possible, so we would 
hold the meeting at a hotel-resort that was fairly remote yet comfort-
able. The site was less than two hours away from the region’s head-
quarters by automobile, and it met our criteria. Regarding the agenda, 
we planned to begin at 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday. Ron would open the 
meeting with a statement of his goals and expectations regarding the 
meeting, and I would follow with a summary of the interviews. The 
group would then have a chance to react to and discuss the interview 
summary. Before dinner, Ron would present some financial data that 
would show clearly how the region compared with the other regions 
(they were close to the bottom), and after some discussion we would 
eat dinner together as a group. Thursday morning would be devoted 
to setting a two-year profit goal and to establishing priorities among 
the many objectives. Thursday afternoon we would discuss potential 
obstacles to reaching the profit goal and to realizing some of the more 
specific objectives of the region, such as clarifying their objectives 
regarding the balance of marketing versus service. Friday morning  
we would discuss an overall strategy that would incorporate the profit 
goal and these objectives, and Friday afternoon would be devoted to 
a summary of the meeting, to members’ reactions to and critique of 
the meeting, and to a discussion of the specific plans for follow-up.  
 The Off-Site Meeting  
 The meeting proceeded essentially as planned. We took a two-
hour break for lunch and some physical recreation in the middle of 
the day on Thursday and then worked from 2:00 p.m. to about 7:00 
p.m. On Friday, we had a quick lunch and continued to work until 
about 3:00 p.m., when we adjourned. This was somewhat short for 
such a meeting, but adequate. During the summary and critique of 
the meeting, I also participated, giving my observations of them as a 
group and making suggestions about how they could improve their 
work together as a team. Everyone considered the meeting to have 
been worthwhile and useful, and Ron was particularly pleased. He 
believed that the formation of a team, as opposed to an administrative 
aggregate of senior managers, had begun, and I agreed.  

 
CHAPTER  4 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT AS A PROCESS OF CHANGE  
89
 After the Off-Site Meeting  
 A few weeks after the meeting, Ron and I met again and agreed 
on a plan for my continued consultation. Some of the changes I 
helped to make were (1) installation of a planning function reporting 
directly to Ron; (2) reorganization of the consumer services area, par-
ticularly regarding the functions of marketing and sales as they related 
to service (an off-site meeting with the head of consumer services and 
his management group was part of the planning for these changes); 
(3) modifications in the reward and performance-appraisal processes 
of the region (I worked with Carol in this area); and (4)  development 
of the senior management group into more of a team. Eventually, 
though certainly not overnight, the profit picture for the region began 
to change, and they did indeed move from the red to the black.  
 Now that we have the case as an illustration of OD consultation, 
let us reconsider the steps I took so that we can translate the activities 
into OD language and understand more thoroughly the concepts and 
principles of this kind of consultation.  
 Phases of OD Practice  
 Based on the Lewinian concepts of unfreezing, changing, and 
refreezing and on Lippitt, Watson, and Westley’s (1958) phases of 
planned change, as well as Schein’s (1987), but oriented more specifi-
cally to current OD practice, Kolb and Frohman (1970) give seven 
phases to be followed in an OD consultation: scouting, entry, diag-
nosis, planning, action, evaluation, and termination. I have modified 
their list by putting scouting and entry together, separating contract-
ing and feedback into distinct phases, using intervention instead of 
action, and eliminating termination. What Kolb and Frohman call 
 scouting, I call  entry, and I consider  contracting a more appropriate 
term for what they label  as  entry. Our differences are simply in labels 
and emphasis; the overall process is the same, except for termination, 
which I will explain later. Thus, my seven phases are as follows:  
  
1.  Entry 
  
2.  Contracting 
  
3.  Diagnosis 

90 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
  
4.  Feedback 
  
5.  Planning change 
  
6.  Intervention 
  
7.  Evaluation 
 We shall consider each of these phases in turn, using the case to 
illustrate the characteristics of OD consultation.  
 Entry 
 Contact between the consultant and client is what initiates the 
entry phase. This contact may result from either the client’s calling 
the consultant for an exploratory discussion about the possibility of an 
OD effort, as in the case example, or from the consultant’s suggesting 
to the client that such an effort might be worthwhile. For an external 
consultant, the contact is likely to result from the client’s initiative. 
For an internal consultant, either mode could occur. Internal con-
sultants, being employees, typically feel some commitment to their 
organizations, or it may be part of their job descriptions to call on 
managers  in the organization and suggest preliminary steps that might 
lead to an OD effort. Internal consultants also may have experienced 
success with organization development in one subsystem and may 
wish to spread this effect further within the organization. Initiating 
contacts with clients therefore comes naturally for internal OD practi-
tioners, and there is certainly more opportunity for informal contacts 
to occur—at lunch, at committee meetings, and so forth—when ques-
tions can be asked and suggestions explored.  
 After the contact, the consultant and the client begin the process 
of  exploring with one another the possibilities of a working relation-
ship. The client is usually assessing whether he or she can relate well 
with the consultant, whether the consultant’s previous experience 
is applicable to the present situation, and whether the consultant is 
competent and can be trusted.  
 My lunch meeting with Carol served as the beginning of the 
exploration process. I repeated the process with Ron, the regional 
manager, but this second round was rapid because it had already been 
facilitated by Carol’s previous meeting with and assessment of me.  

 
CHAPTER  4 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT AS A PROCESS OF CHANGE  
91
 During the exploration process, the consultant is assessing (1) the 
probability of relating well with the client, (2) the motivation and val-
ues of the client, (3) the client’s readiness for change, (4) the extent 
of resources for supporting a change effort, and (5) potential leverage 
points for change—whether the client has the power to make deci-
sions that will lead to change or whether higher authority must be 
sought. In my conversation with Ron, I became satisfied that he was 
motivated and ready for change, that he had the resources, and that 
he had the leverage—enough autonomy to take considerable action  
without getting approval from higher management.  
 There are additional criteria and ways of determining a client’s 
readiness for change. Pfeiffer and Jones (1978), for example, have 
developed a useful 15-item checklist for such a determination. They 
urge the consultant to check, among others, such things as flexibility 
of top management, possible labor contract limitations (which could 
be crucial if job enrichment, for example, were a potential interven-
tion), any previous experience the organization may have had with OD 
(or what some may have called OD, regardless of what the activities 
were), structural flexibility with respect to the organization’s design, 
and the interpersonal skills of those who would  be involved. 
 Contracting  
 Assuming that the mutual explorations of the consultant and the 
client in the entry phase progress satisfactorily, the next phase in 
the process is negotiating a contract. If the entry process has gone 
smoothly, the contracting phase is likely to be brief. The contract is 
essentially a statement of agreement that succinctly clarifies what the 
consultant agrees to do. If it is done thoroughly, the contract will also 
state what the client intends to do. The contract may be nothing more 
than a verbal agreement, with a handshake, perhaps, or it may be 
a formal document, with notarized signatures. Most often, the con-
tract is considerably more informal than the latter extreme, typically 
involving an exchange of letters between the two parties.  
 Unlike other types of contracts, the OD contract states more 
about process than about content. According to Weisbord (1973), it is 

92 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 an explicit exchange of expectations...which clarifies for con-
sultant and client three critical areas:  
  
1.  What each expects to get from the relationship; 
  
2.  How much time each will invest, when, and at what cost; 
  
3.  The ground rules under which the parties will operate (p. 1). 
 My contract with Ron was fairly straightforward. The letters we 
exchanged simply confirmed in writing what we had agreed to in our 
meeting. The letters summarized what I would do and some of what 
he planned to do. The case as I described it was indeed the imple-
mentation of our contract.  
 When we met after the off-site meeting, Ron and I agreed on a 
further contract, which was also confirmed in an exchange of letters.  
 It is a good practice in OD consultation to renew or renegoti-
ate the contract periodically. In my consultation with Ron, the sec-
ond contract was essentially an extension of the first, occurring about 
three months after the earlier one. The timing of the renewal or rene-
gotiation is not as important as seeing that this phase is periodically 
repeated. It is also a good practice to have the agreement in writing. 
Although an exchange of letters may not necessarily constitute a legal 
document, the written word usually helps to avoid misunderstandings.  
 Diagnosis  
 There are two steps within the diagnostic phase: gathering infor-
mation and analyzing it. Diagnosis has usually begun even at the entry 
phase—if the consultant is alert. How the client reacts to the pos-
sibility of change at the outset may tell a great deal not only about 
the client as an individual, but also about the part of the organiza-
tion’s culture that he or she represents. Initially, therefore, informa-
tion gathering is accomplished through the consultant’s observations, 
intuitions, and feelings. Later, more systematic methods are used, 
such as structured interviews, questionnaires, and summaries of such 
organizational documents as performance records and task  force 
reports. Once the data are collected, the consultant must then put all 
the varieties of information together, summarize all the information 

 
CHAPTER  4 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT AS A PROCESS OF CHANGE  
93
without losing critical pieces, and finally organize the information so 
that the client can easily understand it and be able to work with it so 
that appropriate action can be taken.  
 As we shall see in the next chapter, there are several models to 
help the consultant with both steps of the diagnostic phase: knowing 
 what information to seek and knowing  how to analyze and interpret 
the information.  
 In my initial work with Ron and his management group, I relied 
on three methods of data gathering: interviews, my observations, and 
my reading of two documents—one concerning Ron’s thinking about 
long-range planning and another that summarized the issues regard-
ing the problem of marketing versus service orientation.  
 My diagnosis consisted of (1) summarizing the data according to 
the categories of the interview questions (see  Table  4.1 ) and elaborat-
ing on what the interviewees had said and (2) drawing certain conclu-
sions from the combination of my observations and some relationships 
I perceived in the interview results.  
 Feedback  
 How effectively the consultant has summarized and analyzed the 
diagnostic information will determine the success of the feedback 
phase to a significant extent. This phase consists of holding meetings 
with the client system—usually first with the boss alone and then with 
the entire group from whom the data were collected. The size of the 
group would determine the number of feedback sessions to be held. 
If the client system consisted of a manager and his or her immedi-
ate subordinates only, then two sessions would be required, one with 
the manager alone and the second with the entire group, including 
the  manager. If more than these two levels of the overall managerial 
hierarchy were included—for example, four levels of management, 
involving 30 or more people—then as many as four or five feedback 
sessions may be necessary. A feedback session should allow for ample 
discussion and debate, and a small group that does not involve mul-
tiple levels of management is best for such purposes.  
 A feedback session generally has three steps. First, the consul-
tant provides a summary of the data collected and some preliminary 

94 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
analysis. Next, there is a general discussion in which questions of 
clarification are raised and answered. Finally, some time is devoted 
to interpretation. At this stage, some changes may be made in the 
consultant’s analysis and interpretation. Thus, the consultant works 
collaboratively with the client group to arrive at a final diagnosis that 
accurately describes the current state of the system.  
 In my work with Ron and his management team, I followed essen-
tially the steps I’ve just outlined. The feedback phase consisted, first, 
of our discussion of the interview results early in the off-site meet-
ing. Toward the end of the meeting, I provided additional feedback, 
which was a combination of my observations of the group as they 
worked together for two days and my further analysis of the inter-
view data. I told them, for example, that I had observed that their 
competition with one another, a weakness some of them had identi-
fied, conformed to a particular norm. The norm seemed to be: “Let’s 
see who among us can best identify and analyze our problems and 
weaknesses as a region.” Everyone tackled every issue and problem, 
and it appeared that winning the game of “best analysis” was critical 
to all. My diagnosis, with which they agreed, was based in a social-
psychological frame of reference and was particularly related to the 
concept of norm.  
 Planning Change  
 The planning phase sometimes becomes the second half of the 
feedback session, as happened with Ron and his team. Once the diag-
nosis was understood and deemed accurate, action steps were planned 
immediately. It has been noted that a good diagnosis determines the 
intervention. The only required planning may be the implementation 
steps—what to do. The more complex the diagnosis or the larger the 
client system, however, the more likely it is that the planning phase 
becomes a later event, following the feedback sessions. It may be 
best generally to allow some time to pass between feedback and plan-
ning—a few days,  perhaps, but probably no more than a week. This 
passage of time might allow the feedback to sink in and would create 
an opportunity for more thought to be given to the planning process.  
 The purposes of this planning phase are to generate alternative 
steps for responding correctively to the problems identified in the 

 
CHAPTER  4 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT AS A PROCESS OF CHANGE  
95
diagnosis, and to decide on the step or order of steps to take. The OD 
practitioner again works collaboratively with the client system during 
this phase, primarily by helping to generate and explore the conse-
quences of alternative action steps. The final decision of what steps to 
take is the client’s, not the consultant’s.  
 Intervention  
 The intervention phase consists of the action taken. The pos-
sibilities are numerous, and the selected interventions should be a 
direct reflection of and response to the diagnosis. Some examples of 
interventions at the individual level are job redesign and enrichment, 
training and management development, changes in the quality of 
working life, management by objectives, and career development. At 
the group level, interventions might include team building, the instal-
lation of autonomous work groups or quality control circles. Resolving 
intergroup conflict might be an intervention, as might changing such 
structural dimensions of the organization as reporting relationships, 
moving toward or away from  decentralization of authority, modifying 
physical settings, or creating informal structures in the organization.  
 The interventions used in Ron’s region were team building, pro-
cess consultation, some minor structural changes, career develop-
ment, and a change in the region’s reward system by installation of a 
bonus plan for managers.  
 Whatever the intervention might be, the OD practitioner contin-
ues to work with the client system to help make the intervention suc-
cessful. As Kolb and Frohman (1970) point out: “the failure of most 
plans lies in the unanticipated consequences of the change effort” 
(p. 60). The OD consultant’s job is to help the client anticipate and 
plan for the unanticipated consequences.  
 Evaluation  
 It is usually best for someone other than the consultant to con-
duct an evaluation of any OD effort. The consultant cannot be totally 
objective, and it is difficult to concentrate on what needs changing 
and on evaluating its success at the same time (Lewicki & Alderfer, 
1973).  

96 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 The mode of evaluation may range from clients saying that they 
are pleased with the outcome to a systematic research effort employ-
ing controls and multiple data analyses. A more objective and system-
atic evaluation is obviously better, at least for determining cause and 
effect. It is difficult to do a highly scientific evaluation of OD efforts. 
The main problem, of course, is control; it is almost impossible to 
have a proper control group for comparison. Furthermore, the client 
is usually more interested in taking action that will pay off than in 
objectively determining whether the action results were attributable 
to the  OD intervention. What is important to the client is whether the 
action taken was successful according to the organization’s usual stan-
dards—profits, reduction of costs, or higher performance in general; 
what  caused the success is less important. This was essentially the case 
with Ron and his region, and so no formal evaluation was conducted. 
Evaluation did occur, however, as I periodically checked and asked 
for feedback, and the profit results, although they did not necessarily 
prove a cause-effect relationship, were sufficient evaluation in this 
case.  
 Regardless of its form or index, evaluation is very important 
because the process usually reinforces the change effort, and it is a 
primary way to learn about the consequences of our actions.  
 In  Chapters  8 and  9 , “Understanding Organizations: Covert Pro-
cesses” and “Planning and Managing Change,” respectively, we shall 
consider evaluation again. It should be clear that some form of evalua-
tion is a critical part in the OD process. Although the evaluative effort 
does not have to meet all the standards of rigorous research and the 
scientific method, it must at least provide adequate data for making 
reasonable decisions regarding further changes.  
 Termination of the OD Effort  
 The foregoing seven phases constitute what I consider the pri-
mary, sequential actions a practitioner takes in an organization devel-
opment effort. My list differs slightly in emphasis and labels from the 
earlier list of Kolb and Frohman (1970), but the phases are essen-
tially the same, with one exception: Kolb and Frohman’s termina-
tion phase. They argue that “the consultant-client relationship is by 

 
CHAPTER  4 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT AS A PROCESS OF CHANGE  
97
definition temporary” (1970, p. 61), that the effort either succeeds or 
fails. If it fails, termination is abrupt; if it is successful and the goals 
are reached, the consultant may not leave so abruptly, but the rela-
tionship terminates because there  is no further need for consultative 
help. It should be noted that Kolb and Frohman’s seventh step is 
consistent with the phases of planned change delineated earlier by 
Lippitt, Watson, and Westley (1958).  
 I do not include termination in my list of phases for three reasons. 
First, termination is not an applicable phase for internal OD practi-
tioners. Although they may conclude specific programs and projects 
with their clients, they should not terminate the relationship. A pri-
mary role of internal practitioners is to serve as guardians of the new 
culture. They help to regulate the social change that has become a 
new routine in organizational life (Hornstein et al., 1971). This regu-
lation may take a variety of forms, ranging from periodic checks with 
client managers regarding the continuing effectiveness of changes to 
more systematic  follow-up activities, such as conducting annual sur-
veys, attending a manager’s staff meetings as a process consultant, or 
helping to design and conduct off-site planning or diagnostic meet-
ings for departments or divisions.  
 The second reason concerns external OD consultants. A termina-
tion phase is and should be more common for external consultants 
than for internal ones, but it is not necessarily a requirement for effec-
tive consultation. A major goal of an external OD consultant is to see 
that internal resources are established for the kind of help he or she 
is providing. As soon as possible, internal practitioners should begin 
to take over the work the external consultant initiates. Thus, although 
the external consultant’s activities with the client organization may 
decrease, they do not necessarily have to be terminated. Kolb and 
Frohman’s argument  for termination is to prevent the client from 
becoming dependent on the consultant. As an external consultant, 
I have had long-standing relationships with some clients, but I have 
never felt them to be too dependent on me. Although dependency 
may occur as a problem in personal therapy, it rarely becomes an 
issue in consultation with organizations. I know of consultant-client 
relationships that have continued for more than a decade, and I con-
sider them healthy and useful for both parties. An organization has a 

98 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
constant need for periodic, objective diagnostic checkups by external 
consultants—a need that exists, incidentally, whether or not  the orga-
nization’s managers see it.  
 Finally, I do not think a termination phase is appropriate because 
when OD practitioners follow the action research model, they nat-
urally generate new data for further diagnosis and action. The pro-
cess is cyclical (French, 1969), and because an organization is both 
dynamic and naturally follows the entropic process, there is always a 
great deal of consultative work to be done. For further elaboration of 
these three reasons, see Van Eron and Burke (1992).  
 Phases, Not Steps  
 Phases is a more appropriate term than  steps for describing the 
flow of events in OD work.  Steps implies discrete actions, whereas 
 phases better connotes the reality of OD practice—a cycle of changes. 
Although it is useful for our understanding of OD practice to conceive 
of distinct phases, in actual practice they blend, overlap, and do not 
always follow one from the other. Diagnosis, for example, comes early 
in the OD process and intervention later, but when one is collecting 
information from the organization for diagnostic purposes, an inter-
vention is occurring simultaneously; when the OD practitioner begins 
to ask questions about the organization and  its members, he or she is 
intervening.  
 Phases is an appropriate term also because of the cyclical nature 
of the OD process. As the process continues, new or undisclosed data 
are discovered. These data affect organization members, and the 
members react, creating additional information for diagnosis. Further 
action is then planned as a consequence of the new, perhaps more 
refined diagnosis.  
 Another implication of the cyclical nature of OD relates to the 
characteristics of open social systems, as delineated by Katz and 
Kahn (1978). Two of these characteristics are relevant—the notion 
that organizations proceed through cycles of events over time and 
the notion that systems seek equilibrium. The first characteristic, that 
organizational life runs in cycles, is precisely the reason that OD is 
cyclical. Because organizations are cyclical, OD must also be in order 

 
CHAPTER  4 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT AS A PROCESS OF CHANGE  
99
to respond in an appropriate and timely manner. Major events in 
organizations—planning, budgeting, quarterly reports—are repeated 
over time; as these events are repeated, new data are likely  to be 
generated each time. Two quarterly reports are rarely the same, and 
plans and budgets change continuously. Consequently, the diagnosis 
of an organization in December will be at least somewhat different 
from the diagnosis conducted the previous June—significantly differ-
ent if a significant intervention has occurred during the intervening 
six months. If things in the organization are significantly different six 
months later, and if these differences are disturbing to organization 
members, they will seek equilibrium—back to the former state. Orga-
nization development involves change. When change occurs in one of 
the organization’s components or subsystems, other subsystems act 
to restore the  balance. Pressure is brought to bear on organizational 
behavior that is different from the norm of the organization’s culture 
as it has evolved. Thus, in OD practice, for change to last, recurring 
diagnoses must be undertaken to determine the state of earlier inter-
ventions, and further actions (interventions) are usually needed to 
reinforce the new behaviors. The long-run objective is to institution-
alize the change so that possibilities of changing the OD change will 
be resisted within the normal pattern of open-system life—equilib-
rium seeking.     
 Conclusion  
 This chapter considered the four background models for any OD 
effort and the seven primary phases of OD consultation using a case 
to illustrate the phases. Although it is instructive to consider these 
phases—entry, contracting, diagnosis, feedback, planning change, 
intervention, and evaluation—as discrete steps, and although the 
consultative flow of events essentially follows the order of the seven 
phases, in practice the phases are not discrete; they blend together 
and overlap. When the consultant enters the client organization to col-
lect information (by interviews, questionnaires, or observations), the 
intervention phase, sixth in the ordered group of seven, has already 
begun, and  although evaluation is listed as last, it begins at the entry 
stage as far as the client is concerned.  

100 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 These phases are therefore guides for OD consultation. They 
are highly useful for planning and for ordering sequences of activi-
ties and events, but they should not be considered as discrete, rigid 
steps to follow or as the only phases of consultation in organization 
development.  
 Finally, it should be remembered that these guides help to 
accomplish primary objectives of any OD effort. That is, as OD prac-
titioners, we are concerned with (1) providing people with choices, so 
that their feelings of freedom will not be unduly curtailed and thus 
their resistance will be minimized and (2) involving people at some 
level of participative decision making and communication regarding 
the direction of organizational change, so that commitment to change 
implementation will be enhanced. Although we have used slightly 
different language with this closing statement, we are meaning the 
same as Argyris (1970) when he describes his  criteria for an effective 
intervention.

provided a more recent elaboration. We shall cover his version as well.

 Defining the Client: 
A Different Perspective  
 Over the many years of my work in organization development 
(OD), I (Burke) have overheard or taken part in numerous discus-
sions about “Who is the client?” Is the client the head person, the 
boss, a particular unit or group, or the total system? In these discus-
sions, OD practitioners have identified at least one of the above.  
 Let me be concrete by using an actual case, a consulting project 
of mine a few years ago, with a small, highly technical company, a 
subsidiary of a large corporation. I was introduced to the president by 
an employee relations person to explore the possibility of working 
with the company. Contracting with the president and later with his 
top group went fairly smoothly. After some interviewing and observ-
ing, I was soon able to provide them with some preliminary feedback. 
Although the employee relations person did not accompany me dur-
ing this early stage, at my request he became my internal counterpart  
as I began to move downward through the organization.  
 I looked forward to this consulting project because I had rarely 
worked with an organization so small—about 90 employees—and so 
interesting scientifically and technically. (The firm was developing 
commercial lasers.) In short, this was an organization of a size that I 
believed I could “get my arms around” and one that seemed to be on 
the verge of exciting technical advances.  
 The top management group was relatively small, consisting of five 
persons, including the president (see  Figure  5.1 ). Most of the staff 
was located in operations, which consisted of both manufacturing and 
marketing/sales. At least a third of my consulting effort was within this 
unit of the company.

 Now to the central question: Who is my client? Answer by 
responding to the following multiple-choice question:  
 The client is which of the following? 
  
a.  Company president 
  
b.  Top management group 
  
c.  Employee relations person 
  
d.  Total company 
  
e.  Parent corporation 
  
f.  All of the above 
  
g.  None of the above 

 
CHAPTER  5 • DEFINING THE CLIENT: A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE  
103
 To be  au courant , you would choose either (d) or (f). After all, OD 
is a total system approach to planned change that starts from the top. 
My contracting, however, was done first with the president and next 
with his immediate reports as a group. Perhaps a better answer is (a) 
or maybe (b). But what about the employee relations person? My 
coming in was originally his idea and he paved the way. Also, he later 
was very much involved in my efforts. Alternative (c) may be the best 
answer. But what about the parent company? Was I not really serving 
them? The president of the parent company was chairman of the 
board of the subsidiary. Although he was not the subsidiary’s CEO, he 
was nevertheless clearly in a position of authority. Maybe (e) is the 
best reply. These answers all seem reasonable. Thus, the safest alter-
native should be (f).  
 Consider the title I chose for this chapter and now, perhaps react-
ing to the way I presented the multiple-choice question, you already 
conclude that my answer is (g). The purpose of this chapter, there-
fore, is to provide a rationale for that answer.  
 But, first, one other viewpoint should be considered. Schein’s 
(1987) definition of the client is valuable because it is practical and 
multiple. He states that we must think in terms of client  categories: 
 
•  Contact clients  approach the consultant initially (the employee 
relations person in my example).  
 
•  Intermediate clients get involved with the consultant in the 
early stages of the OD effort (the top management group in my 
example).   
 
•  Primary clients own a problem for which help is requested (the 
operations group in my example).  
 
•  Ultimate clients may or may not be directly involved with the 
OD practitioner “but their welfare and interest must be consid-
ered in planning further interventions” (Schein, 1987, p. 118). 
(In the case I described, this could be the parent company.)  
 The value of Schein’s categories is the fact that he addresses the 
reality of consulting. We often do not end up where we started in the 
consultant-client relationship.  

104 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Relations and Interfaces  
 Now back to my selection of (g) “none of the above.” I chose it 
because I believe that our client in OD consultation is never one indi-
vidual, regardless of position or role, or any particular group, team, 
or subsystem of the organization, or any combination thereof. Even 
though I generally subscribe to the idea of OD being a “total system,” 
I often wonder if changing a whole system is even possible. Besides, 
I have trouble defining what the total system is because each one 
resides within yet a larger “total system.”  
 The truth is that I have come to think of my client as the relation-
ship and/or interface between individuals and units within and related 
to the system. Thus, the arrows in  Figure  5.1 depict my view of the 
true client. This in-between-ness is the main subject of my consulting.  
 From the perspective of the consultant role, my notion of client is 
not new. In his 1970 book, Argyris avoided terms such as consultant, 
change agent, or practitioner, favoring instead  intervenor and  inter-
ventionist. These terms were, of course, an extension of his definition 
of a consultant intervention:  
 To intervene is to enter into an ongoing system of relation-
ships, to come between or among persons, groups, or objects 
for the purpose of helping them. There is an important im-
plicit assumption in the definition that should be made explic-
it; the system exists independently of the intervenor (Argyris, 
1970, p. 15).  
 For Argyris, then, to consult is to intervene. 
 Margulies (1978) characterized the role of the OD consultant as a 
marginal one (see  Chapter  8 , “Understanding Organizations: Covert 
Processes”). He argued that the degree to which the consultant is 
effective is a function of how capable he or she is at maintaining a 
certain social distance between self and other individuals in the cli-
ent organization and at operating on the boundaries of units rather 
than exclusively within them. In these ways, the consultant can more 
readily maintain an objective stance  in between  persons and units in 
conflict rather than by being  with one or the other. 

 
CHAPTER  5 • DEFINING THE CLIENT: A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE  
105
 Although I agree with both Argyris and Margulies regarding the 
consultant role, the focus here is on the other side, the client, and on 
the perspective of defining the client as relationships and interfaces 
rather than individuals and units, singular entities within the organi-
zation. To pursue this perspective, we first consider theory and then 
practice—the why and then the where and how.  
 Theory  
 Both general systems theory and the theory that underlies Gestalt 
therapy have furnished me with useful conceptual frameworks for 
understanding OD practice (Burke, 1980). Notions of entropy, input-
throughput-output, and equilibrium from the former and the ideas 
of energy, existentialism, and polarities from the latter have been 
particularly helpful in understanding some mistakes I have made in 
consultation; that is, why some efforts turned out other than as I had 
expected. To explain in more depth the ideas touched on in  Chapter 
 2 , “Organization Development Then and Now,” I find the theoretical 
thinking of Capra (1977, 1983) in high-energy physics and  Prigogine 
(Nicolis and Prigogine, 1977) and Jantsch (1980) in chemistry and 
evolution, respectively, particularly stimulating because their ideas 
both confirm and challenge general systems and related theory.  
 Capra stimulated me to consider organizational diagnosis in quite 
new ways. Like most OD practitioners, I have depended on models 
to help me make sense of all the data I collect from interviews, docu-
ments, observations, and the occasional questionnaire. I have relied 
on Weisbord’s six boxes at certain times and on other models with 
clients (see  Chapter  6 , “Understanding Organizations: The Process of 
Diagnosis”). Although they have been invaluable, they have not been 
the  sine qua non of diagnosis. The boxes and connecting lines direct 
me where to look and how to interpret certain information, yet when 
I concentrate exclusively on the components of these models I find 
that I overlook other important data—the nuances, certain reappear-
ing yet inconsistent patterns of behavior, hidden agendas, and collu-
sions. Yes, I know it is imperative that the client organization declare 
its purpose and mission, clarify its strategy, design an appropriate, 
workable structure, provide for its members reasonable and attractive 

106 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
rewards, and so on (see  Chapter  7 , “The Burke-Litwin Model of 
Organizational Performance and Change”). But focusing entirely on 
these dimensions obscures other data that should enter the consul-
tant’s field of vision. It may be that what happens out of the ordinary is 
just as  important, if not more so, than what happens routinely. It may 
be that repercussions in one or more of the boxes brought about by 
events in another box in the model are more important for diagnosis 
than what happens in the changed box itself. For example, a change of 
leadership may have stronger implications for organizational purpose 
than for the organization’s leadership per se.  
 Let us now consider some of Capra’s thoughts more directly. 
According to Capra and other physicists, matter at the subatomic 
level does not exist in terms of  things but as  probability waves. They 
only  tend to exist. Those terms that we learned in high school,  pro-
tons and  neutrons, the subparts of an atom, are not parts, particles, or 
tangible things as we normally think of them. They may be conceived 
of as entities but only as a convenience. Capra’s own words may help: 
 Depending on how we look at them, they appear sometimes 
as particles, sometimes as waves....  
 The apparent contradiction was finally resolved in a com-
pletely unexpected way that dealt a blow to the very founda-
tion of the mechanistic world view—the concept that matter 
is real. At the subatomic level, it was found, matter does not 
exist with certainty at definite pinpointable places but rather 
shows “tendencies to exist.”  
 At the atomic level, then, the solid-material objects of clas-
sical physics dissolve into wavelike patterns of probabilities. 
These patterns, furthermore, do not represent probabilities 
of things, but rather probabilities of interconnections (Capra, 
1977, p. 22).  
 Capra is therefore discussing  relations of abstract particles. These 
relations constitute a unified whole. This kind of thinking suggested to 
me that I should consider more directly and diligently the web (to use 
Capra’s term) of relations in organizations. It is this web, the interac-
tions, the interfaces, that make up or at least define the total system 
more clearly than the units and individuals that form the connecting 

 
CHAPTER  5 • DEFINING THE CLIENT: A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE  
107
points. For me, this way of conceiving and diagnosing a system depicts 
the reality of organizational behavior more closely than other models.  
 Jantsch, basing much of his theorizing on the prior work of 
Prigogine, states that to understand the evolution of living things, one 
must concentrate more on disequilibrium than on equilibrium. The 
former, he contends, is far more natural, affirmative, and central to 
growth and change. To achieve equilibrium is to gain comfort, yet this 
victory may bring us closer to stagnation and death than to vibrancy 
and life. Jantsch also holds that evolution is accelerating just as the 
overall process of change appears to be.  
 His theory has been heralded by some as a paradigmatic shift 
comparable to Einstein’s move away from Newton. Just as Einstein’s 
theory of relativity wrested the physical sciences away from Newton’s 
static ideas of gravity, Jantsch’s ideas challenge us to view movement, 
relativity, and change in living systems as  constant. He argues that all 
living things are always coevolving, yet maintaining a “relativity” to 
one another. Both Jantsch and Prigogine believe that the disequilib-
rium and perturbation that are from time to time in living things are 
actually a kind of molting, a shedding of the old within organisms as 
they strive  to attain a higher level of existence. These perturbations, 
activities of disequilibrium, are signs of positive change that lead to 
self-organization rather than to decline. Thus, out-of-the-ordinary 
events may be more significant for organizational understanding than 
ordinary ones.  
 A related principle from general systems theory is the idea of the 
steady state and dynamic homeostasis (see Goodwin Watson’s 1966 
article for an analysis of resistance to change within this theoretical 
context). According to this principle, open systems to survive must 
maintain a steady state. However, a steady state is not motionless or a 
true equilibrium. As Katz and Kahn (1978) characterize this principle 
for organizations, “There is a continuous inflow of energy from the 
external environment and a continuous export of the products of the 
system, the ratio of the energy exchanges and the relations between 
parts, remains  the same.” Even though their theory contends that the 
steady state is not motionless, Katz and Kahn do note that “relations 
between parts remain the same” and they conclude that “The basic 
principle is the preservation of the character of the system.” Perhaps 

108 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
their interpretation of general systems theory and Jantsch’s thinking 
are not that different. Perhaps it is a matter of emphasis.  
 But it may be that practitioners of OD would have overly empha-
sized the client’s achievement of a steady state and equilibrium. Yes, 
OD is at heart identified with change, yet one of our major interven-
tions, team building, is more often than not a striving toward greater 
equilibrium. (“Let’s learn to work better together; let’s learn to trust; 
let’s build a more cohesive unit”; etc.) These equilibrating goals are 
worthy, but if OD practitioners spend all their consulting time in this 
manner and in resolving conflicts, they may be helping to squash 
needed perturbations and disequilibrium.  
 Life cycle theory of organizations is pertinent to this last point 
(see, for example, Greiner, 1972). Usually for an organization to move 
successfully from one state of the cycle to another, wrenching changes 
have to be made even to the point of modifying the basic character of 
the organization.  
 To summarize, theory from sources other than the ones I usu-
ally turn to has challenged my way of understanding and diagnosing 
organizations. These ideas about matter and living things have stimu-
lated me to concentrate more on the relationships between people 
and units rather than necessarily the individuals and units per se, and 
on unusual events rather than on routine operations.  
 Let me now call attention to some findings and different empha-
ses from the world of practice that have influenced my outlook.  
 Practice  
 Some studies in management have further influenced my think-
ing about the importance of relationships and interfaces. We consider 
these studies in four different domains of relationships: the manager’s 
relationships downward with subordinates, upward with his or her 
boss, lateral relationships, and the manager’s unit’s relationships with 
other individuals and units.  
 Managing Subordinate Relationships  
 There is mounting evidence that, used appropriately, a partici-
pative management approach pays off. For example, some recent 

 
CHAPTER  5 • DEFINING THE CLIENT: A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE  
109
research reveals that managers who move rapidly up the hierarchy 
tend to involve their subordinates in decision making more than do 
managers who move up less rapidly. These faster-rising managers 
were rated by themselves and their subordinates as having a partici-
pative style, whereas less-successful managers were rated as having a 
persuasive, “selling” style or one that we might characterize as laissez-
faire (Hall, 1976).  
 In a study of executive competence in a large federal agency, 
those executives who were widely considered the most competent 
tended to manage more collaboratively, communicate more openly, 
solicit information from subordinates more frequently, more often 
establish mutual trust and respect with subordinates, provide more 
opportunities for subordinates to express openly their objections and 
disagreements with their superior’s proposed actions or decisions, 
and manage work group meetings in ways to ensure that a frank and 
open exchange of ideas occurred (Burke & Myers, 1982). There were 
at least 16 other significant differences between the most competent 
executives and those who  were less so. The six I have cited sound to 
me like a partial role description of a participative manager. In any 
case, the other behaviors were related to and supportive of the six 
above.  
 Blake and Mouton (1982) have also provided further theoretical 
support for their advocacy of participative management (see  Chapter 
 6 ) as well as some indirect empirical evidence. 
 Moreover, as pointed out in a  Fortune magazine article (Saparito, 
1986), it seems quite clear now that participative management works 
(also, see Huselid, 1995; Kizilos, Cummings, & Strickstein, 1994; and 
Sashkin, 1984); what prevents this form of management becoming 
more pervasive in spite of the evidence, according to the magazine 
reporter, is managers’ reluctance to share power. As one senior execu-
tive put it, “It’s no fun if you  can’t make the right decisions” (p. 60). 
 Although I believe that the overall pattern of evidence respect-
ing executive competence leans more and more toward participative 
management, my point here is not to debate the issue of management 
style. I  do wish to emphasize that management is becoming more 
and more a reciprocal process and less and less a top-down, boss-to-
subordinate, one-way street. If reciprocal relationships are a crucial 

110 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
ingredient of management competence, then my job as a consultant 
is to facilitate reciprocity, to mediate a two-way street, in other words, 
to work  in between. 
 Managing Up  
 We have some findings about the importance of learning how to 
influence one’s boss. Failure to “manage up,” to relate in an active 
rather than passive way with one’s superior, can readily lead to grave 
problems in the organization if not outright dismissal of a subordi-
nate. Gabarro and Kotter (1980) advise that one should learn quickly 
the boss’s personal and organizational goals, strengths and limitations, 
work habits and preferences, as well as one’s own patterns and style 
and how they fit with the boss’s. The more one knows about these 
subjects, the more influential one is likely to be.  
 In the aforementioned study of federal executives, we found that 
three competencies in this domain are critical: (1) the executive going 
to bat for subordinates with his or her superiors, (2) the executive’s 
ability to present bad news to superiors in a constructive way, and 
(3) the executive establishing good relations with upper-level 
executives.  
 OD consultants can help subordinates sharpen their abilities to 
influence those above them in the hierarchy. Helping subordinates 
to disclose threatening news, for example, will ensure that a boss is 
never surprised (a sin). Likewise, knowing how to deflect one’s boss 
from his or her preferred path is no small feat, yet it is often critical 
to organizational effectiveness. The point, once again, is to work in 
between.   
 Managing Lateral Relationships  
 Another set of competencies important to federal executives is 
skill at managing relationships with outside contractors and with other 
units within their organization. Moreover, a recent intensive study of 
successful general managers in the private sector found that the ability 
and energy to maintain contact with many people (in the hundreds) in 
their organization was key to their effectiveness (Kotter, 1982). Suc-
cessful managers knew an amazing number of people throughout the 

 
CHAPTER  5 • DEFINING THE CLIENT: A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE  
111
organization on a first-name basis, and they made frequent use of these 
relationships to be effective in their work. Maintaining a network is 
therefore highly significant to the success  of a general manager just 
as it is to the politician. Note that  Chapter  10 , “Understanding and 
Changing Loosely Coupled Systems,” covers loosely coupled systems 
with a network as the prime example. This coverage helps to explain 
the importance of networks now and in the future.  
 What struck me about these findings is, of course, the importance 
of multiple relationships, of establishing as well as maintaining them. 
In the federal agency study, we labeled one set of the competen-
cies (about a sixth of the total)  influence management because they 
were all concerned with the executive’s ability to influence others by 
means other than formal authority. It is perhaps in this domain of 
management in particular, and organizational functioning in general, 
that Capra’s “web of relations” becomes more salient. The consultant 
being able to perceive this web in all its intricacy is central to a good 
diagnosis and  vital to constructive intervention.  
 Managing Unit Interfaces  
 In an important paper about the dilemmas of managing by par-
ticipation, Kanter (1982) treats the matter of linking teams with their 
environment. This linkage consists of six dilemmas:  
  
1.  Problems of turnover (“You had to be there”). A major outcome 
of good team building is an increase in member participation 
accompanied by a lift in team spirit. This same spirit becomes 
a problem when new members join the team, especially if a 
newcomer happens to be a new boss. The boss can undercut 
the group’s work and/or lead the team in unwanted directions. 
If the team is to remain effective, these new and changing rela-
tionships must be managed.  
  
2.  The fixed decision problem.   When a group first begins to oper-
ate participatively so that a new team starts to emerge, certain 
ground rules, norms, and policies gradually become decisions. 
Later, when membership changes, the new members do not 
necessarily feel bound by these decisions because they took no 
part in framing them. Moreover, because all team members 

112 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
should have influence, prior decisions should not be viewed as 
immutable, the new members might argue. The dilemma, then, 
is how to continue the process of participation yet not to be 
obliged continually to renegotiate the team’s earlier decisions.  
  
3.  Suboptimization: too much team spirit.   A team can become so 
preoccupied with itself that its members lose sight of the team’s 
role and function within the larger organization.  
  
4.  Stepping on toes and territories: the problem of power. There 
may be other constituencies within the overall organization who 
believe that they have a stake in the problem or issue that the 
team holds as its exclusive domain. The team feels that it has 
worked so well together on this problem or issue that no one 
else is qualified to understand it as well, much less to deal with 
it effectively. With this knowledge and spirit comes a feeling of 
power that may be difficult to share when it is clear that others 
outside the team need to be involved.  
  
5.  Not invented here (NIH): the problem of ownership  and 
transfer.  It is commonplace that individuals and organizational 
units want to do things in their own way. And the greater the 
team spirit, the more reluctant members may be to adopt some-
one else’s ideas, especially another team’s. This reluctance, 
however, may lead to the waste of “reinventing the wheel” and 
of not cooperating, say, in the sharing of information. Diffusion 
of innovation is one of the most difficult problems of organiza-
tions.   
  
6.  “A time to live and a time to die.” Although the evidence is not 
yet conclusive, there is some indication that participation needs 
regular renewal. Members of intensive participation groups, 
such as quality circles and semiautonomous work teams, have 
experienced burnout after 18 months of activity. Periods of in-
terpersonal intensity should alternate with periods of distance. 
This suggests that some old teams need to die; new ones will 
form in their place. With other kinds of groups and teams, such 
as task forces, boards, councils, and so on, perhaps it is best 
to rotate membership rather than kill off old teams and start 
anew. Kanter’s point is that it is necessary for management to 
find ways to sustain continuity of participation as members of 
groups and as units come and go.  

 
CHAPTER  5 • DEFINING THE CLIENT: A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE  
113
 Kanter covers other dilemmas of management participation, 
especially within teams themselves and in leader-member relation-
ships. Her dilemmas concerning a team’s linkage with its environment 
are particularly pertinent to areas of relationships and interfaces that 
OD practitioners may overlook. Flushed with the success of a team-
building effort, the consultant may be blind to the greater need of 
helping the team with new members, a new leader perhaps, other 
units that may have a stake in some of the outcomes of the team’s 
work, and its own team members over time because the need for 
renewal will emerge sooner than one might  expect.  
 Kanter’s dilemmas of managing participation, particularly those 
dealing with a team and its environment, represent fertile ground for 
OD consultation and further illustrate that the ground for consulta-
tion largely comprises relationships and interfaces.  
 Conclusion  
 Although I have usually been clear about the person in the client 
organization with whom I should contract for OD consultation, I have 
not always been clear that my  ultimate client was the same person, 
or his or her boss, or a specific organizational unit such as the top 
management group, or the total system. It seems to me that other 
OD consultants are likewise somewhat perplexed about the identity 
of the ultimate client. As I read works about living systems and reflect 
on OD practice, I conclude that my ultimate client is that  behavior 
in organizations represented by  interactions, by relationships and 
interfaces. These interactions represent the basic reality of organiza-
tional life and therefore my consultation should concentrate on them. 
Furthermore, I should pay special attention to nonroutine events of 
organizational life because these occurrences generate energy among 
members to return the system to a steady state, to achieve homeo-
stasis and equilibrium. It is this use of energy and its direction that 
will tell me more about how the organization really operates than the 
energy that the members of the organization expend to maintain nor-
mal, daily operations. Just as Kurt Lewin observed that the best way to 
diagnose an organization is to  attempt to change it, we may also state 

114 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
that it is easier to understand an organization when it is disturbed by 
atypical events than when it is operating as usual.  
 It is not my contention that one should entirely ignore everyday 
routine, the organizational structure with its boxes and lines, individu-
als, work units, the president, and the board of directors. It is more 
a matter of emphasis for me to focus especially on the in-between. 
I also believe that relationships and interfaces in organizations will 
grow even more important in the future because of the changing 
nature of authority, insofar as authority becomes more of a function 
of expertise and knowledge rather than position, and of the increasing 
degrees of complexity in managing organizations. It is virtually impos-
sible for a single individual to know a considerable amount, much less 
everything, about running an organization or even a part of it. This 
is especially true of high-technology organizations, public or private. 
Thus, mutual dependency is more the rule than the exception.  
 Because OD practitioners are knowledgeable about interpersonal 
process and are skillful in dealing with relationships, there will be 
plenty of opportunity for constructive work, changing cultures, and 
applying OD in new ways. We simply must become clearer about the 
true subject (in my term,  client ) of that work.

 Understanding Organizations: 
The Process of Diagnosis  
 Without a framework for understanding, the data an organization 
development (OD) practitioner collects about a client organization 
may remain nothing more than an array of personal comments of the 
who-said-what-about-whom variety. For the information to become 
useful, it must be treated in organizational terms. Because OD repre-
sents a systematic approach to change, and the data for diagnosis are 
largely in systems language, the categories for diagnosis are systems 
labels.  
 This chapter covers selected models of and theories about organi-
zations that are useful in the diagnostic phase of OD consultation 
because they help to organize and systematize the potentially confus-
ing masses of data. Among the models and theories from which the 
OD practitioner may choose, some are merely descriptive while oth-
ers emphasize dimensions for diagnosis, thereby providing direction 
for change. The purpose of this chapter is to provide the practitioner 
with some criteria and bases for making choices.  
 The models and theories that have been chosen to consider in this 
chapter are all behavior-oriented. Although some other frameworks 
emphasize technological, financial, or informational aspects of organi-
zations, behavior-oriented models are more valuable for OD practice 
because the role of the OD practitioner is to understand what  people 
do or do not do in organizations. Social media and other kinds of tech-
nology, for example, are of interest to OD practitioners, but only in 
terms of what it means for how people work, not for the technological 
wizardry involved (Bush & McCord, 2010; Kaplan, 2005).  
 The various models we explore are all based on the open-system 
notion of input-throughput-output and all recognize that an 

116 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
organization exists in an environmental context and is a sociotechnical 
system. All recognize the same fundamentals—an open system that 
exists in an environment and consists of people and technology.  
 Organizational Models  
 We first examine four models that are largely descriptive: a model 
of simplicity with structure, two models of complexity with structure, 
and a develop-your-own model.  
 Weisbord’s Six-Box Model  
 A model is useful when it helps us visualize reality, and Weis-
bord’s (1976, 1978) model meets this criterion very well. Weisbord 
depicts his model as a radar screen, with “blips” that tell us about 
organizational highlights and issues good and bad. Just as air traffic 
controllers use their radar, we too must focus primarily on the screen 
as a whole, not on individual blips (see  Figure   6.1 ). 
 Every organization is situated within an environment and, as the 
arrows in the figure indicate, is influenced by and influences various 
elements of that environment. In Weisbord’s model, the organiza-
tion is represented by six boxes: purposes, structure, rewards, helpful 
mechanisms, relationships, and leadership. Weisbord believes that, 
for each box, the client organization should be diagnosed in terms 
of both its formal and its informal systems. A key aspect of any orga-
nizational diagnosis is the gap between the formal dimensions of an 
organization, such as the organization chart (the structure box), and 
its informal policies, such as how authority is actually  exercised. The 
larger this gap is, the more likely it is that the organization is function-
ing ineffectively.  
 Weisbord provides key diagnostic questions for each of the six 
boxes. For the  purposes box, the two most important factors are goal 
clarity, the extent to which organization members are clear about the 
organization’s mission and purpose, and goal agreements, people’s 
support of the organization’s purpose. For  structure, the primary 
question is whether there is an adequate fit between the purpose and 

 CHAPTER  6 • UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS: THE PROCESS OF DIAGNOSIS  
117
the internal structure that is supposed to serve that purpose. With 
respect to  relationships, Weisbord contends that three types are most 
important: between individuals, between units or departments that 
perform different tasks, and between the people and the nature and 
requirements  of their jobs. He also states that the OD consultant 
should “diagnose first for required interdependence, then for  quality 
of relations , and finally for modes of conflict management” (Weis-
bord, 1976, p. 440).

118 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 In assessing blips for the  rewards box, the consultant should diag-
nose the similarities and differences between the organization’s for-
mal rewards (the compensation package, incentive systems, and the 
like) and organization members’ perceived rewards or punishments.  
 Weisbord makes the  leadership box central because he believes 
that a primary job of the leader is to watch for blips among the other 
boxes and to maintain balance among them. To help the OD consul-
tant in  diagnosing the leadership box, Weisbord refers to an impor-
tant book written by Selznick (1957) and published more than a half 
century ago yet remains highly relevant today. Citing the four most 
important leadership tasks, according to Selznick, the consultant 
should determine the extent to which organizations’ leaders are (1) 
defining purposes, (2) embodying purposes in programs, (3) defend-
ing the organization’s integrity, and (4) maintaining order  with respect 
to internal conflict.  
 For the last box,  helpful mechanisms, Weisbord refers analogously 
to “the cement that binds an organization together to make it more 
than a collection of individuals with separate needs” (Weisbord, 1976, 
p. 443). Thus, helpful mechanisms are the processes that every orga-
nization must attend to in order to survive: planning, control, budget-
ing, and other information systems that help organization members 
accomplish their respective jobs and meet organizational objectives. 
The OD consultant’s task is to determine which mechanisms (or 
which aspects of them) help members accomplish organizational pur-
poses and which seem to hinder more than they help. When a helpful 
mechanism becomes  red tape, it probably is no longer helpful.  
 Table  6.1 gives a summary of the six-box model and the diagnostic 
questions to be asked.  
 In summary, Weisbord’s model is particularly useful when the 
consultant does not have as much time as would be desirable for diag-
nosis, when a relatively uncomplicated organizational map is needed 
for quick service, or when the client is unaccustomed to thinking in 
systems terms. In the latter case, the model helps the client to visu-
alize his or her organization as a systemic whole without the use of 
strange terminology. We have also found Weisbord’s model useful 
in supervising and guiding students in their initial OD consultations.

 Diagnostic questions may be asked on two levels: 
 1. How big a gap is there between formal and informal systems? (This speaks to 
the fit between individual and organization.)  
 2. How much discrepancy is there between “what is” and “what ought to be”? 
(This highlights the fit between organization and environment.)

 The Nadler-Tushman Congruence Model  
 For a more sophisticated client and when more time is available, 
a more complex model of organizations might be useful for OD diag-
nosis. In such instances, the Nadler and Tushman (1977) congruence 
model might serve the purpose.  
 Nadler and Tushman make the same assumptions as 
Weisbord—that an organization is an open system and therefore is 
influenced by its environment (inputs) and also shapes its environment 

120 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
to some extent by outputs. An organization thus is the transformation 
entity between inputs and outputs.  Figure  6.2 represents the Nadler-
Tushman congruence model.

(p. 92). New York: McGraw-Hill. Reprinted by permission.  
 Inputs 
 Nadler and Tushman view inputs to the system as relatively fixed; 
the four they cite are the  environment, the  resources available to the 
organization, the organization’s  history, and the  strategies that are 
developed and evolve over time. These inputs help define how people 
in the organization behave, and they serve as constraints on behavior 
as well as opportunities for action.  
 As we know from the works of Burns and Stalker (1961), and 
Lawrence and Lorsch (1967), the extent to which an organization’s 
environment is relatively stable or dynamic significantly affects inter-
nal operations, structure, and policy. For many organizations, a very 
important aspect of environment is the parent system and its direc-
tives. Many organizations are subsidiaries or divisional profit centers 
of larger corporations, colleges within a university, or hospitals within 
a larger health-care delivery system. These subordinate organizations 

 CHAPTER  6 • UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS: THE PROCESS OF DIAGNOSIS  
121
may operate relatively autonomously with respect to the outside world 
(having their own purchasing operations, for example) but because of 
corporate policy may  be fairly restricted in how much money they can 
spend. Thus, for many organizations, we must think of their environ-
ments in at least two categories: the larger parent system and the rest 
of the outside world—government regulations, competitors, and the 
marketplace in general.  
 According to the Nadler-Tushman model, resources include capi-
tal (money, property, equipment, and so on), raw materials, technolo-
gies, people, and various intangibles, such as company name, which 
may have a high value in the company’s market.  
 An organization’s history is also input to the system. The history 
determines, for example, patterns of employee behavior, policy, the 
types of people the organization attracts and recruits, and even how 
decisions get made in a crisis.  
 Although strategies are categorized as an input in the model, 
Nadler and Tushman set it apart. Strategy is the process of determin-
ing how the organization’s resources are best used within the environ-
ment for optimal organizational functioning. It is the act of identifying 
opportunities in the environment and determining whether the orga-
nization’s resources are adequate for capitalizing on these opportuni-
ties. History plays a subtle but influential role in this strategic process. 
 Some organizations are very strategic; that is, they operate 
according to a plan. Other organizations simply react to changes in 
their environments or act opportunistically rather than according to 
a long-range plan that determines which opportunities will be seized 
and which will be allowed to pass. As Nadler and Tushman point out, 
however, organizations have strategies whether they are deliberate 
and formal or unintentional and informal.  
 Outputs  
 We move to the right side of the model to consider outputs before 
covering the transformation process. Thus, we examine the organiza-
tion’s environment from the standpoint of both how it influences the 
system and how the organization operates internally.  

122 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 For diagnostic purposes, Nadler and Tushman present four key 
categories of outputs: system functioning, group behavior, inter-
group relations, and individual behavior and effect. With respect to 
the effectiveness of the system’s functioning as a whole, the following 
three questions should elicit the necessary information:  
  
1.  How well is the organization attaining its desired goals of pro-
duction, service, return on investment, and so on?  
  
2.  How well is the organization utilizing its resources? 
  
3.  How well is the organization coping with changes in its environ-
ment over time?  
 The remaining three outputs are more directly behavioral: how 
well groups or units within the organization are performing; how 
effectively these units communicate with one another, resolve differ-
ences, and collaborate when necessary; and how individuals behave. 
For this last output, individual behavior, we are interested in such 
matters as turnover, absenteeism, and, of course, individual job per-
formance and satisfaction.  
 The Transformation Process  
 The components of the transformation process and their inter-
actions are what we normally think of when we consider an orga-
nization—the people, the various tasks and jobs, the organization’s 
managerial structure (the organization chart), and all the relationships 
of individuals, groups, and subsystems. As  Figure  6.2 shows, four 
interactive major components compose the transformation process 
that changes inputs into outputs.  
 The  task component consists of the jobs to be done and the inher-
ent characteristics of the work itself. The primary task dimensions 
are the extent and nature of the required interdependence between 
and among task performers, the level of skill needed, and the kinds of 
information required to perform the tasks adequately.  
 The  individual component consists of all the differences and sim-
ilarities among employees, particularly demographic data, skill and 
professional levels, and personality-attitudinal variables.  

 CHAPTER  6 • UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS: THE PROCESS OF DIAGNOSIS  
123
 Organizational arrangements include the managerial and opera-
tional structure of the organization, workflow and design, reward 
system, management information systems, and the like. These 
arrangements are the formal mechanisms used by management to 
direct and control behavior and to organize and accomplish the work 
to be done.  
 The fourth component,  informal organization, is the social struc-
ture within the organization, including the grapevine, the organi-
zation’s internal politics, and the informal authority-information 
structure (whom you see for what).  
 Congruence: The Concept of Fit  
 As Nadler and Tushman point out, a mere listing and description 
of these system inputs, outputs, and components is insufficient for 
modeling an organization. An organization is dynamic, never static, 
and the model must represent this reality, as the arrows in  Figure 
 6.2 do. Nadler and Tushman go beyond depicting relationships, how-
ever. Their term,  fit, is a measure of the congruence between pairs 
of inputs and especially between the components of the transforma-
tion process. They contend that inconsistent fits between any pair will 
result in less-than-optimal organizational and individual performance. 
Nadler and Tushman’s hypothesis, therefore, is that the better the fit, 
the  more effective the organization will be.  
 Nadler and Tushman recommend three steps for diagnosis: 
  
1.  Identify the system.    Is the system for diagnosis an autonomous 
organization, a subsidiary, a division, or a unit of some larger 
system? What are the boundaries of the system, its member-
ship, its tasks, and—if it is part of a larger organization—its re-
lationships with other units?  
  
2.  Determine the nature of the key variables. What are the dimen-
sions of the inputs and components? What are the desired out-
puts?   
  
3.  Diagnose the state of fits. This is the most important step, in-
volving two related activities: determining fits between compo-
nents and diagnosing the link between the fits and the organiza-
tion’s outputs.    

124 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 The OD consultant must concentrate on the degree to which the 
key components are congruent with one another. Questions such as 
the following should be asked:  
 
•  To what extent do the organizational arrangements fit with the 
requirements of the task?  
 
•  To what extent do individual skills and needs fit with task 
requirements, with organizational arrangements, and with the 
informal organization? Hackman and Oldham’s (1975) job char-
acteristics theory is a useful supplementary model for this part 
of the diagnosis, as is expectancy theory (Vroom, 1964; Lawler, 
1973).   
 
•  To what extent do task requirements fit with both the formal 
and the informal organization? Information-processing models 
are useful supplements for this aspect of the diagnosis (Gal-
braith, 1977; Tushman & Nadler, 1978).  
 To diagnose the link between fits and outputs, the OD consultant 
must focus the outcome of the diagnoses of the various component 
fits and their behavioral consequences on the set of behaviors associ-
ated with systems outputs: goal attainment, resource utilization, and 
overall systems performance. Considering the component fits, or lack 
thereof, in light of system outputs helps identify critical problems of 
the organization. As these problems are addressed and changes are 
made, the system is then monitored through the feedback loop for 
purposes of evaluation.  
 In summary, the dimensions of the Nadler-Tushman model are 
quite comprehensive and have face validity. Moreover, their notion 
of congruence suggests certain cause-effect linkages. For example, 
little or no congruence between, say, strategy and structure in their 
model produces poor organizational performance. Also, a mismatch 
between what’s going on in the organization’s environment and 
strategy—for example, no plan for dealing with a recent change in 
government regulation—would imply a causal relationship to per-
formance. Many other congruences or lack thereof could be men-
tioned. The number of possibilities is large. Nadler and Tushman, 
however, do not provide ideas or, say, a formula for determining 

 CHAPTER  6 • UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS: THE PROCESS OF DIAGNOSIS  
125
which variables in their model are central. For example, they include 
under a single heading, organizational arrangements, quite a number 
of components, any one of which could easily be central. Finally, they 
do not suggest any means for knowing when congruence has occurred 
or what levels of congruence or incongruence produce desirable or 
undesirable effects.  
 To be fair, Nadler and Tushman (1989) had some second thoughts 
about their congruence position:  
 While our model implies that congruence of organizational 
components is a desirable state it is, in fact, a double-edged 
sword. In the short term, congruence seems to be related to 
effectiveness and performance. A system with high congru-
ence, however, can be resistant to change. It develops ways of 
insulating itself from outside influences and may be unable to 
respond to new situations (p. 195).  
 Tichy’s TPC Framework  
 With his organizational framework, Tichy (1983) focuses explic-
itly on the management of change. He states that there are nine 
organizational change levers. They are the (1) external interface, or 
the organization’s external environment; (2) mission; (3) strategy; 
(4) managing organizational mission/strategy processes, that is, real-
istically engaging the relevant interest groups; (5) task—change often 
requires new tasks; (6) prescribed  networks —more or less, the formal 
organizational structure; (7) organizational processes—communicat-
ing, problem solving, and decision making; (8) people; and (9) emer-
gent networks—more or less, the informal organization.  Figure  6.3 
shows how Tichy arranges these nine levers. He assumes that “orga-
nizational effectiveness (or output) is  a function of the component of 
the model, as well as a function of how the components interrelate 
and align into a functioning system” (p. 72).

 Even more important in Tichy’s thinking about organization 
change is his TPC framework. The model in  Figure  6.3 is not unique. 
What makes Tichy’s thinking unique is his overlay of the three sys-
tems—technical, political, and cultural—across the nine-lever model. 
He contends that there have been three dominant yet fairly distinct 
traditions guiding the practice of organization change. The  technical 
view is rational, based on empiricism and the scientific method. The 

 CHAPTER  6 • UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS: THE PROCESS OF DIAGNOSIS  
127
 political view is based on the belief that organizations have dominant 
groups, and bargaining is the primary mode of change. The  cultural 
view is the belief that shared symbols, values, and “cognitive schemes,” 
as  Tichy labels them, are what tie people together and form the orga-
nization’s culture. Change occurs by altering norms and the cogni-
tive schemes of organizational members. Taking only one or only two 
of these views for managing organizational change is dysfunctional. 
All three must be adjusted and realigned for successful change. The 
metaphor that Tichy uses to capture this thinking is a rope with three 
interrelated strands. The strands, or three views, can be understood 
separately but must be managed together for effective change.  
 For diagnostic purposes, Tichy uses a matrix like the one shown 
in  Figure  6.4 . This format summarizes what he calls “the analysis of 
alignments.” Tichy describes the use of the matrix this way:  
 Based on the diagnostic data collected, a judgment is made 
for each cell of the matrix regarding the amount of change 
needed to create alignment. Working across the matrix, the 
alignment is within a system: technical, political, or cultural. 
Working down the matrix, the alignment is between systems. 
The 0 (no change), 1 (moderate change) or 2 (great deal of 
change) ratings represent the amount of change needed to 
align that component (p. 164).  
 In summary, Tichy’s model includes many, if not most, of the crit-
ical variables important to understanding organizations. His model is 
unique with respect to the strategic rope metaphor and is particularly 
relevant to OD work because the emphasis is on change. Moreover, 
Tichy is clear about what he considers to be the primary organiza-
tional levers that must be pushed or pulled to make change happen 
effectively. Instead of congruence, alignment is the operational term. 
And Tichy provides a way of analyzing the key alignments that are 
necessary according to his framework. Data are first collected and 
then categorized within his  matrix ( Figure   6.4 ).

 There is a human component in Tichy’s model, but for the most 
part his framework ignores issues at the individual level. He admits 
this omission at the end of his book by stating that he skimmed over the 
psychological aspects of change. The political and cultural strands are, 
of course, people concerns but much broader than, say, job-person 
match (or alignment) and local work unit activities such as teamwork. 
Finally, the criticism of too much congruence potentially working 
against change could also apply to Tichy’s insistence on alignments.  
 Hornstein and Tichy’s Emergent Pragmatic Model  
 The emergent pragmatic model of organizational diagnosis (Horn-
stein & Tichy, 1973; Tichy, Hornstein, & Nisberg, 1977) is based on 
the premise that most managers and consultants “carry around in 
their heads” implicit theories or models about organizational behav-
ior and about how human systems actually operate. These notions are 
usually intuitive, ill-formed, and difficult to articulate. Because they 
are largely intuitive, different observers and members of organiza-
tions have different theories, which gives rise to conflicts among con-
sultants or between consultants and clients about what is really wrong 
with the organization and how to fix it.  

 CHAPTER  6 • UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS: THE PROCESS OF DIAGNOSIS  
129
 Hornstein and Tichy have developed a procedure for helping 
managers articulate and conceptualize their implicit models. The 
procedure has managers represent the information they would seek 
in diagnosing an organization by selecting labels from among 22 sam-
ples or creating their own from 28 blank labels provided. The labels 
include such items as informal groupings, fiscal characteristics, turn-
over, goals, and satisfaction of members with their jobs.  
 Hornstein and Tichy’s approach to organizational diagnosis is 
shared between consultant and client and among members of the 
client organization. The approach is called an emergent-pragmatic 
theory because “the model  emerges from an exploration of both the 
consultant’s and client’s assumptions about behavior and organiza-
tions...and draws on both the consultant’s and client’s organizational 
 experiences as well as on empirical and theoretical work in the field” 
(Tichy, Hornstein, & Nisberg, 1977, p. 367; emphasis added).  
 Another of Hornstein and Tichy’s premises is that, consciously 
or not, organizational consultants tend to impose their theories and 
models of human systems on their clients. These impositions often do 
not fit with the client members’ perceptions and beliefs or do not jibe 
with the client organization’s underlying values. To improve congru-
ence, Hornstein and Tichy advocate a highly collaborative approach 
between consultants and clients, one that results in an emergent 
model representing different perspectives and experiences.  
 There are five phases to the emergent-pragmatic approach. The 
consultant guides the client group through these phases:  
  
1.  Exploring and developing a diagnostic model 
  
2.  Developing change strategies 
  
3.  Developing change techniques 
  
4.  Assessing the necessary conditions for assuring success 
  
5.  Evaluating the change strategies 
 To summarize, the emergent-pragmatic approach to organiza-
tional diagnosis is based on the assumption that most managers and 
consultants have intuitive theories about how organizations function, 
rather than well-formed conceptual frameworks, and the assumption 
that many consultants impose their models and theories on client 

130 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
organizations, regardless of how appropriate they may be for the par-
ticular client. Hornstein and Tichy advocate a collaborative model of 
diagnosis to avoid the potential negative consequences of operating 
on the basis of these two assumptions.  
 The three models described earlier—Weisbord’s six-box model, 
the Nadler-Tushman congruence model, and Tichy’s TPC frame-
work—are generic frameworks and do not fall prey to the problems 
of Hornstein and Tichy’s two premises. When the consultant and the 
client do not find the Weisbord, Nadler-Tushman, or other formal 
models to their liking, however, the emergent-pragmatic approach 
offers a clear alternative. It is a do-it-yourself model and, if both con-
sultant and client are willing to spend the time required to do it right, 
a mutually satisfying and appropriate model for the client organiza-
tion is likely to result.  
 The four models described may all be categorized as  contingency 
models. They do not specify directions for change prior to diagnosis; 
rather, what needs to be changed emanates from the diagnosis. None 
of the models advocates a particular design for an organization’s inter-
nal structure, a certain style of behavior, or a specific approach to 
management. The inventors of these models do have biases, however. 
Weisbord says the boxes should be in balance, Nadler and Tushman 
argue that the various dimensions of their model should fit with one 
another, as does Tichy, and Hornstein and Tichy state that the consul-
tant and client  should collaborate toward the emergence of a model 
that is appropriate for the given organization. These biases have more 
to do with the best way to diagnose than with the most important 
dimension to change.  
 We now shift from organizational frameworks to more theoretical 
ways of describing, understanding, and changing organizations.  
 Lawrence and Lorsch’s Contingency Theory  
 Lawrence and Lorsch, early contingency theorists, specify neither 
a best way to diagnose nor a particular direction for change. They do 
emphasize structure and intergroup relationships.  
 Lawrence and Lorsch hypothesize a cause-and-effect relation-
ship between how well an organization’s internal structure matches 

 CHAPTER  6 • UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS: THE PROCESS OF DIAGNOSIS  
131
environmental demands and how well the organization performs 
(accomplishes its goals and objectives). Their research in the 1960s 
provided support for their argument (Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967).  
 To understand the use of Lawrence and Lorsch’s contingency 
theory for diagnosis, keep in mind that its primary concepts are dif-
ferentiation and integration. These two concepts represent the para-
dox of any organization design—that labor must simultaneously be 
divided and coordinated or integrated. Within the Lawrence and 
Lorsch framework and for diagnostic purposes, therefore, we want to 
examine our client organization along the dimensions they consider 
to be important. The methodological appendix of their book provides 
considerable detail concerning these dimensions and the questions 
to ask for obtaining the relevant information (Lawrence & Lorsch, 
1967). The following lists summarize these dimensions  and some of 
the related questions:  
 Environmental Demands 
  
1.  On what basis does a customer evaluate and choose between 
competing suppliers in this industry (price, quality, delivery, 
service, and so forth)?  
  
2.  What are the major problems an organization encounters when 
competing in this industry?  
  
3.  Have there been significant changes in the market or technical 
conditions in this industry in recent years?  
 Differentiation 
  
1.  Regarding structure, what is the average span of control? How 
important is it to have formal rules for routing procedures and 
operations?   
  
2.  Regarding the timespan of feedback, how long does it take for 
employees to see the results of their performance? (In sales, for 
example, the time lag is typically short, whereas in research and 
development [R & D], it may take years.)  
  
3.  Regarding interpersonal relationships, how important are they, 
and how much interaction is necessary?  
  
4.  Regarding goal certainty, how clear-cut are the goals? How are 
they measured?    

132 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Integration 
  
1.  How interdependent are any two units: high (each depends on 
the other for survival), medium (each needs some things from 
the other), or low (each functions fairly autonomously)?  
  
2.  What is the quality of relations between units? 
 Conflict Management 
  
1.  What mode of conflict resolution is used: forcing (top-down 
edicts), smoothing (being kind and avoiding), or confronting 
(exposing differences and solving problems)?  
  
2.  How much influence do employees have on the hierarchy for 
solving problems and making decisions?  
 Employee-Management Contract 
  
1.  To what extent do employees feel that what is expected of them 
is appropriate?  
  
2.  To what extent do employees feel that they are compensated 
and rewarded fairly for their performance?  
 In summary, these five dimensions represent the organizational 
domains that Lawrence and Lorsch believe most important for effec-
tive diagnosis. Based on their research findings, the organizational 
diagnostician would be looking for the degree of match between 
environmental demands and complexities and the internal organiza-
tional structure. The greater the environmental complexity, the more 
complex the internal design should be. If the organization’s markets 
change rapidly and are difficult to predict and forecast, and if the envi-
ronment in general fluctuates considerably, the organization’s internal 
structure should be relatively decentralized so that many employees 
can be in touch with the environment and can  act quickly as changes 
occur. Under these conditions, differentiation may still be high, but 
a premium is placed on integration. There must be sufficient inte-
grating mechanisms so that communication flows adequately across 
and among the many subunits and so that superiors in the hierarchy 
are kept well informed. The plastics industry represented this type 
of organization in the Lawrence and Lorsch research study. When 

 CHAPTER  6 • UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS: THE PROCESS OF DIAGNOSIS  
133
the environment is relatively stable and not particularly complex (the 
container industry in their study), a fairly simple and straightforward 
internal structure may be best, with functional division of labor and 
centralized authority.  
 The issue is not whether one organization should be highly differ-
entiated and another highly integrated but that they should be highly 
differentiated  and integrated. High integration seems to be important 
regardless of environment, and differentiation may be lower for orga-
nizations with stable environments. The paradox remains in any case: 
Both are needed, but they are antagonistic—the more the organiza-
tion is differentiated, the more integration is required.  
 The organizational diagnostician should also seek the mode of 
conflict resolution. Lawrence and Lorsch found that the more orga-
nization members and units confront their differences and work to 
resolve them, rather than smoothing them over or squashing them 
with edicts from on high, the more effective the organization tended 
to be.  
 Finally, it is necessary to know the degree of employees’ satisfac-
tion with their psychological contract with the organization. There 
is apparently a positive relationship between clarity of employees’ 
understanding of what is expected of them—their perceived satis-
faction with the rewards they receive for performance—and overall 
organizational performance.  
 Although Lawrence and Lorsch are contingency theorists, par-
ticularly with respect to organization structure, they too have their 
biases. They stress interfaces—between the organization and its 
environment, between and among units within the organization, and 
between individual employees and the organization as represented by 
management.    
 Normative Theories  
 Unlike contingency theorists, normative theorists argue that, for 
organization development, there is one best way to implement change 
and one best direction for change. Major proponents of normative 
theory are Likert (1967) and Blake and Mouton (1968, 1978).  

134 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Likert’s Profiles  
 Likert categorizes organizations, or systems in his terms, as one 
of four types:  
 
•   System 1.  Autocratic, top-down, exploitive management 
 
•   System 2.  Benevolent autocracy (still top-down but not as 
exploitive)   
 
•   System 3.  Consultative (employees are consulted about prob-
lems and decisions but management still makes the final 
decisions)   
 
•   System 4.  Participative management (key policy decisions are 
made in groups by consensus)  
 Likert’s approach to organizational diagnosis is standardized. The 
mode used is a questionnaire, the “Profile of Organizational Charac-
teristics,” with six sections: leadership, motivation, communication, 
decisions, goals, and control. (The latest version is labeled the “Survey 
of Organizations.”) Organization members answer questions in each 
of these sections by placing the letter  N at the place on a 20-point 
scale that best represents their opinion now and a  P at the place that 
indicates their previous opinion—how they experienced their organi-
zation one or two years ago. Sometimes the consultant asks organiza-
tion members to use an  I instead of a  P, to indicate what they would 
consider  ideal for each of the questions.  
 Organizational profiles typically fall into the System 2 or System 3 
categories. If the ideal response is used, its profile will usually occur to 
the right of the now profile, toward or within System 4. In such cases, 
the direction for change is established, toward System 4.  
 When one declares that there is one best way, in this case Sys-
tem 4 management, others usually demand evidence. Is System 4 
management a better way to run an organization than System 3 or 2 
or 1? Contingency theorists, of course, would say no; it depends on 
the type of business, the nature of the environment, and the tech-
nology involved. Likert contends that, regardless of these contingen-
cies, System 4 is best. Likert’s (1967) own research supports his claim, 
and so does research by others. A longitudinal study of perhaps the 
most systematic change to System 4 management—conducted in 
the Harwood-Weldon  Company, a manufacturer of sleepwear—is a 

 CHAPTER  6 • UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS: THE PROCESS OF DIAGNOSIS  
135
noteworthy example (Marrow, Bowers, & Seashore, 1967). Changes 
were made in all dimensions of Likert’s profile as well as in workflow 
and organizational structure. The durability of these changes was sup-
ported by a later study conducted by Seashore and Bowers (1970).  
 A System 4 approach was also used as the change goal for a Gen-
eral Motors assembly plant (Dowling, 1975). As a result of these 
deliberate change efforts toward System 4, significant improvements 
were accomplished on several indices, including operating efficiency, 
costs, and grievances.  
 In summary, Likert’s approach to organizational diagnosis is 
structured and directional. It is structured by use of his questionnaire 
and later versions of his profile (Taylor & Bowers, 1972), and it is 
directional in that data collected are compared with System 4. The 
survey feedback method (see  Chapter  3 , “Where Did Organization 
Development Come From?,” and Mann, 1957) is used as the main 
intervention; that is, the data from the questionnaire (survey) are 
reported back to organizational members in a set manner.  
 To use Likert’s approach, the consultant should feel comfortable 
with the questionnaire method as the primary mode for data gather-
ing and with System 4 management as the goal for change. Although 
participative management may feel comfortable as a change goal for 
many consultants and clients, the relatively limited diagnosis by pro-
file characteristics only may not be so comfortable.  
 Blake and Mouton’s Grid Organization Development  
 The other normative approach to OD is based on the manage-
rial grid model developed by Blake and Mouton (1964, 1978). Like 
Likert’s System 4 approach, the grid method of OD is structured and 
involves a high degree of packaging. Blake and Mouton also argue 
that there is one best way to manage an organization. Their label is 
9,9, which also represents a participative style of management.  
 Blake and Mouton also depend on questionnaires, but grid OD 
(Blake & Mouton, 1968) goes far beyond an initial diagnosis with a 
questionnaire. Blake and Mouton start from an initial, general diag-
nosis. In a cross-cultural study of what managers consider the most 
common barriers to business effectiveness and corporate excellence, 

136 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
Blake and Mouton (1968) found that communication topped the list 
often, and a lack of planning was second. These two barriers were 
selected by managers much more frequently than the remaining eight 
(74 percent noted communication and 62 percent mentioned plan-
ning); morale and coordination, for example, the next most frequently  
mentioned barriers, were noted by less than 50 percent. Blake and 
Mouton further pointed out that communication and planning were 
the top two mentioned regardless of country, company, or character-
istics of the managers reporting. These two major barriers, and the 
other less-prevalent ones, are symptoms of organizational problems, 
not causes, according to Blake and Mouton. The causes lie deeper 
in the system. Faulty planning, for example, is a result of an orga-
nization’s not having a strategy or having a strategy that is based on 
unsound rationale. Communication problems derive from the nature 
of the supervision practiced in the organization.  
 For addressing these underlying causes, Blake and Mouton 
have developed a six-phase approach to organization development 
that considers both the organization’s strategic plan, or lack thereof, 
and the style or approach to supervision or management. They con-
tend that, to achieve excellence, an organizational strategic model 
should be developed and the supervisory style should be changed in 
the direction of participative management. Organization members 
should first examine managerial behavior and style and then move 
on to develop and implement an ideal strategic organizational model. 
Before explaining the six phases of their OD approach in more detail, 
we should consider Blake and  Mouton’s managerial style model, the 
Managerial Grid ® , because most of their normative rationale is based 
on this model.  
 Building on earlier research work on leadership, in which the dual 
functions of a leader were variously labeled as initiation of structure 
and consideration, task and maintenance and task and socioemotional 
behaviors, Blake and Mouton (1964) simplified the language by using 
terms closer to managers’ understanding:  production and  people. 
They did more, however; the creative aspect of their work was to con-
ceptualize each of the two leader functions on a continuum, one for 
the manager’s degree of concern for production and one for his or 
her concern for people, and to put the two together in the form of a 
graph, a  two-dimensional model.  

 CHAPTER  6 • UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS: THE PROCESS OF DIAGNOSIS  
137
 Blake and Mouton (1981) contend that they have done more than 
merely simplify the language and create nine-point scales. They argue 
that the original dimensions—initiation of structure and consider-
ation—and those that followed, especially Hersey and Blanchard’s 
situational leadership model (Hersey & Blanchard, 1993), were con-
ceptualized as independent dimensions. Blake and Mouton’s dimen-
sions—production and people—are interdependent, however, and 
represent attitudes more than behavior. They note that leadership is 
not possible without both task and people. We now consider Blake 
and Mouton’s model in more detail.  
 Any manager will have some degree of concern for accomplishing 
the organization’s purpose of producing products or services—that is, 
a concern for production, results, or profits. A manager will also have 
some degree of concern for the people who are involved in helping to 
accomplish the organization’s purpose. Managers may differ in how 
concerned they are with each of these managerial functions, but how 
these two concerns mesh for a given manager determines his or her 
 style or approach to management and defines that manager’s use of 
power.  
 Blake and Mouton chose nine-point scales to depict their model 
and to rank the manager’s degree of concern for production and 
people; 1 represents a low concern and 9 indicates a high concern. 
Although there are 81 possible combinations, Blake and Mouton real-
istically chose to consider only the four more or less extreme positions, 
represented in the four corners of the grid, and the middle-of-the-
road style, position 5,5 in the middle of the grid.  Figure  6.5 illustrates 
the managerial grid and defines each of the five primary styles.  
 As noted earlier, Blake and Mouton contend that communication 
problems in the organization stem from the nature of supervision. The 
predominant style in U.S. organizations today can be characterized as 
5,5 (Blake & Mouton, 1978). A popular book at the time,  The Games-
man (Maccoby, 1976), was a description of Blake and Mouton’s 5,5 
manager. In an unpublished study, a colleague, Barry Render, and 
Burke also found 5,5 to be the predominant style of middle managers 
in a large government agency ( N = 400). This style, according to Blake 
and Mouton, is bureaucratic and mechanistic, thus less than effective, 
especially regarding communication. The  three styles labeled 9,1, 1,9, 

138 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
and 1,1 are even poorer, causing similar, if not worse, communication 
problems. The 9,9 style, then, is best when practiced consistently and 
will assure significantly fewer problems of communication. Training 
managers to adopt a 9,9 style will therefore lead to significantly fewer 
barriers to organizational effectiveness.

 The six phases of Grid Organization Development begin with a 
one-week seminar at which participants assess their present styles 
and learn the behaviors associated with the 9,9 style. Participants also 
receive feedback on their styles from their fellow group members.

 Phase 2 of grid OD is teamwork development. Assessment again 
takes place, to identify the norms and working characteristics of all 
managerial teams in the organization, starting with the top team and 
moving downward in the hierarchy to include the others.  
 Phase 3 is intergroup development. The objective of this phase 
is to reduce win-lose patterns of behavior between groups in the 
organization.  
 Phase 4 is development of an ideal strategic corporate model. 
Essentially what is called corporate strategic planning, this phase 
begins with the development of an ideal strategic organization, usu-
ally done by the top management team.  
 Phase 5 is implementation of the ideal strategic model. This 
phase, similar to what Beckhard and Harris (1987) later called tran-
sition management, consists of moving toward the ideal model in a 
carefully managed, evolutionary manner while continuing to run the 
organization as before.  
 Phase 6 is systematic critique. During this final phase, the change 
effort is evaluated and so-called drag factors are identified. ( Drag fac-
tors are specific barriers that still exist and must now be overcome.)  
 Phases 1–3 are thus designed to deal with communication barri-
ers to organizational effectiveness, and Phases 4–6 deal with the plan-
ning barriers.  
 It is interesting that not until Phase 6 do Blake and Mouton begin 
to deal with an organization diagnostically in terms like those of the 
other diagnostic models we have considered. Blake and Mouton have 
evidently decided that all fairly large organizations that are not already 
involved in OD have serious communication and planning barriers to 
effectiveness. These two primary barriers must be reduced first, and 
grid OD will do the job. At Phase 6, we will see how effectively the 
first five phases have progressed and we will know, in particular and 
in detail, what barriers must now be  tackled.  
 Blake and Mouton never state it, but they apparently assume that, 
unless an organization learns how to communicate more effectively 
(practice 9,9 management) and plan more logically and systematically 
(build an ideal strategic model and begin to implement it), its man-
agement will never be able to deal optimally with the specifics of run-
ning a business. Phase 6 in the grid OD sequence gets to the specifics.

ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Levinson’s Clinical-Historical Approach  
 Levinson’s theory of organization behavior is grounded in psy-
choanalytic theory and views organizations in familial dimensions: 
“An organization is composed of persons in authority and ‘siblings’ 
who relate to these authorities” (Levinson, 1972a, p. 23). Because it 
is so closely aligned with psychoanalytic theory, it is not surprising 
that Levinson’s approach to organizational diagnosis (1972b) is very 
detailed, emphasizes history, and generally relies on clinical methods. 
Using this approach, the consultant does a workup on a client orga-
nization much as a physician would do with a patient and obtains as 
complete a history as possible, especially in terms of how the organi-
zation fits into its environment. In the search of information, Levin-
son suggests:  
 Most newspapers have morgues, or files of clippings, filed by 
subject. Historical societies often have much information on 
file. Large organizations will frequently be the subject of arti-
cles in trade or professional magazines which may be located 
through libraries.... The sheer availability of various kinds of 
information is a datum of diagnostic value (1972a, p. 26).  
 Just as physicians “take a history,” order a blood test, and thump 
the patient’s body here and there, Levinson also stresses observation. 
He notes: “Since the consultant is his own most important instru-
ment, he should begin [by using] his antennae for sensing subtleties” 
(1972a, p. 18). Levinson suggests that the consultant request a tour of 
as much of the organization as time and practicalities permit in order 
to form and record initial impressions. “The consultant will find it 
helpful to keep a diary of his experiences in the company, to record 
events and observations which will not likely be reported  in interviews 
or questionnaires” (1972a, p. 19).  
 Levinson (1972a) relies on six categories of data for diagnosis: 
  
1.  Consultant observations and feelings. Notes on how the 
consultant experiences the organization, especially initial im-
pressions, are recorded and become a set of information for later 
diagnosis.   

 CHAPTER  6 • UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS: THE PROCESS OF DIAGNOSIS  
141
  
2.  Factual data.    Recorded policies and procedures, historical data 
on file in the organization, annual reports, job descriptions, per-
sonnel statistics, and former consultant or task force reports are 
perused. Collecting this information is not enough, according 
to Levinson; analyzing how the data interrelate is important, as 
is the type of language used. The language will convey attitudes 
toward people and assumptions about what motivates employ-
ees.   
  
3.  Outside information. Information is collected, primarily 
through interviews, from the organization’s suppliers and com-
petitors, cooperating organizations, agents, professional asso-
ciations, and the like. This information will help the consultant 
understand the organization’s environment in general and the 
impact it has on the client.  
  
4.  Pattern of organization. The organization chart and the 
authority-responsibility structure of the organization are the 
primary indicators of patterns of organization. Levinson stress-
es a holistic approach rather than a view of the interaction of 
just one or two subsystems.  
  
5.  Settings. According to Levinson, “First overall organizational 
purposes and then how these purposes are subdivided into 
specific functions performed by definable groups within defin-
able temporal and physical space.... The consultant must learn 
where and by whom essential functions of the organization are 
carried out” (1972a, p. 28). Levinson also notes in this context 
what Rice (1958) has called the time dimension: “temporal 
boundaries within which the setting’s central purpose is accom-
plished...such as factory shift work...or...planning activities in a 
management group” (Levinson, 1972a, p. 29).  
  
6.  Task patterns. Group-level variables exist in each setting. 
Levinson cites four such patterns:  
 
•  Complementary activities.  Contributions of each work group 
member toward some common goal  
 
•  Parallel activities. Group members performing essentially 
identical tasks  

142 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 
•  Sequential activities. Group members performing some 
phase of the overall group task  
 
•  Individualized activities.  Unique functions performed by 
each person      
 These patterns constitute a setting, and the consultant attempts to 
learn the setting boundaries by analyzing the task patterns.  
 It is important to note that, although Levinson’s theoretical base 
is psychological and his method of diagnosis is patterned after the 
clinical model, he does not become absorbed in pieces of the system. 
His approach is systemic and holistic. Although he is biased toward 
a Freudian view, he does not lose himself in the analytics but rather 
looks for systemic issues and considers how the organization influ-
ences and is influenced by its environment, how subparts of the orga-
nization relate, and how work flows from one setting, activity, and 
function to another. Thus, being an organizational diagnostician of 
the Levinson school  would require a thorough grounding in psycho-
analytic theory, an understanding of the clinical method of diagnosis, 
and a systems view of organizations that highlights patterns of rela-
tionships and workflow.     
 Conclusion  
 In this chapter, we have considered the diagnostic phase of orga-
nization development consultation in some depth by examining cer-
tain models. These models—Weisbord’s six-box model, Nadler and 
Tushman’s congruence model, Tichy’s TPC framework, Hornstein 
and Tichy’s emergent-pragmatic model, Lawrence and Lorsch’s con-
tingency model, the normative models of Likert and Blake and Mou-
ton, and Levinson’s historical-clinical approach—are not the only 
ones available (see the next chapter, for example). For OD purposes, 
however, they are some of the most relevant ones and they demon-
strate the diversity of the field. There is considerable choice for the 
OD practitioner-consultant.  
 Rarely does one have the time required for using Levin-
son’s approach, although his thoroughness and the systemic-flow 

 CHAPTER  6 • UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS: THE PROCESS OF DIAGNOSIS  
143
perspective are admirable. When time is short and the client is naive 
about systems, Weisbord’s six-box model works well. Nadler and Tush-
man’s model is appealing for some of the same reasons Levinson’s is, 
but it is easier to work with and easier to communicate to a client. 
Tichy’s framework is fairly easy to understand, yet somewhat complex 
in use. Hornstein and Tichy’s approach is very useful for clients who 
are concerned that a consultant might impose something on them, 
and it is useful  for setting the stage for in-depth diagnosis. Lawrence 
and Lorsch’s contingency model is often the most popular one among 
OD practitioners, and with good reason. It emphasizes organizational 
structure, which was overlooked by OD people in the early days, and 
shows how the organization’s environment has an internal impact. 
Likert’s and Blake and Mouton’s theories are appealing because they 
clearly show the way, but if their approaches are chosen, they must 
be followed completely; a partial application will not work. Their 
high degree of structure and their normative view turns away some 
OD practitioners. Under certain circumstances, however, both may  
be useful—Likert’s profile for providing an outside, more objective 
questionnaire assessment of an organization, and Blake and Mouton’s 
grid for providing a framework for examining managerial style in the 
organization.  
 An OD practitioner’s choice from among these models should be 
based primarily on three considerations. First, it is difficult to use a 
model effectively if you do not understand it. Second, the practitioner 
should feel comfortable with the model and its approach. If the prac-
titioner does not really believe in participative management, using 
Likert’s or Blake and Mouton’s approach is not likely to be successful, 
for example. Third, the model should match the level of sophistica-
tion of the client; that is, when working with a complex organization, 
the practitioner should choose a model that adequately represents its 
complexity.  
 As the following chapter shows, we have one more model to con-
sider. As the chapter also shows, Litwin and Burke have tried to learn 
from many of the models and theories that have preceded their orga-
nizational performance and change framework.

 The Burke-Litwin Model of 
Organizational Performance and Change  1 
 In presenting this causal model (therefore a normative view, 
Burke & Litwin, 1992) we are attempting to provide yet another per-
spective, and at the same time demonstrate that this more recent 
framework captures some of the best qualities of previous models. 
As does Tichy in the technical political cultural (TPC) framework, 
this model takes certain positions about organization change and thus 
 predicts behavior and performance consequences and therefore 
deals with cause (organizational conditions) and effect (resultant 
performance).  
 Important background regarding the development of the model 
(the concepts of organizational climate and culture) is presented first, 
followed by a description of the model. Finally, suggestions for ways 
to use the model as well as case examples are provided.  
 Background  
 Climate  
 The original thinking underlying the model came from George 
Litwin and others during the 1960s. In 1967, the Harvard Business 
School sponsored a conference on organizational climate. Results of 
this conference were subsequently published in two books (Litwin 
& Stringer, 1968; Tagiuri & Litwin, 1968). The concept of organiza-
tional climate that emerged from this series of studies and papers was 
that of a psychological state strongly affected by organizational condi-
tions, such as systems, structure, and managerial behavior. In their 

146 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
theory paper, Tagiuri and Litwin (1968) emphasized that there could 
be no universal set of dimensions or properties for organizational cli-
mate.  They argued that one could describe climate along different 
dimensions, depending on the kind of organization being studied and 
the aspects of human behavior involved. They described climate as 
a molar, synthetic, or changeable construct. Further, the kind of cli-
mate construct they described was relatively malleable; it could be 
modified by managerial behavior and by systems and strongly influ-
enced by more enduring group norms and values.  
 This early research and theory development regarding organi-
zational climate clearly linked psychological and organizational vari-
ables in a cause-effect model that was empirically testable. Using the 
model, Litwin and Stringer (1968) were able to predict and to control 
the motivational and performance consequences of various organiza-
tional climates established in their research experiment.  
 Culture  
 The concept of organizational culture is drawn from anthropol-
ogy and is used to describe the relatively enduring set of values and 
norms that underlie a social system. These may not be entirely con-
scious. (Elaboration on this point is the theme of  Chapter  8 , “Under-
standing Organizations: Covert Processes.”) Rather, they constitute a 
“meaning system” that allows members of a social system to attribute 
meaning and value to the variety of external and internal events they 
experience. Such underlying values and meaning systems change only 
as continued culture is applied to generations of individuals in that 
social system.  
 The distinction between climate and culture must be very explicit 
because this model attempts to describe both climate and culture in 
terms of their interactions with other organizational variables. Thus, 
this model builds on earlier research and theory with regard to pre-
dicting motivation and performance effects.  
 In addition, the variables that influence and are influenced by 
climate need to be distinguished from those influenced by culture. 
Thus, there are two distinct sets of organizational dynamics. One set 
primarily is associated with the transactional level of human behavior 

 
CHAPTER  7 • THE BURKE-LITWIN MODEL OF ORGANIZATIONAL 
147
 
PERFORMANCE AND CHANGE
or the everyday interactions and exchanges that create the climate. 
The second set of dynamics is concerned with processes of human 
transformation; that is, sudden “leaps” in behavior. These transforma-
tional processes are required for genuine change in the culture of an 
organization. Efforts to distinguish transactional and transformational 
dynamics in organizations have been influenced by the writings of 
James  McGregor Burns (1978) and by consultants’ efforts to change 
organizations.    
 The Model  
 The Burke-Litwin model has been refined through a series of 
studies directed by Burke (Bernstein & Burke, 1989; Fox, 1990; 
Michela et al., 1988). Later collaboration led to the current form of 
this model, which attempts to:  
  
1.  Specify the interrelationships of organizational variables 
  
2.  Distinguish transformational and transactional dynamics in 
organizational behavior and change  
 Figure  7.1 summarizes the model. 
 In accordance with accepted thinking about organizations from 
general systems theory (Katz & Kahn, 1978), the external environ-
ment box represents the input and the individual and organizational 
performance box represents the output. Feedback loops go in both 
directions. The remaining boxes of the model represent the through-
put aspect of general systems theory.  
 The model is complex, as is the rich intricacy of organizational 
phenomena. However, this model, exhibited two-dimensionally, is still 
an oversimplification; a hologram would be a better representation.  
 Arrows in both directions convey the open-systems principle that 
change in one factor will eventually have an impact on the others. 
Moreover, if the model could be diagrammed so that the arrows were 
circular (as they would be in a hologram), reality could be represented 
more accurately. Yet this is a  causal model. For example, although 
culture and systems affect one another, culture has a stronger influ-
ence on systems than vice versa.  

148 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 The model could be displayed differently. External environment 
could be on the left and performance on the right, with all throughput 
boxes in between, as with the Nadler–Tushman model (see  Chap-
ter  6 , “Understanding Organizations: The Process of Diagnosis”). 
However, displaying it as shown makes a statement about organiza-
tional change: Organizational change stems more from environmental 
impact than from any other factor. Moreover, with respect to organi-
zational change, the variables of strategy, leadership, and culture have 
more “weight” than the variables of structure, management practices,

and systems; that is, having leaders communicate the new strategy is 
not sufficient for effective change.  Changing culture must be planned 
as well as aligned with strategy and leader behavior. How the model 
is displayed does not dictate where change could start; however, it 
does indicate the weighting of change dynamics. The reader can think 
of the model in terms of gravity, with the push toward performance 
being in the weighted order displayed in  Figure   7.1 . 
 In summary, the model, as shown in  Figure  7.1 , portrays the 
following:  
 
•  The primary variables that need to be considered in any 
attempt to predict and explain the total behavioral output of an 
organization   
 
•  The most important interactions among these variables 
 
•  The ways the variables affect change 
 Transformational and Transactional Dynamics  
 The concept of transformational change in organizations is sug-
gested by such writers as Bass (1985), Burke (1986), Burns (1978), 
McClelland (1975), and Tichy and Devanna (1986).  Figure  7.2 dis-
plays the transformational variables (the upper half of the model). 
 Transformational refers to areas in which alteration is likely caused by 
interaction with environmental forces (both within and without) and 
which require entirely new behavior sets on the part of organizational 
members.

 Figure  7.3 shows the transactional variables (the lower half of the 
model). These variables are very similar to those originally isolated by 
Litwin and Stringer (1968) and later by Michela et al. (1988). They are 
 transactional in that alteration occurs primarily via relatively short-
term reciprocity among people and groups. In other words, “You do 
this for me, and I’ll do that for you.”

 Each category or box in the model can be described as follows: 
 
•   External environment.  Any outside condition or situation that 
influences the performance of the organization. These condi-
tions include such things as marketplaces, world financial con-
ditions, political/governmental circumstances, and so on.  
 
•   Mission and strategy.  What employees believe is the central 
purpose of the organization and how the organization intends 
to achieve that purpose over an extended time.  
 
•   Leadership.  Executive behavior that provides direction and 
encourages others to take needed action. For purposes of data 
gathering, this box includes perceptions of executive practices 
and values.  

 
CHAPTER  7 • THE BURKE-LITWIN MODEL OF ORGANIZATIONAL 
151
 
PERFORMANCE AND CHANGE
 
•   Culture.   “The way we do things around here.” Culture is the 
collection of overt and covert rules, values, and principles that 
guide organizational behavior and that have been strongly influ-
enced by history, custom, and practice.  
 
•   Structure.   The arrangement of functions and people into 
specific areas and levels of responsibility, decision-making 
authority, and relationships. Structure assures effective imple-
mentation of the organization’s mission and strategy.   
 
•   Management practices.  What managers do in the normal course 
of events to use the human and material resources at their dis-
posal to carry out the organization’s strategy.  
 
•   Systems.   Standardized policies and mechanisms that are 
designed to facilitate work. Systems primarily manifest them-
selves in the organization’s reward systems and in control 
systems, such as the organization’s management information 
system, goal and budget development, and human resource 
allocation.   
 
•   Climate.  The collective current impressions, expectations, and 
feelings of the members of local work units. These in turn affect 
members’ relations with supervisors, with one another, and 
with other units.  
 
•   Task requirements and individual skills/abilities.  The behav-
ior required for task effectiveness, including specific skills and 
knowledge required for people to accomplish the work assigned 
and for which they feel directly responsible. This box concerns 
what is often referred to as job-person match.  
 
•   Individual needs and values.   The specific psychological factors 
that provide desire and worth for individual actions or thoughts.  
 
•   Motivation.  Aroused behavioral tendencies to move toward 
goals, take needed action, and persist until satisfaction is 
attained. This is the net resultant motivation; that is, the resul-
tant net energy generated by the sum of achievement, power, 
affection, discovery, and other important human motives.  
 
•   Individual and organizational performance.   The outcomes or 
results, with indicators of effort and achievement. Such indica-
tors might include productivity, customer or staff satisfaction, 
profit, and service quality.  

152 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Climate Results from Transactions; Culture Change 
Requires Transformation  
 In the causal model, day-to-day climate is a result of transactions 
related to issues such as the following:  
 
•   Sense of direction.  The effect of mission clarity, or lack thereof, 
on one’s daily responsibilities  
 
•   Role and responsibility.  The effect of structure, reinforced by 
managerial practice  
 
•   Standards and commitment.  The effect of managerial practice, 
reinforced by culture  
 
•   Fairness of rewards.  The effect of systems, reinforced by mana-
gerial practice  
 
•   Focus on customer versus internal pressures or standards of 
excellence.  The effect of culture, reinforced by other variables 
 In contrast, the concept of organizational culture has to do with 
those underlying values and meaning systems that are difficult to 
manage, to alter, and even to be realized completely (Schein, 1992). 
Moreover, instant change in culture seems to be a contradiction in 
terms. By definition, those things that can be changed quickly are not 
the underlying reward systems but the behaviors that are attached to 
the meaning systems. It is relatively easy to alter superficial human 
behavior; it is undoubtedly quite difficult to alter something uncon-
scious that is hidden in symbols and mythology and that functions 
as the fabric  helping an organization to remain together, intact, and 
viable. To change something so deeply embedded in organizational 
life does indeed require transformational experiences and events.  
 Using the Model: Data Gathering and Analysis  
 Distinguishing transformational and transactional thinking about 
organizations has implications for planning organizational change. 
Unless one is conducting an overall organizational diagnosis, prelimi-
nary interviews will result in enough information to construct a fairly 
targeted survey. Survey targets would be determined from the inter-
views and, most likely, would be focused on either transformational 

 
CHAPTER  7 • THE BURKE-LITWIN MODEL OF ORGANIZATIONAL 
153
 
PERFORMANCE AND CHANGE
or transactional issues. Transformational issues call for a survey that 
probes mission and strategy, leadership, culture, and performance. 
Transactional issues need a focus on structure, systems, management 
practices, climate, and performance. Other transactional probes 
might involve motivation, including task requirements (job-person 
match) and individual needs and values. For example,  parts or all of 
“The Job Diagnostic Survey” (Hackman & Oldham, 1980) might be 
appropriate.  
 An organization development (OD) consultant helping to man-
age change would conduct preliminary interviews with, say, 15 to 
30 representative individuals in the organization. If, on the other 
hand, the organization is a loosely coupled system (see  Chapter  10 , 
“Understanding and Changing Loosely Coupled Systems”) such as a 
network, then all individuals need to be interviewed. If a summary 
of these interviews revealed that significant organizational change 
was needed, additional data would be collected related to the top or 
transformational part of  Figure  7.1 . Note that in major organizational 
change, transformational variables represent the primary levers, those 
areas in which change  must be focused. The following examples rep-
resent transformational change (concentrated at the top of the model, 
as illustrated in  Figure   7.2   ):  
  
1.  An acquisition in which the acquired organization’s culture, 
leadership, and business strategy are dramatically different 
from those of the acquiring organization (even if both organi-
zations are in the same industry), thereby necessitating a new, 
merged organization (for an example of how the model has 
been used to facilitate a merger, see Burke & Jackson, 1991).  
  
2.  A federal agency in which the mission has been modified and 
the structure and leadership changed significantly, yet the cul-
ture remains in the past.  
  
3.  A high-tech firm whose leadership has changed recently and 
is perceived negatively, whose strategy is unclear, and whose 
internal politics have moved from minimal (before) to predomi-
nant (after). The hue and cry here is “We have no direction 
from our leaders and no culture to guide our behavior in the 
meantime.”    

154 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 For an organization in which the presenting problem is more 
a fine-tuning or improving process, the second layer of the model 
(shown in  Figure  7.3 ) serves as the point of concentration. Examples 
include changes in the organization’s structure; modification of the 
reward system; management development (perhaps in the form of 
a program that concentrates on behavioral practices); or the admin-
istration of a climate survey to measure job stratification, job clarity, 
degree of teamwork, and so on.  
 It is also useful to consider the model in a vertical manner. For 
example, Bernstein and Burke (1989) examined the causal chain of 
culture, management practices, and climate in a large manufacturing 
organization. In this case, feedback to executives showed how and to 
what degree cultural variables influenced management practices and, 
in turn, work-unit climate (the dependent variable).  
 The change effort at British Airways (BA) is a good example of an 
organization in which practically all boxes of the Burke-Litwin model 
were eventually examined and changed. The model provided a frame-
work for executives and managers in BA to understand the massive 
change they were attempting to manage. To understand the model 
in use a bit more as well as to consider a significant example of large 
system change, let us review the change in BA.  
 Change at British Airways  
 Prior to 1987 and practically since World War II (although two 
organizations for most of that time period), British Airways (BA) was 
a government organization, the product of a merger between Brit-
ish European Airways (BEA) and British Overseas Airways Corpora-
tion (BOAC) in the early 1970s. These two organizations had in turn 
been spawned from Britain’s Royal Air Force. The BA of 1983, when 
Colin Marshall arrived as president and CEO, operated largely as a 
function of its history, rather like the military, and was draining the 
British treasury with financial losses year after year. Moreover, pas-
sengers referred to BA as  “bloody awful.” Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher had decided earlier that BA was to be privatized and had 
brought in Lord John King, a successful businessman, to be chairman. 
King recruited Marshall from Avis Rent-A-Car in 1983 and gave him 

 
CHAPTER  7 • THE BURKE-LITWIN MODEL OF ORGANIZATIONAL 
155
 
PERFORMANCE AND CHANGE
the charge and the authority to change BA so that it could survive 
privatization.  
 In addition to the external environmental force on British Airways 
by Prime Minister Thatcher and her government administration, 
another key environmental change was the growing deregulation of 
international air traffic—many air fares were no longer set by govern-
ments but instead by the marketplace.  
 Internally, BA had to change its mission and strategy as well as 
its corporate culture. BA’s mission was to serve with distinction as 
the United Kingdom’s flagship airline and strategically to compete 
both domestically and internationally. The mission and strategy would 
need to change more toward the customer and BA would need to 
become much more competitive. The culture would need to be trans-
formed from one described as bureaucratic and militaristic to one 
that was service oriented and market driven.  
 Let us now consider the changes that took place in BA’s mission 
and strategy, leadership, and culture, in other words the transforma-
tional changes:  
 
•   Mission and strategy.  To make BA more competitive and to 
reduce costs, the first step Marshall took was to reduce the size 
of the workforce from about 59,000 to 37,000. The downsizing 
was done with a certain amount of compassion via primarily 
early retirements with substantial financial settlements. Mar-
shall’s background was marketing in a service industry and he 
began to change BA’s strategy accordingly. BA was to become 
“The World’s Favourite Airline” with a strong emphasis on the 
customer by providing superior service.  
 
•   Leadership.  Of course the major change here was the hiring of 
Marshall. He in turn hired Nicholas Georgiades, a psycholo-
gist and former professor and consultant, as head of human 
resources (HR). Georgiades developed the specific tactics and 
programs required to bring about the culture change. Gordon 
Dunlop led the way financially via his position as chief finan-
cial officer. He was indispensable in transforming the account-
ing and financial functions from a government orientation to 
one that helped managers to understand competition and the 
marketplace.   

156 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 
•   Culture.  Led by Georgiades, a series of programs and activities 
were developed to shift the culture from too much bureaucracy 
to a real service orientation. The first program was called “Put-
ting People First.” “Aimed at helping line workers and manag-
ers understand the service nature of the airline industry, it was 
intended to challenge the prevailing wisdom about how things 
were to be done at BA” (Goodstein & Burke, 1991, p. 12).  
 The next steps were to focus even more intensely on the culture. 
Georgiades conceptualized the process metaphorically as a “three-
legged stool.” The seat was the new, desired culture (customer-service 
oriented) and the three legs were (1) the “Managing People First” 
(MPF) program, a five-day residential experience to help managers 
learn about how to manage their people in such a way (more par-
ticipatively, for example) that they would be more service oriented; 
(2) a performance appraisal where half of a manager’s evaluation was 
based on results and half on  how the results were achieved, the how 
being an incorporation of the behaviors  and practices emphasized in 
the MPF program; and (3) pay for performance, rewarding managers 
according to how they were rated in (2) above.  
 In addition to these interventions primarily targeted at manage-
ment, a five-day residential training program was conducted for all 
human resource people in BA. This program concentrated on consul-
tation skills to enhance the HR people’s abilities to help line managers 
to apply what they had learned in the MPF program.  
 Part of the rationale for concentrating on managers in the early 
stages of the culture change was based on the research work of Ben 
Schneider. In a series of studies (Schneider, 1980, 1990; Schneider 
& Bowen, 1985), he has demonstrated that how frontline people in 
a service business (in his case, banks; therefore, tellers, loan officers) 
are treated by their respective supervisors has a differential effect on 
customer satisfaction. In bank branches where frontline employees 
were managed more participatively as opposed to bureaucratically—
following procedures strictly, for example—customer satisfaction was 
significantly higher. With British Airways being a service business, 
we applied  this same principle. You do not have to teach cabin crew 
members or ticket agents how to smile. Rather you need to teach man-
agers about how to manage these frontline people so that smiles come

157
 
PERFORMANCE AND CHANGE
naturally by their desire to treat customers with respect and enthu-
siasm. The MPF program was therefore designed and conducted to 
help managers to manage more participatively, openly, respectfully, 
enthusiastically, and with greater trust in their subordinates. Manag-
ers cannot manage the myriad of hour-by-hour contacts that employ-
ees who have direct contact with customers encounter every day, 
those 50,000 “moments of truth” as Jan Carlzon, another successful  
airline CEO, described in his popular book (Carlzon, 1987). Manag-
ers can, however, work with their subordinates in an involving man-
ner that will in turn have a positive effect on customers.  
 In summary, because the BA change was clearly fundamental and 
transformational in nature, concentrating on the top three boxes of 
the Burke-Litwin model that were changed in response to external 
environment demands was the appropriate approach to take. Sub-
sequently, efforts were concentrated on (1) the climate via team-
building processes, (2) support systems by modifying, for example, 
rewards (pay for performance) and, as noted above, (3) training all 
human resource people in consulting skills to help managers apply 
what they had learned in the MPF program.  
 For a more detailed description of the history behind the BA 
change and a brief overview of the change effort, see the case by Lea-
hey and Kotter (1990). Goodstein and Burke (1991) as well as Burke 
(2014b) have provided a more comprehensive analysis of the change 
process itself at BA.  
 That BA has changed is now a matter of record (Goodstein & 
Burke, 1991). It became one of the most profitable airlines in the 
world and its significantly improved service meant that passengers 
considered it “bloody awesome” rather than “bloody awful” (see the 
article by Power in  Business Week , October 9, 1989; 97). 
 Considering the Burke-Litwin model from a vertical perspective 
entails hypothesizing causal effects and assuming that the “weight” 
of change is top-down; that is, the heaviest or most influential orga-
nizational dimensions for change are external environment, first and 
foremost, and then mission/strategy, leadership, and culture.  
 It is interesting to note that executives and managers typically 
concern themselves with the left side of the model illustrated in  Fig-
ure  7.1 : mission and strategy, structure, and task requirements and 

158 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
individual skills or abilities. In contrast, behavioral scientists are more 
likely to be concerned with the right side and middle of  Figure  7.1 : 
leadership, culture, systems (especially rewards), management prac-
tices, climate, individual needs and values, and motivation. For a fun-
damental, large system change effort, one should be concerned with 
the entire model and with a more effective integration of purpose and 
practice.  
 As with other models, the Burke-Litwin model has its limitations. 
For example, the model does not explicitly account for technology, 
the organization’s technical strengths, those core competencies that 
make it competitive in the marketplace, or effective in accomplishing 
its mission. Because technology largely pervades the entire organi-
zation, displaying the Burke-Litwin model three-dimensionally with 
technology as the third dimension might improve its validity.  
 Conclusion  
 Provided we do not allow ourselves to be trapped by a particular 
model, and as a consequence “not see” certain, critical information 
about an organization, using a model for diagnosis is highly beneficial. 
A sufficiently comprehensive model can help us to organize data into 
useful categories and to see more easily and quickly domains in the 
organization that need attention. Choosing the model should depend 
on at least three criteria. First, the model should be one that you as a 
practitioner thoroughly understand and feel comfortable with as you 
work with organizational members. Second, the model you choose 
should fit the client organization as closely as possible—that is, be 
comprehensive enough to cover as many aspects of the organization 
as appropriate, yet be simple and clear enough for organizational 
members to grasp fairly quickly. Third, the model should be one suf-
ficiently comprehensive to allow you to gather your data about the 
organization according to the model’s parameters without missing key 
bits of information.  
 This chapter, along with  Chapter  6 , covered organizational diag-
nosis by examining models and theories that can help to summa-
rize considerable data and point the way for important organization

PERFORMANCE AND CHANGE
change. These models and theories have been largely rational, a delib-
erate and overt way of understanding an organization. Yet we know 
that the reality of organizational dynamics is not by any stretch of 
one’s imagination exclusively rational. Much of an organization’s cul-
ture is below the surface buried within the collective unconscious of 
organizational members. To be thorough and subsequently effective 
with our organizational diagnosis, we must therefore examine both 
the rational and  irrational, overt and covert, and what is apparent and 
transparent and what is not obvious. In other words, we must under-
stand what is below the surface, not discussed, and perhaps avoided. 
We now address this other perspective in the following chapter.

 Understanding Organizations: 
Covert Processes  1 
 As a result of a failed organizational change initiative, my col-
leagues and I (Noumair, Winderman, & Burke, 2010) argued for 
combining group relations and organization development in the prac-
tice of organizational consultation. Although tension exists between 
these approaches, we nonetheless made the case for the importance 
of organizational consultation practice that combines more deeply 
these two theoretical perspectives. OD models and frameworks alone 
are not always sufficient to surface underlying forces that influence 
the behavior of individuals, groups, and entire systems. Although 
attending to covert processes has long been an aspect of OD work, the 
aim of this chapter is  to present a conceptual framework in addition to 
the ones discussed in  Chapters  6 and  7 , “Understanding Organiza-
tions: The Process of Diagnosis” and “The Burke-Litwin Model of 
Organizational Performance and Change,” respectively, that incorpo-
rates elements of group relations and OD, and to demonstrate through 
a case analysis what blending the two can look like in actual practice.  
 Having defined the client, presented selected OD models, and 
the Burke-Litwin model of organizational performance and change, 
the purpose of this chapter is to expand our understanding of diagno-
sis by including covert processes in organizational life. Thus, we intro-
duce what we refer to as “Beneath the Surface of the Burke-Litwin 
Model” and show how attending to both sides of the model can con-
tribute to a deeper understanding of an organization, and a way of 
practicing that allows clients the possibility of approaching, and dis-
cussing, what heretofore may have been out of awareness and consid-
ered “undiscussable.”  

162 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Combining Group Relations and Organization 
Development  
 A conceptual framework for consulting to organizations that 
builds on group relations principles and practice consists of three 
components: psychodynamic theory, group-as-a-whole level of analy-
sis, and social-structural concepts. We discuss each component sepa-
rately and show how they are integrated into a coherent practice of 
organization consultation applied to a case study.  
 Psychodynamic theory (Gould, 2004; Hirschhorn, 1988; Obhol-
zer & Roberts, 1994) is a lens for understanding covert aspects of 
organizational life. In addition to rational processes in organizational 
life, irrational and emotional forces are in operation and also influ-
ence the dynamics between the consultant and client. To make use 
of psychodynamic theory, one must consider that social systems have 
unconscious dynamics that can shape behavior but that are beyond 
the awareness of individuals as well as a group or system as a whole. 
Attending to unconscious influences and irrational behavior requires 
a shift in mind-set regarding what counts as data when analyzing or 
consulting to a system. This broader definition of data includes ele-
ments beyond what can be observed, counted, and measured, includ-
ing what is invisible and intangible, what is not said, as well as what 
is said, and what is felt and experienced in the relationship between 
organizational client and consultant.  
 By employing psychodynamic theory in organizational consulta-
tion, systems can be viewed as having greater capacity for complex-
ity and behavior determined by multiple factors, some conscious and 
rational, some unconscious and irrational. A psychodynamic analysis 
of an organization entails the study of its choice of defense mecha-
nisms. Hirschhorn (1988) provides an in-depth discussion of the use 
of defense mechanisms in organizational life, identifying three forms 
of social defense: the basic assumption, the covert coalition, and the 
organizational ritual. Identifying these three forms of social defense 
can provide relevant information for the consultant, and ultimately, 
for the organization in its effort to  understand itself.  
 A group-as-a-whole level of analysis (Wells, 1995) is one way to 
uncover social defenses as it answers the question of why individuals 

 
CHAPTER  8 • UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS: COVERT PROCESSES 
163
can act differently as members of groups and organizations than they 
do when acting solely on their own behalf. It provides a framework 
for understanding how individuals, subgroups, and entire organiza-
tions participate in maintaining an organizational “problem.” Uncon-
scious group processes provide evidence for collusion among group 
members and connect individual and group behavior (Wells, 1995). 
When a consultant takes a group-as-a-whole perspective, she consid-
ers behavior at multiple levels and as such may uncover a problem’s 
root. Although she  may not make her discovery explicit, she uses the 
information to develop interventions aimed at addressing the uncon-
scious collusion among group members.  
 In addition, a group-as-a-whole level of analysis offers the idea that 
individuals can serve as “containers” for various parts of the group or 
organization’s emotional life—“serviceable others” (Morrison, 1992), 
compartments for painful, unwanted feelings, such as incompetence, 
in order for others in the organization to be viewed as competent or 
“stars.” Processes of splitting and projection, and in particular projec-
tive identification, when occurring at the group level, create what is 
known as  role lock  whereby individuals are used to “contain” various 
components of the group’s emotional life (Wells, 1995).  
 Individuals enter groups with valency (Bion, 1961), a predisposi-
tion based on background, personality, and social identities to carry 
certain emotions and attitudes. Recipients of projections must have 
valency to receive those particular projections. One useful metaphor 
for understanding valency is  Velcro. When one has a predisposition 
for specific attributes or feelings, we say that the person has Velcro 
for those projections and therefore the projections “stick” more easily. 
When one does not have a predisposition for specific projections, we 
say the person has  Teflon —the projections “slide” off. The metaphors 
of Velcro and Teflon enable individuals and groups to understand 
how  role  lock can occur as such unconscious processes are not readily 
observable and measurable and therefore are challenging to compre-
hend in organizational settings.  
 Although we use psychodynamic theory and a group-as-a-whole 
level of analysis to uncover what is below the surface of organizational 
life, our approach also borrows from open systems theory (Miller & 
Rice, 1967), Gould’s (2004) Systems Psychodynamic organizational 

164 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
consultation, Schein’s work on organizational culture (2004) and 
process consultation (1988, 1999), and Marshak’s (2006) model for 
addressing hidden dimensions of organizational change, all directed 
toward removing impediments to healthy and effective organizational 
life. This approach and these concepts are especially useful when 
responding to resistance and ambivalence related to organization 
change as they equip the consultant with effective tools to address  
underlying concerns that might not be immediately manifest (Gould, 
2004; Hirschhorn, 1988; Krantz, 2001). My (Noumair) work with the 
case study presented in this chapter reflects an integration of these 
approaches all aimed at employing group dynamics and group rela-
tions concepts in service of more effective practice in organizational 
consultation.  
 To identify and confront unconscious group processes in organi-
zational life, our approach to consultation begins with social-structural 
concepts known collectively as BART (Boundary, Authority, Role, 
and Task) (Green & Molenkamp, 2005). Boundaries can be defined 
as physical or psychological discontinuities separating a system from 
its environment; they must be strong enough to maintain the integrity 
of what is inside but permeable enough to allow transactions between 
inside and outside. Authority is understood as the right to do work in 
service of the task and can be both formal and informal. Authority is 
related to role in that organizational authority accompanies  formal, 
rational work roles; that is, authority is delegated to individuals to 
carry out the responsibilities of formal work roles of the organization. 
Authority for informal roles, in contrast, can be assumed by individu-
als, based on personality or valency (“Velcro”), to contain anxiety on 
the part of others in the organization. Task is the primary reason a 
group exists and while there are different kinds of tasks, clarity about 
the purpose of the group is essential to understanding it as a social 
system. Using BART as a diagnostic tool enables organizational mem-
bers to consider emotional and other sub rosa factors  that may affect, 
distort, or obscure rational structural features of an organization. 
Besides its diagnostic benefits, BART can also serve as an antidote to 
irrational dynamics in groups and assist in the management of projec-
tive processes in organizations.  

 
CHAPTER  8 • UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS: COVERT PROCESSES 
165
 A framework known collectively as GRPI (Goals, Roles, Processes, 
Interpersonal relationships) (Beckhard, 1972; Burke, 1988, 1994) is 
another useful tool for intervention and is similar to BART in that 
its components are usually more familiar to organizational members 
than are psychodynamic concepts. Lack of clarity about goals, roles 
and responsibilities, and processes and procedures often contributes 
to increased anxiety, which can produce difficulties in interpersonal 
relationships.  
 Often organization consultation is sought because of poor rela-
tions among its members as well as the quality of relatedness across 
subsystems—both of which interfere with an organization’s capac-
ity to produce high-quality work. Employing the GRPI framework 
(Beckhard, 1972; Burke, 1988, 1994), a consultant would not begin by 
addressing interpersonal relationships, however, because these diffi-
culties in relationships would be viewed as symptoms and not as root 
causes. Rather, a consultant would employ GRPI in a hierarchical 
fashion initially assessing whether everyone was clear about organiza-
tional goals and purposes. Once alignment among organization mem-
bers regarding the organizational mission was apparent, a consultant 
would work on clarifying roles and responsibilities, followed by help-
ing the group to establish processes and procedures for collaboration. 
Usually once goals, roles, and processes are clarified, interpersonal 
tensions decrease in importance, or even disappear.  
 Organization members respond similarly to the frameworks of 
GRPI and BART, as both provide a way of understanding group and 
organization dynamics that are more recognizable and customary 
than a discussion of unconscious processes and irrationality in group 
and organizational life.  
 Employing this model, comprised of psychodynamic theory, a 
group-as-a-whole level of analysis, and social-structural concepts, 
allows consultants to take up an “interpretive stance” (Shapiro & Carr, 
1991), searching for understanding without being judgmental either 
of their clients or of themselves. Second, sensitivity to group process 
in addition to content (Schein, 1988, 1999) enables early diagnosis 
of those group dynamics that may impede group functioning. This 
approach sets the stage for considering links between often uncon-
scious emotional processes, group development, and organizational 
behavior.  

166 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Although psychodynamic theory, a group-as-a-whole level of 
analysis, and social-structural concepts represent the main compo-
nents of this approach, other conceptual frameworks, theories, tools, 
and even language are necessary for intervention with organizations. 
We have learned of the need to transform psychodynamic conceptu-
alizations into “client-friendly” language. One cannot discuss uncon-
scious and irrational processes without—at least initially—linking the 
ideas to more familiar concepts. When trying to influence a client at 
the beginning of an engagement, it is not wise to use language related 
to the unconscious as it conjures up negative and fearful images of 
psychoanalysis, psychotherapy, and irrationality and a journey into the 
realm of deep emotionality. As a result, this approach should only 
rarely be used alone; it is best utilized in conjunction with other orga-
nizational models and frameworks. However, despite these cautions, 
it is an approach that tends to gradually appeal to clients once they 
have had the opportunity to experience its impact. Although at first 
organization members may feel the approach is off point, eventually 
they come to understand how the conscious and unconscious, rational 
and irrational, overt and covert are inextricably linked to the more 
prosaic problems they are experiencing.  
 Beneath the Surface of the Burke-Litwin Model  
 As discussed in  Chapter  7 , a well-established organization devel-
opment model whose content is more familiar to organization mem-
bers is the Burke-Litwin model of organizational performance and 
change (1992). The model—a well-suited companion to the psycho-
dynamic approach—represents a more rational, linear way to think 
about organizations and, as such, organization clients are less threat-
ened by it. The model serves as a point of departure for organization 
development as it allows clients to visualize the ways in which various 
components of organizations are connected and interact.  
 As shown in  Figure  8.1 , the top portion of the model contains 
transformational boxes (external environment, mission and strategy, 
leadership, and organization culture) and the bottom portion of the 
model contains transactional boxes (management practices, structure, 
systems, work unit climate, motivation, individual needs and values,

167
individual skills and abilities, and individual and organizational per-
formance). Organizations accomplish macro-organization change by 
focusing on the transformational (top) boxes of the model and micro-
organization change is achieved by focusing on the transactional (bot-
tom) boxes of the model. Based on open systems theory, the arrows 
between boxes depict how change in one part of the  organization can 
affect change in another part of the organization.

 Figure 8.1  The Burke-Litwin Model—Organizational Performance and Change 
 Interestingly, although the Burke-Litwin model also serves as a 
guide for intervention in an organization change process, it does not 
always provide a lens for examining why 70 percent of change efforts 
fail (Burke, 2011a). Understanding such failures requires consider-
ation of the challenges encountered in sustaining change (Burke, 
2014b) and various forms of resistance that can arise in organiza-
tions (Piderit, 2000). An approach informed by the combination of 
psychodynamic theory, group-as-a-whole level of analysis, and social-
structural concepts provides a particularly probing model for doing so. 
In effect, one can imagine that obscuring the Burke-Litwin model’s 

168 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
boxes and arrows are veils,  which must be removed in order to reveal, 
diagnose, and respond to covert processes that may be interfering 
with an organization’s change efforts.  
 As depicted in  Figure  8.2 , beneath the surface of the Burke-
Litwin model lie what may be unconscious and irrational aspects of an 
organization. For example, an overt conflict between two individuals 
may appear rational on the surface but might also be evidence of com-
petitive dynamics related to leadership succession; that is, power and 
authority issues and unspoken conflict beneath the surface. Or, a team 
may act less competent than it actually is on the surface as evidence of 
performance anxiety and fear of making a mistake under the surface. 
When considering what lies beneath the Burke-Litwin model, as was 
the  case in  Chapter  7 , it is important to visualize the model as a holo-
gram, a three-dimensional illustration in which it is possible to see 
what is on top of and underneath the model simultaneously.

by psychodynamic theory, a group-as-a-whole level of analysis, and 
social-structural concepts in combination with the use of the Burke-
Litwin model of organization performance and change and beneath 
the surface of the Burke-Litwin model contributed to organizational 
culture change and facilitated leadership succession—an example of 
how removing the veils allowed the consultant and the client system 
to access covert processes that lie beneath the surface.  
 Initial Phase  
 The head of the Luminary Institute (a pseudonym for a think 
tank) had called me (Noumair), seeking consultation because of con-
cern about two managers on his leadership team. He wanted to dis-
cuss the possibility of my providing coaching for them, although he 
was worried about singling them out because the organization was 
relatively small and “everyone knew everything.”  
 Beyond hearing this presenting symptom, I noted to myself how 
defensive, withholding, and anxious the executive seemed during the 
conversation. Each suggestion I made was met with “no” for an answer. 
Although he said that he wanted consultation, he was emphatic that 
the “problem” to be addressed was at the individual level and distinct 
from any organizational-level phenomenon. The initial conversation 
ended with my feeling discouraged and trapped. How could I take the 
case given that it was clear from this initial contact that I would never 
please him? What help could I provide?  
 The next meeting I had was with the head of the institute and his 
deputy and it was similar to my phone conversation. He said no to all 
of the solutions I suggested, including coaching the managers individ-
ually and working with the two of them as a pair. Finally, toward the 
end of the meeting, I offered a system intervention, saying that often 
individuals carry symptoms on behalf of the organization and that 
what was going on with these two managers might be symptomatic of 
larger systemic issues. I asked them to tell me about the functioning 
of the leadership  team. They were intrigued with this interpretation 
and we came to an agreement that I would work with the leader-
ship team, composed of the heads of each of the institute’s functional 
departments, rather than with the two “symptomatic” individuals.  

170 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Based on individual interviews with everyone on the leadership 
team, I discovered that the primary organizational concern was actu-
ally a high turnover rate rather than, or possibly in addition to, the 
functioning of the two individual managers initially discussed. It then 
made more sense to me why the request had been about coaching as 
high organizational turnover is often linked to leadership and culture 
(Follett, 1996). Further, I sensed that the institute was a challenging 
place to work as perfectionism at any cost was the standard by which 
individuals were measured—providing additional data for my devel-
oping hypothesis that the organization  culture was problematic.  
 Using psychodynamic theory, a group-as-a-whole level of analysis, 
and social-structural concepts in conjunction with the Burke-Litwin 
model, I developed a working hypothesis that linked data from vari-
ous sources. The organization had changed its mission and strategy 
from focusing solely on research to also including advocacy, and its 
structure from working individually to working in teams. This story 
framed the organizational concerns (i.e., high turnover, conflict 
among two members of the leadership team, and aspects of the cul-
ture) as consequences of the change in the organization’s mission and 
strategy. Applying the top of the Burke-Litwin model, I suggested 
that the consultation  could best focus on the leadership team because 
this model links leadership with both mission and strategy and with 
culture (Burke & Litwin, 1992) and proposed that it was the leader-
ship team’s responsibility to align mission and strategy with culture. 
As we set out on the consultancy, the Burke-Litwin model served as a 
comfortable conversation starter—a road map reminding participants 
that although they might feel lost along the way, they were actually on 
a particular track.  
 We often introduce personality assessments when working with an 
organization for several reasons: First, they provide individual infor-
mation that might not otherwise be accessible and the assessment 
data invite a conversation about an individual’s role in the organiza-
tion and the reciprocal influences of the individual and the organi-
zation on each other. Second, they provide individuals with data for 
their own development apart from their specific work roles and there-
fore can motivate them to engage more fully. Third, the results can be 
used to compile a group profile; that is, a picture of the organization 

 
CHAPTER  8 • UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS: COVERT PROCESSES 
171
that serves as another way for  the client group to understand itself as 
a collective entity. This additional snapshot allows for more candid 
conversation about the group’s strengths and challenges as it is 
informed by assessment data rather than by what any one person 
reports in an individual interview and therefore is viewed as more 
objective. Using personality assessments to connect individual and 
group behavior to inform organization development work is a 
well-established data-based intervention (Burke & Noumair, 
2002; Hogan, 2006). Given this rationale, I invited all members 
of the leadership team to take the Myers Briggs Type Indicator, 
Step II (MBTI) ( www.ConsultingPsychologistsPress.com ) and the 
Hogan  Development Survey (assessment of leadership derailers) 
( www.HoganAssessments.com ; Hogan, 2006). 
 The assessment results helped me deepen my working hypothesis 
about the leadership team. I viewed the two members of the lead-
ership team who were depicted as the initial presenting problem as 
“containers” of a split in the organization. Their assessment profiles 
suggested that the two of them were more comfortable than others 
to serve as fight leaders. Whenever there were opposing sides to an 
issue, the leadership team could depend on the two of them to locate 
themselves in opposition to one another as they each had “Velcro” for 
such projections. When they did so, everyone else was off the  hook; 
no one else had to enter the fray. Thus, the team’s collusion in unwit-
tingly allowing these two conflict-prone individuals to fight served 
them as everyone else on the team appeared affable and coopera-
tive. I tucked away this idea until I had further data to support it and 
enough evidence to share it with the entire leadership team.  
 First Retreat  
 At the first retreat held for the leadership team, I first reported 
group profiles from the two personality assessments and then 
offered my thematic analysis and my working hypothesis about the 
organization.  
 This is a common practice, as presenting individual and group 
assessment profiles first can serve as a warm-up of sorts, providing an 
opportunity for the team to interact with each other and learn about 

172 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
themselves, individually and collectively. However, when I presented 
the MBTI group profile, the two fight leaders were immediately, and 
relentlessly, critical of my presentation, complaining that I did not 
present the data accurately and suggesting other ways of doing it. This 
reaction surprised me, and given that the rest of the leadership team, 
including the leader, remained silent during this attack, I viewed the 
two members  who had Velcro for conflict, as speaking on behalf of the 
team as a whole. It was  as if the leadership team unconsciously put 
them forward to challenge me.  
 When a group acts  as if it is working on a task other than the 
task it has formally been assigned, it is often as a method of defend-
ing against the anxiety that is triggered by the real work (Bion, 1961; 
Gustafson & Cooper, 1992). What is challenging diagnostically is that 
often groups take up the  as if  task, in Bion’s terms, basic assumption 
mode (Bion, 1961), with as much vigor as they would if they were 
working on the formally assigned task. Therefore, the consultant is 
easily seduced into believing the group is doing real work rather than 
obstructing progress.  
 After responding to a few iterations of their criticism in a straight-
forward, non-defensive manner, I began to understand the  as if 
quality to what was going on. I said as much, deciding to use self-as-
instrument (Berg & Smith, 1985, 1988; Burke, 1982, 1994; Cheung-
Judge, 2001; Gillette, 1995; Levinson, 1972a; McCormick & White, 
2000; Smith, 1995). I said that I had a pit in my stomach. I was filled 
with dread at the idea of working with them over the next day and a 
half during which I was to give three more presentations. Given this 
fight process, I understood why the turnover rate in the organization 
was so high.  
 There was a collective gasp in the room and a look of astonish-
ment on their faces. They seemed horrified that I, or any consultant, 
would say such a thing to  them. Their self-image was of a very smart, 
very buttoned-up, polite, and proper group of people. This was not a 
group characterized by candor.  
 Suddenly, one member of the team spoke up, “That pit in your 
stomach, I know that pit in your stomach—it is the same pit I have in 
my stomach every time I enter a leadership team meeting.” Another 
added, “We hired you to shine a flashlight on what we do so we can 

 
CHAPTER  8 • UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS: COVERT PROCESSES 
173
better understand why we have the reputation that we do, and you 
have done that—whether we like what we see when the light is shone 
or not.”  
 It was a critical moment in the consultation. I viewed the con-
versation that followed my “self-as-instrument” moment as the first 
evidence of real work among the team, and I labeled the person who 
identified with my “pit in the stomach” as the first work leader to 
emerge, other than the formal leader of the organization. The work 
leader’s role was integral to what transpired as it symbolized the 
responsibility having shifted from the consultant to a member of the 
team, and soon after, to the other members of the team who had 
chimed in. By drawing the parallel between my  experience in the 
retreat and her experience in leadership team meetings, she led the 
team to take ownership of their work in the retreat, gave legitimacy 
to the consultation, and credibility to me as its architect, reflecting an 
example of the use of parallel process in organizational consultation 
(Sullivan, 2002).  
 What then became clear was that the two members of the team 
who were the initial presenting problem, the two with “Velcro” for 
fight and conflict, represented the two separate components of the 
organization’s mission, research, and advocacy. Although there cer-
tainly were interpersonal issues between these two team members, 
refocusing on the conflict inherent in having two primary tasks, which 
they symbolized, seemed to free up the team to work on those issues. 
What also became clear was that other members of the organization 
split these two parts of the overall mission, some aligning with research 
behind the researcher “spokesperson”  and others more aligned with 
advocacy behind the head of advocacy, the “advocacy spokesperson.” 
Once group members were able to own their individual contributions 
to the split, the antagonism between the two primary actors lessened 
in intensity and they too began to work together in a manner that 
appeared creative and free flowing.  
 To understand what happened next at the retreat, it is important 
to describe an interaction that occurred in preparation for it. I had 
gone to lunch with the leader and shared with him themes from the 
individual interviews I had conducted with leadership team mem-
bers and said that I was concerned that at the retreat candor would 

174 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
be stifled and team members inhibited by his presence. Leadership 
team members perceived the leader as “the smartest person in the 
room” and they feared being shamed for not measuring up. He said 
that if that happened, I should “call him on it”—that I should make 
his behavior as well as its impact on his team explicit in the moment 
that it occurred. I responded, “Right then and there, in public?” And 
he said, “Yes, call me on it.” Although I could not believe what I was 
hearing, at the same time, I thought to myself, “I now have a contract 
for work.”  
 Having made this agreement with the leader, I felt confident that 
I did not have to collude with the organization. Had I not shared with 
him in advance what I had learned in my interviews about his staff’s 
perception of him, I would have been mimicking his staff’s behavior. I 
would have acted as if he were too scary to be talked to directly—that 
one should not speak truth to power. The effect of withholding that 
information would also have worked in the other direction; I would 
have been acting as if his staff’s perceptions of him were “true” and 
therefore that I would be at risk in the same way in which they felt 
they were at risk. This preparation eventually allowed me to make 
what was covert, overt, and model for the staff how to have an authen-
tic conversation with the leader.  
 Establishing a “contract for work” with the head of the organization 
allowed me to address at the retreat what I imagined would be neces-
sary; that is, to confront the leader and his team about their authority 
relations with each other. For the first time, the leader acknowledged 
that he was part of the problem, that he was in part responsible for the 
high rate of turnover, a symptom of the organization’s rough culture. 
Tears accompanied his revelation, which was quite upsetting to some 
members of his team, and also signified a second critical event in the 
consultation. It became clear  that the leadership team was invested in 
protecting the leader and maintaining the status quo. One member 
said that my first responsibility was to do no harm and as far as he was 
concerned, I had done harm, as I should not be creating conditions in 
which the leader cried in public. His rebuke, followed by an elaborate 
argument that I should preserve the perceived invulnerability of the 
leader, brought to mind Lewin’s maxim that the best way to under-
stand an organization is to try and change it (Lewin, 1951).  

 
CHAPTER  8 • UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS: COVERT PROCESSES 
175
 My understanding of this reaction was that as long as the leader 
was seen as “the problem,” no one on the leadership team had to 
take responsibility for it. If they instead engaged the interpretation 
that the issues related to high turnover were systemic, not personal, 
and that they had collective responsibility, each person could then 
be held accountable for his or her own behavior. Rather than going a 
level deeper and owning up to their contributions, some members of 
the leadership team preferred to remain invested in the more emo-
tionally convenient arrangement. Further, it would later be revealed 
that the leadership team’s lack of ownership of the organization’s cul-
ture at the initial retreat was a warning sign that they were unable, or 
perhaps unwilling, to work without the leader. Although obvious in 
retrospect, competition among team members to be chosen as suc-
cessor may have contributed to their investment in maintaining the 
illusion that only the leader was responsible for the organizational 
culture. Moreover, the leader’s wish to remain solely in control of 
the organization and protect the legacy of its founder prevented him 
from more aggressively confronting the leadership team. At various 
points in the consultation, I thought about framing the organization 
as a family business given the ironclad adherence to roles displayed by 
the members. However, given that the institute did not initially sign 
up for changing the culture and the question of succession, though 
fundamental, had not yet been broached, pursuing these questions at 
this stage did not seem appropriate.  
 After the First Retreat  
 To build on the learning from the first retreat, I developed a plan 
to address the split in relating to the two organizational missions as 
well as to improve authority relations. It was necessary to address 
these issues at multiple levels. First, it was important to alert the entire 
organization that the leadership team was considering the applica-
tion of group relations concepts to the organization’s challenges as 
doing so meant that they were taking a systemic, rather than personal, 
view of the institute and  everyone would be expected to participate in 
addressing the challenges. We decided that I would make a presen-
tation at a staff meeting on group dynamics and team development 

176 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
to introduce the group relations perspective to the organization as a 
whole.  
 At the presentation, I introduced the ideas presented at the out-
set of this chapter, including psychodynamic theory (Gould, 2004; 
Hirschhorn, 1988; Obholzer & Roberts, 1994), a group-as-a-whole 
level of analysis (Rutan, Stone, & Shay, 2007; Wells, 1995), and BART 
(Green & Molenkamp, 2005) as a framework for analyzing groups in 
an organizational context. Doing so was an opportunity for me as the 
consultant to act as educator, providing the organization with a new 
way of thinking about organizational life. The staff was clearly relieved 
that I was analyzing the organization as a whole rather than the indi-
viduals within it. At  the same time, it seemed like the beginning of 
interrupting a culture of blame; it was now at least theoretically pos-
sible to consider that the organization, collectively, was responsible 
for what had been created.  
 On the day I was to give the presentation, I arrived wearing a large 
necklace with three circular silver plates, positioned vertically one on 
top of the other so that the necklace hung from my neck to my waist. 
In an illustration of the extent to which the consultation had begun to 
have an effect on the organization, a member of the leadership team 
looked at my necklace and asked, “What is that, a bulletproof vest?” I 
responded in kind, “Yes, I figured that since I would be shot at once 
again I would protect myself this time.” Although we both acknowl-
edged the humor in our exchange, we were also acknowledging that 
we now had a familiar way of talking about the organization, about 
the culture, and about our work together. Once again, an organization 
member had made the covert overt.  
 Next, we introduced a plan to collect multi-rater feedback for 
the entire leadership team. Multi-rater or 360 feedback is a report of 
the perceptions of an employee’s entire circle of work colleagues—
manager, peers, direct reports, and sometimes even customers and 
clients (Bracken, Timmreck, & Church, 2001). Before beginning 
this feedback process, I met with those staff members who would be 
interviewed as direct reports of the leadership team in advance and 
explained the entire process and the rules of engagement, that is, con-
fidentiality and anonymity.  

 
CHAPTER  8 • UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS: COVERT PROCESSES 
177
 This meeting, too, was an important turning point in the consul-
tation as it was now becoming much clearer that the organizational 
culture required change, that the problem was not one of individuals 
but instead one of “how we do things around here” (Deal & Ken-
nedy, 1982). Like the leadership team before them, it was now the 
staff’s turn to resist. They did not think multi-rater feedback was the 
correct solution to the problem. In their minds, the problem was not 
any one of the individual leadership team members but the collec-
tive leadership team, and the organization’s culture as a whole that 
they felt the leadership team had produced. Some went so far as to 
say that the problem was the leader of the organization as they were 
versed in leadership theory that suggests that the leader is responsible 
for driving the culture (Schein, 2004). They viewed multi-rater feed-
back as off target, misplaced, and a waste of resources. Concerned 
about retaliation for their comments in the interviews, they warned 
me about the lack of candor I could expect from them. The harmony 
of their voices was quite compelling and helped to make the case that 
organizational culture needed to be addressed.  
 As a consequence of this conversation, I kept a log of all comments 
related to the organizational culture that surfaced during the feed-
back interviews and agreed to report only those themes endorsed by 
more than one person to ensure that controversial issues could not be 
linked or traced back to any one individual. Not surprisingly, the envi-
ronment was perceived as controlled, perfectionist, and risk-averse; 
overthinking and an inability to prioritize prevailed. In addition, there 
was a perceived lack of differentiation in task and responsibilities, and 
hierarchy ruled. If this was truly “the way we do things around here,” 
one could  see why there was a high turnover rate at this organization. 
 The final stage of the feedback process required that I interview 
the board of directors of the institute about the leader as they col-
lectively held managerial authority over him. These discussions pro-
vided a window into the problem of succession as I learned that board 
members were concerned that there was no internal candidate who 
could serve as successor and therefore the long-term sustainability of 
the institute was at risk. The most pressing issue for board members 
was developing the leadership team’s capacity to work without the 
leader at the same time as enabling them to follow the direction of a 

178 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
successor from outside the institute. When I shared the board mem-
bers’ feedback with the leader, I discovered that he, too, had concerns 
about the future of the institute and readily engaged the charge from 
the board that he prepare his staff to work without him. While focus-
ing on culture change at the institute was the overt task the orga-
nization was working on at this point, the leader was working on a 
covert task; that is, developing his team in order to set the stage for 
his retirement while actively keeping his time frame for retirement 
a secret. I learned that the leader was concerned that if he made his 
plan to retire public he would become a lame duck leader and have to 
relinquish control; while wanting to step down on one hand, he was 
also concerned that the institute was not ready for leadership succes-
sion. The board’s feedback enabled him to understand at a deeper 
level that his job as leader was to replace himself and that his lead-
ership would be judged by the effectiveness of his leadership team 
after he was gone (Kaiser, Hogan, & Craig, 2008; Hogan, Curphy, & 
Hogan, 1994). The discourse on leadership succession became  a cen-
tral theme in parallel discussions I held with the leader and the board. 
 Second Retreat  
 Viewing the presentation of the culture data that had been col-
lected during the multi-rater feedback interviews was very difficult 
for the leadership team: They were devastated. They found all sorts of 
reasons to deny what I had reported. Eventually, however, they real-
ized that they were accountable for the processes that had been put in 
place to conduct the work and they had to acknowledge the uninten-
tional consequences of those processes. Once again, the leadership 
team had to bend from its original idea about what the organizational 
consultation was about to discover the truth as perceived by those at 
lower levels  in the organization. The task was not fixing individuals, 
but changing the way they as leaders worked together and with their 
staff and the way the organization as a whole did business. The orga-
nization, and specifically the leadership team, finally began to take 
responsibility for the culture it had created.  

 
CHAPTER  8 • UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS: COVERT PROCESSES 
179
 After the Second Retreat  
 As a result of the cultural revelations, every meeting agenda now 
included time for “bitching” at the outset—an acknowledgment of the 
importance of one’s emotional state at work. Leaders and staff alike 
were now able to say what was usually left unspoken, denied, or even 
shoved aside. Although this might not seem like an important change, 
it represented the beginning of a shift in the culture, from controlled 
to expressive, solely cerebral to also emotional, and allowing room for 
play as well as work.  
 Team Retreats  
 As the leadership team focused on clarifying the organizational 
structure and roles and responsibilities, we decided to conduct indi-
vidual team retreats for each functional department of the institute. 
At each retreat, we provided individual and group assessment pro-
files, reported on collective themes from individual interviews, and 
worked to create conditions in which difficult issues could be voiced, 
and the covert could be made overt.  
 With the completion of these retreats, a noticeable difference 
began to emerge in the ways individuals and teams interacted with 
each other. It was clear that work on creating a culture of candor 
was under way. There was also a significant change in the behavior 
of the organization’s leader. He modeled open communication and 
expressed more vulnerability, which went a long way toward develop-
ing a more positive perception of his leadership as well as accelerating 
culture change.  
 The Final Veil  
 The next phase of the consultation involved working at mul-
tiple levels simultaneously. The leadership team focused on effec-
tive management by learning how to have difficult conversations, 
conducting more effective performance appraisals, modeling better 
meeting management, and increasing delegation of authority. Impor-
tantly, the organization as a whole began working on becoming more 
reflective and instituted mechanisms for individual and collective 

180 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
self-monitoring that allowed for the generating of insights that might 
facilitate further change. This was in sharp contrast to the organiza-
tion that I initially encountered in which learning was equated with 
not having adequately prepared, and learning in public was equated  
with humiliation.  
 At this point, the organization had progressed enough that the 
leadership team saw fit to have conducted a formal survey on its cul-
ture; findings regarding trust, fairness, and psychological safety, not 
surprisingly, corroborated the findings from the consultation already 
under way. This “objective” data challenged the leadership team’s 
previous defense that the data I had collected earlier were somehow 
not valid.  
 With no place to hide, the organization steeled itself to engage 
more broadly in the work necessary to change its reputation as a 
challenging place to work. We established a new ground rule in our 
work, namely that an organization member could not talk unless he 
acknowledged how he contributed to the problems in the current cul-
ture. The idea behind this was that dynamics related to trust, fairness, 
and psychological safety are co-created by all members of an organi-
zation even though differential responsibility and accountability are 
aligned with positional authority. At first, no one could speak, as all 
were invested  in blaming others, and more specifically, in blaming up. 
Eventually, however, each person began to own his or her contribu-
tion to the dysfunction, providing evidence for the effectiveness of the 
group-as-a-whole level intervention.  
 Once the entire organization had digested the culture survey 
results, taken responsibility, individually and collectively, and worked 
on implementing action plans, we were ostensibly finished with the 
consultation. Now it was a matter of ongoing monitoring and making 
adjustments as needed. At last, the most important veil fell away: The 
leader decided to make public his plan for retirement.  
 After the Consultation  
 Monthly meetings between the consultant and the leader con-
tinued for eight months and then ceased during the search for the 
leader’s successor. Once the search process was complete, meetings 

 
CHAPTER  8 • UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS: COVERT PROCESSES 
181
between the consultant and the leader continued until the leader 
retired from the organization. The engagement extended for five 
years in total, beginning with the initial phone call and ending with 
the completion of a search for the leader’s successor.  
 Discussion  
 In hindsight, and with the psychodynamic veils removed and 
beneath the surface of the Burke-Litwin model revealed, the issues at 
this organization were rather straightforward. The real but underly-
ing need of the organization was to find a way to survive without its 
leader. When the board first raised this issue, its members declared 
the leader could not retire until the organization could work without 
him. The challenge of meeting that condition had effectively brought 
the organization’s progress to a halt and the organization had found 
refuge in obfuscation and fight—focusing on the two feuding princi-
pals, blaming the leader, and finally blaming the consultant. By pull-
ing away the psychodynamic veils one by one, it became clear that in 
order to move forward, the entire organization needed to focus on 
repairing a culture dominated by perfectionism and hyperrationality 
as defenses against the covert processes. Only then could the organi-
zation become autonomous enough that the leader could step down.  
 Organizations are like individuals in that no two are alike. And 
while the integrative model of consultation illustrated here seems 
widely, if not universally applicable, its specific application needs to 
be adapted to the unique culture of a client organization.  
 To make the most effective use of this approach, consultants 
need to engage in reflective practice (discussed in  Chapter  12 , 
“The Organization Development Consultant”), action-reflection/
reflection-action processes (Schön, 1983), double loop learning 
(Argyris & Schön, 1978), using self as instrument (Berg & Smith, 
1985, 1988; Burke, 1982, 1994; Cheung-Judge, 2001; Gillette, 1995; 
Levinson, 1972a; McCormick & White, 2000; Smith, 1995), and 
“getting on the balcony” (Heifetz, 1994). They need to take the 
unfamiliar-to-the-world-of-business approach of honoring psycholog-
ical experience and offer a model of how to do this for their clients. 

182 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
This requires understanding the organization’s resistance to thinking 
psychologically, making a compelling case for reflection, reframing in-
dividual behavior as symptomatic of systemic issues, and co-creating 
conditions that allow for the exploration of emotional and irrational, 
as well as rational, forces in organizational life.  
 Consulting to an organization, using this framework, requires a 
core capacity to reflect on one’s emotional experience, interrogate 
that experience, make meaning of it, inquire about the emotional 
experience of others, and trust that emotional experience constitutes 
valid data (Argyris, 1965). The issues a consultant faces at the outset 
of a consultation may not make immediate rational sense, but will 
always make psychological sense. Once the consultant experiences 
the underlying reasons she was hired in the first place, her experience 
becomes perhaps the first useful data point in the discovery process.  
 That moment—like the moment when the leadership team 
member affirmed the pit in my stomach—will feel like a great relief 
because the consultant will know she is finally moving forward, but 
paradoxically, that is when caution is most necessary. Removing veils 
allows an organization’s defense mechanisms to be revealed, provid-
ing important diagnostic information on where and what the under-
lying pain and anxiety are (Halton, 1994; Hirschhorn, 1988), but 
consultants must understand that some organizational defenses must 
be respected and left in place, for example, defending against the pain 
of having lost a beloved organizational member or leader.  
 The final chapter of any successful consultancy of this nature 
involves allowing an organization to reconstitute, enabling a more self-
aware and self-monitoring organization that is able to use its defenses 
to confront adversity while at the same time maintaining a vibrant and 
healthy culture that supports its mission.  
 Conclusion  
 In addition to the models and frameworks covered in  Chapters 
 6 and  7 , we presented a conceptual framework for organizational 
consultation that incorporates group relations and organization 

 
CHAPTER  8 • UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS: COVERT PROCESSES 
183
development. As components of a group relations perspective, we 
introduced the utility of psychodynamic theory, a group-as-a-whole 
level of analysis, and social-structural concepts. Psychodynamic the-
ory provides a lens for understanding covert aspects of group and 
organizational life. Focusing on the group as the level of analysis, a 
group-as-a-whole perspective allows for greater understanding of the 
root causes of behavior; provides an understanding of how individu-
als, subgroups, and entire organizations participate in maintaining a 
“problem”;  and presents evidence for collusion among group mem-
bers thereby linking individual and group behavior. Social-structural 
concepts, BART (Boundary, Authority, Role, and Task) (Green & 
Molenkamp, 2005), is a framework for understanding the extent to 
which groups and organizations are interdependent and structurally 
organized to do work. GRPI (Goals, Roles, Processes, and Interper-
sonal relationships) (Beckhard, 1972; Burke, 1988, 1994) is a diagnos-
tic tool to be utilized hierarchically; that is, first determine the extent 
to which there is alignment about goals; once achieved, clarify roles 
and responsibilities followed by processes for collaboration. Both 
BART and GRPI use concepts and language that are  familiar to orga-
nization members and therefore may be less threatening than tools 
that purport to uncover covert processes.  
 In addition to the Burke-Litwin model (Burke & Litwin, 1992) 
discussed in depth in  Chapter  7 , we introduced the Burke-Litwin 
model beneath the surface and as was the case earlier, we invited the 
reader to imagine a hologram, a three-dimensional image in which 
it is possible to simultaneously see what is on the surface and what 
is beneath the surface of the model. To bring to life this concep-
tual framework that expands the Burke-Litwin model to include the 
unconscious and irrational aspects of organizations, we presented a 
case analysis. The case included the use of assessments (multi-rater 
feedback and personality  inventories) for individuals and teams, and 
the use of self-as-instrument and reflective practice.  
 Although detecting covert processes can contribute to a more 
robust organization diagnosis, employing both perspectives, group 
relations and organization development, allows the client system to 
work with what is on the surface, and probably more accessible, as 
well as what lies beneath the surface, and initially, out of awareness.

 Planning and Managing Change 
 It is easy to write, if not to assume, that diagnosis is one activity 
and intervention (that is, planning and implementing change) is quite 
another. In practice, however, this is simply not true. As Schein (1969) 
pointed out, merely entering a human system to conduct a diagnosis 
is an intervention.  
 It is helpful to our understanding, nevertheless, to consider the 
phases of planning and managing change as following diagnosis and 
feedback. Thus, once a diagnosis has been made and feedback has 
been provided to the client, it is time to plan the appropriate steps to 
take so that problems identified in the diagnostic phase are addressed 
and a more ideal future state for the organization can be determined. 
Guiding this planning phase should be a set of coherent and interre-
lated concepts—a theory, a model, a conceptual frame of reference.  
 This chapter first defines intervention and then covers the plan-
ning and management of change phase in more detail. Finally, we 
consider ways to determine if progress is being made in a change 
effort.  
 According to Argyris (1970), collecting data from an organization 
is intervening, which supports Schein’s contention and our earlier 
claim that the phases of organization development (OD) are not dis-
crete. For this phase of organization development, however, we think 
in terms of some specified activity, some event or planned sequence 
of events that occurs as a result of diagnosis and feedback. The pro-
cess of moving from a functional way of organizing to a project form, 
for example, regardless of how long it takes (and it might take months) 
could constitute an OD intervention. Another example of a possible 
OD intervention would  be a singular event and would take a com-
paratively short period of time. Either type of activity could serve as 

186 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
an OD intervention, provided the event responds to an actual and felt 
need for change on the part of the client, involves the client in the 
planning and implementing of the change (intervention), and leads to 
change in the organization’s culture.  
 Criteria for Effective Intervention  
 Argyris (1970) has specified similar criteria for what he consid-
ers the primary tasks of an interventionist (OD practitioner). His 
three criteria are (1) valid and useful information, (2) free choice, and 
(3) internal commitment. By  valid and useful information, he means 
“that which describes the factors plus their interrelationships, that 
create the problem for the client system” (p. 17). According to Argyris, 
the information the OD practitioner has collected from and about the 
client accurately reflects what people in the organization perceive and 
feel, what they consider to be their primary concerns and issues, what 
they experience as complexities and perhaps  accompanying frustra-
tions of living within and being a part of the client system, and what 
they would like to see changed. Argyris goes on to specify that, if sev-
eral independent diagnoses lead to the same intervention, the data 
the practitioner has gathered are valid.  
 For all practical purposes, this first task of an interventionist, 
obtaining valid and useful information, is similar to our first criterion 
for intervention, responding to an actual and felt need for change on 
the part of the client. If valid information is obtained by the practi-
tioner, it will reflect a need. If the practitioner responds to that need, 
he or she will have done so by providing valid and useful information.  
 By  free choice,  Argyris means that “the locus of decision mak-
ing [is] in the client system” (p. 19) and that the client is provided 
alternatives for action. No particular or specified action is automatic, 
preordained, or imposed.  
 By  internal commitment,  Argyris means that the client owns the 
choice made and feels responsible for implementing it. Organization 
members act on their choice because it responds to needs, both indi-
vidual and on behalf of the organization.  

 
CHAPTER  9 • PLANNING AND MANAGING CHANGE 
187
 The primary tasks of choice and internal commitment will be 
accomplished if the practitioner involves the client in planning and 
implementing the intervention. Argyris does not specify cultural 
change, our third criterion. He implies that, if the practitioner accom-
plishes the three primary tasks, the organization’s culture will be 
changed. This is only an implication, however; he does not specify it.  
 Although there are similarities between Argyris’s criteria and ours, 
the primary difference is that we are expressing processes or means 
while he is stating end states or outcomes. Either way of expressing 
these criteria makes sense.  
 Planning the Intervention or Change  
 Readers may or may not agree on the fine points concerning a 
definition of and the criteria for an effective intervention. Unless 
there is some readiness for change within the client organization, def-
initions and criteria are no more than an academic exercise. Richard 
Beckhard expressed it one way and Harry Levinson another, but both 
essentially said, when it comes to organization (or individual for that 
matter) change: “No pain, no change.” Unless enough key people in 
the organization feel a real need for change, none is likely to occur, at 
least none that is planned and managed.  
 The initiation of change, it should be noted, is typically in response 
to changes in the organization’s external environment, as was Prime 
Minister Thatcher’s decision to privatize British Airways. In other 
words, it is rarely true that top management comes together and 
states “Why don’t we change the organization?” More likely, top man-
agement in initiating change is doing so as a reaction to changes in the 
organization’s marketplace, to changes in technology, to changes in 
government regulations, to stronger competition, and so forth.  
 Readiness for Change  
 Sometimes determining readiness is quite obvious and straightfor-
ward. The company’s sales have fallen dramatically, costs have risen 
so sharply that profit doesn’t exist anymore, turnover and absenteeism 

188 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
are significantly out of line when compared with others in the same 
industry, morale has never been lower or the market strategy doesn’t 
seem to work anymore—these are some obvious and rather straight-
forward examples of a need for change. Under any of these circum-
stances, it is not difficult to determine a readiness. As was the case for 
British Airways ( Chapter  7 , “The Burke-Litwin Model of Organiza-
tional Performance and Change”), the need for change  was extremely 
clear. The degree of readiness varied among BA employees, but the 
need was obvious. In other instances, or even in the instances listed 
above, everyone may not see or understand a need for change. In this 
situation, the need must be generated. This may be done in either of 
two ways. One way is to gather information, the facts, about the cur-
rent situation and contrast this information with where the organiza-
tion was supposed to have been by this time. In other words, it is a 
matter of comparing actual achievements with what was desired, the 
organization’s goals or  mission.  
 Assuming that organizational members identified with these goals 
(no minor assumption, to be sure) and they then see a significant dif-
ference between actual and desired, they will experience a need to 
reduce the difference or gap between actual and what is desired. In 
this case, the desired state is known; not known is how far off the mark 
the organization’s actual performance is from that which is desired. 
Contrasting actual with desired creates the required motivation for 
change.  
 Another way to generate a need for change is to develop a more 
desirable future state. Organizational members may be satisfied with 
the status quo and experience no need for change unless and until 
they are presented with a possibility of something better, more desir-
able. It might mean a lot of hard work and a considerable modifica-
tion in the way that work is done, but the new mission and differences 
in how work would be accomplished may be sufficiently attractive 
that a motivational pull toward this more desirable future state would 
be generated. This, of course, requires leadership.  
 Even though generating a need for change may be accomplished 
in either of these two different ways, the principle is the same. Present-
ing people with a discrepancy between what is and what is desired will 
create tension, and the motivation will be in the direction of reduc-
ing that tension; that is, to move toward the more desired state. This 

 
CHAPTER  9 • PLANNING AND MANAGING CHANGE 
189
principle of human behavior is based on sound theory and research; 
see, for example, Lewin (1936) or Duvall and Wicklund (1972).  
 Preparing the client for change, what we have labeled readiness, 
is what Lewin called the unfreezing stage (see  Chapter  4 , “Organiza-
tion Development as a Process of Change”). Unfreezing is creating 
conditions whereby the client is shaken loose (unfrozen) from the 
status quo. The client’s mental and emotional set has been broken 
and the client is therefore more amenable to consider, if not accept, 
change. For more elaboration on this stage, as well as additions to 
our understanding of Lewin’s next two stages, changing and refreez-
ing, see Schein (1980) and  Chapter  4 . And for more specifity regard-
ing a conceptual model for understanding and creating readiness for 
change, see Armenakis, Harris, and Mossholder (1993) and for a scale 
to assess readiness, see Armenakis, Bernerth, Pitts, and Walker (2007) 
and Holt, Armenakis, Feild, and Harris (2007).  
 We have also used the terms  actual and  desired state. This is the 
language of Beckhard and Harris (1987). Developing a new mission, 
a new vision, a fresh image of the future is the process of creating a 
desired state, a way of being, of working that is more desirable than 
the present state. Planning any change effort involves this kind of 
development—that is, creating an image of the more desired future 
state. This creative process is not easy to do. Even more difficult, 
however, is moving the organization to that desired future. Beckhard 
and Harris (1987), based on the earlier thinking  of Lewin, view the 
change process in three states:  
 Present State ➔ Transition State ➔ Future State  
 Although determining the future state is obviously critical, Beck-
hard and Harris concern themselves far more with the transition state, 
managing the change process, the more difficult phase.  
 Hanna (1988) has added to the Beckhard and Harris transition 
state by emphasizing in his coverage of managing change the impor-
tance of:  
 
•  Developing a true commitment to the change 
 
•  Training in the requisite skills 
 
•  Dedicating sufficient resources 

190 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 
•  Overcoming old habits 
 
•  Managing the environment 
 Power and Leadership  
 In addition to determining readiness and preparing the client 
organization for change by contrasting actual with desired, other plan-
ning activities need to occur. It is a leadership function to see to it that 
the future state is developed. Leaders in the organization need to be 
far more concerned with determining the future than specifying how 
to get there. Gaining commitment from organizational members to 
the future state, a plan, is critical; gaining commitment to implement-
ing the plan, as Hanna has emphasized, is even more critical. More 
will be stated on this latter point in the next section.  
 A leadership function, therefore, is to make certain that a plan 
for the future is in place, that the plan is adequately communicated, 
and then to generate energy within the organization to support the 
transition.  
 In any sizable organization, formal as well as informal leaders 
exist. Often overlooked in a change effort is the latter group. It is 
obvious that senior management needs to be on board. If unionized, 
leaders within the union(s) need to be involved and supportive. All 
of the key managers who head the various boxes on the organization 
chart need to be on board. Not so obvious, however, are those who 
informally, from time to time, influence people’s opinions. In an orga-
nization such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 
for example, informal leadership comes from scientists and engineers 
who are not line, operational administrators but who are, as individu-
als, highly respected. Their opinions about matters are sought and 
they are influential. If these highly respected, listened-to, powerful 
individuals are not supportive of the change effort, resistance among 
organizational members will be greater than would otherwise be the 
case. It is wise, therefore, early in the planning process, to engage 
these informal leaders in discussing what change is needed and what 
is more desirable for the future.  
 Also informal and powerful indeed is the political process, a pro-
cess that is typically subterranean, below the surface, not discussed 

 
CHAPTER  9 • PLANNING AND MANAGING CHANGE 
191
openly much less in formal meetings within the organization (see our 
 Chapter  8 , “Understanding Organizations: Covert Processes,” for 
coverage of these covert processes and see Tichy’s TPC framework 
in  Chapter  6 , “Understanding Organizations: The Process of Diagno-
sis”). By  political we mean those activities and processes in an organi-
zation that emanate from one’s self-interest, or the particular interest 
of a group, that may not be in the overall interest of the organization. 
Typically when faced with the possibility of organizational change, 
organizational  members rarely at the outset ask the question, “What is 
the plan for the future?” but instead, whether openly or not, they ask 
“How will the change affect me?”  
 It is not a matter of right versus wrong. It is more a simple matter 
of human nature. Thus, during the planning phase, it is imperative to 
address these political concerns, motivated by self-interest. That is, it 
is imperative to respond to the tacit question, “What’s in it for me?” 
Some examples of the advantages to be provided by the future state 
might be these:  
 
•  A mission and purpose that is more meaningful and inspiring 
 
•  A set of goals and objectives that are not only clearer but more 
sensible in potential for attainment as well  
 
•  A more participative, pleasant place to work 
 
•  A reward system that is more flexible and responsive to indi-
vidual differences  
 
•  A more decentralized structure that supports greater worker 
autonomy as well as responsiveness to the customer  
 
•  A management information system that handles relevant, cur-
rent, and therefore, useful data  
 
•  A set of management practices that engender trust 
 With such examples, a statement of the future could begin to be 
responsive to individuals’ personal concerns. More specificity regard-
ing such statements would be required, of course.  
 To summarize, in planning change, the first phase is unfreez-
ing the organization. This means creating awareness of the need 
for change. This is best done by contrasting an actual with a more 
desired state. Also critical to this initial planning phase is leadership, 

192 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
in this case, leadership capable of establishing conditions whereby 
the desired future state can be determined. And, finally, for adequate 
planning, the political and power dynamics within the organization 
must be addressed. Addressing these organizational dynamics means 
involving informal leaders in the planning and making certain that 
the way the future state is described is responsive to  organizational 
members’ inevitable question, “What’s in it for me?”  
 Managing the Change Process  
 The toughest job is to  manage the change process. In writing 
about this management process, we can be logical, rational, and per-
haps convey that dealing with organizational change is indeed subject 
to management. In reality, however, managing change is sloppy—
people never do exactly as we plan. And it follows Murphy’s Law—
if anything can go wrong, it will. Moreover, organizational politics is 
always present and change, after all, affects us all emotionally.  
 Even with these qualifications and the perspective that managing 
change is not always manageable, it is useful to consider certain prin-
ciples and guidelines. The more a process may seem unmanageable, 
the more we should stick closely to those activities that have been 
demonstrated to be helpful. The following principles and guidelines 
meet the criterion of demonstrated helpfulness.  
 Disengagement from the Past  
 Once it has been decided that change will happen and the planning 
has occurred, or is in process, time and energy need to be devoted to 
disengaging from the past, that is, from certain ways of working; from 
a program, project, or product; from a geographical location; or from 
a group of people with whom one previously worked. Disengagement 
may take a variety of forms. An event can be held to recognize in a 
formal way the contribution of a certain program that will no longer 
be implemented, and of the people who were involved. The event can 
be celebratory  in nature despite conclusion of the program.  
 In an organization with which we are familiar, a particular pro-
gram was to be phased out to make way for a new and different one. 

 
CHAPTER  9 • PLANNING AND MANAGING CHANGE 
193
The program had involved research and development on a rocket 
used by NASA and the U.S. Air Force that became obsolete. Yet 
R&D was conducted with the rocket program all along the way as if 
it would always exist and be constantly improved. After almost twenty 
years with this program, the engineers and technicians involved were 
to be reassigned or encouraged to retire early. Change came surely 
and swiftly for these rocket professionals. Before taking  on a new pro-
gram and having to acquire some new knowledge and learn new skills, 
senior management conducted a brief ceremony. On the front lawn 
in front of the administration building, a table draped in black cloth 
was the focal point. Underneath the cloth was a small replica of the 
old rocket. After the table was uncovered, certain senior managers 
made very brief speeches extolling the former program and the peo-
ple who had contributed to it over the years. All drank a toast, and the 
rocket was then covered again, symbolically buried. The head of the 
organization then gave a short explanation of the new program (solar 
energy for propulsion in space) that was replacing the old. The entire 
event took less than 30 minutes. Accomplished with this event were 
two important outcomes: First, an unequivocal symbolic act demon-
strated the end of the program, and, second, affirmative recognition 
was provided for those who had been involved.  
 Although one may not need to conduct a funeral or demonstrate 
an ending quite as dramatically, two critical principles of managing 
change should be considered, both tied directly to human emotion. 
One is the principle of “unfinished business” and the other concerns 
appealing to rather than ignoring people’s feelings of pride.  
 Unfinished Business  
 When something is incomplete, we humans tend to attempt some 
form of completion. A simple example from introductory psychology 
is when viewing a figure such as the following,  
 
 

194 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 we psychologically close the gap and complete mentally what we 
believe to be a circle. Less simple, but based on the same principle, 
is the situation when we have an argument with someone that soon 
stops for one reason or another yet remains unresolved; one tends to 
continue the argument mentally even though the other party is no 
longer present. We spend mental and emotional energy in an attempt 
to finish, to resolve, to complete the argument. So it is with organi-
zational change. When newness is thrust on organizational members 
replacing, say, former ways of doing things with no time to disengage 
and “finish the business” of the former way, they will spend energy 
trying to deal with the incompleteness. This energy may take the form 
of continuing simply to talk about the former ways, or criticizing the 
new ways as clearly imperfect, or even more resistantly, sabotaging the 
new ways. What is referred to as “resistance to change” often reflects 
energy devoted to closure attempts. Providing some way for organi-
zational members to disengage, to finish, at least to some extent, the 
past helps them to focus on the change and the future.  
 We are not the first to relate this important human principle to 
organizational change. Nadler (1981), building on the theoretical writ-
ings of Lewin and the work of Beckhard and Harris (1987), discusses 
this disengagement process in his integration of a number of man-
aging change principles. He categorizes managing change into three 
broad needs or challenges: (1) the need to motivate change (includ-
ing disengagement), (2) the need to manage the transition, where he 
elaborates on Beckhard and Harris, and (3) the need to shape the 
political dynamics of change. Our treatment of this managing change 
section reflects Nadler’s thinking as well  as others’, for example, Tichy 
(1983) and Tichy and Devanna (1986).  
 Pride 
 Even though pride is among the seven deadly sins, it can be 
appealed to in a positive way. People who have worked in a particular 
job over a period of years typically build feelings of personal pride in 
what they do. Sometimes when change comes and people are told 
they must now do things differently, not their old jobs anymore, an 
implied message may be that what they used to do is now wrong and 
no longer worthwhile. Often the tendency on the part of management 

 
CHAPTER  9 • PLANNING AND MANAGING CHANGE 
195
is to want to “get on with it” and quickly forget the past. We  no longer 
need to manufacture that product, provide that service, and so on.  
 The point is that when change takes place and no time is given 
to recognize that even though an era had ended, what organizational 
members had been doing was worthwhile, they will tend to feel less 
worthwhile themselves. The stronger this feeling, the more organiza-
tional members’ energy will be focused on dealing with their wounded 
pride. Usually a simple yet formal recognition that people had worked 
on important products or services for the organization and that sig-
nificant contributions were made will be sufficient. This kind of act 
again helps organizational members to deal with potentially strong 
human emotions, to achieve some degree of closure, and gradually to 
disengage from the past.  
 Communication  
 It is difficult to communicate too much during a major change 
effort. It is possible, of course. It is possible to communicate so much 
that the messages begin to raise people’s expectations unduly. Just as 
important as the quantity of communicating is, of course, the content. 
Moreover, communicating what will remain the same is as important 
as communicating what will be different. Wisdom from the world of 
counseling and clinical psychology is relevant here.  
 To help individuals cope with and manage change in their lives, 
the wisdom is that of keeping something stable in life while changing 
other aspects. It is not wise to change a career, quit a job, and get 
a divorce all at the same time. Holding on to something that is  not 
changing in life—having an anchor, as it were—helps people signifi-
cantly to deal with the complexity of change in other parts.  
 The same is true at an organizational level. People can more 
adequately deal with and manage what may be considerable chaos 
and complexity with respect to an organizational change effort if they 
know that some aspects of the organization will remain stable—at 
least for the time being. We can more easily handle, say, a major over-
haul of the organization’s structure and even accompanying changes 
in our jobs if we can at the same time be assured that, for example, 
our compensation will not change; that is, the organization’s reward 
system will remain intact.  

196 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Managing the Transition  
 As Beckhard and Harris (1987) emphasize, creating a transition 
management team can be very important and useful to the change 
process. The larger and more complex the change effort, the more 
systematic, concentrated attention needs to be paid to the manage-
ment process. An occasional committee or task force meeting may 
not do the job. It may be wise to appoint a person to manage the 
transition full-time with others assigned on a part-time basis. Large, 
complex change will not manage itself; that’s the point. For a later 
version of this kind of thinking, see Beckhard and Pritchard (1992). 
Other important  factors to manage in the change process, as Nadler 
(1981) had highlighted, are discussed in the following sections.  
 Involvement  
 As noted before, a principle of behavior that is central to effec-
tive management, in general, and managing change, in particular, is 
“Involvement leads to commitment.” Stated a bit more elaborately, 
the degree to which people will be committed to an act is a function 
of the degree to which they have been involved in determining what 
that act will be.  
 For organizational change to occur effectively, it is imperative to 
involve certain key individuals (opinion leaders), perhaps on a sin-
gular, one-on-one basis. But, in general, it is more effective to direct 
change at the group level than at the individual level.  
 If one attempts to change an attitude or the behavior of an indi-
vidual without attempting to change the same behavior or attitude in 
the group to which the individual belongs, then the individual will be 
a deviate and either will come under pressure from the group to get 
back into line or will be rejected entirely. Thus, the major leverage 
point for change is at the group level, for example, by modifying a 
group norm or standards. Recall from  Chapter  3 , “Where Did Orga-
nization Development Come From?,” a key aspect from Kurt Lewin’s 
theory:  
 As long as group standards are unchanged, the individual will 
resist change more strongly the farther he is to depart from 
group standards. If the group standard itself is changed, the 

 
CHAPTER  9 • PLANNING AND MANAGING CHANGE 
197
resistance which is due to the relation between individuals 
and group standard is eliminated (Lewin, 1958, p. 120).  
 For a much later and well-documented rationale for involving 
people in organizational life, in general, and particularly, in change 
efforts, see Lawler (1992).  
 Continuing with this involvement theme, let us now further con-
sider the importance of including people in the implementation of 
goals.  
 For any given change goal, there will likely be multiple paths to 
that goal. Some of these paths may be more efficient than others, 
but most, if not all, paths that people can think of will lead to goal 
accomplishment. Because of circumstances, leaders and managers of 
change may not always involve organizational members to any signifi-
cant degree in establishing the primary goals. For purposes of gain-
ing commitment, involving organizational members in the planning of 
 how to reach those goals is critical, however. 
 To repeat, there are usually different ways to reach a singular goal 
and no one way is always clearly superior. Thus, delegating decisions 
of implementation—that is, allowing organization members who must 
carry out the plans for reaching the goal to determine for themselves 
the steps for getting there—will increase overall commitment to the 
change effort.  
 To gain their commitment, it is beneficial to involve people in 
decisions that will directly affect them. At times, however, only a few 
executives will have the requisite information or relevant experience 
for optimizing the effectiveness of decisions regarding goals. Under 
these conditions, executives can carefully explain to organizational 
members the logic underlying a change decision and they will typi-
cally accept the change goal. To proceed with telling them in detail 
about how to reach the goal is to risk resistance. The point is that 
executives can more easily win acceptance for a predetermined goal, 
provided the goal is viewed  as challenging yet reasonable, than they 
can have a predetermined implementation plan accepted. Commit-
ment, therefore, can be gained by involving organizational members 
in the transition planning and process.  

198 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Multiple Leverage  
 Often managers of change rely too heavily on a singular system 
lever to move the organization toward the desired change. The lever 
most often chosen is structure. “Changing the organizational chart 
will do the job” is a frequent assumption. But in a study of successful 
versus unsuccessful OD efforts, Burke, Clark, and Koopman (1984) 
found that the intervention most associated with lack of success was 
a change in the structure and that intervention was the only change 
made.  
 In large, complex organizations composed of many subsystems, 
when one of these subsystems is changed, eventually all other subsys-
tems will be affected. This principle is based on sound, general sys-
tem theory (Katz & Kahn, 1978). Therefore, when managing change, 
multiple systems, or levers, must be considered. At the top of the 
list is mission and strategy. A change in strategy best precedes struc-
tural change (Chandler, 1962). Moreover, when a structural change is 
made, changes in the management information system are likely to be 
required. Because it is also likely that different management practices 
will be needed, changes in the reward  system to reinforce these new 
practices will help to ensure the overall success of the change effort. 
These points follow from the discussion of the Burke-Litwin model 
and the British Airways example in  Chapter   7 . 
 The general idea to keep in mind, then, is the fact that organiza-
tions are dynamic, open systems. Changing an organization success-
fully requires that attention be paid to its multiplicity of subsystems, 
or levers, in tandem and in mutual support of the overall effort.  
 Feedback  
 In the face of ambiguity about how things are going, people more 
often than not assume the worst. “I knew this change wouldn’t work!” 
To keep momentum, positive energy directed toward the change 
goal(s), providing feedback to organizational members about prog-
ress, regardless of how minor the progress may be, will likely help. 
Periodic progress reports, additional information incorporated within 
the management information system, and conducting brief celebra-
tory events when a change milestone is reached are examples of how 

 
CHAPTER  9 • PLANNING AND MANAGING CHANGE 
199
to monitor progress and, more important, are ways to provide organi-
zational members with relevant feedback.  
 Symbols and Language  
 To keep organizational members focused and oriented, it is ben-
eficial to have some symbol, acronym, or slogan to represent the 
change goal(s). The marketing department can be helpful with this 
process.  
 It is not always possible to state change goals in clear, simple 
statements. Although a new organizational strategy or mission may be 
clear in the minds of senior management because they have discussed 
and debated it for months and months, when put in writing, the new 
strategy may come across to the majority of people in the organization 
as vague, quite general, and abstract. Using a symbol may help not 
only to simplify and clarify the change goal, but also to capture orga-
nizational members’ imagination and enthusiasm as well. A change in 
strategy from a technology-driven organization to a customer-driven 
one might, for example, be symbolized by a question inscribed on, 
for example, a paperweight for each organizational member’s desk or 
work area, which asks “Have you talked with a customer today?”  
 An actual example from the change effort at British Airways (see 
 Chapter  7 ) may help. The example concerned a training of trainers 
program for selected line managers. They were trained to help con-
duct a one-week residential “Managing People First” (MPF) program 
for upper-middle and midlevel management, well over 1,000 manag-
ers in total. Although couched within a training of trainers objective, 
the large, broader objective was to indoctrinate 16 hand-picked, high-
potential managers with the underlying rationale for the specific MPF 
program and for the overall BA cultural change effort. Their broader 
mandate called for them to be change agents, to model  the new 
behaviors associated with the desired culture. They were referred to 
as  culture carriers.  They were to help leverage change. The symbol for 
them was a lever with a hand gripping it and the accompanying slogan 
was the Greek philosopher Archimedes’ famous quote, to paraphrase 
in English, “Give me a fulcrum [lever] and a place to stand, and I will 
move the world.”  

200 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Stabilizing the Change  
 Actually, a part of the stabilization process should begin during 
the disengagement stage. Just as important for organizational mem-
bers to learn about what will be different is to be informed about what 
will  not change. During times of significant change, when people are 
clear about what is not changing amid all that is, they have something 
stable to hold on to, an anchor. For example, even though an organi-
zation might be changing its strategy and structure, people could still 
be rewarded for their performance as before, for example, on merit. 
If they can count on their rewards being administered as before,  this 
element of stability will help them cope with the uncertainties. As a 
close friend once said years ago, “Never try to change everything at 
once.”  
 The reward system is central to stabilizing change once it is under 
way. As new practices begin to occur, as people begin to behave in 
ways that help to move the organization toward the change goal(s), 
and as milestones are reached, the reward system should be deployed 
to reinforce these new, “right” behaviors and directions. As Tom 
Peters has put it, “Catch people doing the right thing.”  
 Formally and publicly recognizing people for having helped to 
move the organization in the change direction will not only serve to 
reinforce and stabilize the new behaviors, but will also send a clear 
signal as well to others in the organization as to what the “right” 
behaviors are.  
 A final process of stabilizing the change, and clearly not mutually 
exclusive from the above points regarding the reward system, is to 
arrange for certain organizational members to serve as “guardians” of 
the new way of doing things (Hornstein, Bunker, Burke, Gindes, & 
Lewicki, 1971). They serve primarily as role models, as  norm carri-
ers of the new culture. Provided these people are carefully selected 
and strategically placed in the organization—that is, they are seen as 
powerful leaders and representative of the future—they can help sig-
nificantly to stabilize the change.  
 By way of summary, refer to  Table  9.1 . The model depicts the 
three broad phases of planning, managing, and stabilizing the change 
effort as well as the more specific activities recommended for each 
phase.

 Theory about Culture Change  1 
 Consulting work on business strategy or implementing the vision 
is stronger today than ever. In fact, when speaking to groups about 
my consulting efforts, I (Burke) characterize myself as working in 
the “McKinsey aftermarket.” (Substitute the name of any number 
of other so-called traditional management consulting firms, and my 
point would remain the same. I simply have followed McKinsey more 
than any other name brand.) In response to a firm’s desire to change 
its strategy or structure, a team from one of these big-name consult-
ing firms sweeps into the client organization and changes things. 
Approximately six months later, someone like  me is called in to help 
make these changes work, the big names having left the scene. I ask 
questions about the organization’s culture and typically find that it 
hasn’t been touched. I then initiate a discussion about the possible 
alignment of the culture with the new strategy, if not new mission; 
the point is that unless key aspects of the culture are modified to fit 
the new mission or strategy, the latter will not work. Now to some 
fundamentals about culture change.  

202 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 When I begin a discussion with an audience about culture change, 
I like to start by writing these three words on an easel pad or overhead 
projection:  
 
•  Values 
 
•  Attitudes 
 
•  Behavior 
 I then ask people to rank these terms according to degree of dif-
ficulty to change. Practically everyone agrees that the order presented 
is the proper ranking from most difficult,  values, to least,  behavior. 
Not that behavior change is simple to do, but comparatively speaking, 
among the three, behavior is the least difficult.  
 I then make the point that you do not change culture by directly 
attempting to change culture, that is, values, norms, deeply held 
beliefs and attitudes, long-standing historical precedence—the pri-
mary ingredients of an organization’s culture. You begin instead with 
the least difficult aspect to change: behavior.  
 Of course, you begin by determining what you want the new 
culture to be (in the case of British Airways, it was to become more 
service-oriented and customer-focused), followed by an identification 
of the behaviors required to realize that new and different culture. 
You work on managers first by identifying as specifically as possible 
the kinds of behavioral practices that will be manifestations of the 
desired culture, such as, for example, “Communicating with others in 
an open and frank manner,” or “Involving subordinates in decisions 
that directly affect their work.” Next, you train managers in these 
behavioral practices primarily via  feedback and role or skill practice. 
Then you include these new practices in managers’ performance 
appraisals and incorporate pay for performance so that the more man-
agers actually use the practices, the more incentive pay they receive. 
To summarize, first you announce the change regarding the culture. 
Second, you get managers’ attention by training them in the practices. 
Third, you measure their degree of use of the practices. And, finally, 
you reward them when they employ the practices. These were steps 
followed in the British Airways change effort (see  Chapter   7 ). 
 I have grossly oversimplified the complicated change process. 
So, let me ground this summary in a theory you may have heard in 

 
CHAPTER  9 • PLANNING AND MANAGING CHANGE 
203
Psychology 101—the James-Lange theory. In essence, the theory is 
stated as follows: “I am afraid because I run” is more accurate than “I 
run because I am afraid.”  
 At first, this sounds illogical. Around the turn of this century, the 
two theorists, James and Lange, the former a psychologist and the 
latter a physiologist, stated essentially the same idea independent of 
each other—that we act first and then attribute to that act a reason or 
at least a label for the action. Many years later, Stan Schacter (1959) 
conducted a series of laboratory experiments with humans that pro-
vided considerable support for the James-Lange theory. I have been 
a fan of the theory for a long time and follow the reasoning when 
consulting about planning and managing change in  an organization’s 
culture.  
 We first get managers to move behaviorally in the direction of the 
desired culture. At British Airways, this was the “Managing People 
First” program. We provide certain labels for clusters of these behav-
iors. These labels are actually values. Again, in the case of British Air-
ways, these cluster labels of values (a total of four) were  clarity and 
helpfulness, promoting achievement, influencing through personal 
excellence and teamwork, and  care and trust. As managers begin to 
move (behave) in the desired direction, they get rewarded for doing 
so. As they behave and get rewarded for it every time, they begin to 
believe that this new way of managing is actually a good thing. If they 
believe it is good, then a value has been affected, and values, in part, 
comprise culture.  
 Eventually, then, culture change has begun to occur—but you act 
first, then help with reasons, labels, and values. All this may and prob-
ably should be stated at the outset. “With the new, desired culture we 
are attempting to adhere to a revitalized mission with a different strat-
egy that will be supported by those values (for example, to be num-
ber one in customer service).” Organizational members’ reactions are 
likely to be “Sounds good, but we’ll see...” or “I’ll believe it when I 
see it.” So, for the sake of actual change, you plunge ahead with the 
behaviors because if you delay  by trying to explain and explain, the 
“we’ll see” attitude will never be addressed.  
 Even grounded in some theory, you may still say that it is more 
complicated than that—and you would be correct. Beginning in 

204 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
the mid-1980s, and particularly with my work at British Airways, I 
felt a strong need for a larger organizational framework that would 
help to guide the change effort. This need led to George Litwin and 
my developing a broader organizational model of performance and 
change that we found to be very useful for planning and managing 
change in large, complex systems such as BA (Burke & Litwin, 1992; 
see  Chapter  7 ). The point is that it is critical to conceptualize culture 
in a broader framework.  
 In summary, one does not change (or shape) organizational cul-
ture by trying to change organizational culture directly. Values, per-
haps the essential ingredient of culture, are difficult to change. First, 
then, leaders must identify the critical values. Second, rather than 
announce the values and expect employees to adopt them (not unlike 
trying to shape or change culture by directly trying to change it), orga-
nizational leaders must provide ways for the values to be incorpo-
rated within people’s behavior. Thus, after providing the direction, 
the value choice is clearly the first step, the next immediate step is 
behavioral. Remember that behavior is easier,  in relative terms to be 
sure, to change and shape than values and attitudes.  
 Measuring Progress of the Change Effort  
 How can you tell if you are making any progress in a change 
effort? The general answer to this question is, “Not in the most obvi-
ous ways.” There are at least four ways to tell:  
  
1.  The quantity of problems that organizational members must 
handle may not decrease. In the short run, it may even increase. 
A clear sign of progress, though, is that the nature of problems 
has changed. Organization members are dealing with new and 
different problems.  
  
2.  When organizational members express frustration about lack of 
progress regarding change, as paradoxical as it might seem such 
expression is a clear sign of progress. People are complaining 
about the right things. The following illustration should help to 
clarify this point.  

 
CHAPTER  9 • PLANNING AND MANAGING CHANGE 
205
 
  During the early 1960s, Abraham Maslow spent a summer ob-
serving work in a high-tech company in Southern California. 
He kept a diary of his observations and later converted it into a 
book (Maslow, 1965). One of his observations stands out—his 
distinction between grumbles and meta-grumbles. Grumbles 
are complaints about relatively small matters: “We never seem 
to have enough copy machines that are in good operating con-
dition.” “Why can’t someone arrange for better maintenance of 
this building?” In other words, the grumbles concern hygiene 
factors, to use Herzberg’s term, those aspects of work life that 
contribute to one’s level of dissatisfaction.  Meta-grumbles, on 
the other hand, are complaints about such things as lack of clar-
ity about goals, people needing to have more autonomy in car-
rying out their assignments, or expressing a desire for great-
er teamwork and collaboration. These complaints are about 
broader organizational concerns, usually beyond an individual 
matter. Maslow contended that managers should be happy to 
hear meta-grumbles, that underneath such complaining was 
motivation to be tapped and directed for the good of the over-
all organization. So it is in assessing progress toward change. 
Meta-grumbles should be music to management’s ears.  
  
3.  When issues, concerns, and progress reports regarding the 
change effort routinely become a part of the agenda for regular 
managers and staff meetings, that is a sign of progress. This 
means that the change effort is being monitored and constantly 
attended to.  
  
4.  And, finally, indicative of progress are special events held from 
time to time that assess progress, reevaluate the direction, 
celebrate milestones achieved, and recognize individuals and 
groups for their accomplishments in helping with the change 
effort.      
 Conclusion  
 In this chapter, we have considered the planning and manage-
ment of change. The overall process is what OD practitioners refer 

206 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
to as the intervention phase. According to Argyris (1970), an effective 
intervention is one that (1) provides  valid information for the client 
organization, (2) allows for  choice by the client regarding the specific 
steps to be taken, and (3) leads to  commitment on the client’s part to 
those action steps for change.  
 In planning change, it is important, first, to assure that a need 
for change is determined if not developed and, second, to address 
the power and political dynamics of the organization. Managing the 
change effort is essentially transition management and concerns dis-
engaging from the past, communicating with people about the change, 
involving people in implementation planning, organizing a transition 
management team, using multiple leverages, providing feedback, 
and creating symbols and language to help focus the effort. The final 
phase, stabilizing the change, consists of utilizing the reward system 
to reinforce the new “ways of doing things” and putting into place  key 
individuals to serve as “guardians” of the change goal(s).  
 Because we have stipulated that OD is a process of change in the 
organization’s culture, it is imperative that we are grounded in theory 
about this kind of change and that we conceptualize our effort within 
some overall framework or model.  
 Four ways to assess progress toward the change were covered. 
The four—different problems, meta-grumbles, change concerns as a 
regular part of a meeting agenda, and progress review events—were 
described as not-so-obvious ways to determine progress.  
 Two Caveats 
 This chapter has been a description of how OD—planned change 
in the organization’s culture—is often conducted. The explanations 
of planning and managing change have a history dating back to 1959. 
But as  Chapter  2 , “Organization Development Then and Now,” 
spelled out, things have changed over this more than half a century—
and they continue to change even more rapidly. Speed and agility are 
the orders of the day. Thus, the way we have learned to do OD might 
need to change. Imagine that! Two examples in the form of caveats 
follow:  

 
CHAPTER  9 • PLANNING AND MANAGING CHANGE 
207
  
1.  Clients are not as patient as they once were. Just one example 
will illustrate the point. Conducting a thorough diagnosis to 
establish the basis (with data) for an appropriate intervention 
takes time—weeks not days. As the OD consultant, you want 
to be comprehensive and collect data from multiple sources via 
interviews, perhaps a survey (not to mention the time it takes 
to construct a relevant and tailored questionnaire in the first 
place), archival records, visiting a plant, and maybe observe 
several executive meetings. But executives today can rarely tol-
erate taking the amount of time a complete diagnosis would 
require. They  know their own organization and don’t need 
someone else to tell them. Besides there are too many pressing 
matters that need immediate attention. So, what is a despairing 
OD practitioner to do?  
 
  Once again, Kurt Lewin’s thinking can be helpful regarding this 
problem of “not enough time.” In so many words, he once said 
something like, “If you want to understand an organization, try 
to change it.” In other words, when an intervention, of practi-
cally any kind, is made in the organization, forces emerge to 
return the organization to its state of equilibrium. An interven-
tion toward change disturbs and perturbs the system. Paying 
attention to the nature of these forces; that is, organizational 
members’  reactions to the disturbance, often perceived as re-
sistance, reveals for the OD consultant a picture or story about 
the  true nature of the system particularly its culture. In other 
words, the data for diagnosis are people’s behavioral reactions 
to the intrusion. It is analogous to the saying that you really 
never fully understand someone until you see him or her con-
fronted with if not tested under trying circumstances. The point 
of this caveat, therefore, is to understand that an organization 
does not always have to follow all of the processes and phases 
covered in this chapter. Sometimes it is really okay to go with an 
intervention that you have doubts about simply to learn about 
the organization via the  reactions. Equal in importance to the 
goal of change is to learn as much as possible along the way. 

208 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
  
2.  No two people—even identical twins—are exactly the same. 
So it is with organizations. We can differentiate organizations 
in many ways; profit-nonprofit, large-small, global-regional, 
government-nongovernment, for example, NGO, private-
public, and so on. One very important distinction is how loose 
or tight the organization may be regarding its structure, mode 
of operation, leadership, and so on. This particular distinction 
is usually referred to as tightly coupled systems compared with 
loosely coupled systems. A paragon of the tight system is the 
U.S. Marine Corps; a network exemplifies the loose system.  
 
  The development and growth of OD has largely been based 
on work with tightly coupled systems, the goal being to “loosen 
them up.” If the goal is to “tighten” a network, would the OD 
procedure be the same? The answer is, of course, “not exactly.” 
This second caveat, then, is again a word of caution regarding 
the application of “regular” OD processes, which work well 
with tightly coupled systems but will need to be modified when 
working with a loosely coupled system. The purpose of our next 
chapter is to address this caveat.

 Understanding and Changing Loosely 
Coupled Systems  1 
 Imagine for a moment a network of eight organizations spread 
across the United States from Los Angeles to New York City that 
operated quite autonomously yet were held together by a small head-
quarters composed of a paid part-time administrator and ten elected 
professionals who served voluntarily as a board of directors with a 
president and various committee heads. The network had recently 
experienced a breach of policy and violation of norms by a small group 
of members. This jolt to the network system led to an emergency 
meeting of the board of directors to determine what happened, why 
the breach  occurred, and what, if anything, should be done about it. 
Led by the president, the board decided to take action. A consultant 
was contracted to help with a fundamental change of the system.  
 Now imagine yourself as the hired consultant. You have consider-
able experience, especially within the corporate world, and a solid 
reputation as an organization change expert. This expertise, however, 
is primarily with tightly coupled systems consisting of clearly defined 
hierarchies and strong interdependence of subsystems—think Gen-
eral Motors, for example—and this client is a network with only a 
modicum of hierarchy and practically no interdependence among its 
eight centers nor with headquarters. These differences are significant 
and should be treated as such—differently. Although written with a 
request to use one’s imagination regarding a loosely coupled network 
and being a consultant to such a system, this opening gambit is not 
merely an imaginary exercise. Rather, the imagining is based on an 
actual case, an example of a short-term success as an organization 
change effort yet within the span of approximately two years resulting 
in a failure. With linkage to theory for help with understanding, the 

210 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
story is told by Noumair, Winderman, and Burke (2010). For a con-
densed version of the story, see  Chapter  12 in the text by Burke 
(2014b).  
 The failure experience with attempting to change this network, a 
loosely coupled system, brings to the forefront of our thinking how 
much has changed since the  Journal of Applied Behavioral Science 
(JABS) was launched 50 years ago. See  Chapter  2 , “Organization 
Development Then and Now,” for brief descriptions of many of these 
changes. Interestingly, during that same time period 50 years ago, the 
Organization Development Network was formed, the Civil Rights law 
was enacted, two scientists at Bell Labs went public with their Big 
Bang theory, and for the first time a Ford Mustang rolled off the 
assembly line. In other  words, 1964 was quite a year!  
 Back then, our focus was on large bureaucracies such as “MA 
Bell,” the Red Cross, Sears, the military, and the Episcopal Church. 
The case described in  Chapter  1 , “What Is Organization Develop-
ment?,” is illustrative. We didn’t have global banks, Walmart, NGOs, 
Silicon Valley, or even network organizations as we know them today. 
Our world has become tighter—that is, more interconnected and 
interdependent—and at the same time looser—less centrally con-
trolled, with government being less able to influence its citizenry, and 
so forth. See  Chapter  2 for additional examples. As we know, technol-
ogy and especially social media has enabled a lot of this change, which 
makes true network organizations possible. So,  JABS began with an 
emphasis on “loosening up” rather than “tightening up.” At the risk of 
jumping ahead, we are now challenged to get out in front of what is 
happening in organizations today with innovative change methods 
instead of continuing and trying to perfect techniques of change that 
may not be as relevant as they once were. But not everything has 
changed. At the core of what we do in the realm of organization devel-
opment and change, whether a bureaucracy or a network, are human 
relationships in organizations.  
 Staying with the perspective of “not everything has changed,” let 
us address two additional and important precautions regarding either-
or thinking before getting to the central theme of this chapter.  

 CHAPTER  10 • UNDERSTANDING AND CHANGING LOOSELY COUPLED SYSTEMS 
211
 Two Precautions Regarding Either-Or Thinking  
 First, we organizational theorists and practitioners, at times, may 
have a tendency to think in either-or terms regarding organizations—
profit versus nonprofit, small-to-medium sized versus large and more 
complex, loosely coupled versus tightly coupled, and so on. We know 
better, of course. We know, for example, that the so-called bottom line 
for profit and nonprofit organizations is not the same, but there are 
at the same time many similarities; for example, hierarchy, functional 
silos, and issues of communication and collaboration. Small organiza-
tions such as a boutique consulting firm are not as complicated to 
operate effectively as a global corporation of 50,000 people, yet issues 
of leadership and goal clarity exist in both. There are other either-or 
examples, but the focus for this chapter concerns one such example 
only—loosely coupled versus tightly coupled systems. As Karl Weick 
(2001) has pointed out, and as noted above, a tightly coupled system 
can be characterized by two primary qualities—hierarchy and inter-
dependence, whereas a loosely coupled system may or may not have 
much of a hierarchy and parts of the system are rarely dependent on 
one another for purposes of accomplishing tasks. For the epitome of 
tight, think U.S. Marine Corps, and for loose, think network. These  
two organizations, military and network, do appear to be very dif-
ferent—and they are. Yet, again, similarities exist. In recent times, 
when thinking of a network, al-Qaida has come to mind, a system that 
appears to have little hierarchy and scant interdependence. An article, 
however, published by the Associated Press (Callimachi, 2013) pro-
vided evidence to show that even al-Qaida has its own bureaucracy. 
Documents found in an abandoned house during January of 2013 in 
Timbuktu, Mali, included more than 100 receipts for purchases made 
ranging from food, to supplies for autos, to guns and ammunition. 
Also discovered were workshop schedules, salary spreadsheets, job 
applications, and memos from the equivalent of a human resources 
division. Al-Qaida has a financial policy across all divisions accompa-
nied with regular bookkeeping techniques. In other words, al-Qaida 
is not an unorganized, like-minded assemblage of individuals but, 
rather, an attempt to operate like a multinational corporation. Either-
or thinking, therefore, is unwarranted. Even al-Qaida sees the value 
of at least some bureaucracy.  

212 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Apparently, executives running high-tech firms in Silicon Valley 
have not seen such value. The lead sentence for another article from 
the news media ( The New York Times ) stated “The dirtiest word in 
Silicon Valley is bureaucracy.” The reporter, Claire C. Miller (Miller, 
2014), noted that high-tech executives tend to equate bureaucracy 
with the human resource (HR) function. Her article is based on the 
Stanford Project on Emerging Companies, a longitudinal study of 
200 Silicon Valley start-ups beginning with the initial dot-com boom 
(Baron & Hannan, 2002). The study showed that high-tech entrepre-
neurs paid little attention to HR. In fact, “Nearly  half of the companies 
left it up to employees to shape the culture and perform traditional 
human resource tasks. Only 6.6 percent had the type of formal per-
sonnel management seen at typical companies” (Miller, 2014, p. B3). 
It may be that Google was among this 6.6 percent. In any case, it 
should be noted that Google has been dedicated to the people side of 
their business. And they have been innovative regarding HR. Maybe 
it is not whether you have HR but what kind of HR you have. Google’s 
HR function is more about development and change and less about  
following a personnel manual. HR unfortunately has been a hand-
maiden of power, tightening up talent management, compensation 
and reward systems, and so on. But what is needed today is for HR to 
develop more innovative and agile cultures. Google may be leading 
the way here. Incidentally, one of the first actions that the new head 
of HR, Nick Georgiades, at British Airways took when a significant 
culture change was launched in the 1980s was to toss out all of the 
personnel manuals and start over—see  Chapter  7 , “The Burke-Litwin 
Model of Organizational Performance and Change,” in this volume 
and  Chapter 11 in Burke (2014b) for the story of change at British 
Airways.  
 A side benefit from the data underlying the study at Silicon Val-
ley by Baron and Hannan (2002) was that for the few high-tech firms 
that did have an HR function, there were much better prospects for 
employment of women in technical roles. Moreover, when high-
tech companies left HR responsibilities for organizational members, 
regardless of function, to perform such tasks as hiring new employ-
ees, diversification suffered because the workers selected those for 
employment who were like themselves, including “too much empha-
sis on new employees’ fitting into the existing culture” (Miller, 2014, 

 CHAPTER  10 • UNDERSTANDING AND CHANGING LOOSELY COUPLED SYSTEMS 
213
p. B3). This executive naiveté can obviously lead to significant issues 
for high-tech firms such as discrimination and groupthink (Janis, 
1972), which are the opposite of what executives say they want—
nimbleness, agility, innovation, and creativity. Can there be too much 
looseness? Of course.  
 A  second precaution concerns thinking in either-or terms regard-
ing the change process. Change is change, after all, and one is not 
likely to go far astray when following the basics of organization change 
consulting; that is, entry, contracting, data gathering, diagnosis, feed-
back, and intervention planned and implemented according to (a) 
the data and (b) reactions of the client to the feedback of the data. 
Regardless of system type or category, then, following this process is 
appropriate. The difference is a matter of  where to focus our efforts 
and  what to seek to change. More about following the organization 
development (OD) sequence yet differently  when working with a 
loosely coupled system is provided later in this chapter.  
 As we know, like individuals, no two organizations are the same. 
Although as change leaders and consultants, we need to follow prin-
ciples of organization change that are based on sound theory and 
research; at the same time, we should pay considerable attention to 
the idiosyncrasies of how the organization at hand differs from all oth-
ers.  2 As noted already, we can be undermined in our consulting work 
by either-or thinking, but understanding the differences between a 
profit-making corporation and a nonprofit organization can be helpful 
for where to focus the change effort. For example, with a corpora-
tion, we will need to place  emphasis on the competitive marketplace, 
whereas with a nonprofit, we should concentrate, at least at the 
outset, on mission. There is overlap, of course, between profit and 
nonprofit organizations, yet understanding the differences is key to 
leading and contributing to a successful change effort. And there is 
overlap between loosely coupled and tightly coupled systems, but the 
purpose of this chapter is to concentrate on the former, not the lat-
ter. There are sufficient differences between the two types of systems 
that demand our attention if we are serious about changing a loosely 
coupled system. Thus, the purpose of this chapter  is an attempt to 
enhance our understanding of how to change a loosely coupled sys-
tem. Before moving on, let us quickly reinforce one final point of clar-
ification that was previously noted: We will consider networks  writ 

214 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
large ; that is, there are networks that are stand-alone organizations 
such as the OD Network, the NTL Institute for Applied Behavioral 
Science, and the A.K. Rice Institute, and there are networks, primar-
ily informal, that exist within large, bureaucratic organizations. The 
latter is often considered the informal organization that parallels the 
formal system.  
 The Change Problem  
 With the preceding comments and precautions serving as back-
ground and context, let us now continue with a statement of the prob-
lem—attempting to change a loosely coupled system, which is not the 
same as trying to change a tightly coupled system—followed by cov-
erage of a primary intervention for doing so, social network analysis, 
and then address additional and important issues that we need to be 
more informed about as we move forward with our learning process 
regarding organization change. As mentioned earlier, the impetus for 
this exploration emerged from a consulting experience with a network 
that began successfully but ultimately became  a failure. Part of the 
explanation for this failure was the consultant’s use of standard and 
accepted organization development (OD) techniques, social technol-
ogy that may not be appropriate for attempting to tighten a loosely 
coupled system. The social technology of OD was essentially derived 
in the late 1950s, early 1960s, from consulting experiences with tightly 
coupled systems; that is, attempts to loosen bureaucracy, to involve 
organizational members in the change process, and to follow Lewin’s 
three-step process of unfreeze, change, refreeze. To return to the 
thinking of Weick (2001), this approach for changing a loosely cou-
pled system may not be appropriate. In fact, he suggested approaches 
that were directly opposite to “normal” OD change efforts. Instead 
of a planned approach, he suggested improvisation; instead of a large 
system focus, he suggested working at local levels; and change should 
be considered as continuous not episodic.  Table  10.1 , taken from 
Burke (2011a), provides a summary of these contrasts.

 For those of us who “grew up” with social technology for chang-
ing tightly coupled systems, how do we now expand our consulting 
repertoire to deal more effectively with changing a loosely coupled 
system? Moreover, how do we focus more on continuous change on 
a smaller scale that may from time to time be improvisational and 
accommodative to the client at local levels? And what about those 
organizations that are hard to classify and therefore present a compli-
cated challenge regarding change, organizations such as a university, 
a partnership, or even the Academy of Management and the Society 
for Industrial and Organizational  Psychology?  
 One response to those questions is to bear in mind that organiza-
tions are both loose and tight. Again, rather than thinking in either-or 
terms, it is likely to be more productive to determine within a given 
organization what should be tightened and what should be loosened. 
Perhaps, for example, in a university, financial matters should be fairly 
tight whereas curriculum decisions should be loose and localized.  
 Yet the fact remains that at least for the world of OD, we know 
less about how to work with, if not change, loosely coupled systems. 
For example, it may be more useful to rely on an intervention such as 
social network analysis than, say, the Burke-Litwin model—a hereti-
cal thought. Maybe a better answer is to use both, a social network 
analysis superimposed on the Burke-Litwin model. For another 
example of combining two perspectives (overt and covert) using the 
Burke-Litwin model, see  Chapter  8 , “Understanding Organizations: 
Covert Processes.” In any case, what we need to learn more about 
is what  new, if not different, diagnostic and intervention tools have 

216 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
potential for improving our work with loosely coupled systems such 
as social network analysis, boundary spanning strategies and practices, 
large group interventions, and a consultant role that is more direct 
and serves as a “go-between” across independent units, which may 
need more active interaction such as convening a meeting rather than 
merely a role of facilitation. We also need to be clear about what OD 
interventions serve change well regardless of how much the organiza-
tion is loose or tight, such as involvement techniques, creating a sense 
of need if not urgency,  and developing a vision for change.  
 Loosely Coupled Systems and the Change 
Process: Social Network Analysis  
 One of my (Burke) early experiences with an informal social net-
work was long ago in the late 1950s when I was serving two years of 
full-time, active duty in the U.S. Army. In those days, there was a mili-
tary draft and every able-bodied young man had to serve a minimum 
of two years in the military. In college, I joined the Reserve Officer 
Training Corps (ROTC) in the hopes of making my two years more 
bearable as an officer instead of an enlisted man. After artillery school 
at Ft. Sill, Oklahoma, I was assigned to an armored artillery battery 
(company)  in the Second Armored Division at Ft. Hood, Texas. Soon 
I was given a special assignment by one of the senior officers at the 
battalion level, Major Saldana. He wanted me to build for training 
purposes a miniature artillery range on some vacant land on the post. 
My deadline was one month. The practice range required digging 
long ditches, constructing a replica of a mountain range with the dirt, 
and setting up small air cannons that fired steel balls for up to several 
hundred yards. This meant reassigning, at least temporarily, soldiers 
from the battery, providing them with shovels, rakes,  and other tools 
to construct the range. I didn’t see how we could do it in a month. And 
besides the soldiers would complain and, if not ever so subtlety, rebel. 
I called my staff of sergeants (all grizzled and highly experienced) 
together to help me figure out what to do. They agreed that we had 
little time to accomplish this task. My most senior sergeant suddenly 
had an idea. He had a buddy over in engineering at the division level 

 CHAPTER  10 • UNDERSTANDING AND CHANGING LOOSELY COUPLED SYSTEMS 
217
who was “sitting on a bulldozer with nothing to do.” I asked the ser-
geant if we could get him  to come over and do the digging, moving, 
the dirt, etc. He said “no problem.” The bulldozer friend and several 
others came over and helped us to complete the job in less than a 
month. Major Saldana was very pleased. Within a few days, however, 
I was in trouble. The major called me into his office. I stood before 
him at attention and answered his questions nervously yet truthfully. 
I was then reprimanded for having violated the chain of command. 
I had not formally requisitioned the bulldozer and crew via division 
headquarters. Major Saldana knew that he had to reprimand  me, yet 
at the same time, he was clearly pleased that he now had his prized 
practice range, and on time. I was later promoted to the rank of first 
lieutenant in spite of the previous reprimand. Achieving goals counts 
for a lot in any organization.  
 This tale from my Army days illustrates the simultaneous exis-
tence of formal and informal systems. My sergeant and his bulldozer 
buddy were “members” of an informal social network, which existed 
within a highly formal organization. It is no secret that in such systems 
informal relations can facilitate work getting done by “going around” 
the formalities. In fact, Army lore has it that World War II would not 
have been won without the Army’s informal social networks.  
 As we know, most organizations have both a formal system and an 
informal one. Each is overlaid on the other. An interesting hypothesis 
in this regard is that the tighter the formal system, the more prevalent 
and active the informal system, the social network.  
 With respect to the term  network, let us pause for a moment and 
attempt to be clear. There are two categories. One is the informal 
system within an organization, the U.S. Army example just described, 
and the other is the external or stand-alone category; that is, the orga-
nization itself. Al-Qaida, the A.K. Rice Institute, and the OD Net-
work are examples of this second category. What the two forms of 
networks have in common is “looseness,” with no formal hierarchy 
and little interdependence. It may be that an informal system within 
an organization is somewhat tighter than a free-standing network, but 
we  are considering a degree of difference, not an either-or situation. 
What now follows is a description of a useful tool for assessing either 
category of network.  

218 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 A  social network analysis is a data-gathering tool for assessing or 
mapping the informal system; that is, networks in and of themselves 
or networks within a large formal system. Organizational members 
respond to a brief questionnaire asking them to identify the people 
with whom they interact within the organization. The interaction can 
be defined as information exchange, informal relationships, simply as 
those one works with most closely, and so on. As you might imagine, 
asking the right question(s) is very important. The typical outcome 
is a computer-generated “picture” or map with small circles or dots 
depicting organizational members and lines between  the circles that 
show who relates with whom and perhaps how often.  
 Incidentally, an early and simple version of such a network was 
recently presented at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. 
It showed the network of artists, broadly defined, in the early twen-
tieth century (1910–1925) in terms of who was in the network and 
who interacted with whom. The circle in the center with the most 
connective lines was none other than Picasso. To remind us of the 
importance of loose systems, that network is now framed and hanging 
in our offices.  
 There is a considerable body of literature on social network analy-
sis. See, for example, Freeman (2006), Kilduff and Tsai (2003), Knoke 
and Yang (2008), Wasserman and Faust (1994), and since 1979, there 
has been a journal devoted to the field:  Social Networks :  An Interna-
tional Journal of Structural Analysis . 
 Although smaller in scope, there is a growing interest in social 
network analysis and organization change. One rather complex study 
regarding organization change was conducted by Battilana and Cas-
ciaro (2012). They analyzed 68 organizational change initiatives that 
were conducted in the early 2000s in the National Health Service 
of the United Kingdom. These change initiatives were attempted by 
 change agents operating within networks existing in the larger for-
mal system. Many of the initiatives were attempts to shift decision 
making from physicians to nurses; for example, decisions regarding 
the dismissal of patients from the hospital. This decision example 
is one that Battilana  and Casciaro considered to be quite divergent 
from the status quo and therefore consisted of contingencies that 
were complex. Change leaders ( agents as these researchers referred 

 CHAPTER  10 • UNDERSTANDING AND CHANGING LOOSELY COUPLED SYSTEMS 
219
to them) were therefore predominantly members of nurses’ networks. 
These networks were classified by the researchers as either tight—a 
cohesive network of closely linked  social actors —or loose, referred 
to as having a low degree of structural closure, which, according to 
Burt (2005), is considered to be full of “structural holes.” Battilana 
and Casciaro hypothesized that the looser the network, the more 
likely the change leader would “initiate a change that diverges from 
the institutional status  quo” (p. 383). But initiation of change is one 
thing and acceptance of the change is another. Thus, the research-
ers’ second hypothesis was that the tighter the network to which the 
change leader belonged—tight or structured closure being a function 
of group pressure and redundancy of information; that is, the tighter 
the network, the more information is limited—the less likely a change 
that was divergent from the status quo would be adopted. In other 
words, a tight network will foster change that is less divergent but hin-
der a change that is more divergent. Resistance to the more divergent 
change comes  from peer pressure and a deficiency of novel think-
ing. Battilana and Casciaro (2012) conclude their extensive research 
article with the following statements:  
 Structural holes in change agents’ networks increase the like-
lihood that these actors will initiate organizational changes 
with a higher degree of divergence from the institutional 
status quo. The effects of structural holes on a change agents’ 
ability to persuade organizational constituencies to adopt a 
change, however, are strictly contingent on the change’s 
degree of divergence from the institutional status quo. Struc-
tural holes in a change agent’s network aid the adoption of 
changes that diverge from the institutional status quo, but 
they hinder the adoption of less divergent changes (p. 393).  
 The Battilana and Casciaro study helps us to understand more 
thoroughly how internal organizational networks, one version of the 
intraorganizational context, affect organization change. Should their 
contingency theory showing the difference between initiation and the 
adoption of change gain further empirical support, there are at least 
 three primary implications for practice.  First, we need to be clear about 
the fact that networks, while having common properties, for example, 
little if any hierarchy, are not the same. They differ particularly with 

220 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
respect to how tight (structured closure) or how loose (consisting of 
structural holes) they are. Tight networks may facilitate continuous 
improvement but  hinder large-scale transformation.  
 A  second implication for practice concerns how divergent from 
the status quo the proposed change may be. Novel and divergent 
ideas are more likely to come from loose networks but are difficult to 
get adopted. Adoption and implementation of change, to be success-
ful, means that people must pull together, collaborate, and support 
one another. Tighter networks facilitate this kind of process, which, in 
turn, leads to the  third implication for practice. 
 It is useful to think of different people taking on different roles 
in a change effort, in this case change initiators and change imple-
menters. Because the former are more likely to emerge from a loose 
network and a successful implementer from a tight network, two dif-
ferent roles by two different people may work better than a single 
role/individual for both. In other words, different people have dif-
ferent skills. Thinking comparatively, consider Burke’s (2014b) appli-
cation of Gladwell’s (2000) identification of people in organizations 
who have social power—salesmen, mavens, and connectors—from 
his book,  The Tipping Point. Some individuals are much better at  sell-
ing ideas than others; some (mavens) are unusual sources of informa-
tion, for example, knowing who knows what, where important records 
are kept, and so on; and still others are highly skillful at connecting 
people, suggesting, for example, that two people the connector knows 
but who do not know one another need to meet because they have 
common causes and values.  
 In a comprehensive article on integrating social network analy-
sis and boundary spanning, Cross, Ernst, and Pasmore (2013) have 
addressed similar issues to the points we are attempting to clarify in 
this chapter. For example, they explain the importance of social net-
work analysis as a significant tool for facilitating organization change 
and define five roles that the network technique helps to identify. 
These roles are as follows:  
 
•   Connector.  Those who support people in the organization by 
providing information and assistance. This role is similar to 
Gladwell’s connectors.  

 CHAPTER  10 • UNDERSTANDING AND CHANGING LOOSELY COUPLED SYSTEMS 
221
 
•   Expert.  Those who have specific knowledge and experience 
that may be useful in times of change. This role is also similar to 
Gladwell’s mavens.  
 
•   Broker.  Those who bridge boundaries and are typically trusted 
by a variety of groups.  
 
•   Energizer.  Network members who enthusiastically support 
the changes that are needed. These individuals are not unlike 
Gladwell’s salesmen.  
 
•   Resister.  Practically the opposite of energizers, those who tend 
to block a change effort. As Cross and colleagues put it, these 
can be only a few people but “5% of employees cause 95% of 
the misery” (p. 83).  
 Cross et al. (2013) go on to argue persuasively that many orga-
nization change failures are due to an inability and/or perhaps an 
unwillingness to work across boundaries, such as vertical (hierarchy 
and status), horizontal (peers, competitors, experts), stakeholder 
(partners, constituencies), demographic (gender, age, culture), and 
geographic (location, markets). Their organization change model is 
therefore an integration of network analysis and boundary spanning; 
that is, the network analysis helps to identify the key roles for effective 
boundary spanning.  
 The point is that attempting to launch and implement successful 
change in an organization is a complicated endeavor and different 
players with different skill sets are required. Finally, with respect to 
selecting and supporting such players for the change process, the con-
text must be taken into account. For example, initiators and salesmen 
of change may need to come from loose networks and implementers, 
experts, and connectors from tight networks, although as Gray (2014) 
has cautioned, connectors may not be able to operate effectively in 
tight networks because there are less structural holes.  
 In summary, networks exist as organizations themselves and 
within larger bureaucracies. Although we usually classify a network as 
a loosely coupled system, as the Battilana and Casciaro (2012) study 
demonstrated, networks within these larger systems vary in terms 
of looseness (structural holes) and tightness (structural closure). As 
a reminder, the common denominator for networks, as a rule, is 

222 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
characterized as having little if any hierarchy and little if any interde-
pendences among its members.  
 The technique of choice for studying networks is some form of 
a social network analysis that serves as both a diagnostic instrument 
and an intervention. Diagnostically, the assessment provides a map 
or “picture” of the network with dots or small circles representing 
individuals in terms of where and how they are connected with one 
another. Providing this map as feedback to the network members, 
however, has consequences, thus becoming an intervention into the 
system. For example, depending on what connective questions are 
asked and perhaps how permanent or temporary the network is, often 
people do not want to be identified. In other words, some individuals 
may be outliers in the network and would not like for that informa-
tion to be made public. The exact content of the question(s) and how 
feedback is provided are obviously important.  
 Loosely Coupled Systems and the Change 
Process: Additional Potential Interventions  
 The premise of this chapter is to argue that loosely coupled sys-
tems indeed differ from those systems that are tight and, therefore, 
with respect to change interventions, different approaches should 
be considered and implemented. Bear in mind, however, that many 
organization development and change interventions that work well 
with tightly coupled systems are applicable and appropriate for work-
ing with loosely coupled systems. Examples include crafting vision 
and mission statements, executive coaching, team building, leader-
ship development, negotiation, intergroup conflict resolution, force 
field analysis, and dealing with resistance, to name a few.  
 A particularly suitable intervention that can serve either a loosely 
coupled system or a tightly coupled system effectively is the set of 
“large system interventions” that include such activities as Fast Cycle 
Full Participation, Future Search, Open Space Technology, Search 
Conference, and Workout. For an overview of these interventions 
and their use, see Bunker and Alban (2002).  

 CHAPTER  10 • UNDERSTANDING AND CHANGING LOOSELY COUPLED SYSTEMS 
223
 The objective of a large system intervention is, if possible, to get 
the entire organization in the same room (space) at the same time. 
Achieving this objective for a network can be especially helpful as well 
as dramatic because coming together could be rare if not a first-time 
event. Just seeing everyone “all at once” can be a significant interven-
tion itself.  
 A network that is a stand-alone organization may be more amena-
ble to interventions that have also worked well with large bureaucra-
cies such as the large-group methods noted above, but perhaps less 
well if not inappropriate for networks that exist within the larger more 
tightly coupled system. With respect to networks as informal organi-
zations within a larger system, we can think in terms of using these 
networks as vehicles for implementing change in the more formal sys-
tem. The  parallel organization  as such a vehicle that emerged in the 
1970s comes to mind, also referred to as the collateral organization.  
 Developed by Zand (1974) and Howard Carlson when he was 
head of OD at General Motors (GM) in the 1970s (Miller, 1978), 
elaborated on by Stein and Kanter (1980), and to some extent a pre-
cursor to large system interventions that emerged later in the 1980s, 
the parallel organization was an attempt to recognize and benefit from 
the informal organization. In Carlson’s accounting for how it worked 
at GM, periodically and typically on a Friday, all members of manage-
ment and key technical staff from a given plant, foundry, for example, 
or a division, for example, purchasing, would come together for the 
day. The primary purpose was to discuss the “undiscussables,” thus all 
formalities were suspended for the day—no one was a boss, anyone 
could speak his or her mind without fear of retribution, and individu-
als would work in small groups that represented a cross section of 
jobs and responsibilities not in a “family” group. If the formal system 
continued to have too much influence, using, say, the Nominal Group 
Technique (Delbecq, Van de Ven, & Gustafson, 1975) might help. 
Fundamental to the technique is that each individual’s suggestions 
and ideas carry the same weight as anyone else’s regardless of status 
and  formal power. In any case, the work for the day was to solve prob-
lems, some of which may have plagued the organization for years. The 
intent was that on Monday back in the formal system, people would 
begin to work differently—more efficiently, openly, and effectively 
than before.  

224 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Consultant as a Broker  
 Assuming that the change objective is to tighten a loosely coupled 
system, it may be that the consultant to such a process should not 
merely be a facilitator. In a consulting project reported by Kaplan 
(1982), the client was a group of loosely bound mental health services 
agencies who needed to work together to serve their community as 
effectively as possible. Kaplan found that the agencies were so loosely 
bound, he could not determine clearly who the client was, who he 
was contracting with, what should be facilitated, and so on. Getting 
focused took an eternity and what we might  call a “whole system” 
simply did not exist. Based on his experience, Kaplan concluded that 
he needed to form a group that could represent all of the agencies, to 
“create” the client. In his attempt to help the system come together, 
at least to some extent, he drew further conclusions that were unusual 
yet insightful and consistent with Weick’s (2001) suggestions for 
working with loosely coupled systems; that is:  
 
•  Feedback should fit looseness; that is, differentiated and lim-
ited to subunits, not the “whole system,” which in this case had 
limited existence.  
 
•  The consultant needs to have sophisticated political and inter-
personal skills and be able to work with relationships. This line of 
thinking on Kaplan’s part is consistent with the views expressed 
in  Chapter  5 , “Defining the Client: A Different Perspective,” 
in terms of answering the question “who is the client?” When 
thinking about an organization’s organization chart, the case 
was made that the client was not any of the individuals whose 
names and titles were inside the boxes on the chart but in real-
ity the lines that connect the boxes; that is, the relationships.  
 
•  “The consultant may need to  convene people more than  inter-
vene into the system” (Noumair, Winderman, & Burke, 2010, 
p. 488).    
 Not only consistent with Weick’s thinking (1976, 2001), Kaplan’s 
conclusion fits comfortably within a systems way of conceptualizing 
his work. To quote Capra (1996):  

 CHAPTER  10 • UNDERSTANDING AND CHANGING LOOSELY COUPLED SYSTEMS 
225
 All living systems are networks of smaller components and 
the web of life as a whole is a multilayered structure of living 
systems within other living systems—networks within net-
works (pp. 209–210).  
 The consultant or change leader, particularly when working with 
a loosely coupled system, will likely need at times to be a broker and 
connector, to assemble a group, to bring two individuals together to 
resolve a stalemate, bringing together two groups that had been work-
ing on the same problem but didn’t know it, and so on.  
 Tightening a Loose System  
 What helps to compensate for too much looseness? According to 
Orton and Weick (1990), there are three points of emphasis:  
 
•   Enhanced leadership.  Recall that a tightly coupled system is 
characterized especially by hierarchy and interdependence. In 
the case of a loosely coupled system, imposing hierarchy would 
probably not be wise. Thus, a form of shared leadership should 
work better with few if any system members occupying a per-
manent role of leadership, or if so, that leadership would need 
to be highly participative and perhaps in the form of servant 
leadership.   
 
•   Focused attention.  A loose system can be seen as being “all 
over the place,” thus more focus could help. This focus might 
be in the form of a project that has a beginning, middle, and 
end. Establishing, say, a permanent program at the larger sys-
tem level would be more problematic. Planning and conduct-
ing a conference for all members to share expertise might be 
an example. Such a project would clearly help to focus mem-
ber attention; then the question would become one of decid-
ing whether to have annual conferences, which in turn raises 
the question of what the mission and purpose of the  system 
are. Not adequately answering this purpose question became 
the downfall of attempting to change the A.K. Rice Institute, 
a loosely coupled system (Noumair et al., 2010). Choosing the 
focus for attention needs to be carefully considered.  

226 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 
•   Shared values.   It is difficult if not impossible to have an organi-
zation without at least some common beliefs and values. Even 
al-Qaida has shared values, beliefs that readers of this chapter 
are not likely to endorse, but beliefs and values nevertheless 
that hold them together as a system. Reminding ourselves of 
why we as a system exist in the first place, our  raison d’etre, can 
help tighten an organization, a network, that has become too 
loose.     
 Summary Suggestions  
 Using Weick’s (2001) five processes for changing a loosely cou-
pled system (see  Table  10.1 ), let us consider some examples and sug-
gestions for how we might work as change leaders and consultants 
more effectively:  
 
•   Continuous rather than episodic.  Trying to change a loosely 
coupled system with an episode (“burning platform”)—that is, 
a jolt to the total system—is like shooting a rifle at a distant 
target that is scattered rather than finite. Although a shotgun 
may be somewhat more effective, the analogy begins to break 
down because a blast is not likely to work very well in the first 
place. Our interventions therefore need to be focused as much 
or more on matters of unit efficiency than overall effectiveness. 
Helping to improve ways of working at small group levels and 
individual coaching are more likely to be the better  choices of 
interventions.   
 
•   Small rather than large.  Regarding the matter of scale, the fact 
that the totality is by definition loosely formed and consequently 
difficult to establish a common focus (often the parts, or at least 
some of them, are more important than the whole), attempt-
ing to launch a large-scale effort is problematic. Remember the 
Kaplan (1982) study? It is probably better to emphasize and 
consult with subsystems having the dual aim of (a) helping each 
unit work more efficiently and effectively, and (b) collaborating 
with other units (boundary spanning activities) to the degree 
that such cross-unit activities help each respective unit improve.  

 CHAPTER  10 • UNDERSTANDING AND CHANGING LOOSELY COUPLED SYSTEMS 
227
 
•   Improvisational rather than planned.  At a unit level, it may be 
useful to operate according to Lewin’s three steps of unfreeze, 
change, refreeze, the epitome of planned change, but at the 
total system level these steps may be overly restrictive for a loose 
organization. Attempting to unfreeze a total system that is not 
all that “frozen” in the first place may not be a good use of time 
and effort. Although a given unit may be stuck in its ways, other 
units within the system may not be. But as the alternative, what 
does Weick mean by improvisational? He means essentially 
how the term  is defined—unscripted, spontaneous, invented, 
extemporaneous, and so on. To help us understand how this 
form of consulting and change leadership might work, two ref-
erences may be helpful. First is Schein’s (1999) perspective, 
which provides a set of principles based on process consultation 
that can serve as a guide for change consultants. His list is fairly 
extensive, but four of his principles seem to be appropriate for 
operating improvisationally. Schein’s principle #2 is “Always 
deal with reality.” A reality of change leadership is that planned 
change rarely, if ever, unfolds as planned. To make any change 
work, we must operate in  the moment, or as quickly as possible, 
by dealing with consequences of an initiation of change that 
we simply did not anticipate, much less plan (Burke, 2014b). 
Remember Lewin’s dictum referred to in  Chapter  9 , “Planning 
and Managing Change”: “If you want to understand an orga-
nization, try to change it.” Organizational members’ reactions 
to an intervention are likely to be more important diagnosti-
cally than the intervention itself. Dealing with the reality of 
the moment is improvisational. Schein’s #3 principle is “Access 
your ignorance”—a scary proposition. Understanding what we 
do not know can be thought of as a positive. However, a sig-
nificant problem is when we do not know what it is that we do 
not know. By admitting ignorance, however, we can spur useful 
engagement with the client to work together to solve the prob-
lem rather than attempting unrealistically to be the expert in all 
matters of organization change. Principle #7 is “Be prepared 
for surprises and learn from them.” People do not behave all 
that predictably—even those with whom we are close and have 
known for years. A way of considering this important principle 

228 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
is when caught by surprise, attempt to control your potential 
embarrassment and view the situation  with curiosity, followed 
by generating a hypothesis or two as to why the event was 
novel. And, finally, Schein’s principle #8 is “Share the prob-
lem.” This principle overlaps with the others, of course, and 
Schein’s admonition in all of these principles is to find ways 
to stay engaged with the client so that the interactive process 
will lead to innovation and shared responsibility for the overall 
change process.  
 
  A second helpful paper regarding improvisation in consult-
ing endeavors is the one by Van de Ven and Sun (2011). They 
define four different change models, as follows:  
 
•  Teleology. A planned organization change approach 
 
•  Life cycle. Organizational patterns over time 
 
•  Dialectics.  Reasoning and debate about change initiatives 
and implementations  
 
•  Evolution. Competition for scarce resources 
 
 The argument put forth by these scholars is for an organization 
change consultant to be versed in all four models but not wed to 
any given one of them. Being flexible to move from one model 
to another when warranted is a form of improvisation.  
 
•   Accommodative rather than constrained.   What has been cov-
ered by Schein and the article by Van de Ven and Sun are not 
only relevant for improvisation but for this process of accom-
modation by Weick as well. In general, the change leader and/
or consultant needs to listen to client concerns as well as their 
suggestions for moving forward even though they may differ 
from what the change leader and/or consultant think would be 
best. This potential difference is particularly characteristic of 
professionals who compose a network or otherwise loosely cou-
pled system such as, say, the humanities faculty of a university 
who are not change experts as  a rule but have strong opinions 
nevertheless. So, it is not altogether unwise as a change leader 
to accommodate at times and follow what the client wants, even 
as one who is knowledgeable in matters of organization change 
and would not recommend what the client is proposing. Should 

 CHAPTER  10 • UNDERSTANDING AND CHANGING LOOSELY COUPLED SYSTEMS 
229
the client’s option not turn out very well, then the change leader 
can focus on learning, learning about what didn’t go so well and 
what might be a better approach. This accommodating process 
requires patience and tolerance but the goal then becomes one 
of learning and the change process for the future  can follow. 
 
•   Local rather than cosmopolitan.  Due to the fact that a loosely 
coupled system is difficult to “get one’s arms around,” having 
structural holes with subunits typically having more identifica-
tion if not influence than the whole, it makes sense to focus 
more locally than globally; that is, the entire organization. In 
other words, the change work would be more bottom-up than 
top-down. The consequences of emphasizing and strengthen-
ing subunits means that ultimately the center and total system 
can be compromised and possibly weakened. Change leaders 
and consultants must be cognizant of if not vigilant about this 
potential consequence and, at least at times, raise the question 
of whether this possible outcome is desirable.  
 These five processes for changing loosely coupled systems that 
Weick (2001) has generated and we have contrasted with standard 
OD practice ( Table  10.1 ) are useful to consider if not follow when 
working with and perhaps attempting to tighten too much looseness. 
These are not the only processes, of course. As noted earlier, our 
loose system may be an internal network or external, a stand-alone 
organization. As change leaders and consultants, we would work dif-
ferently if we were attempting to use the internal network, informal 
organization, as a leverage for change in the formal organization. Even 
though born from a tightly coupled system, using the parallel organi-
zation process, for example, could be beneficial. Following Weick’s 
processes would be more appropriate for stand-alone networks and 
similar systems such as a university, partnership, consortium, or vol-
unteer agency.  
 Adapting OD to Loosely Coupled Systems  
 Weick’s (2001) suggestions for working with loosely coupled sys-
tems have been helpful—as far as they go. We will now depart from 
Weick for the time being and return to “normal” OD, as depicted in 

230 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Chapters  1 ,  4 , and  9 . Let us consider how we might adapt our seven 
steps of consulting the OD way (entry, contracting, data gathering, 
and so on) to explore how we might work with loosely coupled systems 
more effectively. One adaptation to note here at the outset concerns 
the seven steps of OD practice. With the following seven, we have 
dropped  planning change  and added  data gathering. Of  course, these 
two steps are either overt or implicit in both sets of seven steps. With 
loosely coupled systems, planning the change is much less formal and 
structured than with tightly coupled systems, and with the former, 
loose systems, gathering data is a more complex process, often includ-
ing more constituents and shareholders, thus, data gathering becomes 
more salient and important.  
 Entry  
 With a tightly coupled system (TCS), our initial encounter is typi-
cally with an executive or a manager—that is, someone in charge. 
With a loosely coupled system (LCS), many people are in charge, 
thus our entry is with anyone in the system who is advocating change, 
regardless of where in the system and with whom. We therefore seek 
to establish a relationship if not partnership with that person or per-
sons to explore the possibility of change.  
 Contracting  
 Weisbord’s (1973) wisdom remains relevant; for example, speci-
fying who is going to do what and by when. Again, in a TCS, the 
contracting is usually done with a lead person at the top of the orga-
nization or at the head of a unit within the larger organization. In this 
case, we are being attentive to the hierarchy. In an LCS with little 
hierarchy and interdependence, it might be wise to impose a bit of 
interdependence by contracting with a group and not an individual. 
Thus, the two primary issues in contracting are accountability and role 
clarity of the group members.  Without a hierarchy, peer pressure may 
be the appropriate process to follow, to impose. Then, it becomes a 
question of contracting with a subunit of the larger system or with a 
constructed group of individuals who represent key segments of the 
overall system. In any case, we should think in terms of collectivism, 
not individualization.  

 CHAPTER  10 • UNDERSTANDING AND CHANGING LOOSELY COUPLED SYSTEMS 
231
 Data Gathering  
 As with TCS, useful data will be both quantitative—for example, 
a survey—and qualitative—for example, interviews—as well as archi-
val, such as performance indices and customer satisfaction. With an 
LCS, in addition to the above, you are likely to need data from stake-
holders and related constituents. If there is a board of directors, be 
sure to interview the members. And if the LCS is a service organiza-
tion, gather data from the consumers. The point is that with a TCS, 
interdependence is a basic characteristic and, therefore, everyone 
does not have to be a data provider—thus being selective and not 
attempting to touch  all data points is in order. With an LCS, all data 
points are in order. In other words, with an LCS, there is greater dif-
ferentiation with little integration and typically a proliferation of sub-
units and groups. With this greater degree of disparate units, there is 
a greater need to gather data from many more sources in an LCS than 
would likely be the case for a TCS.  
 Diagnosis  
 With greater differentiation of data and data sources in an LCS, 
diagnosis becomes more complicated. Instead of one story to tell, 
there are likely to be multiple stories. And we will need ways to sum-
marize and organize the data. As noted earlier, when working with an 
LCS, the model or framework of choice is a social network analysis. 
Bearing in mind our personal bias regarding the Burke-Litwin model, 
albeit founded on the basis of a TCS, this model may still be useful 
with an LCS. A network analysis shows working and social relation-
ships among people. When concentrating on the arrows, not so much 
the boxes in the Burke-Litwin model, we are also focusing on rela-
tionships but more in terms of organizational functions, for example, 
mission and strategy, and characteristics, such as culture. This focus 
comes from the perceptions of people in the system drawn from a 
survey and/or interviews, but more in terms of their views about such 
issues as strategic clarity, intent or strategy as it is aligned with struc-
ture, how culture affects the organization’s reward system, whether or 
not organizational members see how their jobs and roles contribute 
to the organization’s mission, and so forth—not so much the relation-
ships among individuals.  

232 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Feedback  
 In our work over the years with TCS, we have consistently pro-
vided the feedback to the boss first and alone. This has always been 
an important element of the contract with the client. It is, therefore, 
a two-step process—first with the boss, then with everyone else. With 
an LCS, we may not need the first step. In addition to honoring the 
contract, the purpose of providing feedback is to energize the mem-
bers of the organization to take action. The initial activity of a large 
group intervention can be to provide feedback followed by planning 
action steps accordingly. This kind of  process is relevant to both a 
TCS and an LCS. The feedback process with a TCS, however, is 
often staggered; that is, conforming to the hierarchy: feedback to the 
top team, then to the next layer downward, and so forth to the level 
of first-line supervisors. This takes time, of course, and needs to be 
orchestrated carefully. With an LCS, it is best, to the degree possible, 
to have everyone in the same room at the same time. Little interde-
pendence among organizational members coupled with not providing 
feedback to all simultaneously can cause communication problems, 
such as misinformation being transmitted,  rumor mills, and so forth. 
In a TCS, communication can be controlled more easily, albeit at 
times perhaps overcontrolled, whereas in an LCS, without everyone 
together, the word travels through many channels in turn, creating 
the possibility of distortion. Large group techniques are, therefore, 
very useful for an LCS at the feedback stage.  
 But what if the LCS is essentially virtual and gathering every-
one in the same room is not possible? As problematic as this situa-
tion might be, you still need to mirror the system as much as possible 
when providing feedback; that is, virtually. Using software such 
as Adobe Connect can be an alternative. Skype may help also but 
could be too limiting. Perhaps some combination of conference call, 
videoconferencing, and Adobe might be considered. In any case, 
using whatever technology that can help you to connect and engage 
the total virtual organization at the same time would be the goal.  
 Intervention  
 With respect to intervening into an LCS, the larger the system, 
the more we should follow Weick’s (2001) admonition of keeping the 

 CHAPTER  10 • UNDERSTANDING AND CHANGING LOOSELY COUPLED SYSTEMS 
233
action local rather than at the total system level, or  cosmopolitan to 
use his term. But what is local particularly with respect to size? A good 
rule of thumb is the “magic number of 150,” or to be precise regard-
ing Dunbar’s research, 147.8. Dunbar (1992) studied what he called 
 social channel capacity, or simply put, how many people can we know 
and keep up with? That is, we do not have to be close friends with this 
many people; it is more a matter of, for example, knowing who knows 
what—when I need some information about or help with a particular 
matter, who would I turn to? In other words, staying at no more than 
150 people appears to be the most efficient way to manage a large 
group. There is considerable evidence for the efficacy of this “magic 
number.” Thus for an LCS of no more than 150 individuals, you can 
have an efficiently run meeting with everyone at the same time. For 
an LCS of more than 150, our interventions would need to be held at 
subunit levels,  more local and important to that subunit—not neces-
sarily to the entire system. It might be better to work more with a local 
school than with an entire district. So, with an LCS, there are mul-
tiple choices of entry for an intervention and interventions at these 
local levels can be any one of many from the OD lexicon of change 
activities—coaching, team building, conflict resolution between sub-
units, forming alliances and joint ventures, and leader development. 
And for more specific examples of potential interventions for span-
ning boundaries across organizational partnerships, such as reflective 
intervening, process managing, and brokering, see the contribution 
by  Gray (2008).  
 Staying with the theme of interventions to tighten an LCS, let us 
revisit the three suggestions of Orton and Weick (1990) for tightening 
a loose system: (1) enhanced leadership, (2) focused attention, and (3) 
shared values.  
 Enhanced leadership  means that selected individuals will be 
authorized by members of the organization to decide about certain 
actions that can result in a tightening of the system. This involves 
power and its use, which has not been addressed directly in this chap-
ter. Let us now at least touch on it.  
 Richard Beckhard, one of the founders of OD and a mentor for 
many, was one of the most astute practitioners ever witnessed for 
quickly and accurately identifying where and who had the power in 

234 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
any given organization. He could practically smell it, not just see it. 
This ability was, of course, in the context of a tightly coupled system—
understanding hierarchy and interdependence. In a loosely coupled 
system, where power is and who has it is not that easy to identify. 
Power is dispersed, allusive, situational, and more individualized 
than a function of position or title. In a loosely coupled system, social 
power is the key identifier. People who have this form of power are 
those recognized by Gladwell (2000)—connectors, mavens, and sales-
men and by Cross et al. (2013) as connectors, brokers, energizers, 
and resisters—and those recognized by Battilana and Casciaro (2012) 
as network members who provide novel ideas that challenge the sta-
tus quo and those who are talented at getting ideas implemented. 
Enhancing leadership in a loosely coupled system is a matter of iden-
tifying and coaching those who have social power.  
 With respect to  focused attention, the intent is to work in small 
and perhaps accommodative ways, at the local level to identify poten-
tial projects that need to be undertaken to improve particularly a 
given subsystem’s efficiency and effectiveness. The project could be 
devoted to determining how to serve a certain constituency, ones 
who are served by the network or system, but have not been all that 
involved or for some reason have been neglected and not well served. 
For example, in the early days of the OD Network, local groups in 
major cities across the United States organized to plan and conduct 
the national meetings. The aim was not only to get the national meet-
ings organized and implemented, but also to facilitate the formation 
of local, regional chapters, which would hold their own events yet 
remain loosely connected to the ODN as a whole. And, finally, a con-
sultant might consider having network members attend a workshop 
on project management.  
 Shared values underlie an organization’s mission, thus a fruitful 
way to focus on these beliefs is to revisit the mission statement. This 
was done in the case of attempting to change the A. K. Rice Institute 
and led to significant change in the system, at least for the short run 
(Noumair et al., 2010). The mission is the glue that holds the orga-
nization together, particularly if the organization is loosely coupled. 
Revisiting the mission statement from time to time is rarely a waste 
of time.  

 CHAPTER  10 • UNDERSTANDING AND CHANGING LOOSELY COUPLED SYSTEMS 
235
 Sustainment  
 As you know, initiating a change effort is one thing and keeping 
it going is quite another. Over two decades, Jack Welch kept change 
going at GE by moving from one initiative to another. First, there 
was workout, then Six Sigma, and later developing a values-oriented 
culture. That was GE, a large and rather tightly run organization. For 
an LCS, sustainment of change is probably not one of following a GE 
model (i.e., the same for everyone). Rather, an effective sustainment 
process might follow a model of  dispersed differentiation (i.e.,  not the 
same for everyone).  
 But first, let’s address sustainment with thinking that is applicable 
to both a TCS and an LCS. The problem with leading and manag-
ing change is the fact that implementation rarely goes according to 
plan. Thus, fixing unanticipated problems that arise due to interven-
tions into the existing system must take top priority, problems such 
as new software meant to support the change effort doesn’t seem to 
work or at least work well. (The early days of Obamacare come to 
mind.) For sustainment problems that emerge from change, interven-
tions must be tackled immediately. Allowing these problems to fester 
causes a loss of momentum, in essence the death knell of any change 
effort, with people moaning, “I know this change thing wasn’t going to 
work!” Thus, fixing these unintended consequences of change initia-
tives must take precedence to sustain the change. See  Chapter  2 in 
Burke (2014b), in particular the section on “The Paradox of Planned 
Organization Change”; that is, planned change is linear, whereas 
implementation is nonlinear.  
 Now with respect to an LCS, intervening with new initiatives can 
be useful for sustainment but as noted above not for the GE approach. 
Once a change is launched in an LCS, interventions are likely to be 
dispersed among local units and different from one another. Local 
options regarding execution are probably the process to support. 
Here, the Battilana and Casciaro (2012) study is relevant. The overall 
change attempted, at least in part, was to increase decision-making 
authority for nurses, but that took different forms based on the char-
acteristics of the internal network—tight versus structural holes. Fix-
ing unanticipated problems is the same regardless of TCS or LCS. 
What differs is the content of the problems with much more differen-
tiation for an LCS.  

236 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 A final thought, perhaps heretical, for sustainment of change in 
an LCS: A fundamental principle of open system theory is that change 
in one part of the system has an impact on other parts of the system. 
How true is this principle for a network? Is it possible that change in 
a local unit would have no impact on other local units? Yes, we know, 
the answer is “It depends”; that is, how loose-tight the network is. But 
it may be that diligently communicating what happens in one locality 
to all other localities, to foster best practices, for example, may  simply 
not matter that much. It has been said that all politics are local. The 
more a system is loosely coupled, the more that statement is no doubt 
valid.  
 Some scholar-practitioners in the field of organization develop-
ment and change add an eighth step to this list of seven from entry to 
sustainment:  evaluation. This potential eighth step is important—did 
change actually occur?—but rarely conducted (see  Chapter  11 , “Does 
Organization Development Work?”). Many practitioners believe that 
evaluation takes too much time and effort and doesn’t tell you very 
much. But if incorporated into a change effort from the beginning so 
that a pre-post comparison can be made, then the time and cost can 
be worth it. For an LCS, it would need to be conducted locally, of 
course, and to do  so across the entire system may indeed be costly, so 
it is probably best to keep evaluation as a “local option.”  
 Conclusion  
 It is not as if we have never heard of a loosely coupled system, 
perhaps with different language and labels; they have been around 
since the beginning of human attempts “to get organized.” Moses 
along with help from his brother, Aaron, talked Pharaoh into letting 
his people go. Moses then more or less led the Israelites, a loose band 
of people agreeing that wandering in the desert for 40 years was bet-
ter than slavery, with the dream that reaching the promised land was 
worth all of the hardships. Moses’s band of several thousand was a 
loose system, a very flat hierarchy with one solitary and rather intro-
verted leader at the top. In fact, years later, Jethro, Moses’s son-in-
law, thought that Moses was well beyond his limit with respect to 
leadership and a tightening was needed. So he proposed a hierarchy 

 CHAPTER  10 • UNDERSTANDING AND CHANGING LOOSELY COUPLED SYSTEMS 
237
with Moses having 10 direct reports and with each of them having 10 
direct reports, and so forth down the human pyramid. It sounds like 
a simple solution to Moses’s overload. But it was no doubt difficult. 
As we have attempted to explain, neither loosening a tight system nor 
tightening a loose system is a cakewalk. Change has never been  easy.  
 What we have also attempted to explain is that we know and have 
more experience with loosening tight systems and therefore doing so 
may be less difficult than tightening a loose system. After all, from 
time to time, Moses would have a rebellion on his hands from his 
followers. As we now understand, the field of OD is largely based 
on our accumulative experiences and knowledge from working with 
tightly coupled systems. Therefore, we have much learning ahead of 
us regarding the intricacies of changing an LCS. Even so, maybe even 
now we could make progress with changing an LCS  in less than 40 
years.

 Does Organization Development Work? 
 “Does it work?” is one of the first questions managers ask about 
anything new or different. This chapter therefore responds to the 
question first by showing that there is substantial evidence that orga-
nization development (OD) does indeed work. Caveats will be con-
sidered as we respond further to the question. Next, we consider 
obstacles to conducting an evaluation, the seventh phase of any OD 
effort, and finally we conclude by arguing the importance of evalua-
tion regardless of the problems involved and the pressures that miti-
gate such an activity.  
 Does It Work?  
 When OD is done according to the principles and practices 
expounded in this volume, our experience is that OD works. But our 
experience and others’ experiences in “successfully” practicing OD is 
not enough. So-called hard evidence is needed. And, indeed, there 
is evidence. French and Bell (1978) selected nine studies that sup-
port OD’s effectiveness. Four of their nine, for example, were studies 
by Beckhard and Lake (1971), Kimberly and Nielsen (1975), King 
(1974), and Marrow, Bowers, and Seashore (1967).  
 Other studies could be included in the French and Bell list, such 
as the one by Golembiewski, Hilles, and Kagno (1974).  
 There are problems, however. From a survey of 63 organizations 
regarding their knowledge and use of organization development, 
Heisler (1975) found, among other things, that the major criticism 
of OD efforts was the difficulty in evaluating their effectiveness. A 
number of others have made similar observations; see, for example, 

240 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
Barends, Janssen, ten Have, & ten Have (2014); King, Sherwood, and 
Manning (1978); Morrison (1978); Porras (1979); and Porras and Pat-
terson (1979).  
 Researchers, in attempting to evaluate the effectiveness of OD, 
have relied on a method called meta-analysis. The value of meta-
analysis is that it is a statistical technique that summarizes and inte-
grates numerous findings across many studies. As Guzzo, Jette, and 
Katzell (1985) point out,  
 Through meta-analysis, a common yardstick for measuring 
results of different studies is obtained that furnishes a level 
of integration of studies not possible through traditional judg-
mental ways of reviewing a body of literature. In fact, propo-
nents of meta-analysis have criticized traditional literature re-
view methods for their susceptibility to bias and insensitivity 
to artificial sources of differences in results (p. 276).  
 In their meta-analysis of 11 types of OD activities, Guzzo et al. 
showed that these “psychologically based organizational interven-
tions,” as they referred to them, raised worker productivity. These 
interventions included job design, participative management, socio-
technical systems, and team building. This finding was based on their 
analysis of 98 studies.  
 In their meta-analysis of 126 research studies, Neuman, Edwards, 
and Raju (1989) found that OD interventions had a stronger and 
positive effect on worker attitudes and satisfaction on the job. Their 
analysis further showed that multiple OD interventions—for example, 
team building, plus job enrichment, survey feedback, and so on—had 
a much stronger effect than singular OD interventions.  
 Considering organization change research since the 1990s and 
now into the twenty-first century, the focus interestingly has been on 
the recipients of change as compared with the role and influence of 
a change leader or agent. In other words, a way of interpreting orga-
nization development and change research in the early part of this 
century is from the perspective of those who have experienced the 
impact if not the brunt of the change process; that is, attempting to 
understand the effects on those most affected. This perspective can 
be considered in two ways: (1) reactions, in general, to organization 
development  and change, and (2) resistance to change.  

 
CHAPTER  11 • DOES ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT WORK? 
241
 With respect to (1) reactions to change in general, Oreg, Vakola, 
and Armenakis (2011) combed through an extensive array of organiza-
tion development and change studies since 1948, in the neighborhood 
of 700 publications. Using a primary criterion of methodological rigor, 
they boiled the numbers down to 79, all being based on quantita-
tive data. Next, they crafted a framework for categorizing the studies 
resulting in what they referred to as antecedents of recipients’ reac-
tions to the organizations’ changes:  
 
•  Personal characteristics of the change recipients themselves; 
for example, coping style  
 
•  The change process; for example, the extent to which recipients 
were involved in decision making regarding the change  
 
•  The content of the change; for example, a change in organiza-
tional structure, a new information technology system, culture 
change, and so on  
 Their framework then linked these antecedents to explicit 
reactions—affective, cognitive, and behavioral—and in turn linked to 
the consequences of the change such as job satisfaction and organiza-
tional performance.  
 Even with the emphasis for choice of study to be reviewed being 
methodological rigor, most of these research reports were flawed 
one way or the other. For example, most studies were based on self-
reports from a single source, rarely was a Time 1 measure compared 
with a Time 2, and most studies were conducted in a single organiza-
tion or department within a larger organization with no opportunity 
for comparisons. Even so, Oreg and colleagues were able to draw 
three primary conclusions from their analyses of the 79 studies; that 
is, recipients had the most positive reactions to change efforts when  
there was:  
  
1.  A basis of trust especially with top-level executives 
  
2.  Involvement of recipients in the decision-making process 
  
3.  A positive disposition toward the change by leaders in the 
organization    

242 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Burke’s (2014d) conclusion to this work by Oreg et al. (2011) is 
as follows:  
 These consistent findings across studies determined by Oreg 
and his colleagues are not exactly startling. We have known 
about the importance of trust, commitment, and benefits 
of a positive approach to life and work for a long time. It is 
comforting nevertheless to have (a) established these “truths” 
with consistency across so many studies and (b) found empiri-
cal evidence that supports what is practiced (p. 467).  
 The second perspective regarding recipients’ reactions to organi-
zation development and change is the matter of resistance. This per-
spective is based more on theory and reflections about practice than 
on research per se.  
 Although resistance to change is not a universal reaction, some 
people embrace change, after all, saying such things as “Well, it’s 
about time....” Resistance to change is quite common, nevertheless. 
Yet in the annals of organization development and change, resistance 
has usually been considered a given and is something that must be 
overcome. In fact, the title of the classic study by Coch and French 
(1948) was “Overcoming resistance to change.”  Overcome has been a 
part of our lexicon and heritage for a long time. As most of us in the 
field now know, this mode of thinking has been challenged.  Dent and 
Goldberg (1999) declared that mind-set leads to a we-they process, 
culminating in a vicious cycle of overcoming met with resistance. This 
cyclical process eventually led to the downfall of Margaret Thatcher, 
Prime Minister of the U.K. She classified her constituents as either 
“for us” or “against us.” Those against were not considered as the loyal 
opposition but rather as disloyal opponents, which, of course, contrib-
uted to a strong resistance to change on their part.  
 But sometimes, perhaps often, what may be perceived as resis-
tance is really nothing more than ambivalence (Piderit, 2000). In such 
cases, the person “resisting” just needs more information and perhaps 
a clearer rationale for the proposed change. And, finally, Ford, Ford, 
and D’Amelio (2008) have joined the more current sentiment regard-
ing resistance to change and argued that it can be seen as a resource 
rather than a detriment to a change effort that must be overcome. 
By resource, they mean that resistance requires energy, which is far 

 
CHAPTER  11 • DOES ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT WORK? 
243
better than apathy, and that with resistance, organizational members 
care about something. Thus,  it is a matter of maybe seeing resistance 
as a container for counterproposals and potentially useful ideas and 
therefore tapping into such different ways of thinking and perspec-
tives might be helpful to the overall change process. The point is that 
seeing resistance as something to overcome is an oversimplification 
of reality and that reality encompasses more complexity than we had 
previously considered. For broader coverage of this more recent way 
of understanding and dealing with resistance, see the article by Burke 
(2011a).  
 In addition to a more nuanced way of considering resistance, 
there is evidence that organization development and change interven-
tions can and do work. There are problems, nevertheless, in attempt-
ing to evaluate organization development and change interventions. 
We now consider the nature of some of these problems and issues.  
 Research Issues in Evaluating OD Efforts  
 The overriding issue in OD evaluation is purpose—whether the 
research effort is evaluation or knowledge generation, whether it is 
for the benefit of the client or the social scientist. Because we are dis-
cussing evaluation, that should be the obvious concern, not scientific 
generation of knowledge, but the assessment methodology—how we 
collect and analyze our information for evaluative purposes—is based 
on the traditional scientific method. We control and manipulate some 
independent variables, make some interventions, and see if any dif-
ference occurs with respect to some dependent variables. We decide 
to use team building as an intervention, for example, and we collect  
information (a dependent variable) to see if it made any difference. 
We might use a questionnaire to ask team members if they feel more 
satisfied with and committed to the team, and we might determine if 
the team’s work performance increases after the team-building effort 
has occurred. Even if our data showed increased satisfaction, com-
mitment, and work performance, it would be difficult to demonstrate 
that the team-building intervention has  caused these outcomes unless 
we had also collected data from a matched control group, a similar 
team for which no team building had been done, and could compare 

244 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
data for the same  period for the two groups. Another critical factor 
in this evaluation would be the people who collect and analyze the 
data. Numerous studies have shown that the researcher can affect the 
outcome (Rosenthal, 1976). This brings up the question of objectiv-
ity. To be scientific, or objective, the researcher should be someone 
other than the team-building consultant or the organization members 
involved.  
 Argyris (1968) has argued, however, that the more scientific the 
evaluation is, the less it is likely to be relevant to and therefore used 
by the client. Schein (1992) in his study of organizational culture has 
made similar arguments.  
 To be more specific, we now examine some primary research 
issues and problems associated with the evaluation of an organization 
development effort. The issues and problems are addressed in the 
form of six questions, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  
 What Is Organizational Effectiveness?  
 In general, the goal of an OD effort is to improve the organiza-
tion, to make it more effective, whether the effort is with a large, 
total system or with a division—a subsystem of a larger organization. 
It is not a simple matter to define effectiveness (Goodman & Pen-
nings, 1980) or to get people to agree on a definition. Cameron (1980) 
points out that there are at least four different criteria for organi-
zational effectiveness and that these criteria differ significantly from 
one organization to another. The differences are particularly appar-
ent when comparing profit-making with nonprofit organizations. The 
four criteria or models  are as follows:  
 
•   The goal model.  Organizational effectiveness is defined in terms 
of the extent to which the organization accomplishes its goals.  
 
•   The system resource model.   Effectiveness is equated with the 
ability to acquire needed resources.  
 
•   The process model.  Effectiveness is defined in terms of how 
smoothly the organization functions, especially the degree of 
absence of internal strain in the organization.  

 
CHAPTER  11 • DOES ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT WORK? 
245
 
•   The strategic constituencies model.  Effectiveness is determined 
by the extent to which the organization satisfies all its strategic 
constituencies—special interest groups.  
 As Cameron notes, these models or definitions of effectiveness 
may be useful or inappropriate, depending on the type of organization 
and the public or market it tries to serve.  
 It should thus be apparent that determining organizational effec-
tiveness is not simple.  
 What Is OD?  
 As illustrated in this book, OD is many things, and there are seven 
major phases in an OD effort. For evaluative research purposes, do 
we consider all these phases or just the intervention phase? More-
over, different OD interventions will also result in different outcomes 
(Neuman, Edwards, & Raju, 1989; Porras, 1979). The more specific 
and precise we can be in defining the variety of activities coming 
under the rubric of OD, the more we will be in a position to evaluate 
the effectiveness of these activities. A way of increasing this precision 
is to achieve greater clarity about the remaining  four questions.  
 What Is the Independent Variable?  
 In an examination of 38 research studies conducted on various 
aspects of OD, Pate, Nielsen, and Bacon (1977) reported that they 
had considerable difficulty in categorizing variables from the stud-
ies. They could not be sure whether the independent variable was 
the OD intervention itself or whether OD was only instrumental in 
the manipulation of some other independent variable. They took the 
view that OD is instrumental but does not constitute the indepen-
dent variable as such. “For example, one might expect introduction of 
participative decision making (OD intervention) to facilitate worker 
awareness of the rationale for organizational actions (independent 
variable), which  in turn may increase support and commitment to 
those actions (dependent variables)” (pp. 450–51). Their emphasis of 
this issue is helpful because we can now be clearer about what activi-
ties to evaluate specifically.  

246 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 How Can We Control Variables?  
 As organizations are dynamic systems, this is a question of causal 
attribution—determining whether the consequences of a change 
can be attributed to organization development. As noted earlier, the 
more we can control our research conditions (for example, by having 
a control condition or control group for comparison), the more we will 
be able to state with confidence what is cause and what is effect. In 
dynamic, changing organizations, however, this is almost impossible 
to do. It is difficult, for example, to persuade a manager to subject 
his or her organization to a series of time-consuming data-collection 
activities for the purpose  of providing a control group. The manager 
is likely to ask, “What’s in it for us?” It is even more difficult to find an 
appropriate control group. There are rarely two subsystems within an 
organization, much less two distinct organizations, that do the same 
things, have the same types of people, and are managed the same way. 
 With so much going on in the organizational world and with most 
of this array of activities being impossible to control, we have what 
Campbell and Stanley (1966) refer to as a problem of internal validity: 
determining whether what we did by way of change made a measur-
able difference. In the absence of pure control group conditions, the 
true experimental design for research purposes, Campbell and Stan-
ley have provided what they call quasi-experimental designs. These 
designs, though not perfect from a research perspective, provide ways 
for controlling certain conditions so that validity will be enhanced. 
Their time-series design is a good example. In this design, several 
measures are taken at certain intervals  before the intervention and 
several measures are taken at essentially the same intervals  after the 
intervention.  
 If it can be shown (1) that there are no significant differences 
among the first, say, four observations, (2) that there are significant 
changes from the first four to the fifth observation and beyond (that 
is, after the intervention), and (3) that there are then no significant 
differences among, say, four observations after the intervention, then 
the differences that occurred between preintervention and postinter-
vention must be a result of the change, not merely the passage of time 
or other variables.  

 
CHAPTER  11 • DOES ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT WORK? 
247
 What Changed?  
 Golembiewski, Billingsley, and Yeager (1976) drew distinctions 
among three types of change, which they labeled alpha, beta, and 
gamma.  Alpha change concerns a difference that occurs along some 
relatively stable dimension of reality. This change is typically a com-
parative measure before and after an intervention. If comparative 
measures of trust among team members showed an increase after 
a team-building intervention, for example, then we might conclude 
that our OD intervention had made a difference. Golembiewski et 
al. assert that most OD evaluation research designs consist of such 
before-and-after self-reports.  
 Suppose, however, that a decrease in trust occurred—or no 
change at all. One study has shown that, although no decrease in trust 
occurred, neither did a measurable increase occur as a consequence 
of team-building intervention (Friedlander, 1970). Change may have 
occurred, however. The difference may be what Golembiewski, Bill-
ingsley, and Yeager call a  beta change, a recalibration of the intervals 
along some constant dimension of reality. As a result of team-building 
intervention, team members may view trust very differently. Their 
basis for judging the nature of trust changed, rather than their per-
ception of a simple increase or decrease in trust along some stable 
continuum.  
 A  gamma change “involves a redefinition or reconceptualization 
of some domain, a major change in the perspective or frame of refer-
ence within which phenomena are perceived and classified, in what is 
taken to be relevant in some slice of reality” (Golembiewski, Billings-
ley, and Yeager, 1976, p. 135). This involves change from one state to 
another. Staying with the example, after the intervention, team mem-
bers might conclude that trust was not a relevant variable in their 
team-building experience. They might believe that the gain in their 
clarity about roles and responsibilities was the relevant factor and that 
their improvement as a team had nothing to do with trust. In other 
words, the domain of interest and importance was insufficient clarity 
regarding team members’ roles and responsibilities, not an issue of 
interpersonal relationships.  
 Thus, selecting the appropriate dependent variables—deter-
mining specifically what might change—is not as simple as it might 
appear. This is especially important when self-report data are used.

ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Who Will Conduct the Research and Who Will Use the 
Results?  
 The last issue to be addressed is the people involved in the eval-
uation effort. To avoid the possibility of a Pygmalion effect and to 
increase the probability of objectivity, it is best that the researcher be 
someone other than the OD consultant. Both the researcher and the 
consultant are interveners into the organization, however, and there-
fore it is imperative that they collaborate. The researcher needs to 
know not only the consultant’s overall strategy—change goals, targets, 
and so forth—and what interventions might be used, but also the con-
sultant’s predictions concerning what should change as a result of the 
OD effort.  
 The people who will make decisions as a result of the evaluation 
research must be involved. These people may or may not be directly 
involved in the OD process itself, but the decision makers need to be 
involved by the researcher in much the same way that the organiza-
tion members who are directly involved in the OD process would be 
regarding participation in the research goals, methods, and interpre-
tation. This involvement of the decision makers helps ensure that the 
research results will be valid and will be utilized for further decision 
making.  
 In addition to these issues and inherent problems in evaluating 
OD efforts, there are a number of pressures against conducting this 
seventh phase of an OD effort. We now examine some of these more 
important obstacles.  
 Pressures Opposed to Evaluation  
 The evaluation process of OD practice can be compared with an 
annual physical examination: Everyone agrees that it should be done, 
but no one, except a highly motivated researcher, wants to go to the 
trouble and expense of making it happen. We examine first some of 
the reasons for opposing evaluation and then conclude with reasons 
for going ahead with this phase.  
 There are at least four sets of people involved in or related to OD 
evaluation: the manager or decision maker, the organization members 
who are directly involved in the OD process (the manager or decision 

 
CHAPTER  11 • DOES ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT WORK? 
249
maker may or may not be in this process), the OD consultant, and the 
evaluation researcher. There are pressures on each of these catego-
ries of people to ignore evaluation.  
 The Manager or Decision Maker  
 Managers want results. If interventions in an OD effort are 
accompanied by change in certain organizational areas that are impor-
tant to managers, such as increased profits, decreased absenteeism, or 
increased morale; that is often all that is necessary for a manager to 
choose to continue with OD or to move on to other things. Managers 
want to know  if it works, not  why it works. Such managers are usu-
ally found in fast-moving, marketing-oriented organizations, where 
short-term results are rewarded. There are other types of managers, 
however.  
 Managers in highly technical, scientific organizations may take 
the opposite stance. These managers might argue that, unless you can 
measure the consequences of an organization development effort in a 
rigorous, scientific manner, an evaluation is not worth doing.  
 Opposition to evaluation research from managers who are in key 
decision-making roles may take either extreme: Evaluation research 
is not necessary because the outcomes are self-evident or because the 
effects of OD cannot be measured scientifically. Other reasons for 
opposition from managers could be the cost involved, the amount of 
extra time it will take, or the undesirability of an outsider coming in to 
do research on them.  
 The Organization Members Involved in the OD Effort  
 Opposition from those directly involved in the OD process may 
take the same forms as those mentioned with respect to the man-
agers or decision makers. In addition to those possible if not highly 
potential forms of opposition, organization members may complain 
about the time it will take for them to answer the questionnaires, for 
example, when this time could be utilized more productively in get-
ting on with further aspects of the OD effort. They also might argue 
that the research staff is likely to be more beneficial to the goals of the 
researcher than to the goals of the organization’s  change effort.  

250 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 The OD Consultant  
 The OD consultant is likely to want an evaluation study but for 
reasons that differ from those of the manager or decision maker. Man-
agers are interested in OD’s impact on outcomes—profits, turnover, 
costs, productivity—whereas OD consultants may be more interested 
in process—the impact that OD may have on behavior, attitudes, 
organizational procedures, changes in authority relationships, and 
the like. A study by Porras and Wilkens (1980) indicates that many 
OD consultants may be disappointed with evaluation research on 
organization development. Porras and Wilkens found that OD in a 
large organization had a positive impact on outcomes, such as unit 
performance,  but a negative consequence for attitudinal and behav-
ioral variables that described organizational and individual processes. 
As Porras and Wilkens noted, these latter, unexpected negative find-
ings may reflect a beta change, not an alpha change (Golembiewski, 
Billingsley, & Yeager, 1976) because their measures of attitudes and 
behavior were through self-report questionnaires whereas their mea-
sures of unit performance came from company records.  
 The point here is not that OD consultants are uninterested in or 
opposed to determining OD’s impact on outcomes, but that certain 
factors may be more important to the consultant as a professional.  
 The Evaluation Researcher  
 The researcher is interested in both outcome and process mea-
sures, but his or her objectives for the use of the research results may 
differ from those of the other three groups of people concerned with 
an OD effort. The researcher is often more interested in contributing 
to the body of knowledge concerning organizations as changing sys-
tems or the effectiveness of organization development as a field than 
in providing information for the organization’s decision makers. This 
difference in objectives or priorities can cause problems with plan-
ning and implementing an evaluation research effort, but opposition 
on the part of a researcher toward conducting an evaluation study 
is likely to occur for another reason. Most researchers are trained 
only according to the traditional scientific method of research, which 
involves distancing oneself from and controlling the subjects of the 
research (client), not collaborating with them.  

 
CHAPTER  11 • DOES ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT WORK? 
251
 Reasons for Conducting the Evaluation Phase  
 The forces that oppose evaluative research of an organization 
development effort are formidable and should not be dismissed 
lightly, but there are also compelling reasons for conducting evalua-
tive research.  
 Briefly, the primary arguments for an evaluative research study of 
an OD effort are as follows:  
  
1.  An evaluation forces the definition of the change objectives. 
  
2.  An evaluation forces the clarification of the change outcomes 
that are expected.  
  
3.  An evaluation forces the clarification of how these change out-
comes are to be measured.  
  
4.  An evaluation forces specificity with respect to how certain pro-
cedures, events, and activities will be implemented.  
  
5.  An evaluation helps to signal many of the problems and ob-
stacles to be anticipated in the OD effort.  
  
6.  An evaluation facilitates planning for next steps and stages of 
organizational improvement and development.  
 As we know from system theory, particularly as applied to orga-
nizations, there may be no such thing as a single cause for a single 
effect. Systematic evaluation will provide many of the causal answers 
for what occurs and has occurred in organizations. Generally, but per-
haps most important, evaluation forces clarity about what  effective-
ness is for an organization. 
 Finally, it is important to conduct some kind of evaluation rather 
than none at all. And rather than become embroiled in the issues of 
whether an outside researcher or the OD practitioner should conduct 
the evaluation—and in the spirit of OD practice anyway—perhaps 
the OD practitioner can  facilitate an evaluative process; that is, help 
the client do the job himself.  
 One tool for facilitating an evaluative process is an After Action 
Review (AAR), borrowed from the U.S. Army. An AAR is an oppor-
tunity to review an OD initiative using four questions to guide the 
process: What was the intent? What actually happened? Why did it 

252 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
happen that way? What was learned? (Garvin, Edmondson, & Gino, 
2008). And just as important as an AAR is the Before Action Review 
(BAR) (Darling, Parry, & Moore, 2005). By conducting a BAR at the 
outset of an OD effort and asking similar questions to those in an 
AAR but with an emphasis on the  future, the evaluation process is 
baked into the research from the beginning. As such, AARs and BARs 
become part of how organizations learn from their experience, an 
essential outcome of any successful OD initiative. Questions associ-
ated with a BAR are: What do we intend to accomplish and how will 
we know if we have been successful? What do we anticipate will get 
in the way? What learning have we garnered from similar projects? 
What will we do to build on our past learning? By engaging these 
questions up front, at the very least, OD practitioners and clients will 
not be  moving forward with a new initiative without leveraging learn-
ing from the past or defining what success looks like in the future.  
 Conclusion  
 There is sufficiently strong empirical evidence that OD works. 
The more recent meta-analysis method of research has contributed 
significantly to our understanding of whether OD works. Yet, as has 
been pointed out, there are problems and issues in conducting evalu-
ations of OD efforts. It is important, nevertheless, to conduct some 
kind of evaluation rather than none at all. The paper by Goodstein and 
Burke (1991) regarding British Airways is an example of an evaluation 
that is nonscientific and post hoc but data-based in part. The data 
are primarily financial, as is the quantitative information reported by 
Leahey and Kotter (1990)  in their case study of British Airways. In 
these analyses of BA, an assumption is made that OD had an effect in 
that financial performance significantly improved—but it is assumed, 
not proven. We can learn from such reports in any case. Moreover, as 
Argyris, Putnam, and Smith (1985) have indicated, effective OD may 
actually be inconsistent with rigorous research.  
 In addition to the contribution of meta-analysis, it may also be 
that more effective work in the practice of OD has made a positive 
difference; that is, that OD works. Sashkin and Burke (1987) summa-
rize this point as follows:  

 
CHAPTER  11 • DOES ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT WORK? 
253
 We suggest that the clear research demonstration of positive 
OD impacts owes much to the integration of task structure 
and behavioral process-based OD approaches and of people-
centered with profit-centered OD values. The work on types 
of change shows an increasingly sophisticated appreciation 
of the true interdependence of structure and process in OD 
(p. 405).

 The Organization Development 
Consultant  
 A consultant is one who provides help, counsel, advice, and sup-
port, which implies that such a person is wise and would offer sage 
advice. Although the label  consultant usually conveys an image of one 
who provides help, there are obviously many different types of con-
sultants. The purposes of this chapter are to provide a context for the 
unique role and function of an organization development (OD) con-
sultant, to consider the different roles and functions of an OD consul-
tant including the integration of OD competencies into other 
organization roles, to explore the kinds of personal characteristics that 
are needed for OD consultation,  to suggest ways for those who want 
to become OD consultants to do so, to discuss the use of self-as-
instrument, and to address the importance of reflective practice as a 
method of continued professional development.  
 Context for Roles and Functions  
 To answer the question of context, two aspects are important. 
One is where we typically find OD consultants, and the other is how 
they differ from other consultants.  
 Where OD Consultants Are Located  
 Organization development consultants are found either inside an 
organization, as full-time or part-time employees, or outside organi-
zations, with organizations considered as clients. Internal consultants 
are usually located within the human resources, people development, 

256 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
or employee relations function. They may be part of an OD depart-
ment and serve exclusively in an OD capacity, or they may combine 
OD consultation with other duties, such as learning and development, 
coaching, research, or career assessment and development. Thus, 
internal OD consultants are usually in a staff function, and line man-
agers throughout the organization are their clients.  
 External OD consultants may be employed by a consulting firm, 
may be self-employed, or may have academic appointments and con-
sult only part of the time. In the past, external OD consultants usu-
ally came from colleges and universities. Now they are more likely to 
come from large consulting firms, as discussed in  Chapter  2 , “Orga-
nization Development Then and Now,” or work on their own as full-
time independent consultants.  
 A change in the field since the last revision of this book is that there 
is now a much greater incidence of line managers across functions 
integrating OD competencies into their work. We view the expansion 
of OD skills into a wide array of organization functions as a conse-
quence of change being a constant in contemporary organizational 
life. Rather than solely partnering with OD consultants, line manag-
ers are enhancing their own leadership skills by becoming proficient 
in organization change and development in order to lead change and 
manage more effectively. Thus, while we elaborate on the role of OD 
consultants,  the material covered in this chapter is also relevant for 
line managers. Additionally, we address line managers directly in the 
section on developing OD competencies.  
 Comparisons of the OD Consultant with Other Types of 
Consultants  
 Edgar Schein (1987; 1988; 1999) contrasts the process consul-
tant role, a primary but not exclusive role and function of an OD 
consultant, with the purchase model and the doctor-patient model. 
According to Schein, the purchase model is the most prevalent form 
of consultation, essentially consisting of the client’s purchase of 
expert services, such as information about the marketplace and com-
petitors, latest technology, surveys and polls, and so forth. A client’s 

 
CHAPTER  12 • THE ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT CONSULTANT 
257
employment of a consultant to conduct a market research study is 
an example of purchasing both expert service and information. The 
doctor-patient model consists of the client telling the consultant  the 
symptoms of what is wrong with the organization (“Our turnover is 
too high,” “We’re losing market share with respect to product X,” 
“Our management information system is a mess”) and then expecting 
the consultant to prescribe a remedy for the problem.  
 Schein contrasts these two models with the process consultant, 
one who helps the client organization diagnose its own strengths and 
weaknesses more effectively, learn how to see organizational prob-
lems more clearly, and with the consultant generate a remedy. Schein 
states:  
 It is a key assumption of change that the client must share 
in the process of diagnosing what may be wrong (or learn to 
see the problem for himself), and must be actively involved 
in the process of generating a remedy because only the client 
ultimately knows what is possible and what will work in his 
culture and situation (1987, p. 30).  
 Thus, the primary though not exclusive function of OD consul-
tants is to help clients learn how to help themselves more effectively. 
Although consultants occasionally provide expert information and 
may sometimes prescribe a remedy, their more typical mode of oper-
ating is  facilitation. 
 Although a typical mode, facilitation is not the only function or 
role of OD consultants. The next section summarizes the array of con-
sultant roles from which OD consultants may choose; more likely, they 
may use a combination of these roles within one client engagement.  
 Roles and Functions  
 As an introduction to the roles and functions of the OD practitio-
ner, let us start with Beckhard’s broad categories, as noted in With-
erspoon and White (1996). Beckhard viewed the OD practitioner as 
playing at least four roles:  

258 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 
•   Expert.  Solving a problem or providing solutions and recom-
mendations; this is similar to the purchase and doctor-patient 
models defined by Schein (1988).  
 
•   Consultant.  Helping the client to address an issue while keep-
ing the responsibility for the concern with the client; this is the 
same as the process consultant role as defined by Schein (1988). 
 
•   Trainer or educator.   Providing information through teaching 
the client; for example, giving a brief lecture on content or 
identifying a teachable moment.  
 
•   Counselor.   Advising the client and facilitating learning in the 
client. Today Beckhard would probably rename the Counselor a 
Coach, given the prevalence and popularity of coaching in OD. 
Coaching as an aspect of the OD consultant role is addressed in 
 Chapter  13 , “Coaching and Organization Development.” 
 Beckhard’s four categories are useful as they expand on Schein’s 
process consultation model, which is the  sine qua non  of OD practice. 
One challenge of process consultation, however, is that it is often  per-
ceived as not bringing expertise to bear on the problem and there is 
concern that clients will not see the added value of a consultant who 
uses process consultation. Although eventually the expertise required 
for process consultation is apparent, it is often not an easy sell to those 
in the early stages of learning it. Thus, Beckhard’s more expansive def-
inition of the consultant role allows one to serve as  an expert, teacher, 
and advisor, and provides a model for how to engage a client in other 
ways besides solely through process consultation. Depending on cli-
ent needs, a consultant would use a combination of these roles within 
one client engagement, and sometimes within one client meeting.  
 Lippitt and Lippitt (1975) provide us with a more nuanced view of 
the role of consultant. Using a continuum from directive to nondirec-
tive, Lippitt and Lippitt devised a descriptive model of eight differ-
ent roles for a consultant. By  directive, Lippitt and Lippitt mean that 
the consultant’s behavior assumes a leadership posture and that he or 
she initiates activities, whereas at the opposite extreme—nondirec-
tive—the consultant merely provides data for the client to use or not. 
All along the continuum, the consultant is active; what varies is how 
directive or nondirective this activity becomes. The eight roles from 
directive to nondirective are  advocate,  technical specialist, trainer or 

 
CHAPTER  12 • THE ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT CONSULTANT 
259
 educator, collaborator  (in problem solving),  alternative identifier, fact 
finder, process specialist,  and  reflector . Lippitt and Lippitt also note 
that these roles are not mutually exclusive. The consultant may, for 
example, serve as a trainer and educator and as an advocate at the 
same time.  
 Marginality  
 As noted earlier in  Chapter  5 , “Defining the Client: A Differ-
ent Perspective,” Margulies (1978) has described the consultant’s role 
differently and more generically. He argues that the OD consultant 
role is a marginal one.  Marginal implies being on the periphery, and, 
accordingly, another term that Margulies uses is  boundary. 
 First, Margulies contrasts two models of consulting with which 
we are already familiar: the  technical consulting  model and the  pro-
cess consulting model. His technical consulting model is like Schein’s 
purchase and doctor-patient models and like Lippitt and Lip-
pitt’s technical specialist role, and his process model is the same as 
Schein’s process consultation model. Margulies makes an analogy of 
technical-process with rational-intuitive and with the idea of the 
two-sided person represented by the two hemispheres of the brain. 
The OD consultant’s role, he argues, is to function between these 
two halves, in the margin, being neither too technically oriented nor 
too process-oriented. Both  sets of consultant expertise are appropri-
ate, but for the OD consultant neither should be emphasized to the 
exclusion of the other. The consultant operates within the bound-
ary of these two models of consultation, totally endorsing neither yet 
accepting both.  
 Margulies includes two other boundaries: the activities bound-
ary and the membership boundary. For both, the OD consultant 
should operate at the boundary, in a marginal capacity. With respect 
to change activities, particularly implementation, the consultant must 
help but not be directly involved. Suppose, for example, an off-site 
team-building session for a manager and his subordinates was forth-
coming. The consultant would help the manager with the design and 
process of the meeting but would not lead the meeting.  
 With respect to membership, the OD consultant is never quite 
in nor quite out. Although the consultant must be involved, he or 

260 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
she cannot be a member of the client organization. Being a mem-
ber means that there is vested interest, a relative lack of objectivity. 
Being totally removed, however, means that the consultant cannot 
sense, cannot be empathetic, and cannot use his or her own feelings 
as data for understanding the client organization more thoroughly. 
Being marginal with respect to membership means that the consul-
tant becomes involved enough to understand client members’ feelings 
and perceptions yet distant enough to be  able to see these feelings 
and perceptions for what they are—someone else’s—rather than as 
an extension of oneself. An example of being marginal with respect 
to membership is when a client once described me (Noumair) in my 
role as consultant as “Switzerland,” moving between and among sub-
systems in the organization in order to understand each unit’s position 
but interacting with each one as a neutral party. Marginality, in this 
case, allowed me to be empathetic with each unit while also remain-
ing apolitical with respect to any unit’s agenda.  
 Being marginal is critical for both an external consultant and an 
internal consultant. The major concern regarding the internal OD 
consultant’s role is that he or she can never be a consultant to his or 
her own group. If the group is an OD department, a member of this 
department, no matter how skilled, cannot be an effective consultant 
to it. It is also difficult for an internal OD practitioner to be a consul-
tant to any group that is within the same vertical path or chain of the 
managerial hierarchy as he or she may be. Because the OD function  
is often a part of the corporate human resource function, it would 
be difficult for the internal OD consultant to play a marginal role 
in consulting with any of the groups within this corporate function 
because the consultant would be a primary organization member of 
that function. Consulting with marketing, research and development, 
technology, or manufacturing within one’s organization, for example, 
would be far more feasible and appropriate because the OD consul-
tant could more easily maintain a marginal role.  
 It is understandable that an OD consultant’s role can be a lonely 
one. The role can also create anxiety about one’s accuracy of percep-
tion (no one to check it with but the client) and about one’s choice of 
intervention (whether it is the right thing for the moment). Joining in 
fully, being a member, helps alleviate this loneliness and anxiety. Stay-
ing removed, distant, and aloof can also relieve the anxiety because 

 
CHAPTER  12 • THE ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT CONSULTANT 
261
feelings are not involved. Doing either, however, lessens one’s effec-
tiveness as a consultant significantly. An obvious way to alleviate the 
problems of loneliness and anxiety is to co-consult. Working as an 
external and internal consultant team is probably the best way.  
 Shadow Consultation  
 If a co-consultant arrangement is not possible, an alternative is for 
a consultant to invite a colleague to partner as a  shadow consultant 
for a client engagement. A shadow consultant as defined by Schröder 
(1974) is a “consultant who, at the request of a colleague (or a team 
of colleagues) and by means of a series of discussions, helps assess, 
and if necessary, change that colleague’s diagnosis, tactics, or role 
in a specific assignment” (p. 580). Alban (1974), in her commentary 
on Schröder’s article on shadow consultation, corroborates that con-
sulting is a lonely experience, and that support from a colleague as a 
shadow consultant can mitigate loneliness and improve one’s work.  
 The purpose of partnering with a shadow consultant is to help a 
consultant improve her or his work on a particular project, however, 
without administrative responsibility or authority for the work of the 
consultant. The absence of responsibility or authority is the greatest 
single difference between a shadow consultant and a supervisor.  
 In order for shadow consultation to work well, certain conditions 
must be in place. First, to consider working together in this way, 
there must be reciprocal trust between consultant and shadow con-
sultant. Next, the consultant and shadow consultant must establish 
clear boundaries around each person’s authority and role and above 
all, both must have clarity regarding the task of their joint work. 
Finally, they must each take responsibility for maintaining a learning 
orientation.  
 As important as establishing a set of working agreements, the con-
sultant and shadow consultant need to be aware of the risks that are 
inherent in such partnerships. For the consultant, the risks include 
avoiding asking for help for fear of appearing vulnerable, in effect, 
not holding a learning orientation. This could manifest in withholding 
information. The consultant could also become too passive or too eas-
ily influenced by the shadow consultant and give up too quickly her or 

262 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
his own point of view; or the opposite, the consultant could become 
too wrapped up in his or her own ideas and not  fully consider the 
ideas of the shadow consultant.  
 For the shadow consultant, the risks are complementary to those 
of the consultant. The shadow consultant could also not maintain a 
learning orientation and become impatient with, or not offer con-
structive feedback to, the consultant. As a counterpart to the consul-
tant who relinquishes his or her point of view, the shadow consultant 
could mismanage the power associated with the role and get carried 
away with his or her own ideas and not fully take in the ideas of the 
consultant.  
 Having defined shadow consultation and identified the neces-
sary conditions for effective partnerships as well as the risks involved, 
we end the discussion of shadow consultation with Kilburg’s (2002) 
commentary on the importance of shadow consultation as his point of 
view is in keeping with our perspective on learning and collaboration 
as essential to the organizational consultation enterprise.  
 It is not easy for any of us to admit that we may not know ev-
erything or that we get into trouble in our consultations. Be-
ing willing to do so, I believe, is one of the hallmarks of true 
professionalism. For it is only when we become aware of what 
we do not know that I think we can stretch ourselves into full 
maturity. It is mostly our defensiveness and more primitive 
psychological conflicts that keep us from reaching out for as-
sistance in our continuing efforts to grow.  
 When done well, shadow consultation creates a safe, interper-
sonal containment in which a consultant and a colleague can 
reflect carefully on any and all dimensions that may be creat-
ing impacts on a project. It can lead to dramatic improvements 
in the ability to be self-aware and therefore self-managing 
and self-confident in consulting assignments. It also creates a 
safety net through which a mature practitioner is unlikely to 
fall when inevitable problems occur in our very difficult work. 
For new or less experienced practitioners, it is a wonderful 
way to stretch the learning curve and to do so quickly with live 
material that has immediate impact on performance (p. 92).  

 
CHAPTER  12 • THE ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT CONSULTANT 
263
 Consultant Abilities  
 We believe that 12 primary abilities are key to an OD consultant’s 
effectiveness. Most of these abilities can be learned, but because of 
individual differences in personality or basic temperament, some of 
them would be easier for some people to learn than for others. The 
effective consultant should have the following abilities:  
 
•   The ability to tolerate ambiguity.   Every organization is differ-
ent, and what worked before may not work now. Regardless of 
the genesis of an OD effort, it is best to enter a client engage-
ment, either as an internal or external consultant, with few pre-
conceived notions other than with the general characteristics 
that we know about social systems. One must then be able to 
tolerate ambiguity while also moving the work forward; that is, 
acting without complete certainty.  
 
•   The ability to influence.  Having some talent for persuasion and 
enjoying power enable the OD practitioner to be successful; 
without it, he or she is likely to succeed in only minor ways in 
OD. Working with client systems on organization development 
and change is not for the faint of heart; intellectual and emo-
tional engagement is a prerequisite for survival.  
 
•   The ability to “read” a group or “read” the room.  Reading a 
group or room involves observing nonverbal behavior that does 
not conform to what people are saying; there is some disconnect 
between the audio and the video. OD consultants are always 
collecting data and inconsistent data are critical to developing a 
robust understanding of a client system.  
 
•   The ability to confront difficult issues.  Much of OD work con-
sists of exposing issues that organization members are reluctant 
to face. Sometimes, the most important function of an OD con-
sultant is to serve as a “container” for undiscussable issues and 
to “hold” organization members in a safe place as they engage 
in difficult conversations.  
 
•   The ability to support and nurture others.  This ability is partic-
ularly important in times of conflict and stress, as noted above. 
It is also critical just before and during a manager’s first experi-
ence with team building.  

264 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 
•   The ability to listen well and empathize.  This is always impor-
tant, an essential competency, and especially during interviews, 
in conflict situations, and when client stress is high.  
 
•   The ability to recognize one’s own feelings and intuitions 
quickly.  It is important to be able to distinguish one’s own per-
ceptions from those of the client and also be able to use these 
feelings and intuitions as interventions when appropriate and 
timely. We will consider this point in more detail in the section 
dedicated to developing expertise in self-as-instrument.  
 
•   The ability to self-manage.  Working effectively as a consultant 
often means setting up your client to “look good” and get the 
credit; therefore, management of one’s own ego is essential. 
Management of one’s impatience is also required as change 
usually takes longer than planned and observable metrics of 
success are difficult to come by.  
 
•   The ability to conceptualize.  It is necessary to think and express 
in understandable terms certain relationships, such as the 
cause-and-effect and if-then linkages that exist within the sys-
temic context of the client organization. Models and frame-
works can be supportive of this ability.  
 
•   The ability to discover and mobilize human energy, both within 
oneself and within the client organization.  There is energy in 
resistance, for example, and the consultant’s interventions are 
likely to be most effective when they tap existing energy within 
the organization and provide direction for the productive use of 
the energy.  
 
•   The ability to teach or find that teachable moment and the 
capacity to create learning opportunities.   This ability should 
not be reserved for classroom activities, but should be utilized 
as part of the consultant role, within the mainstream of the 
overall change effort. Associated with this is the ability to learn 
in public. Consultants serve as role models for clients and if 
a consultant cannot allow him or herself to be vulnerable and 
learn in the moment, how can clients be expected to do so?  
 
•   The ability to maintain a sense of humor, both on the client’s 
behalf and to help sustain perspective.   Humor can be useful for 
reducing tension. It is also useful for the consultant to be able 

 
CHAPTER  12 • THE ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT CONSULTANT 
265
to laugh at himself or herself; not taking oneself too seriously is 
critical for maintaining perspective about an OD effort, espe-
cially because nothing ever goes exactly according to plan, even 
though OD is supposed to be a  planned change effort. 
 In addition to these abilities, it is important, of course, for OD 
consultants to have self-confidence and to be interpersonally compe-
tent (Argyris, 1962); that is, to express feelings, own up, and experi-
ment or take risks. Finally, we think it is helpful for consultants to 
have a sense of mission about their work as OD practitioners. They 
should believe that what they are doing is worthwhile and potentially 
helpful to others. This belief helps to sustain energy, to lessen feel-
ings of loneliness and anxiety, and to provide a reason for continuing 
to work with organizations that appear recalcitrant and impossible to 
change.   
 OD Values  
 Following the line of thought and belief that OD constitutes cul-
ture change, it is obviously important that we understand the nature 
of organizational values as thoroughly as possible. We also need to 
understand the value system of the field of OD itself and the carriers 
of this professional culture—OD practitioners and consultants. Thus, 
in this section, we examine the values represented by the field of orga-
nization development.  
 We can gain some understanding of the values represented by 
OD by referring to the field’s roots, especially sensitivity training (see 
 Chapter  3 , “Where Did Organization Development Come From?”). 
This method of education and change has a humanistic value orienta-
tion, the belief that it is worthwhile for people to have the opportu-
nity throughout their lives to learn and develop personally toward a 
full realization and actualization of individual potential. Some people 
believe that this preference not only is worthwhile but also should be 
a right or entitlement.  
 Another OD value that came even more directly from sensitivity 
training is that people’s feelings are just as important a source of data 
for diagnosis and have as much implication for change as do facts or 

266 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
so-called hard data and people’s thoughts and opinions, and that these 
feelings should be considered as legitimate for expression in the orga-
nization as any thought, fact, or opinion.  
 Yet another OD value stemming from sensitivity training is that 
conflict, whether interpersonal or intergroup, should be brought to 
the surface and dealt with directly, rather than ignored, avoided, or 
manipulated. When sensitivity training was at the height of its popu-
larity in the United States, Schein and Bennis (1965) stated what they 
considered to be its two main value systems: a spirit of inquiry and 
democracy.  
 The spirit of inquiry comes from the values of science. Two parts 
of it are relevant: the hypothetical spirit—being tentative checking on 
the validity of assumptions and allowing for error—and experimental-
ism—putting ideas or assumptions to the test. In sensitivity training, 
“all experienced behavior is subject to questioning and examination, 
limited only by the threshold of tolerance to truth and new ideas” 
(Schein & Bennis, 1965, p. 32). A corollary value mentioned by Schein 
and Bennis is being authentic in interpersonal relations.  
 The second main value system, the democratic value, has two ele-
ments: collaboration and conflict resolution through rational means. 
The learning process in sensitivity training is collaborative between 
participant and trainer, not a traditional authoritarian student-teacher 
relationship. By conflict resolution through rational means, Schein 
and Bennis did not mean that irrational behavior or emotion was 
off limits, but “that there is a problem-solving orientation to conflict 
rather than the more traditional approaches based on bargains, power 
plays, suppression, or compromise” (p. 34).  
 Most important—what Schein and Bennis called the “overarch-
ing and fundamental value” (p. 35)—is the matter of choice. Freedom 
from coercion and from the arbitrary exercise of authority is the most 
preferred end state of existence.  
 Schein and Bennis wrote about and espoused those values in the 
1960s, when individualism, rebellion toward authority, and question-
ing the rights of certain traditional institutions were in vogue. What 
about OD today?  

 
CHAPTER  12 • THE ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT CONSULTANT 
267
 Similar to his work with Bennis in the 1960s, Schein (2014) 
addresses the values of OD today in his examination of the role of 
coercive persuasion in education and learning. The importance of 
Schein’s analysis is that experiential learning of interpersonal, group, 
and interorganizational relationships, what he refers to as the “human 
side of enterprise, that is management and leadership” (p. 2) continue 
to be important components of OD. In his discussion, Schein empha-
sizes the importance of animating clients and students through valid 
and agreed-upon goals by involving them in the diagnostic and inter-
vention process, always ensuring the matter of  choice, just as he stated 
with Bennis almost 50 years earlier. However, while attending to the 
human side of organizational life remains an OD value, Schein asks, 
“Can a networked multicultural world design experiential learning 
settings that animate learners or will we invent yet another mode of 
learning without the intense face to face contact that animation seems 
to depend on?” (p. 23). We understand this question from Schein as a 
way of preserving OD values that began with sensitivity training at the 
same time as recognizing the opportunities for OD today.  
 Burke and colleagues (Church & Burke, 1993; Church, Burke, & 
Van Eynde, 1994) addressed the question of “what about OD today?” 
at the time of the second edition of this book and again, recently 
(Shull, Church, & Burke, 2013). Both times, they surveyed OD prac-
titioners about their perceptions of the field, values, motivators, and 
intervention activities; the recent study compares the findings to the 
earlier one.  
 The current findings (Shull, Church, & Burke, 2013) were both 
similar to and different from findings in the 1993 study regarding per-
ceptions of the field. Following are the five primary findings:  
  
1.  Practitioners once again reported a perceived weakening of 
traditional values in OD today, and the trend was significantly 
more pronounced than in the past, particularly regarding new 
entrants into the field.  
  
2.  Practitioners continue to agree that OD work should focus on 
business effectiveness and efficiency, and the perception that 
OD is too interpersonal, touchy-feely, or missionary in orienta-
tion has declined from years past.  

268 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
  
3.  Practitioners have aligned in greater numbers against the mis-
use of power and authority in organizational life and have be-
come much more committed to their organizations.  
  
4.  Practitioners see coaching as an integral part of OD today. 
  
5.  Despite other trends, practitioners are very optimistic about 
the future of OD and only a fifth see the field in a state of crisis 
(pp. 13–20).    
 These findings as discussed by Shull et al. (2013) are relevant to 
our discussion of values, preparation for the role of OD consultant, 
and the future of OD. The perceived weakening of traditional values 
of OD, and that those with more experience viewed new colleagues 
in the field as lacking in academic preparation and without sufficient 
knowledge of how the current practice of OD is informed by early 
research and theory development, is addressed in the next section 
on preparation for the role of OD consultant. Regarding continued 
agreement that the focus of OD should be on business effectiveness 
and  efficiency suggests some degree of clarity about the purpose of 
OD and is not surprising given the increased demand on HR and OD 
professionals to engage as business partners and demonstrate their 
capacity to add value as strategic thought partners. The finding that 
the commitment to addressing the misuse of power and authority in 
organizations is even stronger than it was 20 years ago may be related 
to the greater incidence (or reporting) of the abuse of power between 
1993 and 2013 and the shift in organizational structures and accom-
panying models of authority. The finding that coaching was perceived 
as  integral to OD is addressed in  Chapter  13 and our view about the 
perception of optimism in the field is addressed in  Chapter  14 , “Orga-
nization Development and the Future.”  
 Overall, we agree with Shull et al. (2013) about the importance of 
understanding the core values of the field as espoused by the found-
ers of OD. As stated at the beginning, given that OD work is about 
culture change and culture change is about behavior, attitudes, and 
values, how can one engage in culture change—that is, OD work—
without a firm grounding in the roots, and therefore values, of the 
field? As culture carriers, OD practitioners have a responsibility and 
obligation to represent the field accurately. In the next section, we 
provide our recommendations for requisite training and experience 
in OD.  

 
CHAPTER  12 • THE ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT CONSULTANT 
269
 Becoming an OD Consultant and Integrating 
OD Competencies into Other Organizational 
Roles  
 Like any other field that consists of applying skills and implement-
ing a particular kind of practice, experience is the best teacher for OD 
practice—or rather, experience accompanied by related feedback is 
the most impactful. One can have numerous experiences, but unless 
one receives feedback about which experiences are more related to 
effective practice, then learning rarely occurs. Thus, one should try to 
obtain experience in and feedback on consultative activities.  
 As discussed in the section on values, in addition to experience, 
it is also necessary to learn the fundamentals of the field and to gain 
an understanding and appreciation for the history of OD. There is 
no substitute for academic learning and nonacademic training for 
becoming an OD consultant as well as for integrating OD competen-
cies into other organizational roles.  
 Academic Learning  
 We suggest the following 12 areas to provide a good background 
for OD practice. These courses are fairly common, sometimes offered 
as a comprehensive OD curriculum within a university, and also avail-
able as stand-alone courses. Obtaining education in these domains 
would be most useful:  
 
•   Organizational psychology or organizational behavior.   The for-
mer is typically offered in a department of psychology, the latter 
in a school of business or management. Either course provides 
the necessary background for understanding human behavior 
in an organizational context.  
 
•   Organization theory.  This course should follow the basic course 
on organizational behavior or organizational psychology. Usu-
ally this kind of course helps one learn about organizational 
design, effectiveness (performance criteria), and the organiza-
tion as a system.  

270 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 
•   Group dynamics.  This kind of course is a must. Organiza-
tions are composed of subsystems, usually in the form of work 
groups or teams. Understanding the theory, research, and con-
ceptual aspects of group behavior as well as the applicability of 
this knowledge helps one understand the utility of groups and 
teams in organizations, and adds to one’s understanding of sys-
tem dynamics.  
 
  Most group dynamics courses include an experiential compo-
nent as it is virtually impossible to learn about group dynam-
ics without actually experiencing group dynamics in the “here 
and now” followed by opportunities for reflection, meaning-
making, and application work.  
 
•   Organization development.  The course may not be called OD; 
instead it may be titled “organization change,” “action research 
and consultation,” “managing change,” and so forth. Such 
courses usually include opportunities to learn specific skills 
associated with consultation as well as experience in data col-
lection for diagnosis, feedback, and planned change.  
 
•   Process consultation.  A course with this title is not likely to be 
available, but any course that provides an understanding of 
what process is and experience in working with it as a consul-
tant would be useful. Sometimes this topic is covered in a group 
dynamics course and/or in an OD course. To clarify:  
 The process consultant seeks to give the client insight 
into what is going on around him, within him, and be-
tween him and other people. Based on such insight, the 
consultant then helps the client to figure out what he 
should do about the situation. But the core of this model 
is that the client must be helped to remain “pro-active,” 
in the sense of retaining both the diagnostic and reme-
dial initiative (Schein, 1988, p. 11).  
 
 Identifying a course that would provide what Schein describes 
is what is most important.  
 
•   Research methods.  Field research methods are preferable 
because they are the most applicable for learning about applied 
research, data collection and analysis in organizations, evalua-
tion methods, and evidence-based practice.  

 
CHAPTER  12 • THE ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT CONSULTANT 
271
 
•   Adult learning.  This type of course is useful for understanding 
how organization members may learn from their experiences 
on the job as well as for knowing more about the appropriate 
rationale for designing teaching and learning opportunities. A 
related course on  Training and Development  provides useful 
information about design of programs and about how to conduct 
certain learning activities associated with talent development.  
 
•   Social equality and diversity in organizations.  As the world 
population changes, so does the demographic composition of 
organizations. As a result, work practices come under scrutiny 
and often require change and innovation; differences among 
and between individuals and groups must be addressed. Under-
standing how to leverage diversity and create inclusive work 
environments is an area of expertise that clients expect from 
OD practitioners.  
 
•   Negotiation and conflict resolution.  Organization development 
and change often involves trying to gain alignment between and 
among individuals, teams, and organizations with conflicting 
interests. Additionally, culture change is usually concomitant 
with greater ambiguity and anxiety as well as fallout from unan-
ticipated consequences; these conditions are often accompa-
nied by an increase in conflict. Being well versed in the theories 
and techniques associated with negotiation and conflict resolu-
tion are requisite for the OD practitioner.  
 
•   Coaching.   This kind of course can provide critical skills for spe-
cific help to individual organization members and often to a 
team or subunit within a client system. Coaching courses usu-
ally have a blended design focused on theory and practice.  
 
•   Human resource management.  This course provides the nec-
essary grounding in the organizational function that is most 
related to OD. A closely associated course is  Career Devel-
opment as OD consultants are frequently involved in design-
ing career development programs and are involved in human 
resources planning and talent development.  
 
•   Functions of organizations.  This course might be subtitled “crash 
course in business.” Such a course is designed for students who 
have no background in business or in how organizations actually 

272 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
function. Thus, there are classes on accounting, finance, budget-
ing, operations, marketing, strategy, and the manager’s role. It 
is a course about learning a new language as we believe strongly 
that to be effective as an organizational psychologist, in general, 
and as an organization consultant, in particular, one needs to 
know at least some of the basics about how organizations oper-
ate and function as well as the language of management.  
 We purposely limited ourselves to 12 areas, conforming to a typi-
cal master’s degree program requiring 36 to 45 credits.  
 Nonacademic Training  
 Several professional development programs are offered by train-
ing organizations or by the continuing or executive education divisions 
of universities. These provide useful training in both the knowledge 
and skills appropriate to OD practice, but the weight is usually on the 
side of skill development. The following are five avenues or programs 
for developing oneself toward becoming an OD practitioner:  
 
•  Laboratory training programs 
 
•  A program devoted to improving one’s interpersonal 
competence—a T-group, Gestalt group, or something very 
similar.   
 
•  Instead of emphasizing interpersonal development, a pro-
gram that focuses on intrapersonal understanding. Because 
the primary instrument in OD work is the consultant practi-
tioner, it is important that one know this instrument as well 
as possible.  
 
•  A Tavistock group relations conference focused on learning 
group dynamics by examining behavior at the group level, 
and considering unconscious forces that influence indi-
viduals, groups, and systems. A group relations perspective 
enables OD consultant practitioners to diagnose organiza-
tional problems systemically, expanding options for interven-
tions and solutions.     

 
CHAPTER  12 • THE ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT CONSULTANT 
273
 
•  Organization development training programs 
 
•  OD programs usually provide an introduction to the field 
and practice in consulting. This type of program is ideal 
because it offers a safe environment for testing untried skills. 
 
•   Advanced OD programs for professional development are 
designed for experienced OD practitioners and provide an 
opportunity for more advanced development and network-
ing with experienced professionals.  
 
•  Supervised experience 
 
  Sometimes such an experience is provided as part of a consul-
tation skills training program; otherwise, one needs to consult 
with an actual client and arrange some form of supervision from 
an experienced OD consultant. Having a mentor is a related 
avenue for professional and personal development.  
 
•  Internal consultant with large organization 
 
  An excellent way to get started in OD is to work for an orga-
nization that has an internal OD service for its managers. We 
emphasize  large organizations because the opportunities would 
be greater and more varied. One may not be able to join an inter-
nal OD group immediately; given that, the entry job should be 
at least closely associated with OD work, such as learning and 
development, career development, talent development, or as 
a human resource generalist or human resource business part-
ner. One can then develop a network that will facilitate entry to 
other OD opportunities such as supervised experience.  
 
•  Professional associations 
 
  Belonging to and attending the meetings of certain associations 
devoted to OD can of course help one learn about and keep 
up with the field. Such organizations are the OD Network, 
the Association for Talent Development (formerly American 
Society for Training & Development), the Society for Human 
Resource Management, the Academy of Management Divi-
sion of Organization Development and Change, the American 
Psychological Association Division of Consulting Psychology 
(Division 13) and the Society of Industrial and Organizational 
Psychology (Division 14), and regional groups of these associa-
tions in the United States and globally.  

274 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 In the Executive Masters Program in Change Leadership at 
Teachers College, Columbia University, the curriculum reflects nine 
clusters of competencies culled from professional organizations that 
serve as arbiters of the basic requirements for professions related to 
change leadership. The nine clusters are the following:  
  
•  Knowledge of organizational frameworks and models, and sys-
tems thinking;  
 
•  Knowledge of the consulting cycle (entry and contracting, data 
collection, diagnosis, feedback, planning change, intervention, 
and evaluation);  
 
•  Knowledge of strategy and organization design; 
 
•  Leadership and management (knowledge, skills, and abilities); 
 
•  Applied research and evaluation; 
  
•  Ability to use self-as-instrument (to be reflective and 
self-examining);   
 
•  Awareness of group dynamics, power and authority dynamics, 
and diversity and intercultural dynamics;  
 
•  Individual and group facilitation and coaching skills; and 
 
•  Collaboration and conflict negotiation skills. 
 Engaging in academic and nonacademic training programs 
detailed here provides opportunities to develop these nine clusters of 
competencies.  
 Being an OD consultant means being a practitioner. We practice 
OD much as lawyers and physicians practice law and medicine, but 
there are no bar or boards to pass and there is no licensing proce-
dure. Short of such a procedure, we believe that some combination 
of academic training and professional development is the next best 
approach to becoming an OD consultant.  
 Line managers who want to integrate OD knowledge and skills 
into their repertoire can pursue academic and nonacademic learn-
ing opportunities similar to individuals who want OD to be central 
to their professional identities. It would be important, however, for 
line managers to be aware that some of what is taught in academic 
and nonacademic OD programs requires translation before leverag-
ing the knowledge and skills in service of more effective management 

 
CHAPTER  12 • THE ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT CONSULTANT 
275
and change leadership. Exploring the theory and research that under-
girds evidence-based OD practice is akin to learning what informs 
evidence-based management. Based on our experience with execu-
tives across functions, sectors,  and geographies via consulting, 
coaching, executive education programs, and our degree programs 
in Social-Organizational Psychology at Teachers College, Columbia 
University, integrating evidence-based management and evidence-
based OD practice is an effective combination.  
 Self-as-Instrument  
 Taken together, the skills and abilities necessary to work as an OD 
consultant that have been discussed fall into four buckets: content 
knowledge, facilitation skill, personal characteristics, and expertise 
in self-as-instrument. We have allotted a special section to develop-
ing expertise in self-as-instrument for several reasons. First, content 
knowledge can be acquired through academic, and to a lesser extent 
through nonacademic, training. Similarly, facilitation skills can be 
learned by participation in laboratory and organization development 
training programs. Personal characteristics, as noted, are related 
to personality or basic temperament and can be enhanced through 
achieving a high level of self-awareness, specifically, and more gener-
ally, through developing emotional intelligence.  
 The Emotional Intelligence framework as developed by Goleman, 
Boyatzis, and McKee (2002) consists of a 2×2, with  Self and  Social on 
the vertical axis and  Awareness and  Management on the horizontal 
axis. Within each quadrant is a set of competencies: Self-Awareness 
includes Emotional Self-Awareness, Accurate Self-Assessment, and 
Self-Confidence; Self-Management includes Self-Management, 
Transparency, Adaptability, Achievement, Initiative, and Optimism; 
Social Awareness includes Empathy, Organizational Awareness, 
and Service; Relationship Management includes Inspiration, Influ-
ence, Developing Others, Change Catalyst, Conflict Management, 
and Teamwork and Collaboration. Many of these competencies are 
included in the section on Consultant Abilities and while we have 
made the case for their importance in working  in the organization 
development and change arena, emotional intelligence is necessary 

276 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
for using oneself as an instrument in OD work. More specifically, 
developing expertise in self-as-instrument requires the capacity to 
not only be self-aware and self-manage, have social awareness, and 
manage relationships, but to also know  how to use one’s emotional 
intelligence and lived experience in the “here and now” in service of 
understanding, and working with, a client system.  
 Burke (1982, 1994) as well as Levinson (1972a) and others (Berg 
& Smith, 1985; Berg & Smith, 1988; Cheung-Judge, 2001; McCor-
mick & White, 2000; Smith, 1995) have spoken of the self as the most 
important instrument an OD consultant has and as such, like any 
instrument, keeping it well tuned requires ongoing discipline, rigor, 
and practice. As noted in  Chapter  6 , “Understanding Organizations: 
The Process of Diagnosis,” Levinson includes consultant observations 
and feelings as one set of information that adds to the diagnosis, and 
an example of using self-as-instrument data for diagnosis and inter-
vention is an aspect of the case  study in  Chapter  8 , “Understanding 
Organizations: Covert Processes.”  
 Including consultant observations and feelings in the diagnosis, 
however, is a complex skill, as the consultant needs to act as a ther-
mometer of sorts, able to discern what is about the self and what is 
about the client. It is for this reason that self-knowledge is essential. 
As stated in the Talmud, “You do not see things as they are but as you 
are.” For example, if a consultant always feels anxious when entering 
a client system, anxiety may not be a differentiator about a particular 
client system. If, however, anxiety emerges as the consultant becomes 
more engaged with the  client and it is not indicative of a common 
emotional tenor of the consultant, then it is more likely to be a data 
point about something inside the client system. Still though, we would 
not expect a consultant to do anything more than take note of the 
anxiety until he or she has other data with which to triangulate the 
anxiety (McCormick & White, 2000).  
 I (Noumair) have found using self-as-instrument most powerful 
when my experience in the client system aligns with data collected 
through other methods and I am able to include my experience in the 
dialogue when the client is struggling to engage in joint diagnosis with 
me. It is as if the client cannot deny my experience because it brings 
to life the very issues that the organization is attempting to address in 
the change effort. At such times, it is the consultant’s marginality as 

 
CHAPTER  12 • THE ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT CONSULTANT 
277
discussed earlier (Margulies, 1978) that is critical to the veracity of the 
self-as-instrument data, and to the  client perceiving it as legitimate. 
Its legitimacy is a key factor in making the diagnosis real for the client, 
thereby facilitating greater ownership of the issues to be addressed. 
If the consultant is perceived as too much a member of the client sys-
tem, the data will not be seen as sufficiently differentiated from other 
organization members to be useful. If the consultant is seen as too 
distant from the client system, the self-as-instrument data may not be 
rich or nuanced enough to make a difference.  
 OD is a practice of art and craft as well as the application of behav-
ioral science. It requires rigorous professional knowledge grounded in 
data-based research and practice. Developing expertise in using self-
as-instrument is at the intersection of art, craft, and behavioral science 
and when expertly employed, it is one tool of data-based research and 
practice. The next section on reflective practice describes how to tune 
one’s self-as-instrument as well as introduces other tools essential to 
the art and craft of OD practice.  
 Reflective Practice  
 Introduced by Schön in  The Reflective Practitioner (1983), 
“[R]eflective practice is the capacity to reflect on action so as to engage 
in a process of continuous learning” (p. 62). It provides opportunities 
to critically review what has been successful in the past and what can 
be improved in the future. Gillette (1995), introducing reflection in 
general, and Schön’s work in particular, defines reflection:  
 The ability to reflect consists of being able to step out of an 
experience and generate, through a different perspective on 
that experience. It is not a flight from self but a dialogue with 
self. I often imagine it as the generation of an internal dia-
logue, between a temporarily created new “me” and the “me” 
who is filled with the experiences. It is sort of an internal de-
briefing process (p. 21).  
 This internal dialogue is what Schön is known for from his study 
of unusually competent performers. Schön introduced two con-
cepts that are central to reflective practice: Reflection-in-Action and 

278 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
Reflection-on-Action. Reflection-in-Action is the ability of a practi-
tioner to “think on her or his feet.” Within any given moment, when 
faced with a professional issue, a practitioner usually connects with 
his or her feelings, emotions, and prior experiences to attend to a situ-
ation in the moment. Connecting feelings and emotions with prior 
experiences is what allows a practitioner to use past learning in service 
of working differently in the present. In effect,  reflective practitioners 
(and OD consultants) work as improvisation artists (Schein, 2013b; 
Schön, 1987).  
 Some examples of Reflection-in-Action include Self-as-
Instrument as already discussed, Surfacing Undiscussables, and Get-
ting on the Balcony (Heifetz & Linsky, 2002). Surfacing undiscuss-
ables refers to becoming aware in the moment of an “elephant in the 
room” that, if discussed, would be helpful to the task at hand, and 
then creating conditions for the important yet difficult conversation 
to occur. Often serving as a safe container for such conversations is 
one of the most important functions an OD consultant can serve.  
 Getting on the balcony, a concept introduced by Heifetz and Lin-
sky (2002), involves getting off the dance floor and going to the bal-
cony in order to temporarily pause the action and gain perspective. By 
doing so, one is then able to rejoin the dance floor with a greater sense 
of clarity having observed patterns of behavior and dynamics. It is an 
iterative process and if one can move swiftly between the dance floor 
and the balcony, metaphorically speaking, it is a tool for Reflection-
in-Action. If going to the balcony takes one out of the action for a 
considerable period of  time, it is a tool for Reflection-on-Action.  
 Reflection-on-Action occurs after an experience when a practi-
tioner analyzes her or his reaction to a situation and explores the rea-
sons for, and consequences of, her or his actions. This usually occurs 
through a documented reflection of the situation. Central to Schön’s 
work is the idea that professional growth begins when the practitioner 
starts to view things with a critical lens and develops the capacity to 
doubt his or her behavior. Developing this capacity occurs as a result 
of cumulating experience as discernment can only occur as a result of 
examining oneself across differentiated situations.

279
 Related to Reflection-on-Action, Argyris and Schön (1978) devel-
oped the concept of single and double loop learning. Single loop 
learning is when there is an action and a consequence of the action 
followed by another action. Cycles of single loop learning repeat 
themselves identically without interruption, even when the conse-
quence of the action is not what was intended. Double loop learning 
is when there is an action, a consequence of the action, followed by 
reflection before the next action is taken. By establishing a cycle of 
action-reflection, reflection-action, a pause is created long enough to 
reflect and learn, hopefully producing better  results the next time an 
action is taken.  
 Examples of Reflection-on-Action to create double loop learning 
are the Left-Hand Column Exercise, developed by Argyris and Schön 
(1974); After Action Reviews (AARs) and Before Action Reviews 
(BARs) (Darling, Parry, & Moore, 2005) as discussed in  Chapter 
 11 , “Does Organization Development Work?”; regularly keeping a 
journal in which one responds to questions that facilitate the identi-
fication of feelings and associated thoughts in order to “connect the 
dots”; and seeking feedback on a piece of work witnessed by a men-
tor, colleague, or coach. For an application of double loop learning to 
coaching, see Witherspoon (2014). All of these create a structure for 
reflecting on action and provide opportunities to learn from experi-
ence. As best stated by John Dewey (1938), “We do not learn from 
experience, we learn from reflecting on experience.”  
 Conclusion  
 In this chapter, we have considered the values of the field and the 
role, characteristics, and abilities of the OD consultant. In the broad-
est sense, the role of the OD practitioner contains four functions, 
that of expert, educator or trainer, counselor or coach, and consul-
tant. The consultant may behave in a directive manner, perhaps even 
as an advocate, or, at the opposite extreme, may behave very nondi-
rectively, serving perhaps as a reflector, primarily raising questions. 
For the most part, however, the OD consultant serves in a facilitative 
capacity, helping clients learn how to learn, and learn how to change, 
in  order to solve their own problems more effectively.  

280 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 We also considered the role of the OD consultant from another 
perspective. Remaining marginal, at the boundary or interface 
between individuals, especially managers and direct reports, and 
between groups and subsystems, is critical to effective consultation, at 
least from the vantage point of organization development practice. In 
this marginal role, the consultant functions in an organic way, attempt-
ing to intervene in a timely manner and according to what the client 
needs at the time. Consulting organically means that the practitioner 
must use himself or herself as an instrument—sensing client need by 
paying attention not only to what may be observed  but also to his or 
her own feelings and intuitions. This form of consultation is not easy 
and is highly dependent on the skills of the consultant and subject to 
bias according to the consultant’s personal values and attitudes. Obvi-
ously, the effective OD consultant will be sensitive to these issues, be 
aware of what values are espoused by the field he or she represents, 
and work hard to be consistent in word and deed. Toward this ideal, 
we discussed the importance of shadow consultation as well as ongo-
ing reflective practice in order to ensure that individuals keep their 
self-as-instrument well  tuned throughout their professional practice.  
 In addition to considering the role of OD consultant as a profes-
sional identity, we also acknowledged that line managers are incor-
porating OD knowledge and skill into their repertoire as change is 
now a constant in contemporary organizational life. We included 
information on academic and nonacademic training that can facili-
tate entry into the field as well as how to develop OD competen-
cies as an expansion of other organizational roles. The next chapter, 
“Coaching and Organization Development,” addresses similar issues 
regarding coaching; that is, a role with its own professional identity as 
well as a skill set that is integrated into other roles across functions in 
organizations.

 Coaching and Organization Development 
 An executive coaching engagement begins following a leadership 
development program in which the coach worked with the client on 
her multi-rater feedback. The client was recently promoted and coach-
ing was offered as one means of support for her leadership transition. 
During the contracting process, the coach learns that not only is the 
client undergoing a leadership transition, the organization is chal-
lenged by the ambivalent succession of a beloved leader who is also the 
manager and longstanding sponsor and mentor of her client. While 
the coaching engagement is viewed by the organization as an indi-
vidual level intervention, the coach recognizes that  in order to facili-
tate a successful leadership transition of her client, she must also work 
on succession of the revered leader with the organization, with her 
client, and with the revered leader, himself, as the two are inextricably 
linked. Is this a coaching engagement or an organizational consulta-
tion or both? 
 As will be discussed in this chapter, we locate coaching as a com-
ponent of OD and view this vignette of an actual case as indicative of 
the challenges that OD consultants and coaches must address. These 
are relatively new challenges because when the second edition of this 
book was published, 1994, coaching was just beginning to have a pres-
ence in organization development (OD).  
 Grant (2011) reported that although the first peer-reviewed arti-
cle in coaching was published in 1937, publications of coaching-
related research did not significantly increase until 1995, with outcome 
studies surging beginning in 2000.  Consulting Psychology: Theory 
and Practice  produced five special issues of executive coaching 
between 1996 and 2008 (Diedrich, 2008). Recounting the history of 
executive coaching, Maltbia, Marsick, and Ghosh (2014) note that the 

282 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
first professional association for coaching began in 1994. Nearly 
twenty years later, one of five major findings reported in a 2013 sur-
vey of OD practitioners was that coaching is seen as “valuable and 
relevant to the practice  of OD” (Shull, Church, & Burke, 2013, p. 20). 
 Although it has emerged very rapidly, coaching remains young in 
its development and insufficiently bounded (Feldman & Lankau, 
2005; Kauffman & Coutou, 2009; Pavur, 2013; Peterson, 2011). 
Numerous questions exist concerning the differences among coach-
ing, therapy, consulting, mentoring, and training (Alderfer, 2014; 
Evers, Brouwers, & Tomic, 2006; Kauffman & Coutou, 2009; Schein, 
2000). There are also concerns that anyone can identify as a coach, be 
paid for services, and perform poorly without sanction. Further, how 
to classify coaching—as an intervention within organizational consul-
tation, as a role, or as its own profession—is also under consideration 
in the literature (Sperry, 2008). More  recently, deHaan et al. (2013) 
stated, “It is apparent that the coaching field is in a state of flux and 
only just beginning to be regulated as a profession” (p. 41).  
 Several efforts are under way to address these concerns; notably, 
the Graduate School Alliance for Executive Coaching (GSAEC) is 
working to advance executive and organizational coaching as an aca-
demic discipline (Maltbia et al., 2014). A study to identify coaching 
competencies by two divisions within the American Psychological 
Association—the Society of Consulting Psychology (SCP) and the 
Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP)—is in 
progress. The expectation is that the results will be used to develop a 
competency model to serve as a guide for psychologists regarding the 
basic knowledge and skills required for effective coaching. Benefits 
will accrue to consumers  of coaching and their organizations, and to 
psychologists and graduate training programs in psychology.  
 With the nascent state of coaching, in this chapter we consider 
coaching as it is currently practiced. We examine coaching as a set of 
competencies within the role of OD consultant, as a function within 
the role of internal consultant, as a role with its own professional iden-
tity, external coach, and as a system-level intervention. We focus on 
coaching roles in which the coach has no formal authority over a cli-
ent. Across roles and contexts, we discuss types of coaching and coach-
ing process, including our point of view on coaching. Concluding 

 
CHAPTER  13 • COACHING AND ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT 
283
thoughts focus on abilities, skills, and knowledge domains that  are 
requisite for coaching as well as suggested learning opportunities.  
 Definitions  
 The word “coach” dates back to the 1500s when it referred to a 
carriage that moved valuable people from where they were to where 
they wanted to be. Although this concept remains true today, coach-
ing as an enterprise is fast moving and a case in which practice is well 
ahead of theory and research (Bennett, 2006; Evers et al., 2006; Feld-
man & Lankau, 2005). Coaching has come to have multiple meanings, 
spanning a number of disciplines and domains (Sperry, 2008, 2013). 
As a point of departure, we define coaching as a process of learning 
and development that leads to new  perspectives, attitudes, behaviors, 
and skills. We view coaching as a tool to support individual, team, 
and organization learning, and as a lever for change. Our focus is on 
coaching that is conducted within the domain of organizational life.  
 One origin of coaching is sports, where every athlete has a coach. 
In sports, coaching is an integral component of work, the game, 
and performance, whereas that is not true in organizations. Link-
ing it to sports, however, allows coaching to be viewed as normative 
and absent any taboo. This association, we believe, is one driver of 
the explosion of executive and organizational coaching. Coaching is 
an acceptable way of helping individuals, teams, and organizations 
improve performance.  
 The idea of a taboo emerges from the seeming similarity of coach-
ing with therapy. Kauffman and Coutou (2009) conducted a study 
in which they examined perceptions of similarities and differences 
among coaching, consulting, and therapy. In their report, coaching is 
differentiated from therapy as it focuses on individual performance 
in an organizational context rather than on diagnosis and treatment 
of dysfunctionality. This perception that therapy is about fixing some-
thing that is personally broken in an individual is the stigma that 
threatens coaching. Depending on the organizational culture and the 
meaning of coaching in that organization, engaging in coaching may 
be  viewed as treatment for the dysfunctional behavior of an individ-
ual. The opposite is also true; in some organizations, coaching may be 

284 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
viewed as a reward for high performance and symbolic of an organiza-
tion’s investment in an individual.  
 As a licensed psychologist who was initially trained as a therapist 
and later as a consultant and coach, I (Noumair) can attest to the dif-
ferences between therapy and coaching from first-hand experience. 
With my first forays into executive coaching, I was able to facilitate 
greater self-awareness in my clients; they appreciated my empa-
thetic responses to their organizational challenges. My colleagues 
would send all their “difficult” coaching cases to me, which was an 
implicit way of stating that what they thought the client really needed 
was therapy. While increasing self-awareness was part of the task of 
coaching and I was competent to work with “difficult” cases, it often 
felt as if I was doing psychotherapy at work and because it was labeled 
“executive coaching” it was acceptable to the executives and viewed 
as appropriate by their organizations. However, my work as an execu-
tive coach improved when I invited clients to align enhanced self-
awareness, behavioral change, and strategic organizational objectives. 
This shift meant that the focus of coaching was on the individual in 
his or her organizational role inside an organizational system, and as a 
result, the boundary conditions for the work were clear and in service 
of both the individual and  the organization. The adjustments I made 
to my practice of coaching are best described in Dotlich and Cairo’s 
(1999) book,  Action Coaching.  “Action coaching is a process that fos-
ters self-awareness and that results in the motivation to change, as 
well as the guidance needed if change is to take place in ways that 
meet organizational needs” (p. 18).  
 Further, Dotlich and Cairo describe differences between what 
they refer to as  traditional coaching versus  action coaching. The cul-
mination of these shifts from traditional coaching to action coaching 
is that coaching focuses on an individual in an organizational role 
within a specific context and highlights the importance of establishing 
a coaching contract that has alignment between an individual’s goals 
and the organization’s goals as central to the work. These differences 
in role dictate a different kind of practice and reflect my experience 
of moving from therapist to executive coach.  
 In the Kauffman and Coutou (2009) report, coaching is differ-
entiated from consulting as having more of a focus on individual 

 
CHAPTER  13 • COACHING AND ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT 
285
performance within an organizational context rather than a direct 
focus on organizational performance. A consultant’s responsibility is 
to the organization as a whole even when the consultation may be 
with a subset of the organization. A coach’s responsibility is to the 
individual while holding a systems view of the context as well as the 
client’s perception of the context. And although it is true that as a rule 
coaching is an individual-level intervention, it must not be overlooked 
that coaching  is always conducted within context. The context can 
be cultural, hierarchical, interdependent, values-based, and a myriad 
of other aspects of one’s environment. A fundamental of coaching, 
therefore, is to help the client articulate how the context influences 
his or her actions, and how one might in turn influence these con-
textual factors. In this regard, it is essential that the coach and client 
consider the context in which coaching takes place, including who ini-
tiated coaching, terms of the contract including scope and timeframe, 
metrics, limits of confidentiality, and who is responsible for paying 
for coaching services. Boundary conditions differentiate coaching and  
consulting from therapy. Coaches and consultants usually work with 
clients at the client’s organization, whereas therapy occurs in the ther-
apist’s office. Organizations usually contract and pay for coaching and 
consulting, whereas therapy is paid for by the individual or through 
medical insurance. Because coaching is usually located in a client’s 
organization and paid for by a client’s organization, the organization 
is an ever-present factor influencing the purpose of coaching and the 
coaching relationship.  
 Although confidentiality is an aspect of all three helping rela-
tionships (therapy, consulting, and coaching), therapists are bound 
by a different code of ethics than coaches and consultants. In prac-
tice, this means that in therapy, confidentiality is only broken without 
prior consent if the client is at risk for harming her/himself or others. 
In coaching, confidentiality is more limited as the contract usually 
involves multiple parties—the client, the manager, and an HR profes-
sional—and must be negotiated.  
 It is also important to differentiate coaching from mentoring. 
Alderfer (2014), discussing the classic work of Levinson, Darrow, 
Klein, Levinson, and McKee (1978) and Levinson and Levinson 
(1996), makes a case for the original meaning of mentoring:  

286 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 The relationship consists of senior people helping junior col-
leagues develop the younger person’s sense of personal au-
thority based on  the junior person’s Dream of themselves in 
a mature adult role . It is decidedly not imposing (or subtly 
promoting) an organization’s or a mentor’s version of what 
that person should become. It is helping the younger person 
listen to their inner voice and learn to act in accord with it. It 
is a disservice to both protégé and mentor if the older person 
consciously or inadvertently acts otherwise. When this occurs, 
neither protégé nor mentor will reap the benefits of the  re-
lationship, which fundamentally are intrinsic for both parties 
(p. 7).  
 From Alderfer’s discussion of Levinson’s work on mentoring, the 
differences between coaching and mentoring are clear. Coaching is 
fundamentally about improving performance, and in the context of 
organizational life, the client will not be the sole arbiter of providing 
evidence for improved performance. The manager and HR profes-
sional usually determine the metrics for improved performance based 
on organizational goals rather than on the client’s  Dream (Levinson et 
al., 1978; Levinson & Levinson, 1996). Another difference between 
mentoring and coaching is the source of authority. In mentoring rela-
tionships as discussed by Alderfer (2014), authority emanates from 
the protégé. In coaching relationships, authority  is shared by the 
coach, the client, and the organizational sponsor of the work.  
 Authority relations also help to distinguish training and coach-
ing. Training offers another avenue for leadership development and 
performance improvement. The organization and the trainer drive 
the agenda more than the individual seeking development (Evers et 
al., 2006). Trainers provide learning opportunities that are designed 
for groups rather than individuals and as such must have broader 
appeal to larger audiences usually providing actionable information, 
instruction, and advice (deHaan et al., 2013). Coaching, in contrast, 
is a customized solution tailored uniquely for an individual client and 
co-created by the coach, the client, and the organizational sponsor of 
the work.  

 
CHAPTER  13 • COACHING AND ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT 
287
 Types of Coaching  
 Having differentiated coaching from therapy, consulting, mentor-
ing, and training, it is important to discuss types of coaching. Peter-
son (2011) in the  Handbook of Industrial-Organizational Psychology 
presents a taxonomy of four types of coaches:  feedback, insight and 
accountability ,  content, and  development-process coaches. We dis-
cuss each type within Peterson’s frame (2011) and elaborate on its 
relevance to OD work.  
 Feedback coaches (Peterson, 2011) focus on facilitating under-
standing of results from assessments, such as multi-rater feedback, 
personality, emotional intelligence, learning styles, learning agility, 
interpersonal relations, communication preferences, conflict style, 
and cultural awareness, with the aim of creating a development 
plan that can be implemented and monitored until goals are accom-
plished. “Assessment is an essential element of coaching. It is impor-
tant because people in the workplace tend to avoid frankness when 
they deal with one another, especially when they interact with people 
to whom they report—bosses and those who formally evaluate and 
pay them” (Peltier, 2010, p. 1). Relatedly, Hogan (2006) argues  that 
assessment should be of a leader’s reputation rather than identity, as 
individuals are notoriously poor self-raters.  
 Assessment-anchored coaching engagements are usually brief, 
one or two sessions either as independent assignments or may occur 
as part of a leadership development program. Although additional 
research is needed on all aspects of coaching, there is some agree-
ment that multi-rater feedback with coaching or feedback facilitation 
is more effective in increasing self-awareness and perceived behav-
ioral change than reviewing multi-rater feedback alone (Luthans & 
Peterson, 2003; Nowack & Mashihi, 2012; Siefert, Yukl, & McDon-
ald, 2003; Smither, London, Flautt, Vargas, and Kucine, 2003). The 
best use of multi-rater feedback is as a catalyst for important con-
versations, and working with a feedback coach can provide the often 
much-needed support for important conversations.  
 An example of multi-rater feedback as a catalyst for important 
conversations occurred with a client that I (Noumair) coached in a 
leadership development program. During a coaching session focused 
on reviewing his multi-rater feedback, the client expressed rage at 

288 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
his direct reports for not sharing their feedback with him directly 
but instead anonymously responding to a survey online. Observing 
his body language and hearing his language—pounding his fist, rais-
ing his voice, and expressing anger at their “cowardly behavior”—I 
suggested that if this is how he might have behaved had they shared 
their feedback directly with him, I understood why they did not. His 
anger then expanded to include me. After completing the coaching 
engagement within the program, with some trepidation I followed up 
with him one month later. At that time I learned that although the 
program, and especially the multi-rater feedback and coaching, had 
been emotionally painful for him, it did lead to important conversa-
tions. He returned to work and initiated a conversation with his team 
about the feedback given to him. A radical departure from his usual 
way of leading and managing, he invited dialogue and created space 
for shared action planning. Moreover, he shared his feedback with  his 
wife and daughter, and they said that he behaved similarly at home 
as he did at work. That was the important conversation that led to a 
change in his behavior and also fueled his motivation to make changes 
in both domains, changes he was sure would be sustainable.  
 Another function that feedback coaches serve within OD is to 
support organization culture change by coaching in company-specific 
leadership development programs. Programs of this kind typically 
include a multi-rater feedback instrument custom designed to make 
explicit leadership practices that reflect the behaviors, attitudes, and 
values of the organization’s desired state. In turn, the leadership prac-
tices help to create a shared definition of effective leadership and a 
common language for performance feedback across the company. 
By working with executives in leadership development programs, 
coaches support executives in learning how to implement desired 
leadership practices, provide consistent feedback on agreed upon 
leadership  behaviors, and initiate meaningful conversations in service 
of organizational culture change.  
 Insight-accountability coaches  (Peterson, 2011) focus on helping 
a client identify goals related to a future desired state and a plan for 
achieving those goals. Important to this type of coaching is creating 
an accountability plan that is feasible and owned by the client. For 
example, imagine a participant who, at the conclusion of a leadership 
development program, is energized to implement her learning and 

 
CHAPTER  13 • COACHING AND ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT 
289
change her behavior. Feeling more self-possessed with action plan in 
hand, she returns to the same environment she worked in prior to the 
program. Unless her plan includes responding to the context in new 
ways, the insight  she gained in the program may quickly fade. Insight-
accountability coaches are helpful in this regard as short-term goals 
with accompanying action plans and regular meetings can support the 
learning gained in a leadership development program and enable the 
client to strategize new responses to her old context.  
 Content coaches (Peterson, 2011) are subject matter experts who 
coach individuals in a content area such as strategy or on a specific 
skill set such as executive presentation skills. An example from execu-
tive education involves ex-theatre professionals teaching leadership 
presence and storytelling to participants. At the end of a daylong 
workshop, participants stand and deliver their leadership story, with 
leadership presence, in effect, providing initial evidence that learning 
has occurred. An important consideration, however, is the extent to 
which knowledge obtained or skills mastered through content coach-
ing are transferred to the workplace, and sustained over time.  
 Development-process coaches (Peterson, 2011), in contrast to 
content coaches, are focused on facilitating learning related to indi-
vidual and organizational behavior and usually have a sequential 
coaching process that they follow, similar to OD consultants adher-
ing to phases of consulting. As noted by Peterson, “Coaches in this 
category often have backgrounds in psychology or other behavioral 
sciences, extensive consulting experience, and significant life expe-
rience dealing with people and their development” (p. 530). These 
characteristics are noted because development-process coaching has 
a broader mandate than a specific content area or skill set, which is 
usually best served by coaches with more experience.  
 Similar to Peterson’s typology, Witherspoon and White (1996) 
conceptualized executive coaching by differentiating four agendas: 
coaching for skills to develop competence in relation to a specific job 
(content), coaching for performance to enhance and increase an exec-
utive’s functioning in her or his current role (insight-accountability), 
coaching for development in which learning is focused on a future role 
(development-process), and coaching for an executive’s agenda—for 
example, achieving better work-life balance or increasing emotional 
intelligence.  

290 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 More recently, Witherspoon (2014) introduced double loop 
coaching (DLC), which applies the Argyris & Schön (1978) con-
cept of double loop learning to coaching. As discussed in  Chapter 
 12 , “The Organization Development Consultant,” double loop learn-
ing is foundational to reflective practice (Schön, 1983) and serves the 
same function in coaching; it is a framework for learning from expe-
rience. Witherspoon differentiates DLC from single loop coaching 
that focuses solely on coaching for performance to achieve results. He 
states, “In contrast, double-loop coaching requires leaders to reflect 
critically on their thinking, assess their reactions and their frame of 
reference (which may inadvertently contribute  to problems), and 
then consider change” (p. 262). Given its roots in reflective practice, 
it seems likely that double loop coaching will be integrated into OD 
practice as well as a stand-alone framework for coaching and leader 
development.   
 Coaching Process  
 Having reviewed different types of coaching, we now discuss the 
coaching process. Many coaching models emphasize steps or phases 
similar to action research: entry and contracting; data collection and 
feedback; action planning; implementation and follow-through; eval-
uation, including debriefing and termination of the contract or recy-
cling through the phases.  
 O’Neill’s (2007) four-step process is useful, because in addition 
to emphasizing a primary task for each phase, a set of core principles 
guide executive coaching. The principles are coaching with  backbone 
and heart. Backbone  is about saying what your position is, whether it 
is popular or not, and  heart  is about staying in relationship and reach-
ing out even when the relationship is in conflict. Given that difficul-
ties in interpersonal relationships are often the catalyst for coaching, 
experiencing  backbone and heart in the coaching relationship has 
the potential to transform relationships for the client outside of the 
coaching relationship.  
 These principles are evident in the four phases of coaching:  con-
tracting, planning, live action coaching, and  debriefing. The primary 

 
CHAPTER  13 • COACHING AND ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT 
291
task in  contracting is to find a way to be a partner and establish a 
working alliance. It is the most important phase as it defines what the 
coach and client are going to do and how they are going to do it. It is 
also the most delicate as questions abound for both coach and client 
regarding what it will be like to work together.  
 Planning involves interacting with the client as a partner while 
keeping the client as owner of the issue. At its core, coaching is a help-
ing relationship and helping involves facilitating and supporting a cli-
ent owning his or her concerns. If the coach facilitates ownership by 
the client at the outset, ownership will likely continue with the client 
collaborating as an owner of the coaching process as well as owner-
ship of the solution.  
 Live action coaching involves making use of the here and now 
and requires that the coach have expertise in using self-as-instrument 
( Chapter  12 ). O’Neill refers to the task of live action coaching as: 
“Strike while the iron is hot. Live action coaching is more like impro-
vised jazz than a choreographed dance. You intervene in unexpected 
yet useful ways to help your client achieve his goal in the session” 
(p. 175). Live action coaching, then, is similar to consulting to a loosely 
coupled system ( Chapter  10 , “Understanding and Changing Loosely 
Coupled Systems”) in which improvisation is also required.  
 Live action coaching often occurs when shadowing a client, 
for example, attending a meeting in a client’s workplace and while 
observing him or her in action, the coach shares an observation with 
the expressed purpose of increasing awareness in the moment, shift-
ing the dynamics at play, and facilitating behavior change. Live action 
coaching also occurs in the work between coach and client absent 
observers. More than any other phase, live action coaching requires 
trust as coach and client are working in the here and now in which the 
next moment in time is unknown (Kagan, 1984).  
 Debriefing focuses on reviewing what occurred during the coach-
ing engagement and specifically what was learned, about the client 
individually and about the environment in which the client is work-
ing. This phase is akin to reflective practice, specifically reflection-
on-action ( Chapter  12 ). As such, identifying what was learned and 
how the learning will be carried forward is what makes coaching 
sustainable.   

292 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Coaching Roles and Contexts  
 Having defined coaching, differentiated it from other helping 
relationships, and identified types of coaching and coaching pro-
cesses, we now discuss coaching roles and contexts. We consider 
three roles: coach as one function within the broader role of OD 
consultant, coach as one function within the broader role of internal 
consultant, and external coach. Regarding context, we discuss coach-
ing as an individual level intervention inside an organizational system 
and as a system level intervention in which the focus is on creating a 
coaching culture.  
 OD Consultant as Coach  
 As one component of an OD consultant’s role, coaching occurs 
within the boundaries of an OD consultation as an intervention 
employed to support accomplishment of the overall objectives. Thus, 
consultants and practitioners must have the skills needed to coach 
individuals, work pairs, and teams. While coaching may not be part 
of the formal, explicit contract with an OD client, it is expected that 
coaching will be required as the change process unfolds. Given the 
complexity of organization change, the nature of resistance, the like-
lihood of unintended consequences and subsequent adaptations, 
coaching as a component of an OD engagement is often necessary. 
Furthermore, the aims of coaching are consistent with those of OD. 
Whitmore (2009) defines coaching as, “...unlocking people’s poten-
tial to maximize their own performance. It is helping them to learn 
rather than teaching them” (p. 10). This view of coaching, focused on 
helping an individual to learn, is similar to OD as a process of helping 
organizations learn, and more specifically, learn how to change.  
 Schein, originator of process consultation (1987; 1988; 1999; 
 Chapters  3 and  12 , “Where Did Organization Development Come 
From?” and “The Organization Development Consultant,” respec-
tively), defines coaching as: “a set of behaviors on the part of the coach 
(consultant) that helps the client to develop a new way of seeing, feel-
ing about, and behaving in situations that are defined by the client 
as problematic” (2000, p. 19). He continues by stating that he sees 

 
CHAPTER  13 • COACHING AND ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT 
293
coaching as a “subset of consultation and believes the coach should 
have the ability to move easily between the roles of process consul-
tant, content expert, and diagnostician/prescriber” (2000,  p. 17).  
 We agree with Schein and offer an example that illustrates the 
use of coaching within a consulting project. As part of an OD engage-
ment, I (Noumair) coached the leader of an organization as it became 
apparent that she needed to further develop her emotional intelli-
gence. Rather than only trusting her head, she needed to also intuit 
the feelings of her team and to lead in ways that would foster greater 
engagement. Rather than taking an authoritarian stance, she needed 
to invite participation. Changes in her behavior occurred as a result 
of coaching her in the context of the OD work;  it became clear to her 
that if she wanted to lead a culture change, she would have to behave 
differently. The behavior that was required was not her natural incli-
nation; it required greater emotional intelligence (Goleman, Boyatzis, 
& McKee, 2002); that is, more self-awareness and social awareness 
and a greater capacity for self-management and relationship manage-
ment. Coaching was an iterative process that occurred simultaneous 
to the OD work and because it was concurrent, the leader was able 
to see the impact of her new behavior on her colleagues as well as the 
organizational culture change that was in progress. As  described by 
Schein, I was able to shift roles throughout the engagement, some-
times acting as coach, other times as process consultant, and, less 
frequently, as diagnostician/prescriber. Although coaching was emer-
gent and required contracting midstream, it was no less integral to 
accomplishing the objectives of the OD engagement.  
 Coaching is also a component of OD when creating a new culture 
is the goal and leadership development is the primary strategy; for 
example, with a merger of two organizations. In such cases, organiza-
tions may develop a leadership development program designed for 
their senior most executives as a means of bringing together key pow-
erbrokers of the organization with the intent of increasing buy-in with 
the new direction. The CEO and senior team usually lead the pro-
gram, creating opportunities for the delivery of key messages regard-
ing the organization’s future and opportunities for dialogue among 
senior executives. In addition, assessment-anchored coaching may  be 
used to support individual leadership development of participants. 

294 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
Coaches are engaged to work with participants to understand their 
assessment results and to facilitate the alignment of individual devel-
opment goals with organization development goals.  
 Both internal and external coaches support OD initiatives by 
coaching in such leadership development programs.  
 Internal Coach  
 Coaching is an individual-level intervention conducted by inter-
nal practitioners within organizations, usually situated in Human 
Resources, Organization Development, and Learning and Develop-
ment functions. The most common aims of internal coaching are to 
support leadership development and improve or enhance individual 
and organizational performance. As noted by Frisch (2001), although 
some professionals in the functions noted above would say that coach-
ing has always been part of their role, internal coaching as a recog-
nized function inside organizations has gained more recognition in 
tandem with the rapid growth of executive coaching. Frisch provides 
the following definition:  
 Internal coaching is a one-on-one developmental intervention 
supported by the organization and provided by a colleague of 
those coached who is trusted to shape and deliver a program 
yielding individual professional growth. From the standpoint 
of setting standards, however, there are several implications 
of this definition that should be made explicit. Internal coach-
es should be outside the usual chain of command of those 
they coach, to differentiate it from the job coaching that all 
effective managers do. Also, whereas external coaches usu-
ally use a standardized assessment at the beginning of coach-
ing applicable to a wide range of situations, internal coaches 
can often be more flexible. They will know extensive back-
ground information about the situation and have access to the 
results of organizational processes, such as performance ap-
praisals and multi-rater feedback surveys. They can therefore 
shape an assessment that targets the key development issues 
without overmeasuring. Finally, derived from both the im-
portance of a trusted relationship and the presence of a 

 
CHAPTER  13 • COACHING AND ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT 
295
development plan, multiple coaching meetings are assumed. 
A single chat may be interesting and useful but should not be 
defined as a coaching relationship (p. 242).  
 Frisch’s definition of internal coaching reveals that the advan-
tages of internal coaching are also the disadvantages. Having familiar-
ity with the context in which a client works can be a benefit as one has 
knowledge of the organization, its position in the external environ-
ment, mission and strategy, leadership, and culture as well as infor-
mation and perceptions of the client and the client’s reputation; it can 
facilitate the work because much is already known. However, for this 
knowledge to truly be an advantage, the coach and client must explore 
the client’s perceptions of the organization and the situation and not 
assume that because they both work in the same organization, they 
actually work in the  same organization. Although it might seem like an 
obvious best practice, internal coaches must overcome the perception 
that because they are internal they have a biased point of view about 
the organization and about the internal client.  
 One difference between internal and external coaches is that 
external coaches are immediately perceived as credible because they 
are external and therefore not viewed as “contaminated” by being a 
member of the same organization.  
 Another difference between internal and external coaches is that 
internal coaches have relationships that may interfere with the task of 
coaching. As aptly stated by Hunt and Weintraub (2006), “The inter-
nal coach does...face a political landscape slightly different from that 
of the external coach. Presumably with more at stake, it may be dif-
ficult for the internal coach to ‘speak truth to power’” (p. 20).  
 We have found that partnerships between externals and internals, 
similar to partnerships between internal and external consultants, 
may be best for the client and for the organization as the combina-
tion of insider knowledge with an outsider perspective leverages the 
positionality of each role in relation to the client and the organiza-
tion. Such partnerships, however, are expensive and therefore more 
likely to be implemented solely for senior executives and organization 
leaders.   

296 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 External Coach  
 Similar to internal coaching, organizations hire external coaches 
to work with executives to support their leadership development 
and improve or enhance performance. However, some organiza-
tions employ external coaches as a last-ditch effort before exiting 
an employee or as a way to outsource difficult conversations regard-
ing development feedback that ought to be part of a manager’s role. 
External coaches are also engaged in service of complex and compli-
cated political issues because they are external, and therefore not part 
of the organizational hierarchy and political landscape. It is precisely 
because they are not part of the ongoing organization that external 
coaches have  more freedom to discuss the “undiscussable”; their out-
sider status serves the individual and the organization. As executives 
advance and their power and authority increase, their colleagues are 
less likely to tell them the truth (Peltier, 2010); in these cases, the 
value of an inner circle to offer a third opinion (Joni, 2004) or an 
external coach increases as well.  
 An example of how external coaches may be used in service of a 
manager’s or organization’s agenda is a case in which I (Noumair) was 
in the process of being hired by an organization to coach someone 
whom I had coached in a leadership development program sponsored 
by the company. I was informed that before I was hired, my potential 
client’s manager wanted to have a “chemistry” conversation with me, 
which I assumed meant that the manager wanted to vet me. After 
speaking to the manager for some time, he began to close the conver-
sation and I noted my surprise that I thought he had wanted to vet me 
and we did not seem to engage in that process. He said that vetting 
was not the intention. Instead, he wanted to give me his view of the 
issues with my potential client before I was actually hired as a coach 
because once in the role of his direct report’s coach, I would have a 
different relationship with him as my client’s manager. He was explicit 
that he wanted to have his say before we were in a formal, contractual 
relationship in which he knew that the working agreements would 
dictate  a different discourse between us. He said that after the coach-
ing engagement ended he would talk with me, offline, and I could tell 
him if he was “right.” The conversation provided me with a plethora 

 
CHAPTER  13 • COACHING AND ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT 
297
of data about my client’s manager, the relationship between my cli-
ent and his manager, and the culture of the organization. I learned 
that communication is largely indirect, difficult feedback is given by a 
coach rather than a manager, and that being “right” is very important, 
and perhaps more so, than resolving conflict. Understanding these 
dynamics enabled me to enter the coaching engagement with a more 
informed sense of the manager’s expectations, his views of my client, 
and what work was necessary if we were to align my client’s goals, his 
manager’s goals, and the goals of the organization. As the coaching 
ensued, I was able to work with my client as well as with him and his 
manager as a work pair because I understood from the outset what 
the explicit, and implicit, expectations were of coaching and what role 
I, as an external coach, served for the organization.  
 While initial conversations with a client’s manager are not always 
as revealing as the one in the example, external coaching engage-
ments do involve contracting with multiple parties (usually a client, 
client’s manager, and HR professional), identifying agreed-upon 
change objectives, and negotiating boundary conditions for work. 
Each of these tasks provides an external coach with an opportunity 
to learn about the client, the client’s manager, and the HR profes-
sional, individually and collectively, and also about the culture of the 
organization.  
 In the above instance, the stated reason I was hired as an external 
coach was to support my client’s leadership development and increase 
his performance. However, it was also the case that the difficult feed-
back regarding his performance was outsourced to me rather than 
addressed by his manager. Given the culture of polite conversation, 
indirect feedback, and the importance of being right rather than 
resolving conflict, an external coach was viewed as the appropriate 
intervention. As I came to understand these issues, I explored them 
with my client and his manager and at that point, I no longer felt as 
if I was in collusion with my client’s manager. I felt I could use my 
external position as leverage for accomplishing individual and organi-
zational objectives.    

298 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Coaching Culture  
 Coaching is also a system intervention in which an organization 
develops a coaching culture. Organizations create coaching cultures 
as part of overall culture change initiatives, which is the primary pur-
pose of OD. Rather than utilizing coaching as a stand-alone inter-
vention, coaching is intentionally integrated into the fabric of the 
organization; that is, into “how we do things around here” (Deal & 
Kennedy, 1982). In such cases, coaching can help ensure that actual 
organizational behavior is assessed against espoused behavior (Argyris 
& Schön, 1974).  
 Several definitions of coaching culture exist in the literature. Clut-
terbuck and Meggison (2005) define a coaching culture as, “Coach-
ing is the predominant style of managing and working together, and 
where a commitment to grow the organization is embedded in a par-
allel commitment to grow the people in the organization” (p. 19). 
Meggison and Clutterbuck (2006) offer six dimensions of a coaching 
culture, which can be assessed over time with the intent of answer-
ing the question: “To what extent is your organization as a whole (or 
the part of it you are interested in) moving to integrate coaching into 
its deep  processes of performance and renewal?” (p. 233). The six 
dimensions are: “1. Coaching linked to business drivers. 2. Being 
a coachee is encouraged and supported. 3. Provide coach training. 
4. Reward and recognize coaching. 5. Systemic perspective. 6. The 
move to coaching is managed” (p. 233).  
 For Hunt and Weintraub (2006), “A coaching organization makes 
effective and regular use of coaching as a means of promoting both 
individual development and organization learning in the service of the 
organization’s larger goals” (p. 15). In such a coaching culture (Hunt & 
Weintraub, 2006), everyone in the organization believes that learning 
is critical to individual and organizational success. Decision making is 
developed closest to those who implement the decisions and individu-
als are given freedom to take risks and set their own goals. Having a 
mentor or a coach is viewed positively, and people are encouraged to 
seek mentoring or  coaching support at various stages in their career 
and for various reasons. Leaders of the organization use a nondirec-
tive leadership style; that is, they use a similar coaching style with 
direct reports as they use with peers. Developing others and creating 

 
CHAPTER  13 • COACHING AND ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT 
299
a learning environment are major responsibilities of managers. In this 
environment, peers coach one another to share knowledge, to pass on 
expertise to help one another, and also to raise their own standards 
and general standards of professionalism.  
 Both descriptions of coaching cultures are consistent with OD 
and are offered here as a means of conceptualizing coaching as a 
system-level intervention as OD practitioners must be able to intervene 
across multiple levels within the same organization. An example is an 
OD engagement that began by my (Noumair) working with the senior 
team and ended by my working with the whole organization to create 
a coaching culture. In that organization, the idea for creating a coach-
ing culture emerged from trying to increase the level of engagement of 
employees with lower rank and less tenure. Rather than an organiza-
tional culture depicted by a lack of psychological safety in which there 
was fear and anxiety about speaking in public, the ideal culture for this 
organization would be more relaxed and encouraging of spontaneous 
contributions; employees would freely share their ideas. Colleagues 
would support one another’s work by offering information, expertise, 
and learning from past experience. A learning orientation, as opposed 
to a performance orientation, would be the modus operandi. Through-
out the organization, learning would occur in peer relationships as 
often as in hierarchical relationships, the quality of strategic thinking 
and dialogue would be enhanced, and ultimately, individual, team, 
and organizational performance would improve. 
 In order to work toward the ideal state as depicted above, the 
organization engaged in a combination of strategies and practices 
discussed by Meggison and Clutterbuck (2006) and Hunt and Wein-
traub (2006). Additionally, this was an organization already using 
the Burke-Litwin model (1992) to guide the overall culture change 
and the decision to create a coaching culture easily mapped onto the 
model. First, the senior team decided that creating a coaching culture 
would support the overall culture change that was already in process; 
that is, alignment of the transformational boxes of the Burke-Litwin 
model. Having made the decision, the first  step was to invest in train-
ing the entire staff in coaching. Once all members of the organization 
were learning new skills together, they spontaneously began to prac-
tice coaching with each other. By learning together, the climate began 
to shift toward more openness and participation; staff appeared to 

300 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
have more energy. These levers for change comprise the spine of the 
Burke-Litwin model, the center boxes aligned vertically: leadership, 
management practices, work unit climate, motivation, and individual 
and organizational performance.  
 As this organization continued on its journey toward creating a 
coaching culture, it used learning together as one means to accom-
plish their culture change objectives. Similar to Hunt and Weintraub 
(2006), they intentionally linked individual development and orga-
nizational learning to the organization’s performance, and similar to 
Meggison and Clutterbuck (2006), they implemented four of the six 
dimensions of a coaching culture; that is, encouraging and supporting 
coaching, providing coach training, embracing a systemic perspec-
tive, and managing coaching. It is significant that the two dimensions 
that were lagging behind the others were linking coaching to busi-
ness drivers and recognizing and rewarding  coaching. Although not 
simple, and certainly not linear in positive growth, the steps they did 
take enabled them to recover more easily when they did revert to old 
behaviors that slowed their progress toward their “ideal” state.  
 Point of View  
 First and foremost, we adhere to the Lewin formula (1951), 
Bf P/E: Behavior is a function of the interaction between a person and 
his or her perceived environment. Although the coaching conversa-
tion may be a dialogue between two individuals, other people as well 
as contextual factors are also present in the minds of the coach and cli-
ent. For this reason, we contract for collecting data through the use of 
assessments and we view assessment results as data about the “person”  
component of the Lewin formula (Burke & Noumair, 2002). Self-
ratings on a multi-rater feedback assessment are one source of data of 
an individual’s perception of her/himself in the environment. Multi-
rater feedback contributes to an environmental perspective by provid-
ing data on how those in his or her surroundings perceive an individual; 
for example, manager, peers, direct reports, and customers/clients.  
 Analyzing the environment means applying a systems perspec-
tive in which the focus of coaching is a person in an organizational 
role inside an organizational system. A systems perspective includes 

 
CHAPTER  13 • COACHING AND ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT 
301
the conceptual framework introduced in  Chapter  8 , “Understanding 
Organizations: Covert Processes,” which combines the use of group 
relations (psychodynamic theory, a group-as-a-whole level of analysis, 
and social-structural concepts) with OD frameworks and concepts. 
Including “Beneath the Surface of the Burke-Litwin Model” allows 
access to covert processes, as important in coaching as in OD work. 
The focus on perceptions of the environment and covert processes 
requires that a coach, similar to an OD consultant, maintain a well-
tuned self-as-instrument. This conceptual framework creates space 
for considering the links between emotional processes, group devel-
opment, and organizational behavior.  
 Holding a systems perspective allows a client to consider the 
impact of environmental forces, both overt and covert, and as a 
result removes some pressure from an individual shouldering all of 
the responsibility for a situation, problem, or challenge. First, tak-
ing the context into account usually changes the kinds of questions 
that are asked; questions shift from why a situation occurred to how 
it occurred. Second, when feedback is focused more on role rather 
than on person, it provokes less defensiveness. It allows unconscious 
and covert processes to surface and become more conscious and 
overt. Third, as a result, once systemic factors are understood and 
responsibility is shared, individuals are usually more able to own their 
contribution to the situation, problem, or challenge. Finally, by con-
sidering patterns of behavior across contexts, clients learn what part 
of any given situation, problem, or challenge is about the person and 
what part is about the context. In this way, clients, too, come to hold 
a Lewinian perspective, which contributes to making their learning 
more sustainable.  
 The following example helps to illuminate our approach to 
coaching. A woman underrated herself on 50 percent of items on a 
multi-rater feedback survey and rather than employ an intrapersonal 
explanation such as low self-esteem or being excessively self-critical 
(common explanations for underrating), she stated that her ratings 
reflected the fact that she was hired to lead change in the organization 
and the organization was change-resistant. Thus, she evaluated her-
self against her charge and found herself wanting. She perceived her 
ratings as an accurate evaluation of her performance. Interestingly, 
her raters, in the same environment, did not view her performance  as 

302 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
about her as an individual. Instead, they viewed her performance as 
about the context, stating that regardless of who was hired as a change 
agent, they (the organization) would have undermined the change 
efforts. Realizing that she and her colleagues perceived the same situ-
ation differently enabled her to consider further her behavior in con-
text. Viewing what occurred through the lens of person-role-system, 
she realized that she overemphasized her person and underempha-
sized her role and the system. As a result, she was able to reengage 
and experiment with new ways of leading change. Although certainly 
not easy nor fast, eventually  she was able to accomplish some of the 
initial goals related to the desired change.  
 Moreover, she reflected on her longstanding pattern of behavior 
in which she realized that she usually takes more responsibility than is 
hers for a given situation, problem, or challenge. This insight enabled 
her to understand how she underrated herself on the multi-rater 
feedback assessment and essentially was blind to the systemic forces 
that also contributed to her performance. Rather than continue to act 
as if she, alone, were responsible for the stalled change initiative, she 
understood the context more deeply and her change leadership was 
reinvigorated. This example points to the importance of considering 
the interaction between the person and  his or her  perceived environ-
ment as well as holding a systems perspective.  
 Conclusion  
 Throughout this chapter, we have discussed coaching within the 
domain of OD, as one role that comprises the identity of an OD con-
sultant, as well as a role with its own professional identity, that of 
internal coach and external coach. To be effective, both groups of 
professionals require knowledge, skills, and abilities of OD and of 
coaching. However, the roles have different emphases and, therefore, 
some variation in requisite preparation.  
 The set of abilities for OD consultants, and the courses listed 
under academic training in  Chapter  12 , represent what we believe 
are foundational for OD consulting and serve as background for 
coaching. Developing expertise in self-as-instrument and reflective 
practice, both essential to the repertoire of effective coaches, are also 
covered in  Chapter   12   .  

 
CHAPTER  13 • COACHING AND ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT 
303
 In addition, the following abilities, knowledge, and skills are 
required for coaches and recommended for OD consultants invested 
in developing further the role of coach:  
 
•  Knowledge of coaching process,  how to create a coaching part-
nership, collect data, make sense of it and feed it back, engage 
in coaching conversations, and build commitment for action 
planning.   
 
•  Skills in person-centered approach to coaching,  including con-
gruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathetic under-
standing. These skills are considered core competencies that 
are foundational across theories, approaches, and models, and 
are essential for establishing a working alliance and for the 
management of resistance to coaching.  
 
•  Theory related to a coaching-specific theoretical orientation, 
to serve as a guiding framework for coaching beyond core 
competencies.   
 
•  Awareness of coaching models in general, as well as a specific 
model of coaching to guide theory in use;  for example, a model 
that is available in the academic or business literature, one that 
is an extension of a theoretical orientation, or one that is eclec-
tic. At its core, a model should include a theoretical perspec-
tive on how individuals change, and also, how individuals resist 
change.   
 
•  Individual interviewing skills are needed to collect data from 
clients and key stakeholders.  
 
•  Knowledge of assessments, including psychometrics and inter-
pretation, and specific instruments,  such as multi-rater feed-
back, personality, emotional intelligence, learning styles, 
learning agility, interpersonal relations, communication prefer-
ences, conflict style, and cultural awareness.  
 
•  Familiarity with organizational models to assess context and 
provide a systemic perspective for individual coaching.  
 
•  Skills for working with diverse clients  including awareness of 
one’s own social identity and understanding the impact of social 
identity on the interaction between the client and his or her 
environment and on the interaction between the client and 
coach.   

304 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 
•  Ability to surface “undiscussables” and “speak truth to power,” 
the bounded role of coach permits conversations to occur out-
side formal organizational authority structures and supports 
moving work forward.  
 
•  Understanding the importance of the interdependence among 
individual, group, and organizational levels for coaching indi-
viduals, including the conceptual framework that combines 
group relations and organization development discussed in 
 Chapter  8 . 
 Multiple avenues exist for gaining knowledge in these content 
areas, developing abilities and skills, and pursuing coach training. 
One of the challenges in selecting a path for coach training, however, 
is the current state of the field: There is no agreed-upon definition of 
coaching, no entry-level criteria, multiple professional organizations 
offering credentialing, and much needed research to claim evidence-
based coaching. Thus, we offer three recommendations we view as 
necessary but not sufficient for developing coaching competencies:  
 
•  Participate in a training model known as Interpersonal Pro-
cess Recall (IPR) (Kagan, 1984). IPR provides opportunities 
to engage in videotaped coaching conversations followed by 
debriefing with the coach, client, and “inquirer.” The role of 
inquirer is to facilitate the recall of the coaching conversation 
by asking exploratory, open-ended, nonjudgmental questions of 
the coach and client. While watching the videotape, the coach 
and client recall their experience by exploring thoughts and 
feelings that were unsaid during the coaching conversation; that 
is, what was covert but nonetheless influencing the interaction 
between them. In addition to learning in the roles of coach and 
client, practicing the role of inquirer, and facilitating “learning 
by discovery” of the coach and client, the inquirer furthers his 
or her development as a coach.  
 
  Schein corroborates the importance of internalizing the role 
of inquirer as an essential component of coach training in his 
book,  Humble Inquiry (2013a): “Humble inquiry is the skill 
and art of drawing someone out, of asking questions to which 
you do not already know the answer, of building a relationship 

 
CHAPTER  13 • COACHING AND ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT 
305
based on curiosity and interest in the other person” (p. 21). By 
learning how to take the role of inquirer in IPR, one learns how 
to put “humble inquiry” into practice. The skills of the inquirer, 
and of humble inquiry, build trust and promote open commu-
nication and collaboration, which are essential  for developing 
effective coaching relationships. For more on IPR, see Kagan 
(1984).   
 
•  Develop a coaching model that includes the purpose of coach-
ing, the coaching process, theory/theories that undergird the 
model, key elements of the coaching relationship, skills needed, 
coach’s style based on knowledge of self-as-instrument, how the 
coach will work with people whose styles are different, and eth-
ical guidelines that guide the coaching model. Model develop-
ment is akin to identifying one’s point of view on coaching and 
even if a coach decides to use a model already in existence, it 
is imperative that the coach be aware of why he or she selected 
the model and how it is reflective of the  coach’s point of view. 
For more on developing a coaching model, see Lennard (2010). 
 
•  Coaching engagements in organizations often involve leader-
ship development, and thus, it is helpful for coaches to have 
led an enterprise of any kind, regardless of size or type, as it 
provides the coach with a lived experience of what it takes to 
motivate others to work on one’s behalf and to align others in 
service of a shared task.  
 In keeping with our conviction that coaching requires knowledge 
of organizational development as well as of individual coaching, those 
wishing to pursue training in coaching ideally should seek out pro-
grams that locate coaching within the domain of OD. In so doing, the 
coach will be organizationally knowledgeable and individually knowl-
edgeable, which in our view is requisite for effective coaching.

 Organization Development 
and the Future  
 With the publication of this third edition of our book devoted to 
an explanation and examination of a field that is now some 56 years of 
age, organization development (OD) is well beyond adolescence. 
Considering all of the criticism thrown at OD regarding its relevance, 
squishiness, growing departure from its scholarly and value-based 
roots, and lack of innovation in recent times (Burke, 2011a), it is a 
wonder that the field remains in existence. For example, in the book 
coedited by Bradford and Burke (2005), a critique of OD, a chapter 
by Jerry Harvey is entitled “The Future of OD, or  Why Don’t They 
Take the Tubes Out of Grandma?” Grandma seems to have survived. 
And there are now grandchildren active in the field. But problems 
remain, a serious one being the departure of OD as practiced today 
from its scholarly roots (Bartunek, 2014).  
 The dual purpose of this final chapter, therefore, is first to pro-
vide a quick summary of the final chapter in the second edition and 
then to move on to thoughts regarding the future and where OD 
needs to go developmentally to ensure relevance and organization 
change expertise.  
 Summary of the Final Chapter in the Second 
Edition  
 In the second edition, the final chapter was entitled “New Dimen-
sions of Organization Development.” Noteworthy was the observa-
tion that the term  culture was a widely accepted concept at the time 
compared with the 1970s and early ‘80s. In other words, executives 

308 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
and managers in the early 1990s, and especially today, readily talk 
about their organization’s culture and often use the term before the 
OD practitioner does. It is not clear if many executives and managers 
believe that organizational culture can be changed, but they are usu-
ally willing to discuss the matter.  
 A second observation at the time was that health-care organiza-
tions were beginning to explore OD possibilities as never before. That 
trend has lasted and today many health-care systems work with OD 
practitioners. Also, the delivery of OD in 1994 was expanding beyond 
the human resource function as the exclusive source of expertise. 
Information technology people began to explore OD as a possible tool 
in their toolkits. That trend has also continued.  
 The bulk of the relatively short final chapter in the second edition 
focused on the question of whether OD should be no more than a 
facilitative, contingent process or normative; for example, advocat-
ing a cultural change that would help to humanize the organization 
and advise that certain values, if lived, would improve organizational 
effectiveness such as operating in teams with considerable employee 
participation and engagement rather than managing individuals in 
a command-and-control manner. For empirical support regarding 
this advocacy statement, see the study by McClelland and Burnham 
(1976).  
 To see what some of the primary ingredients of an organization’s 
culture advocated by an OD consultant with a normative perspec-
tive might look like, see the list of nine provided by Burke (1994) 
in that last chapter (p.197), for example, “Members feel a sense of 
ownership of the organization’s mission and objectives” and “Conflict 
is dealt with openly and systematically, rather than ignored, avoided, 
or handled in a typical win-lose fashion.” Beckhard’s (1969) list of ten 
were perhaps less value-laden than Burke’s, but similar nevertheless; 
for example, two of his were “Decisions are made by and near the 
sources of information, regardless of where these sources are located 
on the organizational chart,” and “There is high conflict (clash of 
ideas) about tasks and projects and relatively little energy spent in 
clashing over  interpersonal difficulties, because they generally have 
been worked through” (pp. 10–11).  

 
CHAPTER  14 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT AND THE FUTURE

 These lists from Burke and Beckhard were drawn from their 
experiences as OD consultants and from personal beliefs and view-
points. Not covered in the second edition, but highly related to goals 
for an organization’s culture that could also be considered normative 
and in any case described as  adaptive, is the work of Kotter and Hes-
kett (1992). They were probably the first researchers to show a clear 
relationship between organizational culture and performance. They 
began with consideration of more than 200 companies and in the end 
selected 10 that had made a successful culture change. Among the 10 
were British Airways, General  Electric, Imperial Chemicals Indus-
try, ConAgra, and Scandinavian Airlines Systems. These final 10 were 
companies that had the best record of performance and the capacity 
to make changes when needed. What these organizations had in com-
mon was what Kotter and Heskett called an  adaptive culture. The 
following list describes the 11 characteristics of an adaptive culture 
according to the work of Kotter and Heskett (1992) and for our pur-
poses serves as a possible norm and a set of goals for culture change:  
  
1.  Willingness to make changes in culturally ingrained behaviors 
  
2.  Emphasis on identifying problems before they occur and rap-
idly implementing workable solutions  
  
3.  Focus on innovation 
  
4.  Shared feelings of confidence about managing problems and 
opportunities   
  
5.  Emphasis on trust 
  
6.  Willingness to take risks 
  
7.  Spirit of enthusiasm 
  
8.  Candor 
  
9.  Internal flexibility in response to external demands 
  10.  Consistency in word and action 
  11.  Long-term focus 
 Now, what about today, 15 years into the twenty-first century?

ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Current and Future Trends in Organization 
Development  
 Organizations that last with growth and maturity tend over time 
to differentiate their operations more than they integrate them (Law-
rence & Lorsch, 1967). New and different ways of thinking about 
how to sustain whatever success the organization has realized emerge, 
such as starting a new line of business or just as often if not more so, 
acquiring an organization that will serve the same objective of new 
and different.  
 But OD is a field, not an organization. Yet similarities regard-
ing the emergence of different ideas and values exist. For example, 
Pasmore (2014) has characterized this differentiation as  three ODs. 
Answering the question of “what is OD” would depend on which of 
the three different OD practitioners you asked. The three ODs, or 
factions as Pasmore refers to them, are humanistic/altruistic, whole 
systems, and bottom line/efficiency. To give a flavor of these factions 
we consider three of his nine comparisons:

 Incidentally, we, the authors of this book about OD, see ourselves 
as  factionally dualistic —a combination of humanistic/altruistic and 
whole system.  
 Now let us consider differentiation from the perspective of 
emerging trends for the future. The first trend covered is dialogic 
OD, which represents a clear differentiation in the field of OD. The 
remaining three trends that we summarize are less differentiators and 
more concerned with new emphases at least for inclusion within the 
field of OD. They are leadership development, positive psychology, 
and agility.  
 Dialogic Organization Development  
 The primary advocates of this trend or movement in the field are 
Gervase Bushe and Robert Marshak. They have been prolific with 
their writings and publication, but we will refer primarily to their 
most recent work, an overview of what they refer to as the  dialogic 
mindset (Bushe & Marshak, 2014). They contrast this kind of mind-
set to what they label as diagnostic OD. In any case, the fundamental 
difference is that the latter approach to OD emphasizes gathering 
data as objectively as possible on the part of the OD practitioners 
with the primary objective of changing  behavior, whereas the dialogic 
approach  emphasizes communication—what people say, how they say 
it, what they espouse, and what they believe. The primary objective 
with a dialogic approach is to capture the “generative image” of what 
organizational members talk about, what picture of the organization 
they generate via discussion, which constitutes a mind-set. The target 
of change is the mind-set, not so much their behavior. The primary 
database for this dialogic approach is, therefore, the conversation, 
the stories organizational members relate about how the organization 
functions and why it seems to operate the way it does.  

312 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 What is not new here are the many examples of this approach—
dialogic. Although this approach to understanding and changing orga-
nizations may be conducted at any level—one-on-one coaching for 
example—most dialogic activities consist of large group interventions. 
What is new, then, is Bushe and Marshak’s (and others) attempts 
to conceptualize and provide theoretical ideas for making sense of 
a plethora of organizational activities that are largely based on large 
group interventions. Bushe and Marshak list 27 such interventions 
and then concentrate on 6 to illustrate their points. To give a sense of 
these activities, what follows are brief descriptions of their  6 primary 
examples:  
  
1.  Open space technology (Owen, 2008).     From one to as much as 
three days, a group convenes around an issue of common con-
cern. Participants propose topics for discussion and a schedule 
with small assignments is created. Participants are free to move 
from one small group to another—“as the spirit moves.” The 
meeting conclusion is in the total group where what has been 
learned and decided is discussed.  
  
2.  Emergent engagement (Homan, 2010).  Essentially an exten-
sion of Owen’s open space technology. Both take cues from 
complexity theory, for example, Prigogine and Stengers (1984), 
with Homan’s convenor/facilitator being a bit more directive; 
it guides her facilitation according to a three-step process—
disruption, differentiation, and coherence. The intent with dis-
ruption is to disturb the status quo followed by reorganization 
of thought, which in turn can lead to action. It is a matter of 
finding new levels of coherence.  
  
3.  Complex responsive processes of relating (Griffen, 2002; Shaw, 
2002; Stacey, 2011). According to Stacey and his associates, 
Griffen and Shaw, there is no objective reality; all reality is cre-
ated and re-created within the relationships and discussions 
among people, like Homan’s point, again based on complex-
ity theory, disruption must occur for change to be realized. As 
Stacey (2001) puts it, “...without such disruption to current pat-
terns of collaboration and power relations there could be no 
emergent novelty in communicative interaction and hence no 
novelty in any form of human action. The reason for saying this 

 
CHAPTER  14 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT AND THE FUTURE  
313
is that disruptions generate diversity. One of the central insights 
of the complexity sciences is how the  spontaneous emergence 
of novelty depends upon diversity” (p. 149).  
 
  The three preceding examples link to complexity theory, 
whereas the following three, according to Bushe and Marshak 
(2014), are what they label as  interpretive perspectives. 
  
4.  Coordinated management of meaning (Pearce & Cronen, 1980). 
Pearce and Cronen are more interested in developing people 
than producing theory. Meaning comes from the interactions of 
people. Four fundamental questions guide their interventions: 
(1) What are we making together? (2) How are we making it? 
(3) What are we becoming? (4) How do we make better social 
worlds? These questions guide the conversations among people 
and talk is a form of action, not a substitute for it. Their process 
as consultants/practitioners is one of “mapping” the episodes 
that occur as people engage one another. These maps can lead 
to further interventions and actions.  
  
5.  Organization discourse (Grant & Oswick, 1996; Grant & Mar-
shak, 2011). The interpretive perspectives for this approach 
to dialogic OD are metaphor and story lines. The consultant 
listens carefully to what clients say, especially the stories they 
tell and the metaphors they use. The consultants develop ideas, 
hunches about the meaning of the client’s language and stories, 
and then provide feedback to the client based on these hunches 
as well as suggestions for modifying current assumptions and 
thinking.   
  
6.  Appreciative inquiry (Cooperrider & Srivastva, 1987; Bar-
rett & Cooperrider, 1990; Cooperrider, Whitney, & Stavros, 
2008). Appreciative inquiry (AI) is a significant example of the 
positive psychology movement, both having emerged at about 
the same time in the mid-1980s. AI is also another example of 
discourse and narrative as processes for organizational change. 
Moreover, these dialogues, which emphasize strengths, usually 
occur in a large group setting (Cooperrider, 2012). AI sessions 
often last up to four days and follow four phases: Discovery, 
dream, design, and destiny/deployment, a set of processes that 
are similar to the Open Space Technology approach (Owen, 
2008). AI emphasizes the emergent nature of change rather 

314 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
than the standard OD approach; for example, the  seven steps 
of consultation—entry, contracting, data gathering, and so on. 
(Cooperrider, Whitney, & Stavros, 2008).  
 In summary regarding dialogic OD, Bushe and Marshak’s (2014) 
contribution comes from their extensive accumulation of interven-
tions based largely on dialogue and generative imagery. In other 
words, their propositions concerning dialogic OD are based on a 
set of organization change theory and methodologies usually associ-
ated with large group activities. The common denominator for these 
methods and interventions is discourse, that is, paying attention to the 
characteristics and nature of dialogue, what people say and how they 
say it, for example, with a metaphor. Dialogic OD represents a dif-
ferentiation within the larger field of organization development and 
change. A fair question  to ask is why such differentiation?  
 One reason is Bushe and Marshak’s attempt to explain the pro-
liferation of certain methods that promote organization change but 
do not follow the “regular” steps of OD, unfreeze, change, refreeze. 
Finding similarities and consistencies across these methods, which 
may occur via one-on-one coaching but more often in group settings, 
have encouraged these scholar-practitioners to make further sense of 
it all. Thus, dialogic OD.  
 Another reason, as Bushe and Marshak (2014) note, is the prob-
lem with organization change overall; that is, the high degree of fail-
ure. Successful organization change is less than 50 percent and may 
be as low as 30 percent. They suggest that normal OD does not exactly 
have a great track record; therefore, variations and other approaches 
are in order. They conclude their article with three propositions that 
if followed should make a difference with respect to organization 
change regardless of what specific method is used. Their propositions 
are as follows:  
  
1.   A disruption in the ongoing social construction of reality is 
stimulated or engaged in a way that leads to a more complex 
reorganization.   
  
2.  A change to one or more core narratives takes place. 
  
3.  A generative image is introduced or surfaces that provides new 
and compelling alternatives for thinking and acting.  

 
CHAPTER  14 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT AND THE FUTURE  
315
 At the risk of oversimplification, what Bushe and Marshak are 
advocating is that organization change occurs as a consequence of 
organizational members’ increased understanding of how they have 
construed their work life as manifested in the language they use and 
the stories they tell, and that this construction, a social one, may not 
be the one they want or that will lead to greater effectiveness as a 
team or organization as a whole. Reaching a different mind-set will 
then constitute the change.  
 Leadership Development  
 Family feuds are known to occur in family-owned businesses, 
but the one making the news during the summer of 2014 was most 
unusual. Market Basket, a grocery chain of 71 stores in three New 
England states, Massachusetts, Maine, and New Hampshire, was 
owned by the Demoulas family, not brothers, however, but two cous-
ins: Arthur S. Demoulas, chair of the seven-member board of direc-
tors and majority owner of the business, and Arthur T. Demoulas, 
the CEO. The dispute between the two cousins was wide-ranging 
but focused particularly on how profits were to be distributed. The 
chair, Arthur S., wanted the owners and stockholders to gain most 
from the profits, but the CEO, Arthur T., wanted the majority to be 
shared among the employees. In any case, the feuding cousins could 
not come to a resolution and consequently the chair, with backing 
from the board, fired his cousin, the CEO. The employees, demon-
strating fierce loyalty to Arthur T. calling him “our leader,” went on 
strike, vacating the stores and protesting in front of the stores with 
placards calling for a reinstatement of their leader. Customers joined 
the protest. Fearing financial collapse, eventually a deal was made 
for Arthur T. to purchase the  remaining stock in the company (up to 
that point, he had 49.5 percent ownership) and be reinstated as CEO. 
The dedicated employees of Market Basket had pushed the company 
to the brink, but in the end, they won the day and got their much-
beloved leader returned to the helm. Thomas Kochan, a professor 
at the Sloan School of Management at MIT, was quoted as saying 
that “employees are the most valuable asset in this business.” In other 
words, they saved the business. Professor Kochan went on to declare 

316 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
that “Market Basket has done more to educate us on how to  manage 
a business than any business case study that’s been written to date” 
(Seelye & de la Merced, 2014, p. A17). In a time of crisis, the follow-
ers became leaders.  
 To say that “Artie T,” as he is called, has loyal employees and cus-
tomers is an understatement. His employees risked losing their jobs 
and their customers joined them in the revolt. Artie T may be a “natu-
ral” leader and needs little if any development. But he is a rare breed. 
Most of us who seek or are cast into leadership positions could benefit 
from some form of development. Previous evidence has shown that 
the failure rate for people in positions of leadership ranges from 50 
to 67 percent with an overall average of at least one out of every two  
not meeting goals for the positions that they hold (Hogan, Curphy, & 
Hogan, 1994). It is likely that this failure rate is much the same today, 
which may account for, at least in part, the recent increase in leader-
ship development activities. A survey of OD practitioners compar-
ing their values and interventions in 1994 with those some 20 years 
later showed that leadership development was the top priority for OD 
practice by 2014 (Shull, Church, & Burke, 2013). Clearly the need is 
there. Moreover, Burke (2011a) has argued that leadership develop-
ment is one of four areas of “unfinished business” for OD scholars and 
practitioners (the other three being culture change, loosely coupled 
systems, and resistance). This increase regarding leadership develop-
ment is therefore good news. Yet there remain at least two areas of 
concern.  
 Many, if not most, leadership development activities currently 
consist of programs that include multi-rater feedback and other 
assessments as well as sessions that help to provide an acculturation 
for leaders and potential leaders into the organizations. These efforts 
are fine as far as they go. Receiving feedback often helps with increas-
ing one’s self-awareness and such processes can lead to enhanced per-
formance; see, for example, Atwater and Yammarino (1992), Church 
(1997), and  Chapter  14 in Burke (2014b). Few organizations conform 
to the 70-20-10 model (Burke, 2011a; McCall, 2010), however: 70 
percent of leadership development being focused on arranging for 
potential leaders to  have different and challenging job experiences, 
20 percent being activities that help the potential leader to learn from 
those experiences via reflection, coaching, and mentoring, and 10 

 
CHAPTER  14 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT AND THE FUTURE  
317
percent devoted to skill development such as public speaking. The 
next frontier, then, is getting leadership development right. Experi-
ences alone will not do it.  Learning from the experiences is the neces-
sary ingredient, the 20 percent part of the model.  
 The second concern is about the field of OD itself. Leadership 
development should be supported, for sure, but the emphasis is at the 
individual level of an organization. OD is about system change, partic-
ularly culture, at the organizational level. In other words, leadership 
development may be a distraction from OD. But it doesn’t have to 
be, provided leadership development efforts are in support of overall 
organization change; that is, to ensure that the learning for leaders 
consists of behaviors and practices that will move the organization in 
the desired change direction.  
 Positive Psychology  
 The so-called positive psychology movement emerged in the mid-
1980s. Appreciative inquiry was an early part of this emergence. Some 
15 years later, a special issue of the  American Psychologist  edited by 
Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi (2000) signaled that such a move-
ment had indeed arrived and was having an impact. Topics associated 
with such positives as optimism, courage, spirituality, hope, creativity, 
and wisdom were discussed. Psychological research had largely been 
focused on negatives, the  problem to be investigated. This predomi-
nance may still be true today, but the positive emphasis by research-
ers has gained ground. One of the reasons why emphasizing negative 
forces remains significant  is because negative findings by researchers 
in psychology have a more powerful impact on study results than is 
the case for positive findings. These more powerful findings get pub-
lished more easily; see the article by Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Finke-
nauer, and Vohs (2001).  
 Positive psychology is concerned with life-giving domains of 
interest and study rather than life-depleting ones. Life-giving behav-
iors are more naturally embraced than those focused on the negative.  
 Kim Cameron has taken the lead regarding the application of 
positive psychology to organization development and change. And 
he has done his homework. His article on the paradox of positive 

318 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
organizational change (Cameron, 2008) covers more than 160 ref-
erences. A positive approach regarding organization change means 
that the emphasis is on strengths, capabilities, and possibilities rather 
than on problems, threats, and weaknesses. The paradox that Cam-
eron addresses is that a positive approach leads to effectiveness and 
change, but a negative emphasis has more impact. A couple of exam-
ples may illustrate the paradoxical point:  
 
•  People judge positive phenomena more accurately than nega-
tive phenomena; for example, managers are more accurate in 
rating subordinates’ competencies and proficiencies when they 
perform correctly than when they perform incorrectly. Yet 
people pay more attention to negative feedback than positive 
feedback.   
 
•  A positive event is remembered more accurately and longer, 
but a negative event has more effect on immediate memory and 
salience in the short run.  
 So Cameron (2008) concludes that both positive and negative 
reactions are evolutionarily adaptive but function in different ways; 
that is, negative reactions are typically more intense. Most life events 
are positive, at least for most of us, and therefore negative events are 
more unique. Cameron puts it this way:  
 Just as movement in a still room attracts attention, so negative 
(novel) events capture more attention than positive (normal) 
patterns. Furthermore, negative events often indicate maladap-
tation and a need to change, (and) one single negative thing can 
cause a system to fail, but one single positive thing cannot guar-
antee success (2008, p.15).  
 We have three final points regarding this trend of positive psy-
chology. First, it seems clear that both positive and negative effects 
are, or at least can be, significant aspects of organizational change. 
The negative aspect may be a strong need to change due to, say, a 
competitor’s superior strategy and tactics in the marketplace, and the 
positive aspect might be a new and inspiring vision for the future. 
Second, it also seems clear that to accentuate the positive over the 
negative requires extra effort and commitment. Thus, change leaders 
must be willing to “stay the course” when it comes to,  say, concentrat-
ing on strengths of the organization, rewarding people who champion 

 
CHAPTER  14 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT AND THE FUTURE  
319
change, and when negative outcomes occur with change implementa-
tion, which are typical, change leaders must move quickly to fix the 
implementation problem, for example, a computer software glitch, so 
that ultimately the negative does not overpower the positive, thus not 
allowing the effects of positive change tactics to be realized.  
 And, finally, the third point concerns research evidence regarding 
positive organizational change. In a study of highly effective teach-
ers in K-12 public schools, Quinn, Heynoski, Thomas, and Spreitzer 
(2014) found that the use of positive approaches in helping students 
to learn was the predominant mode of interaction between teacher 
and student. These researchers also drew parallels between facili-
tating learning and leadership. In these cases of highly effective 
teachers, the positive outweighed the negative. Thus, these research-
ers concluded that this imbalance of positive over negative was no 
doubt the differentiator for the highly effective teachers, and the 
same should be true  for leaders in a variety of settings. At a much 
broader level, Cameron and McNaughton (2014) provide an over-
view of research conducted in recent years on the effects of positive 
organizational change. A considerable number of studies show strong 
empirical evidence that when positive factors—compassionate sup-
port for employees, forgiving mistakes and avoiding blame, express-
ing gratitude and showing kindness—are given greater emphasis than 
negative factors—blaming employees for mistakes, downsizing, disci-
plinary actions and related measures of punishment—individual and 
organizational productivity as well as high job satisfaction and loyalty 
to the organization are significantly higher. For guidelines on how to 
facilitate positive organizational  change, see Cameron’s (2013) book.  
 Much is yet to be learned and studied regarding this trend of 
positive organizational change, but there is now sufficient evidence to 
encourage the pursuit thereof.  
 Agility: Organizational and Individual  
 Our fourth and final trend to be considered for now and in the 
future is the notion of agility briefly considered in  Chapter  2 , “Orga-
nization Development Then and Now,” as one of the major trends for 
the future, and now explained in more depth.  

320 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 As we know, a fundamental ingredient of the American culture is 
our love of “the latest”—be it a fad, clear trend if not movement, the 
magic pill for weight loss, or the silver bullet that will fix a problem. 
One such phenomenon at the present time is  agility. The concept is 
touted at both the organizational and individual levels. At the indi-
vidual level, the primary focus is on learning; that is, learning agility, 
being able and willing to grasp new ideas, tackle challenging projects, 
and make oneself vulnerable in the interest of learning something 
new in a behavioral manner that is quick and flexible. Many assume 
that agile learners are high performers. Evidence to support this 
assumption is yet to emerge, but the excitement about this concept 
and its implications remains. We have more to say about learning agil-
ity momentarily. For now, let us turn briefly to the organization.  
 At the organizational level, similar language is used. The titles of 
three recent books set the tone:  The Agility Factor by Worley, Wil-
liams, and Lawler (2014),  Cultural Agility by Caligiuri (2012), and 
 Quick and Nimble by Bryant (2014). The Worley et al. book looked 
at high-performing companies as measured by profitability and, in 
particular, return on assets across 17 industries. They found that the 
11 top performers from a total of 243 large firms could be character-
ized as agile in terms of how management conducted their businesses. 
Agility was defined in terms of rapidly changing the firm’s strategy 
when needed by staying in  constant touch with the external environ-
ment and its changing dynamics (think the Burke-Litwin model in 
 Chapter  7 , “The Burke-Litwin Model of Organizational Performance 
and Change”) followed by testing new ideas, learning from these tests, 
and then implementing change accordingly. Interestingly, this book 
seems to confirm the earlier position taken by Lawler and Worley 
(2006) that organizations “built to change” are the ones that will last.  
 Caligiuri’s book, as the title signals, emphasizes the importance 
of having a flexible culture. She argues that this agile culture must be 
led by the human resource function. And Bryant’s  Quick and Nim-
ble book has a subtitle that helps to explain his thesis— Lessons from 
Leading CEOs on How to Create a Culture of Innovation —which is 
based on numerous interviews that he has conducted over the years 
for his  New York Times  column based on “insights from the corner 
office.” His main conclusion from these interviews is that for CEOs to 

 
CHAPTER  14 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT AND THE FUTURE  
321
be successful in creating an innovative culture, they must themselves 
be agile,  or in his words, quick and nimble.  
 Returning to the individual level, the term is not individual agil-
ity exactly but, instead, it is  learning agility. It is likely that the notion 
of learning agility, irrespective of precise language, has been consid-
ered if not discussed for a long time. After all, what is often lauded as 
new isn’t. What’s the phrase, “What’s old is new again”? The idea of 
learning agility could have been considered as long as 3,000 years ago. 
Assuming that Malcolm Gladwell got his biblical story about  David 
and Goliath  (Gladwell, 2013) reasonably correct, we could easily con-
clude that David was high on learning agility. He had  learned much at 
an early age to have accomplished what he did. Whether the concept 
has been known this long or not, it is nevertheless rather difficult to 
define, much less measure, learning agility in the twenty-first century. 
But we will make an attempt. And whether learning agility is a fad or 
not, we think that it is important and, thus, we will take a stab at a 
definition followed by a brief discussion.  
 Learning agility : What is it? There are two components: One 
is skill and the other is motivation. The skill of being agile is highly 
important, especially when confronted with a novel and different situ-
ation. The learning aspect concerns whether what one has learned 
from experience, how one thinks and behaves, is applicable to the new 
and different situation and if not, what does one then do? This ques-
tion leads to the second component, motivation, that is, one’s willing-
ness to take risks in attempting to deal with a novel situation when 
not knowing exactly what to do. Coupled with risk-taking is seeking 
feedback about how one is doing regardless of how threatening this 
action might be to one’s self esteem. Relevant terms to further our 
understanding include (a) flexibility, being adaptable, not rigid, when 
trying something for the first time and getting feedback as soon as 
possible, (b) speed, trying new approaches quickly and learning about 
the consequences in the moment retaining some of the thoughts and 
behaviors and discarding others that do not appear to add anything to 
one’s learning, and (c) avoiding defensiveness, justifying one’s actions 
regardless of their efficacy regarding the uniqueness of the situation. 
In summary, learning  agility is a combination of motivation; that is, 
being willing to face new and perhaps ambiguous situations by taking 

322 
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
actions that help one to stay engaged, and the skill to discern quickly 
the consequences of these actions and then determine what to do next 
in order to continue the process of learning.  
 These are early days of studying agility, but the scholarly work is 
under way. The definitive paper so far is the one published by DeRue, 
Ashford, and Myers (2012). These organizational psychologists note 
that discussion, practice, and enthusiasm about learning agility are 
ahead of theory and research and that the concept is poorly defined 
and inadequately measured. They provide a complex yet useful model 
for understanding learning agility, which encompasses individual dif-
ferences, for example, openness to experience, contextual factors, 
such as a culture, and climate for learning. Then, they address learn-
ing agility per se in terms of both cognitive processes,  for example, 
pattern recognition, and behavioral processes, for example, experi-
mentation and reflection. DeRue and his colleagues have helped us 
to understand more broadly and deeply the concept of learning agil-
ity—the good news—but also point out at the same time the lack of 
an adequate measure—the bad news. But work is under way regard-
ing measurement, which is better news; see, for example, the com-
mentary article reacting to the DeRue et al. piece regarding the issue 
of rigor versus relevance by Mitchinson, Gerard, Roloff, and Burke 
(2012).  
 To conclude this section on the final trend, let us briefly address 
what may help to explain the popularity of the term  agility. We will 
therefore consider two possible explanations. First, it may represent 
a, if not  the, primary coping mechanism for dealing with the complex-
ity and speed of change in these and future times. Change is now 
considered to be constant with stability being a quality of the past, 
and trying to keep up is evermore challenging if not at times agoniz-
ing. Rigidity in thought and behavior is clearly not the way to cope. 
Also recall that agility is not new. As noted earlier, Kotter and Heskett 
(1992) investigated this idea at the organizational culture level and 
labeled it adaptive. What feels new perhaps is simply the more rapid 
nature of change, which contributes to feelings of intensity and dis-
comfort, and at times, experiencing a feeling of being overwhelmed. 
Learning flexible and adaptive behaviors can help.  
 A second possible explanation returns us to a discussion we con-
sidered in the section on dialogic OD; that is, the way we conduct 

 
CHAPTER  14 • ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT AND THE FUTURE  
323
OD may be unnecessarily inflexible. Maybe we cannot always have 
a diagnosis that precedes an intervention, and, besides, a diagnosis 
 is  an intervention. The question has arisen, at least in part, as a con-
sequence of the poor track record regarding successful organization 
change; that is, the failure rate is somewhere in the neighborhood 
of 70 percent. Obviously, this record is unacceptable. A key concept 
in most definitions of OD is the word  planned.  And steps or phases 
are followed:  unfreeze, change, refreeze; contracting, data gathering, 
and so on; and present state-transition state-future state. With the 
rapidity of change in the external environment, we simply do not have 
the luxury of planning the change effort as thoroughly as we might 
like. By the time we plan step 2 or 3, step 4 is already in our laps. 
Proceeding with dialogue at the outset as advocated by Bushe and 
Marshak (2014) has appeal, as does operating an organization with 
a high degree of agility where planning and action meld together as 
Worley and colleagues argue (Worley, Williams, & Lawler, 2014). We 
can also consider ideas from consulting work with loosely coupled sys-
tems where, for example, improvisation is appropriate; see  Chapter 
 10 , “Understanding and Changing Loosely Coupled Systems.” So, the 
point is that some OD work needs to be done on OD with a goal in 
mind of increasing adaptability, or if you prefer, agility. There is noth-
ing inherently wrong with planned change. It is a matter of adaptation 
to current and future circumstances.  
 On the other hand, the field of OD seems to have been under 
constant criticism; for example, see the chapters in the book coedited 
by Bradford and Burke (2005), and adaptation may have occurred 
more than we know. Surely OD practitioners are not resistant to 
change! Moreover, while we as OD practitioners may not like and 
readily embrace feedback that goes against the grain, we are, after 
all, in the change business. This means that from time to time we give 
bad news to our clients and hope that they do not kill the messenger. 
In any case, what is  good for our clients should be good for us. In 
addition to being in the change business, we are also in the learning 
business—check the subtitle of this book. Also consider the possibility 
that constant examination and criticism of OD may have contributed 
to the field’s survival rather than having caused a deadly blow. Per-
haps another 56 years is on the horizon.

ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT
 Conclusion  
 We began this concluding chapter with a brief summary of the 
final chapter of the second edition noting that organizational culture 
was an accepted term and concept beyond OD. Our clients often use 
the term before we OD practitioners speak about it. Also noted was 
OD being accepted in health-care organizations more than had been 
true in the past. Most of that chapter in 1994, however, was devoted 
to coverage of values underlying the field of OD. Moving to the pres-
ent, we covered Pasmore’s (2014)  three ODs  of humanistic/altruis-
tic, whole systems, and bottom line/efficiency, which reflect different 
values. The problem of  defining OD, according to Pasmore, is the 
existence of these three different factions in the field.  
 Regarding the future of OD, we covered four trends: (1) dialogic 
OD, a composite, in part, of large group interventions and what they 
have in common regarding OD practice; (2) leadership develop-
ment where we pointed to the importance of learning from different 
work experiences; (3) positive psychology, a trend if not movement 
of emphasizing life-giving interventions in the world of organization 
change and development; and (4) agility and its importance at both 
the individual and organizational levels.  
 These four trends are not the only ones. We could have returned 
to  Chapter  2 , for example, and elaborated on one or more of the 
trends discussed earlier, such as the inequities of the “haves” versus 
the “have nots,” particularly regarding compensation of CEOs and 
high-level executives compared with the remainder of employees in 
the organization. Our overall intent, nevertheless, with  Chapter  2 and 
this final one has been to draw our attention to the many complexi-
ties of the world we now live in and the role that OD may have with 
respect to coping and dealing with these complexities while  at the 
same time helping organizations to change. To do this well, it may be 
that OD needs to do some changing as well. In most societies, practic-
ing what one preaches is rarely, if ever, a bad thing.
