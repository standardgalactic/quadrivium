Preface
Welcome to Introduction to Adobe Flash Professional CS6. Part of Wiley’s Adobe courseware 
series, this book is designed as a complete introduction to Adobe Flash Professional for 
Creative Suite 6. With this series, we’ve set out to produce a series of textbooks that deliver 
compelling and innovative teaching solutions to instructors and superior learning experiences 
for students. Infused and informed by in-depth knowledge from Adobe Certiied Experts 
and Flash professionals who have created many oicial training titles for Adobe Systems, and 
crafted by a publisher known worldwide for the pedagogical quality of its products, these 
textbooks maximize skills transfer in minimum time. Students are challenged to reach their 
potential by using their new technical skills as highly productive members of the workforce. 
This courseware was designed to ensure you receive the topical coverage that is most relevant 
to your personal and professional success. 
Wiley’s Adobe courseware Program
Wiley’s Adobe courseware series is a complete program for instructors and institutions to 
prepare and deliver great courses on Adobe software technologies. With this courseware series, 
we recognize that—because of the rapid pace of change in the technology and curriculum 
developed by Adobe—there is an ongoing set of needs beyond classroom instruction tools 
for an instructor to be ready to teach the course. This courseware program endeavors to 
provide solutions for all these needs in a systematic manner in order to ensure a successful and 
rewarding course experience for both instructor and student via technical and curriculum 
training for instructor readiness with new software releases and a great set of tools for 
delivering instruction in the classroom and lab. All are important to the smooth delivery of a 
course on Adobe software, and all are provided with Wiley’s Adobe courseware program. We 
think about this model as a gauge for ensuring that we completely support you in your goal of 
teaching a great course. 
VIDEO TUTORIALS
Your Introduction to Adobe Flash Professional CS6 textbook comes with access to approximately 
2 hours of online video tutorials. The video tutorials are designed to supplement each lesson 
in the book. These video tutorials are created and presented by the authors and demonstrate 
topics covered in each lesson or related topics that enhance your understanding of each lesson.

Pedagogical Features
The Wiley Adobe courseware and textbooks for Adobe Creative Suite 6 are designed as 
complete introductory textbooks on a particular Adobe software product. The books are 
also designed to cover all the learning objectives for that product’s related Adobe Certiied 
Associate (ACA) exam. The ACA exam is industry-recognized and identiies skills and topics 
expected for entry-level positions. Each ACA exam item is referred to as an exam objective, 
and these objectives are highlighted throughout the textbooks. Many pedagogical features have 
been developed speciically for this courseware. Unique features of our task-based approach 
include a Lesson Skill Matrix that correlates skills taught in each lesson to the ACA objectives; 
Certiication Ready sidebars; Step-by-Step exercises; and two levels of increasingly rigorous 
lesson-ending activities—Competency Assessment and Proiciency Assessment.
Presenting the extensive procedural information and technical concepts woven throughout 
the textbook raises challenges for the student and instructor alike. The Illustrated Book Tour 
that follows provides a guide to the rich features contributing to Wiley’s Adobe courseware 
pedagogical plan. Following is a list of key features in each lesson designed to prepare students 
for success on the certiication exams and in the workplace:
• Each lesson begins with a Lesson Skill Matrix. More than a standard list of learning 
objectives, the skill matrix correlates each software skill covered in the lesson to the speciic 
ACA exam objective.
• Each lesson features a real-world Business Case scenario that places the software skills and 
knowledge to be acquired in a real-world setting.
• Concise and frequent Step-by-Step instructions teach students new features and provide 
an opportunity for hands-on practice. Numbered steps give detailed instructions to help 
students learn software skills. The steps also show results and screen images to match what 
students should see on their computer screens.
• Illustrations provide visual feedback as students work through the exercises. The images 
reinforce key concepts, provide visual clues about the steps, and allow students to check their 
progress.
• When the text instructs a student to use a particular tool, tool images are shown within the 
text.
• Important technical vocabulary is listed in the Key Terms section at the beginning of the 
lesson. When these terms are used later in the lesson, they appear in bold italic type and are 
deined. The Glossary contains all of the key terms and their deinitions.
• Engaging point-of-use Reader Aids located throughout the lessons tell students why this 
topic is relevant (The Bottom Line) and provide students with helpful hints (identiied with 
the words Take Note) or ways to expand their skills (identiied using the text Learning More). 
Reader aids also provide additional relevant or background information that adds value to 
the lesson.
• Certiication Ready features throughout the text signal students where a speciic 
certiication objective is covered. They provide students with a chance to check their 
understanding of that particular ACA exam objective and, if necessary, review the section

of the lesson where it is covered. This courseware provides complete preparation for ACA 
certiication.
• Each lesson ends with a Skill Summary, recapping the ACA exam skills covered in 
the lesson.
• Accompanying video tutorials for each lesson provide a visual way to see selected content 
from the each lesson presented by the authors.
• The Knowledge Assessment section provides a total of 20 questions from a mix of True/
False and Multiple Choice, testing students on concepts learned in the lesson.
• Competency Assessment and Proiciency Assessment sections provide progressively 
more challenging lesson-ending activities.
• Integrated Circling Back projects provide students with an opportunity to renew and 
practice skills learned in previous lessons.
• The student companion website contains the online iles needed for each lesson.

Business case
There’s an animated ﬁ sh cartoon series that you need to create for a client’s website. 
Your artwork is supposed to look more like a cartoon than the real thing. It will be 
important for you to learn how to draw artwork from scratch in order to create your 
own characters for the cartoon as well as the underwater environment for the ﬁ sh to 
live in. 
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
workspace. See “Resetting the Flash workspace” in the Starting up section of this book. 
You will work with several i les from the ﬂ 02lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that you 
have loaded the ﬂ lessons folder onto your hard drive from http://www.wiley.com/college/sc/adobeseries.

Lesson 1
The Swatches panel
You’ll see the swatch icon (
) quite a few times in Flash—it opens the Swatches panel, which 
is used to set colors for backgrounds, fills, outlines, and type. As shown in Figure 1-23, you can 
choose from over 200 color presets and seven preset gradients, or create your own. Flash also 
has the ability to show the web-safe color panel that shows the 216 web-safe colors commonly 
used for older monitors.You will learn how to add your own custom colors and gradients to the 
Swatches panel in Lesson 2, “Getting Started with the Drawing Tools.”
Figure 1-23: The Flash CS6 Swatches panel.
The six-character code at the top of the Swatches panel is hexadecimal code, the standard 
color-coding system for the Web. As you choose colors from the Swatches panel, you’ll see the 
hexadecimal value for the selected color displayed at the top. The Color Picker in Adobe CS6 
applications such as Illustrator and Photoshop also features hexadecimal values, so you can easily 
match colors between applications by copying and pasting the code shown.
Practicing with the Flash tools
Now that you’ve had a tour of the Flash tools and workspace, it’s time to take them for a test 
drive. In the following exercises, you’ll complete the illustration shown in ﬂ 0102_ﬁ sh.ﬂ a 
while getting the feel for the selection, drawing, and transformation tools. You’ll also use Flash 
tweening to create your ﬁ rst animation. 
The drawing and selection tools in action
Your ﬁ rst steps will be to create and modify shapes and freehand artwork with the drawing 
tools, and then ﬁ ne-tune your work with the selection tools. The selection tools work as a team 
with the drawing tools to position and modify shapes, illustrations, and type. 
Follow these steps to use the drawing and selection tools
Step-by-Step
1. Choose File > Open and open the ﬂ 0102.ﬂ a ﬁ le located in the ﬂ 01lessons folder. 
2. Choose File > Save As; the Save As dialog box appears. In the Save As text ﬁ eld, type 
ﬂ 0102_work.ﬂ a, then navigate to the ﬂ 01lessons folder and press Save.
3. Choose the Selection tool ( ) in the Tools panel. This versatile tool can select, move, and 
manipulate objects directly on the Stage.

with a gradient from your Swatches panel.
3. The Eyedropper tool (
) enables you to sample a color from one object and transfer it to 
another. You’ll use it to apply the body color to the ﬁ sh’s ﬁ ns. Using the Selection tool ( ), 
hold down the Shift key and click once on each ﬁ n so that both are selected at the same 
time. Select the Eyedropper tool from the Tools panel. Click once on the body of the ﬁ sh 
to sample the new color and apply it to the selected ﬁ ns.
4. Choose Edit > Deselect All to deselect all items on the Stage. In the Tools panel, click 
and hold the Paint Bucket tool ( ) and select the Ink Bottle tool (
) from the menu 
that appears. The Ink Bottle tool lets you change an object’s stroke color. You’ll use the 
Property Inspector to set a stroke color and style to apply. 
5. In the Property Inspector, click the Stroke color swatch and type #FF6600 (orange) into 
the hexadecimal ﬁ eld at the top-left corner of the Swatches panel that appears. Press Enter 
or Return to set this color.
6. Click on the Style menu that appears below the color swatches. Choose the ragged style 
from the drop-down menu (Figure 1-31). As shown in Figure 1-32, click on the edge of 
the ﬁ sh body to apply the new stroke color and style.

Lesson 9
Controlling Movie Clip Timelines
Follow these steps to control Movie Clip Timelines
Step-by-Step
1. Open the Actions panel by choosing Window > Actions from the main menu. Click 
on frame 42 of the Actions layer to make sure you’re adding actions to this frame. The 
gotoAndStop( ) action you added in the last section should still be hanging around here. 
You may remember from the ﬁ nished ﬁ le that this animation will feature an intense and 
indeﬁ nite standof  between cat and bird. Let’s swap out that gotoAndStop( ) action with a 
simple stop( ) action and then move on to some i ner points of this animation.
2. Press the Delete the selected action(s) button twice to clear out the actions panel. Now 
click the Add a new item to the script button and choose ﬂ ash.display > MovieClip > 
Methods > stop. Hopefully this enigmatic menu is getting a bit more familiar at this point. 
You’ll use it pretty frequently.
3. Type this in the Object text ﬁ eld. The Actions panel should look like Figure 9-13 below 
when complete. Close the Actions panels when you are done.
Figure 9-13: Swap out the gotoAndStop( ) action for a stop( ) action.
4. You may not have noticed, but the bird and cat are twitching and blinking respectively 
throughout the movie. It may be nice to hold oﬀ  these movements until the bird has 
alighted atop the cat. You can stop and play the bird and cat Eye timelines the same way 
you stop and play the main timeline. But ﬁ rst you’ll need a way to refer to each of these 
objects.
5. Using the Selection tool ( ), click on the bird Movie Clip on the Stage as shown in 
Figure 9-14. Click on the Properties tab to make sure the Property Inspector is accessible. 
Take Note...
The Actions panel often interferes with your access of objects on the Stage. Refer to Lesson 7 
for tips on managing your workspace. Most Flash users who rely heavily on scripting create 
custom workspaces to help manage this sometimes cumbersome panel.

Project 5-1: Animation Review
Project 5-1
In animation, you’re often trying to replicate what the organic version of the object would 
really do in the real world. Many animators will study a subject for quite some time to take 
note of the physics and physical reactions of the object they’re trying to recreate digitally. Let’s 
start the process of creating a bouncing ball by doing some review. 
1. Create a new ActionScript 3.0 document in Flash.
2. Select the Oval tool, set the ﬁ ll color to blue, the stroke to none and make sure you’re in 
Object Drawing mode. Draw a circle at the top of the Stage.
3. Choose the Selection tool and make sure the blue circle is selected on the Stage. Choose 
Modify > Covert to Symbol, save the symbol as movie clip named Bouncing Ball.
4. With the symbol still selected on the Stage, choose Insert > Motion Tween. 
5. Make sure the playhead is at the end of the frame span and drag the circle down to the 
bottom of the stage. 
6. Preview the animation of the circle by pressing Enter or Return. 
7. Save this ﬁ le as bouncing_ball.ﬂ a and keep it open for the next exercise. 
Trying Out More Eases
Project 5-2
There are a lot of eases built into Flash. Some of them are already preset to simulate realistic 
animation of objects in the real world. Spring is one of those presets...
1. You should still have the bouncing_ball.ﬂ a ﬁ le open from the last exercise. 
2. Choose Window > Motion Editor. 
3. Go to the Eases section at the bottom of the panel and add the Spring ease.
4. Return to the top of the Motion Editor and assign the Spring ease to the Y position value 
of your animation and preview the ball movement. 
5. Save this ﬁ le as bouncing_ball_5.2.ﬂ a and keep it open for the next exercise.

Animating Color
Project 5-3
Let’s add to the bouncing ball by reviewing color animation. It’s just another facet to 
animation that doesn’t have to be about movement so much as it is about change. 
1. You should still have the bouncing_ball_5.2.ﬂ a ﬁ le open from the last exercise. 
2. Return to the Timeline and go to the last keyframe. 
3. Select the Bouncing Ball instance and choose Tint from the Color Eﬀ ect menu in the 
Properties Panel. 
4. Change the color to red and set the tint percentage to 100%.
5. The ball should now bounce and change color. 
6. Save this ﬁ le as bouncing_ball_5.3.ﬂ a and keep it open for the next exercise.
Eases Demystiﬁ ed 
Project 5-4
Many people think eases only apply to physical movement, but as you’ll see that’s really not the 
case...
1. With the bouncing_ball_5.3.ﬂ a ﬁ le still open from the last exercise, make sure your 
bouncing ball symbol is still selected. Choose Window > Motion Editor. 
2. Go to the bottom of the Motion Editor and assign the Spring ease to the Tint Amount 
value and note the eﬀ ect.
3. Save this ﬁ le as bouncing_ball_5.4.ﬂ a.
Circling Back 1
There are numerous ways to add a curved movement to an object. Getting the Pen tool 
involved and creating Bezier curves is yet another method you can incorporate. If you’re 
familiar with the Pen in Flash (or Illustrator) you may know it to be more of a drawing tool. In 
the next exercise you’ll use it more as a manipulation tool. 
Using the Pen as an Animation Modiﬁ er
Project 1
The company you’re working for is asking you to design an animation that involves race cars 
on a race track that moves in an S shape. You need to mock up the animation to ﬁ gure out 
how to replicate the movement of the cars on the track. 
1. Create a new ActionScript 3.0 document in Flash.
2. Select the Oval tool, set the ﬁ ll color to blue, the stroke to none and make sure you’re in 
Object Drawing mode. Draw a circle on the left of the Stage.
3. Choose the Selection tool and make sure the blue circle is selected on the Stage. Choose 
Modify > Covert to Symbol, save the symbol as movie clip named race car.
4. With the symbol still selected on the Stage, choose Insert > Motion Tween. 
5. Make sure the playhead is at the end of the frame span and drag the circle to the right so 
that it moves from left to right on the screen. 
6. Preview the animation of the circle by pressing Enter or Return.

WHY ACA CERTIFICATION?
The Adobe Certiﬁed Associate (ACA) credential has been upgraded to validate skills with the 
Adobe Creative Suite 6 system. The ACA certiﬁcations target information workers and cover 
the most popular business applications. 
Adobe oﬀers four areas in which to gain certiﬁcation for entry-level skills: Web 
Communication using Adobe Dreamweaver, Rich Media Communication using Adobe Flash, 
Video Communication using Adobe Premiere Pro and Visual Communication using Adobe 
Photoshop. To learn more about becoming an Adobe Certiﬁed Associate and exam availability,

Preparing to Take an Exam
The workplace demand for digital media skills—creating, managing, integrating, and 
communicating information by using Adobe’s dynamic multimedia, video, graphic, web, or 
design software—is on the rise. This new certiﬁcation program will help educators eﬀectively 
teach and validate digital communications skills while providing students with credentials that 
demonstrate real-world prowess to prospective employers.
What are the Benefits of Becoming Certified?
By certifying one’s skills, individuals can validate their technical abilities and demonstrate 
proﬁciency. Adobe’s associate-level certiﬁcations are based on research about digital 
communications skills required by industry, government, and education. The objectives relect 
the foundation skills needed to be successful communicators in today’s digital world.
In educational settings, industry-recognized certiﬁcation programs ensure students and 
teachers are acquiring the knowledge and skills valued in today’s workplace. For institutions 
seeking to keep curriculum vitalized and relevant, certiﬁcation plays a critical role in bridging 
classroom learning to real-world application.
Preparing to Take an Exam
Unless you are a very experienced user, you will need to use a test preparation course to 
prepare for the test to complete it correctly and within the time allowed. Wiley’s Adobe 
courseware is designed to prepare you with a strong knowledge of all exam topics. With some 
additional review and practice on your own, you should feel conﬁdent in your ability to pass 
the appropriate exam.
After you decide which exam to take, review the list of objectives for the exam. This list can 
be found in Appendix A at the back of this book. You can also easily identify tasks that are 
included in the objective list by locating the Lesson Skill Matrix at the start of each lesson and 
the Certiﬁcation Ready sidebars in the margin of the lessons in this book.
To take the ACA test, visit www.certiport.com/adobe to locate your nearest testing center. Then 
call the testing center directly to schedule your test. The amount of advance notice you should 
provide will vary for diﬀerent testing centers, and it typically depends on the number of 
computers available at the testing center, the number of other testers who have already been 
scheduled for the day on which you want to take the test, and the number of times per week 
that the testing center oﬀers ACA testing. In general, you should call to schedule your test at 
least two weeks prior to the date on which you want to take the test.
When you arrive at the testing center, you might be asked for proof of identity. A driver’s 
license or passport is an acceptable form of identiﬁcation. If you do not have either of 
these items of documentation, call your testing center and ask what alternative forms of 
identiﬁcation will be accepted. If you are retaking a test, bring your ACA identiﬁcation 
number, which will have been given to you when you previously took the test. If you have not 
prepaid or if your organization has not already arranged to make payment for you, you will 
need to pay the test-taking fee when you arrive.
Test Format
All ACA certiﬁcation tests are live, performance-based tests. There are no multiple-choice, 
true/false, or short-answer questions. Instructions are general: you are told the basic tasks to 
perform on the computer, but you aren’t given any help in ﬁguring out how to perform them. 
You are not permitted to use reference material other than the application’s Help system.

Business case
You’ve been assigned the task of creating a simple animation for a pet shop. The 
problem is, you’re new to Flash and haven’t had much time with the program yet. 
You’ll start to explore the basic functions of the program, how to draw, how to do 
some basic animation and how to manipulate the workspace for your purposes.

Lesson 1
Starting up
In this lesson, you will set up a new Flash document and work with several prepared ﬁles to 
explore Flash’s tools and features. If you haven’t done so already, install Flash Professional 
CS6 and the Adobe Media Encoder. Instructions for installation, system requirements, and 
information on how to use lesson ﬁles are in the Starting up section of this book.
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
workspace. See “Resetting the Flash workspace” in the Starting up section of this book. 
You will work with several ﬁles from the ﬂ01lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that you have 
loaded the ﬂlessons folder onto your hard drive from http://www.wiley.com/college/sc/adobeseries. See 
“Loading lesson ﬁles” in the Starting up section of this book.
What is Flash?
You may have heard about Flash and seen it on eye-catching websites, online and social games, 
and banner advertisements. But did you know that you can use Flash for more than creating 
animated graphics? With Flash CS6 Professional, you can also manipulate video and sound, 
and even connect to databases to build web-based applications, such as shopping carts, or 
display news feeds of continuously updated information. 
There are four key feature areas in Flash CS6 Professional:
Drawing environment. Flash features a complete set of drawing tools to handle intricate 
illustration and typography. Like its cousin, Adobe Illustrator CS6, Flash is a native vector-
drawing application where you’ll create rich, detailed, and scalable digital illustrations. Flash 
supports Illustrator and Photoshop ﬁles in their native ﬁle formats, .ai and .psd, making it easy 
to work with your favorite applications. All the content you create in Flash or these other 
programs can be brought to life through animation and interactivity.
Animation. Flash creates lightweight animation that incorporates images, sound, and video, 
and can be quickly downloaded through the Web. It has become a favorite—and essential—tool 
among web designers and developers who want to take their creativity to a whole new level. 
Flash animation is featured on websites and social networks, and is a primary tool for developing 
interactive, web-based advertisements. Flash’s capabilities also extend beyond the Web, with 
tools and options for creating applications and content for smartphones and tablets, too.

Lesson 1: Flash CS6 Jumpstart
What is Flash?
Flash supports traditional frame-by-frame animation as well as its own method of animation, 
known as tweening (Figure 1-1). With tweening, you specify an object to animate, create 
starting and ending frames, and Flash automatically creates the frames in between (hence 
tween) to create slick motion, color, and transformation eﬀects. You’ll design your own Flash 
animations in Lesson 5, “Creating Basic Animation.”
Figure 1-1: Flash’s animation tweening easily generates animation between starting and ending frames. 
Layout. The Flash stage gives you the ﬂexibility to create extraordinary website layouts 
limited only by your creativity. You can position content anywhere on the Flash Stage with 
ﬂexibility and precision, taking your layouts far beyond the “box” often associated with 
traditional web pages. Flash movies can also include any typefaces you choose, allowing you 
to use fancy typography and unusual fonts freely on your web pages, which is typically more 
involved and less consistent outside of Flash.

Lesson 1
Programming. Hidden beneath the beauty of Flash Professional CS6 is the brain of 
ActionScript, a powerful, built-in scripting language that extends your capabilities beyond 
simple design and animation. With basic ActionScript, which you’ll learn about in Lesson 9, 
“Introducing ActionScript,” you can control movie playback or add functionality to buttons. 
If you venture deeper, ActionScript can turn Flash into a full-ﬂedged, application-building 
environment to create shopping carts, music players, games, and mobile applications. An 
example is provided in Figure 1-2.
Figure 1-2: Flash can develop lightweight games for the Web and smartphones.
About Flash Player
The Flash Player is a stand-alone application found most often as a plug-in to such popular 
browsers as Internet Explorer, Safari, and Firefox. The Flash Player is required to play 
compressed Flash movies (.swf ﬁles), much like a movie projector is needed to play ﬁlm reels.
The Flash Player is much more than just a playback machine, however. It is the platform 
that Flash content runs on and is the engine upon which ActionScript functions so you can 
incorporate rich interactivity within your movies.
As of this writing, the Flash Player is installed on more than 98 percent of Internet-enabled 
computers, so a majority of your online audience is already equipped to view your Flash 
creations. For users who do not have Flash Player installed, it is available as a free download 
from the Adobe website, adobe.com.

Flash ile types
Flash Player 11 includes both a stand-alone application and browser plug-in, and is 
automatically installed with the Flash Professional CS6 application.
For environments where Flash player is not supported (such as on iPhones and iPads), you can 
publish Flash content as HTML and JavaScript, so it can run in nearly any device or browser.
Flash file types
You will encounter up to four types of Flash iles: .ﬂa, .xﬂ, .swf and .html. Each one has a 
very speciﬁc purpose in the process of creating or delivering Flash movies.
Flash work ﬁles are generally created and saved in the .ﬂa (Flash authoring) format. These are 
the working documents you’ll use to design, edit, and store resources such as graphics, images, 
sound, and video. Additionally, each .ﬂa document stores its own unique settings for ﬁnal 
publishing. Because they are intended for designing and editing, .ﬂa ﬁles can’t be viewed with 
the Flash Player or in a browser—they’re only used as the foundation to publish your ﬁnal 
movie ﬁles in the .swf ﬁle format. You can also save source ﬁles in the .xﬂ ﬁle format, which 
allows for open exchange between Flash and other authoring applications. The XFL format is 
a way to represent a Flash Pro document as an XML-based open folder of ﬁles. In Flash CS6, 
a document still uses the individual ﬁles that make up the projects. This oﬀers improved cross-
product integration and workﬂow productivity. If you replace the .ﬂa extension with .zip, you 
can even unzip the ﬁle to view its contents.For nearly all examples in this book, however, it’s 
assumed you are editing and saving to the .ﬂa ﬁle format.
“Swiﬀ”, or .swf, ﬁles are completed, compressed movie ﬁles exported from your original 
.ﬂa authoring ﬁles. These are played via the Flash Player in either a browser or your desktop. 
Although you can import .swf ﬁles into the Flash Professional CS6 application, you cannot 
edit them; you will need to reopen the original .ﬂa ﬁles to make changes or additions. You can 
now also publish your movies to a variety of other formats, including HTML (for display in 
browsers and devices that don’t support the Flash plug-in), AIR (for desktop applications), and 
popular mobile application formats for iOS and Android devices.
FLV and F4V are Flash video formats that provide a way to present motion graphics in a highly 
compressed, yet high quality formate for display on the web and within applications.
Now that you know what you’re going to be working with, it’s time to get your ﬁrst Flash 
document started and begin exploring the Flash Professional CS6 workspace.
Take Note...
Another term you may hear when working in Flash is XMP. XMP (Extensible Metadata 
Platform) is a labeling technology that allows you to embed data about a ﬁle, known as 
metadata, into the ﬁle itself. This information can be used to help users ﬁnd your ﬁle when 
searching on a computer or on the internet

used for a variety of diﬀerent types of projects. Because of this, prior to diving into Flash and 
creating content, its very important that you determine the needs of the project ﬁrst.
When developing the project concept, determine the purpose of the project. What is the 
project itself attempting to do and what are the goals of the client for this project? You’ll want 
to develop a project plan that will identify the purpose and outline the criteria that is relevant 
to that purpose. The scope of a project plan should include work to be performed and should 
encompass the clients’ expectations including tasks to be performed, due dates for diﬀerent 
stages of the project, and resource allocation for the project. It’s quite helpful to outline the 
phases of a project so that the client and the developer can easily measure the project status. 
Phases of a project plan might include:
• Planning and analysis
• Designing
• Building
• Testing
• Implementation or Launching
Determine your audience. This can often create limitations or open additional possibilities 
for your project. You need to know who your audience is in order to create a project that suits 
their needs. Know the age, occupation, gender, education, residence, ethnicity, and computer 
literacy of your target audience. Also ﬁnd out if your audience will require that the project be 
accessible (able to be read on a screen reader by users with visual impairments) as content in 
Flash that is not made accessible will be unreadable to certain users. Knowing this information 
will set the project on the right track and create a realistic target for the goals of the project.
Establish deliverables. When working with a client, there will become points during the 
project in which expectations need to be met and deliverables will need to be presented to the 
client and in some cases, the client will have deliverables to provide to you. With rich media, 
content can be aﬀected by end-user technical factors such as the target playback device, screen 
size and resolution, download speed, browser type, and operating system. Consider all of these 
factors when producing deliverables to the client. Some examples of deliverables you might be 
expected to provide could include:
• Storyboards (rough drawings of the stages of the animation for conveying information 
about the project. These often include animations, transitions, sequencing and timing, 
navigation, images, text, audio, buttons, interactions, link information, and placement of 
elements on the stage.)
• Comps
• Sketches
• Flowcharts
• A site map
• Prototypes
• Flash ﬁles (.ﬂa or .swf)
• HTML ﬁles

Creating a new document
During various phases of a project, you’ll need to gather feedback on design and content plans 
from other users such as clients and even peers. You’ll want to employ various techniques 
to obtain this information to stay on track and organized. Some techniques for gathering 
feedback might include:
• E-mail
• Questionnaires
• Collaborative review of a PDF document
• Meetings (online and in-person)
Finally, during any project you want to focus on keeping the project on task and adhering 
to the project plan. It’s easy for a project to get oﬀ course or for the client to request items 
outside of the scope of the project (scope creep) at diﬀerent phases of the project. Try to avoid 
a whimsical or oﬀ-the-cuﬀ approach to project management. Adhere to the project plan, make 
modiﬁcations when necessary, but don’t let the project go oﬀ course as you run the risk of not 
meeting the original project requirements or the expectations of the client. When making 
design and development decisions, always keep the end-user requirements in mind.
Creating a new document
Before you can draw or animate, you need to create a new document, or more speciﬁcally, 
an .ﬂa ﬁle where all your work takes place. You can create and open documents from the 
Welcome Screen or from the File menu at the top of the screen.
The Welcome Screen (Figure 1-3) is the launch pad for creating and opening ﬁles, including 
handy, built-in sample templates for common project types, such as Flash movies, advertising 
banners, and mobile phone application templates. The Welcome Screen appears when Flash is 
ﬁrst launched or when no documents are open in the application. 
Figure 1-3: The Welcome Screen is the launch pad for new documents, including  
many templates for common projects.

Lesson 1
Follow these steps to create a new document
Step-by-Step
1. To create a new .ﬂa document using the Welcome Screen, open Flash CS6 Professional. If 
the application is already open, close any ﬁles that are currently open using File > Close All.
2. From the Create New column in the middle of the Welcome Screen, select ActionScript 3.0. 
Your workspace, including the Stage, Timeline, and Tools panel, appears.
3. Alternatively, you can create a new .ﬂa document using the File menu. If you already 
created a new document using the Welcome Screen, this is not necessary.
To create a new document from the File menu, choose File > New. The New Document 
dialog box appears. Select ActionScript 3.0, and press OK to create the new document. 
Your workspace appears.
Setting up your new document
Now that you’ve created your new Flash ﬁle, take a moment to specify some important settings for 
it. These settings, or properties, will prepare your document before you get to work.
Follow these steps to change document settings
Step-by-Step
1. Choose Modify > Document or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+J (Windows) or 
Command+J (Mac OS) to open the Document Settings dialog box. Note that many of 
the settings in the Document Settings dialog box can also be adjusted in the Properties 
inspector when nothing is selected on the stage.
2. Under the Dimensions section, locate the (width) and (height) ﬁelds and type 500 and 
300, respectively, to set the width and height of your stage in pixels. The size of the Stage 
is identical to the size of your ﬁnal movie, so make sure the size accommodates the design 
you want to create. Note the ability to change the ruler units to a diﬀerent unit of measure 
if desired. 
3. Click on the Background Color swatch ( ) and the Swatches panel appears. This lets you 
choose the color of your Stage and, in turn, the background color for your ﬁnal movie 
(.swf ﬁle) when it’s published. If necessary, set the background color to white (#FFFFFF).
4. Note the Frame rate indicator ﬁeld. Leave it set to the default (24 frames per second) for 
now but you can change this setting to speed up or slow down your animation. The frame 
rate determines the playback speed and performance of your movie, and you can adjust 
it later if you need to. You’ll learn more about ﬁne-tuning your frame rate in Lesson 6, 
“Advanced Animation.”
Take Note...
The Match to Printer option sets your new document to match the paper size of your default 
system printer. This option is typically set to Default, requiring you to specify the width and 
height, or use the default Dimensions settings stored in Flash.

5. From the Ruler units drop-down menu, choose Pixels, if it is not already selected, to 
deﬁne the unit of measurement used throughout your Flash movie, including rulers, 
panels, and dialog boxes as shown in Figure 1-4.
Figure 1-4: Use the Document Settings dialog box to specify settings.
Take Note...
If you are new to designing for the screen, the concept of pixels may feel a bit alien to you. It 
helps to remember that there are generally 72 pixels in one inch for size calculation. If you 
prefer, you can use the Document dialog box at any time to change the Ruler units for your 
ﬁle to a diferent unit of measurement.
6. Press OK to exit the Document Settings dialog box and apply these settings. Leave the 
new document open. You’ll save it in the next part of this lesson.

Lesson 1
Saving your Flash document
Your new document should be saved before starting any work or adding any content. By 
default, the application saves documents in Flash CS6 (.ﬂa) format. 
Follow these steps to save a document
Step-by-Step
1. Choose File > Save. 
2. In the Save dialog box that appears, type l0101_work.la into the Save As text ﬁeld as 
displayed in Figure 1-5. Navigate to the ﬂ01lessons folder, and press Save. Choose File > 
Close to close the document.
Figure 1-5: Use the Save dialog box to choose a name and location for your new ﬁle. 
Take Note...
Always include the .la extension at the end of your ﬁlename to make it easy to identify the 
ﬁle format.

Lesson 1: Flash CS6 Jumpstart
Creating a new document
To share your work with designers using Flash CS5, you can choose to save your document 
in Flash CS5 format. Flash Professional CS6 format ﬁles will not open in Flash CS5 or 
earlier. Flash CS6 Professional, however, can open ﬁles created in Flash CS5 or earlier.
Get started with sample templates
Flash includes a variety of sample templates to streamline the process of setting up common Flash 
projects. Creating files from these templates will pre-configure options such as document size and 
ActionScript version. Choose File > New and click on the Templates tab to view Flash’s included 
templates.
In the Advertising section, templates include common banner sizes. Be aware that creating files 
from these templates sets the Flash player and ActionScript versions extremely conservatively for 
maximum compatibility. If you were planning on using the latest and greatest techniques and 
features in your project, this may be constricting.
New templates have been added for Animation, Banners, and Media Playback, and the 
Presentations templates have been enhanced for Flash Professional CS6. Sample Files, including 
animation examples, have been added as well. For more information on these new templates, see 
Lesson 15, “What’s New in Adobe Flash CS6?”.
Opening documents
Knowing how to open documents is as important as knowing how to save them. In addition 
to ﬁles created in Flash CS6 Professional, such as those included with this book, you can open 
documents created in previous versions of Flash. The steps are simple. 
Follow these steps to open a document
Step-by-Step
1. Choose File > Open. Use the Open dialog box to locate the l0101_work.la ﬁle you 
previously saved into the ﬂ01lessons folder. 
2. Select the l0101_work.la ﬁle, then press Open. Leave this ﬁle open. You will be using it 
in the next exercise.
Take Note...
Don’t confuse the Open command with the Import options also found in the File menu. 
To access ﬁles created in other applications, such as Photoshop or Illustrator, you must use 
the Import menu. Importing ﬁles from other applications is explored in detail in Lesson 8, 
“Working with Imported Files.”

If you want to reopen a document on which you have recently worked, there’s a shortcut. 
To list the last ten documents you’ve opened, and to reopen one, choose File > Open 
Recent, then select the ﬁle you need as shown in Figure 1-6.
Figure 1-6: Choose File > Open Recent to access the last ten documents opened in Flash.

You can also open ﬁles using the Open button ( ) at the bottom of the Open Recent Items 
column on the Welcome Screen. Above this icon, you’ll see the last several documents you 
worked on; this is a useful alternative to the Open Recent menu option.
The Flash workspace
Now that you know how to create, save, and open Flash documents, you’re ready to get 
familiar with the workspace where you’ll spend your time creating Flash content. The 
workspace is composed of the interface and all of the panels within Flash including but not 
limited to the Project panel, Tools panel, Timeline, Layers, Properties panel, Library panel, 
Output panel, Edit bar, Motion editor, and Accesibility panel. 
The Stage and work area
After you create a Flash document, the center of your workspace, called the Stage, is where 
the action happens. The Stage is the visible area of your movie, where you place graphics and 
build animations and is also subdivided by scenes.. By default, the Flash Stage appears white, 
but, as you saw earlier, you can change its background color from the Document dialog box 
using the Modify > Document command.

a character to enter from the pasteboard onto the Stage. The pasteboard is also a good place to 
store objects that are not ready to appear in your movie. The Stage reﬂects the actual size of the

The Property Inspector
By default, the Property Inspector appears on the right side of your Flash workspace. 
Grouped with the Library panel, it displays properties and options for objects selected on the 
Stage, and also allows you to modify them. The Property Inspector is contextual, and so the 
information it displays is speciﬁc to the tool or object you select. 
The Property Inspector is an essential part of the Flash workﬂow; it can display and set an 
object’s properties, including width, height, position, and ﬁll color for objects such as text, 
images, links, frames, shapes, actions, symbols, sound, tween, and the document itself. Let’s 
take a look at the Property Inspector in action.
Follow these steps to set an object’s properties using the Property Inspector
Step-by-Step
1. If the l0101_work.la ﬁle is not still open from the last exercise, choose File > Open to 
reopen it from inside the ﬂ01lessons folder. Select the Rectangle tool ( ) from the Tools panel.
2. At the bottom of the Tools panel, click the Fill Color swatch ( ). When the Swatches 
panel appears, choose a yellow shade from the right side of the Swatches panel as shown in

Lesson 1
Panels and panel groups
The Flash workspace is extremely ﬂexible. It is organized into a series of panels, many of 
which you’ll become quite familiar with, including the Library panel, Property Inspector, 
and Timeline. You’re free to arrange any of these panels however you like. You can also open 
panels that are not available in the default workspace and arrange, group, and resize them to 
suit your needs. 
You’ll explore the workspace in more detail in Lesson 7, “Customizing Your Workﬂow,” but 
there are a couple things that you should be aware of in the interim. 
Eventually you’ll want to take control of your workspace and customize it to your preference, 
but for now, the ﬂexibility of the workspace might be more confusing than advantageous. If you 
mistakenly drag panels around and start losing them, you can always reset your panels to their 
default positions by choosing Window > Workspace > Essentials as shown in Figure 1-15. If 
you’re migrating to Flash CS6 from an earlier version, you may also be interested in the Classic 
option found in this menu. For the sake of consistency, this book uses the default CS6 workspace.

Workspace > Reset ‘Essentials’ to reset your workspace to the  
Flash CS6 defaults.

It’s also important to note that each panel features a panel menu that can be accessed from the 
button in the top-right corner as shown in Figure 1-16. This menu contains options that may 
or may not be available inside the panel. Sometimes this menu is superﬂuous; sometimes it’s 
integral. Just remember to keep it in the back of your mind. This menu is usually the ﬁrst place 
to look if you can’t ﬁnd an option that you’re looking for.
Figure 1-16: Panel menus are accessed using the button in the  
top-right corner.
The Timeline
The Flash Timeline (Figure 1-17) is the heart of the action, where you create animations and 
sequence graphics with sound, video, and controls. The Timeline comprises frames, each one 
representing a point in time, just like a historical timeline. Graphics and animations are placed 
at speciﬁc points, or keyframes, along the Timeline to create sequences, slide shows, or movies. 
You can place ActionScript on individual keyframes to control playback and add interactivity, 
or place sounds along the Timeline to add sound eﬀects, music, and dialogue.

Lesson 1
The Timeline is composed of layers, which behave like transparent pieces of ﬁlm stacked on 
top of one another. Each animation and piece of artwork can be placed on its own individual 
layer, which helps you organize and manage your work. If you’ve worked with other Adobe 
CS6 applications, such as Illustrator, Photoshop, or InDesign, you may already be familiar with 
the power and ﬂexibility of layers. 
Like all panels, the Timeline has a panel menu. Most of the options included in the Timeline’s 
panel menu relate to customizing its display. As shown in Figure 1-18, you can adjust the size 
of layers and frames and turn on Preview mode to display the objects included on each layer as 
a thumbnail in the Timeline. 
Figure 1-18: Change the Timeline settings according to  
how you’d like it to appear.
In this exercise, you’ll explore a Timeline with multiple keyframes, animations, and layers to 
see how a typical Flash document looks.
Follow these steps to explore the Timeline
Step-by-Step
1. Choose File > Open, and select the l0103.la document inside the ﬂ01lessons folder. Press 
Open to open it for editing.
2. Examine the Timeline below the Stage. You’ll see that it contains a layer, with a layer 
folder above it. Layer folders can contain layers and are used to organize the Timeline 
when layers start to add up. As shown in Figure 1-19, click the arrow to the left of the 
Gears layer folder to expand it and reveal its contents. The three indented layers displayed 
in Figure 1-20 under the Gears name are the layers that are inside the folder.

3. Each of the three layers contains a separate animation that is marked at the beginning and 
end with a keyframe. Keyframes are special frames that are created along the Timeline 
where you want to introduce or remove a graphic, start or end an animation, or trigger 
something to happen with ActionScript. A blue background on frames indicates a Motion 
tween animation. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to play the Timeline.
4. Look at Layer 4 in the Timeline, which contains several consecutive keyframes. Click once 
on each keyframe to jump to that frame and see what it displays at that speciﬁc point in time. 
5. To shuttle through the Timeline, grab the playhead at the top (indicated by the red 
marker), and drag it in either direction as displayed in Figure 1-21.

6. Choose File > Close to close the current document. If prompted to save any changes, press 
No (Windows) or Don’t Save (Mac OS). 
Tabbing between open documents
When you have more than one document open at a time, each document displays its own tab at 
the top of the document window. Click on a document’s tab to switch to it and bring it forward 
for editing (Figure 1-22). To close the active document, you can choose File > Close, or use the 
small x that appears at the top of the document’s tab. To close all open documents at once, choose 
File > Close All.

The Swatches panel
You’ll see the swatch icon (
) quite a few times in Flash—it opens the Swatches panel, which 
is used to set colors for backgrounds, fills, outlines, and type. As shown in Figure 1-23, you can 
choose from over 200 color presets and seven preset gradients, or create your own. Flash also 
has the ability to show the web-safe color panel that shows the 216 web-safe colors commonly 
used for older monitors.You will learn how to add your own custom colors and gradients to the 
Swatches panel in Lesson 2, “Getting Started with the Drawing Tools.”
Figure 1-23: The Flash CS6 Swatches panel.
The six-character code at the top of the Swatches panel is hexadecimal code, the standard 
color-coding system for the Web. As you choose colors from the Swatches panel, you’ll see the 
hexadecimal value for the selected color displayed at the top. The Color Picker in Adobe CS6 
applications such as Illustrator and Photoshop also features hexadecimal values, so you can easily 
match colors between applications by copying and pasting the code shown.
Practicing with the Flash tools
Now that you’ve had a tour of the Flash tools and workspace, it’s time to take them for a test 
drive. In the following exercises, you’ll complete the illustration shown in l0102_ish.la 
while getting the feel for the selection, drawing, and transformation tools. You’ll also use Flash 
tweening to create your ﬁrst animation. 
The drawing and selection tools in action
Your ﬁrst steps will be to create and modify shapes and freehand artwork with the drawing 
tools, and then ﬁne-tune your work with the selection tools. The selection tools work as a team 
with the drawing tools to position and modify shapes, illustrations, and type. 
Follow these steps to use the drawing and selection tools
Step-by-Step
1. Choose File > Open and open the l0102.la ﬁle located in the ﬂ01lessons folder. 
2. Choose File > Save As; the Save As dialog box appears. In the Save As text ﬁeld, type 
l0102_work.la, then navigate to the ﬂ01lessons folder and press Save.
3. Choose the Selection tool ( ) in the Tools panel. This versatile tool can select, move, and 
manipulate objects directly on the Stage.

Animation in action
Flash is known for powerful, yet easy-to-use animation that you create directly in the 
Timeline. The Timeline displays content over periods of time, represented on the Timeline in 
frames. Each frame can be set as a keyframe, where items can be placed and animation can start 
or end.
Flash can generate animation with little more than a starting point and ending point; this 
method is known as tweening. You tell Flash where you want an object to start and stop its 
animation, and it ﬁgures out the frames in between.
Follow these steps to add animation to an object
Step-by-Step
1. Choose File > Open and, when prompted, select the l0101.la ﬁle in the ﬂ01lessons 
folder. Press Open. Two tortoises appear on the Stage. In the next steps you’ll animate the 
big turtle crossing the Stage.
2. Using the Selection tool ( ), click on the big turtle. Notice that the Big Turtle layer in 
the Timeline is highlighted in blue, along with the 60 frames included in the Big Turtle 
layer. Right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) on the big turtle and choose Create 
Motion Tween from the context menu (Figure 1-35). 
Figure 1-35: Right-click/Ctrl+click on the Big Turtle and choose Create Motion  
Tween from the context menu.
Motion tweens allow you to easily create animations by simply adjusting an object’s 
properties at diﬀerent points on the Timeline. Flash takes care of all the heavy lifting.
3. As shown in Figure 1-36, click and drag the playhead to frame 60.

Going beyond Flash with HTML5
Many Flash designers are expanding their skills to also include HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript for 
building highly interactive web pages and applications. This is especially necessary when targeting 
content for devices that don’t support the Flash plug-in, such as the iPhone, iPad, and Windows 
Phone, and likely future releases of the Android OS. 
Flash will continue to serve as a platform for gaming, video content delivery and web 
applications. Broadening your skills to include HTML5 and related technologies makes you more 
versitile as a designer or developer, and allows you to understand how to target your content 
for a wide range of browsers and devices. As a next step in your learning, after developing skills 
with Flash, you may want to look the HTML5 Digital Classroom, created by the same team that 
developed the Flash CS6 Digitial Classroom.

Lesson 2
Drawing in Flash
Adobe Flash Professional CS6 has many powerful tools to help you create vector-based 
shapes, paths, colors and patterns. Although Flash can work with pixel or bitmap images, the 
drawing tools in Flash create vector-based artwork that are much more ﬂexible to work with. 
Whatever you create with the drawing tools can then be animated using the Timeline. Tools 
used for drawing and creating shapes in Flash include Rectangle, Oval, Primitive shapes, Line, 
Pen, Pencil, PolyStar, 3D Rotation and Translation, Bone, and Bind. The Deco tool includes 
drawing eﬀects such as Particle System, 3D Brush, Decorated Brush, Grid Fill, Tree Brush, 
Lightening brush, and Building Brush. In this lesson, you will experiment with two diﬀerent 
drawing models that you can use to create artwork in Flash: the Merge Drawing mode and the 
Object Drawing mode.
Using the Merge Drawing mode
The default mode is the Merge Drawing mode. At ﬁrst, this mode may be diicult for new 
users to grasp, especially those already familiar with the drawing tools in Adobe Illustrator. 
In this lesson, however, you’ll see how the Merge Drawing mode oﬀers some unique beneﬁts 
over traditional drawing tool behaviors. To view the ﬁnished project as shown in Figure 2-1, 
choose File > Open within Flash CS6. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the ﬂ02lessons 
folder and select the ﬁle, ﬂ0202_done.ﬂa, then press Open. Keep this ﬁle open for reference 
or choose File > Close to close the ﬁle.

Lesson 2: Getting Started with the Drawing Tools 
Drawing in Flash
Creating artwork in Merged Drawing mode
In Merge Drawing mode, shapes can be easily torn apart like clay—strokes can be separated 
from ﬁlls (and vice versa) and you can create partial selections to break up your shapes even 
further. Most importantly, two shapes drawn in this mode will automatically merge when 
they overlap, making it easy to create complex combined shapes. Mergeable artwork is easily 
distinguishable on the Stage by its stippled (dotted) appearance. 
You’ll ﬁrst get familiar with how this unique mode behaves before diving into a more complex 
drawing lesson.
Follow these steps to create artwork in Merged Drawing mode
Step-by-Step
1. Launch Flash CS6 Professional, if it is not already open.
2. Choose File > Open and navigate to the ﬂ02lessons folder that you copied onto your 
computer. Select and open the ﬁle named ﬂ0201.ﬂa. You’ll start your artwork oﬀ with a 
basic shape drawn in Merge Drawing mode. First, you’ll need to make sure you’re in the 
right drawing mode.
3. As shown in Figure 2-2, select the Oval tool ( ) from the Flash Tools panel. This tool is 
grouped with the other shape tools, and you may need to click and hold down the mouse 
button on currently selected shape tool to select it.
Figure 2-2: Click your mouse button to reveal  
more shape tools under the Rectangle tool.
4. At the bottom of the Flash Tools panel, locate the Object Drawing button ( ) and make 
sure it’s not selected. This button controls whether or not you’re drawing in Merge or 
Object Drawing mode. When selected, the button appears shaded.
5. Next, you’ll choose your ﬁll (inside) and stroke (outline) colors. At the bottom of the 
Flash Tools panel, locate the color swatch marked with a pencil icon ( ) and click it. The 
Swatches panel appears—select black as your stroke color. Below it, click the color swatch 
marked with a paint bucket icon ( )—from the Swatches panel, select a light orange for 
your ﬁll color. Click the Reset button at the bottom of the Property Inspector to make 
sure the Oval Options are all set at 0.
6. Click and drag in the middle of your Stage to draw an oval—once you’re satisﬁed with the 
size and shape, release the mouse button. Switch to your Selection tool ( ) at the top of the 
Tools panel; this tool allows you to select, move, and manipulate items on the Stage.
7. Click once on the ﬁll (inside) area of your shape and the ﬁll becomes selected without the 
stroke (outline). Double-click the ﬁll, and both the stroke and ﬁll become selected. You 
can now move or manipulate the shape as one whole object. Deselect the shape by clicking 
on the Stage.

from the Tools panel on the right. You can leave your current color settings the same. 
Click and drag to draw a new shape that partially overlaps the ﬁrst. Once again, switch to 
the Selection tool.
10. Double-click the ﬁll of the new shape to select it (Figure 2-5), and pull it away from the 
existing one. You’ll notice in Figure 2-6 that the new shape has taken a piece out of the 
old one where the two overlapped!

Keeping panels open
As a default, Flash collapses panels after it thinks you are done working with them. 
You may find this to be inconvenient if you will be frequently using a panel. To have your panels 
remain open, choose Flash > Preferences (Mac) or Edit > Preferences (Windows) then uncheck the 
Auto-Collapse Icon Panels option.

In contrast to artwork created in Merge Drawing mode (referred to simply as shapes), Object 
Drawing mode provides more rigid control over artwork created on the Stage. Much like 
drawing shapes in Illustrator CS6, shapes drawn in this mode group their stroke and ﬁll 
together to avoid separation, and so partial selections are prevented. Drawing Objects give 
you the ability to stack and arrange shapes within a single layer, providing a deeper level of 
ordering amongst multiple pieces of artwork.
Follow these steps to work with Drawing Objects
Step-by-Step
1. Select a green shade from the Fill color swatch on the Tools panel. Click and hold your 
mouse button on the Oval tool ( ) to reveal the other shape tools, and select the Polystar 
tool ( ).
2. Locate the Object Drawing button ( ) at the bottom of the Tools panel, and click to select 
it. The button should be pressed in at this point, indicating that Object Drawing mode is 
enabled.
3. Click and drag to draw a new polygon on the Stage. As shown in Figure 2-7, you’ll notice 
the shape appears inside a bounding box. Switch to the Selection tool ( ) and choose Edit 
> Deselect All.
Figure 2-7: Drawing Objects appear inside  
of bounding boxes, and their strokes and ﬁlls  
can’t be separated.
4. If you click once on the ﬁll or stroke of the shape, the bounding box around the entire 
shape appears selected. Click and drag to draw a selection area (marquee) around part of 
the polygon, and you’ll see that partial selections also result in the entire shape becoming 
selected.

5. Double-click the ﬁll of the shape (Figure 2-8)—you’ll be brought inside the Drawing Object 
to edit its contents. Interestingly enough, the contents of the Drawing Object are simply 
the same, mergeable shapes you worked with in the last lesson. You can think of a Drawing 
Object as a container around a mergeable shape that keeps its parts grouped together.
Figure 2-8: Double-click inside  
the Drawing Object. 
6. Exit the Drawing Object by double-clicking on the Stage. Once again, return to the Tools 
panel and select the Polystar tool ( ). Click and drag to draw another shape on the Stage 
that overlaps the polygon you drew in Step 3.
Take Note...
You can also exit a Drawing Object’s Edit mode using the links shown above the Stage. 
Click on the Scene 1 link to return to the main Timeline, and you should no longer see the 
words Drawing Object appear to its right.
7. Choose the Selection tool and select the new shape. Pull it slightly away from the original 
shape—you’ll notice the two shapes did not merge as they would with mergeable shapes. 
Leave the new shape selected and make sure that it still slightly overlaps the ﬁrst polystar.

8. Next, you’ll see how Drawing Objects can be meticulously stacked and arranged, even on 
the same Timeline layer. With the new shape selected, choose Modify > Arrange > Send 
to Back (Figure 2-9). As shown in Figure 2-10, the new shape is pushed behind the ﬁrst. 
The Arrange menu allows you to restack Drawing Objects, groups, and symbols. Symbols 
are covered in more detail in Lesson 3, “Using Symbols and the Library.”

Take Note...
Mergeable shapes always fall below Drawing Objects, groups, or symbols on the Stage. To 
have a mergeable shape appear above other items, you need to place it on its own layer and 
move that layer to the top of the stack.

Now that you have a feel for how the two drawing modes work, you’ll complete a piece of 
artwork using your new skills and become familiar with additional drawing tools.
Follow these steps to create and modify shapes
Step-by-Step
1. Choose File > Open and navigate to the ﬂ02lessons folder. Select and open the ﬁle named

3. On the Stage, you see a single oval—switch to the Selection tool ( ) and click once on the 
oval to select it. A bounding box appears, indicating that this is a Drawing Object. A look 
at the Property Inspector conﬁrms this, as it should read Drawing Object at the top. 
4. In order to dissect this shape further, you’ll need to break it back down to a mergeable 
shape like the ones you created earlier. Make sure the shape is selected, and choose Modify 
> Break Apart (Figure 2-11). The shape now appears with a dotted pattern that indicates it 
is mergeable artwork.

Lesson 2
Using the Line tool
Most illustration programs have a Line tool, and while it’s not the most creative tool in the 
box, you can use Flash’s Selection tool to make it more useful. Flash’s Line tool allows users 
to draw straight lines in any number of directions.In the following steps, you’ll form the tail of 
your ﬁsh using a few simple moves.
Follow these steps to use the Line tool
Step-by-Step
1. Select the Line tool ( ) from the Tools panel. Make sure that Object Drawing mode is 
disabled (if necessary, deselect the Object Drawing button ( ) at the bottom of the Tools 
panel). Select Solid from the style menu on the Property Inspector to set a solid line.
2. Move your crosshair cursor close to the right edge of the oval, and click and drag to 
draw an upward diagonal line. Starting where your ﬁrst line leaves oﬀ, click and drag to 
draw a second line that meets the oval again below where the ﬁrst line began as shown in 
Figure 2-16.
Figure 2-16: With Snap to Object  
enabled and Object Drawing disabled,  
diagonal lines automatically join if drawn  
close enough together.
3. Where the last line meets the oval, click and drag to draw a diagonal line moving 
downward. As you did in step 2, click and drag where the line leaves oﬀ to draw a second 
line that meets the oval again. These steps should have formed a spiky tail that you’ll ﬁne-
tune in the next steps.
4. To change this from a spiky tail to a rounded, more appropriate one, you’ll use the 
Selection tool. Choose the Selection tool ( ), and move your cursor toward the middle of 
the ﬁrst diagonal line you created. Once you are close enough, a curved icon appears ( ) 
below your pointer. Click and drag upward to bend the line into a curve. As you can see, 
the Selection tool can also bend or reshape straight lines and curves.

5. As shown in Figure 2-17, repeat step 4 for each of the three remaining lines until the tail is 
formed.
Figure 2-17: The Selection tool can be  
used to easily reshape lines and curves.
6. Next you’ll need to ﬁll the two sides of your new tail. By default, shapes drawn with path-
centric tools such as the Line, Pen, and Pencil tools do not automatically ﬁll. To ﬁll these 
shapes, click and hold the Ink Bottle tool ( ), if necessary, to locate and choose the Paint 
Bucket tool ( ) from the Tools panel. 
The Paint Bucket tool allows you to add ﬁlls where none exist, or to change the color of 
an existing ﬁll. 
7. Click on the Fill color swatch at the bottom of the Tools panel. Choose the light orange 
color marked #FFCC00. (You can also type this in the text ﬁeld at the top of the Swatches 
panel to select the speciﬁed color.) As demonstrated in Figure 2-18, click inside of the tail 
ﬁns to ﬁll them with the selected color.

You can easily switch from any tool to the Selection tool by pressing the V key, without 
having to go over to the Tools panel.
What the hex is a hexadecimal code?
You may have noticed that each color you choose (including colors referenced in these lessons) is 
marked with a hexadecimal code, a 6-character code preceded by a pound (#) sign. A hexadecimal 
code is a binary representation of an RGB color, used to indicate colors within web-specific 
languages and applications (such as HTML, Dreamweaver, and Fireworks). 
Each byte, or pair of two digits, represents the red, green, and blue values for that color, 
respectively, from 00 to FF (in decimal notation, the values 0 to 255). For example, white in 
standard RGB values is notated as 255,255,255—in hexadecimal notation, #FFFFFF.
While it’s not at all necessary (and somewhat impossible) to memorize the hexadecimal values 
for every popular color, becoming comfortable with this notation will help you work your way 
through Flash’s color panels as well as those of other applications.
A helpful hint: the Photoshop and Illustrator color pickers also display a hexadecimal code for any 
color selected, making it easy to match colors between applications.

Lesson 2: Getting Started with the Drawing Tools 
Using the Pen tool
Using the Pen tool
For precision illustration tasks, you will most likely want to use the Pen tool. The Pen tool 
allows for point-to-point drawing, and precise control over curves and lines in between. 
You can even add or remove points to ﬁne-tune your work. If you’ve used the Pen tool in 
Illustrator CS6, you’ll already be familiar with the Pen tool and its related tools.
You’ll use the Pen tool to create ﬁns for your new ﬁsh in the following steps.
Follow these steps to use the Pen tool
Step-by-Step
1. Select the Pen tool ( ) from the Tools panel. In the Properties Panel or Tools panel, set 
your stroke color to black (#000000).
2. In the space above your oval, click and release the mouse pointer on the Stage to create 
a new point. Move your pointer to the left of the point you just created, and click and 
release again to create a second point. This point is joined to the ﬁrst by a new path (line).
3. Position your cursor above and to the right of your last point. Click and hold down your 
mouse button, and then drag to the right (Figure 2-21). This forms a curve between your 
new point and the last one. Once you’ve gotten the curve just right, release the mouse 
button.
Figure 2-21: Creating precision lines and curves  
using the Pen tool. 
Take Note...
You can create curves from any new point by holding down the mouse button and dragging in 
the direction you want to form the curve. (Be sure not to release the mouse button ﬁrst!)
4. Next, you’ll close up the shape. The next time you create a point, however, the Pen tool 
will attempt to draw a curve in the same direction as the last. To reset the last point drawn 
so that you can control the curve, click on the last point you created. 
5. Move your pointer over the ﬁrst point you created, and you should see a small loop appear 
below the pen cursor. Click and hold down your mouse button; drag to the right to form 
the ﬁnal curve, and release the mouse to complete the shape.

Lesson 2
6. As with other path-based tools, shapes created with the Pen tool do not automatically ﬁll. 
To ﬁll the new shape, choose the Paint Bucket tool ( ) from the Tools panel. In the Tools 
panel, make sure the Fill color is still set to the orange color labeled #FFCC00.
7. Click once inside your new shape to ﬁll it with the currently active ﬁll color. 
8. Now you’ll move the ﬁn into place and connect it with the rest of the body. Choose the 
Selection tool ( ), and double-click the ﬁll of the ﬁn to select the entire shape. Drag it into 
place at the top of the oval, slightly overlapping it as displayed in Figure 2-22. Click the 
Stage to deselect the shape; when you deselect the shape, the two become merged.
Figure 2-22: Move your new  
ﬁn into place above the ﬁsh body. 
9. The ﬁn should now be merged with the oval. As shown in Figure 2-23, use the Selection 
tool and click once to select the portion of the stroke that overlaps onto the oval. Only that 
portion should become selected. Press Backspace (Windows) or Delete (Mac OS) to clear 
away the selected stroke (Figure 2-24).

Using the Add and Delete Anchor Point tools
You can add or remove Anchor Points along existing paths with the Add and Delete Anchor 
Point tools. These tools are found under the Pen tool and enable you to further ﬁne-tune 
your illustrations. Vector-based objects are composed of paths that are connected using anchor 
points. You’ll add a bottom ﬁn to your ﬁsh by manipulating the existing oval shape that forms 
its body.
Follow these steps to use the Add and Delete Anchor Point tools
Step-by-Step
1. Choose the Subselection tool ( ) from the Tools panel. As shown in Figure 2-25, click on 
the edge of the oval; this reveals the points and paths that form this shape. From here, you 
can manipulate, add, or remove points along this path.
Figure 2-25: Use the Subselection tool to activate the points and paths that compose a shape.
2. Click and hold down your mouse pointer on the Pen tool ( )—this reveals the Add,

If you add the anchor point(s) in the wrong place, or add too many, choose the Delete 
Anchor Point tool ( ) and click on any point to remove it.
Figure 2-26: Use the Add Anchor Point tool to  
add two additional points surrounding the bottom point.
4. Choose the Subselection tool and, if necessary, click on the outline of your oval to 
reactivate the points and paths. Click the point at the very bottom of the oval to activate 
it—the point now appears solid instead of hollow.
5. Click and drag the point down and to the right, which extends that portion of the oval 
into a ﬁn-like shape, as shown in Figure 2-27.

create punches, crops, or intersections between overlapping shapes, and even lets you convert 
mergeable artwork into Drawing Objects.
Before you can perform any Combine Objects menu commands on a piece of artwork, it ﬁrst 
must be converted to a Drawing Object. To do this, you’ll use the Union command to convert 
your ﬁsh from mergeable artwork to a Drawing Object.

Lesson 2
Using the Primitive tools (Smart Shapes)
The Rectangle and Oval Primitive tools provide you with an easy and time-saving way to 
create common variations on these basic shapes. From rounded or scalloped rectangles, to 
double-radius ovals, these smart shapes are especially powerful, because you can continue to 
modify them long after they’ve been created.
Using the Oval Primitive tool
Your new ﬁsh needs an eye, and the best tool for the job is the Oval Primitive tool, which 
allows you to create complex variations on ovals and circles. 
Follow these steps to use the Oval Primitive tool
Step-by-Step
1. Select the Oval Primitive tool ( ) from the Tools panel. This tool can be found underneath 
the existing shape tools. From the Tools panel, choose black (#000000) for your ﬁll color, 
and set the stroke to None ( ).
2. Choose View > Snapping, and select Snap to Objects to temporarily disable object 
snapping. While holding your Shift key (to constrain width and height), click and drag to 
draw a small circle on the Stage. Switch to your Selection tool ( ), and position the circle 
above the spot where the eye should appear on your ﬁsh (a hole should appear there from 
the last exercise).
Use the W and H values on the Property Inspector to set the new circle’s size to 45 by 45.
3. In the Property Inspector, locate the three sliders at the bottom marked Start Angle, End 
Angle, and Inner Radius. Click and drag the Inner Radius slider toward the right, and 
you’ll see that it forms a knockout in the center of the circle. Set the Inner Radius to suit 
your artwork (Figure 2-39 and Figure 2-40 use a value of around 49). 
You can also enter a precise value in the text ﬁeld to the right of the slider.

4. Locate the Start Angle and End Angle sliders in the Property Inspector. Click and drag the 
Start Angle slider until its value reads somewhere between 40 and 45. You’ll notice that as 
you increase the angle, the circle forms a C shape—this slider tells the circle to begin its 
circumference (shape) at a diﬀerent angle, resulting in a partial shape!
5. You’ll now perform the same action for the End Angle. Grab the End Angle slider and 
drag it to the right until the value reads about 330 (Figure 2-41). The circle now ends at a 
diﬀerent location as well. As you can see in Figure 2-42, this can be very powerful in any 
situation where you need to create wedges or partial circle shapes without the need for 
complex punch or knockout commands.

Oval Primitive shapes
For each oval primitive shape drawn, you’ll see a discrete handle (it looks like an anchor point) on 
its right side (Figure 2-43). As an alternative to the Start and End Angle sliders, you can click and 
drag this handle in a clockwise or counter-clockwise motion to manually alter the start or end 
angle of the shape.

Lesson 2
The Rectangle Primitive tool
The close cousin of the Oval Primitive tool is the Rectangle Primitive tool, which gives you 
control over corner radii on rectangles and squares. Like the Oval Primitive tool, you can 
easily set values for a new primitive shape, and return to edit it at any time.
It’s time to give your ﬁsh a way to speak its mind, so you’ll create a basic word balloon using 
the power of the primitive.
Follow these steps to use the Rectangle Primitive tool
Step-by-Step
1. Choose the Rectangle Primitive tool ( ) from the shape tools group on the Tools panel. 
From the Tools panel or the Property Inspector, set a ﬁll color of white (#FFFFFF) and a 
stroke color of black (#000000).
2. Click and drag to draw a rectangle to the upper left of your ﬁsh. It’s okay if it goes oﬀ the 
Stage into the pasteboard. If you’d like to match the sample ﬁle, in the Property Inspector 
make sure the Lock width and height button ( ) is disabled and set the rectangle’s size to 
200 pixels wide by 130 pixels high. 
3. In the Property Inspector, locate the Rectangle Options section; you’ll see four text ﬁelds and 
a slider. Here is where you set the corner radius for all or each of your rectangle’s corners. By 
default, the four corners are locked together and use the same value.
Click and drag the slider to the right until the corner values read about 40 (Figure 2-44)—
you see in Figure 2-45 that the corners of the rectangle begin to round out.
Figure 2-44: Add a corner radius to the rectangle

rectangle begin to round.
Take Note...
To give each corner a unique value, click the chain link icon ( ) to the left of the slider to 
unlock the four corners. You can then type in a diferent value for each corner in its respective 
text ﬁeld.

Lesson 2
61
Lesson 2: Getting Started with the Drawing Tools 
Using the Primitive tools (Smart Shapes)
4. Next, you’ll modify the corner radius using a slightly diﬀerent technique. Instead of using 
the slider in the Property Inspector, you can grab the points adjacent to any corner and 
drag them to reshape the corner radius.
5. Switch to the Selection tool ( ), then click and drag the point in the upper-left corner 
of your rectangle to the left and right. As you can see in Figure 2-46, this modiﬁes the 
corners of your rectangle—move slightly to the right to reduce the corner radius.
Figure 2-46: Using the Selection tool can be a  
more tactile way to modify corners. 
6. Choose File > Save to save your work.
You’ll now add the stem to make this a true word balloon—however, you may have 
noticed that primitive shapes behave unlike any other shape you’ve used so far. While they 
appear to look and function much like Drawing Objects, they actually can’t be modiﬁed in 
the way that Drawing Objects can. 
Neither the Selection nor Subselection tool will allow you to modify them in the way 
you’ve been able to do with Drawing Objects and mergeable artwork. To accomplish this, 
you need to break the shape down to artwork that you can manipulate freely. Keep in 
mind, however, that doing this is a one-way street: You can’t convert a shape or Drawing 
Object back into a primitive shape once it’s been broken apart.
7. If it’s not already active, switch to the Selection tool ( ) and click once to select the 
rectangle primitive. 
8. You’ll now break this out of a primitive down to artwork you can manipulate further. As 
done with Figure 2-47, Modify > Break Apart, and the shape now appears with the dotted 
pattern that indicates it is now a mergeable shape. Keep in mind that you cannot go back.
Figure 2-47: Use Modify > Break Apart to  
convert the primitive shape to a mergeable shape. 
Choose the Subselection tool ( ) from the Tools panel and click once on the edge of the 
shape to reveal its points and paths.

Adding text to your artwork
Flash allows you to create and style text to include in your movies, which can also be 
incorporated into animations or rendered in 3D (see Lesson 4, “Advanced Tools,” and 
Lesson 6, “Advanced Animation” for more on this). There are three diﬀerent text types that 
can be used in Flash: Static Text (regular text), Input Text (form ﬁelds), and Dynamic Text 
(dynamically changing text from another source). In addition, text is one of a few objects in 
Flash that can have ﬁlters applied to enhance its appearance.
When creating text in Flash, you may want to consider using screen or web fonts designed 
for being displayed on a pixel-based screen for improved readability. Keep in mind that font 
sizes will look diﬀerent on each device so a minimum font size should be established. Sans-
serif fonts tend to display better than serif fonts especially at smaller sizes. Other variables that 
aﬀect readability are font color, alignment, placement of text, character spacing, line spacing, 
indentation, and anti-aliasing of fonts.
Flash Text: TLF & Classic Text
Flash uses two diﬀerent types of text—TLF and “Classic” text. The TLF Text engine 
superseded the Classic text engine in Flash CS5, and vastly adds upon the capabilities of the 
“classic” Flash Text tool. TLF Text boasts features such as multi-column text and threaded 
text frames, which most designers have become accustomed to working with in other Adobe 
applications such as InDesign and Illustrator. In addition, many subtle but advanced text 
options such as character rotation, vertical orientation, ligatures, typographic case, digit case, 
digit width, advanced kerning, tracking, leading, duperscript and subscript, discretionary 
hyphens, hypertext and baseline shift are now available through an expanded character options 
panel in the Property Inspector. Even more advanced features are provided including support 
for multi-lingual typography, right-to-left scripts, using XML to dynamically style text, inline 
graphics, support for tabs, CFF anti-aliasing, and embedded font support.

Lesson 2: Getting Started with the Drawing Tools 
Adding text to your artwork
You can continue to use Flash’s Classic Text option in the Property Inspector, but for the 
purpose of the following exercises you’ll be using the new TLF Text engine for all tasks.
In this lesson, you’ll use the Text tool to add and style some cool text inside your ﬁsh’s word 
balloon and alongside the edge of the Stage.
Follow these steps to add and style text using the Text tool
Step-by-Step
1. Select the Text tool ( ) from the Tools panel. On the Property inspector, use the drop-
down menu at the top to switch from Classic Text to TLF Text. Note that there are 
considerable diﬀerences in the options available in the Property inspector between classic 
text and TLF text.
2. Click once and drag within your word balloon to create a new text box that’s slightly 
smaller than the balloon itself. The box appears with a blinking cursor in the upper-left 
corner, indicating that you’re ready to type.
3. Type the words A Fish’s Story: within the text box as shown in Figure 2-49. Click and 
drag across all the text within the box to select it.

4. In the Property Inspector, locate the Character options, which include options to set 
Family (font), Color, and Size. Choose Arial (or equivalent) from the Family menu to 
change the typeface. Move your cursor above the Size value, and drag to set the type 
size to 24 points. As shown in Figure 2-50, click the Color swatch and set the type color 
to black (#000000). If desired, you can experiment with the options in the anti-aliasing 
drop-down menu to modify how the text will appear in the document. In addition to the 
Character options, you’ll also notice a Paragraph options section in the Property inspector 
where you can change the alignment of text as well as set indents and margins for the text.

options for your new text from the Property Inspector.
5. Press the Escape key twice to exit the current text box and make the Text tool active 
again. You’ll now add some text along the left side of the Stage for more visual impact. 
6. At the top of the Property Inspector, locate the Change orientation of text drop-down 
menu. Click it and select the Vertical option (Figure 2-51). This will create vertically-
oriented text next time you use the Text tool.

7. Click (but don’t drag) near the left edge of the Stage to create a new text box, and type the 
words Go Fish! You’ll see that the text now is created vertically alongside the left edge of 
the Stage.
Take Note...
You’ll notice that you’ve created text on the Stage using two slightly diferent techniques: 
Clicking and dragging to create a ﬁxed-width text box, or simply clicking on the Stage to 
create an expanding-width text block.. The former of the two will result in a text box that 
can take advantage of advanced type options and such as text-low, multi-column text. The 
single click approach is a good way to create single lines of text for more basic and aesthetic 
purposes. You can convert expanding-width text to ﬁxed-width text by double-clicking on 
the circle in the lower right corner of the text block. You can convert ﬁxed-width text to 
expanding-width text by double-clicking on the out port located in the lower right corner of 
the text block.
New: Text Ruler
When you create text boxes on the Stage, you’ll notice a handy ruler appears above it. As 
you can see in Figure 2-52, this shows you the width of your text ﬁeld and allows you to set 
margins and other properties by dragging the available markers at the top. 
Figure 2-52: A helpful ruler appears on  
top of text ﬁelds to set margins and size.
Working with Threaded and Multi-Column Text
Flash’s TLF Text Engine brings a wealth of capabilities to type, many of which designers have 
become accustomed to in other Adobe applications, such as Illustrator and InDesign. This 
includes the ability to ﬂow (thread) text across multiple text boxes, multi-column text and a 
variety of advanced character and paragraph options.
Next, you’ll add more text to your ﬁsh’s word balloon, and to catch the additional words you’ll 
add a second text box on the Stage. You’ll also take a look at splitting large blocks of type into 
columns for better presentation. 
Follow these steps to work with threaded an multi-column text
Step-by-Step
1. Choose Edit > Deselect All. If it’s not already active, select the Text tool ( ) from the 
Tools panel. Also, make sure that the orientation of your text is set back to Horizontal 
(select Horizontal from the Change orientation of text drop-down menu toward the top of 
the Property Inspector).
2. Click and drag in the lower-right corner of the Stage to create a second, empty text box (it 
should take up roughly the entire lower-right quarter of the Stage).

3. To resize the new text box, hover over any of the box handles on the sides or corners 
until you see a double-arrow. Click and drag to resize the text box until it’s just right. The 
dimensions used in Figure 2-53 are 276px by 163px. You can also easily resize a text box 
by using the Property inspector or the Free transform tool.
Figure 2-53: You can easily resize text boxes by  
dragging any of the four corners. 
4. Now, you’ll get some text to add to the ﬁrst text box in the upper-left corner. Choose 
File > Open, and browse to this lesson’s folder in the dialog box that appears. Select the 
story.txt ﬁle and click Open/Select to open it in Flash.
You may need to make certain that All Files are set to display in the dialog box of the 
Open window in order to view and select a .txt ﬁle.
5. Select all the text within the text ﬁle you opened by triple-clicking within any point in 
the document, and choose Edit > Copy or Ctrl+C (Windows) or Command+C (Mac OS) 
to copy the selected contents.
6. Return to your Flash ﬁle by selecting its tab at the top of the workspace. Your text tool 
should still be active. Click within the ﬁrst text box you created over the word balloon, and 
position your cursor following the words A Fish’s Story:. Choose Edit > Paste or Ctrl+V 
(Windows) or Command+V (Mac OS) to paste the text into the frame.
7. You’ll notice that the text is likely too long for the box, and gets cut oﬀ. You’ll also note 
a small box with a red plus sign in the lower-right corner; this is the text frame’s out port, 
and the red plus sign indicates an overrun, which means there’s too much text for the 
box (Figure 2-54). You’ll correct this by “ﬂowing” the text from this box to the one you 
created on the bottom right corner of the Stage.
Figure 2-54: The newly added text  
overlows the text box, indicated by  
the red plus sign in the lower-right  
corner.
8. Click on the red plus sign, which is the out port of the text box; your icon should change 
to show a block of text attached. You are now carrying the overrun text, and can place it, 
or “ﬂow” it to another text frame.

9. Locate the text box you created in the lower quarter of the Stage. Hover your cursor over 
the text box until you see a chain link icon ( ), and click. The text from the word balloon 
should now continue in this text frame, and you’ll see a line going from one to the other 
to indicate the frames are threaded together.
The ﬁnal touch will be splitting that new text box with some attractive columns. 
Displaying text in multiple columns is a clean, easy way to read large blocks of text, and a 
technique commonly used in print publications and websites.
10. Using your Text tool, click within the new text box you created on the lower-right corner 
of the Stage. In the Property Inspector, locate the Columns value under the Container and 
Flow options (the default value should read 1).
11. Click and drag over the columns value until the value reads 2. This will split your text box 
into two columns.
12. If you’d like to adjust the gap between the two columns, locate the gap width value 
directly to the right of the Columns value (the default value should read 20px). Click and 
drag to the left or right to decrease or increase the gap, respectively.
13. Choose File > Save to save your document.
Now, if you add text to the frame within the word balloon, the text in the lower corner of 
the Stage will continue to adjust as needed, and format the overﬂowed text into two nice 
columns!
Take Note...
Flash CS6 contains a powerful feature to help you check the spelling of text in a document. 
Simply choose Text > Check Spelling to begin spell checking the document. To reﬁne the 
parameters that Flash uses to check spelling, choose Text > Spelling Setup to display the 
options available to control the behavior of the Check Spelling feature.
Adding filters
To enhance the appearance of text, you can add popular live ﬁlters such as drop shadows, blurs, 
glows, and more. Filters can also be applied to other objects in your movie, such as button and 
movie clip symbols (covered later in this book). For now, you’ll add some basic ﬁlters to make 
your text stand out.
Follow these steps to add a ﬁlter to text
Step-by-Step
1. Switch to the Selection tool ( ), and click once on your text box in the lower-right corner 
to select it.
Take Note...
Pressing the V key while editing text simply types a v in the text box; it doesn’t switch to the 
Selection tool as anticipated. To exit a text box, use the Esc (escape) key, and then press the 
V key to jump to the Selection tool.
2. At the bottom of the Property Inspector, locate and expand the Filters section. (Try 
collapsing the Container and Flow options to give your ﬁlter options more space.)

Working with colors
Flash oﬀers a lot of options for creating, saving, and working with colors and gradients. In 
addition, the panels and workspace make it easy to choose and apply colors from virtually 
anywhere, or to save color sets that you can share between multiple Flash documents and 
projects.
Follow these steps to open the Color and Swatches panels
Step-by-Step
1. First you’ll want to make sure that the Color and Swatches panels are visible. Choose 
Window > Color (Figure 2-57). By default, the Color and Swatches panels are already 
grouped together.
Figure 2-57: The Swatches and Color  
panels are grouped together by default.
2. As shown in Figure 2-58, drag the panel group by its title bar over the Property Inspector

or strokes within your artwork. Flash supports linear gradients and radial gradients. Both types 
can include any number of colors.
Linear gradients (Figure 2-60) blend in a uniform manner and, as the name implies, in a 
straight line going in any direction or angle.
Radial gradients (Figure 2-61) blend in a circular manner, either from the inside out or the 
outside in (depending on your perspective, of course).

Step-by-Step
1. Choose your Selection tool ( ), and click once on your ﬁsh to select it. Choose Modify > 
Break Apart to separate the ﬁsh and its parts, and then choose Edit > Deselect All. Click 
once on the body of the ﬁsh.
2. Locate the Color type drop-down menu at the top-right corner of the Color panel. This 
allows you to choose a solid color or gradient for the currently active color. Choose Radial 
gradient (Figure 2-62) to set a radial gradient to your ﬁll. The ﬁsh displays the default 
black-to-white gradient.
Figure 2-62: Choose Radial to switch your shape’s  
ﬁll to a radial gradient.
3. At the bottom of the Color panel, you see the color ramp, which now appears with two 
color stops (sliders), one for each color that forms your gradient. You’ll need to assign a 
new color to each stop.

5. The position and distance between the two sliders determines the blend point. Moving 
one slider closer to the other changes the balance between the two colors. 
Click and drag the left slider slightly toward the middle—this makes the lighter orange 
more prominent than the dark orange.
6. To add colors to your gradient, you’ll add more color stops. Add a new color stop by clicking 
on the far left edge of the color ramp. A new stop should appear below the color ramp. 
Double-click the stop, and choose white (#FFFFFF) from the Swatches panel.
Now, you’ll save this gradient for use later on.

Using opacity with gradient colors
A cool feature in Flash is the ability to set a unique opacity level for each individual color in 
a gradient. This can create some interesting eﬀects, and add cool lighting-style eﬀects to your 
illustrations. In this next exercise, you’ll create and color some underwater bubbles using this 
interesting eﬀect.

Step-by-Step
1. Choose the Oval tool ( ) from the Tools panel. If it’s not already enabled, activate Object 
Drawing mode by pressing the button at the bottom of the Tools panel. 
2. From the bottom of the Tools panel, choose white (#FFFFFF) for your stroke color, and 
choose the black-to-white radial gradient preset for your ﬁll color.
3. While holding the Shift key down (to constrain proportions), click and drag to draw a 
small circle to the left of your ﬁsh. Leave the circle selected.

Organizing and layering graphics
Organizing and layering graphics
As you build more complex graphics on the Stage, you’ll want to position and layer them as 
needed to make your movie work for you, and to help you organize your movie. Some of these 
organizational elements include layers, folders, and labels. Flash gives you a lot of control over 
your Stage through a robust layer structure that you may already be accustomed to using in 
other Adobe design applications.
Working with layers
On a single layer, you have a great deal of ﬂexibility to arrange Drawing Objects and grouped 
graphics—however, as your artwork becomes more complex, you’ll want the power of layers 
to stack and arrange your artwork. In addition to controlling stacking order, layers let you 
hide speciﬁc graphics from view, and even lock those items from accidentally being edited or 
deleted.
You can think of layers as clear pieces of ﬁlm that you can place graphics on and stack together; 
each layer sits above another, allowing you to reveal the items below, but also to control which 
items appear above or below another. Each layer and its contents can be isolated in view, 
toggled out of view, or locked to prevent editing.
In the next steps, you’ll separate the graphics you’ve created so far onto individual layers for 
more control.
Follow these steps to add and name layers
Step-by-Step
1. To start, you’ll make sure that each set of graphics you want to assign to a layer is grouped 
or converted to a Drawing Object. This will make them easier to move and distribute. 
Verify that your word balloon (leave the text separate) is a Drawing Object by selecting it 
and viewing its info in the Property Inspector. If not, use Modify > Combine Objects > 
Union to convert it to a Drawing Object.
2. Double-click to select your ﬁsh and the gills, then hold down the Shift key and select the 
eye. Convert them to a single Drawing Object by choosing Modify > Combine Objects > 
Union. 
3. Shift+click to select the ﬁsh, the bubble, and the word balloon. Make sure to not select 
the text. Right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) on any of the selected items—a 
contextual menu appears.

the black beam to determine where your layer  
will be placed.
3. Drag the layer all the way up and release it at the top of the layer stack to move the bubble 
to the top. 
4. Locate the two column headers above your layers—one appears with an visibility icon (
) 
and one appears with a padlock icon ( ), which means that it is locked. Under the padlock 
column, click on the Text, Word Balloon, and Bubble layers to lock those layers (a padlock 
icon should appear on the layer). Leave the Fish layer unlocked.
5. Click the Text layer below the visibility column—a red X appears (Figure 2-73)and the 
text disappears. Toggle the layer’s visibility back on again by clicking the red X.

To lock all layers except for the one you’re targeting, hold down the Alt key (Windows) or 
Option key (Mac OS) and click on the target layer below the padlock column. All layers 
except for the one you clicked will lock. This also works for visibility!
Creating layer folders
As you accumulate more layers on the Timeline, it makes sense to try and group them logically 
so that you can easily view, lock, and hide related layers with a few clicks. You can create 
layer folders on the Timeline that can group several related layers together, making it easy to 
collapse, hide, and lock them as needed.
Follow these steps to create layer folders
Step-by-Step
1. Click to select the Text layer, which should currently be the second layer on the Timeline.
2. Locate the New Folder button ( ) below the layer stack, and click it once to create a new 
folder above the current layer.
3. Double-click the Folder title, and type Word Balloon and Text as the new name.
4. Click and drag the Text layer up below the folder and to the right and release it—as shown 
in Figure 2-74, it should now appear indented below the folder, indicating it is now inside 
the new folder (Figure 2-75). (Follow the bar—it should appear indented below the layer 
folder before you release the mouse button.) 
Figure 2-74: Move the Text layer below the  Figure 2-75: The Text layer should now

appear indented below the folder.
5. Repeat step 4 with the Word Balloon layer to add it to the new layer folder. If necessary, 
rearrange the two layers within the folder so that the text appears above the Word Balloon.

6. Collapse the layer folder and hide its included layers by clicking the arrow that appears to 
the left of the folder name (Figure 2-76). The Word Balloon and Text layers temporarily 
disappear from view on the Timeline.
Figure 2-76: Collapse or expand a layer (and  
its contents) by using the arrow shown to the

7. Choose File > Save to save your ﬁle.
You can now lock or hide all layers under that folder at once by clicking the layer folder 
under the Padlock and Visibility columns, respectively. To access individual layers again, 
simply expand the layer folder.
Take Note...
Layer folders can be created several levels deep, allowing you a lot of organizational control 
when you need it. To create a nested layer folder, select any layer inside of a layer folder and 
click the New Folder button below the Timeline.
Transforming graphics
Once you’ve created artwork on the Stage, Flash gives you a lot of options to transform: 
scaling, rotating, skewing, and tweaking graphics and colors. Transforming existing graphics 
is as much a part of illustration as building them, so in the next steps you’ll explore the various 
tools and panels at your disposal.
The Transform menu and Free Transform tool
The Modify menu at the top of your screen features a Transform menu, which provides 
shortcuts to many common transformation tasks as well as helpful dialog boxes. You’ll use this 
menu in the next exercise to tweak the size and rotation of your ﬁsh.
Follow these steps to use the transform menu
Step-by-Step
1. Choose the Selection tool ( ), and click once on the ﬁsh to select it (make sure its layer is 
unlocked).
2. Choose Modify > Transform > Scale and Rotate. This opens the Scale and Rotate dialog box 
(Figure 2-77), where you can enter values for Scale (in percentage) and Rotation (in degrees).
Figure 2-77: Choose Modify > Transform > Scale  
and Rotate to open the Scale and Rotate dialog box.

3. Type 75 for the Scale value, and 25 for the rotation value; then press OK to exit the dialog 
box.
4. Your ﬁsh now appears smaller and rotated slightly upward. Use the Selection tool to move 
your ﬁsh to the center of the Stage, closer to the word bubble (Figure 2-78).
To ﬁne-tune, you’ll use the Free Transform tool, which oﬀers a more tactile (but less 
precise) way of scaling and rotating your artwork.
Figure 2-78: Rotate the ﬁsh.
5. Leave the ﬁsh selected, and choose the Free Transform tool ( ) from the Tools panel. The 
ﬁsh now appears inside a black bounding box with eight handles.
6. Move your mouse pointer over the top-right handle of the bounding box until you see a 
double-arrow icon appear. While holding down the Shift key, click and drag the corner 
handle down and to the left to resize your ﬁsh slightly smaller (Figure 2-79). If the text box 
makes it diicult to select the ﬁsh, you may move the text to another location on the Stage. 
Figure 2-79: With the Free Transform tool, you can use corner handles to rotate or  
resize your artwork.
7. Move your cursor just above the same handle until you see the rotating arrow icon (
). 
Once this icon appears, click and drag in a clockwise or counter-clockwise motion to 
adjust the rotation of your graphics to your liking.

8. Choose File > Save to save your ﬁle.
Getting the (transformation) point
What is that mysterious white dot that appears in the middle of your artwork when you use the 
Free Transform tool? That’s your transformation point, which determines the point on a graphic 
from which scaling and rotation is set.
If you’d like to rotate a graphic around a different point than the center, for instance, you can 
move the transformation point to a different location within your graphic.
Figure 2-80: To do this, select your graphic with the Free Transform tool, locate the point, and click and drag  
it to a diferent part of your graphic.
The Transform panel
An alternative to the Free Transform tool and Transform menus is the Transform panel, which 
oﬀers many of the same features plus some additional options for skewing and transforming 
graphics in the 3D plane.
Follow these steps to use the Transform panel
Step-by-Step
1. Choose Edit > Deselect All. If necessary, unlock the Bubble layer for editing. Use the 
Selection tool ( ) to select the bubble graphic.
2. Select Edit > Copy and then Edit > Paste in Center to make a copy of the bubble. Repeat 
this to make a third bubble. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard or the Selection tool to 
arrange the three bubbles vertically to the left of your ﬁsh’s mouth. 
3. Select the bottommost bubble. Choose Window > Transform to open the Transform panel. 
Locate the horizontal and vertical scale values at the top. Click the Constrain button ( ) 
directly to the right, which will keep the horizontal and vertical values locked together.

to around 50 percent (Figure 2-81).
Figure 2-81: Use the Transform  
panel to precisely scale an object.
5. Select the next bubble above the last, and repeat the same technique from step 4 to reduce 
this bubble to 75 percent. This time, however, click and select the Skew radio button. 
Click and drag the horizontal (left) skew value until it reads -20 degrees(Figure 2-82). 
This adds a slight leftward tilt to the bubble.
Figure 2-82: Add skewing to an  
object by selecting it and using the  
Skew values on the Transform panel.
6. Select the top bubble, and click to select the Skew radio button. Click and drag the 
horizontal (left) skew value until it reads 15 degrees. Close the Transform panel.
Take Note...
To remove all the transformation values from an object, select it and click the Remove 
Transform button ( ) at the bottom of the Transform panel.
Transforming gradients
If you use gradients to ﬁll or stroke graphics in your movie, you can precisely position, scale, 
and modify them using the Gradient Transform tool. Because your ﬁsh and bubbles both use 
gradient ﬁlls, you’ll ﬁnalize your artwork with a little gradient tweaking.
Follow these steps to transform gradients
Step-by-Step
1. From the Tools panel, click and hold down your pointer on the Free Transform tool ( ) to 
select the Gradient Transform tool (
), then click on the body of your ﬁsh to select it.

2. A circular bounding box appears around your ﬁsh. Move your cursor over the center point 
of the bounding box until a four-way arrow appears. You can click and drag this point to 
shift the center point of the gradient. As shown in Figure 2-83, click and drag the point up 
and to the left—this helps to imply a light source coming from the upper left.
Figure 2-83: Move the point shown in a Gradient Transform bounding box to shift a gradient’s  
center point.
3. Locate the scale handle in the lower-right corner of the bounding box. Click and drag it 
inward to scale the gradient down inside the ﬁsh (Figure 2-84). This increases the presence 
of the darkest color that makes up your ﬁll.
Figure 2-84: Scale down a gradient using the handle shown. This also changes the perceived  
balance of colors.
4. Choose File > Save to save your ﬁle.
Take Note...
For linear gradients, the rotate handle allows you to change the direction of the gradient. This 
also works for radial gradients if the center point is ofset from the middle.

1. The default drawing mode for creating a shape is the Merge Drawing mode.
2. In Merge Drawing mode, strokes cannot be separated from ﬁlls, hence the 
reason for the name as objects remain merged after they’re drawn.
3. In Merge Drawing mode, overlapping shapes automatically merge, causing 
one to “knock” the other one out when removed.
4. You cannot change the stacking order of images if they are on the same layer.
5. A Drawing Object is locked, meaning that it cannot be broken apart into a 
mergeable shape.

Business case
You need to create an animated ad for a department store. Part of the requirements 
of this assignment is that the ad will have to rotate year round so the artwork will 
have to change in order to relect the appropriate season. You want to build this in 
an eicient enough way so that you don’t have to create multiple Flash iles, you’ll 
just swap the artwork as needed and output separate iles when inished. 
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
workspace. See “Resetting the Flash workspace” in the Starting up section of this book. 
You will work with several ﬁles from the ﬂ03lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that you 
have loaded the ﬂlessons folder onto your hard drive from http://www.wiley.com/college/sc/adobeseries. 
See “Loading lesson ﬁles” in the Starting up section of this book.
The project
You’ll be learning how to create symbols from existing artwork and reuse those symbols 
throughout your movie to build a web banner for a department store’s winter sale. After you 
build a layout for this season, you’ll be able to easily modify it for other seasonal campaigns 
using the symbol’s powerful swap and editing capabilities. Each exercise will introduce you to 
a new concept as you creatively evolve your ad campaign.

What are symbols?
Introduction to Adobe Flash Professional CS6

Lesson 3
What are symbols?
As you create graphics on the Stage, you’ll realize that you may want to reuse those graphics 
several times throughout your movie. Although you could copy and paste the artwork as many 
times as necessary, keeping track of each copy would be diicult because there’s no way of 
letting Flash know they are related. Modiﬁcations, such as an overall color or shape change, 
would need to be applied to each copy individually, taking up creative time and opening the 
door to inconsistencies in your movie.
A better choice is to use symbols: reusable graphics, images, and animations stored in your 
document’s library. You can create symbols from any graphics or imported images on the Stage, 
or from animations on the Timeline. A symbol is the original from which all copies are made; 
each copy of a symbol (called an instance) remains linked to the master symbol in the library. 
This allows for reduced ﬁle size, ease of editing, global editing and consistency, sharing between 
projects, and adding interactivity. Changes made to the original symbol in your library afect all 
instances of that symbol throughout your movie. Using symbols (along with templates at times) 
help to produce consistent elements in your Flash animations which improves usability for the 
user, and shorter development time and maintenance for you the developer. 
As described in detail in the sidebar, “Symbol-ism: the symbol types,” Flash uses three types of 
symbols: 
• Graphic
• Button
• Movie clip
This lesson focuses on graphic symbols only: you’ll be converting existing graphics to symbols as 
well as creating new symbols from the ground up. Lesson 10, “Creating Navigation Controls,” 
explores buttons, while Lesson 12, “Introducing Movie Clips,” covers the creation and use of 
movie clips—powerful symbols that can contain entire animations.

Lesson 3: Using Symbols and the Library 
A look at the Library panel
Symbol-ism: The symbol types
Each symbol type has different attributes and a unique purpose within your movie. Everything 
from basic graphics to full-blown animations can be stored as symbols in the library, making 
it easy to manage and build even the most complex movies. Each symbol is represented in the 
library and in the Property Inspector by a unique icon, so you can easily identify which symbol 
belongs to which category. Here’s a closer look at what makes each symbol unique:
Graphic ( ): Graphic symbols are the most basic of the three types and can contain graphics, 
type, imported artwork, or bitmaps. Use graphic symbols to store your artwork in the library 
or to get graphics ready for animation. Graphic symbols can contain other graphics, so you can 
make more elaborate symbols by converting groups of graphic symbols into a single, new graphic 
symbol. 
Button ( ): These symbols are designed for use as controls, and they contain multiple states that 
react to a user’s mouse interaction, including clicks and rollovers. You’ll learn how to create and 
work with buttons in Lesson 10, “Creating Navigation Controls.”
Movie clip ( ): Movie clips can best be described as super-symbols. They can contain anything 
from other symbols to full animations, even sounds and video. In addition, movie clip symbols 
have their own independent timelines, so they are capable of housing elaborate animations 
that can be treated as movies themselves. You’ll learn to create and work with movie clips in 
Lesson 12, “Introducing Movie Clips.” 
A look at the Library panel
Each Flash document contains its own Library, where you can ﬁnd images, sounds and video 
ﬁles that are being used in your movie. The library’s contents are displayed and managed in 
the Library panel. This powerful organizational tool lets you view, sort, edit, and return 
information on symbols. Located on the right side of the screen behind the Property Inspector 
in the default workspace, the Library panel is the store-all management system for symbols and 
imported assets. For a detailed list of the panel’s features, see the sidebar, “Library panel options.”

Delete: Deletes the currently selected symbol from the library. Choose Select Unused Items from 
the panel menu to highlight items that are not currently used by your movie or another symbol in 
the library.
Properties: Opens up the Symbol Properties dialog box for the currently highlighted symbol. 
From this dialog box, you can switch the symbol’s type or assign it a new name.
New Folder: Creates a folder in the Library panel into which symbols can be sorted. Folders can 
go several levels deep, making fine-tuned organization possible.
New Symbol: Creates a new symbol in the library and is the same command as Insert > New 
Symbol or New Symbol from the Library panel’s menu.
Panel menu: This menu features additional options for working with symbols or modifying the 
display of the Library panel. This contains advanced options for linking symbols to ActionScript 
or setting up shared libraries.
New Library Panel: Opens a duplicate Library panel. Use this if you want to display libraries 
from multiple open documents at once, or to create several different views of the library you’re 
working on.
Pin Current Library: Keeps the current library in view, even when switching between other 
open documents. The default behavior is for the Library panel to display the library for the 
currently active document only. This is useful if you’d like to copy symbols between movies and 
need to keep a previous library view available while you switch documents.

To open the Library panel, choose Window > Library or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+L 
(Windows) or Command+L (Mac OS). 
Figure 3-2: The Library panel is invaluable

Creating symbols
The ﬁrst step toward taking advantage of symbols is to add some to the library. You can create 
symbols from existing artwork on the Stage, or you can create blank symbols with the option to 
add content afterwards by clicking on the New Symbol button at the bottom of the Library panel..

Lesson 3
In this exercise, you’ll convert the six drawings on the Stage to symbols so you can store them 
in the library and reuse them several times throughout your movie.
Follow these steps to convert a graphic to a symbol
Step-by-Step
1. Using the Selection tool ( ), click and drag on the Stage and draw a selection area around 
the entire snowﬂake to select it.
2. Choose Modify > Convert to Symbol, or use the keyboard shortcut F8, to open the 
Convert to Symbol dialog box (Figure 3-4).
Figure 3-4: Choose Modify > Convert to Symbol to save any artwork on  
the Stage as a symbol in your library.
3. Assign the name Snowﬂake to the new symbol by typing it in the Name text ﬁeld. You 
can name symbols just about anything you want, but try to keep names short and intuitive 
so you can easily ﬁgure out what’s what when viewing the Library panel.
4. Choose Graphic from the Type drop-down menu.
5. Set the registration point for the new symbol by clicking the box in the center of the small 
grid shown on the right. Registration points serve as the handles by which you rotate and 
position symbols on the Stage. Registration point locations will vary, based on the shape of 
the artwork you’re creating; here, a centered point works best.
6. By default, the Folder is listed as Library root (Figure 3-5). This means that your symbol 
will be in the main Library, not in any folders; you can leave this for now. Once you create 
folders, you’ll be able to sort new symbols directly into a folder as you create them.

exactly where you left it on the Stage (Figure 3-6). Click on the Properties tab to bring 
the Property Inspector forward. Click on the snowﬂake to select it. A special Graphic icon 
( ) in the top-left corner of the Property Inspector will conﬁrm that the artwork is now 
an instance of the newly created Snowﬂake symbol (Figure 3-8). After it is converted to 
a graphic symbol, the snowﬂake should have a registration point in its center and a blue 
bounding box surrounding it (Figure 3-7).

using the corresponding names respectively. Leave the sandals design unconverted for now. 
When you’re done, look at the Library panel in Figure 3-9 and you’ll see that the artwork 
pieces have been added to your library as graphic symbols.

Take Note...
Don’t confuse symbols with Drawing Objects. Although both appear inside bounding boxes, 
only symbols are stored in the library and have all the advantages discussed in this lesson. If 
you’re unsure, select the artwork and use the Property Inspector to verify that what you’re 
looking at is truly a symbol instance, and not a Drawing Object.
What’s the point of registration points?
A symbol’s registration point determines the measurement point by which the symbol is 
positioned on the Stage. 
You specify a registration point when you first convert an object to a symbol, and you should 
choose a point subjectively based on the shape of the object. It is common to set a centered 
registration point (Figure 3-10) for objects that are round or symmetrical (such as the beachball), 
or a top-left registration point for text or symbols that have no real point of symmetry (such as 
the snowman). When you edit your symbol, you can change the registration point by moving the 
artwork around relative to the crosshair that appears on the Stage in the symbol’s Edit mode. 
Figure 3-10: Change the registration point.
Creating blank symbols
You can create symbols of any type even when existing artwork isn’t available. To do this, you 
can form an empty symbol, and add content later by drawing, pasting, or importing artwork 
into the new symbol. Here’s how:

You’ll notice that the Create New Symbol dialog box didn’t give you the option to specify 
a registration point. This is done when you paste, draw, or import artwork and position it 
relative to the crosshair in the symbol’s Edit mode. 
Whether you create blank symbols or convert existing artwork to symbols is completely 
up to you. Some designers prefer to have something tangible to work with before they 
create a symbol; others like to get symbols deﬁned ahead of time. 
Building artwork with symbol instances
With all the artwork added to the library as graphic symbols, you’re ready to start building the 
layout for the banner advertisement. You’ll ﬁnd that working with symbols will be essential as the 
theme for your banner evolves. You’ll soon discover how to easily place, swap, and update symbol 
instances to build and change the look and feel of your banner in a snap.
Positioning and snapping in symbol instances 
To get the Spacey’s ad banner started, you’ll create a patterned background using some of your 
new symbols. The lesson is already sized and has visual guides to help you. To more accurately 
position symbols on the Stage, you’ll use snapping. Snapping enables a magnet-like behavior, 
causing objects you move around the Stage to snap in place to guides, grids, or other objects 
when they are moved within a close-enough range of those objects.
Follow these steps to use snapping to position a symbol on the stage
Step-by-Step
1. Choose View > Snapping to open the Snapping submenu, and make sure the Snap to Grid 
and Snap to Guides options are checked (Figure 3-16).
Figure 3-16: Set up your Snap options under View > Snapping. 
2. Choose View > Grid > Show Grid to display the grid; in this document, it’s set with the 
gridlines 50 pixels apart. You can store unique grid settings with each document.

Editing and duplicating symbols
The beauty of working with symbols is that modiﬁcations to the master symbol automatically 
transfer to all instances throughout your movie. If you’re not quite happy with the snowﬂake, 
for example, adjust it once and the entire background changes because all symbol instances are 
linked. You can update symbols in two places: from the master symbol in the Library panel 
or from any instance of that symbol on the Stage (Figure 3-20). In this exercise you’ll explore 
both methods.

Figure 3-24: All snowlakes adopt changes made to the master symbol.
Editing symbols in place
The advantage to editing symbols directly from the Library panel is that you can focus on the 
symbol itself without the interference of other artwork on the Stage. Sometimes, however, you 
need to modify a symbol to better ﬁt with the artwork surrounding it. In these cases, you can 
edit the symbol in-place on the Stage to see it in context as you make changes.
Follow these steps to edit a symbol in place
Step-by-Step
1. Double-click one of the snowﬂake instances on the Stage. The other instances dim out 
because they are no longer selectable. The snowﬂake you chose, however, is editable as 
basic artwork, just as it was in the previous exercise.

2. Click on the Properties tab to bring the Property Inspector forward. In the Property 
Inspector, type 80 in both the width (W) and height (H) text ﬁelds to set the width and 
height of the snowﬂake to 80 pixels. Notice that changes also afect the dimmed instances 
that are visible in the background and that changing the size of the symbol afects its 
alignment relative to your grid. To compensate for this, use the Property Inspector to 
set the X and Y positions of the graphic to -40 each (Figure 3-25); this shifts the symbol 
instances enough to keep them each in their respective grid boxes.

Modifying individual symbol instances
What if you don’t want a whole new look, but you just need to make a minor tweak to a single 
symbol instance? The link between the master symbol and its instances may seem constraining 
at times. The good news is that it doesn’t have to be: Every instance of a symbol can be 
modiﬁed to take on its own color, dimensions, rotation, and transparency. 
To resize or rotate a symbol instance, for example, select the instance on the Stage and use the 
Free Transform tool, Property Inspector, or Transform panel. 
Follow these steps to modify a symbol using the Transform panel
Step-by-Step
1. Using the Selection tool ( ), select a single instance of your Snowﬂake symbol on the Stage, 
and choose Window > Transform to open the Transform panel, which allows you to enter 
exact values and resize and rotate a single instance of the Snowﬂake symbol. 
2. In the Transform panel, make sure the Constrain option is active, and type 80% in either 
the vertical or horizontal scaling boxes at the top of the pane as shown in Figure 3-27. 
Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).

Fine-tuning your background
You can take advantage of the unique characteristics that can be assigned to each symbol 
instance to add depth to your background. To make the snowﬂakes less obstructive to the type 
and additional artwork you’ll add later, you can reduce the transparency (referred to as alpha) of 
all instances on the Stage. You can also use the Property Inspector to apply varying color tints 
to selected instances.

Lesson 3
Duplicating symbols
Sometimes a variation on a theme is the best way to explore other possible design ideas. 
Perhaps you want to apply changes to a symbol beyond color or size (for instance, changing its 
actual shape). Rather than make edits that compromise the original symbol, consider making 
a duplicate of the symbol in the Library panel. Duplicating makes an exact copy of a symbol, 
and the new copy becomes its own symbol and is not associated with the original. Try creating 
a variation on the Snowﬂake symbol by duplicating it in the Library panel and making changes 
to the new copy.
Follow these steps to duplicate a symbol
Step-by-Step
1. Click on the Library tab to bring the Library panel forward. Select the Snowﬂake symbol 
in the Library panel.
2. Choose Duplicate from the Library panel menu as shown in Figure 3-37. The Duplicate 
Symbol dialog box appears, prompting you to rename the symbol and, if desired, change 
the symbol type.
Figure 3-37: Duplicate the symbol through the  
Library panel menu.
3. Name the symbol Snowﬂake 2. Leave the Type as Graphic as shown in Figure 3-38, and 
press OK. Flash adds the new symbol to the library. You can now use this symbol like any 
other, and it has no relationship to the original from which it was created.

Swapping symbols
Introduction to Adobe Flash Professional CS6

Lesson 3
Swapping symbols
Sometimes when you think you’re ﬁnished, you’re not—requirements change, new products are 
introduced, or those bright ideas you had in a late-night design session look dim the next morning. 
Symbols make such revisions easier; instead of starting from scratch, use the Property Inspector to 
swap any instance of a symbol with an instance of another symbol in the Library panel.
Consider your Spacey’s winter sale banner, for example. If Spacey’s wants a summer sale banner 
based on your successful winter design, you can easily reinvent your banner with a few quick 
symbol swaps.
Follow these steps to swap a symbol instance
Step-by-Step
1. Switch to your Selection tool, and click once on the instance of the Snowﬂake symbol in 
the upper-left corner to select it. Make sure the Property Inspector is visible.
2. Click the Swap button in the Property Inspector (Figure 3-46). The Swap Symbol dialog 
box appears, displaying all the symbols currently in the library. The Swap button lets you 
swap any symbol instance on the Stage with another symbol from the library.

Managing the Library 
As you use symbols more and more, you may ﬁnd the Library panel getting a bit crowded. 
Even with the panel’s sorting abilities, you’ll deﬁnitely need to get a handle on things with a 
bit of organization. The Library panel features several ways to clean house and make sense of 
your assets.
Organizing symbols with folders
Whether for papers in a ﬁle cabinet or ﬁles on your computer’s hard drive, folders play an 
essential role in categorizing and organizing content. Flash’s Library panel can use folders to 
organize symbols, sounds, and imported assets such as bitmap images and video. 
You can create folders using the New Folder button ( ) or by choosing New Folder from the 
Library panel’s menu. For very ﬂexible organizational possibilities, you can also nest folders 
inside other folders. Practice organizing your banner project’s symbols.

Deleting items from the library
Over the life of a project, many symbols and assets may accumulate in the Library panel, some 
of which may not even be in use. If sorting your symbols is not enough to tackle this problem, 
you may want to select and trash unused items to eliminate clutter and reduce the size of your 
.ﬂa ﬁle. Deleting unused symbols from the library is simple.

Symbols that include other symbols create dependencies; one symbol can’t be deleted without 
afecting the other. If a graphic symbol is composed of other graphic symbols, it requires those 
symbols to remain in one piece, like bricks that make up a wall. Always use the Delete 
Unused Items option to be sure; it accounts for symbols that are in use by other symbols.

Lesson 3: Using Symbols and the Library 
Wrapping up
Controlling library views
The Library panel’s menu features some additional options you can use to adjust the appearance 
of contents in the library. If you combine this with the panel’s sorting capabilities, managing and 
organizing the library will be easy, even with the most extensive Flash movies. 
Figure 3-58: Collapsed and expanded views  
can be easily shown and hidden using the panel menu. 
To expand all folders and view their contents, for example, choose Expand All Folders from 
the Library panel menu. To expand a single folder, select the folder and choose Expand Folder 
from the panel menu, or double-click the folder.
To collapse all folders and hide their contents, choose Collapse All Folders from the Library 
panel menu (Figure 3-58). To collapse a single folder, select the folder and choose Collapse 
Folder from the panel menu, or double-click the folder.
Choose File > Close to close the document.
Wrapping up
In this lesson, you’ve learned about the power of symbols, and how you can reuse, swap, and 
easily update artwork used throughout your design. As you’ll see in later lessons, symbols also 
play an essential role in creating animation and adding interactivity in the form of buttons and 
movie clips.

True/False
Circle T if the statement is true or F if the statement is false.
1. Symbols are not re-usable; they can only be used once per symbol. 
2. Symbols can be created from existing artwork on the Stage or you can create 
blank symbols with the option to add content afterwards.
3. The Pin Current Library button will keep the current library in view, even 
when switching between other open documents. 
4. One method to creating symbols is to select an object on the Stage and 
convert it into a symbol.
5. Don’t confuse symbols with Drawing Objects. Although both appear inside 
bounding boxes, only symbols are stored in the library. 
6. When editing a symbol, you cannot change the registration point after it’s 
been established. 
7. Symbols can only be edited directly from the Library panel, once they’re 
placed on the Stage, they are no longer editable.
8. Instances on the stage cannot have their color changed unless you change the 
original symbol it’s based on. 
9. Duplicating symbols makes an exact copy of a symbol leaving the duplicate 
tied to the original so if you change the original, the duplicates update to 
reﬂect the change.
10. Symbols allow you to use the Property Inspector to swap any instance of a 
symbol with an instance of another symbol in the Library panel.

Symbol Creation
Project 3-1
There are a couple of ways to create symbols and organize them. It’s good to understand these 
methods now so when the time comes to work on your big projects you’re focusing on more 
important things like animation. 
1. Create a new ActionScript 3.0 document in Flash. 
2. Select the Oval tool in the Tools panel, make sure Object Drawing is turned on. 
3. Select red for the ﬁll and None for the stroke color values. 
4. Draw a circle on the Stage and choose Edit > Deselect All. 
5. In the Properties panel, change the ﬁll color to green and draw a second circle on the 
Stage. 
6. Choose the Selection tool from the Tools panel, click on the red circle and choose 
Modify > Convert to Symbol. 
7. Name the symbol Red Circle MC and choose Movie Clip as the symbol type. Click OK.
8. Select the green circle and choose Modify > Convert to Symbol.

Symbols can pile up and get hard to manage when you start to get into a groove and end up 
creating a lot of them. Organize symbols using folders. 
1. You should still have the symbols.ﬂa ﬁle open from the previous project. 
2. Choose Window > Library. 
3. Click the New Folder button at the base of the Library panel. Rename the folder MC and 
place the movie clip symbol inside. Create another new folder called GFX and place the 
corresponding symbol into that folder as well. 
4. Save the Flash ﬁle as symbols_3.2.ﬂa, keep the ﬁle handy for the next exercise.

Sharing Symbols
Project 3-3
One of the great lessons with regard to Flash understands how to reuse and share assets among 
diferent projects you may be working on. 
1. Create a new ActionScript 3.0 document in Flash. 
2. Go to File > Import > Open External Library and ﬁnd the symbols.ﬂa ﬁle you created 
Projects 1 and 2. Drag the symbols you created to the new ﬁle’s Stage and note how things 
will transfer from one Library to the other. 
3. Keep the new ﬁle open for the last part of the exercise. Save it and name it 
duplicates_3.3.ﬂa. 
Duplicating Symbols
Project 3-4
Not only is being able to reuse symbols a power concept but so is repurposing them. You 
can do this easily enough by making a duplicate of the original symbol and then altering 
something like color but keeping the shape the same. 
1. The duplicates_3.3.ﬂa ﬁle should still be open from the previous project. 
2. Select the movie clip symbol in the Library and from the Library panel ﬂyout menu choose 
Duplicate. 
3. Name the new symbol Blue Circle MC and change as needed.
4. Save the ﬁle as duplicates_3.4.ﬂa.

Business case
West Portland Homemade Textiles wants an animated version of their mascot 
Stevie the Silkworm. The silkworm needs to be designed in such a way that it 
shows some of the textile patterns that the company has available. The silkworm 
also needs to move in such a way that makes it look like the real thing with one 
segment of its body moving in conjunction with the others. 
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
workspace. See “Resetting the Flash workspace” in the Starting up section of this book. 
You will work with several ﬁles from the ﬂ04lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that you have 
loaded the ﬂlessons folder onto your hard drive from http://www.wiley.com/college/sc/adobeseries. See 
“Loading lesson ﬁles” in the Starting up section of this book.

Lesson 4
The project
In this lesson, you’ll be creating an ad for West Portland Homemade Textiles (WPHT). 
Their mascot, Stevie the Silkworm, showcases a multitude of WPHT’s favorite patterns. 
Each segment in Stevie’s body will feature a diﬀerent pattern, which you will create using a 
combination of drawing tools. To see the ﬁnished ﬁle (Figure 4-1), navigate to the ﬂ04lessons 
folder and open ﬂ0401_done.ﬂa. Keep this ﬁle open for reference or choose File > Close to 
close the ﬁle.
Figure 4-1: Stevie the Silkworm is a handsome beast!
Working with gradients
The ﬁrst part of the silkworm that you will work on is his head. If you opened and viewed the 
ﬁnished ﬁle, you may have noticed the 3D appearance of this insect’s visage. While this object 
is not truly 3D in the technical sense, a little fancy footwork with gradients can go a long way 
toward adding depth to your graphics.
Follow these steps to create a gradient
Step-by-Step
1. Choose File > Open. Navigate to the ﬂ04lessons folder and select ﬂ0401.ﬂa. Press Open.
2. On the Stage is the West Portland Homemade Textiles logo and not much else. Choose 
File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the ﬂ04lessons folder and type 
ﬂ0401_work.ﬂa into the Save As text ﬁeld. Press Save.
3. Add a new layer for your caterpillar to separate him from the logo layer by clicking the 
New Layer button ( ) at the bottom of the layers section of the Timeline. Double-click the 
name of the new layer and type Stevie into the text ﬁeld that appears (Figure 4-2). Press 
Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to commit the change.

radial gradient in the bottom-left corner (Figure 4-3). You’ll adjust this gradient after you 
draw the oval.
Figure 4-3: Select the radial gradient swatch.
6. While holding down the Shift key to constrain proportions, click and drag to draw a circle 
below the logo (Figure 4-4). If you need to move it, or draw it again, use the Selection 
tool ( ) to select it and then click and drag to move it, or press Delete on your keyboard to 
remove it.

9. Close the Color panel and choose File > Save. 
Adjusting gradients with the Gradient Transform tool
Gradients are pretty hip, but you’ll probably want to customize more than just color. The 
Gradient Transform tool can help you exert some more control over the size, dimensions, 
and location of your gradient ﬁlls. 
Follow these steps to modify a gradient
Step-by-Step
1. Hidden under the Free Transform tool ( ) in the Tools panel is the Gradient Transform 
tool ( ). Choose the Gradient Transform tool, and click on the yellow circle on the Stage. 
Click and drag the center point down and to the right to oﬀset the gradient as shown in 
Figure 4-6.

Lesson 4
Flash CS6 tools for advanced drawing
Flash CS6 includes a number of tools that allow you to easily create eﬀects that would 
otherwise be labor-intensive to create from scratch such as the Symmetry Brush eﬀect when 
using the Deco tool, or even applying ﬁll eﬀects from the Properties inspector. In the next 
section, you’ll use a few of these tools to create sections of the caterpillar’s body. Perhaps more 
than any other features in Flash, these tools lend themselves especially well to experimentation. 
After you get a feel for the techniques in this section, you might ﬁnd yourself staying up way 
past bedtime making strange compositions to astound your friends and family. It’s highly 
recommended that you obey your impulses to do so.
Spraying symbols 
Using the Spray Brush tool in Flash, symbols can be creatively “sprayed” onto the stage and 
the properties of the symbols can be adjusted. 
For the ﬁrst section of Stevie’s body, you’ll use the Spray Brush tool to create a ﬁeld of stars, 
and then you’ll mask out a circular section of this ﬁeld. 
Follow these steps to use the Spray Brush tool
Step-by-Step
1. Choose Insert > New Symbol. Much like the head, each segment of the body will be a 
Movie Clip symbol. In the Create New Symbol dialog box, choose Movie Clip from the 
Type drop-down menu and type Segment1 in the Name text ﬁeld. Press OK.
2. All the items on the Stage disappear as you enter symbol-editing mode. Select the Spray 
Brush tool ( ), located beneath the Brush tool ( ) in the Tools panel. Click on the 
Properties tab to display the Property Inspector.
3. In the Property Inspector, press the Edit button in the Symbol section. In the resulting 
Select Symbol dialog box, choose the star graphic symbol (Figure 4-10) and press OK.
Figure 4-10: Select star from the Select Symbol dialog box.
4. In the Property Inspector, set the Scale width and Scale height to 50 percent. Make 
sure all three checkboxes at the bottom of the Symbol section are checked for Random 
scaling, Rotate symbol, and Random rotation. If you desire a more uniform eﬀect, these 
checkboxes should be left unchecked, but in this case you’re looking for maximum variety.

5. In the Brush section, type 200 in the Width and Height ﬁelds. Leave the Brush angle at its 
default setting (Figure 4-11).
Figure 4-11: Adjust the properties of the  
Spray Brush tool.
6. Click and release in the center of the Stage. Each click sprays a number of symbols in a 
radius dictated by the brush width and height that you set in the last step. Clicking and 
dragging allows you to paint symbols onto the Stage.
7. Use the Spray Brush tool to create a ﬁeld of stars (Figure 4-12). If you add too many stars, 
use the Selection tool to delete your work and try it again. In fact, try it a few times, 
even if you like the results of your ﬁrst attempt. It’s fun and easy, just like real spray paint, 
without the potential for legal trouble.

Lesson 4
Masking 
Most graphics programs support some form of masking. In Flash CS6, the implementation is 
fairly simple, but it can be a powerful tool, especially combined with animation. Masking is 
a way to conceal or reveal portions of artwork without actually permanently removing the 
artwork itself. Next you’ll mask out the ﬁeld of stars to ﬁnish the ﬁrst segment of caterpillar 
Stevie’s body.
Follow these steps to create a mask
Step-by-Step
1. Because you’ll be working with more than one layer, and their arrangement will be crucial 
to success, you’ll need to stay organized. Rename the default Layer 1, which now contains 
the ﬁeld of stars you created in the last section, by double-clicking on the layer name 
and typing stars into the text ﬁeld; then press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to 
commit the change.
2. Press the New Layer button twice, then rename the two layers, mask and background, 
respectively. Drag the background layer below the stars layer in the Timeline (Figure 4-13).
Figure 4-13: Add, rename, and rearrange layers.
3. Select the mask layer and choose the Oval tool ( ) from the Tools panel. At the bottom of 
the Tools panel, choose none for the stroke, and set the ﬁll to the blue labeled #6699CC.
4. Holding down the Shift key to constrain proportions, draw a circle over a section of the 
ﬁeld of stars (use the crosshair as your guide as you paint). Any stars outside of this circle 
will soon be invisible, so if you’ve grown fond of them, adjust your circle accordingly.
5. Choose the Selection tool ( ) and click on the circle. Choose Edit > Copy. You will use 
this copy to populate the background layer in a couple steps.

Figure 4-14: Mask the stars  
you created with the Spray  
Brush tool.
7. Select the background layer and choose Edit > Paste in Place (Figure 4-15). If the circle 
disappears, click on the Stage to deselect the newly pasted shape. This particular technique 
is often used in conjunction with masking to give an object a background color if the 
masked content contains transparent areas. 
Figure 4-15: Paste the circle  
onto the background layer to give  
Segment1 a background color.
8. Return to the main Stage by clicking on the Scene 1 link in the Navigation bar above the 
Stage. From the Library panel, drag an instance of the Segment1 symbol onto the Stage. Don’t 
worry if it isn’t the same size as Stevie’s head; you’ll adjust that in the next step.
9. Click and hold the Gradient Transform tool ( ) in the Tools panel and select the Free 
Transform tool ( ). Click on the Segment1 symbol on the Stage. Holding down Shift to 
constrain proportions, click and drag any of the corner points of the symbol’s bounding box 
toward the center or away from the center to make Segment1 about the same size as the 
head. Click and drag Segment1 into place, attached to the head as shown in Figure 4-16.

Lesson 4
Introducing the Deco tool
The Spray Brush is a great way to throw symbols all over the Stage, but what if you want 
to distribute a number of symbols in a slightly more structured manner? Flash’s Deco tool 
provides a number of customizable options for just this task. This tool allows users to decorate 
or paint using a number of diﬀerent ﬁll types while also allowing these ﬁlls to be animated.
Follow these steps to use the Deco tool
Step-by-Step
1. Click and hold the Oval tool ( ) in the Tools panel and select the Rectangle tool ( ). 
Draw a large rectangle on the Stage as shown in Figure 4-17. The dimensions are not 
too important, as you’ll be using the mask technique from the last section to create this 
segment. This rectangle is just to contain the results of using the Deco tool.
Figure 4-17: Draw a rectangle on the Stage to contain the next pattern.
2. Choose the Deco tool ( ) from the Tools panel, then click the Properties tab to access the 
Property Inspector. 
3. In the Drawing Eﬀect section of the Property Inspector, choose Grid Fill. For Tile 1 
press the Edit button and choose circPattern from the Select Symbol dialog box. Uncheck 
Tile 2, Tile 3 and Tile 4—you won’t need these because we are using just one symbol for 
the pattern.
4. In the Horizontal and Vertical spacing text ﬁelds, type 2. In the Pattern scale text ﬁeld, 
type 60. 

Lesson 4
137
Lesson 4: Advanced Tools
Flash CS6 tools for advanced drawing
5. Click inside the rectangle you created in step 1. A grid pattern is created inside this 
rectangle as shown in Figure 4-18. The Grid Fill eﬀect of the Deco tool is a handy way to 
whip up a grid of symbols; just be careful to ﬁll only within a shape unless you really want 
to coat the entire Stage.
Figure 4-18: Fill the rectangle using the Deco tool. Note that ill results will vary from  
shape to shape.
6. Using the Selection tool ( ), click on the rectangle and press Delete to remove it. Click on 
the grid of circPattern symbols, and choose Edit > Cut. The rest of the segments have pre-
created Movie Clips to streamline the process of ﬁnishing the project.
7. Double-click on the Segment2 Movie Clip icon in the Library panel to enter symbol-
editing mode.
8. Select the content layer and choose Edit > Paste in Center.
9. Choose Window > Transform to open the Transform panel. This panel is the counterpart 
to the Free Transform tool ( ). It’s a bit more precise, as you can plug in speciﬁc values, 
but the Free Transform tool is often more convenient for quick transformations. 
10. Type 25 in the Rotate text ﬁeld to rotate the ﬁeld of circles as shown in Figure 4-19. Close 
the Transform panel and view the change (Figure 4-20).

Step-by-Step
1. Once again, you’ll be using a Movie Clip with mask and background layers already 
created to streamline the process. Double-click the Segment3 movie clip in the Library to 
enter symbol-editing mode.
2. Select the content layer. The other layers are locked and invisible to keep them out of the 
way until you need them.
3. Select the Deco tool ( ) and click on the Properties tab to access the Property Inspector. 
From the drop-down menu in the Drawing Eﬀect section, choose Symmetry Brush. 
4. Press the Edit button and select the circle graphic symbol from the Select Symbol dialog

below in Figure 4-22. Be careful to not click at the intersection of the green lines. The 
Rotate Around option allows you to easily draw a circle of symbols. 
Figure 4-22: Drag to create a circular  
arrangement of eight circles.
7. Choose the Selection tool ( ) from the Tools panel. Click on the shape you created in the 
last step. You’ll be using this shape to draw a more complex shape with the Deco tool, 
and so you’ll need to convert it to a symbol. Choose Modify > Convert to Symbol. In the 
Convert to Symbol dialog box, choose Graphic from the Type drop-down menu, and type 
halo in the Name text ﬁeld. Press OK.
Take Note...
When you draw with the Deco tool, you are creating groups. If you want to modify or swap 
parts of these groups, you can always choose Modify > Break Apart to break the group down 
to individual symbols.
8. Press Delete to remove the newly minted symbol from the Stage.
9. Select the Deco tool from the Tools panel. The Drawing Eﬀect drop-down menu should 
still be set to Symmetry Brush. Click on the Edit button and select the halo symbol from 
the Select Symbol dialog box. Click OK.
10. In the Advanced Options section, choose Grid Translation from the drop-down menu. 
When the graph lines appear on the Stage, drag them by the intersection point to the 
center of the Stage.

Lesson 4
11. Click and drag from this intersection point until four instances of the halo symbol appear 
(Figure 4-23). The Art Deco tool is very sensitive so place your cursor lightly on the green 
graph lines, small movements will create very diﬀerent eﬀects. We found putting the 
cursor on the horizontal axis of the green graph lines worked well.
Figure 4-23: Drag four halos out onto the grid.
12. Change the Stage view to 50% by choosing 50% from the drop-down menu in the top-
right corner of the work area. 
13. Place your cursor on the circle on the far right of the horizontal graph line. Click and drag 
to the right to extend the graph line, as you do this, you create additional columns of the 
symbol, drag until there are four columns of circles. Now click and drag the circle at the 
top of the vertical graph line and drag upwards, this creates additional rows. Using these 
techniques you should make a 4-row by 4-column pattern. Now locate the small circle at 
the intersection of the graph, it has a small curved arrow. Drag this straight up to adjust 
the angle of the patterns (Figure 4-24).

Introduction to IK tools
Introduction to IK tools
Inverse Kinematics (IK) is used by 3D and character animators to help achieve more realistic 
motion, especially with jointed ﬁgures. Flash CS6 includes the Bone tool to add a skeletal 
structure to a group of symbols. In Lesson 6, “Advanced Animation,” you’ll explore animating 
with this feature; for now, you’ll get your feet wet by making the caterpillar poseable. 
Follow these steps to use the IK tools
Step-by-Step
1. Choose the Bone tool ( ) from the Tools panel. 
2. Click and drag from the center of Stevie’s head to the center of Segment1. When you 
release the mouse, a bone is added, connecting Stevie’s head to the ﬁrst section of his 
bodyas shown in Figure 4-28. As you may know from personal experience, bones can be a 
great way to keep your body from falling apart. 
Figure 4-28: Use the Bone tool to connect Stevie’s segments.
3. Still using the Bone tool, click and drag from the end of the last bone, to the center of 
Segment2. Do the same from Segment2 to Segment3.

Business case
Now that you’ve learned the basics of animation, you’ll need to learn how to reﬁne 
animation so that you can control things like speed and direction to simulate more 
realistic movement in terms of how objects move in real life. In order to do that, 
you’ll have to learn how to move objects along curved paths and how to control the 
animation in terms of speed and velocity. 
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
workspace. See “Resetting the Flash workspace” in the Starting up section of the book. 
You will work with several ﬁles from the ﬂ05lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that you have 
loaded the ﬂ05lessons folder onto your hard drive from http://www.wiley.com/college/sc/adobeseries. 
See “Loading lesson ﬁles” in the Starting up section of the book.

Introducing keyframes and the Timeline
Introduction to Adobe Flash Professional CS6
150
Lesson 5
The project
In this project, you’ll be creating an animated web banner for a client. When deciding if 
content should even be implemented using rich media you should consider eﬀective methods 
to include audio and video in a project. Also consider how you’ll show continuity and 
transitions of animations and how you might incorporate multiple levels of information in a 
transition to convey your message. The Timeline allows you to illustrate change over time 
and allows you to get layers of information from one side of the screen to the other which 
enriches graphical representations, consider how you’ll accomplish this with your content. If 
you have 3-dimensional structures, think about how you’ll visualize these on screen and how 
you’ll attract attention to diﬀerent elements and create interaction. Always consider any cross-
platform issues as well.
To see a completed example of the animated web banner you’ll be creating, launch Flash, open 
the ﬂ0501_done.ﬂa ﬁle, and choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional to preview 
the ﬁnal banner. Close the Flash Player and return to Flash Professional CS6 when you’re done.
Introducing keyframes and the Timeline
One of the most important panels in the Flash workspace is the Timeline, which is where 
graphics, text, and media are sequenced and animation is created. The Timeline allows you to 
have items appear, disappear, or change appearance and position at diﬀerent points in time, and 
also provides additional features for controlling an animation such as Onion Skin. 
The Timeline consists of three main components: layers, frames, and keyframes. 
Layers
Layers enable you to stack and organize your graphics, media, and animations separately from 
one another, thereby giving you greater control over your project elements. You can also lock 
content on a layer to prevent the accidental editing of content on that layer. If you’ve used 
other design applications such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator, it’s likely that you’ve worked 
with layers before.
Flash also utilizes special types of layers for tasks such as tweening (animation), masking, and 
Inverse Kinematics, which you’ll explore in this lesson and the next.
Frames and keyframes
On the Flash Timeline, time is represented by frames, which are displayed as small boxes 
across each layer of the Timeline and helps you to control the duration of an animation. Time 
is subdivided into frames based on your frame rate and the number for each frame can be seen 
at the top of the Timeline. In a document set to the default frame rate of 24 fps (frames per 
second), every 24 frames on your Timeline represent one second of playback in your movie.
The playhead, shown as a vertical red beam, passes each frame when a movie plays back, much 
like movie ﬁlm passing in front of a projector bulb. You can drag the playhead sideways to 
scrub through an animation to see how it looks. To see several frames before and after the 
playhead while dragging, turn on the Onion Skin option at the very bottom of the Timeline 
by clicking on it. Click it again to turn it oﬀ.
When you decide you want to place a graphic, play a sound, or start an animation at a speciﬁc 
point along the Timeline, you must ﬁrst create a keyframe. Keyframes are created to mark 
signiﬁcant points along the Timeline where content can be placed. A keyframe can extend 
across the Timeline as long as you need it to keep its contents in view. By default, each new

Lesson 5: Creating Basic Animation
Introducing keyframes and the Timeline
layer on the Timeline contains a single keyframe at frame 1. At times, you may also create a 
blank keyframe which is a keyframe that contains no artwork. This is useful in a number of 
diﬀerent scenarios but one example would be if you are going to paste content on the blank 
keyframe instead of having artwork automatically appear there.
The best way to understand the Timeline is to dive right in and work with it. In this next 
exercise, you’ll sequence some items across the Timeline and work with layers to get started.
Follow these steps to work with keyframes and layers
Step-by-Step
1. Choose File > Open, and locate and select the lesson ﬁle named ﬂ0501.ﬂa located in the 
ﬂ05lessons folder. Choose Open to open the ﬁle.
Examine the Stage, and you see an airplane graphic along with two pieces of text that read 
Takeof and Landing. In addition to the background layer and diagram layer (which you’ll 
use as a visual aid later on), each of these items sits on its own named layer.
Note the frame ruler at the top of the Timeline, which marks frame numbers in 5-frame 
increments.
2. Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the ﬂ05lessons folder and 
type ﬂ0501_work.ﬂa in the Save As text ﬁeld. Press Save.
3. Let’s get a feel for sequencing items across the Timeline. Click directly on the Timeline on 
the Airplane layer at frame 15 to select that frame (it should appear highlighted in blue in 
Figure 5-1).
Figure 5-1: Select a frame directly on the layer to insert a keyframe at that position.
4. Right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) and choose Insert Keyframe to insert a 
new keyframe at this frame (Figure 5-2). The new keyframe appears with a border and 
bullet as shown in Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-2: Insert a new keyframe.  
Figure 5-3: See the new keyframe on the Airplane layer.
Notice that the airplane on the previous keyframe (frame 1) has been duplicated on the 
new keyframe—you can now reposition this airplane on the Stage. However, you ﬁrst 
need to extend the Background and Diagram layers so you can use them for reference.

Lesson 5
5. Select frame 30 on the Background layer, then right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click 
(Mac OS) and choose Insert Frame from the contextual menu that appears. This extends 
the Background layer up until frame 30.
Repeat step 5 for the Diagram layer so that it also extends up until frame 30.
Here, you added frames on the Diagram and Background layer to extend them up until 
frame 30 as shown in Figure 5-4.
Figure 5-4: Add frames after a keyframe to extend it further along the Timeline.
6. Click on the Airplane layer and select keyframe 15. Using the Selection tool ( ), grab the 
airplane that appears selected on the Stage, and drag it to the top-middle of the Stage. Use 
the Diagram layer as a reference.
7. Select frame 30 on the Airplane layer. Right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) on 
the selected frame, and select Insert Keyframe to add a keyframe at this position. Once 
again, the airplane from the previous keyframe is duplicated on this new keyframe.
8. Click on the Airplane layer and select keyframe 30. Using the Selection tool, grab the 
airplane that appears selected on the Stage, and drag it to the left edge of the Stage just 
above the ground. Again, use the dotted line and airplane images on the Diagram layer as 
a reference (Figure 5-5).
Figure 5-5: Move the airplane along the Stage.
9. Click on frame 1 of any Layer to bring your playhead back to the beginning of the movie. 
Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to play back your Timeline so far. 
10. On the Landing layer, the text sits in the correct position but appears far too early in the 
movie. It shouldn’t appear until frame 30, where the plane actually lands. Rather than 
create a new keyframe, you simply move the existing one by dragging it to a new location 
along the Timeline.

Introducing keyframes and the Timeline
Click on the keyframe at frame 1 of the Landing layer to select it. Move your pointer over 
the frame again until a small white box appears below your cursor. Click, hold down your 
mouse button, drag the keyframe right, and release it at frame 30 as shown in Figure 5-6.
Figure 5-6: You can click and drag a selected keyframe to reposition on  
the Timeline.
11. The ﬁnishing touch is to ensure that the Takeoﬀ text hangs out on the Timeline just a bit 
longer. You’ll use the same technique you used to extend the Background and Diagram 
layers.
Click and select frame 15 on the Takeoﬀ layer. Right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac 
OS) on the selected frame, and choose Insert Frame to add a frame and extend the ﬁrst 
keyframe up to frame 15.
12. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to play your Timeline back. The airplane 
should appear in three diﬀerent positions, and the text should appear and disappear at 
diﬀerent points. Figure 5-7 shows the ﬁnal Timeline as it should appear.
Figure 5-7: The ﬁnal Timeline as it should appear in your ﬁle.
13. Choose File > Save to save your movie, then choose File > Close to close the ﬁle.

Building animation: Enter the tween
Introduction to Adobe Flash Professional CS6
154
Lesson 5
Building animation: Enter the tween
Flash’s strength lies in its ability to create automatically generated animations, or tweens, 
making it easy and intuitive to get things moving on your Stage. You simply need to let Flash 
know where an object needs to start and where it needs to end using keyframes, and Flash 
draws the frames in-between, saving you the painstaking work of creating dozens of frames by 
hand and moving or manipulating the artwork in small steps.
There are two types of tweens you can create on the Timeline: motion tweens and shape 
tweens. In the following steps, you’ll focus on getting objects moving with motion tweens and 
tween layers.
Tween layers and automatic keyframing
The animation engine in Flash is designed to make creating animation easy and intuitive for 
new and existing Flash users. The heart of animation in Flash is the tween span, a single sequence 
of frames that can include any number of movements and tweens on a single object. Flash can 
create both shape tweens and motion tweens, both of which are considered keyframe animation 
techniques.
Within a single tween span, you only need to move or modify an object at a certain point in 
time, and Flash automatically creates keyframes to mark those movements where they occur on 
the Timeline. A layer that contains one or more tween spans is called a tween layer.
New Term: Motion Tween
A motion tween is an automatic animation performed on a symbol instance that can incorporate 
changes in position, scale, size, color effects, and filters. To create a motion tween, you right-click 
(Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) a keyframe that contains a single symbol instance and choose 
Create Motion Tween from the contextual menu that appears.
It’s time to dive right in and get things moving on your Stage:
Follow these steps to create motion tweens to animate an object

Lesson 5: Creating Basic Animation
Building animation: Enter the tween
3. Let’s begin with the Airplane layer—you’ll want to move the airplane as you did in the 
previous exercise, but have it animate its movement from place to place. Right-click 
(Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) on the ﬁrst frame of this layer and choose Create 
Motion Tween as shown in Figure 5-8. A 24-frame tween span is created on this layer.
Figure 5-8: Right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) on a keyframe to create a motion tween.
4. To create animation, you simply need to move the playhead to a position on the Timeline 
and change the appearance or position of the graphic at that point in time. In this case, the 
goal is to get the airplane to the middle position at frame 15. To do this, click and drag the 
playhead to the frame 15 marker. Using the Selection tool ( ), click and drag the airplane 
graphic to the middle position (using the diagram layer as a reference). Notice that a black dot 
marks an automatically created keyframe at this position.
5. You’ll see a line appear on the Stage that outlines the motion of the airplane—this is 
referred to as a Motion Path. Click to select frame 1 on the Timeline ruler to return your 
playhead to the beginning of the movie, and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) 
to play back your Timeline—you should see your airplane glide from one place to another 
(Figure 5-9)!
Figure 5-9: A motion path is created when you move an object within a tween span.

Lesson 5
6. The next step is to get your airplane from the middle position to its ﬁnal position on the 
left. To create an even number of frames for each movement, you’re going to need to 
extend the tween span a bit. Move your mouse pointer over the last frame of the tween 
span (directly over the layer itself) until you see a double-arrow icon (
). Click and drag 
to the right to stretch the span until it ends at frame 30 as shown in Figure 5-10.
Figure 5-10: Extend or trim a tween span by clicking and dragging the last frame of the tween span.
Take Note...
You may notice that keyframe 15 moved slightly when you adjusted the length of the tween 
span. Keyframes shift as you readjust the length of a tween span; this is okay to leave as is.
7. On the frame ruler at the top, click on frame 30 to jump the playhead to this position. Select 
the airplane, being careful not to click on the small circle in the center and drag it to the left 
side of the Stage to the landing position (using the diagram layer as a reference). Another 
keyframe is created at this position in the tween span to mark the change.
8. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to play back the Timeline, and you see your 
airplane glide from place to place.
9. You can view the ﬁnished Timeline in Figure 5-11. Choose File > Save. Leave the ﬁle 
open.

Lesson 5: Creating Basic Animation
Tweening multiple objects
The Tween rules
It most certainly does, but in this case, it refers to some rules that apply when creating motion 
tweens and tween spans on the Timeline.
• The length of any new tween span, by default, matches the frame rate of your movie. A movie 
at the default 24 fps frame rate will create 24-frame tween spans, and a movie at 30 fps will 
create 30-frame tween spans.
• To be included in a tween span, a graphic, text, or imported bitmap image must be converted 
to a symbol first. If you attempt to create a motion tween on a non-symbol, Flash will prompt 
you to convert the item to a symbol on the spot.
• Only one symbol or graphic can be tweened at a time. If you attempt to apply a motion tween 
to a layer with several objects, Flash will prompt you to convert the graphics to a single symbol.
• Tween spans can include changes to position, size/scale, color effects, and filters (for movie clips 
and buttons). To morph the shape of an object, you’ll use shape tweens (discussed later in this 
lesson).
• Tween errors generally occur when you attempt to tween incorrect elements in Flash. A tween 
error is apparent when the tween in the timeline is dotted instead of a solid line. In the case of a 
shape tween, this usually occurs when you are trying to tween something other than a shape. In 
the case of a motion tween, you need to be working with symbols. To resolve the tween error, 
simply change the object to the appropriate type and the tween should repair itself. If it doesn’t, 
delete the tween and recreate it.
Tweening multiple objects
To tween multiple graphics simultaneously, you simply need to place each one on its own 
individual layer. Each animated item will always need to have a dedicated tween span and 
tween layer. In this exercise you’ll add layers to animate the shadow and text elements to 
complete the scene.
Follow these steps to tween multiple graphics
Step-by-Step
1. Select the ﬁrst keyframe of the Shadow layer. Right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) 
on this keyframe and choose Create Motion Tween from the menu that appears. A tween span 
is created on this layer, and the shadow graphic is ready to be tweened.
2. Click on the Timeline ruler and drag the playhead to frame 15 as shown in Figure 5-12. 
At this frame, use the Selection tool ( ) to select and move the shadow so it sits below your 
airplane (using the diagram as a guide).
Figure 5-12: Create a tween span on the Shadow layer, and reposition the shadow on frame 15.
3. Move your mouse pointer over the last frame of the new tween span, and click and drag it 
to extend it to frame 30 (it should be as long as the airplane layer’s tween span).

Take Note...
A tween layer won’t allow you to place or draw additional graphics on it once it’s been 
created. You will get a warning dialog box if you attempt to add content to an existing tween 
layer.
Previewing animation with Test Movie
Pressing Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) (referred to as Live Preview) is a quick way 
of seeing your animation as you build it, but the performance of your animation is based 
on many factors, including frame rate, the complexity of Stage graphics, and the number of 
simultaneous animations running on the Stage at once.
To get a more accurate picture of your animation as your end user will see it, use the Control 
menu’s Test Movie command. This command temporarily publishes your movie and displays 
it as your user will see it in the Flash Player.

You may have noticed that your Diagram layer never shows in the ﬁnal, published movie. 
The Diagram layer is a special type of layer called a Guide, whose contents are used strictly 
for visual reference and don’t publish to your ﬁnal movie. You can convert any standard layer 
to a Guide layer.
Generally, performance will be better in the Flash Player as you’re viewing a ﬂattened and 
optimized version of your movie.

You can use Ctrl+Enter (Windows) or Command+Return (Mac OS) as a shortcut 
instead of Control > Test Movie. This shortcut key combination will be used several times 
throughout the lesson.
Moving and transforming tween paths
Once a tween has been created, you may decide that the entire animation needs to be 
repositioned or shifted. Thanks to the motion paths that appear on the Stage, this task is easier 
than ever. Because the motion paths are vector-based Bezier controls, they can easily be adjusted.
Follow these steps to move and transform tween paths
Step-by-Step
1. Click the Shadow layer in the Timeline and locate the motion path that your shadow 
graphic follows along the bottom of the Stage.
2. Using the Selection tool ( ), click once on the motion path to select it in its entirety.

3. Click anywhere on the motion path and then drag it straight down—this moves the path 
and the entire animation along with it. Move it down until the bottom of the motion path 
touches the bottom of the Stage (Figure 5-14). Note that you can disregard the positioning 
shown on the Diagram layer at this point. 
Figure 5-14: Click and drag a motion path to move it and the animated objects that follow it.
4. Leave the path selected, and choose the Free Transform tool ( ) from the Tools panel. 
Handles appear on either end, and in the middle of, the motion path. You can transform the 
motion path just as you would a graphic to change its position or rotation.
5. Position your cursor to the bottom-right of the right handle and pull it upwards slightly to 
change the rotation of the path (Figure 5-15). You may notice that while the rotation of 
the path changes, the actual shadow does not!

Incorporating color efects and scaling
Incorporating color effects and scaling
The cool thing about motion tweens is that you can have several properties of your graphic 
all animate at once, even within the same tween span. In addition to position, you can tween 
opacity (transparency), color tints, scaling, and rotation of an object to create more complex 
animation behavior. 
For your airplane shadow, you’ll want to manipulate the size and opacity of the shadow as the 
plane ﬂies at diﬀerent heights from the ground.
Follow these steps to modify the appearance of an object
Step-by-Step
1. Select frame 19 of the Shadow layer. This brings you to the part of the tween span where 
the shadow appears in the middle of the Stage. Because the plane is at a higher altitude, the 
shadow should appear lighter and smaller.
2. Choose the Selection tool ( ), then select the shadow directly on the Stage at frame 19, 
and locate the Color Eﬀect options under the Property Inspector panel on the right. If 
necessary, click on the arrow to the left of Color Eﬀect to display the Style menu below it.
3. From the Style menu, choose Alpha, which controls the transparency of your symbol 
instance. Use the slider to set the Alpha back to 50 percent as shown in Figure 5-16. Leave 
the shadow selected.
Figure 5-16: Select the shadow and use the  
Color Efects options to set its Alpha  
(transparency) to 50 percent.
4. Next, you’ll reduce the size of your shadow slightly, as the airplane is higher oﬀ the 
ground. Choose Modify > Transform > Scale and Rotate. This opens the Scale and 
Rotate dialog box. Set the scale value to 60 percent, make sure the Rotate value is set to 
0 degrees (Figure 5-17), and press OK.

Introducing the Motion Editor
Docked behind the Timeline panel is the Motion Editor, a powerful panel that enables you 
to ﬁne-tune and modify animation with precision (Figure 5-18). The Motion Editor displays 
all properties of a selected tween span in a graph-like format where you can adjust individual 
properties (such as position and Alpha) in a tactile, precise way. Because motion tweens are 
object-based, they can be easily manipulated and their properties can by copied and pasted easily.
Figure 5-18: The Motion Editor is a powerful feature that allows you to see and adjust every aspect of your  
animation in a graph-like format.
Previous Flash users will ﬁnd this to be a welcome addition, but if this is your ﬁrst time 
animating in Flash, you’ll also enjoy the ﬂexibility that comes with the Motion Editor.
Let’s take a look at the Motion Editor, and see how it works:
Follow these steps to use the Motion Editor
Step-by-Step
1. Click the Motion Editor tab to bring it forward. The Motion Editor appears docked 
behind the Timeline panel at the bottom of your workspace.
2. Before you can use or view properties in the Motion Editor, you’ll ﬁrst need to select a 
tweened object on the Stage. Click on the Shadow graphic on the Stage to select it and 
view its animation properties in the Motion Editor.
3. Each row across represents a diﬀerent property that is either being tweened or can be 
tweened if desired. Use the vertical scroll bar on the right side of the Motion Editor to 
scroll down and see more properties. 
You should see that every property you’ve tweened for your Shadow graphic, such as x 
position, y position, and Alpha, all have lines running across. These lines represent the 
value of each property at diﬀerent points along the Timeline. As the line goes higher, so 
does the value.

4. Within the Basic Motion category click on the X property to expand it. This expands 
the row to full height. Click on the X property again to collapse it to its original height. 
You can also make more room for the Motion Editor by dragging the divider in between 
the bottom of the Stage and the top of the Motion Editor/Timeline panels as shown in 
Figure 5-19. 
Figure 5-19: Click and drag between the Motion  
Editor and the Stage to expand its height. 
5. Scroll down and take a look at the Skew X and Skew Y properties. These rows display 
dashed lines, which indicate that there is no value for these properties. You haven’t applied 
any skewing to your graphic.
6. Leave the Motion Editor open for the next exercise.
Modifying the animation using the Motion Editor
Let’s go ahead and put the Motion Editor to use by modifying the animation you created earlier. 
You’ll remember that the Alpha and scale values of your shadow didn’t switch back even as the 
airplane returned to the ground in frame 30. You’ll need to adjust these values to change later 
in the animation, and the Motion Editor will help you do that.
Follow these steps to modify an animation
Step-by-Step
1. If the Motion Editor is not already visible, click its tab above the Timeline to bring it 
forward. Note: If you accidentally collapsed the panel, you can reopen it by choosing 
Window > Motion Editor.
2. Using the Selection tool ( ), click to select the Shadow graphic on the Stage to reveal its 
properties in the Motion Editor. Scroll down if necessary and locate the Alpha/Alpha 
amount row nested inside the Color Eﬀect category.
3. If necessary, expand the Alpha amount row by clicking on it. Use the horizontal scroll bar 
to scroll across, and watch as the line starts at 100 percent (top), dips down at frame 19 to 
50 percent, and remains there. A dashed line appears from that point on. You’ll need to 
add a keyframe along this line to change its value at a diﬀerent point in time.
4. Scroll right until you reach the end of the Alpha amount line (frame 30). Right-click 
(Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) on the very end of the line, and select Add Keyframe 
from the small contextual menu that appears (Figure 5-20). 

Introducing the Motion Editor

Lesson 5
This creates a draggable point on the line at frame 30. From here, you can either drag the 
point up or down to change the Alpha value, or specify an exact value on the left.
Figure 5-20: Right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) at any point along a value line  
to add keyframes that you can use to adjust values.
5. Leave the point selected, and on the left side of the row, locate the Alpha amount value. 
Click and drag on the value until it reads 100 percent. You should see the point (keyframe) 
you created move to the top position on the right and the shadow on the Stage become 
opaque (Figure 5-21).
Figure 5-21: Adjust values of a selected keyframe using the slider/type-in box on the left side of a row.

6. Directly above the Alpha row, locate the Scale X and Scale Y rows, which aﬀect 
horizontal and vertical scaling (respectively). You animated these properties when you 
scaled down the shadow earlier. Once again, scroll to the end of the row so that the end of 
the value line is visible.
7. At the end of the Scale X line, right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) directly on 
the line and choose Add Keyframe from the contextual menu that appears.
Note to make sure the Link X and Y property values button is not active so that you can 
set independent values for each axis.
Take Note...
Another way that you can create additional points along the value line is by holding down 
Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) and clicking directly on the line. Add the Shift key 
to this combo to remove an existing point.
8. Click and drag the new point (keyframe) straight up until the value on the left reads 60 
percent. The value is shown on the left side of the Motion Editor directly to the right of 
where it reads Scale X. As you change this value, you will also see the plane shadow scale.
9. The Scale Y value should have automatically scaled back up to 60% as shown in Figure 5-22. 
This is because Scale X and Scale Y values are linked together to maintain proportion. If 
you had disabled the Link X and Y Property Values button, repeat steps 7 and 8 for the Scale 
Y value, also returning its value to 60 percent at the end of the line (frame 30).

the Flash Player once you’ve viewed your movie.
Figure 5-23: The airplane’s shadow now returns to full size and opacity by frame 30.

The Motion Editor displays a frame ruler and playhead at the top just like the Timeline, 
so you can easily preview your changes as you go, without the need to switch back to the 
Timeline panel.
Making moves: Navigating the Timeline
Now that you are working across several frames and tween spans across the Timeline, you’ll want 
to be able to navigate the Timeline and view animation sequences in a number of ways.
Here are a few short tips for navigating the Timeline that you’ll find useful:
Preview an animation by pressing Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to start playback of 
the Timeline and view an entire animation sequence.
Move frame-by-frame through the Timeline by using the , (comma) and . (period) keys.
Move in any direction at any speed by clicking and dragging the playhead back and forth 
across the frame ruler. This is referred to as scrubbing.
Rewind and jump to the beginning of the Timeline by choosing Control > Rewind or 
pressing Shift+, (comma).

Tweening rotation 
If you need to incorporate one or more full rotations in a tween, you’ll ﬁnd that rotation has 
its own special option in the Property Inspector. Rotations may need to occur more than once 
(for instance, three full revolutions)—behavior that Flash can’t ﬁgure out from a graphic’s 
position alone. 
In the following steps, you’ll add a tween to the Sun graphic on your Stage, and rotate it using 
the Property Inspector’s rotation menu.
Follow these steps to add a rotation efect to an object
Step-by-Step
1. Bring the Timeline panel forward by clicking its tab below the Stage, or by choosing 
Window > Timeline. Select keyframe 1 of the Sun layer on the Timeline.
2. Right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) on the keyframe and choose Create 
Motion Tween from the contextual menu that appears. The layer is converted to a tween 
layer and a new tween span is created.
3. Just as you did with the other tween layers earlier, move your pointer over the last frame of 
the tween span, and then click and drag it to the right until it ends at frame 30 as shown in 
Figure 5-24.
Figure 5-24: Add a motion tween to the Sun layer, and expand the tween span to frame 30.

5. Place your cursor over the 0 in the Rotate property and then click and drag to set the 
rotate count to 3 times. This sets the number of revolutions the sun will complete during 
the course of the tween span (Figure 5-25).
Figure 5-25: Set the rotations to 3 on the  
Property Inspector. If necessary, set the  
direction to CW (clockwise).
6. Under the Rotate value, click on the Direction drop-down menu. This allows you to 
choose the direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) of the revolutions. Select CW for 
clockwise if it’s not already selected.
7. To put the ﬁnishing touches on your animation scene, select the Sun layer, and then click 
and drag it directly below the Airplane layer (Figure 5-26).
Figure 5-26: Drag the Sun layer below the Airplane layer to complete the scene.
Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to play back your movie, and you’ll see the 
sun rotate three times clockwise! Experiment with diﬀerent numbers of revolutions to 
increase the perceived speed of the rotation.
Take Note...
Remember, increasing revolutions without increasing the length of the tween span will result 
in faster rotation.

New Feature: Rotation
The Rotation options feature the ability to add a specific number of degrees to the number of 
full rotations you’ve chosen. For instance, you can set three rotations and 45 degrees if you’d like! 
Previous versions of Flash only accepted whole number rotation values.
Controlling animation paths
You may have noticed how all the tweens you’ve created so far move in a straight line. While 
this may work in certain situations, there will certainly be a time when you want an animated 
object to follow a curved or unusual path.
To accomplish this, you can manipulate the motion path that your animated object follows. 
This motion path behaves much like any other path, and can be curved or manipulated using 
the Selection tool.
Follow these steps to modify a motion path
Step-by-Step
1. Select the Airplane layer in the Timeline. Choose the Selection tool ( ), and move your 
pointer over the right half of the airplane’s motion path (animation path). You should see a 
curved line appear below your cursor ( ) when you get close enough to the line.
2. Click and drag up to bend the line into an upward curve, as shown in Figure 5-27.
Figure 5-27: Click and drag over the middle of a line to bend it into a curve.
3. Move your pointer over the second half of the motion path (where the plane begins to ﬂy 
down again) until the same curved icon appears below your cursor. Click and drag down 
to bend the line into a downward curve.

Where did Motion Guide layers go?
Users of previous versions of Flash who are revisiting the application may notice the absence of 
the Add Motion Guide icon below the Timeline. Changes in the animation engine, as well as the 
addition of motion paths in Flash, have essentially removed the need for Motion Guide layers.
More complex path manipulation is covered in Lesson 6, “Advanced Animation,” where you 
will learn to create and manipulate complex animation paths to accomplish the same eﬀect you 
may have previously achieved with Motion Guide layers.
What happens to my existing Flash files that use Motion Guide layers?
The good news is that Flash CS6 continues to support Motion Guide layers from previously 
created documents. You will be able to modify motion guides, and any tweens using them are 
treated as classic tweens (discussed later in this lesson).

Lesson 5: Creating Basic Animation
Morphing graphics and colors with shape tweens
How do I create a motion guide if I still want to?
Interestingly enough, despite the removal of the Add Motion Guide button, it is still possible 
to create a Motion Guide layer, but in a very non-obvious way. The Flash CS6 team thought 
enough to include a discreet way to create motion guides using standard guide layers.
Because traditional motion guides only work with classic (old-school) tweens, they are 
discussed in detail later in this lesson under “Legacy techniques: Creating classic tweens.”
Morphing graphics and colors with shape tweens
So far, the tweens you’ve created have involved moving, scaling, or rotating symbol instances 
across the Stage. However, you may want to create some cool animations by having an object 
change its shape or color. 
For these tasks, you’ll explore shape tweens, which allow you to animate changes in shape and 
color between two graphics. You can also create cool morphing eﬀects by having one object 
gradually transform into another. As a general rule, shape tweens work best with fairly simple 
shapes.
Shape tween basics
The good news for experienced Flash users is that the process of creating a shape tween has not 
changed. For new users, shape tweens diﬀer in some important ways from the motion tweens 
you learned about earlier in the chapter.
Some major diﬀerences are:
• Unlike motion tweens, shape tweens don’t work with symbol instances. You can only use 
mergeable artwork or drawing objects. Primitive shapes can be used, but they must be 
broken down ﬁrst.
• Shape tweens require the creation of two keyframes to contain the starting and ending 
shapes of the tween.
• Shape tweens do not have motion paths, so their motion, if any, is always linear (they 
move in a straight line).
• The Motion Editor can’t be used to adjust shape tweens.
In this section, you’ll create a shape tween to transform a moon into a bird in your animation 
scene.

to the upper-right corner of the Stage. It is automatically placed on the new layer you just 
created as displayed in Figure 5-30.
Figure 5-30: Drag an instance of the Moon graphic to the Stage.

You won’t be able to drag a symbol to a locked layer, so if you’re having diiculty, make sure 
that you have that Shape Morph layer selected on the Timeline, and that it is unlocked.

4. Because shape tweens can’t work with symbol instances, you’ll need to break this symbol 
back down to basic artwork again to use it in your shape tween. Use the Selection tool 
to select the new symbol instance, and choose Modify > Break Apart to break it down to 
non-symbol artwork (Figure 5-31).
Figure 5-31: Choose Modify > Break Apart to  
break a symbol instance apart and prepare it for  
shape tweening.
5. Next, you’ll need to add a second keyframe that will contain a new shape that your 
moon will transform into. Click and select frame 30 on the Shape Morph layer. Right-
click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) on the selected frame and choose Insert Blank 
Keyframe to add a new empty keyframe at this position.
Take Note...
The only diference between inserting a keyframe or a blank keyframe is whether or not 
Flash copies the contents of the previous keyframe to the new one. For a shape tween, you 
generally aren’t reusing the shape from the starting keyframe, so adding a blank keyframe is a 
better choice. At any point, you can select a keyframe and right-click on it to clear or remove 
a keyframe.
6. Click to select the new keyframe (30). Locate the Bird graphic symbol in your Library 
panel, and drag an instance of it to the middle of the Stage, slightly above the ground.
7. Once again, choose Modify > Break Apart to break the symbol instance down to basic 
artwork. Now that you have two unique shapes on keyframes 1 and 30, you’re ready to 
create a shape tween to have one transform into another (Figure 5-32).

Take Note...
If your tween displays a dashed line instead of an arrow, be sure to check that both pieces of 
artwork have been broken out of their symbol form. If either piece of artwork still exists as a 
graphic symbol, the shape tween can’t be properly created.
Getting in shape: Making the most of shape tweens
Shape tweening is part technique, part luck of the draw. Every pair of shapes will yield a unique 
result, but in some cases the transition between two shapes may not be what you expect. In some 
cases, the transition may not be pretty at all. To get the best results from your shape tweens, here 
are some general pointers to consider:
1. 
Try using solid, whole shapes. For instance, if you have a face and two eyes, avoid trying to 
morph all three in a single shape tween. Consider breaking each element out onto its own 
layer for best results.
2. 
Try and keep the number of starting and ending shapes the same. Two shapes to two shapes, 
as opposed to two shapes to three shapes, will yield cleaner results.
3. 
If your starting shape includes a stroke, try to include one on the ending shape as well. 
4. 
Use Shape Hints to ﬁne-tune the quality of your shape tweens and anchor common points 
between starting and ending shapes (Shape hints are discussed in detail in Chapter 6).
Legacy techniques: Creating classic tweens
In previous versions of Flash, the process of creating motion tweens was very diﬀerent. In fact, 
it was much more like creating shape tweens, whereby a set of keyframes had to be manually 
created to mark the beginning and end of a motion tween.
While it’s highly recommended that you use the new tween model, there may be cases where 
you need to create or modify a classic motion tween within an older Flash ﬁle. The next lesson 
illustrates this technique for just those times.

Classic tween rules
As with tween layers and tween spans, classic motion tweens have some rules that need to be 
followed to ensure that they are created properly.
• Classic tweens require a starting and ending keyframe.
• Classic tweens can only use symbol instances. 
• Both keyframes require an instance of the same symbol; you can’t tween between two 
diﬀerent symbol instances.
• Only one object can be tweened at a time on a single layer.
Adding color effects and scaling to a classic tween
When using classic tweens, you can animate several properties at once, just as you did with the 
airplane’s shadow earlier in the lesson. By making changes to the starting or ending instance of 
the cloud, you can incorporate transparency, scaling, and other properties in the tween along 
with the existing motion. 
Follow these steps to modify the appearance of a classic tween
Step-by-Step
1. If it’s not visible, bring the Property Inspector forward by clicking its tab on the right side, 
or by choosing Window > Properties.
2. Click keyframe 30 directly on the Classic Tween layer to select it. The cloud on this 
keyframe should also appear selected on the Stage. Click once more on the cloud so it’s 
active in the Property Inspector on the right.

3. Under the Property Inspector’s Color Eﬀect options, locate and click on the Style menu 
and select Alpha. When the Alpha slider appears, click and drag it to the left to set the 
Alpha value to 50 percent (Figure 5-36).

5. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to play back your Timeline, and watch as the 
cloud fades and shrinks as it moves across the sky.
6. Choose File > Save to save your ﬁle.
Take Note...
There is a big diference between selecting a keyframe and selecting the contents of a 
keyframe. If an object on the Stage appears selected, but you don’t see its options in the 
Property Inspector, click once more on the object to make it active. This is sometimes referred 
to as focusing an object.
Take Note...
Unlike tween spans, classic tweens will not prevent you from adding other objects to the same 
layer. While this will not generate a warning, adding graphics or text to a layer that contains 
a classic tween will likely break the tween.

(Re)creating motion guides for classic tweens
Experienced Flash designers may have already noticed the apparent removal of the Add Motion 
Guide button below the Timeline, and, in turn, the ability to create Motion Guide layers. A 
technique still exists for creating classic motion guides when and if necessary. In the following 
steps, you’ll change the path of animation for your classic tween using good, old-fashioned 
motion guides.
Follow these steps to change the path of an animation
Step-by-Step
1. Click and select your Classic Tween layer on the Timeline.
2. Click the Add Layer button ( ) below the Timeline to create a new layer above the Classic 
Tween layer, and rename it Motion Guide. You’ll use standard drawing tools, such as the 
Pencil tool, to create a random path that your cloud can follow.
3. Select the Pencil tool ( ) from the Tools panel, and make sure that you have a stroke color 
selected. In addition, make sure that Object Drawing is not enabled. The button at the 
bottom of the Tools panel, ( ), should be popped out.
4. On the new layer, use the Pencil tool to draw a single interesting path that starts about 
where the cloud begins, and ends about where the cloud ends on the left side of the Stage. 
This path, shown in Figure 5-38, is what your classic tween will follow in just a few 
moments.
Figure 5-38: Use the Pencil tool to draw a path on the new layer you created. 
5. The trick to making sure the classic tween will follow this path is to ﬁrst convert this layer 
to a Guide layer. Right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) on the title area of the 
Motion Guide layer, and choose Guide from the contextual menu that appears. The layer 
icon is replaced by a T-square icon ( ), indicating that this is now a Guide layer.

Lesson 5
6. Next, select the Classic Tween layer, and carefully drag it up and to the right below the 
Motion Guide layer until it appears indented underneath it (Figure 5-39). This lets the 
Classic Tween layer know to follow whatever path it ﬁnds on the Motion Guide layer 
above it.
Figure 5-39: Move the Classic Tween layer below and to the right of the Motion Guide layer  
to bind the two together.
7. To get your cloud following the path, you’ll need to snap the cloud instances at the 
beginning and end keyframes of the classic tween layer to the beginning and end of the 
path, respectively. Choose the Selection tool ( ), click on keyframe 1 of the classic tween 
layer, and drag the center of the cloud on this keyframe over the beginning of the path you 
created until the center snaps in place (Figure 5-40).

As shown in Figure 5-41, select keyframe 30 of the classic tween layer, and click and drag 
the cloud on this keyframe to the end of the path until it again snaps in place.
Take Note...
For symbol instances to properly snap in place to a path acting as a motion guide, make sure 
Snap To Objects is enabled. Choose View > Snapping > Snap To Objects to make sure it is 
checked.
8. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to preview your animation—your cloud 
should now follow the path you created on the Motion Guide layer.

Lesson 5: Creating Basic Animation
Adjusting animation with onion skinning
Troubleshooting Motion Guides
Motion guides can be a bit tricky the ﬁrst few times around. If your animation is not following 
the motion guide you created, use the following points to troubleshoot your animation:
• Make sure that both the starting and ending instance are snapped directly onto the path you 
created. If either instance is not seated properly on the motion guide, it will not work. Think 
of it as putting a train on the tracks.
• Make sure your motion path is NOT a drawing object, group, or symbol. Animations can 
only follow paths drawn in Merged Drawing mode. A telltale sign that you may not be using 
the right type of artwork is if your path appears inside a bounding box.
• Avoid using unusual stroke styles, such as dashes, dots, or ragged strokes. These occasionally 
cause unpredictable behavior if used on a motion path. 
Adjusting animation with onion skinning
One of Flash’s most useful visual aids is the Onion Skin, which allows you to view all frames 
of an animation at once on the Stage. This helps you make crucial decisions, such as how far 
to move or scale an object during the course of an animation. It also helps you see how your 
animation works alongside other items on the Stage as the Timeline plays back. 
Onion skinning can be enabled for a single layer or multiple layers at once; simply unlock a 
layer if you want to view it as onion skins, or lock it if you don’t. 
In the following steps, you’ll see how you can adjust your existing tweens in Onion Skin view.
Follow these steps to enable onion skinning
Step-by-Step
1. On the Timeline, lock all layers except for your Shadow, Shape Morph, and Classic Tween 
layers. If necessary, click and drag the playhead to the end of your Timeline to frame 30.
2. At the bottom of the Timeline, locate the cluster of ﬁve small buttons, and click the second 
button from the left, ( ), to enable Onion Skin view. Two brackets appear on the frame 
ruler at the top of the Timeline as you can see in Figure 5-42. These brackets allow you to 
select the range of frames that you’d like to view in Onion Skin mode.
Figure 5-42: Adjust the brackets on the frame ruler to choose how much of the Timeline you want to reveal in  
Onion Skin mode.

Lesson 5
3. Click and drag the left bracket to position it at the very beginning of the Timeline (frame 
1). With the playhead at frame 30, the right bracket is at the end of the Timeline. You 
should now see all frames of animation on the unlocked layers (Figure 5-43).
Figure 5-43: With Onion Skin enabled, you can view all frames of animation on all unlocked layers.
4. Click on the Timeline ruler at Frame 1 to return the playhead to the beginning of 
the Timeline. On the Shape Morph layer, select the moon shape and drag it slightly 
downward, click anywhere in the background and you will see the frames in between 
adjust automatically. Adjust the angle of the frames in between until you get the shape 
morph moving in a straight line from right to left.
5. On the Shadow layer, grab the starting shadow symbol instance on the right side of the 
Stage and drag it down slightly. You see the trajectory of the tween change, and the 
motion path readjusts as well.
6. Use the same technique to adjust the starting and ending position of your Cloud graphic 
on the Classic Tween layer. Try relocating the cloud to the opposite side of the Stage by 
moving the starting and ending instances individually, and watch how the frames redraw 
in between.
Take Note...
If the full-color frames in Onion Skin are diicult to look at, try Onion Skin Outlines. 
Click the button directly to the right of Onion Skin (third from the left in the button cluster 
below the Timeline). This displays all frames in an outline view that’s easier to see in certain 
situations.

Project 5-1: Animation Review
Project 5-1
In animation, you’re often trying to replicate what the organic version of the object would 
really do in the real world. Many animators will study a subject for quite some time to take 
note of the physics and physical reactions of the object they’re trying to recreate digitally. Let’s 
start the process of creating a bouncing ball by doing some review. 
1. Create a new ActionScript 3.0 document in Flash.
2. Select the Oval tool, set the ﬁll color to blue, the stroke to none and make sure you’re in 
Object Drawing mode. Draw a circle at the top of the Stage.
3. Choose the Selection tool and make sure the blue circle is selected on the Stage. Choose 
Modify > Covert to Symbol, save the symbol as movie clip named Bouncing Ball.
4. With the symbol still selected on the Stage, choose Insert > Motion Tween. 
5. Make sure the playhead is at the end of the frame span and drag the circle down to the 
bottom of the stage. 
6. Preview the animation of the circle by pressing Enter or Return. 
7. Save this ﬁle as bouncing_ball.ﬂa and keep it open for the next exercise. 
Trying Out More Eases
Project 5-2
There are a lot of eases built into Flash. Some of them are already preset to simulate realistic 
animation of objects in the real world. Spring is one of those presets...
1. You should still have the bouncing_ball.ﬂa ﬁle open from the last exercise. 
2. Choose Window > Motion Editor. 
3. Go to the Eases section at the bottom of the panel and add the Spring ease.
4. Return to the top of the Motion Editor and assign the Spring ease to the Y position value 
of your animation and preview the ball movement. 
5. Save this ﬁle as bouncing_ball_5.2.ﬂa and keep it open for the next exercise.

4. Change the color to red and set the tint percentage to 100%.
5. The ball should now bounce and change color. 
6. Save this ﬁle as bouncing_ball_5.3.ﬂa and keep it open for the next exercise.
Eases Demystiied 
Project 5-4
Many people think eases only apply to physical movement, but as you’ll see that’s really not the 
case...
1. With the bouncing_ball_5.3.ﬂa ﬁle still open from the last exercise, make sure your 
bouncing ball symbol is still selected. Choose Window > Motion Editor. 
2. Go to the bottom of the Motion Editor and assign the Spring ease to the Tint Amount 
value and note the eﬀect.
3. Save this ﬁle as bouncing_ball_5.4.ﬂa.
Circling Back 1
There are numerous ways to add a curved movement to an object. Getting the Pen tool 
involved and creating Bezier curves is yet another method you can incorporate. If you’re 
familiar with the Pen in Flash (or Illustrator) you may know it to be more of a drawing tool. In 
the next exercise you’ll use it more as a manipulation tool. 
Using the Pen as an Animation Modiier

The company you’re working for is asking you to design an animation that involves race cars 
on a race track that moves in an S shape. You need to mock up the animation to ﬁgure out 
how to replicate the movement of the cars on the track. 
1. Create a new ActionScript 3.0 document in Flash.
2. Select the Oval tool, set the ﬁll color to blue, the stroke to none and make sure you’re in 
Object Drawing mode. Draw a circle on the left of the Stage.
3. Choose the Selection tool and make sure the blue circle is selected on the Stage. Choose 
Modify > Covert to Symbol, save the symbol as movie clip named race car.
4. With the symbol still selected on the Stage, choose Insert > Motion Tween. 
5. Make sure the playhead is at the end of the frame span and drag the circle to the right so 
that it moves from left to right on the screen. 
6. Preview the animation of the circle by pressing Enter or Return.

So now that you’ve got the path of the movement ﬁgured out. You’ll need to ﬁgure out the 
speed that a car would travel given the circumstances regarding the shape of the track. Going 
back to the Motion Editor should help solve the problem of trying to recreate how organic 
objects move in the real world. 
1. The race_cars.ﬂa ﬁle should still be open from the last exercise. 
2. Go to Window > Motion Editor. Navigate to the middle keyframe. Add the Simple 
(Slow) ease to the keyframe. 
3. Go to the bottom of the Motion Editor panel and adjust the Simple (Slow) Value to -50. 
4. Preview the animation to see the new kind of whip movement to the animation.
5. Save the ﬁle as race_cars_5.2.ﬂa.

Business case
Learning eicient worklows with animation is key in Flash. Luckily there are 
methods such as copying and pasting and using presets that will help to streamline 
the process. Another aspect to animation is animating human igures in such a way 
that appears natural and not stif and fake. Learning the IK tools is important to 
understand in order to achieve more realistic human-like movement.

Lesson 6
Copying, pasting, and saving animation
As you develop more complex movies, you’ll likely want to animate several objects in the same 
way throughout a single movie. Once you’ve created a tween span (or several), Flash gives 
you many options for copying and pasting animation between objects. Another more reusable 
option is motion presets. Motion presets allow you to capture, save and apply an animation 
behavior later onto any number of objects across objects or even diﬀerent movies. Motion 
presets are discussed later in this chapter.
Using Copy and Paste Motion
The Copy and Paste Motion menu options enable you to copy animation behavior from one 
object and paste it to another. This means you can apply the same tween behavior to several 
symbols at once, or have two objects move in tandem with each other without having to 
manually recreate the same tween twice.
Copy Motion captures all aspects of a selected tween, including position, scaling, color eﬀects, 
easing, and ﬁlters. You can paste motion as-is between two symbols, or use Paste Motion 
Special to pick and choose exactly which aspects you want to apply.
You’ll use Copy and Paste Motion to create and apply the same tweening behavior to several 
text taglines in your skyPod banner.
Follow these steps to use the Copy and Paste Motion menu options
Step-by-Step
1. Choose File > Open and open the ﬂ0601_start.ﬂa ﬁle in the ﬂ06lessons folder. Choose 
File > Save and name the ﬁle ﬂ0601_work.ﬂa.
2. On the Timeline, locate and expand the Tag Phrases folder by clicking on the arrow to 
the left. This reveals ﬁve layers: Jam, Dance, Skip, Bounce, and 65 Trillion, each of which 
contains a tag line that you’ll animate.
3. On the Jam layer, right-click (Windows) or Control+click (Mac OS) on frame 1 and 
choose Create Motion Tween from the contextual menu that appears (Figure 6-1). This 
creates a new, 24-frame tween span (Figure 6-2). Move your cursor over the last frame of 
the new tween span, click and drag to the right, and expand the tween span to frame 40.

4. Drag the playhead to frame 1, and select the word Jam on the Stage, which is a movie 
clip symbol from your Library. On the Property Inspector, locate Filters. Click the Add 
Filter button at the bottom of the panel and select Blur from the ﬁlter menu that appears. 
Type 15 for the Blur X value to set a 15-pixel blur and press Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Mac OS). Choose High from the Quality drop-down menu.
5. Above the Filters options, locate the Color Eﬀect options, and choose Alpha from the style 
menu. Use the Alpha slider that appears to set the alpha to 0 percent (full transparency)—
the word Jam disappears (for now).
Next, you’ll gradually fade the text back in, using a motion tween.
6. Position the playhead at frame 15, and reselect the word Jam at this frame (Figure 6-3). 
Take Note...
If you are having diiculty inding fully transparent items, you can click the colored box to 
the right of the layer name to temporarily enable Outline view.
Figure 6-3: Set a layer to  
Outline view for the layer

7. With the word selected, return to the Property Inspector and use the Alpha slider 
(under Color Eﬀect) to return the alpha to 100 percent. Notice that a keyframe has been 
automatically created at frame 15 to mark the change.
8. Position the playhead at frame 40, where the tween span ends. Again, select the word Jam. 
Locate the settings you created earlier for the Blur ﬁlter (under Filters). Change the Blur X 
and Blur Y values to 0 pixels, then press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to remove 
the blur.
9. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to play back your animation so far. Notice 
that the word Jam fades in, and then gains focus as it reaches the end of the tween. Your 
next step will be to copy all the animation behavior you’ve just created, and paste it to the 
next word in the sequence: Dance.

tween span is created on the current layer of the same length, which includes all the same 
animation behavior and keyframes.
12. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to play back the Timeline, and the word 
Dance now animates in the same exact way as the word Jam.
13.  Repeat steps 11 and 12 for the Skip layer (Figure 6-5).

Creating Motion Presets
As seen in the previous exercise, the ability to Copy and Paste Motion is a great way to quickly 
share animation behavior among multiple objects in your movie. However, if you’d like to 
apply animation behavior across multiple projects, or store an animation behavior for later use, 
Flash CS6 gives you the ability to capture animation behavior into motion presets. 
Now you can save any existing tween (or series of tweens) into a motion preset, which can be 
recalled and applied from the Motion Presets panel. In addition, motion presets are saved in 
Flash itself (not to any speciﬁc ﬁle), and so they can be used across any number of Flash ﬁles. 
In the following steps, you’ll save the animation you designed in the last exercise to a new 
motion preset, and apply it to other objects in your movie.
Follow these steps to save an animation to a new motion preset
Step-by-Step
1. Choose Window > Motion Presets to open the Motion Presets panel. As shown in 
Figure 6-6, it contains two folders, Default Presets and Custom Presets. Any new presets 
you create are added to the Custom Presets folder.
Figure 6-6: The Motion Presets panel stores saved  
animation behavior in named presets. You can apply  
any preset to any object from any ile, at any time.
2. On the Timeline, click to select the entire tween span on the Skip layer. This tween 
contains animation that you copied and pasted from the Jam layer in the previous exercise. 
If necessary, reopen the Motion Presets panel.
3. At the bottom of the Motion Presets panel, click the Save selection as preset button to 
create a new motion preset from the selected tween. When the dialog box appears, type 
Fade and Focus for the new preset name, and click OK. The new preset now appears 
inside the Custom Presets folder.
4. Select the ﬁrst keyframe of the 65 Trillion layer. This layer contains a graphic symbol with 
another tag line, and currently has no animation applied. 
If necessary, reopen the Motion Presets panel and select the new Fade and Focus preset you

Applying Advanced Easing Behavior
Flash CS6 provides many basic and advanced easing behaviors (such as bounces and springs), 
available from the Motion Editor panel, enabling you to add realistic behavior to your tweens.
Easing is a setting in Flash that allows you to adjust how an animation begins or ends. You can 
ease into or out of the animation instead of an animation moving at a constant speed.
In the following steps, you’ll apply some of the easing behaviors to a new tween using the 
Motion Editor panel.
Follow these steps to apply easing behaviors to a new tween
Step-by-Step
1. Under the Tag Phrases layer folder, locate and select the ﬁrst keyframe of the Bounce layer. 
2. Right-click (Windows) or Control+click (Mac OS) on the selected frame and choose 
Create Motion Tween from the contextual menu that appears. A 24-frame tween span is 
created on the Bounce layer.
3. Click and select the tween span, and move your cursor over the last frame of the span. 
Click and drag to the right, and extend the tween span out to frame 40 (it should end at 
the same point as the other tweens you’ve created so far).

Animating Masks
Masking allows you to hide and reveal selected areas of artwork on your Stage using a Mask 
layer and a chosen shape. You’ve learned the basics of this common design concept in Lesson 4, 
“Advanced Tools.” 
Now, you’ll take masks a step further by incorporating tweens to create moving masks that 
add unique eﬀects to your movies. Animated masks are the key to some common, cool Flash 
“tricks” that you may have already seen, such as magnifying glass and spotlight eﬀects.
In the following steps, you’ll have your skyPod device move across the screen, magnifying 
your tag line text as it crosses the Stage.
Follow these steps to create an animated mask
Step-by-Step
1. On the Timeline, expand the Everything Else layer folder, if necessary. Locate, unlock, 
and select the Skypod layer, which contains the symbol of the skyPod device you’ll be 
tweening.
2. Click the New Layer button to insert a new layer above the Skypod layer, and rename the 
layer Screen Mask.
3. Return the playhead to frame 1, and drag an instance of the Screen Mask Movieclip 
symbol from your Library panel to the left of the Stage. Position it so it lines up and 
obscures the screen on the skyPod graphic below it (Figure 6-11).
Figure 6-11: On frame 1 of the Screen Mask layer,  
add an instance of the Screen Mask movie clip to the Stage,  
and position it so it overlays the screen on the skyPod device.
4. Select keyframe 1 on the Skypod layer. Right-click (Windows) or Control+click 
(Mac OS) on the selected frame and choose Create Motion Tween from the contextual 
menu that appears. A new tween span is created.
5. Move your cursor over the last frame of the span, and click and drag to expand the tween 
span to frame 40.
6. Click on frame 40 on the Timeline ruler to advance the playhead to the end of the tween 
span. Drag the skyPod graphic from the left, and position it on the right side of the Stage 
as shown in Figure 6-12.

10. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to play back your movie. The Skypod and 
Screen Mask layers should both animate exactly the same way. Next, you’ll convert your 
Screen Mask into a mask, so that it reveals artwork as it moves across the Stage.
11. On the Timeline, drag the Screen Mask layer above the Screen Simulation layer. Unlock 
the Screen Simulation layer, and turn its visibility on. Click on frame 1 of the Screen 
Simulation layer. This reveals a graphic containing the same tag phrases that are already on 
the Stage. You’ll reveal this behind the Screen Mask as it travels across the Stage.
12. Select and right-click (Windows) or Control+click (Mac OS) on the Screen Mask layer 
(next to its title). Choose Mask from the contextual menu that appears. This converts the 
Screen Mask layer, including its animation, to a mask that obscures the contents of the 
Screen Simulation layer below (Figure 6-14).
13. To complete the eﬀect, select frame 40 on the Screen Simulation layer. Use the F5 shortcut 
key to insert a frame here and extend the contents of the layer to the end of the Timeline.

Creating Animation with IK Poses
Two excellent tools for designers and traditional animators are the Bone and Bind tools, which 
allow you to create poseable, puppet-like Inverse Kinematics (IK) objects that can be animated 
with the same simplicity that you’re accustomed to with motion tweens. You explored these IK 
tools brieﬂy in Lesson 4, “Advanced Tools,” and now you’ll put your IK objects into motion by 
creating poses.
IK poses are very much like keyframes in a motion tween, and they store positions of 
connected IK objects at diﬀerent points along the Timeline. Connected IK objects are grouped 
together on Armature layers, where you can create poses and animate the changes between 
each pose.
You’ll reveal a pre-created IK object on the Timeline, and create poses to add a funky dancer 
to your banner.

Sequencing Animation
The true strength of the Timeline lies in the ability to sequence animation, graphics, and 
sounds across the Timeline to build more complex scenes. Now that you’ve added several layers 
of animation to your banner project, you’ll work toward sequencing your movie so that every 
animation falls into its proper place. Think of it as writing a script for your ﬁrst big movie—
you’ve got the actors, you’ve got the Stage, and now it’s time to orchestrate the scene.
Shifting, Moving, and Extending Tween Spans
Once you’ve created a tween span, you can easily slide it along a layer to reposition it at 
diﬀerent points along the Timeline. This is an essential concept for creating well-planned 
scenes that get your message across. 
You’ll now begin to move a few things around to get your banner project closer to completion.
Follow these steps to shift, move and extend tween spans
Step-by-Step
1. Locate the Dance layer on the Timeline (under the Tag Phrases folder). Click anywhere on 
the tween span to select it.
2. Click and drag the entire span to the right. Release the span when the ﬁrst keyframe is on 
frame 15. Fourteen empty frames now exist at the beginning of the Timeline.

3. Repeat step 2 for the Skip, Bounce, and 65 Trillion layers, repositioning their tween spans 
so they begin at frames 30, 45, and 120, respectively (Figure 6-18).
Figure 6-18: Select the frames on the Dance, Skip, Bounce, and 65 Trillion layers, and sequence them across the Timeline.
4. Under the Everything Else layer folder, reposition the Screen Mask, Screen Simulation, 
and Skypod layers so all three begin at frame 80. The Screen Simulation layer is not a 
tween span, in order to move it you should click on the ﬁrst keyframe and then Shift+click 
the last frame. This will allow you to move all the frames by clicking and dragging the 
selection.
Shift the Logo layer so it begins at frame 125.
As you extend the overall Timeline, some layers end abruptly and their contents disappear 
from the Stage. To remedy this, you’ll need to extend those layers by either expanding 
their tween spans, or adding frames.
5. Locate the tween span at the end of the 65 Trillion layer, which now ends around frame 
159 or 160. Move your cursor over the last frame of the tween span until a double-arrow 
appears; click and drag to extend the tween span to frame 165 as shown in Figure 6-19.
Figure 6-19: Extend the 65 Trillion layer to frame 165.
6. Locate the Skypod layer (under the Everything Else layer folder). Select frame 165 on the 
Skypod layer and use the F5 shortcut key to insert a frame at this position. This continues 
the layer’s contents without disturbing the keyframes before it. Repeat this for the Screen 
Mask and Screen Simulation layers. You may not actually see the additional frames created 
on the layers contained within the folder unless the folder is expanded.
Take Note...
Keyframes in an existing tween span shift when the span is extended or trimmed. If you 
want to extend the duration of a tween layer without shifting keyframes, add frames to the 
layer using the F5 shortcut key.
7. Repeat step 6 for the Jam, Dance, Skip, and Bounce layers. As you can see in Figure 6-20, 
all layers should be extended to frame 165.

Rendering and Animating in 3D 
Web graphics have advanced a tremendous amount in recent years, with users demanding 
more than ever before. One aspect of this is the prominent use of 3D graphics across the Web 
to enhance the overall experience.
The 3D Rotation and 3D Translation tools give designers a way to take two-dimensional 
artwork and rotate, transform, and animate them in the 3D realm. This opens up the doors 
for unlimited creative possibilities and stunning eﬀects through the use of movie clip symbols 
(covered in detail in Lesson 12, “Introducing Movie Clips”), and the 3D Rotation and 3D 
Translation tools.
Although you haven’t yet explored the intricacies of movie clips, keep in mind that at this 
point, it’s simply necessary for an item to exist as a movie clip symbol to take advantage of 
these 3D tools in Flash. This lesson ﬁle gets you started by providing you with several movie 
clips that you will use.
The 3D Rotation tool
The 3D Rotation tool can be used to rotate and transform an object around an x-, y-, and 
z-axis, rendering 2D objects in the 3D plane. Rendering is a term often used when working 
with 3D objects to describe the generation of 3D elements and adjusting their properties.Every 
aspect of 3D rotation can be included in a motion tween, and modiﬁed using the Motion Editor.

Lesson 6
The 3D Translation tool
In contrast to the 3D Rotation tool, which rotates movie clips around an axis, the 
3D Translation tool slides a movie clip along a speciﬁc axis to change its perceived distance 
and depth relative to other objects on the Stage. Like the 3D Rotation tool, all aspects of 3D 
Translation can be tweened.
These two tools can be used together on a single object to add a lot of dimension to your 
graphics and your tweens. 
To add the ﬁnishing touches on your skyPod banner, you’ll rotate and transform graphics 
on your Stage using the 3D Rotation and 3D Translation tools, and incorporate those 
transformations in several new tweens.
Follow these steps to use the 3D Translation tool
Step-by-Step
1. Locate and unlock the Notes layer (found under the Notes and Dancer layer folder). 
Right-click (Windows) or Control+click (Mac OS) the ﬁrst keyframe of the Notes layer 
and choose Create Motion Tween from the contextual menu that appears.
A new tween span is created on the Notes layer.
2. Move your cursor over the last frame of the new tween span until a double-arrow appears; 
click and drag to extend the tween span to frame 80.
3. Click on frame 20 of the new tween span to select it. Choose the 3D Rotation tool ( ) 
from the Tools panel on the right, and click once to select the ring of musical notes on 
the Stage. You see a set of handles that resembles a target—these allow you to rotate the 
selected symbol around the x-, y-, and z-axes (or all at once).
4. Move your pointer carefully over the red beam that appears in the center—you should see a 
small x appear. This handle lets you rotate the symbol around the x-axis—click and drag to 
the left or right to rotate the symbol around the x-axis. Once you get a feel for this handle, 
click and drag slightly to the right to achieve the position shown in Figure 6-22. A new 
keyframe is created at frame 20 to mark the change in rotation.
Figure 6-22: Rotate the symbol around the x-axis on frame 20. The change in position is marked by a new  
keyframe within the tween span.

Fine-Tuning tweens with the Motion Editor
Once you’ve created a tween, you may want to adjust the degree or timing of how diﬀerent 
properties (such as z-axis rotation) animate. The Motion Editor displays a selected tween and 
all its properties in an intuitive graph, where you can tweak, add, and remove as needed.
You may have noticed that the transformation you created using the 3D Translation tool is 
active throughout the entire tween span, even though it wasn’t applied until around frame 
60. Occasional side eﬀects such as these can be easily ﬁxed with the Motion Editor to control 
when a property changes during a tween span.
Follow these steps to ﬁne-tune a tween with the Motion Editor
Step-by-Step
1. Click on the Notes layer to make it active and then click on frame 60. Bring the Motion 
Editor panel forward by clicking its tab.
Take Note...
You can increase the height of the Motion Editor by moving your pointer in between the 
Stage and the Motion Editor panel—when you see a double-arrow, click and drag upwards 
to vertically resize the Motion Editor panel. You can also undock the Motion Editor by 
dragging it out of the panel group by its tab, and resize it from the lower-right corner.
2. Locate and click on the Y row to expand it and view its graph. 
Use the scroll bar at the bottom of the Motion Editor to scroll the graph to frame 60. Use 
the frame ruler shown at the top of the Motion Editor panel for reference. 
3. Click the keyframe that appears on the graph line at frame 60 and then move the keyframe 
up or down to change the Y value at this frame (Figure 6-25). Watch the Stage to see how 
your changes aﬀect the appearance of the notes.

Click and drag up or down on a keyframe to change its value.
Changing the Display
Use the three sliders at the bottom of the Motion Editor to change your view of graphs and 
frames. The icons (in order of display) control Graph Size, Expanded Graph Size, and Viewable 
Frames.
Undock the Motion Editor by grabbing it by its tab and dragging it out of the panel group at the 
bottom. You can then resize it by its lower-right corner.
Adding shape tweens and shape hints
To wrap up your banner project, you’ll add a basic shape tween to morph a musical note shape 
into the logo for Pineapple, Inc., the creators of the skyPod device. You explored shape tweens in 
Lesson 5, “Creating Basic Animation,” and you will use the same techniques here. You will also 
learn shape hinting, a technique for ﬁne-tuning shape tweens. 
Before you explore shape hinting, you’ll ﬁrst create a new shape tween on your Timeline using 
some graphics from your Library panel.

7. Leave the symbol selected, and choose Modify > Break Apart. This breaks the pineapple 
logo into mergeable artwork so that it can be included in the shape tween you’re going to 
create.
8. Select frame 125 of the current layer. Right-click (Windows) or Control+click (Mac OS) 
on the selected frame and choose Create Shape Tween from the contextual menu that 
appears. 
As shown in Figure 6-29, a green shaded area and arrow appear between the keyframes, 
letting you know that a new shape tween has been created. 
Figure 6-29: At keyframe 125, create a new shape tween to morph the note into the pineapple.
9. With the playhead positioned at frame 125, press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to 
view the new shape tween. The note now morphs into the pineapple logo!
You may notice that while the shape tween is successful, the transition may not be as 
smooth as it could be. To perfect this, you’ll explore the use of shape hints to ﬁnesse the 
new shape tween.
Creating Shape Hints
Depending on the shapes you choose for your tween, you may ﬁnd that some transitions are 
smooth while others need some ﬁne-tuning. For those that need a little help, you can make 
use of shape hints.
Shape hints tell Flash where it can ﬁnd common points between two seemingly uncommon 
shapes. To use them, you place a matched set of small markers at important parts of the shapes 
on the start and end keyframes of a shape tween. The markers tell Flash that the indicated 
shapes and points are related, and should be preserved through the animation as much as 
possible. Say, for example, you’re morphing a star into a square. You could place shape hints 
in the upper-right corner of each shape to match those points and keep the transformation as 
smooth as possible. You can place several shape hints, if necessary, to ﬁne-tune a single shape 
tween.
Take Note...
Because shape hints are alphabetically labeled, Flash limits you to 26 shape hints per tween. 
You’ll use shape hints in this exercise to help Flash ﬁnd common points between the musical 
note and pineapple logo for a better tween.

Adding shape tweens and shape hints
Follow these steps to create shape hints to ﬁne-tune a tween
Step-by-Step
1. Select the Zoom tool ( ) from the Tools panel. Click and drag to draw a marquee around 
the skyPod device on the right side of the Stage. This zooms in so that you can better see 
the transition between the two shapes.
2. Choose View > Show Shape Hints to make shape hints visible on the Stage (Figure 6-30). 
Nothing will appear until you add shape hints.
Figure 6-30: Before making use of shape hints, make sure  
they are visible by selecting View > Show Shape Hints.
3. Select keyframe 125 of the Pineapple Inc Logo layer. Shape hints must always be added 
(or removed) from the beginning of a shape tween. Choose Modify > Shape > Add Shape 
Hint. A new shape hint labeled a appears in the center of the note. 
4. Click on the shape hint and drag it until it snaps into place at the very top of the musical 
note. This pins that point in place—you’ll now match that point with a similar one on the 
pineapple shape at the end of the tween.
5. Click to select keyframe 165 (the end of the tween). You see the mate for the shape hint 
you just created, waiting to be placed. Click and drag the shape hint and snap it into place 
at the top of the pineapple shape. It should turn green, indicating the pair has been set.
6. Reselect keyframe 125, and choose Modify > Shape > Add Shape Hint. A new shape hint 
labeled b appears on the Stage. Click and drag the shape hint and snap it into place at the 
end of the note’s attached ﬂag. 
7. Select frame 165, and locate the matching b shape hint. Click and drag it, and snap it into 
place at the top of the pineapple’s right-most leaf.
8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 to add two more shape hints (c and d), and position them as shown in 
Figure 6-31.
Figure 6-31: Position the shape hints on frame 125 (left) and frame 165 (right) as shown.

9. Position the playhead at frame 125, and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to 
play back your animation. You should see that the new shape hints you added have made a 
substantial diﬀerence in the smoothness and quality of the shape tween.
10. Choose File > Save to save your work.
Take Note...
To remove a shape hint, return to the beginning of the shape tween, right-click (Windows) 
or Control+click (Mac OS) on a shape hint, and choose Remove Hint from the contextual 
menu that appears.
Hints for successful hinting
Adding shape hints is usually straightforward, but it can get a bit tricky with complex shapes. 
Follow these tips to create better shape tweens with a little less confusion:
Always enable Snap to Objects (View > Snapping > Snap To Objects). Although you can place 
shape hints without snapping, it’s much more difficult.
Use shape hints in sensible places; although Flash doesn’t make associations on its own, it can tell 
when a shape hint and its counterpart are not matched in a logical way. If the second hint remains 
red even after you place it, Flash is alerting you to a potential problem.
Avoid shapes that are broken into too many pieces; instead, try to tween between two whole 
shapes. Although Flash can tween between a single shape and a broken shape, the results are not 
always what you expect. If you need to tween between two multipart shapes, consider isolating 
each piece and applying to each its own shape tween.
Use Onion Skin view to assist you in placing shape hints. When you’re having a hard time 
determining exactly what’s happening in the course of a shape tween, turn on Onion Skin or 
Onion Skin Outlines view to follow the action and make better decisions on shape hints.
Sometimes less is more—gradually add shape hints and keep testing your animation as you go. 
Too many shape hints can sometimes have the reverse effect.
Sometimes it takes a few shape hint passes to get exactly the look you want. Try to fine-tune and 
complete the note-to-pineapple shape tween by adding some additional hints.

Diferent Methods: Copy and Paste Motion
Project 6-1
As you may have noticed, there are numerous ways to build an eicient workﬂow in terms 
of how you organize and reuse animation. Let’s worry less about design this time and just 
review some of the functionality. You’ll practice by creating some staggered animation in the 
Timeline using various methods. 
1. Create a new ActionScript 3.0 document in Flash.
2. Select the Oval tool, set the ﬁll color to yellow, the stroke to none and make sure you’re in 
Object Drawing mode. Draw a circle on the top left-side of the Stage.
3. Choose the Selection tool and make sure the yellow circle is selected on the Stage. Choose 
Modify > Convert to Symbol, save the symbol as a movie clip named Sliding Circle.
4. With the symbol still selected on the Stage, choose Insert > Motion Tween. 
5. Make sure the playhead is at the end of the frame span and drag the circle to the right. 
Preview the animation.
6. Make sure the playhead is on frame 1. Create a new layer and drag another instance of the 
Sliding Circle movie clip onto the Stage from the Library onto the new layer. Place the 
new instance below the other symbol already on the Stage.
7. Select the animated circle. Choose Edit > Timeline > Copy Motion. 
8. Select the new circle in Layer 2 and choose Edit > Timeline > Paste Motion. Slide the 
circle’s tween span in the Timeline so it starts at frame 5. 
9. Preview and save your ﬁle as animation_review.ﬂa and keep it open for the next 
exercise.
Saving and Applying Motion Presets
Project 6-2
Copying and pasting animation is convenient for immediate needs but what about a separate 
project? Motion Presets are the answer to that question. Let’s expand on the last exercise.
1. The animation_review.ﬂa ﬁle from the previous exercise should still be open. 
2. If you haven’t done so yet, stack the circles in the order they appear. Move the circle on 
Layer 1 to the top of the Stage, place the other circle just below so you have room for a 
third. 
3. Create a new layer and drag another instance of the Sliding Circle movie clip onto the 
Stage from the Library onto the new layer. Place the new instance below the other 2.
4. Select the circle in Layer 1. Choose Window > Motion Presets. 
5. Choose the New Preset button from the bottom left area of the panel. Name the new 
preset slide to right.
6. Click the new circle in Layer 3 and from the Motion Presets panel choose the slide to right 
preset in the Custom Presets folder and then click Apply in the bottom right portion of the 
panel. Slide the new circle’s tween span in the Timeline so it starts at frame 10. 
7. Save your ﬁle as animation_6.2. Preview the animation and keep the ﬁle open for the 
next exercise.

3. Choose Export and save the preset as slide to right.xml. Keep the ﬁle handy for the next 
exercise.
Importing Motion Presets
Project 6-4
Now that you’ve exported your presets, let’s examine how to share them with other 
computers. You normally would need a separate computer with Flash installed, but we’ll take a 
step to skip that part. 
1. Go to the Motion Presets panel. Select the slide to right preset and click the Trash button 
at the bottom of the panel to remove it. 
2. Go to the ﬂyout menu in the upper right corner of the Motion Presets panel and choose 
Import. 
3. Navigate to the slide to right.xml ﬁle and import the slide to right preset back in! As 
you can see, an easy way to share a preset with other users!

Business case
There are quite a few panels in Flash for your use, unfortunately trying to 
manage them can be problematic if you’re not used to dealing with all of them. 
Understanding workspaces can be really helpful in terms of managing the various 
panels and creating custom workspaces speciﬁc to your own personal habits and 
preferences. Besides panels, working with keyboard shortcuts can be another useful 
component to modifying your approach to using Flash in such a way that creates a 
faster and more personalized worklow when using the program. 
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
workspace. See “Resetting the Flash workspace” in the Starting up section of this book. 
You will work with several ﬁles from the ﬂ07lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that you have 
loaded the ﬂlessons folder onto your hard drive from http://www.wiley.com/college/sc/adobeseries. See 
“Loading lesson ﬁles” in the Starting up section of this book.

Customizing workspace layouts
Introduction to Adobe Flash Professional CS6
218
Lesson 7
Customizing workspace layouts
Flash has many diﬀerent features that enable you to customize your work environment. Although 
it means spending a little time organizing before you create a document, customizing saves time 
and headaches later when you’re deep in a project. You can strategically place your tools, then save 
the workspace so the panels you use most often are at hand. The workspace includes panels, tools 
and their locations on the screen.
In this lesson, you will learn how to customize the Flash Professional CS6 workspace for a 
more eicient workﬂow. You’ll also learn how visual aids and keyboard shortcuts can help you 
work smarter and faster. 
Opening the completed file
This exercise involves assembling a small interactive .swf ﬁle for a ﬁctional design ﬁrm. You’ll 
place logos, text elements, and navigation buttons on the Stage with the help of guides, grids, 
and the align panel.
Follow these steps to open the completed ﬁle
Step-by-Step
1. Launch Flash CS6 Professional, if it is not already open.
2. Choose File> Browse in Bridge to open Adobe Bridge. Use the Folders tab in the upper-
left of the Bridge workspace to navigate to the ﬂ07lessons folder that you copied onto your 
computer. Adobe Bridge is used to navigate and open ﬁles in this lesson, but if you prefer, 
you can choose File > Open.
3. Once you have the ﬂ07lessons folder open, double-click on the ﬁle named 
ﬂ0701_done.ﬂa to open it in Flash. A project ﬁle that includes a splash page for a mock 
design ﬁrm appears; you will reproduce this layout in the following exercises.
4. You can keep this ﬁle open for reference, or choose File > Close at this time. If asked to 
save changes, choose No.
5. Choose File > Browse to bring Adobe Bridge to the front. If you are not already viewing 
the contents of the ﬂ07lessons folder, navigate to it now.
6. Double-click on the ﬂ0701.ﬂa ﬁle to open it in Flash. 
7. Choose File > Save As. When the Save As dialog box appears, type ﬂ0701_work.ﬂa into 
the Name text ﬁeld. Navigate to the ﬂ07lessons folder and press Save.

Working with panels 
Before getting started choose Workspace > Reset ‘Essentials’ to reset your workspace and 
return all panels to their default positions. The right side of the screen contains the Toolbar and 
two important panels: Library, and Properties. By default, the Property Inspector is in front of 
the Library as you can see in Figure 7-1. Many of the most common tasks in Flash can be easily 
achieved with this default layout; however, Flash includes a number of helpful panels that give 
you more sophisticated options to streamline your workﬂow. 
Figure 7-1: The Properties and Library panels  
are open in the default workspace.
Most panels are docked with other panels in the workspace by default. If you have a number 
of these panels open at the same time, they may become cumbersome to manage. Next you’ll 
explore your options for docking panels in Flash CS6.

the same with the Swatches panel to remove it from the dock.
3. Use the dark gray title bar to drag the Swatches to the bottom of the Color panel 
(Figure 7-4). When you get close to the bottom of the Color panel you should see the 
Swatches panel ‘snap’ into place below the Color panel. This helps you arrange panels in 
your workspace without overlap or misalignment.

Lesson 7
Collapsing and storing panels
In addition to docking and snapping panels together, Flash CS6 provides a number of ﬂexible 
options for maximizing screen space. By collapsing panels you can focus on only the features 
you need at any given moment, but keep within easy reach everything you might need during 
a session. 
Follow these steps to expand and collapse panels
Step-by-Step
1. Double-click on the Color panel’s title tab to collapse the panel. This option allows you to 
maximize vertical space. It’s especially useful if you have several panels open at the same 
time. To expand the panel again, simply double-click the title tab again (Figure 7-5). 
Take Note...
A panel that is docked into an icon bar will not collapse, but will minimize back to an icon in 
its respective panel group.
Figure 7-5: Collapse undocked  
panels by double-clicking on the  
gray bar above its title tab. 
2. Double-click on the dark gray bar that sits at the top of the Color panel (above its title tab). 
This collapses the Color panel, as well as the Swatches panel into icon view.

3. Click on each icon to expand and collapse its panel (Figure 7-6). Notice that only one 
panel stays open at a time. Once you’re familiar with the features of each panel, icon view 
can be a great way to hide panels when they’re not in use. 
Figure 7-6: Reduce a group of panels to icon  
view by double- clicking the bar above its title tab.
4. Click the double arrows at the top of the icon group to re-expand the panels.
5. Using the Color panel’s title tab, drag it over the icon bar on the far right of the Stage 
(from where you originally pulled the color and swatches panels). When you see a blue line 
indicator at the top of that bar, release it (Figure 7-7). The Color panel will be redocked 
and its icon will appear again along with the others.

Managing workspaces
Once you arrange a layout that’s ideal for your workﬂow, you can save it as a workspace for 
future use. You can save as many workspace layouts as you need, customizing them by task, 
project, or even for use among multiple users. Once you build up a collection of workspaces, 
Flash also oﬀers controls for managing them. 
Let’s go ahead and set up your ﬁrst custom workspace:

of projects or for multiple users who use the same machine. If you end up having multiple 
workspaces, you need a way to manage them.
4. Choose Window > Workspace > Manage Workspaces (Figure 7-11).

menu as shown in Figure 7-13. You could also choose to have the application open a new 
document or even the last document saved.
Figure 7-13: Use the On launch drop-down to turn of the Welcome Screen.
3. In the Undo section of the General preferences, the Undo levels are set to the default 
of 100. Type 150 in this text ﬁeld. This increases the number of times you can Undo 
steps by 50. Flash supports up to 9999 undo levels, but this would likely slow down the 
performance of your system. 
Take Note...
If you change your Undo preferences in the middle of a project, you will lose the history of 
the work you have done since you started your work session, which means you cannot go back 
and undo your previous actions. Object undos deal with tracking the separate steps performed 
on objects like the Stage, or symbols in the Library. Document undos deal with the series 
of linear actions you made in the current and open document like timeline changes, creating 
keyframes, and scaling.

If customizing your workspace streamlines your workﬂow, then using keyboard shortcuts adds 
speed. Flash provides a window for you to view all the keyboard shortcuts in one location. 
You can do more than just identify shortcuts (Figure 7-15), however; you can also add, 
remove, and reassign shortcuts in one location, allowing you to truly customize the way Flash

reasons, you can only have one key combination for any given shortcut. You will now test 
this by trying diﬀerent combinations.
7. Click inside the Press key ﬁeld again and press Ctrl+M (Windows) or Command+M (Mac 
OS). You will receive no warning, therefore that combination is available. Now press 
Ctrl+K (Windows) or Command+K (Mac OS). A warning triangle appears, because that 
combination is the Align command’s shortcut. 
8. Press the Cancel button; you will not be modifying this keyboard shortcut right now.
Take Note...
To thoroughly customize your shortcuts, export the shortcut list as HTML, print it out, 
grab a pen, and circle the commands you use frequently. Choose the Shortcuts menu and try 
running a sequence of command keys until you ind one that’s usable, assign it to one of your 
frequently used commands, jot it down on your list, then try again for the next command.

Visual aids for alignment
Visual aids for alignment
Flash’s visual aids streamline how you work on the Stage, whether it’s drawing, placing 
objects, or aligning items in a layout. Rather than determining locations by eye, or placing 
graphics through trial and error, you’ll take advantage of guides, rulers, grid, guide layers, and 
advanced alignment tools. 
Rulers and guides work together to let the user place an item on the Stage at speciﬁc 
locations, providing an easy way for you to create symmetry, movement, and place objects 
including lines, in proximity to one another, while guide layers change artwork into a device 
that can be used for alignment and reference purposes helping you to balance and add contrast 
to your design. The grid functions much like graph paper, and appears superimposed on the 
Stage so that you can precisely place objects on the Stage. The Align feature and Flash’s various 
visual aids allow for very precise positioning. To put these visual aids to use and explore their 
beneﬁts, you’ll put together a sample home page for a design ﬁrm.
When designing in Flash, remember to use good design techniques to add emphasis and unity 
to elements on the stage. Avoid designs that violate good design principles such as extraneous 
graphics, overcrowded layouts, and color that distracts from the main elements of the design. 
Utilize color and white space to make your design as appealing as possible. You can even use 
the visual aids in Flash to create a rule of thirds grid to aid in the visual balance of your project. 
Don’t adapt the design to the page content, establish consistency in your design.
Rulers and guides
Rulers and guides work together to provide more precise placements in less time. Here’s how 
they work.
Follow these steps to use rulers and guides
Step-by-Step
1. Choose the View menu. If there is a checkmark to the left of the Rulers option, the rulers 
are currently displayed (Figure 7-21). If there is no checkmark, select the Rulers option 
now. When activated, rulers appear on the top and left side of your work area. 
Figure 7-21: Rulers can be toggled on and of from the View menu.
By default, measurements on the rulers are displayed in pixels. You can easily change the 
unit of measurement in Flash CS6 Professional.

2. Choose Modify > Document, then click on the Ruler units pull-down menu. You have 
the option to select inches, centimeters, millimeters, points, or pixels. Web pages and web 
graphics are typically designed using pixels, so select pixels if necessary (Figure 7-22) and 
press OK.
Figure 7-22: Change measurement units from the Document Settings dialog box.
3. Place your cursor on the horizontal ruler at the top of the Stage and then click and drag 
downwards. This pulls out a horizontal guideline from the ruler. Drag the guide to the 
350-pixel mark displayed on the vertical (left-side) ruler as shown in Figure 7-23. Click 
and drag the guide again to ﬁne-tune its position, if necessary. To remove a guide, simply 
click on the guide and drag it back to the ruler.
Figure 7-23: Drag a new guide from the top ruler.
Take Note...
By choosing View > Guides > Edit Guides, you have access to the guide properties. The 
guide properties provide control over aspects of guides such as locking and unlocking guides, 
and guide color. By choosing View > Guides > Snapping, you can control how objects snap 
to the guides as well as to the grid, objects and pixels in a document.

4. Click on the Library tab to bring the Library panel forward, and click on the graphic 
symbol named logo from the list as shown in Figure 7-24. 
Figure 7-24: Select the logo graphic symbol.
5. Drag an instance of the logo symbol from the Library panel onto the Stage and drop it above 
the guide in the ﬁrst orange column shown on the left (Figure 7-25). In the exact center of 
the logo is a small circle. This is the registration point, and you will now align it to the guide.
Figure 7-25: Drag the logo  
symbol from the Library.
6. Using the Selection tool ( ), grab the logo by its registration point and drag it downward as 
shown in Figure 7-26. When the registration point approaches the guide, it snaps to it.
Figure 7-26: The symbol’s centered  
registration point snaps to the guide.
So, what if you wanted the bottom of the logo to snap to the guide instead of the center? 
To do this, you need to edit the registration point. In order to permanently change the 
registration point of any library item, you need to edit the original symbol. 
Take Note...
If you’re inding that objects aren’t snapping into place as you expected, check to make sure 
Snapping is enabled for your document. Choose View > Snapping and make sure Snap 
Align, Snap to Guides, and Snap to Objects are all checked.

7. Double-click on the icon of the logo graphic in the library to edit it in place(Figure 7-27). 
Once you are in the item’s edit mode, select the text box with the Selection tool ( ). 
Figure 7-27: In the symbol’s  
edit mode, use the Selection  
tool to select the text box.
The registration mark, shown as a crosshair, appears to be centered, so you’ll need to move 
the content relative to the registration point (the registration point itself cannot be moved).
8. If it’s not already visible, choose Window > Align to open the Align panel, and check the 
Align to stage checkbox at the bottom of the panel as shown in Figure 7-28. The Align 
panel’s icon should appear on the right in the default “Essentials” workspace.
Figure 7-28: Click the Align to stage  
checkbox on the Align panel.
The top row of buttons grouped under Align heading are all the alignment choices 
available to you. Place your cursor over the ﬁrst button and a box appears, indicating that 
this is the Align left edge option. 
9. Place your cursor on the last button in the Align row, make sure the Align bottom edge 
box appears, and click once as shown in Figure 7-29. The text box will move upward and 
the registration mark is now aligned to the bottom of the text box. Close the Align panel.
Take Note...
By default, the alignment, sizing, and distribution options on the Align panel work by 
comparing two or more selected objects on the Stage. Selecting the Align to stage checkbox 
sets the Stage itself as the ultimate point of reference, so results will be very diferent with this 
option enabled.

10. Click the Scene 1 link above the Stage to exit the symbol and return to the main 
Timeline. You’ll see that the logo now properly sits with its lower edge resting on the 
guide as shown in Figure 7-30. By default, guides always snap to the registration mark of 
an object. 
Figure 7-29: Choose Align bottom edge. 
Figure 7-30: Logo is now

Take Note...
If you prefer, you can change the default snapping behavior of guides. Go to View > 
Snapping > Edit Snapping, and uncheck Snap to Guides to prevent objects from snapping 
to guides. 
Guide layers
Unlike standard layers, the contents of Guide Layers only appear during the design process, 
and are not published to your ﬁnal movie
Important information to consider is that objects on guide layers will not export with your 
ﬁnal movie; objects on a guide layer are only visible within the authoring environment. 
Before you work with guide layers, however, you will ﬁrst add the content to your current 
document.
Follow these steps to work with guide layers
Step-by-Step
1. Press the Insert Layer button ( ) at the bottom left of the Timeline. Double-click the new 
layer name to rename it and type Text as shown in Figure 7-31. 
Figure 7-31: Create a new layer and name it Text.

2. Double-click on the existing layer 1 name, and rename this layer Background as shown 
in Figure 7-32. You will now move the logo you added in the previous exercise to the 
Text layer
Figure 7-32: Rename the bottom layer Background.
3. Select the 08 logo on the artboard, then choose Edit > Cut as shown in Figure 7-33.
Figure 7-33: Select the logo and choose Edit > Cut.
4. Select the Text layer, then choose Edit > Paste in Place as shown in Figure 7-34.
Figure 7-34: Move the logo to the Text layer.
The logo is placed on the new layer in the exact location it occupied on its original layer. 
You are now going to convert the orange Background layer to a guide layer. This will allow 
you to use the structure of the columns to align the text you will be adding shortly. 
5. Click the dot below the padlock column on the Background layer. This locks the orange 
columns so they can’t be moved accidently. You will now remove the guide you added in 
the previous exercise. Part of the beneﬁt of guide layers is that they remove the need to add 
multiple guides to your document. Instead of aligning to a guide, you align to an object.
6. Click the guide at the bottom of your document and drag it back to the ruler on the top. It 
is removed from the page.

Sensitivity
You can adjust how close a graphic needs to be to a guide before it snaps by choosing View > 
Snapping > Edit Snapping. 
In the resulting dialog box, you can use the checkboxes at the top to set the type of snapping 
behavior you’d like to use (Figure 7-37). 
Figure 7-37: A number of options are  
available for snapping behavior.
To change the pixel distance, or tolerance, click the Advanced arrow to access the Advanced 
options. Stage Border is how close the graphic needs to be before it snaps; increase or decrease 
that number according to your feel for moving elements around the Stage. 
The good thing is that you can save these settings by clicking Save Default just under the Cancel 
button on the top-right side of the dialog box. Your new settings become the standard setting for 
the entire program; not just the current document.
9. Now you’ll continue using the guide layer to position more graphics on the Stage. 
Select the Text layer so it’s active. Select the nav01 graphic symbol in the Library panel 
and drag an instance of it onto the Stage within the ﬁrst orange column on the left. Do 
the same to place nav02, nav03, and nav04 in the second, third, and fourth columns, 
respectively (Figure 7-38).

Because all four navigation elements are at the top of the columns, you will now properly align 
them, not just across the columns but also in spatial relation to each other. 
Follow these steps to align elements on the page
Step-by-Step
1. Select the instance of nav01 (services) on the Stage and make sure it’s centered above the 
column. 
Take Note...
You can cycle through and select symbols on the Stage by using the Tab key. 
2. Click on the padlock icon ( ) to the right of the Background layer to unlock it. You will 
be aligning the navigation to the column and you need to be able to select the column.

3. Shift+click to select the orange column underneath the nav01 symbol instance you already 
have selected, so that both the symbol instance and the column are selected (Figure 7-40). 
Open the Align panel (make sure the Align to stage checkbox is unchecked), then click 
Align horizontal center to center the nav01 symbol above the column. 
Figure 7-40: Align the nav  
symbols with their respective  
columns.
4. Click on the last navigation element (contact us) and then Shift+click on the column 
beneath it. Click on the Align horizontal center button in the Align panel to center it.
Now that the ﬁrst and last navigation elements are aligned with their respective columns, 
you will work with the Distribute feature. Distribute is designed to evenly distribute the 
space between objects, and doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with alignment.
5. Shift+click the four navigation elements to select them all at once, then click the 
Distribute horizontal center button as shown in Figure 7-41. The ﬁrst and last objects are 
ﬁxed and the second and third objects are now evenly distributed between them. Each 
element should be centered over its assigned column. 
Figure 7-41: Select and distribute all four nav symbols.
Distribute looks at the registration point, not the bounding boxes, of each graphic. So, 
when you look at the four graphics, the centered registration marks are evenly distributed. 
6. With all four items still selected, click the Space evenly horizontally button ( )as shown in 
Figure 7-42. Notice how nav02 and nav03 shift a bit. It’s the space between the bounding 
boxes, and not the center points, that becomes even. Distribute distributes the center points 
of graphics, while Space distributes the spacing between the bounding boxes of graphics.

7. The last few items you need to place on the Stage are the tag graphics. Drag the tag01 
symbol from the Library panel to the Stage and position it in the top third of the third 
column.
8. Click and drag the tag02 text and place it in the third column beneath the tag01 text 
you just added. Drag tag03 and place it in the middle of the fourth column as shown in 
Figure 7-43. You will now be using the Align panel to center these. 
Figure 7-43: Drag instances of tag01, tag02, and tag03 into the second and third columns.
9. Shift+click tag01 and tag02 to select both graphics, press the Align panel button on the 
right to open it, then press the Align horizontal center button in the Align panel to center 
the two graphics. You will now group these two graphics so you can align all the text 
inside the third column.
10. Choose Modify > Group to group tag01 and tag02 together as shown in Figure 7-44. 
Grouping two objects together allows you to align the entire unit within the column.
Figure 7-44: After centering tag01 and tag02,  
select Group from the Modify menu.
11. Shift+click the third orange column to select both it and the grouped text, then press 
Align vertical center and Align horizontal center buttons in the Align panel.

12. Click on tag03 in the fourth column and then Shift+click the fourth column to select it 
as well. In the Align panel, press the Align vertical center button and the Align horizontal 
center button. Aligning your text in this fashion is much more precise than doing it by hand.
Refining your aligned objects
The devil is always in the details. Although you have been able to align tag03 within its own 
column, what if you wanted to align the top of the paragraph in column four with the top of 
the paragraph in column three? You could use a guide, but there is a more eicient method 
using the align techniques you have been learning.
Follow these steps to reﬁne aligned objects
Step-by-Step
1. As shown in Figure 7-45, select the group that contains tag01 and tag02, and choose 
Modify > Ungroup to ungroup the two symbols. Now you can freely align the tag02 and 
tag03 symbols without including tag01.
Figure 7-45: Ungroup tag01 and tag02.
2. Select tag03, then Shift+click tag02 to select both graphics (Figure 7-46). As shown in 
Figure 7-47, press the Align top edge button in the Align panel; tag03 jumps upward to 
align itself with tag02.
Figure 7-46: Select tag02 and tag03.

Grids
If you find that rulers and guides become too time-consuming for you, consider setting up a grid 
system to assist in placing graphics on the Stage. To turn on the grid behind the Stage, choose 
View > Grid > Show Grid. 
To edit the grid details, such as color or increments, choose View > Grid > Edit Grid 
(Figure 7-48).
Figure 7-48: Grid options can be accessed by choosing  
View > Grid > Edit Grid.
In the Grid dialog box, you can choose to show or hide the grid, change the grid line color, and 
adjust snapping accuracy. It can be very frustrating to move a graphic onstage and see it randomly 
jump to a guide or grid line. Change snapping accuracy to suit your working style, and you’ll 
have fewer surprises during layout.

Business case
Your task in this assignment is to create a scary Halloween themed online card. 
Instead of creating the artwork yourself, you’re being supplied artwork created by a 
diferent designer using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. There are some great tricks 
when it comes to importing and animating layered AI and PSD iles that you’ll 
explore as you create this project. 
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
workspace. See “Resetting the Flash workspace” in the Starting up section of this book. 
You will work with several ﬁles from the ﬂ08lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that you have 
loaded the ﬂlessons folder onto your hard drive from http://www.wiley.com/college/sc/adobeseries. See 
“Loading lesson ﬁles” in the Starting up section of this book.
The project
In this lesson, you will work with a series of bitmap and vector images to practice importing 
and manipulating external ﬁles. First, you’ll import a ﬂat bitmap image and learn the 
techniques for modifying and updating it. Then, you’ll move on to artwork in Adobe 
Photoshop and Illustrator native formats (.psd and .ai, respectively) to take advantage of Flash 
CS6’s import features for these ﬁles.

Import formats
Introduction to Adobe Flash Professional CS6

Lesson 8
Import formats
One of the strengths of Flash is its ability to import a wide variety of ﬁle formats. Flash can 
read and import a wide variety of common ﬁle types, including:
• Adobe Illustrator (.ai)
• Adobe Photoshop (.psd)
• Bitmap (.bmp)
• GIF and animated GIF (.gif) 
• JPEG (.jpg) 
• PNG (.png)
• Flash Player (.swf)
Adding the QuickTime Player plug-in (a free download for both Windows and Mac OS) adds 
the ability to import QTIF and TIFF images as well.
• For a full list of supported import (and export) ﬁle formats, refer to the Adobe knowledge 
base article located at http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/402/kb402701.html.
Import options
Flash offers four separate commands that enable you to import a variety of external media and 
control how they are treated once they’re in Flash. Import to Stage, Import to Library, Open 
External Library, and Import Video all perform slightly different, but equally important, 
operations:
Import to Stage: Automatically places an instance of the imported file on the Flash Stage at the 
time of import. 
Import to Library: Places the imported file in your library and allows you to manually place it 
onto the Flash Stage.
Open External Library: Allows you to open the library of any Flash file (.fla) and use its assets.
Import Video: Opens the Import Video wizard to walk you through the steps needed to bring 
your video files into Flash.
Take Note...
If you select a video ile while in the Import dialog box for Import to Stage or Import to 
Library, Flash automatically opens the Import Video dialog box. The option you choose 
depends on how you want to work with Flash. Some users prefer to import everything into 
the library at once and then pull the content from there, while others prefer to import assets 
onto the Stage as they are needed.

Importing still images
Still images, such as photographs, scanned artwork, and graphics created in Photoshop, are 
some of the most common types of ﬁles that users want to bring into Flash. You can choose 
how to import images, and how you work with them once they are in Flash. Imported bitmap 
images can even be directly edited in an external application such as Fireworks or Photoshop. 
Bitmaps are one of two primary graphic ﬁle categories in which the ﬁle is composed of small 
squares or pixels.The images are then updated automatically without having to be reimported. 
Match the format to the content you’ll be importing. Use JPEG images for photographs 
and GIF images for ﬁles with areas of solid color. PSD and AI are great native formats when 
importing source ﬁles from Illustrator and Photoshop.In the following exercises, you’ll explore 
some of those choices.

5. Flash detects that the ﬁle you are trying to import may be a part of a sequence of images, 
and displays a dialog box asking if you want to import them all (Figure 8-2). Press No to 
import the selected image only. 
Figure 8-2: Flash detects a sequence of images in the folder containing l0801.jpg.
Take Note...
When using Import to Stage, you can import individual still images or image sequences that 
have been manually created or exported from video editing and animation programs. If Flash 
detects that a sequence exists, it gives you the option to import the entire series of images. 
Flash can then place these images sequentially in consecutive frames on the Timeline.
The imported item appears in your Library panel, and Flash places an instance of it on the 
Stage as shown in Figure 8-3. 
Figure 8-3: The library stores .jpg iles as well  
as symbols.

Adding text
Adding text
Flash CS6 allows you to animate text directly which provides for quicker editing of the text or 
the text can be converted to a symbol and animated as well. In the next section, you’ll animate 
text from an imported Illustrator ﬁle.
Follow these steps to animate text from an imported Illustrator ﬁle
Step-by-Step
1. In the Timeline, double-click on Layer 1 to rename it background. It is always a good 
idea to change the default layer names to more descriptive names that help you identify 
content at a glance. 
2. Click the space under the Lock or Unlock All layers button ( ) to the right of the 
background text to lock this layer. This will make moving the rest of the objects you will 
use in this lesson much easier.
3. With the background layer selected, press the Insert Layer button ( ) below the Timeline 
to add a new layer. Double-click on Layer 2 and rename it text as shown in Figure 8-6. 
This layer is where you will insert and animate the words Happy Halloween for your 
e-card.
Figure 8-6: Layers can be renamed by double-clicking them.
The text you’ll be using has been formatted, broken apart to a shape, and then saved as a 
movie clip. Flash provides a number of options for sharing symbols between .ﬂa ﬁles. In 
this case, you’ll use the Open External Library feature to access a movie clip that has 
been saved into the library of another ﬁle. 
4. In the Timeline, select frame 1 of the text layer. Choose File > Import > Open External 
Library from the main menu. In the Open as Library dialog box, navigate to the 
ﬂ0801_library.ﬂa ﬁle located in the ﬂ08lessons folder. Choose this ﬁle and press Open.

5. Drag the text movie clip from the external library onto the left side of the Stage, as shown 
in Figure 8-7. Afterwards, close the external library by clicking the X in the top-right 
corner (Windows) or the top-left corner (Mac OS) of the Library panel. It’s important 
to realize that using symbols from an external library copies those symbols into your 
local library. After you copy them, it’s good practice to close the external library to avoid 
confusion.

7. Right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) the Happy Halloween text movie clip. 
From the contextual menu, choose Create Motion Tween (Figure 8-8). The Stage appears 
to go blank, but try not to panic. Flash adds 23 frames to the text layer when you add a 
motion tween. You’ll adjust this in a moment, and then extend frames on the background 
layer to make the white text visible again.
Figure 8-8: Choose Create Motion Tween from the contextual menu.
Take Note...
If you can’t seem to get the contextual menu when you right-click (Windows)/Ctrl+click 
(Mac OS) on the text movie clip, make sure you’re clicking on the letters. It’s easy to click 
the background through the letters by mistake.
8. In the Timeline, scroll over to frame 120. Click on frame 120 of the text layer and choose 
Insert > Timeline > Frame to extend the text layer for 120 frames. Select frame 120 of the 
background layer and choose Insert > Timeline > Frame to extend this layer as well. 
9. Now that you’ve got a little more room on the Timeline, click on frame 1 of the text layer. 
If you remember from previewing the ﬁnished ﬁle, this greeting card will feature text that 
shrinks down and snaps into place at the start of the animation. 
10. Click on the Happy Halloween text movie clip. Make sure the Property Inspector is 
visible, and then make sure the link icon ( ) next to W and H is unlinked as shown in 
Figure 8-9. Type 800 in the H ﬁeld and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to 
commit the change.

Swapping out an imported file
The Library panel has the ability to replace one imported image with another. This is a very 
helpful feature when, for example, you want to use a stand-in image as a placeholder while the 
ﬁnal artwork is still being developed. 
Now you will swap out the basic image you imported from Photoshop with the image you 
will use in your ﬁnal e-card.
Follow these steps to replace one imported image with another
Step-by-Step
1. Click the Library tab to bring the Library panel forward. Select the ﬂ0801.jpg ﬁle in your 
Library panel and click the Properties button ( ) at the bottom of the panel.

One of the advantages of working in Flash is that you can easily modify imported artwork 
using an external editor, and have the changes take eﬀect in Flash. When you want to modify 
imported artwork, Flash gives you the option of opening the external editor directly from the 
Library panel. In this exercise, you will use Adobe Photoshop CS6. If you do not currently 
have Photoshop CS6 installed, you can download a trial version from adobe.com, or you can 
skip this step and jump ahead to the next exercise in this lesson.

Lesson 8
Importing Photoshop files
In addition to importing standard bitmap image formats, Flash oﬀers native import of Photoshop 
.psd ﬁles. This means you can import layered Photoshop ﬁles (including full support for Layer 
Comps), and choose which layers to import and how to treat each one as it’s placed in Flash.
Importing a layered Photoshop file
To see how these settings work, import a layered .psd ﬁle:
Follow these steps to import a layered Photoshop ﬁle
Step-by-Step
1. With ﬂ0801_work.ﬂa still open, choose File > Import > Import to Library.
2. In the Import to Library dialog box, select ﬂ0803.psd from the ﬂ08lessons folder and press 
Open. The PSD Import Options dialog box opens.
Photoshop import options
When you import a .psd file, Flash automatically opens the Photoshop Import dialog box, which 
is divided into two main areas: On the left, you choose which layers to bring into Flash from 
your Photoshop document (by default, all layers are selected for import). On the right, you set the 
import options for each layer. When you highlight a layer on the left, its options appear on the 
right. The layer options are:
Import this image layer as: Specifies whether to import the layer as a flat bitmap image or 
with layer styles as editable sections of the image.
Create movie clip for this layer: Creates a movie clip symbol from the imported bitmap layer 
at import, and adds it to your library.
Publish settings: Defines the compression setting with which each bitmap image is published. 
Flash uses two types of compression: the Lossy setting, which applies JPEG compression, and 
Lossless, which applies PNG compression. By default, the compression setting is the same setting 
as in your Flash file’s Publish settings. 
3. In the PSD Import dialog box, uncheck the checkbox next to the layer named sky_bg. 
Because you are importing this Photoshop document into a Flash movie, you do not need 
the background layer.

Figure 8-20: Select the Create movie clip for this layer checkbox and center the registration point.
8. You now have two new items in the library: a graphic symbol named ﬂ0803.psd and a 
folder named ﬂ0803.psd Assets. The graphic symbol contains all the objects that were in 
the Photoshop ﬁle in their original positions and their relation to each other, while the 
folder contains the individual imported bitmap layers (located in the Assets sub-folder) and 
the movie clips created during import. 
In the Library panel, double-click on the ﬂ0803.psd Assets folder to open it. 
9. Click on the Insert Layer button ( ) below the Timeline to create a new layer. Double-
click on the layer name and rename it moon. Select the ﬁrst frame of the new moon layer.

Importing Illustrator artwork
As with .psd ﬁles, importing and using native Illustrator .ai ﬁles in Flash is enhanced with a 
variety of features to make integration with Illustrator as seamless as possible. 
Import options available in the AI Import dialog box give you the ﬂexibility to build your 
layered projects in Illustrator, and then determine how the artwork on individual layers should 
be handled on import. In the following part of this lesson, you’ll also explore the option of 
mapping Illustrator layers to keyframes in a movie clip. This can be a powerful option for 
quickly building frame-by-frame animations.
Let’s import an Illustrator ﬁle to see these features in action:

Setting the registration point of a movie clip is very important. The registration point 
determines how a movie clip is scaled, rotated, or otherwise transformed. 
Figure 8-28: Convert primary layers to movie clips.
7. Repeat step 6 for the layers named position02 and position03. 
What’s in an instance name?
When you import the contents of a layer as a movie clip, you have the option to specify an 
instance name. Instance names are used by ActionScript (Flash’s built-in scripting language) to 
programmatically manipulate and animate movie clip instances on the Stage. This name serves as 
a unique identifier that ActionScript can use to target a specific movie clip instance on the Stage. 
Instance names for a movie clip instance can be set at any time from the Property Inspector.

Free Transform tool as shown in Figure 8-32.
Figure 8-32: Reposition and resize the bat again to complete the animation.
8. Choose File > Save to save your work. Choose Control > Test Movie in Flash Professional 
to preview your Flash animation. The bat will swoop across the screen. It will appear to 
ﬂy away from the viewer for the ﬁrst half of the animation, and toward the viewer during 
the second half. 
If you think the bat is moving a bit more gracefully than bats frequently do, feel free to 
add a few more positions inside that motion tween. In addition to scaling the bat, the Free 
Transform tool makes it easy to rotate the bat to put some pretty wacky daredevil ﬂying 
into your animation.
Congratulations! You have ﬁnished the lesson. Choose File > Close.

Business case
Animation is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of using Flash to its full 
capabilities. Learning ActionScript becomes really important when you want to take 
what you can do with Flash up a notch. Controlling objects and animation using 
ActionScript are just a couple of the many ways you can take advantage of the 
powerful code that’s available within Flash. 
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
workspace. See “Resetting the Flash workspace” in the Starting up section of this book. 
You will work with several ﬁles from the ﬂ09lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that you 
have loaded the ﬂlessons folder onto your hard drive from http://www.wiley.com/college/sc/adobeseries. 
See “Loading lesson ﬁles” in the Starting up section of this book.

Exploring the lesson file
The lesson ﬁle features animation of a bird hopping across the Stage and onto the head of a cat. 
The scene is rife with tension. The bird animation uses the same techniques you explored in 
Lessons 5 and 6. In this lesson, you’ll be using ActionScript to adjust the ﬂow of this animation 
by starting and stopping the Timeline. While it would be possible to achieve a similar result 
with additional movie clips and a more complex Timeline, ActionScript allows you to 
streamline the process. Also, using ActionScript will increase the ﬂexibility of your ﬁnished ﬁle 
and, in certain cases, decrease the size of your published movie. 
Follow these steps to open the project ﬁle
Step-by-Step
1. Choose File > Open, and navigate to the ﬂ09lessons folder.
2. Select the ﬁle named ﬂ0901.ﬂa and press Open.

Lesson 9: Introducing ActionScript 
What is ActionScript?
What is ActionScript?
ActionScript is Flash’s built-in object-oriented, scripting language and your way of sending 
instructions to the Flash Player and exerting more control over your movie. Using Flash’s 
Actions panel, you can create and place lines of ActionScript code (often referred to as 
actions), in keyframes on the Timeline, or in external ﬁles. This code is interpreted and carried 
out by the Flash Player during playback. If the idea of typing code seems a little overwhelming, 
don’t worry; you can use the Actions panel’s Script Assist mode or the handy Code Snippets 
panel to help you create your ﬁrst lines of code.
At its most basic level, ActionScript can control the playhead to ﬁne-tune the behavior of 
animations or enable user controls for navigation of the Timeline (such as Stop and Play 
buttons). Beyond this, ActionScript is a powerful language that can manage virtually any 
object or piece of information in (and in certain cases, out of) your movie. It can even retrieve 
and display real-time data from databases, ﬁles, and web services.
Which version of ActionScript should you use?
Since you can work with several versions of ActionScript in Flash, the ﬁrst step is sometimes 
deciding which version to use. Flash comes with both ActionScript 3.0, the latest version (and 
recommended), and 2.0, the previous version which was used predominantly with Flash Player 
versions 8 and earlier. You are also able to publish much older movies with ActionScript 1.0, but 
this is no longer recommended unless there’s a good reason to do so. 
The Flash Player continues to run ActionScript 2.0 and 3.0 side-by-side using two virtual 
machines (VM1 and VM2), with one dedicated to each version. At the time of this writing, 
ActionScript 2.0 is still in use (although much less frequently) and continues to be supported 
in both Flash CS6 and Flash Player 11. Version 3.0, however, not only adds many features 
and improvements in speed and performance but is considered the preferred standard for most 
movies.
ActionScript 3.0 is built upon object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts that make 
it modular and performance-oriented, which is essential for building large-scale Flash 
applications. In this book, you’ll be working exclusively with ActionScript 3.0. It’s important to 
note that if you are publishing to Flash Player 8 or earlier, you cannot use ActionScript 3.0.
Take Note...
If you are unsure which version to use, it’s recommended that you stick with ActionScript 
3.0. However, make sure that your project has no special requirements that would require you 
to publish for a much earlier version of Flash Player. Versions of Flash Player earlier than 
9.0 do not support ActionScript 3.0.

Where Do I Place ActionScript?
Introduction to Adobe Flash Professional CS6
286
Lesson 9
Where Do I Place ActionScript?
ActionScript is placed on keyframes along the timeline using the Actions Panel or the Code 
Snippets panel. Just as you would create a keyframe and place graphical content on it, you can 
add ActionScript code to a keyframe to have your movie do something at a speciﬁc point along 
the timeline.
In some more advanced and complex scenarios, you can also place ActionScript in external 
ﬁles that can be then referenced from your movie. Older versions of ActionScript (2.0 
and earlier) also support placing ActionScript directly on symbol instances (although this 
widely considered to be a bad practice). For all the exercises in this lesson, you’ll be placing 
ActionScript along the timeline as ActionScript 3.0 requires.
The Code Snippets Panel
While the capabilities of ActionScript are something every Flash designer should take 
advantage of, there is often a learning curve associated with any coding language, especially 
if you have limited scripting or interactive design experience. Flash CS6 helps to get you up-
and-running quickly with the Code Snippets panel, which gives you one-click access to pre-
created code blocks that handle everything from timeline navigation and animation tasks to 
loading and controlling audio and video.
These code snippets can be easily added to the timeline, saving you time as well as the need to 
create code by hand. You’ll learn how to use the Code Snippets panel later in this lesson, and 
use it again in later lessons to help accelerate some common coding tasks. As you become more 
experienced with ActionScript, you can even add Code Snippets of your own.
An important note about Publish settings
You must adjust the ActionScript version as part of your Publish settings to match your 
preferred version of ActionScript. 
Follow these steps to adjust the Publish settings
Step-by-Step
1. Make sure that no objects on the Stage are selected, and choose File > Publish Settings as 
shown in Figure 9-2.
Figure 9-2: Access your Publish settings through  
the File menu.

2. From the Script drop-down in the top right corner, make sure that ActionScript 3.0 is 
selected (Figure 9-3) and press OK. 
Figure 9-3: Set your ActionScript version using the Script drop-down menu in the  
Publish Settings panel.
Take Note...
You can also access the Script drop-down menu from the Property Inspector when nothing on 
the Stage is selected.
The Actions panel at work
The Actions panel is a script wizard, text editor, and code-checker, all in one (Figure 9-4). 
To open the Actions panel, choose Window > Actions, or press F9 (Windows) or Option+F9 
(Mac OS). Note: On many laptops, you will need to add the function (fn) key: Fn+Option+F9.
Figure 9-4: Open the Actions panel by choosing Window > Actions.
Here you build scripts (groups of actions) and place them in your movie. You can type scripts 
directly into the panel, choose scripts from drop-down menus, or use the Actions toolbox, 
which is a categorized menu of actions on the left side of the panel. To use the toolbox, double-
click the script or click and drag it to the window on the right. You can use actions from the 
toolbox and drop-down menu in either standard or Script Assist mode.

Lesson 9
Standard (default) script editing mode 
By default, the Actions panel opens up in a standard editing mode that lets you type freely 
in the Script window on the right. In this mode, you can still insert scripts from the Actions 
toolbox on the left, or by using the Add a new item to the script button ( ) at the top. This 
mode is generally recommended for users who are more experienced with ActionScript or 
comfortable with typing code in general.
Using Script Assist
For the novice user, the thought of dealing with a new scripting language can be 
overwhelming. Because ActionScript is very sensitive to both case and spelling, trying to type 
code freely before you’re comfortable with the language can result in errors. To spend more 
time working and less time troubleshooting, try the drop-down menus or the Actions toolbox 
in Script Assist mode, which function together like a wizard that lets you pick, modify, and 
apply scripts without the need to type directly into the script window (Figure 9-5). After 
choosing your ready-made actions, you can tweak them with a series of form and menu 
controls at the top of the Actions panel. Script Assist is a great way to add simple actions to a 
movie to provide playback controls.
Figure 9-5: Script Assist mode lets you modify scripts with menus and type-in boxes.
Adding and removing actions
You can enter Script Assist mode at any time by pressing the Script Assist button in the upper-
right corner of the Actions panel. When in Script Assist mode, clicking Add a new item to the 
script button ( ) at the top of the script window adds actions, and clicking Delete the selected 
action(s) button ( ) removes them. If you need to reorder scripts, use the Move the selected 
action(s) up ( ) and Move the selected action(s) down ( ) buttons. You’ll learn more about this 
mode later in this lesson.
As you highlight lines of code in the script window, menus will appear at the top of the 
Actions panel that let you adjust and set options for the selected action.

Adding actions to frames with the Code Snippets Panel
Adding actions to frames with the Code Snippets Panel
With a ﬁrm grasp of ActionScript fundamentals, you’re ready to do some real work on the 
project. In this exercise, you’ll use ActionScript to prevent the animation from looping, which is 
the default behavior of the Flash Player. Since you are most likely new to ActionScript, you’ll get 
up-and-running quickly using the new Code Snippets panel to handle the heavy lifting for you.
Adding a stop() action
To stop a Timeline at a speciﬁc point, or prevent an animation from looping when it reaches 
the end, you use the stop( ) action. A stop( ) action halts playback at the frame upon which 
you place it. When you test, preview, or publish a movie, the default behavior of the Flash 
Player is to loop playback; stop( ) actions override that behavior to ensure that the movie 
doesn’t loop unnecessarily. 
Follow these steps to add a stop action in the Timeline
Step-by-Step
1. If it’s not already open, choose File > Open and open the ﬁle named ﬂ0901_work.ﬂa, 
which you saved earlier.
Take Note...
Although you aren’t required to place actions on their own layer, it’s a good practice to help 
avoid accidentally selecting a script versus an object on the Stage (and vice versa). Common 
practice is to keep a layer named actions at the top of the layer stack.
2. Select the cat layer in the Timeline, and click the New Layer button ( ) to add a new layer 
above this one. Double-click on the layer name and type actions to rename the layer. It’s 
considered a good practice to create a dedicated layer just for ActionScript.
3. Test the movie using Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional. Notice that the 
animation continues to loop back to the beginning. Let’s change that.
4. Like any object on the Stage, actions can be placed on keyframes only. As shown in 
Figure 9-6, select frame 42 on the new Actions layer, and create a new keyframe by 
pressing the F6 shortcut key.
Figure 9-6: As a matter of good practice, always create a dedicated layer for your ActionScript.

5. Select the new keyframe, and open the Code Snippets panel (Figure 9-7) by pressing the 
Code Snippets button (
) on the right side of your workspace or by choosing Window > 
Code Snippets. 
Figure 9-7: Once you’ve created a new keyframe,  
open the Code Snippets panel.
6. Within the Code Snippets panel, you’ll see snippets organized into several named 
folders. Locate and double-click the Timeline Navigation folder to expand it as shown in 
Figure 9-8. Locate the snippet named Stop At This Frame, and double-click it. 
The Actions Panel will launch, and the code from the selected snippet will be 
automatically added to Actions Panel at this keyframe (Figure 9-9). You should see a 
comment with some descriptive text and the statement stop( ); directly below it.

snippet.
Take Note...
You may notice descriptive text in the Actions panel above or below certain lines of code. These 
are referred to as comments and are lanked by the characters /* and */ to separate them from 
real code and prevent them from being interpreted. You can use comments to annotate your code 
and describe its purpose and functionality.

Lesson 9: Introducing ActionScript 
Adding actions to frames with the Code Snippets Panel
7. Close the Actions panel and look at the frame (Figure 9-10). The icon that looks like a 
lowercase a indicates that the frame contains actions that will run when the playhead passes 
it during playback.
Figure 9-10: The lowercase a icon indicates that actions exist on frame 42.
8. Test your movie by choosing Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional. The 
animation should play and stop abruptly at frame 42, exactly where you placed the action. 
The bird hops across the Stage and then perches on the cat. Close the preview.
9. Choose File > Save to save your work.
Placing a goto action using the Actions Panel
To make the playhead jump forward or backward to a speciﬁc frame, turn to the goto actions. 
The two variations—gotoAndStop( ) and gotoAndPlay( )—jump to a speciﬁc frame, then 
stop playback and resume playback from that point, respectively. In this exercise, you’ll explore 
these actions and get a little practice adding and subtracting actions.
This time, you’ll be using the Actions Panel, and more speciﬁcally the Script Assist, which will 
help you build actions without hand-typing any code. This is a slightly diferent approach from 
the Code Snippets panel in the sense that you’ll be building your own actions rather than using 
pre-created ones.
Follow these steps to add a goto action using the Actions panel
Step-by-Step
1. Select frame 42 on your Actions layer, and launch the Actions panel (Window > Actions). 
You must ﬁrst remove the stop( ) action and comment created by the Code Snippets 
panel.
2. When the Actions Panel appears, press the Script Assist button in the upper-right corner. 
The top of the Actions Panel expands to indicate that you are in Script Assist mode.

3. Click in the Script window to select the comment above the stop( ) action. As displayed 
in Figure 9-11, click the Delete the selected action(s) button ( ) to delete the comment. 
Click the button twice more to remove the last two lines remaining in the Actions panel, 
including the stop( ); action, until the Script window is clear.
Figure 9-11: Remove comments and stop( ) action on frame 42. 
4. Keep the Actions panel open. Press the Add a new item to the script button ( ) and 
choose ﬂash.display > MovieClip > Methods > gotoAndStop. You may notice that 
gotoAndStop( ) and stop( ) are found in the same location. These are both methods of 
the MovieClip class. It’s not too important to know exactly what that means, but simply 
put, it means that MovieClips can do things like stop, play, and go to speciﬁed points on 
their Timelines. Because ActionScript 3.0 is an object-oriented programming language, all 
the actions you add will be found grouped with the objects they relate to. 
Take Note...
If you would like to further your knowledge of the key diferences and new features in 
ActionScript 3.0, check out the articles and tutorials on Adobe’s Developer Network site at 
adobe.com/devnet/.
5. In the Object text ﬁeld, type this. Just like the stop( ) action from earlier, the this 
keyword tells Flash which Timeline you are referring to. A little later, you’ll see how 
useful this ﬁeld can be.

Lesson 9: Introducing ActionScript 
Adding actions to frames with the Code Snippets Panel
6. Right below the Object text ﬁeld, type 20 in the frame text ﬁeld (Figure 9-12). 
ActionScript is very logical. If you’re telling the Timeline to go somewhere and stop, you 
have to tell it where to go and stop. You can use frame numbers, or add labels to your 
frames. Close the Actions panel.
Figure 9-12: Your script window with the gotoAndStop( ) action added.
7. Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional to preview your movie. The bird 
jumps onto the cat’s head and then quickly changes his mind and jumps back to a safe 
distance. Close the preview.
8. Choose File > Save and keep this document open for the next section.
Deﬁnition: Parameters
You may see the word Parameters a lot in the Actions panel. Parameters are additional pieces of 
information you feed to ActionScript functions to make them work. For instance, gotoAndPlay( ) 
requires you to specify a frame number, a parameter it uses to complete its task. Many functions 
in ActionScript take parameters, some that are required and some that are optional.
You enter parameters for selected actions using the menus and type-in fields that appear at the top 
of the Actions panel in Script Assist mode.

Controlling Movie Clip Timelines
Follow these steps to control Movie Clip Timelines
Step-by-Step
1. Open the Actions panel by choosing Window > Actions from the main menu. Click 
on frame 42 of the Actions layer to make sure you’re adding actions to this frame. The 
gotoAndStop( ) action you added in the last section should still be hanging around here. 
You may remember from the ﬁnished ﬁle that this animation will feature an intense and 
indeﬁnite standof between cat and bird. Let’s swap out that gotoAndStop( ) action with a 
simple stop( ) action and then move on to some ﬁner points of this animation.
2. Press the Delete the selected action(s) button twice to clear out the actions panel. Now 
click the Add a new item to the script button and choose ﬂash.display > MovieClip > 
Methods > stop. Hopefully this enigmatic menu is getting a bit more familiar at this point. 
You’ll use it pretty frequently.
3. Type this in the Object text ﬁeld. The Actions panel should look like Figure 9-13 below 
when complete. Close the Actions panels when you are done.
Figure 9-13: Swap out the gotoAndStop( ) action for a stop( ) action.
4. You may not have noticed, but the bird and cat are twitching and blinking respectively 
throughout the movie. It may be nice to hold of these movements until the bird has 
alighted atop the cat. You can stop and play the bird and cat Eye timelines the same way 
you stop and play the main timeline. But ﬁrst you’ll need a way to refer to each of these 
objects.
5. Using the Selection tool ( ), click on the bird Movie Clip on the Stage as shown in 
Figure 9-14. Click on the Properties tab to make sure the Property Inspector is accessible. 
Take Note...
The Actions panel often interferes with your access of objects on the Stage. Refer to Lesson 7 
for tips on managing your workspace. Most Flash users who rely heavily on scripting create 
custom workspaces to help manage this sometimes cumbersome panel.

In the Object text ﬁeld, type bird_mc. In this case you’re not stopping the main timeline, 
you’re stopping the bird timeline. For more information on Movie Clips and managing 
their timelines, refer to Lesson 12, “Introducing Movie Clips.”
8. Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional. The bird no longer twitches. In 
the next section, you’ll start the twitching animation at the end of the hopping animation 
on the main Timeline; ﬁrst, get some practice by stopping the eye animation. In this case 
there are two eyes, so you’ll have to do it twice.

Functions
In the next section, you’ll use ActionScript to trigger the bird and eye animations after the bird 
hops onto the cat’s head. There are a number of ways to make this happen, but in this case, 
you’ll explore creating a reusable function to take care of this task.
Functions are one of a handful of elements that are common to almost every programming 
language. They allow you to group a number of statements together and then run them 
when needed. Imagine teaching someone how to change the toner in a copy machine. There 
are probably a handful of steps that never really change. Instead of posting your telephone 
number on the copier and walking people through the process every time it needs to be done, 
you could write up a set of instructions that they could follow on their own. The key to this 
concept is reusability. It may take a bit longer at the onset, but it will save you a lot of time in 
the long run.
In this exercise, you’ll be removing the safety net by disabling the Script Assist, and coding this 
task entirely by hand. It’s important to remember to follow the instructions carefully, and be 
conscious of case and spelling (ActionScript is pretty touchy about those things!).
Follow these steps to write code in the ActionScript panel
Step-by-Step
1. Make sure the Actions panel is open with frame 1 of the Actions layer selected. You should 
see the actions you added in the last section. For this section, you’ll turn of Script Assist and 
get your feet wet with a little hand coding. Don’t worry, it won’t hurt that much. You might 
even ﬁnd it a bit easier than wading through the menus in Script Assist.

2. Click on the Script Assist button to turn of Script Assist (Figure 9-17). Writing in the 
ActionScript panel is just like writing in a text editor. 
Figure 9-17: The Actions panel with Script Assist disabled.
3. Click at the end of line 4, after the semi-colon, and press Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Mac OS) twice. With the cursor blinking on line 6, type:
function playClips(){
}
As shown in Figure 9-18, be sure to include the space between function and playClips, the 
opening and closing parenthesis characters after playClips, and the opening and closing 
curly braces after the parentheses. 
Figure 9-18: Add a function named playClips in the Actions panel.
4. Place the cursor at the end of line 6 and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). Your 
cursor should be blinking and indented on line 7. Indenting the code inside functions is 
helpful for reading it later. Type the following lines to make the bird twitch and the cat’s 
eyes blink:
bird_mc.play();
leye_mc.play();
reye_mc.play();

Lesson 9
The Actions panel should look like the Figure 9-19 when you’re ﬁnished.
Figure 9-19: Add three statements inside the new playClips function.
Take Note...
Curly braces deine the beginning and end of one or more lines of grouped, or related code. 
The placement of curly braces on the same or following line after a function name is up to 
you, and is more a personal decision than anything. The code will work exactly the same 
regardless of whether you choose to keep curly braces and code on the same line or on dedicated 
lines, but in some cases spreading them out may result in more readable code.
5. Choose File > Save and then Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional. It’s a bit 
anticlimactic, but nothing has changed. This is an important lesson about functions. They 
must be called in order to run. Going back to the copy machine analogy, the instructions 
for changing toner only get used when the toner needs changing. In this case, you’ll call 
the playClips function when you want the clips to play.

Congratulations! You have ﬁnished the lesson.
Wrapping up
ActionScript ofers a world of possibilities. Lesson 10, “Creating Navigation Controls,” 
demonstrates how you can apply ActionScript to buttons to create controls and navigation. 
There you’ll learn the power of another ActionScript staple: event listeners, and event handlers. 
Event handlers are speciﬁc functions that tell your movie what to do in response to a button 
or keyboard action. Because a button can be clicked, rolled over, released, or pressed and held 
down, event listeners help the button sort out when to perform which action, whether it’s 
jumping to a frame on the Timeline, stopping playback, or launching a website in a browser 
window. Unlike frame-based actions, button-based actions can occur at any time, or not at all, 
based on what the user chooses to do.

One of the great things about Flash is combining diferent methods to produce interesting 
animations without having to do a ton of code work or animation work. Once you learn the 
tools, you’ll ﬁnd ways to streamline the process of animation in more eicient ways. 
Logo animation
Project 1
You need to create a new logo animation for the company. You’ve explained a couple of 
your animation ideas but your boss can’t quite picture it. She’s asked you to create a quick 
simulation before you go through the trouble of animating the logo. You need to come up 
with something quickly since decisions have to be made before a big meeting. The logo has a 
square-ish shape to it so you’ll use a rectangle to simulate the logo as a placeholder. 
1. Create a new ActionScript 3.0 document in Flash.
2. Select the Rectangle tool, set the ill color to green, the stroke to none and make sure 
you’re in Object Drawing mode. Draw a rectangle on the Stage.
3. Choose the Selection tool and make sure the green rectangle is selected on the 
Stage. Choose Modify > Covert to Symbol, save the symbol as movie clip named 
logo animation.
4. With the symbol still selected on the Stage, go to the Properties panel. In the Instance 
Name ield, enter the name logo. 
5. Choose Window > Code Snippets. 
6. Click on the arrow next to the Animation folder. You’ll try a couple of options and 
compare.
7. Select the Fade In a Movie Clip animation. Click on the {} button and then the Insert 
button. 
8. Preview the animation of the logo movie clip by choosing Ctrl/Cmd+Enter/Return.

Undoing and redoing is all well and good while you’re experimenting but what about during 
the presentation? Again, there are diferent ways to approach this but let’s try one that involves 
enabling and disabling code just for practice. 
1. The logo_animation.ﬂa ﬁle should still be open.
2. You’ve already got the Rotate Continuously animation applied. Click on the keyframe in 
frame 1 of the Actions layer and choose Window > Actions.
3. Select the code from line 11 to line 16 and click the Apply block comment button in the 
top row of buttons to comment the code out and disable it. 
4. Hide the Actions panel and reselect the logo animation movie clip on the Stage. 
5. Go to Window > Code Snippets, then click on the animation called Fade In a Movie 
Clip. Press the {} and then the Insert button.
6. Preview the animation, the only one you should see is the fade in. 
7. When you go into the presentation, show the fade in ﬁrst. When ﬁnished, open the 
Actions panel, comment out the Fade in a Movie Clip code, reselect code lines 11-16 and 
press the Remove Comment button. Preview and demonstrate the rotation animation. 
8. Save and keep this ﬁle open.
Hey! That’s a lot of code 
Project 3
Staring at a ton of code can start to bug your eyes out, especially if you’re more designer and 
less coder. Let’s clean up the code a bit and make it a little more manageable for our eyes. 
1. The logo_animation.ﬂa ﬁle should still be open.
2. Open the Actions Panel.
3. Select the code from line 1 to line 16. Click the Collapse Selection button. 
4. Select the remaining code and click the Collapse Selection button again. 
5. Click on the code blocks and the plus signs to the left to open and close as needed.

Business case
Another major aspect to the use of Flash is creating projects that are interactive 
and navigational. Learning interactivity will allow you to create fully animated 
interactive websites that will transform your static projects into dynamic, moving, 
eye-catching pieces that instantly grab the attention of the viewer and keep them 
engaged enough to want to explore the rest of your site. 
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
preferences. See “Resetting the Flash workspace” in the Starting up section of this book. 
You will work with several ﬁles from the ﬂ10lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that you have 
loaded the ﬂlessons folder onto your hard drive from http://www.wiley.com/college/sc/adobeseries. See 
“Loading lesson ﬁles” in the Starting up section of this book.
The project
In this lesson, you’ll be designing a mini-site project for the talkShop retail cellphone store. 
You’ll build a few buttons, then link them to key points within the Flash movie and a sample 
website. For a preview of the ﬁnal result, open the ﬂ1002_done.ﬂa ﬁle in the ﬂ10lessons 
folder. Close the ﬁle when you are ﬁnished, or keep it open as a reference.

Working with button symbols
Introduction to Adobe Flash Professional CS6

Lesson 10
Working with button symbols
Buttons are one of three symbol types in Flash, and, like all symbols, they live in the library 
and are managed from the Library panel. Buttons are designed speciﬁcally to react to the user’s 
mouse and keyboard actions. Like other symbol instances, each button instance can have its own 
transformation and color characteristics. In addition, button symbols have ﬁlter eﬀects applied 
from the Property Inspector, and can be assigned instance names for ActionScript control.
To understand the anatomy of a button, you’ll now open a sample ﬁle with a button instance 
so that you can explore a button symbol and its diﬀerent components:
Follow these steps to explore button symbol components
Step-by-Step
1. Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the ﬂ10lessons folder and open 
the ﬁle named ﬂ1001.ﬂa.
2. On the Stage, you see a single button. Double-click this button to enter its Edit mode, and 
to view its Timeline as shown in Figure 10-1.
Figure 10-1: Button symbols have a unique, four-frame Timeline.
3. You’ll see here that a button symbol has a unique Timeline featuring four main frames in 
each layer—Up, Over, Down, and Hit. Each represents a button’s appearance in diﬀerent 
states of use. Navigate through a button’s frames by clicking on the frame ruler, or by 
using the < and > (comma and period) keys.
The Up state is the button’s default appearance when it’s just sitting on the Stage without 
any user interaction. By default, when you convert Stage graphics to a button symbol, they 
are automatically placed on the Up frame. 
The Over state displays when the mouse pointer moves over a button. This indicates to 
the user that the button is a control that can carry out some action in your movie. You 
can characterize the Over state with anything from a simple color or text change to an 
animation or sound.
When the user presses down on the mouse button, the button symbol changes to its Down 
state. It remains in its Down state until the user releases the button. Because the Down 
state is visible only brieﬂy during a typical mouse click, customizing a button’s Down state 
with a long animation or sound is not the best idea.

Lesson 10

Lesson 10: Creating Navigation Controls 
Working with button symbols
The Hit area deﬁnes the hot spot where the button becomes active when the user moves 
over it (Figure 10-2). This state is never visible, and content placed on the Hit frame 
deﬁnes only the active area.
Figure 10-2: The contents of  
the Hit frame deine the clickable,  
or ‘hot,’ area of a button. 
This is especially crucial for buttons that are small, have an irregular shape, or contain 
only text with no underlying shape. Because the Hit area deﬁnes the active area of the 
button and is not visible, the size and shape of the content on the Hit frame matters 
most—color choice, for instance, has no eﬀect on the button’s operation. In fact, it’s pretty 
common in Flash animations to create completely invisible buttons. Buttons that only have 
a hit state so that you can deﬁne a speciﬁc area of the animation as a clickable area.
Take Note...
What makes a good Hit state? The best Hit states are solid shapes that are generally as big 
as, or slightly bigger than, the visible states of the button. If your button changes shape from 
state to state, consider choosing a shape for the Hit state that is fairly neutral and encompasses 
as much of the visible area of the button as possible.
4. Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional to preview the button in the Flash 
Player. Move your mouse pointer over the button, and then click it to see how it switches 
between its various states as the mouse interacts with it (Figure 10-3). Then close the 
preview window.

user moves their pointer over them.

Lesson 10
Building buttons
With a solid introduction to button symbol theory, you’re ready to begin work on the project. The 
ﬁrst step is to create a new button symbol and design its Up, Over, and Down states. 
Follow these steps to create a new button
Step-by-Step
1. Choose File > Open and navigate to the ﬂ10lessons folder. Select the ﬂ1002.ﬂa ﬁle and 
choose Open. In Figure 10-4 you see a mini-site project for the talkShop retail cell-phone 
store.
Figure 10-4: The talkShop project ile you will be working with.
2. Before you modify this ﬁle, choose File > Save As. When the Save As dialog box appears, 
type ﬂ1002_work.ﬂa into the Save As text ﬁeld. Navigate to the ﬂ10lessons folder and 
press Save. 
First, you’ll create a button very much the same way you’d create any other symbol—from 
existing graphics on the Stage.
3. Click on the rounded rectangle and the arrow on the right side of the Stage under the 
talkShop logo. Choose Modify > Convert to Symbol. In the Convert to Symbol dialog 
box, type Products Button as the name, and set the Type to Button. Set the registration 
point to the upper left as shown in Figure 10-5, and click OK to create the new symbol.
Figure 10-5: Select graphics on the Stage and use Modify > Convert  
to Symbol to convert them to a button symbol.
4. The next step will be to add to your button by designing the additional states (Over, 
Down, Hit). Double-click on your new button to enter its Edit mode.

Working with button symbols
5. The ﬁrst state you’ll design is the Over state, which is how the button will appear if and 
when the user rolls their mouse pointer over it.
Select Over frame directly on the layer. As with any other Timeline, you need to create 
a keyframe to put content here. Use the F6 shortcut key or choose Insert > Timeline > 
Keyframe to insert a keyframe here (Figure 10-6).
The graphics from the Up keyframe will be duplicated; take a moment to make some 
changes, such as color, to this copy, to make it distinctive from the Up frame. You may 
need to ungroup the box and the arrow graphics to change their colors individually. 
Select the graphics and ungroup by choosing Modify > Ungroup. Click anywhere in the 
background to deselect, then click on the button to select it. Click on the Fill color swatch 
and choose a grey color.
Figure 10-6: Add a keyframe to the Over state to design a unique look for your button when the mouse pointer  
rolls over it.
6. Next, you’ll design the Down state, which is how your button appears when the mouse 
pointer is clicked and held down on it. Select the Down frame, and use the F6 shortcut key 
to insert a keyframe here.
Again, click anywhere in the background to deselect, and then click on the grey button to 
select it. Click on the Fill color swatch and choose an orange color.
7. Finally, select the Hit frame, and use the F6 shortcut key to create a keyframe here (Figure 
10-7). The Hit frame is not visible, but determines the clickable area of your entire button. 
For this reason, you should generally use a solid shape (color is unimportant) that is 
the same size as, if not bigger than, your button. In this case, you can use the graphics 
themselves to set the Hit state, as they accurately represent the size and shape of the button. 
Leave the duplicated graphics on this keyframe as-is (Figure 10-8).
Figure 10-7: Create a keyframe on the Hit state.  
Figure 10-8: Use the duplicated graphics from the  
 
Down state to set the Hit area.
8. Exit your new button by clicking the Scene 1 link above the Stage to return to the main 
Timeline.

Button design tips
When designing a project, you want to maintain consistency throughout the project so that the 
experience is familiar to the user. Providing consistent navigation, colors, and fonts helps to 
provide continuity in a project and making sure that the location of buttons and menus is intuitive 
provides the user with a familiar and enjoyable experience as well. When designing buttons, keep 
your users in mind and follow these guidelines: 
• Aim for an interesting design that makes the navigation process easy for users to understand. An 
interesting-looking button may entice users to click on it.
• Make a button’s purpose clear. Although you already know what all your buttons do, and 
where they’ll lead, users aren’t as familiar as you are with what’s going on. Design buttons with 
familiar shapes (for example, a Play button that looks like a forward arrow), or label buttons 
with text if necessary.
• Make buttons easy to find. If the buttons are hard to pick out on the interface, or if their 
functions are unclear, your interactive project becomes a frustrating experience for the user. 
Also, let the content drive the need for buttons. Know the sections you want to include in your 
project before you start to design the buttons. Developing content as you design your buttons can 
slow you down. A flowchart is a simple way to plan basic layout and navigation, and gives you a 
blueprint to work from when setting up your movie in Flash. 
Take Note...
If a hit keyframe is not created (or empty), a button uses the contents of the last available 
keyframe as the Hit area. This works across all layers, so be cautious not to let your button 
use a non-graphic keyframe for its Hit area (such as an empty keyframe or one that contains 
a sound). The result may be a non-clickable button!

Adding text to a button
Like other symbols, and like the main Timeline itself, buttons can have multiple layers. Using 
layers helps you to create more complex designs and add more information while keeping 
everything carefully organized. In this exercise, you’ll add a new layer to incorporate text into 
your button.
Follow these steps to add text to a button
Step-by-Step
1. Double-click your new button on the Stage to enter its Edit mode.
2. Press the New Layer button below the Timeline to add a new layer to your button as 
shown in Figure 10-10. Rename the layer Text. 
Figure 10-10: Add a new layer and name it Text. You can layer graphics and content in button Timelines just like  
you can on the main Timeline.
3. Select your Text tool ( ) from the Tools panel. Make sure the new layer is selected, and 
click slightly to the right of the white arrow on your button. Type the word Products, 
and switch to your Selection tool ( ).
4. Leave the text frame selected, and locate the Character options on the Property Inspector 
on the right. Choose Arial from the Family drop-down menu, and set the Size value to 18 
pt, and the color to White (#FFFFFF).
If necessary, use your Selection tool ( ) or the arrows keys on your keyboard to reposition 
the text on the button (Figure 10-11).

Duplicating and modifying buttons
Why build a completely new button when you can copy and modify an existing one? Using 
the Library panel’s Duplicate command is faster, and it ensures that new buttons are consistent 
with those you’ve already created. 
Follow these steps to duplicate and modify a button
Step-by-Step
1. In the Library panel, select the Products Button symbol. If necessary, choose Window > 
Library to open the Library panel.
2. Choose Duplicate from the Library panel menu as shown in Figure 10-13.
Figure 10-13: Make a copy of your Products  
Button symbol in the library using its panel  
menu’s Duplicate command.
When the Duplicate Symbol dialog box appears, type the name Home Button. Leave 
the Type set as Button and press OK. A new copy of your original button, named Home 
Button, now appears in the Library panel.
3. Drag an instance of the Home Button to the Stage, and place it directly below your 
Products Button on the same layer. Double-click it to edit it in place.

Testing buttons on the Stage
Once you’ve added buttons to the Stage, you can conveniently test their behaviors and appearance 
directly within the authoring environment using the Enable Simple Buttons command. Enable 
Simple Buttons lets you quickly test button behavior without launching the Flash Player, and 
prevents you from selecting, moving, or editing buttons on the Stage.
To use Enable Simple Buttons:
1. 
Choose Control > Enable Simple Buttons.
2. 
Roll over and click your buttons as you normally would, to test their behavior.
3. 
When ﬁnished, choose Control > Enable Simple Buttons to toggle it back oﬀ. 
Keep in mind that most ActionScript behavior is limited in this mode, and requires you to 
preview your movie using Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional instead. In addition, you 
cannot move or edit button instances until Enable Simple Buttons is toggled back off.
Creating text-based buttons
Text-based buttons work diﬀerently because they are formed only from the character 
outlines that form your text, with no signiﬁcant solid area or shape that deﬁnes them. A 
problem with text buttons is that if the mouse pointer is not precisely on a type character, the 
button remains inactive, appearing not to work. This is where the Hit area comes into play. By 
deﬁning a hot spot in the Hit frame of your button, you create a solid and easy target for users 
to click. 
Follow these steps to set a Hit area for a text-based button
Step-by-Step
1. Choose Insert > New Symbol.
2. When the Create New Symbol dialog box appears, name the symbol Learn More, and set 
the symbol Type as Button. Press OK. The main Timeline disappears, and you are brought 
into the edit mode for your new symbol. The Stage appears empty for now.
3. Choose the Text tool ( ) from the Tools panel, then click on the Stage and type 
Learn how to create sites like this.
4. Highlight the text and use the Character options on the Property Inspector to set the text 
to Verdana, 10pt, white (#FFFFFF) type (Figure 10-16). Note that you can use the Zoom 
tool to zoom in on the Stage to make working with small text easier.

light orange (#FFCC33). 
7. Insert a keyframe in the Down frame. Select the text, and use the color swatch in the 
Property Inspector to set its color to pale grey (#CCCCCC).
8. Finally, you will need to set a Hit area for your button. Because the Hit area relies on solid areas, 
type will only be clickable on the characters themselves, making it diicult to interact with your 
button. Instead, you’ll use a solid shape (such as a rectangle) to set the Hit area.
Select the Hit frame of your button, and use the F6 shortcut key to insert a keyframe there.

Creating frame labels for ActionScript
Introduction to Adobe Flash Professional CS6
318
Lesson 10
Creating frame labels for ActionScript
Now that you’ve built your navigation buttons, you’ll learn to use ActionScript to have those 
buttons jump to diﬀerent points on the Timeline that represent your diﬀerent sections, such as 
Home, Products, and Services. To help you easily accomplish frame-to-frame navigation, you 
can name individual keyframes using frame labels.
Frame labels are a convenient alternative to using frame numbers for navigation, as they allow 
you to assign casual names (such as home) to a keyframe, and use that within ActionScript. In 
addition, labels as anchors reference labels in actions. Using frame numbers in ActionScript means 
that if you change the location of a piece of content along the Timeline, you’ll likely have to 
change the frame number you’re referencing. 
Frame labels, however, travel with their respective keyframes, so it doesn’t matter where the 
keyframe is along the Timeline, as long as the frame label remains the same. You can also 
use labels to add comments or notes for yourself directly on a layer in the Timeline. Labels 
help to organize content on the timeline more eiciently and can even be used to document 
information by typing content into the label.
Follow these steps to use frame labels
Step-by-Step
1. Make sure you have the Buttons layer selected, and click the New Layer button ( ) to add 
a new layer. Rename the new layer Labels. 
2. Insert keyframes at frames 5 and 10, using the F6 shortcut key—this lines up with the 
placement of the diﬀerent content sections on the Timeline (Figure 10-20). 
Figure 10-20: Create a new layer named Labels, and add keyframes at frames 5 and 10, where you’ll be creating  
frame labels.

the Name text ﬁeld in the Label options area to set a frame label for this frame as shown 
in Figure 10-21. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). You should see a red ﬂag 
icon ( ) appear inside the keyframe. 
Figure 10-21: Type a frame label of home for  
keyframe 1 on the Labels layer. You’ll add frame  
labels for keyframes 5 and 10 as well.
4. Repeat step 3, this time add the label products at frame 5 and the label specials at 
frame 10 (Figure 10-22). 
Figure 10-22: The inished layer, which now contains three frame labels that you can later navigate to.
Later on, you’ll reference these frame labels in ActionScript to tell your navigation buttons 
where to send the playhead to view diﬀerent sections of content across the Timeline.
Take Note...
The Notes layer is created using a frame label set as a comment. Comments place text across 
the layer itself and are useful for making notes directly on the Timeline, just like the lesson 
ile does here. Please note, however, that comments cannot be used for navigation like frame 
labels. To set a frame label as a comment, type text in the Property Inspector’s Frame text 
ield and choose Comment from the Type menu.

Tying it all together with event listeners
Introduction to Adobe Flash Professional CS6

Lesson 10
Adding ActionScript: Events and event handlers
You’ve already explored basic ActionScript in Lesson 9, “Introducing ActionScript,” and 
learned to navigate the Timeline using frame-based actions. While working with buttons 
involves some similar code, there are some new concepts you’ll need to familiarize yourself 
with to get your buttons up-and-running.
The process of scripting buttons revolves around two important items: events and event 
listeners.
Understanding events
Simply put, an event is an occurrence that triggers something else to happen. In the case of 
ActionScript, events occur, and blocks of ActionScript known as event handlers, run in 
response to those events.
If you are an employee at a company, you respond to events each day. When you receive phone 
calls, e-mails, or direct requests from managers and other staﬀ, you respond to those events by 
carrying out certain tasks. Very often, those tasks are outlined ahead of time (for example, ile an 
expense report or design a logo) so you’re ready to respond when the time is right.
Some events you’ve become accustomed to during typical website navigation include mouse 
clicks, rollovers, and keyboard presses.
Responding to events with event handlers
An event handler is a block of ActionScript code that runs in response to an event. Event 
handlers are essentially ActionScript functions, or named blocks of code that can be reused over 
and over again throughout a movie. Any block of code that is designed speciﬁcally to respond 
to an event, however, always falls into the category of event handlers.
Once you’ve chosen an event, and created an event handler, you assign the pair to a speciﬁc 
button or control on the Stage using an event listener.
Take Note...
A detailed exercise on creating and using functions is included in Lesson 9, “Introducing 
ActionScript.”
Tying it all together with event listeners
Event listeners assign a trigger event (such as a click) and an event handler to a speciﬁc button 
or control on the Stage. Every item in a Flash movie capable of triggering events (such as 
Button or Movie Clip symbols, and even the Stage) can be assigned an event/event handler 
pair using the addEventListener( ) method. 
You can call this method from a speciﬁc button instance, and tell it what type of event to listen 
for, and what event handler to use if that event occurs:
mybutton_btn.addEventListener(“click”, myEventHandler);
Certification  
Ready 4.11
What are some 
event-handling 
concepts in 
ActionScript 3.0?

Lesson 10
321
Lesson 10: Creating Navigation Controls 
Tying it all together with event listeners
To use the employee metaphor from earlier, you could think of your workﬂow represented in 
pseudo-code like this:
employee.addEventListener(“boss calls”, submitExpenseReport);
To code your buttons in the next exercise, you’ll create an event listener function, and then 
attach that function to your button instances using the addEventListener( ) method.
New Term: Method
A method is something that an object, or any copy of that object, is capable of doing. For 
example, a Movie Clip symbol, or any instance of any movie clip, can use its gotoAndStop( ) 
method to jump the playhead to a specific frame and stop.
Using metaphors once again, you can say that every human being has a sleep( ) and eat( ) 
method, and that methods can be called from any instance of a human being. 
Linking buttons to specific frames
Now that you’ve set up frame labels across the timeline, you’ll use ActionScript to link each 
button to a speciﬁc section within your movie. Each frame label corresponds to a speciﬁc 
section of the site, and the end result is when each button is clicked, users will be sent to that 
speciﬁc section within your movie.
Follow these steps to link buttons to speciﬁc frames
Step-by-Step
1. Click to select frame 1 of the Actions layer in the Timeline. Choose Window > Actions to 
open the Actions panel. Make sure that Script Assist mode is not active; you can disable it 
by clicking the Script Assist button in the upper-right corner of the Actions panel.
2. First, you’ll build the event handler that will advance the playhead to the Products section. 
Type the following code on Line 1 in the right side of the Action panel to build the 
framework of your new event handler:
function gotoProducts() {
}
Here the function keyword is followed by an arbitrary name, creating a new block of code 
that you can call later on. The parentheses are a mandatory part of the language and the 
curly braces are used to group several lines of ActionScript together. You’ll add code inside 
of these braces, which the function will run when called.
Take Note...
All ActionScript is case-sensitive. Be conscious of entering code exactly as it’s shown in the 
steps here, including the same casing.

Lesson 10
3. You’ll now add the code necessary to instruct the playhead to jump to the Products section 
when called. On Line 2, in between the two curly braces, add the following line of code:
gotoAndStop(“products”);
The gotoAndStop action should be familiar to you already, except here you are adding it 
to an event handler that may be called at any time. The entire event handler should now 
read:
function gotoProducts() {
gotoAndStop(“products”);
}
You may remember that “products” was the frame label you assigned to keyframe 5 on 
your Timeline, where the Products information is displayed. You could have also typed 
gotoAndStop(5), but using the frame label is more ﬂexible in the event that you decide 
to move content around on the Timeline.
4. Any function that will serve as an event handler (like your gotoProducts function) 
needs a few speciﬁc pieces of code to be fully complete. The ﬁrst item you add lets 
ActionScript know that your function will not return any type of information, but will 
instead perform an action and shut down until it’s next called.
Directly after the parentheses (no spaces), type :void, as shown here:
function gotoProducts():void {
gotoAndStop(“products”);
}
The :void return type is just like saying gives back nothing. While your event handler will 
work without it, it’s a good practice to include it. If nothing else, this visually distinguishes 
this function as an event handler, which can never return a value.
Watch your quotes. It’s important to use only straight quotes and not curly quotes, 
sometimes called typographer’s quotes. Only the straight quotes function properly.

Lesson 10
323
Lesson 10: Creating Navigation Controls 
Tying it all together with event listeners
5. Next, add the following code within the parentheses themselves: 
evt:Event
The entire event handler should now appear like Figure 10-23:
function gotoProducts(evt:Event):void {
gotoAndStop(“products”);
}
Figure 10-23: The code in the Actions panel should now display as shown above.
This little piece of code is referred to as a parameter, or parameter placeholder. It is 
designed to act as a container for any information passed into your event handler when and 
if it’s called. While functions can generally be designed to take any number of parameters, 
event handlers are allowed only one, which is reserved to catch the event information itself.
Here, you’ve created a parameter named evt, which is designed to catch Event-type 
information.
Take Note...
The Event parameter passed to an event handler contains a number of pieces of useful 
information, such as the button/control that captured the event and the type of event (such 
as click) that occurred. At this stage, you won’t use this information, but later on in your 
ActionScript travels, it may prove to be very useful.
6. You’ve completed your event handler for this one section, Close the Actions panel, then 
choose File > Save to save your ﬁle. In just a moment, you’ll add more code to tie it all 
together.

Lesson 10
Adding an event listener to a button
Once you’ve created an event handler, you’ll need to assign it to a control within your movie, 
such as a button instance. This assignment ﬁrst tells a button when to run an event handler, 
and then which event handler to run.
This assignment is created by the addEventListener() method.
Follow these steps to add an event listener to a button
Step-by-Step
1. To target any button instance from ActionScript, you ﬁrst must assign it an instance name. 
Using the Selection tool ( ), click once on the Products Button to select it on the Stage.
2. At the very top of the Property Inspector on the right, locate the instance name text ﬁeld 
box, which sits directly to the right of the symbol icon.
3. Type products_btn as the instance name for the selected button and press Enter 
(Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to commit the change (Figure 10-24). You can now refer 
to this button by this new name anywhere in ActionScript.
Figure 10-24: Before you can assign ActionScript to a button instance, you irst must assign it an instance  
name in the Property Inspector.
4. Press Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS), then double-click on the ﬁrst frame of the 
Actions layer in the Timeline to open the Actions panel.
5. Below the event handler you created in the last exercise, make a line of space, and add the 
following code as shown in Figure 10-25:
products_btn.addEventListener();
Figure 10-25: Insert a new, full line below your existing code and  
add the code that ties it all together.
Here, you’ve targeted the Products Button by the instance name you just assigned to it, 
and called its addEventListener method. This method can be called from any button 
instance to assign it an event/event handler pair.

Lesson 10
325
Lesson 10: Creating Navigation Controls 
Tying it all together with event listeners
6. Next, you’ll ﬁll in the blanks and tell addEventListener two important things: ﬁrst, 
what type of event this button has to receive to respond, and second, which event handler 
to use as its response.
Inside of the parentheses following addEventListener, type “click” (including the 
quotes), like so:
products_btn.addEventListener(“click”);
This lets the button know it’s listening for a single click as its event, or trigger.
7. Finally, you will add one more piece of information inside of the parentheses, which is the 
name of the event handler the button should use as its response when and if it is clicked. 
Within the parentheses, but after the click, add a comma and the name of the event 
handler you created earlier as done in Figure 10-26:
products_btn.addEventListener(“click”,gotoProducts);
Figure 10-26: The completed code as it appears in your Actions panel.
8. Close the Actions panel, and choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional to 
preview your movie. Clicking on the Products Button should now advance you to the 
Products section within your movie (Figure 10-27).
Close the Flash Player and keep the ﬁle open.

Lesson 10
Troubleshooting events, event handlers, and event listeners
Casing or spelling errors in your code may generate errors when you try and test your movie, and 
ultimately prevent your movie from working properly. If the Compiler Errors panel appears on 
preview or publish, and lists any errors, check first for the following:
1. 
Pay careful attention to the line numbers referenced in any errors that come up—they can be 
essential in ﬁnding out exactly where the error lies.
2. 
Use the Check Syntax button at the top of the Actions panel to check for any code errors on 
the spot. This will display a warning dialog if your code is not correct.
3. 
Review the code shown in the lesson steps to check for spelling, casing, or naming errors.
4. 
Make sure that the instance name you assigned your button exactly matches the instance 
name you’re targeting in ActionScript. Even with instance names, a discrepancy in casing or 
spelling will be a problem.
5. 
Look for missing parentheses or curly braces. Curly braces and parentheses always work in 
sets—if you see a starting or ending brace or parenthesis without a mate, this could be your 
problem.
Linking buttons to a website
In addition to linking buttons to speciﬁc frames within your movie, you can instruct them to 
jump to a local web page, external website address, or ﬁle download. 
In this exercise, you’ll use the Code Snippets Panel to add the necessary code to have your 
button jump to an outside website. You worked with the Code Snippets panel in Lesson 9, 
“Introducing ActionScript.” In this exercise, you’ll work with it again as an alternative to 
coding this task by hand.
Introducing navigateToURL() and URLRequest()
The navigateToURL method was introduced in ActionScript 3.0, and is used to instruct 
your movie to open a local or remote web page in a browser or download a ﬁle. You can place 
navigateToURL directly on a keyframe to have it run at a speciﬁc moment in time or, like 
you’re about to do here, add it to an event handler so a URL is opened in conjunction with a 
button click.
Take Note...
Experienced Flash users please note: navigateToURL replaces ActionScript 2.0’s  
getURL() method.
When feeding a URL to just about any ActionScript 3.0 method, that URL ﬁrst needs 
to be wrapped inside of a new URLRequest() object. Think of URLRequest as a fancy 
container that a URL must be placed in before handing it to ActionScript methods such as 
navigateToURL. 
While URLRequest has many uses that go beyond the scope of this book, you’ll get to use a 
single URLRequest object to get one of your buttons to launch an external web page in your 
system’s default web browser. You’ll see how the Code Snippets panel uses these two actions to 
make it all happen.

The Button Library
Project 10-1
Now that you’ve built some buttons from scratch, it’s time to introduce some built-in buttons 
that may provide both convenience and design inspiration. Flash contains some pretty 
extensive choices to get you started with buttons when you may not have the time to come up 
with a design yourself. 
1. Create a new ActionScript 3.0 document in Flash.
2. Choose Window > Common Libraries > Buttons.
3. Click and drag the scroll bar on the side to examine the various categories at your disposal. 
4. Click on the arrow to the side of the folder called buttons tube.
5. Click and drag the tube blue button to the Stage. 
6. To test the button’s reaction when you mouse over it, go to Control > Enable Simple 
Buttons. 
7. When you ﬁnish testing, once again choose Control > Enable Simple Buttons to disable 
the button preview. 
8. Save the ﬁle as buttons.ﬂa and keep it open for the next project.

Business case
Sound is something that can take your projects to a whole new level in terms of 
dimension and experience for the user. Using music can help set the tone and “feel” 
of your piece while narration can share information and lend a personality to the 
experience as well. Learning how to control sound and how to use sound as an 
accentual element are important to using sound efectively and eiciently. 
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
workspace. See “Resetting the Flash workspace” in the Starting up section of this book.
You will work with several ﬁles from the ﬂ11lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that you have 
loaded the ﬂlessons folder onto your hard drive from http://www.wiley.com/college/sc/adobeseries. See

In this lesson, you will build an interactive slide show with background music to keep the 
listener engaged, narration to walk the user through the various slides, and sound eﬀects 
to make the navigation feel more interactive and tactile. You will complete the slide show 
by importing and placing sounds included with the lesson ﬁles. You will also explore how 
Flash lets you optimize the use of long- and short-form audio for great performance, without 
sacriﬁcing quality or presentation. To view the ﬁnished ﬁle, choose File > Open and select the

Preparing sound files for Flash
Before bringing your audio ﬁles into Flash, you need to understand some of the characteristics 
and settings for digital audio ﬁles. The more pre-production work you do on ﬁles before 
importing them into Flash, the more likely it is that you’ll get the results you want the ﬁrst 
time around. In the next few sections, you’ll explore the key properties of digital audio ﬁles 
along with some recommendations for preparing your ﬁles for import and use in your Flash 
movies.
Sample rate and bit depth
Digital audio is sound that has been converted from analog sound waves into a series of bits 
and bytes. The conversion takes place through the use of an A/D (analog-to-digital) converter. 
Your computer microphone jack contains a very basic converter; audio professionals use high-
end units capable of reproducing sound at a much higher level of quality and accuracy. The 
quality of digital audio is determined by two important factors: sample rate and bit depth. 

Lesson 11
335
Lesson 11: Adding Sound to Your Movies 
Preparing sound iles for Flash
The sample rate refers to the number of samples of an audio waveform that the converter 
digitizes in one second, and it is analogous to the resolution of a digital photo. The more 
samples (or pictures) captured in each second, the more accurately the waveform is represented. 
Although the sample rate is speciﬁed when the sound ﬁle is recorded or converted, you can 
adjust it down or up later. As with digital images, however, if the detail wasn’t in the original 
ﬁle, increasing the sample rate (or resolution) will not improve it. 
Take Note...
Always capture audio at a higher sample rate than you think you’ll need. If necessary, you 
can downsample later to a lower sample rate, which reduces audio ile size.
Bit depth
Sample rate
Figure 11-1: An audio waveform representation of sample  
rate and bit depth. 
Bit depth determines the amount of information that each sample contains; think of it as similar 
to a digital photo’s bit depth setting. The higher the bit depth of a photo, the wider the range 
of shades available to reproduce the original colors and details. In the audio world, bit depth is 
responsible for reproducing the amplitude (loudness) and dynamic range of an audio waveform. 
Low bit depth settings, such as 8 bits or less, produce poor recordings of limited quality, akin to 
a telephone answering machine (Figure 11-1). In contrast, a bit depth of 16 bits is suicient for 
reproducing the wide range of instruments and vocals found in professionally recorded music.
For reference, audio on a commercial compact disc has a sample rate of 44.1 kHz (or 44,100 
samples per second) and a bit depth of 16.
If you plan to record your own audio, pay attention to the sample rate and bit depth settings 
in your software and consider what they’ll mean to the quality of the original sound. Mid- to 
professional-level audio applications, such as Avid Pro Tools, Steinberg’s Cubase or Nuendo, 
Apple Logic, and Adobe Soundbooth all provide a range of options and tools for recording, 
importing, editing, and exporting digital audio into a variety of formats. If you’d prefer to let 
someone else do the recording, you can ind many royalty-free sound eﬀects and loops online 
in a variety of formats and quality settings.

Lesson 11
Editing your audio
Although you can perform basic editing and trimming in Flash (Figure 11-2), to conserve 
space you should edit your sound ﬁles to some degree before importing them. Large audio 
ﬁles sitting in your library can bloat your Flash document (.ﬂa ﬁle) unnecessarily. Why import 
unwanted, extra audio that you know will never be used in your movie?
If you need a basic sound-editing application, your choices range from low-cost shareware to 
full-featured professional programs. If you are creating original audio for your movie, consider 
an application that at least lets you trim, cut, copy, and paste, as well as export a variety of 
popular ﬁle formats. (You’ll learn about Flash’s built-in editing controls later in the lesson.)
Figure 11-2: Flash’s Edit window provides basic trimming,  
pan efects, and volume editing.

Lesson 11: Adding Sound to Your Movies 
Preparing sound iles for Flash
Mono or stereo
The nature of your source audio will determine whether you should stick with mono or 
stereo channels for your ﬁnal output. Single-channel mono audio is a suitable choice for a solo 
recording of narration or voice. If you are working with prerecorded music or sound eﬀects 
that pan from left to right, stereo is the best choice; with mono recording, you may lose a great 
deal of the perspective and placement (this is especially true with music). Keep in mind that 
stereo ﬁles include two channels (left and right), and will often take up twice as much storage 
space as a mono sound ﬁle at the same settings (Figure 11-3). Whether you record in mono or 
stereo, Flash has a series of built-in eﬀects, such as fades and stereo eﬀects, which you can apply 
to any sound you import.

Figure 11-3: Mono reproduces audio in a single channel, while stereo does it in

Audio file formats
Flash imports three common ﬁle formats: Windows .wav, Mac OS .aiﬀ, and .mp3. If you have 
QuickTime installed, you can also import additional audio ﬁle formats such as Avid’s Sound 
Designer II format. The .mp3 format diﬀers slightly from the others because it compresses 
audio to facilitate ﬁle exchange and streaming over the Web. In addition, .mp3 ﬁles use a 
system of Kbps (kilobits per second) to determine overall quality. The average is 128 Kbps, 
but you can encode at a much higher level if your software supports it. For the highest quality, 
keep your source .mp3 ﬁles within the 128 to 192 Kbps range.
Which ﬁle format is the right one? The answer largely depends on your operating system, as 
well as the software you use to create and export audio. No matter which ﬁle format you start 
with, Flash performs its own compression on audio included in your movies and converts all 
the audio in your ﬁnal .swf ﬁle to .mp3 format. You can set speciﬁc quality parameters in the 
Publish settings for your movie.

Placing sounds on the Timeline
To play a sound at a speciﬁc point in your movie, you place the sound on a keyframe on the 
Timeline. When the playhead reaches the frame where you placed the sound, you’ll hear it. 
To place a sound, you’ll select a keyframe and use the Sound options found in the Property 
Inspector. 
You’ll see in the following lessons how additional options in the Sound menu can loop sounds 
or create eﬀects such as fades and pans. There are a few simple rules: sounds must be placed on 
keyframes, and you can place only one sound per keyframe (on a single layer).

Use the buttons to move among the photos. You may notice that if you move too quickly, 
the narration audio clips blend into each other. You’ll ﬁx this later on in the chapter. Close 
the Flash Player.
Sync options and sound types
From the Sync menu, you can tell Flash how to handle a sound. Sync options can be used to control 
sound overlap, stop sounds, and control how sounds work along with content on the Timeline.
Event sounds must fully load before they play back, and they respond to events (such as the 
playhead reaching a certain frame, as in the previous exercise) or actions (such as a button click, as 
in the Adding sound effects to buttons section). Because you want the slide show narrations to occur 
in tandem with the user clicking the Next and Previous buttons, be sure to set them to Event 
sounds, as you did in the previous exercise. 
Stream sounds work best for long-form animation, as the audio is matched to the playback, like a 
soundtrack. Flash does everything it can to keep the sound in sync with the animation, including 
dropping frames if necessary. A continuous sound (such as a soundtrack or one continuous piece of 
dialog) that needs to sync with the Timeline from start to finish would be ideally set as a Stream 
sound.
Start plays a sound so that no other instance of that same sound file can be playing at the same 
time. This makes Start sounds a great choice if you want to prevent unwanted overlap. A Start 
sound will play all the way through to the end, and can only be stopped by an instance of the 
same sound whose Sync is set to Stop. 
Stop sounds don’t play a sound, but rather stop a specific sound. When choosing Stop for a 
selected sound, you will stop any instance of that sound that’s already playing. Stop sounds can 
only stop instances of the same sound whose Sync is set to Start.

Adding sound efects to buttons
Adding sound effects to buttons
Sounds are a great way to enhance navigation, and they can make interacting with buttons feel 
more real. You learned about button symbols in Lesson 10, “Creating Navigation Controls.” 
You know that buttons contain four frames, three of which correspond to the buttons’ 
diﬀerent visual states. The Over and Down frames of the slide show navigation buttons are the 
perfect locations to place Event sounds that will trigger on a rollover (the Over state) and click 
of the mouse (the Down state), respectively. 
Placing Event sounds on button frames
Event sounds work independently of the Timeline and must be fully loaded before they can 
play back. The best example of this is a short sound placed on a button frame. Your user can 
click a button at any time, so an Event sound will be ready to respond to that click without 
any relation to other content on the Timeline. In this exercise, you’ll place some sounds from 
your library on your Next and Previous buttons for both rollover and click actions. Both the 
Next and Previous buttons are instances of the Next_Previous_Button symbol in the library, so 
you’ll only need to edit one to add sounds to both instances.
Follow these steps to place Event sounds on button frames
Step-by-Step
1. Expand the Stage Graphics layer folder on the Timeline, and, if necessary, unlock all

In the button’s Edit mode, you will see its four frames: Up, Over, Down, and Hit. 
You’ll be placing sounds on the Over and Down frames, so that sounds will go oﬀ when a

Little audio dynamite: the Edit Envelope panel
When your sounds still need a little something extra, Flash’s Edit Envelope panel offers you many 
ways to trim, fade, and pan your audio for the best possible soundtrack. The Edit Envelope panel 
is opened using the Edit button that appears on the Property Inspector when a sound on the 
Timeline is selected. 
The Edit Envelope panel displays your sound as a waveform, or visual representation, of the 
length and volume of the sound as shown in Figure 11-18. Each channel of a sound displays its 
own waveform in the panel; a line above the waveform indicates the sound’s current volume. 
You can edit volume by adding handles to the volume envelope to move the line up or down. By 
default, the line is all the way up (full volume).

Trimming sound
Sometimes a sound contains a certain amount of silence or dead air before or after the material 
you need. Usually you want to minimize or eliminate this dead space to make playback as 
seamless as possible, especially if a sound needs to loop. Flash lets you trim sounds by adjusting 
their starting and ending points. This type of trimming can also be useful for selecting a small 
portion of a longer sound ﬁle for use. To edit a sound’s starting or ending point, you’ll ﬁrst 
need to place it on the Timeline.

the Publish process.

Controlling sounds
Introduction to Adobe Flash Professional CS6

Lesson 11
Controlling sounds
Once you’ve placed some sounds, you’ll want to make sure you take the extra step to control the 
behavior of those sounds. Flash doesn’t know when one sound should start and another should 
stop—it plays what you ask it to until the sound is done. This can result in a cacophony of sounds 
playing all at once if you don’t set things up right. Sound control should be an essential part of 
adding sound, not simply an afterthought. One example is the narration that plays as you shule 
through photos in your slide show. If a user jumps to the next (or previous) photo before the 
current narration is done, the two overlap. The best solution here is to use a bit of ActionScript to 
stop any other sounds before playing the next one.
Repeating and looping sounds
When you want a sound to repeat more than once, you can use either the Repeat or Loop 
options under the Sound portion of the Property Inspector. Looping is when an animation 
plays in succession more than one time. Experiment with both options with your newly placed 
background music:
Follow these steps to repeat a sound
Step-by-Step
1. Select frame 1 of the Background Music layer, if it’s not already selected, and locate the 
Sound options in the Property Inspector.
2. Under the Sound options, you will see the Repeat drop-down menu and text ﬁeld. This 
option allows you to specify the number of times you want your sound to play before it 
stops. By default, all sounds are set to repeat at least once.
3. Drag over the Repeat value slider, or click and type 3 (Figure 11-25), to set the number of 
repeats to 3. 
Figure 11-25: Set the number of repeats for  
your sound.
4. Preview your movie by choosing Ctrl+Enter (Windows) or Command+Return (Mac OS). 
The background loop should play three times and stop. Close the Flash Player.

Controlling sounds
Looping sounds
The Repeat option can be useful in situations where the sound needs to repeat in tandem with 
events on the Stage, or if you want to put a limit on the number of times a piece of music can 
repeat. If you are certain you want a piece of music or a sound to repeat continuously, you 
should choose the Loop option, which plays the sound repeatedly until the movie is closed 
down. This is a good choice for your background music loop, because you don’t want the 
music to stop while the visitor is enjoying the slide show. Try Loop instead of the Repeat 
option to hear the diﬀerence.
Follow these steps to loop a sound
Step-by-Step
1. Select frame 1 of the Background Music layer, if necessary, and locate the Sound options 
under the Property Inspector.
2. As shown in Figure 11-26, select Loop from the Repeat drop-down menu. 
Figure 11-26: Set the Loop option to repeat forever.
The Repeat text ﬁeld disappears, as a loop is inﬁnite and has no set number of repeats.

Introducing the SoundMixer and stopAll()
Introduced in ActionScript 3.0, the SoundMixer class controls the master sound output from 
your Flash movie, giving you global control over any and all sounds.
In this lesson, you’ll focus on the use of one of the SoundMixer’s many useful methods, 
stopAll(). This method does exactly what it says—stops all sounds in your movie—and 
serves as a quick-and-easy way to stop a sound before you begin playback of another.
In the following steps, you’ll add the code necessary to stop the current narration from playing 
before starting a new one on the next photo. To do this, you’ll add some code to your Next 
and Previous buttons to target the SoundMixer’s stopAll() method.

(Windows), Option+F9 (Mac OS), or Window > Actions. 
Take Note...
Add the function (fn) key to these shortcuts if you are on a laptop. 
 
2. Look for the comment that reads, //Moves backwards, and locate the event handler 
below it named prevPhoto (Figure 11-27).

3. Click to place your cursor at the beginning of the line that reads prevFrame(). Press 
Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to make a line of space and add the following 
script:
SoundMixer.stopAll();
As shown in Figure 11-28, the event handler should now read:
function prevPhoto(evt:Event):void {
SoundMixer.stopAll();
prevFrame();
}
Take Note...
As with all ActionScript code, this command is case-sensitive. Make sure you enter it exactly 
as shown above to avoid errors.

4. Further down in the ActionScript panel, locate the comment line that reads, 
//Moves forwards. Directly below it, you should see the nextPhoto event handler. 
Make a line of space above the line that reads, nextFrame(); and enter the following:
SoundMixer.stopAll();
As displayed in Figure 11-29, the code should now read:
function nextPhoto(evt:Event):void {
SoundMixer.stopAll();
nextFrame();
}
Figure 11-29: The inal code, as shown in the Actions panel.
5. Close your Actions panel and preview your movie by pressing Ctrl+Enter (Windows) or 
Command+Return (Mac OS). The narrations should now properly stop and start without 
blending together when you move back and forth between photos.
Take Note...
If you are more comfortable using the toolbox on the left side of the Actions panel to add code, 
you can ind the SoundMixer and its stopAll method under lash.media > SoundMixer > 
Methods > stopAll.
It’s all about the order
Ordering the ActionScript commands correctly on the mouse buttons is essential, because 
ActionScript executes sequentially from top to bottom. The sounds for each slide show photo 
are triggered when the playhead reaches their respective frames, so the current sound must stop 
before Flash advances to the next one. Had you reversed the command order in the exercise, the 
button would have moved you to the next photo, and played the new sound but immediately 
stopped it, because the SoundMixer.stopAll() function was called after the new sound began. 
Remember, although it seems that several lines of ActionScript run almost simultaneously, they 
are actually executed in order.

More sync menu controls: stop and start 
You may notice that using the Previous and Next buttons stops your background music from 
playing. This is because both buttons contain a SoundMixer.stopAll() command, which is 
designed to stop any sound playing in a Flash movie at once. In the following lessons, you’ll learn 
how to selectively stop the narration without aﬀecting the background music. 
Beyond Event and Stream, the Sync menu oﬀers two more behavior options for sounds: stop 
and start. These options allow very ﬁne control over the playback of speciﬁc sounds in your 
movie. You will use them now to ﬁne-tune and complete your slide show. ActionScript allows 
for more powerful and granular ways to control individual sounds, but those techniques are 
beyond the scope of this book.
Start sounds
Because sounds placed on a frame are triggered when the playhead reaches that frame, you run 
the risk that a sound may overlap itself at some point. Consider your background music: you 
want to ensure that a user returning to the ﬁrst frame to view the photo doesn’t retrigger the 
background loop and cause it to overlap. To avoid this, set the Sync option for the sound to 
Start. Start sounds play only one instance of themselves at a time, thus preventing overlap. A 
Start sound also plays until the end and can only be stopped by a matching Stop sound (more 
on this in a minute). By setting the background loop as a Start sound, you can make sure it will 
not be retriggered unintentionally if it’s already playing elsewhere in your movie.
Follow these steps to start a sound
Step-by-Step
1. Select frame 1 of your Background Music layer. 
2. Choose Start from the Sync drop-down menu under the Property Inspector’s Sound 
options (Figure 11-30). Leave the Loop options as they are.
Figure 11-30: Switch the background music’s  
Sync setting from Event to Start to avoid overlap.
3. Preview your movie by pressing Ctrl+Enter (Windows) or Command+Return (Mac OS), 
and return to the ﬁrst photo using the Previous button. The background music should play 
properly without overlap. Close the Flash Player to return to the Timeline.

Lesson 11
Stop sounds 
The Sync menu’s Stop option works with a single sound you specify through the Sound menu, 
stopping only that sound, if it is already playing. Stop is a great way to terminate any piece of audio 
narration without aﬀecting the background music at all. As you’ve seen with the SoundMixer.
stopAll action, it stops all sounds including your background music, which is probably not the 
intended eﬀect. Let’s put Stop sounds into practice for the slide show:
Follow these steps to stop a sound
Step-by-Step
1. Select keyframe 1 of the Actions layer, and open the Actions panel. Locate the two lines 
that read SoundMixer.stopAll();, and put a double backslash before each one to disable 
them, like Figure 11-31:
// SoundMixer.stopAll();
Close the Actions panel.
Take Note...
At the time of this writing, sounds using the start sync option would not playback when 
previewed or published in Flash Player 10. The issue has been noted and reported to Adobe, 
and future notes and workarounds will be posted on the Digital Classroom books website at 
digitalclassroombooks.com as they become available.
Figure 11-31: Disable the SoundMixer.stopAll() action on the Next and Previous button event handlers.
2. Under the Sound layers folder on the Timeline, locate the Stop Sounds layer. Select 
keyframe 2 on this layer as shown in Figure 11-32. 
3. In the Property Inspector, use the Name menu (under Sound options) to select Photo1.wav. 
Although you are on the second photo, the goal is to stop the Photo 1 narration when 
switching to this frame so that the Photo2.wav sound can play.

Lesson 11: Adding Sound to Your Movies 
More sync menu controls: stop and start 
4. With Photo1.wav selected, choose Stop from the Sync menu (Figure 11-33). Rather than 
play the Photo1.wav sound at this frame, it will stop any instances of this sound only, 
leaving other sounds unaﬀected.
Figure 11-32: Select keyframe 2 on the Stop Sounds layer. 
Figure 11-33: Set a Photo1.wav Stop sound in  
 
the Properties panel.
5. Choose Control > Test Movie to preview your movie. Move quickly from the ﬁrst photo 
to the second. The Photo 1 narration should stop and the Photo 2 narration should begin, 
without interrupting other sounds in your movie.
6. Use the same methods outlined in steps 1 to 3 to place a Stop sound on each remaining 
keyframe in the Stop Sounds layer for Photo 2.wav through Photo 5.wav. These will stop 
any animation from the previous photo from running as you move ahead.
7. Choose Control > Test Movie to preview your movie. 
Take Note...
You will notice that moving backward to previous photos, you will still experience overlap. 
There are a number of ways to alleviate this problem, but the limitations of Stop sounds may 
make this a better it for an ActionScript solution.

Sound publishing options
When you publish your movie for ﬁnal delivery to the Web, mobile, or other destination, you 
can adjust how Flash exports the audio and packages it with your movie. By default, Flash 
compresses sounds in your movie into the .mp3 format, regardless of the original ﬁle format. 
However, you can set the sound quality for both Stream and Event sounds in the Publish Settings 
dialog box at File > Publish Settings. You’ll learn more about this, as well as other techniques 
related to publishing your ﬁnal Flash movie, in Lesson 14, “Delivering Your Final Movie.”

1. Choose File > Publish Settings to open the Publish Settings dialog box as shown in 
Figure 11-35. Click on the Flash publish option on the left side of the dialog box to display 
the Flash publishing settings on the right side.
2. You will see some settings for Audio Stream and Audio Event. Click on the Audio Event 
settings to open the Sound Settings dialog box (Figure 11-34).

3. Leave or set the Bit Rate to 64 Kbps. MP3 quality is determined by bit rate. The higher 
the quality, of course, the higher the ﬁle size. Press OK to close the Sound Setting dialog 
box, then press OK again to close the Publish Settings dialog box.
Take Note...
MP3 applications such as Apple’s iTunes encode MP3 iles at a default bit rate of around 
128 Kbps.
Take Note...
Remember that, just like quality settings for bitmap images, sound quality settings have a 
direct efect on the inal ile size. Before making a inal decision, experiment with diferent 
quality settings for Audio Stream and Audio Event until you reach an acceptable quality level.

Introducing Movie Clips
Lesson 12
Business case
Symbols are at the heart of using Flash in terms of creating artwork and 
manipulating that artwork through animation and code. Movie clips are perhaps 
the most important symbols to understand as they can help you consolidate frame 
space within the main Timeline, allow you to create looped animations, combine 
and nest symbols for a multitude of reasons including eiciency, and much more. 
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
preferences. See “Resetting the Flash workspace” in the Starting up section of this book. 
You will work with several ﬁles from the ﬂ12lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that you have 
loaded the ﬂlessons folder onto your hard drive from http://www.wiley.com/college/sc/adobeseries. See 
“Loading lesson ﬁles” in the Starting up section of this book.
The project
In this lesson, you will create an animation of a common, complex machine in motion: an 
airplane taking oﬀ. Using the power of movie clips, you’ll break the airplane’s various moving 
parts into individual animations. The graphics for the propellers and landing gear are provided; 
you’ll simply put them all together while learning how to create complex yet manageable 
animations beyond the main Timeline. 
About movie clips 
Movie clip symbols have the same advantages as other symbol types: all instances of a movie 
clip remain attached to their master in the library, and you create new instances by dragging 
them to the Stage from the Library panel. Each movie clip instance can be modiﬁed with 
transformations and color eﬀects, just like a graphic. The real power that sets movie clips apart 
is that each movie clip contains its own Timeline, independent of the main Timeline. Movie 
clip animation, therefore, neither depends upon, nor needs to synchronize with, anything 
happening on the main Timeline. Each movie clip can contain its own animation, which you 
can place on the main Timeline whenever and wherever you need it. 

Creating movie clips
Introduction to Adobe Flash Professional CS6
366
Lesson 12
The lesson’s airplane is a good analogy: it’s a complex machine made of a lot of separate parts 
and smaller machines. Although the landing gear, turbines, and wing ﬂaps make up the whole 
machine, each component has a diﬀerent motion, rate, and function. Trying to build a plane 
out of one component would be impossible. Similarly, some complex animations can’t be built 
on one timeline alone; they require the ﬂexibility of separate parts. Each part needs to move at 
its own pace along its own Timeline. Movie clips allow you to break animations into separate 
manageable and reusable pieces.
Think about the airplane again: some smaller machines (like the engine) are built from a lot of 
smaller moving parts, but still need to be treated as one whole piece. Movie clips can contain 
other movie clips, so you can build a single movie clip from several others. They can also 
contain any number of graphic or button symbols.
Creating movie clips
As with graphic and button symbols, you create movie clips by choosing Insert > New 
Symbol, or by converting existing graphics or animations on the Stage by choosing Modify > 
Convert to Symbol. You’ll get plenty of practice with this in the next exercise. 
Laying the foundation: Your first movie clip
To begin your airplane animation, you’ll build a propeller to power your plane. 
Follow these steps to create a movie clip
Step-by-Step
1. Choose File > Open and navigate to the ﬂ12lessons folder. Select the ﬂ1201.ﬂa ﬁle and 
press Open. 
2. Choose File > Save As. When the Save As dialog box appears, type ﬂ1201_work.ﬂa into 
the Save As text ﬁeld. Navigate to the ﬂ12lessons folder and press Save.
3. Open the Library panel by choosing Window > Library, if it is not already open. Locate 
the Propeller graphic symbol displayed in Figure 12-1. This propeller blade is the 
foundation for an entire propeller assembly that you’ll save as a movie clip symbol.

7. To add a motion tween to the propeller, right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) on 
the propeller instance on the Stage and choose Create Motion Tween from the contextual 
menu. 
8. By default, Flash creates a tween span that is equivalent to one second of play time. The 
start ﬁle was set to 30 fps, so the tween span in this case is 30 frames. Click and drag the 
end of the tween span to reduce it to 20 frames as shown in Figure 12-3.

airplane should now be in full force with all parts moving.
6. Close the preview window, and choose File > Save to save your work.
Nesting movie clips
When creating complex animations, you can simplify your main Timeline by leveraging a 
movie clip’s ability to nest, or to include movie clips inside other movie clips. In other words, 
you can create one single movie clip from several others. (Remember the engine analogy?) 
This gives you amazing ﬂexibility, and the ability to drag and drop very complex animations 
to the Timeline as eﬀortlessly as simple graphic or button symbols. Of course, you can modify 
and maintain movie clips as easily as other symbols by updating multiple instances of a 
complex movie clip from its master symbol in the library.
In this exercise, you’ll convert the airplane and all its moving parts into a single movie clip 
symbol that you can tween, modify, or duplicate just as easily as any other symbol in your 
library. Movie clips can be created from existing movie clips, animations, or graphics on the 
Stage, using Modify > Convert to Symbol.

Figure 12-17: Name the new movie clip Full Airplane.
Notice that the group of parts appears on the Stage inside a single bounding box. You can 
now click and drag the movie clips around the Stage as one unit. Keep in mind, though, 
that the original movie clips must remain in the library (Figure 12-18), as the new movie 
clip depends on them.
Figure 12-18: The new movie clip is created,  
and its individual components remain in the library.
3. Choose File > Publish Preview > Flash to view your movie in the Flash Player. It should 
play just as it did before.
As the exercise demonstrates, movie clips can contain not only other movie clips, but also 
graphics (such as the airplane body) and button symbols. This means that you can create 
entire animations inside movie clips without having to do anything on the Timeline.

Movie clip facts, myths, and legends
Now that you’re pretty deep into movie clips, it’s time to review some rules, dispel some myths 
about how movie clips work, and pass on some important facts you need to know.
Dependencies: When you nest one symbol (movie clip, button, or graphic) inside of another, 
you create dependencies. In other words, the highest-level symbol (for example, Full Airplane) 
depends on the symbols it contains (Airplane Body, Propeller Animation, and Landing Gear, in 
this case) residing separately in the library. Placing other symbols inside a movie clip doesn’t copy 
them, but rather references them. If you remove any lower-level symbol from the library, it will 
disappear from the larger symbol. If, for instance, you remove Landing Gear from the library, Full 
Airplane will no longer be able to find it, and the landing gear component will disappear from the 
grouped movie clip.
Frame Rate: Although movie clip timelines are independent of the main Timeline, they can’t 
use a different frame rate. Frame Rate settings are global to a Flash movie (.swf), and can’t be 
modified from movie clip to movie clip. Changing the frame rate for one affects the entire movie.
Timeline Length: Because a movie clip works from its own timeline, its length is independent 
from the main Timeline’s length or available space. You can place a 200-frame movie clip on 
the main Timeline, even if there’s no more than one frame there. The movie clip will still play 
as it should. Many movies are built using the main Timeline as nothing more than a container 
for movie clips, and the main Timeline sometimes contains no more than the first frame of each 
movie clip.
Timelines: Movie clip timelines work just as the main Timeline does. Anything you can do on 
the main Timeline, from tweens and layers to ActionScript, you can use on a movie clip timeline. 
Here’s a little-known fact: the main Timeline is a movie clip in itself.
ActionScript: ActionScript on a movie clip timeline has no effect on the main Timeline or 
Timelines of other movie clips (even included ones), and vice versa. ActionScript on a timeline, 
such as a stop or play action, affects only that timeline. This means you can use ActionScript 
across multiple timelines without a problem.

Adding ActionScript to movie clip Timelines
Introduction to Adobe Flash Professional CS6

Lesson 12
Adding ActionScript to movie clip Timelines
When you preview your movie, you may notice that a few elements need some adjustment. 
The landing gear, for example, retracts but then shoots back out again (and again, and again) 
because nothing is directing the landing gear to stop when it has fully retracted. The nature of 
movie clips is to loop until told otherwise. The default behavior of the Flash Player is to make 
a movie loop. To override these two behaviors, you’ll use a little bit of the ActionScript that 
you learned in Lesson 9, “Introducing ActionScript.”
Controlling movie clip playback
Because movie clip Timelines function just like the main Timeline, placing ActionScript on 
a movie clip Timeline is exactly the same as placing it on the main Timeline. Prove this to 
yourself by modifying the Landing Gear symbol so that it doesn’t loop.
Follow these steps to control movie clip playback
Step-by-Step
1. In the Library panel, locate the Landing Gear movie clip symbol and double-click it to 
edit it. You should be in its Edit mode and see the tween you created earlier in the chapter.
2. Make sure you are viewing the Timeline by choosing Window > Timeline, then press the 
New Layer button ( ) to create a new layer, and rename it actions. 
Take Note...
Although it’s not required, separating ActionScript from frames that have content is a good 
practice.
3. On the actions layer, click on the last frame (frame 30), and press F7 to create a new blank 
keyframe as shown in Figure 12-19. 
Figure 12-19: Create a new layer and blank keyframe for the ActionScript. 
4. Choose Window > Actions or press F9 (Windows) or Option+F9 (Mac OS) to launch the 
Actions panel.

Actions panel as shown in Figure 12-20.
Figure 12-20: Add a stop() action to frame 30. 
A lowercase letter a on the frame indicates that the frame now contains a script.
6. Close the Actions panel, then exit the movie clip by clicking the Scene 1 link above the 
Stage to return to the main Timeline.
7. Preview your movie, using File > Publish Preview > Flash. The landing gear should now 
retract and stay put without looping.
8. Close the preview window, and choose File > Save to save your work.
Adding some variation to the propellers
To make your animation a little more dynamic, you can add two stages of speed to your 
propeller’s rotation. All you need is some additional animation and a little ActionScript. At the 
moment, the propeller has a single tween that keeps it rotating. Simply add another rotation 
tween with a higher rate of speed right after the existing one to give the viewer the impression 
that the propellers pick up speed. To keep them from slowing down and speeding up repeatedly, 
you’ll add ActionScript to animate it over a selected number of frames.
Follow these steps to modify an animation
Step-by-Step
1. Locate the Propeller Animation movie clip in the Library panel, and double-click it to edit 
it (Figure 12-21). You should see that the Timeline for this movie clip contains a single 
tween.

Lesson 12: Introducing Movie Clips

7. In the Actions panel, type gotoAndPlay(21); as shown in Figure 12-25.. This method of 
the Movie Clip class instructs the playhead to jump to a frame or frame label and play. In 
this case, when the playhead reaches frame 40, it will jump to frame 21 and play. This will 
result in frames 1 to 20 playing once, and frames 21 to 40 playing indeﬁnitely.
Figure 12-25: Add gotoAndPlay(21) to frame 40 of the Actions layer.
The loop starts later in the Timeline because you want the speed increase to occur only 
once and then have the propeller maintain a consistent speed as it loops. After the propeller 
picks up speed through the two tweens, the animation will loop continuously from frame 
21, so the speed stays fast as the loop continues.
8. Close the Actions panel and select the Scene 1 link above the Stage. Preview your movie 
by choosing File > Publish Preview > Flash. The plane’s propellers should appear to 
speed up and then rotate at a continuous rate. Because both propellers were instances of 
the same symbol, both automatically reﬂect the changes you made to the master symbol’s 
animation.

Lesson 12
Tweening movie clips
To make your movie clips glide, transform, or change their color tint, you can apply motion 
tweens to them just as you would to other symbols. Creating a tween with a movie clip is 
exactly the same as for graphic symbols, and several movie clips can be tweened at the same 
time on separate layers.
You’ve already used a few tweens, and, in this exercise, you’ll practice using motion tweens to 
make your airplane take oﬀ. Before you start, make sure the Property Inspector is visible.
To tween your airplane and create a take-oﬀ sequence:
Follow these steps to add a motion tween to a movie clip
Step-by-Step
1. Select the entire airplane on the Stage (instance of Airplane Full). Use the Property 
Inspector to set its position to X: 280, Y: 275. To keep proportions constrained, click the 
Lock width and height values together button and set the width of the airplane to 300 as shown 
in Figure 12-26. It should now be slightly smaller and sit on the bottom center of the Stage.

down to the Eases section. Type -100 in the ﬁeld to the right of Simple (Slow). Scroll up 
to the Y property in the Basic motion section and, if necessary, select Simple (Slow) from 
the Ease drop-down menu as shown in Figure 12-28.

Lesson 12
3. Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional. The airplane takes oﬀ and appears to 
ﬂy toward the camera. This eﬀect may be a bit startling, so hold on to your seat.
As you’ve seen in these steps, tweening a movie clip instance is very much the same as 
working with a graphic symbol; so transformations, color eﬀects, and motion can all 
be applied. Because movie clips can contain entire animations, however, you can fully 
explore more complex and dynamic animations.
Combining movie clips for complex animation
To make a movie as realistic and dynamic as possible, you can combine as many movie clips 
on the main Timeline as you need to achieve the full eﬀect. Because each movie clip is an 
independent animation of its own, multiple movie clips interacting on the Timeline do not 
interfere with each other. Keep in mind, however, that you may need to carefully orchestrate and 
sequence animation in diﬀerent movie clips if one needs to interact with another.
Now that you have your airplane up-and-running, to make the scene more realistic, you’ll 
add two things: a runway and some clouds. Both these graphics will have their own motion, 
especially as your plane moves oﬀ the runway and through the clouds. The movie clips for 
both of these have already been created for you in the library; all you’ll need to do is place 
them on the main Timeline.
Follow these steps to combine movie clips
Step-by-Step
1. Rename Layer 1 airplane. Click on the New Layer button to create a new layer above this 
one and name it clouds (Figure 12-30).

Adding ilter efects to movie clips
Introduction to Adobe Flash Professional CS6
384
Lesson 12
Exercise
To test your new skills, explore both the provided movie clips in Edit mode to see how they 
were created. Try making modiﬁcations to them and see how your overall movie is aﬀected. 
Because these movie clips were built to work together, major changes in length or animation 
style may require you to also adjust the other movie clips on the Stage.
Adding filter effects to movie clips
Movie clips have another advantage: they (and buttons) are the only symbol types to which 
you can apply Flash’s built-in, high-quality ﬁlter eﬀects, including blurs, drop shadows, and 
bevels. A blur is a simple ﬁlter eﬀect in Flash that softens the appearance of an object. Because 
the ﬁlter eﬀects are nondestructive, they won’t permanently alter the pixel data in a symbol, 
meaning that you can easily remove or edit ﬁlters, as well as apply unique ﬁlters to several 
instances of a movie clip.
Probably one of the coolest features to note is that Flash ﬁlters can be tweened, just like any 
other instance-speciﬁc property. For example, you can gradually apply a blur to a symbol to 
create realistic and artistic eﬀects. 
Take Note...
Some CS6 applications (most notably Adobe Photoshop) feature a variety of ilter efects. If 
you’re creating graphics in one of these applications, you may choose to apply ilters then, or 
directly in the Flash environment after import. Because Flash natively supports importing 
Photoshop and Illustrator iles, it converts most common ilter types to Flash ilters. The 
advantage of applying ilters in Flash is that they can be easily edited without the need to 
switch applications and re-import updated iles. In addition, you can manipulate Flash ilters 
with ActionScript, which opens a world of dynamic iltering possibilities.

4. Select Medium from the Quality drop-down menu. This is a good choice for making sure 
the eﬀect looks clean without putting too much strain on the Flash Player (as ﬁlter eﬀects 
are resource-intensive).

Lesson 12
Creating a filter effect
Filtering an entire movie clip instance is a few clicks away using the Filters panel, but you 
can go a step further by combining tweens and ﬁlters to transition into a ﬁlter eﬀect. Filters 
are several types of eﬀects that can be applied to objects in Flash. Try this with your Runway 
movie clip by blurring the runway as the plane takes oﬀ, and climbs above the ground.
Follow these steps to apply a ﬁlter efect to a movie clip
Step-by-Step
1. Double-click the Runway movie clip on the Stage to edit it in place. You should see a 
basic motion tween that moves the runway down. The tween was created between two 
instances of a movie clip called Runway Graphics. (Graphics symbols cannot be used 
because you can apply ﬁlter eﬀects only to movie clips or buttons.) Move the playhead on 
the Timeline to frame 30 and select the instance of the Runway Graphics movie clip on 
the Stage as shown in Figure 12-34.
Figure 12-34: The Runway movie clip at frame 30 in Edit mode.
Take Note...
You can apply ilter efects only to movie clips, buttons, and dynamic text ields. If you want 
to apply a ilter to a basic graphic, graphic symbol, or drawing object, you must convert it to a 
movie clip or button symbol irst.
2. Click the Add ﬁlter button ( ) at the bottom-left corner in the Filters section of the 
Property Inspector, and choose Blur from the resulting contextual menu.

3. Set the Blur X and Y values to 15, and select Medium from the Quality drop-down menu 
as shown in Figure 12-35. Changing the Blur X and Y values to 15 from the default of 5 
will automatically create an animation between frames 1 and 30. The eﬀect will be applied 
for the entire tween span, but it will transition from the default value to the new value. 
Figure 12-35: Add a blur to the runway, and  
then adjust the Blur X and Y values on frame 30

4. To make the transition a bit more pronounced, drag the playhead back to frame 1, select 
the runway, and change the Blur X and Y values shown in the Property Inspector to 0.
5. Press Ctrl+Enter (Windows) or Command+Return (Mac OS) to preview your movie. 
6. If you like, return to the main Timeline and keep your airplane at cruising altitude by adding 
a stop() action on frame 60. Remember to insert a new layer for the stop() action and 
create a new keyframe at frame 60 before adding the action, to ensure it occurs in the right 
place. The provided runway and clouds already utilize a stop() action (Figure 12-36).

Wrapping up
Movie clips open a treasure trove of possibilities, and the best way to master movie clips is to 
use them—the more you do, the more ways you’ll ﬁnd to create innovative, complex, and 
eye-catching animations that far exceed what’s possible on a single Timeline. To get ideas for 
your next movie clip, explore ready-made clips, such as the Runway and Clouds movie clips 
in your library, to understand how they were created. Don’t hesitate to modify the movie clips 
in this exercise by adding keyframes, experimenting with more ﬁlter eﬀects, or adding some 
additional graphics of your own.

True/False
Circle T if the statement is true or F if the statement is false.
1. What sets movie clips apart is that each movie clip contains its own timeline, 
independent of the main Timeline.
2. By default, Flash creates a new tween span to one second of play time. The 
length of the span will also be dictated by the frame rate.
3. Movie clips cannot be dropped into other movie clips, they must be 
collectively assembled on the Stage.
4. Although movie clip timelines are independent of the main Timeline, they 
can’t use a diﬀerent frame rate than the main Timeline.
5. Because a movie clip works from its own timeline, its length is independent 
from the main Timeline’s length. 
6. The ActionScript on a movie clip Timeline always has an impact on the main 
Timeline, so you have to plan accordingly.
7. Only classic tweens can be applied to movie clips, they do not animate like 
other symbols do.
8. An advantage of applying ﬁlters in Flash is that they can be easily edited 
without the need to switch applications.
9. There is no way to apply a ﬁlter to a drawing object without converting to a 
symbol ﬁrst.
10. Filters cannot be animated.

Video in Flash: formats and fundamentals
The ﬁrst step toward importing video into Flash is to make sure you are equipped and ready. 
In addition to Flash CS6, you’ll need the QuickTime player (at least version 7 for Windows or 
version 10 for Mac OS) installed on your system. You’ll also need a source video ﬁle to import 
and convert (video is provided for the exercises in this lesson).
Understanding video
Like animations on the Timeline, videos are composed of a series of sequential still images 
played back very rapidly, sometimes with sound, and sometimes without. When played back 
very quickly, these images seem to form continuous motion. You need to keep two parameters 
in mind when working with video: frame rate, which is the speed, measured in frames per 
second (fps) at which the video plays, and frame size, which is the size, measured in pixels, of 
each frame of video. Both the frame rate and size contribute to the ﬁnal ﬁle size.

Lesson 13: Working with Video
Understanding video
Embedded versus linked video
There are two ways to work with video in a Flash (SWF) ﬁle: you can embed the video 
directly onto the Timeline, or have your movie reference an external, linked video ﬁle that 
resides on a server. 
External video ﬁles can be streamed from a Flash Media Streaming Service, a Flash Media 
Server, a server solution optimized to deliver streaming or real-time media, or downloaded 
progressively from any standard web server, including the same one on which your Flash 
movie is hosted. Using external video keeps the SWF ﬁle size fairly small, and because the 
video ﬁle exists as an external video ﬁle on a server, the SWF container can be repurposed to 
dynamically display multiple video sources. In addition, because the FLV ﬁle exists outside the 
Flash movie, it can have a diﬀerent frame rate from the SWF; this avoids messy issues where 
video and audio end up out of sync, which is common when working with embedded video 
ﬁles. For a comparison of the beneﬁts of streaming versus progressively downloading, see the 
section, “Working with linked video.” 
Embedded video is placed directly on the Flash Timeline. This can signiﬁcantly increase the 
SWF ﬁle size—potentially to unmanageable levels with longer clips. Additionally, because the 
video ﬁle and the Flash document can have two diﬀerent frame rates, audio and video may 
end up out of sync when the movie is published. For this reason, embedded video is usually 
recommended only for short video clips, and even then usually only for short video clips 
without audio. 
Another major diﬀerence between embedded and linked video is the way in which they 
are deployed for distribution. Because embedded video is a part of the SWF Timeline, 
it is automatically included when you publish the ﬁle. Linked video, however, exists 
independently and must be uploaded to the server in addition to your SWF and any other 
dependent ﬁles. In general, the goal of using linked video ﬁles is to create modular content 
than can be repurposed more easily than embedded video can, and to reduce the initial loading 
time of your SWF. In general, you should not import video into a Flash document when the 
publish target is HTML.
Flash Video formats: FLV and F4V
All video in Flash must be converted into the Flash Video format (FLV or F4V) or H.264 
formats for playback in the Flash Player. This conversion can be performed as part of the 
process of importing video into a Flash document using the built-in Video Import wizard, 
or it can be completed before the import stage by using the Adobe Media Encoder or a video 
editing application such as Adobe Premiere Pro that can export Flash video. 
There are two extensions used for Flash video ﬁles. The FLV format is supported by Flash 
Player version 7 and higher, while the newer F4V format is supported by Flash Player versions 
9.2 and higher. The F4V format is intended to provide higher playback quality at lower ﬁles 
sizes than FLV can provide. The Flash Player version that you want to target will determine 
how you format your video. If you are publishing for the latest version of Flash Player (or even 
versions 9 or up), it’s recommended that you convert video to F4V.

Lesson 13
Understanding codecs
Codecs are software routines that compress video ﬁles small enough to be e-mailed, or 
viewed on the Web or mobile devices.
The video creator uses a codec to compress the video ﬁle for distribution; the ﬁles are then 
decoded by the viewer’s video player using the same codec. Flash video (F4V speciﬁcally) 
supports three codec choices: Sorenson Spark, On2 VP6 (usually called ON2V), and H.264. 
The Sorenson Spark codec is supported by ﬁles encoded in the FLV format for playback in Flash 
Player 7 and later. The On2 VP6 codec is the default setting for videos encoded for versions 
8 and 9 of the Flash Player because it provides higher video quality than the older Sorenson 
Spark codec. MainConcept H.264 is supported by Flash Player versions 9.2 and later. The 
newer codecs provide better video playback quality at lower ﬁle sizes than the older ones do. 
This higher-quality video comes at the price of a slower encoding time and more use of system 
resources (such as RAM and connection speed) on the viewer’s computer at playback time.
Understanding Adobe Media Encoder CS6
The Adobe Media Encoder is a stand-alone application that is installed when you install the 
Flash application. The encoder exists to convert video and audio media from one format to 
another. While often thought of as a tool for converting video into the Flash Video format, 
it can actually convert video into a wide range of formats, such as IPod video and video for 
sharing sites such as Vimeo and YouTube. 
The Adobe Media Encoder can import video and audio in a wide variety of ﬁle formats. Some 
of the more common importable video formats are listed below:
• 3GPP/3GPP2 (.3gp, .3gpp)
• Digital Video (.dv)
• DV stream
• Flash Video (.ﬂv, .f4v)
• QuickTime (.mov)
• MPEG (.mpg, .mpeg, .m2v)
• Windows (.avi)
• Windows Media (.asf, .wmv)
Take Note...
The QuickTime player is available as a free download from apple.com, and is packaged 
with all versions of Mac OS X.

Lesson 13

Lesson 13: Working with Video
Understanding video
The Adobe Media Encoder is divided into 4 main areas: the Queue, Encoding, Preset Browser 
and Watch Folders panes (Figure 13-2). The Queue is a list of the ﬁles you are going to 
convert, and the settings for each. From the Queue, you can choose the type of video you 
would like to output to, and the speciﬁc preset you would like to use for it.

When the built-in presets aren’t suitable for your project, you can open the encoder’s Export

control over things such as output size, video and audio compression, and even the ability to 
upload directly to a web server. In addition to the output of your video ﬁle, the dialog box 
can be used to set cue points for Flash video and even perform basic editing by trimming the 
beginning or ending of a video ﬁle.

Lesson 13
Converting video with the Adobe Media Encoder
The ﬁrst phase is to prepare the video ﬁle that you will import into the Flash project using 
the Adobe Media Encoder. Technically, the Adobe Media Encoder isn’t a part of Flash; it is 
a stand-alone video converter that can take video in one format and convert it to another. In 
addition to Flash video, the Adobe Media Encoder can also create ﬁles for display on mobile 
devices such as cell phones, iPods, and others. In the following exercise, you will import and 
convert a video ﬁle using the Adobe Media Encoder.
Follow these steps to convert video using the Adobe Media Encoder
Step-by-Step
1. Open the Adobe Media Encoder by choosing Adobe Media Encoder CS6 from the Start 
Menu (Windows) or Applications > Adobe Media Encoder CS6 (Mac OS).
2. In the Adobe Media Encoder, press the Add Source button. In the Open dialog box, 
navigate to the ﬂ13lessons folder and select the ﬂ1301.mov ﬁle. Press Open to load the 
video ﬁle into the Adobe Media Encoder.
Take Note...
You can also drag and drop iles into the Adobe Media Encoder window from the Mac OS X 
Finder and Windows Explorer.
3. There are three editable ﬁelds for every ﬁle:
• Format: Either Flash Video (.ﬂv or .f4v), h.264 or mp3. The h.264 format is used when 
creating video for mobile devices, and video sharing sites like YouTube.
• Preset: Once the format is chosen, AME allows you to select from a wide range of 
preset options for encoding the video. 
• Output ﬁle: Speciﬁes the location and name of the new ﬁle that will be created.
For Format, make sure that the drop-down menu displays FLV or F4V. For Preset, press 
the triangle button to open the menu and choose Match Source Attributes (Medium 
Quality). The Output ﬁle’s location will automatically be set to match the location of the 
source video ﬁle. 
Take Note...
As stated previously, if the F4V format is designed to provide better quality video, why are you 
using FLV-formatted video here? The reason is that for the irst part of this exercise you will 
embed video directly into a Flash ile. This procedure can only be done when using an FLV 
format.
4. Press the Start Queue button and the Encoder will convert your video.
5. Once the video has completed converting, close the Adobe Media Encoder by choosing 
File > Exit (Windows) or Adobe Media Encoder CS6 > Quit Adobe Media Encoder CS6.

Working with embedded video 
Working with embedded video 
Embedding video is the most straightforward method of adding video content to your movies. 
However, because it can enlarge the size of your SWF ﬁle and create issues where your audio 
and video are out of sync, it is best suited for adding short video clips. On certain projects, 
embedded video may be the only viable way to work with video in Flash. Often, when 
creating Flash banners or other advertising material, you have to deliver completely stand-
alone SWF ﬁles without external links. Embedded video is also a very good way to create 
interaction or integration between video and Timeline animated assets, or to create a quick 
closed-captioning eﬀect.
Adding embedded video to the Timeline
Once video has been converted to the Flash Video format, it is ready for use in Flash either as 
linked video that runs from a location outside your Flash movie (.swf), or embedded video that 
is placed directly into it. Once you have embedded the video ﬁle, the SWF that you create will 
be ready for deployment just like any other Flash movie. All you need to do is place it in a web 
page, and it will be ready to be viewed on the Web.
Follow these steps to add embedded video to the Timeline
Step-by-Step
1. Open Flash CS6. Choose File > Open, navigate to the ﬂ13lessons folder, and select the 
Flash ﬁle ﬂ1302.ﬂa. Press Open. This ﬁle is a mockup for a banner advertisement.
2. In the Timeline, select the ﬁrst frame of the Video Here layer, and then choose File > 
Import > Import Video.
3. In the Import Video dialog box, under the section labeled Where is your video ile? make 
sure the radio button labeled On your computer is selected. Press the Browse button and 
from the ﬂ13lessons folder, select the ﬂ1301.ﬂv ﬁle created in the previous exercise and 
press Open. Select the radio button labeled Embed FLV in SWF and play in timeline as 
shown in Figure 13-4.

6. Use the Selection tool ( ) to position the video ﬁle so its left edge lines up against the 
second vertical guide to the right of the logo area, and it’s vertically centered on the 
Stage (Figure 13-6). Lock the Mask and Video layers by clicking them below the padlock 
column in the Timeline panel. This fully activates the mask layer, and you should see only 
a portion of the new video revealed.

Lesson 13
Building controls for embedded video
It is the standard behavior of the Flash Player to loop SWF ﬁles, but this may not be the eﬀect 
you want. To prevent this continuous looping, you will use ActionScript 3.0 to control the 
Timeline and, in turn, the playback of the video. In this exercise, you will import and embed a 
short video ﬁle into a prepared Flash document and use the new Code Snippets panel to create 
functional Play, Pause, and Stop buttons to control it. The Code Snippets panel is a convenient 
and eicient way to program timeline navigation, actions, animation, audio/video control, 
event handling, and loading/unloading assets. The ile you will be using for this section is a 
mock-up of a presentation about Abraham Lincoln and the Lincoln Memorial.
The Timeline of the ile lasts for 915 frames. It has an embedded video ile, a generic Play and 
Stop button, and an empty Actions layer where you will place your ActionScript. In order to 
create a button that will control the Timeline, you will have to deine three things:
• Which object on the Stage do you want to control the Timeline playback? For this exercise, 
you will build two actions, one to play the movie and the other to stop its playback.
• When do you want it to happen? This is called an Event. In this case, you will have the 
buttons activate when a user clicks and releases the mouse on them.
• What do you want it to do? This is a special type of function called an Event handler. The 
Code Snippets panel will help you create event handlers that play and stop the movie’s 
Timeline. 
Follow these steps to build controls for embedded video
Step-by-Step
1. In Flash CS6, choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the ﬂ13lessons 
folder and select the ﬂ1303.ﬂa Flash ﬁle.

Working with linked video
Introduction to Adobe Flash Professional CS6
406
Lesson 13
Working with linked video
If your video ﬁle is too large to embed into the SWF ﬁle, you should consider importing it as 
external video. External video remains separate from the SWF ﬁle that plays it, keeping the 
initial loading times for the SWF ﬁle fairly small. Linked deployment gives you the choice 
of three approaches: Web server, Flash Media Server, or Flash Video Streaming Service. 
Web server deployment enables you to use your current web server or hosting service plan 
to progressively download video into your Flash movie, using standard Hyper Text Transfer 
Protocols (HTTP). This allows users to begin watching a portion of your video while the rest 
of the ﬁle continues to load in the background.
Although progressively downloading a video clip from a web server doesn’t provide the same 
real-time performance as using a Streaming Server, this approach requires minimal overhead 
and works easily with the same server that currently hosts your website. 
Video in the fast lane: Flash Media Server
For the fastest video delivery, consider deploying your video content to a Flash Media Server or 
Flash Video Streaming Service (FVSS). 
The stream from a Flash Video Streaming Service for your Deployment option (available from 
the Deployment Options screen on the Video Import wizard) enables you to upload your video 
to a Flash Media Server and stream it directly into your Flash movie. Beyond just hosting, these 
servers also provide many other advanced features for adjusting bandwidth and quality and 
delivering high performance for large volume usage. 
Such providers are often called CDNs (content delivery networks). The Video Import wizard’s 
Deployment Options screen also displays a hyperlink to the Adobe website, adobe.com, where 
you can find a licensed FVSS. Choosing Stream from Flash Media Server on the Deployment 
Options screen allows you to stream your Flash video from a Flash Media Server that you host, 
and provides a hyperlink that takes you to the Adobe website to learn more about the Flash Media 
Server and how to license it. 
For both linked approaches, you can use an FLVPlayback component with built-in navigation 
or ActionScript to control video playback and provide intuitive controls for user interaction.
To explore the linked video approach, you’ll build a video player to display a short clip 
showcasing two presidential monuments in Washington, D.C. Because it is the most easily 
accessible method, this exercise focuses on progressive downloads from a web server.
Adding cue points in the Adobe Media Encoder
One of the beneﬁts of using linked video is the ability to create navigational cue points and use 
skins to customize the appearance of the video player. Cue points are added when the Flash ﬁle 
is created in the Adobe Media Encoder, or within the Property Inspector in Flash CS6 (shown 
in a later exercise). 
Cue points can be thought of as bookmarks, or chapter markers within a video. You can 
navigate through them using the seek buttons on the default Flash Video skins, or using your 
own mechanism created in ActionScript. A skin is a video interface added to a video ﬁle that 
often provides useful controls such as play, pause, stop, and the ability to scrub through the video.

Follow these steps to add cue points using the Adobe Media Encoder
Step-by-Step
1. Open the Adobe Media Encoder by choosing Adobe > Adobe Media Encoder CS6 from 
the Start menu (Windows) or Applications > Adobe Media Encoder CS6 (Mac OS). You 
may see videos that you’re previously encoded (if any) appear here. If you want to clear out 
the display, you can highlight an entry and click Remove. It doesn’t remove the ﬁles from 
your hard drive; it merely removes the reference to the ﬁle in the encoder. 
2. Press the Add Source button on the left side of the workspace. In the Open dialog box, 
navigate to the ﬂ13lessons folder and select the ﬂ1305.mov ﬁle. Press Open to load the ﬁle 
into the encoder.
3. Under Format, make sure that the drop-down menu displays FLV or F4V.

6. Cue points are added in the area below the Source/Output monitors. The horizontal 
orange bar beneath the Source and Output monitors allows you to preview your video 
and add cue points. Slide the orange handle, called the Current Time Indicator, at the 
top of the bar until the time above it reads around 5 seconds (00;00;05;00) as shown in 
Figure 13-13. To get an even 5 seconds, you can click on the timecode and edit it by hand, 
or use the left/right arrow keys to move one frame at a time. This will move the playhead 
to 5 seconds, from the beginning of the video.

the conversion process. After the ﬁle ﬁnishes converting, close the Adobe Media Encoder 
by choosing File > Exit (Windows) or Adobe Media Encoder > Quit Adobe Media 
Encoder (Mac OS).
Take Note...
Video rendering is a very processor-intensive activity that can take quite a long time. The video 
included in this lesson could take anywhere from two to ive minutes to complete the process. 
The longer a video ile is, the longer the conversion process will take. For your convenience, 
all the video that you use in this lesson is included as pre-rendered Flash video iles in the 
l13lessons folder.
Adding linked video to the Timeline
Once the video ﬁle is converted by the Adobe Media Encoder, the process for adding the ﬁle to 
the Flash Timeline is remarkably similar to the one used previously for embedding video.
Live Preview
Live Preview is a subtle but useful feature is the ability to preview linked video directly on the 
Stage within the Flash Professional CS6 environment. Previous versions of Flash required you 
to Test or Publish a movie ﬁrst; now you simply use the included controls of the FLVPlayback 
component to play, rewind, and seek through your movie as you would in a published movie.
Follow these steps to preview linked video on the Stage
Step-by-Step
1. In Flash CS6, choose File > Open, and open the ﬂ1306.ﬂa ﬁle located in the ﬂ13lessons 
folder. This contains a pre-created layout for your new video preview page.
2. Choose File > Save As. When the Save As dialog box appears, type ﬂ1306_work.ﬂa into 
the Name text ﬁeld. Navigate to the ﬂ13lessons folder and press Save.
3. Choose File > Import > Import Video to open the Video Import dialog box.
4. In the Select Video section of the Import Video dialog box, press the Browse button, 
navigate to the ﬂ13lessons folder, and select ﬂ1305.f4v. Press the Open button to return 
to the wizard. Make sure the radio button labeled Load external video with playback 
component is selected as shown in Figure 13-16. This option controls the download 
method of the video.

Adding Cue Points in the Property Inspector
To make working with linked video easier, you can view and modify cue points directly 
within the Property Inspector in the Flash Professional CS6 environment. This eliminates 
the need to navigate through a series of complex dialog boxes. All the cue points of a selected 
video appear in a dedicated panel within the Property Inspector, and you can continue to edit 
and modify them as needed.
Follow these steps to add cue points using the Property Inspector
Step-by-Step
1. Using the Selection tool ( ), select the FLVPlayback component on the Stage. 
2. On the Property Inspector, locate the Cue Points panel, and expand it by clicking the 
arrow next to Cue Points. You should now be able to see a listing of all cue points that 
already have been created in this video during the import process.
3. Press the Play button on the FLVPlayback component on the Stage to begin previewing 
the video. Allow the video to play for about 10 seconds, and the pause it. This is the spot 
where you’ll create a new cue point.
4. On the Cue Points panel on the Property Inspector, click the Add ActionScript Cue Point 
button ( ) above the cue point listing. This adds a new cue point entry in the list.

Working with the FLVPlayback component 
The FLVPlayback component is a special Flash object used to control the playback of linked 
video in a Flash movie, and to provide the user with an intuitive set of controls for interacting 
with your video. For the most part, you can work with components in the same way you 
would with movie clips. However, components are far more complex, and you can edit several 
more parameters from the Property Inspector to control their behavior. In this exercise, you’ll 
use the FLVPlayback component and its included controls for your movie’s linked video.
Follow these steps to use the FLVPlayback component
Step-by-Step
1. Using the Selection tool ( ), select the FLVPlayback component on the Stage. 
2. Locate and expand the Component Parameters area within the Property Inspector to view 
the properties for this FLVPlayback component (Figure 13-19).

the Flash Player.
Take Note...
You may notice a slight delay between the time that the Flash movie loads and the 
appearance of the video. This is normal and varies by the speed of a user’s Internet 
connection. Some developers place an image or text on the layer below the FLVPlayback 
Component to entertain the viewer while the video loads.

More about the Media Encoder — Part 1: Getting to know the presets
Project 13-1
Video compression is a bit of an art form and requires trial and error to get your ﬁle where you 
want it. You’re essentially balancing quality and ﬁle size but it’s a ﬁne line sometimes between 
the two. Before rendering, you’ll examine the settings ﬁrst and then start to compare them. 
1. Open Adobe Media Encoder CS6.
2. In the Media Encoder, press the Add Source button. In the Open dialog box, navigate to 
the ﬂ13lessons folder and select the ﬂ1305.mov ﬁle. Press Open to load the video ﬁle into 
Media Encoder. 
3. Go to the Preset Browser portion of Media Encoder and click the arrow next to System 
Presets to open up the list and see the various settings. 
4. Click the arrow next to the Broadcast category and then click the arrow next to H.264.
5. Note the various options available in terms of the settings you can apply. You’ll typically 
target the native format options the video was shot in but there are times you have to jump 
to a diﬀerent format. 
6. Right-click on the HD 1080i 29.97 preset, choose Preset Settings to examine the preset 
settings a bit further. 
7. Keep Adobe Media Encoder open to continue with the next project.

applies to you. In the meantime, let’s set up a little comparison test to try some of them out...
1. Adobe Media Encoder CS6 should still be open from the previous project. 
2. From the Broadcast category, go to H.264 and select the NTSC DV preset. Choose Apply 
Preset from the upper right corner. 
3. Go to the Devices category and select DVD & Blu-ray. Go to the DVD sub-category and 
select the Match Source Attributes (High Quality) preset, apply it using the Apply Preset 
button to add it to the list. 
4. Go to the Web Video category and choose the Flash sub-category. Select the Match

Project 13-3
Processing video can be a very intensive function for your computer to perform. It can take a 
long time to ﬁnish the process so it’s best to close all other programs besides Media Encoder 
and just wait for the computer to ﬁnish before doing anything else. 
1. Adobe Media Encoder CS6 should still be open from the previous exercise. 
2. You should have 4 presets applied and ready to compress your video. Click to the right of 
each one under Output File and save them to a new folder called Rendered Videos. Name 
each one according to the compression you’re using. For example: Match Source F4V, 
Match Source FLV, H264, MPEG2.
3. Click the Start Queue button to start the process and take a break before going on to the 
next exercise since your computer will be busy for a little while. 
Comparing results
Project 13-4
After rendering, you’ll want to take a look at the results and compare. You’ll want to open 
each video you rendered and examine both the quality of the image the whole way through 
(which can actually change) and take note of the ﬁle sizes you end up with should you take the 
video to the Web or archive for storage as well. 
1. Quit out of Adobe Media Encoder CS6. 
2. Go to the Rendered Video folder you created in the previous exercise, open each video 
and examine both quality and ﬁle size.
3. Create a text, Word, or Excel document and outline the results of your tests. List the ﬁle 
size for each ﬁle, the perceived quality and any other observations that you’ve made.
4. Save the ﬁle as Media_encoder_results.

Now that you’ve built animations and interactive projects, it’s helpful to know what 
the options are in terms of delivering your projects to an audience. Flash ofers ways 
to output your projects online, through mobile devices, and more! You’ll need to 
explore these output options so you understand how to deliver your client’s projects 
to their appropriate target audience and method of delivery. 
Starting up
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
preferences. See “Resetting the Flash workspace” in the Starting up section of this book. 
You will work with several ﬁles from the ﬂ14lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that you have 
loaded the ﬂlessons folder onto your hard drive from http://www.wiley.com/college/sc/adobeseries. See 
“Loading lesson ﬁles” in the Starting up section of this book.

Lesson 14
The project
In this lesson, you won’t be creating a movie or even a piece of one. Instead, you’ll be 
publishing existing movies so you can put your creations to work. You will also learn how to 
customize publish settings for a variety of output formats across web, mobile and desktop (AIR). 
The publishing process
By now you should be very familiar with the Test Movie command. As you learned in 
previous lessons, the command generates an SWF ﬁle so that you can preview how your 
animation looks and how well its interactive elements behave. 
Although Test Movie works very well for preview purpose and generates a temporary .swf ﬁle 
in the process, the Publish command gives you a much wider range of options. By default, the 
Publish command creates an HTML page with your SWF ﬁle embedded into it for display in 
a browser. You can also specify other ﬁle types such as HQX, SWC (for easier distribution of 
assets), web-ready image formats (JPEG/GIF/PNG), stand-alone projector ﬁles (self running 
applications in .mov format for mac and .exe format for windows), and more. 
Publishing to the Web
For viewing in a web browser (the most common option), a Flash ﬁle must be embedded into a 
web page. Flash’s Publish command does all the work for you by creating an SWF ﬁle, as well 
as an HTML wrapper ﬁle (web page) that has your SWF ﬁle contained within it. Once you 
have published these ﬁles you can easily upload them to your website to display your work to 
the world. Prior to publishing however, you should utilize best practices for reducing the size 
of your Flash document during the ﬁle creation process by using symbols as much as possible, 
limiting shape tweens, breaking apart bitmaps, using libraries, calling graphics or videos from 
outside the published .swf ﬁle, and even optimizing images prior to import.
Publishing a ﬁle is simple. With your FLA ﬁle open, select File > Publish. Flash then creates 
HTML, SWF, and any supplemental JavaScript ﬁles (for version checking and browser 
support), and saves them to the directory that contains the FLA ﬁle, or another directory that 
you specify.
Before you publish, you may want to explore, and work with, some of the Publish settings that 
can tweak the appearance and behavior of your movie, as well as generate any additional ﬁle 
types you may need.

A Note on Accessibility
It’s important that when creating animations and projects in Flash to make sure that your project 
is accessible to the broadest number of people possible and to remember that not all users are 
experiencing content in the same way. There are a large group of users who have visual, auditory, 
and motor impairments who view content on the web using a screen reading device. Creating 
content that can be made accessible to users with these impairments is commonly referred to as 
accessibility.
Information provided to screen readers include dynamic text, movie clips, input text, buttons, 
Flash applications, and child objects in movie clips. Methods used to make Flash files accessible in 
rich media content include:
• Adding text equivalents for elements to provide a description of the image, link, graphic, or 
button.
• Allowing user reading order control of Flash content
• Add caption audio content for text when possible
• Placing the navigation scheme of the site on the page so that it is easily accessible.
• Use colors that provide significant contrast between elements on the page.
• Making looping elements inaccessible (because this can often cause a screen reader to reload 
the page and start reading from the beginning). You can hide objects from screen readers by 
unchecking the “make movie accessible” or “make child objects accessible” checkboxes in the 
Accessibility panel in Flash.
• Allowing users to control motion of an animation
• Ensuring controls for animations are keyboard accessible and providing keyboard navigation 
through shortcuts to allow for mouse-free navigation.
• Exposing the structure of complex Flash movies
• Exposing the state of the controls
• Using color wisely (incorporating colors that provide contrast with one another)
• Validate the accessibility of a document using a validation tool
• Allow tabbing between elements in a Flash animation
Objects are made accessible in Flash Professional using the Accessibility panel (Window > Other 
Panels > Accessibility). When you select an object that can be made accessible, options are displayed 
for that object. You can also set the accessibility properties for the entire document by making sure 
that no object is selected, then choosing the accessibility options in the Accessibility panel.

4. Here we can tell Flash how much to compress images used in our movie, which helps 
reduce overall ﬁle size. Click and drag to the left over the JPEG Quality value until it 
reads at about 85 as shown in Figure 14-2. This will increase the amount of compression 
on the bitmap images in your movie, and lower the ﬁle size with minimal sacriﬁce to 
image quality. Note that this is also where you can adjust the audio quality of the output 
ﬁle as well.

Take Note...
You can set many additional options for the Flash ile export under the Advanced options. 
Omit Trace Action and Permit Debugging are speciically geared toward working with 
ActionScript, while Generate Size Report creates a text ile that breaks down the size of each 
scene and symbol in your movie. You can also choose options such as “include hidden layers” 
which can be useful when exporting to HTML.

Take Note...
Although the example ile does not use any audio efects, you can use the Audio Stream 
and Audio Event options in the Publish Settings panel to control audio quality and how 
those types of audio objects are compressed. The default MP3 setting is very eicient in most 
situations. 
8. The Publish Settings dialog has some additional options to help compress movies and 
lower overall ﬁle size. Use these options to bring down the overall .swf size a bit more: 
choose File > Publish Settings once again to open up the Publish Settings dialog box. You 
should once again see the Flash (.swf) publishing options on the right side of the panel. 
Locate the Advanced section and click the arrow next to it to reveal advanced publishing 
options.
9. Locate the Compress movie option and check it. A drop-down list is enabled to let you 
select one of two eicient and loss-less (no information discarded) compression options: 
DEFLATE and LZMA. For now, choose LZMA from the drop-down list.
10. Click OK to exit the Publish Settings dialog box and apply the new settings. Repeat steps 
6 and 7 once again; you should notice that the ﬁle size has decreased slightly to about 
38Kb. Every byte counts, so this option can come in handy fairly often.
11. Once more, choose File > Publish Settings. Under the Other Formats category on the left, 
select the HTML Wrapper option to view the publish options for the HTML ﬁle that will 
contain your .swf ﬁle.

12. Locate the Size drop-down list and Width and Height values. By default, the Flash player 
is instructed to set your movie’s dimensions to 100% of the browser window dimensions. 
This may cause some unwanted side eﬀects, so if you want to keep your movie pixel-
perfect, select “Match Movie” from the Size drop-down list. This will set the publish size 
to match the actual movie dimensions. You’ll notice in Figure 14-4, you can’t change the 
Width and Height to arbitrary values any longer. (Those ﬁelds are now disabled.)
Figure 14-4: Modify size settings for the HTML Wrapper that will contain your movie.
13. Leave Window Mode, HTML Alignment, and Scale at the default settings. Window 
Mode controls the appearance of the box in which the SWF ﬁle appears; you can use it 
to create an SWF ﬁle with a transparent background. For now, leave this option set as 
Window.
Take Note...
Note that the example movie uses a nested movie clip symbol, the HTML tab’s Paused at 
Start and Loop Playback options would have no efect; they target the main Timeline only.

14. Click the arrow next to SCALE & ALIGNMENT to reveal these options. Set Flash 
Horizontal alignment to Center and Flash Vertical alignment to Center (Figure 14-5), 
which will place the SWF ﬁle in the center of the browser window.
Figure 14-5: Choose Center from both the Flash Horizontal alignment and Flash Vertical  
alignment drop-down menus.
15. Click the Publish button to publish your ﬁle with the settings you’ve chosen. Click OK to 
close the Publish Settings dialog box and File > Close to close the ﬁle. You may be asked 
if you want to save the changes, if so, click OK or Save to save changes. 
In the lesson ﬁles folder, you should see a newly created ﬂ1401.swf and ﬂ1401.html ﬁle 
sitting in this folder. Double-click the HTML ﬁle to view your published movie in a 
browser.
Creating Publish Proﬁles
Publish Settings are saved as part of your FLA file, so there’s no need to respecify them in 
between authoring sessions. However, it’s possible that you may want to share the same settings 
across multiple documents. For this purpose, you can create and save Publish profiles from the 
Publish Settings dialog box. 
Figure 14-6: Create Publish proiles from the Publish Settings dialog box.
While in Publish Settings, once you’ve selected the settings you want, Click the Profile Options 
button next to the currently selected Publish profile (most likely Default, if you haven’t created 
any before). Choose Create Profile, enter a Profile name and you’re good to go! This is saved as 
part of your application settings, so you can call this profile up at any time within any FLA file.

Publishing for the Desktop with Adobe AIR
Publishing for the Desktop with Adobe AIR
With all the capabilities Flash has to oﬀer when it comes to building rich Internet applications, 
it seems natural that it has evolved to become a great tool for building desktop and mobile 
applications, as well.
The Adobe AIR runtime makes it possible to deploy your Flash movies (FLV or F4V)as full-
blown desktop applications in a few clicks from your Publish Settings dialog box. Your movies 
will behave exactly as they do in a browser, and with a bit of ActionScript you can extend their 
capabilities to interact with the user’s operating system, work with local ﬁles, and connect to 
outside services to get data.
The Adobe AIR runtime (in version 3.2 at the time of this writing), much like the Flash Player, 
is available as a free download from the Adobe website, and is a quick install for most users. Best 
of all, AIR applications are cross-platform, so there’s no need to create separate installers for 
Windows vs. Mac OS platforms. One installer package can handle both.
Before you begin the next exercise, make sure you download and install the Adobe AIR 
runtime at http://get.adobe.com/air/.
Take Note...
You can also publish AIR applications from other applications in the Adobe Creative Suite. 
For example, Dreamweaver CS6 enables you to publish websites, including HTML, CSS 
and Javascript iles, as AIR applications too.
Follow these steps to work with Adobe AIR
Step-by-Step
1. Open the WeatherMate_start.ﬂa ﬁle from the ﬂ14lessons folder. This ﬁle contains the 
beginnings of a basic weather application widget. If you do not have the font used in this 
exercise, you may replace it with any other font on your computer. The exact font you use 
is not important for this exercise.
2. Choose File > Publish Settings to open the Publish Settings dialog box. Locate and click 
the Flash tab at the top to see Flash-speciﬁc publishing options.
3. From the Player drop-down menu at the top of the dialog box, select AIR 3.2 for Desktop 
(Figure 14-7), which will set the necessary publish options to deploy and install your 
movie as an AIR application on a user’s computer.
Figure 14-7: Set up your Target as AIR 3.2 for Desktop. The Player Settings button sits

Settings dialog box as shown in Figure 14-8. 
Figure 14-8: The Air Settings dialog box
Here you can set several options within this dialog box that will aﬀect how your installer 
will be packaged, how it appears to the user, and how the application behaves on the 
desktop. You’ll focus on the most essential ones for this exercise.
5. First, you’ll set the general options that determine your ﬁle and application name. In the 
Output ﬁle ﬁeld, change the name of your output ﬁle to WeatherMate.air; make sure to 
include the .air extension. This will be the name of the installer ﬁle that’s created. If you’d 
like, you can change the save location of the ﬁle using the folder icon to the right of the 
ﬁeld, but for the sake of this lesson, we’ll leave the default save location which is the same 
folder as your original .ﬂa ﬁle.
6. Under the Name and Version, enter WeatherMate and 2.0, respectively. These specify 
your application’s name as your users will see it, and a version number to correspond with 
the speciﬁc release you’re oﬀering. If you are not creating an oicial release, you can enter 
temporary information and set a default Version number. This is mostly to help your users 
identify your application.

7. Locate the App ID ﬁeld; here you can enter a unique ID for your application to 
distinguish it from other applications the user may have installed on their system. The 
suggested convention is known as “reverse DNS”—which includes your company domain 
and application name. If your company is digitalclassroombooks.com and the application is 
Weather, the ID should read: com.digitalclassroombooks.weathermate as stated above. 
For now, enter this in the ﬁeld.
8. Next, enter some descriptive text in the Description text ﬁeld, and relevant copyright info 
in the Copyright text ﬁeld as shown in Figure 14-9. These are optional, so you can leave 
them blank if nothing comes to mind at the moment. It is worth noting that in addition 
to this information, you can add additional information called metadata by choosing File 
> File info in Flash. This metadata can be read on mobile phones and is read by search 
engines when your ﬁle is posted to the internet to make it easier to ﬁnd.

Lesson 14
Copyright Considerations
Copyrighting of items is an important consideration for both you as an author and as a user of 
media in your projects. As you can see in the AIR Settings dialog box above, Flash provides an 
area where you can enter copyright information for you or your company to let people know 
that this is your work and that it’s protected under the copyright law. The same rules apply when 
you are using images and artwork in your own projects. Always pay attention to the copyright 
status of artwork and images that you are using. Copyright status is usually indicated by the word 
“copyright” or a © symbol or the date of publication.
Permission should always be obtained to use copyrighted material in your work. This includes 
works of intellectual property (songs, literature, and artistic works), as well as derivative works 
(works that are based on original works but have been modified enough to constitute original 
work). With the exception of cases of fair use or instances that fall under the fair use doctrine 
(which provides for the use of copyrighted material for news reporting, comment, criticism, 
teaching, and research), if the copyright status is ever in question, assume that the work is 
copyrighted! When citing websites, images, sound, video, and text in your work, make sure you 
cite them properly using MLA, APA, or Chicago style writing.
9. Next, you’ll set the Window Style, which determines how your application is framed, 
and how it appears on the desktop. The default option is System Chrome, which places a 
system window around your application. For this application, however, it would be pretty 
cool to have it be transparent and reveal the user’s desktop below, so select the Custom 
Chrome (transparent) option instead.
10. Select the Signature tab at the top of the dialog box.
The digital signature of your application veriﬁes its authenticity and provides a level 
of conﬁdence to your end users/buyers, and is required by most sales and distribution 
channels. For commercial distribution, it’s recommended you purchase a digital certiﬁcate 
(see the section “About Digital Certiﬁcates”). For now, you’ll continue the steps to create a 
self-signed certiﬁcate for this example.
11. Next to the Certiﬁcate drop-down menu, click the New (Mac OS) or Create (Windows) 
button to begin creating a self-signed certiﬁcate.
12. Fill in the text ﬁelds for Publisher Name, Organization Unit, Organization Name, and 
Country (these will be speciﬁc to your business).
13. Create a password by entering it in the Password and Conﬁrm Password text ﬁelds 
(Figure 14-10). You’ll be asked for this again later, when signing your application.
Figure 14-10: Creating a self-signed certiicate allows you to install and run your application  
for testing or limited distribution.

click Save. Press OK to create the certiﬁcate and return to the AIR Settings dialog box.
15. The new certiﬁcate should be shown in the Certiﬁcate ﬁeld. Enter the password you 
created for your certiﬁcate in the password text ﬁeld, and for the sake of convenience, 
check Remember Password for this Session. Press OK to exit the Application & Installer 
Settings dialog box.
16. In the Publish Settings dialog box, press the Publish button to create your .air installer ﬁle.

your new digital certiﬁcate again—do so, and then click the Publish button once again, if 
necessary.
17. Choose File > Save to save your work, then close your document. If you return to the 
ﬂ14lessons folder, you should see a series of new ﬁles created, including a ﬁle named 
WeatherMate.air.
About Digital Certificates
Digital certiﬁcates are used to verify the security and authenticity of a software application, 
and are commonly used for distribution of commercial and non-commercial applications. 
Depending upon your needs, you can purchase these certiﬁcates from vendors such as Thawte 
(http://www.thawte.com) and VeriSign (http://www.verisign.com). 
While a self-signed certiﬁcate will work for testing and limited distribution, if you are 
considering making your AIR application available for sale, or wide distribution, a certiﬁcate 
can provide an extra level of conﬁdence for your consumers.
Installing Your New AIR Application
Installing your new AIR application is an easy task, especially if you’ve already taken the 
time to install the Adobe AIR Runtime. Adobe AIR does the work for you, registering your 
new application on the system and making it available, just like any other application on your 
computer.
Take Note...
Make sure you have the Adobe AIR 3.2 runtime installed on your system. If you attempt 
to install an AIR 3.2 application on a system running an older version of AIR, you may 
receive an error message.
Follow these steps to install a new AIR application
Step-by-Step
1. From your Windows Explorer or Mac Finder, locate the WeatherMate.air installer ﬁle 
that you published to the ﬂ14lessons folder.
On Windows, if your extensions are hidden you may need look closely at each 
weathermate ﬁle and choose the Adobe Air application. If you are still unsure, select a ﬁle, 
right-click and choose Properties, then locate the type. You can double-click Adobe Air 
applications to open them.

installation. Note: You may get security warnings if you’re using your own self-signed 
certiﬁcate as shown in Figure 14-11. 
Figure 14-11: The various stages of installing your AIR application. 
4. When the installation is complete, locate your new application under the Start menu 
(Windows) or the Applications folder (Mac OS), and launch it.
You will notice that the WeatherMate application appears with no deﬁned background or 
window; the desktop below, and only the application artwork itself shows. This is because 
you chose the Custom Chrome (Transparent) option in your publish settings in the 
previous exercise. Remember that a Flash movie is actually transparent, so the Stage will 
not appear in this environment.

Lesson 14: Delivering Your Final Movie 
Publishing for Mobile Devices
Publishing for Mobile Devices
The Adobe AIR runtime has made it possible to take Flash beyond the browser and onto the 
desktop, and now you can author and publish native iOS and Android applications using the 
AIR for iOS and AIR for Android document and publish options.
There are many steps to take toward publishing stable and successful mobile applications: you’ll 
need to become familiar with the respective SDKs and developer guidelines, set up developer 
accounts and testing devices, to name a few. These activities are beyond the scope of this book, 
but in this section we’ll touch on the very basics for setting up your FLA for publishing to the 
iOS and Android platforms. 
Before You Begin
If you would like to get started with mobile application development, we suggest visiting the 
following resources:
The iOS Developer center on Apple.com Visit http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index to set up 
a new developer account and get started. You’ll also need to make sure you have the SDK and the 
latest version of Mac OS X and the XCode tools installed.
The Android Developer center at Android OS at http://developer.android.com/index.html to get 
started and download the SDK.
As always, before creating or publishing an application for these mobile platforms, make sure you 
meet the development guidelines suggested by Apple and Android/Google. You can get started 
in the right direction by using one of the pre-sized documents from the Start Page or the New 
Document dialog boxes. 
Publishing for iOS
The following steps take you through the basics of publishing an existing Flash document 
for installation on an iOS device such as an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. This assumes you 
are using the appropriately sized document template and have followed the basic guidelines 
suggested by Apple.
Follow these steps to publish a Flash document for an iOS device
Step-by-Step
1. Open the ﬂ14_iphone.ﬂa ﬁle from the ﬂ14lessons folder. This ﬁle contains a simple movie 
based on the AIR for iOS document template.
2. Choose File > Publish Settings to open the Publish Settings dialog box. Next to the 
Target drop-down menu in the upper-right corner, click the Player Settings button ( ) to 
open the AIR for iOS settings dialog box.
3. You’ll start at the General settings tab (Figure 14-12). Fill in the appropriate name and output 
ﬁle for your app, as well as the appropriate settings for Aspect Ratio, Render Mode, and 
Device.

4. Select the Deployment tab, choose the certiﬁcate provided to you for iOS development as 
part of your developer account, and specify your provisioning proﬁle.
Take Note...
These iles and settings are available under the Apple Developer Center as part of your 
proile.
Figure 14-12: Enter important settings for your iOS application, such as name, certiicate,  
and icons.
Take Note...
A provisioning proile is created as part of your iOS Developer Center account, and connects 
you and other developers in a group to test devices and to an authorized development group. 
If you work as part of a larger development team within an organization, it’s possible that 
you can obtain this from your IT or development manager (or the person responsible for your 
company’s developer account with Apple).

5. Choose the Deployment type, which determines how the app is packaged. You can 
package it for ﬁnal App Store delivery or speciﬁcally for local testing and debugging. If 
you are still in testing and development, you may want to leave the default setting (Quick 
publishing for device testing).
6. Select the Icons tab. In each respective ﬁeld, specify a graphic ﬁle for each of the required 
icon sizes, as shown. For specs and guidelines on preparing icons for an iPhone or iPad 
application, you can check the iOS developer center or this article at http://developer.apple.
com/library/ios/#documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/IconsImages/IconsImages.html.
7. Select the Languages tab, and choose the languages you will be targeting for your 
application. If you are targeting only North American and English speaking users, select 
English for now. If you are working as part of a team, make sure to consult the project lead 
or development manager to verify these settings.
8. Click OK to close the AIR for iOS Settings dialog box. 
9. Click OK to close the Publish Settings dialog box and save your options, or click Publish 
to publish your application right away.
Take Note...
To save time, check out the “Creating Publish Proiles” sidebar earlier in the chapter to learn 
how to save your Publish Settings for reuse across other projects and iles. 
Publishing for Android OS
Just as with iOS devices, you can target and publish native applications for Android devices, 
and specify the appropriate settings in the Publish Settings dialog box. With Android devices, 
however, you have some added abilities to easily install and debug on a connected Android 
device, a feature added in Flash CS5.5, to make testing and setup a bit easier. Make sure to 
consult the Android Developer guidelines for creating an Android application and setting up 
testing devices.
Follow these steps to publish a Flash document for Android devices
Step-by-Step
1. Open the ﬂ14_android.ﬂa ﬁle from the ﬂ14lessons folder. This ﬁle contains a simple 
movie based on the AIR for Android document template.
2. Choose File > Publish Settings to open the Publish Settings dialog box, and click the 
Player Settings icon next to the Target drop-down list in the upper-right corner. (It should 
read AIR 3.2 for Android.)

Using Export Movie
You can extend your range of output formats by using the Export Movie command. In 
addition to creating SWF ﬁles, Export Movie can export the content of the main Timeline 
to still images for editing in applications like Photoshop, Premiere, and After Eﬀects, or FXG 
format for exchange with other applications that support vector graphics.
Follow these steps to export a movie
Step-by-Step
1. In the ﬂ14lessons folder, open the ﬁle named ﬂ1403.ﬂa, which is a variation of the 
animated website footer you worked with in the ﬁrst exercise. The main diﬀerence is that 
here the animation takes place on the main Timeline instead of in a nested movie clip. 
This is a very important distinction when exporting Flash content to other formats, as the 
majority of the exportable formats lack interactivity and simply display the content of the 
main Timeline as it appears in Flash.
2. Choose File > Export > Export Movie.
Take Note...
This exercise covers exporting the entire movie from the Timeline. If you would rather export 
only a single frame, select that frame, and then choose File > Export > Export Image.
3. In the resulting dialog box, choose the ﬂ14lessons folder in the Save As (Mac OS) or Save 
In (Windows) drop-down menu, if it is not already listed there.
4. Select QuickTime (.mov) in the Format drop-down menu. This creates a stand-alone 
QuickTime movie that can be played using the free QuickTime player, converted for 
display on such mobile devices as PSPs and iPods, or imported into video editing or 
motions graphics programs, such as Adobe Premiere or After Eﬀects. Press Save. The 
QuickTime Export Settings dialog box appears.
5. Click the Quicktime Settings button in the lower-left corner; here you can ﬁne-tune 
options for size, audio settings and other ﬁle-speciﬁc options. Press OK when you are

An overview of FTP 
FTP is an acronym for the phrase File Transfer Protocol. These are the set of rules that allow 
diﬀerent computers to connect to each other over the Web. Once you have created and 
published your Flash movie, you need to upload it to a web server in order to allow people to 
view it online. Whether this web server is one that you maintain yourself, one set up for you 
by your company’s IT department, or space you rent from a web host, the publishing process is 
basically the same. While there are stand-alone FTP applications that allow you to connect to 
a web server, Adobe’s industry-leading web design application, Dreamweaver, comes complete 
with an internal FTP engine that integrates very well with Flash content. The basic steps to 
follow when uploading Flash content for the Internet are:
Follow these steps to upload Flash content for the Internet
Step-by-Step
1. Create a Flash movie and publish it to your local hard drive.
2. Upload your Flash movie to your web server, along with any secondary content (HTML 
and JavaScript ﬁles) created by the publishing process. Your web hosting service or IT 
department can provide you with information on where to upload your ﬁles, as well as the 
login and password information you need to connect. 
Take Note...
If you published a Flash movie with an accompanying HTML ile, chances are that some 
additional JavaScript iles were also created. It is essential that these iles are copied with your 
.swf and .html iles up to the web server in order for the Flash movie to appear properly.

3. If you want to make any changes to the movie, edit the ﬁle you published to your local 
hard drive, not the version on the web server.
4. Re-upload the edited version of your Flash movie to the web server, including any 
secondary content you may have modiﬁed.
Testing a document
Before going live with a Flash project, it’s important to run a technical and/or usability test of 
the document. Doing so ensures that the end-user experience is positive and that the project 
works as expected. During this test, all aspects of the project should be tested. Components 
such as links, buttons, and navigation should be tested to be sure they are working properly. 
It’s also a good time to check for ActionScript errors and analyze load times. Usability testing 
often requires employees or volunteers to test an animation. In these cases you may want to 
observer users as they are testing the animation and possibly even conduct interviews to gain 
feedback and recommendations.
When you choose Control > Test Movie in Flash, a .swf ﬁle is automatically generated to 
preview the animation. A more accurate test is to actually publish the animation so that a 
.swf and an HTML document are generated using the settings deﬁned in the Publish Settings 
dialog box which more accurately represents how the animation will perform.
Taking the time to test the document can save frustration and time on the part of end-users 
and the developers as well.
Testing a Flash document against a storyboard
A storyboard consists of a number of pages that describe an animation, each page may have a 
list of related links, a functional description of the animation, images, text and some notes on 
content for the animation. You can do a comparison of your ﬁnal animation to the storyboard 
by using it as a checklist of sorts. Does the functionality and content of the ﬁnal animation 
reﬂect the functionality and content of the storyboard? If not, then why not? Was the content 
removed (or never delivered?) In the end, if the storyboards were well thought out, this step 
is a good measure of success. Were you able to include all the features you had originally 
planned? Maybe you ended up adding more, in which case you should ask for a raise!

Publishing options
Project 14-1
Publishing in Flash isn’t necessarily only about the Web and mobile devices. There are other 
ways to deliver your project that incorporate CD-rom or desktop storage rather than being 
uploaded to the Web or a device. 
1. Open Adobe Flash CS6 if not already running.
2. From the ﬂ14lessons folder, open the ﬁle named ﬂ1402.ﬂa. 
3. Choose File > Save As and save the ﬁle as game.ﬂa.
4. Choose File > Publish Settings. Note that Win Projector and Mac Projector are already 
selected and ready to go. Projectors are self-contained applications speciﬁc to the Mac and 
Windows operating systems. 
5. Click on each of the Projector formats and designate where you would like to save them. 
6. Publish and take a look at the results on the platform speciﬁc to the computer you’re using. 
The advantage to projectors is that they need no outside application (like Flash Player) to 
view them, they are their own players and software. 
7. Keep the game.ﬂa ﬁle open for the next project. 
Dealing with older players
Project 14-2
Unfortunately not everyone updates their computer software on a consistent basis. Even 
though Flash Player is installed on upwards of 98% of all computers on the internet, not all 
versions of the player on each computer is the same. Inevitably, you will run into people who 
have older versions of the player; the good thing is that there’s a way to force their hand a bit 
more in terms of getting them to update their software. 
1. The game.ﬂa ﬁle should still be open from the last project. 
2. Choose File > Publish Settings. Click on the HTML Wrapper setting. 
3. Click the checkbox that speciﬁes to Detect Flash Version.
4. The default is Version 8. This is a good base but feel free to adjust as needed. 
5. Keep this ﬁle open for the next project.

Previewing on the ly
Project 14-3
Instead of choosing Control > Test Movie (which always generates a .swf ﬁle) you can preview 
with your ﬁnal output ﬁle that may not be an actual .swf (such as a projector). 
1. The game.ﬂa ﬁle should still be open from the last exercise. 
2. Choose File > Publish Preview > Default - (Project Projector). 
3. Keep this ﬁle open. 
Exporting Speciic Objects
Project 14-4
You can save your whole Flash movie as a ﬂattened image but you can also be a bit more 
selective about the pieces of the artwork themselves and single things out you may want as 
individual graphics. 
1. The game.ﬂa ﬁle should still be open from the last project. 
2. Select the plane on the Stage. Choose File > Export > Export Selection. Save the plane as 
plane.fxg and use it for other projects!
Circling Back 3
Complex programs like Flash often oﬀer the opportunity to streamline your workﬂow 
through the use of presets. Presets come in handy when you’re doing something consistently 
from one project through the next. You’ve already experienced some inherit presets such as the 
Code Snippets. Now, you’ll create a new preset for the purpose of publishing your work.
Setting Up a publishing template
Project 1
Your company has asked you to come up with a publishing preset for Flash that can be used 
company wide by all the Flash designers to ensure consistency when each designer publishes to 
the corporate website. Your ﬁrst step will be to establish the settings for the template.
1. Create a new ActionScript 3.0 document in Flash.
2. Choose File > Publish Settings.
3. Click the Proﬁle Options button at the top of the Publish Settings window. Choose Create 
proﬁle.
4. Name the proﬁle Publishing Template.
5. Click on the Flash (.swf) setting on the PUBLISH panel on the right of the window.
6. Set the JPEG Quality to 100. Click the checkboxes to turn on the following:
Permit debugging
Omit trace statements
Protect from import

7. Select the HTML Wrapper option under OTHER FORMATS. 
8. Click the checkbox for Detect Flash Version and set the version to 8. 
9. Click the checkbox for Device Font.
10. Keep this window open for the next project. 
Preparing to share
Project 2
Now that you’ve established the settings for your template, the time has come to make these 
settings accessible for everyone else that needs them.
1. Go to the Proﬁle Options button and select Export Proﬁle. 
2. Save the ﬁle as dc_preset.xml someplace easy to access such as your desktop,
3. Keep this window open for the next part of the project. 
Importing Publishing Proile into Flash
Project 3
Since you’re ﬂying solo here, we’ll simulate the situation in terms of how the template you just 
created can be imported and shared from one computer to another. 
1. Go to the Proﬁle Options button and select Delete Proﬁle to remove the Publishing 
Template.
2. To re-import it and simulate the experience for a diﬀerent user, click on the Proﬁle 
Options button and choose Import proﬁle. 
3. Navigate to the Publishing Template.xml ﬁle and re-import your publishing settings!
