PREFACE
The ninth edition of ELECTRICITY 2 has been updated to reflect current materials and tech-
niques in electrical applications, while maintaining the features that have made the text so popular
through previous editions. Summary statements are found at the end of each unit, and several new
problems have been included in the Achievement Review sections.
ELECTRICITY 2 helps the student achieve a basic understanding of the characteristics of
alternating-current circuits and the devices contained in the circuits. The knowledge obtained by a
study of this text permits the student to progress to further study. It should be realized that both the
development of the subject of electricity and the study of the subject are continuing processes. The
electrical industry constantly introduces new and improved devices and materials, which in turn often
lead to changes in installation techniques. Electrical codes undergo periodic revisions to upgrade
safety and quality in electrical installations.
The text is easy to read and the topics are presented in a logical sequence. The problems pro-
vided in the text require the use of simple algebra and simple trigonometry for their solutions. The
student is advised that electron movement (from negative to positive) is used in this text to define cur-
rent direction.
Each unit begins with objectives to alert students to the learning that is expected as a result of study-
ing the unit. An Achievement Review at the end of each unit tests student understanding to determine if
the objectives have been met. Following selected groups of units (Units 1–9 and 11–15), a Summary
Review unit contains additional questions and problems to test student comprehension of a block of
information. This combination of reviews is essential to the learning process required by this text.
All students of electricity will find this text useful, especially those in electrical apprenticeship
programs, trade and technical schools, and various occupational programs.
The most recent edition of the National Electrical Code® (published by the National Fire
Protection Association [NFPA]) should be available for reference as the student uses ELECTRICITY 2.
Applicable state and local regulations should also be consulted when executing actual installations.
Features of the ninth edition include
•
Summary statements in all units
•
Up-to-date content reflecting current methods and materials of the trade
•
Currency with the most recent edition of the National Electrical Code®
•
Detailed problem solutions in most units
•
Achievement Reviews that reinforce concepts
•
Practical problems to test student learning
•
Numerous new problems for student practice
Instructor’s Guides for ELECTRICITY 1 through ELECTRICITY 4 are available. The guides
include the answers to the Achievement Reviews and Summary Reviews for each text and additional
test questions covering the content of each text. Instructors can use these questions to devise tests to
evaluate student learning.

ALTERNATING-CURRENT PRINCIPLES
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• discuss the characteristics of alternating current.
• describe the generation of alternating current.
• define the terminology related to alternating current.
Most of the electrical energy used in the United States is generated as alternat-
ing current (AC). This is not because alternating current is superior to direct current
(DC) in industrial or residential applications. In fact, there are many instances where
direct-current energy is necessary for industrial purposes. Where direct current is
required, alternating current is generated at a power station as shown in Figure 1-1,
transmitted some distance, and then converted to direct current at the point where it
will be used.
The reasons for generating nearly all electrical energy as alternating current are as
follow:
1. Alternators (AC generators) have no commutators. Therefore, units with higher
power ratings and the resultant heavier current ratings can be used without the
problem of brush arcing and heating.
2. Because alternators lack commutators, they are capable of generating compara-
tively high voltages, such as 11,000 to 13,800 volts.
3. Alternating-current energy can be transmitted economically over great distances.
Therefore, alternating current can be generated in large quantities in a single station
and distributed over a large territory.
4. For constant-speed work, the alternating-current, squirrel-cage induction motor is
less expensive than the direct-current motor, both in initial cost and maintenance.
GENERATING ALTERNATING VOLTAGE
The volt (V) is the unit of electromotive force (EMF). One volt is developed by cut-
ting 100 million magnetic lines of force in 1 second. The simplest method of generating
EMF is by turning a coil of wire between two magnetic field poles.

Figure 1-2 illustrates a simple alternating-current generator. The left-hand rule
is used to determine the direction of the current in the coil and in the external circuit
created by the generated EMF.
Figure 1-3 is a more convenient form of representing the simple generator in
Figure 1-2. A front-view section from the slip ring side of the generator is shown.
Cycles
One cycle of alternating current is defined as current that increases from zero to a
positive maximum, returns to zero, and then increases to a negative maximum and returns
to zero again. In other words, a cycle occurs from a point on the waveform to another
point where the waveform begins to repeat itself. The terms “positive” and “negative” are
used to indicate opposite directions. (See Figures 1-4 through 1-8.)

MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL DEGREES
In Figure 1-8, the complete turn represents
When a coil or a conductor makes one complete revolution, it passes through 360
mechanical degrees. When either an EMF or an alternating current passes through one
cycle, it passes through 360 electrical degrees.
If a single-loop coil is placed in a generator that has four magnetic poles, two complete
cycles of alternating current or 720 electrical degrees are generated in one mechanical rev-
olution because one cycle is generated when each side of a coil or loop passes two poles.
FREQUENCY
Frequency is the number of electrical cycles that occur in 1 second. If the coil in
Figure 1-8 turns at the rate of 3,600 revolutions per minute (3,600 r/min), or 60 revolutions
per second, 60 electrical cycles are generated in 1 second. The electrical frequency is
60 cycles per second, or 60 hertz (Hz). With the four-pole generator in Figure 1-9, assum-
ing the same speed of 3,600 r/min, the number of electrical cycles generated in 1 second
is 120. This is true because two electrical cycles are generated during each mechanical
revolution. The frequency is 120 Hz.
Formulas commonly used to find frequency, speed, and number of poles follow:

EFFECTIVE VALUE OF ALTERNATING CURRENT
A 60-Hz, 120-volt line contains current and EMF varying from zero to maximum
positive and negative values 60 times per second. Instantaneous values are of little value.
The effective values, shown in Figure 1-10, have been accepted as practical working
quantities. When values of current and voltage are specified in AC circuits, they are under-
stood as effective values, unless otherwise specified. The values indicated by AC amme-
ters and voltmeters are effective values.

The effective value of alternating current produces the equivalent amount of heat
at a load as the same numerical value of direct current.
Example: An electric heater is rated at 10 amperes (A) AC or DC. Either current 
produces the same amount of heat in a given amount of time.
SINGLE PHASE
Voltage generated in a single winding of a generator is called single-phase voltage.
IN PHASE
When both the voltage wave and the current wave reach their corresponding zeros,
maxima, and intermediate values at exactly the same time, they are said to be in phase,
as shown in Figure 1-11.
OUT OF PHASE (LAG)
When current is supplied to an induction motor or any circuit with inductance, it
lags the voltage. This current is out of phase with the voltage, as shown in Figure 1-12.
OUT OF PHASE (LEAD)
A synchronous motor or capacitor connected to a line causes current to lead the
voltage by as much as 90 electrical degrees. Figure 1-13 shows a current out of phase
with the voltage.
SUMMARY
The left-hand rule is a handy way to predict the direction of induced current in a gen-
erator. The graph describing the induced current is alternating; hence, alternating current.
There is a positive maximum current, and a negative maximum. Frequency of alternations

Unit 1 Alternating-Current Principles
is expressed as hertz. The alternating current supplied to residences has a frequency of
60 Hz. Because the current changes from positive to negative, an effective value is used
to described a steady-state value. The effective value is used for electrical calculations.

INDUCTANCE AND 
INDUCTIVE REACTANCE
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• describe an inductive circuit.
• describe self-induction and mutual induction.
• define inductive reactance.
• demonstrate the relationship between voltage and current in various inductive
circuits by the use of vectors.
A coil of wire is an important part of many pieces of electrical equipment. A mag-
netic field is produced when current exists in the coil. As the strength of the magnetic
field changes, an induced electromotive force (EMF) is created across the coil. The
induced voltage opposes the source voltage. As the opposition becomes greater, less
current exists in the circuit.
The coil has a property that opposes change in the current. This property is called
inductance (L). The amount of opposition to current change is called inductive reac-
tance, and is a function of frequency and inductance.
LENZ’S LAW
According to Lenz’s law, the induced voltage in a coil always flows in the 
opposite direction of the effect that produces it.
Self-Inductance
When the varying lines of magnetic force induce an EMF in the coil itself, the coil
has self-inductance.
Mutual Inductance
When the varying lines of magnetic force from a coil induce an EMF in an adja-
cent coil, the coils have mutual inductance. Figure 2-1 illustrates a transformer contain-
ing a primary coil and a secondary coil. The primary coil contains a current that creates

12
Unit 2 Inductance and Inductive Reactance
a magnetic field. Part of the field links the secondary coil.
Because the field is changing, a voltage is induced in the sec-
ondary. This is a step-up transformer because the secondary
voltage is greater than the primary voltage. An actual trans-
former is shown in Figure 2-2.
Measurement of Inductance
The unit of inductance is the henry (H). A circuit or coil has an inductance of 1 H
when current varying at the rate of 1 ampere per second induces an EMF of 1 volt across
the terminals of the circuit or coil. The inductance can be varied by varying the amount
of magnetic flux or the number of turns in the coil.
Effect of Inductance
Example: Connect a lamp in series with a coil having a movable iron core. Connect
the combination to an AC source. Note the following conditions:
Core out of coil – Lamp will be bright
Core in coil
– Lamp will be dim
When the core is out of the coil, few lines of magnetic force are produced by the
coil because air is a poor magnetic conductor. The induced EMF is weak, and little oppo-
sition is offered to the line voltage. Therefore, a normal quantity of current exists in the
lamp.
When the iron core is inserted in the coil, a better magnetic path is provided. Induced
EMF is higher, and consequently, there is less current as indicated by the dim lamp.

Inductive Reactance
The opposition in coils having inductance can be measured in ohms (Ω). If the fre-
quency and inductance are known, the opposition, or inductive reactance (XL), can be
calculated.
XL = 2πfL
Where
XL
= inductive reactance in ohms
π
= 3.14
f
= frequency in hertz
L
= inductance in henrys
Examples:
Coil A
f = 60 Hz
L = 0.1 H
XL = 2 × 3.14 × 60 × 0.1 = 37.7 Ω
Coil B
f = 60 Hz
L = 0.2 H
XL = 2 × 3.14 × 60 × 0.2 = 75.4 Ω
If Coil B is connected to 120 Hz:
XL = 2 × 3.14 × 120 × 0.2 = 150.7 Ω
Therefore, it can be said that
inductive reactance varies directly with 
inductance and frequency.
Current Lag Due to Inductance
Tests show that if a coil with negligible resistance is connected to an AC line, the
current lags the voltage by 90°, as shown in Figure 2-3.
VECTOR REPRESENTATION
The relationship between voltage and
current in an inductive circuit is shown more
conveniently by the use of vectors.
A vector is a line representing quantity or
magnitude and direction.
The vectors shown in Figure 2-4 repre-
sent 110 volts with a current of 10 amperes
lagging by 90°. These vectors may be visual-
ized as clock hands rotating in a counter-
clockwise direction.

14
Unit 2 Inductance and Inductive Reactance
The lengths of the vectors in Fig-
ure 2-4 depend on the scale used. The scale
for the voltage vector is 1 inch = 50 volts.
The length of the vector is 110/50 = 2.2 in-
ches. The scale for the current vector is
1 inch = 10 amperes.
FINDING CURRENT
Figure 2-5 and the following exam-
ple show how current is determined in an
AC inductive circuit.
First, find XL:
XL
= 2πfL
= 2 × 3.14 × 60 × 0.3
= 113.1 Ω
Using Ohm’s law,
I
= 
= 1.06 A
Example: What is the value of the inductance in Figure 2-6?
SUMMARY
Inductance is the property of a coil of wire. The frequency of current passing
through the coil helps to determine the inductive reactance of that coil. Inductive reac-
tance is similar to resistance in a circuit because it opposes the establishment of current.
In a circuit containing only inductance, the current will lag behind the voltage by 90°, as
seen in the waveforms.

CAPACITANCE AND
CAPACITIVE REACTANCE
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• discuss the characteristics of capacitance.
• describe the effect of capacitance in an alternating-current circuit.
• use vectors to show the voltage and current relationship in a capacitor.
Practically all electrical equipment contains a combination of resistors or coils.
Some industrial equipment, such as capacitor motors, capacitor banks, and automatic
switch gear, use capacitors. Transmission lines have capacitance between the wires.
A capacitor consists of two plates of electrical conducting material separated by an
insulating material. The plates are commonly aluminum, tin, or any other nonmagnetic
substance. The insulating material, called the dielectric, may be any of a large variety of
substances, such as air, mica, glass, wax, paper, fiber, rubber, or oil as per Figure 3-1.
When electric potential is connected to the plates, an electrical charge is stored in
the capacitor. In an AC circuit, the alternating voltage causes the capacitor to charge and
discharge during every cycle. Although current cannot pass through the capacitor, an
ammeter connected in the line will measure current resulting from the alternating charge
and discharge.

Unit 3 Capacitance and Capacitive Reactance
CAPACITANCE
Capacitance is the property of a capacitor, and is defined as the amount of electri-
cal charge that a capacitor receives for each volt of applied potential. The unit for capac-
itance is the farad (F). However, the farad is a very large unit in terms of the charges that
are normally present, so the microfarad (µF) is generally used.
CAPACITIVE REACTANCE
A capacitor in a circuit limits the current therein just as resistance and inductive
reactance limit current.
The opposition from a capacitor is called capacitive reactance (XC).
If the capacity (in microfarads) and the frequency are known, the reactance in
ohms can be calculated.
Where
XC = capacitive reactance in ohms

Capacitive reactance varies indirectly with capacitance and frequency.
Capacitive reactance may be decreased by increasing either the capacitance or the
frequency.
DANGER: A capacitor holds a charge for a long period of time following use in a 
circuit. Discharge a capacitor before handling. The proper method for discharging is
shown in Figure 3-2.

CURRENT LEADS THE VOLTAGE IN A CAPACITOR
A capacitor connected to an AC line causes the current to lead the voltage by
90°, as shown in Figure 3-3. Oscilloscope pictures of the current and voltage wave-
forms show this relationship. Figure 3-4 uses vectors to show the same information as
Figure 3-3.
When capacitors are connected in parallel, their combined capacitance may be
found using the method by which the combined resistance of series-connected resistors
is found:
Ct = C1 + C2 + C3

Unit 3 Capacitance and Capacitive Reactance
When capacitors are connected in series, their combined capacitance may be found
using the method by which the combined resistance of parallel-connected resistors is
found:
When only two capacitors are connected in series, their combined capacitance is
found by the product over the sum method:

SUMMARY
Capacitors are built to store an electrical charge. Capacitance is the property of a
capacitor, and capacitive reactance results from the amount of capacitance and the fre-
quency of the current.As with inductive resonance, capacitive reactance is similar to resis-
tance in terms of its opposition to the establishment of current in a circuit. The difference
is that the current in a capacitive circuit leads the voltage. In a circuit containing only
capacitance, the current will lead by 90°. A wide variety of capacitors exists to provide
unique characteristics for circuits and systems. One such capacitor is shown in Figure 3-8.

SERIES CIRCUIT: RESISTANCE
AND INDUCTANCE
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• explain the current–voltage relationship in an AC series circuit containing resis-
tance and inductance.
• apply vectors to the analysis of an RL AC series circuit.
RESISTANCE AND INDUCTANCE IN SERIES
Resistors, coils, and capacitors may be connected in series in several combinations for
specialized purposes. One such purpose is shown in Figure 4-1 regarding automobile pro-
duction. This unit focuses on a circuit containing a resistor connected in series with a coil.
Resistors and coils offer opposition to alternating current. The voltage and current
in a resistor are in phase. In a coil, however, the current lags the voltage drop across the
coil by 90°.
The combined opposition of resistors and coils is called impedance and 
is measured in ohms.
Circuit A: Series Circuit Containing Two Resistors
As shown in Figure 4-2, the current in a series circuit is the same throughout. The
total resistance is the sum of all the resistances in the circuit. The total voltage is the sum
of the voltage across each resistor.
Circuit B: Series Circuit Containing a Resistor and a Coil
For the 5-ohm resistor in Figure 4-3, the current is in phase with the voltage. The
current in the coil lags the coil voltage by 90°. The line current lags the total or line volt-
age by less than 90° depending on the values of R and XL.
The resistance and the reactance must, therefore, be added vectorially to 
obtain the value of impedance.

30
Unit 4 Series Circuit: Resistance and Inductance
The value of the impedance or total opposition, Z, can be calculated by substitut-
ing the values given in the formula in Figure 4-4.
Voltages ER and EL can be added vectorially as shown in Figure 4-5 to obtain a total
voltage ET.
The calculation for total voltage is similar to the calculation for impedance:
Notice that the current vector is included in Figure 4-5. The current is in phase with
ER as expected. In an inductive circuit, the current always lags the voltage. In Figure 4-5,
the current lags the total voltage by 63.4°.

First, find XL.

Then, use the impedance formula:

Use Ohm’s law:
To find the voltages across R and L, use Ohm’s law again:
ER = IR = 2.4 × 40 = 96 V
EL = IXL = 2.4 × 30 = 72 V
SUMMARY
When a circuit contains resistance and inductance, the combined opposition to cur-
rent is called impedance. Using Ohm’s law, the current in a circuit is equal to the total
voltage divided by the total impedance. The current will lag behind the total voltage. The
amount of lag is greater than 0° and less than 90°, and depends solely on the amount of
resistance and inductive reactance in the circuit. In a series RL circuit, the total voltage
will be the vector sum of the voltage across the resistance and the voltage across the
inductive reactance.

SERIES CIRCUIT: 
RESISTANCE AND CAPACITANCE
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• describe the relationships of voltage and current in a series circuit containing
resistance and capacitance.
• apply vectors in the analysis of an RC series circuit.
RESISTANCE AND CAPACITANCE IN SERIES
A combination frequently used in electrical circuits is a resistor in series with a
capacitor. The total effect of this combination is similar to an inductive series circuit with
the exception that the current leads the total voltage. The total opposition to current in
RC circuits is called impedance (just as in RL circuits).
In the 5-ohm resistor in Figure 5-1, the current is in phase with the voltage. The cur-
rent in the capacitor leads the capacitor voltage by 90°.

The line current leads the total or line voltage by less than 90° depending on the
values of R and XC. As shown in Figures 5-2 and 5-3, the resistance and reactance must,
therefore, be added vectorially to arrive at the value of impedance.

38
Unit 5 Series Circuit: Resistance and Capacitance
The following calculation gives the same value of impedance as was obtained for
the inductive series circuit in Unit 4.
In this case, however, the current leads the voltage by 63.4° instead of lagging by
the same amount. Compare Figures 5-2 and 5-3. Note that the triangle is drawn below R
instead of above it. XL is in exact opposition to XC.
Vector Sum of Voltages
As shown in Figure 5-4, the voltages of each
device in the circuit may be added vectorially as in the
inductive series circuit. However, the vector diagram
will be in the same position as the triangle in Figure 5-3.
Phase Relationship
In Figure 5-5, the waveforms show that the cur-
rent leads the total voltage by 63.4° (using the values
in Figure 5-4).

Unit 5 Series Circuit: Resistance and Capacitance
SUMMARY
In a circuit containing resistance and capacitance, the combined opposition to the
establishment of current is called impedance, as was the case with resistance and induc-
tance. An RC circuit causes the current to lead the total voltage by an angle greater than
zero and less than 90°. If R is held constant, and a variable capacitor is used (Figure 5-7)
in a circuit, the angle of lead of current can be adjusted as necessary. Current can be
found by using Ohm’s law: total voltage divided by total impedance. The vector sum of
the voltage across the resistance and the voltage across the capacitive reactance is equal
to the total voltage in a series RC circuit.

SERIES CIRCUIT: RESISTANCE,
INDUCTANCE, AND CAPACITANCE
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• discuss the effects of a combination of resistance, inductance, and capacitance
connected in series.
• explain the relationships of voltage and current in a series RLC AC circuit.
• identify resonance in an AC series circuit.
RESISTANCE, INDUCTANCE, AND CAPACITANCE IN SERIES
An AC circuit may be inductive or capacitive. It may include a series combination
of resistance, inductance, and capacitance.
When the inductive reactance equals the capacitive reactance, a condition called res-
onance exists. Because capacitive reactance opposes inductive reactance, they can-
cel each other and, thus, the resistance of the circuit is the only opposition.
Three series circuits with different values of XL, XC, and R are analyzed in this unit.
Circuit A: XL Is Greater than XC
With the quantities drawn to scale, XL is twice as long as R, as shown in Figure 6-1.
The difference between a purely capacitive circuit as compared to a purely induc-
tive circuit is that the capacitive effect leads by 90°, whereas the inductive effect lags by
90°. Therefore, XC is shown opposite to XL in Figure 6-2.
In the series RLC circuit, the resistor is common to both the capacitor and the
inductor. The two diagrams shown in Figure 6-2 can be combined as shown in Figure 6-3.
With XL and XC located directly opposite each other, the total reactance is equal to the
difference of the two.
Because inductive reactance is greater than capacitive reactance, the net effect is that
of an inductive circuit containing 5-ohm resistance and 5-ohm inductive reactance. The
phase relationship between current and voltage is 45°. In the circuit shown in Figure 6-1,
the inductive reactance is greater than the capacitive reactance, and the net reactance is
inductive.

cuit in which XL is greater than XC. However, as shown in Figure 6-5, the reactance
is located below the resistance. The magnitude of impedance and the phase angle are
unchanged.
The major difference between the two circuits is that the current through the circuit
in Figure 6-4 leads the total voltage by 45°.

Determining Impedance
Total opposition or impedance in a resonant circuit is
equal to or limited to the resistance. As shown in Figure 6-7,
the angle between the total voltage and the current is zero. In
other words, the current of the circuit is in phase with the total
or line voltage.

As seen in Figure 6-8, the voltage necessary to cause a cur-
rent of 10 amperes to pass through this circuit is 50 volts instead
of 70.7 volts as required in the other two RLC series circuits.

Now the impedance can be found as follows:

Unit 6 Series Circuit: Resistance, Inductance, and Capacitance
SUMMARY
In a series RLC circuit, the total opposition to the establishment of current is called
impedance. However, in this type of circuit, the effects of inductive reactance and capac-
itive reactance tend to cancel each other. That is, the higher of the two reactances will
dominate and help to determine the circuit impedance. Resonance in a series RLC cir-
cuit occurs when the inductive reactance equals the capacitive reactance. Under this con-
dition, the total impedance equals the resistance in the circuit and is at a minimum.
Current, then, is at a maximum.

AC PARALLEL CIRCUITS 
CONTAINING INDUCTANCE
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• determine the current and voltage relationships in an alternating-current circuit
containing a resistor connected in parallel with an inductor.
• make a vector analysis for an RL parallel circuit.
INDUCTANCE IN PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Parallel circuits are more common than series circuits because of the parallel or
multiple system of energy transmission and distribution. It is not difficult to calculate the
total current of multiple circuits connected in parallel. Remember that the current is the
same in all parts of a series circuit. When the components of a series circuit are fixed
values of resistance or reactance, the current is regarded as the reference point.
In a parallel circuit, each individual branch is connected directly across the line
wires. Therefore, the voltage is the same across each branch of the circuit and, because
of this, it is regarded as a fixed value or reference point in parallel circuit calculations.
Circuit A: Resistors in Parallel
Both currents shown in Figure 7-1 are in phase with the voltage. The total current
may be determined by direct addition as in a DC circuit.
IT = I1 + I2 = 10 A
The total resistance can be calculated by dividing the total or line voltage by the
line current.
Circuit B: Resistor and Inductor in Parallel
The current in the resistive branch of the parallel circuit in Figure 7-2 is in phase
with the line voltage, and the current in the inductive branch lags the line voltage by 90°.

The two currents are out of phase with each other. Therefore, the total current is the vec-
tor sum of the two quantities.
The total current can be measured from a vector diagram drawn to scale, as shown

SUMMARY
In a parallel RL circuit, the total current is equal to the vector sum of the branch
currents. The voltage across each branch is the same, and equal to the source voltage.
The impedance of the circuit may be found by using Ohm’s law, that is, divide the total
voltage by the total current. As in a series RL circuit, the total current will lag the total
voltage.

AC PARALLEL CIRCUITS 
CONTAINING INDUCTANCE 
AND CAPACITANCE
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• determine the current and voltage relationships in an alternating-current circuit
containing resistance and capacitance in parallel.
• determine the current and voltage relationships in an alternating-current circuit
containing resistance, inductance, and capacitance in parallel.
• discuss what is meant by antiresonance when applied to an alternating-current
circuit containing resistance, inductive reactance, and capacitive reactance in
parallel.
Most industrial power distribution lines, as shown in Figure 8-1, have currents that
lag the voltage. To offset this condition, power companies may connect banks of capac-
itors in parallel with the load. In this unit, the first circuit considered has a resistor con-
nected in parallel with a capacitor. The second parallel circuit considered contains three
branches: resistance, inductance, and capacitance. When the inductive current is equal to
the capacitive current, a parallel resonance or antiresonance exists. This condition has a
very practical use in industrial applications.
RESISTANCE AND CAPACITIVE REACTANCE IN PARALLEL
When a resistive load, such as a heating or lighting load, is connected in parallel
with a capacitive reactance, certain voltage and current relationships result.
The current in the resistive branch in Figure 8-2 is in phase with the line voltage.
The current in the capacitive branch in Figure 8-3 leads the line voltage by 90°.
When the resistive and capacitive branches are combined into a parallel circuit, as
shown in Figure 8-4, the total or line current is equal to the vector sum (not the arith-
metic sum) of the currents taken by the individual branches. In other words, because the
two currents are out of phase with each other, they must be added vectorially.

Total current is equal to
For parallel circuits with unequal reactances where the capacitive current is greater
than the inductive current, the following is true:
Circuit C: Resonance in a Parallel Circuit (Antiresonance)
Resonance occurs in series circuits when the voltage across the inductance is equal
to the voltage across the capacitance. The circuit current is then in phase with the line volt-
age and, for a given value of resistance, the current in the circuit is at a maximum value.
In a parallel circuit, however, when the current in the inductive branch equals the
current in the capacitive branch, they cancel each other because the current through the
inductive branch is 180° out of phase with the current in the capacitive branch. As a
result, total current or line current is the current through the resistive branch only. When
this point is reached, the current is at a minimum value, as shown in Figure 8-9 and
Figure 8-10. The circuit is said to be in antiresonance in contrast to resonance and max-
imum current in a series circuit.
Note: When IL and IC are equal, they cancel each other and the line current is at a
minimum value. This is the antiresonance point.

Summary of Parallel Resonant Circuits
• The total or line current is equal to the current of the resistive branch and is at a
minimum value.
• Total impedance is equal to the resistance of the circuit.
• The line current is in phase with the line voltage.
Power circuits carry out-of-phase currents such as those existing in all motor instal-
lations for the average industrial plant. These currents usually lag the voltage because of
the inductive equipment. The values of these currents are much greater than the amount
required for a given amount of power.
Desired conditions exist when the currents are in phase with the voltage. The lag-
ging line current can be limited by connecting a capacitor or a bank of capacitors across
the lines or in parallel with the particular equipment in question. This operation is called
power factor correction.
SUMMARY
The parallel RC circuit is similar to the parallel RL circuit. Total impedance is
determined by dividing the total voltage by the total current. The voltage across each
branch is equal to the total voltage. Total current leads total voltage.

POWER FACTOR CORRECTION
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• calculate the power in an AC circuit.
• discuss what is meant by power factor.
• explain the concept and importance of power factor correction.
The power in a DC circuit is equal to the product of voltage and current. In anAC cir-
cuit, the voltage and current are seldom in phase, except in incandescent lighting circuits
and heating circuits. For most AC circuits then, the apparent power or product of voltage
and current must be multiplied by a power factor to determine the true or real power.

POWER IN AC RESISTIVE CIRCUITS

(see Figure 9-1).

Unit 9 AC Power, Power Factor, and Power Factor Correction
Power in the resistive
circuit in Figure 9-1 is P = E ×
I = 120 × 12 = 1,440 watts.
Examination of the voltage,
current, and power cycles in
Figure 9-2 shows the in-
phase relationship of current
and voltage. During the first
half of the cycle, the product
of the positive instantaneous
values of volts and amperes
results in a positive cycle of
power.
During the second half
of the cycle, the power is
the product of the negative
voltage and current values.
Because the product of any
two negative values gives a
plus quantity, the second
cycle of power is also posi-
tive. Figure 9-3 is a vector

equals a negative power wave.
During the second quarter of the
cycle, the P wave is positive, P = E ×
(+I). During one voltage cycle, two
positive and two negative half
cycles of power are produced. As
a result, the average power is zero.
In the vector diagram shown in
Figure 9-6, no part of the current
vector is in phase with the voltage.
The in-phase portion of the induc-
tive current is zero:

CIRCUITS
The circuit in Figure 9-7 gener-
ates the waveforms shown in Fig-
ure 9-8. As shown in Figure 9-8, the
current leads the voltage by 90°.
The average power is zero (see Fig-
ure 9-9). The conditions are the
same as in a pure inductive circuit,
with the exception that the current
leads the voltage by 90° instead of
lagging by the same amount.

RESISTANCE
Practically all motors, trans-
formers, relays, and other inductive
equipment have some resistance. As
a result, the current lags the voltage
by an angle less than 90°, depending
on the values of R and XL (see
Figure 9-10).

Unit 9 AC Power, Power Factor, and Power Factor Correction
In Figure 9-11, the shaded portion
of the power wave is negative. This
power portion increases as the phase
angle displacement of current and voltage
approaches 90°.
At 90° of current lag, as in pure
inductive and pure capacitive circuits, the
net power is zero. When current is in phase
with the voltage, as in resistance circuits,
the entire power wave is positive.
The vector diagram in Figure 9-12 shows the actual line current passing through the
impedance, such as in a motor, transformer, or relay.
The part of the current that is actually doing work or aiding the voltage can be
measured by drawing a perpendicular line from the 12-ampere vector. The in-phase cur-
rent value is 6 amperes.
The ratio,
, is called the cosine of the angle or the power factor (PF).
For Figure 9-12, the power factor is equal to 
and 
Power = E × I(in phase).

POWER IN ALL CIRCUITS CONTAINING A SINGLE SOURCE
Power in all circuits is a function of voltage, current, and power factor: 
P = Voltage × Current × Power Factor
= E × I × PF
P (Watts) = Volts × Amperes × PF
Circuit A: Pure Resistive Circuit (PF = 1)
P = 120 volts × 12 amperes × 1
= 1,440 watts
The in-phase current equals the line current.
Circuit B: Pure Capacitive or Pure Inductive Circuit (PF = 0)
P = 120 volts × 12 amperes × 0
= 0
There is no in-phase current.
POWER FACTOR
When all the current values shown in Figure 9-12 are multiplied by the voltage, the
result is a power diagram.
When line voltage and current are not in phase, the product of these two quan-
tities is not power, but apparent power (see Figure 9-13).
AP = Apparent Power = Eline Iline (power that appears to be in the line)

The units of true power are expressed in watts (W), while apparent power is
expressed in volt-amperes (VA).
The power factor can also be expressed in terms of apparent power.
P = True Power = (Eline × Iline) × (PF)
= (AP) × (PF)
Power factors are sometimes specified in percentages. To convert from a number to
a percent, multiply the number by 100.
POWER FACTOR CORRECTION
The ideal power transmission occurs when the current is in phase with the voltage
or when the power factor is 1. With this condition, a minimum amount of current is
required to deliver a given amount of power. If line current can be reduced, less current
needs to be generated to obtain the required results. This condition can be accomplished
by connecting a capacitor or bank of capacitors across the line or in parallel with the
inductive equipment, as shown in Figure 9-14.

Unit 9 AC Power, Power Factor, and Power Factor Correction
The size of the capacitor is determined from tables showing the relationship
between the power factor, load kVA, and capacitor kVA required for any desired new
power factor (see Figure 9-15).
Example: The size of a capacitor (VARs) required to raise the power factor of a
given load to a higher value can be found as follows:
Assume a 500-kVA load at a power factor of 0.6 or 60 percent. The true
power is 500 kVA × 0.6 = 300 kW.
Raising the power factor to 90 percent is desired. The capacitor kVA value required
to accomplish this is found by multiplying 300 kW by the factor taken from the table in
Figure 9-15, or 0.850. (Locate the original power factor of 60 in the first column of the
Figure 9-15  Power factor correction table.

80
Unit 9 AC Power, Power Factor, and Power Factor Correction
table, and locate the desired power factor of 90 at the top of the table. Go to the right
from 60 and down from 90 until the columns meet. This value, 0.850, is the correction
factor to be used in the calculation.) The capacitor required has a capability of 300 × 0.850
= 255 kVA.
Assume that the next higher standard capacitor rating is selected (300 kVA). What
is the value of the resulting correction factor?
Referring to Figure 9-15, and using the original power factor of 60 percent and a
correction factor of 1.00, the ultimate power factor is nearly 95 percent.
POWER MEASUREMENT
Power in AC circuits is measured with a wattmeter, shown in Figure 9-16. The
method of connecting the wattmeter into a circuit to measure power is shown in
Figure 9-17.

POWER FACTOR MEASUREMENT
The exterior of the power factor meter is identical to that of the wattmeter. The
connections, shown in Figures 9-18 and 9-19, are identical to those shown for the meas-
urement of power in an AC line.

AC ELECTRICAL ENERGY
The watt (W) is the unit for power, or the rate at which energy is used. This unit is
used for both direct- and alternating-current circuits.
The amount of energy used by a motor or the amount supplied to a branch line is
measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh). Therefore, energy = power × time; energy, not
power, is the quantity purchased from a utility company.
SUMMARY
The power in DC circuits is always a result of resistance. In AC circuits, power
determination is a bit more complex. Power is still a function of voltage and current, but
because the current alternates, so does the power. With resistance and reactance in a cir-
cuit, power calculations must involve a power factor. The power factor reflects that the
total current and total voltage are not in phase with one another. Apparent power is sim-
ply the product of current and voltage. When apparent power is multiplied by the power
factor, the true power is found. In a power distribution system, it is important to keep the
power factor as high as possible (the ideal is 1, or 100%). This tends to yield low energy
costs as compared to lower power factor circuits containing reactance.

INSTALLATION OF SINGLE-PHASE,
THREE-WIRE ENTRANCE FOR A
SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENCE
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• analyze the requirements of a single-family dwelling.
• determine the size of service-entrance conductors.
• select the proper material and demonstrate the proper methods for the service- 
entrance installation.
The service entrance for most contemporary lighting installations is a single-phase,
three-wire service, as shown in Figure 11-1.
The middle wire, called the neutral wire, is grounded. Therefore, this neutral wire
(grounded conductor) is the white wire of any single-phase, three-wire installation. The
two outside wires are known as the hot wires (conductors). The voltage between the neu-
tral wire and either of the two hot wires is 120 volts, and the voltage between the two

Having both 120 and 240 volts available is advantageous. Many types of loads,
such as electric water heaters, electric ranges, and fractional horsepower motors, oper-
ate on 240 volts.

Unit 11 Installation of Single-Phase, Three-Wire Entrance
A TYPICAL SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING
This unit presents the fundamental installation rules for a service entrance as they
concern the calculations that affect the service-entrance switch, service-entrance con-
ductors, and grounding. The branch circuits supplying the various items of electrical
equipment in a residence are covered briefly. The metering facilities for electrical space-
heating equipment as well as electric water heaters vary according to the requirements
of the local utility company. As a result, it is not possible to cover all these metering
methods in detail. The electrician must check the requirements for these installations
with the utility company serving the area in which the wiring is to be installed.
A typical application for a 120/240-volt, single-phase, three-wire service installation
is a single-family dwelling. The residence considered in this unit is a six-room house
(including three bedrooms) with an area of 1,500 square feet (1,500 ft2). The residence con-
tains a 3-kW water heater; a 5.0-kW clothes dryer; an 8-A, 240-V room air conditioner; a
dishwasher rated at 11.1 A, 120 V; a 4-kW wall-mounted oven; a 6-kW counter-mounted
cooking unit; a garbage disposal rated at 7.5A, 120 V; and 12 kW of electric space-heating
equipment installed for all six rooms. Each room has individual thermostatic control.
Determining the Number of Lighting Circuits
To determine the number of lighting circuits, the lighting load of the residence must
be calculated. The calculations are based on the volt-amperes per square foot method
outlined in the National Electrical Code® (referred to here as the Code®), Article 220. In
general, the outside dimensions of the building are used, not including open porches,
garages, or unfinished spaces. For the residence in question, the area is 1,500 square feet.
The recommended unit load is 3 volt-amperes per square foot.
Therefore, the total lighting load is
To determine the minimum number of 120-volt branch lighting circuits, begin with
the following:
In general, 15-ampere lighting circuits using No. 14 AWG conductors are installed
in residential occupancies. Some electrical specifications require a minimum conductor
size of No. 12 AWG on all circuits. Thus,
However, a residence of this type may have as many as 60 outlets, including ceiling
fixtures, porch fixtures, and wall convenience receptacles located throughout the living
area, basement, garage, and grounds. As a result, most electricians prefer to limit the

number of outlets per circuit to 8 or 10. This results in a larger, more adequate number
of lighting circuits. For the residence covered in this unit, at least 6 lighting circuits will
be installed even though the minimum number of circuits required is 3.
Determining the Number of Small Appliance and Laundry Circuits
The Code® specifies that for small appliances, an additional load of not less than
1,500 volt-amperes shall be included for each circuit for the receptacle outlets. These
circuits shall feed only receptacle outlets in the kitchen, pantry, dining room, and break-
fast room of a dwelling. Two or more 20-ampere branch circuits shall be provided, and
such circuits shall have no other outlets. The type of wire used is No. 12 AWG instead
of No. 14 AWG as required by the Code®. Thus, by using the larger wire, the perform-
ance of appliances is improved and the danger of overloading circuits is decreased.
Because automatic washing machines draw a large amount of current during cer-
tain portions of their operating cycles, the Code® requires installation of a separate 
20-ampere circuit for the laundry outlets. All convenience receptacles must be of the
grounding type.
To determine the service-entrance requirements of this dwelling, the small appli-
ance and laundry loads are 4,500 watts, based on three 20-ampere circuits at 1,500 volt-
amperes per circuit.
Garbage Disposal
The garbage disposal unit is rated at 7.5 amperes, 120 volts, and will be supplied
by a separate 15-ampere circuit that requires No. 14 AWG conductors.
The garbage disposal load is
Dishwasher
The dishwasher is rated at 11.1 amperes, 120 volts, and will be supplied by a sep-
arate 15-ampere circuit using No. 14 AWG wire.
The dishwasher load in volt-amperes is
Dryer Circuit
The electric clothes dryer is rated at 5.0 kW, 240 V. The current it draws is
240 volts
5,000 watts = 20.8 amperes
11.1 amperes × 120 volts = 1,332 volt-amperes
7.5 amperes × 120 volts = 900 volt-amperes

94
Unit 11 Installation of Single-Phase, Three-Wire Entrance
The circuit to the dryer will be a 30-ampere, 240-volt, three-wire circuit consisting
of two No. 10 AWG conductors for the hot wires and one No. 10 AWG conductor for the
neutral conductor.
Wall-Mounted Oven
The oven is rated at 4 kW, 120/240 V and will be connected to a separate circuit.
In watts, the load is 4,000 watts; in amperes, the load is equal to
No. 12 AWG wire can be used for this circuit.
Counter-Mounted Cooking Unit
The surface cooking unit is rated at 6 kW, 120/240 V. The unit will be connected to
a separate circuit consisting of three No. 10 AWG conductors supplied by a 30-ampere,
two-pole overcurrent device.
The load, in amperes, is
Air Conditioner
The air conditioner draws 8 amperes at 240 volts and will be connected to a sepa-
rate 15-ampere, 240-volt circuit with No. 14 AWG conductors (15 amperes).
The air conditioner load, is
Water Heater
Many utility companies furnish current for residential electric water heater loads
at a power consumption rate lower than the regular lighting rate. In such installations,
some utility companies require a separate off-peak meter, whereas other companies pre-
determine a fixed portion of the monthly light bill to cover the power consumption of
the water heater.
In general, for the off-peak metering circuit, the top element of the heater is con-
nected to a two-pole, 240-volt circuit supplied through the house meter. The bottom
element of the heater is connected to a two-pole, 240-volt circuit supplied through the
off-peak meter. These elements can be connected for limited demand, in which case both

elements cannot be energized simultaneously; or they may be connected for unlimited
demand, in which case both elements may be energized simultaneously. The types of
thermostats furnished with the water heater determine how the elements are connected.
Various types of equipment are available in which both regular and off-peak over-
current protective devices may be located in the same enclosure. The off-peak device is
called a feedthrough unit and is not connected in any manner to the main bus of the panel
even though it is located in the same enclosure. In the feedthrough unit, the two wires
from the off-peak meter are connected to one side of the unit, and the two wires supply-
ing the element of the water heater are connected to the other side.
The water heater in this residence is rated at 3 kW on the nameplate. This load, in
amperes, is equal to
The Code® requires the water heater rating of not less than 125% of the nameplate
(Article 422).
When connected for unlimited demand, the maximum current of this water heater
is 15.6 amperes.
Consult the local utility company for guidelines on the proper connection of water
heaters.
Electric Space Heating
The specified total of 12 kW of electric space-heating units will be installed through-
out the residence. Each of the six rooms will have a thermostat to provide individual heat-
ing control. According to the Code®, there must be four or more individually controlled,
electric space heating units to apply certain demand factors permitted by the Code®.
These factors are used to calculate the service-entrance capacity. Approximately 2 kW of
space heat will be provided in each room. Because these units are rated at 240 volts, the
load for each is
The branch-circuit current rating is 125 percent of the load, or 1.25 × 8.3 = 10.4
amperes. Therefore, each unit will be connected to a separate 15-ampere, 240-volt cir-
cuit using No. 14 AWG wire.
Some utility companies offer lower rates for electric heating when this is a residen-
tial requirement in addition to general electrical services. These rates usually are based
on special metering methods. The electrician should consult the utility company supply-
ing power in the locale for the correct method of connecting heating loads.
Branch circuits discussed thus far are summarized in Figure 11-2.

SIZE OF SERVICE-ENTRANCE CONDUCTORS
Section 230.42 of the Code® specifies that service-entrance conductors shall have
a current-carrying capacity sufficient to carry the load as determined by Article 220.
For dwelling occupancies, the Code® permits the use of either of two methods to
determine the size of these conductors.

Air conditioning is 8 × 240 = 1,920 volt-amperes. This value is less than the
12,000 volt-amperes of space heating; therefore, the air conditioner load need
not be included in the service calculation (Section 220.82).

Because there are four appliances in addition to the cooking units and space
heating, a demand factor of 75 percent may be applied to the fixed appliance
load (Section 220.53).
Thus, 10,457 × 0.75 = . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7,843 volt-amperes

According to Table 310.15(B)(6) of the Code®, for a load of 137.3 amperes, No. 1
RHW or THW wire may be installed as the copper service-entrance conductors.
Method 2 (Article 220, Part IV)
An optional method of determining the load of a single-family dwelling is recog-
nized by the Code® in Section 220.80. This method simplifies the calculations and
usually results in a smaller size of service entrance than is permitted by Method 1.

According to Table 310.15(B)(6) of the Code®, for a load of 89.1 amperes, No. 4
RHW wire or equivalent may be installed as the copper service-entrance conductors.
Both Methods 1 and 2 for determining total load are correct as far as the Code® is
concerned. Therefore, the decision as to which method is permitted in an area is made
by the local electrical inspector.
To provide a single panel that will accommodate all the circuits in the residence, it
is necessary to install a 200-ampere panel.
Certain localities require that the conductors supplying a panel or switch must
have a current-carrying capacity equal to the rating of the panel or switch. Therefore,
for the residence covered in this unit,
No. 2/0 RHW or equivalent wire
is required for the service entrance.
The installation of No. 2/0 RHW wire
or equivalent will give the home-
owner full 200-ampere capacity. See
Table 310.15(B)(6) of the Code®.
Service-Entrance Switch (Sections
230.70 and 230.71)
Section 230.71 of the Code®
specifies that the service disconnect-
ing means shall consist of not more
than six switches or six circuit break-
ers in a single enclosure, in a group of
separate enclosures, or in or on a
switchboard. The intent of this section
is to ensure that all electrical equip-
ment within a building can be discon-
nected with no more than six manual
operations. However, certain local
ordinances do not permit the six sub-
division rule, but rather require that

To accommodate the num-
ber of circuits listed in the branch
circuits summary (Figure 11-2),
a
200-ampere
panel
will
be
installed. This panel will contain
all the required branch circuits
plus a 200-ampere main pullout
in one enclosure. This type of
enclosure is acceptable as both
the load center and service equip-
ment, and meets Code® require-
ments in most localities.
Generally, the service switch
is located in the basement, and the
meter is mounted on the exterior
of the house for easy access by the
utility company.
Ground Connection
Section 250.20 of the Code®
requires the grounding of interior
alternating current systems where
the system can be grounded so
that the maximum voltage to ground on the ungrounded conductors does not exceed
150 volts. Grounding is accomplished by running a wire from the neutral connec-
tion in the main service switch or meter to the water piping system on the street
side of the water meter. The reason for connecting on the street side of the water meter
is so that the ground circuit remains connected if the meter must be removed for
repair.
Sections 250.62 through 250.92 set forth the rules governing grounding materials
and the installation of the ground wire. The size of ground wire required is found in
Table 250.66. As stated previously, the residence covered in this unit will be supplied
with No. 2/0 RHW service-entrance conductors. According to Table 250.66, No. 2/0
RHW conductors require a No. 4 AWG copper grounding conductor.
Illustrating all the methods of metering the water heater and electrical space heat-
ing load is beyond the scope of this unit. Figure 11-5, therefore, illustrates the entire
load connected to a single meter. This figure is used only to outline the installation
requirements.

Bonding
The proper bonding of all service-entrance equipment is as important as using the
proper size of service conductors. Section 250.92(A) lists the equipment that shall be
bonded, and Section 250.92(B) lists the methods approved for bonding this equipment.
Bonding jumpers shall have a current-carrying capacity not less than is required for the
corresponding grounding conductor.
The purpose of bonding on service-entrance equipment is to ensure a low imped-
ance path to ground should a fault occur on any of the service-entrance conductors.
Severe arcing, which presents a fire hazard, may occur at a fault. Proper bonding
reduces this hazard to some extent.
The fire hazard exists because the service-entrance conductors are not fused at
the service head. The short-circuit current on these conductors is limited only by the

SUMMARY
Consult the National Electrical Code® to obtain the latest requirements on single-
phase, three-wire, service-entrance installations. Residential circuits involve many
modern appliances. It is essential to know the ampere ratings of these appliances to
select the appropriate wire sizes. Branch circuit currents determine the service-entrance
requirements, including the service-entrance switch. The calculations must be accurate,
so double-check your work.

INSTALLATION OF A
SINGLE-PHASE, THREE-WIRE 
SERVICE ENTRANCE FOR AN
APARTMENT BUILDING
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• explain the connections for a single-phase, three-wire entrance for an apartment
building.
• compute the size of the subfeeders to individual apartments.
• compute the size of the service wires.
The construction of new apartment buildings and the conversion of older buildings
into apartment dwellings is a continuing trend in urban areas. It is often the job of the
electrician to install the single-phase, three-wire service entrance for an apartment build-
ing. The electrician must determine the size of the conductors and conduit for the ser-
vice entrance and the size of the subfeeders for each apartment.
In this unit, the problem is to install the service entrance for a building containing
20 apartments. Certain sections of this unit are similar to those of Unit 11.
APARTMENT BUILDING INSTALLATION
Assume that each of the 20 apartments in this building has a floor area of 800
square feet. Ten of these apartments have 9-kilowatt ranges.
The main single-phase, three-wire service will enter the building in the basement.
The main service-entrance switch and the individual meters for each of the 20 apart-
ments will be located in the basement. There will be individual feeders from each meter
to its respective apartment. A panel located in each apartment will serve as the distribu-
tion point for the individual branch lighting circuits, small appliance circuits, and the
range circuit.

Computation of the Load in Each Apartment Without a Range
Branch Lighting Circuits
The Code® specifies that the active area in square feet shall be computed from the
outside dimensions of the apartment, not including open porches, garages, or unfinished
spaces. The floor area of each apartment is known to be 800 square feet.
The general lighting load is determined by the volt-amperes per square foot method.
The total lighting load for each apartment is
To determine the number of 120-volt, two-wire branch lighting circuits, first calcu-
late the amperes:

The Code® specifies that in addition to the general lighting circuits, two or more
20-ampere branch circuits shall be provided for the outlets in the kitchen, pantry, dining
room, and breakfast room; and further, that such circuits shall supply no other outlets.
The required wire size for these circuits is No. 12 AWG.
For simplicity in the following calculations, it is assumed that there are no provi-
sions for laundry facilities in the apartment building. Therefore, an additional load will
not be added for laundry circuits. (If laundry facilities were to be provided, an addition-
al load of 1,500 volt-amperes per circuit would be required.)
Subfeeder
The Code® specifies that the load used to determine the size of subfeeder conduc-
tors shall be computed as follows:

Section 215.2 indicates that for a three-wire feeder supplying more than two two-
wire branch circuits, or two or more three-wire branch circuits, the feeder amperage shall
not be less than 30 amperes.
Therefore, the subfeeder to each of the 10 apartments that do not contain an elec-
tric range will consist of three No. 10 AWG copper conductors. Most electrical ordi-
nances require conduit for an installation such as this. Table C.1 in Annex C of the
Code® shows that three No. 10 TW conductors require 1/2-inch EMT conduit.
Summary
In the 10 apartments that do not have electric ranges, each will have
• One 120/240-volt, three-wire, single-phase subfeeder using No. 10 AWG wire
that will feed from the apartment’s disconnect in the basement to the load center
in the individual apartment.
• Two 120-volt, two-wire branch circuits for the lighting circuits. Generally, these
circuits are 15-ampere circuits using either No. 14 or No. 12 wire.
• Two 120-volt, 20-ampere, two-wire circuits using No. 12 wire for the small appli-
ance load.
Computation of the Load in Each Apartment with a Range
Each of the 10 apartments with electric ranges also has an active floor area of 800
square feet. The connected lighting and appliance load is the same for these apartments
as for the 10 apartments without electric ranges. The rating of each range in these apart-
ments is 9 kW.
Table 220.55 of the Code® indicates that for a single household electric range
rated at not over 12 kW, the maximum demand may be based on 8 kW (see Column C,
Table 220.55). This load in amperes follows:
Therefore, the two hot wires to the range outlet will be No. 8 TW. According to Sec-
tion 210.19(A)(3), Exception 2, the neutral conductor may be smaller than the ungrounded

conductors, but shall have not less than 70 percent of the current-carrying capacity of the
ungrounded conductors. No. 8 TW wire is rated at 40 amperes.
Therefore, the neutral conductor may be No. 10 TW wire (see Table 310.16).
When installing the range circuit in conduit, it is necessary to refer to the tables in
Chapter 9 of the Code®. When conductors of different sizes are installed in a conduit,
the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the conductors shall not exceed the allowable percent-
age of fill of the interior CSA of the conduit as shown in the tables.

Table 4 indicates that a 1/2-inch conduit will hold up to 0.12 in2 conductor fill and
a 3/4-inch conduit will hold up to 0.21 in2 conductor fill. In this installation, 3/4-inch
conduit will be installed for ease in pulling wires; however, the Code® permits 1/2-inch
conduit to be installed.

To summarize, three No. 6 TW conductors will be installed for each apartment.
According to Table C.1 in Annex C of the Code®, three No. 6 TW conductors require
3/4-inch conduit.
Summary
For each of the 10 apartments with electric ranges, there will be
• One 120/240-volt, three-wire, single-phase subfeeder using No. 6 TW wire that
will feed from the apartment’s disconnect in the basement to the load center in
the individual apartment.
• Two 120-volt, two-wire branch circuits for the lighting circuits. Generally, these
circuits are 15-ampere circuits using either No. 14 AWG or No. 12 AWG wire.
• Two 120-volt, 20-ampere, two-wire circuits using No. 12 AWG wire for the small
appliance load.
• One 120/240-volt, three-wire, single-phase circuit consisting of two No. 8 TW
ungrounded conductors and one No. 10 TW neutral conductor for the range.

SERVICE-ENTRANCE SWITCH
The requirements for the main service-entrance disconnecting means are contained
in Sections 230.70 through 230.82 of the Code®. These sections require that a readily
accessible means be provided to disconnect all ungrounded conductors in the building
from the service-entrance conductors. This disconnecting means shall indicate clearly
whether it is in the open or closed position; shall disconnect all ungrounded conductors
simultaneously; and shall have a rating of not less than the load to be carried in accor-
dance with Article 220. Generally, the overcurrent device shall not exceed the allowable
current-carrying capacity of the service-entrance conductors.
The main disconnect for this apartment will be a 400-ampere, three-wire, solid,
neutral, 250-volt switch fused at 300 amperes. See Sections 110.9 and 230.90 for inter-
rupting capacity requirements.
GROUNDING OF SERVICE EQUIPMENT
For service conductors over 3/0 AWG to 350,000 circular mils inclusive, the
required size of the grounding conductor is No. 2 AWG. If the grounding conductor is to
be installed in conduit, it may be installed in 1/2-inch conduit (Table C.1, Annex C).
Bonding requirements are found in Sections 250.90–250.102.
Figure 12-1 illustrates a typical service-entrance arrangement for an apartment
building. Note that the service-entrance conduit feeds into the main entrance switch
where the 300-ampere fuses are located. The switch is rated at 400 amperes.
Figure 12-1 also shows a short conduit nipple run from the main switch to an auxil-
iary gutter. The taps to each meter feed from the main conductors in the gutter. These

taps must be large enough to carry the load required for each subfeeder. For each of the
apartments without electric ranges, three No. 10 TW wires will be used. For the taps
feeding each of the apartments with electric ranges, three No. 6 TW wires will be used.
Overload protection for the subfeeders to each apartment is located in the discon-
nect switch above each meter. Each subfeeder is then run to the respective load centers
located in each of the 20 apartments. Branch-circuit protection in the load centers may
be in the form of breakers or fuses. If circuit breakers are used, they must conform to
Sections 240.80 through 240.85. If fuses are used, they must conform to Sections 240.50
through 240.61.
SUMMARY
The calculations for an apartment building installation are more complex than those
for a single-family dwelling because of the number of residential units involved. The
basic task is to take into account all loads. Make sure that your calculations are accurate.
The National Electrical Code® must be consulted for the latest information on this type
of installation.

INSTALLATION OF A
THREE-PHASE, THREE-WIRE 
SERVICE ENTRANCE
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• discuss the requirements for three-phase, three-wire service entrances not greater
than 100 amperes.
• diagram the connections for a typical three-phase, three-wire service entrance.
Most power utility companies require a three-phase service installation when the
connected motor load is in excess of 5 horsepower. Most three-phase motors with ratings
of 1 horsepower or larger are less expensive than single-phase motors of equal ratings.
Furthermore, a three-phase motor is easier to maintain than a single-phase motor. Single-
phase motors usually have a centrifugal switch or, in some cases, a commutator, and thus
require a great deal of maintenance. Three-phase motors have none of these devices to
adjust or repair. The operating performance of three-phase motors in terms of torque,
speed regulation, and efficiency is better than that of single-phase motors.
Industrial plants and other commercial facilities use a great many three-phase
motors. Because there must be three-phase service entrances to each of these installa-
tions, it is important that the electrician know the requirements for three-phase service
entrances.
PROCEDURE BEFORE STARTING WORK
Before starting work on three-phase installations, the electrician must give the
power company detailed information as to the connected horsepower load. The power
company will then specify the following:
• the location of the service entrance to the building and the location of the meter
board.
• the type and size of the meter test cabinet and test block.
• installation standards.

Unit 13 Installation of a Three-Phase, Three-Wire Service Entrance
INDUSTRIAL LOAD
The following example of a small industrial installation shows how to determine
the size of a three-phase, 230-volt service entrance. The load consists of two branch cir-
cuits each feeding one squirrel-cage induction motor rated at 230 volts, 15 amperes,
5 horsepower, with no Code® marking; and one branch circuit feeding a three-phase,
squirrel-cage induction motor rated at 230 volts, 21 amperes, 71/2 horsepower, with no
Code® marking. The full-load current for this motor is 22 amperes, as per Table 430.250
in the Code®.

117
Unit 13 Installation of a Three-Phase, Three-Wire Service Entrance
Size of Main Feeder
When conductors supply two or more motors, the Code® provides definite instruc-
tions for determining the feeder size. Section 430.24 specifies that the feeder shall have
a current capacity of not less than 125 percent of the full-load current rating of the high-
est rated motor in the group, plus the sum of the full-load current ratings of the remain-
der of the motors in the group.
The largest motor in the example in this unit is rated at 71/2 hp with a full-load
current rating of 22 amperes. Finding the total current in compliance with the Code®
ruling follows:
Therefore, the main feeder can be a No. 4 TW wire that can carry 70 amperes, or a
No. 6 RHW wire that can carry 65 amperes.
Size of Feeder Fuses (Short-Circuit and Ground Fault Protection)
Section 430.62(A) of the Code® specifies that a feeder which supplies motors shall
be provided with overcurrent protection. This overcurrent protection is determined by
taking the current rating of the branch motor circuit with the largest fuse rating, plus the
sum of the full-load currents to the other motors.
For this example, the branch circuit feeding the 71/2-hp motor has the largest fuse
rating.
Table 430.52 of the Code® gives the permissible factors to apply to the full-load
ratings of different types of motors to determine the branch-circuit protection. The factor
for three-phase, squirrel-cage induction motors without Code® markings is 175 percent
for time-delay fuses.
The branch circuit feeding the 71/2-hp motor will have the following fuse
protection:
Therefore, 40-ampere time-delay fuses and a 60-ampere switch can be used in this
branch circuit.
Section 430.32 specifies that the running overload shall not be more than 125 per-
cent of the nameplate current rating of the motor. The nameplate rating and the full-load
rating are different as per Code® Table 430.250. Thus, the overload heating units used
for running overload protection are rated at
125% of 21 = 1.25 × 21 = 26.25 amperes
175% of 22 amperes = 1.75 × 22 = 38.5 amperes
125% of 22 = 1.25 × 22 = 27.5 amperes
Then, 27.5 + 15 + 15 = 57.5 amperes

118
Unit 13 Installation of a Three-Phase, Three-Wire Service Entrance
Section 430.22(A) specifies that a branch circuit feeding an individual motor shall
have conductors with a current capacity of not less than 125 percent of the full-load cur-
rent rating of the motor. The wire size of the branch circuit for the 71/2-hp motor is
determined as follows:
Therefore, a No. 10 AWG wire can be used, as verified in Table 310.16. The size
of the fuses for the feeder may now be found by adding
This means that 70-ampere time-delay fuses can be used. Section 240.20 requires
that overcurrent devices be placed in each ungrounded conductor. If the utility company
supplies three-phase current with one phase grounded, a three-wire (solid neutral), two-
fuse disconnect switch must be installed. When all three phases are ungrounded, a three-
pole, three-fuse disconnect switch must be installed.
If additional equipment is to be installed, 100-ampere time-delay fuses may be
installed.
Three-Phase Entrance Switch (Sections 230.70 through 230.82)
Section 230.70 of the Code® requires each service entrance to be provided with a
readily accessible means of disconnecting all conductors from the source. This may be
either a manually operated switch or a circuit breaker. In this installation, a service-
entrance switch is used.
Energized parts of service equipment shall be enclosed as specified in 230.62(A) or
guarded as specified in 230.62(B).
• Enclosed. Energized parts shall be enclosed so that they will not be exposed to
accidental contact or shall be guarded.
• Guarded. Energized parts that are not enclosed shall be installed on a switch-
board, panelboard, or control board and guarded in accordance with 110.18 and
110.27. Where energized parts are guarded as provided in 110.27(A)(1) and (2), a
means for locking or sealing doors providing access to energized parts shall be
provided.
Furthermore, according to Section 230.77, this service-entrance switch must
plainly indicate both the open and closed positions.
Three 70-ampere time-delay cartridge fuses may be used with a 100-ampere, three-
pole, three-phase service-entrance switch.
Power companies in different localities have their own rules regarding the installa-
tion of the service switch. Some power companies require the service-entrance switch to
be connected on the supply side of the meter. Other companies require the connection of
the service-entrance switch on the load side of the meter.
40 + 15 + 15 = 70 amperes
125% of 22 = 27.5 amperes

Meter Test Cabinet
Figure 13-2 shows a typical connection arrangement for a meter test cabinet on a
three-phase, three-wire, 240-volt service entrance.
A special meter test cabinet, called the meter socket box, is used for three-phase,
three-wire service entrances up to and including 100 amperes. This cabinet is furnished
by the power company or the owner. The electrician is responsible for installing the cab-
inet and connecting the supply wires and load wires at the test block. After the installa-
tion is complete and approved by the electrical inspector, the power company installs the
watt-hour meter and makes the necessary connections between the meter and the test
block. A meter socket box is shown in Figure 13-3.
Although power companies vary in their requirements, all companies require elec-
tricians to meet some general specifications in their installations. Most of the time,
meters are installed outdoors, although some jobs call for the location to be inside. A
meter board must be installed for each indoor location. The meter board must be securely
mounted in a true vertical position. For three-phase installations, there must be 36 inches
of clear space for meter mounting above the meter test cabinet. If the meter board is
located in a basement, the 36-inch clear space must be completely below the lower edge
of any floor joists or other supports. At least 6 inches of clear space must be provided on
all sides of the meter test cabinet. The top of the meter should be not less than 4 feet nor
more than 6 feet from the floor.
Figure 13-4 illustrates the example provided in this unit of a typical three-phase
service installation. The service entrance is on the left and feeds into the meter entrance
cabinet. The cabinet contains a three-phase watt-hour meter that records the energy in
kilowatt-hours. To the right of the meter entrance cabinet is the service-entrance switch.
This three-pole switch is rated at 100 amperes, 240 volts, and is complete with 70-ampere
cartridge fuses. From the service-entrance switch, the feeder goes to the distribution box

that contains the branch-circuit protection. From the distribution box, the three branch cir-
cuits feed to the two 5-hp and one 71/2-hp motors in rigid conduit.
Three-Phase Watt-Hour Meter
The three-phase watt-hour meter, shown in
Figure 13-5, is really two single-phase watt-hour
meters mounted in the same case. Each single-phase
unit has a separate voltage coil, current coil, and
disk. The disk turns or revolves between the current
coil and the voltage coil. The disks of the two single-
phase units are mounted on the same disk shaft, and
the total energy of the single-phase units is recorded
in kilowatt-hours on the gear register.
The interconnection of these two single-phase
units to record three-phase energy is exactly the
same as that of two single-phase wattmeters being
used to record three-phase power on a three-phase,
three-wire system.
SUMMARY
The installation of power in industrial settings may involve various types of motors.
Therefore, care must be taken in making the calculations that determine the loads
because the load determines the size of the main feeder to install, as well as the feeder
fuses. Consult several sections of the National Electrical Code® for proper installation
of a three-phase, three-wire service entrance.

INTRODUCTION TO 
FLUORESCENT LIGHTING
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• explain the basic operating characteristics of fluorescent lighting units.
• list the basic circuit components for a simple one-tube fluorescent lighting unit of
the preheat type.
• state what power factor conditions are caused by fluorescent lighting units.
ADVANTAGES OF FLUORESCENT LAMPS
Fluorescent lamps are used in large quantities for various installations. Because of
its tubular form, the fluorescent lamp is called a tube. Fluorescent lamps range in length
from 6 inches to 96 inches and have wattage ratings from 4 watts to 215 watts.
Fluorescent lighting has several advantages:
• The wattage rating of a fluorescent unit of equivalent output in lumens is consider-
ably less than that of the ordinary incandescent filament-type lamp. Two to four
times as much light is produced per watt of power with a fluorescent unit as com-
pared to the standard incandescent lightbulb.
• Greater light output from a given circuit can be obtained without rewiring with
larger size conductors if standard lightbulbs are replaced with fluorescent units.
• The amount of heat given off by fluorescent lighting units is considerably less
than that given off by incandescent lightbulbs. This is an important factor to con-
sider when lighting air-conditioned buildings.
• The fluorescent unit has a low surface brightness. The fluorescent lamp or tube is
not bright in one spot because the total light delivered by the tube is not depend-
ent on a small area of extreme brightness, but on a large area of relatively low
brightness. The result is better light distribution with fewer shadows and less
eyestrain.
• Fluorescent lamps have a long life, and are available in various sizes, shapes, and
colors.

Unit 14 Introduction to Fluorescent Lighting
FLUORESCENT TUBES OF THE PREHEAT TYPE
The preheat lamp is the earliest form of fluorescent lighting. Because this type of
lamp is still in use to some extent, the electrician must understand how it functions,
along with the related circuitry.
In the preheat type of lamp, each end of the fluorescent tube contains a cap with
two terminals. Each set of two terminals or pins connects to a specially treated tungsten
filament. The tube contains two filaments, with one inside each end. The tube itself is
filled with an inert gas and a small amount of mercury. Argon and argon-neon are com-
monly used gases, and krypton is used sometimes. The inside of the glass tube is coated
with a chemical powder that will glow or fluoresce brightly when a current passes
through the tube. By changing the mixture of the chemical powder, light of almost any
color can be produced.
The details of the filament or cathode, the anode, and the terminals or pins are illus-
trated in Figure 14-1.

Basic Circuit for a Preheat-Type Fluorescent Tube
The connections for a fluorescent light unit consisting of one 15-watt, 120-volt, 18-inch
tube are shown in Figure 14-2. This tube requires special control equipment consisting
of a ballast (series reactor) and a starting switch. The series reactor acts as a current-
limiting device. The starting switch momentarily closes and opens the electrode heating
circuit. This switch is also called a glow tube, glow switch, and starter.
When the circuit in Figure 14-2 is energized, a small current passes through the
series reactor, both tube filaments, and the glow tube. At the instant the circuit is ener-
gized, the current is very small because of the high resistance of the glow tube. The
glow tube is a glass bulb or envelope filled with neon or argon gas. The tube also con-
tains a U-shaped bimetallic strip, a 0.006-microfarad capacitor, and a fixed contact or
electrode. The capacitor eliminates any radio interference that may be caused by the
opening and closing of the contacts. The contacts are open at the instant the circuit is
energized.

127
Unit 14 Introduction to Fluorescent Lighting
Because of the high resistance of the glow tube, the current is small and there is lit-
tle voltage drop across the series reactor. Therefore, there is sufficient voltage at the glow
tube to produce a glow discharge between the U-shaped bimetallic strip and the fixed con-
tact, as shown in Figure 14-3. The heat from the glow causes the bimetallic strip to expand
and close the contacts. Preheating takes place at both cathodes. The current through the
two filaments is relatively high, but the series reactor limits the current to a safe value.
During the period that the contacts of the glow tube are closed, the temperature of the flu-
orescent tube electrodes rapidly increases. However, when the contacts close in the glow
tube, the glow discharge is stopped, the bimetallic U-strip cools, and the contacts open.
At the instant these contacts open, an inductive voltage kick generated by the series reac-
tor coil starts conduction of current between the main electrodes of the fluorescent tube.

Unit 14 Introduction to Fluorescent Lighting
The fluorescent lamp continues to operate as long as the circuit is energized. The
usual operating voltage for satisfactory operation is 110 to 125 volts AC. After the cir-
cuit is in operation, the reactor limits the current to the rated value so that the fluores-
cent tube fluoresces at the proper light intensity.
Power Factor Correction
The reactor or voltage ballast in series with the fluorescent tube causes the power
factor of fluorescent units to range from a 50- to 60-percent lag. Power companies, there-
fore, have requested that fluorescent lamp manufacturers install capacitors in fluorescent
lighting fixtures to achieve power factor correction. Most fluorescent lighting units have
such a capacitor connected in the lamp circuit so that the operating power factor of most
fluorescent lamp units is near 100 percent or unity.
The fluorescent tube circuit shown in Figure 14-4 represents a circuit often used for
desk-type fluorescent lamps. A specially designed manual starting switch is used in this
circuit. This switch has two functions:
1. When the ON pushbutton is depressed for a second or two and then released, the
filament cathodes of the fluorescent tube are preheated.
2. Pressure on the ON pushbutton also closes contacts in the line wires. These con-
tacts mechanically lock in the closed position. Pressure on the OFF pushbutton
opens the contacts in the line wires to shut off the fluorescent lamp unit.
The two 14-watt fluorescent lamps shown in Figure 14-4 are in series. A special
small incandescent lamp is used instead of the traditional series reactor. This ballast lamp
works very well as a current-limiting device. By using the ballast lamp instead of the
typical series reactor coil, a fluorescent lamp unit has the following advantages: lower

microfarad capacitors eliminate any radio interference that may be caused by opening
and closing the manual switch contacts.
SUMMARY
Using flourescent lighting has several advantages over standard incandescent light-
bulbs: They have a longer life, are less costly to operate, give off less heat, and provide
more light per watt. A basic type of flourescent lamp is the preheat type. This lamp is
used in desk lamps, circular lamps around magnifying glasses, and in other low-cost
installations.

INSTALLATION OF FLUORESCENT
LIGHTING
OBJECTIVES
After studying this unit, the student should be able to
• discuss the connections and operation of a few simple circuits used with preheat
fluorescent lamps.
• describe how an instant-start fluorescent lamp operates and how it is connected in
a circuit.
• explain the operation of a rapid-start fluorescent lamp.
• explain some of the maintenance problems and failures common to fluorescent
lighting units. The electrician is often required to locate and correct various
problems in fluorescent lighting units. Faults can be quickly located and corrected
if the basic principles of circuit operation are kept in mind. This unit covers some
of the faults and failures common to fluorescent lighting units.
Part of this unit covers the circuits, control equipment, and operation of preheat flu-
orescent lamps. This unit also explains how to correct the power factor and eliminate the
stroboscopic effect in these fluorescent fixtures.
The instant-start fluorescent lamp was developed to overcome the delayed lighting
that occurs with preheat units. Due to the wide use of instant-start units, it is important
that the electrician be familiar with this type of lighting. Therefore, information is pro-
vided in this unit on the construction, circuit connections, and operation of instant-start
fluorescent lighting units.
The rapid-start lamp is the most recent development in fluorescent lighting. This
unit lights faster than the preheat type, but not as fast as the instant-start type. However,
the ballast is more efficient and smaller for a given amount of wattage, than the instant-
start lamp. The rapid-start lamp has low-resistance cathodes that are heated with low
power losses. Rapid-start lamps are the most popular type of fluorescent fixtures for new
installations. An important feature of this type of lamp is that it can be used in dimming
circuits.

PREHEAT FLOURESCENT LAMPS
Single Lamp with Autotransformer Ballast
When the rated wattage of preheat fluorescent lamps is greater than 20 watts,
there is a marked increase in the length of the fluorescent tube as shown in the fol-
lowing table:
Tube wattage
Length of tube
15 watts
18 inches
20 watts
24 inches
30 watts
36 inches
40 watts
48 inches
100 watts
60 inches
With 30-watt and larger flu-
orescent tubes, the typical lighting
voltage value of between 110 and
125 volts is too low to cause con-
duction. The voltage must be
stepped up to a value high enough
to start conduction. The method
used is an autotransformer-type
voltage ballast. An illustration of
this type of ballast connected to a
30-watt preheat fluorescent tube is
shown in Figure 15-1.
The 120-volt input is applied to the section of the coil fed by the black and white
line wires. The other section of the coil steps up the voltage output to the tube so that the
tube starts conducting at the end of the preheat period. After the tube is operating, this
section of the ballast acts as a series reactor to limit the current to the rated value.
Two-Lamp Circuits for Preheat Fluorescent Tubes
The circuit connections for fluorescent lighting fixtures with two 15- or 20-watt
tubes of the preheat type are illustrated in Figure 15-2. The fluorescent tube marked “Tube
No. 1” is in series with a reactor across the 120-volt source. The circuit for this tube is the
same as the circuit for one tube covered in the previous unit. The starter switch marked
“S” is a typical glow switch and is used to control the preheating of the lamp filaments of
Tube No. 1. The reactor coil for Tube No. 1 is connected to the fluorescent tube by the
blue conductor. The reactor coil for Tube No. 1 has a large value of inductive reactance.
The second lamp, which is marked “Tube No. 2,” is connected in series with a bal-
last consisting of a reactor coil and a capacitor. The connection between this second lamp

and the ballast is made with a red wire. The path from the other side of Tube No. 2 to
the black line lead completes the circuit. The use of the capacitor in series with the reac-
tor coil of Tube No. 2 results in the current of this tube being as much as 90 to 120 elec-
trical degrees out of phase with the current in Tube No. 1. Because of this, the follow-
ing is true:
• The overall power factor is 95 percent or higher for the two lamps in parallel.
• The stroboscopic effect is reduced considerably because of the phase displace-
ment between the currents of the two lamps.
The capacitor in series with the reactor coil for Tube No. 2 limits the inductive volt-
age kick of the coil. To start the tube, a compensating winding is used. The compensat-
ing coil is connected in series with the glow switch of this second tube by the black and
yellow leads. The compensating coil provides the necessary additional inductive voltage
kick to cause the second tube to start.
The circuit connections for fluorescent lighting fixtures having two 30-, 40-, or 100-
watt preheat tubes are shown in Figure 15-3. The ballast used in Figure 15-3 has an auto-
transformer to step up the line voltage. Wound on the same core with the autotransformer
winding are the two reactor coils and a compensating coil. The autotransformer is neces-
sary for the operation of 30-watt and larger fluorescent tubes.

Figure 15-4 illustrates the actual physical arrangement of the ballast for the circuit
in Figure 15-3. The circuit using large-capacity lamps operates in the same manner as
the two-lamp circuit for 15- and 20-watt fluorescent lamps, and it has the same desirable
characteristics of high power factor and the reduction of stroboscopic effects.
INSTANT-START SLIMLINE FLUORESCENT LAMPS
The slimline fluorescent lamp, designed for instant starting, has only one terminal
at each end. As in the preheat tube, the slimline lamp has a filament type of cathode and
operates as a hot-cathode lamp. The current passing between the two electrodes heats
the segments of the small wire filaments to a red-hot temperature in a fraction of a sec-
ond. The slimline lamp starts without preheating by using sufficient starting voltage.
Therefore, the need for separate starters is eliminated.
Figure 15-5 illustrates the construction of the filament-type cathode and single ter-
minal pin used on instant-start, slimline fluorescent lamps. This type of construction

results in lower electrode losses. The other
details of construction for instant-start flu-
orescent tubes are the same as for preheat
fluorescent tubes, with the exception that
the diameter of instant-start tubes is slightly
smaller than that of preheat fluorescent
tubes. (This characteristic promoted the use
of the term “slimline.”)
Circuit for Instant-Start Slimline Fluorescent Lamps
Figure 15-6 illustrates the connections for a circuit used to operate two instant-start,
slimline fluorescent lamps. The ballast used with this circuit is designed to
• deliver a high starting voltage at the instant the circuit is energized to start the
lamps without preheating.
• deliver a normal operating voltage after the lamps are in operation.
When two-lamp slimline circuits were first developed, they were of the lead-lag
configuration with the lamps in parallel. Modern circuitry has the two lamps in series,
as shown in Figure 15-7, and the ballast is designed to start the lamps in very rapid

sequence. This type of circuitry results in a smaller ballast, reduced cost, and lower
sound level. The use of instant-start circuits has the following benefits:
• The resultant power factor for the two-lamp unit is 95 percent or higher.
• The phase displacement between the currents in the two lamps reduces strobo-
scopic effects.
• This type of lighting unit starts the instant the circuit is energized.

RAPID-START FLUORESCENT LAMPS
The rapid-start lamp is widely used in modern installations. The cathodes are heat-
ed continuously, and the lamp is illuminated very quickly after the circuit is energized.
The rapid-start lamp can be used in dimming and flashing circuits. Certain types of
rapid-start lamps work very well in former preheat systems. A rapid-start lamp can be
obtained for almost any type of weather condition. Figure 15-8 illustrates a fundamental
rapid-start circuit. The ballast has separate windings to heat the cathodes continuously.
Therefore, when the lighting switch is placed in the ON position, the lamps light very
quickly, and no flicker occurs.
Because the cathodes are
already heated, the amount of
voltage required to cause the lamp
to fluoresce is smaller than that
required for the instant-start lamp.
As a result, the rapid-start system
is very efficient because of the
small amount of loss in the ballast.
Figure 15-9 shows a typical
circuit for two rapid-start lamps.
It is a commonly used series cir-
cuit. After “Lamp 1” is on, the
voltage across it drops to a low
value, and nearly all the ballast
voltage appears across “Lamp 2.”
The starting voltage for this sys-
tem is only a few volts higher
than the voltage required to start
one lamp. The result is that the
size of the ballast can be small. In
the rapid-start system, as in the
instant-start system, there is no
need for the separate starter and
starter socket required in the pre-
heat system.
GENERAL INFORMATION ON FLUORESCENT LAMP MAINTENANCE
To secure the best performance of fluorescent lamps, it is important that the user
understand how to properly maintain the installation. Certain factors affect the perform-
ance of fluorescent lamps that are not encountered with incandescent filament lamps.
Some of these factors are within the control of the user.

Unit 15 Installation of Fluorescent Lighting
To achieve maximum lamp life, it is suggested that lamps be operated continuously
for periods of 3 to 4 hours. When a lamp is turned on and off frequently, the lamp life
is decreased considerably. The filament cathode at each end of a fluorescent lamp is
coated with a material from which there is an electrical emission when the unit is in oper-
ation. The material usually applied to the filament cathodes is a compound of barium or
strontium. This material is gradually used up during the operation of the lamp and is con-
sumed very rapidly during starting. The average life of most fluorescent lamps is in the
range of 5,000 to 20,000 hours, based on an operating period of 3 hours per start in lab-
oratory conditions. Lamp life generally increases when the lamp is operated for even
longer periods of time.
Another point to consider is the temperature of the room in which fluorescent
units are used. For satisfactory operation, the room temperature should be not less than
50 degrees Fahrenheit (50°F). If it is necessary to operate below 50ºF, special fluorescent
lamps can be obtained for use in low temperatures.
For preheat units, it is important that the correct starter be used. Unsatisfactory
operation, consisting of extremely slow starting or flickering of the lamp unit, will result
if the wrong type of starter is used. In some cases, the lamp unit may not even operate.
Fluorescent lamp units must be used with an alternating-current supply of the cor-
rect voltage and frequency. Check the specifications of the fluorescent lamp unit to
ensure that they are of the proper voltage and frequency rating. Also, check the type of
ballast used with the fluorescent lighting unit. Be sure that the ballast has the correct cat-
alog or type number specified for the fluorescent lamp unit to be used.
Starting Difficulties
A fluorescent lamp may be difficult to start for a number of reasons. Any difficul-
ty in starting results in shorter lamp life. One common starting difficulty is that the lamp
may blink on and off. This may mean that the lamp is at its normal point of failure.
However, if the lamp is new or if it has been in service only a short time, a number of
factors may be causing this condition. The difficulty may be due to the starter, which can
be replaced readily. The lamp itself may be at fault. Check the lamp in another fluorescent
fixture of the same size to determine whether the lamp is defective. Low circuit voltage,
incorrect ballast rating, and low temperature also may cause the lamp to blink on and off.
If a two-lamp fluorescent fixture is used, the individual starter leads from the two pairs
of lamp holders might have been crossed. In this case, one lamp will start while the other
lamp may blink on and off, or may not start at all. This sort of trouble can be located by
simply removing one of the lamps from the lamp holders. With one lamp removed, the
other will not start.
Another common starting problem is that the lamp makes no starting effort or starts
very slowly. Be sure that the lamp makes proper contact in the lamp holders. The lamp
can be checked by testing it in another circuit, as there may be an open circuit in the lamp

filament. It is also possible that the starter has become defective and should be replaced.
If necessary, a voltage check can be made with a voltmeter. If no voltage indication can
be found, check the circuit connections, including the circuit leads to the lamp holders.
There is also a remote possibility that the voltage ballast may be open circuited.
Lamp Appearance
At the end of a normal life period, a fluorescent lamp usually shows a dense black-
ening at either or both ends of the tube. Little indication of blackening should occur dur-
ing the first 500 to 1,000 hours of operation. When there is heavy end blackening dur-
ing the first 1,000 hours of operation, the active material in the filament cathodes is
being used too rapidly. This may be caused by one or more of the following factors:
• Frequent starting of fluorescent lamp units.
• Starters operating improperly, causing either too short or too long a preheat period.
• Improper ballasts that do not meet specification requirements.
• Circuit voltage being too low or too high. For best results, the circuit voltage
should be within the rating of the fluorescent fixture unit.
• Improper wiring of the fluorescent fixture unit.
SUMMARY
A variety of fluorescent lamps are used in numerous industrial settings. The advan-
tages of fluorescent lamps far outweigh those of the standard lightbulbs used in the
home. It is important to understand how fluorescent lamps work, and how to maintain
them. For example, the life of a fluorescent lamp will be diminished if it is turned on and
off frequently. From a preventive maintenance perspective, it is useful to know the signs
of pending lamp failure, so that the lamp can be replaced before it becomes a problem.

SUMMARY REVIEW 
OF UNITS 11–15
OBJECTIVE
• To evaluate the knowledge and understanding acquired in the study of the previ-
ous five units.
POINTS TO REMEMBER
• To determine the number of residential lighting circuits, the volt-amperes per
