Preface
For students taking a full-year introductory economics course, Principles of Economics in 
Context lays out the principles of economics in a manner that is thorough, up to date, and 
highly readable. Whether students take this class simply to gain some understanding of how 
economics can be useful to them, or go on to further studies in economics or business, this book 
will equip them with the tools and the critical understanding that they need to succeed. 
Principles of Economics in Context stands apart both for its emphasis on real-world 
context and for its affordable price. Core economic models are presented with reference 
to key contemporary issues such as equity (especially income distribution), environmental 
sustainability, rational behavior (how realistic is “Economic Man”?), and history (path 
dependence and the impact of past choices on present choices). It introduces students both to 
the standard topics and tools taught in most introductory courses and to a broader and richer 
set of topics and tools to deepen comprehension of the economic realities of the twenty-ﬁrst 
century.
This textbook is written to encourage engaged and critical thinking about topics in 
economics. While demonstrating the uses of economic theory, it also provides a variety of 
viewpoints. Woven throughout the book are themes of great importance in everyday life as 
well as for an understanding of the economy. There is a full treatment of standard neoclassical 
market theory and related topics, but the text also integrates discussion of history, institutions, 
gender, ethics, ecology, and inequality throughout the book. Within the broad themes of 
social and environmental well-being and sustainability, attention is repeatedly given to 
globalization, poverty and inequality, unpaid work, technology, and the environment as well 
as the ﬁnancialization of the economy, the Great Recession, and its aftermath. 
The text is priced at $99.95, much cheaper than most competitors, and available at an 
even lower price if purchased on-line. The price will not rise over the life of this edition. The 
text is also available as an E-book for $60 or less. The microeconomic and macroeconomic 
subject matter in Principles of Economics in Context is also available in two single-semester 
texts, Macroeconomics in Context (2nd ed.) and Microeconomics in Context (3rd ed.), also 
published by M.E. Sharpe and priced at $59.95 (cheaper on-line).
On pages xxv–xxviii you will ﬁnd several possible course plans based on different emphases 
(such as ecological, global, human development, and structural). We hope that this will help 
in planning the course that will best suit the needs of instructors and students.
WHAT MAKES THIS BOOK DIFFERENT FROM OTHER TEXTS?
This text covers the traditional topics included in most economics texts but treats them from 
a broader, more holistic perspective. The following chapter-by-chapter synopsis shows how 
this book manages both to be “similar enough” to ﬁt into a standard curriculum and “different 
enough” to respond to commonly expressed needs and dissatisfactions.

PREFACE
Chapter 0, “Economics and Well-Being” presents graphically illustrated data on 34 
variables, including data for the United States as well as international comparisons, using a 
selected set of countries. The related website www.gdae.org/principles allows users to see 
the same variables listed in order for all countries in the world where such data are available. 
The variables have been selected for intrinsic interest as well as relevance to the material in 
the rest of the book. This chapter is an innovation that teachers and students may choose to 
use in a variety of ways, including as an introduction to later topics, as a reference for use 
with other chapters, or as material to draw on in designing research projects.
Chapter 1, “Economic Activity in Context” presents standard economic topics such as 
the economic goals of living standards and stability—for the present and the future. These 
subjects are placed in a broader context of concern for well-being. The well-being goals of 
economics are deﬁned as (1) improvement in living standards, (2) stability and security, and 
(3) ﬁnancial, social, and ecological sustainability. Most textbooks discuss three essential 
activities—production, distribution, and consumption—but we add the activity of “resource 
maintenance” to draw attention to the importance of maintaining capital stocks, including 
stocks of natural (environmental) capital. The difference between stocks and ﬂows is explained, 
and basic concepts of abundance, scarcity, tradeoffs, and opportunity costs are introduced 
and illustrated with production possibility curve analysis. 
Chapter 2, “Useful Tools and Concepts” introduces standard concepts of economic 
modeling, efﬁciency, scarcity, and circular ﬂow. It includes a review of graphing techniques 
and the use of empirical data. In addition to the usual economic “circular ﬂow” diagram, this 
chapter presents an image of economic activity as embedded in social and physical contexts 
and relates this approach to issues of economic concern.
Chapter 3, “Markets and Society” discusses the institutional requirements of markets 
and introduces the concepts of externalities, public goods, market power, transaction costs, 
information and expectations, and concern for human needs and equity. The early introduction 
of these topics allows us to demonstrate why markets, while useful, are not on their own 
sufﬁcient for organizing economic life in the service of well-being. 
Chapter 4, “Supply and Demand” includes basic supply and demand analysis, including 
the slopes of supply and demand curves, factors that shift the curves, equilibrium and market 
adjustment, and the signaling and rationing functions of prices. Unlike many books that 
present equilibrium analysis as “the way the world works,” we explicitly introduce supply and 
demand analysis as a tool whose purpose is to help a person disentangle the effects of various 
factors on real-world prices and quantities. Rather than concentrating solely on the efﬁciency 
effects of markets, the contextual approach demands that distributional consequences and 
power issues also be raised. 
Chapter 5, “Elasticity” presents deﬁnitions and discussions of price elasticities of demand 
and supply, income elasticity of demand, and the income and substitution effects of a price 
change. 
Chapter 6, “Welfare Analysis” presents standard welfare analysis, including the 
topics of consumer and producer surplus. It also includes a careful look at different 
ways of understanding efﬁciency. Consideration of what is efﬁcient—and for whom—is 
followed by a ﬁrst look at policy conclusions that have been drawn from this approach, 
and a ﬁrst look at the requirements for “market perfection” that underlie traditional 
welfare analysis.
Chapter 7, “International Trade and Trade Policy” covers the gains-from-trade story that 
is now so important in discussing topical issues of global commerce. (The formal theory of 
comparative advantage and the gains from trade is spelled out in the appendix to the chapter.) 
We also discuss some possible negative impacts of trade as they may affect both developed 
and developing countries, and put these in the context of the globalized world, as it differs 
from the historical example of trade between England and Portugal. 

 
PREFACE

Chapter 8, “Economic Behavior and Rationality” elaborates on the topics of individual 
choice, rationality, and self-interest. It updates and ampliﬁes standard expositions, drawing on 
studies of human economic behavior by scholars such as Herbert Simon and Daniel Kahneman, 
and introduces issues of organizational structure and behavior. The result is a richer picture 
of the complex motivations and institutions underlying real-world economic activities. 
Chapter 9, “Consumption and the Consumer Society” begins by presenting the traditional 
utility-theoretic model of consumer behavior. The chapter explains the notion of consumer 
sovereignty, shows students how to graph a budget line, and explains the rule for utility 
maximization derived from marginal analysis. We also discuss the historical development of 
the “consumer society” and the psychological models of consumer behavior used in marketing 
research, presenting views and evidence on the relation between consumption/consumerism 
and happiness, and the personal and ecological impact of high-level consumption patterns. The 
Appendix presents a formal theory of consumer behavior, using budget lines and indifference 
curves to illustrate utility maximization in the standard model.
Chapter 10, “Markets for Labor” includes the traditional derivation of proﬁt-maximizing 
labor demand by a perfectly informed and perfectly competitive ﬁrm. Topics include the 
upward-sloping and backward-bending individual paid labor supply curves. The chapter 
then offers additional ways of understanding how wages are determined, including theories 
of compensating wage differentials, market power, worker motivation, and labor market 
discrimination. The Appendix sets out in formal terms the standard theory of the ﬁrm’s 
hiring decisions.
Chapter 11, “Economic and Social Inequality” introduces Part IV, moving from 
deﬁnitions and measurement of inequality to data on trends in the United States and other 
countries. The second half of the chapter focuses on what is known about the underlying 
causes of inequality, and discusses possible policy responses.
Chapter 12, “Taxes and Tax Policy” starts out, like many of the other chapters in the book, 
with standard theory—in this case, taxes in the supply-and-demand model—and (referring 
back to the chapter on welfare analysis) it analyzes deadweight losses from taxes. Moving 
then to discuss taxation speciﬁcally in the United States, data are presented on the structure 
of various federal taxes, and their impacts. 
Chapter 13, “The Economics of the Environment” shows how an understanding of 
externalities makes supply-and-demand analysis more relevant. This topic raises the problem 
of the valuation of externalities. We draw a distinction between standard and ecological 
views of the value of natural capital, raising the question of whether a standard cost-beneﬁt 
framework can reasonably be applied to issues with unpredictable effects over the very 
long term (given the complexity of natural systems). A section on approaches to nonmarket 
environmental valuation is followed by a survey of some policy options for dealing with 
externalities. The Appendix offers a formal analysis of negative externalities.
Chapter 14, “Common Property Resources and Public Goods” differentiates between 
private and public goods. It relates recent work on this important topic to environmental 
considerations, contrasting Garrett Hardin’s “tragedy of the commons” analysis with Elinor 
Ostrom’s work on common property management. These analyses are then applied to a 
discussion of the challenge of global climate change.
Chapter 15, “Capital Stocks and Resource Maintenance” is the ﬁrst of two chapters on 
production. It begins with a discussion of the activity of resource maintenance—that is, the 
importance of taking into consideration the effect of ﬂows created by economic activity on the 
stocks of productive resources that will be available for future use. In a departure from other 
treatments, this book examines the crucial contributions of natural capital (environmental 
resources), human capital, and social capital to economic activity and human well-being. It 
also incorporates treatments of manufactured capital (machinery and physical infrastructure) 
and ﬁnancial capital. 

XVIII 
PREFACE
In Chapter 16, “Production Costs” the discussion of production continues with a focus 
on the costs of production. We present the traditional model of a ﬁrm’s cost structure, with a 
focus on marginal costs. The chapter includes a traditional discussion of ﬁxed and variable 
inputs; diminishing, constant, and increasing returns; total and marginal costs, and short-run 
versus long-run issues. We set this model in context in two important ways. First, the chapter 
encourages students to reﬂect on the idea that because of externalities, private and social net 
beneﬁts from production may not be equivalent. Second, the chapter offers examples of cases 
where other economic actors (besides ﬁrms) make production decisions, and cases where 
other methods of decision making are necessary. 
Chapter 17, “Markets Without Power” focuses on the concept of a perfectly 
competitive market. Its theoretic characteristics are described, and the zero-economic-
proﬁt and efﬁciency outcomes are discussed. It continues the discussion from the previous 
chapter to explain the proﬁt-maximizing decisions of a perfectly competitive ﬁrm. Rather 
than simply concluding that perfectly competitive markets are always efﬁcient, it balances 
the perfectly competitive model with a discussion of efﬁciency and equity, including the 
topics of path dependence and network externalities. The Appendix offers a formal model 
of perfect competition.
Chapter 18: “Markets with Market Power” covers traditional models of monopoly, 
monopolistic competition, and oligopoly. These different market structures are presented 
along a competitiveness continuum, with perfect competition and pure monopoly the “ideal 
types” representing the opposite extremes. The chapter provides abundant examples of the 
different market structures, including a separate section on agriculture and health care.
Chapter 19, “Introduction to Macroeconomics” begins Part VI of the book with a 
presentation of basic macroeconomic concepts such as recession and inﬂation. It considers 
some micro-foundations issues including discussion of price changes that are either too slow 
(i.e., “sticky”) or too volatile (e.g., ﬁnancial market speculation), leading to macroeconomic 
instability. A broad view of macroeconomic goals includes stabilization, living standards growth, 
and sustainability. These issues are placed in historical context, introducing themes related to 
classical and Keynesian economics that will be developed more fully in subsequent chapters.
Chapter 20, “Macroeconomic Measurement: The Current Approach” presents a 
fairly standard introduction to national income accounting but emphasizes that the accounts 
have been created for speciﬁc purposes, with conventions that reﬂect particular assumptions 
or choices. It notes how the production and investments undertaken in the “household 
and institutions” and government sectors have historically been deemphasized in national 
accounting.
Chapter 21, “Macroeconomic Measurement: Environmental and Social Dimensions” 
gives a more thorough introduction to alternative measures of economic performance than 
can be found in any other introductory economics textbook. The chapter brieﬂy describes 
the Genuine Progress Indicator, the Better Life Index, the Human Development Index, and 
other current approaches for assessing well-being. It includes discussions of issues in the 
valuation of environmental and household services and of satellite accounts for environmental 
and household production.
Chapter 22, “The Structure of the U.S. Economy” is unique to this book. It describes key 
features of production and employment in the U.S. economy, broken down into its primary, 
secondary, and tertiary sectors. We include this material for several reasons. First, it makes 
the text more “real world” to students. Second, it provides basic economic literacy that we 
believe is sorely lacking among most economics students. Finally, it presents the context to 
illustrate several economic debates, such as the loss of manufacturing jobs, the rising costs of 
health care, and the meaning of the trend toward an ever-growing service sector, especially 
ﬁnancial services. While this chapter is written with a U.S. focus, its description of sectoral 
shifts is relevant to many economies around the world.

 
PREFACE

Chapter 23, “Employment, Unemployment, and Wages” discusses standard 
macroeconomic labor topics such as the deﬁnition of the unemployment rate, the different 
types of unemployment, and theories of the causes of unemployment. In addition, there is 
a special focus on labor market institutions. The chapter discusses changes in labor force 
participation rates, different theories of wage determination, and the sources of wage 
differentials and inequalities.
Chapter 24, “Aggregate Demand and Economic Fluctuations” introduces the analysis 
of business cycles, presents the classical theory of savings-investment balance through the 
market for loanable funds, and develops Keynesian aggregate demand analysis in the form 
of the traditional “Keynesian cross” diagram. Our treatment of these topics is fairly standard, 
although our contextual approach places more emphasis on the possibility of persistent 
unemployment than do many other current textbooks—a perspective that is important in the 
light of the very slow recovery from the Great Recession.
Chapter 25, “Fiscal Policy” balances formal analysis of ﬁscal policy with real-world 
data and examples. Analysis of ﬁscal policy impacts is presented in fairly simple terms, with 
an algebraic treatment of more complex multiplier effects in appendices. While the basic 
analysis presented here follows the Keynesian model, the text also discusses classical and 
supply-side perspectives. The section on budgets and deﬁcits should give students a basic 
understanding—developed further in Chapter 16—of deﬁcits, debt, and how these affect 
the economy. The difference between automatic stabilizers and discretionary policy is made 
clear, and recent ﬁscal policies are discussed.
Chapter 26, “Money, Banking, and Finance” presents the basics of money and the 
banking system, including inﬂation, deﬂation, liquidity, and the different aggregate measures 
of money. Students are introduced to asset and liabilities tables, different banking institutions, 
and the process of money creation through the fractional reserve system. The chapter 
concludes with a discussion of non-bank ﬁnancial institutions, ﬁnancialization, and ﬁnancial 
bubbles—topics of great relevance following the ﬁnancial crisis of 2007–8.
Chapter 27, “The Federal Reserve and Monetary Policy” focuses on the role of the 
Federal Reserve and the implementation of monetary policy. Here we discuss the Federal 
Reserve’s structure, functions, and monetary policy tools that it employs to create money. 
The chapter also spotlights the monetary economy in the United States over the past 12 
years, with particular attention to the role of monetary policy in the 2007–8 ﬁnancial crisis, 
and the nature of the monetary response to the crisis. The chapter also contains an appendix 
that explains in detail the indirect effect that the Federal Reserve can have on interest rates 
through the workings of the market for Treasury bonds.
Chapter 28, “Aggregate Supply, Aggregate Demand, and Inﬂation: Putting It All 
Together” addresses the tricky problem of how to teach the relationship between output 
and inﬂation to introductory students in a way that is simple yet intellectually defensible. 
The model presented in this chapter has many features that will be familiar to instructors. 
But unlike AS/AD models that put the price level on the vertical axis, this model has the 
inﬂation rate on the vertical axis, which makes it more relevant for discussing current 
events.* Unlike many new classical theory–inﬂuenced textbooks, our basic presentation is 
not centered on a notion of long-run full-employment equilibrium output. We emphasize, 
instead, how the macroeconomy adjusts dynamically in the short and medium term to often-
*Regarding the theoretical underpinnings of our model, our downward-sloped AD curve is based on the AD curve 
developed by David Romer (“Keynesian Macroeconomics Without the LM Curve,” Journal of Economic Perspectives 
14:2 [2000]: 149–169) and adopted by other introductory textbooks writers, including John B. Taylor (Principles 
of Macroeconomics, Houghton Mifﬂin, various editions). Our curved AS is based on the notion of an expectations-
augmented Phillips curve, translated into inﬂation and output space. The idea of a dynamically evolving economy, rather 
than one always headed toward settling at full employment, is an approach based on Keynes’ own (rather than new 
Keynesian) thought, as explained in the appendix to Chapter 13.

PREFACE
unpredictable economic events. This also makes relating the model to current events more 
realistic. (Classical theory is not, however, neglected. It is also discussed in the chapter 
and the Appendix.)
Chapter 29, “The Global Economy and Policy” adds the foreign sector to the 
circular-ﬂow picture, which now includes savings, investment, taxes, government 
spending, exports, and imports. This chapter provides a more detailed treatment than most 
books of the factors that inﬂuence currency exchange rates worldwide. Chapter 29 also 
highlights the increasingly important links between ﬁscal and monetary policies and the 
global economy. Finally, in introducing students to the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund, the chapter addresses the real-world political economy of international 
economic relations.
Chapter 30, “The Financial Crisis and the Great Recession” is another unique feature 
of this book. In treating a topic that, as of early 2014, continued to affect the lives of millions, 
the chapter helps adds current relevance to the discussion of macroeconomic policy. Rather 
than develop a theoretical framework, Chapter 15 applies many of the insights introduced 
in earlier chapters to explain some of the likely causes and consequences of the ﬁnancial 
crisis that led to the Great Recession. The chapter supplies an ideal context for extensive 
discussion of how the “real” economy relates to the ﬁnancial economy, and the potential 
problems with an imbalance toward ﬁnance. It highlights the role of the housing bubble and 
subprime lending, as well as ﬁnancial deregulation more generally, in creating the conditions 
for crisis. The latter part of the chapter discusses ﬁnancial reform—efforts as well as new 
ideas—and asks some of the “big” questions that must be addressed if we are to avoid such 
crises in the future.
Chapter 31, “Deﬁcits and Debt” is distinctive in a number of ways. First, it provides a 
current focus for the discussion of ﬁscal policy, allowing for greater elaboration on deﬁcits 
and debt. Second, in an effort to alleviate the common confusion over the deﬁnition of the 
debt, the chapter includes a detailed classiﬁcation of public and private debt types. Third, 
Chapter 16 analyzes the debate over stimulus versus austerity, including a contrast between 
how the United States and the eurozone have addressed their recent economic downturns, 
and considering the issue of sovereign debt. Finally, the chapter offers a survey of policy 
responses to the problem of long-term debt. 
Chapter 32, “How Economies Grow and Develop” presents basic concepts related to 
economic growth, such as the Rostow and Harrod-Domar models, which emphasize the 
importance of investment in manufactured capital. But the chapter also provides examples 
of how investment in other types of capital—e.g., human or natural capital—can be equally, 
if not more, important, and distinguishes between growth and development. It also explores 
in detail the question of whether most poor countries have been “catching up” with the 
industrialized world (“convergence”) or falling behind. Country diversity is a recurrent 
theme; the chapter emphasizes that the “one size ﬁts all” approach to economic development 
emphasizing structural reforms—such as those embodied in the Washington Consensus—has 
produced disappointing results, and that different approaches are required in response to the 
circumstances in individual countries.
Chapter 33, “Growth and Sustainability in the Twenty-First Century” is an unusual 
chapter for an economics textbook—but a crucially important one, in terms of economic 
education for intelligent citizenship. It examines a number of ecological challenges and 
includes a section on global climate change. While it covers standard theories such as the 
environmental Kuznets curve, it raises serious challenges to the belief that economic growth 
and markets on their own can solve this century’s social and environmental problems. More 
directly, it asks whether the traditional macroeconomic goal of continued economic growth 
is compatible with the long-term goal of sustainability. Finally, the chapter presents ideas

for alternative approaches at the local, national, and global level that, while sustainable, do 
not detract from well-being.
SPECIAL FEATURES
Each chapter in this text contains many features designed to enhance student learning.
s  Key terms are highlighted in boldface throughout the text, with sidebar deﬁnitions for easy 
comprehension and review.
s  Discussion Questions at the end of each section encourage immediate review of what has 
been read and relate the material to the students’ own experience. The frequent appearance 
of these questions throughout each chapter helps students review manageable portions 
of material and thus boosts comprehension. The questions can be used for participatory 
exercises involving the entire class or for small-group discussion.
s  End-of-Chapter Review Questions are designed to encourage students to create their own 
summary of concepts. They also serve as helpful guidelines to the importance of various 
points.
s  End-of-Chapter Exercises encourage students to work with and apply the material, thereby 
gaining increased mastery of concepts, models, and investigative techniques.
s  Throughout the chapters, boxes enliven the material with real-world illustrations drawn 
from a variety of sources regarding applications of economic concepts and recent economic 
developments.
s  In order to make the chapters as lively and accessible as possible, some formal and technical 
material (suitable for inclusion in some but not all course designs) is carefully and concisely 
explained in chapter appendices.
s  A glossary at the end of the book contains all key terms, their deﬁnitions, and the number 
of the chapter in which each was ﬁrst used and deﬁned.
CONTENT AND ORGANIZATION
Some of the innovative features of this text are apparent in even a quick scan of the table of 
contents, the sample course outlines on pp. xxv–xxviii, or Chapter 0 and Chapter 1. Although 
this textbook takes a broader and more contextual approach to economic activities, it ﬁts these 
within a familiar overall organizational strategy.
Part I, “The Context for Economic Analysis” presents the themes of the book and the 
major actors in the economy. Students are introduced to a range of economic questions and 
goals, to basic empirical and theoretical tools, and to the basic activities and institutions of 
a modern economy. 
Part II, “Basic Economic Analysis” introduces basic supply and demand analysis, 
elasticities, and welfare analysis. It also includes a chapter on international trade. Most of 
this material will look very familiar to teachers of economics, although this text gives greater 
recognition than is typical to real-world market institutions and the limitations of traditional 
welfare analysis.
Part III, “Economics and Society” considers the economic roles that will be familiar to 
all readers throughout their lives: as workers and as consumers. These roles are illustrated 
with examples that depart from the standard models—for example, household production 
is recognized throughout. This part is introduced by a chapter on economic behavior, based 
on the latest studies in behavioral economics. It also includes a chapter on the topic of 
consumerism, and one on labor markets.
Part IV, “Essential Topics for Contemporary Economics” puts the economy in a social 
context, with one chapter on distribution, inequality, and poverty, and another on government 

XXII 
PREFACE
roles, with an emphasis on taxes. The ecological context for the economy is then examined 
in two chapters that take up issues such as pollution, externalities, common property, and 
public goods. 
Part V, “Resources, Production, and Market Organization” goes more into depth on 
market topics by describing the idealized model of perfect competition, presenting models of 
market power including monopoly, monopolistic competition, and oligopoly, and analyzing 
various resource markets.
Part VI, “Macroeconomic Basics” introduces basic macroeconomic deﬁnitions and 
accounting methods, including gross domestic product (GDP), inﬂation, aggregate demand, 
and unemployment. These are supplemented with a discussion of how new accounting systems 
are being developed to measure the economic contributions of the natural environment, unpaid 
household labor, and other previously uncounted factors. The second half of Part VI brings 
these abstractions down to earth with a description of the structure of the U.S. macroeconomy 
and discussion of the labor market and unemployment.
Part VII, “Macroeconomic Theory and Policy” explores the issue of macroeconomic 
ﬂuctuations. The ﬁrst chapters clearly present Keynesian and classical theories of the 
determination of aggregate demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS) and the effects of 
ﬁscal and monetary policies. This section develops a dynamic AS/AD model of output and 
inﬂation that, with inﬂation rather than price level on the vertical axis, is designed to be 
comprehensible and usefully representative of the real world. It concludes with a chapter 
discussing macroeconomic issues in the global economy. 
Part VIII, “Macroeconomic Issues and Applications” addresses the contemporary 
issues of ﬁnancial crisis, the Great Recession, debt and deﬁcits, economic development, 
and the environment. While the ﬁrst two chapters here are presented from a largely U.S. 
perspective, the second half of this Part widens the lens to explore current global issues 
of poverty and inequality, economic growth, human development, and environmental 
challenges.
In order to focus on “contextual” discussions, formal instruction in algebraic modeling 
techniques is placed in optional appendices to the chapters. While this book reviews the 
basics of supply and demand and includes “new classical” economics among the theories 
discussed, it devotes fewer pages to the concept of efﬁcient markets than many books do and 
certainly less than recent books that have adopted a strongly “new classical” slant. Instead, 
this text gives prominent consideration to new thinking in behavioral economics, analysis of 
ﬁnancial instability and market bubbles, social and environmental issues, and policy responses 
to problems of unemployment, inequality, and environmental damage.
SUPPLEMENTS
The supplements package for this book provides a set of teaching tools and resources for 
instructors using this text. The authors have worked closely with our associate Dr. Patrick 
Dolenc to create an Instructor’s Resource Manual and Test Bank to accompany Principles 
of Economics in Context. To access these electronically, send a request via e-mail to gdae@
tufts.edu that contains sufﬁcient information for us to verify your instructor status.
For each chapter, the Instructor’s Resource Manual includes an introductory note and 
answers to all review questions and end-of-chapter exercises. In addition, the “Notes on 
Discussion Questions” section provides not only suggested answers to these questions but also 
ideas on how the questions might be used in the classroom. Sections titled “Web Resources” 
and “Extensions” provide supplementary material and links to other passages in the book or 
other materials that can be used to enrich lectures and discussion.
The Test Bank includes multiple-choice and true/false questions for each chapter. The 
correct answer for each question is indicated.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Principles of Economics in Context was written under the auspices of the Global Development 
and Environment Institute (GDAE), a research institute at Tufts University. All contributors 
of written materials were paid through grants raised by the Global Development and Envi-
ronment Institute. By agreement with the authors, all royalties from sales of the book will go 
to support the work of the institute. We greatly appreciate the ﬁnancial support that we have 
received from the V.K. Rasmussen Foundation, Spencer T. and Ann W. Olin, and the Ford, 
Island, and Barr Foundations. 
This text has been a long time in the making, and many people have been involved along 
the way. First, we would like to thank Wassily Leontief, who initially urged us to write a book 
on economic principles for students in transitional economies. He provided inspiration and 
encouragement during those early years. We also are enormously grateful to Kelvin Lancaster, 
who allowed us to use Modern Economics: Principles and Policy (a textbook that he and 
Ronald Dulany wrote in the 1970s) as a jumping-off point for our work. 
GDAE Research Fellow Anne-Marie Codur contributed to Chapter 33 on growth and 
sustainability, including updating the demography appendix; Dr. Nathan Perry of Colorado 
Mesa University contributed to Chapter 31 on deﬁcits and debt; Ben Beachy contributed to 
Chapter 30 on ﬁnancial crisis; and Dr. James Devine of Loyola Marymount University, Los 
Angeles, contributed to the macro modeling chapters.
We thank a number of instructors who were exceptionally generous in giving us detailed 
comments on the previous and the new edition, including Alison Butler, Willamette University; 
Gary Flomenhoft, University of Vermont; Robin King, Georgetown University; Dennis 
Leyden, University of North Carolina, Greenville; Valerie Luzadis, SUNY-ESF, Syracuse;

Essential support work on research and manuscript preparation, including data analysis 
for Chapter 0, was provided by GDAE Research Coordinator Josh Uchitelle-Pierce, who 
took on a wide variety of tasks, solving many technical problems and maintaining a high 
quality of presentation throughout the volume. He was ably assisted by Mitchell Stallman, 
Reid Spagna, Nicholas Lusardo and Lauren Jayson. Administrative and outreach support at 
the Global Development and Environment Institute was provided by Casey Kennedy and 
Erin Coutts.
We also thank the staff of M.E. Sharpe, particularly Irene Bunnell, Angela Piliouras, and 
Laura Brengelman, for their enthusiasm and meticulous work in getting this book to press. 
Our editors, George Lobell and Patricia Kolb, contributed support and helpful suggestions 
throughout the process.
Finally, we would like to thank the many students we’ve had the privilege to teach over 
the years—you continually inspire us and provide hope for a bright future.

Sample Course Outlines
Providing both standard and innovative materials for introductory economics, Principles 
of Economics in Context can be used as the basis for a variety of approaches, depending on 
which topics and approaches are of particular interest.
To help identify the chapter assignments that make the most sense for a particular class, we 
have put together some ideas for course outlines below. Arranged in terms of broad selections 
and more speciﬁc emphases, they are designed to help instructors choose among chapters 
when there is not enough time to cover everything in this textbook.
We understand that in many departments one primary objective of the introductory 
course is to teach in some detail “how (neoclassical) economists think.” For instructors 
who choose to focus exclusively on neoclassical content, the most traditional combination 
of the selections described below—the Base Chapters, combined with some or all of the 
Basic Microeconomics and Basic Macroeconomics Selection and the Neoclassical Emphasis 
and Macro-Modeling Emphasis chapters—will provide what you need. This combination 
of chapters does not come close to exploiting fully the richness of Principles of Economics 
in Context, but the contextual discussions (a hallmark of this text) that are woven into the 
standard material will broaden the students’ understanding of economic theory and provide 
tools for critical thinking.
Many instructors have somewhat more leeway and can combine coverage of traditional 
neoclassical ideas with other material. Addressing such users of Principles of Economics in 
Context, we suggest that you make use of the special structure of the book, which enables you 
to introduce traditional concepts in your introductory course while still reserving class time 
for other areas of interest. Ecological sustainability, for example, is an issue of increasing 
importance and is deeply linked to the functioning of the economy. For this focus, the Base 
Chapters Selection and most of the Basic Microeconomics and Basic Macroeconomics 
Selection could be combined with the “Ecological Emphasis” Selection. 
Some instructors and students may have less interest in the formalities of economic 
modeling, in which case it might make sense to cover the Base Chapters Selection, some 
material from the Basic Microeconomics and Basic Macroeconomics Selection, and much 
more material from the topical emphases such as “Human Development” and “Poverty/
Inequality/Social Justice.” For coverage of alternative and critical perspectives, the “Critiques 
of Neoclassical Economics” and “Keynesian/Post-Keynesian/Institutionalist” selection will 
be useful.
The data presented in Chapter 0 cover a wide variety of topics and applications, and it may 
be appropriate to refer back to this chapter for almost any of the selections below.

Economics and Well-Being
What comes to your mind when you think of the word “economics”? Perhaps you think about 
things like money, the stock market, globalization, and supply-and-demand. These things are 
deﬁnitely important to our study of economics, and we will spend much of our time in this 
book studying these concepts.
But the goals of economics are about much more than these. As we will see in Chapter 
1, economics is: the study of how people manage their resources to meet their needs and 
enhance their well-being. The term “well-being” can mean different things to different people. 
We take an inclusive approach to well-being in this book. Well-being depends on traditional 
economic indicators like our income and material standard of living. But our well-being also 
depends on many other issues, such as the quality of our environment, our leisure time, and 
our perceptions of fairness and justice. Our study of economics will help you better understand 
many of the outcomes that we observe and think about ways that we might be able to improve 
things. Many of the topics that we will study relate to current economic and political debates, 
such as economic inequality, the environment, taxes, and globalization.
The purpose of this introductory chapter is to provide an overview of some of the topics that 
we cover in more detail later in the book. Good data are essential for informed debates about how 
to enhance well-being in our communities. In this chapter, for each topic we provide a graphical 
representation of important data. We have tried to be as objective as possible by presenting a 
wide range of data from reliable sources. You may ﬁnd some of this information surprising, as 
the results may differ from common perceptions and media representations.
The information in this chapter is divided into three sections: time trends, showing how a 
particular variable changes over time; bar graphs, showing data for different sections of the 
population or different industries; and bar graphs showing international comparisons. While 
we focus on the United States here, and in much of the rest of the book, it is important to see 
individual country data within the global context. If you are interested in the performance 
of speciﬁc countries we have not included here, detailed tables are available on the book’s 
companion website: www.gdae.org/principles.
The graphs that appear in this chapter are:

International comparison rankings are based on the available data, including the highest 
and lowest values for each variable. While there are over 200 countries in the world, data are 
not available for all countries for each variable, so the number of countries ranked for each 
variable differs. The United States is shown in a different color. The rankings are presented 
with the “highest” at the top and the “lowest” at the bottom. However, this does not always 
mean that it is best to be at the top. For example, one of the graphs shows the percentage of 
people living in absolute poverty. Obviously, it is not a good thing to be ranked #1 for this 
variable.

1. U.S. GDP PER CAPITA
What it is: GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is a measure of the total value of goods 
and services produced in a country. As discussed in Chapters 20 and 21, 
there are controversies about exactly what is covered, or not covered, 
by GDP, but the measure is used very widely as an index of the status 
and growth of an economy. GDP can be seen both as a measures of 
product and of income. GDP per capita, shown here, is GDP divided by 
the country’s population, and the time trend of GDP/capita shows how 
average income changes over time. 
The results: U.S. GDP per capita has increased nearly threefold since 1960. The 
progression has not been entirely smooth, with pauses and declines 
especially during periods of economic recession, but the overall trend is 
upwards. One of the largest breaks in this trend was the recent recession 
of 2007–9, discussed in detail in Chapter 23, 25, 28, and 30. As the graph 
shows, GDP/capita started to recover after 2010, but remained below its 
2007 peak through 2012.

2. U.S. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, 1960–PRESENT
What it is: The unemployment rate is a measure of the proportion of people in the 
labor force who are seeking jobs but unable to ﬁnd them (discussed in 
detail in Chapter 23). The measure does not include people who have part-
time work but would like full-time work, nor does it include “discouraged 
workers” who have given up looking for work. The unemployment 
rate typically falls during economic expansions, and rises during and 
immediately after economic recessions.
The results: U.S. unemployment has varied since 1960 between about 4 and 10 percent. 
In expansionary periods such as the late 1960s and the late 1990s, it 
was between 4 and 5 percent. In recessions it has typically risen above 
6 percent, with peaks of between 8 and 10 percent in 1975, 1982, and 
2010, resulting from severe recessions.

3. U.S. INFLATION RATE, 1960–PRESENT
What it is: The inﬂation rate is a measure of the average increase in prices between 
one year and the next. It is measured by the change in the Consumer 
Price Index, discussed in Chapter 20. There are various versions of the 
Consumer Price Index (CPI); the graph below is based on the CPI-U, 
which measures the cost of living in urban areas. 
The results: The U.S. inﬂation rate has varied considerably since 1960, with noticeable 
peaks in the late 1970s and early1980s. At these times, the inﬂation rate 
rose above 10 percent (referred to as “double-digit inﬂation). This level of 
inﬂation is considered signiﬁcantly harmful to an economy, as discussed 
in Chapters 26-28. Since 1990, inﬂation rates in the United States have 
generally been fairly low, not rising above 4 percent, and averaging around 
3 percent. During the 2007–9 recession, inﬂation brieﬂy fell to zero, 
arousing concern about deﬂation—negative inﬂation or generally falling 
prices. (Although some might think that falling prices would be a good 
thing, sustained deﬂation can be very damaging to businesses and reduce 
employment, as occurred during the Great Depression of the 1930s.)

4. TAXES AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP
What it is: The graph below shows tax collections in the United States over the 
period 1950–2012, measured as a percentage of gross domestic product 
(GDP). Total taxes are divided into federal taxes and state and local 
taxes.
The results: Total tax collections in the United States gradually increased from 
about 25% of GDP in the 1950s to close to 35% of GDP in the late 
1990s. Since then, state and local tax collection has remained relatively 
constant, while federal tax collection has generally declined. Although 
in surveys many Americans say they believe taxes have increased in 
recent years (particularly federal taxes), the opposite is true. We discuss 
taxes in more detail in Chapter 12.

What it is: Media stories about the economy often focus on the performance of the 
stock market. Several common stock indices, such as the Dow Jones 
Composite, the Nasdaq Composite, and S&P (Standard & Poor’s) 500 
Index, provide a broad overview of stock market prices. The graph 
below shows the value of the S&P 500 Index from 1965 to mid-2013. 
The S&P 500 Index is calculated based on the stock prices of 500 large, 
mostly American, companies.
The results: From 1965 to 2000, the S&P 500 Index rose from about 100 to more 
than 1,500. Since 2000, two major “crashes” have taken place in the 
U.S. stock market. In each crash, the S&P 500 lost about half its value 
and then recovered to previous levels over several years. Although we 
do not discuss the stock market in much detail in this book, we spend 
considerable time discussing how markets operate, including the factors 
that lead to price ﬂuctuations.

6. MEDIAN HOME PRICES
What it is: The “median” price of home sales is the price at which half of homes 
sell for more than this price, and half sell for less. The graph below 
shows median home price in the United States over the period 1987 to 
mid-2013. The prices have not been adjusted for inﬂation.
The results: The median price of houses in the United States increased by a factor of 
three between 1987 and 2007. Then the housing bubble burst, and home 
prices fell by about one-third. Since then home prices have remained 
relatively low. Our discussion of markets, beginning in Chapter 2 and 
covering many of the chapters in this book, will help you understand 
how markets operate.

7. MEDIAN WORKER EARNINGS VS. CORPORATE PROFITS
What it is: The graph below shows the change in two variables over the period 
1980 to 2012 in the United States:
 
1. Total corporate proﬁts, measured in billions of dollars
 
2. Median weekly earnings for American workers, measured in  
 
dollars
 
The data for both variables have been adjusted for inﬂation. Note that 
the vertical axis is measured in dollars for median worker earnings and 
billions of dollars for corporate proﬁts.
The results: Corporate proﬁts have ﬂuctuated based on the health of the overall 
economy, but we see that proﬁts reached a record high in 2012. 
Corporate proﬁts in 2012 were over three times the level they were at 
in 1980. Meanwhile, the median wages of U.S. workers have essentially 
not changed at all since 1980. We will discuss wages in more detail 
in Chapter 10, including the reasons why wages have not risen in 
proportion to corporate proﬁts.

8. GLOBAL INTERNATIONAL TRADE
What it is: 
The graph below shows the percentage of world economic production 
(called “gross world product”) that is traded across international 
borders, over the period 1960 to 2011. This is one way to get a quick 
snapshot of the degree of “globalization.”
The results: At least as measured by international trade, the world is clearly 
becoming more globalized. About 12 percent of all goods and 
services produced in the world were traded across international 
borders in 1960. Currently, about 30 percent of world production 
is traded internationally. We can see that the global financial crisis 
of 2007–8 temporarily reduced international trade but that it has 
since recovered to previous levels. We discuss international trade 
further in Chapters 7 and 29.

9. GLOBAL CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS
What it is: The vast majority of scientists believe that human activities are affecting 
the global climate. Carbon dioxide emissions, which result when oil, 
coal, and natural gas are burned, have been identiﬁed as the primary 
cause of global climate change. The graph below shows global carbon 
dioxide emissions from 1960 to 2010, measured in gigatons (a gigaton 
is a billion metric tons).
The results: We see that global carbon dioxide emissions increased from about 10 
gigatons in 1960 to over 30 gigatons in 2010. Although most projections 
indicate that global carbon dioxide emissions will continue to increase in 
the future, scientists indicate that emissions must decrease substantially 
in the next few decades to avoid signiﬁcant negative consequences to 
the global ecosystem and to human societies. We discuss global climate 
change in more detail in Chapters 14 and 33.

10. INCOME INEQUALITY
What it is: The graph below shows the average household income for different 
income groups in the United States, based on 2011 data. Each group 
represents one-ﬁfth of American households, except for the last group, 
which includes only the top 5 percent.
The results: For households in the bottom ﬁfth of Americans, average income in 
2011 was only about $11,000. For those in the middle ﬁfth, household 
income averaged about $50,000. Those in the top ﬁfth had an average 
household income of nearly $180,000. Average household income was 
more than $300,000 for the top 5 percent. Note that these are average 
values, so some households in each group made less than these income 
values, while some made more. We discuss income inequality, including 
its causes, in more detail in Chapter 11.

11. UNEQUAL INCOME GROWTH
What it is: The graph below shows the growth in household income for different 
income groups in the United States, over the period 1968–2011. As 
in the previous graph, each group represents one-ﬁfth of American 
households, except for the last group, which includes only the top 5 
percent. The data have been adjusted for inﬂation.
The results: You have probably heard the saying: “The poor get poorer and the 
rich get richer.” That is close, but not quite true. We see that those at 
the bottom of the income distribution did see small income gains in 
recent decades. Those in the middle did a little better. But the largest 
gains, by far, were obtained by those at the top, particularly those in the 
top 5 percent. The graph tells us that income inequality has increased 
considerably in recent decades. We discuss trends in income inequality 
in more detail in Chapter 11.

12. GENDER-BASED EARNINGS INEQUALITY
What it is: The “gender wage gap” is the difference in median earnings between 
men and women who work full time. The graph below shows women’s 
median earnings in the United States as a percentage of men’s median 
earnings, over the period 1979 to 2011.
The results: In 1979, women working full time in the United States earned only 
62 percent of what men earned. During the 1980s the gender wage 
gap closed considerably. By the early 1990s, women working full 
time earned more than 75 percent of what men earned. Since then, 
the wage gap has continued to close, but more slowly. In 2011, 
women earned 82 percent of what men earned. Is this clear evidence 
of gender discrimination? We discuss this topic in more detail in 
Chapter 10.

13. EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT
What it is: Education is an important type of “human capital”—a term that 
economists use to describe the knowledge and skills people possess that 
allow them to engage in production activities. The graph below shows 
the maximum educational attainment for Americans age 25 and older in 
1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2012. Each column adds up to 100 
percent, but the percentage falling into each education category varies 
with changes in educational attainment.
The results: In 1960, about 58 percent of Americans age 25 and older had not graduated 
high school, and less than 10 percent had a college degree or higher. We 
see that educational attainment has increased each decade but still only 
about 30 percent of adult Americans have a college degree or higher. We 
discuss the relationship between education and wages in Chapter 10 and 
education as a form of human capital in Chapter 15.

14. INDUSTRIAL CONCENTRATION RATIOS
What it is: An industrial concentration ratio measures the percentage of all sales in a 
particular industry that are received by the largest ﬁrms in that industry. 
The ﬁgure below shows four-ﬁrm concentration ratios—the percentage 
of all sales received by the largest four ﬁrms in each industry. Industrial 
concentration ratios provide information about the degree of market 
power held by large ﬁrms in a particular industry.
The results: Some industries in the United States are dominated by a few ﬁrms, while 
other industries are more competitive. Examples of industries with a few 
dominant ﬁrms include discount department stores (e.g., Walmart and 
Target) and home centers (e.g., Home Depot and Lowe’s). Examples of 
industries that are not dominated by a few ﬁrms include convenience 
stores and gasoline stations. We discuss market power in more detail in 
Chapter 18.

15. GDP PER CAPITA
What it is: 
Media stories of economic performance frequently refer to gross 
domestic product (GDP). A country’s GDP per capita measures 
economic production per person per year, which gives us an idea of 
the average material living standards in the country. While GDP is 
perhaps the most commonly used macroeconomic metric, it does not 
necessarily measure well-being. We discuss how GDP is calculated 
in Chapter 20 and about the limitations of, and alternatives to, GDP 
in Chapter 21.
The results: The United States ranks tenth, with a GDP per capita of around 
$48,000. Luxembourg has the world’s highest GDP per capita at 
around $90,000, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo has the 
lowest, at only $370.

THE CONTEXT FOR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
16. RECENT GROWTH RATE OF GDP PER CAPITA
What it is: In macroeconomics, we seek to explain not only why some countries 
have a higher GDP per capita but also what conditions lead to strong 
GDP growth rates. In this graph we compare the growth in GDP per 
capita, after adjusting for inﬂation, across countries over the ten-year 
period 2002–2011. We discuss measuring GDP growth rates in Chapter 
20 and theories of GDP growth in Chapter 32.
The results: GDP per capita over 2002–2011 grew rapidly in some countries, slowly 
in others, and even declined in several countries. The highest growth 
in GDP per capita occurred in Azerbaijan, primarily from oil and gas 
development, with high growth also in China, Argentina, Ethiopia, 
and India. The fastest growth among developed countries took place 
in Sweden. Countries with declines in GDP per capita include Italy, 
Haiti, Iraq, and the Bahamas.

17. NET NATIONAL SAVINGS
What it is: 
How much a country saves and invests is widely considered an 
important factor in explaining differences in GDP growth rates. 
Here we present data on net national savings rates, which equal total 
national savings minus the depreciation of productive capital such as 
factories and machinery. A negative net national savings rate implies 
that a country’s productive capacity may be declining. We discuss 
saving, investment, and growth in detail in Chapter 33.
The results: In 2010, China had the highest net national saving rate. Other countries 
with high savings rates include India, Singapore, Vietnam, and 
Thailand. Fourteen countries (among those with data) had a negative 
net savings rate in 2010, including the United States, Portugal, 
Greece, and Iceland. (The economy of Iceland was especially badly 
damaged in the crash of 2007–8; this history is still apparent in the 
2011 data.)

18. GOVERNMENT DEBT
What it is: The level of government debt has been a focus of media stories in 
recent years. What matters is not so much the size of debt in dollars but 
government debt relative to a country’s GDP. This variable considers 
the amount of debt owed by the governments of different countries, 
including debts owed to domestic and foreign entities. What level of 
debt is a problem is a topic we discuss in more detail in Chapter 31.
The results: Japan has the highest government debt in the world, measured as a 
percentage of GDP, followed by Zimbabwe and Greece. The United 
States has the thirty-ﬁfth-highest debt, but many other developed 
countries have higher debt, including Singapore, France, Canada, and 
Germany. Most developing countries have relatively low government 
debt.

19. LABOR PRODUCTIVITY
What it is: One measure of the economic efficiency of a country is labor 
productivity. This is calculated by dividing a country’s GDP by an 
estimate of the total number of hours worked. Thus labor productivity 
tells us how many dollars of GDP are generated for each hour worked. 
We present more about labor productivity in Chapter 10.
The results: Data on labor productivity are available for only 35 countries. Norway 
has the highest labor productivity in the world. The United States ranks 
fourth, behind Luxembourg and Ireland. Productivity is slightly lower 
in France and Germany. Less developed countries have lower labor 
productivity. We see that productivity in Mexico is only about one-third 
of the U.S. level.

THE CONTEXT FOR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
20. AVERAGE ANNUAL HOURS WORKED
What it is: Even if two countries have the same labor productivity, their GDP will 
differ if the number of hours worked are different. This graph shows 
the average number of hours worked each year by full-time employees. 
Note that this includes only hours actually worked; vacations, holidays, 
and sick days are excluded. Thus the average annual hours worked in a 
country may be high if work expectations are more stringent and time 
off is limited. Work hours may also be high if workers choose to work 
long hours. We discuss work hours further in Chapters 10 and 23.
The results: Data on hours worked are available for only 34 countries. The 
average annual hours worked per full-time employee are lowest in the 
Netherlands. Other countries with relatively low annual work hours are 
Germany, Norway, France, and Denmark. One reason for the low work 
hours in these countries is federal laws that mandate minimum vacation 
times and paid holidays. In the United States, where such laws do not 
exist, average work hours are higher. Work hours tend to be highest 
among countries with lower levels of GDP per capita.

21. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE (PERCENT OF TOTAL WORKFORCE)
What it is: 
The unemployment rate in a country is an important macroeconomic 
metric. Not only does having a job provide a source of income, but it 
also provides a sense of identity and contributes to overall well-being. 
Estimating the unemployment rate is somewhat complex. In Chapter 
23 we discuss issues involved in estimating the unemployment rate 
including deﬁning what it means to be in the workforce.
The results: Unemployment rates vary tremendously across countries. Cambodia 
has the lowest ofﬁcial unemployment rate at 0.2 percent. While many 
poor countries, such as Zimbabwe, Haiti, and Kenya, have very high 
unemployment rates (30 percent or more), other poor countries such 
as Cuba and Bhutan, have rather low unemployment rates, at around 
4 percent. The unemployment rate in the United States, usually in the 
range of 4–6%, rose considerably in the 2007–9 recession, and has 
since declined only slowly.

THE CONTEXT FOR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
22. INFLATION
What it is: 
The rate of inﬂation summarizes how average prices change in a 
country in one year. For example, an inﬂation rate of 5 percent means 
that average prices increased by 5 percent that year. We discuss how 
to adjust data from different years for inﬂation in Chapter 20 and then 
focus on macroeconomic theories of inﬂation in Chapters 26 and 27.
The results: Over the period 2002–2011, Japan had the lowest inﬂation rate in the 
world, with prices actually declining slightly during this time. However, 
this is not necessarily a good thing, as we see later in the book. A low and 
stable—but not negative—inﬂation rate is generally considered one of 
the main macroeconomic policy goals. Most developed countries have 
generally been successful in controlling inﬂation in recent years. High 
and ﬂuctuating inﬂation rates in a country are a sign of macroeconomic 
instability.

23. TOTAL TAX REVENUES (PERCENT OF GDP)
What it is: 
Tax policies are among the most signiﬁcant ways a government can 
inﬂuence the well-being of the citizens, as we discuss in Chapters 12 
and 25. The overall rate of taxation, expressed as a percentage of GDP, 
includes taxes collected at the federal, state, and local levels.
The results: Overall tax revenues vary signiﬁcantly across countries. While Western 
European countries tend to have relatively high taxes, some other 
countries with surprisingly high taxes (more than 40 percent of GDP) 
include Iraq, Bolivia, and Bhutan. The United States has one of the 
lowest overall tax rates in the world—by far the lowest of any major 
industrialized country. The countries with the lowest tax revenues (less 
than 15 percent of GDP) tend to be relatively poor countries in Africa 
and Asia.

THE CONTEXT FOR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
24. TRADE BALANCE (PERCENT OF GDP)
What it is: The trade deﬁcit of the United States is often considered a cause for 
concern in media stories. A trade deﬁcit means that a country imports 
more than it exports. Economists refer to a country’s trade balance as 
the dollar value of its exports minus its imports, normally expressed as 
a percentage of GDP. Thus a negative trade balance indicates a trade 
deﬁcit. A positive trade balance indicates a trade surplus. We discuss trade 
balances, and other trade issues, in more detail in Chapters 7 and 29.
The results: Of the 153 countries with available data, 49 have a positive trade balance 
(exports exceed imports) and 104 have a negative balance. Those 
countries with the largest trade surpluses tend to be smaller countries 
(such as Luxembourg and Singapore) or oil-producing countries (such 
as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait). The U.S. trade deﬁcit is about 4 percent 
of GDP, with other developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, 
France, and Canada, in a similar range. The countries with the largest 
trade deﬁcits tend to be poorer countries, although some poor countries 
do have trade surpluses.

25. INCOME INEQUALITY (GINI COEFFICIENT)
What it is: A Gini coefﬁcient is a measure of economic inequality in a country. 
It is most commonly applied to the distribution of income, but it can 
also be apply to wealth distribution or other variables. It can range 
from 0 (everyone in the country has the same exact income) to 1 (one 
person receives all the income in a country). We learn more about Gini 
coefﬁcients and economic inequality in Chapters 11 and 32.
The results: Scandinavian countries such as Sweden, Norway, and Finland tend to be the 
most equal countries in the world, by income. Japan is also in this group, 
in a number of equality measures (not all shown here, but discussed in 
Chapter 32). The United States is the most economically unequal developed 
country. Several African countries, including Botswana, Lesotho, Sierra 
Leone, and South Africa are the most unequal countries in the world.

26. CEO PAY VS. WORKER PAY: INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS
What it is: In addition to comparing corporate proﬁts to worker pay, we can look at 
the pay difference between chief executive ofﬁcers (CEOs) and workers. 
The graph below shows the ratio of average CEO compensation to 
the average pay of “rank-and-ﬁle” workers, in several industrialized 
countries. The ratios are based on data from 2011 and 2012.
The results: In the United States, average CEO pay is more than 350 times higher than 
average worker pay. (This difference has rapidly increased in the past 
50 years—in the mid-1960s average CEO pay was only about 20 times 
that of the average worker.) In other industrialized countries, CEOs today 
make signiﬁcantly more than rank-and-ﬁle workers, but pay differences 
are not as pronounced. For example, in France CEOs make, on average, 
100 times more than workers, while in Denmark CEOs make about 50 
times worker pay.

27. ABSOLUTE POVERTY
What it is: The $1-per-day poverty line has been deﬁned by the United Nations as 
a measure of absolute poverty. One of the Millennium Development 
Goals set by the United Nations is to halve the number of people in the 
world living below this poverty line between 1990 and 2015. This goal 
has already been met, mainly due to progress in China and India. We 
discuss poverty and economic development in Chapter 32.
The results: Note that this is the only graph in this chapter that does not include the 
United States or any other developed countries (essentially no one in 
developed countries lives below the dollar-a-day poverty line). A majority 
of people do live below that poverty line in 12 countries, including 
Rwanda, Nigeria, Mozambique, and Mali. About one-third of India’s 
population and 13 percent of China’s population still live below the dollar-
a-day poverty line. A small portion of the population lives in absolute 
poverty in Argentina, Hungary, Poland, Thailand, and Uruguay.

28. FOREIGN AID
What it is: In 1970, the “economically advanced” countries agreed to a United 
Nations resolution on foreign aid to developing countries. The resolution 
set a target for ofﬁcial development assistance (ODA) of 0.7 percent of 
gross national income (GNI). ODA is deﬁned as government ﬂows to 
promote economic development and welfare in developing countries. 
The 0.7 percent target has been reafﬁrmed at subsequent international 
meetings. We discuss the role of foreign aid in promoting economic 
development in Chapter 32.
The results: In 2012 only ﬁve countries met the 0.7 percent target: Luxembourg, 
Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands. ODA from the United 
States was 0.19 percent of GNI. Italy and Greece had the lowest ODA 
percentage, at 0.13 percent. Note that ODA does not include private 
charity donations or non-governmental organizations, only ofﬁcial aid 
given by governments.

29. INTERNET USERS
What it is: The percentage of people who have access to the Internet provides an 
indication of a country’s level of technological development. As we 
discuss in Chapter 32, technology has long been recognized as one of 
the drivers of economic growth.
The results: Access to the Internet may not be as widespread as you think. While near-
universal access occurs in a few countries, such as Iceland, Norway, and 
the Netherlands, in most developed countries access rates are about 70–85 
percent. Middle-income countries generally have access rates around 
30–50 percent. Forty countries, most of them poor African countries, 
have access rates of less than 10 percent.

30. EDUCATIONAL PERFORMANCE
What it is: Next we look at the educational performance of students in different 
countries. To compare across countries, we present data from the 
Programme for International Student Assessment, which administers 
standardized math, science, and reading tests to 15-year-olds in over 
60 countries every three years. The graph below provides results 
from the science test. The country rankings were relatively similar 
for the math and reading tests, with some variations (e.g., the United 
States ranked seventeenth on the reading test and thirty-ﬁrst on the 
math test).
The results: Students in Asian countries tended to achieve the highest test scores, 
including China, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea. Among European 
countries, students received high scores in Finland, the Netherlands, 
and Germany. The scores from the United States were average for 
developed countries. For less developed countries, scores tended to 
be lower.

31. LIFE EXPECTANCY
What it is: Average life expectancy at birth is a common measure of health outcomes 
in a country. We discuss health as one component of well-being indices 
in Chapter 21 and as a topic of economic development in Chapter 32.
The results: Life expectancy at birth now exceeds 80 years in over 20 countries, 
including Japan, France, Spain, and Greece. For a developed country, 
the United States has a comparatively low life expectancy, even lower 
than some middle-income countries such as Costa Rica, Cuba, and 
Chile. Life expectancy is the lowest, below 50 years, in several African 
countries, including Zambia, Sierra Leone, and Lesotho.

THE CONTEXT FOR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
32. SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING
What it is: Researchers are increasingly using surveys to measure well-being or 
happiness directly. The most common approach is to ask people to rate 
their overall satisfaction with their lives, on a scale from 1 (dissatisﬁed) 
to 10 (satisﬁed). The responses are referred to as “subjective well-being.” 
We discuss subjective well-being in more detail in Chapter 21.
The results: According to the most recent data, which cover 57 countries, Colombia 
has the highest level of average subjective well-being. Other relatively 
happy countries include Norway, Mexico, Canada, and Guatemala. 
Happiness levels in the United States are about average for a developed 
country. Happiness levels are relatively low in the poorest developing 
countries, such as Iraq, Zambia, and Rwanda, as well as Eastern European 
countries, such as Bulgaria, Ukraine, and Romania.

33. CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS PER CAPITA
What it is: Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important gas responsible for global 
climate change. CO2 is emitted whenever fossil fuels are burned. Scientiﬁc 
analysis indicates that the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere is 
raising global temperatures, leading to negative impacts on human 
societies and ecosystems. CO2 per capita gives us an idea of how much 
the average person in a county is affecting the environment. We learn 
more about CO2 and climate change in Chapter 33.
The results: The countries with the highest CO2 emissions per capita are several oil-
producing countries, including Qatar (the highest, at 44 tons per person), 
Kuwait, and Bahrain. The United States has the tenth-highest emissions 
per capita, around 17 tons per person. Emissions per person in European 
countries such as the UK and Germany are less than half of U.S. levels. 
While China is the world’s largest emitter of CO2 overall, on a per-capita 
basis its emissions are only one-third of those in the United States. CO2 
emissions are negligible in the world’s poorest countries.

THE CONTEXT FOR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
34. LOCAL AIR QUALITY
What it is: While CO2 emissions contribute to climate change, breathing air with 
elevated levels of CO2 does not cause any adverse health effects. Local air 
pollutants, on the other hand, can cause numerous health effects, including 
asthma, lung cancer, and heart problems. One of the most important local 
air pollutants is particulate matter, which is emitted from power plants, 
industrial factories, motor vehicles, and other sources. Particulate matter 
pollution can be reduced through effective environmental regulations and 
technology. We discuss pollution further in Chapters 13 and 33.
The results: A country with high CO2 emissions does not necessarily have poor local air 
quality. The United States is a prime example—CO2 emissions are high, but 
local air quality is relatively good due to environmental laws and modern 
technologies. Other developed countries have as good, or better, local 
air quality. Developing countries can have good or poor local air quality, 
depending on their level of development, regulations, and technologies.

Economic Activity in Context
There are many reasons to take an introductory economics course. One reason might be to 
satisfy a course requirement. Another is that some knowledge of economics may help you get 
a rewarding job. More broadly, studying economics can help you understand a variety of issues 
that are likely to be important in your life, such as taxes, the environment, and health care. 
The overall goal of this book is to give you tools and insights to help you understand how 
the economy works—and, to some degree, to encourage you to think about what a “better” 
economy might be, and how it could be achieved. Of course, different people will have 
different ideas about what they want in an economy. Questions that will elicit a wide variety 
of answers include the following:

These are all difﬁcult questions, and one of the objectives of an introductory economics course 
is to provide some new ways of thinking about them. The study of economics can help us to 
achieve our goals as individuals, and to create a society in which we are satisﬁed to live.
One of the things the list of questions asks you to think about is goals, and tradeoffs among 
goals. As an individual you are familiar with this idea: You surely want to get good grades, 
but you also want to have spare time to spend with your friends and family. Societies also 
operate in relation to goals, and are often required to make choices to come up with the proper 
balance—which frequently requires making trade-offs. 
If we want better health care and a clean environment and national security and conﬁdence 
that present policies are not creating serious future economic problems, how can we ﬁrst 
deﬁne what tradeoffs exist, and then negotiate among them? Economics has much to teach 
us about this. Some of the tradeoffs we will consider are measured in dollars, but, as we will 
soon see, economics is about much more than money.

CHAPTER 1 — ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN CONTEXT
1. OUR STARTING POINT
Although this book is divided into two parts, it is helpful to start with an overview of the 
whole. Economics is the study of how people manage their resources to meet their needs 
and enhance their well-being. For convenience (and for other reasons, related to the history 
of economic thought), the ﬁeld of economics is normally divided into two subﬁelds. 
Microeconomics is the subﬁeld that focuses on activities that occur within and among 
the major economic in a society, such as individuals, households and communities, 
governments and nonproﬁt organizations, and for-proﬁt businesses. Macroeconomics, the 
other main subﬁeld of economics, adopts an overview, focusing on understanding national 
and international trends and ﬂuctuations in economic activity taken as a whole.
The dividing line between micro- and macroeconomics is not always sharp. The ﬁrst half of 
this book focuses mainly on microeconomics, while the second half presents macroeconomics, 
using many of the concepts developed in the ﬁrst half as well as new concepts and analyses. 
In this introductory chapter we will discuss some over-arching issues that concern the whole 
ﬁeld of economics. 
We will begin by looking carefully at the deﬁnition of economics that was just given. The 
“resources” mentioned there include natural resources such as trees, coal, and air, as well 
as human-made productive resources such as factories, vehicles, computers, and roads. Our 
resources also include our knowledge and skills, ﬁnancial resources, and even the social 
relationships that improve the quality of our lives. Economists refer to these as different 
types of capital (as discussed in the next section).   
Our “needs” obviously include our basic requirements for food, shelter, and physical 
security. Beyond that, different people may have different views about what constitutes a 
“need.” Some people may think that having their own car is a “need,” while others may see 
it as a luxury. We discuss this issue in more detail below.
Finally, we use the term well-being to broadly describe a good quality of life. Beyond 
meeting our “needs,” virtually everyone desires such things as adequate food and shelter, 
sufﬁcient leisure time, good friends, and various kinds of freedom. 
Discussion Questions
1. In which social issues are you most interested? How do you think that economics might 
help you understand these issues?
2. Thinking further about the social issues in which you are interested, do you see economics 
as part of the problem or part of the solution? Is it possible that economics can be both—
responsible for social problems yet also potentially part of a solution?
2. THE GOALS OF AN ECONOMY
It is not an exaggeration to say that the study of the economy—what you are now embarking 
on—can make a signiﬁcant difference in how the economy actually functions. In recent his-
tory, economic beliefs, advice, and policies have indeed been very inﬂuential in shaping the 
kind of world we live in. Behind the advice and policies that are proposed by economists, 
and assessed by politicians and citizens, there is the question of goals. In order to understand 
what goals (overt or hidden) may be pursued by economists we need to ask a deeper question: 
What is the goal, or the purpose, of the economy itself? 
In the deﬁnition of economics given earlier you can ﬁnd an implicit answer to this question: 
the purpose of the economy is to enable people to manage their resources to meet their needs 
and enhance their well-being. The remainder of this section will look at what is involved 
in raising such questions, to start with, and will then go on to discuss a variety of ways of 
understanding the goals of an economy.

study of how people 
manage their re-
sources to meet their 
needs and enhance 
their well-being

THE GOALS OF AN ECONOMY 
41
2.1 POSITIVE AND NORMATIVE QUESTIONS
Social scientists often make a distinction between two kinds of questions. Positive ques-
tions concern issues of fact, or “what is.” Normative questions have to do with goals and 
values, or “what should be.” For example, “What is the level of poverty in our country?” is 
a positive question, requiring descriptive facts as an answer. “How much effort should be 
given to poverty reduction?” is a normative question, requiring analysis of our values and 
goals. In our study of economics, we often ﬁnd that positive and normative questions are 
inevitably intertwined. For example, both of the questions just posed require that we start 
with a deﬁnition of poverty. To achieve this, we need to combine facts about income and 
wealth with a normative assessment of where to draw the poverty line. Life rarely offers us 
a neat distinction between “what is” and “what ought to be.” More often, we have to deal 
with a combination of the two.
Positive statements also sometimes carry normative implications. Consider the statement: 
“The total share of federal taxes paid by the top 1 percent of households, by income, has risen 
from 14.2 percent in 1980 to 22.3 percent in 2009.”1
This is a positive statement, but it seems to suggest that taxes on the top 1 percent have 
increased rather dramatically and that further tax increases might be unfair. But is this really 
true? As we discover in more detail in Chapter 12, a more complete analysis reveals that the 
main reason that the share of taxes paid by the richest 1 percent has risen so much is that this 
group is now receiving a much larger share of all income. So we need to be careful about 
coming to normative conclusions based on incomplete or misleading positive statements.
Although much of this textbook is concerned with positive issues, we have, in deﬁning the 
objective of economics as enhancing well-being, begun with a normative statement. People disagree 
about what it means to “enhance well-being.” Economic actions that we take are all signiﬁcantly 
affected by our goals and values. When we study, for example, how business decisions are made, 
we need to understand what might motivate all the people involved—business owners, workers, 
and their customers. Thus it is helpful for us to think further about our goals.
2.2 INTERMEDIATE AND FINAL GOALS
A useful way to look at goals is to rank them in a kind of hierarchy. Some are intermediate 
goals—that is, they are not ends in themselves but are important because they are expected 
to serve as the means to further ends. Goals that are sought for their own sake, rather than 
because they lead to something else, are called ﬁnal goals. For example, you might strive to 
do well in your courses as an intermediate goal, toward the ﬁnal goal of getting a good job. 
Of course, we might also think of the goal of “getting a good job” as itself intermediate to 
other ﬁnal goals, such as satisfaction, status, or well-being.
2.3 TRADITIONAL ECONOMIC GOALS
Before taking this course, you probably thought that economics is mostly about money and 
wealth. Although it is true that many economists spend their lives studying these topics, in 
this book we take the position that these are intermediate, as opposed to ﬁnal, goals. We ﬁrst 
consider the goals that economics has traditionally emphasized and then go on to consider 
how those relate to our ﬁnal goals.
Adam Smith and the Goal of Wealth
Adam Smith (1723–1790) emphasized the word wealth in the title of his famous book An 
Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (published in 1776). Wealth is 
often deﬁned as the net value of all the material and ﬁnancial assets owned by an individual. 
Is wealth really what economics is about? Those who seek to enhance their country’s wealth 
generally do so because they have a notion that a wealthier country is in some way stronger, 
intermediate goal: 
a goal that is desirable 
because its achievement 
will bring you closer to 
your ﬁnal goal(s)
ﬁnal goal: a goal that 
requires no further 
justiﬁcation; it is an 
end in itself
wealth: the net value 
of all the material and 
ﬁnancial assets owned 
by an individual
positive questions: 
questions about how 
things are
normative ques-
tions: questions 
about how things 
should be
assets: property 
owned by an indi-
vidual or company

42 
CHAPTER 1 — ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN CONTEXT
better, safer, or happier. Here, the relevant ﬁnal goals might be strength, virtue, safety, or 
happiness. Similarly, an individual might seek wealth, or a good job, as an intermediate goal 
leading to such ﬁnal goals as security, comfort, power, status, or pleasure.
The variety of ﬁnal goals held by different individuals is sometimes used as a reason for 
viewing the accumulation of wealth as the sole purpose of economics. Implicitly or explicitly, 
this position rests on the normative argument that material wealth is a nearly universal 
intermediate goal because it can be used to pursue so many ﬁnal goals.
In Smith’s time, the vast majority of people lived in conditions of desperate poverty. 
Although about a billion people on earth still struggle with poverty on a daily basis, economic 
advancement in the past couple of centuries allows many people to focus on goals other than 
acquiring more wealth. Moreover, we are coming to recognize that the continual expansion 
of human economies in a ﬁnite material world has costs as well as beneﬁts. Looking at the 
complex fallout of our achievements—including environmental degradation, stresses felt by 
families, and other social ills—it is clear that promotion of material wealth without concern 
for the ends to which wealth is used, or for the consequences of the manner in which wealth 
is pursued, may in fact work against the ﬁnal goals that we most desire to achieve.
Recent Trends and the Goal of Efﬁciency
Most economists have focused on economic efﬁciency as a key goal in economic policy-
making. An efﬁcient process is one that uses the minimum value of resources to achieve a 
desired result. Or to put it another way, efﬁciency is achieved when the maximum value of 
output is produced from a given set of inputs. Given this focus, many economists have seen 
their role as advising policymakers on how to make the economy as efﬁcient as possible.
One appealing aspect of the goal of efﬁciency is that apparently everyone can agree on it. 
Who in his right mind would argue for using more resources than necessary or having less 
of something good when more is possible at the same cost? Because it seems so obvious that 
efﬁciency is a good thing, aiming for it is often thought of as a purely technical and scientiﬁc 
exercise, one based on positive analysis. This is not actually the case, however, because 
regarding efﬁciency as a goal involves a very important normative judgment: A standard of 
value must be adopted before the deﬁnition of efﬁciency can be applied.
Money is the standard of value that has traditionally been used in economics. 
Speciﬁcally, the commonest economic deﬁnition of value has been that of market value—
that is, price. Using this standard, an economist would say that resources are being used 
most efﬁciently when the market value of the resulting outputs is maximized. “More is 
always better,” it is assumed, where the “more” is composed of things that people are 
willing to pay for.
This deﬁnition of efﬁciency is not a simple matter of positive fact; when examined, it 
clearly includes some normative assumptions. First, it is based on an implicit acceptance 
of the current distribution of wealth and income. Because a person’s willingness to pay for 
something is obviously inﬂuenced by his or her ability to pay, in general those with the most 
money will disproportionately determine what is an economically “efﬁcient” allocation of 
resources. For example, if the aggregate willingness to pay of high-wealth households for 
luxury cars exceeds the willingness to pay of lower-income households for basic health care, 
then the efﬁcient allocation would tilt toward production of luxury cars over provision of 
basic health care.
Second, this deﬁnition of efﬁciency assumes that nothing has value unless humans are 
willing to pay for it. In other words, nothing has intrinsic value and should exist for its own 
sake regardless of whether people place monetary value on it. But perhaps certain things 
should have intrinsic value, such as the right of nonhuman species to exist or goals like 
freedom or fairness.
economic efﬁ-
ciency: the use of 
resources, or inputs, 
such that they yield 
the highest possible 
value of output or the 
production of a given 
output using the low-
est possible value of 
inputs

 
THE GOALS OF AN ECONOMY 
43
Other standards could be used instead to measure value. Many things that we value 
are not bought and sold in markets: Health, fairness, and ecological sustainability are 
examples. Policies directed toward producing the highest value of these outputs from 
given inputs may be quite different from policies designed simply to maximize the market 
value of production. Likewise, focusing only on minimizing the monetary costs of inputs 
may lead to actions with high social and environmental costs. Thinking of efﬁciency only 
in terms of market value can lead to neglect of other, perhaps more urgent considerations 
(see Box 1.1).
2.4 COMPONENTS OF WELL-BEING
We deﬁne economics in terms of enhancing well-being, but what exactly do we mean by 
this? We have mentioned that well-being is about a good quality of life, recognizing that 
this concept has many normative components. But we suggest that some components of 
well-being are common to all living things. Evolution has instilled in all living creatures a 
preference for survival, along with an aversion to pain, hunger, thirst, and other sensations 
that signal a threat to survival.
Evolution has operated not upon individuals but upon gene pools. Thus the survival 
imperative works to motivate behavior that will enhance group, as well as individual, survival. 
In the human species, the group survival imperative is expressed through culture, values, 
and goals. Thus it is normal for human beings to hold values that would lead us to preserve 
the health of the society in which we live as well as the health of the environment, on which, 
ultimately, the future survival of our species depends.
We can distinguish between the things that make life possible (our true “needs,” or survival 
issues) and the things that we feel make life worth living (quality-of-life, or well-being, issues). 
Even this distinction involves some normative judgments. Some evidence indicates that when 
BOX 1.1 GOALS BEYOND EFFICIENCY
The point that efﬁciency deﬁned in terms of market 
value is rarely the only important goal is vividly illus-
trated in a story that a now-eminent economist always 
tells at the ﬁrst session of a new class.
After he finished graduate school, this young 
man’s ﬁrst job was to advise the government of a 
rice-growing country where it should put its research 
efforts. He was told that two modern techniques for 
rice milling had been developed elsewhere and was 
asked to calculate which of these two technologies 
should be selected for development. The young econo-
mist analyzed the requirements for producing a ton of 
rice under each of the two competing technologies. 
Each of them used a mixture of labor, machinery, 
fuel, and raw materials. He calculated the monetary 
costs for these inputs, and, ﬁnding that Technology A 
could produce a ton of rice at slightly less cost than 
Technology B, he recommended that the government 
invest in the more “efﬁcient” Technology A.
Returning a few years later, the economist was hor-
riﬁed to discover what had happened when the country 
implemented his suggestion. It turned out that the 
traditions of that country included strict norms for the 
division of labor: speciﬁcally, what work women were 
allowed to do and what was deﬁned as men’s work. 
Technology B would have been neutral in this regard, 
maintaining the same ratio of “male jobs” to “female 
jobs” as had existed before. Technology A, however, 
eliminated most of the women’s work opportunities. 
In a society where women’s earnings were a major 
contributor to food and education for children, the 
result was a perceptible decline in children’s nutrition 
levels and school attendance.
Charged with determining which technology was 
best, the young economist had not asked, “Best for 
what?” Instead, he made an implicit assumption that 
the only ﬁnal goal was maximizing output and that 
the only intermediate goal he had to worry about was 
efﬁciency in resource use. He has subsequently told 
several generations of economics students, “Nobody 
told me to look beyond efﬁciency, deﬁned in terms 
of market costs—but I’ll never neglect the family and 
employment effects again, even when my employer 
doesn’t ask about them.”

CHAPTER 1 — ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN CONTEXT
Table 1.1 A Potential List of Final Goals
Satisfaction of basic physical needs, including nutrition and care adequate for survival, growth, 
and health, as well as a comfortable living environment
Security: assurance that one’s basic needs will continue to be met throughout all stages of life, as 
well as security against aggression or unjust persecution
Happiness: the opportunity to experience, reasonably often, feelings such as contentment, 
pleasure, enjoyment, and peace of mind
Ability to realize one’s potential in as many as possible of the following dimensions of 
development: physical, intellectual, moral, social, aesthetic, and spiritual
A sense of meaning in one’s life—a reason or purpose for one’s efforts
Fairness in the distribution of life possibilities, and fair and equal treatment by social institutions 
(fairness is a universal goal despite cross-cultural differences in how it is deﬁned or assessed)
Freedom in making personal decisions (limited by decision-making capacity, as in the case of 
children); also, not infringing on the freedom of others
Participation: opportunity to participate in the processes in which decisions are made that affect 
the members of one’s society
Good social relations, including satisfying and trustful relations with friends, fellow citizens, family, 
and business associates, as well as respectful and peaceful relations among nations
Ecological balance: preserving natural resources, and where needed, restoring them to a healthy 
and resilient state 
the things that make life worth living are removed, many individuals go against the dictates 
of survival and even risk their own lives for a higher purpose (see Box 1.2).
In Table 1.1, we present one possible list of the final goals of economic activity, 
summarizing the careful reﬂection of a number of thinkers but not attempting to represent a 
ﬁnal consensus. The ﬁrst ﬁve goals on the list are related to individual concerns; the last ﬁve 
are related to social concerns. Some of the goals (such as the ﬁrst one) involve making life 
possible, some (such as the third) involve making life worthwhile, and yet others involve both 
types of concerns. You may believe that some of the elements on this list are less important 
than others or could even be omitted, or you may believe that other important goals should 
be added. Normative analysis is not something that is set in stone forever; rather, it develops 
with reﬂection, discussion, experience, and changing circumstances. In any case, it is clear 
BOX 1.2 GOALS BEYOND SURVIVAL
A simple view of evolution might suggest that the 
individual survival imperative would always prevail 
over any other motives. Yet even among animals this 
is not true, as illustrated by stories of dogs that lie 
down and die when they have lost their master or of 
birds courting danger as they try to lure a predator 
away from the young in their nest.
Many famous stories of human heroism also il-
lustrate human choices for quality of life over life 
itself or the sacriﬁce of present survival for the sake of 
future generations. A true story of such a choice oc-
curred during World War II, when Leningrad (now St. 
Petersburg) was under siege and starvation was wide-
spread. A researcher at the university who had been 
developing improved strains of seeds locked himself in 
his laboratory. At the end of the war, his starved body 
was found there, among the containers of seed corn 
that he had protected for future generations.

that any reasonable discussion of the quality of life must go beyond the simple notions of 
wealth or efﬁciency.
2.5 ECONOMICS AND WELL-BEING
Economic activity is not, of course, the only ingredient that goes into creating well-being. 
Economics cannot make you fall in love, for example, or prevent you from being in a car 
accident. But economic factors can help to determine whether your job leaves you with the 
time and energy to date, whether your car has advanced safety features, and whether you have 
access to medical treatment. A well-functioning economy is one that operates to increase the 
well-being of all its members.
In Table 1.1, we have suggested for your consideration one plausible list of ﬁnal goals to 
be taken into account in guiding economic activity. Economic activities are often necessary 
to promote our ﬁnal goals, but economic activities can also sometimes create “ill-being” 
instead of well-being, whether because of conﬂicts among goals or because of unintended 
consequences. However, some economic activities directed toward one goal have consequences 
that enhance the achievement of other goals. For example, doing work that is believed to 
contribute something positive in the world can add signiﬁcantly to people’s happiness and 
their ability to realize their potential, at the same time as it brings in the income that permits 
the satisfaction of their basic needs.
Conﬂicts Among Goals
If the goal of immediate enjoyment is given too much emphasis, economic activity can actu-
ally decrease health and long-term happiness. A supermarket checkout counter offers a good 
example. Appealing displays of unhealthy snack foods may offer short-term satisfaction, but 
the temptation of immediate gratiﬁcation may lead us, even if we are fully informed about 
the consequences, to make decisions that are unhealthy in the long term.
In addition to tradeoffs between immediate and longer-term impacts, we often also 
face conﬂicts among our goals. For example, a current public health debate concerns 
whether people with contagious, antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis or dangerous new 
illnesses such as bird ﬂu should be required to accept hospital services—in locked wards, 
if necessary. In this case, we see that the social goal of a physically healthy population 
and the goal of freedom seem to demand opposite approaches. Likewise, an employer 
may need to decide between trying to pressure workers to produce the largest possible 
quantity of some product and wanting to help employees realize their intellectual and 
social potential on the job.
Unintended Consequences: An Introduction to Externalities
An economic actor, or economic agent, is an individual or organization engaged in one 
or more of four economic activities (explained in detail below)—resource maintenance, 
and the production, distribution, or consumption of goods and services. Although aimed 
at achieving a goal, such activity may also produce unintended side effects. Some of the 
impacts are harmful, such as air pollution that is emitted in the course of production. Nega-
tive consequences of an economic activity that affect those who are not directly involved 
in the activity are called negative externalities. In the case of a negative externality like 
air pollution, neither the ﬁrm emitting the pollution nor the consumers buying its products 
is likely to take the externality into account. But as economists, we need to consider the 
impacts of the externality on the broader well-being of society. We discuss negative exter-
nalities, particularly in relation to environmental issues, in more detail in Chapter 13.
Some of the unintended consequences of economic activity increase well-being. Positive 
externalities are the beneﬁcial effects of an economic activity that accrue to those who are 
economic actor 
(economic agent): 
an individual or or-
ganization involved 
in the economic 
activities of resource 
maintenance or the 
production, distribu-
tion, or consumption 
of goods and services
negative externali-

fects, or unintended 
consequences, of 
economic activity that

fects, or unintended 
consequences, of 
economic activity that 
accrue to those who 
are not among the eco-
nomic actors directly 
involved in the activity

CHAPTER 1 — ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN CONTEXT
not directly involved in the activity. A college education is an example of an economic activity 
that generates positive externalities. Although education can be viewed as an economic 
transaction between the educational institution and the student, society as a whole beneﬁts 
because college-educated people are likely to be more productive and more informed as 
citizens in the democratic process.
Discussion Questions
1. You have evidently made a decision to dedicate some of your personal resources in time 
and money to studying college economics. Which of the goals listed in Table 1.1 was 
most important to you (and perhaps to your family or community, if they were involved) 
in making this decision? Did any of the other goals ﬁgure in this decision? If you were to 
write up a list of your own ﬁnal goals, how would it differ from Table 1.1?
2. Certain drugs such as heroin act on the brain to produce intense, temporary feelings of 
euphoria or pleasure. Some of them are physically addictive and cause people to lose 
interest in everything except getting another dose of the drug. Do these drugs add to well-
being? Discuss.
3. THE ISSUES THAT DEFINE ECONOMICS
In discussing goals, we have addressed the question of what economics is for—what its pur-
pose is. Now we summarize what economics is about: what activities it covers, and which 
questions it addresses.
3.1 THE FOUR ESSENTIAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES
We think of an activity as “economic” when it involves one or more of four essential tasks 
that allow us to meet our needs and enhance our well-being.
Resource maintenance means preserving or improving the resources that contribute to 
the enhancement of well-being. As we mentioned earlier, these resources may be physical, 
as in the case of natural resources and manufactured products, but they also include the 
knowledge and skills of individuals and the social relations and institutions that underpin 
economic activity. Forestry projects that plant trees for future use are one common example 
of resource maintenance, but there are many others. Child care and education prepare people 
for future economic activity as well as directly improving well-being. Other examples of 
resource maintenance include ﬁguring out how much oil to extract from an oil ﬁeld now and 
how much to leave for later; maintaining the transportation infrastructure (subways, roads, 
etc.) of a city; and, in a factory, keeping the machinery in good repair and maintaining the 
necessary knowledge, skill levels, and morale of the employees.
Production is the conversion of some of these resources into usable products, which may 
be either goods or services. Goods are tangible objects, such as bread and books; services 
are intangibles, such as TV broadcasting, teaching, and haircuts. Popular bands performing 
music, recording companies producing CDs and MP3s, local governments building roads, 
and individuals cooking meals are all engaged in the economic activity of production.
The economic activity of production converts some resources, which we call inputs, into new 
goods and services, which we refer to as outputs. This conversion is a ﬂow that takes place over 
a period of time (See Box 1.3). Some goods, such as machines and computers, are produced to 
assist in the production of other goods and services. The way in which production occurs depends 
on available technologies. Production processes can also lead to undesirable outputs, such as 
waste products. We consider only useful outputs to be economic goods and services.
Distribution is the sharing of products and resources among people. In contemporary 
economies, distribution activities take two main forms: exchange and transfer. When 
you hand over money in exchange for goods and services, you are engaging in exchange. 
resource mainte-
nance: preserving 
or improving the re-
sources that contrib-
ute to the enhance-
ment of well-being, 
including natural, 
manufactured, human, 
and social resources
production: the 
conversion of re-
sources into goods and 
services
inputs: resources that 
go into production
outputs: the results of 
production
waste products: out-
puts that are not used 
either for consumption 
or in a further produc-
tion process 
distribution: the 
sharing of products 
and resources among 
people
exchange: the trad-
ing of one thing for 
another
transfer: the giving of 
something, with noth-
ing speciﬁc expected 
in return

 
THE ISSUES THAT DEFINE ECONOMICS 
47
People are generally much better off if they specialize in the production of a limited range 
of goods and services and meet most of their needs through exchange than if they try to 
produce everything that they need themselves. (We study this in more detail in Chapter 7 of 
this book.) Distribution also takes place through one-way transfers, in which something is 
given with nothing speciﬁc expected in return. Local school boards, for example, distribute 
education services to students in their districts, tuition-free (although public education is, of 
course, supported by tax revenues).These sorts of nonmonetary transfers are called in-kind 
transfers.
BOX 1.3 STOCKS VERSUS FLOWS
When noneconomists use the term “stock,” they usually 
mean ownership shares in enterprises that are traded 
on the “stock market.” To an economist, however, the 
concept of a stock refers to something as it is measured 
at a particular point in time. For example, the amount of 
water in a bathtub can be measured at one particular 
instant, and that quantity would be considered a stock. 
The number of computers in an ofﬁce at ten o’clock on 
Tuesday morning is a stock, as is the number of trees in 
a forest at two o’clock on Saturday afternoon.
stock: something whose quantity can be mea-
sured at a point in time
In contrast to stocks, ﬂows are measured over 
a period of time. For example, the water that goes 
into a bathtub from a faucet is a ﬂow; its quantity 
can be measured per minute or per hour. The num-
ber of computers purchased by an ofﬁce over the 
course of this month or this year is a ﬂow. So is the 
number of computers sold or junked over a period 
of time. As trees grow or are cut down or felled by 
lightning, these ﬂows add to or subtract from forest 
resources.
ﬂow: something whose quantity can be measured 
over a period of time
Flows are like a movie; stocks are like a still photo-
graph. Flows can either add to stocks or decrease them. 
Figure 1.1 is a generalized stock-ﬂow diagram, 
which shows how ﬂows change the level of a stock over 
time, either by adding to it or taking away from it.
stock-ﬂow diagram: an illustration of how 
stocks can be changed, over time, by ﬂows
For example, the balance in your checking account 
at the beginning of the month is a stock value. The 
deposits and withdrawals you make to your checking 
account are ﬂows; your bank statement will tell you what 
the various ﬂows were during a month. The “ending 
balance” listed on the statement is a stock value.
Figure 1.2 gives an alternative representation of the 
relation of stocks and ﬂows, this time showing a stock 
at only one point in time. Like water ﬂowing through 
the tap (additions) and the drain (subtractions) of a 
bathtub, ﬂows raise or lower the level of the water in 
the tub (stock).
Figure 1.1 
The General Stock-Flow Diagram
Starting from an initial quantity of a stock, ﬂows into 
and out of the stock determine how great the quantity 
is the next time the stock is measured.

CHAPTER 1 — ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN CONTEXT
Consumption is the process by which goods and services are, at last, put to ﬁnal use by 
people. In some cases, such as eating a meal or burning gasoline in a car, goods are literally 
“consumed” in the sense that they are used up and are no longer available for other uses. In 
other cases, such as enjoying art in a museum, the experience may be “consumed” without 
excluding others or using up material resources.
In macroeconomics, the activity of consumption is frequently contrasted with the resource-
maintenance activity of investment. The two activities, production and investment, are linked 
by the activity of saving, or refraining from consumption today in order to gain beneﬁts in 
the future. 
Most real-world economic undertakings involve more than one of the four economic 
activities. The trucking industry, for example, can be seen as “producing” the service of making 
goods available, physically distributing produced goods, and consuming large amounts of 
fuel—as well as a variety of mechanical inputs required to keep the trucks on the road.
Resource maintenance in particular often overlaps with production, consumption, and 
distribution. For example, the production of paper using recycled materials can be classiﬁed 
as both production, because a good is being produced, and resource maintenance, because the 
impact on natural resources is minimized. As another example, you may decide to distribute a 
memo to your coworkers via e-mail to save on paper, thus engaging in resource maintenance 
as part of the distribution process.
A ﬁnal point on the relationship between resource maintenance and the other economic 
activities is that sometimes resource maintenance means not engaging in production, 
consumption, or distribution. For example, people who make voluntary decisions to minimize 
their unnecessary consumption are maintaining resources. Although this may look like inactivity, 
including resource maintenance as an economic activity implies that minimizing some kinds 
of consumption can contribute to well-being. Throughout this textbook you will ﬁnd many 
examples and analyses of the four basic economic activities listed above. The ﬁrst half of 
the book, dealing with microeconomics, will contain the largest portion of the material on 
production and consumption. However, as we have noted, a particular aspect of production—
savings and investment—will be covered in greater depth in the second, macroeconomics, 
part of the text. The other two activities, distribution and resource maintenance (especially, 
but not exclusively, the maintenance of natural resources) will be treated in both parts.
3.2 THE FIVE KINDS OF CAPITAL
A capital stock is a quantity of any resource that is valued for its potential economic contri-
butions. Capital stocks are also often referred to as “capital assets.”
We can identify ﬁve types of capital that contribute to an economy’s productivity. Natural 
capital refers to physical assets provided by nature, such as land that is suitable for agriculture 
or other human uses, fresh water sources, healthy ocean ecologies, a resilient and diverse stock 
of wild animals and plants, and stocks of minerals and fossil fuels that are still in the ground. 
Manufactured capital means physical assets that are generated by applying human productive 
activities to natural capital. These include such things as buildings, machinery, stocks of 
reﬁned oil, transportation infrastructure, and inventories of produced goods that are waiting 
to be sold or to be used in further production. Human capital refers to individual people’s 
capacity for productive work, particularly the knowledge and skills each can personally 
bring to his or her work. Social capital means the existing institutions and the stock of trust, 
mutual understanding, shared values, and socially held knowledge that facilitates the social 
coordination of economic activity.
Lastly, there is a ﬁfth sort of resource, ﬁnancial capital, which is a fund of purchasing power 
available to economic actors. While ﬁnancial capital is not part of any physical production 
activity, it indirectly contributes to production by making it possible for people to produce 
goods and services in advance of getting paid for them. It also facilitates the activities of 
saving: refraining 
from consumption in 
the current period
capital stock: a 
quantity of any re-
source that is valued 
for its potential eco-
nomic contributions
natural capital: 
physical assets pro-
vided by nature
manufactured 
capital: physical assets 
generated by apply-
ing human productive 
activities to natural 
capital
human capital: peo-
ple’s capacity for work 
and their individual 
knowledge and skills
consumption: the 
ﬁnal use of a good or 
service to satisfy cur-
rent wants

 
THE ISSUES THAT DEFINE ECONOMICS 
49
distribution and consumption. An example of ﬁnancial capital would be a bank checking 
account, ﬁlled with funds that have been either saved up by the economic agent who owns 
it or lent to the agent by a bank.
Notice that economists’ description of “capital” is different from what you might hear 
in everyday use. In common usage, sometimes people take “capital” to mean only ﬁnancial 
capital. We hear this in everyday references to “capital markets,” “undercapitalized 
businesses,” “venture capital,” and so on. Economists take a broader view (discussed further 
in Chapter 15).
Capital stocks may increase or decrease as a consequence of natural forces, as in the case 
of a natural forest; or they may be deliberately managed by humans in order to provide needed 
inputs for the production of goods and services. When people work to increase the quantity or 
quality of resources in order to make beneﬁts possible in the future, this is what economists 
mean by investment. Advances in technology also expand or improve the stocks of capital, 
including manufactured, human, and social capital, thereby increasing the productivity of 
economic activity.
One way to understand resource maintenance is that it is about making sure that investments 
are sufﬁcient to provide an economy with a good asset base for future years and future 
generations. You, right now, are investing in your “human capital” by studying economics.
3.3 THE THREE BASIC ECONOMIC QUESTIONS
The four economic activities that we have listed give rise, in turn, to the three basic economic 
questions:
1. What should be produced, and what should be maintained?
2. How should production and maintenance be accomplished?
3. For whom should economic activity be undertaken?
For example, a family faces the problem of how much of its economic resources 
(money, credit, and so on) to use now and how much to preserve for future use. Suppose 
that members of a family decide to spend some of their money on a dinner party. They 
will have to decide “what” foods to prepare. The “how” question includes who is going to 
cook and what recipes to use. Answering the “for whom” question means deciding who 
will be invited for dinner and how to take into account the food preferences and needs of 
the various individuals.
The complexity of decision making and the number of people involved rise steeply as we 
move to higher levels of economic organization, but the questions remain the same. Businesses, 
schools, community groups, governments, and international organizations all have to settle 
the questions of what, how, and for whom.
Discussion Questions
1. Identify which kinds of capital are being maintained in the following examples of resource 
maintenance:
a. ﬁguring out how much oil to extract from an oil ﬁeld now and how much to leave for later
b. saving some of the proﬁts from a business to reinvest
c. child-care and education. 
d. maintaining the transportation infrastructure (subways, roads, etc.) of a city; 
e. starting a savings account for your children’s education
f. in a factory, keeping the machinery in good repair and maintaining the necessary knowl-
edge, skill levels, and morale of the employees
g. a forestry project that plants trees 
social capital: the 
institutions and the 
stock of trust, mutual 
understanding, shared 
values, and socially 
held knowledge that 
facilitates the social 
coordination of eco-
nomic activity
ﬁnancial capital: 
funds of purchasing 
power available to 
economic actors
investment: actions 
taken to increase the 
quantity or quality of 
a resource over time

50 
CHAPTER 1 — ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN CONTEXT
2. Classify each of the following according to which economic activity, or activities, it in-
volves, from this list: production, resource maintenance, distribution, and consumption. 
If any seem to include aspects of more than one activity, name the activities and explain 
your reasoning.
a. Harvesting a crop of corn
b. Attending college
c. Building an addition onto a factory
d. Receiving a Social Security payment
e. Sewing a button onto your jacket—or someone else’s jacket
4. ECONOMIC TRADEOFFS
Tradeoffs are a central concept in economics. When we have limited resources, we have to 
decide how to allocate them to meet competing goals. If we allocate more resources toward 
one objective, then less are available to meet other goals.
4.1 ABUNDANCE AND SCARCITY
When you think of all the abundant natural resources in our world, all the human knowl-
edge that exists, all the investments that have been made in organizing human societies, 
and the massive stock of machinery and other productive resources that have accumulated, 
you realize that the world is wealthy indeed. When you are well fed, comfortably warm, 
engaged in interesting activities, and close to those you care about, you can appreciate these 
beneﬁts. Although the distribution of resources is far from even, either across countries 
or among people within countries (a topic that we take up again in Chapters 15 and 32), 
contemporary human society as a whole still has a rich resource base on which to build. 
It is no wonder that many world religions and ethical teachings encourage gratitude for 
life’s abundance.
It may seem odd, then, that when discussing society’s choices concerning what, how, 
and for whom, many economists emphasize the notion of scarcity—that is, the notion of 
insufﬁciency. What this really means is that even with all the available resources, not all 
of our goals can be accomplished, at least not at the same time. The current capacity of a 
particular hospital, for example, may allow it to increase the number of heart transplants that 
are performed there or increase the amount of care that can be provided there for the severely 
mentally ill, but not both. If a given resource, such as an hour of your time, is dedicated to 
one activity, such as studying, then it will be unavailable for certain other activities, such as 
relaxing with your friends. Choices have to be made.
This book presents some key tools and language that can be helpful in understanding how 
choices can best be made about what to produce, how, and for whom, when current resources 
are insufﬁcient for meeting all possible current well-being goals, and also when choices need 
to be made between meeting well-being goals now and meeting them in the future.
4.2 SOCIETY’S PRODUCTION-POSSIBILITIES FRONTIER
Economists use the model of a production-possibilities frontier (PPF) to illustrate several 
important economic concepts. To make matters simple, let us assume that society is consid-
ering only two possible choices of what to produce over the coming year from its available 
resources. The classic example is to take “guns” as one output and “butter” as the other. In 
more general terms, the guns-versus-butter tradeoff can refer to the general choice of a society 
between becoming more militarized (“guns”) and becoming more civilian- or consumer-
oriented (“butter”).
Figure 1.3 shows a PPF for this case. In this graph, the quantity of “butter” produced 
over a year is measured on the horizontal (or x-) axis. The quantity of “guns” is measured 
abundance: re-
sources are abundant 
to the extent that 
they exist in plentiful 
supply

sibilities frontier

amounts of two

plished at once

on the vertical (or y-) axis. The points on the PPF curve illustrate the maximum quantities 
of guns and butter that the society could produce. For example, point A, where the curve 
intersects the x-axis, shows that this society can produce 120 units of butter if it does not 
produce any guns. Moving up and to the left, point B illustrates production, over the year, 
of 100 units of butter and 5 units of guns. (At this level of abstraction, it is not necessary 
to be speciﬁc about what is meant by “units.” You may imagine these as kilos of butter 
and numbers of guns, if you like.) Point C illustrates that the society can produce 9 units 
of guns if it decides to produce no butter. While it may seem odd to think about a society 
that only produces two goods, this ﬁgure is nevertheless helpful for illustrating several 
important economic concepts.
Scarcity. Point D in Figure 1.3 represents a production combination (80 units of butter and 
8 units of guns) that is not attainable given existing resources (or, as we will see, the present 
state of technology). To produce at that point would take more resources than the society 
currently has. The PPF is speciﬁcally deﬁned so that only those points on or inside it (the 
shaded region) represent outputs that can actually be produced.
Tradeoffs. All the points that lie on the PPF illustrate the important notion that scarcity 
creates a need for tradeoffs. Along the frontier, one can get more of one output only by 
“trading off” some of the other. Figure 1.3 illustrates the important concept of opportunity 
costs. Opportunity cost is the value of the best alternative to the choice that one actually 
makes. In this case, the cost of increasing gun production is less butter. For example, suppose 
the economy is at Point A, producing 120 units of butter and no guns, but then decides that 
it needs to produce 5 guns. Point B illustrates that after some resources have been moved 
from butter production into producing the 5 guns, the maximum amount of butter that can be 
produced is 100 units. The gain of 5 guns comes at a “cost” to the economy of a loss of 20 
units of butter. Likewise, starting from a point where the economy is producing only guns, 
the “cost” of producing more butter would be fewer guns.
Efﬁciency. Resources are used efﬁciently as long as the process by which they are used 
does not involve any waste. Points that lie on the PPF illustrate the maximum combinations 
that a society can produce from its given resources, if these are used efﬁciently. But what 
about points inside the frontier, such as point E? At point E, the economy is not producing as 
much as it could. It is producing 30 units of butter and 4 guns, even though it could produce 
more of one or the other, or even more of both. Some resources are apparently being wasted 
at point E. This could occur for at least three reasons:
1. The resources may be wasted because they are being left idle. For example, workers may 
be left unemployed, or cows could be left unmilked.
Figure 1.3 
Society’s Production Possibilities Frontier
As you select different points along the 
PPF, you see that the more you get 
of one good, the less you can have of 
the other.

CHAPTER 1 — ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN CONTEXT
2. Even if resources are fully employed, the technology and social organization applied to 
the resources may not be optimal. For example, suppose that the gun factory is poorly 
designed, so a lot of the workers’ time is wasted moving parts from one area to another. In 
this case, a better, more efﬁcient organization of the work ﬂow could increase production, 
with no increase in resources.
3. The allocation of resources between the two production activities (i.e., guns and butter) 
might not be optimal. For example, if gun factories are built on the best pasture land when 
they could just as well be built on poorer land, the ability of the economy to graze cows 
and produce butter would be hampered.
When an economy is imagined to be on the PPF, and thus producing efﬁciently, the 
only way to produce more of one good is to produce less of the other. If an economy is 
inside the PPF (producing in the shaded region), however, it is producing inefﬁciently, and 
improvements in the employment of resources, the application of available technology and 
social organization, or allocation of resources among production activities could allow it to 
move toward the frontier (i.e., to produce more of both goods).
The bowed-out shape of the curve comes from the fact that some resources are likely to be more 
suited for production of one good than for the other. We can see, for example, that the society can 
get the ﬁrst 5 guns by giving up only 20 units of butter production. Workers, for example, can be 
pulled out of butter production and set to work on relatively plentiful supplies of the materials 
most suited for guns, such as easily tapped veins of iron ore and minerals for gunpowder. Gun 
manufacturing plants can—if allocation decisions are made wisely—be built on land unsuitable 
for pasture. To produce 4 more guns (to go from point B to point C along the PPF), however, 
comes at the cost of the remaining 100 units of butter! Why is this? In order to produce more guns, 
we must pull workers off of the most productive dairy land and direct them toward increasingly 
less-accessible veins of mineral ores or to the now-crowded gun assembly lines.
Of course, we could put on the axes many other pairs of outputs, besides guns and butter, 
and still illustrate these concepts. We could look at soda and pizza, cars and bicycles, or health 
care and highways. This classic example, however, is a good one. In the real world, such guns/
butter or militarization/peacetime tradeoffs can be crucially important (see Box 1.4).
BOX 1.4 THE OPPORTUNITY COST OF MILITARY EXPENDITURES
What do military buildups and wars really cost? One 
way to look at this is to consider what else could have 
been bought with the money spent on armaments.
World military expenditures in 2013 totaled $1.75 
trillion, or 2.5 percent of world GDP. The United States 
is by far the biggest spender, accounting on its own for 
46 percent of the global total. The United Kingdom, 
France, China, and Japan are the next biggest military 
spenders. Smaller and poorer countries spend less, 
but some of the poorest countries—including Eritrea 
and Burundi—spend more on the military than they 
do on public services such as health care and educa-
tion. Where do such countries get their weapons? The 
United States and Russia are the leading suppliers of 
military goods to international markets.
Meanwhile, about 10 million children every year—
over 27,000 every day—die before they reach the age 
of 5, most of them from malnutrition and poverty. The 
Millennium Development Goals set out by the United 
Nations include eradicating extreme poverty, achieving 
universal primary education, reducing child mortality 
rates, and improving maternal health, gender equity, 
and environmental sustainability in the poorest areas 
of the world. All this comes at a cost, of course. The 
amount of money that would be needed to achieve 
these goals has been estimated to be in the range 
of $145 to $270 billion per year, that is, about 8–15 
percent of what is currently spent on arms. This level of 
funding has not been forthcoming, however, and indi-
cations are that some of the goals will not be met.
As U.S. president Dwight D. Eisenhower said 
in 1953, “Every gun that is made, every warship 
launched, every rocket ﬁred, signiﬁes in the ﬁnal sense 
a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those 
who are cold and are not clothed.”

ECONOMIC TRADEOFFS 
53
What precise combination of outputs, such as guns versus butter or health versus highways, 
should society choose to produce? The PPF does not answer this question. All points along 
the PPF are efﬁcient, in the sense that there are no wasted resources. But among the different 
efﬁcient points, such as A, B, or C, which one would produce the most social well-being? To 
determine this, we would have to know more about the society’s requirements and priorities. 
Is civilian satisfaction a high priority? Then the society would lean toward production of 
butter. Does the society fear attack by a foreign power? Perhaps then it would choose a 
point closer to the guns axis. For good social decision making, this production question 
would have to be considered alongside a full array of questions of resource maintenance, 
distribution, and consumption, because all have effects on well-being. In a society with free 
speech and democratic discussion, there is wide room for disagreement about what the best 
mix of goods might be. The PPF provides a rubric for thinking about scarcity, tradeoffs, and 
efﬁciency but does not, itself, tell us how to choose among the various economically efﬁcient 
possibilities.
4.3 TRADEOFFS OVER TIME
We have said that a PPF reﬂects possible production combinations for a given set of resources. 
This idea deserves more investigation. Do we mean that society should look at all the resources 
it has at a point in time and then strive to employ them to produce the maximum quantity of 
valued outputs over the coming year?
If we consider that achieving well-being also involves questions of how and for whom, 
as well as activities of resource maintenance, distribution, and consumption, then the 
question becomes more complex—and more interesting. For example, we generally want 
to conserve resources so that we can produce goods not only right now but also later in our 
lives. And we have an obligation to future generations to include them in our considerations 
of for whom.
Some production activities are also resource maintenance activities, of course, and these 
activities can add to the stock of resources available for the future. Investments in plant 
and equipment can provide productive capacity not just for a few months but, often, for 
years. Production of goods and services that protect the environment or that encourage the 
development of new forms of knowledge and social organization also lead to an improved 
resource base. Technological progress, in which new methods are devised to convert resources 
into products, can lead to long-run improvements in efﬁciency and productive capacity. Thus 
some kinds of production can add to the production possibilities for the future. The PPF may 
expand over time, out and to the right, making previously unobtainable points obtainable, 
as shown in Figure 1.4. With the initial PPF, points A, B, and C are attainable, but points D 
and E are unattainable. With technological progress and an expanded PPF, points D and E 
could become attainable.
Some productive activities create an ongoing ﬂow of outputs without drawing down the 
stock of capital resources, such as organic farming that maintains the nutrient levels in soil. 
Many other productive activities, however, lead to resource depletion or degradation. The 
intensive use of fossil fuels is now depleting petroleum reserves, degrading air quality, and 
contributing to global climate change. Production processes that destroy important watersheds 
and wildlife habitats are also resource depleting. Mind-numbing drudgery, work in dangerous 
circumstances, or excessively long hours of work can degrade human resources by leaving 
people exhausted or in poor mental or physical health. These kinds of productive activities 
are at odds with resource maintenance.
Taking a longer-term view, then, it is clear that getting the absolute most production, right 
now, out of the available resources is not an intelligent social goal. Decisions such as our guns 
versus butter example need to be accompanied by another decision about now versus later. 
What needs to be currently produced, what needs to be maintained, and what investments 
are needed to increase future productivity?

ress: the develop-
ment of new methods 
of converting inputs 
(resources) into 
outputs (products or 
services)

54 
CHAPTER 1 — ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN CONTEXT
The choice between current and future production can be presented in terms of a different 
PPF, as shown in Figure 1.5. In this case, the tradeoff is between current production and 
resource maintenance for the future. If society chooses point A, current production is high 
but resource maintenance for the future is low. However, choosing point B reduces current 
production but results in signiﬁcantly higher resource maintenance.
The consequences of choosing between points A and B are illustrated in Figure 1.6, where 
once again we portray a two-output PPF (such as that for guns versus butter). Now, however, 
the graph illustrates how future conditions are affected by the current choice between A and 
B. As Figure 1.6 shows, a decision to maintain more for the future, by choosing point B 
in Figure 1.5, leads to a larger set of production possibilities in future years. A decision to 
engage in less resource maintenance, shown by point A in Figure 1.5, leads to the smaller 
future PPF shown in Figure 1.6.
Of course, some will argue that advances in technology will always push out the PPF (as 
in Figure 1.4) and make up for low current resource maintenance. But this is no more than 
an assertion of belief. If this belief turns out not to be warranted, then acting on the basis of 
it may lead to large-scale, unfortunate, and irreversible consequences.

13. What is the relationship between a society’s PPF 
and resource maintenance?
EXERCISES
 1. In each of the following, indicate which of 
the four essential economic activities is taking 
place.
a. Ms. Katar, an executive at Acme Manufacturing, 
directs the cleanup of one of the company’s old 
industrial waste dump sites.
b. Mr. Ridge plants a garden in his yard.
c. Ms. Fuller hands an unemployed worker a bag 
of groceries at a local food pantry.
d. Mr. Hernandez eats lunch at a cafeteria.
 2. The notion of scarcity reﬂects the idea that re-
sources cannot be stretched to achieve all the 
goals that people desire. But what makes a par-
ticular resource “scarce”? If a resource seems to 
be in greater supply than is needed (like desert 
sand), is it scarce? If it is freely open to the use 
of many people at once (like music on the radio), 
is it scarce? What about resources such as social 
attitudes of trust and respect? Make a list of a few 
resources that clearly are scarce in the economic 
sense. Make another list of a few resources that 
are not scarce.
 3. How is the concept of efﬁciency related to the con-
cept of scarcity? Consider, for example, your own 
use of time. When do you feel that time is more, 
and when less, scarce? Do you think about how to 
use your time differently during exam week than 
you do when you are on vacation?

Useful Tools and Concepts
In order to study economics we need various analytical approaches for understanding eco-
nomic actors and their behavior. This chapter will describe three major ways to investigate 
and understand economic realities: empirical, theoretical, and historical. As part of the discus-
sion of the empirical approach, Section 1 includes a review of how to use graphs as visual 
images of abstract ideas. In applying the theoretical approach, we will also discuss the use of 
economic models. It is sometimes useful temporarily to isolate certain aspects of economic 
behavior from their larger historical and environmental context, in order to examine more 
closely the complex elements involved. This simpliﬁcation is a necessary part of economic 
models, which will be used in many places in this book.
In Section 2 we will examine two models that take different approaches to deﬁning and 
understanding the economy. Section 3 will go into more depth regarding types of economic 
activity, discussing the economic roles played by businesses, households and communities, 
governments, and non-proﬁt organizations.
1. OUR TOOLS FOR UNDERSTANDING
Here we will outline the three main modes of investigation for explaining economic phenom-
ena: empirical, theoretical, and historical.
1.1 EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION
Empirical investigation is observation and recording of speciﬁc happenings in the world. In 
economics, empirical investigation often involves numerical data. However, useful empirical 
investigation of a speciﬁc item of interest may also be represented in words or images.
When the observations take the form of showing how a variable changes over time, we 
call them time-series data. We saw important examples of time-series data in Chapter 0, in 
graphs that showed how GDP and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have grown 
over time.
We will be seeing many such graphs in this book—for price levels, employment, exchange 
rates, and other economic variables. The accompanying Graphing Review Box (Box 2.1) 
will help you refresh your skills in working with data and graphs.
It is tempting to think that if two economic variables seem empirically related to each 
other, changes in one variable are causing changes in the other. Sometimes this is true. In 
the case of the upward trends over time that we saw for both GDP and CO2 emissions, as 
shown in Chapter 0, there is causality: Growing industrial production has led, over time, to 
increasing accumulations of CO2. There are good scientiﬁc reasons to believe that the rise in 
CO2 emissions is a direct result of years of fossil fuel–intensive economic growth.

CHAPTER 2 — USEFUL TOOLS AND CONCEPTS
BOX 2.1 GRAPHING REVIEW
Empirical analysis involves collecting and interpreting 
numerical data. This review covers the two most com-
mon ways that economic data are presented in this 
book. The ﬁrst way is in a table, such as Table 2.1, 
which presents time-series data for the U.S. economy 
over the period 2000–2012. The table provides data 
each year for two variables: the annual real growth 
rate of GDP and the annual average unemployment 
rate. So we can determine from the table, for example, 
that in 2004 the unemployment rate was 5.5 percent 
and real GDP grew at a rate of 3.5 percent.

While tables can present detailed numerical data, 
it is not always obvious what is really happening by 
simply looking at a table. We could carefully study 
Table 2.1 to determine when unemployment is rising 
and when it is falling, but this is normally not the easi-
est way to observe trends over time. Instead, we can 
commonly present data in visual form, using graphs, 
to quickly “see” what is happening in an economy.
Figure 2.B1 presents a time-series graph of the un-
employment rate. Graphs have a horizontal axis (also 
called the “x-axis”) and a vertical axis (also called the 
“y-axis”). It is common practice to present time-series 
data with the time intervals on the x-axis. Presented 
this way, we can easily see that unemployment rose 
from 2000 to 2003, then fell for a few years, then 
rose signiﬁcantly to nearly 10 percent by 2010, then 
fell somewhat in 2011 and 2012.
You can test yourself by using the data in Table 2.1 
to construct a time-series graph for the GDP growth 
rate. You can do this using graph paper or a spread-
sheet application such as Microsoft Excel.

In addition to using graphs for time-series analysis 
of a single variable, we can also use graphs to explore 
the relationship between two different variables. This 
is important because it provides a way to test speciﬁc 
economic hypotheses. Referring back to Table 2.1, we 
might form the hypothesis that unemployment rates 
tend to be higher when GDP growth rates are lower. 
We call this a negative, or inverse, relationship—
when an increase in one variable is associated with a 
decrease in another variable (or, vice versa, when a 
decrease in one variable is associated with an increase 
in another variable).
Negative (or inverse) relationship: the rela-
tionship between two variables if an increase in one 
variable is associated with a decrease in the other 
variable (or vice versa)
Figure 2.B2 plots the relationship between unem-
ployment rates and GDP growth rates. Each “data 
point” on the graph tells us the values of both variables 
for a speciﬁc year. In the graph we have kept the 
unemployment rate on the y-axis, but the x-axis now 
indicates the GDP growth rate. So the data point for 
2008, for example, indicates that the unemployment 
rate was 5.8 percent (by reading across to the y-axis), 
and the GDP growth rate was –0.3 percent (by read-
ing down to the x-axis). Note that there is one data 
point for each year. You can test yourself by ﬁguring 
out which data points match which years.
A visual inspection of Figure 2.B2 can help us deter-
mine whether our hypothesis of an inverse relationship 
between unemployment and GDP growth rates is cor-
rect. We can see that when GDP growth rates were at 
their highest, 3 percent or higher, unemployment rates 
were relatively low. In general, the graph seems to 
support our hypothesis, but there are some exceptions.

For example, in the year when unemployment was 
at its maximum, in 2010, GDP growth was about 
 average at 2.4 percent. To determine more accurately 
whether our hypothesis is supported by the data, we 
would need to undertake statistical analysis, often 
called “econometrics.” If you are an economics major, 
you will likely take a future course on econometrics.
Figure 2.B2 can tell us whether our two variables are 
related, or “correlated,” but as mentioned in the text we 
cannot determine whether there is a causal relationship 
between the two variables. While we suspect that low 
GDP growth causes high unemployment, we cannot 
prove it using a graph. The causality could potentially 
be in the opposite direction—that high unemployment 
causes low GDP growth. Even if the variables seem 
related in a graph, the relationship could be random, 
or “spurious.” For example, you may have read stories 
about how the outcome of sporting events can predict 
the performance of the stock market or the winner 
of presidential campaigns. However, it seems highly 
unlikely that such relationships are causal.
The opposite of an inverse relationship is a posi-
tive, or direct, relationship. In this case, an in-
crease in one variable is associated with an increase 
in another variable—or a decrease in one variable is 
associated with a decrease in another.
Positive (or direct) relationship: the relationship 
between two variables if an increase in one variable is 
associated with an increase in the other variable
A good example of a positive relationship is be-
tween the growth rate of GDP and the growth rate of 
greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide 
and methane. When the economy is growing, manu-
facturing industries tend to produce more goods, 
people tend to ﬂy and drive more, and construction 
activity tends to increase. All these factors tend to 
increase greenhouse gas emissions.
The relationship between GDP growth and the 
growth of greenhouse gas emission is shown in 
Figure 2.B3, which includes data for 1990–2012. 
In this case, we see a reasonably clear positive 
relationship—when the economy is growing rapidly 
greenhouse gas emissions also tend to increase. 
Again, we can undertake a more sophistical statisti-
cal analysis of the positive relationship, and we can-
not demonstrate causality just by looking at a graph, 
but the graph provides strong support in favor of 
a positive relationship between the two variables.

But two variables may be related empirically (or be “correlated” with each other, to use 
the statistical term) without there being a well-deﬁned causal relationship between them. 
For example, countries with higher GDP tend to have higher reported levels of cancer. Does 
this mean that higher GDP causes cancer? No, the true relationship is between GDP and life 
expectancy. Higher GDP is broadly associated with longer life expectancy, and people who 
live longer are more likely to develop cancer at some point in their lives. The speciﬁc causes 
of cancer include genetics, environmental exposure, diet, and other factors. This provides 
an excellent example for the warning that “correlation does not necessarily imply causality.” 
In other words, the existence of an observable relationship between two economic variables 
does not imply that changes in one variable cause the changes in the other.

CHAPTER 2 — USEFUL TOOLS AND CONCEPTS
Empirical investigation creates the foundation for macroeconomic analysis. Looking at 
the data on unemployment and GDP growth, we can see, however, that more tools are clearly 
needed if economists are to try to explain, rather than simply describe, macroeconomic 
phenomena.
1.2 THEORETICAL INVESTIGATION
The adjective “empirical” is usually contrasted with “theoretical,” where the latter refers to 
statements made on the basis of abstract thought, making assumptions and logical deductions. 
Theoretical investigation is essential to macroeconomics. This book introduces a number 
of theories of how the macroeconomy operates.
Many economic theories are based on “thought experiments.” In the physical sciences, 
much theorizing is based on controlled experiments in the laboratory. While it is sometimes 
possible for economists to carry out controlled experiments at the microeconomic level 
(creating a relatively new ﬁeld of “experimental economics”), this is rarely possible in 
macroeconomics. Thus economists tend to create theories based on assumptions about 
economic agents and institutions, from which, with careful reasoning, they draw out potential 
implications for economic behavior.
In order to make it possible to build a theory, it is sometimes useful to isolate certain 
aspects of economic behavior from their larger historical and environmental context, in order 
to examine more closely the complex elements involved. A model is an analytical tool that 
highlights some aspects of reality while ignoring others. It can take the form of a simpliﬁed 
story, an image, a ﬁgure, a graph, or a set of equations, and it always involves simplifying 
assumptions. We look at some examples of economic models later in this chapter when 
we examine the basic neoclassical model and the contextual model. Other models appear 
throughout this course. 
An important part of many models is the assumption of ceteris paribus, a Latin phrase 
that means “other things equal” or “all else constant.” In order to focus on one or two 
variables, we assume that no other variables change. Of course, in the real world, things 
usually don’t stay constant. Usually after a basic model is constructed, we can vary the 
ceteris paribus assumption, to see how changes in other variables will affect the model’s 
conclusions.
Theories and models essentially simplify reality. Is this justiﬁable? It is if it gives us greater 
insight into how things actually work. A model plane, for example, cannot carry passengers 
or freight, but it can give aerodynamic engineers insights into how a real plane works and 
help them to design better features for real aircraft. In the same way, simpliﬁed models can 
help economists to understand the working of very complex real-world economies. Of course, 
economists may disagree about which models to use and as a result may come to different 
policy conclusions. In this text we try to make clear what simplifying assumptions we are 
using to build models and to indicate when there are different economic theories that may 
lead to conﬂicting policy recommendations.
1.3 HISTORICAL INVESTIGATION
Throughout the book, we also include a crucial third mode: historical investigation, which 
uses our knowledge of historical events to help explain macroeconomic phenomena. The 
Great Depression of the 1930s, major wars, the invention of computers, changing roles of 
women in the workforce, the ﬁnancial crash of 2007–8 and the severe recession that resulted, 
sometimes called the Great Recession—all are examples of historical events that have had a 
signiﬁcant macroeconomic impact.
These events will receive more attention in Parts VI–VIII of this book, dealing with 
macroeconomics, but there are many issues normally studied within microeconomics that 
are also hard to understand without some historical reference. One example is the way we

deﬁne different kinds of competition, or lack of it, in markets: We will see this in Chapter 
18, which deals with monopoly and oligopoly.
Economists have become increasingly aware that, while gathering and analyzing data and 
thinking theoretically about what could be true are valid and important tasks, knowledge of the 
real-world evolution of political, economic, and social life is indispensable to understanding 
macroeconomics.
Discussion Questions
1. Consider the following examples of investigation. For each one, indicate which mode of 
investigation it most closely represents—empirical, theoretical, or historical.
a. A biologist tries to determine the number of different species of plants found on a plot 
of rainforest
b. Albert Einstein develops his theory of relativity
c. An economist measures how GDP varies across countries
d. A sociologist examines the impact of movements for equal pay for women on women’s 
social and economic status
e. An economist states that a rise in investment will lead to a fall in unemployment
2. Model building is sometimes compared to map making. If someone asks you how to get to 
your house, what will you put on the map you draw for them? What if the question asked 
has to do with the location of the highest point in town, the town’s political boundaries, 
the public transit system, or how your dwelling links up to the local sewer system? Is it 
possible for a single, readable map to answer every possible question? Does the goal you 
have in mind for the map affect what you put on it?
2. DIFFERENT ECONOMIC THEORIES: EXAMPLES OF TWO BASIC MODELS
The discipline of economics, like most other areas of academic and public discussion, has a 
long history of varying approaches, beliefs, and conclusions. There are many different schools 
of economic thought, and we will deal with many of them in later chapters of this text,* 
but here we present two overall theoretical approaches for understanding the economy: the 
neoclassical model, which has dominated much of standard economics, and the contextual 
economics model, which is the approach taken in this text. These approaches are not mutually 
exclusive, and have some overlap, but they have different scope and emphasis, and can lead 
to different understandings of economic theory and policy. 
2.1 THE BASIC NEOCLASSICAL MODEL
The basic neoclassical model, traditionally taught in detail in most microeconomics courses 
at the introductory level, is a model of market exchange that—while abstracting away from 
many real-world factors, some of which are discussed below—portrays in a simple and 
elegant way some important aspects of markets. Neoclassical economics arose during the 
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It took the eighteenth-century classical idea 
that economies can be thought of as systems of smoothly functioning markets and expressed 
this idea in terms of formalized assumptions, equations and graphs. (The preﬁx “neo-” in 
“neoclassical” means “new.”)
In this model, the world is simpliﬁed to two kinds of economic actors. Households are 
assumed to consume and to maximize their utility (or satisfaction). Firms are assumed to 
produce and to maximize proﬁts. Households are considered the ultimate owners of all 
*The sub ﬁeld of History of Economic Thought is a valuable one; students who intend to pursue economics in more 
depth would do well to ﬁnd a course, or at least a good book, by which to orient themselves in this history. The Worldly

resources of land, labor, and capital. They rent the services of these to ﬁrms through factor 
markets, receiving monetary payments in return. Firms produce goods and services, which 
they sell to households on product markets in return for monetary payments. This model can 
be portrayed in the circular-ﬂow diagram in Figure 2.1. The two economic actors (households 
and ﬁrms) are represented by rectangles, and the activity of exchange by arrows. Flows of 
goods and services create the clockwise ﬂow of the outer circle. Flows of monetary funds, 
exchanged for these goods and services, move in the opposite direction around the inner 
circle. The model further assumes that there are so many ﬁrms and households involved in 
the market for any good or service that a situation of “perfect competition” reigns, in which 
prices are determined purely by forces of supply and demand.
In this idealized world, goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed in 
such a way that the market value of production is as high as it can be. The model combines 
important observations about markets with assumptions about human values and human 
behavior, as both producers and consumers. (In reading the following statements about the 
neoclassical model, see if you can recognize which parts are “positive” observations of facts, 
and which are assumptions, which may include a “normative” slant, toward “the way things 
ought to be.”) Full social and economic efﬁciency is said to arise because:

DIFFERENT ECONOMIC THEORIES: EXAMPLES OF TWO BASIC MODELS 
63
The circular ﬂow diagram is useful in portraying in a very simpliﬁed way two of the major 
actors (households and ﬁrms) and three of the major activities (production, exchange, and 
consumption) involved in economic life. However, it is important to recognize that the model 
leaves out some key actors and activities.
For example, while “land” is included as a factor of production, the fact that natural 
resources can be used up or polluted is not portrayed. Because of this, the circular ﬂow 
diagram is a little like a “perpetual motion machine”; the economy it portrays can apparently 
keep on generating products forever without any inputs of materials or energy. The necessity 
of resource maintenance activities is not included.
Also, the diagram only takes into account ﬂows of goods or resources that are paid for 
through the market (the inner, gray arrows show these payments). This ignores unpaid 
work and free use of natural resources, among other things. You will also notice that there 
is no role for government in this diagram. While this oversimpliﬁcation has some value, 
in allowing us to focus only on the workings of speciﬁc markets, we also want to present 
a broader picture. 
2.2 THE CONTEXTUAL MODEL
In reality, economic activities take place within environmental and social contexts. Thus we 
need a more inclusive, and more realistic, model than the one presented in Figure 2.1. This 
is illustrated in Figure 2.2.
The environmental context for economic activities includes the built environment as well 
as the natural world, but its fundamental processes are ecological. Economic activity brings 
natural resources into the economy and transforms them for human use. In the process, 
pollution and waste materials are generated, and these in turn affect the ﬂow of natural inputs 
that are available. In addition to negative externalities such as pollution and waste materials, 
economic activity can also generate some positive externalities, such as care for soils and 
forests that make them more fertile over time.
The economy also operates in a social context, one that is created and operated by human 
beings, even when they are not consciously designing it as a system. The social context 
includes history, politics, culture, ethics, and other human motivations. This social context

CHAPTER 2 — USEFUL TOOLS AND CONCEPTS
determines what constitutes acceptable economic activity. For example, we do not allow legal 
markets for human organs or certain drugs. It also determines the relative weight that a society 
attaches to the different goals discussed in Chapter 1, such as how to identify and assess a 
potential tradeoff between improving material living standards and ecological sustainability. 
As we will see in the Chapter 3 discussion of markets, much economic activity would become 
impossible without aspects of the social context such as laws, norms, trust, and honesty. In 
Figure 2.2 we show the social context as existing inside the environmental context because 
all human activities—not only those of the economic system—are ultimately completely 
dependent on the environmental context.
Instead of showing economic activity as occurring between just two actors, households 
and ﬁrms, as in Figure 2.1, our contextual approach presents economic activity as occurring 
within three “spheres.” These spheres provide a basic classiﬁcation of the major types of 
economic actors.
1. The core sphere includes households, families, and communities. Traditionally, econo-
mists have focused on the core sphere as consumers and workers, in their interactions with 
businesses. But important economic activity occurs within the core sphere. For example, 
the core sphere is where people generally raise children, prepare meals, maintain homes, 
organize leisure time, and care for mildly ill individuals.
2. The business sphere includes ﬁrms that produce goods and services for proﬁtable sale. It 
is often thought that businesses operate only to obtain proﬁts. But the ﬁnal goals of many 
businesses may extend beyond simply maximizing proﬁts.
3. The public purpose sphere includes governments as well as other organizations that seek 
to enhance human well-being without making a proﬁt. These may be anything from the 
United Nations down to a local homeless shelter.
Individuals may move among these three spheres in their economic activities. A woman 
may be a wife and mother in the core sphere, a business executive in the business sphere, 
and a volunteer for an environmental group in the public purpose sphere.
Economic activity within and between these three spheres always occurs within the social 
and environmental contexts. At the same time, our economic actions often have important 
impacts on the larger physical and social contexts. A useful understanding of economics 
must take into account the most critical interactions between the economy and its contexts, 
showing how the economy is in various ways enabled and constrained by the contexts in 
which it is embedded, and how these environmental and social inﬂuences on the economy 
are in turn affected by the economy. In the next section, we discuss economic activity in the 
three spheres in more detail.
Discussion Questions
1. Describe three situations in which economic behavior could affect its physical context and 
three ways in which economic behavior could affect its social context. How might these 
inﬂuences that the economy exerts on its contexts result in changing how the contexts, in 
turn, affect (either support or constrain) economic activity?
2. Model building is sometimes compared to map making. If you wanted to give people 
directions for reaching the place where you live, what would you put on the map that you 
drew for them? What would you put on the map you drew if someone asked you about 
good places to go hiking, where the highest point is, or how close you are to your town 
boundary? Is it possible for a single, readable map to answer every possible question? 
Does your goal for the map affect what you put on it?

THE THREE SPHERES OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY 
65
3. THE THREE SPHERES OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
As we mentioned above, economic activity takes place in three major spheres, which we 
designated as the core, public purpose, and business spheres. In other economics writings, 
the terms used are “household,” “government,” and “business.” In this text, we use the term 
“core” instead of “household” to emphasize the importance of communities, in addition to 
households, in the “core” activities described below. (Think of the maxim “It takes a village 
to raise a child.”) We use the term “public purpose” instead of “government” to include both 
government organizations and the nongovernmental nonproﬁt organizations whose activi-
ties are of growing importance in modern societies. Many economic activities are conducted 
through markets, but some activities, especially in the core sphere, take place outside of 
markets. In this chapter, we give an overall view of the three spheres and then focus on the 
nature and workings of markets in more detail in Chapter 3.
1.1 THE CORE SPHERE
Long before the invention of money, organized markets, and systems of government, hu-
man societies organized themselves along lines of kinship and community to undertake the 
economic activities essential to maintaining and improving the conditions for human life. 
The core sphere is made up of household, family, and community institutions that undertake 
economic activities, usually on a small scale, and largely without the use of money. Even 
in modern societies, the core sphere is still the primary site for raising children, preparing 
meals, maintaining homes, taking care of the mildly ill, and organizing activities among 
family members, friends, and neighbors.
One distinguishing characteristic of the core sphere is how work activities are rewarded: 
Instead of earning money, work tends to be rewarded directly by what it produces. For 
example, work in a home garden is rewarded with tomatoes, and the reward of good child 
care is a happy and healthy child. People may volunteer their services to their community 
because they recognize that living in a healthy community is important. People play cards, 
softball, or music together because they ﬁnd these activities intrinsically enjoyable. Another 
distinguishing characteristic is that activities in the core sphere are organized to respond not 
only to wants but also, importantly, to needs—unlike market activities, which respond to 
what people are able and willing to pay for (regardless of need).
The core sphere is obviously critical for subsistence economies, where extended families 
and villages may raise or make for themselves most of what they consume, with little outside 
trading. Although reliance on the core sphere has to some extent been reduced in the United 
States and many other countries by the increasing use of prepared foods, child-care centers, 
restaurants, commercial forms of entertainment, nursing homes, housecleaning services, 
and the like, it remains of central importance for the maintenance and ﬂourishing of any 
economy.
Core sphere activities, however, have been—and sometimes still are—often described as 
noneconomic or nonproductive because they generally do not produce goods and services 
for trade through a market. However, consider just one activity that takes place in the core 
sphere: the help provided by relatives, friends, and neighbors that enables seniors to remain 
in a home setting rather than entering a nursing facility. If we were to value the actual unpaid 
time invested in these activities in the United States at a low wage of $8–$9 an hour, we 
would ﬁnd that each year about $300 billion to $400 billion worth of elder care is provided 
in the core sphere—without being recorded in gross domestic product (GDP) statistics.* 
For comparison, this amount exceeds the total annual expenditures on nursing-care services, 
including both private and public spending.

66 
CHAPTER 2 — USEFUL TOOLS AND CONCEPTS
According to one estimate, between a third and half of all economic activity in industrialized 
countries consists of unpaid labor that is not counted in GDP.1 Recognizing the value of 
unpaid work is important if we are to make a comprehensive assessment of well-being. To 
quote from a recent report:
Unpaid work contributes not only to current household consumption (e.g., cooking) 
but also to future well-being (e.g., parental investments in raising children) and to 
community well-being (e.g., voluntary work). In all countries, women do more of 
such work than men, although to some degree balanced—by an amount varying across 
countries—by the fact that they do less paid work.2
When the core sphere is working effectively to support the quality of life, important goods 
and services are provided to many people, even if the scale of production in each speciﬁc 
case is quite small. Because most core sphere activities involve face-to-face interaction, 
the core sphere is the primary location in which the ability to form good social relations is 
developed.
Of course, core spheres can also work badly or inadequately. For example, responsibilities 
for children, the elderly, and ill people may be inequitably assigned between women and 
men. Such responsibilities may also overwhelm the personal resources of impoverished 
families and communities. There are limits to what can be accomplished within small-scale, 
largely informal networks of personal relations. For many economic goals, more formal and 
larger-scale organizations are also needed. The public purpose sphere is uniquely capable of 
meeting certain well-being needs.
3.2 THE PUBLIC PURPOSE SPHERE
The public purpose sphere includes governments and their agencies, as well as nonproﬁt 
organizations such as charities, religious organizations, professional associations, and 
international institutions such as the World Bank and the United Nations. They may be as 
large as a national government or an international scientiﬁc organization or as small as a 
Cub Scouts group or an organization whose only goal is the protection of a landmark build-
ing. The distinguishing characteristic of these institutions is that they exist for an explicit 
purpose related to the public good—that is, the common good of some group larger than a 
household or informal community—and they do not aim at making a proﬁt. 
Some of the larger public purpose organizations often associated with some level of 
government, are charged with purposes such as defending a country’s borders, relieving 
poverty, providing formal health care and education, protecting the natural environment, and 
stabilizing global ﬁnancial markets. Religious organizations are other well-known public 
purpose organizations, associated with governments in some countries but not in the United 
States. Small nonproﬁts may be found working on local issues such as the preservation of a 
particular park or providing homeless people with shelter.
Organizations in the public purpose sphere tend to be more formally structured than those 
in the core sphere, and usually they are more monetized, though a public purpose organization 
can lie anywhere on a spectrum of those that rely entirely on voluntary work to those that 
pay for all work done to achieve their ends. Even in the latter case, however, people will 
often accept pay for jobs in the public purpose sector that is lower than the going wages for 
comparable work in the business sphere.
The reason for this is twofold. First, public purpose organizations are often scraping by 
with ﬁnancial resources too small to achieve their goals and are therefore more careful to 
watch every dollar than is necessary in some businesses. In addition, many people are willing 
to accept lower salaries in public purpose work because they receive an additional psychic 
beneﬁt in the feeling that their work is meaningful.

THE THREE SPHERES OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY 
67
In some instances public purpose organizations offer goods and services for sale as 
businesses do, but this is generally not their primary focus. They usually raise much of their 
support by soliciting monetary contributions or, in the case of governments, requiring such 
contributions in the form of taxes or fees. Your college or university, for example, may be 
either a nonproﬁt or government entity (i.e., operated by the city, county, or state). As another 
example, public (that is, government-supported) hospitals in the United States provide 
emergency medical care to the poor and uninsured.
The public purpose sphere is able to provide goods and services that cannot, or would 
not, be adequately provided by core sphere institutions and businesses alone. Some of the 
goods and services that it provides are what economists call public goods. A public good 
(or service) is freely available to anyone (or some people could be excluded from using it 
only with difﬁculty), and use of a public good by one person does not diminish the ability of 
another person to beneﬁt from it.
For example, when a local police force helps to make a neighborhood safe, all the 
residents beneﬁt. Public roads (at least those that are not congested and have no tolls) are also 
public goods, as is national defense. Education and quality child care are in a sense public 
goods because everyone beneﬁts from living with a more skilled and socially well-adjusted 
population. A system of laws and courts provides the basic legal infrastructure on which all 
business contracting depends. We discuss public goods in more detail in Chapter 14.
The public purpose sphere is a substantial contributor to U.S. economic activity. In 2010, 
the value of the production by nonproﬁt organizations was 5.5 percent of GDP, and federal, 
state, and local governments contributed 12.3 percent of GDP—for a total share of about 
18 percent.3
The main strength of public purpose institutions is that (like core institutions) they provide 
goods and services of high intrinsic value, but (unlike core institutions) they are big enough 
to take on jobs that require broader social coordination. The provision of goods and services 
itself, and not the ﬁnancial results of these activities, remains the primary intended focus of 
public purpose organizations, in contrast to the business sphere.
Overall, a larger amount of the work that is undertaken by governments in other 
industrialized countries is taken care of by either the business or the nonproﬁt sector in the 
United States. Canada and countries in most of Europe, for example, put more government 
resources into health and social welfare than is the case in the United States. However, the 
United States has traditionally been a leader in charitable and philanthropic support for private, 
nonproﬁt organizations in this sphere.
The public purpose sphere has its weaknesses, of course. Compared to the core sphere, 
the government, in particular, is often criticized as cold and impersonal. Some parents 
prefer to home school, for example, rather than accept what they characterize as “one size 
ﬁts all” public education. Compared to for-proﬁt businesses, not-for-proﬁt institutions and 
governments are sometimes accused of being rigid, slow to adapt, and crippled by inefﬁciency 
through impenetrable regulations and a bloated bureaucracy. Organizations can lose sight of 
the goal of providing “public service” and become more interested in increasing their own 
organizational budgets. Public purpose organizations are commonly supported by taxes or 
donations that are often not tightly linked to the quality of their services. For this reason, 
they may not have a ﬁnancial incentive to improve the quality of what they provide. Many 
current debates about reforms in both governments and nonproﬁts concern how efﬁciency 
and accountability can be improved without eroding the commitment of these organizations 
to providing valuable goods and services.
Public purpose organizations respond to the demands of their “public,” whether voters, 
members, or other participants. Nonproﬁt organizations frequently offer services related to 
religion, education, health, and welfare. Sometimes, they offer these services only within a 
particular community (such as to members of a certain religion); at other times, they work 
more widely and may receive subsidies from the government. Some such organizations may

CHAPTER 2 — USEFUL TOOLS AND CONCEPTS
have goals that are directly at odds with other public purpose organizations; for example, 
organizations working to support gay families seek outcomes that differ from those sought 
by organizations that aim to maintain exclusively the traditional family headed by a married 
man and woman.
Because deﬁnitions of the public good vary, some people will reject the “public purpose” of 
some of these organizations. For example, a few nonproﬁt organizations are thinly disguised 
hate groups. Trade organizations and labor unions promote the interests of (some of) their 
own members, while other members of society may disagree with their agendas. A continuing 
issue with government institutions is the question of whose interests are represented. Majority 
groups? Outspoken minority groups? Special interests who donate money to campaigns? 
Yet, because of the nature of public goods and the general interests of social welfare, the 
question cannot be whether to have a public purpose sphere but only how to allow it to 
function well.
3.3 THE BUSINESS SPHERE
The U.S. government deﬁnes businesses as “entities that produce goods and services for sale 
at a price intended at least to approximate the costs of production.”4 The business sphere 
is made up of such ﬁrms. A business ﬁrm is expected to look for opportunities to buy and 
manage resources in such a way that, after their product is sold, the owners of the ﬁrm will 
earn proﬁts.
Whereas the core sphere responds to direct needs, and the public purpose sphere responds to 
its constituents, business ﬁrms are responsive to demands for goods and services, as expressed 
through markets by people who can afford to buy the ﬁrms’ products.
Private for-proﬁt enterprises in the United States and many other countries fall into 
four main legal forms: proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, and cooperatives. 
Proprietorships are businesses owned by single individuals or families. Partnerships are 
owned by a group of two or more individuals. Corporations are business ﬁrms that, through 
a process of becoming chartered by a state or federal government, attain a legal existence 
separate from the individuals or organizations who own it. Individual owners can come and 
go, but the corporation remains. If the corporation goes bankrupt and is forced to dissolve, 
the owners of a corporation cannot lose more than their investment. On the other hand, there 
is no legal limit to the proﬁt they can make if the corporation is successful. This asymmetry, 
along with its other legal advantages, makes the corporation the preferred structure for major 
business activities in most countries.
Corporations that issue stock are governed by shareholders according to the principle 
of “one share, one vote.” In principle, shareholders elect a board of directors, who in turn 
hire professional managers to run the day-to-day operations of the corporation. (In fact, 
shareholders often lack the power to propose directors other than those put forward by the 
existing board or management. There are ongoing struggles about how or whether to increase 
the investors’ control in this respect.) Cooperatives, in contrast to corporations, cannot issue 
stock and are governed by a different ownership principle. Each member of the cooperative, 
no matter what his or her position, has one and only one vote. In practice, cooperatives are 
owned by one of three groups: their workers, their suppliers, or their consumers.
It is sometimes thought that maximizing proﬁts is the only goal of businesses. But ﬁrms 
may not always aim for the highest proﬁt for two main reasons. 
First, some business managers cite being a good “corporate citizen,” with regard to 
their workers, communities, or the environment, as a motivation for some of their actions. 
Businesses organized on a cooperative model (including large food-marketing organizations 
such as Land O’Lakes for dairy products and Ocean Spray for cranberries) explicitly state 
their purpose in terms of providing services to their members, rather than in terms of proﬁt. 
Still, making enough proﬁt to stay aﬂoat is a goal of all well-run businesses. Some businesses

THE THREE SPHERES OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY 
69
may set a certain goal for proﬁts while also pursuing other goals. Mindless proﬁteering, 
however—going after the last bit of proﬁt at all costs, neglecting social and even ethical 
concerns—need not be how businesses are run.
Second, within a modern business corporation of any size, the activities of “the ﬁrm” are 
made up of the activities of many people, including its stockholders, board of directors, chief 
executive ofﬁcer (CEO), mid- and top-level managers, and employees. The interests of the 
various individuals and suborganizations may be in conﬂict. Sometimes, top ofﬁcers and 
managers may act, for example, not in the proﬁt-making interest of the owners but according to 
their personal self-interest. That is, they may seek to maximize their own prestige and incomes, 
even when this goes against the interests of everyone else involved in the ﬁrm, including 
those who have invested in it. Proﬁts, and even the long-term survival of the company itself, 
may be sacriﬁced in a race for individual high salaries and lucrative bonuses.
One strength of business organizations is that because they have at least one clear 
goal—making a proﬁt—their efﬁciency in operating to reach that goal may be greater than 
the efﬁciency of activities in the other two spheres. A proﬁt orientation is commonly thought 
to drive ﬁrms to choose the most (market) valuable outputs to produce and to produce them 
at the least possible cost—where, again, costs are determined by the forces of the market. 
(In Chapter 3 we begin a much closer look at how markets determine prices; ability to pay 
is just one of the relevant forces.)
Another advantage of the proﬁt motivation is that it encourages innovation: People are more 
motivated to come up with clever new ideas when they know that they may reap ﬁnancial 
rewards. We all beneﬁt, in terms of our material standard of living, from business efﬁciency 
and from innovations when they bring us improved products at lower prices.
The relative weakness of the business sphere comes from the fact that business interests 
do not necessarily coincide with overall social well-being. Firms may act to enhance 
social well-being—for example, by making decisions that consider all the needs of their 
customers and their workers and take into account externalities, including those that affect 
the natural environment. They may be guided in these directions by the goodwill of their 
owners and managers, by pressure from their customers or workers, or by government 
regulation.
Production for market exchange, however, has no built-in correction for market 
externalities; this is, indeed, a way to remember the meaning of the term “externalities”—it 
refers to things that are external to the interests of the ﬁrm (or of any other economic 
actor in question). We will discuss externalities in more detail in Chapter 13. Moreover, 
sometimes “innovation” can take a perverse form. In the late 1990s, for example, Enron 
boosted its reported earnings primarily by inventing unusual and “innovative” accounting 
practices, which served to hide the extreme weakness of its ﬁnancial situation from 
investors. Similarly, “innovative” investment and accounting practices were a major cause 
of the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008, as will be discussed in Chapter 30. In ﬁelds such as health 
care and education, where it can be difﬁcult to deﬁne clear goals, businesses may increase 
proﬁts by “innovatively” cutting corners on the less-measurable and less-often-marketed 
aspects of quality of life.
The potential for social harm grows when ﬁrms gain excessive market power—that is, 
when they come to dominate the market in their area. They may then be able to charge socially 
inefﬁcient prices (as we discuss in Chapter 18) or to squelch socially advantageous innovations 
by competing ﬁrms. Industrialized countries also have considerable power to harm the natural 
environment on which they ultimately depend. Thus market economies today face a major 
conundrum: How can societies continue to beneﬁt from the strengths of the business sphere 
while ensuring that this sphere supports the kind of world that will sustain the livelihoods 
and the well-being of future generations? For one example of the debate over the allocation 
of certain economic activities to the business sphere, see Box 2.2.

CHAPTER 2 — USEFUL TOOLS AND CONCEPTS
BOX 2.2 PRIVATE PRISONS
The United States has more prisoners than any other 
country, not only in absolute numbers but also on a 
per-capita basis. Up until the 1980s, prisons in the 
U.S. were operated exclusively by state and federal 
government agencies. But since 1984, a growing 
share of U.S. prisons are being operated by for-proﬁt 
companies. Currently, around 130,000 prisoners in 
the United States, or 9 percent of the prison popu-
lation, are housed in prisons operated by private 
companies. The main argument in favor of prison 
privatization is that for-proﬁt companies will have an 
incentive to identify economic efﬁciencies, and thus 
reduce prison operation costs to taxpayers.
However, a 2011 report on private prisons reported 
that most studies indicate little or no cost savings 
when prisons are turned over to for-proﬁt companies. 
Analysis of private prisons in Arizona found that per-
prisoner costs were actually higher in private prisons. 
The report concluded that:
the supposed beneﬁts (economic and otherwise) 
of private prisons often fail to withstand scrutiny. 
The view that private prisons save taxpayer money, 
fuel local economies, and adequately protect the 
safety of prisoners helps to feed mass incarceration 
by making privatization appear to be an attractive 
alternative to reducing prison populations. But 
the evidence for such beneﬁts is mixed at best. 
Not only may privatization fail to save taxpayer 
money, but private prison companies, as for-proﬁt 
institutions, are strongly incentivized to cut corners 
and thereby maximize proﬁts, which may come at 
the expense of public safety and the well being of 
prisoners. (ACLU, 2011, p. 18)
For example, a 2007 audit of a private prison in 
Texas found deplorable conditions, with prisoners 
denied medical care, refused access to their lawyers, 
and forced to live in their own wastes due to a lack 
of toilets. One study found that private prisons hire 
fewer guards than public prisons, leading to higher 
rates of violence.
Another implication of prison privatization is that 
companies that operate prisons lobby legislators for 
higher incarceration rates and longer prison terms. 
The largest prison company, Corrections Corporation 
of America, hired 199 lobbyists in 32 states between 
2003 and 2011. Prison companies are normally paid 
on a per-prisoner basis, so they have an incentive to 
house as many prisoners as possible. A 2013 article 
on private prisons concluded that:
unless authorities implement signiﬁcant changes, 
including regular inspections and holding private 
institutions to humane standards, private prisons 
are not a solution. Corporations which beneﬁt 
from longer prison stays must also be removed 
from discussions of sentencing and drafting 
legislation.

3.4 THE SIZE OF THE THREE SPHERES
Figure 2.3 presents estimates of the monetary value of the annual production of goods and 
services in the United States by the three spheres in 2010, in dollar and percentage terms. The 
business sphere contributed 58 percent of production, the core sphere contributed 32 percent, 
and the public purpose sphere contributed 10 percent. The dollar ﬁgures add up to more than 
GDP in that year ($14.7 trillion) because an estimate of the value of unpaid household labor 
as equal to one-third of the value of GDP has been included. This differs from government 
estimates of GDP, which do not currently include the value of household production.
3.5 A COMPARATIVE NOTE: LESS INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES
Many less industrialized countries have large informal spheres of small market enterprises 
operating outside government oversight and regulation. Although this sphere could be clas-
siﬁed as business because it involves private production for sale, it is also similar to the core 
sphere in that the activities are very small-scale and often depend on family and community 
connections. Like activities in the core sphere, informal business activities are often excluded 
from government-compiled accounts. In the United States, illegal drug trades and house-
cleaning services provided “off the books” are two examples of the informal sphere. In less 

 
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
71
industrialized countries, however, it is sometimes the case that most people are employed in 
small-scale agriculture, trade, and services, which often go uncounted.
If this textbook were being written for use in developing countries, it would be necessary to 
pay a great deal more attention to the complicating reality of informal economic activity and 
perhaps to discuss it as a fourth sphere. However, in a text for use in industrialized countries, we 
can deal with this issue by simply noting, as we have just done, that informal economic activity 
could legitimately be classiﬁed as occurring within either the business sphere or the core sphere, 
leaving open the question of which of these classiﬁcations is more appropriate.
Discussion Questions
1. Education is sometimes provided within the core sphere (at-home preschool activities and 
home schooling), is often provided by the public purpose sphere (public and nonproﬁt 
schools), and is occasionally provided by for-proﬁt ﬁrms (“charter schools” or ﬁrms 
offering speciﬁc training programs). Can you think of some possible advantages and 
disadvantages of each of these three ways of providing education?
2. Make a list of several things that, over the past few days, you have eaten, drunk, been entertained 
by, been transported by, been sheltered by, or received other services from (e.g., “dinner at 
Gina’s,” “my apartment,” and “the health clinic”). Then, using the deﬁnitions in this section, 
determine which of the three spheres of economic activity provided each item.

Markets and Society
An important area of interest—and dispute—among economists concerns how markets func-
tion. As we saw in the previous chapter, the basic neoclassical model is based on the idea 
that market systems function fairly smoothly, are largely self-regulating, and if mostly left 
alone will produce the most efﬁcient economic outcomes. Others believe that without some 
important modiﬁcations through government policy or regulation, as well as from other 
forces of culture and ethics, market economies may serve only some people, and some goals 
of human well-being, while endangering others. 
Beyond noting that markets really do bring about some good and some bad results, there 
is no simple way to resolve these differences. Economists who worry about negative results, 
such as extreme inequality, or concentrations of power that can work against democracy, 
nevertheless recognize the importance of markets, while seeking to moderate some of their 
negative effects. 
Before we address these debates more speciﬁcally, it will be essential to understand what, 
in fact, economists mean by markets.
1. THREE DEFINITIONS OF MARKETS 
When people talk about markets, they may be referring to a number of different meanings of 
the word, from very concrete to very abstract. The language of economics has at least three 
different uses of the word “market,” and the appropriate meaning must be judged from the 
context in which it appears. We will start with the most concrete and move toward the more 
abstract deﬁnitions.
1.1 MARKETS AS PLACES TO BUY AND SELL
The most concrete and commonsense deﬁnition of a market is that it is a place where people 
go to buy and sell things. Historically markets have been physical locations. For example, the 
Grand Bazaar in Istanbul, Turkey, is one of the world’s oldest and largest covered markets in 
the world, dating to the ﬁfteenth century. The Grand Bazaar now has more than 3,000 shops 
and attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors every day. The Grand Bazaar and produce 
stands in African villages have ﬂourished for ages as meeting places for people who wish to 
engage in exchange transactions.
In the context of the contemporary world, many different kinds of physical markets have 
these same functions. They can be a single store, a shopping mall with many retail stores 
sharing one structure, or a livestock auction. A market, as suggested by these examples, can 
be deﬁned as a physical place where there is a reasonable expectation of ﬁnding both buyers 
and sellers for the same product or service.
market (ﬁrst mean-
ing): a place (physical 
or virtual) where 
there is a reasonable 
expectation of ﬁnd-
ing both buyers and 
sellers for the same 
product or service

74 
CHAPTER 3 — MARKETS AND SOCIETY
But in modern societies, markets do not necessarily need to be physical places. One can now 
easily make purchases online that in the past required physically going to a store. Amazon and 
eBay are modern examples of “places” where buyers and sellers can also come together.
1.2 MARKETS AS SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS
The term “market” can also refer to economic activity that is not conﬁned to a single place 
such as a shopping mall or a Web site. A more general deﬁnition is that a market is an “insti-
tution” that facilitates economic interactions among buyers and sellers.
To understand this deﬁnition of a market, we ﬁrst have to understand what we mean by an 
institution. Once again, we have a word that can be understood in several ways. An institution 
can be a physical location, such as penal institutions (prisons), mental institutions (psychiatric 
hospitals), or institutions for housing parentless children (orphanages). This meaning is, in 
fact, incorporated into the U.S. Census in a number of instances in which the people being 
counted are speciﬁed as the “noninstitutionalized population”—meaning that they are neither 
in prisons nor in long-term hospital care.
However, an institution in an economic sense is more than a physical structure. The term 
refers to the ways of structuring economic activities based on customs, habits, and laws. Thus 
we can speak, for example, of the institutional structure of health care in the United States as 
one that is based on private care for many working-age adults, Medicare for older adults, and 
Medicaid for low-income children, families, and people with disabilities. This institutional 
structure also includes the federal and state laws regarding health care, the rules of health 
insurance companies, customary procedures about doctor visits, and so on.
When we view markets as institutions, we can see that they not only bring buyers and 
sellers into communication with each other but also structure and coordinate their interactions. 
Speciﬁc market institutions come in many types. Credit cards are a type of market institution 
that facilitates purchases when a consumer does not have enough cash readily available. 
Consumer protection laws are a market institution that deﬁnes certain exploitative business 
practices and makes them illegal. The ability to return purchased products for a refund can 
also be viewed as a widely accepted market institution.
Thinking of markets as institutions, rather than places, leads to deﬁnitions of markets for 
particular goods and services or categories of goods and services. For example, we can speak 
of the “real estate market” in a particular city or even the entire country. We can deﬁne the 
market for used cars, the market for wind turbines, or the market for luxury goods. Speaking of 
the “stock market” in a broad sense is another common example of a market as an institution, 
whereas the New York Stock Exchange would be a market according to our ﬁrst deﬁnition, 
as a place where buyers and sellers come together.
We can deﬁne markets at various levels of detail depending on our interests. Thus we can 
analyze the wheat market or be more speciﬁc and study the market for No. 2 dark winter wheat 
or No. 1 dark northern spring wheat. Or we might delineate a market based on geographic 
location, such as the New England market for home heating oil.
1.3 “THE MARKET” AS AN ECONOMIC SYSTEM
In the most abstract terms, people sometimes refer to markets as an economic system, for ex-
ample, describing the United States as having a “market economy” or indicating a preference for 
“free markets.” In this macroeconomic sense, a market economy is one that relies on markets (as 
social institutions) to conduct economic activities, rather than relying on other institutions.
When you think of an alternative to a market economy, you might think of a system that 
relies on central planning to conduct economic activities, as was the case in the Soviet Union. 
But we should realize that, even in modern market economies, many economic activities 
are not structured by markets. For example, decisions about resource maintenance are not 
always made based on markets, but often on scientiﬁc evidence or political preferences. The 
institutions: ways 
of structuring human 
activities based on 
customs, habits, and 
laws
market (third 
meaning): an eco-
nomic system (a 
“market economy”) 
that relies on market 
institutions to con-
duct many economic 
activities
market (second 
meaning): an institu-
tion that facilitates 
economic interactions 
among buyers and 
sellers

 
INSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MARKETS 
75
distribution of economic resources within the core sphere is normally made based on social 
or family relationships rather than market forces.
The view of markets as an economic system underlies some of the most heated current 
debates in economics; one side takes a “pro-market” view, and the other side takes an “anti-
market” view. Market advocates claim that “free markets” and a laissez-faire economy (one 
with very little government regulation) lead to economic growth and prosperity. Others believe 
that markets can provide social beneﬁts in many cases, but that unchecked and unregulated 
markets can contribute to problems such as poverty, inequality, environmental degradation, 
and an erosion of social ethics. As we examine different issues throughout this book, we 
frequently refer to these perspectives and this continuing debate.
Discussion Questions
1. In what sense is the term “market” being used in each of the following sentences? “Go 
to the market and get some bananas.” “The market is the best invention of humankind.” 
“The labor market for new Ph.D.s is bad this year.” “The advance of the market leads 
to a decline in social morality.” “The market performance of IBM stock weakened last 
month.” Can you think of other examples from your own readings or experience?
2. Do you think the U.S. economy can be described as a free market? Why or why not?
2. INSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MARKETS
Contemporary markets do an amazing thing: They allow many separate decision makers, acting 
in a decentralized manner, to coordinate their behavior, resulting in highly complex patterns 
of economic activity. However, in order for markets to operate smoothly, they depend on a 
number of even more basic institutions. We classify these in four broad groups:
1. individualist institutions related to property and decision making
2. social institutions of trust
3. infrastructure for the smooth ﬂow of goods and information
4. money as a medium of exchange.
2.1 INDIVIDUALIST INSTITUTIONS OF PROPERTY AND DECISION MAKING
Before people can begin to think about making a market transaction, they have to be clear about 
what belongs to whom. Ownership is usually deﬁned through systems of property rights set out 
in law and enforced by courts and police. These rights deﬁne what is private property and how 
economic actors can manage their property. Markets require that economic actors be free to 
make decisions about voluntarily trading their private property (including their ﬁnancial assets) 
for others’ property. Also, prices must not be under the complete control of a central planning 
agency but are generally determined by the interactions of market participants themselves.
The institutions of private property and individualist decision making exist both formally, in 
codes of law, and informally, in social norms. For example, some Western economists expected 
markets to grow quickly in the former republics of the Soviet Union after communism was 
dismantled and market opportunities opened up. However, many people living in these countries 
were accustomed to being told by the state where to work and what to do. Norms of individual 
entrepreneurship, it turns out, do not just arise naturally. Nor did other sorts of market infrastructure 
appear quickly, and the post-Soviet Russian economy went into a severe decline for some time.
2.2 SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS OF TRUST
A second critical institutional requirement for markets is that a degree of trust must exist 
between buyers and sellers. When a buyer puts down her payment, she must trust that the 
seller will hand over the merchandise and that it will be of the expected quality. A seller must 
be able to trust that the payment offered is valid, whether in the form of currency, personal 
laissez-faire econ-

with little government 
regulation

by nongovernment 
economic actors

CHAPTER 3 — MARKETS AND SOCIETY
check, credit card, or online payment. Consider that the online auction site eBay could not 
operate unless winning bidders were conﬁdent that they would receive their products.
One way in which trust is built up is through the establishment of direct, one-to-one relationships. 
If you have dealt with some people in the past and they treated you fairly, you are likely to choose 
them when it comes time to trade again. Even in sophisticated contemporary economies, this 
kind of conﬁdence plays an important role. Companies know which suppliers they can count on 
to come through on time, and consumers patronize stores where they feel comfortable.
Reputation also can be important in creating trust. A buyer might be ﬂeeced by a seller in 
a transaction, but if that buyer spreads the word, the seller may suffer a damaged reputation 
and a loss of customers. Online reviews provide useful information about which products 
and merchants are reliable. Marketers try to capitalize on the tendency of buyers to depend 
on reputation by using advertising to link certain expectations about quality and price to a 
recognizable brand name and thus creating “brand loyalty” among repeat customers.
Cultural norms and ethical or religious codes can also help to establish and maintain an 
atmosphere of trustworthiness. The functioning of markets is facilitated by having enough 
members of a society subscribe to a common moral code and not betray one another’s trust.
In addition to broad cultural ethics, markets depend on speciﬁc legal structures. A “contract” 
is a general set of terms that structure a market exchange. Explicit contracts are formal, 
usually written, contracts that provide a legally enforceable description of the agreed-on 
terms of exchange. Explicit contracts can be quite complex, including many clauses to cover 
a multitude of contingencies (such as “If goods are not delivered by June 1, the price paid 
will be reduced to . . . ”). They may involve many parties, as in a contract between a union 
and an employer. For formal contracts to work, there must be laws that state the parties’ legal 
obligation to honor contracts and establish penalties for those who fail to do so.
An implicit contract is said to exist when the parties have agreed informally about the 
terms of their exchange. Such agreement may be based on verbal discussions or on traditions 
and normal expectations.
In modern societies, many market encounters take place between strangers who are unlikely 
ever to meet again and may not even share the same traditions and moral codes. In such cases, 
the formal institutions of explicit contracts are often needed. Even with a system of formal 
contracts, however, social norms are still essential. Detailed formal contracts are costly to 
write and costly to enforce. It is not practical to police every detail of every contract, and it 
is impossible to cover every conceivable contingency. The legal system can work smoothly 
only if most people willingly obey most laws and believe that it is dishonorable to cheat.
In effect, relationships, social norms, and the government-created apparatus of law are 
institutions that must exist side by side, reinforcing one another. None of these alone can carry 
the whole burden of making complex contracts work and, hence, make markets possible.
2.3 INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE SMOOTH FLOW OF GOODS AND INFORMATION
A third set of institutions needed for market functioning has to do with making possible a 
smooth ﬂow of goods and information. Most obviously, a physical infrastructure is needed 
for transportation and storage. Such infrastructure includes roads, ports, railroads, and ware-
houses in which to store goods awaiting transport or sale. This sort of infrastructure can be 
most noticeable when it is absent, as in economies ravaged by war or natural diseaster.
In addition, an infrastructure must be in place for information to ﬂow freely. Producers 
and sellers need information on what and how much their customers want to buy. At the same 
time, consumers need to know what is available and how much of something else they will 
have to give up (i.e., how much they will have to pay) to obtain the products that are on the 
market. Ideally, in fact, consumers should be able to compare all potential purchases as a 
basis for deciding what to acquire and what to do without. Although this ideal is unlikely to 
be attained, access to the Internet, as well as more traditional sources of information such as 
newspapers and radio, have greatly expanded the ﬂow of market information.

TYPES OF MARKETS 
77
2.4 MONEY AS A MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE
The ﬁnal basic institution required to facilitate the operation of markets is a generally accepted 
form of money. Many different things have been used as money in the past. Early monetary 
systems used precious or carved stones, particular types of seashells, or other rare goods. 
Gold, silver, and other metal coins were the most common choice for many centuries. More 
recently, paper currency has become important. Today, the use of checks, credit cards, and 
debit cards further facilitate making payments for goods and services. 
What makes something money? Three criteria are necessary for something to be deﬁned 
as money in a market economy.
1. One obvious criterion is that money must be widely accepted as a medium of exchange. 
In other words, money is whatever everyone accepts as money. In this sense, money is a 
social institution of trust.
2. Money must provide a durable store of value. Imagine the problems that would occur 
if heads of lettuce were proposed as money. A form of money that starts to rot within a 
week or two would be difﬁcult to use! The value of money must be relatively stable over 
time. In addition, money must have minimal handling and storage costs. By this criterion, 
paper currency is generally better than coins, and electronic transactions are better still.
3. Money must be accepted as a unit of account. When people say that something is worth 
$1,000, that does not necessarily mean that they are proposing to buy or sell the item. 
Money serves as a way of valuing things, even if no market exchange takes place.
In most cases, money is created or sanctioned by national governments. However, this is 
not essential. For example, cigarettes are often used as a form of money by prisoners. Also, 
communities smaller than national governments can create their own money. In recent years, 
local “time-banking” currencies have appeared in some communities in the United States 
and elsewhere. People earn time dollars by performing valuable services for others or for the 
community as a whole, such as child care, tutoring, or building repairs. Time dollars can then 
be used to pay for other services or used instead of “normal” dollars to purchase products 
from local merchants (see Box 3.1).
Discussion Questions
1. When you shop on-line, how do you know that you can trust the seller to deliver the goods 
as promised? What is necessary for the social institution of trust to work, and how might 
in break down, in on-line transactions?
2. Are you aware of situations in some countries or regions where physical and commu-
nications infrastructure is lacking, or poorly maintained? How do you think this affects 
economic development in these regions? 
3. TYPES OF MARKETS
Markets take a wide variety of forms. They can be classiﬁed according to what is sold, how 
prices are determined, and the period covered.
3.1 MARKETS DEFINED BY WHAT IS SOLD
Recall from last chapter that we deﬁned two basic market types—product and factor markets—
in the traditional model of economic activity. In this section we further classify different 
types of markets. 
The most obvious and well-known product markets are those in which people buy goods 
and services from businesses. Such retail markets deal in food, books, clothes, haircuts, 
and so on. Some retail markets sell, instead of tangible objects, services such as banking or 
repairs for your car. Retail markets may be supplied directly by producers, but more often 
money: a medium 
of exchange that 
is widely accepted, 
durable as a store 
of value, has minimal 
handling and storage 
costs, and serves as a 
unit of account
retail markets: 
markets where goods 
and services are pur-
chased by consum-
ers from businesses, 
generally in small 
quantities

CHAPTER 3 — MARKETS AND SOCIETY
they are supplied by distributors and brokers who trade in wholesale markets, which act 
as intermediaries between producers and retailers and tend to involve transactions in larger 
quantities. For example, Walmart and most other discount retailers don’t actually produce 
the products they sell, but purchase them from suppliers in wholesale markets.
We can differentiate between wholesale markets and intermediate goods markets, which 
involve sales of unﬁnished products between businesses, such as the purchase of sheet metal 
by an automobile company. Resale markets are product markets for items that have been 
previously owned. Used-car markets are resale markets, as are markets for antique furniture. 
Most shares traded in stock markets are also being resold, having been previously owned 
by other investors. In commodities markets, raw materials such as agricultural products, 
minerals, or petroleum are bought and sold.
The labor market is a type of factor market, deﬁned as the set of institutions through 
which people who wish to work offer to sell their services to employers: businesses, public 
agencies, nonproﬁt organizations, and households other than their own. Unlike a physical 
object, labor cannot be produced ﬁrst and then handed to the buyer; rather, the worker 
promises to do something in return for a promised payment of wages. Labor markets are 
sufﬁciently different from other types of markets that this topic warrants separate treatment 
(in Chapter 10).
BOX 3.1 TIME BANKING
Time banking is a core sphere activity that uses a cre-
ative system to bring together unused human resources 
with unmet human needs. It is of interest because it is 
so closely related to all the spheres of economic activ-
ity. Time banking is a system of computerized credits 
operating within a deﬁned location (it might be a 
hospital or nursing home, or a city, such as Portland, 
Maine). If you join a time bank system, you are initially 
issued a small number of credits; each one is a claim 
on one hour of time offered by someone else in the 
system. You list, in the central computer, the services 
that you can offer—from doing errands or cooking to 
carpentry or music lessons—and whenever you provide 
an hour of such service to someone else in the system, 
you receive a credit. Some interesting characteristics of 
the system include:
UÊ It is a little like barter, only the person who re-
ceives your service does not need to be the same 
one who provides something for you in return.
UÊ It is strictly non-monetized. However, it has been 
learned that it is usually necessary to have a 
small amount of money to pay an individual 
who will ensure that the central computerized 
system is operating smoothly.
UÊ Some people join time banks who are not keen 
to do traditional volunteer work, because in 
the latter they sometimes feel that their time is 
valued at zero.
Time banks often have to grapple with an unex-
pected fact: Many people are more eager to give 
services than to receive them—as long as their service 
is recognized in some formal way. The resulting “bal-
ance of payments” problems have been solved in a 
variety of ways, such as asking people to donate their 
excess time dollars to day-care centers (which can 
call on time bank members to read to the children) 
or places where the residents are too ill to be able to 
offer anything in return. However, even in the latter 
case, there are often examples of receivers ﬁnding 
something that they can offer in return.
Time banks—more than 300 of them—exist in 23 
countries. The largest one in New York City is the 
Visiting Nurse Service of New York Community 
Connections TimeBank. It has more than 2,000 
members and is most active in three places—
Upper Manhattan, Lower Manhattan, and parts 
of Brooklyn. Members come from all over New 
York City, but exchanges are easiest when people 
live in the same neighborhood. One example 
is Elayne Castillo-Vélez, who earns a credit for 
each hour she spends tutoring immigrant students 
who are having trouble learning English. She 
coordinates with the students’ teachers to help 
focus her efforts. The students she has worked 
with have seen improvements in their grades and 
even won certiﬁcates for academic achievement. 
She spends her accumulated credits to take art 
classes.

TYPES OF MARKETS 
79
Financial markets, also classiﬁed as factor markets, are markets for loans, equity ﬁnance, 
and ﬁnancial assets such as stocks and bonds. An economic actor who needs money may 
get a loan from a bank. Businesses may sell shares of stocks—that is, small holdings that 
represent ownership rights in the ﬁrm—as a way to raise funds via “equity ﬁnancing.” Although 
corporations sometimes issue new shares of their stock to raise funds, as just noted nearly all 
the activity on stock markets is resale of existing stocks.
Some markets operate outside the law. Underground markets (also sometimes called 
shadow markets or black markets) are illegal markets, normally for a type of product. It 
might be that the good or service itself is illegal, as are heroin, smuggled antiquities, and 
murder for hire. Or the markets deal in legitimate goods but in illegal ways. For example, 
smugglers may sell cigarettes or imported perfume at prices that do not include payment of 
required taxes.
3.2 MARKETS DEFINED BY HOW PRICES ARE DETERMINED
At ﬁrst glance, it might seem as if many consumer retail markets violate one of the institutional 
requirements for markets that we mentioned above: that prices must generally be allowed 
to be set by the interactions of market participants themselves. In an old-fashioned open-air 
bazaar or ﬂea market, buyers and sellers haggle about prices. But in a typical retail setting 
in an industrialized society, you do not “interact” so directly with the retailer to determine 
the price of bread or a shirt. The price is listed on the shelf, a tag, or directly on the product. 
Either you pay the posted price set by the seller, or you do not buy the item.
Even though you do not haggle with the cashier at The Gap or at the supermarket, the fact 
that you can decide whether to buy is itself a form of interaction. Over time, retailers will 
take note of what moves off the shelf most quickly and will then order more of it and may 
also raise its price. They will also take note of what does not sell so quickly and will then 
reduce their order from wholesalers or mark the items down. The retailers’ purchases from 
the wholesalers, in turn, give the suppliers information that they can use in deciding how 
much to order or produce and how to set their prices.
So while you may not be able to bargain directly, your actions, in combination with the 
actions of other customers, ultimately affect the prices and quantities offered in the market. 
These adjustments should tend, at least in theory, to lead posted prices to reﬂect what 
economists call the market-determined value, or market value, of the item. Market value, 
discussed in detail in Chapter 4, is the price as freely determined by voluntary interactions of 
buyers and sellers. The posted price is most likely to move to the market value if markets are 
competitive, the ﬂow of information is good, the adjustment process is given enough time, 
and no big changes in market conditions occur in the meantime.
Auction markets are markets in which an item is sold to the highest bidder. Auction markets 
are used when the appropriate price for an item is relatively unknown and there are many 
possible buyers or sellers. Although in the past auction markets were commonly limited to 
goods such as antiques and artwork, the advent of online auction sites such as eBay have made 
auction markets much more prevalent. Real-world auctions offer interesting opportunities to 
observe how market values are determined.
Auction markets come in different types. In an open auction, an opening price is set low, 
and then potential buyers top one another’s bids until only one bidder remains. This is what 
many people ﬁrst think of when they think of an auction, and it is the main type of auction 
used on eBay.
In a Dutch auction, an opening price is set high and then drops until a buyer offers to 
purchase the item. The name comes from its use in the Dutch wholesale cut-ﬂower market. 
You can ﬁnd numerous Dutch auction sites online, and stores that follow the practice of taking 
an extra 10 percent or 20 percent off the prices of unsold items each week are following a 
Dutch auction procedure.

CHAPTER 3 — MARKETS AND SOCIETY
Sealed-bid auctions get their name from the fact that the bids are given privately to the 
auctioneer, who then selects the winning bidder. In contrast to an open auction, the bidders 
are not supposed to know how much others value the item. Sealed-bid auctions are often used 
to sell commercial real estate (where the high-price buyer wins) and to allocate construction 
contracts (where the low-price seller of construction services wins).
In a double auction, both buyers and sellers state prices at which they are willing to 
make transactions. The New York Stock Exchange is a double auction market. When you 
see pictures of traders on the stock exchange ﬂoor, they are shouting out bids either to buy or 
sell, and a sale can occur when the “bid” and “ask” prices become the same (although most 
stock transactions now occur electronically). 
Finally, in markets with bargaining, a single buyer and a single seller negotiate the price of 
an item, for which no deﬁnitive market value has been established. Residential real estate, for 
example, is generally sold by using such negotiated agreements, as are used cars. (Sometimes 
there is also a posted price, but both parties understand that it is merely a starting point for 
negotiation.)
Salaries of high-level managers, professionals, and unionized employees—and, notably, of 
sports and entertainment stars—are commonly set by bargaining. The presence of potential 
other buyers and sellers, however, is obviously important in determining the relative bargaining 
strength of the two parties. A seller who knows that he can easily ﬁnd other eager buyers, for 
example, will quickly walk away from an unfavorable deal. A seller with fewer options will 
have less ability to hold out for good terms.
Discussion Questions
1. Reviewing the different types of markets outlined in this section, think about whether 
you have ever directly participated in a market of each type. If so, describe speciﬁc 
instances.
2. The Internet has opened up a whole new set of markets for everything from antiques to 
airplane tickets. Pool your knowledge with that of others in the class, and, for the types 
of markets listed in this section, think of as many examples as possible that are online.
4. ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS OF MARKETS
In the previous chapter, we talked about the strengths and weaknesses of each of the three 
economic spheres—core, public purpose, and business. As we conclude this chapter with a 
discussion of the advantages and limitations of markets, it will be evident that these topics 
overlap, especially the strengths and weaknesses of the business sphere. The reason for this 
is obvious: The business sphere operates entirely through markets. But how does this differ 
from the core sphere, from which are drawn the people who are hired to work in businesses 
and which must purchase goods and services to serve the needs and wants of families, house-
holds, and communities? Or, indeed, from the public purpose sphere, which also hires workers 
through labor markets and purchases goods and services through other markets?
The essential characteristic that is common to businesses and to markets is the dominant 
role of the proﬁt motive—as distinct from the motives of the other two spheres. We noted in 
the earlier discussion that this is not the only motive for businesses; however, in individual 
companies, as in the market as a whole, this motive affects many decisions and outcomes. 
Let us review the more and less desirable results of this fact.
The many advantages of markets as a way to conduct economic activities include how they 
allow a steady ﬂow of information, in terms of prices and volumes of sales, that encourages 
producers to respond ﬂexibly to consumer desires. Proﬁts provide feedback to sellers about 
whether resources are being transformed in ways that individuals are willing (and able) 
to pay for. Markets also give people a considerable amount of freedom in deciding which 
activities to engage in, and they encourage some beneﬁcial forms of innovation and social 
sealed-bid auction: 
an auction in which 
bids are given private-
ly to the auctioneer
double auction: an 
auction in which both 
the buyers and sellers 
state prices at which 
they are willing to 
make transactions
bargaining: an 
activity in which a 
single buyer and a 
single seller negotiate 
the terms of their 
exchange

 
ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS OF MARKETS 
81
cooperation. Markets promote economic efﬁciency, and encourage technological innovation 
and entrepreneurship. But as we have noted, the idealized model of a completely free private 
market (as in the basic neoclassical model) rarely exists in practice. Actual market-oriented 
economies always include a mixture of decentralized private decision making and more 
public-oriented decision making.
This is not because voters and government ofﬁcials are unaware of the advantages that 
markets can have in helping an economy run efﬁciently. Rather, it is because real-world 
economies include a number of important, complex factors that are not taken into account 
in the basic neoclassical model. We have already mentioned the issues of externalities and 
public goods, which will be discussed in detail in Chapters 13 and 14. Some other issues 
that we will brieﬂy deﬁne and discuss here are transaction costs, market power, questions of 
information and expectations, and concerns over human needs and equity.
4.1 TRANSACTION COSTS
Transaction costs are the costs of arranging economic activities. In the basic neoclassical 
model, transaction costs are assumed to be zero. If a ﬁrm wants to hire a worker, for example, 
it is assumed that the only cost involved is the wage paid. In the real world, however, the 
activity of reaching a hiring agreement may involve its own set of costs.
The ﬁrm may need to pay costs related to searching, such as placing an ad in print or on the 
web or paying for the services of a recruiting company. The prospective worker may need to 
pay for preparation of a résumé and transportation to an interview. One or both sides might hire 
lawyers to make sure that the contract’s terms reﬂect their interests. Because of the existence of 
such costs, some economic interactions that might lead to greater efﬁciency, and that would occur 
in an idealized, transaction cost–free, frictionless world, may not happen in the real world.
4.2 MARKET POWER
In the basic neoclassical model, all markets are assumed to be “perfectly competitive,” such 
that no one buyer or seller has the power to inﬂuence the prices or other market conditions that 
they face. In the real world, however, we see that many ﬁrms have market power. For example, 
when there is only one ﬁrm (a monopolist) or a few ﬁrms selling a good, they may be able to use 
their power to increase their prices and their proﬁts, creating inefﬁcient allocations of resources 
in the process. Workers may also be able to gain a degree of market power by joining together 
to negotiate as a labor union. A government, too, can have market power, for example when the 
Department of Defense is the sole purchaser of military equipment from private ﬁrms.
Businesses may also gain power by their sheer size—many corporations now function 
internationally and have revenues in the tens of billions of dollars. The decisions of individual 
large corporations can have substantial effects on the employment levels, economic growth, 
living standards, and economic stability of regions and countries. Governments may need 
to factor in the responses of powerful business groups in making their macroeconomic 
decisions. National leaders may fear, for example, that raising business tax rates or the national 
minimum wage may cause companies to leave their country and go elsewhere. Corporations 
frequently also try to inﬂuence government policies directly, through lobbying, campaign 
contributions, and other methods. We explore the implications of corporate size at more 
length in Chapter 18.
4.3 INFORMATION AND EXPECTATIONS
In the basic neoclassical model, in which purely decentralized decisions lead to efﬁcient 
outcomes, people are assumed to have easy access to all the information that they need to 
make good choices. This analysis is static; that is, it deals with an idealized case in a time-
less manner. The model does not consider the time that it might take for a person to make a

economic activities
market power: the 
ability to control, or 
at least affect, the

CHAPTER 3 — MARKETS AND SOCIETY
decision or that it might take for a factory to gear up to produce a good. In the real, dynamic, 
world, obtaining good information may be difﬁcult, and planning for an uncertain future is 
a big part of anyone’s economic decision making.
A manufacturing business, for example, might be considering whether to borrow funds 
to build an additional factory. If the company’s directors were able to know exactly what the 
demand for its products will be like in the future and what interest rates will be—along with 
additional information about things such as future wages, energy costs, and returns on alternative 
investments—the decision would be a simple matter of mathematical calculation.
But the directors will have to guess at most of these things. They will form expectations about the 
future, but these expectations may turn out to be incorrect. If their expectations are optimistic, they 
will tend to make the new investment and hire new workers. Often optimism is “contagious,” and 
if a lot of other business leaders become optimistic, too, then the economy will boom. If, however, 
people share an attitude of pessimism, they may all tend to cut back on spending and hiring.
Because no one business wants to take the risk of jumping the gun by expanding too soon, it 
can be very difﬁcult to get a decentralized market economy out of a slump. How people get their 
information, how they time their actions, and how they form their expectations of the future are 
all important topics that are not addressed in the basic neoclassical model. Taking these factors 
into account suggests why markets sometimes do not work as smoothly as that model suggests.
4.4 HUMAN NEEDS AND EQUITY
Another important issue concerns distribution of income and the ability to pay for goods and 
services. In the basic neoclassical model, the only consumer demands for goods and services 
that can affect the market are those that are backed up by a consumer’s ability to pay. This 
has several implications.
First, there is nothing in the model that ensures that resources are distributed in such a 
way that people can meet their basic human needs. If a few rich people have a lot of money 
to spend on diamonds, for example, while a great number of poor people lack the money to 
pay for basic health care, “free markets” will motivate producers to respond to the demand 
for diamonds, but not to the need for basic health care.
For this reason, governments often adopt more deliberate policies of economic development, 
government provision, subsidies, or income redistribution, to try to ensure that decent living 
standards become more widespread. These policies can sometimes incorporate market 
mechanisms and sometimes replace them.
Second, the model does not take into account nonmarketed production, such as the care 
given to children, the sick, and the elderly by family and friends. There is nothing in the basic 
neoclassical model that ensures that these sorts of production will be supplied in adequate 
quantities and quality.
Lastly, it is also the case that problems such as unemployment and inﬂation tend to 
affect some people more than others, so how a country deals with these problems also has 
distributional consequences.
4.5 CONCLUSION
Clearly, although market systems have strong advantages in some areas, they cannot solve all 
economic problems. Economists sometimes use the term market failure to refer to a situation 
in which a market form of organization would lead to inefﬁcient or harmful results. Because 
of the existence of public goods, externalities, transaction costs, market power, questions of 
information and expectations, and concerns for human needs and equity, macroeconomic 
systems cannot rely on “free markets” alone if they are to contribute effectively to present 
and future human well-being.
To some extent private nonmarket institutions may help remedy “market failure.” For 
example, a group of privately owned factories located around a lake may voluntarily decide

to restrict their waste emissions, because too much deterioration in water quality hurts them 
all. Likewise, a widespread custom of private charitable giving may help alleviate poverty. 
But sometimes the problems are so large or widespread that only government, public actions 
at the national or international levels seem to offer a solution. Exactly how much government 
action is required, and exactly what governments should do, however, are much-debated 
questions within contemporary economics.

Supply and Demand
Prices are among the things considered central to any economy. Many people in the United 
States have been painfully affected by changes in housing prices, as the median price of 
a new house increased from about $170,000 in 2000 to about $250,000 in 2007, then fell 
to less than $220,000 at the bottom of the housing bust in 2009—and is now on the rise 
again, signaling, for many, the beginning of the end of the recent Great Recession (see 
Box 4.1).
To give a more relevant example for most students, textbook prices have risen over the 
past three decades, from an average of about $25 for an introductory economics textbook 
to an average of more than $200 in 2012. In other parts of the world, corn tortilla prices in 
Mexico doubled over several months in 2006–7, leading to mass protests. Between 2000 
and 2002, coffee prices were cut in half, bringing hardship to many coffee growers—after 
2005 they rebounded and in 2012 were higher than in 2000, but in 2013 they fell again to 
about 2000 levels.
Closely related to prices, as variables of economic interest, are quantities of things 
that are bought and sold in markets. When people dramatically decrease their purchases 
of goods and services, the businesses that had hoped to sell those things suffer—and so 
do the people working for those businesses, as falling sales result in lay-offs and reduced 
work hours. The U.S. automobile industry went through some miserable years in 2008–9, 
when employment fell from more than 1 million to only 650,000. China, in contrast, saw 
the quantity of new automobile sales increasing from only about 2 million per year in 2000 
to more than 20 million by 2012.
To understand ﬂuctuations in prices, and in the quantities of goods and services sold, 
it is necessary to understand the basics of market functioning. This chapter introduces the 
famous relationships between supply and demand, which go a long way toward explaining 
the workings of markets.
The basic concept, as you will see, is quite simple: In general, sellers (on the “supply” 
side) will want to supply more of what they sell if they can get higher prices, while on the 
“demand” side, buyers will generally be willing to buy more when prices are lower. Sellers and 
buyers thus want to see prices move in opposite ways. Some sort of balance, or equilibrium, 
has to be established between supply and demand.
Note that as we continue to discuss this supply/demand relationship we use the term 
demand to indicate the willingness and ability of purchasers to buy goods and services, 
while supply means the willingness of producers to produce, and merchandisers to sell, 
goods and services.
demand: the willing-
ness and ability of 
purchasers to buy 
goods or services
supply: the willing-
ness of producers 
and merchandisers 
to provide goods and 
services

CHAPTER 4 — SUPPLY AND DEMAND
1. INTRODUCTION TO THE MICROECONOMIC MARKET MODEL
In this chapter, we present the basic microeconomic model of how markets operate and 
adjust. This model forms the foundation for much of our discussion for the remainder 
of the book, as we extend it (in the next two chapters) and apply it to different types of 
markets (in later chapters). The roots of this model can be traced back to Adam Smith 
and the nineteenth-century school of classical economics (discussed further in Chapters 
8 and 19). It was further reﬁned in twentieth-century neoclassical theory, as discussed in 
Chapter 2, and has become an essential tool for much of economic analysis. The basic 
microeconomic market model is relatively simple, and, therefore, like all simple models, it 
inevitably misses many of the subtleties of what really happens in the world. But its great 
strength is that it summarizes in a concise and tidy way many valid observations about 
the workings of markets, which is why it has proved to be such an enduring contribution 
to economic theory.
As we go on to examine applications of the supply/demand model throughout this book, 
you will have plenty of opportunities to become an intelligent critic of basic economic theory, 
noticing when the model does and does not explain or predict events. First, however, it is 
necessary to go into considerable detail about how the simple model works.
The model considers two “market outcomes”:
s  -ARKET PRICE the prevailing price for a speciﬁc good or service at a particular time in a 
given market. In our basic model, we assume that the good or service is narrowly deﬁned 
such that we can speak of “the” current price, without any variation. For example, we 
could say that the market price for a can of soda on campus is $1.00. In this case, we 
have deﬁned “the market” as “the market for cans of soda on campus.” Although this 
price can change over time, it does not vary at any single point in time. Of course, in 
reality, there may be more than one place to buy soda on campus, and different places 
may charge different prices. We consider the impact of competition in a market in later 
chapters.

BOX 4.1 RECOVERY IN THE HOUSING MARKET
The housing market is considered an important 
indicator of the overall economy. In the wake of 
the Great Recession, the average house price in the 
United States fell by about one-third between 2006 
and 2011. Finally, in 2012 the housing market began 
to show signs of recovery. By the end of 2012 prices 
were rising at an annual rate of over 7 percent.
The rising prices are a function of both supply 
and demand factors. The number of homes sold 
nationally in 2012 was up by about 30 percent 
compared to the previous year. At the same time, 
the supply of homes for sale reached its lowest level 
since 2005. 
The increase in house prices varied signiﬁcantly 
across regions of the country. The biggest gains were 
found in areas hit the hardest when the housing 
bubble burst in 2007. Prices increased by 23 percent 
in Phoenix, 14 percent in Detroit, 13 percent in Las 
Vegas, and 10 percent in Miami. Of the 20 major 
metropolitan markets, only New York City saw further 
declines in house prices in 2012.
The reasons housing prices have increased recent-
ly include an improvement in the overall economy, 
lower unemployment rates, very low mortgage rates, 
and the tight supply. Richard Green of the USC Lusk 
Center for Real Estate, said the recovery in housing 
prices hasn’t been even across all the different price 
segments. He said the upper end of the market has 
done well as wealthier families’ earnings have recov-
ered and foreign buyers have come into the market. 
The lower end of the market has recovered due to 
purchases by investors looking for bargains. 
“It’s the middle market that needs help—particu-
larly in the form of higher income—if it is going to 
have a sustained recovery,” Green said.

THE THEORY OF SUPPLY 
89
s  -ARKET QUANTITY SOLD the number of “units” of a speciﬁc good or service sold in a given 
market during a particular period. In the example above, “units” are cans of soda. Other 
markets may measure quantity sold in terms of “tons of wheat,” “number of haircuts,” or 
“gallons of gasoline.” Note that we also need to deﬁne a particular time frame and location 
in our analysis. So we would deﬁne the market quantity as, say, “number of cans of soda 
sold on campus per week.” Again, market quantities can vary over time, but we assume 
that market activity is constant within each time unit. So by deﬁning the market quantity as 
“number of cans of soda sold on campus per week,” we are not concerned about variation 
in quantity on a daily basis.
The basic microeconomic model involves the interaction of two economic actors, buyers 
(or consumers) and sellers (or producers and merchandisers). We can think of consumers 
as individuals, households, or even businesses buying supplies or raw inputs. Sellers are 
normally thought of as businesses, but this is not always the case. For example, the “sellers” 
in labor markets are individuals offering their labor services.
Another important feature of the microeconomic model is that both buyers and sellers 
are acting voluntarily. The model assumes that potential buyers are acting to enhance 
their own well-being. For example, you may be willing to voluntarily trade $1 for a can 
of soda because you believe that the transaction enhances your well-being. (In some real-
world cases, it may not always be true that buyers always act in the interests of their own 
well-being—we will explore this issue further in Chapter 8.) The model also assumes that 
potential sellers are also acting to enhance their well-being, primarily by earning proﬁts. 
However, sellers may act on the basis of other motivations, even at the expense of lower 
proﬁts, such as a desire to conduct business with suppliers that treat their workers with 
certain ethical standards.
We now consider in more detail the behavior of buyers and sellers in markets. Speciﬁcally, 
we look at the relationship between market prices and quantities from each perspective, ﬁrst 
from the point of view of sellers and then from the consumer perspective. After that, we see 
what happens when buyers and sellers interact in markets.
2. THE THEORY OF SUPPLY
About 40 percent of college students drink coffee on a daily basis. With more than 13,000 
Starbucks locations in the United States, plus 13,000 McDonald’s locations, 7,000 Dunkin’ 
Donuts stores, and numerous other coffee shops and restaurants, there is no shortage of 
places to buy coffee. We introduce the microeconomic market model by considering how 
it applies to coffee markets. Coffee is a good example to use because, as you will see as 
we go through the chapter, we can use it to illustrate several important features about how 
markets operate.
First, let’s deﬁne what we mean by “the coffee market” in this example. Let’s assume 
we are looking at the market for a basic cup of regular coffee in the vicinity of your college 
campus. Although there may be several different locations on and around campus to buy 
coffee, for simplicity we also assume that all these businesses offer the same basic regular 
cup of coffee and sell it at the prevailing market price. Of course, in reality each business 
could set its own price for coffee, but for now we keep our model as simple as possible, 
assuming that individual sellers have no power over market prices. Let’s deﬁne the period 
of our analysis as a week. We consider how the market changes week to week, but within 
each week the price does not vary.
At the beginning of each week, each coffee business must make a decision about how much 
coffee it will offer to sell in the coming week—buying the appropriate quantity of coffee 
supplies, establishing employee work schedules, and so on. How would we expect changes 
in the prevailing market price of a cup of coffee to inﬂuence the quantity of coffee offered 
market quantity 
sold: the number of 
“units” of a speciﬁc 
good or service sold 
in a given market dur-
ing a particular period

90 
CHAPTER 4 — SUPPLY AND DEMAND
for sale each week? In particular, if the market price rises, would we expect more coffee, or 
less coffee, to be offered for sale? Or conversely, if market prices are falling, how would we 
expect the quantity offered for sale to change?
It is important to realize that we are asking this question, for now, only from the perspective 
of coffee sellers. Coffee sellers are most likely either already selling other products, such as 
hot chocolate, doughnuts, or sandwiches, or could sell these other products if they thought 
switching would offer more proﬁt than selling coffee. So if the selling price of coffee is rising, 
it seems reasonable that these sellers will want to sell more coffee relative to selling other 
items. Conversely, if the market price for coffee is falling, sellers will be less interested in 
selling coffee and some may decide to stop selling coffee altogether.
Thus common sense tells us that sellers should offer more coffee when prices are relatively 
high and less coffee when prices are relatively low. We call the relationship between the 
market price and the quantity supplied a positive (or direct) relationship—increases in 
the value of one variable (price) tend to be associated with increases in the value of another 
variable (the quantity supplied).
Note that we can talk about the quantity supplied at the individual level or the market 
level. The individual supply is the quantity supplied by one particular seller. The market 
(or aggregate) supply is the quantity supplied by all sellers in the market.
2.1 THE SUPPLY SCHEDULE AND SUPPLY CURVE
We have been talking about the relationship between price and the quantity of coffee sup-
plied only in abstract terms so far. Now let’s suppose that we have studied the coffee market 
around campus by speaking with different coffee sellers and can estimate how the quantity 
supplied will vary with price. We can present our results as shown in Table 4.1. We call a 
table representing the relationship between price and the quantity supplied a supply sched-
ule. In the case of coffee, we have the supply schedule for a physical good. But we can also 
think of a supply schedule for a marketed service, such as housecleaning, babysitting, or a 
college education.
*“Interpolate” means to estimate a relationship between known data points.

gate) supply: the

As we expect, the quantity of coffee supplied increases with higher prices. For example, 
at a price of $0.80 per cup, only 400 cups would be supplied per week. But if the price rises 
to $1.00 per cup, then 600 cups would be supplied. Note that Table 4.1 shows only the cups 
supplied at $0.10 increments. We can interpolate to estimate, for example, that 550 cups 
would be supplied at a price of $0.95 per cup.* The supply schedule in Table 4.1 shows the 
market supply, which is an aggregation of the individual supply schedules in the local coffee 
market.
From a supply schedule, we can graph a supply curve, as shown in Figure 4.1. This is 
simply the same relationship between price and quantity supplied in graphical form. It is 
standard in economics to place the quantity on the horizontal axis (also called the x-axis) and 
the price on the vertical axis (also called the y-axis). We see, for example, that at a price of 
$1.00 per cup, coffee sellers are willing to supply 600 cups of coffee per week.

THE THEORY OF SUPPLY 
91
Note that the supply curve in Figure 4.1 slopes upward. This is another illustration of a 
positive relationship—as price goes up, the quantity supplied also goes up. (Sometimes this 
positive relationship between price and the quantity supplied is referred to as the “law of 
supply.” Such a choice of words may reﬂect a somewhat misguided attempt to make economics 
sound more scientiﬁc. As we see in later chapters, especially the one about labor, this “law” 
does not hold everywhere.)
We now need to introduce an important distinction in market analysis. When price changes, 
we say that we move along a supply curve. So if the price increased from $0.80 to $1.00 per 
cup, we would move up from a quantity supplied of 400 cups to 600 cups. Another term for 
movement along a supply curve is a change in the quantity supplied. We would not say 
that this is a “change in supply” because that occurs when the entire supply curve shifts—a 
topic that we address in the next section.
Test yourself by answering this question with reference to Table 4.1 or Figure 4.1: By 
how much does the quantity supplied change when the price changes from $1.20 to $1.40 
per cup?*
It is very important when going through this example to imagine that the price is the only 
thing changing. Economists sometimes use the Latin term ceteris paribus as shorthand for 
“all else constant” or “other things equal.” This is a basic research technique used in other 
disciplines as well. For example, when medical researchers try to determine the effect of 
diet alone on a disease, they usually choose as research subjects people whose sex, age, and 
level of exercise (“all else”) are nearly identical (“constant”). If we were to try to estimate a 
real-world supply curve, we would ideally try to hold everything else in the market constant 
while varying just the price and observe how the quantity supplied changes. Of course, 
this cannot be done in the real world, and economists normally have to rely on statistical 
techniques to try to isolate the effect of price alone. We discuss the issue of estimating actual 
supply curves in Chapter 5.

a Latin phrase that 
means “other things 
equal” or “all else

CHAPTER 4 — SUPPLY AND DEMAND
2.2 CHANGES IN SUPPLY
In contrast to a “change in quantity supplied,” which is a response to a price change, we say 
that there has been a change in supply when something else changes and the whole supply 
curve shifts.
Why might the whole curve shift? In our coffee example, one potential factor that could 
shift the supply curve is a change in the number of coffee sellers. Starbucks, for example, 
was founded in 1971 by two college professors and a writer, in Seattle, Washington. If a new 
coffee seller enters the market, then at any given price, more coffee would be supplied, as 
shown in Figure 4.2. The addition of a new coffee supplier shifts the entire supply curve from 
S1 to S2. So if the prevailing price of coffee was $1.00 per cup, the change in supply would 
result in 1,000 cups of coffee being offered for sale each week instead of 600, as shown in 
the graph.
We can describe this increase in supply by saying either that “supply has increased (or 
risen)” or that “the supply curve has shifted out.” (Some students may ﬁnd it confusing that 
a supply increase shifts the supply curve down. Always start by reading across horizontally 
from the price axis. Then you will notice that the shift goes out toward higher numbers on 
the quantity axis.)

2.3 NONPRICE DETERMINANTS OF SUPPLY
A change in the number of sellers is not the only factor that can shift the entire supply curve. 
We can deﬁne six potential nonprice determinants of supply that would shift the entire 
supply curve:
1. a change in the number of sellers
2. a change in the technology of production
3. a change in input prices
4. a change in seller expectations about the future
5. a change in the prices of related goods and services
6. a change in the physical supply of a natural resource

 
THE THEORY OF SUPPLY 
93
Consider, for example, a change in the technology used to make coffee that allows coffee 
to be produced at lower cost. A decrease in production costs suggests that sellers may be 
willing to accept a lower price for coffee. In Figure 4.2, we see that with the original supply 
curve at S1, sellers would be willing to supply 1,000 cups of coffee at a price of $1.40. Now 
suppose a decrease in production costs means that sellers would be willing to supply 1,000 
cups of coffee at a price of only $1.00 per cup. This technological change would also shift 
the supply curve to S2 in Figure 4.2. (Note that in this case it may be easier to think of the 
supply curve shifting downward because sellers are willing to accept a lower price for their 
product. But we would still say that “supply has increased” or that “the supply curve has 
shifted outward.”)
A change in input prices (nonprice determinant #3 in our list) includes the price of 
coffee beans, labor, milk, sugar, coffee cups, electricity, rent, and any other resource that 
is an input into the coffee production process. Let’s suppose that the price of coffee beans 
increases, which actually occurred in 2010–11 as a result of extreme heat in Brazil and 
Colombia (two of the top three coffee-producing countries), causing the price of coffee 
beans to double. In this case, sellers would need to charge higher prices per cup in order to 
cover the increase in their input costs. We see this in Figure 4.3. With the original supply 
curve, S1, sellers were willing to offer 600 cups of coffee at a price of $1.00 per cup. With 
higher coffee bean prices, sellers now require a price of $1.40 per cup in order to supply 
600 cups per week. We would refer to this shift as a “decrease in supply” or that “the supply 
curve has shifted back.”

A supply curve shifts backward (to 
the left) when sellers decide to offer 
a lower quantity for sale at the same 
price (or charge more for a given 
quantity).
The effect of seller expectations about the future (nonprice determinant #4) can be tricky. 
If a coffee seller expects that coffee bean prices will increase soon (perhaps he or she has 
been following the news on weather conditions in South America), he or she might hold back 
some coffee bean inventory for now, to sell later when coffee prices increase. However, if 
he or she hears that a new technology has been adopted by other coffee sellers that lowers 
production costs, he or she might be eager to sell as much coffee as possible now before the 
price is driven down.
Suppose that a coffee seller notices that many people are switching from coffee to tea and 
are willing to pay high prices for gourmet teas. He or she may decide to supply more tea and 
less coffee. In this case, the price of a related good (nonprice determinant #5) has induced 

94 
CHAPTER 4 — SUPPLY AND DEMAND
the ﬁrm to reduce its output of coffee, causing a decrease in the supply of coffee similar to 
what is shown in Figure 4.3.
Finally, in markets for natural resources such as agricultural crops, oil, or minerals, the 
supply curve may shift as a result of physical supply factors like weather conditions or absolute 
availability. So a drought that decreases crop yields would directly cause a reduction in 
supply. Supplies of recoverable oil are ultimately limited and may someday lead to reductions 
in supply. Note that this nonprice determinant differs from nonprice determinant #3 in that 
supplies are directly reduced as a result of natural factors, rather than indirectly through a 
change in input prices.
Discussion Questions
1. Verbally explain the difference between a change in “quantity supplied” and a change in 
supply. Considering the supply side of the market for lawn-mowing services, what kind of 
change (increase or decrease, in quantity supplied or supply) would each of the following 
events cause?
a. There is a rise in the price of gasoline used to run power mowers.
b. There is a rise in the going price for lawn-mowing services.
c. More people decide to offer to mow lawns.
d. A new lawn mower is invented that is cheap and makes it possible to mow lawns at a 
lower cost. 
2. Sketch a supply curve graph illustrating a student’s willingness to sell his textbooks from 
all his classes right now. Assume that the student will receive offers of this sort: “I’ll give 
you [a ﬁxed number of dollars] apiece for all the books you want to sell.” Carefully label 
the vertical and horizontal axes. Suppose that, at an original offer of $30 per book, the 
student will be willing to sell three books, because he knows he can replace these three 
for less than $30 each at a local bookstore. Mark this point on your ﬁrst graph. Assume 
further that at $40 he would be willing to sell four books, at $50 he would supply ﬁve 
books, and so on. Now, on separate graphs labeled (a), (b), and (c), show this line and his 
offer at $30 and the precise new point or an approximate new curve that illustrates each of 
the following changes in conditions. Consider them separately, returning to the condition 
of no Internet resources in part (c).
a. He is offered $70 per book instead of $30.
b. He discovers that the textbook materials for many of his classes are available free on 
the Internet.
c. The local bookstore raises its prices substantially.
3. THE THEORY OF DEMAND
We now turn to the coffee market from the perspective of coffee buyers. Unlike sellers, 
consumers ﬁnd low prices attractive. So it seems reasonable to expect that people will want 
to purchase more cups of coffee per week when prices are lower. We now work through the 
theory of demand using our coffee example. While the consumers in this example are indi-
viduals, realize that demand can also arise from, for example, businesses looking to purchase 
raw materials or government agencies looking to hire employees.
3.1 THE DEMAND SCHEDULE AND DEMAND CURVE
Just as with supply, we can present a demand schedule showing the relationship between 
price and the quantity demanded. In Table 4.2, we see that as the prevailing price of a cup of 
coffee goes up, the quantity demanded goes down.
From the demand schedule, we can graph a demand curve, as shown in Figure 4.4, 
which shows the quantities that buyers are willing to purchase at various prices. So we see, 
demand curve: a 
curve indicating the 
quantities that buyers 
are willing to purchase 
at various prices
demand schedule: 
a table showing the 
relationship between 
price and the quantity 
demanded

 
THE THEORY OF DEMAND 
95
for example, that at a price of $1.40 per cup, consumers would demand 600 cups of coffee 
per week.
It is important to keep in mind that someone’s willingness to buy a good or service is not 
only a function of his preferences but also of his income or wealth. Economists sometimes 
use the term “effective demand” to stress that they are talking about demand backed up by 
enough money to pay the prevailing price. However, you should remember that virtually 
anywhere that the economic term “demand” is used, it refers to this speciﬁc meaning, that 
is, both a willingness and an ability to pay.
Some people who might want to buy a cup of coffee every day may decide not to because 
they do not believe that they can afford it, and decide instead to make their own coffee. 
Although the inability of people to pay for daily cups of coffee at a coffee shop may not 
be a cause for public concern, the inability of people to pay for things such as health care, 
sufﬁcient nutrition, or a college education may create sufﬁcient motivation for government 
involvement. Markets do not, by their nature, take into account wants or needs that are not 
backed up by the ability to pay.
Note that the demand curve in Figure 4.4 slopes downward. Again, this should be common 
sense that, generally, the higher the price of a good, the fewer that people will want to buy. 
If a book is very expensive, you might look for it in the library rather than buying it. If an 
accounting ﬁrm raises its rates, some of its clients may consider hiring a different accountant. 
Price and quantity have a negative (or inverse) relationship along a demand curve. That 
is, when price rises, the quantity demanded falls. (This is sometimes called the “law of 
demand.” Like the “law of supply,” it does not always hold. Sometimes, for example, a smart 
marketer will ﬁnd that buyers will want more of a good if it is sold as a “prestige” good at 
a high price.)

CHAPTER 4 — SUPPLY AND DEMAND
The curve that we have drawn is the entire market (or aggregate) demand curve in 
our local market for coffee. As was the case with supply, the market demand is obtained by 
aggregating the individual demand of each consumer in the market.
Again we need to differentiate between movement along a demand curve and a shifting 
demand curve. Movement along a demand curve is always referred to as a change in 
the quantity demanded. So if the prevailing price of coffee rises from $1.40 per cup 
to $1.70, we would say that the quantity demanded declines from 600 cups to 500 cups 
per week.
Check yourself by answering this question with reference to Table 4.2 or Figure 4.4: By 
how much does the “quantity demanded” change when the price changes from $1.10 to 
$0.50 per cup?*
3.2 CHANGES IN DEMAND
As with supply, we distinguish between a change in “quantity demanded” and a change in 
demand. When there is a change in demand, the whole demand curve shifts due to a change 
in some factor other than a change in price.
Why might the whole demand curve shift? Suppose that our demand curve in Figure 4.4 
is based on buying patterns at the beginning of a semester. During ﬁnal exams, we might 
expect the overall demand for coffee to increase. Such a change in demand is presented in 
Figure 4.5. Our initial demand curve is D1, with a quantity demanded of 600 cups per week 
when price is $1.40 per cup. But during the ﬁnal exam period, the demand curve shifts to 
D2, with a quantity demanded of 900 cups per week at the same price of $1.40. In this case, 
we would say that “demand has risen (or increased)” or that “the demand curve has shifted 
out.” (Because of the curve’s negative slope, in this case shifting out also means shifting up, 
but again the normal approach in economics is to refer to curves moving horizontally rather 
than vertically.)

THE THEORY OF DEMAND

3.3 NONPRICE DETERMINANTS OF DEMAND
We can identify ﬁve nonprice determinants of demand that can shift the entire demand 
curve:
1. changes in buyers’ tastes and preferences
2. changes in buyers’ income and other assets
3. changes in the prices of related goods and services
4. changes in buyers’ expectations about the future
5. a change in the number of buyers in the market
Suppose that a news story comes out that says drinking more than one cup of coffee per 
day is harmful to your health. This could lead to a decrease in demand as coffee drinkers 
decide to cut back on their consumption. Such a decrease in demand is illustrated in Figure 
4.6. In this case, the demand curve shifts back (to the left) to D2, and the quantity demanded 
falls from 600 to 400 per week. Marketers seek to increase demand through advertising 
campaigns, such as the ads for new Apple products that can lead to many consumers waiting 
in line to buy something the day that it becomes available.
A change in buyers’ income can shift market demand curves. For example, the 2007–9 
recession in the United States reduced income for many households and thus their demand 
for various products such as restaurant meals and new automobiles.
We can deﬁne two types of “related” goods and services (nonprice determinant #3). First, 
there exist substitute goods for most market products, that is, a good that can be used in 
place of another good. For coffee, substitutes include tea and caffeinated energy drinks. If the 
price of tea were to increase signiﬁcantly, say as a result of poor weather conditions in tea-
exporting countries such as Sri Lanka and India, we would expect the demand for coffee to 
increase. Meanwhile, if the price of tea were to fall, we would expect the demand for coffee 
to decrease as some coffee drinkers switch to tea instead.
The other type of related goods are complementary goods, or goods that tend to be used 
along with other goods. Examples of complementary goods for coffee include cream and 
doughnuts. If someone frequently purchases coffee along with a doughnut, a signiﬁcant 
increase in doughnut prices may cause that person to reduce his demand for coffee.

CHAPTER 4 — SUPPLY AND DEMAND
Like suppliers, buyers can adjust their behavior based on future expectations (nonprice 
determinant #4). If you expect several days of late-night studying for ﬁnal exams in several 
weeks, you might temporarily reduce your demand for coffee so that it will have a greater 
effect on you when you really need it to study.*
The last nonprice determinant of demand is the number of potential buyers in the market. 
Obviously, the demand for coffee will shift depending on whether we are looking at the 
summer months when many students are away or the normal school months.
Discussion Questions
1. Explain verbally why the demand curve slopes downward.
2. Verbally explain the difference between a change in “quantity demanded” and a change 
in demand. Considering the demand side of the market for lawn-mowing services, what 
kind of change (increase or decrease, in quantity demanded or demand) would each of 
the following events cause?
a. A new ofﬁce park, surrounded by several acres of lawn, is built.
b. A drought is declared, and lawn watering is banned.
c. The going price for lawn-mowing services rises.
d. A more natural, wild yard becomes the “in” thing, as people grow concerned about 
the effects of fertilizers and pesticides on the environment.
4. THE THEORY OF MARKET ADJUSTMENT
Now that we have considered sellers and buyers separately, it is time to bring them together. 
We will see how the interaction of supply and demand can determine what the price of 
coffee will be and how much coffee will be sold. Remember that with our relatively simple 
model, we assume that all coffee in our market will sell for the same price. But what will 
that price be?
4.1 SURPLUS, SHORTAGE, AND EQUILIBRIUM
Using the original supply and demand curves, reproduced here in Figure 4.7, we can look for 
the answer. Let’s suppose, for whatever reason, that the price of coffee is initially $1.40 per 
cup. As we see in Figure 4.7, at this relatively high price, coffee sellers are prepared to sell 
1,000 cups of coffee per week, but buyers are interested in buying only 600 cups. (You can 
check these numbers in Tables 4.1 and 4.2.) Economists call a situation in which the quantity 
supplied is greater than the quantity demanded a surplus. This is illustrated in the upper part 
of Figure 4.7, where there is a surplus, or excess supply, of 400 cups of coffee.
If a market is in a situation of surplus, what would we expect to happen? Imagine that at 
the start of the week, coffee sellers are equipped to sell 1,000 cups of coffee. At the end of the 
week, they ﬁnd that they have sold only 600 cups, and they have a large leftover inventory 
of coffee supplies. Coffee sellers realize that they need to attract more customers, so they 
will respond to the surplus by lowering their price. Assuming that all sellers respond equally 
(which is unlikely in the real world, but it simpliﬁes our model at this point), the prevailing 
price will be somewhat lower the next week. We do not necessarily know how much lower 
it will be, but there will be downward pressure on prices whenever there is a surplus.**
surplus: a situation 
in which the quantity 
that sellers are pre-
pared to sell at a par-
ticular price exceeds 
the quantity that buy-
ers are willing to buy 
at that price
 *There is surprisingly little research on whether the consumption of caffeine actually is associated with improved 
academic performance. It is clear, however, that excessive use of caffeine is associated with several negative health effects 
including increased blood pressure, seizures, and headaches.
**If one particular coffee seller lowers his price in response to the surplus, pressure will be created on other sellers to 
lower their prices as well. Thus the most likely outcome in response to the surplus would be lower prices.

 
THE THEORY OF MARKET ADJUSTMENT 
99
Let’s say that the next week the prevailing price is lowered from $1.40 to $1.30. Looking 
at Figure 4.7, we see that there would still be a surplus (the quantity supplied exceeds the 
quantity demanded), but the surplus would be a little smaller. Thus there would still be 
downward pressure on prices as long as a surplus existed.
Now let’s consider the opposite situation. Assume that the initial price of coffee is relatively 
low, at $0.80 per cup. As shown in Figure 4.7, at this price sellers are prepared to sell only 
400 cups per week while the quantity demanded is 800 cups. A situation in which the quantity 
demanded exceeds the quantity supplied is referred to as a shortage.
What would we expect to happen in a market with a shortage? Before we even get to 
the end of the week, the suppliers’ inventory will be depleted and they will end up turning 
away customers who want to buy coffee. Realizing that there is excess demand for coffee, 
sellers will conclude that they can probably charge a little more for coffee and still have a 
sufﬁcient number of customers. So whenever there is a situation of shortage, there will be 
upward pressure on prices.*
So if the prevailing price is “too high” (a surplus), there will be downward pressure on 
prices, and if the price is “too low” (a shortage), there will be upward pressure on prices. Where 
will prices be “just right”? Starting from either a surplus or shortage, we see in Figure 4.8 
that market adjustments will push the price toward $1.10 per cup. At this price, the quantity 
demanded equals the quantity supplied at 700 cups of coffee per week. (Check Tables 4.1 
and 4.2 to conﬁrm this.)
Economists call this a situation in which the “market clears” and a market equilibrium 
(market-clearing equilibrium) is reached. “Equilibrium” describes a situation that has 
reached a resting point, where there are no forces to acting to change it. (Economists borrowed 
this term from natural science.) In a market situation, equilibrium is reached when the

prices. So even if everyone does not raise prices immediately, the overall tendency will be toward higher prices in a situation

At a price of $1.40 per cup, we 
have a situation of surplus (the 
quantity supplied exceeds the 
quantity demanded), and there 
is downward pressure on price. 
At a price of $0.80 per cup we 
have a situation of shortage (the 
quantity demanded exceeds the 
quantity supplied), and there is

CHAPTER 4 — SUPPLY AND DEMAND
quantity supplied is equal to the quantity demanded. The price will stop falling or rising and 
the quantity sold will stay constant as long as there are no other changes.
The theory of market adjustment says that market forces will tend to make price and 
quantity move toward the equilibrium point. Surpluses will lead to declines in price, and 
shortages will lead to rises in price. Surplus and shortage are both instances of market 
disequilibrium. Only at the equilibrium price and quantity is there no tendency to change. 
In this example, the equilibrium price is $1.10 per cup and the equilibrium quantity is 700 
cups per week (Figure 4.8).

4.2 MARKET FORCES AND OTHER FORCES
We know that market forces will tend to push the price of coffee toward the equilibrium price, 
but how long will this adjustment process take? Just a couple of weeks, a month, maybe 
longer? We do not know, as our simple model doesn’t address this issue.* In the real world, 
some markets have adjustment processes that lead rapidly to equilibrium. In highly organized 
stock markets and other auction-like markets, thousands of trades may take place every min-
ute, as buyers and sellers ﬁnd each other and quickly negotiate a price. Such a market can 
probably be thought of as in equilibrium, or moving quickly toward equilibrium, nearly all 
the time. (When we look at stock markets, it is evident that the price/quantity combinations 
that constitute equilibrium now may be quite different from the conditions for equilibrium 
tomorrow—or even 15 minutes from now.)
In other markets, however, adjustment to equilibrium may take months or years—if it 
happens at all. The market forces that we have just examined are not the only forces in the 
world. For example, hospital administrators complained for decades about a shortage of 
nurses. The obvious solution, from the point of view of labor supply and demand, would be 
for hospitals to offer higher wages, thus increasing the incentives for people to enter (and 

 
THE THEORY OF MARKET ADJUSTMENT 
101
stay in) nursing careers while also reducing the quantity demanded. As in Figure 4.7, market 
forces would then move us from shortage to equilibrium.
If you study the strategies used by hospitals to combat the shortage, however, you will note 
that offering higher wages is rarely one of them. Instead, larger training programs, signing 
bonuses, and forced overtime (which reduces the quality of life for workers and the quality 
of patient care) have often been used to try to ﬁll the gap. Various explanations have been 
suggested as to why the nursing wage is not rising to clear the market. On the demand side, 
hospital management may discount the importance of nurses to patient well-being, preferring 
to devote ﬁnancial resources to high-tech medicine. On the supply side, unionizing and 
ﬁghting for higher wages can be emotionally and ethically difﬁcult for health-care personnel, 
because striking can mean refusing help to people in need (special features of labor markets 
are discussed further in Chapter 10).
More generally, the forces that can work against quick movement toward equilibrium 
include such human characteristics as habit or ignorance. Slow production processes and 
long-term contracts may also slow down or stop adjustment. A seller may keep a good at its 
accustomed price long after it has failed to clear, or the back orders have begun to mount 
up, simply because she is slow to change. A common reason for slow adjustment is a lack 
of information. To be sure, the corner grocer knows which products are or are not moving; 
increasingly, sophisticated computerized systems are feeding this information back up the 
supply chain, to speed up price adjustment. However, in many parts of the world, and in 
some industries even in industrialized countries, information is slow to get to those who make 
some of the essential pricing decisions. Consumers, too, often lack information or behave 
on the basis of habit.
Equilibrium analysis is limited by the reality of constant change in the world, and 
nonmarket forces may effectively combat the equilibrating tendency of market forces. 
Market adjustment analysis can, however, tell us what to expect from normal market forces. 
Most generally, disequilibrium situations create forces that tend to push prices toward an 
equilibrium level.
4.3 SHIFTS IN SUPPLY AND DEMAND
Our model predicts that after we reach equilibrium, the price will stay the same. In the real 
world, however, we observe that prices change quite frequently. For example, consider the 
change in housing prices in the United States over the past few decades, as noted in the intro-
duction to this chapter. Constantly ﬂuctuating prices are also common in fossil-fuel markets, 
minerals such as gold and copper, and consumer electronics. And as we noted at the beginning 
of this chapter, coffee prices have varied signiﬁcantly over time.
Many price changes can be explained, and in some cases even predicted in advance, by 
using our microeconomic market model. We can determine how a shift in one (or both) of our 
curves, as a result of a change in one or more nonprice determinants, will lead to a change 
in the equilibrium price and quantity.
Returning to our coffee market, let’s suppose that a new seller enters the market. As we 
discussed earlier, this is a change in a nonprice determinant of supply and will shift the supply 
curve out (to the right). This is shown in Figure 4.9 with the supply curve shifting from S1 
to S2. Our initial equilibrium is point E1 with a price of $1.10 and a quantity of 700 cups 
per week. But note that with the entry of the new coffee seller shifting the supply curve to 
S2, and assuming that initially price stays at $1.10, we go from equilibrium to a situation of 
surplus (as shown in Figure 4.9). At a price of $1.10 per cup, the quantity supplied exceeds 
the quantity demanded with the new supply curve of S2.
Just as before, a situation of surplus creates downward pressure on prices. But realize that 
as sellers lower their prices, the quantity demanded increases as we move along the demand 
curve. As long as a surplus continues to exist, there is downward pressure on prices, leading 

102 
CHAPTER 4 — SUPPLY AND DEMAND
to further movement along the demand curve. The surplus is eventually eliminated when we 
reach point E2, the new equilibrium. The increase in supply has resulted in:
s  A DECREASE IN THE EQUILIBRIUM PRICE
s  AN INCREASE IN THE EQUILIBRIUM QUANTITY
What if, instead, we have a decrease in supply? Suppose one coffee seller decides to stop 
selling coffee. In this case, the supply curve would shift to the left. The new equilibrium 
would result in a high price and a lower quantity sold. (Try this yourself by drawing a graph 
similar to Figure 4.9 but with the supply curve shifting in the opposite direction.)
Now let’s consider what happens when the demand curve shifts. Suppose we have an 
increase in demand in the campus area as a result of a large incoming freshman class. Figure 
4.10 shows an increase in demand (the demand curve shifts to the right) from D1 to D2. 
This creates a temporary situation of a shortage, in which the quantity demanded exceeds 
the quantity supplied. Sellers perceive the shortage and respond by slightly raising prices. 
With the higher prices, we move along the supply curve as sellers are willing to supply 
more coffee.
As long as the shortage persists, we have continued upward pressure on prices and further 
movement along the supply curve. The shortage is eventually eliminated when we reach point 
E2, the new market-clearing equilibrium. The increase in demand has resulted in:
s  AN INCREASE IN THE EQUILIBRIUM QUANTITY
s  AN INCREASE IN THE EQUILIBRIUM PRICE
Note that with an increase in supply or an increase in demand, the equilibrium quantity 
increases. But the effect on price differs—prices rise with an increase in demand but fall with 
an increase in supply. This should align with your expectations even before you took this 
class. If people want more of a product, it makes sense that prices should rise. An increase 
in the availability (supply) of something should drive prices down. Our microeconomic

model tells a common sense story about market adjustment, although perhaps in a somewhat 
complex manner.
What would we expect if demand instead decreases, say due to a news story that indicates 
that drinking coffee is harmful to your health? The demand curve would shift inward (to the 
left), and we would expect a lower equilibrium price and a lower equilibrium quantity.
Note that when the supply curve shifts, the resulting change in equilibrium price and 
quantity are in the opposite direction. But when the demand curve shifts, price and quantity 
change in the same direction. We summarize what happens when one of the market curves 
shift in Table 4.3.

An increase in demand creates a 
shortage, and upward pressure on 
price. The new equilibrium occurs at 
point E2, with a higher price and a 
higher quantity sold.
What if both curves shift at the same time? What if, for example, there is a concurrent 
increase in the number of sellers of coffee and an increase in the number of potential buyers 
of coffee? We analyze this situation in Figure 4.11. Supply increases from S1 to S2 and demand 
increases from D1 to D2. The initial equilibrium is E1, and the new equilibrium, once the 
market fully adjusts, is E2. Both shifts tend to increase equilibrium quantity (see Table 4.3), 
so we can unambiguously state that the overall result will be an increase in the quantity of 
coffee sold, as shown in Figure 4.11.
But the effect on price is more difﬁcult to discern. Although an increase in demand 
tends to increase the equilibrium price, an increase in supply tends to decrease prices. 
Looking at Figure 4.11, we cannot tell whether the net effect is an increase or decrease in 

104 
CHAPTER 4 — SUPPLY AND DEMAND
price. Although it looks as if price has stayed about the same, note that if we shifted one 
of the curves a little more, or a little less, the net result could be a price increase or a price 
decrease. 
Whenever both curves shift at the same time, we can make an unambiguous statement 
about how one of our market variables (price or quantity) will change, but not the other. The 
net effect on one variable will depend on the relative magnitudes of the shifts in the curves. 
Table 4.4 summarizes the market results if both curves shift. You should conﬁrm these 
conclusions based on your own market graphs. See Box 4.2 for a real-world application of 
our market model to the international coffee market.

TOPICS IN MARKET ANALYSIS 
105
5. TOPICS IN MARKET ANALYSIS
Now that we understand the basic functioning of microeconomic markets, we can begin to 
assess markets in terms of their ability to explain real-world economic outcomes and their 
ability to produce conditions that truly enhance well-being. As we proceed through this book, 
further developing and analyzing our market model, we seek to gain insights into where 
markets currently function well, where markets can be made to function better, and where 
markets do not offer the best way to allocate society’s resources.
5.1 REAL-WORLD PRICES
The workings of markets in the real world may differ in some ways from the assumptions 
in the model constructed above. We discuss this in detail in later chapters, but here are three 
cases in which individuals or businesses may manage prices in ways that are not predicted 
by the simple model of supply and demand.
The Cost of Changing Prices
First let’s revisit the coffee example, noting that, in reality, the price of coffee in your col-
lege’s neighborhood probably does not change very often. This contradicts the expectation 
that the market demand curve should shift at the start of each semester when students return 
(demand should increase) and at the end of the semester when they leave (demand should 
decrease). Even though the quantity sold surely ﬂuctuates depending on whether college is 
in session, prices are rather stable.
BOX 4.2 COFFEE MARKETS IN THE REAL WORLD
After reaching a 14-year high in May 2011, wholesale 
coffee bean prices began to tumble. By July 2013 
prices for arabica beans, the most-consumed coffee 
in the world, had fallen over 60 percent. How can our 
market model provide insights into changing coffee 
prices in the real world?
Our model suggests that falling prices can occur 
either due to an increase in supply or a decrease in 
demand, or both. According to data from the United 
States Department of Agriculture, global coffee sup-
plies increased over this time period. At the same time, 
consumption in coffee-growing countries and coffee 
exports both increased. So these data suggest that the 
main reason prices fell so much over 2011–13 was 
an increase in the supply of coffee.
In the 2012/2013 growing season Brazil, the 
world’s largest coffee producer, had a bumper crop 
with production up 14 percent over the previous year. 
Vietnam, the world’s second-largest producer, has 
been scaling up its coffee production in recent years. 
Between 2010 and 2012 production there increased 
nearly 30 percent. Other major coffee-producing 
countries, including Colombia and Indonesia, also 
had production gains. 
With coffee bean prices so low, you may wonder 
why in June 2013 Starbucks announced that it was 
increasing its prices. According to a Starbucks spokes-
man, the reasons for the price increase included 
higher costs for labor, raw materials, and rent. The 
cost of the actual coffee beans represents a minor 
portion of the total cost of producing a retail cup of 
coffee. So Starbucks raising its coffee prices can be 
explained by an increase in input prices, which would 
be modeled as a shift of their supply curve. The price 
increase could also reﬂect a response to an increase 
in the demand for Starbucks coffee.

Markets and Trade,” Foreign Agricultural Service, June 2013;

2. Have you ever found yourself shut out of a class that you wanted to take because it was 
already full? Or has this happened to a friend of yours? Analyze this situation in terms 
of surplus or shortage. Are classes supplied through “a market” similar to what has been 
described in this chapter?

106 
CHAPTER 4 — SUPPLY AND DEMAND
One reason is that steady, long-term customers (who are local residents, not students) will 
be offended by seeing prices “opportunistically” go up when the students arrive. This can 
give a shop a bad name—and reputation is important for most sellers. Another reason is that 
changing prices entails costs. For example, a restaurant with printed menus may keep prices 
ﬁxed even though demand increases because the cost of printing new menus would offset 
the additional revenue.
In fact, rather than responding according to each change that might affect them, retailers 
like the ones where you buy your morning cup of coffee commonly set prices using markup 
(or cost-plus) pricing. Using this method, they determine how much it costs them to make 
or supply a product and then set its price including a percentage increase over their costs. 
Markups can vary from as low as 10–15 percent for some goods to 200 percent or more for 
products such as high-end jewelry or art.
Taking a Loss on One Item to Promote Sales of Other Items
To give another example, during the annual holiday season in December, the demand for 
electronic products such as televisions and computers increases signiﬁcantly. According to 
our model, the increase in demand should lead to an increase in prices. But most retailers 
lower their electronics prices during the holiday season. One reason is that competition among 
retailers heats up at this time of the year (many retailers in the United States expect that 
30–60 percent of total annual sales take place between late November and early January). A 
retailer that raised the price of its most popular item during this time could lose out if other 
businesses are lowering theirs. In fact, during the holiday season, some retailers lower their 
prices on some products so much that they actually lose money on each sale. The rationale 
is that even though they lose money on sales of those items (called “loss leaders”) custom-
ers will be attracted to the stores and end up buying other, nondiscounted products so that 
overall proﬁts will increase.
Taking Advantage of Differences Among Consumers’ Willingness and Ability to Pay
A real-world market that seems to follow our predictions more closely in some respects is 
the market for air travel during the holidays. Here we have an increase in demand that usu-
ally produces the predicted price increases: A quick check online reveals that the price of a 
round-trip ticket between Boston and Los Angeles costs about $250 in early December, but 
rises to over $700 a few days before Christmas! Why is this different from the electronics 
case? Why doesn’t one airline decide to keep its prices low and increase its ticket sales? One 
reason is that airlines cannot offer loss leaders because they do not have another product to 
sell to make up for lower-priced ticket sales. Moreover, as long as an airline can ﬁll its planes 
at relatively high prices during the holidays, it has no incentive to lower its prices. (We ex-
plore the role of competition in markets in more detail in Chapters 17 and 18.) At the same 
time, however, airlines do attempt to create “brand loyalty” by giving various advantages to 
“frequent ﬂyers.”
5.2 MARKETS AND EQUITY
Markets can be viewed as rationing mechanisms—they determine who gets what. Usually, 
people think of rationing in terms of government action in times of shortage. For example, 
during World War II people were issued ration cards indicating how much of certain foods 
and gasoline they would be allowed to buy.
Freedom of choice is often emphasized as an outstanding characteristic of markets, so 
it may seem strange to view markets as a way to ration society’s resources. But note in our 
coffee example that there are people who want coffee (or more coffee) but do not get it. 
The section of a demand curve to the right of the equilibrium quantity consists of potential 
markup (or cost-
plus) pricing: a 
method of setting 
prices in which the 
seller adds a ﬁxed 
percentage amount 
to his or her costs of 
production

 
TOPICS IN MARKET ANALYSIS 
107
consumers who are willing and able to pay prices lower than the equilibrium price for the 
good or service. So if the equilibrium price of coffee is $1.10 per cup, as in Figure 4.8, there 
are more people who would buy coffee if the price were reduced to, say, $0.70 per cup. Has 
the rationing function of the market resulted in the “right” amount of coffee being produced 
and sold?
Of course, this is a normative question, involving one’s values and beliefs. In the market 
for coffee, society probably is not too concerned that some people who want coffee do not 
buy it at the equilibrium price. Some of these people may simply not like coffee all that 
much. Others might believe that they cannot afford to buy coffee from a retailer every day, 
preferring to make their own at a lower cost. Given the availability of alternatives and the fact 
that coffee is not necessarily an essential good, we may conclude that the amount of coffee 
sold is approximately the “right” amount.
The fact that markets produce about the “right” amount of many goods and services, such 
as television sets, backpacks, haircuts, and pencils, is a rather amazing accomplishment. No 
central authority is telling manufacturers how much of these products to offer. Private sellers 
act in a decentralized, voluntary manner. Motivated by proﬁts and responding to consumer 
demands, they produce quantities of these goods and services that many would consider 
about right.
But do markets produce “too much” of some goods and services, and “too little” of others? 
As mentioned before, markets respond to effective demand, backed by a willingness and ability 
to pay. Billions of dollars are spent every year on luxury yachts, presumably enhancing the 
well-being of those who buy them. Companies that build yachts are responding to consumer 
demand. If there were a greater demand for, say, public transportation, then such companies 
might be making buses or trains instead. But companies will prefer to build yachts as long 
as they are more highly valued in markets.
But we can differentiate between market value and social value. Market value is deﬁned 
according to effective demand—the maximum amount that economic actors are willing and 
able to pay for something. Market value can, in theory, be measured positively, without 
normative judgments. Social value is more difﬁcult to deﬁne and measure. We broadly 
deﬁne the social value of an outcome according to the extent to which it moves us toward 
our ﬁnal goals. So if “fairness” is one of our ﬁnal goals, then it should be part of how we 
assess the social value of an economic outcome. But even if we had an accepted way to 
measure fairness, we would still need to make a normative judgment about how much 
fairness is appropriate.
Although yacht production may maximize the market value of production, it may not 
maximize social value. Devoting yacht-building resources to public transportation, basic 
health care, or public education may yield greater social value.
5.3 SHORTAGE, SCARCITY, AND INADEQUACY
In thinking about the fairness of market outcomes, it is important to distinguish between 
conditions of “shortage,” “scarcity,” and “inadequacy.” These different terms have distinct 
meanings in economic analysis.
We have seen that a shortage is a situation in which willing and able buyers are unable to 
ﬁnd goods to buy at the going price. We usually think of this as the result of disequilibrium, 
but it may also be deliberately created. Sometimes producers intentionally choose a production 
and pricing strategy that will create shortages, such as the one used for selling luxury cars. 
The shortage could be eliminated, and equilibrium achieved, if producers raised the price 
enough. However, they have calculated that their long-run proﬁtability will be higher if they 
permit a shortage to create a mystique around their product. 
Economists think of scarcity as a more general condition. As we discussed in Chapter 1, 
a fundamental scarcity of resources relative to everything that people might need or want 
market value: the 
maximum amount 
that economic actors 
are willing and able 
to pay for a good or 
service (i.e., effective 
demand)
social value: the 
extent to which an 
outcome moves us 
toward our ﬁnal goals

108 
CHAPTER 4 — SUPPLY AND DEMAND
is what requires individuals and societies to make choices. Scarcity is about an imbalance 
between what is available and what people would like to have, regardless of what they can 
afford. Many people would like to have a Rolls-Royce or a Lamborghini, but these luxury 
cars are scarce because not everyone can buy one. But even cups of coffee are scarce in 
that price acts as a rationing mechanism in which some people decide not to buy all the 
coffee that they might theoretically want.
Not all kinds of scarcity are alike. We tend to feel differently about the scarcity of Rolls-
Royces or Lamborghinis (there are still plenty of other cars that people can purchase to meet 
their transportation needs) and the scarcity of affordable housing. We use the term inadequacy 
to refer to scarcity when it involves something that is necessary for minimal human well-
being but is not obtainable by everyone who needs it. Food, shelter, and basic health care, 
for example, can be in inadequate supply relative to needs.
While markets can eliminate shortages, and general scarcity is a fact of life, markets 
normally do not address problems of inadequacy. However, if economics is truly about meeting 
needs and enhancing well-being, then we need mechanisms to supplement markets to reduce 
problems of inadequacy, such as provision of some goods and services by governments or 
other public purpose actors.
5.4 PRECISION VERSUS ACCURACY
Returning one last time to our coffee example, recall that the initial equilibrium price was exactly 
$1.10 per cup (Figure 4.8). We assumed that this price would be the same at all coffee shops 
in the area. In the real world, one coffee shop might sell coffee for $0.99 per cup, another for 
$1.10, while a third charges $1.25. Does this observation conﬂict with our basic model?
One response is that each coffee shop faces a separate demand curve for its coffee. So the 
equilibrium price at one shop may differ from the equilibrium price at another, depending 
on such factors as their relative labor costs, the quality of their coffee, or the ambiance of 
each shop. (This situation is discussed further in Chapter 18.) But even if market conditions 
are similar for different coffee shops, we may still observe some variation in prices.
The model presented here is precise because it describes outcomes exactly, such as our 
equilibrium price being exactly $1.10 per cup. The advantage of precision is that we have 
eliminated uncertainty. Another example of precision is making an economic prediction that 
the unemployment rate at the end of next year will be exactly 6.0 percent. However, when 
we are being precise we run the risk of being inaccurate. Our unemployment rate prediction 
will likely turn out to be wrong. A prediction that stands a better chance of being accurate 
is saying that the unemployment rate will be between 5 percent and 7 percent. An accurate 
prediction is one that is correct, even if only in a general way.
Often there is a tradeoff between accuracy and precision. Rather than saying that the 
equilibrium coffee price is precisely $1.10 per cup, it may be more accurate to say that the 
equilibrium price is between $1.00 and $1.20 per cup. The distinction between precision 
and accuracy is one that we face frequently. The statement “He is middle-aged” is untrue of 
a 20-year-old and a 70-year-old and perhaps clearly true of a 45-year-old. But middle age 
does not begin abruptly at 40 or 43, nor does it end abruptly some years later. Rather, it is a 
more or less appropriate description of people at varying ages. “He is middle-aged” may be 
perfectly accurate, without being precise.
Ideally, we would like our economic analyses to be characterized by both accuracy and 
precision—but sometimes we have to choose between these qualities. How should we decide 
which to choose?
Precision often has the virtue of simplicity. For example, it is easier to contemplate a single 
point than it is to deal with ranges of various possibilities. Precision and simplicity together 
are qualities that are often helpful—sometimes essential—to translate economic concepts 
into readily understood mathematical representations and graphs.
precise: describes 
something that is ex-
act (though it may be 
unrealistic)
accurate: describes 
something that is cor-
rect (even if only in a 
general way)
inadequacy: a situa-
tion in which there is 
not enough of a good 
or service, provided 
at prices people can 
afford, to meet mini-
mal requirements for 
human well-being

 
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
109
In contrast, accuracy is especially important when we are attempting to understand the 
real world. We keep the theory “in our head” to help us understand economic activity, but 
what we actually observe is often more messy and complicated than a simple graph could 
represent, as our discussion of electronics and plane tickets suggested.
If we mistakenly confuse precision with accuracy, then we might be misled into thinking 
that an explanation expressed in precise mathematical or graphical terms is somehow more 
rigorous or useful than one that takes into account particulars of history, institutions, or business 
strategy. This is not the case. Therefore, it is important not to put too much conﬁdence in the 
apparent precision of supply and demand graphs. Supply and demand analysis is a useful, 
precisely formulated, conceptual tool that helps gain an abstract understanding of a complex 
world. It does not—nor should it be expected to—also give us an accurate and complete 
description of any particular real-world market.

Elasticity
In 2012 the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), which operates buses, 
subways, and commuter trains in the Boston area, raised its fares in order to address major 
budget deﬁcits. Based on what we learned in Chapter 4, we would expect overall ridership to 
decline when fares are raised (a decrease in the quantity demanded). So we have two market 
forces affecting the MBTA’s revenues, working in opposite directions:
s  4HE FARE INCREASE WOULD BRING THE -"4! MORE REVENUE FOR EACH RIDE TAKEN
s  4HE FARE INCREASE WOULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF RIDES TAKEN
Whether the MBTA’s total revenue increases as a result of the fare increase depends on 
how responsive riders are to price changes. In order to plan properly, the MBTA needed to 
estimate how much the quantity demanded would decline with an increase in fare prices. If 
ridership decreases only a little, then total revenue would probably increase. However, if the 
fare increase causes ridership to decline signiﬁcantly, then perhaps revenues would actually 
decrease.
This is one example in which economists, businesses, or policymakers require information 
about the responsiveness of the quantity demanded, or the quantity supplied, to price changes. 
For example, a restaurant may wish to know how its customers will respond to higher prices. 
A state government may need to estimate how its revenues will change if it increases taxes 
on cigarettes or another product. Agencies that monitor trafﬁc patterns may want to know 
how much vehicle travel will respond to changes in gas prices.
In this chapter, we introduce the concept of elasticity. Elasticity measures the responsiveness 
of economic actors to changes in market factors, including price and income. The most 
common kinds of elasticity are those related to changes in the quantity demanded or quantity 
supplied with changes in price (i.e., movement along a demand or supply curve). But we 
can also measure elasticity with respect to changes in income or other nonprice determinants 
(i.e., shifts in demand or supply).
1. THE PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND
When the MBTA raised its prices in July 2012, by an average of 23 percent, do you think 
ridership declined a little or a lot? It depends on the price elasticity of demand (often just 
called the “elasticity of demand”), which is the responsiveness of the quantity demanded to a 
change in price. Elasticity of demand is the particular elasticity most studied by economists. 
Businesses can use information on the elasticity of demand for their products to set prices. 
Governments can use elasticity of demand estimates to determine how much revenue they 
will raise with a tax on a particular product.
elasticity: a measure 
of the responsiveness 
of an economic actor 
to changes in market 
factors, including price 
and income

THE PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND 
113
1.1 PRICE-INELASTIC DEMAND
Demand for a good is price inelastic if the effect of a price change on the quantity demanded 
is fairly small. Demand might be price inelastic for three main reasons:
1. There are very few good, close substitutes for the good or service.
2. The good or service is something that people need, rather than just want.
3. The cost of the good or service is a very small part of a buyer’s budget.
For example, gasoline has no good, close substitutes for powering nonelectric motor 
vehicles. When gas prices rise, most drivers still need to use their vehicles to get to work, run 
errands, and so on. So gasoline is an example of a good that is price inelastic because of the 
lack of any good substitutes and because people believe that they need it. Other examples of 
goods that tend to be price inelastic for these reasons include water for basic needs, essential 
health care, and electricity.
Some goods are price inelastic because expenditures on them represent such a small 
portion of people’s incomes that most consumers are not affected much by a change in 
prices. Consider that a 50 percent increase in the price of dental ﬂoss is not likely to reduce 
the quantity demanded signiﬁcantly.
1.2 PRICE-ELASTIC DEMAND
Conversely, demand for a good is price elastic if the effect of a price change on the quantity 
demanded is fairly large. Demand may be price elastic for three main reasons:
1. The good has a number of good, close substitutes.
2. The good is merely wanted, rather than needed.
3. The cost of the good makes up a large part of the budget of the buyer.
An example of a good that is likely to be price elastic is orange juice. This product is not 
necessary for most people, and various substitutes exist, such as apple juice or other fruit juices. 
Although gasoline is a price-inelastic good, the elasticity of demand for a particular brand of 
gasoline is likely to be very elastic. Gasoline may not have readily available substitutes, but the 
gasoline from Exxon-Mobil or BP does. For another example of elastic demand, see Box 5.1.
To the extent that a good is merely wanted (e.g., ice cream), rather than needed (e.g., 
essential medicines), demand for it will tend to be more elastic. Studies typically ﬁnd that 
demand for airline travel is more elastic for people going on vacation than for business 
travelers. Demand also tends to be more price elastic when the good makes up a large part of 
the budget of the buyer, because then the buyer will be more motivated to seek out substitutes 
when prices increase.
1.3 MEASURING PRICE ELASTICITY
To obtain useful economic forecasts, we need to be more precise than simply stating that 
quantity demand changes “a little” or “a lot” in response to a given price change. The elastic-
ity of demand is mathematically calculated as:
	
	 			
	
where the vertical bars indicate absolute value. As we discussed in Chapter 4, price and the 
quantity demanded normally change in opposite directions (an inverse relationship), so the 
price-inelastic de-
mand: a relationship 
between price and 
quantity demanded 
characterized by rela-
tively weak responses 
of buyers to price 
changes
price-elastic de-
mand: a relationship 
between price and 
quantity demanded 
characterized by 
relatively strong re-
sponses of buyers to 
price changes

114 
CHAPTER 5 — ELASTICITY
fraction inside the vertical bars tends to be a negative number. For example, if price increases 
(a positive sign in the denominator of the fraction), we would expect the quantity demanded 
to decrease (a negative sign in the numerator of the fraction). So after dividing, we would 
end up with a negative number. Taking the absolute value turns the negative number into a 
positive number.
The reason we take the absolute value is so that when we talk about a “large” 
responsiveness to price, we can represent this using a “larger” number. If we did not 
take the absolute value, we would have to talk about –2 being “bigger” than –1, which 
would be confusing.*
An example illustrates how we calculate the price elasticity of demand for a particular 
good. Suppose that executives at Braeburn Publishing are trying to decide what price to charge 
for a new book of poetry. Although the ﬁrm competes with many other ﬁrms in the market 
for books in general, it has sole rights to sell this particular book, so it has some power over 
the price that it sets. In order to see how responsive demand for the new poetry book is to 
variations in price, Braeburn decides to test-market it in three locations that are very similar 
in terms of consumer preferences and incomes but are far enough apart geographically so that 
the company can set a different price in each location. Table 5.1 and Figure 5.1 show the data 
the marketing department has collected on prices and the quantity sold during the month of 
the test. As in this example, real empirical data on prices and quantities are generally limited 
to speciﬁc points along a demand curve without knowing data points for the entire demand 
curve. For simplicity, we have assumed that the demand curve is a straight line between the 
three known data points.
BOX 5.1 GYM MEMBERSHIPS AND ELASTICITY
The city of New York operates dozens of recreation 
centers, which offer facilities such as indoor pools, 
weight rooms, basketball courts, and dance centers. 
These centers offer a low-cost alternative to expensive 
private gyms.
In an effort to raise revenue, in 2011 the city doubled 
its recreation center adult membership fees, to $150 
per year for centers with pools and $100 per year for 
those without pools. The Parks Department projected 
that the fee increase would result in a 5 percent drop in 
memberships, but a $4 million increase in revenues. In 
other words, their analysis concluded that demand for 
the recreation centers was rather inelastic.
Instead, the fee change resulted in a 45 percent 
drop in membership, and a $200,000 decline in 
revenues! The demand for the city’s recreation cen-
ters turned out to be much more elastic than the city 
anticipated. In January 2013 the Parks Department 
Commissioner, Veronica M. White, acknowledged that 
the plan to increase revenues had backﬁred.
One change that she suggested was to make 
memberships available to those age 18–24 for only 
$25 per year, the same rate charged to seniors. 
Memberships for those under age 18 are free, so 
those turning 18 had to suddenly pay at least $100 
per year. Membership among this age group dropped 
by the highest percentage after the fee change, by 55 
percent. The Parks Department hopes that the new 
lower membership fees will encourage young adults 
to exercise, as 52 percent of young adult males and 
31 percent of young adult females in New York City 
are overweight or obese.
Many of the clientele of the recreation centers are 
low-income individuals. Thus the fee increase posed 
a particular hardship for them. Holly Leicht, executive 
director of New Yorkers for Parks, a nonproﬁt advocacy 
group, noted, “Thirty percent of Bronx residents alone 
are living at or below the poverty rate of $23,021 per 
year for a family of four. For these families, an extra 
$50 or $75 is often prohibitive.”

*If you look at economic studies that estimate the price elasticity of demand, sometimes the elasticity estimates are 
presented as negative numbers (i.e., they do not take the absolute value). Remember that price and quantity demanded almost 
always change in the opposite direction. So you can safely make this assumption, unless information is presented to the 
contrary.

 
THE PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND 
115
We can now calculate the price elasticity of demand for Braeburn’s poetry book. We work 
our way “up” the demand curve starting at the lowest price, $5. To calculate the percentage 
change in a variable, we deﬁne one number as the starting, or “base,” value and the other as 
the ending, or new, value. So, working up the demand curve, $5 would be our base value and 
$10 would be our new value. A percentage change is calculated as:

So, going from a base of $5 to a new value of $10, the percentage change is:
 
Percentage change in price = [($10 − $5)/$5] × 100
 
=  [$5/$5 × 100]
 
= 1 × 100
 
= 100%
For the percentage change in quantity demanded, our base is 1,000 and our new value is 
800. So the percentage change is:
 
Percentage change in quantity =  [(800 – 1,000)/1,000 ] × 100
 
=  [–200/1,000 ] × 100
 
=  –0.2 × 100
 
=  –20%

CHAPTER 5 — ELASTICITY
We can then calculate the elasticity of demand as the absolute value of the percentage 
change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price, or:
 
Elasticity =  | –20%/100% |
 
=  | –0.2 |
 
=  0.2
In this example, notice that the percentage change in the quantity demanded is less than 
the percentage change in price. Whenever this is the case, the elasticity value will be less 
than 1. This is the technical deﬁnition of price-inelastic demand.
The technical deﬁnition of price-elastic demand is that the percentage change in the 
quantity demanded is larger than the percentage change in price. With price-elastic demand, 
the elasticity value will be more than 1.
1.4 TWO EXTREME CASES
Perfectly Inelastic Demand
Perfectly inelastic demand means that quantity demanded does not respond at all to price 
changes. Suppose that you are on medication, and you must take exactly three pills a day to 
survive. Would a 10 percent increase in the price of the medication change the quantity that 
you demand? Chances are your demand would be perfectly inelastic in the range of that price 
change, because you unquestionably need the medicine.
Think about what a demand curve would look like for a good with perfectly inelastic 
demand. For any price level (i.e., any point on the vertical axis), the quantity demanded 
would be unchanged. Thus a perfectly inelastic demand curve would be a vertical line at 
the quantity demanded, as shown in Figure 5.2. As the quantity demanded is constant (i.e., 
percentage change is 0), the elasticity value for a good with a perfectly inelastic demand 
would be 0.
For a good with perfectly inelastic demand, such as lifesaving drugs and basic 
foodstuffs, proﬁt incentives may be at odds with social well-being. Because a seller of 
such a good could raise prices without reducing the quantity demanded, by continually 
raising prices, up to the absolute maximum that people could afford, the seller would 
maximize proﬁts.
For this reason, in markets for certain kinds of health-care commodities or basic foodstuffs, 
governments sometimes regulate prices to give the seller a fair return but not an excessive 
price-inelastic de-
mand (technical 
deﬁnition): the per-
centage change in the 
quantity demanded 
is smaller than the 
percentage change in 
price. The elasticity 
value is less than 1
price-elastic de-
mand (technical 
deﬁnition): the per-
centage change in the 
quantity demanded 
is larger than the 
percentage change in 
price. The elasticity 
value is more than 1
perfectly inelastic 
demand: the quantity 
demanded does not 
change at all when 
price changes. The 
elasticity value is 0

When the quantity demanded is constant 
regardless of price, demand is perfectly 
inelastic. When even a small increase in price 
will reduce the quantity demanded to zero, 
demand is perfectly elastic.

one while ensuring that many people will get what they need. Controversies have recently 
arisen in the United States over whether prices for pharmaceuticals and hospital stays are 
reasonable or are out of line with actual production costs and human needs.
Sometimes, sellers themselves are guided by notions of what is a “fair” price. Economists 
have noticed that, for example, few stores raise the price of umbrellas during rainstorms. 
The stores could almost certainly get away with charging higher prices to people whose 
only alternative is to get soaking wet. However, the sellers also know that if they want 
repeat business from their customers, they should not ruin their reputation for fair dealing 
by engaging in such price gouging.
Perfectly Elastic Demand
Perfectly elastic demand, by contrast, means that any price change, no matter how small, 
leads to an “inﬁnite” change in quantity demanded. This occurs when there is a “going price” 
for a particular good or service and any attempt to charge above that price will eliminate all 
demand for it. One case in which demand tends to be very elastic in the real world is in the 
market for general-skilled labor, when general-skilled workers are plentiful. Employers are 
the buyers, or demanders, in this case. If all you had to offer on the labor market were general 
skills, such as ﬂipping burgers or sweeping ﬂoors, then you and all workers similar to you 
would be the sellers, or suppliers. Chances are that you would face a demand curve for your 
labor that would be horizontal at the going wage. Competing against many other sellers, all 
with the same basic skills, you would have very little or no ability to affect the wage that you 
would get in the market.
A perfectly elastic demand curve would be horizontal at the “going price,” as shown in 
Figure 5.2. Almost any quantity can be sold at the going price, but charging even slightly 
above this price will reduce demand to 0. Because even a slight change in price will result 
in an “inﬁnite” change in quantity demanded, the elasticity value for a good with a perfectly 
elastic demand is essentially inﬁnite.
In reality, examples of perfectly elastic or perfectly inelastic demand curves are rare. 
However, actual demand curves may come close to these two extremes, at least for some 
portion of the demand curve.
1.5 DEMAND CURVES AND ELASTICITY
The Shape of a Demand Curve and Elasticity
Let’s take another look at Figure 5.1. We have already calculated the elasticity of the de-
mand curve when the price increased from $5 to $10, which was 0.2. Given that the demand 
“curve” is a straight line, you might think that the elasticity would also be 0.2 if the price 
increased further from $10 to $12. Let’s see if this is true, inserting the appropriate values 
from Table 5.1.

The elasticity value within this range of the demand curve is higher (more elastic) than it 
was previously. This result will be true for any straight-line, or linear, demand curve: As we 
perfectly elastic 
demand: any change 
in price leads to an 
inﬁnite change in 
quantity demanded. 
The elasticity value is 
inﬁnity.

118 
CHAPTER 5 — ELASTICITY
move “up” the demand curve (to the left), the elasticity value will increase. Often a linear 
demand curve will have both an elastic region (with an elasticity value greater than 1) and 
an inelastic region (with an elasticity value less than 1).*
This is illustrated in Figure 5.3. Note that at some point along this linear demand curve, the 
elasticity value is exactly 1. Economists call this unit-elastic demand, when the percentage 
change in the quantity demanded is exactly equal to the percentage change in price. This 
is shown as point A on the demand curve. (Note that the point of unit elasticity does not 
necessarily occur in the “middle” of a linear demand curve.)
Elasticity and the Direction of the Price Change
Next, let’s consider another question: Does the direction of the price change matter when 
calculating elasticity?
Referring again to our data in Table 5.1, let’s calculate elasticity with price decreasing from 
$10 to $5, instead of increasing from $5 to $10. Inserting the appropriate values, we get:

So while the elasticity value was 0.2 when price increased from $5 to $10, it is 0.5 when 
price decreases from $10 to $5, even though we are moving along the same exact segment of 
the demand curve! So when we quote an elasticity value for a particular good or service, do we 
also need to indicate whether this elasticity applies to a price increase or a price decrease?
Fortunately, this problem can be avoided. As explained in Box 5.2, we can use the 
“midpoint” formula to obtain the same elasticity value regardless of whether the price increases 
or decreases along the same segment of a linear demand curve.
*Economists often work with “constant-elasticity” demand curves, where the elasticity value is the same at any point 
along the demand curve. Constant-elasticity demand curves are actual curves, not straight lines, that bow in toward the origin. 
Constant-elasticity demand curves tend to be more realistic representations of demand for many goods and services.
unit-elastic de-
mand: the percent-
age change in the 
quantity demanded is 
exactly equal to the 
percentage change in 
price. The elasticity 
value is 1

THE PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND

Elasticity and Slope
You may recall from a math class that the equation for a straight line is:
y = b + m x
where m is the slope of the line and b is the intercept term. The slope deﬁnes the numerical 
change in the y value every time the x value increases by 1.
Some students mistakenly think that elasticity is the same thing as the slope of a linear 
demand curve. But note that the slope of the line in Figure 5.3 does not change. As we have 
already seen, the elasticity value differs as we move along a linear demand curve.
Although a “steeper” slope generally suggests a less elastic demand curve than a “ﬂatter” 
curve, we can make any demand curve look ﬂatter or steeper depending on how we draw 
(i.e., scale) the two axes. Compare Figure 5.4 to Figure 5.1. At ﬁrst glance, the demand 
curve in Figure 5.4 appears ﬂatter than the curve in Figure 5.1, suggesting that it is a more 
elastic demand curve. But the underlying data are exactly the same in the two ﬁgures—the 
x-axis in Figure 5.4 has merely been adjusted to start at a quantity of 700 rather than 0, 
making the curve appear ﬂatter. Thus we cannot determine elasticity, even approximately, 
simply by looking at a demand curve without making the necessary calculations.
1.6 ELASTICITY AND REVENUES
A common application of elasticity estimates is predicting how a company’s revenues will 
change in response to a price change. A business, such as Braeburn Publishing, can use an 
elasticity estimate to determine what price it should charge to maximize its revenues. Recall 
the example from the beginning of the chapter regarding the MBTA’s raising fares to eliminate 
a budget deﬁcit. If the MBTA had a reliable estimate of the elasticity of demand for public 
transportation, it could calculate how much revenues would be expected to change with dif-
ferent fare levels. Other government agencies can rely on elasticity estimates to determine 
how different tax rates will affect revenues.
BOX 5.2 THE MIDPOINT ELASTICITY FORMULA
The reason that the direction a price change matters 
when we calculate an elasticity value is that the de-
nominators change when we calculate the percentage 
change in each variable. The denominator used to 
calculate the percentage change is the “base” value. 
But by changing the direction of the change, the base 
value can be the higher or the lower number. So the key 
to obtaining the same elasticity value regardless of the 
direction of the price change is to obtain the same de-
nominators when calculating the percentage changes. 
We can do this by using the “midpoint formula.”
Consider our example of price changing from 
$5 to $10 (or vice versa). The percentage change is 
either 50 percent or 100 percent depending on the 
direction of the change. To use the midpoint formula, 
instead of using the base value as the denominator 
when calculating the percentage change, we use the 
midpoint, or average, of the two values:
Midpoint = (new number + base number)/2
So for the price change between $5 and $10, in 
either direction, the base value for the denominator 
when calculating the percentage change in price is 
now 7.5. For the quantity change, the midpoint be-
tween 800 and 1,000 is 900. Thus the elasticity value 
for a price increase from $5 to $10 using the midpoint 
formula would be:
Elasticity = |[(–200/900) x 100]/[(5/7.5) x 100]|
 
=  |–22.22/66.67|
 
=  0.3333
You can test yourself by proving that you get the 
same elasticity value if the price decreases from $10 
to $5. Note that the elasticity value here, 0.3333, is 
between our two previous elasticity estimates (0.2 and 
0.5) based on prices of $5 and $10. However, realize 
that the elasticity obtained using the midpoint formula 
is not the midpoint of the two elasticity values using 
the conventional approach.

120 
CHAPTER 5 — ELASTICITY
The revenues that a business (or government agency) will receive from selling a good or 
service at a speciﬁc price is simply that price multiplied by the quantity sold:
Revenues = Price × Quantity Sold
So in the case of Braeburn, the revenue that it obtains from selling 1,000 books at a price 
of $5 per book is:
Revenue = $5 × 1,000 = $5,000
We can also represent revenues graphically based on a demand curve. First, recall that 
the area of a rectangle is its height multiplied by its length. Thus the revenue obtained at any 
point on a demand curve can be shown as a rectangle equal to its height (price) multiplied 
by its length (quantity sold). This is illustrated in Figure 5.5, which is the same demand 
curve presented in Figure 5.1. At a price of $5, book revenues are equal to area A plus area 
B, which is $5,000.

We cannot make conclusions about 
elasticity simply by looking at a

Braeburn’s book revenues equal 
areas A+B at a price of $5 per book. 
Revenues equal areas A+C at a 
price of $10 per book.

 
THE PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND 
121
Now suppose that price is increased to $10—will revenues increase or decrease? We 
can see in Figure 5.5 that if the price is $10, revenues will be equal to area A plus area C. 
So increasing the price from $5 to $10, Braeburn loses area B in revenues but gains area C 
(Braeburn obtains area A at either price). From looking at the ﬁgure, it seems apparent that 
area C is greater than area B. So we can conclude that Braeburn’s revenues will increase as 
a result of a price increase. We can conﬁrm this by calculating revenues at a price of $10 as 
$8,000 ($10 × 800 books).
What does this have to do with elasticity? When we calculated the elasticity of demand 
moving from a price of $5 to a price of $10, we found that demand was price inelastic (with 
a value of 0.2). Whenever demand is price inelastic, increasing price will have a relatively 
small effect on quantity demanded. Thus a business will be able to sell almost the same 
quantity but at a higher price, earning higher revenues. In other words, whenever demand is 
price inelastic, increasing the price will increase revenues. Conversely, with inelastic demand, 
decreasing price will decrease revenues.
But if demand is price elastic, then increasing price will lead to a relatively large decrease 
in the quantity demanded. A business will receive more revenue per unit sold, but the quantity 
sold will decrease substantially, earning lower overall revenues. So whenever demand is price 
elastic, increasing prices will lower revenues. Decreasing prices will increase revenues if 
demand is price elastic.
If the elasticity value for a good or service is 1, then the percentage changes in price and 
quantity demanded are the same magnitude (but in opposite directions). For example, doubling 
price would reduce the quantity demanded by half. Selling twice as many of something at 
half the price will result in the same exact revenue. So if the elasticity value for a good or 
service is 1, changing the price will have no effect on revenues.
The effects of price changes on revenues for different elasticities are summarized in Table 
5.2. As mentioned previously, a demand curve may be elastic for one range of prices but 
inelastic over a different range. Thus revenue changes may vary considerably as one moves 
along a demand curve.

1.7 PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND IN THE REAL WORLD
Economists have estimated the elasticity of demand for many goods and services. In order to 
estimate an elasticity, one needs information on the quantity demanded at different prices. In 
some cases, variations in prices commonly occur over time. Gasoline is a good example of a 
product whose price ﬂuctuates. In other cases, price variations may occur across geographic 
regions. For example, different electric utilities charge different electricity rates.
However, estimating elasticity is not as simple as tracking how the quantity sold responds 
to price variations. Remember that elasticity measures movement along a demand curve as 
price changes, ceteris paribus. Thus an accurate measurement of elasticity requires that none 
of the nonprice determinants of demand have caused the demand curve to shift and that the 
supply curve has not shifted either. Although economists cannot prevent these changes from 
occurring, they can use statistical techniques to attempt to isolate the effects of price changes 
on the quantity demanded.

122 
CHAPTER 5 — ELASTICITY
We normally cannot speak of “the” elasticity of demand for a particular good. Different 
economists may obtain different elasticity values for the same product because of variations 
in the statistical techniques that they use or the region studied. For example, the elasticity of 
demand for cigarettes has been found to vary between developed and developing countries. 
As we discuss further later in the chapter, elasticity can change depending on the time 
allowed for consumers to adjust their behavior. See Box 5.3 for more on how the elasticity 
for a product can vary.
For these reasons, many economic analyses present a range of elasticity values for a particular 
good. Thus the effect of a price change on revenues will commonly be difﬁcult to predict 
accurately, but we hope that the actual result will fall within our forecasted range. This is another 
illustration of the tradeoff between precision and accuracy, as discussed in Chapter 4.
Table 5.3 presents the range of elasticity values found for some products. In air travel, 
for example, we see that demand is inelastic for ﬁrst-class travelers, who might either be on 
business trips or wealthy enough to disregard some price changes, but that demand is elastic 
for pleasure travelers, who might decide to take a road trip instead for vacation if air fares 
rise signiﬁcantly. Note also that elasticity tends to be higher in developing countries, where 
lower incomes tend to make people more sensitive to price changes.

BOX 5.3 THE SHIFTING DEMAND ELASTICITY FOR GASOLINE
Gasoline is perhaps the good whose demand elastic-
ity has been most studied by economists. Numerous 
estimates of the demand elasticity for gasoline have 
been published going back to the 1960s. Because so 
much data are available, economists have been able 
to explore whether the demand elasticity for gasoline 
has changed over time.
A 2008 paper compared gasoline demand in the 
United States in the late 1970s with data from 2001–6. 
The results indicated that the elasticity value had de-
creased signiﬁcantly over time, from about 0.30 in 
the 1970s to only 0.05 in the 2000s.
What may be responsible for such a large decrease 
in the demand elasticity for gasoline? The authors 
propose several explanations, including:
UÊ iÀV>Ê`ÀÛiÀÃÊ>ÛiÊLiViÊÀiÊ`i«i`iÌÊ
on their vehicles over time. In particular, an in-
crease in suburban development has increased 
the travel distances between where people live 
and where they work and shop. Thus alterna-
tives such as walking and biking are less viable 
now than in the past.
UÊ ÃÊViÃÊ>ÛiÊVÀi>Ãi`ÊÛiÀÊÌi]Ê}>ÃiÊ
purchases comprise a smaller share of overall 
expenses. Thus consumers may be less respon-
sive to increases in gas prices.

time. Consumers with relatively fuel efﬁcient 
vehicles may be less responsive to gas price 
increases.
The authors conclude that attempts to reduce gas 
consumption signiﬁcantly by increasing gas taxes are 
likely to be ineffective. Instead, they suggest that higher 
fuel-economy standards for new vehicles are likely to be 
both more effective and more politically acceptable.

THE PRICE ELASTICITY OF SUPPLY 
123
Going back to our MBTA example, what did it estimate for the elasticity of demand for 
public transportation? The MBTA obtained elasticity estimates based on analysis of the impacts 
of previous fare increases. It estimated separate elasticity values for different types of public 
transportation, such as buses, subways, and commuter trains. Moreover, it differentiated 
between riders who purchase monthly passes and those who pay for each ride.
As one example, the MBTA estimated that the elasticity of demand for commuter rail 
passengers with monthly passes was about 0.1 but for “single-fare” riders of the commuter 
trains it was 0.35. In either case, demand is inelastic, meaning that MBTA revenues would 
increase with a fare increase. But why would demand be relatively more inelastic for those 
with monthly passes? A likely explanation is that those with monthly passes use the commuter 
trains for daily transportation to their workplace. Although car travel is a potential alternative, 
the cost of parking and the hassle of trafﬁc jams may make the commuter rail a better choice, 
even with a modest fare increase. Alternatively, single-fare riders may only take the commuter 
train occasionally, for work or pleasure, and might have viable transportation alternatives or 
decide just to stay home.
The MBTA also estimated that demand would be less elastic for students than nonstudents. 
Again, this seems a reasonable result, given that students are less likely to have their own 
vehicles as a transportation alternative. The MBTA decided on an average fare increase of 
23 percent in July 2012. According to its analysis, it expected that overall ridership would 
decline by about 5.5 percent. Because public transportation demand is inelastic, revenues 
were expected to increase.
How accurate was the MBTA’s prediction? It turned out that in the immediate months 
after the fare increase, overall ridership actually increased slightly! Does this result refute the 
basic inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded? Not necessarily. Remember, 
elasticity only estimates movement along a demand curve. The increase in ridership after the 
fare increase may have been the result of an increase in demand (i.e., a shift in the demand 
curve), which more than offset a decrease in the quantity demanded as a result of the fare 
increase. The increase in demand may have been due to improving economic conditions, an 
increase in gas prices, the weather, or some other factor. It may also suggest that the actual 
elasticity of demand is almost perfectly inelastic. This example demonstrates that economic 
forecasting is not an exact science and that human behavior is difﬁcult to predict. (See Box 
5.1 for another example of the problem with economic predictions.)
Discussion Questions
1. Consider the goods and services for which estimated elasticity values are given in Table 
5.3. Can you think of some reasons why demand for cigarettes, eggs, and rice is inelastic? 
Can you think of an explanation for the two different elasticity values for soft drinks?
2. Suppose that when Winged Demons Athletic Shoes offers a 15 percent discount on its latest 
model of shoe, it ﬁnds that it sells 20 percent more of them. Calculate the price elasticity 
of demand for these shoes. Describe whether demand is price elastic or price inelastic, 
and describe what happens to the company’s revenues after it offers the discount.
2. THE PRICE ELASTICITY OF SUPPLY
Just as movements along a demand curve can be described by elasticity, so can movements 
along a supply curve, which reﬂect the price elasticity of supply. The price elasticity of 
supply measures the responsiveness of quantity supplied to changes in price.
Suppose, for example, that a manufacturing company is having trouble getting adequate 
supplies of a needed component that is an input to its production process. Only a limited number 
of companies have the equipment to make this particular component, and those companies 
are not willing to produce more of it at the going price. The company’s buyer might consider 
offering the suppliers a higher price. By how much will the buyer need to sweeten his ﬁrm’s

CHAPTER 5 — ELASTICITY
offer to induce suppliers to supply the quantity of components that the company needs? What 
the company’s buyer needs to know is the responsiveness of quantity supplied to price.
If the suppliers will signiﬁcantly increase the quantity that they sell with a modest 
increase in price, then we would say the supply curve is price elastic. Meanwhile, if it takes 
a considerably higher price to induce suppliers to increase quantity, then we would say the 
supply curve is price inelastic.
The company’s dilemma is illustrated in Figure 5.6. It is initially able to purchase a quantity 
of Q0 of the components at a price of P0. Then suppose that it wishes to increase the quantity 
it purchases to Q1. If supply is relatively elastic (represented by the supply curve Se), it can 
induce suppliers to increase supply to Q1 with a price of only Pe. However, if supply is relatively 
inelastic (such as supply curve Si), it will need to pay a higher price, say Pi. Obviously, the 
company needing the components will hope that the supply curve is relatively elastic, such 
as Se, which means that it will have to pay less to obtain Q1. Note that the known starting 
point, at a price of P0 and a quantity supplied of Q0, lies on both supply curves. The elasticity 
of supply determines how the curves diverge from the known starting point.

Supply curve Se is more elastic than 
supply curve Si. Thus with supply 
curve Se a company can entice 
their supply to increase the quantity 
supplied to Q1 with a smaller price 
increase. 
As in the equation for the price elasticity of demand, the price elasticity of supply is 
calculated as:
Elasticity = % change in quantity supplied / % change in price
Given that supply curves normally slope upward, price and quantity supplied change in 
the same direction and thus taking the absolute value is not required. If the price elasticity of 
supply is greater than 1, we would say the supply curve is price elastic. If the price elasticity 
of supply is less than 1, we would say the supply curve is price inelastic. A price elasticity 
of supply equal to 1 is “unit elastic.”
A perfectly inelastic supply curve is vertical and indicates that supply is completely ﬁxed. 
The supply of authentic 1940 Chevrolets, for example, can no longer be increased, no matter 
what the price. A perfectly elastic supply curve is horizontal, indicating that buyers can buy 
all they want at the going price. As individual consumers, for example, each of us makes up 
such a small part of the total market for things like supermarket groceries and mass-produced 
clothing that such a horizontal curve is a reasonable representation of what we face. We 
generally pay the same price, no matter how many units we buy of a good.
Hundreds of economic studies have estimated the elasticity of demand, but relatively few 
estimate the elasticity of supply. Several studies have estimated the elasticity of supply for 
housing, primarily in the United States. The results indicate that the supply of housing is 
normally, but not always, price elastic. Estimates of the elasticity of supply for housing range 
from below 1.0 (inelastic) to as much as 30 or higher.1 The elasticity of supply for labor, 
however, is generally found to be price inelastic. The U.S. Congressional Budget Ofﬁce uses 
a value of 0.40 for the elasticity of supply for labor in its analyses.2

 
INCOME ELASTICITY OF DEMAND

Discussion Questions
1. Suppose that a government alternative-energy program is having difﬁculty hiring enough 
engineers to work on a project, and so it raises the wage that it offers to pay by 15 percent. 
Who are the buyers in this case? Who are the sellers? What does the wage represent, in 
terms of a supply-and-demand framework? If the program ﬁnds that employment appli-
cations then increase by 30 percent, what can you conclude about the price elasticity of 
supply of engineering labor?
2. Economists draw supply curves as upward sloping. But sometimes, as consumers, we notice 
that the price per unit goes down if we buy more of something, not up. For example, a liter 
bottle of Pepsi costs less per ounce than a can of Pepsi, warehouse stores sell breakfast 
cereal in “jumbo size” for a low per-unit price, and clothing stores offer “buy one, get 
one free.” Why might sellers offer such prices?
3. INCOME ELASTICITY OF DEMAND
The ﬁnal kind of elasticity that we consider in this chapter is the income elasticity of demand. 
This measures how much the quantity demanded changes when income changes, but holding 
price constant. Recall from Chapter 4 that income is a nonprice determinant of demand that 
shifts the entire demand curve.
Figure 5.7 illustrates the concept of income elasticity. Suppose that D0 represents an initial 
demand curve. At a price of P0, the quantity demanded is Q0. Now suppose that consumer 
incomes increase. At higher incomes, demand will normally increase (i.e., shift to the right). 
Income elasticity indicates how much demand shifts. If demand for the good is relatively 
income inelastic, then demand might only shift slightly, say to Di. At Di and with price constant 
at P0, the quantity demanded increases to Qi. The demand curve De represents a relatively 
elastic response, with the quantity demanded increasing to Qe.

An increase in income shifts the 
demand curve outward (to the right). 
The greater the income elasticity of 
demand, the greater the shift.
As in the equations for price elasticity, income elasticity is calculated as:
income elasticity of demand = % change in quantity demanded / % change in income
For most goods, when income increases, demand also increases. Thus income elasticity is 
positive. Goods for which demand rises when a household’s income rises are called normal 
goods. As people can afford more, they tend to buy more.
However, demand for some goods may fall when incomes rise; these goods are called inferior 
goods. Individuals and families tend to buy less of goods like ramen noodles or second-hand 
clothes as incomes rise. For an inferior good, the income elasticity of demand is negative.
When income elasticity is positive but less than 1, demand is called income inelastic. 
Spending rises with income, but less than proportionately. For example, when income 
normal goods: 
goods for which 
demand increases 
when incomes rise 
and decreases when 
incomes fall
inferior goods: 
goods for which 
demand decreases 
when incomes rise 
and increases when 
incomes fall

126 
CHAPTER 5 — ELASTICITY
rises by 10 percent, spending on a particular good may rise by only 5 percent. When the 
income elasticity is positive and greater than 1, a good is called income elastic. In this case, 
expenditures on that good will take up a greater share of total spending by the buyer. For 
example, income may rise by 10 percent, but spending on the good rises by 20 percent. (If 
some goods are income elastic, then other goods must be income inelastic—or a buyer would 
end up exceeding his or her budget!)
Income-elastic goods are referred to as “luxuries,” because the rich spend proportionately 
more on them than do the poor. By the same token, goods for which demand is inelastic 
are sometimes called “necessities.” These labels, however, are only economists’ shorthand 
for specifying ranges of income elasticity and have nothing to do with human well-being. 
For example, studies of consumer demand usually ﬁnd cigarettes to be, by this deﬁnition, 
“necessities” because poorer people (who are more likely to smoke) spend a greater proportion 
of their income on them.
Households are not the only economic actors that have to work within a budget. Divisions 
of businesses, branches of government, and other organizations also ﬁnd that the budgets for 
their operations may vary. Thus we can also speak of income elasticity for these economic 
actors. Businesses that make high proﬁts often spend more on holiday parties and other perks. 
Ofﬁces with tight budgets may spend more on low-grade copier paper, an inferior good. As 
discussed in Chapter 4, income changes—or, more generally, changes in any overall ability 
to pay—shift the demand curve, changing the quantity demanded at any price.
Discussion Questions
1. Suppose that your income increases. Which goods and services would you buy more 
of (i.e., normal goods)? Which goods and services would you buy less of (i.e., inferior 
goods)?
2. Which goods might be normal goods at some income levels but inferior goods at other 
income levels? (Hint: You might think of a household that is desperately poor, then be-
comes moderately poor, and eventually becomes middle income.)
4. INCOME AND SUBSTITUTION EFFECTS OF A PRICE CHANGE
Returning to the impact of price changes on the quantity demanded, we can think further 
about the motivations of consumers. It makes intuitive sense that consumers will buy more 
of a good when prices fall and less of it when prices rise. But we can deﬁne two underlying 
reasons for these responses.
First, a change in the price of a particular good or service changes how consumers 
evaluate that good or service relative to other goods and services. Speciﬁcally, if the price 
of something falls, it becomes relatively more attractive to consumers. If the price rises, it 
becomes relatively less attractive. For example, suppose that the price of apples and oranges 
start out at $1.00 and $1.50 per pound, respectively. Now suppose the price of oranges rises 
to $2.00 per pound while the price of the apples remains at $1.00. The oranges are now twice 
as expensive as apples, instead of 1.5 times as expensive. Oranges have become relatively 
more expensive, and apples relatively cheaper.
Economists refer to changes in consumer behavior as a result of changes in relative 
prices the substitution effect of a price change. When one good becomes more expensive 
relative to others, people will reduce the quantity demanded of that good and turn toward 
the relatively cheaper substitutes. If you think that apples and oranges are good substitutes 
for each other, then the rise in the relative price of oranges will tend to make you buy 
fewer oranges and more apples. If the price of natural gas water heating rises relative 
to the price of solar water heating, one can expect any household or organization that 
uses hot water to lean more toward solar than before, when the time comes to replace 
its system.
substitution effect 
of a price change: 
the tendency of a 
price increase for a 
particular good to 
reduce the quantity 
demanded of that 
good, as buyers turn 
to relatively cheaper 
substitutes

 
INCOME AND SUBSTITUTION EFFECTS OF A PRICE CHANGE 
127
Note that a substitution effect occurs only when relative prices change. For example, if 
the price of apples rose to $2.00 per pound at the same time that the price of oranges rose 
to $3.00 per pound, then their relative prices would remain unchanged (oranges are still 1.5 
times more expensive than apples). In this case, there is no substitution effect.
In addition to a substitution effect, economists also speak of the income effect of a price 
change. The income effect arises because an increase in the price of any good that a buyer 
purchases reduces her or his overall purchasing power (given a set income or budget). For 
example, suppose that you could buy 12 apples and 5 oranges at their initial prices, but then 
the price of oranges rise. Given your limited income, you can no longer afford 12 apples and 
5 oranges. In other words, the effect of the rise in the price of oranges is essentially the same 
as a decrease in your income. Any price rise for a good that you usually purchase makes you, 
in a sense, poorer. Similar to a decrease in income, the income effect indicates that people 
will respond to a price increase by reducing the quantity of normal goods that they buy (and 
increase the quantity demanded of any inferior goods). 
Because you are now poorer, your response to the price increase will depend, in part, on 
which goods are normal and which (if any) are inferior, as deﬁned earlier in the chapter. If 
both apples and oranges are normal goods, you, now being poorer, will tend to buy less of 
each. If, however, apples are inferior goods to you, which you buy only because you cannot 
afford more oranges, you will tend to buy even more apples (but fewer oranges) when you are 
made poorer by a rise in orange prices. (What if, instead, oranges were the inferior good?)
When the price of a good or service changes, the income and substitution effects act 
together:
s  )F THE GOOD IS A NORMAL GOOD AND ITS PRICE RISES BOTH THE INCOME EFFECT AND THE SUBSTITU-
tion effect will tend to reduce the quantity demanded of the good. The quantity demanded 
falls with a price rise, both because the buyer is poorer and because other goods now look 
relatively more attractive.
s  )F THE GOOD IS INFERIOR AND ITS PRICE RISES THE INCOME EFFECT WILL ENCOURAGE GREATER EXPEN-
ditures, at the same time that the substitution effect pushes toward lower expenditures. In 
general, though, we expect that the substitution effect will be stronger than the income 
effect in the case of inferior goods, so the demand curve will still be downward-sloping.
The exception, where a price rise for an inferior good leads to such a large income effect that 
quantity demanded increases, is called the case of a “Giffen good.” It is rare in practice, especially 
in industrialized countries. In very poor countries, however, it is sometimes the case that the poorest 
of the poor spend a large proportion of their income on a basic foodstuff, such as low-quality 
rice or starchy root vegetables, and tiny amounts of income on more expensive vegetables and 
protein-rich foods. If the price of the basic foodstuff rises, survival may demand that they stop 
purchasing the more expensive foods entirely and make up for these lost calories by buying more 
of the basic foodstuff. In terms of market analysis, the demand curve for the basic foodstuff will 
slope upward (and the price elasticity will be positive, even before taking the absolute value). In 
terms of well-being, of course, the situation represents a human disaster; the starchy food will not 
supply the vitamins or protein needed for healthy functioning and development.

CHAPTER 5 — ELASTICITY
2. Suppose that the prices of all goods and services available to a particular buyer go up by 
20 percent, all at the same time, while the buyer’s income (or budget) remains unchanged. 
What is the effect on the buyer’s purchase of normal goods? Of inferior goods? Is there 
a substitution effect?
5. SHORT-RUN VERSUS LONG-RUN ELASTICITY
So far, our analysis has essentially assumed that adjustment from one equilibrium point to 
another equilibrium point happens without any lapse of time. In the real world, the time 
taken for adjustments is important. For example, we noted how the price elasticity of de-
mand for a good depends on the availability of substitute goods. If substitutes are readily 
available, demand for the good in question will tend to be more price elastic than it would 
be if substitutes were hard to get. But what if substitutes are hard to get right away but 
easier to get over time?
It is possible for a good to be highly price inelastic in the short run but more price elastic 
as people can make adjustments over time. We can distinguish short-run elasticity, which 
measures relatively immediate responses to a price change, from long-run elasticity, 
which measures how much quantity responds after economic actors have had some time to 
adjust.
Gasoline is a good example for which the passage of time is important in determining 
the elasticity of demand, as we saw in Table 5.3. In the short run, when gas prices increase, 
consumers are mostly unable to reduce the amount of gas that they use for commuting and 
shopping. But over time they may be able to purchase a more fuel-efﬁcient vehicle, rely more 
on public transportation, consider carpooling, and even move closer to where they work. We 
see in Table 5.3 that the long-run elasticity of demand for gas is still inelastic at 0.3, but it is 
more elastic than the short-run elasticity of 0.1.*

Welfare Analysis
Adam Smith’s An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, published in 
1776, laid down the theoretical framework for modern capitalist economies. In perhaps the 
most famous passage from the book, Smith asserted that a seller interested only in maximiz-
ing his own gain would be
led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. . . . By 
pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually 
than when he really intends to promote it.
Thus Smith suggests that an economic system based on markets can effectively promote 
the general welfare of society. In the eighteenth century, this was a new, even radical, idea. 
Until Smith’s time, societies tended to be authoritarian and hierarchical. For the average 
person, individual freedoms were few and opportunities for economic advancement were 
virtually nonexistent. Many thinkers worried that if people were free to pursue their own 
self-interest, then the rigid organization of society might break down, leading to a chaotic 
situation in which nothing would get done. But Smith detailed how the self-regulating 
features of markets could not only impose order on society but even potentially create the 
best outcome for society as a whole.
But what do we mean by the “best” outcome? And how can we measure the general welfare 
of a society in a meaningful way? In this chapter, we extend our understanding of markets 
to consider their implications for social welfare. We see that under certain conditions and 
assumptions, markets do, indeed, produce an outcome for society that may be considered 
“best.” But in the real world, these conditions and assumptions rarely apply, and a more 
accurate assessment of markets requires us to consider the beneﬁts of markets in a broader 
social and environmental context.
1. WELFARE ECONOMICS
In Chapter 1, we stated that a central objective of economics is enhancing the well-being of 
society. Welfare economics is a branch of microeconomics that seeks to estimate the social 
welfare of different scenarios in order to determine ways to maximize net social beneﬁts. 
Welfare economics can be studied from both a theoretical perspective and a quantitative ap-
plied perspective.
As a theoretical approach, welfare economics provides insights into situations in which 
markets produce desirable outcomes as well as other situations in which markets either require 
policy interventions or are ineffective at meeting our ﬁnal goals. As a quantitative approach, 
welfare economics seeks to measure social costs and beneﬁts numerically so that different

welfare of different 
scenarios in order to 
determine how to 
maximize net social 
beneﬁts

132 
CHAPTER 6 — WELFARE ANALYSIS
policy scenarios can be compared. Ideally, we can then choose the policy that produces the 
greatest social welfare.
Welfare economics offers an appealing feature—the possibility of measuring the 
quantitative costs and beneﬁts of different policy scenarios. If this can be done reliably, it 
should then be possible to simply choose the option that results in the greatest social welfare, 
where social welfare is deﬁned as total beneﬁts minus total costs, or total net beneﬁts.
Some economists use such terms as “social welfare” and “social well-being” interchangeably. 
However, the two concepts have a subtle, but critical, distinction. As deﬁned above, social 
welfare is something that can potentially be measured quantitatively, although this approach 
has numerous limitations. Well-being, which we regard as the ﬁnal goal of economics, is 
a broader concept that cannot be measured in quantitative terms. Well-being includes such 
objectives as fairness, participation, and social relations (recall Table 1.1 in Chapter 1). A 
particular outcome may maximize social welfare in a quantitative sense but not necessarily 
be the best outcome from the perspective of social well-being.
The goal of maximizing social welfare is sometimes viewed as a positive framework, which 
does not require normative judgments. In particular, it may seem that simply adding up all beneﬁts 
and costs and choosing the option that yields the greatest net beneﬁts avoids the inﬂuence of 
value judgments. But explicit and implicit value judgments are almost always involved in stating 
that a particular policy is “best.” For example, in a highly unequal society, would it be better 
to add $20 billion to the income of those who are already rich or $10 billion to the income of 
those who are currently poor? The former option offers the greatest net beneﬁts in monetary 
terms, but the latter might be considered preferable on social and ethical grounds.
Welfare economics considers the costs and beneﬁts of three basic economic actors:
1. consumers
2. producers
3. the rest of society (including, for this discussion, future generations and the ecological 
context)
Consumers obtain beneﬁts when they can voluntarily purchase a desired product at an 
acceptable price. Producers obtain beneﬁts when they proﬁtably sell products. Often a market 
transaction results in costs or beneﬁts to those not directly involved in the transaction, that 
is, the “rest of society.” For example, the production of paper can generate pollution that is 
harmful to the health of local residents. Such impacts on people not involved in the transaction 
were identiﬁed as externalities in Chapter 1, also sometimes called third-party effects. In this 
chapter, we focus mainly on the costs and beneﬁts to consumers and producers. However, we 
should be aware that any analysis that focuses exclusively on the consumers and producers 
involved in a market is likely to be incomplete. In Chapter 13, we study impacts on the “rest 
of society” in more detail, with a particular focus on environmental impacts.
We next turn to how to estimate market beneﬁts to consumers. Then we consider market 
beneﬁts to producers. Section 4 combines our results to determine the overall social welfare 
arising from market transactions, both in equilibrium and in cases of surplus or shortage. The 
ﬁnal section makes some initial policy inferences based on welfare analysis.
Discussion Questions
1. Do you believe, in principle, that the costs and beneﬁts of various policies can be quantiﬁed 
in monetary terms? Do you believe that some impacts cannot be fundamentally measured 
in dollars? How would you suggest that we evaluate these impacts?
2. Think of a government policy that is currently being debated in the news. Describe how 
you would evaluate the costs and beneﬁts of this policy differently if you were concerned 
primarily about social welfare or social well-being.
social welfare: total 
beneﬁts to society 
minus total costs, or 
total net beneﬁts
third-party effects: 
impacts of an eco-
nomic transaction on 
those not involved in 
the transaction, such 
as the health effects 
of pollution

2. CONSUMER SURPLUS
In order to understand what our market model tells us about beneﬁts to sellers and buyers, 
we need to reconsider supply and demand curves. In this section, we take a closer look at 
demand curves, and in the next section we apply a similar approach to supply curves. The 
analysis requires some detailed thinking, but after you grasp the concepts in this chapter, you 
will have a solid foundation for much of microeconomic analysis.
2.1 QUANTIFYING CONSUMER BENEFITS
We will see in Chapters 8 and 9 that consumer decision-making is a complex process—one that 
appears reasonably rational in some cases but quite irrational in others. For now, we assume 
that consumers make rational choices that effectively move them toward their ﬁnal goals.
Every time you contemplate buying something, you have to make a decision about whether 
you should part with a particular amount of money in exchange for a certain good or service. 
For example, say that you are considering whether you should spend $1.10 for a cup of coffee. 
You must decide whether the cup of coffee is worth $1.10 to you. If you decide to buy the 
coffee, then presumably the loss of $1.10 is more than offset by the amount of welfare that 
you get by consuming the coffee. Economists use various terms to describe the beneﬁts that 
people get from their purchases, including utility, welfare, and well-being. As discussed above, 
we use the term “welfare” here to represent a concept that can be quantitatively measured, 
as opposed to well-being that cannot be reduced to a single number.
The beneﬁts that people gain from their purchases are mainly “psychic” beneﬁts—they are 
somehow happier as a result of their purchases. So how can we take this vague notion of a 
psychic beneﬁt and measure it quantitatively? And in what units should it be measured?
As you might guess, economists tend to prefer to measure this beneﬁt in monetary terms, 
in dollars in the case of the United States. This allows us to compare these beneﬁts directly 
with the cost of a product. So, if a cup of coffee costs $1.10, and you decide to purchase it, 
then those psychic beneﬁts must in some sense exceed $1.10. A rational consumer who buys 
a cup of coffee is willing to part with $1.10 for it, while a rational consumer who does not 
buy the coffee does not believe that it is worth $1.10.
But obviously some consumers realize more personal beneﬁts from the same cup of coffee. 
In other words, the welfare that someone gets from a cup of coffee can vary considerably 
from one consumer to another. Some people’s “happiness” might increase only a little, while 
others may obtain a big increase in their happiness from the coffee. According to welfare 
economics, these differences in consumer preferences are expressed in differences in their 
willingness to pay for something.
The key to measuring consumer beneﬁts using welfare analysis is to identify consumers’ 
maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for something. Welfare economics assumes that 
consumers’ maximum WTP represents the total beneﬁts that they expect to obtain from a 
product, expressed in monetary terms. A rational consumer is someone who buys a product 
as long as the actual price is not greater than her maximum WTP for it. Imagine that the 
price of coffee increases from $1.10 per cup to, say, $1.40. Some people who were willing to 
buy coffee at $1.10 would not be willing to pay $1.40. Theoretically, every consumer has a 
maximum amount that he is willing to pay for a particular product, given the fact that he has 
alternative choices, for example, purchasing another product or just saving his money. 
Suppose that a particular consumer, Luis, is willing to pay a maximum of $1.40 for a 
cup of coffee, and not a penny more. If the price of coffee is $1.40, then Luis would view 
trading $1.40 for the coffee as essentially an equal trade—he gives up $1.40 and obtains an 
equivalent value in welfare from the coffee.
Now suppose that a different consumer, Madeleine, is willing to pay a maximum of $1.75 
for the same cup of coffee. Thus $1.75 represents the welfare that she would get if she buys 
the same cup of coffee. Given that Madeleine has to pay only $1.40 for it, she is willing to 
maximum willing-
ness to pay (WTP): 
the maximum amount 
that a rational con-
sumer will pay for a 
particular product. In 
welfare economics, 
consumers’ maximum 
WTP represents the 
total beneﬁts that 
they expect to obtain 
from a product, ex-
pressed in monetary 
terms.

134 
CHAPTER 6 — WELFARE ANALYSIS
buy the coffee. In fact, she is getting a bargain in a sense because she can buy the coffee for 
$0.35 less than the maximum amount she is willing to pay. Welfare economics deﬁnes the 
difference between a consumer’s maximum WTP and the price one must actually pay as the 
net welfare beneﬁt from the purchase, referred to as consumer surplus. Consumer surplus 
represents the “extra beneﬁts” received from buying something above what is paid for it.
So, in Madeleine’s case, she obtains a consumer surplus of $0.35 from buying a cup of 
coffee, calculated as her maximum WTP of $1.75 minus the price of $1.40:
Consumer surplus = $1.75 (maximum WTP) – $1.40 (price) = $0.35
Suppose that a third consumer, Emma, is willing to pay a maximum of $2.00 for the same 
cup of coffee. Note that this may reﬂect either Emma’s greater appreciation for coffee or her 
higher disposable income, a point to which we return later. Emma’s consumer surplus would 
be $0.60. Finally, suppose that a fourth potential consumer, Tom, is willing to pay a maximum 
of only $1.00 for a cup of coffee. Because the market price is $1.40, Tom would choose not 
to buy the coffee, assuming rational behavior. Of course, anyone who is not willing to pay 
the going price will not receive any consumer surplus.
2.2 CONSUMER SURPLUS AND DEMAND CURVES
Of course consumers are rarely required to think about the exact maximum amount that they 
would be willing to pay for something. In the real world, consumers are normally presented 
with a price, and either they buy the product or they don’t. So, at ﬁrst glance, it seems that 
estimating consumer surplus quantitatively is not a realistic option.
But if we think about a demand curve in more detail, we see that it actually provides us 
with the information that we need to estimate consumer surplus, not only for an individual 
but for the entire market. Let’s go back to our demand curve for coffee. Figure 6.1 repeats 
Figure 4.4. We know that at a price of $1.40 per cup, 600 cups of coffee will be demanded 
per week, as shown at Point A in Figure 6.1.
Next, imagine that we look at a demand curve with a magnifying glass, zooming in on 
a single point like Point A. This is shown in Figure 6.2.* Note that the y-axis now covers 
consumer surplus: 
the net beneﬁts 
obtained from a pur-
chase, equal to the 
difference between a 
consumer’s maximum 
willingness to pay and 
the price

This ﬁgure shows the same demand 
curve for coffee we presented in 
Chapter 4.
*The “magniﬁed” demand curve in Figure 6.2 is not actually the same as the one in Figure 6.1; in Figure 6.2 we use a 
different slope, in order to focus on a price change that causes the quantity demanded to decrease by 1.

 
CONSUMER SURPLUS 
135
only the range between $1.35 and $1.45, and the x-axis covers only the range between 
590 and 610 cups of coffee. Point A shows that once again at a price of $1.40, exactly 
600 cups of coffee are demanded per week. Now suppose that the price of coffee were 
increased slightly, by only a penny, from $1.40 to $1.41 per cup. We see in Figure 6.2 that 
the quantity demanded decreased from 600 to 599 cups per week, as shown by Point B. 
In other words, one person in our market was willing to pay $1.40 for a cup of coffee, but 
not $1.41. That one person is the reason that the quantity demanded decreases by 1 when 
the price rises from $1.40 to $1.41.
Going back to the idea of consumer surplus, Point A represents the maximum 
willingness to pay ($1.40) of that one person. So we can actually determine the consumer 
surplus for this person by comparing this point on the demand curve to the price. If 
the price of coffee were, say, $1.10, then we can conclude that this person’s consumer 
surplus would be $0.30.
If price rises by another penny, from $1.41 to $1.42, then the quantity demanded decreases 
by 1 again, from 599 to 598 cups (Point C). This is because one other person was willing 
to pay $1.41, but not $1.42. Again, we can calculate the consumer surplus for the person 
represented by Point B (the point at which this person is still willing to buy coffee) as the 
difference between his maximum WTP ($1.41) and price. So if the price of coffee were $1.10, 
the person at Point B would receive a consumer surplus of $0.31.
The point of this detailed look at a demand curve is to emphasize that a demand curve 
is not really a smooth line, but a collection of points that represent the decisions of many 
individuals. Every time the quantity demanded decreases by 1, it is because the price has 
increased sufﬁciently for one person to switch from being willing to pay for the product to 
being not willing to pay.
Much economic analysis involves considering marginal changes, which means very small 
changes, either an increase or a decrease; often this is modeled as a change of one unit, as 
when (above) we add one penny to a price, or subtract one customer from a large number. 
We go into this important topic in more detail in relation to production decisions (Chapters 
16 and 17).
In the case that we have been discussing, for each one unit increase in quantity, the 
corresponding point on the demand curve represents the maximum WTP of the individual 
(or other economic actor) now willing to buy the product. Another way to understand this 
is that the points on a demand curve indicate the marginal beneﬁts, measured in monetary

units, of each additional unit of the product to those demanding them. We can say that a 
demand curve is actually a marginal beneﬁts curve, because it tells us the beneﬁts of each 
additional unit to consumers.
Note that there is a difference between the beneﬁt of consuming a product, which is 
deﬁned as the maximum WTP, and the net beneﬁts, which are the beneﬁts minus any costs. 
Consumer surplus is a measure of net beneﬁts because the price of the product is subtracted 
from the maximum WTP.
Going back to our demand curve, we can show consumer surplus for any individual by 
subtracting his maximum WTP (his point along the demand curve) from the price. This is 
shown in Figure 6.3. Here Luis’s maximum WTP is at Point A; he is willing to pay a maximum 
of $1.40 for a cup of coffee. This is the vertical distance between his point on the demand 
curve and the x-axis. If the price of coffee is $1.10, then the difference ($0.30) is his consumer 
surplus. This is the net beneﬁt that he obtains from buying a cup of coffee.

Consumer surplus is the difference 
between price and someone’s 
maximum willingness to pay (i.e., the 
demand curve).
*If you have studied calculus, you can use integration to determine areas under demand (and supply) curves. This is done 
in more advanced economics courses.
2.3 CONSUMER SURPLUS IN AN ENTIRE MARKET
Now we are ready to take the ﬁnal step in our analysis of consumer beneﬁts. We have just 
seen that a demand curve tells us the marginal beneﬁts of each additional unit of a product 
to consumers. But what really interests us is the beneﬁts of a product to the entire market. 
Welfare economics assumes that the aggregate (or market) beneﬁts, or the beneﬁts to all 
consumers, is simply the sum of the beneﬁts to each individual consumer. For example, if the 
entire coffee market consisted of just Luis, Madeleine, and Emma, market beneﬁts would be 
the sum of the beneﬁts of these three consumers.
The same logic applies to consumer surplus. Aggregate consumer surplus, or aggregate 
net beneﬁts, is simply the sum of the consumer surpluses for all individuals who buy a 
product.
Although an individual’s maximum WTP is shown by a single point on the demand curve, 
aggregate beneﬁts can be represented by areas under a demand curve.* So, the area under a 
demand curve represents the total WTP for all consumers, or the aggregate beneﬁts for all 

 
PRODUCER SURPLUS 
137
consumers. The consumer surplus for all consumers in a market is the difference between 
their aggregate beneﬁts and the aggregate costs that they must pay.
We can illustrate these concepts in another graph, as shown in Figure 6.4. This is the 
same demand curve for coffee, but in this case extended all the way back to the y-axis. 
The price of coffee is $1.10 per cup, and at this price the quantity demanded is 700 cups 
per week. The amount that consumers must pay for these 700 cups of coffee is the gray 
rectangle equal to the price multiplied by the quantity sold. This is also the revenue that 
coffee sellers receive.
Aggregate beneﬁts are the area under the demand curve, up to the quantity actually sold 
(700 cups). Of course, no beneﬁts are obtained for cups of coffee that are not sold. The market 
consumer surplus is the difference between aggregate costs and aggregate beneﬁts—the 
blue-shaded triangle in the graph. In other words, market consumer surplus is the area under 
the demand curve but above the price. According to welfare economics, this area represents 
the net beneﬁts consumers receive from a market. Thus we can now use a supply-and-demand 
graph to estimate the quantitative welfare beneﬁts that accrue to consumers—measured as 
the area below the demand curve but above price. This approach allows us to convert the 
aggregate psychic beneﬁts of consumers, a rather vague concept, into something we can 
actually measure. We now turn our attention to the beneﬁts of producers.

Discussion Questions
1. Think about a good or service that you have purchased recently. Try to estimate the maxi-
mum amount that you would have been willing to pay for it. What factors inﬂuenced your 
WTP decision? How do you think your willingness to pay might differ from that of other 
consumers?
2. Do you think that the concept of consumer surplus is an effective tool for converting “psy-
chic” beneﬁts to a monetary value? Do you have any reservations about the concept?
3. PRODUCER SURPLUS
Now that we understand welfare analysis from the perspective of consumers, we can apply 
much of the same logic to producers. In particular, we will take a closer look at supply curves to 
determine how we can use them to understand the beneﬁts producers receive from markets.

presented in Chapter 4.
3.1 QUANTIFYING PRODUCER BENEFITS
Whereas the beneﬁts to consumers were deﬁned somewhat vaguely as “psychic” beneﬁts, the 
beneﬁts that producers receive from markets are much more concrete. So, while consumers 
seek something vague like happiness or well-being, economists assume that producers seek 
proﬁts. This makes our analysis of producer beneﬁts relatively straightforward. Rather than 
needing to convert consumer psychic beneﬁts to monetary units based on their WTP, proﬁts 
are already measured in dollars.
Welfare economics uses the term producer surplus to indicate the beneﬁts that accrue to 
producers from selling products. For the purpose of our analysis, we essentially assume that 
producer surplus and proﬁts are the same thing.* The producer surplus for any unit of a product 
is the difference between its selling price and the cost of producing that particular unit, that is, 
its marginal cost. (We examine the concept of marginal cost more closely in Chapter 16.)
Are sellers really interested only in proﬁts? We consider this issue later in the book. For 
now, we can note that sellers are also people who seek to enhance their well-being. Making 
a healthy proﬁt is, of course, a component of their well-being, but they may have other 
motivations and goals as well. But producer surplus considers only sellers’ ﬁnancial beneﬁts. 
Again, we must realize that welfare, as deﬁned in economics, is different from well-being.
3.2 PRODUCER SURPLUS AND SUPPLY CURVES
In order to estimate producer surplus, we need information on sellers’ production costs. You might 
think that we need to come up with some new curves to illustrate production costs, but that is not 
necessary. In fact, a supply curve is actually a marginal cost curve. In order to understand why, 
we need to reconsider how a supply curve relates to the decisions of individual suppliers.
We start with our supply curve from Chapter 4, shown here as Figure 6.5. We can see, for 
example, that at a price of $1.00 per cup, 600 cups of coffee are supplied. But at that price, 
why are exactly 600 cups of coffee supplied, and not 601 or more?
Welfare economics assumes that sellers will offer a given unit of a product for sale only 
if they can make a proﬁt on that unit. In other words, if the price they can receive by selling 
*Technically speaking, this is not quite true. From a marginal perspective, producer surplus is the difference between 
the price of a product and its marginal cost. Some of this surplus, however, may be used to pay ﬁxed expenses and thus not 
represent proﬁt to the producer.

is higher than their production costs, they will produce that unit and offer it for sale. If the 
price is less than their production costs, they will not produce it.
Just as we did with a demand curve, we can zoom in on a supply curve to understand why 
exactly 600 cups of coffee are offered for sale at a price of $1.00 per cup. We do this with 
Figure 6.6. The graph shows us that in order for more than 600 cups of coffee to be offered 
for sale, the price must rise from $1.00 per cup to $1.01 per cup.* So assuming that sellers 
will offer a product only if they can make a proﬁt on it and will not offer a product if they 
cannot make a proﬁt on it, we can make the following statements:
s  The seller does make a proﬁt on the 600th cup of coffee when price is $1.00, because it is 
offered for sale (Point A).
s  The seller does not make a proﬁt on the 601st cup of coffee when price is $1.00, because 
it is not offered for sale.
s  If the price rises to $1.01, then the 601st cup of coffee then becomes proﬁtable and is of-
fered for sale (Point B).
Now ask yourself: How much does it cost the seller to produce the 601st cup of coffee? 
Realizing that it is not proﬁtable at a price of $1.00, but is proﬁtable at a price of $1.01, we 
can conclude that the production cost must be more than $1.00 but less than $1.01. In other 
words, the marginal cost of producing the 601st cup of coffee is slightly more than $1.00.** 
Looking at Figure 6.6, that is exactly what the supply curve indicates—moving from 600 
cups (Point A) to 601 cups (Point B) of coffee, the corresponding price is between $1.00 and 
$1.01. The supply curve is telling us the marginal cost of producing coffee.
At a price of $1.01, the seller offers 601 cups of coffee, but not 602. Again, it would take 
a further price increase, from $1.01 to $1.02, to induce the seller to offer the 602nd cup of 
coffee (Point C). So we conclude that the marginal cost of supplying the 602nd cup is between 
$1.01 and $1.02. Again, this is exactly what the supply curve indicates.
Now that we know that the supply curve tells us the marginal cost of producing each unit, 
all we need to do to obtain producer surplus is to compare the supply curve to the price. If the

By zooming in on the supply curve 
we can associate marginal price 
changes with marginal changes in 
the quantity supplied.
 *We have again adjusted the slope of the curve in order to focus on a change in quantity of one.
**Note that there may be points where the marginal production cost exactly equals the price. Thus the producer would not 
increase proﬁts by offering the unit for sale but would not lose money either. In this case, we would say that the producer is 
indifferent between selling and not selling the unit.

CHAPTER 6 — WELFARE ANALYSIS
3.3 PRODUCER SURPLUS IN AN ENTIRE MARKET
The ﬁnal step in our analysis of producer beneﬁts is to determine the producer surplus for the 
entire market. As with market consumer surplus, we need to extend our analysis from points 
along the supply curve to areas above the supply curve. Note that we are focused on the area 
above the supply curve because the supply curve represents the marginal costs to producers. 
It is only the revenue above costs that represents producer surplus, or proﬁts.
Figure 6.8 shows the same supply curve shown above but now extended back to the 
y-axis. Given that the supply curve represents the marginal production costs, the aggregate 
production cost for the entire market is the area under the supply curve, up to the quantity 
that is produced. So if the price of coffee is $1.10 and a quantity of 700 cups is offered for 
sale at this price, the aggregate production cost equals the gray-shaded area under the supply 
curve. The difference between price and the supply curve, for each unit produced, is producer 
surplus. Thus market producer surplus is the blue-shaded area below price but above the 
supply curve. This is the net beneﬁt obtained by all producers in the market.
price of coffee is $1.40, then the producer surplus on the 600th cup of coffee is the difference 
between the production cost and the price, as shown in Figure 6.7. So the seller obtains a 
producer surplus, or proﬁt, of $0.30 on the 600th cup of coffee.

Discussion Questions
1. Do you think that the concept of producer surplus accurately represents the beneﬁts that 
producers obtain from selling goods and services? Do you have any reservations about 
the concept?
2. Have you ever operated a business, even a small one, such as a lemonade stand when you 
were younger? If so, what factors motivated you to start a business? Do you think that 
your proﬁts (producer surplus) overstated or understated your beneﬁts? Does your answer 
have any implications for welfare analysis?
4. SOCIAL EFFICIENCY
Recall that in Chapter 1 we deﬁned efﬁciency as the use of resources in a way that does not 
create waste. In welfare economics, efﬁciency is deﬁned more precisely. Speciﬁcally, social 
efﬁciency (in welfare economics) means an allocation of resources that maximizes the net 
beneﬁts to society.
This is normally what modern economists mean when they say that a certain result is “best” 
or “optimal.” But we must emphasize that this deﬁnition of optimality is a normative one, and 
it does not mean the same thing as maximizing well-being. A result may be “socially efﬁcient” 
but fail to address ﬁnal goals such as fairness, justice, or environmental sustainability.
Even with such caveats in mind, our study of social efﬁciency is worthwhile because it 
helps us understand when markets work well and when markets fail to produce efﬁcient 
results. We reach two conclusions in this section:
1. Under certain conditions, a private market in equilibrium results in the socially efﬁcient 
outcome.
2. When these conditions are not met, private markets fail to produce the socially efﬁcient 
outcome. When this occurs, market interventions may be justiﬁed in order to increase 
social efﬁciency.
Current economic debates are often centered around whether private markets produce 
socially efﬁcient outcomes. Conservative economists tend to believe that private markets, 
without regulations, produce efﬁcient outcomes. Liberal economists are more likely to believe 
that market outcomes can be improved with some regulations, either because regulation will 
increase social efﬁciency or to achieve ﬁnal goals other than efﬁciency.
Whether a market outcome enhances overall well-being is a normative question, dependent 
on one’s ﬁnal goals and, especially, on the question of whose welfare is given more weight and 
how the weighting is done. For example, if the weighting is purely according to willingness 
to pay, then more weight is given to the desires, happiness, or well-being of those with more 
money. Whether a market outcome is socially efﬁcient is mostly a positive question, estimated 
by calculating the size of the consumer and producer surpluses. Even then, however, normative 
value judgments may be involved.
Later chapters explore in more detail under what conditions markets fail to produce socially 
efﬁcient outcomes. For example, Chapter 10 focuses on market outcomes and inefﬁciencies in 
the labor market. Chapter 13 considers the effects of pollution and other negative externalities. 
Chapter 18 looks at how concentration of power in a small number of producers can be 
inefﬁcient.
However, before we can analyze situations in which markets fail to produce efﬁcient 
outcomes, we must ﬁrst understand how markets can lead to social efﬁciency. To do this, we 
can combine our knowledge of consumer and producer surplus to determine the net beneﬁts 
of a market to those involved in it. At this point, we are considering market beneﬁts only to the 
market participants. As mentioned earlier, the impacts of markets on the “rest of society” are 
also relevant to social welfare. So the analysis below is an incomplete, preliminary analysis. 
We extend our model to consider impacts on the rest of society in Chapter 13.

ics): an allocation of 
resources that maxi-
mizes the net beneﬁts 
to society

CHAPTER 6 — WELFARE ANALYSIS
4.1 MARKET EQUILIBRIUM AND SOCIAL EFFICIENCY
Figure 6.9 shows the consumer and producer surplus of a market in equilibrium. This is the same 
equilibrium outcome that we obtained in Chapter 4, with a coffee price of $1.10 per cup and 700 
cups sold per week. Consumer surplus is the area below the demand curve but above the price. 
Producer surplus is the area below the price but above the supply curve. The net beneﬁts to the 
market participants (buyers and sellers) are simply the sum of consumer and producer surplus.
In this example, consumer surplus is larger than producer surplus. This is a result of the 
relative elasticity of the two curves. You can easily imagine situations in which the majority 
of the market beneﬁts accrue to producers rather than consumers. An important point is that 
social welfare considers only the aggregate beneﬁts in the market, not the distribution of 
beneﬁts. So whether the majority of beneﬁts accrue to buyers or sellers, social efﬁciency 
seeks only to maximize total beneﬁts. Of course, this ignores the ﬁnal goal of fairness. Again, 
social efﬁciency is not a ﬁnal goal and is not the same thing as well-being.
Another way to visualize the net beneﬁts in a market is to recall that a demand curve can 
be considered a marginal beneﬁts curve, and a supply curve can be considered a marginal cost 
curve. The difference between these two curves at any point represents the gap between the 
maximum willingness to pay of consumers and the production costs of suppliers. Although 
some of this difference is “captured” by producers as proﬁts, the rest is consumer surplus. 
As long as the demand curve is higher than the supply curve, society receives net beneﬁts 
by producing that unit of a product. However, if the supply curve is higher than the demand 
curve, then marginal costs exceed marginal beneﬁts, and society would actually be worse off 
if that unit were produced. So, as long as the demand curve is higher than the supply curve, it 
makes sense (from the perspective of social welfare) for society to produce each unit, to the 
point where marginal beneﬁts equal marginal costs. Note in Figure 6.9 that this is true up to 
the equilibrium quantity of 700 cups of coffee. However, when the supply curve is higher than 
the demand curve, marginal costs exceed marginal beneﬁts and society should not produce 
these units. Any production above 700 cups of coffee would decrease social welfare. Thus 
the market equilibrium is the outcome that maximizes social welfare.
We now test this result by considering what happens when the market is not allowed to reach 
equilibrium—when a regulation is enacted that sets a price different from the equilibrium price.
4.2 PRICE CEILINGS
Sometimes, governments intervene in markets to set price limits, either above or below the 
market equilibrium price. Somewhat confusingly, a price set below the market price is called

a price ceiling, or price control (it is a “ceiling” because it establishes a maximum allowable 
price).
Price ceilings are usually set with a goal of helping certain groups of consumers by keeping 
prices low. A classic example is rent control, which speciﬁes maximum prices for rental units. 
A welfare analysis of a rent control is shown in Figure 6.10.
In the absence of rent control, the market equilibrium rent would be $800 per month and 
the quantity of rental units would be 10,000 apartments. Consumer surplus to renters would 
be areas (A + B + C) and producer surplus to landlords would be areas (D + E + F). Total 
social welfare would be the sum of these two areas. This graph also portrays a situation 
in which rent control limits the amount of rent that a landlord can charge, to no more than 
$650 per month. At this price, we have a shortage—the quantity demanded (12,000) exceeds 
the quantity supplied (7,000). Without regulation, market forces would push prices up and 
eliminate the shortage, but this cannot happen with rent control.
In the case of a price ceiling, the quantity is determined only by the supply curve (because 
producers will react to the price set by the government in deciding how much to supply). So, 
the market quantity at a rent control price of $650/month is 7,000 rental units. Note that this 
leaves many potential renters unable to ﬁnd a rental unit at a price of $650/month (5,000 in 
this example).
The intention of rent control is normally to help renters. Their consumer surplus would still 
be the area above the price and below the demand curve up to the quantity sold. At a quantity 
supplied of 7,000, this is equal to areas (A + B + D). Because consumer surplus was areas 
(A + B + C) before rent control, renters have lost area C and gained area D. The question of 
whether consumer surplus has increased thus depends on the relative sizes of areas C and D. 
The way the graph is drawn, it appears that consumer surplus has indeed increased, since D 
is larger than C. But this may not always be the case. You can try to draw a different graph 
such that consumer surplus would decrease as a result of a price ceiling.
We can be more deﬁnitive with the change in producer surplus. Producer surplus with 
rent control is only area F, which is clearly smaller than areas (D + E + F). Producers have 
lost (D + E). Of this amount, D has been gained by consumers, so we can say that it has been 
transferred from producers to consumers.
Note than in addition to this transfer from producers to consumers, two areas, C and E, have 
been lost completely. This loss, which beneﬁts no one, decreases total social welfare. Before

CHAPTER 6 — WELFARE ANALYSIS
rent control, total social welfare was (A + B + C + D + E + F). With rent control, it is areas (A 
+ B + D + F). Economists call the net loss of (C + E) a deadweight loss, a reduction in social 
welfare as a result of a market regulation. This seems to indicate that from the point of view 
of total social welfare, rent control is a bad policy, implying a loss of economic efﬁciency. 
In more commonsense terms, the reason for the deadweight loss is that at the enforced lower 
price, less housing is available overall.
But this conclusion can be controversial. Sometimes, for example, in wartime or during 
other emergencies, many people favor price controls on essential goods. Many apartments in 
New York City and other cities in New York State are subject to rent control, and, of course, it 
is very popular with tenants who beneﬁt from it, so it has proved politically resilient. Can this 
be justiﬁed economically? Many economists would say no, for the reasons discussed above. 
But note that the conclusions above are affected by the elasticity of the supply and demand 
curves. In particular, if supply is inelastic, the deadweight loss will be small (visualize this, or 
draw another set of inelastic supply and demand curves to see how areas C and E shrink).
The deadweight loss may be small in the case of apartments in New York City, where 
there is little room for new construction (i.e., an inelastic supply curve). In addition, not all 
apartments are covered by rent control, so, where possible, new, uncontrolled apartment 
buildings can be developed. To those who sympathize with the original goal of rent control—to 
help renters and keep at least some apartments affordable—the beneﬁts to renters justify the 
relatively small efﬁciency loss.
But in other cases, especially where elasticity of supply is high, price controls can be 
disastrous. One example was in Zimbabwe, where extensive price controls were imposed in 
2007 with the goal of keeping prices for food and other essential goods low. As our example 
leads us to expect, the result of enforced low prices was to destroy the incentive for farmers 
and other suppliers to produce, leading to severe shortages. So, the poor people whom the 
policy was supposed to help were instead hurt by unavailability of food and other basic goods, 
while farmers and other merchants were forced into bankruptcy. The price controls had to be 
abandoned after they forced the economy into virtual collapse.
4.3 PRICE FLOORS
Governments also sometimes intervene in markets with the opposite goal—to keep prices from 
falling. A price set above the market price is called a price ﬂoor or price support (because it 
establishes a minimum allowable price).
Why would governments want to keep prices at higher levels? The obvious reason is to aid 
producers. In the agricultural sector, price supports are common. Governments commonly specify 
minimum prices for agricultural products such as grain or milk. Of course, this also pushes up prices 
to consumers. The goal is to help farmers, who often have considerable political inﬂuence.
The economic effect is the opposite of a price ceiling. Rather than creating a shortage, price 
ﬂoors create a surplus, as producers increase their output to take advantage of proﬁtable higher 
prices, but the same higher prices cause consumers to cut back their purchases. In general, 
the government will have to buy up the surplus in order to maintain the price ﬂoor. From an 
economic point of view, this is clearly inefﬁcient, because it encourages excess production 
and involves both higher prices to consumers and large government expenditures. A more 
efﬁcient approach would be to give direct aid to farmers if this is considered necessary but 
to leave market prices alone.
Another classic example of a price ﬂoor is the minimum wage. Most governments have 
minimum wage laws specifying that hourly wages must be at least a given level. The United 
States has a federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour (as of 2013), although about 20 states 
have set higher minimum wage rates. Most other developed countries have higher minimum 
wage rates. For example, the minimum wage is equivalent to about $10/hour in Canada, 
about $13/hour in France, and $16/hour in Australia.

The impact of a minimum wage is illustrated in Figure 6.11, which illustrates a hypothetical 
labor market for unskilled workers such as cashiers or manual laborers. In this case, the 
demand curve represents the willingness to pay of employers for workers. The “sellers” are 
potential workers willing to supply their labor in exchange for pay. (We discuss labor markets 
in more detail in Chapter 10.)
If the labor market were allowed to reach equilibrium, the market-clearing wage rate would 
be $6.00 per hour and employment would be 2 million workers. But the minimum wage of 
$7.25/hour prevents market forces from pushing the wage rate any lower than $7.25/hour. 
The minimum wage is called a price ﬂoor because it prevents the wage rate from moving 
lower. Note that if the minimum wage were set below the equilibrium wage, say at $5.00/
hour, it would have no effect on the market price.
At $7.25/hour, the graph tells us that the supply of labor is 2.4 million workers and the 
demand for labor is 1.7 million workers. Although an equilibrium quantity is determined 
by the interaction of supply and demand, in the case of a price ﬂoor, the market quantity is 
determined only by the demand curve. In other words, the situation of surplus (excess supply) 
cannot be eliminated with a price decline, so demand limits the amount that is sold. Thus the 
presence of the minimum wage, relative to the equilibrium outcome, reduces employment 
from 2 million to 1.7 million. (Again, these are only hypothetical numbers.)
What does this price ﬂoor mean in terms of social welfare? Presumably, a minimum 
wage law is intended to beneﬁt workers, rather than employers. In a labor market, producer 
surplus represents the social welfare beneﬁts to workers—they are the suppliers. Remember 
that producer surplus is the area above the supply curve and below the price, up to the 
quantity sold. We see in Figure 6.11 that if the market were allowed to reach equilibrium 
(a wage rate of $6.00/hour), consumer surplus would be areas (A + B + C) and producer 
surplus would be areas (D + E). Total social welfare would be the sum of both surpluses, 
or (A + B + C + D + E).
But with the minimum wage set at $7.25 producer surplus becomes areas (B + D). Without 
the minimum wage, producer surplus was (D + E). The way the graph is drawn, it appears 
that producer surplus has increased (i.e., area B, which has been gained, is larger than area 
E, which has been lost). However, this is not necessarily always the case. To test this, try to 
draw a market in which a price ﬂoor decreases producer surplus. (Hint: Make the price ﬂoor 
even further above the equilibrium price.)

CHAPTER 6 — WELFARE ANALYSIS
We also need to see what has happened to consumer surplus (keeping in mind that in this 
story the “consumers” are employers). Recall that consumer surplus is the area above price but 
below the demand curve, up to the quantity sold. So, with the minimum wage in place, consumer 
surplus is only area A, instead of (A + B + C). We can deﬁnitively conclude that consumer 
surplus has decreased, by the area (B + C). This is always the case with a price ﬂoor.
Returning to Figure 6.11, we see that total social welfare with the minimum wage is 
the sum of areas (A + B + D); it has decreased by areas (C + E). Area C used to be part 
of consumer surplus, and area E used to be part of producer surplus. Also note that area B 
represents a transfer of beneﬁts, from consumers (employers) to producers (workers). As in 
the rent control example above, there is a deadweight loss of areas (C + E), representing a 
loss of economic efﬁciency.
So on the basis of economic efﬁciency, a price ﬂoor such as a minimum wage law seems to be a 
bad idea. In theory, at least, it reduces both social welfare and employment. Although workers who 
have jobs earn higher wages, the theory predicts that more workers will be unable to ﬁnd jobs.
But as we discussed earlier, economic efﬁciency is just one of many societal goals. Figure 
6.11 shows that the minimum wage law did beneﬁt workers (i.e., producer surplus has 
increased). If we believe that employers are exploiting low-wage workers, then perhaps the 
loss in economic efﬁciency could be justiﬁed on the basis of social justice. For example, we 
might conclude that beneﬁts to the workers whose salary rises to at least a “living wage” are 
so signiﬁcant that they outweigh the other losses, in proﬁts and in number of jobs.
Another important question in weighing the merits of minimum wage laws is how much 
they actually do reduce employment. It is an empirical question whether raising the minimum 
wage increases unemployment by a signiﬁcant amount. If demand for labor is relatively 
inelastic, the effect on unemployment will be relatively small. Indeed, empirical research has 
found that in some cases there is no detectable effect of increased unemployment as a result 
of a higher minimum wage! (See Box 6.1 for details on this surprising result.)
Given these ﬁndings, you might wonder why the empirical reality does not necessarily 
support the predictions of the theory. This example reminds us that it is important to both 
learn the theory and, at the same time, to be cautious in its application. The minimum wage 
example raises important issues of social justice; it also emphasizes the fact that wages are in 
many ways not standard prices. Markets for labor, as discussed further in Chapter 10, make it 
clear that economics is a social science—about people—and the behaviors of people cannot 
be predicted with mathematical precision. 
Discussion Questions
1. Think of another real-world example of a price ﬂoor or a price ceiling, not discussed in 
the text. Based on what you read in this section, as well as your own views, do you think 
that price regulation is a “good” policy?
2. Do you think that social efﬁciency is an appropriate tool for analyzing the net impact of 
different policies? Can you think of some policy situations in which social efﬁciency is 
a sufﬁcient measure for determining which policies should be enacted? Can you think of 
other policy situations in which social efﬁciency would be an inappropriate goal of policy 
decisions?
5. POLICY INFERENCES FROM WELFARE ANALYSIS
A simple conclusion from basic welfare analysis is that private unregulated markets, bringing 
together self-interested consumers and producers, can produce an outcome that is the “best” 
overall for society, where best is deﬁned as maximizing economic efﬁciency (i.e., social 
welfare). But as we have already seen, this simple conclusion often needs to be qualiﬁed or 
questioned in terms of real-world effects. Bearing this in mind, we now look at some of the 
policy implications of welfare analysis.

 
POLICY INFERENCES FROM WELFARE ANALYSIS 
147
5.1 LAISSEZ-FAIRE ECONOMICS
The type of analysis presented in this chapter is the reason that some economists are sup-
portive of a laissez-faire (pronounced lays-say fair) approach to regulation. We saw above 
that government intervention in markets, such as price ﬂoors and price ceilings, generally 
decreases social welfare, deﬁned strictly in terms of economic efﬁciency. In this analy-
sis, total beneﬁts are maximized only when the market is allowed to reach equilibrium. 
Laissez-faire advocates thus believe that government intervention in markets should be 
limited only to what is absolutely necessary to ensure that markets function smoothly. 
For example, proponents of laissez-faire recognize that regulations are needed to protect 
private property rights.
But deﬁning the “best” outcome for society as maximizing economic efﬁciency obviously 
implies that economic efﬁciency is a paramount goal. As we saw in Chapter 1, numerous 
other social goals, such as fairness and ecological sustainability, may be as important, or 
more important, than efﬁciency.
One justiﬁcation often given for a focus on efﬁciency is that it is considered an objective 
way to assess policy options. Maximizing efﬁciency is concerned only with increasing overall 
social beneﬁts, not the allocation of those beneﬁts. So, by looking only at total beneﬁts, in 
principle we avoid making subjective judgments about who receives those beneﬁts.
As in our discussion of positive and normative statements in Chapter 1, we need to look 
further to understand any subjective inferences from this viewpoint. In particular, an emphasis 
on efﬁciency implicitly views the current distribution of economic resources as acceptable. 
In order to understand this, we need to expand our notion of efﬁciency. Although we have 
been discussing efﬁciency as it applies in a single market, we can also deﬁne efﬁciency as 
maximizing social beneﬁts across the totality of markets.
BOX 6.1 THE DEBATE OVER THE IMPACT OF MINIMUM WAGE LAWS
The model presented in this chapter illustrates that a 
minimum wage, a type of price ﬂoor, will reduce em-
ployment. The only question, it seems, is how much.
In the most referenced research on the topic, two 
economists, David Card and Alan Krueger, took ad-
vantage of a real-world experiment to try to answer 
this question. In 1992 the minimum wage in New 
Jersey was raised from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour. In 
the neighboring state of Pennsylvania, the minimum 
wage remained at $4.25/hour. Card and Krueger 
then collected employment data from fast-food restau-
rants, which paid many workers the minimum wage, 
in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. According 
to economic theory, fast-food restaurant employ-
ment should have decreased in New Jersey relative 
to Pennsylvania.
Instead, Card and Krueger found that employ-
ment at fast-food restaurants in New Jersey actually 
increased—the opposite of what the theory predicted! 
This result initiated a lively debate among economists, 
with some arguing that it was simply impossible based 
on the market model. Research subsequent to Card 
and Krueger’s 1994 paper has produced mixed re-
sults. Some studies have identiﬁed a negative employ-
ment impact from minimum wage laws, while others 
have found no discernible impacts. A 2006 article in 
The Economist notes: “Today’s consensus, insofar as 
there is one, seems to be that raising minimum wages 
has minor negative effects at worst.” However, the 
article does note that raising the minimum wage is not 
a very effective tool for reducing poverty. For example, 
many people paid the minimum wage are teenage 
workers who are not from poor families. The article 
suggests that tax credits paid to low-income workers, 
such as the Earned Income Tax Credit in the United 
States, are more effective at reducing poverty.
There may also be a difference between the United 
States and Europe. In the United States, the minimum 
wage may be fairly close to the equilibrium wage, and 
thus its impact on employment is relatively small. In 
Europe, minimum wages are much higher and con-
sequently are more likely to be a signiﬁcant cause of 
unemployment among low-skilled workers.

CHAPTER 6 — WELFARE ANALYSIS
Consider that markets allocate resources across different markets based on consumers’ 
willingness to pay. In one sense, markets are democratic in the sense that everyone is 
free to participate in them and can thus make their preferences known. But unlike in the 
democratic principle of “one person, one vote,” markets operate according to a “one dollar, 
one vote” principle. In other words, those with more economic resources have a greater say in 
determining what a society produces. So whether a society allocates resources at the margin 
to luxury cars or school lunches depends to some extent on the relative willingness to pay 
for each.* If the demand by wealthy consumers for luxury cars exceeds the demand by other 
consumers for school lunches, then that society’s production will shift toward producing 
more luxury cars and fewer school lunches.
So, while at ﬁrst glance it seems that a focus on efﬁciency avoids having to make subjective 
assessments, we see that efﬁciency cannot be separated from questions about fairness. Whether 
the existing distribution of wealth and income in the United States is fair is a question that 
we consider in more detail in Chapter 11.
5.2 MARKET FAILURE
Can we conclude from welfare analysis that unregulated markets are always efﬁcient and 
that the only justiﬁcation for government intervention is to further other social goals such 
as justice or ecological sustainability? No, because economists also recognize situations in 
which unregulated markets are not efﬁcient. In these cases, government intervention may be 
justiﬁed solely to increase economic efﬁciency.
Situations in which unregulated markets fail to maximize social efﬁciency are referred to as 
market failure. In response to market failure, we may be able to design policies that “correct” 
the market failure—an intervention that then allows the outcome to be socially efﬁcient.
We consider several instances of market failure in later chapters. These examples include:
s  In Chapter 9 we look at how consumer behavior can lead to inefﬁcient market outcomes. 
These outcomes may be due to irrational consumer behavior, as discussed in Chapter 8, 
arising from either decision-making limitations or external factors that lead consumers to 
make inefﬁcient choices, such as advertising.
s  In Chapter 10 we look at labor markets, which may also be subject to market failure. For 
example, employers may have signiﬁcantly more power than workers, or institutional ar-
rangements may prevent an efﬁcient outcome.
s  Situations in which there are signiﬁcant impacts on “the rest of society” (including the 
natural environment, and people of the future). Costs and beneﬁts to “the rest of society” 
should be included in a complete welfare analysis of any market. In Chapter 13, we consider 
the importance of these impacts, particularly with regard to environmental policy.
s  Not all products can be efﬁciently allocated using private markets. In extreme cases, no 
private market will arise at all, as no potential for proﬁts exists. The provision of some 
goods and services directly by public sphere entities is addressed in Chapter 14.
s  In Chapters 17 and 18, we consider different market structures based on the degree of 
producer competition. We see that insufﬁcient competition is another common example of 
market failure.
Going beyond the theoretical model presented in this chapter, to a more real-world 
perspective on economics in these future chapters, we see that unregulated efﬁcient markets are 
more the exception rather than the rule. Yet this does not mean that government intervention 
is always justiﬁed in situations of market failure. We must consider the details of individual 
markets to determine whether intervention is justiﬁed. If an intervention is justiﬁed, we must 
*The allocation will also depend on the cost of production. For example, even if the willingness to pay for luxury cars 
exceeds the willingness to pay for school lunches, if producers cannot make equal or greater proﬁts selling luxury cars, they 
will not have an incentive to produce them.

decide what type is appropriate—a tax, a subsidy, or some other regulation. We must also 
decide the magnitude of the intervention. For example, if we institute a tax on gasoline to 
correct for a market failure, should it be 10 cents a gallon, $1.00 per gallon, or more?
We also have to be clear whether the justiﬁcation for intervention is based on increasing 
efﬁciency or achieving another goal. In some cases, increased efﬁciency may be possible 
while also making progress on other social goals. In other cases, we must assess whether we 
should place a higher priority on economic efﬁciency or on another objective.

International Trade and Trade Policy
What does the United States export more of than anything else on the global market? The an-
swer might surprise you (hint: think food). And which country purchases more U.S. exports—
China or Mexico? In fact, the United States exports twice as much to Mexico as to China in 
terms of value. Are there similar surprises to be found when we look at Japan, for example, or 
Brazil? More generally, what factors determine which goods a country produces for trade with 
other countries? Classical economists Adam Smith and David Ricardo noticed that countries 
will tend to produce an abundance of goods that they are especially good at producing and 
trade their surplus for other goods that they are not as skilled at producing. Smith and Ricardo 
also believed that such trades would always beneﬁt both countries. Yet, as we see, the world 
has grown increasingly complex over the past two centuries, and, despite obvious advantages 
to free trade, there are also reasons for caution. This chapter considers some of these issues 
and discusses ways in which national governments have addressed them.
1. TRADE, SPECIALIZATION, AND PRODUCTIVITY
As we saw earlier, Adam Smith is generally credited with the idea that leaving decisions of 
production and distribution to a market system is superior to having the government impose 
its will. Many recognize this as the meaning of “laissez-faire” as discussed in Chapter 6. Here 
we look at what it is about free markets that, in theory, produces desirable outcomes in terms 
of trade, both within and between countries.
In An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776), Smith made 
a connection between specialization and efﬁciency. We have seen that one way to deﬁne 
“efﬁciency” is to say that efﬁcient production allows us to obtain the maximum product 
from a given amount of resources, or conversely to require the least possible resources to 
produce a given amount of a product. This is a fundamental economic goal because it has 
very important consequences for the well-being of individuals, groups, and countries. What 
Smith argued was that specialization (he called it “division of labor”) would make people 
more efﬁcient, because focusing our time on one task (or a few tasks) instead of many would 
make us learn it more quickly and become better at it.
Smith then noted that the extent of the specialization achieved in a society would be 
governed by the extent or size of the market. If, for example, the market for shoes were tiny, 
it would make no sense for you to devote all your time to shoe production, as you would not 
make enough money in such a small market to support yourself. If, however, the market were 
large, specialization would make sense—and the larger the market, the more that you would 
want to specialize. Nobody speaks more eloquently on this subject than Smith himself:
As it is the power of exchanging that gives occasion to the division of labour, so the extent 
of this division must always be limited by the extent of that power, or, in other words, by the 

 
GAINS FROM TRADE 
153
extent of the market. When the market is very small, no person can have any encouragement 
to dedicate himself entirely to one employment, for want of the power to exchange all that 
surplus part of the produce of his own labor, which is over and above his own consumption, 
for such parts of the produce of other men’s labour as he has occasion for.1 
Taking this logic to its extreme, economic productivity in all areas would be maximized 
if all markets were extended around the world. It is for this reason that Smith advocated 
not only a system of free markets for a speciﬁc economy but also free and unfettered trade 
among countries. Although the same logic applied at any scale of participation—that is, the 
logic of mutual gains for both parties—it seemed perfectly reasonable that under globalized 
markets more would be gained because of the maximized productive efﬁciency that results 
from maximum specialization.
In Smith’s view, specialization at the national level would lead each country to become 
so efﬁcient in the production of some things that it would enjoy an “absolute advantage” 
over other countries in their production. Other countries would enjoy such an advantage in 
the production of other goods, and because each country would produce far more than it 
needed because of its remarkable productivity, there would be ample opportunity for mutually 
beneﬁcial trade between countries.
As we mentioned in the last chapter, Smith’s book was considered revolutionary. He was 
writing at a time when the so-called mercantilist philosophy prevailed—a philosophy that 
supported strong involvement by the state in economic affairs and was highly skeptical of free 
trade. Even today, more than two centuries later, debate over the beneﬁts and drawbacks of free 
trade continues. But the inﬂuence of Smith’s book is indisputable; today, his pronouncements 
in favor of free trade are about as far as one could imagine from “revolutionary,” having been 
widely accepted by many economists and policymakers.
Discussion Questions
1. Does it make sense that the larger or more extended a market is, the greater would be the 
incentive to specialize in supplying that market? What if everyone decided to specialize 
in shoemaking because the shoe market went global? What would Adam Smith say?
2. Do you currently “specialize” in something? If not, what do you plan to do after college? 
Do you hope to develop knowledge or expertise in only one area or more than one? 
Why?
2. GAINS FROM TRADE
Economists and policymakers have argued for centuries about whether it is better for a coun-
try to engage in free trade with other countries or to place some limits on such trade. Adam 
Smith presented the argument for free trade in general terms, as we have discussed. Many who 
argue for “free trade”—exchange in international markets that is not regulated or restricted 
by government actions—often appeal more speciﬁcally to David Ricardo’s 1817 book On 
the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation to demonstrate that a country that engages 
in trade can reap signiﬁcant welfare gains. In this section, we present Ricardo’s basic model, 
along with other arguments in favor of free trade.
2.1 THE THEORY OF COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE
In Chapter 1, we discussed the production-possibilities frontier (PPF), which illustrates how a 
society might make tradeoffs between the production of two different goods, reaching higher 
output levels when it uses its resources efﬁciently. We showed how some points, which rep-
resent combinations of the two outputs (guns and butter), would be unattainable. But to take 
our analysis only that far, it turns out, would be misleading.
free trade: exchange 
in international mar-
kets that is not regu-
lated or restricted by 
government actions

154 
CHAPTER 7 — INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND TRADE POLICY
Points outside a societal PPF represent unattainable levels of production for the 
society on its own. However, they may not reﬂect unattainable levels of consumption. 
The key to this apparent magic trick is in the beneﬁts that can arise from a system of 
exchange. Economists call these beneﬁts the “gains from trade,” and they are actually 
efﬁciency gains. People also often point to other important advantages derived from a 
system of exchange, as well as to important disadvantages, and we elaborate on these 
as the chapter progresses.
Ricardo’s model relies on a trade example with two goods—wine and cloth—and two 
countries—Portugal and England. Although here we give a simple numerical version of his 
story, using PPFs, the point is more general. The principles might be applied to any pair 
of economic actors—for example, housemates, companies, governments—that produce 
and exchange goods or services at any level of organization—local, regional, national, or 
global.
Returning to Ricardo’s story, suppose that, given its resources or productive factors, 
Portugal can produce a maximum of 200 bottles of wine if it devotes all its resources to wine 
production or 100 units of cloth (a unit of cloth is a “bolt”) if it devotes all of its resources 
to cloth production. In Figure 7.1 we have assumed constant opportunity costs, so the PPF 
is just a straight line.* Meanwhile, England can produce a maximum of 200 bottles of wine 
or 400 bolts of cloth, as illustrated in Figure 7.2.
*This means that, contrary to our earlier guns vs. butter example, Portugal does not give up more and more of, say, wine as it 
increasingly specializes in the production of cloth. Here we are simplifying in order to more easily illustrate the advantage of trade.

Portugal can produce 200 units of wine if it specializes 
in wine, or 100 units of cloth, if it specializes in cloth. 
Or it can produce any combination on the line between 
these two points. However it would like to consume a 
larger bundle—represented by point A.

Suppose that the Portuguese would like to be able to consume 100 bottles of wine and 100 
bolts of cloth, as represented by point A, and the English would like to be able to consume 
100 bottles of wine and 300 bolts of cloth, represented by point B. As we can see, if each 
relies only on its own production possibilities, points A and B are unachievable.
But suppose that Portugal produced only wine and England produced only cloth. This 
production combination is illustrated in the “Production” section of Table 7.1 and by points 
C and D in Figures 7.1 and 7.2. Total production would be 200 bottles of wine and 400 bolts 
of cloth.

 
GAINS FROM TRADE 
155
Further, suppose that Portugal and England were to agree to exchange 100 bottles of 
Portuguese wine for 100 bolts of English cloth, as listed in the “Exchange” section of Table 
7.1. Now Portugal and England could each consume the quantities listed in the “Consumption” 
section of Table 7.1. Note that their total consumption does not exceed the total amount 
produced of each good. Yet Portugal would consume at point A and England at point B—the 
desired points that they could not each reach on their own!
The “magic” behind this result is that Portugal and England differ in their opportunity costs 
of production. For every bolt of cloth that Portugal produces, it forgoes production of 2 bottles 
of wine. You can see this by examining the slope of the PPF in Figure 7.1. Comparing the two 
endpoints, moving from left to right, we can see that a fall (or negative “rise”) of 200 bottles 
of wine is accompanied by a “run” of +100 bolts of cloth. Because the curve is straight, the 
slope is therefore –200/100 = –2 throughout. At any point, then, reducing wine production by 
2 bottles (i.e., a fall or “negative rise” of 2) is needed to increase cloth production by 1 bolt 
(that is, to create a “run” of 1 unit to the right). However, for every bolt of cloth that England 
produces, it forgoes production of only half a bottle of wine (check this yourself using Figure 
7.2). We say that England has a comparative advantage in cloth production, because cloth 
costs less in terms of the other good (wine) in England than in Portugal. In other words, 
England has a lower opportunity cost associated with its cloth production.
The above example is undoubtedly a product of the geographical reality in Ricardo’s time. 
England had energy resources (coal) that made it relatively good at industrial production 
such as spinning and weaving and a relatively cool and cloudy climate that was not suitable 
for growing grapes. Portugal, by contrast, enjoyed a comparative advantage in production of 
wine, owing to its relatively warm and sunny climate—good for growing grapes—but lacked 
the necessary energy sources to produce cloth as efﬁciently as England. In our example, an 
additional bottle of wine comes at the cost of half a bolt of cloth when produced in Portugal 
but requires giving up 2 bolts of cloth when produced in England, as noted in Table 7.2.
Put simply, the principle of comparative advantage says that one should specialize in what 
one does best. This means that even if it turned out that one of the countries was more efﬁcient 
at producing both goods, it would still pay for that country to specialize. Indeed, it is on this

CHAPTER 7 — INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND TRADE POLICY
point especially that Ricardo goes further than Smith. While Smith had earlier expounded 
on the beneﬁts of trade, in his view the beneﬁts existed only if each country possessed an 
absolute advantage in the production of at least one good. To Smith, if a country did not 
produce at least one good more efﬁciently than its trading partner, the latter would have no 
incentive to engage in trade with it.
Ricardo recognized that even in such a circumstance both countries gain. He would 
say that a country has a comparative advantage in the good that it produces less relatively 
inefﬁciently. Both countries gain by having the economically “stronger” country produce 
only what it produces most efﬁciently and then trading. Regarding our example above, 
Ricardo would have said that even if England produced wine and cloth more efﬁciently 
(i.e., using fewer resources per unit), it would still face a higher opportunity cost than 
Portugal for the good that it was relatively less efﬁcient at producing—so there would still 
exist mutual gains from trade. Only if both countries faced exactly the same opportunity 
costs (an exceedingly rare phenomenon in the real world) would there be no possible gains 
from trade.
The source of comparative advantage in the above example is climate and other resource 
endowments, which differed between England and Portugal. It is not hard, by extension, to 
understand why, for example, bananas are currently exported by Ecuador, while Sweden ﬁnds 
it advantageous to import bananas rather than grow them in greenhouses. But comparative 
advantage can also be created by human action. Countries can become more efﬁcient at 
producing particular goods by investing in the physical capital needed to produce them. 
Sometimes, technological advances or changes in the social organization of work can change 
the pattern of comparative advantage, and the evolution of comparative advantage over time 
may thus be unpredictable.
Ricardo’s example concerned trade between countries, but the principle of comparative 
advantage has also been used to show how other economic actors can reap gains from 
trade. Organizations seek gains from trade when they specialize in a particular area—say, 
production of training workshops—while contracting with other companies to provide support 
services—say, transportation or advertising design. You may reap gains from trade in your 
household if, instead of splitting all chores 50–50, you put the person who is relatively more 
“efﬁcient” (i.e., better) at shopping in charge of shopping and the person who is relatively 
efﬁcient at cleaning in charge of cleaning.
The mere fact that some companies, or some people, could be self-sufﬁcient in producing 
everything that they need does not mean that they should provide everything for themselves. 
The story of specialization and gains from trade is a powerful one.
Economists often make a distinction between countries that are thought to be more suited 
for labor-intensive production processes, such as stitching clothing or making handicrafts, 
and others that specialize in relatively capital-intensive production, such as the manufacture 
of airplanes or automobiles. The fact that the United States has more manufactured capital 
per worker than does Bangladesh, for example, is considered an explanation for Bangladeshi 
exports of clothing. Bangladesh presumably has a comparative advantage in relatively 
labor-intensive industries. Clothing production, meanwhile, has nearly disappeared from 
the United States.
The economic theory of factor-price equalization predicts that free trade should tend to 
equalize the returns to capital (proﬁts) and labor (wages) across countries. For example, to 
the extent that the United States is rich in capital and relatively lacking in labor power, in 
the absence of trade, returns to capital are theorized to be relatively low and returns to labor 
relatively high. The logic of this is that a scarce factor commands a higher return—higher 
demand for a factor, relative to available supplies, increases the price that must be paid for it. 
Because factor endowments in Bangladesh are the opposite, capital investments there would 
be expected to receive high returns in the absence of trade, while workers receive low wages 
compared to those in the United States.

GAINS FROM TRADE 
157
After the two countries start to trade, however, the demand for capital in the United States 
should rise (because the country now has a larger market for selling its capital-intensive 
goods), increasing the return on investments there. The demand for labor, however, will fall, 
because the United States will now be importing labor-intensive goods from Bangladesh. 
Meanwhile, the demand for labor in Bangladesh should rise (because it now exports labor-
intensive goods), putting upward pressure on wages in that country, while returns to capital 
there fall. According to this theory, in a (hypothetical) world of perfectly free trade, we would 
expect wages to converge eventually, so that workers in the United States and Bangladesh 
would be paid about the same. Returns to capital investments would also be equalized.
Of course, in the real world wages are much higher in the United States than in Bangladesh—
about 30 times higher. The theory of factor-price equalization merely states that wages should 
eventually converge, yet it says nothing about how long this process may take. 
We ﬁnd evidence of factor-price equalization in other cases, such as economic growth in 
Asia over the past 50 years. It is hard to remember now that Japan (in the 1950s) and then 
South Korea were the ﬁrst two Asian countries that “bootstrapped” their economic growth 
by depending heavily on the export of very cheap goods made with very cheap labor. We 
could use factor-price equalization to explain how wages in those countries have risen to the 
levels of other industrialized countries—although it is evident that this did not just happen 
automatically but was urged in the right direction by a combination of factors, including 
government policies of industrial support and strong support for economic equality. It is now 
possible to see substantially rising wages in China. Will the same happen in Bangladesh, for 
example? The theory of factor-price equalization does not say what institutions or policies 
are necessary for this to happen.
The theory of factor-price equalization also disregards the possibility that, instead of an 
international equalization of wages, higher unemployment would result. This has, in fact, 
been a far more common outcome in countries like the United States; internationally as well 
as locally, wages seem to rise with some ease, while being “sticky” downward (as we will 
discuss in Chapter 10). More often than not, rich country labor markets “adjust” by seeing 
capital move overseas to take advantage of lower wages in other countries. The result is that 
wages remain relatively high in the United States, but some people lose their jobs.
Another reason that the theory can mislead is that investments in human capital—health, 
skills, and education—blur the distinction between “labor” and “capital.” Some studies suggest 
that the comparative advantage of the United States is now tilted toward goods that require 
production by an educated and skilled workforce and away from production that involves 
lower-skilled work or heavy machinery. When production is intensive in human capital, the 
earlier two-way classiﬁcation is harder to apply. Meanwhile, studies of factor prices are mixed 
in their support of the theory of factor-price equalization. Ongoing changes in technology, 
skills, and the composition of production, as well as deliberate government policies that limit 
and shift patterns of trade, make it difﬁcult to test the theory.
2.2 OTHER BENEFITS OF FREE TRADE
Specialization and trade can lead to improvements in economic efﬁciency, as the story of 
comparative advantage points out. Trade allowed Portugal and England to organize their use of 
resources more efﬁciently for producing wine and cloth. The result was a more highly valued 
combination of outputs than the countries could have achieved through self-sufﬁciency. Yet 
many also point to additional advantages of systems based on exchange.
Exchange relations, for example, give economic actors (whether countries, businesses, 
or workers) clear incentives to be productive: Because these relations are quid pro quo, in 
order to get something, you must have something to give! Unless you happen to be sitting 
on a pile of wealth, it means that you have to do or make something that other people value 
before you can participate in exchange. If you see something that you want, and exchange is 

158 
CHAPTER 7 — INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND TRADE POLICY
the only way to get it, exchange relations provide a strong extrinsic motivation to participate 
in productive activities.
In particular, decentralized exchange through markets is thought to have advantages, 
in terms of incentives, that lead to efﬁciency even in the case of changing conditions. In 
decentralized market exchange, individual actors make agreements to trade at a particular 
moment in time or for some span of time speciﬁed by a contract. When that particular trade 
is completed, each partner can choose to try to continue this trading relationship or can look 
for new ones.
Suppose that after trading with England for some time, Portugal discovered that it could get 
more cloth (or other valuable goods) by growing table grapes for Germany than by producing 
wine for England. In a system of decentralized, or “free market,” unregulated exchange, it 
could freely move resources into producing the more highly valued product. A system of 
market exchange gives producers incentives to produce the goods that command the highest 
market value. Such an incentive therefore has the potential to encourage competition and 
innovation, to the ultimate beneﬁt of all consumers.
Another desirable consequence of free trade or exchange is technical. A production process 
is characterized by “economies of scale” (we’ll discuss this topic in more detail in Chapter 
16) if the cost per unit of production falls as the volume of production rises. With trade, 
the volume of a country’s production of a good can be substantially higher than its internal 
(domestic) market can use, increasing the opportunity for economies of scale to be realized. 
A larger market means that goods can be produced more cheaply, a fact related to Smith’s 
earlier point about specialization.
In addition to the incentive to generate greater value and economies of scale, many 
economists also believe that exchange is a morally praiseworthy form of distribution because 
of its noncoercive nature. People enter into exchanges voluntarily. As we noted in Chapter 1, 
freedom is among the ﬁnal goals that you might hope for in an economic system. Presumably, 
if what you are offered in exchange does not meet your idea of what you think your item is 
worth, you can refuse to make the trade.
Finally, some argue that exchange relations encourage economic actors to think in terms 
of their common interests. Rather than each actor watching out for just him- or herself or 
close kin, exchange relations bind actors together in a sort of cooperative venture. Classical 
economists like Ricardo and Smith often argued along these lines. Indeed, writers of that era 
often waxed eloquent on the moral and community-building advantages that they saw in a 
system of exchange. A seventeenth-century business textbook, for example, claimed that
[Divine Providence] has not willed for everything that is needed for life to be found 
in the same spot. It has dispersed its gifts so that men [sic] would trade together and 
so that the mutual need which they have to help one another would establish ties of 
friendship among them. This continuous exchange of all the comforts of life constitutes 
commerce and this commerce makes for all the gentleness of life. 2
If England and Portugal came to rely on each other for trade, such thinking goes, they 
might think twice about engaging in a war with each other. Citizens of any city, such writers 
argued, would likewise be motivated to act more respectfully to each other when they shared 
commercial interests.
You can ﬁnd real-world cases in which this appears to be true. For example, after World 
War II the United States acted beneﬁcently toward the devastated countries of Europe. It 
gave them signiﬁcant aid for rebuilding their industries and infrastructure though a program 
called the Marshall Plan. Why? The actual name of the act that created the Marshall Plan 
was “The Economic Cooperation Act of 1948.” U.S. policymakers realized that their own 
economy would not prosper unless the economies of its major trading partners prospered 
as well.

 
DRAWBACKS OF FREE TRADE 
159
In contemporary times, as well, some invoke the image of a market-based “global 
village,” in which countries, linked by economic interdependence, also enter into 
harmonious mutual understanding and cultural exchange. Advocates of free trade argue 
that increased globalization of economic activity, free of barriers set up by governments, 
will lead to greater good for all.
Discussion Questions
1. Suppose that in a one-hour period, you can buy six bags of groceries or clean three rooms. 
Your housemate, however, is slower moving and can buy only three bags of groceries or 
clean only one room in an hour. You clearly have an absolute advantage in production of 
both these services. Does this mean you should do all the work?
2. Ricardo’s model discusses beneﬁts to countries at an aggregate level. But what if you were 
a Portuguese cloth maker or an English winemaker? Might you have a different view about 
the beneﬁts of trade? Which factors might inﬂuence what you think about your country’s 
trade policies?
3. DRAWBACKS OF FREE TRADE
David Ricardo’s simple example of two countries and two goods neglects some political, 
social, and environmental issues that can sometimes offset “gains from trade” or eliminate 
them altogether. Because rational thinking about the role that societies should allow exchange 
to have as a mode of distribution requires weighing both beneﬁts and costs, we must also 
examine the drawbacks of organizing distribution by exchange. The potential disadvantages 
of exchange as a form of distribution, and of the specialization that often accompanies ex-
change, include increased vulnerability, becoming locked into disadvantageous production 
patterns, abuse of power, and the destruction of community.
3.1 VULNERABILITY
One obvious potential problem with specialization and exchange is that each party becomes 
more vulnerable to the actions of its trading partners. Supplies of the things that you need, 
and markets for what you sell, could deteriorate or be cut off at any time. This is as true for 
individuals and businesses as for countries. If you let your housemate specialize in shopping 
and cooking, for example, you may ﬁnd yourself hungry if the exchange relationship sud-
denly breaks down. Businesses may ﬁnd themselves unable to obtain needed inputs when 
the source of the inputs is not under their direct control. If Portugal and England were to go 
to war, to continue the earlier example, or if Portugal were to ﬁnd a better buyer, England 
might temporarily ﬁnd itself with an excess of cloth and no wine to drink.
For many nonessential goods for which substitutes exist, the issue of vulnerability may seem 
relatively unimportant. But vulnerability is a more serious issue at the national or international 
level when the goods in question are resources such as oil, minerals, food, or water, the lack 
of which would seriously weaken an economy or country. In the United States, for example, 
some of the same people who argue for “free trade” in most goods also argue for increased 
development of domestic energy resources, on grounds that excessive reliance on petroleum 
imports decreases economic self-sufﬁciency and military preparedness.
Vulnerability is also a serious issue for countries that rely heavily on sales of a single, or 
a few, export goods for much of their national income. In Ethiopia, for example, producing 
coffee for export is currently the vastly dominant source of cash income for about one-quarter 
of the population. When the price of the export commodity is high in international markets, 
such national economies do well. When prices weaken—or plummet, as coffee prices did in 
1989—economies dependent on single exports are subjected to major crises that are beyond 
their control.

160 
CHAPTER 7 — INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND TRADE POLICY
Besides making an economy vulnerable to the whims of its trading partners, widespread 
monoculture (growing of a single kind of crop) carries other risks as well. It can make 
agricultural economies more susceptible to crises arising from events such as drought, an 
agricultural pest, or disease. In a more diversiﬁed economy, some sectors and crops may do 
well while others are hard hit; in a very specialized agricultural economy, the entire economy 
may spin into crisis from one adverse event.
Thus, although the “gains from trade” argument appears logically correct, the beneﬁts of 
specialization and trade must be weighed against its costs. When diversiﬁcation increases 
national security, economic stability, or ecological diversity, then a decision not to rely on 
trade for certain things may be better than pure specialization.
3.2 LOCK-IN
Some production processes are characterized by increasing returns: The more of something 
that you do, the more efﬁcient you become. In dynamic economic systems, patterns of com-
parative advantage can change over time as a consequence of learning by doing.
To draw a personal analogy, during your early years of school, it may have seemed more 
efﬁcient for you, when you were ﬁrst doing simple arithmetic problems, to use a calculator. 
Chances are that your teachers told you that you could not use a calculator, however. They 
demanded that you not use the easy (and, in the short run, more efﬁcient) method and, instead, 
build up a base of cognitive skills (for greater long-run efﬁciency). They did not want you 
to become locked into an arithmetic “production technology” that was dependent on the 
presence of a calculator.
Similarly, an important question for a company deciding which lines of business to enter, 
or for a country trying to build a healthy national economy, is whether it should engage in 
some kinds of production that may seem inefﬁcient now but have the potential to improve 
with time and growth. Should a country, for example, stay locked into its current pattern of 
comparative advantage—for example, by importing cars and not even thinking of building 
a domestic auto industry? Or should it, at least temporarily, restrict automobile imports (as 
Japan did), while developing its own auto industry past the start-up stage?
The critical issue here is that people, companies, or countries should not become “locked 
in” to specializing in what they do well today if doing so prevents them from developing 
their future potential in other, more rewarding, pursuits. If, in other words, workers stood to 
eventually gain from producing cars and electronics instead of bananas and coffee, specializing 
and getting “locked into” banana and coffee production would likely be harmful to future 
development prospects.
3.3 COERCION AND POWER DIFFERENTIALS
Our simple story of England and Portugal also ignored the real-world political context of 
exchange relations. Some element of voluntariness is always present in exchange, but real-
world exchange relations are also heavily inﬂuenced by the relative power of the parties 
involved.
For example, we described England and Portugal as exchanging 100 bottles of wine for 
100 bolts of cloth—a 1:1 ratio. But what if England were more powerful and could demand 
different terms, more in its own favor? England might have such a power advantage if it were 
the only seller of cloth or the only buyer of wine, or through its military might, or through 
controlling important ﬁnancial institutions or access to technology.
Whatever the source of its power, suppose England were to demand that Portugal give it 
100 bottles of wine in exchange for only 60 bolts of cloth instead of 100. Under such a deal, 
production, exchange, and consumption would be as described in Table 7.3. England would 
end up consuming more, and Portugal consuming less, than in the consumption outcome 
described earlier.

 
DRAWBACKS OF FREE TRADE 
161
Would Portugal voluntarily accept such an exchange? Looking back at Figure 7.1, you can 
see that a consumption pattern of 100 bottles of wine and 60 bolts of cloth is still outside of 
Portugal’s own PPF. Thus Portugal might, indeed, still ﬁnd it advantageous to trade rather 
than go it alone. (Note that if England offered only 50 bolts of cloth or less, Portugal would 
not want to trade, because it could do at least as well on its own.)
England does not need to coerce Portugal directly into trading: Portugal’s trade is still 
voluntary. But if England had more power than Portugal, it could force Portugal to accept 
terms of trade that favor England. In fact, it was England’s superior military power that led to 
the opening of Portuguese cloth markets to English manufactures (see Box 7.1). If, instead, 
Portugal had been the country with more power, it might have been able to enforce terms of 
trade that were more in its own favor (say, 100 bottles of wine for 150, rather than 100, bolts 
of cloth). Similarly, if you and your housemate engage in specialization and exchange of your 
services, a variety of equitable and inequitable distributions of tasks are possible, based on 
your relative bargaining power. Just because an exchange is voluntary does not mean that it 
is fair or that differences in power are irrelevant.
Similar struggles for power go on within countries that are considering engaging in world 
trade. Countries in the real world are not simple, unitary decision makers but, rather, are made 
up of a diversity of citizens, workers, companies, and so on. Although importing wine may 
be to the advantage of England as a whole, in the sense shown in our graphs and charts, it 
could be disastrous for part of England—namely England’s previous wine producers, who 
would lose their livelihood.

BOX 7.1 ENGLAND, PORTUGAL, AND THE TREATY OF METHUEN
When Ricardo wrote about trade between England 
and Portugal in 1817, it was indeed true that England 
exported cloth to Portugal in return for wine. But this 
was not pure “free trade,” and it had not come about 
simply due to the impersonal forces of economic ef-
ﬁciency and comparative advantage.
Before the Treaty of Methuen in 1703, Portugal 
had severely restricted the importation of cloth from 
abroad, and England had imported wine primarily 
from France. But England lost much of its access to 
French wine during the War of the Spanish Succession 
(1701–1714). Portugal, meanwhile, was pressured 
to join a military alliance with England by displays 
of England’s superior naval power. The 1703 treaty 
cementing their alliance also contained economic 
terms: Portugal would admit English cloth without 
charging any tariffs at all, while England would 
reduce its tariffs on Portuguese wine to two-thirds of 
what it collected on French wine. Some commenta-
tors argue that this was a crucial—and negative—
turning point for the development of Portuguese 
manufacturing.

162 
CHAPTER 7 — INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND TRADE POLICY
A concern for human well-being, rather than just for efﬁciency per se, demands that such 
distributional considerations be taken into account. When increased trade threatens a major 
industry, the negative effects on certain people and regions can be deep and prolonged. 
This happened in Detroit, formerly a bustling industrial city, which became economically 
depressed—part of the U.S. “rust belt”—as auto manufacturing gradually moved overseas. In 
parts of Africa during the late twentieth century, increases in export agriculture, run largely 
by men, caused hardships for those engaged in subsistence agriculture, primarily women and 
children. It may be that efﬁciency gains for the country as a whole outweigh local losses. But 
the local losses, and the costs of redistribution policies designed to alleviate hardship and 
move people to new occupations, must be properly weighed when the beneﬁts and costs of 
exchange relationships are considered.
3.4 OTHER SOCIAL AND POLITICAL IMPACTS
Is it appropriate to establish trade in anything? There is reasonable resistance to the idea of 
“commodifying” certain things that society does not generally treat as commodities. Most 
agree, for example, that kidneys, votes, and babies should never be a part of exchange rela-
tions. Treating such things as though they were on a par with shoelaces or cars is thought to 
destroy the bonds of respect necessary for social life. Potentially life-saving kidney operations, 
for example, might become available based on ability to pay rather than medical urgency.
Current tensions between government and corporate interests are another area for controversy. In 
Ricardo’s time, it was natural to think about international trade in terms of the actions and policies 
of countries such as England and Portugal, but in the twenty-ﬁrst century, discussing trade in terms 
of multinational corporations such as Microsoft and Daimler-Benz might be at least as appropriate. 
Corporations have grown ever larger and have become able to move their ﬁnancial capital and 
their physical production facilities across international boundaries with increasing ease. 
This leads to a dilemma for governments. Traditionally, democratic governments have been 
able to enact policies perceived to be in the public interest, even though they were not always 
in the interest of business. Minimum standards for pay and safety on the job, for example, 
or environmental standards and taxation to support public projects, are widely considered 
necessary for a healthy, just society. Yet members of the business sphere often oppose such 
policies because they generally increase costs and decrease proﬁts.
Because capital is increasingly mobile, businesses exclusively concerned with proﬁts are 
able to move their operations to countries with lower labor and environmental standards 
and taxes. Countries or states that want to hold onto their business base may therefore ﬁnd 
themselves drawn into a “race to the bottom,” in which they compete to attract businesses 
on the basis of their lack of attention to social and environmental concerns. This is a serious 
concern for cities and states, as well as for countries; some regions, in their eagerness to 
compete for businesses that will bring jobs, have offered to soften environmental regulations, 
while providing other incentives—tax holidays, building infrastructure, and so on—that have, 
in some cases ended up costing the region hundreds of thousands of dollars per job created. 
For an example of this from the United States, see Box 7.2.
Powerful corporations can also attempt to inﬂuence international organizations and 
agreements directly. These issues began to receive more public attention in the United States 
after the 1999 “anti-globalization” demonstrations at the Seattle meetings of the World Trade 
Organization. The ability of people to make democratic decisions about the direction of their 
society is threatened when the power of democratic governments is overshadowed by the 
power of nondemocratic economic interests.
These political and social impacts need to be considered as we evaluate the impacts of 
trade. They do not necessarily invalidate the basic message of Ricardo regarding the great 
beneﬁts to be gained from freer trade. But they must at least be considered as economists 
and policymakers try to formulate appropriate trade policies.

2. What do you suppose Smith or Ricardo would have had to say about the disadvantages

4. GLOBALIZATION AND POLICY
As the global scope and volume of trade has increased, we need to consider the realities of 
globalization rather than simply of trade between two countries such as England and Portugal. 
Globalization involves increasing trade and communications among all parts of the world, 
leading to a great increase in the volume of traded goods and services. These interconnections 
turn up in a large variety of ways, including:

BOX 7.2 THE HIGH COST OF COMPETING FOR JOBS
Politicians commonly talk about the need to “create 
jobs,” but often the competition among different regions 
for jobs can come at a high cost to taxpayers. In the 
United States, individual states often ﬁnd themselves 
courting companies to locate a new production facility 
or other large employment center in their state. The win-
ning state in such competitions is normally the one that 
offers the largest ﬁnancial incentive to the company.
One notable example of this competition for 
jobs occurred in the 1990s, as the states of North 
Carolina, South Carolina, and Alabama vied to 
become the location of the ﬁrst Mercedes-Benz fac-
tory in the United States. As each state sweetened its 
offer, Mercedes eventually requested that the winning 
state pay some of the workers’ wages. The apparent 
frontrunner, North Carolina, balked at this request, 
which allowed Alabama to win the competition for 
the factory. Alabama additionally agreed to purchase 
the land for the factory for $30 million, with public 
funds, and lease it to Mercedes for only $100. On 
top of that the state provided tax breaks valued at 
about $300 million. Ultimately, it is estimated that the 
cost to taxpayers for each job created was between 
$153,000 and $220,000.
Some economists believe Alabama’s offer was eco-
nomically irrational. Joel Kotkin, an economic analyst 
who has followed various competitions among states 
for corporate investment, said “They went crazy. This 
is lunatic stuff.” Noting Alabama’s need for improved 
education, he added, “The question is, what have you 
taken out of your economy in order to do this? Most 
studies show it doesn’t work. You’re essentially giving 
away three-quarters of what you’re going to gain.”
Now that the factory is operating, employing about 
3,000 workers, it is unclear whether Alabama’s invest-
ment has paid off. According to economic analysis by 
Mercedes, the factory has added $1.3 billion annu-
ally to the state’s economy. But academic economists 
remain divided.  
Annette Watters, assistant director for the Center 
for Business & Economic Research at University of 
Alabama, has noted, “Some of the beneﬁts are so 
difﬁcult to measure. There are still strongly held 
opinions in the academic community that it’s good 
and that it’s bad.”

consumers.
Although many of these developments are conducive to increased well-being overall, 
globalization can also accentuate some of the problems with free trade discussed above. Trade 
does create winners and losers; how is one to determine the relative importance of each group—for 
example, consumers, workers, citizens, children, and businesspeople? Are the wishes of consumers 
for lower prices as important as workers’ fears of losing their jobs to foreign competition? Chapter 
6, on welfare analysis, supplied some tools for measuring gains and losses in social welfare, but, 
as emphasized there, those tools depended entirely on market valuations. Thus, for example, if 
the workers’ wages are low to begin with, their loss will not be counted as heavily in a standard 
welfare analysis as it would be if the “social loss” came out to a larger dollar ﬁgure.
In addition to economic threats, globalization is sometimes also criticized for its political 
and cultural effects, as people feel as if they are losing control over their local customs and 
livelihoods in a globalized world. This has often led to some degree of popular and government 
resistance to free trade and globalization.
4.1 TRADE PROTECTIONISM
Exchange, as we have noted, has the potential to produce mutually beneﬁcial outcomes for 
the parties involved, whether countries, companies, or family members. Yet we have also 
considered some reasons to be wary of too much reliance on exchange. National governments 
have always been aware of these problems and have historically tried, through a variety of 
policy tools, to control the degree to which their markets were “free.” The use of such poli-
cies is often referred to as protectionism.
One example of protectionism, probably the most commonly used throughout history, is a 
tariff (sometimes called a “duty”). Tariffs are taxes charged by national governments to importers 
of merchandise from other countries. They often reduce trade to some degree, because the tariff 
raises the price of the good sold in the importing country, thereby reducing the import quantity 
demanded. The tariff can also have the effect of raising the price of domestically produced goods 
that compete with the imported good. Tariffs therefore tend to beneﬁt domestic producers while 
raising prices to consumers. They also provide the government with often critically important 
tax revenue; indeed, this has often been the primary motivation for tariffs through history. 
Finally, tariffs sometimes even force foreign producers to lower their prices in order to remain 
competitive with domestic producers who do not pay the tariff.
Another example of protectionism is a trade quota, which is a limit on the quantity of 
a good that can be imported from another country. By restricting supply, a quota generally 
has the effect of increasing the price of the good. Like a tariff, it helps domestic producers 
by shielding them from lower-price competition, and it hurts consumers by making them 
pay a higher price. Unlike tariffs, quotas generally do not provide monetary beneﬁt to the 
government, except when the quotas are sold or auctioned to the importers (this may be done 
out in the open or “unofﬁcially”). The effect on the exporting foreign country is, however, 
more ambiguous than with a tariff. On the one hand, the quota may hurt foreign producers 
because it limits how much of a particular good they can export. On the other hand, they 
may obtain some beneﬁt from extra revenues from the artiﬁcially higher price. Which effect 
prevails depends on, among other things, the elasticity of demand (discussed in Chapter 5) 
for the imported good.
Imposing either tariffs or quotas or both has historically been the most frequently method 
of engaging in protectionism. But a few others, while less direct, have gained in importance in 
recent decades. One of these is the trade-related subsidy, which, unlike a tariff or quota, may 
be used to either expand or contract trade (and therefore cannot always precisely be regarded as 
protectionism:

ment policies to

“protectionist”). Trade expansion is facilitated through subsidies to exporters, since such payments 
reduce their production costs and therefore help exporters price their goods more competitively 
in foreign markets. Such payments can also be granted to domestic producers to encourage the 
production of certain goods for domestic markets, with a goal of reducing the quantity of imports. 
This is achieved to the extent that the demand for imports can be diverted to the domestic product 
(which is nothing more than a substitute for the imported product). Such subsidies fall into the 
more general policy of import substitution, which refers to government promotion of greater 
economic independence by decreasing the country’s dependence on imports. 
A ﬁnal category of protectionism is subtle and often not easy to detect. It is when countries 
use administrative obstacles such as regulations relating to the environment, consumer 
protection, and labor standards to block importation of goods from foreign countries. They 
are difﬁcult to detect because most of the time the pretext seems legitimate—and often it is. 
But in some cases it is clear that the standard being upheld is nothing more than a form of 
protectionism. In 1984, for example, the European Union (EU) struck down the German “beer 
purity” law—in effect for more than 300 years—a law that required all beer sold in Germany 
to use only a select few ingredients. The EU overturned the law because it found that it was 
motivated less by true concerns about “purity” than by the desire to keep beer imports out 
of the country. Another more amusing example occurred in the 1980s when Japan sought to 
ban imports of European ski equipment on grounds that Japanese snow was “unique” and 
that only Japanese-manufactured equipment was suitable for skiing on it.
Countries do not necessarily choose sets of policies that consistently lead toward “openness” 
or consistently toward “closedness.” Often there is a mix—policies are chosen for a wide 
variety of reasons and can even work at cross-purposes. Nor do countries choose their policies 
in a vacuum. Policymakers need to take into account the reactions of foreign governments 
to their policies. Increasingly, they also need to pay attention to whether their policies are in 
compliance with international agreements.
4.2 INTERNATIONAL TRADE AGREEMENTS
Many countries remained quite closed to trade up through the early decades of the twentieth 
century, charging high tariffs or imposing strict quotas on imported goods. It was only after 
World War II that this began to change. Despite Smith and Ricardo’s famous pronouncements 
in favor of free trade, throughout history countries have seldom reduced their barriers to trade 
unilaterally. But starting in the 1940s, many countries became more interested in negotiating 
mutual reductions in tariffs and quotas.
Some trade agreements are “bilateral,” meaning that two countries negotiate directly with 
each other. Other agreements are “multilateral,” involving a group of countries. In 1948, 23 
countries joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which sought to set 
out rules for trade and enhance negotiations. The GATT has sponsored eight subsequent 
negotiation “trade rounds,” some of which led to signiﬁcant reductions in average tariff rates 
among participating countries over the next several decades.
In 1995, the Uruguay Round of GATT trade negotiations led to the creation of a new forum 
for multilateral negotiations, the World Trade Organization (WTO). As of 2013, the WTO 
has 159 member countries. In addition to being a forum for trade negotiations, the WTO 
attempts to set out rules about trade and is charged with investigating and making rulings 
on trade disputes between member countries. Many believe that its rulings are not without 
bias, because the WTO tends to rule in favor of the party in the dispute that is upholding free 
trade principles. In 2009, for example, the United States appealed to the WTO over dozens 
of subsidies that China was granting to its apparel, agriculture, and electronics industries. 
Anticipating the WTO’s unfavorable ruling, China voluntarily ended the subsidies.
Some critics argue that, because of its bias toward free trade, the WTO’s scope is too narrow. Yet 
in its assiduous pursuit of universal free trade, the WTO is also seeking to ensure that global trade 
import substitu-
tion: a policy under-
taken by governments 
seeking to reduce re-
liance on imports and 
encourage domestic 
industry. These often 
include the use of 
industry subsidies as 
well as protectionist 
policies.

166 
CHAPTER 7 — INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND TRADE POLICY
is “fair.” In other words, to the extent that it can create a world free of trade restrictions, the WTO 
is “leveling the playing ﬁeld.” The goal is for no country to be able to display favoritism toward 
or discriminate against others by subjecting them to different tariff levels or quota restrictions.
Can the WTO so easily impose its will on other countries? Well, not exactly; it technically 
has no sovereignty over countries that wish to ignore its rulings. Yet the loser in a dispute 
almost always has strong reasons for abiding by the WTO’s decision. For one thing, the WTO 
considers it fair for the injured country to retaliate against its adversary if the latter ignores 
the judgment. So a country that wishes to breach WTO regulations must seriously consider 
the possibility of a trade war, in which each country keeps retaliating against the protectionist 
acts of the others, leading to escalating losses for both countries.
What if a country enjoys disproportionate economic power and therefore has little reason 
to fear retaliation? One might, for example, believe that the United States has the ability to 
impose tariffs on all (or at least most) imports from, say, Mozambique with impunity, because 
any attempted retaliation would likely just shift U.S. demand from Mozambique’s markets 
to those of its neighbors. Yet the United States also must be concerned with its international 
image. As a leading global advocate of free trade, it would probably suffer diminished 
goodwill from its allies if it were seen to be ﬂouting WTO rulings simply because it could. 
Consequently, trade dispute rulings from the WTO are almost always binding.
In addition to being members of the WTO, many countries have also entered into regional 
trade agreements with their neighbors. Leading examples of such attempts to integrate trade 
within a geographic area include the European Union (EU), formed in 1992, which now counts 
27 countries as members; the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), entered into in 
1994 by the United States, Canada, and Mexico; and Mercosur (Southern Cone Common Market) 
in South America, established in 1991, which now has ﬁve full members and ﬁve associate 
members. Although each of these regional agreements is unique regarding its speciﬁc policies, 
they all share a general commitment to reducing trade barriers such as tariffs or quotas.
There is some debate over whether such regional integration promotes “free trade” or 
retards it, because it promotes both trade expansion (within the region) and trade diversion 
(away from trade with other regions). To some degree, regional trade agreements have the 
same objective as the WTO—to lower tariffs and other barriers to trade. At the same time, 
these regional agreements can implicitly promote trade discrimination against countries 
outside the membership in any particular trade agreement.
4.3 WHY COUNTRIES FOLLOW PROTECTIONIST POLICIES
One very important reason that many policymakers have, historically, restricted trade is that 
they believe it is necessary to “protect” domestic industries and jobs from foreign competition. 
The United States, for example, still engages in protection of a variety of industries includ-
ing Southern cotton, Northwestern timber, and Midwestern sugar beets. Without government 
protection, these industries would lose market share to lower-cost foreign producers. Such 
adjustment to global competition can be very painful. When U.S. automakers began to lose 
out to foreign competition, for example, a swath of the Midwest became so economically 
depressed that it became known as the “rust belt.”
Sometimes protectionism is called a “beggar-thy-neighbor” approach, because each country 
is, in effect, trying to gain at the expense of other countries. Each country wants to raise its own 
production levels while simultaneously reducing the access of foreign producers to its market. 
Even after decades of trade negotiations—and encouragement by economists to “liberalize” their 
trade regimes—many countries continue to employ protectionist policies, at least of a modest, 
piecemeal sort. Although simple economic theory ignores the power differentials between 
countries and assumes that labor and capital resources can immediately and smoothly adjust to 
new patterns of commerce, in real life things can be quite different. Trade relations continue to 
be an arena in which countries try to exert dominance over one another. Policymakers continue 

 
GLOBALIZATION AND POLICY 
167
to be concerned about the job losses and industrial dislocations that global competition can 
cause. Policies to ease unemployment may help, but there is no sign that—at least in democratic 
countries—policymakers will completely abandon protectionist tendencies any time soon.
A particular weakness of Ricardo’s two-country, two-good model is that, like many 
economic models, it is a “static” model that does not take into account the passage of time. 
Patterns of comparative advantage can, after all, change. Should a country simply follow 
whatever comparative advantage it happens to have at a given time, or should it explore 
policies that might change its comparative advantage? If the country could end up better off 
in the long run by deliberately changing its mix of productive capabilities, it might achieve 
“dynamic efﬁciency” overall—that is, efﬁciency-based welfare gains over a sustained period 
of years—even if “static efﬁciency” is sacriﬁced over the short run.
In fact, many countries that have achieved high rates of industrialization—including the United 
States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and South Korea—did so by erecting substantial tariff barriers. 
If these countries had maintained their natural comparative advantages as they had existed in the 
past, the United States might still be known mostly for its production of wheat and raw cotton and 
the UK for its wool, while South Korea and Japan would still import all their cars. Policies that 
excluded foreign imports of manufactured textiles or automotive parts helped these countries to 
shift their economies away from less-processed goods toward a more industrial economic base. 
Now they all compete in global markets for sophisticated manufactured goods.
The infant industry argument claims that sometimes governments should “protect” domestic 
industries from foreign competition until they become better able to compete on world markets. 
Usually, the government subsidizes the industry or places tariffs or quotas on imports of the 
good. Many industrializing countries have engaged in such import substitution policies in 
attempts to diversify their (earlier, often agriculture- or mining-based) economies. Sometimes, 
an entire package of industry-promoting policies is referred to as “industrial policy,” and the 
goal is stated as the creation of a superior “dynamic comparative advantage.”
The downside of deliberate, comparative-advantage-shifting industrial policy is that current 
potential “gains from trade” are sacriﬁced. The upside is that, over the long run, the country 
might be able to increase its national productivity and competitiveness and thus avoid getting 
locked into a disadvantageous pattern of production and trade.
Whether the gains from protectionist policies outweigh their costs is a matter of dispute. 
Many analysts point to long-term government protection of persistently high-cost production 
in India and some countries in Latin America as evidence that, once started, infant-industry 
policies tend to serve political special interests, rather than the interests of rational economic 
development. However, many economic historians point out that, into the early twentieth 
century, industries in France, Germany, the UK, and the United States all developed by 
erecting stiff tariff protection. These early industrializing countries bought raw materials 
from colonized or previously colonized areas, while refusing, as also noted earlier, to open 
their markets to imports of many manufactured goods. Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea are 
more recent examples of countries in which some varieties of protectionist policies were 
important in the history of their industrial development.
But even an advanced industrialized economy can become too specialized, which can 
sometimes lead to an unhealthy dependence on other countries for important goods like 
food and energy. Japan, for example, at the forefront when it comes to electronics and other 
manufactured goods, is heavily dependent on food imports, which could make the country 
vulnerable in the event of a war or other disruption in trade. Japan has long used quotas and 
tariffs to limit rice imports, providing protection for its domestic rice producers. Energy 
security is another important concern. In recent years, the United States has been pushing, 
through the use of generous subsidies to domestic producers, to develop alternatives to 
petroleum—most notably natural gas, with the attendant controversy over the manner in 
which it is extracted. Developers of renewable energy like solar and wind power have also

industry that is not 
yet globally competi-
tive, but receives gov-
ernment support with 
the expectation that it 
may become so

168 
CHAPTER 7 — INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND TRADE POLICY
been receiving subsidies, albeit at a smaller scale. The goal of U.S policymakers is reduce 
dependence on petroleum imports from other countries.
Another important reason that some countries engage in protectionism is perceived lack of 
“fairness” by trading partners. Companies that are not required by their governments to abide 
by certain labor, safety, or environmental laws or regulations receive an indirect subsidy in 
that they face lower production costs, ceteris paribus, than foreign competitors. So we can 
say, for example, that clothing made in countries that are hostile to labor unions are likely 
to be priced more competitively than clothing made in countries where workers enjoy more 
rights and beneﬁts (which tend to be more costly to employers). It is a “fairness” issue in that 
countries that observe higher standards believe themselves to be unjustly penalized.
One way in which countries can try to avoid such a “race to the bottom” is to ban both the 
domestic manufacture and importation of goods that are considered hazardous to consumers, 
have been made under labor standards considered inhumane, or were made using production 
processes that cause serious damage to the environment. In this way, at least the domestic 
market is reserved for producers who follow higher standards. The setting of standards 
may also encourage potential trading partners to raise their environmental, labor, or safety 
standards, so that their goods can be admitted.
At the same time, setting standards may provoke strong resistance. For example, in 1994, 
the United States sought to ban tuna imports from Mexico, an act generally prohibited by the 
GATT. Its claim was based on its higher environmental standards: The United States accused 
Mexico of using nets that tended to inadvertently catch and drown dolphins—nets that were 
also much cheaper to use than “dolphin-friendly” nets. Mexico appealed to the GATT, which 
ruled in its favor and required the United States to lift the ban. Since then, numerous other 
instances of protectionism have occurred on the basis of asymmetric (unequal) standards for, 
among other things, labor, the environment, safety, and health.
Another justiﬁcation for protectionism, mentioned earlier, is the need for government revenue. 
This has without a doubt been one of the greatest motivators for such policies over the years, 
speciﬁcally in the case of tariffs. Until 1913, for example, the United States had no income 
tax, and the federal government relied heavily on tariffs to run its operations. Of course, this is 
no longer the case, as the U.S. federal government today obtains a tiny fraction of its revenue 
from import tariffs. Yet in many poor countries, it is, even today, very difﬁcult to collect taxes 
on income and property. People may be spread over wide areas, and much of the economy 
may not be monetized. Because tariffs are taxes on monetized transactions at harbor facilities 
or airports, they are, as a rule, relatively easy to collect. Tariffs can therefore be an important 
source of revenue for health, education, defense, and other government activities.
4.4 WHEN IS LIMITING TRADE “UNFAIR”?
When should a restriction on trade be considered legitimate, and when should it not be? 
This complicated question is a topic of vigorous, ongoing debate. Most countries staunchly 
defend their right to restrict trade for purposes such as military security or consumer safety, 
so international trade agreements tend to stop short of banning all restrictions.
But beyond agreement on a few principles, debates become heated. Consider three 
examples.
GMO Products. The EU has banned the importation of products containing genetically 
modiﬁed organisms (GMO), on grounds that they present a threat to public health and the 
environment. The United States and other grain-producing countries have contested this at the 
WTO, arguing that GMO products are safe and the real reason for the ban is that the EU simply 
wants to protect its farmers. The WTO ultimately ruled that the ban was illegal, a ruling entirely 
consistent with its pro–free trade bias. But the ruling has only intensiﬁed the debate.
Dumping. The United States has accused China of subsidizing the production of many 
of its products and dumping them on the U.S. market. “Dumping,” the selling of products 
dumping: selling 
products at prices 
that are below the 
cost of production

 
GLOBALIZATION AND POLICY 
169
on foreign markets at prices that are unfairly low (that is, below the cost of production), 
is forbidden in international agreements. The United States argues that it has the right to 
retaliate by levying quotas and tariffs on Chinese goods. But China, of course, can argue 
that it simply is blessed with a low-cost production environment and that the United States 
is engaging in protectionism.
Labor Standards. In some extreme cases, such as the use of slave labor, restrictions on trade 
are usually considered permissible. But should countries be allowed to use trade restrictions to 
punish unfair labor practices? Some poorer countries have accused richer countries of imposing 
unreasonably high labor standards. Under the pretext of trying to protect global workers, they 
say, the richer countries are just trying to protect their workers from fair competition. But the 
lack of such standards can have disastrous consequences, for example, the death of hundreds 
of workers in Bangladesh in factory ﬁres and building collapses (see Box 7.3).
Questions of what will be ruled “fair” or “unfair” by the WTO—and whether such rulings 
can be enforced—often come down to questions of political economy. Large, powerful 
countries and corporations use the WTO negotiations and dispute resolution mechanisms as 
ways to advance their own interests. Smaller and less powerful groups have a more difﬁcult 
time having their voices heard. Many labor, environmental, and social justice groups, for 
example, charge that the WTO primarily serves the interests of powerful multinational 
corporations. They worry that WTO negotiations have served to speed up the “race to the 
bottom” and have reduced national sovereignty. Observers concerned about economic 
development believe that WTO rules disadvantage countries that are still relatively poor, 
by forbidding the use of the sorts of industrial policies that helped other countries achieve 
economic growth at an earlier time. In other words, in its zeal to support the elimination 
or reduction of trade restrictions, the WTO appears to be forgetting the economic path that 
today’s wealthier countries followed during their own rise.
In 2001, the WTO ofﬁcially launched the Doha Round of negotiations (also ofﬁcially 
called the Doha Development Agenda), which was, in its ofﬁcial statements, intended to 
take into account the needs and interests of poorer countries. Now, even a dozen years later, 
the Doha Round remains at an impasse. Many poorer countries pushed for richer countries 
to reduce their tariffs and subsidies, particularly on agricultural goods. At the same time, top 
priorities for richer countries included persuading poorer countries to open their service sector 
BOX 7.3 LABOR STANDARDS, TRAGEDY, AND REFORM IN BANGLADESH
The Rana Plaza complex was built on swampy ground 
outside Dhaka, Bangladesh. Code violations included 
the building of several illegal ﬂoors. The building’s 
collapse on April 24, 2013, ranked among the world’s 
worst industrial accidents, killing more than a thousand 
garment workers. A ﬁre at another garment factory in 
Bangladesh the previous year killed 112 people.
Low wages in Bangladesh, along with tax conces-
sions offered by Western countries, have helped turn 
the country’s garment sector into its largest employ-
ment generator. Annual exports from the sector are 
worth $21 billion, with 60 percent of these exports 
going to Europe. After the recent industrial accidents, 
the European Union, which gives preferential access 
to the Bangladeshi garment industry, threatened pu-
nitive measures if worker safety standards were not 
improved.
In July 2013, Bangladesh approved a new labor 
law to boost worker rights, including the freedom 
to form trade unions. The legislation puts in place 
provisions including a central fund to improve living 
standards of workers, a requirement for 5 percent of 
annual proﬁts to be deposited in employee welfare 
funds, and an assurance that union members will not 
be transferred to another factory of the same owner 
after labor unrest.
The legislation is seen as a crucial step toward curb-
ing rising cases of exploitation in a country with 4 million 
garment factory workers. But activists said it failed to 
address several concerns and blamed the government 
for enacting the law in a hurry to please foreigners.

(including banking and airline transportation) to foreign companies and to abide by stricter 
rules on intellectual property (e.g., to stop making less expensive versions of patented drugs). 
Because the wealthier countries showed little willingness to reduce protection of their domestic 
agricultural industries, Doha Round talks were suspended in July 2006. Negotiations again 
broke down in 2008, and since then no notable progress has been made to restart them.
Discussion Questions
1. What international trade issues have been in the news recently? What views are presented 
by different interest groups in trade debates? Are there any issues that particularly affect 
your community?
2. Debates between advocates of “free trade” and advocates of “protectionism” have gone on 
for hundreds of years. How aware are you of current debates, which are now often framed 
in terms of pro- and anti-“globalization”? Do you have more sympathy for one side than 
for the other? What do you think you need to know more about—in terms of theories or 
real-world facts—to be able to decide with conﬁdence whether increased world trade, in 
a speciﬁc situation, is a good idea?
5. CONCLUSION
We have seen that the observations made by Adam Smith and David Ricardo in support of free 
trade have an almost unassailable logic based on economic efﬁciency. And one could argue that 
their logic has been borne out in practice, because much of what they observed two centuries 
ago has since played out at a much greater scale. Yet if there is a lesson in our experience with 
trade, it is that theory often does not account for what practice later reveals.
The world was a much simpler place during the time of Smith and Ricardo. Large 
multinational corporations did not yet exist for the most part, and businesses could not readily 
pick up and migrate to another country if they found conditions more favorable there. Indeed, in 
those days such actions might even have been considered treasonous. The simple comparative 
advantage model discussed earlier was more suited to the relatively simple world that existed 
during that time. The far greater complexity in today’s world is much more difﬁcult—if not 
impossible—to capture in a simpliﬁed model.
This is a good time to remind ourselves once again that models best serve us as 
simpliﬁcations of reality that grant us some basic insight into the functioning of real-world 
systems. The original insights about the advantages of free trade—that is, that it can be of 
substantial beneﬁt to both parties to an exchange—appear no more contestable today than 
during Smith and Ricardo’s time. Yet beyond this important insight, numerous complicating 
factors should cause us to be cautious in interpreting the model.
Here we brieﬂy list and review three such factors, though the list is far from exhaustive. 
First, as noted above, the logic of unfettered free trade does not account for the fact that 
today capital can easily migrate across borders. What this means is that countries do not 
have to conform to mutually beneﬁcial exchange. Recalling an earlier example, let us assume 
that the United States has a comparative disadvantage in clothing production compared to 
Bangladesh. Instead of trading with Bangladesh, U.S companies today can move there and 
hire local workers—at a relatively low wage—to produce clothes for global markets. Easy 
capital mobility could, in such cases, reduce opportunities for mutually beneﬁcial trade.
Second, in Smith and Ricardo’s time, the economic landscape consisted of only about a 
dozen economic powers at a more or less similar level of development. The “playing ﬁeld” 
was, in other words, more or less level. Today, because former colonies have achieved political 
independence over the past 50 to 60 years, the world is far more imbalanced. One danger 
facing poor countries today is that they will follow the “logic” of comparative advantage 
and continue to specialize in simple primary goods that offer them scant hope of someday 
becoming stronger, more diversiﬁed economies.

 
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
171
Third, there is the role of the WTO. It might appear that Smith and Ricardo would have 
supported an agency empowered to promote global free trade. Yet because inequality between 
countries is so much greater today than it was then, it seems increasingly doubtful, the 
WTO’s mission notwithstanding, that today’s brand of “free trade”—meaning a wholesale 
dismantling of protectionist policies—is always mutually beneﬁcial. It is indeed quite possible 
that by making it more difﬁcult for developing countries to actively nurture their ﬂedgling 
industries, some WTO policies may worsen inequality around the world. This is especially 
true because more powerful countries can often win exceptions to the rule for their products 
in certain areas, notably agriculture.
Perhaps the greatest controversy exists over asymmetric “standards”—whether motivated 
by labor, environmental, safety, or other concerns. There is no question that rigid adherence 
to, say, labor standards might result in trade restrictions against countries that do not place 
a high priority on workers’ rights. For this reason alone, the WTO is likely to disallow their 
use as a basis for blocking trade, except in extreme cases such as child or slave labor. Yet 
such a case vividly illustrates how in some cases the “gains from trade” might mask social 
or environmental losses resulting from the “race to the bottom” that the WTO’s pro-trade 
policies might foster.
The question arises as to how to balance the “gains” to importers and consumers against the 
potential losses to workers, domestic industry, and the environment. And, again, although economics 
can provide some concepts and methods to use in reaching for answers, important decisions in 
these areas often require ethical judgments that go beyond the discipline of economics.

 1. Hereland and Thereland are two small countries. 
Each currently produces both milk and corn, and 
they do not trade. If Hereland puts all its resources 
into milk, it can produce 2 tanker truckloads, while 
if it puts all its resources in corn production, it 
can produce 8 tons. Thereland can produce either 
2 loads of milk or 2 tons of corn. (Both can also 
produce any combination on a straight line in 
between.)

g. Create a table similar to Table 7.1, showing how 
Hereland and Thereland could enter into a trad-

consumption desires as described in (b) and (c).
h. Suppose that you are an analyst working for the 
government of Hereland. Write a few sentences, 
based on the above analysis, advising your boss 
about whether to undertake trade negotiations 
with Thereland.
i. Would your advice change if you knew that 
unemployment in Hereland is high and that 
retraining corn farmers to be dairy farmers, or 
vice versa, is very difﬁcult to do?
j. Would your advice change if Thereland insisted 
in trade negotiations that 1 truckload of milk be 
exchanged for exactly 4 tons of corn?
 2. Continuing the Ricardian story from Section 2.1 
of this chapter, suppose that England were, after a 
while, to put a tariff on imports of Portuguese wine. 
Since we only have wine and cloth in this story, we 
will have to (somewhat unrealistically) express this 
tax in terms of units of goods rather than units of 
currency. Say that England demands that Portugal 
“pay a tariff of 40 units of cloth” if it wants to sell 
100 units of wine. Or, in other words, England now 
says that it will give Portugal only 60 units of cloth 
instead of 100, in exchange for 100 units of wine.
a. With production unchanged, what would exchange 
and consumption be like under these modiﬁed 
terms of trade? (Create a table like Table 7.1.)
b. Does England beneﬁt from instituting this tariff?
c. Would Portugal voluntarily agree to continue 
trading, with these changed terms of trade? (As-
sume that Portugal has no power to change the 
terms of trade—it can only accept England’s deal 
or go back to consuming within its own PPF.)
d. If trade is voluntary, does that mean it is fair?

APPENDIX: A FORMAL THEORY OF GAINS FROM TRADE
Here we explore in more detail the “gains from trade” example given in the text. There, for 
simplicity, we explored a case in which both countries completely specialize, because their 
level of desired total consumption just happens to match each country’s total production 
level with complete specialization. Graphing a joint PPF for the two countries enables us to 
relax this assumption, while also exploring more fully the concepts of opportunity costs and 
comparative advantage.
Recall that in this example, Portugal can produce a maximum of either 200 bottles of wine 
or 100 bolts of cloth. Portugal’s PPF was shown in Figure 7.1. Examining its slope more 
closely reveals that, moving left to right starting at the (0, 200) point, a fall (or negative “rise”) 
of 200 bottles of wine is accompanied by a “run” of +100 bolts of cloth. Because the curve 
is straight, the slope is therefore –2 throughout. At any point, then, reducing wine production 
by 2 bottles (i.e., a negative “rise” of 2) is needed to increase cloth production by 1 bolt (i.e., 
to create a “run” of 1 unit to the right).
England can produce a maximum of 200 bottles of wine or 400 bolts of cloth, as was shown 
in Figure 7.2. The slope of its production possibilities frontier is –0.5 (= –200/400). For each 
additional bolt of cloth, England gives up producing half a bottle of wine.
In Figure 7.3, we create a joint PPF for the two countries. Suppose that they both start out 
producing only wine. Adding Portugal’s 200 bottles to England’s 200 bottles, we ﬁnd that 
jointly they can produce 400 bottles if they produce no cloth, as shown at the point (0, 400). 
Now suppose that they would like to consume some cloth, and they make a joint decision about 
where it should be produced. They see that if Portugal produces the ﬁrst bolt of cloth, it will cost 
them 2 bottles of wine. If England produces the ﬁrst bolt of cloth, it will cost them only half 
a bottle of wine. Clearly, England should produce it. This kind of reasoning will tell England 
to produce not only the ﬁrst bolt of cloth but also every succeeding bolt of cloth, as long as 
possible. Portugal will keep producing only wine, at its maximum level of 200 bottles.

By specializing efﬁciently, England 
and Portugal together can produce 
these combinations of wine and 
cloth.

CHAPTER 7 — INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND TRADE POLICY
The possibility of exploiting England’s relatively low-cost cloth production runs out when 
these two countries reach point A. At point A, England produces the maximum amount of 
cloth it can—400 bolts—and Portugal still produces only wine (200 bottles). This was the 
point used as an example in the text, for simplicity. Now if they want to continue to have even 
more cloth (and less wine), Portugal will have to produce it. Each extra bolt of cloth will now 
cost 2 bottles of wine, up to the point (500, 0), where they both produce only cloth.
What if, instead, the countries were to follow their comparative disadvantages, having 
Portugal change to cloth production ﬁrst, and England only after Portugal was producing 
at capacity? Figure 7.4 contrasts the efﬁcient PPF with this case. With inefﬁcient full 
specialization represented by the point where Portugal produces 100 bolts of cloth and 
England produces 200 bottles of wine, the PPF bends inward. The bold line is the efﬁcient 
production possibilities frontier, and the lighter line reﬂects the most inefﬁcient production 
choices. As you can see, following the rule of comparative advantage leads to a much larger 
PPF than doing the reverse! A similarly inefﬁcient result would follow if you were better 
at cleaning, and your housemate at shopping, but you tended to shop and your housemate 
tended to clean.

If England and Portugal specialized 
in an inefﬁcient way, the joint 
production possibilities frontier would 
bow in rather than out.
Along with the concept of comparative advantage, economists also discuss the concept of 
absolute advantage. A producer has an absolute advantage when, using the same amount of 
some resource as another producer, it can produce more. Usually, labor hours are the resource 
considered. For example, suppose that in a one-hour period you can buy enough groceries for 
six days or clean three rooms. Your housemate, by contrast, moves more slowly and can buy 
enough groceries for only three days, or clean only one room, in an hour. You clearly have 
an absolute advantage in production of both these services. Does this mean you should do all 
the work?* (See whether you can ﬁgure out the answer before looking at the footnote.)
*No. Comparative, not absolute, advantage should guide the assignment of tasks. Although you have an absolute advantage 
over your housemate in both activities, your housemate has a comparative advantage in shopping. That is, to get enough 
groceries for six days would “cost” only two rooms’ worth of cleaning if your housemate does it (taking two hours). But 
if you shop for six days’ worth of food, the opportunity cost is more—the three rooms you could have cleaned. Therefore, 
on efﬁciency grounds at least, your housemate should shop and you should clean. (You can also come to the same result by 
examining your own comparative advantage—in cleaning.)

Economic Behavior and Rationality
In Chapter 1, we deﬁned economic actors, or economic agents, as people or organizations 
engaged in any of the four essential economic activities: production, distribution, consump-
tion, and resource maintenance. Economic actors can be individuals, small groups (such as 
a family or a group of roommates), or large organizations such as a government agency or a 
multinational corporation. Economics is about how these actors behave and interact as they 
engage in economic activities. In this chapter we explore the behavior of individual economic 
actors—people. We look at contemporary research on this topic, and, where it seems relevant, 
compare this with older approaches.
1. ECONOMIC UNDERSTANDINGS OF HUMAN MOTIVATIONS
Economics is a social science—it is about people and about how we organize ourselves to meet 
our needs and enhance our well-being. Ultimately, all economic behavior is human behavior. 
Sometimes institutional forces appear to take over (witness the tendency of some bureaucracies 
to expand over time), but if you look closely at all economic outcomes, you will ﬁnd that they are 
ultimately determined by human decisions or behavior. Thus economists have traditionally used, 
as a starting point, some kind of statement about the motivations behind economic actions.
1.1 CLASSICAL ECONOMIC VIEWS OF HUMAN NATURE
In Chapter 6, we mentioned Adam Smith’s concept of the invisible hand, according to which 
people acting in their own self-interest would, through markets, promote the general welfare 
of society. The concept of the invisible hand has become very famous, but it is often taken 
out of context to mean that if people only behave with self-interest, they will do what is best 
for the entire society.
This interpretation would have astonished Smith, who, before writing An Inquiry into the 
Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, had written another long book, The Theory of 
Moral Sentiments, in which he examined with care how people are motivated. His emphasis 
there is on the desire of people to have self-respect and the respect of others. He assumes 
that such respect depends on people acting honorably, justly, and with concern and empathy 
for others in their community. Smith recognizes that selﬁsh desires play a large role but 
believes that they will be held in check both by the “moral sentiments” (the universal desire 
for self-respect and the respect of others) and also by the fortunate accident by which “in 
many cases” (not all!) selﬁsh acts can “promote the public interest.”1
Thus Smith’s vision of human nature and human motivation was one in which individual 
self-interest was mixed with more social motives. Rather than starting with Robinson Crusoe, 
who lived alone on an island, he perceived that the behavior of any one person always had 
to be understood within that person’s social context.

178 
CHAPTER 8 — ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR AND RATIONALITY
Smith was followed by other economists, such as the trade theorist David Ricardo and the 
philosopher/economist John Stuart Mill. These theorists of classical economics held similarly 
complex views of human nature and motivations. In 1890 Alfred Marshall tried to codify 
these ideas in a very inﬂuential text called Principles of Economics, which was published in 
eight editions, the last published in 1920. Marshall viewed the motives of human actors in 
an optimistic light—including those of economists, whom he assumed were motivated by a 
desire to improve the human condition. He speciﬁcally focused on the reduction of poverty 
so as to allow people to develop their higher moral and intellectual faculties, rather than being 
condemned to lives of desperate effort for simple survival.
1.2 THE NEOCLASSICAL MODEL
In the twentieth century, the approach that came to dominate economics was known as the 
neoclassical model. This approach took a narrower view of human motivations. The basic 
neoclassical or traditional model builds a simpliﬁed story about economic life by assuming 
that there are only two main types of economic actors and by making simplifying assump-
tions about how these two types of actors behave and interact. The two basic sets of actors 
in this model are ﬁrms, which are assumed to maximize their proﬁts from producing and 
selling goods and services, and households, which are assumed to maximize their utility (or 
satisfaction) from consuming goods and services. The two kinds of agents are assumed to 
interact in perfectly competitive markets (the subject of Chapter 17). Given some additional 
assumptions, explored later in this book, the model can be elegantly expressed in ﬁgures, 
equations, and graphs.
Some beneﬁts can be gained from looking at economic behavior in this way. The 
assumptions reduce the actual (very complicated) economy to something that is much more 
limited but also easier to analyze. The traditional model is particularly well suited for analyzing 
the determination of prices, the volume of trade, and efﬁciency issues in certain cases.
The neoclassical model was introduced to generations of students in 1948 with the 
publication of Paul Samuelson’s textbook Economics: An Introductory Analysis, which 
went on to become the best-selling economics text ever. Samuelson’s text promoted the idea 
that economics should be “value free” (i.e., it should be developed without reference to any 
human goals or values) and that it should be largely or purely deductive, meaning that it 
should derive conclusions from the simple assumptions stated above, about the motivations 
of market actors.
In addition to the claim of being value free, through the second half of the twentieth century, 
many economists used another belief to assert that their discipline was more scientiﬁc than 
other social sciences. They claimed that the entire system of economic theory is so purely 
deductive that everything in it can be deduced from one essential axiom.* This, the rationality 
axiom, states that “rational economic man maximizes his utility.” (Some economists substitute 
for “utility” another term such as “self-interest,” or “well-being.”) This statement has often 
been interpreted to mean that pursuit of self-interest is the only thing that is done by rational 
economic actors—and that anything else is irrational.
The statement that the subject of economics is “completely axiomatized” (i.e., everything 
in it can be deduced from this single basic axiom) has come under considerable criticism. To 
discuss that in depth, however, would be to get into issues of methodology that are beyond 
the scope of an introductory textbook. Instead of addressing these arcane matters, we describe 
some real-world tests that have been applied in recent years to a model of human behavior 
that states that all that economics needs to know about human behavior is that people are 
rational and self-interested. We return to the issue of selﬁshness in Section 3 of this chapter. 
Section 2 ﬁrst focuses on the assumption that people are rational in those portions of human 
neoclassical model:

the economy as a 
collection of proﬁt-
maximizing ﬁrms and 
utility-maximizing 
households interact-

behavior that are related to the economic activities of production, distribution, consumption, 
and resource maintenance.
Discussion Questions
1. Do you agree with the assumption of the neoclassical model that human behavior is 
rational and self-interested? Can you think of some examples of economic behavior that 
might contradict these assumptions?
2. Do you believe economics should strive, as much as possible, to be value free? What do 
you think are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach?
2. ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR
Recent economic theory has explored views of human nature and decision-making that go 
beyond the simple axioms of the basic neoclassical model. In this chapter, we examine other 
models of economic behavior that consider people’s (1) choice of goals, (2) the actions they 
take to achieve these goals, and (3) the limitations and inﬂuences that affect their choices 
and actions.
As we learned in Chapter 2, any model highlights some aspects of reality while ignoring 
others. In this case, we employ the term “model” to mean a description of human behavior 
that emphasizes what is most important to understand about how people act most of the time 
when engaging in economic activities. Such a model obviously cannot explain all human 
actions, but it should be sufﬁcient to provide a general outline of what to expect. We work 
our way gradually toward such a descriptive model.
2.1 BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS
In the past few decades, the neoclassical view of human behavior has been challenged by a 
strong alternative called behavioral economics, which studies how individuals and organiza-
tions make economic decisions. Studies in this area suggest that a more sophisticated model 
of human motivations is required to explain behaviors such as those that lead to stock market 
swings, the ways that people react to good and bad fortune, and why people often seem to 
act against their own self-interest.2
Rather than making assumptions about human behavior, behavioral economics relies 
heavily on scientiﬁc experiments to determine how people behave in different situations. 
Consider the insights from one such experiment, which concerns a three-hour seminar class 
that has a short break in the middle, when the professor offers the students a snack. Every 
week, the professor provides the students with a list of possible snacks, and the students vote 
on which snack they want. Only the snack with the most votes is then provided. The results 
of this experiment show that every week students tend to pick the same snack—the one that 
is their favorite.
With a different group of students, who are also taking a three-hour seminar class with a 
break, the students are instead asked in advance which snacks they will prefer for the next 
three weeks. In this case, students tend to vote for variety, thinking that they will not want the 
same snack every week. But this is precisely what students actually do want when they get to 
vote every week! When planning ahead, students think they will want variety, but when the 
time comes to consume a snack students tend to stick with their favorite each time. Similar 
experiments have shown that people who go grocery shopping infrequently also tend to think 
that they will want variety, but in reality they tend to want their favorite foods more often.
Another illustration of behavior that does not ﬁt older, rigid deﬁnitions of rationality 
concerns the way that we process information. Perhaps the most famous contemporary 
behavioral economist is not an economist by training. Despite being educated as a psychologist, 
Daniel Kahneman won the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in economic science. Kahneman’s 
behavioral eco-
nomics: a subﬁeld of 
microeconomics that 
studies how individu-
als and organizations 
make economic 
decisions

180 
CHAPTER 8 — ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR AND RATIONALITY
research has found that people tend to give undue weight to information that is easily available 
or vivid, something he called the availability heuristic. (“Heuristic” means a method for 
solving problems.) For example, suppose that college students are deciding which courses to 
take next semester, and they see a summary of evaluations from hundreds of other students 
indicating that a certain course is very good. Then suppose that they watch a video interview 
of just one student, who gives a negative review of the course. Even when students were told 
in advance that such a negative review was atypical, they tended to be more inﬂuenced by 
the vivid negative review than the summary of hundreds of evaluations, even though such 
behavior seems irrational.
Kahneman has also shown that the way a decision is presented to people can signiﬁcantly 
inﬂuence their choices, an effect he referred to as framing. For example, consider a gas station 
that advertises a special 5-cent-per-gallon discount for paying cash. Meanwhile, another station 
with the same prices indicates that they charge a 5-cent-per-gallon surcharge to customers 
who pay by credit card. Although the prices end up exactly the same, experiments suggest 
that consumers respond more favorably to the station that advertises the apparent discount. 
For one of Kahneman’s famous experiments on the importance of framing, see Box 8.1.
A common area of seemingly irrational economic behavior is personal ﬁnance. Some 
companies offer their employees the option of matching contributions to their retirement plans; 
for each $1 the employee voluntarily contributes to his or her retirement plan, the employer 
matches it with an additional contribution. For example, with a 50 percent matching program, 
for each $1 an employee contributes, the employer contributes 50 cents. This amounts to an 
instant 50 percent rate of return on the employee’s investment.
Although most ﬁnancial advisers suggest taking advantage of matching contributions, 
many employees do not enroll in such programs, voluntarily forgoing the opportunity to 
garner thousands of additional dollars for retirement. This is not necessarily irrational, as 
some employees may have pressing current economic needs. However, one research study 
availability heu-
ristic: placing undue 
importance on par-
ticular information 
because it is readily 
available or vivid
framing: changing the 
way a particular deci-
sion is presented to 
people in order to in-
ﬂuence their behavior
BOX 8.1 THE EFFECT OF FRAMING ON DECISIONS
Suppose that you are presented with the following 
question:
Imagine you are a physician working in an Asian 
village, and 600 people have come down with a 
life-threatening disease. Two possible treatments 
exist. If you choose treatment A, you will save ex-
actly 200 people. If you choose treatment B, there 
is a one-third chance that you will save all 600 
people, and a two-thirds chance you will save no 
one. Which treatment do you choose, A or B?
Kahneman and Tversky found that the majority of 
respondents (72 percent) chose treatment A, which 
saves exactly 200 people. Now consider the follow-
ing scenario:
You are a physician working in an Asian village, 
and 600 people have come down with a life-
threatening disease. Two possible treatments exist. 
If you choose treatment C, exactly 400 people will 
die. If you choose treatment D, there is a one-third 
chance that no one will die, and a two-thirds 
chance that everyone will die. Which treatment do 
you choose, C or D?
In this case, they found that the majority of respon-
dents (78 percent) chose treatment D, which offers 
a one-third chance that no one will die. But if you 
compare the two questions carefully, you will notice 
that they are exactly the same! Treatments A and C 
are identical, and so are treatments B and D. The 
only thing that changes are the way the options are 
presented, or framed, to respondents.
According to Tversky and Kahneman people evalu-
ate gains and losses differently. Thus while treatments A 
and C are quantitatively identical, treatment A is framed 
as a gain (i.e., you save 200 people) while treatment 
C is framed as a loss (i.e., 400 people die). It seems 
people are more likely to take risks when it comes to 
losses than gains. In other words, people prefer a “sure 
thing” when it comes to a potential gain but are willing 
to take a chance if it involves avoiding a loss.

ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR 
181
looked at what happened when a large company changed its policy from a matching program 
that required employees to sign up for it (an “opt in” program) to a similar program in which 
employees were automatically enrolled but could opt out if they wanted to.3 Under the new 
(opt-out) program, 86 percent of employees stayed in the program. For comparable employees 
prior to the change, the participation rate was only 37 percent. The economic advantages were 
the same in either case, and the huge difference in participation rates is difﬁcult to justify on 
the basis of the paperwork needed to sign up for the program. Again, the results demonstrate 
that framing can have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on people’s choices.
An effect similar to framing is known as anchoring, in which people rely on a piece of 
information that is not necessarily relevant as a reference point in making a decision. In one 
powerful example, graduate students at the MIT Sloan School of Management were ﬁrst 
asked to write down the last two digits of their Social Security numbers.4 They were then 
asked whether they would pay this amount, in dollars, for various products, including a fancy 
bottle of wine and a cordless keyboard. Assuming rational behavior, the last digits of one’s 
Social Security number should have no relation to one’s willingness to pay for a product. 
However, the subjects with the highest Social Security numbers indicated a willingness to 
pay about 300 percent more than those with the lowest numbers; apparently they used their 
Social Security numbers as an “anchor” in evaluating the worth of the products.
In a real-world example of anchoring, a high-end kitchen equipment catalog featured a 
particular bread maker for $279. Sometime later, the company began offering a “deluxe” 
model for $429. Although they did not sell too many of the deluxe model, sales of the $279 
model almost doubled because now it seemed like a relative bargain.
2.2 THE ROLE OF TIME IN ECONOMIC DECISIONS
The retirement program example cited above suggests that in making their decisions people 
might not appropriately weigh the future. In other words, people seem to place undue emphasis 
on gains or beneﬁts received today without considering the implications of their decisions 
for the future. Further evidence of this is the large number of people who have acquired 
signiﬁcant high-interest credit card debt; indeed, about 6 percent of Americans are consid-
ered “compulsive shoppers,” who seek instant gratiﬁcation with little concern for often very 
troublesome consequences of running up a great deal of debt.5 But you do not need to be a 
compulsive shopper to fall short of the ideal “rational consumer” who knows and weighs all 
the relevant costs and beneﬁts.
You may know someone who does not pay much attention to the future consequences 
of his or her actions. Economists would say that this person has a very high time discount 
rate, meaning that in his or her mind, future events are very much discounted or diminished 
when weighed against the pleasures of today. (The technical meaning of “discount rate” is 
discussed in Chapter 13.)
On the other hand you might also know people who seem to have the attitude “I’ve got 
to work hard and prepare now; enjoying myself will have to wait for later.” Economists 
would say that people like this have low time discount rates if by their current work they 
are gaining beneﬁts for tomorrow. The later beneﬁts loom large (i.e., are not “discounted”) 
in their decisions.
Time discount rates are important in all sorts of situations. Economists usually assume that 
people who invest in a college education have a relatively low time discount rate, because 
they are willing to forgo current income or relaxation to study for some expected future gain. 
(Of course, this is not true for individuals who enjoy college or regard it as more appealing 
than the prospects for postcollege experience.)
Company leaders with high time discount rates may concentrate on making this quarter’s 
ﬁnancial statement look good, whereas those with more concern about the future will look 
toward longer-term goals. In deciding on environmental regulations, people who work at 
anchoring effect: 
overreliance on a 
piece of information 
that may or may not 
be relevant as a ref-
erence point when 
making a decision
time discount rate: 
an economic concept 
describing the relative 
weighting of pres-
ent beneﬁts or costs 
compared to future 
beneﬁts or costs

182 
CHAPTER 8 — ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR AND RATIONALITY
government agencies are forced to make decisions about how much weight to give the well-
being of future generations. The lower their discount rate, the more important safeguarding 
the well-being of future generations appears.
2.3 THE ROLE OF EMOTIONS IN ECONOMIC DECISIONS
The potential conﬂict between our reasoning and our emotions has long been studied by phi-
losophers and writers. The conventional view is that emotions get in the way of good decision 
making, as they tend to interfere with logical reasoning. The American author Marya Mannes 
once wrote: “The sign of an intelligent people is their ability to control their emotions by the 
application of reason.” This implies that excessive reliance on emotions to make economic 
decisions could result in irrational behavior.
But again, research from behavioral economics suggests a more nuanced reality. It does 
not seem to be true that decisions based on logical reasoning are always “better” than those 
based on emotion or intuition. Instead, studies suggest that reasoning is most effective when 
used for making relatively simple economic decisions, but for more complex decisions we 
can become overwhelmed by too much information.
The 2010 book Predictably Irrational, by the psychologist Dan Ariely, describes how people 
consistently tend to procrastinate, overpay in certain situations, and fail to understand the 
role of emotions in our decision making. The book also reveals that we often place an above-
market value on what we possess because we are “irrationally” attached to our possessions 
and that we use price as a “signal” in selecting among medicines, to the point that the placebo 
effect is stronger for more expensive drugs.
Research by Ap Dijksterhuis, a psychologist in the Netherlands, has shed some valuable 
insight on the limits of reasoned decision making. In one experiment, he and his colleagues 
surveyed shoppers about their purchases as they were leaving stores, asking them how much 
they had thought about items before buying them. A few weeks later, they asked these same 
consumers how satisﬁed they were with their purchases. For relatively simple products, like 
small kitchen tools or clothing accessories, those who thought more about their purchases 
tended to be more satisﬁed, as we might suspect. But for complex products, such as furniture, 
those people who deliberated the most tended to be less satisﬁed with their purchases. 
Dijksterhuis and his colleagues conclude:
Contrary to conventional wisdom, it is not always advantageous to engage in thorough 
conscious deliberation before choosing. On the basis of recent insights into the 
characteristics of conscious and unconscious thought, we [ﬁnd] that purchases of 
complex products were viewed more favorably when decisions had been made in the 
absence of attentive deliberation.6
Even for relatively simple decisions, there is such a thing as “thinking too much.” Another 
experiment with college students involved their tasting ﬁve brands of strawberry jam.7 In one 
case, students simply ranked the jams from best to worst. The student rankings were highly 
correlated with the results of independent testing by Consumer Reports, suggesting that the 
students’ rankings were reasonable. But in another case students were asked to ﬁll out a 
written questionnaire explaining their preferences. As a result of the additional deliberation, 
students’ rankings were no longer signiﬁcantly correlated with the Consumer Report rankings. 
The researcher concluded:
This experiment illuminates the danger of always relying on the rational brain. There 
is such a thing as too much analysis. When you overthink at the wrong moment, you 
cut yourself off from the wisdom of your emotions, which are much better at assessing 
actual preferences. You lose the ability to know what you really want.8 

 
ECONOMIC RATIONALITY 
183
Discussion Questions
1. Why do you think economists are so interested in questions of how decisions are made?
2. Discuss how one or more conclusions reached by behavioral economists helps you to 
understand an experience that you have had.
3. ECONOMIC RATIONALITY
“Rationality” has become a loaded word in economics, bringing with it the baggage of earlier 
models that did not anticipate the ﬁndings of behavioral economics or take into account other 
everyday observations. In this section we formulate an alternative view of human behavior 
that is more realistic.
3.1 CHOOSING GOALS AND TRYING TO ACHIEVE THEM
Economists generally proceed from a belief that people should be free to choose their own 
goals, even if their chosen goals differ from those of most others. However, what can be 
considered a rational goal has limits, especially considering that people usually have more 
than one ﬁnal goal. Some goals that people pursue may be unachievable. People may also 
choose reasonable goals, but engage in irrational behavior that leads them away from their 
achievement rather than toward it. A reasonable deﬁnition of rational behavior includes (1) 
selecting goals that are consistent with present and future well-being, and (2) pursuing the 
goals in a manner that can reasonably be assumed to lead to their achievement.
3.2 THE ROLE OF CONSTRAINTS AND INFORMATION
It is important to note that economic decisions are always made subject to constraints, in-
cluding limits on income and other resources and on physical or intellectual capacities. A 
universal constraint is time. Every day you face the choice of how to allocate 24 hours among 
competing activities such as sleeping, studying, going to class, eating, and entertainment. 
You cannot decide to allocate 10 hours each day to sleeping, 5 hours to studying, and 10 
hours to hanging out with friends because you do not have 25 hours available. To put this in 
terms that we introduced in Chapter 1, your “production possibilities frontier” has only 24 
hours per day.
Another important factor in an economic model of rationality is information. In assessing 
their options, economic actors make use of their existing knowledge but often need to collect 
additional information. Consider the decision to purchase a new automobile. Numerous 
factors go into such a decision. Should you buy a new car or a used one? What is the 
relative importance of fuel economy, safety, and luxury features? What about resale value 
and maintenance costs? Making a rational decision requires that you obtain information on 
these various factors.
The neoclassical approach tends to assume that rational behavior is optimizing behavior, 
based on the further assumption that rational economic actors have “perfect information.” 
A slightly more modest version says that people will collect information until the perceived 
costs of acquiring additional information exceed the perceived beneﬁts. However, there 
is no way of guaranteeing either that people can know enough to make that “cost/beneﬁt” 
calculation (i.e., to make an informed decision about when to stop gathering information) or 
that, when they do stop gathering information, they will know enough to make an optimal 
or even a good choice.*
One challenge to the traditional assumption of rationality comes from Herbert Simon, 
another psychologist who received a Nobel Memorial Prize in economic science (in 1978). 
Considering the matter of whether it is indeed possible for people to identify the optimal

ior: behavior that

outcome

184 
CHAPTER 8 — ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR AND RATIONALITY
point at which one should cease gathering additional information, Simon logically showed 
that, in fact, one ﬁrst needs to have complete knowledge of all choices in order to identify 
that optimal point! Moreover, determining what additional information might be out there 
and then gathering it can be very costly in time, effort, and money. Accordingly, Simon 
maintained, people rarely optimize. Instead they do what he called satisﬁcing; they choose 
an outcome that would be satisfactory and then seek an option that at least reaches that 
standard.
Given constraints of time and so forth, satisﬁcing seems to be a reasonable behavior. If 
an individual ﬁnds that the “satisfactory” level was set too low, a search for options that 
meet that level will result in a solution more quickly than expected or perhaps even multiple 
solutions. In this case, the level may then be adjusted to a higher standard. Conversely, if the 
level is set too high, a long search will yield nothing, and the “satisﬁcer” may lower his or 
her expectations for the outcome.
Another deviation from rational behavior as traditionally defined has been called 
meliorating—deﬁned as starting from the present level of well-being and then taking any 
opportunity to do better. A simple example is a line ﬁsherman who has found a whole school 
of haddock but wants to keep only one for his supper. When he catches the second ﬁsh, he 
compares it to the ﬁrst one, keeps the larger, and releases the other. Each subsequent catch 
is compared to the one held in the bottom of the boat. At the end of the day, the ﬁsh that he 
takes home will be the largest of all those caught.
One result of using melioration as the real-world substitute for theoretical optimization is 
its implication that history matters: People view each successive choice in relation to their 
previous experience. It is commonly observed, for example, that people are reluctant to 
accept a situation that they perceive as inferior to previous situations. This psychological path 
dependence—the idea that where you are going depends on where you have been—is relevant 
to feelings about rising prices and even more so to attitudes about declining wages.
Satisﬁcing and meliorating may both be included under the term bounded rationality. The 
general idea is that, instead of considering all possible options, people limit their attention to 
some more-or-less arbitrarily deﬁned subset of the universe of possibilities. With satisﬁcing 
or meliorating behavior, people may not choose the “best” choices available to them, but 
they at least make decisions that move them toward their goals.
3.3 THE ROLE OF INFLUENCE
The discussion above cautions that in modeling human behavior, it is necessary to recognize 
that there is no known decision rule within human capabilities that guarantees an entirely 
satisfactory conclusion, let alone the “best of all possible” conclusions.
A very important aspect of decision making relates to the outside inﬂuences on us. In the 
discussion of behavioral economics, we saw examples of ways that others can affect our 
decisions by setting a “frame” or providing extra emphasis on one conclusion at the expense 
of others. Available information is, of course, a critical feature, and actors other than the 
decision maker may have a strong inﬂuence on which information is available. The literature 
in behavioral economics provides a wide array of other ways that decision making can be 
distorted by inﬂuences not related to the goals of the particular actor.
These realities have long been well known to politicians and advertisers, who, since the 
early part of the twentieth century, have often based their successes on assuming irrational 
consumers and voters. For example, food companies are well known to cater to the innate 
physical preference for sugar, fat, and salt. These three elements are crucial for health when 
eaten in appropriate amounts, but they were rarely available in sufﬁcient quantity during 
most of human evolution. We are all therefore born with some degree of craving for these 
substances; learning is required to recognize when we have had “enough.” Makers of potato 
chips and other sweet, salty, fatty, prepared foods would prefer that this learning not take 
satisﬁce: to choose 
an outcome that 
would be satisfac-
tory and then seek an 
option that at least 
reaches that standard

place. And just as corporations gravitate toward behavior that fattens proﬁts, even if their 
products do more harm than good, politicians also often ﬁnd it hard to resist the easy appeal 
to emotions of greed, even fear, rather than offering sound information on which voters can 
make good decisions.
As we go through this book, applying microeconomic principles to different issues, we 
continue to explore whether economic actors are making rational decisions and whether there 
are policies that could encourage decisions that enhance both individual well-being and the 
well-being of society.
3.4 SELF-INTEREST, ALTRUISM, AND THE COMMON GOOD
We have referred to the neoclassical model of economic behavior that is deduced from 
the axiom: “Rational economic man acts so as to maximize his utility.” This could be—
and often has been—interpreted by teachers, students, and practitioners of economics 
to mean: “Rational people try to get what they want.” That in turn was often understood 
as saying, “Rational people are only self-interested—any non-self-interested acts are 
irrational.”
Many students found this approach so unappealing that they dropped economics as their 
major, while others who stayed with these courses more or less bought in to the lesson 
that “Only self-interested behavior is rational.” This probably explains a good deal of why 
economics students (and economics faculty) have frequently been shown, in tests, to be less 
altruistic than others (see Box 8.2).
The opposite of pure self-interest is altruism, which means a concern for the well-being 
of others, with no thought about oneself. Although it would be excessively idealistic to 
assume that altruism is the prime mover in human behavior, it is reasonable to assert that 
some elements of altruism enter into most people’s decision making—contrary to the simple 
neoclassical model of “rational” selﬁshness.
BOX 8.2  ECONOMICS AND SELFISHNESS
Are people who have studied economics more likely 
than other individuals to behave selﬁshly? For more 
than 30 years, various research studies have explored 
this question. In one example, economics students 
expressed a lower willingness than other students to 
contribute money to pay for public goods. The same 
was found of economics faculty, though their average 
pay was higher than that of the faculty in the other 
disciplines to which they were compared. 
Another study found that economics students offered 
less to others in the Ultimatum Game (see Box 8.3 for 
a description of the Ultimatum Game). Although most 
studies have found that economics students tend to be 
relatively more selﬁsh, one study found that students 
in upper-level economics classes were more likely than 
students in other upper-level classes to return a lost 
envelope containing cash. According to the authors 
of one research study, “We . . . found evidence that 
the giving behavior of students who became econom-
ics majors was driven by nature, not nurture: Taking 
economics classes did not have a signiﬁcant negative 
effect on later giving by economics majors.”
The same study did ﬁnd, however, that taking eco-
nomics classes did reduce the generosity of students 
who did not go on to become economics majors. 
These non-majors may have experienced a “loss of 
innocence” as a result of being exposed to economic 
theories such as efﬁciency and proﬁt maximization. 
The authors conclude:
Our research suggests that economics educa-
tion could do a better job of providing balance. 
Learning about the shortcomings as well as the 
successes of free markets is at the heart of any 
good economics education, and students—
especially those who are not destined to major 
in the ﬁeld—deserve to hear both sides of the 
story.

ers, with no thought

CHAPTER 8 — ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR AND RATIONALITY
Especially relevant to economics is the fact that much economic behavior may be motivated 
by a desire to advance the common good—the general good of society, of which one’s own 
interests are only a part. Striving to advance the common good means seeing your own well-being 
as connected to the larger well-being of society. That is, people are often willing to participate 
in the creation of social beneﬁts as long as they feel that others are also contributing.
 Economists are increasingly realizing that a well-functioning economy cannot rely only 
on self-interest. Without such values as honesty, for example, even the simplest transaction 
would require elaborate safeguards or policing. Imagine if you were afraid to put down your 
money before having in your hands the merchandise that you wished to purchase—and the 
merchant was afraid that as soon as you had what you wanted, you would run out of the 
store without paying. Such a situation would require police in every store—but what if the 
police themselves operated with no ethic of honesty? Without ethical values that promote 
trust, inefﬁciencies would overwhelm any economic system.
If all those in business cheated whenever they thought they could get away with it, business 
would grind to a halt. If everyone in the government worked only for bribes, meaningful 
governance would disappear. In addition, people have to work together to overcome problems 
from externalities. And it is hard to imagine how the human race could survive if altruism was 
not common enough that people would be willing to make sacriﬁces of time, convenience, 
and resources to meet the needs of those who cannot take care of themselves, such as children 
or sick people.
Fortunately, recent experiments on human behavior demonstrate that people really do 
pay attention to social norms, and they are willing to reward those who follow these norms 
and to punish people who violate them, even when this has a cost in terms of their narrow 
self-interest. (See Box 8.3.)
3.5 THE MODEL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR IN CONTEXTUAL ECONOMICS
Many real-world problems would be difﬁcult, if not impossible, to solve in the absence of a rea-
sonable number of people willing to work for the common good. These people are often especially 
concentrated in the public purpose sphere, while individual altruism is most often evident in the 
core sphere of the economy. Does that mean that business is the sphere that operates only on 
self-interest? From about 1970 to the end of the twentieth century, economists, especially from 
the common good: 
the general well-being 
of society, including 
one’s own well-being
BOX 8.3  THE ULTIMATUM GAME 
A famous behavioral economics experiment is known 
as the “Ultimatum Game.” In this game, two people 
(who are in situations in which they cannot com-
municate with each other) are told that they will be 
given a sum of money, say $20, to share. The ﬁrst 
person gets to propose a way of splitting the sum. 
This person may offer to give $10 to the second per-
son or only $8 or $1 and plan to keep the rest. The 
second person cannot offer any input to this decision 
but can only decide whether to accept the offer or 
reject it. If the second person rejects the offer, both 
people will walk away empty-handed. If the offer is 
accepted, they get the money and split it as the ﬁrst 
person indicated.
If the two individuals act only from narrow ﬁnan-
cial self-interest, then the ﬁrst person should offer the 
second person the smallest possible amount—say 
$1—in order to keep the most for himself or herself. 
The second person should accept this offer because, 
from the point of view of pure ﬁnancial self-interest, 
$1 is better than nothing.
In fact, researchers ﬁnd that deals that vary too far 
from a 50–50 split tend to be rejected. People would 
rather walk away with nothing than be treated in a 
way that they perceive as unfair. Also, whether out of a 
sense of fairness or a fear of rejection, individuals who 
propose a split often offer something close to 50–50. 
In the context of social relations, even the most selﬁsh 
person will gain by serving the common good and thus 
walking away with somewhere around $10, rather 
than just looking at his or her own potential personal 
gain and quite possibly ending up with nothing. 

 
ECONOMIC RATIONALITY 
187
what was known as the “Chicago School,” pressed this case. Even early in this period concern 
arose that individuals who acted solely to achieve their personal goals could not be counted on 
to operate a business in ways that would be good for the business itself. This concern resulted 
in various efforts to reward business leaders for the success of their business.
These efforts had the unintended consequences of escalating compensation of top 
management in the United States to levels that were many times greater than anything that had 
previously been considered normal (or were normal in other countries). They also resulted in 
an increasingly short-term vision on the part of business leaders, whose compensation was set 
up to provide large rewards for quick proﬁts. Large-scale frauds, Ponzi schemes, tax evasion, 
and environmental and human costs that businesses externalized during this period have made 
it increasingly evident that society cannot afford to encourage a deﬁnition of economic activity 
in which normal human motivations are stripped down to selﬁsh pursuit of personal gain.
Modern research in behavioral economics suggests that the neoclassical rationality axiom 
does not stand up to tests of logic, experience, or the needs of society. (And some feminist 
economists have pointed out that the reference to “rational economic man” may be related 
to this one-dimensional view of human nature.)9 With that said, the following statements 
concerning motivations and behavior may provide a better grounding for economic theory.
s  We start with a deﬁnition of rationality that includes
1. choosing goals such that (a) when the actor achieves the goals, she or he will be glad to 
have done so; or (b) the pursuit of the goal itself contributes to well-being; and
2. pursuing those goals in a manner that the actor expects will lead toward their achievement.
s  This deﬁnition does not insist that the goals be either entirely self-interested or entirely 
altruistic. Rather, based on common experience and observation, it appears that most people 
operate with some mixture of these kinds of goals.
s  Our model then posits that most adults attempt to act rationally. However, sometimes lack 
of information, the inﬂuence of conﬂicting emotions, or inﬂuence from others who are 
pursuing different goals may cause rational actors to choose goals that are not consistent 
with well-being or to do things that lead away from their goals.
Although, compared to the rationality axiom, these statements are obviously much more 
inclusive, and closer to reality, they are also much looser and cannot be used in the same, 
deterministic manner. For example, because they do not claim that people optimize or maximize, 
they provide less opportunity for developing mathematical models based on simple axioms 
about behavior. Nor is there any claim that these statements are all that the economist needs to 
know about human behavior. Explanations or predictions of economic phenomena sometimes 
require individual judgment, experience, or inputs from other social sciences. Thus they do not 
conform to the ideal of “scientiﬁc” social science pursued by neoclassical economists.
However, many people have come to believe that neoclassical economics, which achieved 
many fruitful insights in its early decades, has explored all the territory that it initially opened up 
and has contributed less and less value as time has gone on. Moreover, its narrow view of human 
nature and lack of contextual awareness are criticized for leading to some of today’s problems. 
Neoclassical economists almost uniformly failed to see the growth of the ﬁnancial and real estate 
bubbles that led to the Great Recession, beginning in 2007. More broadly, some people believe the 
emphasis on selﬁshness has been used to justify a “culture of greed” (see Chapter 9), the dramatic 
increase in income and wealth inequality in recent decades (see Chapter 11), and ever greater 
concentration of economic and political power in ever larger corporations (see Chapter 18).
Once again, we face tradeoffs. If we are to develop economic theories equipped to deal with 
the critical issues of the twenty-ﬁrst century, we probably need to give up a degree of tidiness, 
amenability to mathematical modeling techniques, and the appearance of completely value-free 
objectivity. As you proceed through this book, you will be the judge of how well the view of human 
nature developed in this chapter supports a useful approach to understanding the economy.

information? Which economic actors might affect your decision making, and how?

to the one in the boat, keeping the larger one and throwing the others back into the 
water. What might be wrong with an attempt to perform the same exercise with choos-
ing friends, instead of ﬁsh? Have you ever heard of anyone who selected a spouse in

Consumption and the  
Consumer Society
We have deﬁned the economic activity of consumption as the process by which goods and 
services are put to ﬁnal use by people. But this rather dry, academic deﬁnition fails to capture 
the multifaceted role of consumerism in our lives. As one researcher put it:
For a start, it is immediately clear that consumption goes way beyond just satisfying 
physical or physiological needs for food, shelter, and so on. Material goods are deeply 
implicated in individuals’ psychological and social lives. People create and maintain 
identities using material things. . . . The “evocative power” of material things facilitates 
a range of complex, deeply ingrained “social conversations” about status, identity, social 
cohesion, and the pursuit of personal and cultural meaning.1
Until recently, most economists paid little attention to the motivations behind consumer 
behavior. As we discussed in Chapter 8, economic theory in the twentieth century simply 
assumed that the vast majority of people act rationally to maximize their utility. But as 
suggested in the quotation above, perhaps no other economic activity is shaped by its social 
context more than consumption. Our consumption behavior conveys a message to ourselves 
and others about who we are and how we ﬁt in with, or separate ourselves from, other 
people.
Modern consumption must also be placed in a historical context. When can we say that 
“consumer society” originated? Furthermore, is consumerism as experienced in the United 
States and other countries something that is ingrained in us by evolution, or is it something 
that has been created by marketing and other social and political forces?
Finally, it is impossible to present a comprehensive analysis of consumption without 
considering its environmental context. Speciﬁcally, ecological research suggests that 
consumption levels in the United States and many other developed countries have reached 
unsustainable levels. According to one recent analysis, if everyone in the world had the same 
living standard as the average American, we would need at least four earths to supply enough 
resources and process all the waste.2 So any serious discussion of sustainability must consider 
the future of consumption patterns throughout the world.
1. ECONOMIC THEORY AND CONSUMPTION
1.1 CONSUMER SOVEREIGNTY
Before focusing on the historical, social, and environmental contexts of consumption, we 
present the economic theory on the topic. Adam Smith once said, “Consumption is the sole 
end and purpose of all production and the welfare of the producer ought to be attended to, 
only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer.”3

 
ECONOMIC THEORY AND CONSUMPTION 
191
The belief that satisfaction of consumers’ needs and wants is the ultimate economic 
goal and that the economy is fundamentally ruled by consumer desires is called consumer 
sovereignty.
Consumer sovereignty suggests that all economic production and distribution are ultimately 
driven by the preferences of consumers. For example, consider the fact that sales of sport 
utility vehicles (SUVs) in the United States approximately doubled during the 1990s, while 
sales of cars decreased. The theory of consumer sovereignty would suggest that the primary 
reason for the growth of SUV sales is that consumers began to prefer larger vehicles over 
cars. Referring to Chapter 4, we would say that a change in consumers’ tastes and preferences 
increased the demand for SUVs and decreased the demand for cars. The idea that the shift 
in demand was driven primarily by automakers’ marketing efforts to sell large vehicles with 
higher proﬁt margins would not be consistent with consumer sovereignty.
The notion of consumer sovereignty has both positive and normative components. From a 
positive perspective, we can consider whether consumers really do “drive the economy.” In 
Chapter 8, we brieﬂy mentioned the possibility that consumers can be swayed by advertising. 
We consider the impact of advertising in more detail in this chapter.
Consumer sovereignty can also be viewed from a normative perspective. Should people’s 
preferences, as consumers, drive all decisions about economic production, distribution, and 
resource maintenance? People are more than just consumers. Consumption activities most 
directly address living standard (or lifestyle) goals, which have to do with satisfying basic 
needs and getting pleasure through the use of goods and services.
But people are often interested in other goals, such as self-realization, fairness, freedom, 
participation, social relations, and ecological balance. To some extent, these goals may be 
attained through consumption, but often they conﬂict with their goals as consumers. People 
also often obtain intrinsic satisfaction from working and producing. For many people, work 
deﬁnes a signiﬁcant part of their role in society. Work can create and maintain relationships. 
It can be a basis for self-respect and a signiﬁcant part of what gives life purpose and 
meaning.
If the economy is to promote well-being, all these goals must be taken into account. An 
economy that made people moderately happy as consumers but absolutely miserable as 
workers, citizens, or community members could hardly be considered a rousing success. We 
evaluate the relationship between consumption and well-being further toward the end of this 
chapter. But now we turn to the formal economic theory on consumption.
1.2 THE BUDGET LINE
The choices that we make as consumers illustrate yet another example of economic tradeoffs. 
In this case, consumers are constrained in their spending by the amount of their total budget. 
We can represent this in a simple model in which consumers have only two goods from which 
to choose. In Figure 9.1 we present a budget line, which shows the combinations of two goods 
that a consumer can purchase. In this example, our consumer—let’s call him Quong—has 
a budget of $8. The two goods that are available for him to purchase are chocolate bars and 
bags of nuts. The price of chocolate bars is $1 each, and nuts sell for $2 per bag.
If Quong spends his $8 only on chocolate, he can buy 8 bars, as indicated by the point where 
the budget line touches the vertical axis. If he buys only nuts, he can buy 4 bags, as indicated 
by the (4, 0) point on the horizontal axis. He can also buy any combination in between. For 
example, the point (2, 4), which indicates 2 bags of nuts and 4 chocolate bars, is also achievable. 
This is because (2 × $2) + (4 × $1) = $8. (We draw the budget line as continuous to reﬂect the 
more general case that might apply when there are many more alternatives, although here we 
assume that Quong buys only whole bars and whole bags, not fractions of them.)
A budget line is similar to the concept of a production possibilities frontier, which we 
discussed in Chapter 1. A budget line deﬁnes the choices that are possible for Quong. Points 
consumer sover-
eignty: the idea that 
consumers’ needs and 
wants determine the 
shape of all economic 
activities
living standard (or 
lifestyle) goals: goals 
related to satisfying 
basic needs and get-
ting pleasure through 
the use of goods and 
services
budget line: a line 
showing the possible 
combinations of two 
goods that a consum-
er can purchase

192 
CHAPTER 9 — CONSUMPTION AND THE CONSUMER SOCIETY
above and to the right of the budget line are not affordable. Points below and to the left of the 
budget line are affordable but do not use up the total budget. In this simple model, economists 
assume that people always want more of at least one of the goods in question. Consuming 
below the budget line would hence be inefﬁcient; funds that could be used to satisfy Quong’s 
desires are being left unused. Therefore, economists assume that consumers will choose to 
consume at a point on the budget line.
The position of the budget line depends on the size of the total budget (income) and on 
the prices of the two goods. For example, if Quong has $10 to spend, instead of $8, the line 
would shift outward in a parallel manner, as shown in Figure 9.2. He could now consume 
more nuts, or more chocolate, or a more generous combination of both.
If (starting at the original income of $8) the price of nuts dropped to $1 per bag, the budget 
line would rotate out, as shown in Figure 9.3. Now, if Quong bought only nuts, he could buy

8 bags instead of 4. With the price of chocolate unchanged, however, he still could not buy 
more than 8 chocolate bars.
A budget line tells us what combinations of purchases are possible, but it does not tell us 
how the consumer will decide which combination to consume. To get to this, we must add 
the theory of utility.
1.3 CONSUMER UTILITY
Economists have traditionally deﬁned consumers’ “problem” as how to maximize utility given 
their income constraints. Utility is a somewhat vague concept, similar to the idea of welfare 
deﬁned in Chapter 6. However, although economists attempt to measure welfare quantita-
tively, utility is generally recognized as something that cannot be measured quantitatively 
and cannot be aggregated across individuals.* We deﬁne utility as the pleasure or satisfaction 
that individuals receive from goods, services, or experiences. Furthermore, we assume that 
individuals make consumer decisions to increase their utility. But as discussed in Chapter 
8, we recognize that consumers often do not always make the best decisions, because they 
sometimes act irrationally or are unduly inﬂuenced by certain information (or misinforma-
tion). We discuss the implications of this further in the next section.
Economists have developed a model of utility that, like many economic models, is an 
abstraction from reality that is useful for illustrating a particular concept. So despite the 
fact that we just said that utility cannot be measured quantitatively in the real world, for the 
purposes of our model we assume that we actually can measure utility in some imaginary units 
of “satisfaction.” Thus Table 9.1 presents the total utility that Quong obtains from purchasing 
different quantities of chocolate bars in a given period, say a day.
*Some economists in the 1800s, such as William Stanley Jevons (1835–1882) actually did believe that utility was 
something that could eventually be measured numerically.

We can then plot Quong’s total utility from consuming chocolate bars in Figure 9.4. 
This relationship between utility and the quantity of something consumed is called a utility 
function, or a total utility curve.
Quong’s utility curve levels off as his consumption of chocolate bars increases. This is generally 
expected—that successive units of something consumed provide less utility than the previous 
unit. In other words, consumers’ utility functions generally display diminishing marginal utility. 
This is shown in Table 9.1. We see that Quong obtains 10 units of “satisfaction” from consuming 
his ﬁrst chocolate bar. While his utility increases from 10 to 18 units by consuming his second 
chocolate bar, his marginal utility is only 8 units. Consuming his third chocolate bar, he obtains a 
marginal utility of 6 units. This is shown in Figure 9.4, where his utility is shown as increasing from 
18 to 24 units. Eventually, Quong’s consumption of chocolate becomes much less pleasurable, 
and when he consumes his sixth chocolate bar, his utility actually starts to decline. Assuming 
that Quong is rational, he would never consume more than ﬁve chocolate bars in a day.

CHAPTER 9 — CONSUMPTION AND THE CONSUMER SOCIETY
Now we can apply the concept of utility to the budget line that Quong faces. Realize that 
Quong will also have a utility function for bags of nuts, which will display a similar pattern 
of diminishing marginal utility. Let’s assume that his ﬁrst bag of nuts provides him with 
20 units of utility, his second bag with 15 units, and each successive bag with less units of 
utility. How can Quong allocate his limited budget to provide him with the highest amount 
of total utility?
We provide a formal model of utility maximization in the appendix to this chapter, but 
we can easily see how Quong might approach his problem in a purely rational manner using 
marginal thinking. Suppose that Quong is thinking about how he will spend his ﬁrst $2. With 
$2 he can buy either two chocolate bars or one bag of nuts. If he buys two chocolate bars, he 
will obtain 18 total units of utility, as shown in Table 9.1. If he buys one bag of nuts instead, 
he will obtain 20 units of utility. Thus Quong will receive greater utility by spending his ﬁrst 
$2 on a bag of nuts.
What about his next $2? If he spends this on his second bag of nuts, he obtains an additional 
15 units of utility. But if he instead purchases his ﬁrst two chocolate bars, he will obtain 18 
units of utility. So, by spending his next $2 on chocolate bars, he increases his utility by a 
greater amount. After spending $4 Quong has purchased one bag of nuts and two chocolate 
bars, thus obtaining a total utility of 38 units. Quong can continue to apply marginal thinking 
to maximize his utility until he has eventually spent his entire budget. The basic decision rule 
to maximize utility is to allocate each additional dollar on the good or service that provides 
the greatest marginal utility for that dollar.* Again, see the appendix for a formal presentation 
of utility maximization.
1.4 LIMITATIONS OF THE STANDARD CONSUMER MODEL
We suspect that you have never thought about how to spend your money in a manner 
similar to Quong’s marginal analysis of chocolate and nuts. It is less important that 
people behave exactly as a model suggests than it is to consider whether people gener-
ally act as if they are always trying to increase their utility as much as possible. There 
are several reasons to be skeptical about this. First, the utility model assumes that people 
are rational, but as we saw in Chapter 8, this is not always the case. The model also as-
sumes that all the beneﬁts from consumption can be identiﬁed, compared, and added up.

Utility rises steeply for the ﬁrst few 
chocolate bars and then more slowly 
as Quong gets sated. 
*As most goods and services are not available in $1 increments, such as bags of nuts, consumers will not always be able to 
allocate every single dollar in a way that maximizes utility.

 
ECONOMIC THEORY AND CONSUMPTION 
195
While comparing the utility from chocolate and nuts may be relatively easy to imagine, 
consumers’ decisions become much more complicated when they are faced with a wide 
variety of options.
Economists have traditionally assumed that having more options from which to choose 
can only beneﬁt consumers, but recent research demonstrates that there is a cost in trying to 
process additional information. In fact, having too many choices can actually “overload” our 
ability to evaluate different options. Consider a famous example demonstrating the effect of 
having too much choice.4 In one experiment, researchers at a supermarket in California set 
up a display table with six different ﬂavors of jam. Shoppers could taste any (or all) of the 
six ﬂavors and receive a discount coupon to purchase any ﬂavor. About 30 percent of those 
who tried one or more jams ended up buying some.
The researchers then repeated this experiment but, instead, offered 24 ﬂavors of jam 
for tasting. In this case, only 3 percent of those who tasted a jam went on to buy some. In 
theory, it would seem that more choice would increase the chances of ﬁnding a jam that 
one really liked and would be willing to buy. But, instead, the additional choices decreased 
one’s motivation to make a decision to buy a jam. A 2010 article from The Economist 
addressed this topic:
As options multiply, there may be a point at which the effort required to obtain enough 
information to be able to distinguish sensibly between alternatives outweighs the 
beneﬁt to the consumer of the extra choice. “At this point,” writes Barry Schwartz in 
The Paradox of Choice, “choice no longer liberates, but debilitates. It might even be 
said to tyrannise.” In other words, as Mr. Schwartz puts it, “the fact that some choice 
is good doesn’t necessarily mean that more choice is better.”
Daniel McFadden, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, says that 
consumers ﬁnd too many options troubling because of the “risk of misperception and 
miscalculation, of misunderstanding the available alternatives, of misreading one’s own 
tastes, of yielding to a moment’s whim and regretting it afterwards,” combined with 
“the stress of information acquisition.”5
Another important point is that when consumers make a decision to purchase a good or 
service, they are essentially making a prediction about the utility that the purchase will bring 
them. Daniel Kahneman, whom we encountered in Chapter 8, distinguishes between predicted 
utility and remembered utility. Predicted utility is the utility that you expect to obtain from 
a purchase (or other experience), whereas remembered utility is the utility that you actually 
recall after you have made a purchase. In other words, Kahneman considers whether people 
actually receive the beneﬁts they expect in advance of their purchases. According to the 
standard consumer model with rational decision makers, these two utilities should match 
relatively closely.
Once again research from behavioral economics suggests that people’s predictions can 
often turn out to be incorrect. In one well-known experiment, young professors were asked 
to predict the effect of their tenure decision on their long-term happiness. Although being 
granted tenure essentially ensures a professor lifetime employment, being denied tenure means 
he or she must ﬁnd a new job. Most young professors predict that being denied tenure will 
have a long-term negative impact on their happiness. Yet surveys of professors who actually 
have and have not been granted tenure indicate that there is no signiﬁcant long-term effect 
of tenure decision on happiness levels. A similar experiment showed that college students 
overpredicted the negative effects of a romantic breakup.6
These ﬁndings have implications for welfare analysis, as discussed in Chapter 6. Realize 
that a demand curve is an expression of predicted utility. Welfare analysis measures consumer 
surplus based on demand curves, thus implicitly assuming that predicted utility matches 
well with remembered utility. But if predicted and remembered utility differs, any welfare 

196 
CHAPTER 9 — CONSUMPTION AND THE CONSUMER SOCIETY
implications based on demand curves will be an inaccurate estimate of the utility that people 
actually receive from their purchases.
We must also recognize the potential for consumers to be swayed by advertising and other 
inﬂuences into making poor consumer decisions, as we discussed in Chapter 8. Advertising 
expenditures in the United States totaled about $250 billion in 2012, equivalent to close to 
2 percent of the entire national economy, or about $800 per person.7 Of course, the purpose 
of advertising is not necessarily to assist consumers to make the best choices. We further 
discuss the impact of advertising later in this chapter.
Discussion Questions
1. Budget lines can be used to analyze various kinds of tradeoffs. Suppose that you have a 
total “time budget” for recreation of 2 hours. Think of two activities you might like to do 
for recreation, and draw a budget line diagram illustrating the recreational opportunities 
open to you. What if you had a time budget of three hours instead?
2. Explain in words why the total utility curve has the shape that it does in Figure 9.4.
2. CONSUMPTION IN HISTORICAL AND INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT
Perhaps the greatest limitation of the standard consumer model is that it does not really tell 
us anything interesting about why consumers make particular choices. For example, why 
might Quong purchase so many chocolate bars that it has a negative impact on his health? 
Can someone who smokes cigarettes truly be acting in a utility-maximizing manner? Why 
do people acquire huge credit card debts by making seemingly frivolous purchases? Why 
would someone spend $60,000 or more on a new car when a car costing much less may be 
perfectly adequate for all practical purposes?
To answer such questions, we must recognize the historical and social nature of 
consumption. We are so immersed in a culture of consumption that we can be said to be 
living in a consumer society, a society in which a large part of people’s sense of identity 
and meaning is achieved through the purchase and use of consumer goods and services. 
Viewing consumption through the lens of a consumer society is quite different from looking 
at consumption from the standard economic model of consumer behavior.
We ﬁrst consider the historical evolution of consumer society, along with the institutions 
that allowed consumer society to ﬂourish. Then we take a brief look at consumer society 
around the world today.
2.1 A BRIEF HISTORY OF CONSUMER SOCIETY
When can we say that consumer society originated? Historians have placed the birth of the 
consumer society variously from the sixteenth century to the mid-1900s.8 To some extent, the 
answer depends on whether we consider consumerism, understood as having one’s sense of 
identity and meaning deﬁned largely through the purchase and use of consumer goods and 
services, as an innate human characteristic. In other words, does consumerism come naturally 
to humans or is it an acquired trait?
Of course, for thousands of years a small elite class has existed that enjoyed higher 
consumption standards and habitually bought luxury goods and services. One story of the 
birth of consumer society says that it is human nature to want to acquire more goods, so all 
that is needed for the birth of consumer society is for a signiﬁcant portion of the population to 
have more money than is necessary for basic survival. However, this explanation is incorrect 
or at least a vast oversimpliﬁcation.
Before the eighteenth century, families and communities that acquired more than enough 
to meet basic needs did not automatically respond by becoming consumers. Religious value 
systems generally taught material restraint. Patterns of dress and household display were 
consumer society: 
a society in which a 
large part of people’s 
sense of identity and 
meaning is found 
through the purchase 
and use of consumer 
goods and services

dictated by tradition, depending on the class to which one belonged, with little change over 
time. Unlike the norm in modern times, in the past emphasis was more often placed on 
community spending, such as for a new church, as opposed to private spending.
The historical consensus is that the consumer society as a mass phenomenon originated 
in the eighteenth century in Western Europe. Although it is no coincidence that this time and 
location coincides with the birth of the Industrial Revolution, consumer society was not solely 
the result of greater prosperity. The Industrial Revolution clearly transformed production. It 
is less obvious, but equally true, that it transformed consumption, as much through the social 
changes it produced as through the economic changes.
The arrival of consumerism in Western Europe involved truly revolutionary change 
in the way goods were sold, in the array of goods available and cherished, and in the 
goals people deﬁned for their daily lives. This last—the redeﬁnition of needs and 
aspirations—is the core feature of consumerism.9
The large-scale emigration of people from the agricultural countryside to cities in search 
of work brought signiﬁcant social disruption. Instead of ﬁnding personal and social meaning 
in tradition and community, people sought new ways to deﬁne themselves, often through 
consumer goods. Also, shopkeepers for the ﬁrst time began to create window displays, 
engage in newspaper advertising, and use other methods to attract customers. Furthermore, 
the breakdown of strict class lines meant that common people had the freedom to express 
themselves in new ways, including displays of wealth that would have been discouraged, or 
even illegal, in the past.
Yet although consumerism took root in the eighteenth century, it took some time before it 
fully blossomed. At the dawn of industrialization, it was not at all clear that workers would or 
could become consumers. Early British industrialists complained that their employees would 
work only until they had earned their traditional weekly income and then stop until the next 
week. Leisure, it appeared, was more valuable to the workers than increased income. This 
attitude, widespread in preindustrial societies, was incompatible with mass production and 
mass consumption. It could be changed in either of two ways.
At ﬁrst, employers responded by lowering wages and imposing strict discipline on workers 
to force them to work longer hours. Early textile mills frequently employed women, teenagers, 
and even children, because they were easier to control and could be paid less than adult 
male workers. As a consequence of such draconian strategies of labor discipline, living and 
working conditions for the ﬁrst few generations of factory workers were worse than in the 
generations before industrialization.
Over time, however, agitation by organized workers, political reformers, and civic and 
humanitarian groups created pressure for better wages, hours, and working conditions, while 
rising productivity and proﬁts made it possible for business to respond to this pressure. A 
second response to the preindustrial work ethic gradually evolved: As workers came to see 
themselves as consumers, they would no longer choose to stop work early and enjoy more 
leisure; rather, they preferred to work full-time, or even overtime, in order to earn and spend 
more. In the United States, the “worker as consumer” view was fully entrenched by the 1920s, 
when the labor movement stopped advocating a shorter workweek and instead focused on 
better wages and working conditions.
Other historical developments were important to the spread of consumer society. One 
was the invention of the department store, in the mid-nineteenth century in England. 
Department stores quickly spread to other European countries and the United States. 
Featuring lavish displays, department stores presented shoppers with the opportunity 
to purchase an entirely new lifestyle, all under one roof. Department stores introduced 
the idea of shopping as “spectacle,” with entertainment, elaborate interiors, seasonal 
displays, and parades.10

198 
CHAPTER 9 — CONSUMPTION AND THE CONSUMER SOCIETY
The department store was a permanent fair, a dream world, a spectacle of excessive 
proportions. Going to the store became an event and an adventure. One came less to 
purchase a particular article than to simply visit, to browse, to see what was new, to try 
on new fashions and even new identities.11
Modern shopping malls originated in the United States in the early twentieth century. 
Suburbanization in the United States in the mid-twentieth century was supported by the 
construction of large shopping malls far from city centers but easily accessible by automobile. 
By the 1980s and 1990s enormous shopping malls, such as the Mall of America in Minnesota, 
were being constructed with entertainment options including indoor roller coasters and 
aquariums.
Another institution created to support the consumer society was expanded consumer 
credit, particularly the invention of credit cards in the 1940s. In 2012, nearly three-fourths 
of U.S. households had at least one credit card. Although some cardholders use them only 
for convenience, paying off their balances in full each month, about half of cardholders use 
them as a form of borrowing by carrying unpaid balances, on which they pay interest, with 
annualized rates that can exceed 30 percent. 
Figure 9.5 illustrates the growth of revolving debt in the United States over the past several 
decades, adjusted for inﬂation.* We see that revolving debt, which consists almost entirely 
of credit card debt, increased by a factor of 100 from 1968 until about 2007, when the Great 
Recession caused households to reduce their debt, as spending declined and credit became 
less available. In early 2013, total outstanding credit card debt in the United States was about 
$830 billion, equivalent to more than $7,000 per household. However, given that about half 
of households do not carry an unpaid monthly balance on their credit cards, those households 
that do carry a balance had an average credit card debt of around $15,000.
2.2 LIMITS TO MODERN CONSUMERISM
Can we say, at the start of the twenty-ﬁrst century, that consumerism has become a global 
phenomenon? It is true that people all over the world are increasingly exposed to similar 
*Revolving debt allows consumers to borrow money against a line of credit, without the requirement that the amount 
borrowed be fully paid off each month. Thus the balance from one or more months can carry over, or “revolve,” to the next 
month. The vast majority of revolving debt is credit card debt.

commercial messages and images of “the good life,” but consumer society is not yet univer-
sal for two main reasons. First, about 2.4 billion people around the world (about one-third 
of humanity) live in absolute poverty, deﬁned by the World Bank as living on less than $2 
per day. Obviously, consumerism is not an option for the global poor. Second, in numerous 
places around the world cultural and religious values exist that seek to restrain, or even reject, 
the consumer society. We ﬁrst discuss global poverty and then turn to a brief discussion of 
nonconsumer values.
Insufﬁcient Consumption: Poverty
One-third of the global population lives in extreme poverty, or absolute deprivation. What 
constitutes absolute deprivation? The United Nations has deﬁned it as “a condition char-
acterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, 
sanitation facilities, health, shelter, education and information. It depends not only on income 
but also on access to services.”
The poorest of developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, 
are simply too poor to lift their entire populations out of absolute deprivation. Increasingly, 
however, the more economically successful developing countries in Asia and Latin America 
have sufﬁcient resources to provide everyone with basic necessities; the fact that absolute 
deprivation still exists for the poor in these countries reﬂects inequality in the distribution 
of income. Absolute deprivation may also vary with factors such as race and ethnicity and 
even within a household on the basis of age or gender.
Because insufﬁcient consumption is not simply a matter of having a low household income, 
even in regions that could be generally characterized as middle or high income, examples 
of absolute deprivation can still be found. Some people—particularly young children and 
the ill and handicapped—have dependency needs for care that may be unmet. Even people 
with a fairly high household income may sometimes, then, ﬁnd themselves lacking basic 
necessities. Advocates for the elderly, the sick, and children, for example, often claim that 
the United States has an inadequate system of care.
Absolute deprivation is only one type of insufficiency. Modern communication 
technology means that nearly everyone has some exposure to the “lifestyles of the rich and 
famous.” The result is the creation of widespread feelings of relative deprivation, that is, 
the sense that one’s own condition is inadequate because it is inferior to someone else’s 
circumstances. The richest man in a small village may be quite content with traditional 
clothing and diet, an outdoor latrine, and water drawn from a communal well, so long 
as that way of life is consistent with honor and self-respect. However, after he begins to 
compare his circumstances with those in the city, he may begin to feel that they are less 
than they should be.
The government-deﬁned poverty level in the United States was $23,550 for a family of 
four in 2013. This income would be at or above the national average in many countries; in 
most developing countries, a family income of $23,550 would be considered wealthy. It 
may be possible to buy the bare physical necessities of life for this sum, even in the United 
States—at least in areas of the country with low housing costs. Yet it is likely that most of 
the Americans who fall below the poverty level (15 percent of the population in 2011) do 
not feel able to enjoy a “normal” American lifestyle. They clearly do not have the resources 
to buy the kinds of homes, cars, clothing, and other consumer goods commonly shown on 
American television. They may need to rely on inadequate public transportation and wait 
in long lines for health care. People with sufﬁcient physical means of survival may still feel 
ashamed, belittled, and socially unaccepted if they have much less than everyone around 
them. The 22 percent of U.S. children who live in poverty do not start out on an “even playing 
ﬁeld” with nonpoor children, in terms of nutrition, health care, and other requirements. The 
fact that people who cannot afford to consume at “normal” societal consumption levels feel 
absolute depriva-
tion: severe depriva-
tion of basic human 
needs
relative depriva-
tion: the feeling of 
lack that comes from 
comparing oneself 
with someone who 
has more
dependency needs: 
the need to receive 
care, shelter, or food 
from others when un-
able to provide these 
for oneself

200 
CHAPTER 9 — CONSUMPTION AND THE CONSUMER SOCIETY
relative deprivation suggests that poverty, even relative poverty, is not conducive to promoting 
well-being and self-respect.
Nonconsumerist Values
The spread of consumerism has met considerable resistance in some societies, usually because 
it conﬂicts with existing values, either religious or secular. For example, the Muslim concept 
of riba prohibits charging interest on loans. Buddhism teaches a “middle path” that emphasizes 
material simplicity, nonviolence, and inner peace. Various passages of the New Testament of 
the Bible emphasize the spiritual dangers of wealth, such as the saying that it is easier for a 
camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven.
Traditional cultural values in some countries have restrained the spread of 
consumerism. In some countries, consumerism is associated with foreign, typically 
American, values.
Consumption expansion thus tends to lead to some level of global homogenization of 
culture among consumers, an effect that gives rise to negative responses to globalization. 
As consumer goods are always also cultural goods, expansion of consumption of 
imported products and services often gives rise to an exaggerated sense of “panic,” of 
cultural “invasion” which, supposedly, if left unchecked will result in the demise of 
the local culture.12
Social norms and government policies in various European countries aim to promote 
nonconsumerist values. For example, many retail stores in France, Italy, and other European 
countries are normally closed at lunchtime and on Sundays. European policies on vacation 
time, parental leave, and ﬂexible working hours emphasize a work–life balance.
Even in the United States, the spread of consumerism has not been an even, uninterrupted 
process. The history of consumer society in the United States reveals periodic movements 
against consumerism. The Quakers in the eighteenth century, the Transcendentalists of the 
mid-nineteenth century (most famously, Henry David Thoreau), the Progressives at the turn 
of the twentieth century, and the hippies of the 1960s all espoused a simpler, less materialistic 
life philosophy.13 More recently, starting in the 1980s the idea of voluntary simplicity, which 
we discuss further later in the chapter, has attracted a following among Americans motivated 
by objectives such as reducing environmental impacts, focusing more on family and social 
connections, healthy living, and stress reduction.
Discussion Questions
1. Considering what you know about the societies in which your grandparents or great-
grandparents grew up, would you say that they lived in a “consumer society”? How do 
you think their views on consumerism as young adults might have differed from those of 
you and your friends?
2. What do you know about views on consumerism in other countries, either from what you 
have read or what you have observed from traveling? Which societies, if any, do you ﬁnd 
too focused on consumerism? Which societies, if any, do you think have appropriate views 
on consumerism?
3. CONSUMPTION IN A SOCIAL CONTEXT
As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, in modern consumer societies, consumption 
is as much a social activity as an economic activity. Consumption is tied closely to personal 
identity, and it has become a means of communicating social messages. An increasing range 
of social interactions are inﬂuenced by consumer values.

 
CONSUMPTION IN A SOCIAL CONTEXT 
201
Consumption pervades our everyday lives and structures our everyday practices. The 
values, meanings, and costs of what we consume have become an increasingly important 
part of our social and personal experiences. . . . [Consumption] has entered into the . . . 
fabric of modern life. All forms of social life—from education to sexual relations to 
political campaigns—are now seen as consumer relations.14
3.1 SOCIAL COMPARISONS
As social beings, we compare ourselves to other people. Our income and consumption levels 
are some of the most important ways in which we evaluate ourselves relative to others. As 
discussed above, whether people consider themselves poor often depends on the condition 
of those around them.
You have probably heard of the saying “Keeping up with the Joneses.” This saying refers 
to the motivation to maintain a material lifestyle that is comparable to those around us. A 
reference group is a group of people who inﬂuence the behavior of a consumer because the 
consumer compares himself or herself with that group. Most people have various reference 
groups, traditionally including our neighbors, our coworkers, and other members of our family. 
We also are inﬂuenced as consumers by aspirational groups, groups to which a consumer 
wishes he or she could belong. People often buy, dress, and behave like the group—corporate 
executives, rock stars, athletes, or whoever—with whom they would like to identify.
Economist Juliet Schor argues that the nature of social comparisons related to consumption 
has changed in the past few decades. She suggests that in the 1950s and 1960s the idea of 
“Keeping up with the Joneses” emphasized comparisons between individuals or families with 
similar incomes and backgrounds. Because prosperity was broadly shared in the postwar decades, 
people did not want to feel left out as new consumer goods and living standards emerged. More 
recently, however, she has observed a different approach to consumption comparisons.
Beginning in the 1980s, those conditions changed, and what I have termed the new 
consumerism emerged. The new consumerism is more upscale in the sense that there is 
more aggressive, rather than defensive, consumption positioning. The new consumerism 
is more anonymous and is less socially benign than the old regime of keeping up with 
the Joneses. In part, this is because reference groups have become vertically elongated. 
People are now more likely to compare themselves with, or aspire to the lifestyle of, 
those far above them in the economic hierarchy.15
Schor presents the results of a survey to support this view, which indicates that 85 percent 
of respondents aspire to become someone who “really made it” or is at least “doing very 
well.” But the survey results also show that only 18 percent of Americans are members of 
these groups based on income.16 If 85 percent of people aspire to be in the top 18 percent, 
obviously most will end up disappointed.
Changes in economic inequality, which we discuss further in Chapter 11, are also relevant 
to her hypothesis. During the 1950s and 1960s, economic inequality in the United States was 
decreasing—that is, the gap between different levels of the income hierarchy was generally 
shrinking. However, beginning in the 1970s economic inequality began to increase, thus 
making it difﬁcult to maintain even the existing distance between an individual and his or 
her aspirational group.
Media representations of wealthy lifestyles also became more common. In the 1950s and 
1960s, most television shows depicted middle-class lifestyles. But starting in the 1980s, 
television shows as well as advertisements increasingly depicted upper-class lifestyles. 
Exposure to media representations of wealth inﬂuences people’s values and spending patterns. 
Schor’s own research indicates that the more television a person watches, the more he or she 
is likely to spend, holding constant other variables such as income. Higher rates of television

the group to which an 
individual compares 
himself or herself
aspirational group: 
the group to which an 
individual aspires to 
belong

CHAPTER 9 — CONSUMPTION AND THE CONSUMER SOCIETY
watching have also been associated with having materialistic values.17 Other research has 
found that heavy television watchers are likely to overstate the percentage of the population 
that owns luxury items, such as convertibles and hot tubs, or that have maids or servants.18
Schor’s conclusion is that identifying with unrealistic aspirational groups leads many 
people to consume well above their means, acquiring large debts and suffering frustration 
as they attempt to join those groups through their consumption patterns but fail to achieve 
the income to sustain them. As people tend to evaluate themselves relative to reference and 
aspirational groups, with increasing inequality some may feel as if they are falling behind 
even if their incomes are actually increasing.
The more our consumer satisfaction is tied to social comparisons—whether upscaling, just 
keeping up, or not falling too far behind—the less we achieve when consumption grows, 
because the people we compare ourselves to are also experiencing rising consumption. 
. . . The problem is not just that more consumption doesn’t yield more satisfaction, but 
that it always has a cost. The extra hours we have to work to earn the money cut into 
personal and family time. Whatever we consume has an ecological impact. . . . We ﬁnd 
ourselves skimping on invisibles such as insurance, college funds, and retirement savings 
as the visible commodities somehow become indispensable. . . . We are impoverishing 
ourselves in pursuit of a consumption goal that is inherently unattainable. In the words of 
one focus-group participant, we “just don’t know when to stop and draw the line.”
3.2 ADVERTISING
Although advertising has existed as a specialized profession for only about a century, it has 
become a force that rivals education and religion in shaping public values and aspirations. 
We already saw that advertising spending in the United States totals about $800 per person 
annually. According to various estimates, arrived at before the widespread use of the Internet, 
Americans are exposed to between 200 and 3,000 commercial messages per day.
About one-third of global advertising spending takes place in the United States (see Figure 
9.6). Japan is the world’s second-largest advertising market, followed by China. Advertising is

increasing most rapidly in China and other emerging markets. Per-capita advertising spending 
in China increased from just 9 cents in 1986 to $22 in 2011.
Advertising is often justiﬁed by economists as a source of information about products and 
services available in the marketplace. Although it certainly plays that role, it also does much 
more. Advertising appeals to many different values, emotional as well as practical needs 
and a range of desires and fantasies. The multitude of advertisements that we encounter 
carry their own separate messages; yet on a deeper level, they all share a common, powerful 
cultural message.
What the vast amount of advertising really sells is consumer culture itself. Even if 
advertising fails to sell a particular product, the advertisements still sell the meanings 
and values of a consumer culture. As Christopher Lasch writes, “The importance of 
advertising is not that it invariably succeeds in its immediate purpose, . . . but simply 
that it surrounds people with images of the good life in which happiness depends on 
consumption. The ubiquity of such images leaves little space for competing conceptions 
of the good life.”19 
According to one estimate, the typical American will spend about three years of his or 
her life watching television ads.20 We have already mentioned how watching television can 
inﬂuence people’s spending behavior and values. Other research details how television, and 
advertising in particular, is associated with obesity, attention deﬁcit disorder, heart disease, 
and other negative consequences. Furthermore, advertising commonly portrays unrealistic 
body images, traditionally for women but more recently for men as well. (See Box 9.1 for 
more on the effects of advertising on girls and women.)
BOX 9.1 WOMEN AND ADVERTISING
A 2007 report by the American Psychological 
Association concluded that advertising and other 
media images encourage girls to focus on physical 
appearance and sexuality, with harmful results for their 
emotional and physical well-being. The research project 
reviewed data from numerous media sources, including 
television, music videos and lyrics, movies, magazines, 
and video games. The report found that 85 percent of 
the sexualized images of children were of girls.
The lead author of the report, Dr. Eileen L. 
Zurbriggen, said, “The consequences of the sexu-
alization of girls in media today are very real and 
are likely to be a negative inﬂuence on girls’ healthy 
development. We have ample evidence to conclude 
that sexualization has negative effects in a variety of 
domains, including cognitive functioning, physical and 
mental health, and healthy sexual development.”
Three of the most common mental health problems 
associated with exposure to sexualized images and 
unrealistic body ideals are eating disorders, low self-
esteem, and depression. It is estimated that 8 million 
Americans suffer from an eating disorder—7 million 
of them women. About 20 percent of anorexics will 
eventually die from the disorder. According to a 2012 
article, most female models would be considered 
anorexic according to their body mass index. Twenty 
years ago the average model weighed 8 percent less 
than the average woman; now it is 23 percent less.
Jean Kilbourne, an author and ﬁlmmaker who 
holds a Ph.D. in education, has been lobbying for 
advertising reforms since the 1960s. She has produced 
four documentaries on the negative effects of advertis-
ing on women, most recently in 2010, under the title 
Killing Us Softly. Kilbourne notes that virtually all pho-
tos of models in advertisements have been touched 
up, eliminating wrinkles, blemishes, extra weight, and 
even skin pores. She believes that we need to change 
the environment of advertising through public policy. 
Dr. Zurbriggen concludes, “As a society, we need 
to replace all of these sexualized images with ones 
showing girls in positive settings—ones that show the 
uniqueness and competence of girls.”

CHAPTER 9 — CONSUMPTION AND THE CONSUMER SOCIETY
3.3 PRIVATE VERSUS PUBLIC CONSUMPTION
The growth of consumerism has altered the balance between private and public consumption. 
Public infrastructure has been shaped by the drive to sell and consume new products and the 
availability of public and private options, in turn, shapes individual consumer choices.
In the early 1930s, for example, many major U.S. cities—including Los Angeles—had 
extensive, relatively efﬁcient, and nonpolluting electric streetcar systems. Then, in 1936, a 
group of companies involved in bus and diesel gasoline production, led by General Motors, 
formed a group called the National City Lines (NCL). They bought up electric streetcar 
systems in 45 cities and dismantled them, replacing them with bus systems that also tended 
to promote automobile dependency. U.S. government support for highway construction in the 
1950s further hastened the decline of rail transportation, made possible the spread of suburbs 
far removed from workplaces, and encouraged the purchase of automobiles.
Many of the choices that you have, as an individual, depend on decisions made for you 
by businesses and governments. Los Angeles would look much different today—more like 
the older sections of many East Coast and European cities—if it had been built up around 
streetcar lines rather than cars and buses. Even today one can see tradeoffs between public (or 
publicly accessible) infrastructure and private consumption. As more people carry cell phones 
and bottled water, pay telephones and drinking fountains come to be less well maintained in 
some cities, leading more people to need to carry cell phones and bottled water.
Discussion Questions
1. What are your reference groups? Describe why you consider these your reference groups. 
What are your aspirational groups? Why do you aspire to be a member of these groups?
2. Think about at least one fashion item you own, such as an item of clothing, jewelry, or 
accessory, that you think says a lot about who you are. What do you think it says about 
you? Do you think others interpret the item in the same way that you do? How much do 
you think that you were inﬂuenced by advertising or other media in your views about 
the item?
4. CONSUMPTION IN AN ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT
The production process that creates every consumer product requires natural resources and 
generates some waste and pollution. However, we are normally only vaguely aware of the 
ecological impact of the processes that supply us with consumer goods.
The problem is that we do not often see the true ugliness of the consumer economy 
and so are not compelled to do much about it. The distance between shopping malls 
and their associated mines, wells, corporate farms, factories, toxic dumps, and landﬁlls, 
sometimes half a world away, dampens our perceptions that something is fundamentally 
wrong.21
Most of us are unaware that, for example, it requires about 600 gallons of water to 
make a quarter-pound hamburger or that making a computer chip generates 4,500 times 
its weight in waste.22 (For another example of the ecological impacts of consumption, 
see Box 9.2.)
4.1 THE LINK BETWEEN CONSUMPTION AND THE ENVIRONMENT
In quantifying the ecological impacts of consumerism, most people focus on the amount of 
“trash” generated by households and businesses. In 2011, the U.S. economy generated about 
250 million tons of municipal solid waste, which consisted mostly of paper, food waste, and 
yard waste.23 Although the total amount of municipal solid waste generated has increased 

 
CONSUMPTION IN AN ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT 
205
in recent decades (an increase of nearly 200 percent since 1960), the portion recycled has 
increased from around 6 percent in the 1960s to about one-third today.
But most of the waste generation in a consumer society occurs during the extraction, 
processing, or manufacturing stages—these impacts are normally hidden from consumers. 
According to data from 2000, the U.S. economy required about 30 billion tons of material 
inputs, which is equivalent to more than 100 tons per person.24 The vast majority of this 
material is discarded as mining waste, crop residue, logging waste, chemical runoff, and other 
waste prior to the consumption stage.
Perhaps the most comprehensive attempt to quantify the overall ecological impact of 
consumption is the ecological footprint measure. This approach estimates how much land 
area a human society requires to provide all that it takes from nature and to absorb its waste 
and pollution. Although the details of the ecological footprint calculations are subject to 
debate, it does provide a useful way to compare the overall ecological impact of consumption 
in different countries.
We see in Figure 9.7 that the ecological footprint per capita varies signiﬁcantly across 
countries. The United States has one of the highest per-capita ecological footprints (the per-
capita footprints of some oil-producing countries are higher). The average European has a 
footprint about half the U.S. level, while the typical Chinese has a footprint one-quarter the 
U.S. level.
Perhaps the most signiﬁcant implication of the ecological footprint research is that the world 
is now in a situation of “overshoot”—our global use of resources and generation of waste 
exceeds the global capacity to supply resources and assimilate waste, by about 50 percent 
according to recent estimates. The situation is much worse when we consider whether everyone 
in the world can consume at a level equivalent to the typical American. In that case, we would 
require four to ﬁve earths to provide the needed resources and assimilate the waste.
BOX 9.2 THE ENVIRONMENTAL STORY OF A T-SHIRT
T-shirts, along with jeans, are perhaps the most ubiqui-
tous articles of clothing on college campuses. What is 
the environmental impact of each of these t-shirts?
Consider a t-shirt constructed of a cotton/polyester 
blend, weighing about four ounces. Polyester is made 
from petroleum—a few tablespoons are required to 
make a t-shirt. During the extraction and reﬁning of 
the petroleum, one-fourth of the polyester’s weight is 
released in air pollution, including nitrogen oxides, par-
ticulates, carbon monoxide, and heavy metals. About 
10 times the polyester’s weight is released in carbon 
dioxide, contributing to global climate change.
Cotton grown with nonorganic methods relies 
heavily on chemical inputs. Cotton accounts for 10 
percent of the world’s use of pesticides. A typical 
cotton crop requires six applications of pesticides, 
commonly organophosphates that can damage the 
central nervous system. Cotton is also one of the most 
intensely irrigated crops in the world.
T-shirt fabric is bleached and dyed with chemicals 
including chlorine, chromium, and formaldehyde. 
Cotton resists coloring, so about one-third of the dye 
may be carried off in the waste stream. Most t-shirts 
are manufactured in Asia and then shipped by boat 
to their destination, with further transportation by train 
and truck. Each transportation step involves the re-
lease of additional air pollution and carbon dioxide.
Despite the impacts of t-shirt production and distribu-
tion, most of the environmental impact associated with t-
shirts occurs after purchase. Washing and drying a t-shirt 
10 times requires about as much energy as was needed 
to manufacture the shirt. Laundering will also generate 
more solid waste than the production of the shirt, mainly 
from sewage sludge and detergent packaging.
How can one reduce the environmental impacts of 
t-shirts? One obvious step is to avoid buying too many 
shirts in the ﬁrst place. Buy shirts made of organic 
cotton or recycled polyester or consider buying used 
clothing. Wash clothes only when they need washing, 
not necessarily every time you wear something. Make 
sure that you wash only full loads of laundry and wash 
using cold water whenever possible. Finally, avoid us-
ing a clothes dryer—clothes dry naturally for free by 
hanging on a clothesline or a drying rack.

CHAPTER 9 — CONSUMPTION AND THE CONSUMER SOCIETY
4.2 GREEN CONSUMERISM
Green consumerism means making consumption decisions at least partly on the basis of 
environmental criteria. Clearly, green consumerism is increasing: More people are recycling, 
using reusable shopping bags and water containers, buying hybrid cars, and so on. Yet some 
people see green consumerism as an oxymoron—that the culture of consumerism is simply 
incompatible with environmental sustainability.
Whether green consumerism is an oxymoron depends on exactly how we deﬁne it. Green 
consumerism comes in two basic types:
1. “shallow” green consumerism: consumers seek to purchase “ecofriendly” alternatives but 
do not necessarily change their overall level of consumption
2. “deep” green consumerism: consumers seek to purchase ecofriendly alternatives but also, 
more importantly, seek to reduce their overall level of consumption
Someone who adheres to shallow green consumerism might buy a hybrid car instead of 
a car with a gasoline engine or a shirt made with organic cotton instead of cotton grown 
with the use of chemical pesticides. But those who practice deep green consumerism would, 
when feasible, take public transportation instead of buying a car and question whether they 
really need another shirt. In other words, in shallow green consumerism the emphasis is on 
substitution while in deep green consumerism the emphasis is on a reduction in consumption. 
Note that people who buy so-called ecofriendly products such that their overall consumption 
increases, or as status symbols, could hardly be said to be practicing green consumerism.
Ecolabeling helps consumers make environmentally conscious decisions. An ecolabel can 
provide summary information about environmental impacts. For example, stickers on new 
cars in the United States rate the vehicle’s smog emissions, on a scale from one to ten. More 
commonly, ecolabels are placed on products that meet certain certiﬁcation standards. One 
example is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Energy Star program, which certiﬁes 
products that are highly energy efﬁcient. The Forest Stewardship Council, headquartered in 
Germany, certiﬁes wood products that meet certain sustainability standards.
In addition to environmental awareness by consumers, many businesses are seeking to 
reduce the environmental impacts of their production processes. Of course, some of the 
motivation may be to increase proﬁts or improve public relations, but companies are also

becoming more transparent about their environmental impacts. The Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI) is a nonproﬁt organization that promotes a standardized approach to environmental 
impact reporting. In 2011 more than 2,300 companies used the GRI methodology, including 
Coca-Cola, Walmart, Apple, UPS, and Verizon.
Discussion Questions
1. Think about one product you have purchased recently that is not mentioned in the text. 
Try to list the environmental impacts of this product, considering the production, con-
sumption, and eventual disposal of it. What steps do you think could be taken to reduce 
the environmental impacts associated with this product?
2. Do you think that green consumerism is an oxymoron? Do you think that your own con-
sumer behaviors are environmentally sustainable? Why or why not?
5. CONSUMPTION AND WELL-BEING
If the goal of economics is to enhance well-being, as we discussed in Chapter 1, then we need 
to ask whether current levels of consumerism are compatible with well-being goals. If not, 
then what should we do about it?
5.1 DOES MONEY BUY HAPPINESS?
Earlier in the chapter, we mentioned that utility is a somewhat vague concept, one that 
cannot be easily measured quantitatively. But a large volume of scientiﬁc research in 
the past few decades suggests that we actually can obtain meaningful data on well-being 
rather simply—just by asking people about their well-being. Data on subjective well-
being (SWB) can provide insight into social welfare levels and the factors that inﬂuence 
well-being.
Collecting data on SWB involves surveying individuals and asking them a question such 
as: “All things considered, how satisﬁed are you with your life as a whole these days?” 
Respondents then answer based on a scale, say, from 1 (dissatisﬁed) to 10 (satisﬁed). How 
much credence can we give to the answers to such questions?
Research has shown that it is possible to collect meaningful and reliable data on 
subjective as well as objective well-being. Quantitative measures of [SWB] hold the 
promise of delivering not just a good measure of quality of life per se, but also a better 
understanding of its determinants, reaching beyond people’s income and material 
conditions. Despite the persistence of many unresolved issues, these subjective measures 
provide important information about quality of life.25
One of most interesting questions that SWB research can address is the relationship between 
income level and life satisfaction. We can ask whether the higher-income individuals in a 
society tend to have higher average SWB. A 2010 paper, based on the results of more than 
400,000 surveys conducted in the United States, found that higher income does tend to be 
associated with higher SWB, but at a decreasing rate.26 This ﬁnding is consistent with the 
concept of diminishing marginal utility; additional income does increase utility, but each 
additional dollar tends to result in smaller utility gains. It is also consistent with the idea that 
people evaluate themselves relative to others.
The paper went on to measure well-being in a different way, referred to as “emotional 
well-being,” which asks people to describe the positive and negative emotions that they feel 
on a daily basis. In this case, higher income was associated with more positive, and fewer 
negative, emotions, again at a decreasing rate, but only up to a point. At an income level 
of around $75,000, further increases in income did not improve emotional well-being. The 
subjective well-be-
ing (SWB): a mea-
sure of welfare based 
on survey questions 
asking people about 
their own degree of 
life satisfaction

208 
CHAPTER 9 — CONSUMPTION AND THE CONSUMER SOCIETY
authors conclude that “high income buys life satisfaction but not happiness, and that low 
income is associated both with low life evaluation and low emotional well-being.”
Other research has explored how people’s values and goals affect their well-being. 
Psychologist Tim Kasser and his colleagues have studied the mental and physical consequences 
of holding materialistic values. They have used surveys to determine how strongly oriented 
different people are toward ﬁnancial and material goals, by asking whether it is important 
that, for example, they “be ﬁnancially successful,” “have a lot of expensive possessions,” 
and “keep up with fashions in hair and clothing.” Respondents were also asked about their 
SWB, as well as questions about how often they experience negative mental and physical 
symptoms such as depression, anxiety, headaches, and stomachaches. Based on results for 
both college students and older adults, their results were clear:
[Those] who focused on money, image, and fame reported less self-actualization and 
vitality, and more depression than those less concerned with these values. What is more, 
they also reported experiences of physical symptoms. . . . This was really one of the 
ﬁrst indicators, to us, of the pervasive negative correlates of materialistic values—not 
only is people’s psychological well-being worse when they focus on money, but so is 
their physical health.27
Additional research by Kasser and others ﬁnds that people who hold materialistic values 
tend to be less happy with their family and friends, have less fun, are more likely to abuse 
drugs and alcohol, and to display antisocial symptoms such as paranoia and narcissism.
For some individuals, consumerism itself can be addictive. According to a 2006 paper, 
about 6 percent of Americans are considered compulsive shoppers.28 This is similar to the 
percentage of Americans considered alcoholics. People are classiﬁed as compulsive shoppers 
based on their answers to questions about whether they went on shopping binges, bought 
things without realizing why, had ﬁnancial problems as a result of their spending, or frequently 
bought things to improve their mood. Compulsive shoppers were just as likely to be men 
as women, but they tended to be younger than average and have a lower income than the 
average. Compulsive shoppers are more likely to experience depression and anxiety, suffer 
from eating disorders, and have ﬁnancial problems.
5.2 AFFLUENZA AND VOLUNTARY SIMPLICITY
Economists have traditionally assumed that more income and more goods are always better, 
holding all else constant. But we can never hold all else constant. One of the main lessons 
of economics is that we should always weigh the marginal beneﬁts of something against its 
marginal costs. In the case of consumerism, these costs include less time for leisure, friends, 
and family, greater environmental impacts, and negative psychological and physical effects. 
In short, there can be such a thing as too much consumption—when the marginal beneﬁts of 
additional consumption are exceeded by the associated marginal costs.
As we have seen, people tend to evaluate themselves relative to other people. The situation 
of rising consumption levels has been compared to one in which one row of a crowd of 
spectators stands up in order to see a show better. Then, the row behind them has to stand 
up, just in order to see as well as before. The same with the row behind them, and so on. 
Eventually, everyone is uncomfortable standing up, and no one is really seeing any better. 
Everyone would be better off just sitting down.
Economist Robert Frank discussed this problem in his 1999 book Luxury Fever. He suggests 
that the lavish spending of the superrich, whose incomes have increased dramatically in 
recent decades, creates pressure on the merely rich to ratchet up their spending as well. This 
pressure then eventually trickles down to middle- and even low-income individuals. Again, 
we must consider the cost of this competitive spending.

 
CONSUMPTION AND WELL-BEING 
209
Even among those who can easily afford today’s luxury offerings, there has been a 
price to pay. All of us—rich and poor alike, but especially the rich—are spending 
more time at the ofﬁce and taking shorter vacations; we are spending less time with 
our families and friends; and we have less time for sleep, exercise, travel, reading, and 
other activities that help maintain body and soul. . . . At a time when our spending on 
luxury goods is growing four times as fast as overall spending, our highways, bridges, 
water supply systems, and other parts of our public infrastructure are deteriorating, 
placing lives in danger.29
Two public television specials, as well as a book,30 refer to the problem of “afﬂuenza”—a 
“disease” with symptoms of “overload, debt, anxiety and waste resulting from the dogged 
pursuit of more.” The use of reference groups creates a paradox in consumption: We can 
apparently never have enough to be satisﬁed, because (unless we are Bill Gates) there is 
always someone who has more than we do.
Some people see the solution to afﬂuenza as rejecting consumerism as a primary goal in 
life. The term voluntary simplicity refers to a conscious decision to live with a limited or 
reduced level of consumption, in order to increase one’s quality of life.
[W]e can describe voluntary simplicity as a manner of living that is outwardly more 
simple and inwardly more rich. . . . Simplicity in this sense is not simple. To maintain 
a skillful balance between the inner and outer aspects of our lives is an enormously 
challenging and continuously changing process. The objective is not dogmatically to 
live with less, but is a more demanding intention of living with balance in order to ﬁnd 
a life of greater purpose, fulﬁllment, and satisfaction.31
The motivations for voluntary simplicity vary, including environmental concerns, a 
desire to have more free time to travel or raise a family, and to focus on nonconsumer goals. 
Voluntary simplicity does not necessarily mean rejecting progress, living in the country, or 
a life of poverty. Some people ascribing to voluntary simplicity have left high-paying jobs 
after many years, while others are young people content to live on less.
Perhaps the unifying theme for those practicing voluntary simplicity is that they seek 
to determine what is “enough”—a point beyond which further accumulation of consumer 
goods is either not worth the personal, ecological, and social costs, or simply not desirable. 
Unlike traditional economics, which has assumed that people always want more goods and 
services,* voluntary simplicity sees these as only intermediate goals toward more meaningful 
ﬁnal goals. (For more on voluntary simplicity, see Box 9.3.)
5.3 CONSUMPTION AND PUBLIC POLICY
It is unrealistic to expect that a majority of people in rich countries will become adherents 
of voluntary simplicity. If we accept that overconsumption is problematic, for reasons of 
ecological impacts, social cohesion, or personal well-being, then we must consider whether 
government regulations are needed to curb consumerism.
Of course, some people will argue that government intrusion into personal consumption 
decisions is unwarranted. But current government regulations already inﬂuence consumer 
decisions, for instance, high taxes on products such as tobacco and alcohol and limits on 
advertising. Rather than dictating consumer behaviors, thoughtful regulations can encourage 
people to make choices that better align with social and personal well-being. A 2009 book 
titled Nudge proposes that changing the “choice architecture”—how choices are presented to 
people—can have a dramatic inﬂuence on people’s behavior.32 Often this relates to changing 
voluntary simplic-
ity: a conscious 
decision to live with 
limited or reduced 
level of consumption, 
in order to increase 
one’s quality of life
*Economists use the term “nonsatiation” to describe the tendency to always want more.

CHAPTER 9 — CONSUMPTION AND THE CONSUMER SOCIETY
the default option for a particular choice. For example, employees’ retirement savings increase 
signiﬁcantly when they are automatically enrolled in a 401(k) savings program, with the 
option of dropping out if they so choose (an opt-out program), as opposed to a policy that 
requires them to sign up for the savings program (an opt-in program). People are still entirely 
free to decide whether to participate in the savings program, but the opt-out option results 
in more savings for retirement. 
Flexible Work Hours
One speciﬁc policy to reduce the pressure toward consumerism is to allow for more ﬂexibil-
ity in working hours. Current employment norms, particularly in the United States, create a 
strong incentive for full-time employment, if available. Employees typically have the option 
of seeking either a full-time job, with decent pay and fringe beneﬁts, or a part-time job with 
lower hourly pay and perhaps no beneﬁts at all. Thus even those who would prefer to work 
less than full time and make a somewhat lower salary may feel the imperative to seek full-
time employment. With a full-time job, working longer hours with higher stress, one may be 
more likely to engage in “retail therapy” as compensation.
Europe is leading the way in instituting policies that allow ﬂexible working arrangements. 
Legislation in Germany and the Netherlands gives workers the right to reduce their work 
hours, with a comparable reduction in pay.33 An employer can only refuse such requests if 
it can demonstrate that the reduction will impose serious hardship on the ﬁrm. A Dutch law 
also prohibits discrimination between full-time and part-time employees regarding hourly 
pay, beneﬁts, and advancement opportunities. Some government policies encourage part-time 
employment particularly for parents, such as a Swedish law that gives parents the right to 
work three-quarter time until their children are eight years old. Norwegian parents also have 
the right to work part-time or combine periods of work with periods of parental leave.
Such policies encourage “time afﬂuence” instead of material afﬂuence. Economist Juliet 
Schor also argues that policies to allow for shorter work hours are one of the most effective 
ways to address environmental problems such as climate change.34 Those who voluntarily 
BOX 9.3 VOLUNTARY SIMPLICITY
Greg Foyster had a good job in advertising, creating 
television commercials and print ads in Australia. But 
in 2012 he and his partner Sophie Chishkovsky de-
cided to give up their consumer lifestyles and bicycle 
along the coast of Australia, interviewing people who 
have decided to embrace voluntary simplicity and 
eventually write a book about their experience.
Voluntary simplicity is a growing movement in 
Australia, with a popular Web site (www.aussiesliv-
ingsimply.com.au) and a regular column on the 
topic in the Australian Women’s Weekly. Foyster 
explains, 
The overall idea is that you should step out of the 
consumer economy that we’re all plugged into and 
start doing things for yourself because that is how 
you’ll ﬁnd happiness. The best way to think of it is 
as an exchange. In our society people trade their 
time for money, and then they spend that money on 
consumer items. . . . It’s really about stepping back 
and deciding what’s important to you in your life.
Foyster found that his career in advertising conﬂicted 
with his personal sense of ethics. His “eureka” moment 
came during an advertising awards event when he saw 
colleagues being praised for their efforts to sell people 
products they didn’t need or even want. He realized 
that most of the world’s environmental problems stem 
from overconsumption, not overpopulation. He was 
so overwhelmed that he left the event and sobbed. 
He says, 
When I worked in advertising, I had a decent 
income, I had a prestigious job, and I was miser-
able. I chose to leave the industry because it wasn’t 
making me happy; it wasn’t my purpose in life. 
And now I have a much lower income; I work as 
a freelance writer, which isn’t the most prestigious 
job. But I am so much more happy because I know 
what is important to me and I’m doing what I love 
and I have everything I need.

decide to work shorter hours will be likely to consume less and thus have a smaller ecological 
footprint.
Advertising Regulations
A second policy approach is to focus on the regulation of advertising. Government regulations 
in most countries already restrict the content and types of ads that are allowed, such as the 
prohibition of cigarette advertising on television and sporting events. Additional regulations 
could expand truth-in-advertising laws, ensuring that all claims made in ads are valid. For 
example, laws in the United States already restrict what foods can be labeled “low fat” or 
“organic.”
Children are particularly susceptible to advertising, as they generally cannot differentiate 
between entertainment and an ad intended to influence consumers. Again, European 
regulations are leading the way. Sweden and Norway have banned all advertising targeted 
at children under 12 years old. Regulations in Germany and Belgium prohibit commercials 
during children’s TV shows.
Another option is to change the tax regulations regarding advertising expenditures. In the 
United States, companies are generally able to fully deduct all advertising costs. Restricting 
the amount of this tax deduction (or eliminating the deduction entirely) would create an 
incentive for companies to reduce their advertising.
Consumption Taxation
Economics tells us that one of the ways to reduce the extent of any activity is to tax it. One 
option is to impose luxury taxes on speciﬁc goods that are seen as representing conspicuous 
consumption—consumption primarily for the display of high economic status. For example, 
from 1992 to 2002 the United States imposed luxury taxes on new automobiles that cost 
more than $30,000. Australia still collects a luxury tax on new vehicles that sell for more 
than about $60,000.
Rather than classifying particular goods and services as luxuries, some economists prefer 
broader tax reforms. In Luxury Fever, Robert Frank proposes replacing the current emphasis 
in the United States on taxing income with taxes on consumption. Under his proposal, the tax 
on a household would be determined by the amount it spends each year. Rather than saving 
receipts, taxpayers would calculate their annual spending simply as the difference between 
total income and savings. A certain amount of spending would be exempt from taxation so 
that low-income households would be exempt from the tax—Frank suggests $30,000 per 
family. Beyond that, consumption would be taxed at successively higher rates. For example, 
while the ﬁrst $30,000 of spending would be nontaxable, he suggests that the next $40,000 of 
spending be taxed at a 20 percent rate. Then the next $10,000 of spending might be taxed at 
a 22 percent rate. In his example, consumption tax rates on spending above $500,000 rise to 
70 percent.* He argues that such high tax rates on conspicuous consumption are necessary:
If a progressive consumption tax is to curb the waste that springs from excessive 
spending on conspicuous consumption, its rates at the highest levels must be sufﬁciently 
steep to provide meaningful incentives for the people atop the consumption pyramid. 
For unless their spending changes, the spending of those just below them is unlikely 
to change either, and so on all the way down.35 
Frank notes that both conservatives and liberals have expressed support for a shift 
from taxation of income to taxation of consumption, although they disagree on the details. 
*A progressive tax imposes higher tax rates with higher income levels. We discuss progressive taxation in more detail in 
Chapter 12.

212 
CHAPTER 9 — CONSUMPTION AND THE CONSUMER SOCIETY
Exempting all savings from taxation would increase savings rates, which he suggests is 
reason enough for the shift. But the main objective would be to reduce the pressures toward 
consumerism and promote true well-being.
We currently waste literally trillions of dollars each year as a result of wasteful 
consumption patterns. Much of this waste can be curbed by the adoption of a steeply 
progressive consumption tax. Taking this step would greatly enhance every citizen’s 
opportunity to pursue independent visions of the good life.36

APPENDIX: A FORMAL THEORY OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOR
A1. THE ASSUMPTIONS
This appendix presents in more detail the standard economic model of consumer behavior. In 
this model, the consumer is seeking to maximize his or her utility. The consumer is assumed 
to be well informed and rational and to consider only his or her own preferences, budget, 
and prices in making a consumption decision. For simplicity, we assume there are only two 
goods, good X and good Y.
A2. THE BUDGET LINE AND ITS SLOPE
The combinations of X and Y that are available to the household are shown by a budget line, 
like that in Figure 9.8. The budget line arises because the sum of the consumer’s expenditures 
must add up to—not exceed—the consumer’s income. Mathematically:
Pxx + Py y = Income
where x and y denote the quantities purchased of each good, and Px and Py are their respec-
tive prices. This equation can be rearranged, algebraically, into slope-intercept form (i.e., y 
= a + bx, where the intercept a gives the value of y when x equals 0, and b is the slope of 
the line). This yields:
y = Income – Px x
Py
Py
For example, in Figure 9.8, income could be $40, the price of X could be $10, and the price 
of Y could be $5. The budget line crosses the y-axis at 40/5 = 8 units of Y and has a slope of 
−10/5 = −2. In general, we note that the budget line has a slope equal to −Px / Py.

CHAPTER 9 — CONSUMPTION AND THE CONSUMER SOCIETY
A3. INDIFFERENCE CURVES
The consumer’s preferences concerning the two goods can be illustrated on the same graph by 
using the concept of indifference curves pioneered by the economist Paul Samuelson.
Indifference curves show combinations of the two goods with which the consumer 
would be equally satisﬁed (i.e., has the same utility). Indifference curves are generally 
thought to have the bowed-in-toward-the-origin shape shown in Figure 9.9. This shape 
arises because we assume that the consumer experiences diminishing marginal utility 
for both X and Y.
Suppose the consumer starts out at point A, with a large amount of Y (7 units) but relatively 
little of X (only 1 unit). At point A, the consumer has a fairly low marginal utility of Y, because 
she is already consuming a lot of it, and a fairly high marginal utility of X, because she has 
only a little of it. (Refer to the shape of Figure 9.4 if necessary. Utility ﬂattens out if you have 
a lot of a good and rises steeply if you have little.) She will be willing to give up some of the 
Y—marginal units from which she is getting relatively little utility, anyway—to get more of 
X, a good that still has fairly high marginal utility. If she is just willing to give up 3 units of 
good Y to get 1 additional unit of good X, then she is indifferent between point A and point 
B. The slope of the indifference curve can be mathematically shown to be equal to −MUx /
MUy, where MUx is the marginal utility of X and MUy is the marginal utility of Y. As we see 
on the graph, the slope of the indifference curve between point A and point B is −3 (rise/run 
on a straight line between the points = −3/1). The ratio of marginal utilities, MUx /MUy is 
called the marginal rate of substitution, which tells how much of one good the consumer 
is willing to give up to get more of the other.
However, at point B, the consumer’s marginal utility from good Y will have risen from 
what it was at point A, because she is consuming less of it. Meanwhile, her marginal utility 
from X will have fallen, because she is consuming more of it. She will be more reluctant 
to give up more units of Y in exchange for further units of X. Likewise, because she is now 
consuming more X, she is less eager to get more of it than she was before. This means that if 
she is presented with further opportunities to trade, she will demand more X to compensate 
her for giving up any more Y. If forced to give up 2 more units of Y, Figure 9.9 shows that 
she will now require 3 more units of X to keep her just as happy. The slope of the indifference 
curve between point B and point C is –2/3, and the marginal rate of substitution is now 2/3. 
Indifference curves tend to be steep at low levels of consumption of X and then ﬂatten out 
as you move to the right, as a consequence of diminishing marginal utility. Thus we have a 
falling marginal rate of substitution.

A4. UTILITY MAXIMIZATION
Different levels of utility are represented by different indifference curves. Because the standard 
economic view assumes that consumers always want more of at least one good (and usually 
of both goods), this “more is better” assumption means that utility rises as you move upward 
and to the right on the graph. Figure 9.10 shows three examples of indifference curves, cor-
responding to three different levels of utility.
The consumer’s problem, then, is to get to the highest level of utility possible, given her 
budget. This problem and its solution are illustrated in Figure 9.11. The consumer can afford 
many points on the lowest indifference curve—much of the curve lies below and to the left 
of the budget line. If she chose to consume at point C, she would use up all her budget. But 
this is not the best that she can do. Points A and B would both give her more utility than 
point C, and point D would give her even more. Points B and D are unobtainable, however, 
because they are above the budget line.

The consumer’s utility is maximized by choosing 
a consumption point on the highest achievable 
indifference curve. This happens at point A. 
Moving above and to the right, indifference curves 
represent higher levels of utility.
The best the consumer can do is get onto the indifference curve that just touches his budget 
line, at point A, purchasing 4 units of Y and 2 units of X. At point A, the two curves just touch 
and have the same slope. That is:
– MUx = – Px
MUy
Py
which can be algebraically rearranged into:
MUx = MUy
Px
Py
This equation states that the consumer will maximize her utility when the marginal utility per 
dollar spent on X is equal to the marginal utility per dollar spent on Y. If this were not true, and the 
last dollar spent on good X produced more utility than the last dollar spent on good Y, the consumer 
could increase her utility by switching a dollar from Y to X. She can continue to increase her utility 
in this manner until the last dollar spent on each good provides similar marginal utility.

218 
CHAPTER 9 — CONSUMPTION AND THE CONSUMER SOCIETY
If we add a third good, Z, or as many as we want, the rule remains the same. To 
maximize utility, a consumer should equate the marginal utility per dollar spent for all 
goods, or:
MUx = MUy = MUz = . . .
Px
Py
Pz
A5. RESPONSE TO VARIATIONS IN PRICE
We can also use a utility theory graph to theorize about consumer response to a price change. 
For example, Figure 9.12 shows what might happen if the price of X drops from $10 to $5 
(with income held constant at $40). Now the budget line is higher at all points, except where 
it meets the y-axis. The consumer is thus able to afford more of the goods than before and to 
reach a higher indifference curve. The consumer portrayed in Figure 9.12 will now choose 
to consume at point B.
Given the assumptions of this model, it is clear that the consumer has higher utility after 
the fall in price. Generally, it will be true that consumers will buy more of a good when its 
price falls. In Figure 9.12, we see that point B is farther to the right than point A.
This is one of the rationales for the downward-sloping demand curve discussed in Chapter 
4 on supply and demand. By no means, however, is it the only explanation. First, downward-
sloping demand curves may be a useful tool for analyzing the behavior of many other kinds of 
buyers, such as businesses, nonproﬁts, and governments. The foregoing is not an explanation 
for their behavior. Second, the tool of utility theory is not necessary for deriving demand 
curves. In a 1962 article, economist Gary Becker showed that market purchases of a good 
will tend to rise when prices fall, even if consumers act only impulsively or out of habit.
What happens to the level of purchases of good Y when the price of good X falls? This is 
hard to predict without knowing more about the particular goods. This question was discussed 
under the topics of “substitutes” and “complements” in Chapter 4.

10 Markets for Labor
When you next look for a job—during the summer, perhaps during the school year, or after 
you graduate from college—what characteristics will you be seeking in your job? Some pos-
sibilities include: good pay, opportunities for advancement, opportunities for learning, doing 
a variety of interesting activities, a feeling that you are contributing something of value, and 
a comfortable and congenial work environment.
And what will you want to avoid? Studies of human happiness ﬁnd that one of the leading 
causes of dissatisfaction in modern life is a long commute. Other things that are generally 
not preferred include work that is dangerous, dirty, or physically uncomfortable, mindlessly 
repetitive, or exhausting. Low pay is generally a disincentive, as is a lack of beneﬁts such as 
health care and paid vacations.
Traditionally, economics has been most concerned with understanding the compensation 
attached to different jobs. We will see that some of the other characteristics of work just mentioned 
may have some impact on compensation—and are of importance in their own right as well.
1. LABOR IN THE TRADITIONAL NEOCLASSICAL MODEL
“The labor market” is a familiar phrase, but markets for labor are different from other markets 
in many ways. For a start, consider what is sold in a labor market. It is not human beings; 
slavery, one of the worst practices in human history, is illegal everywhere in the world (al-
though it still exists, even in developed countries). Rather, what is sold in labor markets is 
what is sometimes called “labor power”—that is, what a given person is able and willing to 
do in a given amount of time. An employer who hires a certain amount of labor power (X 
number of people working for Y hours) expects that it will produce a certain level of output. 
But it is not the actual output that is being purchased in this market—it is the contribution 
that employees make toward the production of output. This makes labor markets somewhat 
more abstract than markets for the things that labor can directly produce, such as sweaters, 
jet planes, or a sales pitch over the telephone.
We examine some unique characteristics of labor markets and some of the factors that 
determine the level of earnings for different kinds of jobs. However, we start with a familiar 
supply-and-demand picture as a point of reference. The very simple neoclassical model that 
we discussed in Chapter 8, for the most part, treats the demand for and supply of labor very 
much like other things that are bought and sold on markets. Labor, in this model, is demanded 
by proﬁt-maximizing ﬁrms and is supplied by utility-maximizing households. The stylized 
utility-maximizing consumers who were described in Chapter 9 are now simply dressed in 
overalls or suits and sent into the workplace, with the single goal of earning the money that 
will allow them to be consumers.
On the side of the demander—the ﬁrm—this model assumes a number of characteristics 
that are not usually found in the real world: for example, that all ﬁrms are powerless entities 

220 
CHAPTER 10 — MARKETS FOR LABOR
forced by competition to maximize proﬁts and minimize costs; that productivity can be easily 
measured; and that historical and social contexts can be ignored. (Markets with powerless 
ﬁrms are described in Chapter 17; more realistic markets are described in Chapter 18.)
The traditional model, which we quickly survey, describes how these sets of actors make 
decisions about how much labor will be supplied and purchased, and at what price (wage).
1.1 LABOR DEMAND
On the demand side of the labor market, consider a ﬁrm seeking to hire a speciﬁc type of labor. 
What should guide the ﬁrm’s decisions about how much labor to hire? From the viewpoint of 
a proﬁt-maximizing ﬁrm, an additional person-hour of labor will be desirable if it increases 
proﬁts, but not otherwise. Hiring an additional person-hour does two contradictory things to 
the ﬁrm’s proﬁt position:
s  Costs are raised by the amount of the additional wages paid.
s  2EVENUE IS INCREASED BY THE VALUE OF THE INCREASE IN OUTPUT PRODUCED BY THE ADDITIONAL HOUR of work.
Clearly, as long as the ﬁrm gets more additional revenue than it has to pay out in additional 
wages, it should keep hiring workers. But if it is getting less in additional revenue than it 
is paying out in additional wages, it should reduce the number of workers that it hires. The 
proﬁt-maximizing decision rule for the ﬁrm can thus be expressed as:
MRPL = MFCL
where MRPL is the marginal revenue product of labor, or the amount that an additional 
unit of labor contributes to revenues, and MFCL is the marginal factor cost of labor, or the 
amount that the additional unit of labor adds to the ﬁrm’s wage costs.*
In other words, the ﬁrm should hire additional units of labor until the marginal beneﬁts 
just equal the marginal costs. We will see very similar reasoning in Chapter 17, concerning a 
ﬁrm’s decision about how much to produce—for exactly the same reasons. A formal derivation 
of this rule is described in the appendix to this chapter.
If the ﬁrm buys labor services in a competitive market, MFCL will simply be the 
competitively determined market wage, and the rule will simplify to:
MRPL = Wage
The traditional neoclassical model offers an elegant solution for this simpliﬁed case. It 
gives a formalized statement of the intuitive sense that workers should be rewarded in relation 
to their contribution to the organization. However, actual measurement of productivity is 
difﬁcult. Moreover, the market valuation of a production process—its direct outputs and its 
side effects—can differ from social valuations because of externalities and distributional 
issues. Hence, you must be careful about inferring that, in the real world, any observed wage 
accurately represents the worker’s contribution to society’s well-being.
1.2 LABOR SUPPLY
The traditional model of consumer behavior presented in Chapter 9, in which consumers seek 
to maximize their utility, can be extended to decisions about labor supply. Speciﬁcally, we 
can consider how much time an individual is willing to work, given different wage levels. 
*Note that hiring an additional unit of labor may increase other costs, such as energy and supplies. These costs would be 
subtracted from the MRPL to determine the net increase in revenues associated with an additional unit of labor.
marginal revenue 
product of labor 
(MRPL): the amount 
that a unit of addi-
tional labor contrib-
utes to the revenues

tor cost of labor 
(MFCL): the amount 
that a unit of addi-
tional labor adds to 
the ﬁrm’s wage costs

 
LABOR IN THE TRADITIONAL NEOCLASSICAL MODEL 
221
In this model, the potential labor market participant is assumed to have perfect information 
and to be free to vary his or her hours of paid work. However, the labor market model dif-
fers from the model of consumer choice in that here the “budget line” is deﬁned according 
to the number of hours that the individual has available to “spend” on activities, rather than 
according to the amount of money that he or she has to spend on goods.
The model imagines essentially three kinds of activities:
s  PAID WORK
s  UNPAID WORK
s  LEISURE
Hours “spent” on paid labor result in wages, which in turn give opportunities for 
consumption. Hours spent on other activities yield utility either directly (as in the case of 
leisure) or indirectly through unpaid production. (In this model, paid work is generally assumed 
to yield no direct utility.) According to the model, the potential labor market participant will 
choose the level of labor market participation that maximizes his or her utility.
Two forces govern the supply of factors of production: the total quantity available at 
any point in time and the willingness of their owners to actually supply them. Labor is 
fundamentally “owned” by the individual, who may be thought of as renting out his or her 
services when working for pay. In many cases, actual decisions about supplying paid labor 
are made not by individuals but jointly with other household members, as part of a general 
plan for family support and investments for the future. Continuing with the simple model, 
however, for now we discuss paid labor supply as though an individual person is making 
the decision. Also, because this chapter discuses labor markets, we focus on labor that is 
performed in exchange for a wage or salary.
The Opportunity Cost of Paid Employment
In general, the willingness of an individual to supply work may be analyzed in terms of the 
wages and other beneﬁts that he or she can get, compared to the beneﬁts to him or her of not 
supplying it or supplying it elsewhere. An individual weighing these decisions is assessing 
the opportunity cost of labor supply. This idea may be applied broadly; the “costs” and the 
“beneﬁts” of supplying labor may be seen in terms of money but also reﬂect any other gains 
or losses that are valued by the individual.
Most of the alternatives facing an able-bodied adult who is considering going out to work 
for a wage or salary fall under the following headings:
s  Household production: A paid job may reduce the time that can be spent in productive 
but unpaid work at home—raising children, caring for elderly or sick relatives, cooking, 
keeping house, gardening, and the like.
s  Education: As an alternative to seeking paid work immediately, individuals may decide to 
stay in school or return to school—either to prepare for better-paid future employment or 
simply to enjoy the process of education or the life of a student.
s  Self-employment: People can work for themselves in household enterprises, making crafts, 
providing personal services (such as day care or yard work), writing, painting, or starting 
another home-based business. (The income of self-employed proprietors tends to be a mix 
of returns to labor, returns to capital, and proﬁts. In this chapter, we do not discuss the 
nature of their labor compensation because we are focusing only on people who work for 
wages or salaries.)
s  Leisure: Work cuts into the time available for playing music, ﬁshing, camping, reading 
novels, playing or watching sports, hanging out with friends, playing computer games, 
traveling, and other pleasurable activities.

222 
CHAPTER 10 — MARKETS FOR LABOR
To the extent that you value any of these pursuits and reduce the hours you devote to 
them when you take a paid job, that job has a “cost.” The cost is the lost opportunity for 
other activities. In addition to the opportunity costs associated with your time, you may incur 
direct monetary costs when taking a paid job, such as the costs of work-related clothing and 
transportation. You may incur increased monetary expenditures for things that otherwise 
might have been home-produced (using your time resources), such as child care and meal 
preparation.
The Beneﬁts of Paid Employment
At the same time, of course, paid jobs have many beneﬁts. Most obvious is the fact that they 
are paid. In a contemporary industrialized economy, households need some money income 
to survive and to participate in society. Even if paid work is unpleasant, boring, stressful, or 
even demeaning, wages and salaries are strong extrinsic motivators that encourage individu-
als to supply their labor.
In addition, however, paid work itself has great intrinsic signiﬁcance in most people’s lives. 
Evidence from state lotteries in the past few decades, for example, illustrates this point. In a 
number of cases, winners of large lottery prizes have decided not to quit their jobs entirely, 
even when they could easily have done so. They usually cite their friendships on the job and 
the sense of identity that they have found in their work as reasons for continuing at least 
some of their usual work activities. For billions of people, the nature of the work experience 
is a decisive part of the quality of life: The work process determines whether a major part 
of life will be boring or interesting, lonely or companionable, comfortable or ﬁlled with 
bodily discomfort, tranquil or full of anxiety, stunts personal growth or offers opportunities 
to develop mental or physical capacities.
Household production and self-employment can also supply many of the same intrinsic rewards, 
though often with less companionship and social interaction. Sometimes, people who only work 
at unpaid household production activities feel marginalized due to a social perception that only 
work for wages or salaries is “real work.” Again, we focus on paid work in this chapter, but we 
recognize that many people provide valuable contributions to society without being paid.
1.3 THE INDIVIDUAL PAID LABOR SUPPLY CURVE
We look at the decision of an individual to supply various amounts of hours over a week or 
year, assuming, for the moment, that the worker can ﬁnd part-time, full-time, or overtime paid 
jobs that satisfy his or her desires. For now, we also abstract from a worker’s choices among 
different kinds of paid jobs, focusing only on the decision about how much time to put into paid 
work. As in many other supply curve thought experiments, we abstract from all considerations 
other than the relationship between price and quantity. In this case, we look only at the effect 
of different wage levels on the individual’s willingness to supply labor to the market.
In Figure 10.1 we show an upward-sloping supply curve like those presented for markets 
for coffee in Chapter 4. The “wage,” which we use as a shorthand term for the price paid for 
an hour of labor, is on the vertical axis. In practice, many blue-collar and service jobs pay 
an hourly wage, whereas professional and managerial jobs tend to pay a weekly or monthly 
salary independent of how many hours they actually work. Jobs may also pay in the form of 
tips, bonuses, or stock options, and they may provide fringe beneﬁts such as health insurance. 
For our simple supply-and-demand analysis, we include all these in the concept of a “wage.” 
The quantity of labor, which might be thought of as the number of hours that the individual 
works in a week or a year, is on the horizontal axis.
Does this “usual” curve apply to labor? Following one line of reasoning, we can see that in 
many cases it does. From the perspective of an individual, the upward-sloping supply curve 
reﬂects the substitution effect of changes in prices: Individuals decide whether to substitute 
the beneﬁts of paid work for the beneﬁts of other activities. When offered a very low wage, 

 
LABOR IN THE TRADITIONAL NEOCLASSICAL MODEL 
223
an individual may be reluctant to join the labor market, or to supply many hours of work, 
because he or she may get more beneﬁts from self-employment or other activities. The higher 
the market wage rate, the more attractive it is to engage in additional paid labor instead of 
unpaid household work, education, self-employment, or leisure.*
However, one of the important reasons that an individual works is to earn an income, which 
in turn is used to buy goods and services that he or she can then enjoy. As the wage gets higher 
and higher, will the person always want to work more and more? Probably not. Economists 
explain this in terms of the fact that leisure (and perhaps other unpaid activities) are usually 
“normal goods,” in the sense explained in Chapter 5. As people earn higher incomes, they 
may also want more time to enjoy the fruits of their labor. The rising wage also has an income 
effect: The higher the market wage, the more leisure (and other unpaid activities) that people 
might want to “buy.” Because “buying” leisure means reducing work hours, the paid labor 
supply curve will be downward-sloping if the income effect is dominant.
People may have a target level of income in mind, beyond which they have less need for 
additional money. As we saw in Chapter 9, workers early in the industrial era often had such 
income targets. Increases in wages above the traditional level led individuals to take longer 
weekends and offer fewer hours of work the next week. Today such extreme cases of income 
“targeting” are rare, but there still is a tendency for some people to reduce their hours of work 
as their income rises. In such a case, the substitution effect may dominate at low wage levels, 
but the income effect dominates at high wage levels. The result is a backward-bending 
individual paid labor supply curve, as shown in Figure 10.2.
Figure 10.1 Upward-Sloping Labor Supply Curve
*We are assuming that the potential worker can enjoy at least a minimal standard of living from activities other than 
market work when the wage is too low to make market work attractive. In situations of dire poverty, however, this may not be 
the case, and people may need to work two or three jobs at very low wages just to get by.

224 
CHAPTER 10 — MARKETS FOR LABOR
The presence of the income effect makes individual paid labor supply different from the 
usual supply curves of businesses or other economic actors. As businesses or nonproﬁts 
rarely have a target level of revenues, they will display no income effect. Usually, even if 
high revenues allow some employees to enjoy more leisure (e.g., the founder might cut back 
on his or her work hours), the organization as a whole will expand its operations, perhaps 
by hiring more people.
1.4 HOW THE STANDARD MODEL EXPLAINS VARIATIONS IN WAGES
Among the things that economists are especially eager to understand about labor markets are 
the reasons for differences in wages. Why do star basketball players make so much more than 
aerospace engineers, who earn so much more than preschool teachers? In addition, within the 
same job deﬁnition it is possible to ﬁnd workers who receive very different compensation, even 
though they seem to have equivalent qualiﬁcations. Are such patterns of wage differentials 
determined solely by the logic of markets? If not, what other forces affect them?
Some economists stress productivity differences as nearly the sole source of wage variation 
over the long run. This emphasis requires a number of assumptions: that people behave in a 
rational, purely self-interested way, that market forces are strong, and that markets are fully 
competitive. A high wage, in this view, is merely a sign that an individual is making a highly 
valued contribution.
The demand for labor—the employers’ willingness to pay for different types of labor 
services—is related to just how productive workers are. Employers generally are not willing 
to pay their workers more than the value that each one contributes to what the employer 
ﬁnally sells—what we have called marginal revenue product of labor. Employers who can get 
away with paying workers less than their MRPL are motivated to do so in order to minimize 
costs and therefore to maximize proﬁts. Theoretically, this should not be possible, if the labor 
market is truly competitive. In that case, workers who do not receive a “fair” wage in one 
place (a wage equal to their MRPL) can ﬁnd another employer who will offer the wage that 
actually represents the worker’s contribution to the value of output.
Human Capital
In the standard model, the main reason for variations in labor productivity and, hence, in 
wages is human capital. This consists of people’s knowledge and skills. It is affected by:
s  FORMAL EDUCATION AND JOBRELATED TRAINING
s  INFORMAL EDUCATION AND JOBRELATED EXPERIENCE
s  INNATE TALENTS
s  THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OF THE WORKER
Obviously, different kinds of jobs require different kinds of human capital. Different levels 
of human capital often result from different levels of investment, in terms of education and 
training. The wages for skilled occupations, such as aerospace engineers (e.g., compared to 
farm manual laborers), reﬂect in part the fact that aerospace engineers have normally engaged 
in formal training to acquire skills and credentials, whereas farm laborers largely use more 
common skills that, it is assumed, most people possess.
We can see the impact of education levels in Figure 10.3, which shows median earnings 
by education level in the United States. Those with a master’s degree earn about 22 percent 
more than those with just a bachelor’s degree, and those with a bachelor’s degree earn 63 
percent more than those with just a high school diploma.
*The last determinant of human capital is sometimes overlooked; however, malnourishment and mental or physical ill-
health can seriously affect a worker’s energy, motivation, and general capacity to use her or her knowledge and skills.

 
LABOR IN THE TRADITIONAL NEOCLASSICAL MODEL 
225
The income beneﬁts associated with education have increased in recent decades. For 
example, between 1975 and 1999 the ratio of average earnings of those with advanced degrees 
to those with a high school diploma increased from 1.8 to 2.6. According to analysis by the 
U.S. Census Bureau, the increase in the economic beneﬁts of education
may be explained by both the supply of labor and the demand for skilled workers. In 
the 1970s, the premiums paid to college graduates dropped because of an increase in 
their numbers, which kept the relative earnings range among the educational attainment 
levels rather narrow. Recently, however, technological changes favoring more skilled 
(and educated) workers have tended to increase earnings among working adults with 
higher educational attainment, while, simultaneously, the decline of labor unions and 
a decline in the minimum wage in constant dollars have contributed to a relative drop 
in the wages of less educated workers.1
In addition to formal education, human capital may also be accumulated through on-the-job 
training. For example, a more experienced farm laborer can do some of the work faster, or to 
a higher standard, and might therefore be paid more than a new hire. Human capital acquired 
on the job may be either general or employer-speciﬁc. General human capital consists of 
the knowledge and skills that workers can take with them if they leave one organization and 
go to work for another. Employer-speciﬁc human capital consists of knowledge and skills 
that are valued only by a particular employer. For example, many farming and engineering 
skills may be general, but knowledge about a speciﬁc piece of land or crop, or a speciﬁc 
engineering project, may be useless away from a particular employer.
How do employers judge the human capital embodied in a prospective worker? Ideally, 
before offering a wage, they should be able to assess which skills the worker possesses and 
how much these skills will contribute to productivity. Because this assessment is often difﬁcult 
to make, employers may use credentials, such as educational degrees or training certiﬁcates, as 
proxies for observed skills. A ﬁrm that is seeking to employ an aerospace engineer would look 
for someone with the appropriate degree. A college degree is a common screening method 
that employers use to limit their job search to speciﬁc candidates. Other screening methods 
used by employers include requirements that applicants have a minimum number of years of 
work experience, or certiﬁcation that they have been trained to do speciﬁc tasks.

CHAPTER 10 — MARKETS FOR LABOR
In a subtler, but also common, example, ﬁrms may require credentials such as a college 
degree, or even a graduate degree, not because they are convinced that the undergraduate 
or graduate education has directly provided essential knowledge or skills but because the 
possession of the degree signals that the person is a certain kind of worker. Educational 
credentials such as these are used by employers as reassurance that the applicant possesses 
desirable characteristics such as self-discipline, patience, and the ability to work under 
pressure. The signaling theory of the value of education suggests that the value of a college 
education may be not so much in the way it creates human capital as in how it solves 
information problems for employers, revealing, or signaling, what type of worker a person 
already was before starting college (or became during college).
Other Factors Affecting Productivity
A worker’s productivity may also depend on several factors that are at least somewhat under 
the control of the employer. These include:
s  The level of effort with which workers work: The workers’ level of effort on a job includes 
the pace at which they work, as well as how careful they are to do the job right. The level of 
work effort depends on employer management practices, such as rewards and punishments, 
but it may also depend on historical, cultural, personal, or other circumstances beyond the 
manager’s control.
s  The efﬁciency with which workers apply their skills: Management is also an important contribu-
tor to worker efﬁciency; a good manager can put each worker in the job that best suits his or her 
abilities, can see to it that work groups are organized in more rather than less efﬁcient ways, and 
can try to organize an optimal interaction of workers with the technology available to them.
s  The quantity and characteristics of the resources available to each worker: In the simplest 
terms, those who work with more, newer, and better technology and equipment, energy 
resources and materials, are more productive. A lack of the appropriate quantity or quality 
of resources can make even the most skilled and motivated worker unproductive.
Discussion Questions
1. Think of a job that you have held. Describe how your productivity on the job was af-
fected by:
a. your skills
b. the organization of the workplace (whether it encouraged efﬁciency)
c. your level of effort (and what it was about the job that encouraged this speciﬁc level 
of effort)
d. the resources you had available to work with
2. In any production process, when one factor limits what can be produced and other factors 
are in abundant supply, that one factor is called the limiting factor. Continue to reﬂect on 
the job that you considered in Question 1. Which contributor to productivity would you 
identify as the “limiting factor” in that case? What change would have been most effective 
in bringing about increased productivity?
2. LABOR SUPPLY AND DEMAND AT THE MARKET LEVEL
In order to think about labor markets in terms of supply and demand, we need to consider 
how labor supply at the individual level translates into labor supply at the market level. We 
start with a bit of history.
Since the early twentieth century, industrialized countries have shown a striking trend 
toward an increase in the (paid) labor force participation rate (deﬁned as the percentage 
of the adult, noninstitutionalized population that is either working at a paid job or seeking

paid work). In most countries, this increase has been accounted for entirely by the increasing 
labor force participation of women. The increase in women’s participation in the labor force 
has been partially offset by a small decline in men’s participation; most of the change for 
men has resulted from decisions to stay in school longer or to retire earlier.
If we think about these social trends in “opportunity cost” terms, we can see that they 
involve changing perceptions of the costs and beneﬁts of entering the paid labor market. The 
cost of this choice has declined as improved technologies for the home and the increased 
availability of substitute services (such as child care and prepared meals) have reduced the 
number of hours of household work strictly necessary to maintain a household. The beneﬁts 
have risen in societies where activism and changes in social norms and laws have opened a 
greater variety of paid occupations to women. The perceived beneﬁts have also risen to the 
extent that increased consumerism (discussed in Chapter 9) has encouraged people to focus 
more on making money at the expense of time for household production or leisure.
2.1 MARKET LABOR SUPPLY
The supply of labor to a particular market, such as the national market for aerospace engineers 
or the market for restaurant wait staff in Chicago, can be thought of as the horizontal sum 
of the supply curves of those individuals who could participate in the market. Although the 
supply curves of some individuals might bend backward, the supply curve for a particular 
market can generally be assumed to have the usual upward slope shown in Figure 10.1. This 
is because employers can obtain a larger quantity of labor in two ways. The ﬁrst is by persuad-
ing workers already in the market to supply more hours, in which case income effects could 
become important. The second way, however, is to attract more workers to enter the particular 
market, either by drawing them away from other jobs or by drawing them into the paid labor 
force from other activities. For most of these workers, we can assume that this substitution 
effect dominates, and so the aggregate supply curve will slope upward.
Market labor supply is relatively wage elastic if a variation in the wage brings a large 
change in the quantity of labor supplied. This could occur if the (upward-sloping sections of) 
individual worker’s supply curves are elastic. It also occurs when a rise in the wage readily 
draws more workers into the particular market. Markets for types of labor that use general 
or more easily acquired skills generally tend to have relatively elastic supply curves. If the 
wage for local restaurant wait staff rises, for example, people may leave jobs as salesclerks 
and delivery truck drivers in order to offer their services to restaurants. If the wages paid by 
restaurants fall, wait staff may fairly readily look for jobs as salesclerks and drivers.
Market labor supply is relatively wage inelastic, however, if a variation in the wage 
brings little change in the quantity of labor supplied. At the extreme, the supply of labor 
might be “ﬁxed” for some occupations, at least in the short run. For example, there are only 
so many aerospace engineers in the United States at any point in time. (What slope would 
the supply curve have?) Raising the wage might draw a few engineers out of retirement or 
self-employment, but it cannot instantly produce a large quantity of new engineers, because 
obtaining the skills necessary for this job requires many years of education. A drop in the 
wage, similarly, might not much decrease the quantity of labor supplied in the short run, 
because the engineers’ specialized skills are not valued nearly as much in other markets. 
Changes in the quantity supplied will occur only over the long run, as high wages attract more 
students to train for the job or low wages cause more engineers to become dissatisﬁed and 
retrain for something else. The United States has also used immigration policies to increase 
the quantity of labor supplied in certain high-skilled areas where there are labor shortages. 
(For a real-world example of a labor shortage, see Box 10.1.)
So far, we have discussed the responsiveness of quantity to price along a supply curve. 
Market labor supply curves can also shift, in response to nonprice factors, just like the shifts 
in other supply curves that we studied in Chapter 4. For the economy as a whole, for example, 

228 
CHAPTER 10 — MARKETS FOR LABOR
labor supply curves tend to shift outward over time because of population growth. Changes 
in laws and norms and in household technology caused the supply curve to shift outward in 
many areas when women joined men seeking employment in many high-skill markets such 
as law and medicine.
Changes in one labor market may also have repercussions in other markets. For example, 
a rise in the wages of salesclerks (a movement along the supply curve for salesclerks) might 
decrease the supply of wait staff (that is, shift the supply curve for wait staff back), as people 
exit the wait staff market in order to take advantage of the higher wages now being offered 
for salesclerks.
2.2 MARKET LABOR DEMAND
For the most part, the demanders of labor (i.e., potential employers) are organizations, 
including businesses, nonproﬁts, and governments. A very small fraction of employers are 
households or individuals, who may directly employ people for tasks such as in-home child 
care and domestic service.
The demand curve for paid labor—whether for an individual organization or for an 
entire market—can generally be thought of as downward sloping, like the demand curves 
we examined in previous chapters. The reason for the downward slope is as follows. When 
wages are high, employers have incentives to economize on the use of labor. They may cut 
back on their activities or try to substitute other inputs (e.g., another type of labor, machinery, 
or computerization) for the type of labor whose wage is high. But when wages are low, 
employers may be able to expand their productive activities or substitute relatively cheap 
labor for other inputs.
Labor demand will tend to be relatively wage elastic if there are good substitute inputs 
available and if the wage bill is a large proportion of total production costs (so that the employers 
are motivated to seek out substitutes). Labor demand will tend to be relatively inelastic if no 
good substitute inputs are available and the wage bill is a small proportion of total costs.
BOX 10.1 A SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS
Nevada is experiencing a shortage of doctors. 
According to a 2013 study by John Packham, a health 
policy researcher at the University of Nevada, the state 
has one of the lowest numbers of primary care physi-
cians per capita in the United States. Packham also 
notes a shortage of orthopedic and general surgeons, 
which will become more critical as the state’s popula-
tion ages. The impacts of the doctor shortage include 
longer wait times to get an appointment, higher costs, 
and lower-quality health care.
Many other regions of the United States are also 
experiencing a shortage of doctors, with this problem 
forecast to increase. According to the Association 
of American Medical Colleges, in 2015 the doctor 
shortage will reach 30,000. By the mid-2020s, the 
shortage will approach 70,000. One reason for this 
is that doctors have migrated to specialized, high-
paying ﬁelds such as dermatology and cardiology, 
instead of primary care and general surgery. Also, 
the demand for health care has increased due to an 
ageing population. Expanded health-care coverage 
under the Affordable Care Act (i.e., Obamacare) will 
also increase the demand for doctors.
On the supply side, the number of doctors is rela-
tively ﬁxed in the short term. It commonly takes about 
10 to 15 years from the time an undergraduate student 
decides to pursue a career as a doctor to the time he or 
she can actually start practicing. Thus the labor market 
for doctors is an example of a market that can persist 
in a condition of disequilibrium for many years.
In Nevada it is particularly difﬁcult to attract doctors 
to rural areas, particularly those with high minority 
populations. Trudy Larson, director of community health 
sciences at the University of Nevada, Reno, says, “There 
are plenty of students who apply to medical school, but 
we need to diversify the physician workforce. We need 
to provide an outreach for people who are interested 
in health care [so they can] know the pathway.”

LABOR SUPPLY AND DEMAND AT THE MARKET LEVEL 
229
The labor demand curve may shift if there is a change in the demand for the good or 
service that it is used to produce, if technological developments alter the production process, 
if the number of employers changes, or if the price or availability of other inputs changes. 
For example, when an organization experiences a fall in demand for its products, its labor 
demand curve will shift back as well.
2.3 MARKET ADJUSTMENT
Still using the same simplifying assumptions as in Chapter 4 about how markets work, 
we can examine how market forces might inﬂuence wage rates and the quantity of labor 
employed.
For example, let Figure 10.4 depict a stylized market for e-commerce Web site designers. 
In the late 1990s, e-commerce was booming, and demand for the services of such designers 
was high, as depicted by demand curve D1. The short-run supply curve was fairly inelastic, 
because the job required a certain amount of specialized education and talent. Stories in the 
newspapers at the time touted the fat salaries being offered to talented, self-taught computer 
experts just out of high school and told of people being aggressively recruited by businesses, 
with large signing bonuses.
In 2000, however, many investors decided that e-commerce was not going to be the money 
maker that they had expected, and investment funds for e-commerce dried up considerably. 
Many ﬁrms went out of business, and others laid off many of their employees. The market 
for Web site designers went from boom to bust. We can think of this as the demand curve 
shifting to D2.
Comparing equilibrium E1 to equilibrium E2, we can see that the model predicts that the 
number of Web site designers will fall and that the wage will fall as well. In fact, many Web 
site designers became unemployed and had to search for other types of jobs, while signing 
bonuses and premium wage offers became a thing of the past. Students who had been training 
to enter the ﬁeld found that they had to make other plans.
Labor market adjustment takes time—the movement from E1 to E2 is not instantaneous. 
It takes time for workers to change their career plans and for employers to adjust wages and 
salaries, which may be set by labor contracts. Given that labor market conditions are constantly 
changing, it may be unclear whether a particular labor market is in equilibrium. Much of the 
recent labor economics research has focused on the persistence of “friction” in labor markets, 
which slows the transition of workers from one job to another. In particular, unemployed workers 
may spend considerable time searching for a job that meets their speciﬁc requirements.

230 
CHAPTER 10 — MARKETS FOR LABOR
The existence of labor market friction means that a signiﬁcant number of jobs are commonly 
available, even when unemployment is high. For example, in June 2013 unemployment was 7.6 
percent, and 11.8 million people were unemployed, but there were also 3.9 million job openings. 
Discussion of labor conditions at a national level is an important topic in macroeconomics.
Discussion Questions
1. Suppose that your college or university substantially raises the wages that it offers to pay 
students who tend computer laboratories, monitoring the equipment and answering ques-
tions. What do you think would happen to the quantity of labor supplied? Why? Where 
would the extra labor hours come from? Do you think the supply of this kind of labor is 
elastic or inelastic? Why?
2. Opticians ﬁt people who have poor eyesight with glasses or contact lenses, prescribed by 
an optometrist. Beginning in the 1990s, technological developments in laser eye surgery 
made surgery an increasingly popular way of correcting bad eyesight. What effect do you 
think this development had on the market for opticians? Draw a graph, carefully showing 
whether the shift is in demand or supply and showing the resulting predicted changes in 
the quantity of labor demanded and in the wage.
3. CHANGES IN JOBS AND IN THE LABOR FORCE
For the remainder of this chapter, we move away from the idealized world of perfect com-
petition and equilibrium markets, to paint a more realistic portrait of paid work in the United 
States. We start with a reminder that what we see today is not exactly the way that things 
were in the past—and is not necessarily the way that things will be in the future, either. In 
1933, when unemployment was widespread because of the Great Depression, the U.S. Senate 
voted overwhelmingly to establish a 30-hour workweek. The House of Representatives voted 
down this measure, but in 1938 the Fair Labor Standards Act became law, establishing the 
40-hour workweek as the legal norm. By the 1960s U.S. workers were regarded with envy 
in much of the rest of the world, as having legal protection for relatively less time spent in 
paid work. This is no longer the case. What happened?
3.1 EMPLOYMENT FLEXIBILITY
For most of the twentieth century, Americans generally thought of “a job” (or at least a good 
job) as something that you typically did Monday through Friday, 40 hours a week, for a wage 
or salary and beneﬁts (such as health insurance and pension plans). People often expected to 
stay in the same job for years or even decades. In recent years, however, it has become popular 
to talk about how employment is becoming more “ﬂexible.” But the term “ﬂexibility” has 
two very different meanings, depending on whether it is considered from the point of view 
of the worker or the employer.
One meaning of “ﬂexible” work is that it is more suited to workers’ varying needs. Some 
workers—especially professional and managerial workers—now enjoy “ﬂextime” or the 
ability to set their daily starting and ending times. Job sharing and part-time work allow 
employment to be more easily combined with family care, studying, or leisure pursuits. 
However, many jobs remain inﬂexible and are not “family friendly.” The United States is 
practically alone among industrialized countries in lacking a federal law that mandates paid 
parental leave for new parents. According to a 2013 book that studied nearly 200 countries, 
180 of those mandated paid leave to new mothers, and 81 require paid leave to fathers.2 In the 
United States, a two-parent family is entitled to 24 weeks of parental leave but without pay. 
In most other industrialized countries, families receive 52 or more weeks of parental leave 
(as much as 318 weeks in France!), with 22 weeks of that with full-time pay.3 The effects of 
insufﬁcient parental leave fall disproportionately on women:

 
CHANGES IN JOBS AND IN THE LABOR FORCE 
231
In the absence of paid parental leave policies, traditional gender roles that involve 
women as “caregivers” and men as “providers,” and the typically lower earnings of 
mothers (relative to fathers) in the labor market, create strong incentives for women 
to reduce their employment and take on a large majority of child care responsibilities. 
The most obvious problems associated with such outcomes are that women bear a 
disproportionate burden of child care responsibilities and pay both a short- and a long-
term penalty in the labor market.4
“Flexibility” can refer to people’s ability to change jobs when they want to or retrain for 
new careers. However, the term “ﬂexibility” has also been used to refer to policies that make 
things easier for employers—and often make life more difﬁcult from a worker’s perspective. 
Many employers would like to have complete discretion over setting their workers’ hours and 
pay, to offer few or no beneﬁts, and to be able to terminate employees quickly and without 
fuss. Increasingly, some ﬁrms have hired “independent contractors,” “consultants,” or part-
time workers to avoid having to extend the beneﬁts that they provide to their regular full-time 
employees. More people now work nonstandard workweeks, regardless of whether they want 
to, in an economy that is increasingly “24/7.”
To some extent, “ﬂexibility” from the employee’s perspective is also in the interest of employers. 
Workers who are better rested and less stressed about their families, thanks to accommodating 
schedules and expectations, can be more productive. And to some extent, “ﬂexibility” from the 
employer’s perspective is also in the workers’ interest. An overly rigid labor market, in which 
workers are too expensive and difﬁcult to ﬁre, could cause employers to try to minimize the number 
of workers that they hire, thus reducing the number of jobs. From a well-being perspective, the 
question is how to achieve a good balance in this aspect of work organization.
3.2 WORK HOURS
Another important labor issue is weekly work hours and the availability of paid time off for 
vacations and illness. Although some workers may wish to work long hours for ﬁnancial or 
personal reasons, recent surveys suggest that one-third to half of American workers would 
prefer to work shorter hours with an equivalent reduction in pay.5
The average number of hours worked each week by employed Americans has stayed 
relatively constant since the mid-1970s, at around 39 hours. The percentage of workers 
working long hours (49 or more hours) generally increased from the 1970s to the 1990s, but 
has generally declined since then (to about 16 percent of workers in 2010).
International comparisons generally look at average annual work hours, instead of weekly 
work hours, to account for differences in vacation time. Average annual work hours among 
employed Americans have stayed relatively constant since the 1980s at around 1,800 hours.6 
This differs from the situation in most other industrialized countries, where average work 
hours have declined in recent decades. For example, over the period 1980 to 2006 average 
annual work hours declined by 18 percent in Germany, 15 percent in France, and 7 percent 
in the United Kingdom.
Figure 10.5 shows the average annual work hours in several OECD countries in 2012. 
The average work year in the United States was 1,790 hours, compared to 1,728 in Australia, 
1,654 in the United Kingdom, and 1,479 in France. We used to think of hard-working Asian 
populations as suffering much longer work hours than Americans, and, of course, this is still 
true for the poorer countries in Asia. However as of 2000 Japan, a former leader in long hours, 
had reduced its annual work hours to below the U.S. level. The difference of 400 hours per 
year between American and German workers is the equivalent of having American workers 
put in an additional 10 full-time weeks per year!
Movements in Europe toward shorter standard working hours have often been motivated 
by stronger labor unions and by macroeconomic considerations, with the goal of reducing 

232 
CHAPTER 10 — MARKETS FOR LABOR
unemployment. Other goals are to encourage strong families and to reduce consumption 
for ecological reasons. Most European countries have legal limits on the number of hours 
per week an employee is allowed to work, and paid vacation time of at least one month 
per year is standard—even for workers who are just starting. European employers are also 
normally required to provide several holidays, with pay. The United States is the only 
industrialized country that does not require employers to provide any paid vacation days 
or holidays.7
3.3 IMMIGRATION AND LABOR MARKETS
One of the most controversial topics in discussions of labor markets and wages is the impact 
of immigration, particularly the immigration of workers seeking low-wage jobs. According 
to the traditional neoclassical labor model, an inﬂux of unskilled workers willing to work for 
relatively low wages will clearly drive down equilibrium wages in markets for unskilled labor 
and displace some domestic workers. But as in any economic analysis, we must consider all 
the costs and beneﬁts of immigration to determine its overall impact on society.
Economists generally agree that immigration, both legal and illegal, does decrease the 
wages of unskilled workers, mainly those without a high school diploma. But they disagree 
on the magnitude of this impact. According to one study, between 1980 and 2000 immigration 
to the United States reduced the wages of men without a high school diploma by 7 percent. 
However, another study found that the wage reduction was only about 1 percent, and decreased 
over time as education levels increased.8
Other research has estimated the impact of immigration to the United States differently, 
depending on whether workers were born in the United States.9 The results indicate that due 
to immigration from 1994 to 2007 wages fell for foreign-born workers in the United States by 
about 5 percent but slightly increased for U.S.-born workers, by 0.4 percent. These ﬁndings 
suggest that new immigrants compete for jobs mostly with previous immigrants, rather than 
taking jobs away from U.S.-born workers. Meanwhile, U.S.-born workers may beneﬁt as 
new immigrants increase the demand for goods and services.
Despite common media representations to the contrary, a National Research Council 
study found that U.S. immigrants collectively pay more in taxes than they consume in public 
services and beneﬁts. According to economist Michael Clemens, the net effect on American 
society of immigration is “deﬁnitely positive.” He notes that immigration

led to a massively more prosperous economy. Everyone across the board is way, way 
better off now. The whole economy is the richest and most powerful in the world, 
and of all time, and that’s the effect that quadrupling our population, largely through 
immigration, had.10
Discussion Questions
1. What evidence have you seen—in your own family, or through the media—of increas-
ing “ﬂexibility” in labor markets? Do you think that these changes have been beneﬁcial, 
harmful, or both?
2. Do you think that all employees should receive paid vacation? What are the advantages 
and disadvantages of mandated vacation time?
4. ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS FOR VARIATIONS IN WAGES
The standard model of labor markets assumes that they operate in such a way that everyone 
is paid exactly the amount of his or her contribution to revenues. We saw that discussions 
of wages in this model focus on human capital, but with some allowance for the idea (em-
phasized especially in business schools) that the employer also has some responsibility for 
getting the best out of the workers. They may do so by providing appropriate management, 
a motivating and efﬁcient work environment, and complementary factors of production that 
will maximize the workers’ productivity.
The idea of the employer’s responsibility complicates the simple story because it blurs the 
question of which factors should receive which part of the compensation. If a new manager 
can get increased productivity out of the same group of workers, should the increased revenue 
that results all be assigned to the manager? Should it be shared with the workers?
Consider another scenario, in which one group of workers is provided with new equipment 
that makes them more productive, while another group stays at a lower level of productivity, 
using the older equipment. What should be done with the increased revenue resulting from 
the more productive work group? Some of it, clearly, can be used to pay for the equipment 
(maybe repaying a loan that was taken out to purchase it), but after that cost has been covered, 
then should it go to the workers in that group? Or should it be shared among both groups, on 
the grounds that they are all putting in the same amount of time and effort? Or should it go 
to the manager who had the idea to introduce the new equipment? As we continue to look at 
variations in wages, we see that issues of fairness and justice frequently combine with the 
economic issues.
4.1 COMPENSATING WAGE DIFFERENTIALS
Early economic thinkers put forth the idea that extra pay is required to attract workers to take 
jobs that are especially unappealing, compared to other work that is available for people at 
the same skill level. Apart from the wage, what would make one job either less or more ap-
pealing than another? A short list would probably include:
s  Working conditions. These include physical discomfort or danger, stress, whether the job 
is interesting, how the worker is treated, degree of autonomy, ﬂexibility of hours.
s  Nonwage beneﬁts. Some ﬁrms provide nonwage beneﬁts such as more vacation time, educational 
beneﬁts for the worker’s children, meals at company cafeterias, and subsidized housing.
s  Opportunities for advancement either within the ﬁrm or by moving to a new ﬁrm.
s  Social contribution. Many workers will ask not only whether the job is good for themselves 
but also whether it contributes to society and is consistent with their beliefs.
s  Job security. Because there are costs to being unemployed or searching for work, the likeli-
hood that a job will continue is an important characteristic.

234 
CHAPTER 10 — MARKETS FOR LABOR
It is possible to ﬁnd some real-world examples in which people demand, and get, a higher 
wage to take on jobs with less appealing characteristics. For example, because most people 
prefer to work days, night-shift work generally pays slightly more than day-shift work, even 
though the skills needed and the tasks accomplished are identical. In some cases, people 
accept a lower-than-necessary wage to perform an especially appealing job. The example that 
professors usually give is the job of being a professor: For those who like the intellectual life, 
it may be a very rewarding job, even though the pay is often below what professors believe 
that they could earn elsewhere. The idea that workers will demand higher wages for jobs 
with unappealing characteristics, and be willing to accept lower wages for jobs with better 
characteristics, is known as the theory of compensating wage differentials.
At the same time, you have probably noticed that many of the least attractive jobs in a 
society—such as garbage collection, agricultural work, and boring and repetitive work in clothing 
manufacture or meat processing—are found at the lowest end of the pay scale. This is partly 
because they require relatively little in the way of formal qualiﬁcations. To the extent that this 
is true, the low wages do not violate the theory of compensating wage differentials; this theory 
compares only jobs of equal skill. But even within the class of jobs that require few qualiﬁcations, 
some unpleasant jobs pay particularly badly, and one tends to ﬁnd that the workers here belong to 
particular groups—usually minority or female, nonunionized, and often immigrants.
For the theory of compensating differentials to operate in reality, it is necessary for workers 
to have good information about job conditions and risks and to be able to move freely to 
alternative jobs for which they are qualiﬁed. It turns out that, especially when unemployment 
is high, the effect of compensating differentials within jobs in the same skill class can be 
swamped by other factors, such as bargaining power or discrimination.
4.2 SOCIAL NORMS, BARGAINING POWER, AND LABOR UNIONS
In any society it is usually possible to ﬁnd a set of norms about how much most types of jobs 
should be paid. A norm is an expectation, usually based to some degree on experience, but 
sometimes lagging, as when, for example, employers ﬁnd that they can get a certain type of 
work done more cheaply by machines than by people. According to the standard labor model, 
we would expect that the wage rate would fall to a level that allows people to be competitive 
with cheaper machines. In fact, employers are usually slow to offer lower wages, and people 
will resist taking the offers if made, because each side is aware that this would be contrary 
to existing norms.
In addition to norms, an essential aspect of any labor market is the bargaining power on 
each side. One obvious situation that allows a ﬁrm to bargain down wages, below what is 
the norm in other places, is if it is the only employer to whom a certain group of workers 
can look for work. This is called a condition of monopsony—with only one buyer but many 
sellers. In the 1900s, for example, some manufacturing companies (including Hershey’s for 
chocolate and Pullman for railway cars) set up “company towns” in which they were the 
sole major employer. Remote mining towns and logging camps are other examples. In such 
cases, employers have more discretion in setting wages than if workers could easily choose 
between working for them and working for other employers. The workers may have to accept 
the company’s demands as the price of keeping their jobs—unless they have the ability and 
the determination to leave the area.
In other situations, workers have market power in the sale of their services. This can happen 
if they have unique talents. It can also happen if a strong union represents all the workers 
in a particular occupation or region, so employers have to bargain with one organization 
representing a number of sellers. Then employers may have to accept union demands as 
the price of remaining in business; the only limit is that if wages exceed a certain level, an 
employer may ﬁnd it more proﬁtable to close its local operation and reopen in a region where 
labor is cheaper.

ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS FOR VARIATIONS IN WAGES 
235
These examples—a single employer, on the one hand, and a single “star” or union 
federation, on the other—represent the extremes of concentration of power in the labor 
market. If a single employer (buyer) faces a single seller, the case can be described as a 
bilateral monopoly. In this case, results will be determined by bargaining, rather than 
by any kind of auction procedure. The outcome depends on the strength, cleverness, 
and perhaps political power of the parties and on the skills of professional mediators 
and litigators.
More common in labor markets are cases of oligopsony, in which there are a relatively 
small number of buyers. For example, in the U.S. music-recording industry, oligopsonistic 
record label buyers of music face uniquely talented but as yet unorganized sellers of musical 
work.
Labor unions are legally recognized organizations that collectively bargain for their 
members regarding wages, beneﬁts, and working conditions. Unions ﬁrst appeared in the 
mid-nineteenth century, but they were not legally recognized in the United States until 1935. 
As seen in Figure 10.6, membership in labor unions in the United States increased until the 
mid-1950s, when about one-quarter of the labor force was unionized. Since then, membership 
in unions has gradually but steadily declined. In 2012, only about 11 percent of workers in 
the United States belonged to a union. Labor union membership is much higher in the public 
sector than the private sector. About 36 percent of public sector employees belong to a union, 
but only 7 percent of private sector workers.
One of the reasons for the decline in union membership in recent decades has been an 
anti-union regulatory environment. Perhaps most famously, in 1981 President Ronald Reagan 
responded to an illegal strike by air trafﬁc controllers, who were federal employees, by giving 
them 48 hours to return to work or face termination. More recently, since 2011 states such 
as Wisconsin and Indiana have passed new laws limiting the power of labor unions. Another 
reason for the decline of labor unions has been a shift in employment from traditional unionized 
occupations such as manufacturing to service occupations in which it is more difﬁcult to 
unionize, such as retail and restaurant workers.
Union membership rates are higher in most other industrialized countries. For example, 
union membership is 18 percent in Australia, 26 percent in the United Kingdom, 29 percent

Union membership reached a peak of 
around 25 percent of the labor force 
in the 1950s, but has declined since 
then to only 11 percent in 2012.

CHAPTER 10 — MARKETS FOR LABOR
in Canada, 55 percent in Norway, and 70 percent in Finland.11 However, in most countries 
union membership rates have been declining in recent years.
Labor unions have generally been effective at providing good-paying jobs for their 
members. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average weekly earnings of 
unionized workers in 2012 were $943 per week, compared to average earnings of $742 for 
non-union workers. Union workers are also more likely to have employer-provided beneﬁts 
such as health insurance and paid vacations.
Some economists see the decline in labor union membership as a positive development, 
arguing that unions had pushed wages to above-market levels.12 This argument concludes 
that while unions were probably necessary to counter the excessive power of corporations 
in the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, they had become a source of market inefﬁciency by 
the end of the century.
Other economists see labor unions as a necessary way for workers to bargain on an equal 
footing with management. The decline of unions is widely considered to be a contributing 
factor in the rise of economic inequality in the United States, which we discuss in more detail 
in Chapter 11. Also, the beneﬁts of unions may extend beyond those who actually belong 
to them.
[Unions] affect nonunion pay and practices [by instituting] norms and practices that have 
become more widespread throughout the economy, thereby improving pay and working 
conditions for the entire workforce. . . . Many fringe beneﬁts, such as pensions and health 
insurance, were ﬁrst provided in the union sector and then became more commonplace. 
Union grievance procedures, which provide due process in the workplace, have been 
adapted to many nonunion workplaces. . . . [Unions] remain a source of innovation in 
work practices (e.g., training and worker participation) and in beneﬁts (e.g., child care, 
work-time ﬂexibility, and sick leave).13
4.3 EFFICIENCY WAGES AND EMPLOYEE MORALE
Economists have theorized that employers may sometimes pay wages somewhat above the 
market-determined level as a way of motivating and retaining workers. Efﬁciency wage 
theory proposes that workers will work harder and “smarter” when they know that their pres-
ent employer is paying them more than they could receive elsewhere. Because these wages 
are above the market-clearing level, there is likely to be a queue of potential workers who 
would like to get the relatively high wages. This fact adds to employee motivation, because 
they understand that if they were to shirk and be ﬁred there would be plenty of applicants 
for their position.
In a perfectly competitive labor market, the workers, knowing they could get a job elsewhere 
at the same wage, would be fairly indifferent about whether their current employer wants 
to keep them on. If an employer pays more than the going wage, however, the employee 
has an incentive to try to hold on to their particular job. He or she may be motivated by the 
fear of losing the current “good” job and having to take one that pays less. The extra effort 
may also be motivated by a sense of gratitude, or identiﬁcation with the ﬁrm, because we 
tend to like people who treat us well. Thus it is theorized that efﬁciency wages can be proﬁt 
maximizing: The cost to the ﬁrm of the extra wages may be more than made up for by the 
superior work effort and loyalty that they elicit. (See Box 10.2 for more on the potential 
beneﬁts of efﬁciency wages.)
Researchers have found that employee morale—the attitude of workers toward their work 
(and toward their employer)—can be very important in explaining productivity variations 
among workers who have the same skills and are using identical equipment. Morale is a 
subtle thing that can be analyzed in relation to many factors, including particular personalities, 
work organization and management, traditions within a ﬁrm or a culture, and relative pay.

ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS FOR VARIATIONS IN WAGES 
237
In some cases, employers try to increase good feelings through direct means, such as by 
hosting parties, giving nonmonetary honors to let employees know that they are appreciated, 
or having “team-building” activities designed to increase cooperation among coworkers and 
identiﬁcation with the organization.
A key factor in morale is perceived equity: whether the workers feel that they are being 
treated fairly by management, especially compared to expectations raised by history and by 
the wider culture. For example, people have expectations about the relative wages of different 
jobs. If the wage for one job goes up, there is strong psychological pressure for the wages of 
what are seen as related jobs (whether they are paid more, less, or the same) to rise enough 
to keep the wages in about the same relation.
4.4 DUAL LABOR MARKETS
The theory of dual labor markets also presents a different picture from the standard labor model, 
based on the idea that there can be different segments within a labor market. Although not all 
economists agree with the theory, it is useful for explaining some real-world labor outcomes.
The theory describes labor markets in which the “primary” portion of a workforce is 
motivated by high wages, opportunities for advancement, job security, and perhaps other 
favorable working conditions. Employment in the “secondary” workforce, by contrast, is 
more closely driven by market conditions. These workers receive generally lower wages, 
have minimal opportunities for advancement (even if they increase their human capital), 
and have low job security. Obviously, many workers in the secondary sector would prefer 
to work in primary sector jobs. Secondary sector workers could be assumed to be willing to 
accept something less than the normal wages in primary sector jobs; yet those employers do 
not jump on the chance to lower their wage bill.
BOX 10.2 GOOD JOBS ARE GOOD FOR BUSINESS
According to research by Zeynep Ton at Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology (MIT), providing employees with 
“good” jobs and paying efﬁciency wages can frequently 
be good for business, too. She notes that this idea runs 
counter to prevailing notions of cost minimization.
The conventional wisdom is that many companies 
have no choice but to offer “bad” jobs—especially retail-
ers whose business models entail competition by offering 
low prices. If retailers invest more in employees, custom-
ers will have to pay more, so the assumption goes.
She studied several businesses that provide their 
employees with good jobs, including Trader Joe’s and 
Costco. Trader Joe’s starting salary of around $40,000 
per year is about twice what many of its competitors 
offer. Costco’s wages are about 40 percent higher 
than those of their main competitor, Walmart’s Sam’s 
Clubs. Both Trader Joe’s and Costco also offer good 
opportunities for advancement. Turnover at these 
companies is low, and employee morale is relatively 
high. They are both also known for high-quality cus-
tomer service.
Ton ﬁnds that, rather than hurting these ﬁrms’ prof-
its, they actually ﬁnancially outperform their competi-
tors. For example, annual revenues per square foot are 
$986 at Costco, but only $588 at Sam’s Club. Sales 
rates at Trader Joe’s are about three times that of a 
typical U.S. supermarket. She notes that companies 
offering well-paying jobs also institute policies that 
promote worker efﬁciency, including training workers 
for a variety of tasks and allowing them to make rela-
tively small decisions on their own. Ton concludes:
Today many retail managers believe that there is 
a tradeoff between investing in employees and 
offering the lowest prices. That is false. Retailers 
that persist in believing in it forgo the opportunity 
to improve their own performance and contribute 
the kind of jobs the U.S. economy urgently needs. 
When backed up with a speciﬁc set of operating 
practices, investing in employees can boost cus-
tomer experience and decrease costs. Companies 
can compete successfully on the basis of low prices 
and simultaneously keep their customers and 
employees happy.

Retailers,” Harvard Business Review (January–February 
2012): 124–131.

which primary work-
ers enjoy high wages,

hired with low wages, 
no opportunities for

job security

238 
CHAPTER 10 — MARKETS FOR LABOR
Such labor market segmentation may take place across ﬁrms. A primary sector of large, 
established ﬁrms (or entrenched government agencies), which use some of their surplus 
revenues to pay high wages, may exist side by side with a secondary sector of smaller 
organizations that are more subject to competitive pressures.
Dual labor markets may also exist within a single organization. For example, a ﬁrm 
may employ regular workers with health and retirement beneﬁts and, alongside them, hire 
temporary workers on short contracts with no beneﬁts. In many colleges and universities, 
tenured faculty constitute the “primary” workforce. Then lecturers, adjuncts, and research 
associates, who constitute a secondary workforce, are hired as the need arises—and let go 
when the need falls. Such a structure allows an employer to keep a loyal core of employees 
and to avoid making new long-term commitments in times of temporary high demand. But for 
an individual worker, moving from the secondary to the primary labor force may be difﬁcult 
indeed. Workers in the secondary sector have fewer opportunities to build up human capital 
and may quickly develop an “unstable”-looking work history.
An extreme type of dual labor market is what some economists call a “winner-take-all” 
market, such as the ones for star athletes, famous actors, and top managers. In such markets, 
the rewards for being in ﬁrst place are vastly greater than the rewards for being a step down, 
even if the actual difference in talents and skills between the top tier and the next is negligible. 
Welfare analysis applied to such markets would ﬁnd signiﬁcant inefﬁciency. Very few people 
can actually get into the top tier in, for example, Olympic sports or an acting career; yet the 
rewards for winning are so appealing that many individuals devote huge amounts of time and 
effort to trying to “reach for the gold.” Except in cases in which the effort to “be the best” is 
rewarding in itself, those who unsuccessfully devote their lives to the effort would probably 
have happier, more productive lives working toward different goals.
4.5 DISCRIMINATION
Not all social norms and customs that inﬂuence the labor market can be considered benign. 
Labor market discrimination exists when, among similarly qualiﬁed people, some are treated 
disadvantageously in employment on the basis of race, gender, age, sexual preference, physi-
cal appearance, or disability. Workers who belong to disfavored groups may be paid less for 
the same work, may be denied promotions, or may simply be excluded from higher-paying 
and higher-status occupations.
Historically, much labor market discrimination, particularly against African Americans 
and other minorities, was based on racist beliefs that certain groups were innately inferior. 
Some discrimination against women was similarly based on sexist notions of inferiority. 
However, sexual discrimination was also historically rooted in social norms that reserved 
better-paying jobs for men (who were assumed to be supporting families), while making 
women (who were assumed to have husbands to rely on) solely responsible for providing 
unpaid household labor and family care.
Discriminatory attitudes may be held by employers, who discriminate on the basis of their 
own biases, expectations, and beliefs. They may also be held by customers or coworkers. 
This case poses a dilemma for employers, even if they themselves are not prejudiced. For 
example, suppose that a law ﬁrm hires a skilled minority lawyer, but clients feel more conﬁdent 
being represented by European-American lawyers. The ﬁrm may ﬁnd that the new lawyer 
attracts little business to the ﬁrm. A construction ﬁrm that hires a female forklift driver or a 
preschool that hires a male teacher may ﬁnd that the morale of its other workers sinks, as the 
workers react badly to seeing someone of the “wrong” sex in “their” jobs. More insidiously, 
discriminatory attitudes can become self-fulﬁlling prophecies: Even though the minority 
lawyer, the female construction worker, and the male preschool teacher are all fully qualiﬁed 
in a technical sense, their contribution to the ﬁrm can be low, and perhaps even negative, if 
social norms create an environment in which their skills go unused or work group cooperation

is jeopardized. Employers concerned with immediate productivity may therefore fail to 
hire disfavored groups, even if they themselves do not harbor discriminatory beliefs about 
racial differences or gender roles. Such discrimination can be eliminated only by socially 
coordinated—and even courageous—action.
In Figure 10.7 we compare median weekly earnings in the United States of full-time, year-
round workers in various groups, using government data from 2013. Median earnings are at a 
level where half the people in the group make more and half less. We see that median earnings 
vary signiﬁcantly by both race and gender. The median earnings of black male workers were 
about 77 percent of the earnings of their white male counterparts, and the median earnings of 
Hispanic male workers were only 67 percent of white male earnings. Disparities among female 
workers of different races also exist, although the differences are somewhat less pronounced. 
White female workers only earn 82 percent of the earnings of their white male counterparts. 
Sexual disparities are also evident among male and female workers of other races.
We must realize that the data in Figure 10.7 are not necessarily evidence of wage 
discrimination. Some variations in wages may be due to other factors such as differences 
in experience, education, and occupational choice (although some of these differences 
may also be a result of discrimination). For example, we saw earlier in the chapter that 
educational attainment can have a signiﬁcant impact on earnings. Education levels vary by 
race. About 30 percent of white individuals have a bachelor’s degree or higher, but only 20 
percent of black and 14 percent of Hispanic individuals have at least a bachelor’s degree.14 
So differences in education levels may explain the variation in wages by race, rather than 
discrimination. But again, differences in educational attainment may be a result of past, and 
current, discrimination.
Educational attainment does not vary signiﬁcantly by gender in the United States. So the 
differences in earnings between male and female workers in Figure 10.7 cannot be attributed 
to differences in education. Part of the explanation for women’s lower earnings is that women 
have traditionally had less work experience than men, on average. Men as a group have tended 
to work more continuously at their jobs, whereas, given social norms and, sometimes, individual 
preferences or requirements concerning family responsibilities, many mothers participate in the 
labor market less than full time when their children are young. To the extent that time on the 
job can contribute to productivity, this could explain some of the difference.
Another important factor in explaining earnings differences by gender is occupational 
segregation—the tendency of men and women to be found in different kinds of jobs. For 
example, in the United States, jobs like bookkeeper, dental hygienist, child-care worker,

registered nurse, and teacher of young children are held overwhelmingly by women. 
Meanwhile, men notably dominate in occupations such as construction, metal working, 
truck driving, and engineering. Occupational segregation could be a result of differences in 
preferences, or it could also reﬂect discrimination. For example, existing stereotypes may 
lead more women to become nurses while doctors are more likely to be men.
Statistical studies suggest that about a third of the differences between men’s and women’s 
pay in the United States can be associated with differences in occupational choice. Various 
reasons have been offered to explain why the sorts of jobs women tend to work at pay less 
on average. One explanation is that, because women were historically “crowded” into a 
narrow range of occupations, the supply curve in these job markets was artiﬁcially shifted 
outward, thus lowering the wage. Some have suggested that the average difﬁculty level of 
the job or the skill required might be less for “female” jobs. Others argue that differences 
in preferences between male and female workers could lead women to trade high wages for 
other beneﬁcial job characteristics (such as ﬂexibility in working hours). And still others 
argue that entrenched wage norms systematically devalue certain kinds of work (e.g., work 
involving emotional empathy or work with children).
Even after accounting for differences in education, experience, and type of job, however, 
over a third of the difference between men’s and women’s earnings in the United States remains 
unexplained. That is, even comparing men and women with equal qualiﬁcations who hold the 
same jobs, differences in pay remain. In the United States, discrimination by sex and race in 
hiring and wages was made illegal by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. (This act also 
covered discrimination by “color,” religion, and national origin. Later acts have addressed 
discrimination according to age and disability, and various states and localities have passed 
laws concerning employment treatment on the basis of sexual preference.) Enforcement, 
however, has proved difﬁcult. Evidence suggests that bias, both blatant and subtle, still plays 
a signiﬁcant role. (See Box 10.3 for more on labor discrimination.)
BOX 10.3 LABOR DISCRIMINATION BY FEDEX
In March 2012 the delivery company FedEx reached 
a settlement with the U.S. Department of Labor over 
allegations that the company discriminated against 
more than 20,000 job seekers. As part of the settle-
ment, FedEx agreed to pay $3 million in back wages 
and offer jobs to about 2,000 rejected applicants as 
new openings become available. The company also 
agreed to revise its hiring practices to avoid future 
discrimination.
The allegations were brought against FedEx by 
the Labor Department’s Ofﬁce of Federal Contract 
Compliance Programs. The ofﬁce said it found evi-
dence of discrimination in hiring on the basis of sex, 
race, and national origin based on a regular audit 
of hiring practices. Such audits are conducted for all 
companies that contract with the federal government 
for services and goods.
Of the rejected applicants, 61 percent were female 
and 52 percent African American—percentages that 
were disproportionate to the number of applicants. 
As one example of discrimination, it was found that 
women were automatically excluded from certain posi-
tions that required the lifting of heavy objects. Hiring 
rates for Hispanics and Native Americans were also 
signiﬁcantly lower than hiring rates for whites.
Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis commented on the 
settlement: “When you do business with the govern-
ment, we expect you to do the right thing. That includes 
giving all Americans an equal shot at a good job. It’s 
about more than just the law—diversity is smart for 
business.”

Discussion Questions

statement correct or incorrect? Of the nonwage working conditions listed in the text, which 
ones are most important to you as you think about your future career?

2. Think about your current job or the last job that you held. Would you say that it is in 
a “primary” or “secondary” labor market? To what extent do you think that the factors 
discussed above—human capital, market power, compensating wage differentials, or 
discrimination—explain the wage and working conditions you experience(d)?
5. WAGES AND ECONOMIC POWER
In Section 4, we considered various explanations for why wages vary among different groups 
of employees. In this ﬁnal section, we look at changes in overall wages over time, based on 
data for the United States. In order to understand how wages have changed over time, it is 
necessary to address the topic of economic power. In particular, how much of total revenues 
must ﬁrms pay their workers versus how much do they allocate in other ways, including to 
proﬁts and taxes?
5.1 WAGE TRENDS
Figure 10.8 repeats a graph that we presented in Chapter 0, showing the time trend for real 
(inﬂation-adjusted) median weekly wages and corporate proﬁts in the United States from 
1980 to 2012. After adjusting for inﬂation, median weekly wages in 2012 were nearly the 
same level they were in 1980. Meanwhile, corporate proﬁts, also adjusted for inﬂation, 
nearly tripled.
Historical data indicate that American workers fared much better earlier in the twentieth 
century. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, real average annual earnings increased by 
a factor of about four between 1900 and 1970.15 During the 1970s real earnings essentially 
stopped increasing. Household income continued to increase slightly beyond the 1970s, only 
because more people per household entered the labor force.
Figure 10.8 suggests that corporations have effectively been able to dramatically increase 
their proﬁts in the past few decades without having to pay their workers higher wages and 
salaries. Meanwhile, the incomes of management executives, particularly those at the very 
top, have soared. As we also discuss in Chapter 11, the pay of chief executive ofﬁcers (CEOs) 
of large U.S. corporations in 1965 was 20 times the pay of an average worker. But in 2012, 
CEO pay stood at 273 times the pay of an average worker!
Are CEOs really worth so much more today than they were 50 years ago? It would require the 
use of very questionable assumptions to make the case that either the supply of CEOs has greatly 
diminished or the demand for them has greatly increased, relative to the supply and demand for

workers. However, American culture has evolved along with the rise in executive pay so that the 
lack of protest has suggested that people accepted these relative valuations for different kinds of 
work, at least until the emergence of the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011.
These trends indicate a shift in economic power, away from workers and toward corporate 
proﬁts and executive compensation. American workers have lost economic power as a result 
of various factors, including globalization, technological change, and the decline of labor 
unions (which we also discuss further in Chapter 11). (For a real-world illustration of the 
relative fortunes of workers, CEOs, and corporations, see Box 10.4.)
BOX 10.4 WAGE CUTS AND RECORD PROFITS
Caterpillar, maker of bulldozers, backhoes, and other 
construction machinery, is widely seen as one of the most 
aggressive companies in seeking steep concessions from 
employees during labor negotiations. In 2012 the com-
pany pressed its long-term workers to accept a six-year 
wage freeze, while also instituting a two-tier wage system, 
so that new hires are put on a signiﬁcantly lower wage 
scale than those who had been there longer. Wages for 
those employed at Caterpillar for at least seven years 
average $26 per hour. However, new employees are 
typically given an initial wage of only $13 per hour.
The company has stated that such concessions 
are necessary so that they can remain competitive. 
Rusty L. Dunn, a Caterpillar spokesman, said the 
company’s stance is that wages should reﬂect market 
conditions, and that such adjustments would help 
Caterpillar “keep competitive when times are bad.” 
But Caterpillar reported proﬁts in 2012 of $5.7 billion. 
If Caterpillar’s 2012 proﬁts had been divided among 
all employee salaries, each worker would have earned 
an additional $45,000. If even a third of the proﬁt had 
gone to additional employee salaries, they could each 
have received an additional $15,000 that year.
Meanwhile the compensation of Caterpillar’s CEO, 
Douglas Oberhelman, increased by 113 percent be-
tween 2010 and 2012; his total compensation in 2012 
was $22.4 million. Only $6 million of this was in direct 
salary, with the rest in stock options and other incentives. 
(A large part of the compensation of top management 
in large modern corporations comes in the form of gifts 
of stock and/or stock options. The latter are often, in 
effect, permissions to buy the company’s stock at a 
relatively low price, and sell it at a higher price.)
Timothy O’Brien, president of an Illinois union that 
represents Caterpillar workers, notes, “A company that 
earned [record proﬁts in 2011 and 2012] should be 
willing to help the workers who made those proﬁts 
for them. Caterpillar believes in helping the very 
rich, but what they’re doing would help eliminate the 
middle class.”

5.2 AN ALTERNATIVE FRAMEWORK: WORKER COOPERATIVES
Much of the discussion in this chapter has assumed a working arrangement in which the 
goals of the “employee” do not necessarily align with those of the “employer.” For example, 
we discussed how the relative bargaining power of employees and employers can inﬂuence 
wages and how “ﬂexibility” can mean very different things to employees and employers. A 
typical for-proﬁt corporation is owned by those who hold shares of the company’s stock, in 
proportion to the amount of stock that they own. Top executives answer directly to shareholders 
and manage subordinate workers with the goal of maximizing proﬁts. From the perspective 
of shareholders and top executives, maintaining (or increasing) worker productivity while 
lowering wage costs is desirable, as it leads to higher proﬁts. From the perspective of work-
ers, however, increases in wages are seen as desirable, and workers may have little concern 
for the proﬁtability of the company.
Worker cooperatives, an alternative labor framework, seek to reduce or eliminate 
the potential for labor conﬂicts by specifying that the owners of the enterprise are the 
workers themselves. Worker cooperatives are sometimes viewed as a “third way” of labor 
organization, in contrast to standard for-proﬁt companies and government-run enterprises. 
The organizational structure of worker cooperatives can vary, but in a typical cooperative 
worker coopera-
tives: a labor arrange-
ment in which the 
owners of an enter-
prise are the workers 
themselves

 
WAGES AND ECONOMIC POWER

every worker is also an owner. Worker cooperatives normally do seek to make a proﬁt, and 
any proﬁts are distributed among the worker-owners (in addition to receiving wages or a 
salary). Some workers may hold more ownership shares than others and thus receive a greater 
share of proﬁts, say perhaps because of seniority, but in many cooperatives all workers have 
equal ownership shares. Important decisions are generally voted upon by all worker-owners, 
including decisions about wages, working hours, and beneﬁts. Despite any differences in 
ownership shares, decisions are typically made on a “one person, one vote” basis.
Worker cooperatives arose as an alternative labor framework during the Industrial 
Revolution. Cooperatives are found throughout the world, the most famous being the 
Mondragón Cooperative Corporation in the Basque region of Spain, founded in 1956. 
Mondragón, which consists of more than 250 separate cooperatives with a total of about 
85,000 worker-owners, is the seventh-largest company in Spain. Some of the differences 
between Mondragón and a typical capitalist company were described as follows:
One of the co-operatively and democratically adopted rules governing [Mondragón] 
limits top-paid worker-members to earning 6.5 times the lowest-paid workers. Nothing 
more dramatically demonstrates the differences distinguishing this from the capitalist 
alternative organization of enterprises. . . . [I]ts pay equity rules can and do contribute 
to a larger society with far greater income and wealth equality than is typical in societies 
that have chosen capitalist organizations of enterprises. Over 43 percent of members are 
women, whose equal powers with male members likewise inﬂuence gender relations 
in society different from capitalist enterprises.16
Italy has about 8,000 worker cooperatives, and France has nearly 2,000. In India, the India Coffee 
House is a cooperative restaurant chain with nearly 400 locations. In the United States, the U.S. 
Federation of Worker Cooperatives, whose membership comprises more than 100 cooperatives, 
works to promote cooperative formation, advocacy, and development. One example of a successful 
worker cooperative in the United States is Evergreen Cooperatives in Cleveland, OH, based in a 
low-income neighborhood and providing living wage jobs. The cooperative’s main business is an 
environmentally conscious laundry facility that provides service to local hospitals.
Based solely on economic performance, such as worker productivity, the scientiﬁc 
evidence suggests that worker cooperatives can perform at least as well as traditional 
capitalist companies.17 According to a 2011 paper that studied Mondragón, cooperative 
member-owners tend to be better paid than their peers in comparable ﬁrms, with greater 
opportunities for involvement and training. Although the cooperative labor framework is a 
“viable and possibly even superior alternative” to the traditional capitalist ﬁrm, it is not a 
“universal panacea” either. For example, job satisfaction was lower in cooperatives than in 
traditional ﬁrms, perhaps a reﬂection of higher worker expectations. Obviously, estimating 
the overall impact of worker cooperatives on well-being requires a multifaceted analysis in 
which all factors cannot be easily quantiﬁed.
5.3 HOW ARE REVENUES ALLOCATED?
Workers are one group that lays a claim on the revenues of ﬁrms, while their executives are 
another claimant. We now brieﬂy consider other groups that also expect to share in the rev-
enues of corporations and how allocations among these groups affect wages.
Government
The claims that governments make on businesses most often come in the form of taxes, though 
they may also at times levy ﬁnes on ﬁrms that are found to be disobeying a law. This money allows 
governments to supply much of the institutional and physical infrastructure necessary to operate 
businesses and to try to keep their activities somewhat in line with the social good. Businesses 

244 
CHAPTER 10 — MARKETS FOR LABOR
generally dislike paying taxes and complying with regulations and reporting requirements. How-
ever, without tax revenue governments cannot maintain services on which businesses depend, such 
as emergency call centers, ﬁreﬁghters, and police. Businesses as well as citizens depend on these 
services, as well as on roads, communications infrastructure, and the legal and other infrastructure 
that supports commerce. Moreover, all of society depends on government to monitor and regulate 
businesses to ensure safety in food, pharmaceuticals, and other products as well as a degree of 
honesty in claims made about the goods and services that they provide.
Suppliers of Physical Capital
Suppliers of physical capital include individuals or ﬁrms that supply both natural resources 
and manufactured capital. The price at which natural resources are sold depends to some ex-
tent on the cost of extraction, but also on economic power. For example, owners of oil wells 
have sometimes colluded to hold the selling price of this valuable commodity well above the 
cost of extraction and transportation. Owners of mines that produce gems or precious metals 
similarly have a long tradition of “ﬁxing” prices, in part by strictly controlling the amount 
that is produced in a given time frame.
In other cases, scarcity is a critical factor in the price of the resource, as may be seen in 
the case of renewable resources such as some wood species or nonrenewable ones such as 
bauxite, oil, or copper. Some analysts predict that increasing scarcity of certain important 
natural resources will drive up the cost of production of many goods. This prediction, if true, 
is especially important in relation to wages; the same wage will be able to purchase less of 
the products that have become more expensive. On the other hand, “technological optimists” 
predict that human ingenuity will stay ahead of this trend, so that the prices of most natural 
resources will not affect the relative prices of wages and goods.
Prices of manufactured capital are more likely to be set according to our familiar supply-
and-demand models. Their supply curve reﬂects the costs of producing the equipment 
(including what the producers had to pay for the natural resources used in their intermediate 
products). This interacts with the quantities demanded and the prices offered in the market.
Suppliers of Financial Capital
From the point of view of the ﬁrm, these can be divided into those whose claim can be considered 
part of “the necessary cost of doing business” and those that are the “residual claimants.” When a 
ﬁrm takes out a loan, the payments of interest and principal are considered part of the necessary 
cost of doing business. They are taken out of revenues, along with taxes and the cost of purchasing 
inputs (including labor services), before anything remains that can be called a proﬁt.
Investors, as distinct from lenders, are generally considered residual claimants; their 
return comes out of proﬁts—what is left over after the ﬁrm has covered all necessary costs 
to sustain its activity. There is no clear law that states who else is a residual claimant, but top 
management often receive part of the proﬁts, in one form or another.
A Useful Image
To summarize, the necessary costs of doing business include payments to factors of production 
(labor, ﬁnancial capital, and material inputs) as well as taxes. The commonest uses for corpo-
rate proﬁts include paying dividends to shareholders, investing in buildings and equipment, 
purchasing other companies, and buying stock shares from shareholders, to be held by the 
company. (The last of these actions increases the company’s power when it is confronted by 
proposals from outside shareholders, on subjects such as environmental protection, employee 
rights, or obligations of the board of directors.)
One image that you can take away from this discussion is of a very fancy kind of sprinkler hose, 
which is ﬁlled by the revenues generated by the sale of a ﬁrm’s products. As you look along the 

 
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
245
hose, you can see places where it sprinkles out appropriate payments for the necessary inputs to 
production—wages, salaries, payments for physical inputs, and taxes or fees. Finally, you come 
to the end of the hose; what is left—whether it be a trickle or a fountain—is considered proﬁt.
The salient word in the preceding paragraph is “appropriate”—what is the appropriate amount 
of revenue to allocate to each factor of production? The analysis in the ﬁrst half of this chapter 
gives us the simple, neoclassical answer: Every factor should be compensated according to its 
marginal revenue product—the amount contributed to the market value of the product by the 
last unit of that factor. And the assumption of perfect competition (which we discuss in more 
detail in Chapter 17) further insists that ﬁrms must set wages exactly equal to MRPL, just as the 
returns to capital must be set exactly equal to the marginal revenue product of capital.
Box 10.4 suggests that diverting all or part of the company’s proﬁts could have prevented 
the wage freeze at Caterpillar, or even signiﬁcantly increased worker compensation. Is this 
realistic? It is, in principle, possible. For comparison, consider for a moment another factor of 
production: raw materials. Supposing that the cost of some critical raw material were to rise, 
so that at least in the short run, before it could ﬁnd any alternative, Caterpillar would be forced 
to pay a great deal more for these materials. This would be expected to cut immediately into 
proﬁts. For a comparable thought-experiment, imagine that a very strong union is formed, 
and it is joined by all of the types of workers that Caterpillar requires. Imagine, additionally, 
that this union is able to make a credible threat of a strike, unless Caterpillar raises workers’ 
salaries by an amount that cuts its proﬁts by a third. Again, in the short run, the necessary cost 
of doing business would rise. Unless the ﬁrm decided to simply shut down, it would have a 
smaller proﬁt left over at the end of its metaphorical sprinkler hose.
The second of these imaginary scenarios is not about to happen for at least two reasons: 
Unions have greatly dwindled in the United States, to the point that it is hardly imaginable 
that they would have this kind of power; and globalization allows even a maker of heavy, 
expensive-to-transport machinery to threaten to move to another country where labor is 
cheaper. The world has shifted in such a way that it is hard for workers to make credible 
threats and relatively easy for employers to do so. The relative loss of worker power is one 
of the explanations for the growing inequality that we discuss in Chapter 11.

APPENDIX: A FORMAL MODEL OF A FIRM’S HIRING DECISION
Suppose that a ﬁrm produces disposable razors. Holding all other inputs ﬁxed, the relationship 
between the number of workers (the “quantity of labor”) hired and the number of razors that 
can be produced in a day is given in the ﬁrst two columns of the table on the following page. 
From these ﬁrst two columns, the marginal physical product of each additional worker (of 
labor) (MPPL) can be computed. For example, one worker can produce 5 razors, but adding 
an additional worker makes possible the production of 12 razors, so the marginal physical 
product of the second worker is 7 razors. Note that the marginal physical product of labor 
ﬁrst rises and then falls.
We further assume that the ﬁrm sells razors in a competitive market and that the price 
received per razor is constant at $3. Hence the marginal revenue product of labor (MRPL), the 
monetary value of the additional physical production, is always just $3 × MPPL. We assume 
that the ﬁrm buys labor in a perfectly competitive labor market, at a constant wage of $12. 
Hence the marginal factor cost of labor (MFCL) is constant at $12.
marginal physical 
product of labor 
(MPPL): the amount 
that a unit of addi-
tional labor contrib-
utes to the physical 
product of a ﬁrm

The MRPL and MFCL curves are graphed in Figure 10.9. The MRPL curve has an initial hump, 
because the MPPL initially increases and then declines. For all workers up to the ﬁfth worker, 
hiring the additional worker adds more to revenues than to costs. The proﬁt-maximizing ﬁrm 
should stop hiring workers when MRPL = MFCL, at an employment level of ﬁve workers.

11 Economic and Social Inequality
Which do you think is a more important dimension of human well-being: the quantity of 
goods and services that an economy produces or the ultimate distribution of those goods and 
services within society? Many economists believe that only the ﬁrst is a meaningful goal—
the second should just take care of itself through market allocation. Or if markets result in an 
unacceptable distribution, some economists suggest that politicians can always step in and 
make whatever redistributions are necessary. But what are the consequences of a distribution 
of income and assets that is highly unequal? How does economic policy relate to inequality? 
Because of growing inequality, both in the United States and abroad, it is an issue to which 
many more economists than in the past have been paying attention.
1. DEFINING AND MEASURING INEQUALITY
We can think of social equality as a “goal” in economics, just as efﬁciency is an important 
goal. But there is an important difference. Few would argue that we could be “too” efﬁcient. 
As long as efﬁciency is carefully deﬁned and is not pursued in ways that are destructive to 
other goals, the more efﬁcient we are, the better. The same does not hold for equality. Whether 
we are talking about income, opportunities, or education, it is possible to be “too equal.” 
Few desire a society in which everyone earns the same exact income or where everyone is 
a carpenter or a Ph.D. Our goal should be to strive to be a society that is neither “too equal” 
nor “too unequal.”
How do we know whether we are successful? This is a more complex issue than dealing 
with efﬁciency because, as we will see, it is impossible to prescribe a degree of inequality that 
works ideally for everyone. Compounding the problem is that inequality, unlike efﬁciency, 
presents a problem that has both an ethical and an economic dimension.
1.1 INEQUALITY OF WHAT?
When the subject of inequality is raised, most people think of income or wealth inequality. 
Because this is an economics textbook, we also emphasize these, especially inequality of 
income. But it is important to recognize that inequality is a broader concept that extends 
beyond the realm of money.
Let us consider a few examples. Public health is an area in which vast inequality exists. 
Preventable or treatable diseases in numerous tropical countries (such as malaria, measles, 
and tuberculosis) cause average life expectancy to be signiﬁcantly shorter than in the United 
States or in other rich countries. There is also signiﬁcant health inequality within many 
countries. Increasingly, access to adequate medical care can make a difference in terms of 
whether one can obtain effective treatment for a particular ailment. This is generally not 
much of a problem in advanced industrialized countries that have a “single payer” system, 

252 
CHAPTER 11 — ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INEQUALITY
but in countries that lack universal health insurance one’s health condition can be dictated 
by whether one can reliably see a doctor, which often depends on whether one has adequate 
insurance coverage.
There is also a considerable imbalance in education, both nationally and internationally. The 
majority of adults in the United States lack a college education, which today is regarded as 
almost indispensable to economic success (as we saw last chapter). However, most Americans 
do have a high school degree. Although this is true in other rich countries, it is not the case in 
most others. Primary and secondary education are not a priority in many parts of the world, 
where poverty and hunger are widespread—not to mention violence or civil war, as well 
as gender discrimination, which makes it especially hard for girls to go to school in some 
countries. Even where families want to send their children to school, national governments 
often lack the funds to support basic education. Without a proper education, many millions 
are inadequately prepared for competing in today’s global economy.
Related to both health and education is what Nobel laureate Amartya Sen has famously 
referred to as “capabilities.” By his reckoning, money is only one dimension—albeit an 
important one—of an individual’s “capability” to function in his or her economic environment. 
To Sen, what matters most is that people possess the necessary tools—for example, money, 
health, education, friends, social connections—to provide them with realistic economic 
choices. As Sen has pointed out, there is considerable inequality of capabilities in the world, 
not just in the poor countries.
Inequality is also manifest in certain environmental outcomes. Proponents of “environmental 
justice,” generally studying the United States, point out that polluting industries and toxic 
waste disposal sites tend to be located disproportionately near poor and minority communities. 
This effect is even more pronounced in countries like Ecuador and Brazil. Tribal residents 
in Ecuador confront widespread pollution from petroleum extraction in the remote areas 
where they live as well as extensive harm to their local habitat. Native Brazilians suffer 
from the environmental toxicity of the gold-mining process as well as from the alteration 
of their landscape resulting from deforestation. These effects are generally associated with 
inequality—not of income but of land ownership or property rights. People who reside in 
these areas often lack the legal power to keep the miners or timber companies out.
One also sees considerable inequality when confronting the issue of climate change. 
Countries with sizable portions of land near sea level—for example, Egypt and Bangladesh—
are likely to be affected by climate change in the coming decades more adversely than, say, the 
mountain kingdom of Bhutan. Some of the most northern countries, like Canada and Russia, 
may actually beneﬁt, at least in the short term, from climate change, in that warmer global 
temperatures would lengthen the agricultural season and potentially allow these countries 
to produce crops that they formerly could not. In addition to these speciﬁc effects, however, 
a critical fact about climate change, as well as other environmental damage, is that the rich 
can protect themselves much better than the poor can.
1.2 MEASURING INEQUALITY
To illustrate one approach for measuring inequality, we begin by looking at the distribution of 
household income in the United States in 2011 (Table 11.1). The data are arranged in order of 
income, and the share of the total income “pie” that accrues to each twentieth percentile (or 
quintile) is in the second column. To understand what this table means, imagine dividing up 
U.S. households into ﬁve equal-sized groups, with the poorest households all in one group, 
the next-poorest in the next group, and so on. The last group contains the richest quintile 
among all households. The poorest quintile, with household incomes below $20,262, received 
only 3.2 percent of all the household income in the country. The richest quintile, those with 
incomes of $101,582 or more, received 51.5 percent—in other words, more than half—of all 
the income received in the United States.

 
DEFINING AND MEASURING INEQUALITY 
253
Suppose that we further separate the richest group into two groups: those with income 
of less than $176,000 and those with income higher than this. The group with household 
income above $176,000 constitutes the richest 5 percent, or one-twentieth, of the population. 
As we can see, this richest 5 percent earned 22.3 percent of national income, close to the 
amount earned by all of those in the fourth quintile. (See also ﬁgures illustrating similar 
points in Chapter 0.)
Based on these data, we can now construct many different measures of inequality. For 
instance, we could calculate the ratio of the income share of the richest ﬁfth to that of the 
poorest ﬁfth of the population; in this case, we obtain 51.1/3.2 = 16.0—that is, a household in 
the richest quintile has about 16 times the income, on average, of a household in the poorest 
quintile. We can then see how this ratio has changed over time to track changes in inequality. 
For example, in 1979 this ratio was only about 7, indicating an increase in inequality between 
the richest and poorest ﬁfth of the population.
However, a simple ratio is somewhat arbitrary, focusing on some parts of the income 
distribution while ignoring others. Economists frequently prefer to use a more comprehensive 
measure that reﬂects the shape of the entire income distribution. This measure ﬁrst involves 
creating a graph of the income distribution, referred to as a Lorenz curve—named after Max 
Lorenz, the statistician who ﬁrst developed the technique. A Lorenz curve for household 
income in the United States is shown in Figure 11.1. In this graph, the horizontal axis 
represents households, lined up from left to right in order of increasing income. The vertical 
axis measures the cumulative percentage of all income received by households up to a given 
income level.

CHAPTER 11 — ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INEQUALITY
We use the data in Table 11.1 to draw the Lorenz curve in Figure 11.1. Point A represents 
the fact that the poorest 20 percent of households received 3.2 percent of all income. To 
obtain Point B, we need to calculate the cumulative percent of income received by the bottom 
40 percent of households. So we add the income received by the bottom 20 percent to the 
income received by the next 20 percent. Thus the cumulative percent of income received by 
the bottom 40 percent is 3.2 + 8.4 = 11.6 percent of total income. For point C, we need to 
calculate the cumulative percent of income received by the bottom 60 percent of households, 
which is 3.2 + 8.4 + 14.3 = 25.9 percent of total income. Similarly, point D shows that the 
income share of the bottom 80 percent is 48.9 percent of all income. Finally, point E shows 
that the bottom 95 percent received 77.7 percent of all income (everyone except the top 
5 percent). The Lorenz curve must start at the origin, at the lower left corner of the graph 
(because 0 percent of households have 0 percent of the total income) and must end at point 
F in the upper right corner (because 100 percent of households must have 100 percent of the 
total income).
The Lorenz curve provides information about the degree of income inequality in a country. 
Note that the 45-degree line in Figure 11.1 represents a situation of absolute equality. If 
every household had the same exact income, then, for example, the “bottom” 40 percent of 
households would receive 40 percent of all income. This is shown by point G in Figure 11.1. 
Imagine the other extreme—a situation in which one household received all the income in 
a country. In this case, the Lorenz curve would be a ﬂat line along the horizontal axis at a 
value of zero until the very end, where it would suddenly shoot up to 100 percent of income 
(at point F). 
Of course these two extremes do not occur in reality, but they indicate that the closer a 
country’s Lorenz curve is to the 45-degree line, the more equal its income distribution. This 
is illustrated in Figure 11.2, which shows the Lorenz curve for three countries: Sweden, the 
United States, and Bolivia. Income is distributed relatively equally in Sweden; its Lorenz 
curve is closer to the 45-degree line of absolute equality than the U.S. Lorenz curve. Bolivia 
is an example of a country which has greater income inequality than the U.S.; its Lorenz 
curve bows further from the line of absolute equality.
The more the Lorenz curve bows away from the line of absolute equality, the greater is 
the extent of inequality in the income distribution. This observation led a statistician by the 
name of Corrado Gini to introduce a numerical measure of inequality that came to be known

The closer the Lorenz curve is to the

DEFINING AND MEASURING INEQUALITY 
255
as the Gini ratio (or “Gini coefﬁcient”), which is deﬁned as the ratio of the area between the 
Lorenz curve and the diagonal line of equality to the total area under the diagonal line.
Referring to areas A and B in Figure 11.3, the Gini ratio is A/(A+B). Clearly, the Gini 
ratio can vary from 0 for absolute equality (since in such a case area A would equal zero as 
the Lorenz curve overlaps the line of absolute equality) to 1 for absolute inequality (where 
area B would equal zero). According to U.S. Census Bureau calculations, the Gini ratio for 
U.S. household income in 2011 was 0.477. We will present international comparisons of 
inequality, along with data trends, later in the chapter.
You might be wondering about some details of the measure of income we are using. Higher-
income people, after all, pay more taxes, so they really do not have control over all the money 
income that they have been counted as receiving. Meanwhile, poor people may qualify for means-
tested programs, including noncash programs such as food stamps, or for subsidized housing and 
medical care, and arguably the value of these programs should be included as part of income.
On the basis of considerations like these, the U.S. Census Bureau has experimented with at 
least 15 different deﬁnitions of income. One deﬁnition, for example, is meant to approximate 
what the distribution of income would be if—hypothetically—the impact of government 
activity were excluded. For this deﬁnition, the Census Bureau starts with the measure of 
pretax money income that we have been working with until now and subtracts government 
cash transfers (such as welfare payments). Then it adds the value of health insurance fringe 
beneﬁts paid by businesses for their (often middle-class or higher) employees and the value 
of net capital gains (usually earned by the relatively wealthy). Under this deﬁnition, the Gini 
ratio, not surprisingly, rises, showing greater inequality. The share of the bottom ﬁfth drops 
considerably, while the share of the top ﬁfth rises.
Adjusting that measure of income for the effects of the tax system causes some change at 
the top, but little at the bottom. When the Census Bureau further adds in the effects of both 
cash government transfer programs and noncash programs (such as food stamps, Medicare, 
and Medicaid), the distribution becomes somewhat less unequal. Government tax and transfer 
policies—and especially the transfer side—have signiﬁcant effects on the U.S. household 
income distribution. Even with the most thorough accounting for aid to low-income households 
from transfer payments, however, the income of the top ﬁfth of the population is still roughly 
ten times that of the bottom ﬁfth.
How much importance should we place on income inequality and the Gini index? Many 
important goods and services are, after all, obtained without the use of cash income. Many 
families prefer to produce at least some services (such as child care and cooking) for 
themselves. In addition, many of the things that we enjoy—such as pleasant parks, safe 
roads, or clean air—add to our well-being without requiring payments out of our cash 
Gini ratio (or Gini 
coefﬁcient): a mea-
sure of inequality, 
based on the Lorenz 
curve, that goes from 
0 (absolute equality) 
up to 1 (absolute 
inequality). Greater 
inequality shows up as 
a larger area between 
the Lorenz curve and 
the diagonal line of 
absolute equality.

CHAPTER 11 — ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INEQUALITY
income (although some of these things are ﬁnanced through taxes). If we were to look at 
the distribution of well-being rather than just the distribution of income, we would need 
to take account of these nonincome sources of important goods and services. Some of 
these goods may contribute to lessening inequality—for example, everyone, rich or poor, 
can enjoy a public park or use a public library. Evidence suggests, however, that at least 
in some cases the distribution of such nonpurchased goods may accentuate, rather than 
lessen, measures of inequality. For example, as noted earlier, proponents of “environmental 
justice” point out that polluting industries and toxic waste disposal sites tend to be located 
disproportionately near poor and minority communities. Moreover, considerable evidence 
indicates that families that are money-poor are also time-poor; they cannot devote the time 
that they would wish to child care and cooking, often being forced to use the television 
as the babysitter and to depend on fast foods for meals—with serious known health 
consequences.
Gini coefﬁcients may also be calculated for the distribution of wealth rather than income. 
This distribution, which depends on what people own in assets, tends to be much more 
unequal than income distribution. Most people own relatively little wealth, relying mainly on 
labor income and perhaps government or family transfers to support their expenditures. It is 
even possible to have negative net wealth. This happens when the value of a person’s debts 
(e.g., for a car, house, or credit cards) is higher than the value of her assets. For people in the 
middle class, the equity that they have in their house is often their most signiﬁcant asset. By 
contrast, those who do own substantial wealth are generally in a position to put much of it 
into assets that increase in value over time or yield a ﬂow of income and dividends—which 
can in turn be invested in the acquisition of still more assets.
The distribution of wealth is, however, less frequently and less systematically recorded than 
the distribution of income—in part because wealth can be hard to measure. Much wealth is 
held in the form of unrealized capital gains. A household realizes—turns into actual dollars—
capital gains if it sells an appreciated asset, such as shares in a company, land, or antiques, 
for more than the price at which it purchased the asset. An asset can appreciate in value for a 
long time before it is actually sold. No one, however, will know exactly how much such an 
asset has really gained or lost in value until the owner actually does sell it, thus “realizing” the 
capital gain. Another reason that it is harder to get information on wealth is that although the 
government requires people to report their annual income from wages and many investments 
for tax purposes, it does not require everyone to regularly and comprehensively report their 
asset holdings. Finally, wealth consists not only of ﬁnancial assets but also commodities, 
paintings, real estate, and the like. Such disparate forms of wealth make estimating aggregate 
wealth statistics reliably much more cumbersome.
These caveats notwithstanding, estimates of the U.S. Gini ratio for the distribution of 
wealth are in the neighborhood of 0.8, and those for most other countries are also considerably 
higher than the corresponding income Gini ratios. Should we be concerned about such a 
global concentration of wealth?
To be sure, ownership of wealth is usually a very good thing, because it can help households 
maintain their accustomed consumption patterns, if income temporarily becomes low. But 
contemplating such vast wealth inequality brings us back to the question of opportunity. Are 
there sufﬁcient compensatory assets available to those with little or even negative wealth? It 
is critically important not to ignore wealth inequality because it bears heavily on the much 
more advertised income inequality. And the effect is cumulative: To the extent that income 
is unequally distributed, it will further concentrate wealth.
Perhaps most important, great wealth confers its owners with both economic and 
political power. When the ownership of wealth is highly uneven, the power to direct 
the operations of businesses and to inﬂuence government policy through campaign 
contributions and the like may become concentrated in the hands of relatively few. We 
return to this point below.

DATA AND TRENDS 
257
Discussion Questions
1. What is the difference between inequality of incomes and inequality of “capabili-
ties”? How are the two related? Which one do you think deserves more attention from 
policymakers?
2. What do you think is the minimal amount of annual income that an individual, or a small 
family, would need to live in your community? (Think about the rent or mortgage on a one- or 
two-bedroom residence, etc.) What does this probably mean about where the average level 
of income in your community ﬁts into the U.S. income distribution shown in Table 11.1?
2. DATA AND TRENDS
We now have a quantitative method to use for comparing inequality, both across different 
populations and over time. Yet it is important to fully understand that, although Gini coefﬁ-
cients help us measure the extent of inequality that exists, they do not help us decide whether 
the inequality is acceptable or excessive. This will always be a judgment call, and different 
people will render different judgments.
2.1 INEQUALITY IN THE UNITED STATES
No one disputes that income inequality in the United States has generally increased in recent 
decades. We can see this in Figure 11.4, which shows the Gini coefﬁcient in the U.S. from 
1967 to 2010, based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The Gini coefﬁcient reached a 
record low of 0.386 in 1968. After that, the Gini coefﬁcient increased in 31 of the next 42 
years. In 2010 the Gini coefﬁcient reached a record high of 0.469.
While comparable government data are not available for the years prior to 1968, 
academic researchers have estimated longer trends in income inequality by focusing on 
the share of total income going to the top income groups. Figure 11.5 shows the income 
share of the top 10 percent and the top 1 percent from 1917 to 2012. After the Great 
Depression, the share of income going to the top income groups generally declined, 
suggesting that income inequality was decreasing. The share of income going to the 
top 10 percent remained low at around 32 percent from 1950 until the early 1970s. The 
share of income going to the top 1 percent reached a low of less than 8 percent in the

early 1970s. Since the early 1970s, the income share going to these top groups has increased, 
surpassing the high levels that occurred prior to the Great Depression.
As mentioned earlier, inequality of wealth tends to be even higher than inequality of income. 
This is illustrated in Figure 11.6, which shows the distribution of wealth in the United States 
in 2009. We see that the top 1 percent own more than a third of all wealth in the U.S., and the 
top ﬁfth (the 80th percentile and above) own 87 percent of wealth. Collectively, the bottom 80 
percent own only 13 percent of all wealth. Analysis of wealth data suggests that wealth inequality 
has also increased in recent decades. For more on wealth inequality, see Box 11.1.
We can look at inequality from several other perspectives. For example, inequality is clearly 
evident across race in the United States, as shown in Table 11.2. Asian households have the 
highest median annual income, about $69,000, while black households have the lowest at only 
$33,000. Married couples, with the potential for two adult workers, have higher incomes than 
households with just one adult male or female. Among households with just one adult, male

DATA AND TRENDS 
259
BOX 11.1 WEALTH INEQUALITY IN THE UNITED STATES
Figure 11.6 presented data on the actual distribution 
of wealth in the United States. However, political de-
bates about inequality are often based upon percep-
tions rather than facts. In a 2011 paper, researchers 
Michael Norton and Dan Ariely surveyed people 
regarding their perceptions of wealth inequality in the 
U.S. Speciﬁcally, respondents were asked to estimate 
what percentage of total wealth was owned by each 
wealth quintile. Further, they also asked people to con-
struct their ideal distribution of wealth, again assigning 
a percentage of total wealth to each quintile.
The results are presented in Figure 11.7, along 
with the actual distribution of wealth in the U.S. We 
see, for example, that the top quintile actually own 
84 percent of all wealth in the U.S. according to the 
paper. (Note that the “actual” distribution of wealth in 
Figure 11.7 differs from the distribution given in Figure 
11.6—the two ﬁgures rely upon different data sources 
and apply to different years.) However, respondents 
estimated that the top quintile only owned 59 percent 
of all wealth. But most respondents thought that this 
estimated concentration of wealth was excessive. On 
average, their ideal wealth distribution allocated only 
32 percent of all wealth to the top quintile.
Looking at the other end of the wealth spectrum, 
the bottom quintile actually owns only 0.1 percent 
of wealth in the U.S. Respondents estimated that 
the bottom quintile owns about 3 percent of wealth. 
According to their ideal distribution, the bottom quin-
tile should own about 11 percent of all wealth.
The results clearly illustrate the difference between 
reality, perceptions, and subjective preferences. 
Norton and Ariely draw two primary messages from 
the results:
First, a large nationally representative sample of 
Americans seems to prefer to live in a country more 
like Sweden than like the United States. Americans 
also construct ideal distributions that are far more 
equal than they estimated the United States to be—
estimates which themselves were far more equal 
than the actual level of inequality. Second, there 
was much more consensus than disagreement 
across groups from different sides of the politi-
cal spectrum about this desire for a more equal 
distribution of wealth, suggesting that Americans 
may possess a commonly held ‘‘normative’’ 
standard for the distribution of wealth despite the 
many disagreements about policies that affect that 
distribution, such as taxation and welfare.

According to a 2011 paper by 
Michael Norton and Dan Ariely, 
Americans tend to signiﬁcantly 
underestimate the degree of wealth 
inequality in the United States. The 
ideal distribution of wealth, according 
to most Americans, is even more 
equal than their incorrect estimates.

CHAPTER 11 — ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INEQUALITY
households have higher incomes than female households. Median incomes increase with age 
up until age 55, and then decline as people retire. Finally, households in metropolitan areas 
have higher incomes than those outside of metropolitan areas. 
Economic inequalities based on race, age, and other demographic factors are even more 
pronounced when we consider household wealth. Table 11.3 presents data on the median 
value of household assets for different types of households. While white households’ 
incomes are 61 percent higher than the incomes of black households, the assets of white 
households are more than 17 times higher than those of black households! Hispanic 
households also have little in assets. We see that education has a signiﬁcant impact on 
household assets. For example, those with a college degree have about three times the 
household wealth as those with a high school diploma. The median value of household 
assets also tends to rise with age.
Some inequality is to be expected in any society given that people’s incomes and assets 
tend to increase as they become older and more established in their careers. So at any point 
in time in a country, we are likely to have younger people with relatively low incomes and 
few assets, middle-aged people with higher incomes and more assets, and retirees who tend 
to have relatively low incomes but relatively high assets. Thus we have people moving from 
lower income groups to higher income groups, and vice versa. This possibility of people or 
households to change their economic status, for better or worse, is called economic mobility. 
For a given level of economic inequality, we may be more tolerant if economic mobility 
is higher because it implies that people have the opportunity to improve their economic 
condition.
A common way to measure economic mobility is to track the frequency with which individuals 
or households move into different income groups. A study by economists at Harvard University

and the University of California at Berkeley found that, overall, the chance that a child in the 
United States from the bottom ﬁfth (with household income below $25,000) could get into 
the top ﬁfth by age 30 was about 8 percent.1 They found that economic mobility in the U.S. 
varied considerably across metropolitan areas. The chances of moving from the lower ﬁfth to 
the highest were as high as 11 percent in Salt Lake City and San Francisco, and as low as 4 
percent in Atlanta and 5 percent in Detroit.
2.2 CROSS-COUNTRY COMPARISONS
The Gini ratio for the United States is higher than that of all other major industrialized 
countries, signifying that the country has a higher degree of income inequality. Figure 11.8 
shows the range in income inequality across different countries. Sweden, with a Gini ratio 
of 0.23, has the lowest degree of income inequality of any country. Income inequality is also 
low in Germany and Canada. While many of the countries with the lowest income inequal-
ity are also high-income countries, inequality is also low in Hungary, Belarus, Ethiopia, and 
Pakistan, among others.
Patterns across geographic regions are fairly consistent. Latin American countries, for example, 
tend to have relatively high degrees of inequality. In addition to Brazil and Mexico, Guatemala 
has a Gini coefﬁcient of 0.55, Honduras 0.58, and Haiti and Colombia 0.59. Asian countries, in 
contrast, appear, by this measure, to be more economically equal. Most countries in the Asian 
continent have Gini coefﬁcients between 0.3 and 0.4. Sub-Saharan Africa appears to have the 
greatest variability, ranging from 0.30 (Ethiopia) to 0.63 (South Africa and Lesotho).

CHAPTER 11 — ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INEQUALITY
In the related area of mobility, a variety of studies have shown that economic mobility in 
the United States is lower than in a number of other rich countries, including Japan, Canada, 
Australia, France, Germany, and the Nordic countries.2 A 2008 paper surveyed international 
research on economic mobility, looking speciﬁcally at how children’s incomes fare relative 
to their parents’ incomes. The results indicated that:
a growing number of economic studies have found that the United States stands out as 
having less, not more, inter-generational mobility than do Canada and several European 
countries. American children are more likely than other children to end up in the same 
place on the income distribution as their parents. Moreover, there is emerging evidence 
that mobility is particularly low for Americans born into families at the bottom of the 
earnings or income distribution.3
We have seen that from around 1930 until the late 1960s inequality diminished in the 
United States. The relatively recent intensiﬁcation of inequality is not limited to the United 
States. According to a recent OECD study, income inequality has been increasing over the 
past few decades in most, if not all, rich countries. Inequality may not be automatically 
self-perpetuating, but there is some evidence of a consistent pattern of increased inequality 
in rich countries. To what can this be attributed? The next section explores some possible 
causes and consequences.
Discussion Questions
1. Were your parents better off economically than their parents? Do you believe that you will 
be better off than your parents? Do you think that this is true of most of your friends?
2. Do you think the fact that the United States is more unequal than other rich countries is 
an advantage or disadvantage? Why?
3. CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF INEQUALITY
The question of why inequality has been increasing in the United States and many other countries 
is a source of much debate. We now consider several of the explanations proposed by economists, 
recognizing that rising inequality is something that cannot be attributed to a single cause. We 
then turn to a discussion of the consequences of a high degree of inequality in a society.

CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF INEQUALITY 
263
3.1 CAUSES
One point on which economists appear to agree is that some of the increase in inequality is 
due to changing demographics. As people worldwide live longer on average, the proportion 
of the population that is elderly increases. This trend, coupled with an increase in the rate of 
single parenthood, has tended to drive down incomes at the low end. People too old to work 
and people in single-parent households (where paid work and caring activities compete for 
a limited resource—the adult’s time) often lack economic resources. About 23 percent of 
U.S. children live in poor families. (A household is deﬁned as poor if its income falls below 
a poverty threshold based on its family size. In 2013, the poverty threshold for a family of 
four was $23,550.) Meanwhile, the increasing number of women entering the labor force has 
helped boost the income of married-couple households at the top of the income range.
Another factor that helps explain growing inequality is that the wage “share” of the income 
“pie” has diminished over time. Wages and salaries make up the majority of labor income, 
which includes the implicit value of fringe beneﬁts. Capital income includes rents, proﬁts, 
and interest. “Rent,” as economists use the term, refers not just to rent for housing but to 
payments for the use of any capital asset, such as machinery or an e-mail list. (See Box 11.2 
on “rent-seeking.”) In general, higher-income households receive a larger portion of their 
total income from capital income.
The shrinking of wages as a share of total income over time suggests that inequality is 
intensifying because it means that the 60 or 70 percent of the population with the lowest 
incomes are falling behind, relative to those who count on proﬁts and rent—as interest 
payments and dividends—as major sources of income. Generally, a declining wage share over 
time suggests that wage growth, if present, is not keeping up with overall economic growth. 
This has, in fact, been the case over the past four decades or so, and is partially responsible 
for rising inequality. Since 1970, the share of total income that comes from wages in the 
United States has fallen from about 72 percent to less than 64 percent.
Similar trends have been observed in most of the other rich countries. The critical question 
is why this has been happening, and on this there is no universal agreement. In what follows, 
we look at some of the more likely causes.
The ﬁrst likely factor in increased inequality is globalization and the growth in trade that 
it produces. Because markets are increasingly interconnected, domestic producers of certain 
goods encounter greater competition from imports from other countries. In many instances, 
labor income: pay-
ment to workers, in-
cluding wages, salaries, 
and fringe beneﬁts
capital income: 
rents, proﬁts, and 
interest
rent: payments for 
the direct or indirect 
use of any capital 
assets
BOX 11.2 RENT SEEKING AND INEQUALITY
“Rent seeking” refers to the act of expending time or other 
resources in the hope of obtaining value that already 
exists somewhere else instead of using those resources 
to produce new economic value. In other words, a rent 
seeker will try to provoke redistribution of existing wealth 
in his or her favor instead of generating new wealth.
One example of rent seeking is when lobbyists try to 
convince government ofﬁcials to adopt policies favor-
able to their interests, at the expense of other economic 
actors. This is considered rent seeking because, even 
though such lobbying can produce beneﬁts for the lob-
byists’ employers, it does not generate new economic 
value. One could even make the case that it subtracts 
from value creation in an “opportunity cost” sense: by 
diverting potentially useful or productive resources for 
the purpose of some zero-sum gain.
The effect of rent seeking can be to exacerbate 
inequality, because those who are already rich and 
powerful are most effective at directing government 
support and subsidies to themselves. The economist 
Mancur Olson has proposed a depressing scenario 
in which countries tend to grow less competitive and 
efﬁcient over time, as organized interest and lobby 
groups gain in importance, and are increasingly able 
to inﬂuence government.
Clearly, the motivation of groups such as the 
Occupy Wall Street movement and other critics of 
inequality and the dominance of the top “1 percent,” 
is based on a perception that much of the wealth of 
those at the very top is based on rent-seeking activities 
rather than genuine economic productivity.

264 
CHAPTER 11 — ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INEQUALITY
the price of such imports is signiﬁcantly lower than that for the domestically produced good, 
compelling the producer either to lower prices (and therefore wages, too) or simply leave the 
business. Competition from imports has indeed eliminated many industrial jobs—in textiles 
and automobiles, for example—that formerly fell in the middle of the U.S. wage distribution. 
The replacement of such jobs by lower-income service and retail jobs has probably contributed 
to the increase in inequality, although economists generally do not consider it a major factor, 
as it may explain only 10 percent of the increase.
It is worth noting that, while job opportunities and wages in certain sectors are decreasing 
in countries like the United States, they are increasing in many poor countries that previously 
lacked opportunities to produce for a global market. In this sense, freer trade may reduce 
inequality across countries.
The second, perhaps more important, factor has been the advent of rapid technological 
change. New technologies related to computers and biotechnology have become more 
important, increasing the income of skilled workers who understand and use the new 
techniques and equipment, while leaving behind the less-skilled workers who remain in low-
technology occupations. The income of the skilled workers has risen relative to those of the 
less skilled simply because their skills are relatively scarce. Recalling our discussion of the 
labor market in Chapter 10, labor resembles other commodities in the sense that the more 
scarce it is (i.e., there is less supply), the higher its “price.” The less-skilled workers are, in 
contrast, relatively abundant, depressing their average wage or “price.”
Technological change has also, especially in the long run, led machines to replace human 
workers for certain types of jobs (especially in services), making workers at the “low-skill” 
end of the spectrum especially abundant. It has contributed substantially to what we deﬁned 
in Chapter 10 as labor market segmentation, which is a polarization of the labor market into 
groups of “high-skill” jobs at one end and many more “low-skill” jobs at the other end. A 
deﬁning feature of a segmented labor market is its inﬂexibility; it is extremely difﬁcult, if 
not impossible, to move from one segment to the other.
The third likely cause of rising income inequality is the progressive weakening of labor 
unions, especially in the United States. Government policy has become decidedly less 
supportive of unions and low-wage workers, and the rate of participation in them has declined 
markedly, as discussed in Chapter 10. Recall that labor union membership in the United States 
declined from a peak of around 25 percent in the 1950s to only about 11 percent today. 
The ﬁnal reason proposed to explain rising inequality is that policies have been instituted 
that, intentionally or unintentionally, have led to higher inequality. There have, for example, 
been a series of tax cuts—starting in the 1980s under President Ronald Reagan, but continuing 
during George W. Bush’s presidency—that primarily reduced the tax burden on the wealthiest 
groups. (The Bush tax cuts were partially reversed by the Obama administration in January 
2013.) The primary consequence for the distribution of income has been this: For the past few 
decades, rather than providing tax revenue to the government, the richest households have 
increasingly been lending it money at interest through government bonds (the loans were 
necessary as a result of the shortfall in tax revenue), thus allowing the wealthy continued 
access to their capital. Economists such as Paul Krugman maintain that tax policy over the 
past four decades has indeed increased income inequality by enabling far greater access to 
capital for the wealthiest Americans than for lower-income ones.
Another policy change has been reduction in welfare expenditures, starting in the 1990s, 
with the phasing out of programs such as Aid for Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). 
The federal minimum wage ($7.25 as of 2013) has fallen signiﬁcantly behind inﬂation, 
lowering the purchasing power of the lowest-income workers. In addition to directly reducing 
such subsidies to the poor, the diminished generosity of the welfare state also adversely affects 
workers’ bargaining power, hence their wage. With less government beneﬁts on which to rely, 
employees threatened with unemployment are more likely to accept a wage cut. Researchers 
have found a direct relationship between a reduction of the welfare state in the European 

 
CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF INEQUALITY 
265
Union—where, because of its greater initial size, cuts have been more dramatic—and the 
increase in inequality that has resulted in most EU countries.
As noted earlier, many of these policy changes have a political as well as economic 
component. A major problem associated with increased inequality is that those who gain a 
greater share of total wealth are able to translate it into greater political power. This plays 
out through the U.S. system of campaign ﬁnance, in which candidates for political ofﬁce 
can accept disproportionate donations from wealthy individuals or large corporations with 
an interest in, say, keeping taxes low for the rich or minimizing regulations on the ﬁnancial 
sector. Well-endowed individuals or companies may also hire representatives (or lobbyists) to 
seek private interviews with inﬂuential politicians, in hopes of ensuring favorable legislation. 
This is another example of “rent-seeking” activity that does not produce any economic value 
but, rather, redistributes it, accentuating other trends towards greater income inequality. 
3.2 CONSEQUENCES
Recall from Chapter 9 that consumers’ marginal utility of successive units of a good tends to 
decrease. Economic evidence suggests the same is true of income. For example, an additional 
$1,000 in income when one is making $20,000 per year tends to provide greater marginal 
utility than when one is making $50,000 per year. While some economists avoid making 
interpersonal comparisons of utility, a reasonable implication of this principle is that overall 
welfare may be lower in a society with a high degree of inequality as opposed to a society 
with a low degree of inequality, assuming the same amount of total income. So from a social 
welfare perspective too much inequality may be economically inefﬁcient as well as unfair.
Many researchers have studied the relationship between economic status and other measures 
of well-being. Intuitively, it seems reasonable that those with low incomes and little assets 
tend to have reduced access to quality education, adequate health care, and other resources. 
And the facts do support this view, see Box 11.3. 
BOX 11.3 INEQUALITY IN THE UNITED STATES
While most attention regarding inequality in the United 
States has focused on income, inequality is evident 
in many other ways. Despite being one of the richest 
countries in the world, the United States has the highest 
level of infant and maternal mortality among devel-
oped nations. Life expectancy in the U.S. is one of the 
lowest among developed nations. Richer households 
in the U.S. generally have access to adequate, if not 
excellent, health care. Thus the main reason that the 
U.S. ranks so poorly according to these measures is 
that those at the bottom fare so poorly.
The same is true with education. Richer households 
can afford to send their children to high-quality schools, 
while most students from disadvantaged families at-
tend school with lower-quality resources. Consider that 
the gap between American students at the top and 
those at the middle, according to standardized tests, 
is equivalent to the gap between the average scores 
of the U.S. and Azerbaijan. 
While inequality in the U.S. has been increasing 
for decades, so far the policy response has been 
negligible. Proposals by President Barack Obama to 
reduce inequality include raising the minimum wage, 
improving infrastructure, and universal preschool for 
4-year-olds. However, in a highly partisan environ-
ment, such proposals seem unlikely to meet approval 
in Congress. 
You would think Americans must be tiring of their 
lack of progress. The disposable income of families 
in the middle of the income distribution shrank by 
4 percent between 2000 and 2010, according to 
data compiled by the O.E.C.D. In Australia, by 
contrast, it increased 40 percent. Middle-income 
Germans, Dutch, French, Danes, Norwegians and 
even Mexicans gained more ground. 
 And indeed Americans are tiring of it. Over 
half—52 percent—say that the government should 
redistribute wealth by taxing the rich more, accord-
ing to a Gallup poll in April, the highest share since 
Gallup ﬁrst asked the question in 1998.

266 
CHAPTER 11 — ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INEQUALITY
But going even further, we consider whether a high degree of inequality imposes broad 
costs on society—impacts that not only affect the poor, but all members of society. One 
of the most studied issues is the relationship between inequality and health. Imagine two 
countries with the exact same average income levels. However, one of these countries has a 
high degree of economic inequality, while the other has low inequality. Are health outcomes 
better in the country with lower inequality?
In their 2009 book The Spirit Level, Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett (both 
epidemiologists) argue that higher inequality, ceteris paribus, is indeed associated with 
reduced health. They reason that economic and social inequality creates stress and anxiety, 
which increases one’s susceptibility to disease and also leads to destructive behaviors like 
substance abuse. They support their position by presenting data showing that rich countries 
with greater inequality tend to have lower life expectancy, higher rates of infant mortality, 
and higher rates of mental illness. In addition to the relationship between inequality and 
health, Wilkinson and Pickett also ﬁnd that higher inequality is associated with various social 
problems, including homicide rates, teenage pregnancy, and school dropout rates. 
The ﬁndings of Wilkinson and Pickett that many social problems are a result of inequality 
are controversial. For example, a 2010 article in the Wall Street Journal criticized The Spirit 
Level for presenting selective data.4 Also, a 2003 journal article by health economist Angus 
Deaton concluded that “it is not true that income inequality itself is a major determinant of 
public health.”5 
There seems to be greater acceptance among economists that excessive inequality can lead 
to reduced economic growth. One reason is that economic reforms may be more difﬁcult to 
institute in unequal countries with concentrated political power. Also, if economic mobility is 
low, those at the bottom have little incentive to invest in their own productivity, and thus overall 
growth suffers. A 2011 study published by the International Monetary Fund found that greater 
equality is associated with longer periods of sustained economic growth.6 The paper concludes 
that “attention to inequality can bring signiﬁcant longer-run beneﬁts for growth.” 
In the 2001 book Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community, 
Robert Putnam argues that an inverse link exists between income inequality and social 
cohesion. He notes that greater equality causes people to trust one another more, and trust 
is a cornerstone of social welfare. Putnam has traced the relationship through the twentieth 
century and found that during periods when the United States had a more equal income 
distribution (such as the 1950s), there was much more community engagement in general, 
and that there has been much less over the past few decades as inequality has become 
more pronounced. 
Finally, inequality tends to perpetuate itself. We often prefer to believe that success in 
our society is based on individual merit, but in fact the family situation in which we start out 
tends to matter a great deal. Economic mobility is more difﬁcult in a more unequal society 
because the change in income needed to move to a higher income quintile becomes larger. 
Again, this maintains existing concentrations of political power, which reduces the possibility 
for broad-based economic and social reforms. Policies tend to be instituted which beneﬁt a 
powerful minority, while the preferences of the majority are not heard. 
Discussion Questions
1. If you could change a single one of the “causes” of inequality described above, on which 
would you choose to focus? Why?
2. People are often ashamed of coming from a relatively poor family, even if it is poor only 
relative to its immediate neighbors (and might appear wealthy to someone in another com-
munity, or another country). Why do you suppose this is? Do you think this psychological 
factor is relevant to the perpetuation of inequality in society?

 
RESPONDING TO INEQUALITY 
267
4. RESPONDING TO INEQUALITY
As we mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, there is no consensus regarding the “right” 
amount of inequality in a society. So before we consider what policies might be instituted 
to respond to inequality, we ﬁrst consider various philosophical perspectives on the topic of 
inequality. 
4.1 PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVES ON INEQUALITY
Unlike the goal of efﬁciency, which has a speciﬁc technical meaning that we have discussed 
in earlier chapters, there is no single standard of equity or fairness. Yet to many people, 
there is something disturbing about the current degree of income and wealth inequality in 
the United States. What are some standards that can be used to judge the kind and degree of 
equity in a society?
Several philosophical standards of equity have been suggested; we will focus on ﬁve 
standards here:
1. Equality of outcomes
2. Equality of opportunities
3. Equal rewards for equal contributions
4. Equal rights
5. The basic needs approach
Equality of outcomes is an easily stated—but rarely adopted—standard of equity which 
says that everyone should achieve the same level of well-being. The idea of everyone being 
equally happy has a certain appeal, but no country has ever tried to translate this into practice by 
precisely equalizing economic outcomes such as wealth or income. In all existing economies, 
at least some degree of inequality of outcomes is thought to serve as an important incentive 
for people to develop skills, to work, and to innovate.
Although complete equality is not a feasible goal, governments frequently seek 
to reduce the inequality of outcomes, and this has historically been done through 
redistribution. The most common example is the practice of taxing those who earn 
high incomes and redistributing some of the tax revenue to the most needy groups. The 
effectiveness of such a policy in reducing inequality has, however, varied considerably 
over time and across regions.
Equality of opportunity is another popular standard of equity, based on the thinking of, 
among others, the philosopher John Rawls. According to this principle, all individuals should 
have the same opportunity to create a life and a livelihood for themselves that will allow 
them to acquire the things that they value. After they have been given the same opportunities, 
people who are ambitious and want to work hard to acquire wealth should be able to do so. 
People who choose not to take as much advantage of these opportunities can accept a lesser 
economic standing. This standard has the appeal of rewarding effort, while putting everyone 
on a presumed “level playing ﬁeld.”
Unfortunately, this is much simpler and appealing in theory than it is in practice. 
Although a society can try to approach this standard through programs like public 
education and antidiscrimination laws, it is a hard standard to apply in any precise sense. 
If opportunity is to be equal in each generation, then no material wealth should be passed 
along by inheritance. It is not equitable for some children to be able to start out in safe 
neighborhoods with parents who encourage them, while others grow up surrounded by 
crime or indifference. Thus creating equal opportunity for the next generation would 
mean great changes in this one.
And what does it mean to create “equality of opportunity” if some people are naturally 
endowed with greater intelligence or talents than others? Should a society allow those 

268 
CHAPTER 11 — ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INEQUALITY
endowed with more talent to realize more economic gain for less work effort? The essential 
point is that when we speak of equality of opportunity, what we really mean is equality of the 
“wherewithal to conduct a prosperous, happy, and meaningful life,” and this “wherewithal” 
really comes down to assets, whether ﬁnancial, social, mental, physical, or other (recalling 
Amartya Sen’s concept, mentioned above, of “capabilities”). It is an essential point because, 
as we see, income inequality stems from asset inequality. If we address the latter, we go a long 
way toward correcting the former. This is not an easy thing to do because, while relatively 
few would object to a philosophy based on “equality of opportunity,” many more would 
strongly oppose “equality of total assets.”
The “equal rewards for equal contributions” principle is similar to the “equality of 
opportunity” concept, but it is more of an exchange-based standard that tends to conform 
to traditional economic logic. According to this standard, those who contribute the most to 
an economy should be entitled to receive the most in return. Discrimination should not be 
allowed among individuals who do the same work, according to this principle, but market 
outcomes, even fairly unequal ones, are acceptable, whether they are due to differences in work 
effort or innate talents. In support of this view, there is a long-standing belief that people are 
entitled both to the products of their labor and to the fruits of their property (where property 
is viewed as the product of past labor).
The fourth perspective on equality focuses on equal rights as opposed to a focus 
on income or wealth. Societies often specify certain rights to which each individual 
should have an equal claim (e.g., liberty, the pursuit of happiness). As another example, 
modern democracy usually assumes the principle of “one person, one vote.” This means 
that all eligible citizens have an equal right to cast a ballot and be fairly represented 
in the electoral system. Sen has suggested a rather direct link between democracy and 
economic outcomes. He points out that famines in which thousands or even millions of 
people die of hunger tend to occur in dictatorial states—even, sometimes, in the face of 
plentiful food supplies—and have not arisen in democratic ones, where those in power 
are accountable to the people.
A rights-based interpretation of equality assumes that equal rights are more fundamental to 
well-being than a particular level of material goods. There is no universal agreement, however, 
on just what these rights should include or on how they should be related to economic issues. 
Among the things that have been thought to belong to everyone by right, in some (but not 
all) countries, are free education, free health care, and easy access to resources for family 
planning.
Finally, attention to the least fortunate presents a different interpretation of equity. 
Sometimes referred to as the “basic needs” approach, it also echoes positions traditionally 
taken by many religions. According to this principle, the success of a society should 
be judged not by its members’ average, or total, well-being (if such a thing could 
be calculated) but, rather, by its treatment of those who are worst off. While some 
philosophers such as Rawls support this perspective, others are critical of it because 
it places disproportionate attention on the poorest groups. Focusing exclusively on the 
poorest groups ignores the fairness (or lack thereof) of the distribution over the middle 
and upper-income ranges.
Which deﬁnition of equity should an economist use? There is no simple answer; different 
people have strongly held political and ethical preferences for one or another concept of 
equity. It should be clear from our description that in particular situations, different concepts 
might have conﬂicting implications.
Yet few if any advocate either extreme inequality or complete equality. For many 
economists the question is how much inequality is tolerable, or desirable, and what policies 
are appropriate to achieve this desirable level. We turn to policies that can affect the degree 
of inequality in a society.

 
RESPONDING TO INEQUALITY 
269
4.2 TAX AND WAGE POLICIES
One way of reversing the trend toward greater inequality is through the tax system. By shift-
ing more of the overall tax burden to high-income households, after-tax income inequality 
can be reduced. As we will see in more detail in Chapter 12, federal income tax rates on 
the highest-income households in the United States have changed signiﬁcantly over time, 
from above 90 percent in the 1950s to as low as 28 percent in the 1980s. The maximum 
federal income tax rate is currently 39.6 percent. However, the tax rate that wealthy people 
actually pay is often considerably less than this due to tax provisions that allow them to 
claim many deductions, such as the mortgage interest on a second home. Also, income 
from investments, such as stocks and mutual funds, are taxed at a lower rate—a maximum 
of 20 percent.
Tax rates on those at the highest income levels have tended to decrease in recent decades. 
For example, a 2007 paper found that the top 0.01 percent in the U.S. paid over 70 percent 
of their income in federal taxes in 1960, but only about 30 percent in 2005.7 Some politicians 
have suggested reversing this trend by increasing tax rates at the top of the income spectrum, 
not necessarily to the levels of the 1950s but to ensure that wealthy households are not able 
to lower their taxes excessively through deductions. Speciﬁcally, in 2012 President Barack 
Obama proposed the “Buffet Rule,” named for billionaire investor Warren Buffet, who in 
2011 publicly stated that it was unfair that wealthy people like himself were able to pay a 
lower overall tax rate than many middle-class people. President Obama’s proposal was that 
households making more than $1 million per year should have to pay at least 30 percent of 
their total income in taxes regardless of how many deductions they could claim. This proposal, 
however, was unable to pass the U.S. Congress.
Another approach for reducing inequality is to increase the federal minimum wage, which 
is now $7.25 per hour. Although the federal minimum wage has been increased at times over 
the years, it has not kept up with inﬂation. If the minimum wage in the late 1960s is adjusted 
for inﬂation, in current dollars it comes to approximately $10 per hour. Many believe that 
the current $7.25 minimum is insufﬁcient even to provide for the basic necessities of a 
family. In several U.S. states, “living wage” campaigns have advocated passing legislation 
at the state level that requires a minimum wage higher than the federal standard. About 20 
states have a higher minimum wage than $7.25, the highest minimum wage being $9.19 in 
Washington state.
4.3 SPENDING PRIORITIES
Another area where reforms have the potential to redress inequality is government spending. 
There is little question that government spending priorities have long been skewed in a way 
that does not favor a more equitable distribution of income. Two important examples are 
military spending and debt ﬁnancing.
Defense expenditures have been estimated to be between one-fourth and one-third of the 
total federal budget. Critics suggest that this level of this expense is a relic of the cold war 
and that we could easily do with less. Because the military accounts for a sizable share of 
the budget, even a modest cutback would make a considerable amount of funds available in 
other areas that could increase economic opportunities for low-income households, such as 
better access to education and health care.
Debt ﬁnancing is another way that the federal budget effectively helps transfer income 
from the poor and middle classes to the wealthy. In recent years, between 6 percent and 12 
percent of the federal budget is devoted to paying interest on existing debt. (Recently it is 
on the low end, because of historically low interest rates). Because it is overwhelmingly 
the wealthy who own government bonds, they are the ones who receive these ﬂows from 
the government. To the extent that the government is able to reduce its relative debt 

270 
CHAPTER 11 — ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INEQUALITY
burden—raising taxes would be an effective way of doing this—doing so would contribute 
to reducing income inequality.
As for areas in which the government could spend more to address inequality, education 
stands out. As we saw in Chapter 10 and earlier this chapter, education levels are highly 
correlated with economic outcomes. According to the U.S. Department of Education, 
educational inequalities are increasing—meaning that the gap in education access and 
affordability between high and low income households is increasing.8 Under President 
Barack Obama, Pell grants to college students based on economic need have increased, but 
the Department of Education notes that the beneﬁts of more Pell grant money are likely 
to be more than offset by tuition increases. Policy recommendations of the Department 
of Education include further increasing need-based ﬁnancial assistance, expanding loan 
forgiveness for student debt, and promoting the ability of students to transfer from 2-year 
to 4-year colleges.
4.4 CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
It is increasingly evident that income and wealth in the United States are increasingly concen-
trated. As noted earlier, as wealth becomes concentrated in fewer hands, it also becomes more of 
a challenge to pursue countervailing reforms. Nonetheless, both economic theory and practical 
policy analysis suggest that policy reform can make a difference in reducing inequality.
In the aftermath of the Great Recession of 2007–9, much more attention has been focused 
on inequality, in the United States and in other countries. It is possible that this will lead to 
policy changes such as those discussed above. The high degree of inequality in the years 
leading up to the Great Depression (recall Figure 11.5) helped usher in the New Deal 
policies of the 1930s. Now that inequality has returned to, and even exceeded, the levels 
that existed prior to the Great Depression, many concerned citizens feel the time has ﬁnally 
come to address the issue. Thus the economic analysis both of inequality, and of policies 
to respond to inequality, is likely to be of great relevance in the immediate future.

12 Taxes and Tax Policy
Albert Einstein reportedly once said: “The hardest thing in the world to understand is income 
taxes.” It is true that taxes can be complicated. The United States federal tax code is more 
than 70,000 pages long. Browsing the tax code’s table of contents offers a glimpse into the 
vast complexity of federal taxation. Entire sections of the tax code apply speciﬁcally to the 
taxation of vaccines (Sec. 4131–4132), shipowners’ mutual protection and indemnity as-
sociations (Sec. 526), specially sweetened natural wines (Sec. 5385), and health beneﬁts for 
certain miners (Sec. 9711–9712).
Fortunately, one need not comprehend the imposing complexity of tax laws to understand 
the crucial role of taxes in modern societies. Taxation is an important topic for students of 
economics. Tax policies have important economic consequences, both for a national economy 
and for particular groups within the economy. Tax policies are often designed with the 
intention of stimulating economic growth—although economists differ signiﬁcantly about 
which policies are most effective at fostering growth. Taxes can create incentives promoting 
desirable behavior and disincentives for unwanted behavior. Taxation provides a means to 
redistribute economic resources toward those with low income or special needs. Taxes provide 
the revenue needed for important public services such as social security, health care, national 
defense, and education.
Taxation is as much a political issue as an economic issue. Political leaders have used tax 
policy to promote their agendas by initiating various tax reforms: decreasing (or increasing) 
tax rates, changing the deﬁnition of taxable income, creating new taxes on speciﬁc products, 
and so forth. Of course, no one particularly wants to pay taxes. Speciﬁc groups, such as small 
business owners, farmers, or retired individuals, exert signiﬁcant political effort to reduce 
their share of the tax burden. Tax codes are packed with rules that beneﬁt a certain group of 
taxpayers while inevitably shifting more of the burden to others.
In this chapter, we take a look at taxes and tax policy. First, we consider taxes from 
a theoretical perspective based on the economic models already discussed. Second, we 
summarize the different types of taxes, with an emphasis on the United States. Third, we 
present an international comparison of tax policies. Finally, we address current tax debates, 
including the distribution of the tax burden.
1. ECONOMIC THEORY AND TAXES
1.1 TAXES IN THE SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND MODEL
The supply-and-demand model we presented in Chapter 4 can be used to gain insights into 
the effects of taxation on consumers and producers. To incorporate taxes into our model, we 
consider a per-unit tax on a product or service, referred to as an excise tax. Let’s suppose 
excise tax: a per-
unit tax on a good or 
service

 
ECONOMIC THEORY AND TAXES 
273
that an excise tax is imposed on cups of coffee—$0.30 per cup. In this section, we use our 
model to answer the following two questions:
1. How will the tax affect the price of cups of coffee?
2. How will the tax affect the quantity of coffee sold?
Common sense provides part of the answer to these questions. It seems reasonable to expect 
that taxing a product will increase its price. It also seems reasonable that the tax will reduce the 
quantity of coffee sold, given that the quantity demanded will decrease if the price rises.
But our model helps us to answer questions that we might not be able to answer with 
common sense alone. In particular, how much will the price of coffee increase as a result of 
the tax? You might think that a tax of $0.30 per cup should increase the equilibrium price 
by $0.30 per cup. In other words, the tax would be “passed on” to the consumer. Our model 
determines whether this logic is correct.
To determine how to incorporate an excise tax into our supply-and-demand model, we 
can recall our discussion of marginal costs and marginal beneﬁts from Chapter 6. We stated 
then that a supply curve is a marginal cost curve and a demand curve is a marginal beneﬁt 
curve. A tax is essentially an additional cost. We assume for simplicity that the $0.30 excise 
tax is paid by coffee suppliers directly to the government. So, in addition to the production 
cost of actually making a cup of coffee, the coffee supplier must pay the government $0.30 
per cup. Effectively, the tax increases the marginal cost of supplying coffee.
We express an increase in the marginal cost of supplying coffee due to a tax just as we 
express an increase in input prices—the supply curve shifts upward.* The upward shift would 
be exactly equal to the amount of the tax. In other words, the marginal supply cost of each 
cup of coffee increases by $0.30 as a result of the tax.
This is shown in Figure 12.1, which presents our market for cups of coffee. The supply 
curve without any tax is Supply0, with equilibrium at E0—a price of $1.10 per cup and a 
quantity sold of 700 cups per week. Instituting the excise tax raises the supply curve upward 
by $0.30 per cup to SupplyTax. Note that SupplyTax is parallel to Supply0 because the cost of 
supplying each cup of coffee has increased by the same amount of $0.30.
Suppliers will seek to recoup the cost of the tax by raising their prices. You might think 
that they will increase their price by $0.30, to $1.40. But notice that at a price of $1.40 (the 
dashed blue line in Figure 12.1) the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded—a 
situation of surplus. As we discussed in Chapter 4, this creates a downward pressure on 
prices.
The new equilibrium with the tax occurs at ETax, at a price of $1.33 per cup and a quantity 
sold of 625 cups per week. As we expected, the price has risen and the quantity sold has 
decreased. However, the price has not risen by the amount of the tax. The $0.30 per cup tax 
led to a $0.23 increase in the price. Most of the cost has been passed on to consumers, but 
the suppliers also bear some burden of the tax.
How much of the tax burden is borne by consumers and producers depends on the elasticity 
of demand. In Figure 12.2 we see the impact of a tax when demand is highly inelastic, such 
as the demand for gasoline or cigarettes. Before the tax, the supply curve is Supply0, and the 
equilibrium price is P0 and quantity is Q0. The tax shifts the supply curve upward to SupplyTax, 
and the equilibrium price rises to PTax and quantity falls to QTax. The vertical distance between 
PTax and P1 is the amount of the tax—the distance between the two supply curves. In this case, 
we see that the price has risen by nearly as much of the tax. Thus when demand is inelastic, 
most of the tax is passed on to consumers. An inelastic demand curve implies that consumers’ 
quantity demanded will change little when prices rise.
*We could also visualize the supply curve shifting “back” instead of “up.” But in the case of a tax, it is easier to think of 
the curve shifting upward—an increase in the marginal cost of supply.

274 
CHAPTER 12 — TAXES AND TAX POLICY
At the extreme, if demand is perfectly inelastic, the demand curve is a vertical line and 
the quantity demanded does not change when prices rise. With a perfectly inelastic demand 
curve, the price rises by the exact amount of the tax and the full burden of the tax is borne 
by consumers.
However, if demand is highly elastic most of the burden of the tax is borne by producers. 
This is shown in Figure 12.3. Again, the supply curve before a tax is Supply0, with an 
equilibrium price of P0 and quantity of Q0. The supply curve with the tax is SupplyTax. We see 
that as producers raise their prices, the quantity demanded falls signiﬁcantly, from Q0 to QTax. 
Recall that an elastic demand curve means that consumers have many alternatives or consider 
the good nonessential. Producers are able to raise prices only slightly, to PTax, which is much 
less than the per-unit tax, which is again the vertical distance between PTax and P1.
The elasticity of supply also affects the distribution of the tax burden. It is a little more 
difﬁcult to see why this is so, but in general if supply is very elastic, more of the tax burden 
is passed on to consumers. This might be true, for example, in a very competitive industry in 
which it is not possible for producers to accept a lower price without going out of business. If 
supply is very inelastic, by contrast, suppliers can accept a price reduction without affecting 
the quantity supplied by much. (Try varying the elasticity of supply in a graph like Figure 
12.3 to see this effect.)

by raising price.

1.2 TAX REVENUES
We now consider using our supply-and-demand model to explore how much revenue is gen-
erated from a tax. The tax revenue from a per-unit tax is simply:
Tax revenue = Per-unit tax * Quantity
So if the tax on cups of coffee is $0.30 per cup and 625 cups of coffee are sold per week, 
then the tax revenue collected by the government each week is:
Tax revenue = $0.30 * 625 = $187.50
We can represent this tax revenue in Figure 12.4, which again shows our market for coffee with 
a tax of $0.30 per cup. The vertical distance between the two supply curves is $0.30, as shown in 
the graph. So the shaded rectangle, with a height of $0.30 and a length of 625 cups, represents our 
tax revenue of $187.50 per week. Being able to represent tax revenues on our supply-and-demand 
graph is important as in the next section we analyze the welfare effects of a tax.

When demand is highly elastic,

CHAPTER 12 — TAXES AND TAX POLICY
But ﬁrst consider a government’s decision about which goods and services to tax. Products 
are taxed for two basic reasons:
1. to discourage purchases of that product
2. to generate revenue
Any tax creates a disincentive, so consumers will reduce their purchases and seek 
alternatives. Comparing Figures 12.2 and 12.3 we see that the disincentive effect of a tax is 
greatest when the demand curve is highly elastic. However, the products that society generally 
wants to discourage people from buying, such as cigarettes and alcohol, tend to have inelastic 
demand curves. As shown in Figure 12.2, a tax on a good with inelastic demand will only 
reduce the quantity sold a little bit. So, in order for a tax to signiﬁcantly reduce the quantity 
sold when demand is inelastic, the tax must be substantial.
The elasticity of demand also has implications for tax revenues. If the demand curve is 
elastic, an excise tax signiﬁcantly reduces the quantity demanded (see Figure 12.3), and the 
government does not collect that much tax revenue. But if the demand curve is inelastic, 
the tax does not reduce the quantity demanded much (see Figure 12.2), and the government 
collects signiﬁcant revenues.
It is no surprise that excise taxes tend to be imposed on products with inelastic demand 
curves, such as gasoline, cigarettes, and alcohol. This suggests that the primary motivation 
for taxes on these products is revenue generation rather than encouraging behavioral changes. 
But recall that demand for these products tends to be more elastic in the long run. So we 
would expect tax revenues to decline gradually over time, ceteris paribus, as people have 
more time to adjust their behavior.
We can summarize the impact of an excise tax on products with elastic and inelastic 
demand curves in Table 12.1.*
*As noted, the elasticity of supply also affects distribution of the tax burden, but in general this effect is less important, so 
we concentrate here on demand elasticity.

1.3 WELFARE ANALYSIS OF TAXATION
We can now apply welfare analysis, as presented in Chapter 6, to the issue of taxation. We 
consider what happens to consumer and producer surplus when an excise tax is applied to 
a product. Again, we can rely on common sense to predict what the welfare effects will 
be. Consumers generally do not like taxes on the products that they purchase, so we might 
expect that consumer surplus will decline when a product is taxed. Producers also do not 
favor taxes on the products that they sell, so it seems reasonable to expect producer surplus 
to decline.
Recall from Chapter 6 we mentioned that welfare analysis should also consider the 
impacts of a market on “the rest of society,” meaning those not directly involved in a market 
transaction. Taxes represent revenue to a government entity, but these revenues can be used 
for any beneﬁcial social use—building schools or roads, providing health care, protecting 

 
ECONOMIC THEORY AND TAXES 
277
the environment, scientiﬁc research, or any other use. Although the ultimate beneﬁt of tax 
revenues depends on their particular use, in this chapter our analysis only goes as far as the 
tax collection. In other words, if a government collects $5 million in taxes, that revenue 
represents a potential $5 million beneﬁt to society. If the government uses these tax dollars 
wisely, say, investing in education or infrastructure, $5 million may generate more than $5 
million in long-run beneﬁts. Of course, if the government squanders its tax revenues, less 
than $5 million in social beneﬁts may result.
Figure 12.5 shows the welfare effects of an excise tax on a product. Before the tax, we 
again have the supply curve Supply0, with an equilibrium price of P0 and quantity of Q0. The 
welfare of the market without a tax is:
Consumer Surplus = A + B + E + H
Producer Surplus = C + D + F + G + I
There is no tax revenue, so total social welfare is simply the sum of consumer and 
producer surplus.
Instituting a tax shifts the supply curve to SupplyTax, with a new equilibrium at ETax. With 
price rising to PTax, consumer surplus is only area A. Thus we can conclude that consumer 
surplus has decreased, as we expected.
Figuring out the producer surplus is a little tricky. First, realize that producers receive total 
revenues of price times quantity, or (PTax * QTax). In Figure 12.5, total revenues are:
Total Producer Revenues = B + C + D + E + F + G + J
Producers have two costs: the cost of production and the tax. The cost of production is the 
area under their marginal cost curve, Supply0, which is area J. The tax is:
Tax Revenues = B + C + E + F
When we subtract production costs and the tax paid from total revenues, we are left with 
producer surplus:
Producer Surplus = (B + C + D + E + F + G + J) − J − (B + C + E + F)
 = D + G

An excise tax in a market results in 
a deadweight loss equal to areas H 
and I.

278 
CHAPTER 12 — TAXES AND TAX POLICY
Note that producer surplus has also decreased. Total social welfare with the tax is the sum 
of consumer and producer surplus, plus the tax revenues:
Social Welfare = A + (D + G) + (B + C + E + F)
How does this compare to social welfare before the tax? Before the tax, social welfare 
also included area (H + I). So even accounting for the beneﬁts of the tax revenues, the tax has 
resulted in a deadweight loss, similar to the price controls that we discussed in Chapter 6. We 
can conclude that imposing a tax on a product:
s  reduces consumer surplus
s  reduces producer surplus
s  provides social beneﬁts in the form of tax revenues
s  creates a deadweight loss
Based on this analysis, it may seem that taxing is always a bad idea. But as usual, we need 
to consider a broader context in order to determine whether a particular tax is justiﬁed. The 
potentially valid reasons for taxing include:
1. Governments obviously cannot rely on voluntary donations, thus something must be taxed 
in any society.
2. As mentioned earlier, a tax may be justiﬁed on the basis that it creates a disincentive for 
something. As we saw in Chapter 8, consumer behavior is not always rational and a tax 
can be used to encourage people to make better decisions.
3. The tax revenues may be spent wisely such that the net increase in social beneﬁts exceeds 
the deadweight loss.
4. A tax may be justiﬁed on the basis of equity, in order to reduce inequality. This is gener-
ally not true of excise taxes, but may apply to other taxes, such as the income tax, which 
falls more heavily on higher-income individuals and families.
An excise tax is just one type of tax. In most countries, the majority of tax revenues come 
from other taxes, such as taxes on income or property. We now turn to a summary of the tax 
system of the United States. Later, we compare the U.S. tax system to that of other countries.
Discussion Questions
1. What recent news stories have you heard about taxes? How does the material in the previ-
ous section relate to these stories?
2. What goods and services do you think should be subjected to excise taxes? How would 
these taxes affect different groups of people?
2. THE STRUCTURE OF TAXATION IN THE UNITED STATES
2.1 TAX PROGRESSIVITY
Before we discuss the different types of taxes in the United States, we need to ﬁrst deﬁne the 
concept of tax progressivity. By a progressive tax, we mean that the percentage of income 
an individual (or household) pays in taxes tends to increase with increasing income. Not only 
do those with higher incomes pay more in total taxes, but they pay a higher rate of taxes. 
For example, a person making $100,000 a year might pay 25 percent of his or her income in 
taxes ($25,000 in taxes), while someone with an income of $30,000 might pay a tax rate of 
only 10 percent ($3,000 in taxes). So the higher-income person pays a higher tax rate, and 
thus this tax is progressive.
progressive tax: 
a tax in which the 
percentage of one’s 
income that is paid 
in taxes tends to in-
crease with increasing 
income levels

 
THE STRUCTURE OF TAXATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
279
A tax can also be regressive or proportional. A regressive tax is one in which the proportion 
of income paid in taxes tends to decrease as one’s income increases. A proportional tax 
means that everyone pays the same tax rate regardless of income. Most countries’ overall 
tax system, including that of the United States, includes a mix of progressive and regressive 
taxes, as different taxes are designed with different purposes.
The overall tax system of the United States and most other countries is progressive. A 
progressive tax system is used for many reasons, including:
1. A progressive tax embodies the concept that those with high incomes should pay more of 
their income in taxes because of their greater ability to pay without a harmful sacriﬁce. 
By paying a tax, any household must forgo an equivalent amount of spending on goods, 
services, or investments. For a high-income household, these forgone opportunities might 
include a second home, an expensive vehicle, or a purchase of corporate stock. A low-
income household, by comparison, might have to forgo basic medical care, postsecondary 
education, or vehicle safety repairs.
2. A progressive tax system can be used to address economic inequality in a society. If the 
beneﬁts of programs funded by taxation primarily beneﬁt low-income households while 
high-income households pay the majority of taxes, then a tax system effectively operates 
as a means to reduce inequality.
3. There is also an economic argument for a progressive tax system—it can yield a given 
level of public revenue with the least macroeconomic impact. To see why, consider how 
households with different levels of income respond to a $1,000 tax cut. A low-income 
household tends to spend the entire amount quickly on needed goods and services—
injecting $1,000 of increased demand into the economy. By comparison, a high-income 
household might only spend a fraction of the tax cut on goods and services, choosing to 
save or invest a portion of the money. The money that a high-income household saves 
or invests does not add to the overall level of effective demand in an economy.* In eco-
nomic terms, we say that the marginal propensity to consume (the tendency to spend, 
rather than save, an additional dollar of income) tends to decrease as income increases. 
Collecting proportionately more taxes from high-income households thus has less effect 
on total effective demand in the economy.
Despite these arguments for a progressive tax, it is possible for a tax system to become 
too progressive. Extremely high tax rates on income create a disincentive for individuals 
to expend economically productive effort. Very high taxes might limit the risks taken by 
entrepreneurs, stiﬂing innovation and technological advance. The desire to “soak the rich” 
through an extremely progressive tax system might be viewed as unfair and economically 
unwise and can promote “tax ﬂight,” in which wealthy individuals relocate in order to avoid 
high tax rates. We consider these issues in more detail later in the chapter. But next we turn 
to a discussion of the U.S. tax system.
2.2 FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The federal income tax is the most visible, complicated, and debated tax in the United States. 
The federal income tax was established with the ratiﬁcation of the Sixteenth Amendment to 
the U.S. Constitution in 1913. It is levied on wages and salaries as well as income from many 
other sources, including interest, dividends, capital gains, self-employment income, alimony, 
and prizes. To understand the basic workings of federal income taxes, fortunately you need 
to comprehend only two major issues:
regressive tax: a tax 
in which the percent-
age of one’s income 
paid in taxes tends to 
decrease with increas-
ing income levels
proportional tax: a 
tax in which all tax-
payers pay the same 
tax rate, regardless of 
income
*Money saved or invested can, however, provide the ﬁnancial capital necessary to increase the productive capacity of the 
economy. “Supply-side” economics stresses the importance of investment by the wealthy as critical to macroeconomic growth.
marginal propen-
sity to consume: 
the number of ad-
ditional dollars of 
consumption for 
every additional dollar 
of income (typically a 
fraction between zero 
and one)

CHAPTER 12 — TAXES AND TAX POLICY
1. Not all income is not taxable—there are important differences between “total income” 
and “taxable income.”
2. There is also an important difference between the “effective tax rate” and the “marginal 
tax rate.”
Total income is simply the sum of income that an individual or couple receives from all 
sources.* For most people, the largest portion of total income comes from wages or salaries. 
Many people also receive investment income from interest, capital gains, and dividends. 
Self-employment income is also included in total income, along with other types of income 
such as alimony, farm income, and winnings from gambling.
The amount of federal taxes that a person owes is not calculated based on total income. 
Instead, after total income is calculated, tax ﬁlers are allowed to subtract some expenses as 
nontaxable. Each ﬁler receives an exemption as well as various deductions. For example, 
in 2013 a single ﬁler with no children was allowed to deduct the ﬁrst $10,000 of income as 
nontaxable.** Other expenses that can be deducted include individual retirement account 
(IRA) contributions, allowable moving expenses (e.g., for a job), student loan interest, and 
certain tuition expenses.
Taxable income is the income that is subject to taxation, after all deductions and 
exemptions. However, the amount of tax owed is not simply a multiple of taxable income and 
a single tax rate. The federal income tax system in the United States uses increasing marginal 
tax rates (the tax rate applicable to an additional dollar of income). This means that different 
tax rates apply to different portions of a person’s income. The marginal tax rates in effect for 
2013 are listed in Table 12.2. For a single ﬁler, the ﬁrst $8,925 of taxable income is taxed at 
a rate of 10 percent. Taxable income above $8,925 but less than $36,250 is taxed at a rate of 
15 percent, and so on up to a maximum marginal tax rate of 39.6 percent. The income levels 
that are taxed at each rate are higher for married ﬁlers, ﬁling jointly.
The way that one’s income tax bill is determined is best illustrated with an example. Suppose 
that we want to calculate the taxes owed by a single person (let’s call her Susan) with no children 
and a total income of $49,000. As mentioned above, in 2013 she would be allowed to claim the 
ﬁrst $10,000 of income as nontaxable. Assume that Susan contributed $2,000 to an IRA, so this 
contribution can also be deducted from her total income. Thus her taxable income would be 
$37,000, as shown in Table 12.3. On the ﬁrst $8,925 of taxable income, she owes 10 percent 
in taxes, or $892.50. The tax rate on her taxable income above $8,925 but below $36,250 is 
15 percent, for a tax of (($36,250 − $8,925)  0.15), or $4,098.75. Finally, her tax rate is 25 
percent for her taxable income above $36,250, for a tax of (($37,000 − $36,250)  0.25), or 
$187.50. So, we see in Table 12.3 that her total federal income tax bill is $5,178.75.
 *Married couples have the option of ﬁling their federal taxes either jointly or separately.
**Couples, and those with children, can deduct higher amounts of income as nontaxable. Filers have the option of 
“itemizing” their deductions rather than taking the “standard” deduction, depending on which deduction is larger. Deductions 
that can be itemized include mortgage interest, state and local taxes, major health-care expenses, real estate taxes, and gifts to 
charity.

THE STRUCTURE OF TAXATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
281
Note that Susan paid a maximum marginal tax rate of 25 percent but only on her last $750 
of income. Someone’s effective tax rate is their total taxes divided by total income, expressed 
as a percentage. Thus Susan’s effective tax rate is:
$5,178.75 = 0.1057  100 = 10.57 percent
$49,000
As we see later in the chapter, which tax rate is most relevant—marginal or effective—
depends on the policy situation. But the distinction can help us dispel one common myth 
about federal income taxes. Many people mistakenly worry that if they move into a higher 
tax bracket, their remaining income after taxes will decline. But if one moves, for example, 
from the 15 percent tax bracket to the 25 percent tax bracket, it is only the additional income 
that is taxed at 25 percent, not total income. Thus if Susan had recently received a raise of 
$750 that increased her total income to $49,000, she paid $187.50 in taxes on her additional 
income, but all her other income was taxed at the same rates as before her raise. The only 
way one’s total after-tax income could decline with an increase in income would be if the 
marginal tax rate exceeded 100 percent.*
2.3 FEDERAL SOCIAL INSURANCE TAXES
Taxes for federal social insurance programs, including Social Security, Medicaid, and Medi-
care, are collected in addition to federal income taxes. Social insurance taxes are levied on 
salaries and wages, as well as income from self-employment. For those employed by others, 
these taxes are generally withheld directly from their pay—that is, deducted from their pay 
before they receive it. These deductions commonly appear as FICA taxes—a reference to the 
Federal Insurance Contributions Act.
Federal social insurance taxes are actually two separate taxes. The ﬁrst is a tax of 12.4 
percent of pay, which is used primarily to fund Social Security. Half this tax is deducted from 
an employee’s pay, and the employer is responsible for matching this contribution. The other 
is a tax of 2.9 percent for Medicare and Medicaid, for which the employee and employer again 
each pay half. Thus social insurance taxes normally amount to a 7.65 percent deduction from 
an employee’s pay (6.2 percent + 1.45 percent). Self-employed individuals are responsible 
for paying the entire share, 15.3 percent, themselves.
These two taxes have a very important difference. The Social Security tax is due only on 
the ﬁrst $113,700 of income, as of 2013. On income above $113,700, no additional Social

*Some low-income workers in the United States are subjected to marginal income tax rates that approach and even exceed 
100 percent. Low-income workers are eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which provides a tax rebate as an 
incentive to work, but the EITC is phased out as income increases. At some income levels, increases in income can be fully 
offset by a reduction in the EITC rebate.

CHAPTER 12 — TAXES AND TAX POLICY
Security tax is paid. In other words, the maximum Social Security tax that could be deducted 
from total pay in 2013 was $7,049.40 ($113,700  0.062). The Medicare tax, however, is 
paid on all wages and salaries. Thus, the Medicare tax is truly a proportional tax while the 
Social Security tax is a proportional tax on the ﬁrst $113,700 of income but then becomes a 
regressive tax when we consider income above this limit.
Consider the impact of social insurance taxes on two individuals, Susan with her $49,000 
annual salary and Leah, who makes $300,000. Susan would pay a social insurance tax of 
7.65 percent on all her income, or $3,748.50. Leah would pay the maximum Social Security 
contribution of $7,049.40 plus $4,350 for Medicare/Medicaid (1.45 percent of $300,000) for a 
total social insurance tax bill of $11,399.40. This works out to an effective tax rate of 3.8 percent, 
or less than half the tax rate paid by Susan. Thus we see that overall social insurance taxes are 
regressive, with higher-income individuals paying a signiﬁcantly lower effective rate.
2.4 FEDERAL CORPORATE TAXES
Corporations must ﬁle federal tax forms that are in many ways similar to the forms that 
individuals complete. Corporate taxable income is deﬁned as total revenue minus the cost 
of goods sold, wages and salaries, depreciation, repairs, interest paid, and other deductions. 
Thus corporations, like individuals, can take advantage of many deductions to reduce their 
taxable income. In fact, a corporation may have so many deductions that it actually ends up 
paying no tax at all or even receives a rebate check from the federal government.
Corporate tax rates, like personal income tax rates, are progressive and calculated on a 
marginal basis. In 2013, the lowest corporate tax rate, applied to proﬁts of less than $50,000, 
was 15 percent. The highest marginal corporate tax rate, applied to proﬁts of between $100,000 
and $335,000, was 39 percent.* As for individuals, the effective tax rate that corporations pay 
is lower than their marginal tax rate. For more on federal corporate taxes, see Box 12.1.
2.5 OTHER FEDERAL TAXES
The U.S. federal government collects excise taxes on numerous commodities and services, 
including tires, telephone services, air travel, transportation fuels, alcohol, tobacco, and ﬁre-
arms. Consumers may be unaware that they are paying federal excise taxes, as the tax amounts 
are normally incorporated into the prices of products. For example, the federal excise tax on 
gasoline is about 18 cents per gallon.
The ﬁnal federal taxes that we consider are federal estate and gift taxes. The estate tax is 
applied to transfers of large estates to beneﬁciaries. Like the federal income tax, the estate 
tax has an exemption amount that is not taxed—in 2013 it was $5.25 million. Only estates 
valued above the exemption amount are subject to the estate tax, and the tax applies only to 
the value of the estate above the exemption. The maximum marginal tax rate on estates in 
2013 was 40 percent.
The transfer of large gifts is also subject to federal taxation. The estate tax and gift tax 
(taxes on the transfer of large gifts to beneﬁciaries) are complementary because the gift tax 
essentially prevents people from giving away their estate to beneﬁciaries tax-free while 
they are still alive. In 2013, gifts under $11,000 per year per recipient were excluded from 
taxation. Like federal income tax rates, the gift tax rates are marginal and progressive, with 
a maximum tax rate of 40 percent.
The estate and gift taxes are the most progressive element of federal taxation. The estate 
tax is paid exclusively by those with considerable assets. Moreover, the majority of estate 
taxes are paid by a very small number of wealthy taxpayers. According to the Tax Policy 
Center, in 2011 the richest 0.1 percent of those subject to the estate tax paid 51 percent of 
the total estate tax revenue.1
*For the highest proﬁt bracket—proﬁts above $18,333,333—the marginal rate was 35 percent.

THE STRUCTURE OF TAXATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
283
2.6 STATE AND LOCAL TAXES
Like the federal government, state and local governments rely on several different tax mecha-
nisms, including income taxes, excise taxes, and corporate taxes. Thus much of the above 
discussion applies to the tax structures in place in most states. However, some important 
differences deserve mention.
First, nearly all states (45 as of 2013) have instituted some type of general sales tax. State 
sales tax rates range from 2.9 percent (Colorado) to 7.25 percent (California). A few states reduce 
the tax rate on certain goods considered necessities, such as food and prescription drugs. For 
example, the general sales tax in Illinois is 6.25 percent, but most food and drug sales are taxed 
at only 1 percent. Many states with sales taxes exempt some necessities from taxation entirely. 
In most states, municipal localities can charge an additional sales tax. Although local sales taxes 
are generally lower than state sales taxes, there are exceptions. In New York the state sales tax 
is 4 percent, but local sales taxes are often higher than 4 percent. The combined state and local 
sales tax can be higher than 11 percent in Arizona, Arkansas, and Illinois.
Unlike income taxes, sales taxes tend to be quite regressive. The reason is that low-income 
households tend to spend a larger share of their income on taxable items than do high-income 
households. Consider gasoline—a product that tends to comprise a smaller share of total 
BOX 12.1  CORPORATE TAXES: THE USE AND MISUSE OF INFORMATION
You may have heard politicians and media com-
mentators mention that the United States has the 
highest corporate taxes in the world, normally when 
arguing in favor of lower tax rates. For example, a 
2012 article noted:
Our high corporate tax rate has long made the 
United States an uncompetitive place for new 
investment. . . . The U.S. rate [of 39 percent] is 
well above the 25 percent average of other de-
veloped nations in the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD). In fact, 
the U.S. rate is almost 15 percentage points higher 
than the OECD average. (Dubay 2012)
Looking only at top marginal rates, it is true that the 
United States does have the highest corporate tax rate 
among OECD member countries. But as we discussed 
in Chapter 1, this is an example of a positive statement 
with normative policy implications that needs to be 
scrutinized in order to get a more complete picture. In 
particular, the article mentions nothing about effective 
tax rates, which as we saw with federal income taxes, 
can differ signiﬁcantly from marginal tax rates.
A different 2012 article presents a more balanced 
approach, indicating that the top marginal rate
only tells part of the story. Loopholes and other 
special treatment for different kinds of businesses 
mean that businesses pay an effective rate of only 
29.2 percent of their income, which puts the United 
States below the average of 31.9 percent among 
other major economies, according to analysis by 
the Treasury Department. (Isidore 2012)
Providing yet another way of viewing corporate 
taxes in an international perspective, the same article 
mentions that
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development, the multinational group that tracks 
global economic growth, estimates the United 
States collects less corporate tax relative to the 
overall economy than almost any other country in 
the world. Some economists argue that tax collec-
tion relative to gross domestic product is the more 
relevant measure. That’s because different account-
ing rules around the world mean what’s counted 
as income in one country isn’t counted in another, 
making comparisons of tax rates misleading.
So depending on one’s perspective, the United 
States either has the highest corporate taxes in the 
world or one of the lowest! Marginal tax rates are 
relevant when making decisions about additional 
income. But effective tax rates are generally more 
relevant when a company decides where to locate in 
the ﬁrst place. As with many economic policy applica-
tions, what information we focus on depends on the 
details of the situation.

CHAPTER 12 — TAXES AND TAX POLICY
expenditures as income rises. An increase in state taxes on gasoline affects low-income 
households more than high-income households, measured as a percentage of income. Some 
states, such as Idaho and Kansas, offer low-income households a tax credit to compensate 
for the regressive nature of state sales taxes.
Forty-one states levy an income tax.* Most of these states have several progressive tax 
brackets (as many as 12 rates), like the federal income tax. However, state income taxes tend 
to be less progressive than the federal income tax. Six states have only one income tax rate, 
meaning that their income tax approaches a proportional tax. Several additional states approach a 
proportional tax because the top rate applies at a low income or the rates are relatively constant. 
For example, North Carolina’s tax rates only range from 6.0 percent to 7.75 percent.
Another important distinction between the federal system of taxation and the taxes levied 
at state and local levels is the use of property taxes. Property taxes tend to be the largest 
revenue source for state and local governments. The primary property tax levied in the United 
States is a tax on real estate, including land, private residences, and commercial properties. 
Generally, the tax is calculated as a proportion of the value of the property, although the 
formulas used by localities differ signiﬁcantly.
Property taxes tend to be regressive, although less regressive than excise and sales taxes. 
The reason is that high-income households tend to have a lower proportion of their assets 
subjected to property taxes. Although renters do not pay property taxes directly, economic 
analysis indicates that the costs of property taxes are largely passed on to renters as part of 
their rent, as we discuss later in the chapter.
Discussion Questions
1. Do you think it is necessary for the United States to have so many different types of taxes? 
What would you change about the structure of taxation in the United States?
2. Compare the tax policies of the area in which you live to a neighboring state or country? 
What factors do you think explain the differences in tax policies?
3. TAX ANALYSIS AND POLICY ISSUES
3.1 TAX DATA FOR THE UNITED STATES
One of the main debates about tax policy in the United States, which we discuss later in this 
section, concerns the overall level of taxation. Although tax receipts have grown dramati-
cally in recent decades, to provide the proper context, economists normally measure taxes as 
a percentage of GDP. Figure 12.6 presents data on overall U.S. tax receipts, as a percentage 
of GDP, from 1950 to 2012.
We see that the overall level of taxation tended to rise from 1950 to 2000, from about 23 
percent to 34 percent. Although critics of “big government” often focus on the growth of the 
federal government, most of the growth in total tax receipts was due to an increase in state and 
local taxation from 1950 to the early 1970s. Federal tax revenues have remained at about the 
same level over most of this period and have declined as a percentage of GDP since 2000.
Note that the ﬂuctuations in total tax receipts closely follow the ﬂuctuations in federal tax 
receipts. The reason for this is that state and local tax revenues remain relatively constant 
whether the economy is expanding or in a recession. State and local governments rely heavily 
on property and sales taxes, which ﬂuctuate relatively less than income and corporate taxes 
as economic activity varies.
We see in Figure 12.6 that federal tax receipts did increase during the 1990s. Although 
federal income tax rates increased slightly in the early 1990s, the primary reason that federal 
tax receipts grew was an economic expansion that raised incomes. As incomes rise, people 
*Two additional states, Tennessee and New Hampshire, levy no state income tax but do tax dividends and interest.

 
TAX ANALYSIS AND POLICY ISSUES 
285
tend to move into higher marginal tax brackets, and thus their effective tax rate increases. In 
addition, corporate proﬁts rose during this period. Another reason that federal tax receipts rose 
was an increase in capital gains taxes, which are paid on the proﬁtable sale of investments 
such as stocks and mutual funds.
When the economy fell into a recession in 2001, federal tax receipts declined along with 
falling income and proﬁts. In addition, signiﬁcant tax cuts were implemented under the George 
W. Bush administration. As the economy recovered in the mid-2000s, federal tax receipts 
began to rise. But with the Great Recession (2007–9), federal tax receipts declined further 
and then began to rise starting in 2010.
As we discuss later, some of the variations in tax receipts are related to tax policy changes. 
But we can draw three important lessons from Figure 12.6—lessons that are not necessarily 
consistent with discussions of tax issues in the media:
1. The primary reason that tax receipts have ﬂuctuated in the past couple of decades is due 
not to major changes in tax policy but to macroeconomic ﬂuctuations.
2. Federal tax receipts are relatively low by historical standards. In fact, in 2009 federal tax 
receipts reached their lowest level, as a percentage of GDP, since before 1950.
3. Total tax receipts, as of 2012, are also relatively low, considering the period since 1970. 
Total tax receipts as a percentage of GDP were at the same level in 2012 as in the early 
1970s and early 1980s.
3.2 INTERNATIONAL DATA ON TAXES
In addition to looking at historical data, we can also gain some context for tax policy discussions 
by comparing the United States to other countries. Figure 12.7 shows the overall rate of taxation 
in various member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD).* We see that the overall rate of taxation in the United States is relatively low—with 
a rate similar to that in Turkey but lower than that in all other industrialized countries.

The United States has a 
relatively low overall rate of 
taxation compared to other 
industrialized countries.
In addition to the overall level of taxation, another difference in tax policy across countries 
is the relative reliance upon different types of taxes. For example, the United States tends to 
rely on individual income taxes more than most countries do. Income taxes comprised 33 
percent of all tax revenue in the United States in 2010, compared to an OECD average of 24 
percent. Several other types of taxes are relied on more in other countries than in the United 
States. For more on these other types of taxes, see Box 12.2.
3.3 CURRENT TAX POLICY ISSUES
Taxation and Economic Growth
Although this book is concerned primarily with microeconomics, any discussion of tax 
policy should consider the debate over the relationship between taxation and macroeconomic 
growth. In addition to raising revenues, taxes generally create a disincentive to engage in 
certain activities. For example, high taxes on investment are expected to reduce overall 
investment.
One theory is that a high overall rate of taxation creates a disincentive for people to work 
hard and invest, because they will keep less of their money after taxes. This theory implies 
that rates of macroeconomic growth will be higher when tax rates are low. Many proponents 
of this theory focus in particular on the marginal tax rates of high-income earners. According 
to supply-side economics, low marginal tax rates encourage entrepreneurs and investors to 
increase their economic efforts, leading to more employment and, ultimately, beneﬁts that 
“trickle down” to workers and the broader economy.
Does the evidence support the view that taxes represent a drag on economic growth? We 
can analyze the relationship between economic growth and taxes by comparing data across 
countries and by looking at data over time within a single country. When we analyze a broad 
range of developing and developed countries, the evidence does not support the view that 
low taxes lead to high growth rates.
If you look at the relationship between the tax ratio and the level of prosperity, measured 
by GDP per capita, there is no supportive evidence for the claim that low taxes guarantee 
supply-side eco-
nomics: the macro-
economic theory that 
low marginal tax rates 
lead to higher rates 
of economic growth 
by encouraging en-
trepreneurship and 
investment

 
TAX ANALYSIS AND POLICY ISSUES 
287
prosperity. In fact, if you just plot out the points, you will ﬁnd a clear, positive correlation 
between high tax rates and prosperity, and that is because developed countries are the 
ones with the high tax ratios . . . that evidence [does not] necessarily mean that high 
taxes (and high government spending) cause prosperity, but it is a troubling fact that 
the people who say low taxes are the key to prosperity must confront.2
If we look instead at a smaller group of countries, some studies have found that low 
tax levels are associated with higher growth rates. For example, a 2010 study found 
that OECD member countries with higher tax levels as a percentage of GDP had lower 
rates of economic growth from 1991 to 2006, but that the net effect was “very small.”3 
Another study that looked at tax levels across different U.S. states found that property 
and sales taxes did have a negative effect on economic growth rates but that income 
taxes did not.4
Data over time within a single country do not offer support for supply-side economics. 
As shown in Figure 12.8, the top marginal federal income tax rate in the United States has 
varied considerably over time, from above 90 percent to as low as 28 percent. Figure 12.8 
also shows the average annual rate of economic growth in each decade since 1950. We see 
BOX 12.2 INTERNATIONAL TAX ALTERNATIVES
Several tax types are heavily used in other countries but 
are relatively insigniﬁcant in the United States. Some 
of these tax types are central to different tax policy 
reforms proposed in the United States. We summarize 
ﬁve tax types here:
UÊ  >Ì>ÊÃ>iÃÊÌ>Ý\ This would function similar to 
a state sales tax—as an addition to the retail price 
of certain products. A national sales tax would 
clearly be simpler and cheaper to administer than 
the current U.S. federal income tax. It would also 
encourage savings because, under most propos-
als, income that is not spent on taxable goods and 
services is not taxed. However, a national sales tax 
has two signiﬁcant disadvantages. First, it would 
create a strong incentive for the emergence of black 
market exchanges to evade the tax. Second, it can 
be highly regressive. A national sales tax could be 
made less regressive, or even progressive, by pro-
viding rebates for low-income households. Eligible 
households could complete a form at the end of 
the year to determine their rebate amount.
UÊ  >Ì>ÊVÃÕ«ÌÊÌ>Ý\ This is slightly different 
from a national sales tax. A household would pay 
the tax at the end of the year, or through estimated 
monthly payments, based on the value of its an-
nual consumption of goods and services. Rather 
than having a household keep track of everything 
purchased, consumption can be calculated as total 
income less money not spent on goods and services 
(i.e., invested or saved). Again, a consumption tax 
would promote savings by exempting it from taxa-
tion. A consumption tax could also be designed to 
be progressive by taxing different levels of consump-
tion at different marginal rates.
UÊ 6>Õi>``i`ÊÌ>Ý\ Most developed countries levy 
some form of value-added tax (VAT). A VAT is 
levied at each stage in the production process of a 
product, collected from manufacturers according 
to the value added at each stage. Thus the tax is 
not added to the retail price but incorporated into 
the price of the product, similar to the way excise 
taxes become embedded in the price of products.
UÊ 7i>ÌÊÌ>ÝiÃ\ Although the U.S. tax system includes 
local property taxes and estate taxes, it does not 
have a tax on holdings of other assets such as 
corporate stocks, bonds, and personal property. 
Several European countries, including Sweden, 
Spain, and Switzerland, have instituted an annual 
wealth tax. A wealth tax could be very progressive 
by applying only to very high wealth levels.
UÊ ÛÀiÌ>ÊÌ>ÝiÃ\ÊSuch a tax is levied on goods 
and services in proportion to their environmental 
impact. One example is a carbon tax, which taxes 
products based on the carbon emissions attributable 
to their production or consumption. The rationale of 
environmental taxation is that it encourages the use 
and development of goods and services with reduced 
environmental impacts. Like other taxes on goods and 
services, environmental taxes can be regressive—sug-
gesting that environmental taxes need to be combined 
with other progressive taxes or rebates for low-income 
households. Among developed countries, the United 
States collects the smallest share of tax revenues from 
environmental taxes, both as a share of GDP and as 
a share of total tax revenues.

The graph indicates that lowering the 
top marginal federal income tax rate 
does not seem to be correlated with 
higher economic growth.
that the periods with the highest average growth rates, the 1950s and 1960s, were associated 
with the highest marginal tax rates. When the top marginal rate fell signiﬁcantly in the 1980s, 
growth rates stayed about the same as they were in the 1970s. The top rate increased in the 
early 1990s, without a noticeable effect on average growth rates. It fell in the early 2000s, 
but that decade experienced the lowest overall growth rates. 
tax incidence  
analysis: the study 
of who bears the ulti-
mate burden of a tax
The Distribution of Taxes
An often-quoted fact is that nearly half of Americans do not pay any federal income tax. 
Some people conclude that this implies that nearly half of Americans are not paying any 
taxes and thus are a drain on government resources who are not paying their fair share. But 
this represents an incomplete picture of who pays taxes. Of course, we have learned that the 
federal income tax is just one of the many taxes paid by Americans. In order to analyze the 
distribution of the tax burden accurately, we need to consider all taxes, not just focus on one 
speciﬁc tax.
Another important point is that we need to understand the difference between who actually 
pays a tax and who feels the burden of the tax. Let’s take the Social Security tax as an example. 
On paper, both an employee and an employer pay half the tax. But are employers able to 
essentially pass on the burden of their share of the tax to employees by offering them lower 
wages? Another example is property taxes paid by landlords. Do landlords bear the burden 
of these taxes or are they able to pass them on to renters by charging higher rents than they 
would otherwise?
Economists rely upon tax incidence analysis to determine who bears the ultimate burden 
of a tax. Tax incidence analysis is:
the study of who bears the economic burden of a tax. More generally, it is the 
positive analysis of the impact of taxes on the distribution of welfare within a 
society. It begins with the very basic insight that the person who has the legal 
obligation to make a tax payment may not be the person whose welfare is reduced 
by the existence of the tax.5

 
TAX ANALYSIS AND POLICY ISSUES 
289
Tax incidence analysis has produced some generally accepted conclusions regarding the 
burden of different taxes.
s  Social insurance taxes, even though they are split evenly on paper, are borne almost entirely 
by employees. The reason is that an employer will pay a worker only the value of his or her 
marginal contribution to proﬁts (recall our discussion from Chapter 10). As an employer’s 
share of social insurance taxes reduces their proﬁts, employers will accordingly reduce the 
amount of pay offered to employees.
s  The burden of corporate taxes ultimately falls on real people. The general consensus is 
that the burden of corporate taxes falls primarily on owners of capital investments such as 
stocks and mutual funds.
s  Excise taxes, though paid by manufacturers and retailers, are actually mostly paid by con-
sumers based on their consumption patterns. In other words, businesses are generally able 
to pass on excise taxes to consumers. The reason is that most excises taxes are placed on 
goods with relatively inelastic demand curves.
s  Property taxes paid by landlords are passed on to renters.
Based on research using tax incidence analysis, we can gain a complete picture of how 
taxes are distributed within a society. Table 12.4 provides an estimate of the U.S. tax burden 
in 2013 at different income levels.
We see that the overall U.S. tax system is progressive—meaning that tax rates tend to 
increase with increases in income. But, far from paying nothing in taxes, even those in the 
lowest income group pay nearly 20 percent of their income in taxes (even if they do not pay 
federal income tax) when we consider all taxes. Those in the middle-income group pay about 
27 percent of their total income in taxes. After the middle-income group, average tax rates 
continue to rise, though rather modestly, especially for the top 20 percent.

It is true that high-income earners bear a large share of the tax burden, but this must be 
assessed relative to their income. For example, those in the top 1 percent pay 24 percent of 
all taxes, but they also receive about 22 percent of all income. Combined, the top 20 percent 
pay 65 percent of all taxes and receive about 60 percent of all income. These ﬁgures indicate 
that the overall tax system is slightly, but not heavily, progressive.
Whether the current progressivity of the overall tax system in the United States is appropriate 
is, of course, a normative issue. According to a 2012 survey, 58 percent of Americans think 
that the “rich” pay too little in taxes, 26 percent say that the rich pay their fair share, and only 
8 percent say that the rich pay too much.6 Changes in tax policies can be used to change the 
overall progressivity of the tax system. Most tax policy debates emphasize the federal income 
tax. But considering that nearly half of Americans do not pay federal income taxes, reducing 

290 
CHAPTER 12 — TAXES AND TAX POLICY
those rates would beneﬁt only the richer half. Similarly, raising federal income tax rates tends to 
affect higher-income taxpayers. Again, we should assess any change in tax policy by considering 
its impact on the overall progressivity of taxes, rather than focusing on a single tax.

13 The Economics of the Environment
A 2012 opinion poll asked Americans which should be given the higher priority: economic 
growth or protecting the environment.1 By 49 percent to 41 percent, more people thought that 
economic growth was the higher priority. This result is a reversal of similar polls conducted 
between 1985 and 2007, in which large majorities were more concerned about protecting the 
environment. The way that this survey was formulated reﬂects a common perspective that a 
tradeoff frequently exists between economic goals and environmental goals. For example, 
we often hear from politicians and media pundits that environmental regulations lead to job 
losses and hamper economic growth. But is this perspective factually accurate?
Environmental issues are certainly not separate from economics. Deteriorating 
environmental conditions can create serious health problems as well as reduce the quantity 
and quality of natural resources that contribute to productivity and other important aspects 
of quality of life. Climate change is an example of environmental deterioration that is also 
imposing costs on people in many countries. Although no individual weather event can be 
linked conclusively to global climate change, more “extreme weather events” are likely 
to result from a global buildup of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases that 
contribute to planetary warming.
Because improvements in environmental quality enhance most people’s well-being, 
economists would not be expected to oppose protecting the environment. In fact, 
economics has subdisciplines known as environmental economics, natural resource 
economics, and ecological economics. The Nobel prize–winning economist Paul Krugman 
has written that:
my unscientiﬁc impression is that economists are on average more pro-environment than 
other people of similar incomes and backgrounds. Why? Because standard economic 
theory automatically predisposes those who believe in it to favor strong environmental 
protection.2
In this chapter and Chapter 14, we summarize how to use insights from economics to better 
manage our shared environment. Among other things, we ﬁnd that environmental concerns 
often present a valid justiﬁcation for government intervention in markets. Recall from our 
study of welfare analysis in Chapter 6 that government intervention is often expected to 
decrease economic efﬁciency. In this chapter, we see important examples of where, even 
by the most standard deﬁnitions of efﬁciency, this is not always the case. When economic 
production and consumption cause negative environmental impacts, government intervention 
can actually increase economic efﬁciency.
We also discuss the environmental policy tools that economists have developed to 
address environmental problems, and the ways in which economists express the value of the

293
environment in monetary terms. By the end of the next chapter, we will have developed the 
rationale behind the following quotation:
If you want to ﬁght for the environment, don’t hug a tree, hug an economist. Hug the 
economist who tells you that fossil fuels are not only the third most heavily subsidized 
economic sector after road transportation and agriculture but that they also promote 
vast inefﬁciencies. Hug the economist who tells you that the most efﬁcient investment 
of a dollar is not in fossil fuels but in renewable energy sources that not only provide 
new jobs but cost less over time. Hug the economist who tells you that the price system 
matters; it’s potentially the most potent tool of all for creating social change.3
1. THE THEORY OF EXTERNALITIES
In Chapter 1 we introduced the concept of externalities. Recall that externalities are side ef-
fects, positive or negative, of an economic transaction that affect those not directly involved 
in the transaction. Pollution is the classic example of a negative externality. When a consumer 
buys a product, such as a t-shirt, he or she rarely considers the negative environmental impacts 
associated with its production. T-shirt producers generally do not consider these environmen-
tal impacts either. But these impacts clearly do occur, and society as a whole suffers some 
damages from them.
1.1 NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES IN THE SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND MODEL
We can analyze externalities using our standard supply-and-demand graph. As discussed 
in Chapter 6, a demand curve represents the marginal beneﬁts to consumers while a supply 
curve represents the marginal costs to producers. How can we incorporate the concept of 
externalities into this framework?
Remember that our welfare analysis in Chapter 6 excluded “the rest of society.” We 
considered only the welfare of consumers and producers in the market. But a complete 
welfare analysis of a market must consider the impacts to all of society, even those outside the 
particular market. The key point to understand if we are to incorporate negative externalities 
into our supply-and-demand graph is that negative externalities represent an additional cost 
of production, over and above actual production costs. The producers do not pay this cost, 
but the rest of society does. So if we want to determine the total cost of providing a good or 
service, we must add the externality costs to the regular production costs.
Therefore, we can incorporate it into our supply-and-demand model by adding it to 
the supply curve. We do this in Figure 13.1, which represents a market for t-shirts. The 
normal supply curve represents the private marginal costs of producing t-shirts—the actual 
manufacturing costs. But to obtain the marginal cost of providing t-shirts from the broader 
social perspective, we need to add the negative externality costs. The externalities associated 
with producing t-shirts include the pesticides used to grow the cotton, the chemicals used to 
dye the shirts, the fuels burned to transport the shirts to stores, and other costs.
Supply–and-demand curves are expressed in monetary units. So in order to incorporate 
externalities into this model, they also need to be measured in dollars. Assume for now that 
the negative externalities associated with the production of each t-shirt total $3.00 in damages. 
We consider the issue of how these damages are actually measured later in the chapter.
The social marginal cost curve in Figure 13.1 equals the private production costs plus the 
$3.00 externality cost. But for the market participants—the consumers and producers—the 
externalities costs are irrelevant. The equilibrium outcome will be determined through the 
normal interaction of demand and (private) supply. Thus market equilibrium is at point EM, 
at a price of $8.00 per shirt and a quantity of 25,000 shirts.
Our welfare analysis from Chapter 6 found EM to be the economically efﬁcient outcome. 
But now we consider the impact of the negative externalities. The vertical distance between 
externalities: side 
effects or unintended 
consequences, either 
positive or negative, 
that affect persons 
or entities such as 
the environment that 
are not among the 
economic actors di-
rectly involved in the 
economic activity that 
caused the effect

294 
CHAPTER 13 — THE ECONOMICS OF THE ENVIRONMENT
the two marginal cost curves represents the $3.00 externality damage per shirt. This damage 
occurs for every shirt up to the quantity sold of 25,000. Thus the total externality damage is the 
shaded area in Figure 13.1. With 25,000 shirts and damage of $3.00 per shirt, the externality 
damage thus totals $75,000.
1.2 INTERNALIZING NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES
In a market without externalities, we learned in Chapter 6 that the market outcome was 
economically efﬁcient. Any government intervention, such as price ﬂoors or price ceilings, 
reduced total welfare. But when we introduce negative externalities, is the market outcome 
still efﬁcient?
We can answer this question by looking at Figure 13.1. The marginal beneﬁts of t-shirts 
exceed the social marginal costs up to point E*, at 20,000 t-shirts. So up to 20,000 t-shirts, 
net social beneﬁts are positive, and even with the externality damage, it makes sense to 
produce each of these t-shirts.
But notice that, beyond point E*, the social marginal costs exceed the marginal beneﬁts. 
For every t-shirt above 20,000, society is actually becoming worse off when we consider the 
externality damage as well as the production costs. Thus the market equilibrium quantity of 
25,000 is too high. The economically efﬁcient outcome is E*, at 20,000 shirts. The market 
outcome is inefﬁcient.
Given that the unregulated market outcome is inefﬁcient when externalities are present, 
can economic efﬁciency be increased through government intervention? The most common 
policy response to a market with externalities is to tax the product. When a product causes 
a negative externality, a tax that is levied speciﬁcally to lower or eliminate that externality 
is called a Pigovian tax, after British economist Arthur Pigou, who proposed the idea in the 
1920s.
A Pigovian tax operates in the same way as an excise tax. As you will remember from 
Chapter 12, instituting a tax increases production costs, effectively shifting the supply curve 
upward. By setting the Pigovian tax at the “right” level, we obtain a new supply curve, 
SupplyTax, illustrated in Figure 13.2. Note that this supply curve is the same as the social 
marginal cost curve from Figure 13.1. With this tax in place, the new market outcome will 
be ETax, which is the efﬁcient outcome, corresponding to E* in Figure 13.1.
We say that the Pigovian tax has “internalized the negative externality” because the 
external costs of $3.00 per t-shirt are now integrated into the market. Setting the tax equal 
to the externality damage, $3.00 per shirt, now means that the market participants pay the 
true social cost of producing t-shirts. Note that the price of t-shirts has increased from $8 to 
$10. So some of the burden of the tax has been passed on to consumers as higher prices, but

producers also bear some of the tax burden in terms of lower proﬁts (again, similar to our 
discussion of taxes from last chapter).
A detailed welfare analysis of a Pigovian tax with a negative externality is presented in 
the appendix to this chapter. That analysis proves that total social welfare increases when 
the negative externality is internalized. So unlike our welfare analysis of a tax in Chapter 12, 
in the case of a negative externality a Pigovian tax is economically efﬁcient and increases 
social welfare.
Even with a Pigovian tax, we still have some externality damage, represented by the 
shaded area in Figure 13.2. Externality damages are still $3.00 per shirt, but the quantity 
sold is now only 20,000 shirts, for a total damage of $60,000. But note that the revenue 
from the tax is also $60,000 (a $3.00 tax per shirt, collected on 20,000 shirts). Thus the 
government collects exactly enough in tax revenue to compensate society for the damage 
done by producing t-shirts! If conditions change in such a way that the same kind of 
pollution caused greater harm—suppose, for example, that more people develop allergic 
reactions to the chemicals used to dye the shirts—then it would be appropriate to raise the 
tax accordingly.
Although the use of a Pigovian tax corrects the inefﬁciency caused by the negative 
externality, it does not provide a mechanism for compensating those who continue to suffer 
pollution damage. Nor does it indicate how the government revenues from the tax should be 
used. Some economists suggest that the tax revenues should be used simply to lower other 
taxes (discussed further below). It is also possible to use the revenues for direct compensation 
of those affected or environmental improvement. Given that environmental taxes tend to be 
regressive (because, e.g., purchases of t-shirts would be a higher proportion of income for a 
poor person than for a rich one), it may make sense to devote at least part of the revenues to 
rebates to compensate lower-income people for the impact of the tax.
1.3 POSITIVE EXTERNALITIES
Externalities can also be positive, meaning that an economic transaction positively affects those 
outside the market. One example is a homeowner who installs solar panels on his or her house. 
Society as a whole beneﬁts because the solar panels reduce the need for generating electricity 
from fossil fuels, thus improving air quality and reducing other ecological damages. 
We present a basic analysis of a positive externality in Figure 13.3. The normal demand 
curve represents the marginal beneﬁts of the product, solar panels in this example, to 
consumers—or the “private” marginal beneﬁts. The market equilibrium is EM, which is the 
normal intersection of supply and demand. The market price of solar panels would be PM 
and the quantity sold would be QM.

A Pigovian tax reduces the 
magnitude of a negative externality. 
If set at the correct level, the tax 
results in the socially efﬁcient level 
of production.

CHAPTER 13 — THE ECONOMICS OF THE ENVIRONMENT
We can incorporate a positive externality into our supply-and-demand model by realizing 
that a positive externality is an additional beneﬁt obtained by society, over and above the 
private beneﬁts of consumers. Thus we can add the positive externality beneﬁts to the 
demand curve to obtain the social marginal beneﬁts of the product. This is shown in Figure 
13.3. Note that for every solar panel between QM and Q*, the social marginal beneﬁts exceed 
the marginal costs (i.e., the supply curve). The economically efﬁcient level of solar panel 
production is E*, not EM. The unregulated market produces too few solar panels, from the 
broader perspective of social welfare.
In the case of a positive externality, a common policy recommendation is to subsidize the 
product to encourage greater production. A subsidy is a per-unit payment to producers to 
offset, and thus lower, their production costs. This effectively encourages greater production. 
We model a subsidy by shifting the supply curve downward. With the subsidy in place, the 
new supply curve is SupplySubsidy, and the new equilibrium point is ES. The resulting level of 
solar panels sales, Q*, is the “right” level from the broader social perspective.
The complete welfare analysis of a positive externality is slightly complex, so we do not 
present it here. But the conclusion of a formal welfare analysis is that a subsidy in the case 
of a product with a positive externality increases overall social welfare. As in the case of a 
negative externality, the unregulated market is inefﬁcient and government intervention is 
necessary to obtain the efﬁcient outcome.
1.4 POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF EXTERNALITIES
The existence of externalities presents one of the strongest justiﬁcations for government in-
tervention in markets. Externalities are an example of market failure, as discussed in Chapter 
6. When externalities exist, the unregulated market does not produce the socially efﬁcient 
outcome.
Our analysis of externalities has profound policy implications, particularly for negative 
environmental externalities. Virtually every product produced in modern markets results in 
some pollution and polluting waste. Given that a Pigovian tax increases economic efﬁciency, 
is it then reasonable to ask whether we should tax every product based on its environmental 
impacts?
Few economists would support trying to place an environmental tax on every product. The 
ﬁrst reason is that we must consider the administrative costs of collecting Pigovian taxes. 
For some products with relatively minor environmental impacts, the social beneﬁts probably 
are not worth the administrative costs. Second, the task of estimating the environmental 
damage of every product, in dollars, is clearly excessive. Again, for many products the cost 
of obtaining a monetary estimate probably is not worth the effort.

THE THEORY OF EXTERNALITIES

But some economists have suggested a broad system of upstream taxes on the most 
environmentally damaging products, particularly on fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) 
and important minerals. An upstream tax is placed as close as possible to the point where raw 
materials are extracted. In the case of coal, for example, an upstream tax might be instituted 
on each ton of coal extracted from coal mines. In addition to administrative simplicity, another 
advantage of upstream taxes is that the environmental damages of ﬁnal consumer products 
do not need to be estimated. Instead, after we have estimated the damages associated with 
coal extraction and burning, the costs of the upstream tax would carry through numerous 
production processes and eventually increase the price of goods and services that are dependent 
on coal as an input, such as electricity.
Although various countries have some negative externality taxes, such as excise taxes on 
gasoline, no country has such a broad system of upstream Pigovian taxes. Figure 13.4 shows the 
magnitude of environmental taxation, as a percentage of total tax revenues, in various developed 
countries. Few countries collect more than 10 percent of their total tax revenue from environmental 
taxes. Among developed countries, the United States collects the lowest percentage.
The main barrier to increasing environmental taxes is that few politicians are willing 
to support higher taxes. However, environmental taxes can be revenue-neutral if any tax 
increases are offset by lowering other taxes so that the total taxes on an average household 
remain unchanged. Given that environmental taxes tend to be regressive, revenue neutrality 
could be achieved by reducing a regressive tax, such as social insurance taxes. In addition to 
economic efﬁciency, a broad shift away from taxes on income and toward taxes on negative 
externalities also provides people with more options to reduce their tax burden.
If environmental taxes constituted a large portion of someone’s total tax burden, he or 
she could reduce this burden by using more efﬁcient vehicles and appliances, relying more 
on public transportation, reducing energy use, and numerous other options. Of course, that 
is not always easy to do; one example is someone whose job requires a long commute in a 
location in which public transportation is not available. In such a case, it becomes necessary

for government involvement to go beyond taxes and subsidies, to take into account the 
social infrastructure and institutions that will allow people—especially those whose ﬁnancial 
resources limit their individual options—to respond without undue pain to the signals given 
by a market that has been shifted toward greater environmental responsibility.
Despite the economic logic supporting taxes on negative externalities, many environmentally 
damaging activities, including fossil-fuel production, mining minerals, and harvesting timber, 
are actually subsidized instead of taxed (see Box 13.1). Obviously, this results in pollution 
levels that are not optimal. From an economic point of view, these subsidies are perverse—that 
is, they encourage exactly those activities that we should be seeking to discourage.
BOX 13.1 FOSSIL-FUEL SUBSIDIES
According to analysis by Bloomberg New Energy 
Finance, global subsidies for fossil fuels are about twelve 
times higher than those allocated for renewable energy. 
In 2009 global subsidies for renewable energy totaled 
$43 million to $46 billion, mainly in the form of tax cred-
its and price guarantees. Meanwhile, the International 
Energy Agency estimated that governments spent about 
$550 billion to subsidize fossil fuels.
The Group of 20, a group of major countries includ-
ing the United States, China, Germany, and Russia, 
have agreed to phase out fossil-fuel subsidies over 
“the medium term,” but progress has been slow and 
no speciﬁc target date has been set. Meanwhile, many 
countries are ramping up their commitment to renew-
able energy. The most expensive renewable energy 
subsidy in 2009 was about $10 billion for Germany’s 
feed-in tariff, a policy that guarantees long-term prices 
for suppliers of renewable energy. Other feed-in tariffs 
in Europe totaled another $10 billion.
The United States spent more than any other coun-
try in renewable-energy subsidies in 2009, around 
$18 billion. China provided about $2 billion, although 
this ﬁgure is likely too low as it does not include the 
value of low-interest loans offered for renewable 
energy projects by state-owned banks.

willingness-to-pay 
(WTP) principle: 
the economic value 
of something, such 
as an environmental 
beneﬁt, is equal to the 
maximum amount 
people are willing to 
pay for it
2. VALUING THE ENVIRONMENT
In order to set a Pigovian tax at the correct level, we need to estimate the negative externality 
damage in monetary terms. Environmental damage includes such diverse effects as reduced 
air and water quality, biodiversity loss, human health impacts, and lost recreation opportuni-
ties. Economists have developed various techniques to estimate environmental values. We 
summarize some of these methods below, but ﬁrst we address the conceptual approach to 
measuring the value of the environment.
2.1 TOTAL ECONOMIC VALUE
In a broad sense, everyone “values” the environment. All life depends on various natural 
systems, including those that process waste and provide energy. But to an economist, the term 
“value” has a speciﬁc meaning. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) principle states that something 
has economic value only according to the maximum amount that people are willing to pay for 
it. Note that this principle represents an extension of the market concept of marginal beneﬁts. 
As discussed in Chapter 4, a demand curve is made up of points that indicate the maximum 
willingness-to-pay of consumers for a good or service. Although most environmental attributes 
are not traded in markets, people may still place signiﬁcant value on them.
The aggregate social value of something is the sum of each individual’s WTP. Although 
each individual’s preferences count in this framework, it is also important to recognize that 
the ability to pay varies across individuals. Thus instead of a “one person, one vote” approach, 
the WTP principle translates to “one dollar, one vote.”
Another implication of this approach is that if no one is willing to pay to preserve something, 
then it does not have economic value. So the economic value of an endangered insect species 

 
VALUING THE ENVIRONMENT 
299
in a remote forest, which has no obvious human uses, may well be zero. However, some 
economists believe that nature has certain inherent rights apart from any human economic 
values. In particular, even if the WTP to preserve a species is zero, the species could still be 
said to have intrinsic value, or value in a broader ecological or ethical sense, and thus have 
a right to exist.* Intrinsic value is especially difﬁcult to express in monetary terms.
People’s willingness to pay for environmental attributes may derive from a variety of 
motivations. Potential reasons for valuing the environment include:
1. Proﬁt-making enterprises: activities such as harvesting timber, ﬁshing, grazing, and ag-
riculture depend on natural systems.
2. Recreation: natural sites provide places for outdoor recreation, including camping, hiking, 
ﬁshing, hunting, and viewing wildlife.
3. Ecosystem services: tangible beneﬁts obtained freely from nature, simply as a result of 
natural processes. Ecosystem services include nutrient recycling, ﬂood protection from 
wetlands and vegetation, waste assimilation, carbon storage in trees and other plants, 
water puriﬁcation, and pollination by bees.
4. Nonuse beneﬁts: nontangible welfare beneﬁts that we obtain from nature. Nonuse beneﬁts 
include the psychological beneﬁts that people gain just from knowing that natural places 
exist, even if they will never visit them. The value that people gain from knowing that 
ecosystems will be available to future generations is another type of nonuse beneﬁt.
The total economic value of a natural system is the sum of all the beneﬁts for which 
people are willing to pay. Thus the total economic value of, for eample, a national forest is 
the sum of any proﬁts obtained from harvesting timber, the WTP of all those who engage in 
recreation in the forest, the value of the ecosystem services such as soil erosion prevention 
and carbon storage, and the nonuse beneﬁts that people obtain from knowing that the forest 
exists. It is important to realize that in calculating total economic value, priority is not given 
to any particular use of the forest. When uses are incompatible, such as deciding whether a 
particular tract of forest should be clear cut or preserved for recreation and wildlife habitat, 
economic analysis can help to determine which use provides the highest overall economic 
value to society.
2.2 NONMARKET VALUATION METHODOLOGIES
We have already seen how we can determine the economic beneﬁts of a market good or 
service—it is equal to the sum of consumer and producer surplus. But many of the ben-
eﬁts that we obtain from the environment are not traded in markets. If we are to estimate 
total economic value, we need techniques to estimate such values as recreation beneﬁts, 
ecosystem services, and nonuse values. These techniques are referred to as nonmarket 
valuation, because they produce beneﬁt estimates for goods and services that are not di-
rectly traded in markets.
Nonmarket valuation techniques come in four main types:
1. the cost of illness method
2. replacement cost methods
3. revealed preference methods
4. stated preference methods
We summarize each of these methods, including the advantages and disadvantages of each.
*There is a disciplinary distinction between economists who study environmental issues. Traditional environmental 
economics generally recognizes only values backed by WTP. The notion that nature has certain inherent rights is a principle of 
ecological economics, a more recent subdiscipline that emphasizes the need to preserve ecosystem functions.

CHAPTER 13 — THE ECONOMICS OF THE ENVIRONMENT
Cost of Illness Method
The cost of illness method is used to estimate the damage of reductions in environmental qual-
ity that have human health consequences. Conversely, it can be used to estimate the beneﬁts 
of improvements in environmental quality (i.e., the avoided damages). This method estimates 
the direct and indirect costs related to illnesses with environmental causes. The direct costs 
include medical costs such as ofﬁce visits and medication paid by individuals and insurers 
and lost wages due to illness. Indirect costs can include decreases in human capital (e.g., if 
a child misses a signiﬁcant number of school days due to illness), welfare losses from pain 
and suffering, and decreases in economic productivity due to work absences.
The cost of illness method generally provides us with only a lower-bound estimate of 
the WTP to avoid illnesses. The true WTP could be higher because the actual expenses may 
not capture the full losses to individuals from illness. But even a lower-bound estimate could 
provide policy guidance. For example, in 2007 the cost of asthma in the United States was 
estimated to be $56 billion, based on direct medical costs and productivity losses from missed 
days of school and work.4 The costs for a typical affected worker totaled about $3,500. These 
estimates provide a starting point for determining whether efforts to reduce asthma cases are 
economically efﬁcient.
Replacement Cost Methods
Replacement cost methods can be used to estimate the value of ecosystem services. These 
approaches consider the costs of human actions that substitute for lost ecosystem services. For 
example, a community could construct a water treatment plant to make up for the lost water 
puriﬁcation beneﬁts from a forest habitat. The natural pollination of plants by bees could, 
to some extent, be done by hand or machine. If we can estimate the costs of these substitute 
actions, in terms of construction and labor costs, these can be considered an approximation 
of society’s WTP for these ecosystem services.
Although replacement cost methods are often used to estimate ecosystem service values, 
they are not necessarily measures of WTP. Suppose that a community could construct a 
water treatment plant for $50 million to offset the water puriﬁcation services of a nearby 
forest. This estimate does not tell us whether the community would actually be willing to 
pay the $50 million should the forest be damaged. Actual WTP could be more or less than 
$50 million and is fundamentally unrelated to the cost of the water puriﬁcation plant. So, in 
this sense, replacement cost estimates should be used with caution. However, if we know 
that the community would be willing to pay $50 million for a water treatment plant if the 
ecosystem services of the forest are lost, then we could conclude that $50 million represents 
a lower bound of the value of the water puriﬁcation beneﬁts of the forest.
Revealed Preference Methods
Although markets do not exist for many environmental goods and services, we can sometimes 
infer the values that people place on them through their behavior in other markets. Revealed 
preference methods are techniques that obtain nonmarket values based on people’s decisions 
in related markets. Economists generally prefer deriving nonmarket values based on actual 
market behavior. Thus revealed preference methods are generally considered the most valid 
approach to nonmarket valuation. However, the environmental beneﬁts for which revealed 
preference methods can be used to provide nonmarket values are limited.
One common type of revealed preference method is represented by travel cost models. 
These models are used to estimate the economic beneﬁts that people obtain by engaging in 
recreation at natural sites such as national parks or lakes. Even if the recreation site does not 
charge an entry fee, all visitors must pay a “price” equal to their costs to travel to the site, 
such as gas, plane tickets, accommodations, and even the time required to travel to the site. As

recreation beneﬁts of 
natural sites based on 
variations in the travel 
costs paid by visitors 
from different regions

 
VALUING THE ENVIRONMENT 
301
visitors to a recreation site from different regions effectively pay a different price, economists 
can use this information to derive a demand curve for the site using statistical models, and 
thus estimate consumer surplus. Travel cost models are most applicable for recreation sites 
that attract visitors from distant places, in order to provide enough variation in travel costs 
to estimate a demand curve.
Numerous travel cost models have estimated the recreational beneﬁts of natural sites. 
For example, a 2010 study of recreational visitors to the Murray River in Australia found 
that the average visitor received a consumer surplus of US$155 per day.5 Travel cost models 
have been used to explore how changes in the ﬁsh catch rate affect the consumer surplus 
of anglers visiting sites in Wisconsin6 and how a drought affects the beneﬁts of visitors to 
reservoirs in California.7
Another type of revealed preference method is the defensive expenditures approach. 
This approach is applicable in situations where people are able to take actions to reduce their 
exposure to environmental harm. For example, people with concerns about their drinking 
water quality may choose to purchase bottled water or install a water ﬁltration system. These 
expenditures may reﬂect their WTP for water quality. For example, a 2006 study in Brazil 
found that households were paying US$16–$19 per month on defensive expenditures to 
improve drinking water quality.8
A limitation of the defensive expenditures approach is that people may be taking defensive 
actions for a variety of reasons, some unrelated to environmental quality. For example, 
other reasons for buying bottled water may include convenience or status. Thus attributing 
the entire cost of bottled water as a measure of concern about drinking water quality would 
not be appropriate in such cases. It also suffers from the inherent problem of any market 
valuation: The preferences of the rich weigh much more heavily than the preferences of the 
poor. Plenty of people around the world who are actually suffering from the health effects 
of impure water may not be able to afford to buy bottled water; thus their abstract WTP is 
made invisible by inability to pay.
In addition to the serious problem of unequal ability to pay, the approaches just described—
the defensive expenditures approach and travel cost models—cannot be used to obtain beneﬁt 
estimates for ecosystem services and nonuse values. Thus in order to obtain estimates of total 
economic value for many environmental goods and services, we need a technique that can 
provide us some estimate of these values.
Stated Preference Methods
The ﬁnal nonmarket valuation technique that we consider is the most used, as well as the most 
controversial. Stated preference methods directly obtain information on people’s prefer-
ences in a hypothetical scenario simply by asking them. The most common stated preference 
method is contingent valuation, in which survey respondents are asked questions about their 
WTP for a speciﬁc hypothetical outcome.
The main advantage of contingent valuation is that surveys can be designed to ask 
respondents about any type of environmental beneﬁt. For example, a 2012 study found that 
households in Spain were willing to pay an average of $22 per year for a hypothetical reduction 
in highway noise and air pollution.9 A 2011 paper determined that the WTP for preserving 
marine biodiversity in the Azores Islands was $121 to $837 (as a one-time payment).10
Although hundreds of contingent valuation studies have been conducted in the past several 
decades, the validity of the results remains highly controversial. Given that respondents’ 
preferences are based on a hypothetical scenario, and they do not actually have to pay anything, 
some economists consider the results ﬂawed because of various biases. For example, a 
respondent who generally favors biodiversity preservation may have an incentive to overstate 
his or her actual WTP in order to inﬂuence the policy process. Some respondents may not 
accurately consider their income limitations when stating WTP values; this gets around

CHAPTER 13 — THE ECONOMICS OF THE ENVIRONMENT
the “ability to pay” problem, but does not produce the kind of WTP estimates that many 
economists seek as “realistic.”
Yet contingent valuation remains the only way to estimate some environmental beneﬁts, 
particularly nonuse values. So, the debate over the method often centers on whether some 
estimate is better than no estimate. The debate over contingent valuation occurs mostly among 
academics, but the issue became relevant to businesses and policymakers in the wake of the 
1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. The lawsuit against Exxon sought compensation for 
billions of dollars in lost nonuse values, as a result of the damage done to a relatively pristine 
marine environment. The federal government convened a panel of top economists, including 
two Nobel Prize winners, to review the contingent valuation method. Their report concluded 
that contingent valuation studies “can produce estimates reliable enough to be the starting 
point of a judicial process,” but it also recognized the method’s “likely tendency to exaggerate 
willingness to pay” and provided a list of demanding guidelines for future studies.11
Some of the problems associated with contingent valuation can be avoided by using 
contingent ranking, another stated preference method. In contingent ranking, respondents 
are asked to rank various hypothetical scenarios according to their preferences. Thus there 
is no potential for respondents to exaggerate their WTP.
2.3 COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS
The nonmarket valuation methods discussed above can be used to estimate the negative externali-
ties associated with various goods and services. These methods can also be used to determine 
whether a particular policy or public project should be undertaken. For example, consider a 
proposal to build a large dam or a new law to increase air quality standards. One of the approaches 
used to evaluate these proposals is to ask whether its economic beneﬁts exceed its costs. Cost-
beneﬁt analysis (CBA) seeks to convert all costs and beneﬁts to a common metric.
In theory, measuring all impacts in dollars (or another monetary unit) produces a “bottom-
line” result (i.e., a single number) so that we can choose which alternative results in the highest 
net social value. In practice, however, CBA is often incomplete, with some impacts unable 
to be estimated in monetary terms. The results may be dependent on speciﬁc assumptions. 
Sometimes, one side of the analysis—the costs or the beneﬁts—are more fully ﬂeshed out 
than the other, making it difﬁcult to arrive at an objective recommendation.
The basic steps of a CBA are relatively straightforward:
1. List all costs and beneﬁts of the project or policy proposal. Typically, this involves devel-
oping several scenarios.
2. Convert all costs and beneﬁts to monetary values. Some values can be obtained based on 
market analysis, while other values will require nonmarket valuation.
3. Add up all the costs and beneﬁts to determine the net beneﬁts of each scenario. Sometimes, 
the results are expressed as a ratio (i.e., beneﬁts divided by costs).
4. Choose the scenario that is the most economically efﬁcient.
The most appealing feature of CBA may be its seeming objectivity. It also presents a way to 
argue for environmental protection in economic terms, rather than on ethical or ecological terms. 
Many CBAs have shown that the WTP for environmental protection can be quite high.
Of course, all the problems with the nonmarket valuation techniques discussed above can 
complicate CBA. Two additional issues often arise in environmental CBAs: how to value 
costs and beneﬁts that occur in the future, and how to value human lives.
Discounting the Future
Many environmental policies involve paying costs in the short term, while the beneﬁts will 
be obtained further in the future. For example, installing pollution control equipment has an 
contingent ranking: 
a stated preference 
method in which re-
spondents are asked 
to rank various hypo-
thetical scenarios
cost-beneﬁt analy-
sis: a technique to 
analyze a policy or 
project proposal in 
which all costs and 
beneﬁts are con-
verted to monetary 
estimates, if possible, 
to determine the net 
social value

 
VALUING THE ENVIRONMENT

upfront cost, while the health beneﬁts of reduced cancer rates will only be realized decades 
in the future. Thus we need a way to compare impacts that occur at different times.
There is a natural human tendency to focus on the present more than the future. Most people 
would prefer to receive a beneﬁt now over a similar beneﬁt in the future. There may also be 
practical reasons to prefer monetary beneﬁts now, if they can be invested to provide increased 
returns in the future. Economists incorporate this concept into CBA through discounting. 
Discounting effectively reduces the weight placed on any cost or beneﬁt that occurs in the future. 
The further in the future the cost or beneﬁt occurs, the less weight is given to that impact. In 
order to compare an impact that occurs in the present to an impact that occurs in the future, the 
future impact must be converted to an equivalent present value using the following formula:
PV (Xn) = Xn / (1 + r)n
where Xn is the monetary value of the cost or beneﬁt, n is the number of years in the future 
the impact occurs, and r is the discount rate—the annual percentage rate by which future 
impacts are reduced, expressed as a proportion. For example, if the discount rate was 3 per-
cent, r would be 0.03.
A simple example illustrates how discounting works. Suppose that we are analyzing a 
proposal to improve air quality. Assume that the cost of this proposal, including the installation 
of new pollution control equipment, is $10 million, to be paid right now. The beneﬁts of 
cleaner air are estimated at $20 million, but these beneﬁts will occur 25 years in the future.* 
Should we approve this law?
In order to obtain the present value of the $20 million beneﬁt, we need to choose a discount 
rate. Suppose that we apply a discount rate of 5 percent. The present value of the beneﬁts 
would be:
PV = $20 million / (1.05)25 = $5,906,055
As the present value of the $20 million beneﬁt in 25 years is only about $6 million, it does 
not make economic sense to pay $10 million now to obtain this beneﬁt. But suppose instead 
that we apply a discount rate of 2 percent. In this case, the present value of the beneﬁts is:
PV = $20 million / (1.02)25 = $12,190,617
In this case, the net beneﬁts of the proposal are positive (i.e., the present value of the 
beneﬁts exceeds the costs by about $2 million). At the lower discount rate, the proposal 
makes economic sense. This example illustrates the importance of the choice of a discount 
rate. We will see that this is particularly true in Chapter 14, when we discuss analyses of 
global climate change.
One approach for choosing a discount rate is to set it equal to the rate of return on low-risk 
investments such as government bonds. The rationale for this is that any funds used for a 
beneﬁcial public project could otherwise be invested to provide society with greater resources 
in the future. In early 2013, the nominal rate of return on a 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was 
3 percent.12 However, this rate has varied considerably over time. Thus some economists 
question whether we should base the valuation of long-term environmental impacts on an 
interest rate that is subject to changeable ﬁnancial market conditions.
Other approaches to choosing a discount rate consider the ethical dimension of valuing 
future impacts. In some sense, a positive discount rate implies that future generations count 
less than the current generation. Although nearly all economists believe in the principle of 
discounting: an ap-
proach in which costs 
and beneﬁts that oc-
cur in the future are 
assigned less weight 
(i.e., discounted) rela-
tive to current costs 
and beneﬁts
present value: 
the current value 
of a future cost or 
beneﬁt, obtained by 
discounting
discount rate: the 
annual percentage 
rate at which future 
costs and beneﬁts are 
discounted relative 
to current costs and 
beneﬁts
*In reality, the beneﬁts would occur over the course of several years in the future. Here, for the sake of simplicity, we 
assume that all the beneﬁts occur in a single year, 25 years from now.

304 
CHAPTER 13 — THE ECONOMICS OF THE ENVIRONMENT
discounting, economists who are more concerned about long-term environmental damages 
tend to prefer lower discount rates.*
Valuing Human Lives
Another controversial aspect of CBA is analyzing policies that affect human mortality rates. The 
beneﬁts of many environmental policies, such as those addressing air and water quality, are often 
expressed in terms of the number of avoided deaths. In a CBA framework, we seek to convert all 
beneﬁts to monetary values to make them directly comparable to the costs. Suppose that we are 
analyzing a policy that will improve air quality at a cost of $500 million to society, but reduce the 
number of deaths associated with air pollution by 50. Is such a policy “worth it” to society?
Although economists are not in the business of placing a value on the life of any particular 
person, their goal is to estimate how people value relatively minor changes in mortality risk 
and use this information to infer the value of a statistical life (VSL). A VSL estimate, in 
theory, indicates how much society is willing to pay to reduce the number of deaths from 
environmental pollution by one, without any reference to whose death will be avoided.
An example illustrates how a VSL is estimated. Let’s assume that we conduct a contingent 
valuation survey to ask people how much they would be willing to pay to improve air quality 
such that the number of deaths from air pollution would decline by 50. Each respondent’s risk 
of dying from air pollution would decline slightly as a result of the policy. Suppose that the 
survey results indicate that the average household is willing to pay $10 per year for this policy. 
If society comprises 100 million households, then the total WTP for the policy would be:
100 million * $10 = $1 billion
Because this is the aggregate WTP to reduce deaths by 50, the VSL would be:
$1 billion / 50 = $20 million
Some people object to valuing human lives on ethical grounds. Others counter that we 
must explicitly or implicitly analyze the tradeoffs between public expenditures and health 
beneﬁts, and the VSL methodology provides a transparent approach. Major environmental 
policy proposals in the United States must be reviewed using CBA, and thus government 
agencies must often apply a VSL. The VSLs used by government agencies have varied but 
generally increased over time, from around $2 million in the 1980s to nearly $10 million more 
recently. In other words, regulations that can reduce environmental deaths at a cost of less 
than $10 million per avoided death would be considered economically efﬁcient. (For more 
on the economic, and political, debate about the VSL in the United States, see Box 13.2.)
Other Difﬁculties with Cost Beneﬁt Analysis
Most environmental cost-beneﬁt analyses are further complicated by several other issues. 
These include:
1. analysis of uncertainty
2. missing monetary values
3. sensitivity to assumptions
Consider a proposal to build a large dam for ﬂood protection. The beneﬁts of ﬂood 
protection depend somewhat on future climate conditions, which are difﬁcult to predict with 
*A 0 percent discount rate implies that any impact that occurs in the future, even those in the distant future, count the same as 
a current impact. Economists have tended to justify some discounting on the assumption that future generations will have higher 
incomes and better technology and will thus be better equipped to deal with problems created in the present. However, some 
economists note that environmental damages and resource constraints could lead to lower standards of living in the future.

305
a high degree of certainty. There may also be a small chance that the dam will fail, perhaps 
causing catastrophic damage. Another example is analyzing the risk of a major oil spill, 
which requires one to estimate the probability that such a spill will occur. Incorporating such 
uncertainty into a CBA is possible if we have some idea of the probability of various outcomes, 
but some risks are fundamentally difﬁcult to predict. In these cases, some economists advocate 
the precautionary principle: that policies should err on the side of caution when there is a 
low-probability risk of a catastrophic outcome.
In almost any real-world environmental CBA, we will be unable to estimate all impacts 
in monetary terms. For example, how can we estimate the beneﬁts of a recreation site that 
is not yet available? We may be able to “transfer” an estimate from an existing similar 
recreation site, but we cannot be sure that the transferred estimate is valid for the new site. 
Also, government agencies frequently do not have the resources to fund original studies to 
estimate all needed values. We may be able to make an educated guess about certain missing 
values, but this obviously reduces the objectivity of a CBA.
Finally, the recommendations of many CBAs are highly dependent on various assumptions. 
As we saw earlier, the choice of a discount rate may determine whether a particular policy 
is recommended. Other assumptions may relate to how risk is analyzed or how contingent 
valuation results are interpreted. Ideally, a CBA should consider a broad range of assumptions. 
Of course, if different assumptions produce different results, then we must make a subjective 
decision about which result we should rely upon. These considerations suggest that CBA is 
often not as objective as it may seem at ﬁrst.
3. ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES IN PRACTICE
3.1 POLICY OPTIONS
A Pigovian tax is just one type of environmental policy. Policymakers generally have other 
policy options, and which one is appropriate depends on the particular context. The four basic 
environmental policy options are:
BOX 13.2 THE POLITICS OF VALUING LIFE
The valuation of human lives is not merely an eco-
nomic issue but a political one, as demonstrated by 
changes in the VSLs used by U.S. federal agencies in 
recent years. During the administration of George W. 
Bush, the VSL used by the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) was as low as $6.8 million. But in 2010, 
the EPA increased its VSL to $9.1 million in a cost-
beneﬁt analysis of air pollution standards. Under the 
administration of Barack Obama, the Food and Drug 
Administration also increased its VSL, from $5 million 
in 2008 to $7.9 million in 2010. Based on higher 
VSLs, the Transportation Department now requires 
stronger car roofs—a regulation that was rejected 
under the Bush administration as too expensive.
Under the Obama administration, federal regula-
tors are also considering adjusting the VSL based on 
the type of risk. For example, the EPA is considering 
the application of a “cancer differential” that would 
increase the VSL for cancer risks, based on surveys 
that show that people are willing to pay more to 
avoid cancer, as opposed to other health risks. The 
Department of Homeland Security has suggested 
that the willingness to pay to avoid terrorism deaths 
is about double that of other risks.
Manufacturers and power companies have tradi-
tionally advocated the use of cost-beneﬁt analysis for 
environmental policies, essentially forcing regulators 
to prove the economic efﬁciency of environmental 
improvements. But the recent VSL increases have led 
them to reconsider their approach. For example, the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce (a group that represents 
businesses) is now lobbying for Congress to have 
greater oversight of federal regulators. On the other 
hand, environmental groups, which remain critical 
of the VSL methodology, have praised the Obama 
administration for increasing these values.

CHAPTER 13 — THE ECONOMICS OF THE ENVIRONMENT
1. pollution standards
2. technology-based regulation
3. Pigovian (or pollution) taxes
4. tradable pollution permits
Pollution Standards
Pollution standards control environmental impacts by setting allowable pollution levels or 
controlling the uses of a product or process. Many people are faced with such standards at an 
automobile inspection. Cars must meet certain standards for tailpipe emissions; if your car fails 
to meet them, you must correct the problem before you can receive an inspection sticker.
The clear advantage of standards is that they can specify a deﬁnite result. This is particularly 
important in the case of substances that pose a clear hazard to public health. By imposing a 
uniform rule on all producers, we can be sure that no factory or product will produce hazardous 
levels of pollutants. In extreme cases, a regulation can simply ban a particular pollutant, as 
has been the case with DDT (a toxic pesticide) in most countries.
However, requiring all ﬁrms or products to meet the same standard is normally not cost 
effective. The overall use of society’s resources is reduced if ﬁrms that can reduce pollution 
at low marginal costs reduce pollution more than ﬁrms that have high marginal reduction 
costs. Thus requiring all ﬁrms to reduce pollution by the same amount or to meet the same 
standards is not the least-cost way to achieve a given level of pollution reduction. Another 
problem with standards is that after ﬁrms meet the standard, they have little incentive to 
reduce pollution further.
Technology-Based Regulation
A second approach to environmental regulation is requiring ﬁrms or products to incorporate 
a particular pollution-control technology. For example, in 1975 the United States required 
that all new automobiles include a catalytic converter to reduce tailpipe emissions. Although 
auto manufacturers are free to design their own catalytic converters, each must meet certain 
emissions speciﬁcations.
Perhaps the main advantage of technology-based regulation is that enforcement and 
monitoring costs are relatively low. Unlike a pollution standard, which requires that ﬁrms’ 
pollution levels be monitored to ensure compliance, a technology-based approach might require 
only an occasional check to ensure that the equipment is installed and functioning properly.
Technology-based approaches are also unlikely to be cost effective, however, because 
they do not provide ﬁrms with the ﬂexibility to pursue a wide range of options. Like meeting 
pollution standards, the cost of implementing speciﬁc technologies varies among ﬁrms. 
Technology-based approaches may, however, offer a cost advantage due to standardization. 
If all ﬁrms must adopt a speciﬁc technology, then widespread production of that technology 
may drive down its production cost down over time.
Pigovian (or Pollution) Taxes
Pollution taxes, along with tradable pollution permits, are considered market-based ap-
proaches to pollution regulation because they send information to polluters about the costs 
of pollution without mandating that ﬁrms take speciﬁc actions. Individual ﬁrms are not re-
quired to reduce pollution under a market-based approach, but the regulation creates a strong 
incentive for action.
As we saw earlier in the chapter, a pollution tax reﬂects the principle of internalizing 
externalities. If producers must bear the costs associated with pollution by paying a tax, 
they will ﬁnd it in their interest to reduce pollution so long as the marginal costs of reducing 
pollution are lower than the tax.

ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES IN PRACTICE 
307
Figure 13.5 illustrates how an individual ﬁrm will respond in the presence of a pollution 
tax. Qmax is the level of pollution emitted without any regulation. The MCR curve shows the 
marginal cost of pollution reduction for the ﬁrm. If a pollution tax of T is imposed, the ﬁrm 
will be motivated to reduce pollution to level QTax, at a total cost of B, equal to the area under 
its MCR curve between QTax and Qmax. If the ﬁrm maintained pollution at Qmax it would have 
to pay a tax of (B + C) on these units of pollution. Thus the ﬁrm saves area C by reducing 
pollution to QTax.
After reducing pollution to QTax, the ﬁrm will still need to pay a tax on its remaining units 
of pollution, equal to area A. The total cost to the ﬁrm from the pollution tax is the sum of its 
pollution reduction costs and tax payments, or areas (A + B). This is smaller than areas (A 
+ B + C), which is what it would have to pay in taxes if it undertook no pollution reduction. 
The ﬁrm’s response to the tax is cost effective, as any other level of pollution different from 
QTax would impose higher costs.
All other ﬁrms in the industry will determine how much to reduce their pollution based 
on their own MCR curve. Assuming that each ﬁrm is acting in a cost-effective manner, the 
total cost of pollution reduction is minimized. Firms that can reduce pollution at low cost 
will reduce pollution more than ﬁrms that face a higher cost. This is the main advantage of 
market-based approaches to pollution regulation—they achieve a given level of pollution 
reduction at the lowest overall cost. In other words, they are more economically efﬁcient 
than pollution standards or technology-based approaches.
Tradable Pollution Permits
Economic efﬁciency in pollution control is clearly an advantage. One disadvantage of pollution 
taxes, however, is that it is very difﬁcult to predict the total amount of pollution reduction a 
given tax will achieve. It depends on the shape of each ﬁrm’s MCR curve, which is usually 
not known to policymakers.
An alternative is to set up a system of tradable pollution permits. The total number of 
permits issued equals the desired target level of pollution. These permits can then be allocated 
freely to existing ﬁrms or sold at auction. After they are allocated, they are fully tradable, 
or transferable, among ﬁrms or other interested parties. Firms can choose for themselves 
whether to reduce pollution or to purchase permits for the pollution that they produce—but 
the total volume of pollution produced by all ﬁrms cannot exceed a maximum amount equal 
to the total number of permits.
Firms with higher MCR curves will generally seek to purchase permits so that they do 
not have to pay high pollution reduction costs. Firms that can reduce pollution at a lower

cost may be willing to sell permits, as long as they can receive more money for the permits 
than it would cost them to reduce pollution. Under this system, private groups interested in 
reducing pollution could purchase permits and simply not use them to emit pollution, thus 
reducing total emissions below the original target level. Pollution permits are normally valid 
only for a speciﬁc period. After this period expires, the government can issue fewer permits, 
resulting in lower overall pollution levels in the future.
A detailed analysis of tradable permits, which we do not present here, demonstrates that 
a given level of pollution reduction is achieved at the same total cost as levying a tax. Thus 
whether one prefers pollution taxes or tradable permits depends on factors other than pollution 
reduction costs (however, the administrative costs of the approaches may differ). Taxes are 
generally easier to understand and implement. But taxes are politically unpopular, and ﬁrms 
may prefer to use a permit system if they believe that they can successfully lobby in order 
to obtain permits for free. 
The main difference between the two approaches is where the uncertainty lies. Using 
pollution taxes, ﬁrms have certainty about the cost of emissions, which makes it easier for 
them to make decisions about long-term investments. But the resulting level of total pollution 
with a tax is unknown in advance. If pollution levels turn out to be higher than expected, then 
the government might have to take the unpopular step of raising taxes further.
Under a permit system, the level of pollution is known because the government sets the 
number of available permits. But the price of permits is unknown, and permit prices can 
vary signiﬁcantly over time. This has been the case with the European permit system for 
carbon emissions. The price of permits initially rose to around €30/ton in 2006, shortly after 
the system was instituted. But then prices plummeted to €0.10/ton in 2007, when it became 
evident that too many permits had been allocated. After some changes to the system, prices 
rose to exceed €20/ton in 2008 but then fell again to less than €3/ton in 2013. Such price 
volatility makes it difﬁcult for ﬁrms to decide whether they should make investments in 
technologies to reduce emissions.
3.2 DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES
Summary of Major Environmental Policies
Early pollution regulations enacted in the 1960s and 1970s relied primarily on standards and 
technology-based approaches. For example, the Clean Air Act, enacted by Congress in 1970, 
set maximum allowable levels of emissions for several key pollutants. The Clean Air Act 
speciﬁes that pollution standards are to be set based on the best scientiﬁc evidence to protect 
human health with an “adequate margin of safety” and adjusted over time as new evidence 
becomes available. The Act speciﬁcally rules out CBA as a factor in setting standards.
The Clean Air Act has been very successful at reducing pollution levels in the United 
States. The aggregate concentration of the six major air pollutants* has declined 68 percent 
between 1970 and 2011.13 The decline in lead pollution has been particularly dramatic—lead 
concentrations have declined 97 percent over this period, primarily as a result of banning 
lead in gasoline. A comprehensive CBA of the Clean Air Act found that in 2010 the annual 
compliance costs of the Act were $53 billion but estimates of the beneﬁts ranged from $160 
billion to $3.8 trillion.14 In other words, for every dollar spent to meet the requirements of 
the Clean Air Act, society receives between $3 to $72 in economic beneﬁts.
Technology-based approaches are often used to regulate other air pollutants as well 
as surface water quality. The Clean Water Act of 1972, for example, requires the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency to specify the “best available technology” for various 
*The six major, or criteria, pollutants are particulate matter, ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen 
oxides, and lead.

 
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES IN PRACTICE 
309
types of facilities. The Act initially focused on reducing surface water pollution from clearly-
identiﬁed sources, such as industrial plants. More recently, legislation has shifted toward the 
reduction of water pollution from stormwater and agricultural runoff.  
As discussed above, the extent of environmental taxation varies across countries. One 
indication of this is the difference in national gas taxes. Gas prices vary across countries, even 
though the wholesale price of gasoline on the global market is fairly even around the world. 
The main reason for varying gasoline prices to consumers in different countries is that the 
level of taxation differs, sometimes signiﬁcantly. In the United States, federal gasoline taxes 
are 18 cents per gallon, combined with state and local taxes that range from 8 to 51 cents per 
gallon, for a total average tax of 49 cents per gallon. In European countries, gasoline taxes are 
typically about 10 times higher, equivalent to around $4 or $5 per gallon. At the same time, 
some countries actually subsidize gasoline prices. In 2010 the cheapest gasoline prices were 
found in Venezuela ($0.09/gallon), Iran ($0.37/gallon), and Saudi Arabia ($0.61/gallon).
We can see the effect of differences in gas taxes in Figure 13.6, which shows gasoline prices 
in various countries plotted against average annual consumption per person. We observe a 
general inverse relationship, similar to a demand curve—higher gasoline prices tend to be 
associated with lower consumption. The relationship shown here, however, is not exactly the 
same as a demand curve. As we are looking at data from different countries, the assumption of 
“other things equal,” which is needed to construct a demand curve, does not hold. Differences 
in consumption may be partly a function of differences in factors other than prices, such as 
income levels. For example, while Saudi Arabia has very low gasoline prices, income levels 
are only about half those in the United States. Other reasons that gasoline consumption is so 
high in the United States may be that people need to drive longer distances for work (especially 
in the Western United States) and that public transportation options are less prevalent than in 
European countries. But the overall negative relationship suggests that higher gasoline taxes can 
be effective at reducing gasoline consumption, and thus emissions of various air pollutants.
The ﬁrst major attempt to use a tradable pollution system to control pollution was the U.S. 
program to regulate sulfur dioxide, enacted with the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act. 
The goal of the program was to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions to 50 percent of 1980 levels by 
2010. The program is widely considered a success, with a decline in emissions of 83 percent by 
2010 and costs signiﬁcantly lower than expected. (For more on this program, see Box 13.3.)

CHAPTER 13 — THE ECONOMICS OF THE ENVIRONMENT
The other major attempt at emissions trading has been the European Union’s carbon 
trading system, enacted in 2005. The initial phase covered major facilities such as electricity 
plants, cement plants, and paper mills. In 2012 the program was extended to cover airline 
transportation. As mentioned earlier, the main problem with the program has been price 
volatility, generally attributed to an over-allocation of permits during the initial phases. In 
the current phase (2013–20) the European Union is moving toward setting an overall EU 
emission limit rather than individual national limits.
The Economic Impact of Environmental Regulation
Finally, we brieﬂy consider the economic impact of environmental regulations. Envi-
ronmental laws are often accused of slowing economic growth and causing job losses. 
However, most of the evidence suggests that the notion of a tradeoff between environ-
mental quality and economic vitality is a myth. For example, a 2008 analysis of the U.S. 
economy found that
contrary to conventional wisdom, [environmental protection (EP)], economic growth, 
and jobs creation are complementary and compatible: Investments in EP create jobs 
and displace jobs, but the net effect on employment is positive.15
BOX 13.3 SULFUR DIOXIDE EMISSIONS TRADING
The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments in the United 
States created a national program to allow trading and 
banking of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, the primary 
cause of acid rain. The program applies to more than 
2,000 large electricity plants, which must hold permits 
in order to emit SO2. Most permits are freely allocated 
to plants based on their capacity to generate electric-
ity. About 3 percent of the permits are auctioned off 
every year. Permits may then be traded, normally with 
brokers facilitating trades. Although most trades occur 
between two electricity-generating plants, some permits 
are purchased by environmental groups or individuals 
(and even economics classes!) and then “retired” to 
reduce the overall quantity of SO2 emissions.
Economic theory suggests that a system of trad-
able permits can reduce pollution at a lower overall 
cost than a uniform standard. Dallas Burtraw, an 
economist with Resources for the Future, notes that 
the “SO2 allowance market presents the ﬁrst real test 
of economists’ advice, and therefore merits careful 
evaluation.” After about twenty years in operation, 
how has the program performed?
To evaluate the policy, the effects of emissions trad-
ing must be isolated from other factors. Even without 
a trading system, declining prices for low-sulfur coal in 
the 1990s, along with technological advances, would 
have reduced the cost of lowering emissions. Economic 
simulation models comparing the SO2 program to an 
emissions standard suggest that the cost savings from 
trading were about 50 percent. The savings are even 
greater than in a technology-based approach.
The emissions targets of the SO2 program have 
been met at a lower cost than originally anticipated. 
Acidiﬁcation problems in the Northeastern states, 
widespread in the past, have declined. However, 
aquatic systems in the Southeastern states are expected 
to continue to decline without further emissions reduc-
tions. And although the program has been effective, 
analysis of the marginal beneﬁts and marginal costs 
of emissions suggests that further emissions reductions 
would produce even larger net beneﬁts.
Burtraw, along with colleague Sarah Jo Szambelan, 
concludes that the SO2 market has 
been liquid and active, and according to most 
observers [has] worked well in achieving the 
emissions caps at less cost than would have been 
achieved with traditional approaches to regula-
tion. There is evidence that both process and 
patentable types of innovation are attributable to 
the [SO2 program]. At the same time, there is evi-
dence that some cost savings have been not been 
realized. Moreover, despite substantial emissions 
reductions, ultimate environmental goals have not 
been achieved.

A 2007 study in the United Kingdom also studied the effect of environmental regulation 
on employment. The results found that regulations had a slightly negative impact on 
employment, although the results were not statistically signiﬁcant. They concluded that 
their analysis found “no evidence of a trade-off between jobs and the environment.”16
Under various executive orders in the United States, starting with Ronald Reagan and more 
recently by Barack Obama, all major federal regulations, including environmental laws, must 
be reviewed using CBA. This process is designed to screen out inefﬁcient policy proposals. 
A 2011 study by the U.S. Ofﬁce of Management and Budget found that the aggregate cost 
of all federal environmental regulations enacted from 2000 to 2010 was $24 billion to $29 
billion, but beneﬁts were estimated to be $82 billion to $550 billion.17 During this period, 
environmental laws were responsible for about 60 percent to 85 percent of the beneﬁts of 
all federal regulations.
Analysis by the United Nations concludes that a signiﬁcant increase in global investment 
in renewable energy and energy efﬁciency—an amount equal to 2 percent of global 
GDP—would result in higher rates of long-term economic growth than a “business-as-
usual” scenario.18 The report ﬁnds that “green” investments beneﬁt the world’s poorest in 
particular. The poor disproportionately depend on natural resources for their livelihood. 
So investment in natural capital, including water resources, sustainable agriculture, and 
forests, increases incomes while also improving the natural environment. Investment in 
natural capital also fosters ecotourism, which offers another way to increase incomes in 
developing countries.
We have seen in this chapter that a strong economic case can be made for protecting the 
natural environment. Given existing market failures, especially those arising from externalities, 
government intervention is not only justiﬁed; it is necessary to achieve an efﬁcient outcome. 
Nature has signiﬁcant economic value, and techniques have been devised to measure these 
values. Despite common perceptions, environmental regulations are generally effective and 
do not harm economic vitality. Economic research suggests that we need more, not less, 
environmental regulation.
In Chapter 14, we turn to additional theoretical insights from economics on environmental 
management. We also focus on the issue of global climate change, one of the major challenges 
of the twenty-ﬁrst century.

APPENDIX: FORMAL ANALYSIS OF NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES
In this Appendix, we present a more formal analysis of negative externalities. The objective 
is to demonstrate that internalizing a negative externality using a Pigovian tax clearly makes 
society “better off,” based on an application of welfare analysis. Prior to the imposition 
of any tax on a product that generates a negative externality, social welfare includes three 
components:

314 
CHAPTER 13 — THE ECONOMICS OF THE ENVIRONMENT
1. consumer surplus
2. producer surplus
3. externality damages
Consumer and producer surplus are both positive contributions to social welfare, while 
the externality damages decrease welfare.
We refer to Figure 13.7 to determine each of these three effects. Figure 13.7 is essentially 
the same as Figure 13.1, with the addition of labels for various areas. You might also note 
that Figure 13.7 is very similar to Figure 12.5, which presented the welfare analysis of a tax. 
As some of the same concepts we learned in Chapter 12 are applicable here, the labels for 
various areas are the same in both ﬁgures.
Without any regulation, the market equilibrium is EM. Consumer surplus is the area above 
price but below the demand curve:
Consumer Surplus = A + B + E + H
Producer surplus at the market equilibrium QM is the area below price but above the 
supply curve:
Producer Surplus = C + D + F + G + I
As in Figure 13.1, the externality damages are represented by the shaded area between 
the private marginal costs and the social marginal costs, equal to:
Externality = E + F + G + H + I + K

Without a Pigovian tax, quantity will 
be QM and price will be PM, with 
the externality damage equal to the 
shaded region.
Because the externality represents a cost, to determine the net social welfare we need to 
subtract these costs from the market beneﬁts. Thus the net social welfare of the unregulated 
market is:
 
 
Net Beneﬁts = (A + B + E + H) + (C + D + F + G + I) − (E + F + G + H + I + K)
Canceling out the positive and negative terms, we are left with:
Net Beneﬁts = A + B + C + D − K

 
APPENDIX: FORMAL ANALYSIS OF NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES 
315
*Note that in Figure 12.5 tax revenues equaled area (B + C + E + F). However, this is exactly the same as area (E + 
F + G). We represent tax revenues differently here because we wish to demonstrate that the tax revenues are equal to the 
externality damages.
Now, we impose a Pigovian tax that fully internalizes the externality. This is shown in 
Figure 13.8, which is similar to Figure 13.2. We again need to determine the areas that 
represent consumer surplus, producer surplus, and the externality damage. But we also need 
to consider that tax revenues represent a beneﬁt to society, as we did in Chapter 12.
With the Pigovian tax, the new equilibrium is ETax, with a higher price of PTax and a lower 
quantity of QTax. At the higher price, consumer surplus is:
CS = A
As in Chapter 12, we can ﬁgure out producer surplus by ﬁrst realizing that total revenues 
equal price times quantity, or (PTax * QTax). In Figure 13.8, total revenues are:
Total Producer Revenues = B + C + D + E + F + G + J
Producers have two costs: the cost of production and the tax. The cost of production is the 
area under their marginal cost curve, which is area J. The tax per unit is equal to the difference 
between PTax and P0, which must be paid for every unit produced. Total taxes paid equal the 
shaded area in Figure 13.8, or*
Taxes = E + F + G

With a Pigovian tax, quantity falls to 
QTax and price rises to PTax, with the 
externality damage reduced to the 
shaded region.
When we subtract production costs and the tax paid from total revenues, we are left with 
producer surplus:
Producer Surplus = (B + C + D + E + F +G + J) − J − (E + F + G)
= B + C + D
Note that both consumer and producer surplus have decreased as a result of the Pigovian tax. 
If both consumer and producer surplus have gone down, how can it be that the tax increases 

316 
CHAPTER 13 — THE ECONOMICS OF THE ENVIRONMENT
social welfare? First, we need to account for the reduced pollution. With quantity reduced to 
QTax, the total externality damage is now the shaded area in Figure 13.8:
Externality = E + F + G
The externality damage associated with production between QTax and QM, or area (H + I + 
K), has been avoided. Note that the tax revenues exactly equal the externality damages—both 
are equal to (E + F + G).
Considering all welfare impacts, net social beneﬁts are now:
Net Beneﬁts = (A) + (B + C + D) + (E + F + G) – (E + F + G)
Canceling out the positive and negative terms we get:
Net Beneﬁts = A + B + C + D
How does this compare to net beneﬁts before the tax? Recall that beneﬁts were (A + B + C 
+ D − K). So beneﬁts have increased by area K as a result of the tax. Another way of looking 
at this is that we have avoided the negative impacts of “too much” production, represented 
by area K, which shows the excess of marginal costs (including external costs) over marginal 
beneﬁts. The level of production that maximizes social welfare is QTax.
Unlike our welfare analysis in Chapters 6 and 12, in the case of negative externality the 
unregulated market is inefﬁcient. Market intervention, in the form of a Pigovian tax, increases 
social welfare.

317
14 Common Property Resources and 
Public Goods
The theory of negative externalities, presented in Chapter 13, provides us with one impor-
tant way of thinking about environmental issues. In that approach, we start with the market 
equilibrium and examine ways of modifying it to take into account environmental costs 
and beneﬁts. But what if there is no market equilibrium, or even no market? This might 
be the case when social or environmental resources are not owned or ownership rights are 
not clear. In other cases, there may be a market equilibrium, but one that is highly distorted 
by failure to reﬂect crucial costs or beneﬁts of the resource in question. Some important 
examples are:
s  The oceans, which generally are not subject to private property rights and for the most 
part are not controlled by individual countries, except in coastal zones. The world’s oceans 
contain some of the most important planetary ecosystems. Healthy ﬁsheries are a critical 
source of food for the world’s population, supplying an important source of protein for 
many lower-income people.
s  Many forested areas and wetlands are not privately owned. They may be considered national 
assets or may be managed by local communities, but in many cases there may be no clear 
management rules.
s  The earth’s atmosphere is crucial to all of us but is owned by nobody. Atmospheric functions 
include the carbon cycle that supports both plant and animal life, climate stabilization, and 
parts of the water cycle—all crucial to planetary ecology. The issue of climate change has 
become particularly important in recent years, and is one that we will focus on later in this 
chapter.
s  At the national level, public parks, public beaches, river and lake ﬁsheries, and many recre-
ational areas are important aspects of social and economic life for which there is generally 
no established market.
s  A slightly different kind of example is public airwaves, which are often available for use 
by private companies under rules set by government.
This chapter provides further insights into economic policies concerning issues such as the 
public airwaves, ocean ﬁsheries, and climate change as well as other policy issues in related 
areas. We consider several new instances of market failure—where private markets fail to 
maximize social welfare. In each of these cases, we also suggest policy responses that can 
increase the well-being of society.
1. GOODS OTHER THAN PRIVATE GOODS
In the previous chapters, we discussed economic activities related to private goods. A private 
good can be deﬁned as having two distinguishing characteristics:

318 
CHAPTER 14 — COMMON PROPERTY RESOURCES AND PUBLIC GOODS
1. A private good is excludable. This means that owners of the good can prevent others 
from consuming it or enjoying its beneﬁts. For example, the textbooks that you own are 
excludable goods because, if you wish, you can prevent anyone else from using them. 
Generally, purchasing a private good establishes an owner’s legal right to exclude others 
from accessing the good. 
2. A private good is rival. This means that a unit of the good can be consumed by only one 
person at a time. So, if you are wearing a shirt, no one else can wear that shirt at the same 
time.
It will help us understand the concept of a private good if we contrast it with three other 
types of goods.
First, we can deﬁne a public good as one that is nonexcludable and nonrival. This means 
that no one can be excluded from consuming it because they did not pay for it and that more 
than one person at a time can enjoy its beneﬁts. An important economic result is that, because 
many people can simultaneously enjoy a nonrival good at the same time, the marginal cost 
of providing it to one more person is zero.
A common example of a public good is national defense—everyone in a country can 
simultaneously enjoy its beneﬁts, and none can be excluded. Another example is a national 
park, because it is freely available to everyone, and many people can enjoy it at the same 
time.*
Some people mistakenly consider any good “owned” or managed by a government a 
public good. But a natural reserve managed by an environmental group may also meet the 
qualiﬁcations of a public good, while some public resources may be managed by governments 
as private goods. An example would be a plot of public grazing land that is leased exclusively 
to the highest-bidding rancher.
Some goods, known as common property resources, are nonexcludable but rival. In other 
words, common property resources can be freely consumed or enjoyed by anyone, but their 
use by one person diminishes their availability to others. A classic example of a common 
property resource is the stock of ﬁsh in an open ocean ﬁshery. Anyone with a boat can catch 
as much ﬁsh as he or she is able to. However, a ﬁsh caught by one ﬁsher is not available to 
be caught by anyone else.
The concepts of common property resource and public good may overlap. We mentioned 
above that a national park can be considered a public good. But if the park becomes so 
crowded that the beneﬁts of each visitor start to decline, then we can say that the park no 
longer meets the strict deﬁnition of a nonrival good. In general, the availability or quality of 
a common property resource eventually declines when demands on it increase. But a public 
good remains available in undiminished quality despite increasing demands.
Finally, we have artiﬁcially scarce goods, which are excludable but nonrival.** In other 
words, artiﬁcially scarce goods can be simultaneously consumed by many people at a time, but 
those who do not pay can be excluded from enjoying the good. An example of an artiﬁcially 
scarce good is a toll road. Those who do not pay the toll can be excluded from using the road, 
but (at least up to a point) many people can simultaneously use the road.
So we can classify different goods into four basic categories as shown in Table 14.1, with 
examples for each type of good. These categories are not absolutely distinct; particular goods 
often display characteristics along a spectrum from rival to nonrival and from excludable 
to nonexcludable. Many goods are subject to congestion, meaning that they are nonrival 
if relatively few people use them at once, but when demand reaches a certain level each 
user’s beneﬁt begins to decrease due to crowding or scarcity. For example, a health club is 
private good: a 
good that is exclud-
able and rival
excludable good: 
a good whose con-
sumption by others 
can be prevented by 
its owner(s)
rival good: a good 
that can only be con-
sumed by only one 
person at a time
public good: a good 
that is nonexcludable 
and nonrival
nonexcludable 
good: a good whose 
beneﬁts are freely 
available to all users
nonrival good: a 
good that can be con-
sumed by more than 
one person at a time. 
The marginal cost of 
providing a nonrival 
good to an additional 
person is zero.
common property 
resource: a resource 
that is nonexcludable 
and rival
*Some national parks do charge a small entry fee, but these fees rarely present a signiﬁcant barrier for visitors. So, for 
practical purposes they are available for everyone’s enjoyment.
**Artiﬁcially scarce goods are also called club goods.

good: a good that 
is excludable but 
nonrival
congestion: the 
point at which the 
demand for a nonri-
val good results in a 
diminished beneﬁt to 
each user, and thus it 
becomes rival

 
ARTIFICIALLY SCARCE GOODS 
319
a nonrival good if only a few people are using it. But if the club becomes too crowded, it 
becomes more like a rival good.
Private goods are most often distributed through markets. This is also the case with 
artiﬁcially scarce goods—those who do not pay can be excluded from obtaining the good’s 
beneﬁts, so suppliers can charge a price to those who wish to consume or enjoy the good. 
But some artiﬁcially scarce goods, such as toll roads, are provided by governments without 
necessarily yielding a proﬁt.
Common property resources and public goods tend to be supplied or managed by 
governments. But other organizations can also provide goods or services that beneﬁt everyone, 
such as land conservation by environmental groups. Also, some resources may not be managed 
at all, such as a river with unregulated water withdrawals.
We have seen in other chapters that markets that provide private goods can suffer from 
market failure. For the other three types of goods in Table 14.1, distribution via private markets 
almost always results in market failure. In other words, private markets are generally inefﬁcient 
in the provision of artiﬁcially scarce goods, common property resources, and public goods. 
Thus market intervention is generally justiﬁed for these goods solely on the basis of economic 
efﬁciency. Intervention may also be justiﬁed on the basis of equity and other ﬁnal goals. We now 
turn to the economic theory and policy implications for each of these three types of goods.
Discussion Questions
1. In addition to the examples listed in Table 14.1, try to think of other instances of artiﬁcially 
scarce goods, common property resources, and public goods. Discuss how these goods 
are supplied—whether through markets, through government provision, or through other 
approaches.
2. Do you think that the current balance in your society among the four different types of 
goods is appropriate? Should policies be enacted to shift production so that, in general, 
society has more public goods and common property resources? Or should more goods 
be made available instead through private markets? Can you think of speciﬁc policies that 
could achieve the kinds of shifts that you would favor?
2. ARTIFICIALLY SCARCE GOODS
In a market for a private good, the efﬁcient level of provision occurs when the marginal ben-
eﬁts just equal the marginal costs, assuming no other market failures. But for an artiﬁcially 
scarce good, the marginal cost of providing it is zero, at least within a speciﬁc quantity range. 
For example, for homes equipped with cable television, the cost to the provider of sending 
the broadcast signal to one more household is essentially zero. Note that this does not mean 
that total production costs are zero. The start-up cost of a cable television company is quite 
high. Instead, what distinguishes an artiﬁcially scarce good from a private good is that its 
marginal supply costs are zero.

CHAPTER 14 — COMMON PROPERTY RESOURCES AND PUBLIC GOODS
Figure 14.1 illustrates the market for an artiﬁcially scarce good, cable television. The 
demand curve shows the maximum willingness to pay for different households in the region. 
Assume the cable television company charges $30 per month for a basic cable subscription. 
At this price, 80,000 households sign up for the service, as shown in the graph. The revenues 
of the cable company are $2.4 million per month ($30  80,000 households). The consumer 
surplus in the market is represented by the shaded region above the price but below the 
demand curve.
But you might note that something is missing from Figure 14.1—there is no supply curve! 
As the supply curve represents the marginal costs of providing the good, for an artiﬁcially 
scarce good, there is no supply curve. Or more precisely, the supply curve is a horizontal 
line at a price of zero.
So if we apply our rule that social welfare is maximized when the marginal beneﬁts are 
equal to the marginal costs, then the efﬁcient quantity of cable television is to provide it to all 
120,000 households that are willing to pay something for it. Note that if the cable company 
provided services at no cost to the 40,000 additional households that value it (but are not 
willing to pay $30/month), then total social welfare would increase by the triangle on the 
right-hand side of the graph.
Of course, the cable company will not do this. Proﬁt-making companies are rarely inclined 
to provide their goods and services for free. Note that the company could theoretically attract 
additional customers by charging them a monthly fee of less than $30/month. However, this 
requires that the company engage in price discrimination—a seller’s charging different 
prices to different buyers, depending on their ability and willingness to pay. So, while it would 
keep charging $30/month to most of its customers, the company might charge $10/month 
to other customers who have a lower willingness-to-pay. As the marginal cost of providing 
cable services is zero, the company’s proﬁts would increase nonetheless and those additional 
customers would obtain some consumer surplus.
This outcome is unlikely, because price discrimination is often illegal, and even where it 
is legal it is difﬁcult to implement. One common exception is college tuition. Students from 
households that are unable to pay the full tuition commonly receive ﬁnancial aid, so these 
students can obtain the same education at a lower cost. (Note that this is not a case in which 
the marginal cost of supply is zero—the reason for price discrimination in education is a 
matter of society’s ethical standards more than proﬁt-maximizing.)
The cable TV company in Figure 14.1 will seek to set its price to maximize its proﬁts, 
based on the elasticity of demand. However, this price will not result in a level of provision

The socially efﬁcient level of

are willing to pay for a

that maximizes social welfare. For this reason, government intervention sometimes occurs in 
markets for artiﬁcially scarce goods, which are often supplied by monopolies. Government 
regulation could require, for example, that a lower price be set or that special rates be made 
available to lower-income consumers. We discuss markets with monopoly suppliers and the 
role of government regulation in more detail in Chapter 18.
Discussion Questions
1. Do you think that price discrimination should be illegal? Does it make economic sense 
for everyone to pay the same price for something? Do you think that it is fair for everyone 
to pay the same price for something?
2. Do you think that the proﬁts of a company that provides cable television should be regulated 
by the government? Is competition in the cable industry sufﬁcient to keep prices reason-
able? How is technology changing the nature of competition for video programming?
3. COMMON PROPERTY RESOURCES
A common property resource is available to essentially anyone, but it cannot be used or en-
joyed by multiple people at the same time, at least with the same level of quality. Overuse is 
often a problem with a common property resource, as when too many people ﬁsh the same 
ﬁshery, want to play ball games in the same recreation area, or withdraw groundwater from 
the same aquifer. We can use tools of economic analysis to examine how this problems arises 
and what policy solutions may be available.
3.1 MODELING A COMMON PROPERTY RESOURCE
One way to model a common property resource is to realize that every user of the resource 
essentially imposes a cost on other users. In the example of a ﬁshery, if the number of ﬁshing 
trips is relatively low, adding one more trip is unlikely to affect the catch of other ﬁshers. But 
above a critical level, each additional ﬁshing trip begins to harm the overall health of the ﬁshery 
and thus reduce the catch of everyone in the ﬁshery. Each individual ﬁsher will consider only 
whether he or she is making a proﬁt. So, the fact that others’ proﬁts have declined will not be 
taken into account by additional ﬁshers. This is similar to the idea of a negative externality, 
but in this case market participants are harming other market participants.
Figure 14.2 models a ﬁshery as an example of a common property resource. The horizontal 
axis indicates the number of ﬁshing trips taken in the ﬁshery. Assume that it costs $15,000 to 
operate a ﬁshing trip, considering labor costs, boat payments, fuel, and other costs. This is 
the private cost of each ﬁshing trip, as shown by the PC line in the graph. Note that the cost 
to operate a ﬁshing trip is constant, regardless of the number of trips taken.
Next, we need to consider the revenue obtained from each ﬁshing trip. Obviously, this 
depends on the number of ﬁsh caught. For the ﬁrst few trips, we assume that each ﬁshing trip 
yields $25,000 in revenues per trip (see curve RT in the graph). When we subtract operating 
costs, each ﬁshing trip results in $10,000 in proﬁts.
Initially, plenty of ﬁsh are available for all ﬁshers, so each additional trip does not affect 
the catch of anyone else. Until T0, each ﬁsher is able to obtain revenues of $25,000 per trip. 
But after the number of trips exceeds T0, the revenue per trip begins to decline. The ﬁshery 
is becoming crowded, and because more ﬁshers are competing for limited ﬁsh stocks, it 
becomes more difﬁcult to catch ﬁsh. Each ﬁshing trip will still result in a proﬁt but, instead 
of making a $10,000 proﬁt, each trip will result in a lower proﬁt.
Each ﬁsher will obviously be disappointed to have lower proﬁts. But as long as proﬁts are 
still positive (RT > PC), there is an incentive for more ﬁshers to take trips to the area. In fact, 
as ﬁshers begin to realize declining catches, they may be motivated to increase their ﬁshing 
efforts further in order to catch ﬁsh while they still have the opportunity.

322 
CHAPTER 14 — COMMON PROPERTY RESOURCES AND PUBLIC GOODS
We can model the cost that additional ﬁshers impose on others much as we modeled a 
negative externality. It represents an additional cost above the private cost of operating a boat 
trip. Above T0, each additional trip imposes a social cost as shown by curve SC, equal to the 
reduction in the proﬁts of all other ﬁshers. In other words, SC represents the total social cost 
of operating a boat trip above T0, considering the out-of-pocket costs of $10,000 plus the 
external cost equal to the reduction in others’ proﬁts.
The socially efﬁcient level of ﬁshing trips is equal to T*. This is the level at which the 
proﬁts from a new ﬁshing trip are just enough to compensate the loss of others’ proﬁts.
But in an unregulated ﬁshery, there is no reason for ﬁshers to stop at T*. So long as 
individual ﬁshers can make proﬁt, the number of ﬁshing trips will continue to increase until 
we reach Te. At this point, proﬁt for each ﬁshing boat falls to 0. There will then be no further 
incentive for additional ﬁshing trips. But at such a high level of ﬁshing effort, the health of 
the ﬁshery may begin to decline. Over time, the stock of ﬁsh may become so depleted that 
the ﬁshery crashes, leading to the collapse of the local ﬁshing industry.
3.2 POLICIES FOR COMMON PROPERTY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
One solution to the problem of the overuse of a common property resource is much like 
the implementation of a Pigovian tax. We could charge a fee for each ﬁshing trip equal to 
the external cost imposed on others. If ﬁshers had to pay this fee in addition to their out-
of-pocket costs of $15,000, we could adjust the fee until we reached the efﬁcient level of 
ﬁshing trips, T*.
Another solution is to institute individual transferable quotas (ITQs). These operate much 
like tradable pollution permits, discussed in Chapter 13. With this approach, an organization 
managing the resource (such as a government agency) sets the total allowable ﬁshing level, 
such as the number of ﬁshing trips or the total harvest per season. This level of effort is set 
low enough to maintain the ecological integrity of the resource. The ITQs can be distributed 
for free or auctioned off to the highest bidders. If they are auctioned, the proceeds can be 
used by the government to maintain the quality of the resource or as compensation for those 
who are forced out of the industry. Holders of ITQs may then use them to ﬁsh or offer them 
for sale to interested parties. The price of an ITQ is not set by the government but allowed 
to vary depending on supply and demand. ITQ programs for ocean ﬁsheries have been 
established in several countries, including Australia, Canada, Iceland, and the United States. 
(For a real-world example of ITQs, see Box 14.1.)

PUBLIC GOODS 
323
Although ITQs or other regulations of a common property resource may not be popular 
with those who are used to accessing the resource for free, these policies are required to 
prevent the unsustainable use of the resource.
The overuse of a common property resource has famously been described as the “tragedy 
of the commons” (see Box 14.2), and it also can be viewed as a type of negative externality. 
Each user of the resource imposes a negative cost on others, yet makes decisions based solely 
on his or her own proﬁts. Just as in our externality analysis, the unregulated market outcome 
with a common property resource will be inefﬁcient.
Discussion Questions
1. Suppose that you and three roommates are living in an apartment or dorm suite with a 
common area for living, dining, and cooking. Do you think that a “tragedy of the com-
mons” outcome is a likely result without some rules regarding cleaning? What rules would 
you propose instituting?
2. Suppose that a small ﬁshing community in a developing country has been operating suc-
cessfully for centuries without any regulations. Each ﬁshing family owns a boat and makes 
a small proﬁt. However, suppose that climate change reduces the health of the ﬁsh stock, 
and the community is forced to reduce its overall ﬁshing activities. Should the community 
institute an auction system to allocate ﬁshing rights or begin charging a license fee? Can 
you think of a fair way to reduce the community’s ﬁshing activities?
4. PUBLIC GOODS
Public goods are at the opposite end of the spectrum from private goods. Public goods are 
both nonexcludable and nonrival. We saw examples of market failure with artiﬁcially scarce 
goods and common property resources. As you might expect, private markets fail to provide 
the efﬁcient level of public goods. In fact, even though many people value the beneﬁts of 
public goods, private markets often fail to provide any public goods at all.
In private market goods, the ability to charge a price acts as a way to exclude nonbuyers 
and thus make a proﬁt. Anyone can enjoy the beneﬁts of a public good without paying, and 
each additional user does not affect the amount or quality of the good available to others. 
Consider national defense as an example of a public good. Could we rely on a megacorporation 
BOX 14.1  FISHERIES MANAGEMENT IN PRACTICE: INDIVIDUAL TRANSFERABLE QUOTAS
One real-world example of regulating a fishery 
through individual transferable quotas is the Long 
Island clam ﬁshery. This example shows that the details 
of the quota system can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the ef-
ﬁciency of the industry.
The New York Department of Environmental 
Conservation allocates only 22 clam permits, which 
limit the total annual harvest to 300,000 bushels 
(about 13,600 bushels per permit). Based on 2011 
clam prices, the gross revenue potential of each permit 
was about $135,000.
However, clam ﬁshers claimed that after deducting 
operating costs, a single permit was insufﬁcient to 
make a living. The permits are transferrable, meaning 
that a single ﬁsher could purchase multiple permits. 
But the permit system initially required each permit 
to be associated with one boat. If you purchased a 
second permit then you would have to also operate 
a second boat, effectively doubling your operating 
costs. This requirement meant that efﬁciency gains 
from applying multiple permits to the same boat could 
not be realized.
In 2011 the state changed the law to allow “coop-
erative harvesting”—meaning that a ﬁsher could buy 
additional permits without having to operate more 
boats. Given that the total quota allocation remained 
at 300,000 bushels, the law change shouldn’t affect 
the health of the ﬁshery, but it offers the potential to 
increase the economic efﬁciency of the industry.

tragedy of the 
commons: a situa-
tion in which an un-
regulated common 
property resource is 
seriously degraded 
due to overuse

324 
CHAPTER 14 — COMMON PROPERTY RESOURCES AND PUBLIC GOODS
BOX 14.2  THE “TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS” DEBATE
The term “tragedy of the commons” comes from an 
inﬂuential paper written by ecologist Garrett Hardin in 
1968. Discussing the degradation of common grazing 
properties in England, Hardin wrote:
Picture a pasture open to all. It is to be expected 
that each herdsman will try to keep as many cattle 
as possible on the commons. Such an arrangement 
may work reasonably satisfactorily for centuries 
because tribal wars, poaching, and disease keep 
the numbers of both man and beast well below 
the carrying capacity of the land. Finally, however, 
comes the day of reckoning, that is, the day when 
the long-desired goal of social stability becomes a 
reality. At this point, the inherent logic of the com-
mons remorselessly generates tragedy.
 As a rational being, each herdsman seeks to 
maximize his gain. Explicitly or implicitly, more or 
less consciously, he asks, “What is the utility to me 
of adding one more animal to my herd?” This util-
ity has one negative and one positive component.
1. The positive component is a function of the 
increment of one animal. Since the herds-
man receives all the proceeds from the sale 
of the additional animal, the positive utility 
is nearly +1.
2. The negative component is a function of 
the additional overgrazing created by one 
more animal. Since, however, the effects of 
overgrazing are shared by all the herds-
men, the negative utility for any particular 
decision-making herdsman is only a fraction 
of [the shared negatives].
 Adding together the component partial utili-
ties, the rational herdsman concludes that the 
only sensible course for him to pursue is to add 
another animal to his herd. And another; and 
another. . . . But this is the conclusion reached 
by each and every rational herdsman sharing a 
commons. Therein is the tragedy. Each man is 
locked into a system that compels him to increase 
his herd without limit—in a world that is limited. 
(Hardin, 1968, p. 1244)
The “tragedy of the commons” essentially describes 
the fate of an “open-access resource”—one to which 
everyone has access without limitation or regulation. 
But there has often been confusion between the con-
cepts of common property and open access. Common 
property resources are not necessarily open-access 
resources; their use may be regulated, for example, 
by customs and traditional rules. 
The story told by Hardin was signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by 
the political scientist Elinor Ostrom, who won the Nobel 
Memorial Prize in economic science for work “showing 
how common resources—forests, ﬁsheries, oil ﬁelds or 
grazing lands—can be managed successfully by the 
people who use them, rather than by governments or 
private companies.” Ostrom’s point was that it was 
not just “tribal wars, poaching, and disease” that kept 
the system in balance. Instead, many societies have 
worked out institutional arrangements that operate 
with the same result as government regulations but that 
depend on social norms and customs instead of laws. 
In many parts of the world, such systems have endured 
for generations, sometimes centuries.
It is often the encroachment of market institutions 
on situations in which community management of 
common property has been successful that leads to 
degradation. As Hardin pointed out, when a com-
mon property resource exists within a market context, 
without any regulation by institutions of government or 
of society, there is an incentive at the individual level 
to keep using the resource as long as proﬁts can be 
made. But each individual fails to consider the cost he 
or she imposes on other users, and the likely outcome 
is the destruction of the resource. Thus in the case of an 
open-access resource, the unregulated market outcome 
is both inefﬁcient and ecologically unsustainable.

Science 162 (3859): 1243-1248, 1968; Elinor Ostrom, Govern-

to provide national defense in a market setting? Obviously not. No individual would have an 
incentive to pay because he or she could receive essentially the same level of beneﬁts without 
paying. Thus the “equilibrium” quantity of public goods in a market setting is normally zero, 
as no company would want to produce something for which no one is willing to pay. Clearly, 
this is an example of market failure.
Perhaps, we could rely on donations to supply public goods. This is done with some public 
goods, such as public radio and public television. Also, some environmental groups conserve 
habitats that, while privately owned, can be considered public goods because they are open for 

 
PUBLIC GOODS 
325
public enjoyment. Donations, however, generally are not sufﬁcient for an efﬁcient provision of 
public goods. Because public goods are nonexclusive, each person can receive the beneﬁts of 
public goods regardless of whether he or she pays. So although some people may be willing 
to donate money to public radio, many others simply listen to it without paying anything. 
Those who do not pay are called free riders.
It is obvious that a voluntary donation system would not work for the provision of many 
public goods, including national defense. Although we cannot rely on private markets or 
voluntary donations to supply public goods, their adequate supply is of crucial interest 
to the entire society. In democracies, decisions regarding the provision of public goods 
are commonly decided in the political arena. This is generally true of national defense. A 
political decision must be made, taking into account that some citizens may favor more 
defense spending and others less. After the decision is made, we all pay a share of the cost 
through taxes.
Similarly, decisions on the provision of environmental public goods may be made through 
the political system. Congress, for example, must decide on funding for the national park 
system. Will more land be acquired for parks? Might some existing park areas be sold or 
leased for development? In making decisions like this, we need some indication of the level 
of citizen demand for public goods. What insights can we gain from economic theory?
Recall that in Chapter 4 we referred to a demand curve as both a marginal beneﬁt curve 
and a willingness-to-pay curve. A consumer is willing to pay, say, as much as $30 for a t-shirt 
because that is his or her perceived beneﬁt from owning the shirt. But in the case of a public 
good, the marginal beneﬁts that someone obtains from a public good are not the same as his 
or her willingness to pay for it. In particular, the person’s willingness to pay is likely to be 
signiﬁcantly lower than his or her marginal beneﬁts.
A simple example illustrates this point. Consider a society with just two individuals: Doug 
and Sasha. Both individuals value forest preservation—a public good. Figure 14.3 shows the 
marginal beneﬁts that each person receives from the preservation of forest land. As in a regular 
demand curve, the marginal beneﬁts of each acre preserved decline with more preservation. We 
see that Doug receives greater marginal beneﬁts than Sasha does. This may be because Doug 
obtains more recreational use of forests, or it may simply reﬂect different preferences.
The social marginal beneﬁts from preserved forest land are obtained by the vertical addition 
of the two marginal beneﬁt curves. In the top graph in Figure 14.3, we see that Doug receives 
a marginal beneﬁt of $5 for an additional acre of forest preservation if 10 acres are already 
preserved. Sasha receives a marginal beneﬁt of only $2. The social, or aggregate, beneﬁts 
of an additional acre of preserved forest are $7, as shown in the bottom graph. The “social 
beneﬁts” graph represents the addition of the marginal beneﬁts to both Doug and Sasha. In 
this case, the aggregate curve is kinked (i.e., not straight) because to the right of the kink 
Sasha’s marginal beneﬁts are zero, and the curve showing the value of preserving additional 
acres reﬂects only Doug’s marginal beneﬁts.
Suppose for simplicity that forest preservation costs society a constant $7/acre for 
administrative and management costs. This is shown in the bottom graph in Figure 14.3. 
In this example, the optimal level of forest preservation is 10 acres—the point where the 
marginal social beneﬁts just equal the marginal costs.
But we have not addressed the question of how much Doug and Sasha are actually willing 
to pay for forest preservation. In the case of a public good, a person’s marginal beneﬁt curve 
is not the same as his or her willingness-to-pay curve. For example, although Doug receives 
a marginal beneﬁt of $5 for an acre of forest preservation, he has an incentive to be a free 
rider and he may be willing to pay only $3 or even nothing at all.
The problem is that we do not have a market in which people accurately indicate their 
preferences for public goods. Perhaps we could conduct a survey to collect information on 
how much people value certain public goods, but sometimes people do not provide accurate 
responses (recall our discussion of contingent valuation surveys in Chapter 13). Ultimately, 
free riders: those 
who obtain the ben-
eﬁts of a public good 
without paying any-
thing for it

326 
CHAPTER 14 — COMMON PROPERTY RESOURCES AND PUBLIC GOODS
decisions regarding public goods require some kind of social deliberation. One option is to 
rely on elected ofﬁcials to make public goods decisions for their constituents. Another is to 
rely on a democratic process such as direct voting or local town meetings.
Suppose that we correctly determine that the appropriate level of forest preservation in 
Figure 14.3 is 10 acres. At a marginal cost of $7/acre, we need to raise $70 in revenues to 
pay for preservation. We could tax Doug and Sasha $35 each to cover these costs. Doug 
receives at least $5 in beneﬁts for every acre preserved, or a total of at least $50 in beneﬁts, 
so he may not object to the $35 tax. However, Sasha receives signiﬁcantly lower beneﬁts, 
and she may view the tax as excessive.
Now, let us extend our two-person example to the entire population of the United States—
about 115 million households. If preferences in the general population are similar to Doug 
and Sasha’s, we will need to raise $35 multiplied by 115 million, or about $4 billion, for 
forest preservation in order to reﬂect its true social beneﬁts. This could be done with a tax 
of $35 per household. But, of course, marginal beneﬁts vary across households. It is clearly 
impractical to assess the actual marginal beneﬁt of each household. A society-wide decision 
must be made.
After this decision has been made, some people might think that they have to pay too much 
and others that the allocation of money for forest preservation is inadequate. But assessing 
a broad tax is essential for achieving the goal of forest preservation. Debates regarding 
efﬁciency and fairness in the case of public goods are thus inevitably both political and 
economic in nature.
Discussion Questions
1. Some people have suggested that certain public lands would be managed more efﬁciently if 
they were auctioned off to the highest bidders. In theory, the highest bidder would put the 
land to its highest-valued use. Employing a market valuation, that use might be logging or 
developing the land for vacation homes. Such an auction would provide the government 
with revenue, which could be used for socially beneﬁcial purposes or for lowering taxes. 
Do you think that some public lands should be sold to private interests?
2. Consider the provision levels of the following public goods in society: national defense, 
public education, environmental quality, and highways. Do you think that the current

“supply” of each of these goods is too high, too low, or about right? What factors do you 
think determine the amount of resources that are allocated toward each of these goods? 
Do policies need to be changed to adjust the allocation?
5. CLIMATE CHANGE
Global warming, sometimes more accurately described as climate change, has become a major 
issue in recent decades. The vast majority of scientists concur that global climate change is 
largely caused by human activity, in particular, the emission of atmospheric pollutants.* See 
Box 14.3 for more on the scientiﬁc opinion on climate change.
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a U.S. 
government agency, 2012 was the tenth-warmest year on record. More importantly, it marked 
the thirty-sixth consecutive year of above-average global temperatures.**
Climate change has signiﬁcant economic costs. According to NOAA’s National Climate 
Data Center, 11 severe weather events in 2012 in the United States cost the country $110 
billion. The two costliest events that year were Hurricane Sandy ($65 billion) and the yearlong 
drought across the country ($30 billion).1
Numerous projections conclude that these impacts will become more severe over time 
unless signiﬁcant steps are taken. In 2013 the managing director of the International Monetary 
BOX 14.3 THE SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS ON CLIMATE CHANGE
Although few dispute the ﬁnding that the world is be-
coming warmer, media reports commonly refer to the 
debate over the causes of this warming as ongoing. 
The global climate has varied considerably over time 
due to natural factors. Some people think the current 
warming represents just another natural variation, while 
others attribute the warming primarily to human factors, 
mainly the burning of fossil fuels. What is the unbiased 
scientiﬁc opinion on the causes of climate change?
Several articles have been published based on 
surveys of either the scientiﬁc literature on climate 
change or climate scientists themselves. In a 2004 
paper published in the highly respected journal 
Science, the abstracts of 928 articles on the topic of 
climate change were reviewed. Of these, 75 percent 
agreed with the “consensus position” that humans 
are causing climate change, and 25 percent dealt 
with methods or past climate change and thus took 
no position on current warming. But the author writes, 
“Remarkably, none of the papers disagreed with the 
consensus position.”
In a 2013 study climate researchers were directly 
asked whether their research supported or refuted the 
view that humans are affecting the climate. Of those 
who expressed an opinion, 97 percent supported the 
consensus position. The paper concludes that the 
“number of papers rejecting [the view that humans are 
impacting the climate] is a minuscule proportion of the 
published research.” The results of a larger survey of 
earth scientists, published in 2009, concluded:
It seems that the debate on the authenticity of 
global warming and the role played by human 
activity is largely nonexistent among those who 
understand the nuances and scientiﬁc basis of 
long-term climate processes. The challenge, 
rather, appears to be how to effectively communi-
cate this fact to policy makers and to a public that 
continues to mistakenly perceive debate among 
scientists.

Fund, Christine Lagarde, called climate change “the greatest economic challenge of the 
twenty-ﬁrst century.” She went on to say:
Make no mistake: without concerted action, the very future of our planet is in peril. So we 
need growth, but we also need green growth that respects environmental sustainability. 
Good ecology is good economics.2
A well-known 2006 report on climate change sponsored by the British government 
concluded:
Climate change presents a unique challenge for economics: it is the greatest and widest-
ranging market failure ever seen. . . . Our actions over the coming few decades could 
create risks of major disruption to economic and social activity, later in this century and 
in the next, on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic 
depression of the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century.3
Many of the principles discussed in this chapter and Chapter 13 are applicable to solving the 
challenge of climate change. But an adequate response to climate change is not simply a matter 
of instituting economic policies. It will also involve questions about fairness concerning rich 
and poor countries as well as different groups within countries. Other relevant issues concern 
how to act under uncertainty and how to deﬁne well-being, both now and in the future.
5.1 CLIMATE CHANGE DATA AND PROJECTIONS
Humans can inﬂuence the global climate by the emissions of various greenhouse gases. 
These gases act much like the glass in a greenhouse—allowing solar radiation to penetrate 
but then trapping it and increasing temperatures. Although various greenhouse gases exist 
naturally in the earth’s atmosphere and make life possible on earth, human activities have 
increased the concentration of many of these gases and introduced greenhouse gases into the 
atmosphere that do not occur naturally. The most relevant greenhouse gas emitted by humans 
is carbon dioxide (CO2), which is formed when fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) are 
burned. Other important greenhouse gases include methane, nitrous oxide, and chloroﬂuo-
rocarbons (CFCs).*
As shown in Figure 14.4, global emissions of CO2 have increased signiﬁcantly over the 
past couple of decades and are projected to increase a further 30 percent between 2015 and 
2035. We see that virtually all the increase in emissions in the coming decades will be a 
result of higher emissions in developing countries (i.e., those that are not members of the 
OECD). Most of the carbon emitted from human activities to date, however, has come from 
developed countries.
Further, CO2 emissions per capita are much higher in developed countries and will 
continue to be so for the foreseeable future. For example, annual emissions per capita are 
currently about 18 tons in the United States, 9 tons in Germany, 7 tons in China, 1.4 tons 
in India, and 0.3 tons in Kenya. This disparity in emissions per capita roughly reﬂects the 
global disparity in income. Any climate proposal that seeks broad international participation 
will need to allow the world’s poorest to increase their material living standards. Thus 
simply requiring all countries, say, to reduce emissions by 50 percent would reinforce 
current inequality.
CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions remain in the atmosphere for a long time, decades 
or even centuries. This means that even if we reduce annual emissions by 50 percent or more, 
total concentrations will continue to rise. The atmosphere can be viewed as a bathtub with a

that degradation of the ozone layer, while serious, is an issue almost entirely unrelated to global climate change.

very, very slow leak. As long as we keep adding more water (i.e., greenhouse gases) beyond 
a slight trickle to the bathtub, its level will continue to rise.
As atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases increase, the world is expected to 
become warmer, on average. Not all regions will warm equally, and some regions may actually 
become cooler. Warmer average temperatures increase evaporation, which in turn leads to more 
frequent precipitation, but again all regions will not be affected equally. In general, areas that 
are already wet will become wetter and dry areas will become drier. Climate change is also 
expected to result in more frequent and more intense tropical storms. The melting of polar 
ice caps and glaciers will contribute to rising sea levels. Sea levels are also rising because 
the volume of ocean water expands when it is heated.
Global average temperatures have already increased by about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees 
Fahrenheit) over the past several decades. At a 2009 international meeting on climate change 
in Copenhagen, Denmark, more than 130 countries agreed that it was necessary to limit the 
eventual warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius, based on the scientiﬁc consensus that 
warming above this level is likely to cause dangerous impacts.
Climate scientists have developed complex models to predict how much average 
temperatures will increase as CO2 concentrations increase. Because predicting long-term 
climate trends involves considerable uncertainty, these models have produced a range of 
potential outcomes. Adding to the uncertainty in models is the extent to which warming will 
be inﬂuenced by the policy decisions made in the next couple of decades.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established in 1988 by 
the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological 
Organization (WMO) under the United Nations to assess the science of climate change. 
A 2007 IPCC report estimated that temperatures will rise between 1.1 and 6.4 degrees 
Celsius in the twenty-ﬁrst century, with the most likely range between 1.8 and 4.0 degrees.4 
A 2009 analysis by researchers at MIT, however, predicted that, without signiﬁcant policy 
changes, warming would be much greater—in the range of 3.5 to 7.4 degrees Celsius.5 
Warming above 5 degrees is considered particularly dangerous, as 5 degrees represents the 
difference in global average temperatures between now and the last ice age. Such a large 
temperature change in a short period (although in the opposite directions) would cause 
signiﬁcant ecological impacts, such as the extinction of as much as 50 percent of the earth’s 
species according to one estimate.

CHAPTER 14 — COMMON PROPERTY RESOURCES AND PUBLIC GOODS
5.2 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
Strong policy action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could avoid the most damag-
ing effects of climate change. Scientists at the IPCC estimate that, rather than increasing as 
projected in Figure 14.4, global CO2 emissions must be reduced 50–80 percent by 2050. Of 
course, most countries are highly dependent on fossil fuels as an energy source. Transitioning 
to a low-carbon economy will require investment in energy efﬁciency and renewable energy 
technologies.
Various economic studies have analyzed climate change using the techniques of cost-
beneﬁt analysis, which was discussed in Chapter 13. Cost-beneﬁt analysis of climate change 
is particularly difﬁcult for two main reasons: the high degree of uncertainty about future 
impacts and the long period of the analysis. Most of the costs of responding to climate change 
are borne in the short term, while most of the beneﬁts (in terms of avoided damages) occur 
in the long term. Thus the choice of a discount rate is critical.
Virtually all economists agree that carbon emissions represent a negative externality and that 
a market-based policy such as a Pigovian tax or a tradable permit system should internalize 
this externality. However, there is a lively debate among economists about how aggressive 
such policies should be. Until recently, most economic studies of climate change suggested 
a relatively modest carbon tax, perhaps around $20–$40 per ton of carbon emitted (a $30 per 
ton tax on carbon would increase the price of gasoline by about 8 cents per gallon).
The economic debate over climate change changed signiﬁcantly in 2006 when Nicholas 
Stern, a former chief economist at the World Bank, released a 700-page report, sponsored by 
the British government, titled The Economics of Climate Change: The Stern Review. Publication 
of the “Stern Review” generated signiﬁcant media attention and has intensiﬁed the debate over 
climate change in policy and academic circles. Unlike previous studies, the  Executive Summary 
of the “Stern Review” strongly recommends immediate and substantial policy action:
The scientiﬁc evidence is now overwhelming: climate change is a serious global threat, 
and it demands an urgent global response. This Review has assessed a wide range of 
evidence on the impacts of climate change and on the economic costs, and has used a 
number of different techniques to assess costs and risks. From all these perspectives, 
the evidence gathered by the Review leads to a simple conclusion: the beneﬁts of strong 
and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting.
The “Stern Review” estimated that if humanity continues “business as usual,” the costs of 
climate change in the twenty-ﬁrst century would reach at least 5 percent of global GDP and 
could be as high as 20 percent. It also suggested the need for a much higher carbon tax—over 
$300 per ton of carbon.
What accounts for the difference between the “Stern Review” and most earlier analyses? 
The primary difference was that Stern applied a lower discount rate, 1.4 percent, compared 
to 4–5 percent in most other studies. Stern argued that his discount rate reﬂected the view 
that each generation should have approximately the same inherent value. Stern’s analysis also 
incorporated the precautionary principle (discussed in Chapter 13), in that he placed greater 
weight on the possibility of catastrophic damages.
5.3 CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY
Because climate change can be considered a very large environmental externality associ-
ated with carbon emissions, economic theory suggests a carbon tax as an economic policy 
response. Alternatively, a tradable permit system (also known as cap-and-trade) could be 
applied to carbon emissions.
As discussed in Chapter 13, a tax offers price certainty, while a tradable permit system 
offers emissions certainty. If you take the perspective that price certainty is important because 

 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
331
it allows for better long-term planning, then a carbon tax is preferable. If you believe that the 
relevant policy goal is to reduce carbon emissions by a speciﬁed amount with certainty, then 
a cap-and-trade approach is preferable, although it may lead to some price volatility.
Both approaches have been used. Carbon taxes have been instituted in several countries, 
including a nationwide tax on coal in India (about $1/ton, enacted in 2010), a tax on new 
vehicles based on their carbon emissions in South Africa (also enacted in 2010), a carbon tax 
on fuels in Costa Rica (enacted in 1997), and local carbon taxes in the Canadian provinces of 
Quebec, British Columbia, and Alberta that apply to large carbon emitters and motor fuels.
The European Union instituted a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions in 2005. The 
system covers more than 11,000 facilities that collectively are responsible for nearly half 
the EU’s carbon emissions. In 2012 the system was expanded to cover the aviation sector, 
including incoming ﬂights from outside the EU. The state of California instituted a cap-and-
trade system in 2013 for electrical utilities and large industrial facilities, with a goal of an 
annual decline in carbon emissions of 3 percent.
Regardless of which policy approach is taken, it must ultimately be applied at the 
international level. Each individual country has very little incentive for reducing its emissions 
if other countries do not agree to similar reductions. Action to reduce climate change can 
be regarded as a public good that also generates a positive externality. As we have noted, 
in the case of public goods, the problem of free riders means that they will not be provided 
effectively without collective action. In the case of stabilizing the health of a global public 
good such as the climate, international agreement is required.
The most comprehensive international agreement on climate change was the Kyoto 
Protocol, which was drafted in 1997. Under that treaty, industrialized countries agreed to 
emission reduction targets by 2012 compared to their baseline emissions, normally set to 1990 
levels. For example, the United States agreed to a 7 percent reduction, France to an 8 percent 
reduction, and Japan to a 6 percent reduction. Developing countries such as China and India 
were not bound to emissions targets under the treaty (an omission that drew objections from 
the United States and some other countries).
By 2012, 191 countries had signed and ratiﬁed the Kyoto Protocol. The United States 
was the only country that signed the treaty but never ratiﬁed it. In 2001, the George W. Bush 
administration rejected the Kyoto Protocol, arguing that negotiations had failed and that a 
new approach was necessary. Despite the U.S. withdrawal, the Kyoto Protocol entered into 
force in early 2005 after Russia ratiﬁed the treaty in November 2004.
Countries that have met their targets under the Kyoto Protocol include France, Germany, 
Russia, and the United Kingdom. Countries that have apparently failed to meet their targets 
include Canada, Australia, Spain, and Sweden. The overall Kyoto program target of a 5 percent 
reduction in industrialized country emissions was likely to be met based on preliminary data, 
but only because of very large reductions in Russia due largely to its economic collapse after 
the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991 rather than any deliberate policy.
Countries that failed to meet their targets are supposed to make up for it in the future, but 
attempts to create a successor to the Kyoto Protocol have so far been unsuccessful. Perhaps, 
the most contentious point of disagreement is still whether developing countries should be 
bound by mandatory cuts in emissions. Although some countries, particularly the United 
States, argue that all participants must agree to reductions in order to address the problem, 
developing countries contend that mandatory cuts would limit their economic development 
and reinforce existing global inequities.
A more radical approach, which treats the entire atmosphere as a common property 
resource, is described in Box 14.4. Although such a solution is politically highly unlikely, 
it indicates that the application of standard economic principles to dealing with common 
property resources and public goods could respond effectively to the problem of climate 
change as well as promote greater global equity.

Discussion Questions
1. How serious a problem do you think climate change is? Compare your judgment of this 
based on news reports and the economic studies that have tried to evaluate the costs and 
beneﬁts of climate change. How effective do you think economic analysis has been in 
approaching the problem?
2. Which policies do you think are most likely to be effective in responding to climate change? 
Given the political resistance to taxes, what do you think would be the best strategy for 
achieving reduction of greenhouse gas emissions?
BOX 14.4 AN EARTH ATMOSPHERIC TRUST
The global atmosphere is a common property resource 
with respect to carbon emissions. For the most part, 
anyone can emit carbon into the atmosphere without 
cost. The apparent outcome is the largest example 
of the tragedy of the commons that the world has 
ever seen.
A common property resource is essentially equally 
“owned” by all with access to it. As a global resource, 
the atmosphere can be viewed as something to which 
all people on earth have an equal right. This principle 
forms the basis for perhaps the most innovative and 
comprehensive policy approach to reducing carbon 
emissions, called an Earth Atmospheric Trust.
The program would establish a global cap-and-
trade system for carbon emissions. The cap would 
be established to prevent damaging climate change, 
based on the best available scientiﬁc evidence. All 
permits would be auctioned off to the highest bid-
ders, such as electricity plants, industrial facilities, 
and transportation companies. The cost of permits 
would ultimately be reﬂected as higher prices to 
consumers.
A global auction system would yield signiﬁcant rev-
enues, about $1 trillion–$4 trillion annually depending 
on the price of permits. Some of this money (the Earth 
Atmospheric Trust) would be used to invest in low-
carbon technologies, fund adaption measures, and 
restore ecological damage. The remainder, perhaps 
half or more, would be distributed to all people on 
earth as an equal per-capita annual payment. This 
reﬂects the concept of equal “ownership” of the at-
mosphere, such that everyone is equally compensated 
for the damage done to the resource.
Of course, the logistics of distributing an annual pay-
ment to all people on the planet are currently daunting, 
but the principle is supported by standard economic 
theory. The annual payment would amount to about 
$300 per person per year. In rich countries, the payment 
would partially, but not totally, offset higher prices for 
goods such as electricity and gasoline. In poor coun-
tries, the payment would reﬂect a substantial increase 
in annual incomes. Consider that about a billion people 
currently live on $1 or less per day. Thus in addition to 
limiting carbon emissions, the Trust would signiﬁcantly 
reduce abject poverty in the world.

15 Capital Stocks and Resource 
Maintenance
Economics is about how people manage their resources. All economic actors—businesses, 
governments, nonproﬁt organizations, and each of us as individuals—have to make decisions 
every day about how to use (or not use) our resources. In managing your ﬁnancial resources, 
you choose how to allocate your money between food, entertainment, books, and many 
other things. Companies decide how to use their workers and physical resources to produce 
efﬁciently. Governments must allocate tax revenues among many competing needs. As a 
society, we are faced with choices about how to use our natural resources and how much to 
save for the future.
In this ﬁnal section of the book, we focus on how we manage our resources and use them to 
produce goods and services, generally for sale in markets. We saw in Chapter 1 that production 
decisions always involve tradeoffs—recall our discussion of the production-possibilities 
frontier. Producing more of one thing requires us to give up something in return. We can also 
think of tradeoffs over time. Using up a critical natural resource now may increase current 
production, but lead to reduced opportunities in the future. Thus the activity of resource 
maintenance goes hand-in-hand with production decisions.
In this chapter, we focus on the different types of resources available to society, from 
manufacturing equipment to credit worthiness, from oil reserves to human knowledge. We 
see how we can track the availability of resources over time. The importance of each type 
of resource is discussed. We end with a discussion about the sustainable management of 
resources.
1. CAPITAL STOCKS
As you have probably learned by now, sometimes economists speak a slightly different lan-
guage from most people. Let’s consider how most people deﬁne the following words:
s  Capital: This commonly refers to something to do with ﬁnance, such as “capital markets” 
or “venture capital.”
s  Stocks: This commonly refers to ownership shares in companies, which are traded in “stock 
markets.”
s  Investment: This commonly refers to activity such as buying stocks or “investing” in a 
retirement account.
To an economist, these terms mean slightly different things. The economist’s deﬁnition of 
capital includes not only ﬁnancial resources, but any resource that is valued for its potential 
economic contributions. Money is one type of capital, but other types of capital include a 
factory, a highway, a natural gas ﬁeld, or a farm. Capital does not even need to be something 
physical. The knowledge that you are gaining from your education is a form of capital. So, 
capital: any resource 
that is valued for its 
potential economic 
contributions

338 
CHAPTER 15 — CAPITAL STOCKS AND RESOURCE MAINTENANCE
too, are systems of laws and customs that facilitate economic activities. Below we will deﬁne 
the main different types of capital.
To an economist, a stock refers to the quantity of something at a particular point in time. 
For example, the amount of water currently in a bathtub is a stock, as is the amount of money 
in your checking account on January 1. The number of hairs on your head right now is a 
stock. In this chapter, we often focus on the stock of a particular capital resource, such as the 
stock of oil reserves or the stock of a species of ﬁsh in a lake. Stocks of capital may increase 
or decrease as a consequence of natural forces, as in the case of a natural forest, or they may 
be deliberately managed by humans to provide the inputs for production.
Finally, economists view investment as any activity intended to increase the quantity 
or quality of a resource over time. In other words, investment is designed to result in the 
growth of capital stocks. An employee who puts funds into her individual retirement account 
(IRA) is investing in the stock of ﬁnancial assets that she will draw on in the future. So is 
the business that trains its workers, the subsistence farmer who sets aside seeds for his next 
planting season, and the community that works to clean up its air and water. The economic 
activity of resource maintenance can be viewed as investment, leading to greater production 
possibilities in the future.
1.1 STOCKS VERSUS FLOWS
Capital stocks can increase over time, with proper investment, or decrease if they are simply 
used up. While the stock of something is measured at a single point in time, a ﬂow is measured 
over a period of time. An obvious example is the amount of water ﬂowing into a bathtub. 
We could speak of the amount of water ﬂowing into the tub per minute, per hour, or another 
time interval. The ﬂow of new tools into a warehouse, and the ﬂow of tools out of it as they 
are sold, can be measured over the day or week. The number of haircuts that you had in the 
previous year is a ﬂow of services. (Note that it is impossible to keep a stock of haircuts in a 
warehouse. Flows can be of either goods or services, but stocks can only be goods.)
Flows can either add to capital stocks or decrease them. Figure 15.1 presents a stock-ﬂow 
diagram, which shows how ﬂows change the level of a stock over time, by either adding to it 
or subtracting from it. Some of the stocks in Figure 15.1 carry over, meaning that they are still 
there in the next period. In this ﬁgure, the new stock is larger than the initial stock, because 
the additions are greater than the subtractions (represented by the thickness of arrows).
Figure 15.2 provides a speciﬁc example of a stock-ﬂow diagram using a bank account as 
an example. Suppose that you start the month with exactly $1,400 in your checking account. 
This is your initial stock. During the month, the ﬂows into your checking account include $700 
from your job, $50 from someone who owed you money, and $5 in interest on the account, for 
a total of $755. Note that this is a ﬂow that represents an addition to your stock over time.

The ﬂows out of your account over the month include $600 for rent and $325 in other 
expenses, for a total of $925. Thus your new bank account balance at the end of the month 
(i.e., your stock of money on that day) is $1,230. Your balance has declined over the month 
because the ﬂows out of your account were greater than the ﬂows into it.
1.2 THE FIVE TYPES OF CAPITAL
Capital can be classiﬁed into ﬁve basic categories:
1. natural capital
2. manufactured (or produced) capital
3. human capital
4. social capital
5. ﬁnancial capital
Natural capital consists of physical assets provided by nature, such as land that is suitable 
for agriculture or other human uses, sources of fresh water, and stocks of minerals and 
fossil fuels (such as crude oil or coal) that are still in the ground. Manufactured capital is 
physical assets that are produced by humans using natural capital. These include such things 
as buildings, machinery, stocks of reﬁned oil, and inventories of produced goods that are 
waiting to be sold.
Human capital is the capacity of people to engage in productive activities. Speciﬁcally, 
it includes the knowledge and skills that each person can bring to his or her work as well as 
the physical and mental health that allows people to make use of their knowledge and skills. 
Social capital is the stock of relationships among people that facilitates economic activities, 
including shared norms, values, and trust. For example, when you buy something on eBay, 
you trust that the seller will actually send you the item that you purchased after you pay for 
it, based on a mutual understanding of how an eBay transaction works.
Financial capital consists of resources that can be used to purchase goods and services. 
Money, either cash or bank accounts, is probably the most common form of ﬁnancial capital, 
but it can also include assets such as stocks and bonds and one’s ability to borrow in the 
form of loans or credit cards. Although ﬁnancial capital does not directly produce anything, 
it contributes to production by making it possible for people to produce goods and services 
in advance of getting paid for them.
Capital can be classiﬁed as being either in physical or intangible forms (some capital can 
be both). Capital takes the form of physical capital when it can be touched or seen. Natural 
capital is primarily physical in form. Anything that we produce or use in the physical world 
either comes directly from a natural capital stock—as a fruit is picked from a wild tree—or

has been transformed from its original, natural form. Even such human inventions as plastics, 
microchips, and advanced medicines are all made out of something physical that was at one 
time a part of the stock of natural capital.
Intangible capital, which cannot be seen or touched, is less visible but no less important. 
Some human capital, such as knowledge about economics or biophysics or Chinese art, is 
a purely intangible type of capital. Social capital is also commonly intangible, such as the 
trust between a buyer and seller. But many forms of physical capital can also be viewed as a 
representation of intangible capital. A DVD, for example, is a physical object, but its true value 
lies in the information and entertainment that it can provide. Even a machine can be viewed 
as not only a hunk of physical metal but also the embodiment of intangible knowledge and 
software. Paper money is more than just physical paper because it also represents intangible, 
socially created trust that it can be used in payment.
Discussion Questions
1. Linda thinks that a rich person is someone who earns a lot of money. Meng thinks that 
a rich person is someone who has a big house and owns lots of stocks and bonds. How 
would the distinction between stocks and ﬂows lend clarity to their discussion?
2. Think of a common activity that you enjoy. For example, perhaps you like to get together 
with friends and listen to music while making popcorn in the microwave. List the stocks 
of natural, manufactured, human, ﬁnancial, and social capital on which you draw when 
engaging in this activity.
2. NATURAL CAPITAL
Natural capital forms the basis for all life on earth. Yet it is less obvious that natural capital 
is crucial to all economic activity. Sometimes, it is easy to forget that everything we see 
around us—computers, books, cars, buildings—can all be traced back to a natural capital 
origin. As human economic activity has increased, our demands on natural capital have also 
increased. Whether natural resources will be sufﬁcient to meet human demands in the future 
has become a question of considerable debate. Moreover, some forms of natural capital are 
becoming degraded or fundamentally changed due to human activities, such as the changes 
in the global climate that we discussed in Chapter 14.
2.1 RENEWABLE AND NONRENEWABLE NATURAL CAPITAL
Different kinds of natural capital can be classiﬁed according to whether they are renewable. 
A renewable resource regenerates through biological or other short-term processes, which 
may be helped by human activity. The quantity and quality of its stock depend simultaneously 
on the rate at which the stock regenerates or renews and on the rate at which it is harvested 
or polluted. A healthy forest will go on indeﬁnitely producing trees that may be harvested, 
yielding a ﬂow of lumber that will be used up in production processes such as papermaking. 
(For more on the management of renewable natural capital stocks, see Box 15.1.)
Other kinds of natural capital are nonrenewable resources. Their supply is ﬁxed, although 
new discoveries can increase the stock that is known to be available. For example, there is a 
ﬁnite amount of oil reserves, and a ﬁnite amount of each kind of mineral, available on earth. 
Although these resources were created over a very long period spanning millions of years, 
they are considered nonrenewable on a human time scale. Nonrenewable resources do not 
have self-regenerating ﬂows, and the stock can only diminish over time as a result of human 
use or natural deterioration, as illustrated in Figure 15.3.
How much of its stock of natural resources a society chooses to use as inputs into current 
production, rather than to preserve for the future, is clearly a very important economic 
question. In addition to any carryover, the initial stock of a renewable resource is able

BOX 15.1 RENEWABLE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: FISHERY STOCKS
Since 1971 the Food and Agriculture Organization 
(FAO) of the United Nations (UN) has published 
reports on the status of the world’s ocean ﬁsheries. 
The FAO classiﬁes ﬁshery stocks into three categories, 
based on the relationship between actual harvest 
levels and the “maximum sustainable yield,” which 
is the harvest level that equals the rate of natural re-
generation of the stock. The three FAO ﬁshery stock 
categories are:
1.  qvÕÞÊiÝ«Ìi`\ stocks with harvest levels 
below the maximum sustainable yield; harvest 
levels can be potentially increased without 
harming the ﬁshing stock
2. ÕÞÊiÝ«Ìi`\ stocks with harvest levels at or 
near the maximum sustainable yield; harvest 
levels cannot be increased any further without 
harming the ﬁshing stock
3. "ÛiÀiÝ«Ìi`\ stocks with harvest levels al-
ready above the maximum sustainable yield; 
harvest levels need to be reduced in order to 
preserve the health of the ﬁshing stock
According to the FAO, in 2009 57 percent of the 
world’s ﬁshery stocks were considered fully exploited, 
a percentage that has not signiﬁcantly changed since 
the 1970s. About 30 percent of ﬁshery stocks in 
2009 were classiﬁed as overexploited, compared to 
only about 10 percent in the 1970s. Meanwhile, the 
percentage of stocks classiﬁed as non–fully exploited 
decreased from about 40 percent in the 1970s to only 
13 percent in 2009.
These results suggest that about 87 percent of the 
world’s ﬁshery stocks are already being ﬁshed at or 
above their natural limits. For the 13 percent of stocks 
that are not being fully exploited, the FAO notes that 
these stocks generally have a low production potential 
and that the “potential for increase in catch may be 
generally limited.” The FAO also mentions that the 
increase in overﬁshed stocks is a cause for concern. 
It indicates that, at the global level, the UN targets for 
rebuilding the overﬁshed stocks and implementing an 
ecosystem approach are not being met.
The FAO concludes that careful ﬁsheries manage-
ment is needed to restore overexploited stocks to 
ecological health and to ensure that fully exploited 
stocks are not overﬁshed.

Nations, “Review of the State of the World Marine Fishery

to regenerate and thus contribute to greater stocks in the future, as illustrated in Figure 
15.4. But natural inputs that are renewable—such as lumber from forests and ﬁsh from 
the seas—can be exhausted if so much of them are destroyed or extracted that they can no 
longer renew themselves.
In addition, nature’s ability to absorb pollution and break down waste is limited, and there 
are tipping points beyond which degraded natural capital may be dramatically altered in some 
essential respect. As we saw with climate change, dramatic ecological change may occur over 
the next several decades, including the extinction of numerous species. It is very difﬁcult to 
predict whether ecosystems will be sustainable in the face of such dramatic changes. Rising

sea levels could cause the ﬂooding of many low-lying areas; New Orleans and southern 
Florida, in the United States, and Bangladesh are examples, but many cities worldwide are 
in low-lying areas close to oceans. Some island countries are already losing signiﬁcant land 
mass. Resource maintenance for natural capital means tracking the size, quality, and changes 
in natural resources and making wise decisions about their management.
2.2 NATURAL CAPITAL AND SUSTAINABILITY
Production and consumption levels in modern societies, particularly in industrialized coun-
tries, may be leading to the depletion of important natural capital stocks. Thus it becomes 
important to determine the extent of possible substitutability of resources. That is, the deple-
tion of any one resource (e.g., fossil fuels) is a less serious problem for future generations if 
other resources (such as nuclear or solar energy) can be cheaply and safely substituted for it. 
The extent of substitutability that can be achieved depends both on the characteristics of the 
resources and on the speed of technological advance.
A sustainable socioeconomic system is one that maintains its resources such that at least 
the same level of social well-being can be maintained over time. For renewable resources, 
this generally means that rates of depletion and use do not exceed natural regeneration rates. 
Ecological impacts are kept safely below critical levels to ensure ecosystem stability. For 
nonrenewable resources, depletion rates are kept to a minimum and adequate investment is 
made to develop renewable substitutes. It is important to identify critical natural resources, 
for which substitution may be difﬁcult if not impossible.
Discussion Questions
1. Give three examples of renewable natural capital. Give three examples of nonrenewable 
natural capital. (Do not duplicate examples given in the text.)
2. Do you think that a cheap and safe substitute for the use of fossil fuels in cars will ever be 
found? Discuss. (Note that the electricity for electric cars is currently generated primarily 
by fossil fuels.)
3. MANUFACTURED CAPITAL
The stock of manufactured capital is the stock of physical things produced by human beings, 
which in turn are used to produce other goods. In modern societies, manufactured capital 
includes such things as roads, factories, communication systems, buildings, machinery, and 
computers. The major form of manufactured capital is ﬁxed manufactured capital. Inventories 
are another form of manufactured capital. We turn now to a discussion of these two types of 
manufactured capital.

MANUFACTURED CAPITAL 
343
3.1 FIXED MANUFACTURED CAPITAL
Most of what we consider manufactured capital is in the form of ﬁxed manufactured capital, 
which is designed to supply a ﬂow of productive services over an extended period. When 
economists speak of “capital” as an input to production, what they usually mean is that stocks 
of manufactured capital, such as tools, machines, buildings, and infrastructure, yield ﬂows of 
services, such as making it possible to dig or drill more rapidly, expediting communications 
and transportation or giving shelter. The ﬁxed manufactured capital stocks themselves are 
not used up during the production process (aside from normal wear and tear), nor do they 
become part of the product itself.
If you ﬁnd the distinction between stocks and ﬂows confusing, consider the example of 
a tax accountant renting an ofﬁce from a real estate ﬁrm. The stock of manufactured capital 
here—the physical ofﬁce itself—belongs to the real estate ﬁrm, but the service arising 
from the use of the ofﬁce space is an input ﬂow into the production of services to the tax 
account’s clients. Similarly, when truckers drive along a highway, they are using the services 
of the government-provided physical road. The actual physical ofﬁce and the road are not in 
themselves inputs into production—they do not get used up or converted into something else 
on the way to creating new goods and services. Only the ﬂow of services yielded by these 
capital goods can properly be referred to as inputs.
The stock of ﬁxed manufactured capital is increased when people decide to make physical 
investments—that is, to build or improve productive assets. Although ﬁxed manufactured 
capital is not directly used up in the process of production, physical assets commonly lose 
their usefulness over time, as computers become obsolete, roads develop potholes, and 
equipment breaks. Commonly, these losses are referred to as depreciation of the manufactured 
capital stock. Resource maintenance activities for ﬁxed manufactured capital include all the 
checking, cleaning, protection, and repair activities needed to keep buildings, machines, and 
other manufactured capital in good working order.
A society’s stock of manufactured capital is dependent upon its technology. For example, a 
plow pulled by an ox and a modern tractor are both manufactured capital, but they incorporate 
very different technologies. In a way, manufactured capital can be viewed as an embodied 
form of human capital, representing accumulated human knowledge and innovation. Thus 
investment in human capital tends to yield beneﬁts in terms of improved manufactured 
capital stocks.  
3.2 INVENTORIES
A smaller amount of manufactured capital exists in the form of inventories. Inventories are 
stocks of raw materials or produced goods that are not currently being used or sold but are 
expected to be used or sold in the foreseeable future.
Like other forms of capital, inventories contribute to production. For example, you cannot 
start baking bread until you have accumulated a stock of ﬂour, nor can you provide retail 
services selling shoes until you have an inventory of shoes. Also like other forms of capital, 
inventories are valuable assets. If you were to sell your shoe store, the value of your stock of 
salable shoes would be ﬁgured into the sale price of the business. But unlike ﬁxed manufactured 
capital, inventories are generally meant to be used up relatively quickly or to become part of 
another product, rather than to provide a ﬂow of services over an extended period.
Recall the deﬁnition of a stock as something measured at a point in time. Imagine 
that at one single moment we could freeze all useful manufactured goods where they 
are—including those in warehouses and on shelves—and make a long list. Everything 
on the list that is not ﬁxed manufactured capital would be counted, at that moment, 
as inventory manufactured capital. (If we unfreeze those goods, however, we see that 
inventories are constantly being added to and drawn down, as stocks of materials are 
used up and goods are sold.)
ﬁxed manufac-
tured capital: manu-
factured goods that 
yield a ﬂow of pro-
ductive services over 
an extended period 
depreciation: de-
crease in the useful-
ness of a stock of cap-
ital due to wear and 
tear or obsolescence
inventories: stocks 
of raw materials or 
manufactured goods 
being stored until 
they can be used or 
sold

CHAPTER 15 — CAPITAL STOCKS AND RESOURCE MAINTENANCE
3.3 MANUFACTURED CAPITAL IN THE CORE AND PUBLIC PURPOSE SPHERES
When we think of manufactured capital as the stock of physical assets that provide inputs to 
productive activities, it is important to remember that productive activities take place in all 
spheres. Sometimes, economists discuss manufactured capital largely in terms of business 
investment, ignoring the manufactured capital stocks that have accumulated in the core and 
public purpose spheres. For example, economists have traditionally viewed a stove purchased 
by a restaurant as an investment in manufactured capital. But exactly the same stove purchased 
by a household would normally be classiﬁed as “consumption” rather than a productive in-
vestment (unless the household used the stove to cook meals for sale). 
To account fully for the productive capacity of an economy, some economists suggest 
that manufactured capital should be accounted for in similar ways, no matter who holds it. 
Production by households, neighborhoods, nonproﬁts, and governments depends on stocks 
of manufactured capital, just as much as production by businesses does.
Discussion Questions
1. Come up with one new example of each of the following: ﬁxed manufactured capital, 
inventory, investment, depreciation.
2. In the early twentieth century, photos or drawings of big factories with tall stacks belching 
smoke were popularly used to represent the productivity of the contemporary economy. 
What images come to mind now, when you think of economic activity in the early twenty-
ﬁrst century?
4. HUMAN CAPITAL
Human bodies are amazing machines that have evolved to survive in a wide variety of condi-
tions, from arctic cold to tropical heat. We are extremely adept at endurance activities. For 
example, over long distances human runners can outpace almost any other animal, including 
dogs, horses, and cheetahs.* But the most remarkable evolutionary achievement of humans 
is our large and complex brain. No one can claim to have yet explored the full potential for 
human creativity and innovation.
Our human capital includes both our physical capacity for exertion and our mental capacity 
for productive application of our knowledge and skills. Such individual productive capabilities 
must be created and enhanced through nurturance, nutrition, education, training, and other 
aspects of life experience.
The raw quantity of human capital in an economy might be crudely measured in terms 
of the number of people in its population who are of normal working age. To attempt to 
measure its quality, measures of health status or of years of schooling achieved might also be 
considered. As with the various kinds of physical capital, we can think of human capital as 
a stock of capabilities, which can yield a ﬂow of services. Economists often view “labor” as 
the ﬂow of effort, skill, and knowledge that humans directly provide as inputs into productive 
activities. Because it is a ﬂow, labor is usually measured over a period of time, such as by 
the number of person-hours of work of a particular skill that has been used in the course of 
a week or month.
4.1 PHYSICAL HUMAN CAPITAL
Human capital can take physical and intangible forms. In physical form, humans operate much 
like a manufactured machine—requiring energy inputs to produce physical work. Manual 
*Since 1980 an annual “horse versus human” marathon race has been held in Wales, UK. Although a horse with a rider is 
normally the winner, a couple of times the winner was human.

 
HUMAN CAPITAL 
345
labor, for example, taps human physical energy, just as another productive process might tap 
a stock of fossil fuel. Thus the term “human capital” is based on an analogy between a hu-
man being and a manufactured machine. Although some people ﬁnd this analogy offensive, 
others ﬁnd it a useful way of analyzing an important input to production—as long as it does 
not lead to treating human beings as though they really were machines!
Health, strength, and ﬁtness are important forms of physical human capital. In circumstances 
of deprivation, in which some workers perform below their potential because they are 
weakened by hunger or illness, basic nutrition and medical care can be seen as important 
ways of investing in human capital as well as direct contributions to well-being. This is 
particularly true in the case of children, whose future capabilities can be permanently stunted 
by deprivation at critical times. (See Box 15.2 for more on this issue.)
BOX 15.2 NUTRITION AND SCHOOL PERFORMANCE
A growing body of scientiﬁc evidence demonstrates 
the importance of good nutrition for children’s devel-
opment and school performance. A 1998 research 
project at Tufts University found that:
Recent research provides compelling evidence that 
undernutrition during any period of childhood can 
have detrimental effects on the cognitive develop-
ment of children and their later productivity as 
adults. In ways not previously known, undernutri-
tion impacts the behavior of children, their school 
performance, and their overall cognitive develop-
ment. These ﬁndings are extremely sobering in 
light of the existence of hunger among millions 
of American children.
Research on nutrition and education has especially 
focused on breakfast. According to Leia Kedem, a 
University of Illinois Extension nutrition and wellness 
educator:
Although any breakfast is better than no breakfast, 
making the extra effort to make it healthy might 
help your kids do better in school. Studies show 
that kids who eat a balanced breakfast have higher 
test scores and can concentrate better and solve 
problems more easily in class. The nutritional value 
of meals can also make a difference. A breakfast 
low in ﬁber and protein, like sugary toaster pastries, 
can lead to a midmorning energy crash. This is be-
cause the carbohydrates are digested and absorbed 
quickly, causing blood sugar levels to dive after an 
initial spike. Other than sudden fatigue, kids may 
also experience headaches and irritability.
Beyond just breakfast, overall diet sufﬁciency and 
quality are also related to academic performance. 
A 2008 study in Canada concluded that intake of 
fruit and vegetables were positively correlated with 
school performance, while fat intake was negatively 
correlated. The research validates the “importance 
of children’s nutrition not only at breakfast but also 
throughout the day,” with a recommendation for 
greater investment in school nutrition programs.

4.2 INTANGIBLE HUMAN CAPITAL
The dramatic rise in living standards since the Industrial Revolution started in the eighteenth 
century rests more than anything else on the remarkable rise in output of the average worker. 
This increase in productivity is based not on an increase in the human capacity for physical 
labor but on how technological innovations have been applied to productive processes. Some-
times, these innovations involved new ways of using the energy stored in natural resources, 
such as the use of coal to move trains and generate electricity. At other times, these innova-
tions involved creating machines to perform tasks much more efﬁciently than was possible 
solely through human physical or mental effort. For example, computers are able to perform 
tasks in nanoseconds that would take a human a lifetime of work.

346 
CHAPTER 15 — CAPITAL STOCKS AND RESOURCE MAINTENANCE
The development of such technologies makes it evident that the continuing increase in human 
productivity does not depend only on physical capital and sheer human effort. It also depends on 
intangible kinds of capital, including the knowledge, skills, and habits embodied in individuals.
Formal education, along with less formal ways of acquiring skills (e.g., early childhood 
education in homes and knowledge gained from on-the-job experience) are important 
contributors to human capital. As you read this paragraph, you are investing in your own 
human capital, in the form of an economics education.
Clearly, human capital has a way of accumulating over time. Scientiﬁc research is one good 
example of this. Scientists generally build upon the knowledge produced by previous scientists. 
Again, this accumulation of knowledge can be embodied in manufactured capital, indicating 
technological progress. For example, a worker at an automobile company may start with an 
existing engine design, and develop a new technique to make that engine more fuel efﬁcient. 
Discussion Questions
1. In what ways is it useful to think of human bodies and brains as if they were like produc-
tive machinery? What might be some drawbacks of this way of thinking?
2. One obvious way that you are increasing your human capital by going to school is that 
you can be more productive in a career. In what other ways do you believe that you are 
increasing your human capital through your education?
5. SOCIAL CAPITAL
The English poet John Donne penned the famous line that “no man is an island.” Although 
the development of individual human capital is important for increasing productivity, nearly 
all economic activity involves the coordination of actions among numerous actors. Social 
capital consists of shared knowledge, ideas, and values, along with social organization and 
workplace relationships. These relationships and common understandings provide the social 
context for economic activity. 
Production possibilities depend on the ability to coordinate production among different 
people. Even with no change in machinery or technology, productivity can increase if 
coordination among workers improves or if workers become more motivated because of good 
management techniques. Social organization refers to the ways in which human productive 
activities are structured and coordinated.
Social capital also includes the cultural beliefs and goals that determine which knowledge 
is applied, which scientiﬁc questions are researched, and which technological possibilities are 
explored. A growing public awareness and acceptance of the hazards posed by global climate 
change, for example, could be considered a form of social capital, because it increases the 
ability of society to respond to a signiﬁcant threat to its future well-being.
In contemporary industrialized economies, the term “social capital” is most often used to 
refer to characteristics of a society that encourage cooperation among groups of people (e.g., 
workers and managers) whose joint efforts are needed to achieve a common goal. This kind of 
capital is built up to the extent that a society is characterized by strong norms of reciprocity, 
which lead people to trust and help one another, and dense networks of civic participation, 
which encourage people to engage in mutually beneﬁcial efforts rather than seeking only to 
gain individual advantage. Business accountants have led the way in recognizing one kind 
of social capital—good will—which they view as a signiﬁcant business asset that makes a 
ﬁrm more valuable than one might think from looking at its physical assets alone. Good will 
includes a number of intangible factors, such as a ﬁrm’s good reputation among its customers 
and creditors, good management, and good labor relations. It has become common practice

Social capital resembles other forms of capital in that it generates a service that enhances 
the output obtainable from other inputs, without being used up in the process of production.

FINANCIAL CAPITAL

Recognition of this concept by economists is fairly recent and has been strengthened by the 
observation that variation in social capital across societies can help to explain some of the 
differences in their economic development.
Discussion Questions
1. In what ways is it useful to think of knowledge, trust, motivation, and the like as though 
they were similar to productive machinery? What might be some drawbacks of this way 
of thinking?
2. Economic issues are often discussed in terms of money and prices, but it is difﬁcult to 
quantify social capital in such terms. Can you think of topics, both within the category 
of social capital and in other categories, that have economic importance but are hard to 
express in terms of money?
6. FINANCIAL CAPITAL
For most production processes, you have to acquire inputs before you can create outputs. Before 
it can make its ﬁrst sale, a start-up business needs to buy or rent a building and equipment, hire 
staff, and amass inventories of materials and supplies. You, as a student, must pay for tuition 
and textbooks either by using your savings or borrowing, in order to increase your human 
capital and eventually obtain a job. In a money economy ﬁnancial capital is what allows all 
these productive activities to get going in advance of the returns that will ﬂow from them.
Financial capital is a largely intangible form of capital. Its importance in the economy 
relies on the social beliefs that sustain the ﬁnancial system, much more than on the physical 
paper or the electronic documents that record its existence. Economists distinguish between 
two different forms of ﬁnancial capital: equity ﬁnance and debt ﬁnance.
6.1 EQUITY FINANCE
Suppose that you pay for a car completely in cash, as opposed to taking out a loan. This 
represents a form of equity ﬁnance, which means using your own money (i.e., wealth) to 
make a purchase. A business that uses its accumulated proﬁts to purchase new computers or 
machinery is also undertaking equity ﬁnance. “Equity” means having an ownership right. 
Thus equity ﬁnance means using resources that an individual or business currently owns. 
(This use of the term “equity” should not be confused with another meaning of the same 
word, “justice or fairness.”)
Like other forms of capital, ﬁnancial capital can be thought of in terms of stocks that increase 
or decrease over time and that provide a ﬂow of services. A farmer increases her ﬁnancial capital 
stock by laying aside the proceeds from her last harvest. She will use (and, very often, use up) 
her equity ﬁnancial capital as she spends it on supplies for the next productive season.
What are the commonest sources of equity ﬁnance? Individuals can ﬁnance their productive 
activities out of money that they have inherited or saved. Governments ﬁnance some programs out 
of accumulated past taxes. Businesses can accumulate funds by retaining some of their proﬁts or 
by selling shares of the business in the form of stocks. People add to their stock of equity ﬁnancial 
capital by saving, and they diminish their stock of equity ﬁnancial capital by spending.
6.2 DEBT FINANCE
Suppose instead that you need to take out a car loan, instead of paying all cash. As you do not have 
the ability to use equity ﬁnance to buy a car, you must rely upon debt ﬁnance. Debt ﬁnance means 
that you are able to gain access, temporarily, to the purchasing power of other actors’ wealth.
One can think of taking out a loan as “renting” ﬁnancial capital—renting the use of money. 
Just as an ofﬁce can be rented and used productively by one enterprise while it is owned by 
another, the services of the ﬁnancial capital are used by someone taking out a car loan while

CHAPTER 15 — CAPITAL STOCKS AND RESOURCE MAINTENANCE
the ﬁnancial capital is technically owned by a bank. Borrowers agree not only to repay the 
principal (the original amount) of the loan but also to give the lender interest, a charge for 
borrowing the funds, usually calculated as a percentage of the principal. (If the person taking 
out the car loan is not able to pay back the loan, the bank can usually take over ownership 
of the car in exchange for its lost funds.) 
Banks and nonbank ﬁnancial institutions, such as credit unions, are not the only providers of 
debt ﬁnance. Governments and large companies often raise ﬁnancial capital directly by selling 
bonds, which are ﬁnancial instruments that promise repayment of funds with interest.
Discussion Questions
1. Financial capital is important not only in the business and government spheres but also 
in the core sphere. What major purchases do families often ﬁnance through taking out a 
loan (i.e., debt ﬁnance)?
2. Explain how the concept of opportunity cost can inﬂuence the way in which you think 
about your use of ﬁnancial capital.
7. SUSTAINING CAPITAL STOCKS
Only recently has the ﬁeld of economics formally recognized that natural capital, human 
capital, and social capital are at least as critical to production as manufactured and ﬁnancial 
capital—and sometimes more so. Along with this realization has come the recognition that 
all these forms of capital are subject to erosion as well as growth. Because all production 
begins with, and depends on, the availability of the necessary capital stocks—including, in 
most cases, all ﬁve kinds that we have discussed—it is important to consider how these capital 
stocks are produced and maintained, and what circumstances might endanger their quantity 
or quality. The necessity of attending to the basic economic activity of resource maintenance 
has become more evident in recent years.
For example, what happens if stocks of manufactured capital are not maintained? If our 
stocks of housing, roads, communication systems, factories, and equipment are wearing out 
without being replaced, our standard of living can decline. What about social and human 
capital? If formal education systems, norms of raising children, or patterns of behavior change 
in ways that cause a deterioration in the education and health of a population or in prevailing 
standards of honesty, reliability, and originality, then it is likely, again, that standards of living 
will decline in the future.
At this moment in history, the deterioration of natural capital stocks is an especially widely 
recognized problem. Only in recent decades have we encountered global limits on the capacity 
of nature to absorb the intended and unintended effects of our economic activity. Increasingly, 
humans have gone beyond harvesting the annual produce of seas and soils and have begun 
to deplete the natural capacity for regeneration.
It is possible for economic activity to augment stocks of manufactured and human capital 
continually, more than offsetting any decline associated with the depreciation of manufactured 
capital and the retirement of existing workers. In contrast, the impact of economic activity 
on the stock of natural capital is most often negative; either the existing stock is drawn down 
(when natural resource inputs are used) or the quality of the stock is diminished (as by the 
introduction of waste products).
The stock of renewable natural capital can be maintained or augmented using wise resource 
management, and the (apparent) stock of nonrenewable resources can be increased through new 
discoveries. Moreover, the problem of a deteriorating natural resource stock can be allayed or 
postponed by technological and production method changes that reduce the amount of natural 
resource depletion or waste product generation associated with a given amount of production. 
Yet the fact that the earth and its resources are ﬁnite suggests that sooner or later the limit to the 
size of the physical ﬂow of production that can be maintained over time will be reached.

QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES

Many types of decline can be reversed, so these observations should not be taken as cause 
for despair. They do, however, point to the fact that economic policy and analysis are not 
simple matters. The economic health of a contemporary society depends on schools and 
family support systems as much as on factories and roads; it depends on workplace morale as 
well as on protection of air, soil, water, and species. And whether we are thinking about the 
long-term or the short-term health of the economy and the individuals in it, we must judge 
economic activities not only in relation to their intended effects but also in terms of their 
unplanned effects on the physical and social environments.

16 Production Costs
The United States is home to more than 30,000 businesses, ranging in size from the largest 
corporation in the world (in 2012, this was Walmart, which had revenues of nearly half a 
trillion dollars) to numerous businesses consisting of a single individual. Every day, many 
of these businesses are faced with decisions about what to produce, how to produce it, how 
to market it, and how much to sell it for. In this chapter, we focus on the economic activity 
of production: the conversion of resources into goods and services.
Although we focus on the production process of for-proﬁt businesses, economic production 
takes places in all three spheres. According to published statistics, about 12 percent of economic 
production in the United States in 2012 was attributed to government, including federal, state, 
and local governments. Another 12 percent of economic production took place in households 
and institutions. However, these statistics understate the amount of production that occurs in 
the public purpose and core spheres, because it fails to include production that is not distributed 
through markets. We develop a model of production costs based on a for-proﬁt ﬁrm, but many 
of the lessons of this model are applicable to public purpose and core production as well.
1. AN OVERVIEW OF PRODUCTION
Before we begin our analysis of production costs, we ﬁrst consider the goals of production 
and deﬁne some important concepts.
1.1 THE GOALS OF PRODUCTION
In the business sphere, it is normally essential that one of the goals of production be to make 
a proﬁt. This is not to say that the generation of proﬁt is the only goal pursued by businesses. 
Many companies balance social and environmental objectives with proﬁt-making. As one 
remarkable example, in 2011 the outdoor clothing and gear company Patagonia took out an ad 
in the New York Times advising readers: “Don’t buy what you don’t need. Think twice before 
buying anything,” based on concern about the environmental impacts of all production.1
At the same time, every period of history provides examples of businesses that have behaved 
unethically in the pursuit of proﬁts, including violence against workers. However, norms 
of what is generally acceptable change over time, sometimes swinging toward more social 
disapproval of harsh business practices, and at other times accepting—even celebrating—a 
“culture of greed,” as seemed to be the case in the last quarter of the twentieth century and 
into the twenty-ﬁrst century.
Economic analysis of production has tended to emphasize the objective of proﬁt-making. 
Starting in the 1960s, some economists began to argue that business managers should only 
seek to maximize proﬁts, without concern for any broader social or environmental objectives. 
The Nobel Prize–winning economist Milton Friedman once wrote:

 
AN OVERVIEW OF PRODUCTION 
351
[T]here is one and only one social responsibility of business—to use its resources and 
engage in activities designed to increase its proﬁts so long as it stays within the rules 
of the game.2
But businesses are increasingly operating with a broader set of objectives, often referred to 
as the triple bottom line. This perspective reﬂects a commitment to social and environmental 
goals, as well as making proﬁts.
Looking farther back in history, before the Civil War in the United States, corporations 
were fully accountable to the public to ensure that they acted in a manner that served the 
public good. Corporate charters could be revoked for failing to serve the public interest 
and were valid for only a certain period of time. For example, in 1831 a Delaware 
constitutional amendment speciﬁed that all corporations were limited to a twenty-year 
life span.
More recently, an emphasis on externalities is giving renewed attention to the question of 
whether particular productive activities are consistent with social and environmental well-
being. This question requires considering all costs and beneﬁts of the production process. 
In Chapter 13 we focused on environmental externalities, but negative social externalities 
should also be considered. For example, a business that increases its proﬁts by making its 
employees work overtime without pay is creating a negative social externality, not reﬂected 
in the prices of the products that it sells. Lawsuits have been brought against Walmart in 
several U.S. states that found the corporation guilty of forcing some employees to work 
without pay.3 The negative social externality resulting from Walmart’s minimizing what it 
pays workers extends to policies of hiring employees to work just below the number of hours 
that would qualify them for full-time beneﬁts, including health insurance coverage. Lacking 
health-care beneﬁts, and with salaries that leave them little spare money for regular doctor 
visits, such workers often use emergency rooms as their only venue for medical care. These 
costs are generally externalized onto states, which have to pay for emergency room visits 
that could easily have been avoided, at much less cost to society, if the workers had access 
to health insurance.
We can use the technique of cost-beneﬁt analysis, also discussed in Chapter 13, to estimate 
the net social impacts of production decisions. One problem with implementing such an 
analysis, however, arises from the fact that some costs and beneﬁts are easier to measure than 
others. It is relatively easy, for example, to determine how many jobs will be created if a large 
retailer builds a new store in an area. It may even be relatively easy to convert the number of 
jobs gained into a beneﬁt that can be expressed in dollars. It is harder to quantify the costs to 
social well-being from any environmental damages associated with the store or the loss of 
community as people become less likely to shop at “mom and pop” competitors.
So, although much of our discussion about production costs and decisions is in the context 
of making proﬁts, we also keep in mind the broader environmental and social context in 
which all production occurs.
1.2 AN ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE ON PRODUCTION
As we have stated before, production involves the conversion of resources into goods and 
services. We deﬁne inputs as the resources that go into production, and outputs as the goods 
and services that result from production. In addition to desired goods and services, all produc-
tion processes also generate waste, including pollution, waste materials, and waste heat.
We tend to think of production in terms of physical goods. For example, cotton goes into 
a textile mill as ﬁber and comes out as fabric. This fabric is then shipped to another location, 
printed with small red hearts, cut into pieces, sewn into boxer shorts, distributed through 
wholesalers, and eventually marketed by retailers. Or households may purchase cotton fabric 
and use it to produce homemade curtains or Halloween costumes. To most people, the various 
triple bottom line:

performance of a 
business according to 
social and environ-
mental goals, as well 
as making proﬁts

that go into 
production
outputs: the goods 
and services that re-
sult from production

352 
CHAPTER 16 — PRODUCTION COSTS
stages of manufacturing would be regarded as production, but the transport, distribution, and 
sale that are involved would not.
Economists think of production more broadly, including any activity involved in the 
conversion of resources into ﬁnal goods and services. For example, Texas oil “producers” do not 
actually make oil; they merely transport it from its natural state under the ground to the nearest 
reﬁnery. Yet this activity is still considered production in a broad economic sense. Similarly, such 
activities as storage, packaging, and retailing all can be interpreted as forms of production.
Nor is production conﬁned to processes that involve tangible goods. Production also 
includes providing services. Accordingly, from an economist’s point of view, physicians, 
child-care providers, mechanics, musicians, park rangers, lawyers, professors, house cleaners, 
tax auditors, and massage therapists are all engaged in production, even though they don’t 
produce a physical product.
Another important concept in thinking about production from an economic perspective 
is marginal analysis, which involves thinking about incremental changes. We have already 
seen the importance of marginal thinking in Chapter 6. When we apply marginal analysis to 
production decisions, we ask whether it makes economic sense to produce one more unit of 
a good or service. In other words, we should compare the marginal beneﬁts of a decision to 
its marginal costs.
As long as marginal beneﬁts exceed marginal costs, it makes sense for a business to 
expand production. But after the marginal costs rise to the level of marginal beneﬁts, the 
ﬁrm should stop increasing production. We spend much of the remainder of the chapter 
introducing an economic model of marginal production costs. We will then use this model in 
the next chapter to illustrate how a hypothetical ﬁrm can maximize its proﬁts. But as we have 
discussed previously, a model is a simpliﬁcation of the real world that focuses on some issues 
while ignoring others. So although this model is considered applicable to many production 
decisions, it is not intended to apply to every production situation.
Discussion Questions
1. What distinguishes the economic activity of production from the activity of resource 
maintenance? Of consumption? Of distribution?
2. Think about the processes involved in producing this textbook. Describe these processes, 
considering all the steps of production from an economic perspective. What inputs were 
required? What waste was generated?
2. TYPES OF PRODUCTION COSTS
We begin our analysis by differentiating between different types of costs. As with several 
other topics explored here, economists view production costs from a perspective that differs 
somewhat from that of noneconomists.
2.1 FIXED VERSUS VARIABLE COSTS
Consider the production costs of farming. A farmer who grows corn, let’s call her Gail, needs 
to purchase various inputs, such as seed, fertilizer, and fuel for machinery. To some extent, 
Gail can vary the amount of these inputs that she purchases. For example, she can use a little 
fertilizer or a lot. The amount that she spends on fertilizer will also depend on the type of 
fertilizer that she applies. Her options may include purchasing a chemical fertilizer, purchas-
ing compost, or obtaining compost from her own farm residues.
The production costs that Gail can easily adjust are called variable costs. Variable costs 
can be adjusted relatively quickly in response to changes in market conditions, production 
targets, or other circumstances. Another way to deﬁne variable costs is that these costs do 
not need to be paid if, for some reason, Gail decides not to produce corn.

TYPES OF PRODUCTION COSTS 
353
Gail has other costs to pay regardless of whether she decides to produce corn. These are 
called ﬁxed costs, which include such expenses as a mortgage and monthly payments on 
machinery. Another term economists use for ﬁxed costs is “sunk costs.” Regardless of how 
much corn Gail produces, she cannot avoid paying these costs. The distinction between ﬁxed 
and variable costs is not always clear. Gail could decide to sell all her farm machinery, so 
in this sense machinery becomes a variable cost, but it may take some time for her to ﬁnd 
buyers. Given enough time, all production costs become variable as a business could decide 
to shut down entirely and sell off all its resources.
Differentiating between ﬁxed and variable costs is important in order to analyze how 
producers will respond to changes in market conditions. By changing its variable costs, a 
business can normally change its output level. So, if corn prices rise, Gail may bring some 
new land into corn production, which will require greater expenses for seed, fertilizer, and 
fuel. But Gail cannot adjust her ﬁxed costs in a relatively short period. If corn prices go down, 
she has the option of spending less on corn seed, but she still must pay the mortgage on her 
farm and other ﬁxed costs. If corn prices stay down for an extended period, say several years, 
she may be forced to sell her farm and pursue a different career.
2.2 ACCOUNTING VERSUS ECONOMIC COSTS
The costs just discussed are all actual monetary costs paid by a producer. When Gail com-
pletes her tax return and calculates her farming proﬁts, she (or her accountant) can list all 
these costs—both ﬁxed and variable—as valid business expenses. Accounting costs can also 
include some items that are not actual out-of-pocket expenditures but that are understood to 
reduce the value of the stock of capital owned by the business; the most common example is 
depreciation of buildings or equipment. Table 16.1 presents an example of Gail’s accounting 
costs.
We can take a broader perspective on Gail’s costs of farming by considering other costs 
that, like depreciation, do not appear as monetary outﬂows. Perhaps the most obvious example 
is the value of Gail’s time. If Gail is a full-time farmer, she is thus giving up the opportunity 
to work at a different job, say as an engineer or a teacher. The salary that she could obtain 
at her next-best option is the opportunity cost of Gail’s decision to be a farmer. So if Gail’s 
best alternative to farming is to be a teacher and earn $30,000 per year, this forgone salary 
also represents a production cost, as shown in Table 16.1.

CHAPTER 16 — PRODUCTION COSTS
Economic costs include accounting costs but also add in the value of forgone opportunities. 
In addition to a forgone salary, another economic cost would be the value of forgone 
investments. Suppose that, in addition to taking out a bank loan, Gail also uses her own equity 
capital to ﬁnance some of the costs of farming (recall our discussion of equity ﬁnance from 
Chapter 15). Her next-best alternative may have been to invest that money in the stock market 
and make a return on her investment. Her forgone investment returns are another economic 
cost, as shown in Table 16.1.
If Gail looks at the full economic costs of farming over this season—rather than just at 
the accounting costs—she will ﬁnd that farming is more costly than she may have initially 
thought. Whereas her account books show costs of $48,000, it is really costing her $90,000 
to farm for the season when we consider her opportunity costs.
The same concept applies to the costs of production in other spheres of the economy. 
For example, think about the government of an economically depressed county, which is 
considering whether to invest in building a new highway. The project will hire people and 
pay them a salary. The accounting costs for this labor, included in the project’s budget, 
will be the actual salary paid. To calculate the economic costs of this labor, however, 
from the perspective of society’s production possibilities, you have to think about how 
much this highway project pulls out of other productive activities that would otherwise 
have been undertaken. If the workers would otherwise have been unemployed and not 
productively engaged at home or in their communities, the answer might be that not very 
much is lost elsewhere. But if the workers could have otherwise been building needed 
new schools or hospitals, it may be that the economic costs are much higher than the 
accounting costs.
The advantage of considering economic costs, rather than just accounting costs, is that 
we have a more complete framework for making production decisions. Producers should 
always weigh the beneﬁts of a decision against its costs, both its ﬁnancial costs and the costs 
of what must be given up.
2.3 PRIVATE VERSUS EXTERNAL COSTS
Suppose that Gail’s farming practices result in fertilizer runoff that pollutes a river, reducing 
downstream ﬁshing and swimming opportunities and harming the ecosystem. As we saw 
in Chapter 13, this represents a negative externality. Gail is unlikely to take such costs into 
account when making production decisions. She will consider only her private costs—her 
accounting costs and perhaps her economic costs as well.
But the pollution represents a real cost imposed on society. Suppose that, using the 
techniques discussed in Chapter 13, we estimate the negative externality costs of Gail’s 
farming at $5,000 per year. From the perspective of social welfare, this is an additional cost 
of farming, as shown in Table 16.1. The true social cost of farming would be the sum of 
the economic and externality costs. In an ideal world, there would be ways of ensuring that 
externality costs are internalized. For example, if Gail had to pay a “farming tax” of $5,000 
per year to compensate society for the pollution damage, then the tax would be an accounting 
cost and thus enter directly into Gail’s production decisions.
The distinction between private and external costs is important because a production process 
chosen by a producer that may appear to be the least expensive based on accounting, and 
perhaps economic, costs, may not be the least-cost option when externalities are considered. 
In the absence of any motivation to consider the social or environmental externalities, Gail 
may conclude that her optimal production decision is to rely on chemical fertilizers to grow 
corn. But the optimal production decision from the perspective of society may be that she 
should replace some chemical fertilizer with organic farming techniques. This exempliﬁes 
the fact that private production decisions may not always align with the best choice in terms 
of social well-being.

Discussion Questions
1. In order to take this course, you have paid tuition and bought this book. What other costs 
should be added in to calculate the economic costs of this course to you personally? (Hint: 
What is your best alternative to spending time taking this course? How are you ﬁnancing 
your education?) Does your taking this course entail any externality costs, in addition to 
your private economic costs?
2. What fairness issues arise when producers are required to take social or environmental 
costs into account in their decision-making? For example, suppose that Gail is just barely 
making ends meet, using proceeds from the sale of her farm’s output to feed and house 
her family—while the neighbors who are suffering the consequences of runoff from her 
fertilizer applications are mostly better off than she is. Should government policies take 
this into consideration? Who should make such a decision?
3. THE PRODUCTION FUNCTION
Actual production decisions are often a matter of trial and error. Firms might experiment with 
different levels of various inputs to determine which production processes are the least costly. 
Often the results will be difﬁcult to predict in advance, and ﬁrms can make costly mistakes. But 
with our model of production, we assume for now that ﬁrms have accurate information about the 
relationship between the levels of various inputs and output. This enables us to deﬁne a produc-
tion function, an equation or graph that represents the relationship between a set of inputs and the 
amount of output that a ﬁrm (or other economic actor) can produce over a given period. Production 
functions typically do not exist “out there” in the real-world economy, but this model can help us 
think about certain aspects of production in a very simple, and sometimes useful, way.
3.1 THINKING ABOUT INPUTS AND OUTPUTS
Many inputs go into real-world production processes. We continue to use the example of 
farming because it is relatively easy to produce fairly realistic, easy to comprehend, produc-
tion functions for farms—and because there have been many studies of farming production 
functions. The normal inputs include land (a type of natural capital), machinery (manufactured 
capital), and labor (human capital). Human capital, as we have seen in earlier chapters, is more 
than just hours of labor; it also includes a component of formal education that has become 
increasingly important for modern farmers. Social capital can also be considered a farming 
input in terms of the strength and quality of relations among farm workers and managers. 
Financial capital is also needed by most farmers in terms of loans to ﬁnance the purchase of 
land, equipment, and other inputs.
In a very general sense, we can define a production function using the following 
mathematical equation:
Y = f (natural capital, manufactured capital, human capital, social capital, ﬁnancial capital)
where Y represents a quantity of output, f () is read “is a function of,” and the inputs include 
the levels of different types of capital discussed in Chapter 15. In the case of corn production, 
we can deﬁne a more speciﬁc production function as:
Y = f (seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, labor, land, equipment . . . )
This means that the quantity of output (say bushels of corn) is a function of the number of 
seeds planted, the amount of fertilizer applied, the amount of pesticides applied, the amount 
of labor allocated to corn production, the amount of land used for corn production, the type 
of equipment used, and so on.

CHAPTER 16 — PRODUCTION COSTS
Extending our discussion about ﬁxed and variable costs, we can correspondingly deﬁne 
various inputs as ﬁxed or variable. Fixed inputs by deﬁnition are those for which the quantities 
do not change, regardless of the level of production. An example of a ﬁxed input is a farmer 
who has leased a ﬁeld for the growing season. If the farmer already signed a lease for the 
use of the ﬁeld, she is not able right now to avoid paying for this input. By contrast, variable 
inputs are those for which the quantities can be changed quickly, resulting in changes in the 
level of production. In our farming example, fertilizers and pesticides are variable inputs 
because a farmer can change her use of these inputs relatively quickly.
As mentioned earlier, over a very long period all inputs might be considered variable. So 
economists try to make the distinction more speciﬁc by deﬁning the short run as a period 
in which at least one production input is ﬁxed in quantity. A farmer, for example, may be 
temporarily constrained by the size of her land holdings and by the amount of equipment 
she owns, but can vary many other inputs, such as seeds, fertilizers, and labor. In other 
production processes, an organization may be constrained by a lack of space, a shortage of 
materials, a dearth of suitably talented workers, or any other production input. The key aspect 
is that a limiting factor creates a constraint to increasing production. Even with access to 
unlimited amounts of all the variable inputs, production can go only so far, because of this 
one limiting factor.
In the long run, the quantities of all production inputs may be varied. In the case of farming, 
this means the amount of time (perhaps several months) in which more land can be purchased, 
more machinery purchased, and more labor hired. In other situations, it might take years for 
a business to increase or decrease (or eliminate) the quantities of all inputs.
3.2 GRAPHING PRODUCTION FUNCTIONS
As with supply and demand in Chapter 4, we can represent a production function using 
either a table or a graph. We keep our model simple by focusing on just one input at a time. 
One production relationship that has been studied by numerous researchers is the impact of 
different fertilizer levels on crop yields. Table 16.2 presents the results of one such study, 
showing the effect of applying various amounts of nitrogen fertilizer on corn yields over a 
season. The study was performed in Missouri in the late 1990s.4 The researchers varied the 
amount of fertilizer used on different ﬁelds in increments of 20 pounds per acre. At harvest 
time, the corn yield was recorded in bushels per acre. For mathematical simplicity, we call 
each 20-pound increment a “bag” of fertilizer and express all values in per-acre terms. Ni-
trogen can be obtained from renewable, organic sources such as manure or alfalfa or from 
chemical fertilizer produced using nonrenewable natural gas. This study looked at nitrogen 
from chemical sources.
In this case, nitrogen fertilizer is a variable input, and corn is the output. Corn yields 
increase as more fertilizer is added. We can take the data in Table 16.2 and convert it to a 
ﬁxed input: a pro-
duction input that 
is ﬁxed in quantity, 
regardless of the level 
of production
variable input: a 
production input 
whose quantity can 
be changed relatively 
quickly, resulting in 
changes in the level of 
production
short run (in terms 
of production pro-
cesses): a period in 
which at least one 
production input has 
a ﬁxed quantity
limiting factor: a 
ﬁxed input that cre-
ates a constraint to 
increasing production
long run: (in terms 
of production pro-
cesses) a period in 
which all production 
inputs can be varied 
in quantity

THE PRODUCTION FUNCTION

graph, as shown in Figure 16.1. So, we can see, for example, that when 3 bags of fertilizer 
are applied per acre, corn yields are 137 bushels per acre. Note that we have started the 
vertical axes at 80 bushels per acre for graphical convenience, to focus on the range where 
corn yields occur in the study.
For this production function, we are only measuring the impact of one variable input—
nitrogen fertilizer. The researchers in this case tried to keep all other variable inputs, such as 
the amount of seed applied, the amount of water, soil quality, and so on, unchanging across 
the various corn ﬁelds, to isolate the impact of one variable input. Recall that in economics, 
when we want to isolate the effect of one particular variable on another, we hope to study 
the particular relationship ceteris paribus, or “with all else constant.” Remember, also, that a 
relationship in which an increase in one variable is accompanied by an increase in the other 
is called a “positive” or “direct” relationship. You can see in Figure 16.1 that nitrogen and 
crop yields have a positive relationship, though the curve goes upward less steeply as one 
moves to the right.
3.3 PRODUCTION IN THE SHORT RUN
Another term that economists use to describe the production function in Figure 16.1 is a total 
product curve. A total product curve shows the total amount of product (i.e., output) as a 
function of one variable input, holding all other inputs constant. But as we mentioned earlier 
in the chapter, production decisions are based on marginal analysis. So, we focus on how 
much corn output changes with each additional bag of fertilizer. We call the additional corn 
output with each additional bag of fertilizer (holding all other inputs constant) the marginal 
product. We can take the data in Table 16.2 and calculate the marginal product for each ad-
ditional bag of fertilizer, as shown in Table 16.3.
Table 16.3 shows that adding the ﬁrst bag of fertilizer increases corn yields from 100 
bushels per acre to 115 bushels per acre, for a marginal product of 15 bushels. The marginal 
product going from 1 to 2 bags of fertilizer is 12 bushels, as shown in the table as the difference 
between 127 and 115 bushels. You can calculate the marginal product for the fourth bag of 
fertilizer yourself for practice.
Table 16.3 indicates that the marginal product of additional fertilizer is constantly declining, 
referred to by economists as diminishing marginal returns. For each additional unit of an 
input, the marginal product (or return) increases by a smaller amount.

CHAPTER 16 — PRODUCTION COSTS
We should not be surprised that the production function for corn displays diminishing marginal 
returns. If there were not diminishing marginal returns, you could feed the whole world from one 
farmer’s ﬁeld just by adding more and more nitrogen fertilizer forever. But, in reality, as more and 
more nitrogen is added to the same amount of land, eventually the corn plants become unable to 
make use of the extra amounts. Eventually, if excessive fertilizer were added, the graph would 
turn downward, with a negative slope, as the crop would suffer from fertilizer “burn.”
In a case of diminishing marginal returns, as we have seen for corn production, the 
total product curve gets ﬂatter as you move out to the right. Not all production functions 
display diminishing marginal returns, at least not throughout the entire production range. 
Suppose that we consider a production function for handmade shoes. Let’s assume that 
one worker can make two shoes a day. So if we have only one worker (our variable 
input), two shoes per day can be produced. If we have two workers, then four shoes 
can be produced per day. Three workers means that six shoes can be produced. In this 
case, each additional unit of our variable input (workers) results in the same marginal 
product—two additional shoes per day. Economists refer to this as a case of constant 
marginal returns.
Finally, a production function can display increasing marginal returns. This can occur in 
our shoemaking example if adding workers allows for specialization and an overall increase 
in efﬁciency. For example, one worker might specialize in cutting leather, another might make 
only soles, and a third could focus on stitching. In this case, the total product curve would 
increase at an increasing rate, at least up to a certain number of workers.
Figure 16.2 illustrates production functions with constant and increasing marginal 
returns. For constant marginal returns, the total product curve is a straight line sloping 
upward. For increasing marginal returns, the total product curve becomes steeper as we 
move to the right.

PRODUCTION COSTS 
359
It is possible for a production process to exhibit all three patterns of marginal returns when 
we consider the entire range of production levels. Figure 16.3 shows increasing marginal 
returns at very low levels of the input, constant marginal returns for moderate levels of the 
input, and then decreasing marginal returns for high levels of the input. Such a production 
function may be common in the real world. Consider a restaurant. If there is only one worker 
to take orders, cook the food, and wash dishes, production is likely to be very inefﬁcient. 
Adding more workers allows for specialization and increasing marginal returns. Once a 
restaurant has enough workers for each separate task, then perhaps doubling the number of 
workers (e.g., increasing from one cook to two cooks) might exactly double total production. 
However, eventually hiring more workers leads to decreasing marginal returns as the kitchen 
become too crowded to allow for effective production. As the old saying goes, too many 
cooks spoil the broth.

Many real-world production functions 
display increasing, constant, and 
decreasing marginal returns when 
we consider the full range of 
production levels.
4. PRODUCTION COSTS
In this last section, we combine information about production costs with a production func-
tion to determine the costs of different levels of production. We will differentiate between 
production in the short run and in the long run.
4.1 PRODUCTION COSTS IN THE SHORT RUN
Now that we understand the physical side of production, we can turn back to the topic of 
production costs. Our distinction between ﬁxed and variable costs can be related to our 
discussion of ﬁxed and variable inputs. Speciﬁcally, variable costs are costs that vary by 
changing the level of a variable input. So in order to apply more fertilizer, a farmer must 
increase her variable costs. Fixed costs are those that arise from ﬁxed inputs. Gail’s mort-
gage payments on her farm are ﬁxed as she cannot vary the amount of land that she owns 
in the short run.
Total cost is simply the sum of ﬁxed and variable costs. We can apply this concept to our 
example of nitrogen fertilizer. Let’s suppose that the cost of nitrogen fertilizer is $15 per 
bag. For simplicity, for now we assume that this is our only variable cost. All other costs 
of producing corn are considered ﬁxed in the short run and total $500 per acre. Table 16.4 
calculates the ﬁxed and variable cost of applying different amounts of nitrogen fertilizer. For 
each additional bag of fertilizer, total costs increase by $15. In other words, the marginal cost 
of each additional bag of fertilizer is $15.
We can take the data in Table 16.4 and graph a total cost curve, which relates the total 
cost of production to the level of output, as shown in Figure 16.4. We see that the slope 
becomes steeper as we move to the right. This makes sense, as it becomes increasingly 
total cost: the sum 
of ﬁxed and variable 
costs

CHAPTER 16 — PRODUCTION COSTS
expensive to produce an additional bushel of corn per acre. In other words, the higher 
the level of corn production, the more fertilizer needs to be added to produce one more 
bushel per acre. This is consistent with a total product curve with diminishing marginal 
returns.
We can examine the total cost curve in more detail to determine the marginal cost of 
producing corn. Speciﬁcally, we can use the total cost curve, and the data in Table 16.4, to 
determine the marginal cost of producing one more bushel of corn. This will vary depending 
on the level of corn production. Note that this is fundamentally different from the marginal 
cost of a bag of nitrogen fertilizer, which is always $15 per bag.
Let’s determine what the marginal cost of corn production is as we go from producing 
145 bushels per acre to 150 bushels. We see in Table 16.4 that total costs increase from $560 
to $575 as we go from adding 4 bags of fertilizer to 5 bags. As it costs an additional $15 to 
produce 5 more bushels of corn, the marginal cost per bushel is $3, obtained by dividing the 
additional cost of $15 by ﬁve bushels, as shown in Figure 16.5.
We can calculate the marginal cost of corn production for other levels of corn production, 
as shown in the last column of Table 16.5. You can test yourself by calculating the marginal 
cost of corn production going from 154 to 157 bushels per acre.

A total cost curve shows the 
relationship between the total cost of 
production and the level of output.

 
PRODUCTION COSTS 
361
We can see that the marginal cost of producing corn increases as production levels increase. 
Diminishing marginal returns to fertilizer application have resulted in increasing marginal 
costs for corn production. In other words, the cost of producing one more bushel of corn 
rises as more output is produced.
In computing the marginal costs, we ignored the ﬁxed costs. This is correct, because we 
assumed that ﬁxed costs would be paid regardless of whether any nitrogen fertilizer was 
used, and we were interested only in the cost of the “additional” or “marginal” bushel of 
corn production.
The important part of this discussion of diminishing marginal returns and increasing 
marginal costs is not so much the algebra involved, or even the graphs, though both can 
be helpful. The signiﬁcant implication for producer behavior is that diminishing marginal 
returns and increasing marginal costs mean that, in the short run, the quantity of production 
will tend to be naturally limited.
Diminishing returns mean that it does not make sense for the farmer to try to feed the whole 
world from one plot. Increasing costs mean that at some point production will become too 
expensive relative to beneﬁts received (e.g., revenue from sales of the harvest) to be worthwhile. In 
Chapter 17 we will see that diminishing returns are assumed in the case of the proﬁt-maximizing 
competitive ﬁrm. Because marginal costs are increasing, whereas the price that the ﬁrm receives 
for its output is constant, the traditional microeconomic model gives a neat diagrammatic 
explanation of how a ﬁrm will choose a unique, proﬁt-maximizing level of output.
What if marginal returns are constant, as illustrated in the left-hand graph in Figure 16.2? 
Then we will have constant marginal costs. In this case, each unit of the variable input 
(which has a constant price) adds exactly the same amount to output, so the cost for each 
additional unit of output is the same. The total cost curve will be a straight line.
What if marginal returns are increasing, as illustrated in the right-hand graph in Figure 
16.2? Then we will have decreasing marginal costs. To portray a total cost curve with 
increasing marginal returns, you would draw a line that rises but also ﬂattens out or 
curves toward the horizontal axis as you move to the right. Increasing marginal returns 
mean decreasing marginal costs, because additional production is getting cheaper as 
output increases.
Sometimes all these cost patterns are combined in one graph, such as Figure 16.5. Figure 
16.5 shows the pattern of costs that corresponds to the pattern of returns that we saw in Figure 
16.3, with decreasing marginal costs, followed by constant and then increasing marginal costs, 
as the quantity of output increases. In the lower part of the graph, the pattern of marginal 
costs is graphed explicitly.
For certain production processes, such as the application of fertilizer to corn, curves like 
these can actually be quite accurately graphed on the basis of real-world studies done by 
increasing margin-
al costs: the situation 
in which the cost of 
producing one ad-
ditional unit of output 
rises as more output 
is produced

researchers. In most cases, however, these curves are only hypothetical. Rarely would lone 
producers, concerned with providing for a family or staying in business, have the luxury of 
being able to conduct such a study. While they were holding some inputs constant, and varying 
others from zero up to high amounts in order to ﬁnd out what exactly their total product curve 
and total cost curve were, they could easily go out of business!
These graphs do, however, give us a visual image that can help us think about the many 
ways in which production and cost may be related, for many producers. We see that the 
concepts of diminishing returns and increasing returns, in particular, are important throughout 
the study of microeconomics.
4.2 PRODUCTION COSTS IN THE LONG RUN
In the long run, as we noted earlier, all inputs are variable. A farmer can buy or rent more 
land or equipment. A factory owner can build a new factory. More engineers can be trained 
in software development, if skilled engineers are a short-run ﬁxed input. A business owner 
may be able to expand by hiring an assistant, if his or her own time for decision making is 
the limiting factor. A child-care enterprise can expand from a private home to a larger center, 
if space is the capacity constraint.
Given sufﬁcient time to acquire the needed machines or other resources, or to make other 
necessary adjustments, a producer should be able to remove all obstacles to getting the highest 
net beneﬁts (proﬁts) from production. Although in the short run space, equipment, skills, or 
time present a constraint on capacity, in the long run these constraints can be loosened. Then 
a question arises: How big should an enterprise get?
Why do we observe, for example, small neighborhood child-care centers and single-
worker locksmith businesses, but not small neighborhood steel foundries or hospitals? 
Many factors can contribute to the explanation of enterprise size, including factors related 
to history, culture, and the level of demand for a producer’s output. Here we focus on 
technological and cost-related reasons that one size, or scale, may be more advantageous 
than another.

The graphs show the relationship 
between total and marginal cost 
curves. For many real-world 
enterprises, their marginal cost 
curve is U-shaped. 

 
PRODUCTION COSTS 
363
Because we are now looking at these issues with a long-term perspective, marginal cost—
discussed above for the case of the short run, in which one input is ﬁxed—is no longer the 
relevant concept, because now all inputs can be varied. It is, however, relevant to calculate 
the average cost (or average total cost) per unit of production. This can be done simply by 
dividing total cost by the quantity of output produced, at any production level. For example, 
if it costs $500 to produce 100 bushels of corn, the average cost per bushel at this level of 
production is simply $500/100 bushels = $5 per bushel.
The relevant type of cost when the entire scale of production can be varied is the long-run 
average cost, which is the cost per unit of output when all inputs are variable. It is logical 
to think that, to whatever extent possible, enterprises will tend to grow to the size where the 
long-run average costs are lowest. Enterprises that are bigger or smaller than this optimal 
size would be unnecessarily expensive to run.
For example, to go into business, a locksmith needs primarily a set of tools and a van. 
To double the output of a single-locksmith enterprise would require a second locksmith, 
another set of tools, and another van. Except for perhaps some small savings in costs, such 
as advertising or billing, there is no reason to believe that the new, larger ﬁrm would be any 
cheaper to run, per unit of output, than the old, smaller one. In fact, if the new locksmith has 
to service customers who are farther away from the head ofﬁce, it may be more expensive 
per unit of output. It may therefore make more sense for each neighborhood to have its own 
local locksmith (though perhaps a group of locksmiths might jointly hire advertising and 
billing services). Bigger is not necessarily better in this case.
By contrast, a steel foundry requires a sizable investment in plant and equipment, and 
a hospital that has only a few beds would be either exceedingly expensive to run (as a 
consequence of underutilization of skilled labor and laboratory facilities) or exceedingly 
limited in its services. Enterprises in such industries tend to be big because of what economists 
call economies of scale. A process exhibits economies of scale when, in the long run, average 
production costs decline as the size of the enterprise increases. You could build a single 
foundry furnace to turn out a few pounds of iron a year—but it might cost its weight in gold 
to produce each pound of iron. A foundry reaches a stage of low costs per unit only when it 
is producing steel in much larger quantities.
A production process exhibits constant returns to scale over the range where the 
long-run average cost is constant as the size of the enterprise changes. Finally, a process 
exhibits diseconomies of scale if the long-run average cost rises with the size of an 
enterprise. Similar to our previous discussion, a production process can display all three 
types of returns to scale. This is illustrated as a U-shaped long-run average cost curve 
in Figure 16.6.
What might cause diseconomies of scale? It is generally thought that no matter how many 
technical economies of scale there may be, for most enterprises there is a point at which 
long-run average

production per unit 
of output when all 
inputs can be varied 
in quantity
economies of scale: 
situations in which 
the long-run average 
cost of production 
falls as the size of the 
enterprise increases

in which the long-
run average cost of 
production stays 
the same as the size 
of the enterprise 
increases 
diseconomies of

which the long-run 
average cost of pro-
duction rises as the 
size of the enterprise 
increases

average total cost):

output, computed as 
total cost divided by 
the quantity of output 
produced

CHAPTER 16 — PRODUCTION COSTS
they are just too big for all the human beings and all the functions involved to be managed 
effectively. Some of the big business mergers in recent decades were inspired by hopes of 
reaping economies of scale (as well as market power or simply in the belief that bigger would 
be better). Such hopes were sometimes dashed, with the failure of such megamergers as AOL 
and Time Warner in 2001 and Sprint and Nextel in 2005. 
Many production processes appear to have a minimum efﬁcient scale. This is the point 
at which the long-run average cost curve begins to bottom out, as shown in Figure 16.6. 
For locksmiths, the minimum efﬁcient scale might be the output level corresponding to a 
one-person shop; for an automobile company, it may be several thousand vehicles per year. 
Levels of output less than these may leave some resources underemployed, thus creating the 
downward-sloping portion of the long-run average cost curve. Given the problems of managing 
very large organizations, one can also posit the existence of a maximum efﬁcient scale—which 
is the largest an enterprise can be and still beneﬁt from low long-run average costs.
4.3 PRODUCTION PROCESS CHOICE
Another important issue in the economics of production is the choice of production process. If 
two or more processes exist that can make the same output, which should be chosen? Produc-
ers, to be economically efﬁcient, should choose the process that entails the lowest cost.
Because various technologies are available, producers can engage in input substitution, 
using less of one input and more of another while producing the same good or service, as 
costs and availability change. As we mentioned earlier, in the case of corn farming, nitrogen 
can be obtained from renewable, organic sources such as manure and alfalfa or from chemical 
fertilizer produced using nonrenewable natural gas. Generally, whenever prices change, 
producers will want to substitute cheaper inputs for inputs that have become more expensive. 
From a public welfare perspective, input substitution will enhance well-being when the choices 
that are made take into account external as well as internal costs.
Of particular importance, historically, has been the process of substituting the use of 
machinery for human labor. This is dramatically exempliﬁed in the American folk hero John 
Henry, the railway worker who pitted himself against the new steam drill that threatened to 
take jobs away from him and his fellows. In his heroic effort, John Henry fulﬁlled his promise 
to “die with a hammer in my hand.”
Yet even with modern production methods that rely heavily on machines, labor 
remains an important input cost. Because of globalization and the possibility of moving 
production to any part of the world, an increasingly important question has been where to 
produce. Low wages in countries such as China, Vietnam, and Bangladesh have motivated 
many companies to locate production facilities in those countries. In general, the cost 
savings associated with production in a low-wage country outweigh the increased costs 
of transporting goods long distances to market. However, wage trends are beginning to 
reverse in some cases, and manufacturing in the United States may be making a comeback, 
as discussed in Box 16.1.
Discussion Questions
1. Explain in your own words why a ﬁrm’s marginal cost curve may initially decline, but 
then increase, as the quantity of output increases.
2. Diminishing marginal returns is a valuable concept, not only in economics, but in many 
other areas of life: an obvious example (which we saw in Chapter 9, on consumption) 
was the diminishing pleasure received by eating successive units of the same food. 
Suggest two other areas in life that exhibit diminishing marginal returns. Can you also 
think of some examples in your own life where there are constant or increasing returns 
to scale (i.e., you get the same, or more, psychic or other “returns” from each additional 
increment of something)?

REVIEW QUESTIONS
BOX 16.1 MADE IN THE USA AGAIN?
The production cost savings from low wages are 
a primary reason manufacturing has shifted from 
the United States and other developed countries 
to emerging countries such as China. But with 
rapid economic growth in China, the choice between 
“Made in China” and “Made in the USA” has become 
more difﬁcult. Between 2005 and 2010 the average 
wage for factory workers in China increased by 69 
percent. Meanwhile, wage growth in the United 
States has stagnated (recall our discussion of median 
wages in the United States in Chapter 10). Thus the 
relative wage advantage of producing in China is 
decreasing.
According to a study by Boston Consulting Group 
(BCG), the change in relative wage growth sug-
gests the potential for an “American renaissance” in 
manufacturing. Hal Sirkin of BCG states, “Sometime 
around 2015, manufacturers will be indifferent be-
tween locating in America or China for production for 
consumption in America.” He bases this prediction on 
the assumption that annual wage growth will continue 
to be a robust 17 percent per year in China but rather 
slow in the United States.
Firms are also ﬁnding that there are advantages 
to reducing the complexity of supply chains. When 
production occurs across several countries, an un-
expected event in only one of those countries, such 
as an earthquake or a disease outbreak, can cause 
a costly supply disruption. Thus, keeping production 
domestic reduces overall risk.
BCG indicates that several companies have already 
brought overseas production back to the United States. 
The heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar has 
shifted some production from overseas to a factory 
in Texas. In 2010 Wham-O moved half its Frisbee 
and Hula Hoop production to the United States from 
China and Mexico.
But even if China’s production cost advantage 
vanishes, other countries with even lower wages 
provide companies with viable options. For example, 
the manufacturing cost advantage of producing in 
India and Bangladesh is likely to persist for some 
time. Also, with rapid demand growth in emerging 
markets, production in China still makes economic 
sense for goods sold there.
Finally, shifting production back to the United States 
may not be feasible in some cases, at least in the short 
run. For example, the United States no longer has the 
supply base or the infrastructure to support consumer 
electronics manufacturing. While ﬁrms may not have 
realized it at the time, some production shifts will be 
very difﬁcult to reverse.

CHAPTER 16 — PRODUCTION COSTS
EXERCISES
 1. Kai’s records show that last month he spent $5,000 
on rent for his shop, $3,000 on materials, $3,000 
on wages and beneﬁts for an employee, and $500 
in interest on the loan that he used to start his 
business. He quit a job that had paid him $3,000 a 
month to devote himself full time to this business. 
Suppose that he has to pay the lease on his shop 
and the interest on the loan regardless of whether 
he produces. However, suppose that at any time he 
can change the amount of materials that he buys 
and the hours that his employee works and that 
he can also go back to his old job (perhaps part 
time).
a. What are the accounting costs of operating his 
shop for the month?
b. What are the economic costs?
c. Which types of costs of running his business for 
a month are ﬁxed? Which are variable?
 2. A nonproﬁt organization dedicated to health care 
wants to open a new hospital near a residential 
neighborhood. A group of residents of that neigh-
borhood protests this decision, claiming that trafﬁc 
caused by the hospital will increase noise and auto 
emissions. The hospital rejects the idea of building 
a wall to contain the noise and fumes, claiming

17 Markets Without Power
Chances are that you have heard politicians or media commentators expound on the 
beneﬁts of “free markets.” One of the beneﬁts claimed for free markets is that they result 
in economic efﬁciency—resources are allocated to their highest-valued uses, measured 
using welfare analysis. Behind this political argument is an economic model—a model 
of markets in which no one individual, company, or institution has power over the mar-
ket. Economists call such markets “perfectly competitive.” In this chapter, we discuss 
perfectly competitive markets and the implications of these markets for economic ef-
ﬁciency and equity.
1. UNDERSTANDING MARKET POWER AND COMPETITION
Having power means having the ability to inﬂuence something. Market power is the ability 
to control, or at least affect, the terms and conditions of a market exchange. In this chapter 
and Chapter 18, we consider different types of markets based on the degree of market power 
held by sellers. In this chapter, we consider markets in which sellers, as well as buyers, pos-
sess no market power. In Chapter 18, we consider three types of markets in which sellers do 
possess a degree of market power.
Market power is related to the degree of competition in a market. In most markets, sellers 
compete with other sellers. A very general rule of thumb is that the more competitive a market 
is, the less market power is held by individual sellers. But what exactly do we mean by 
“competition”? As we have seen with other topics, economists’ deﬁnition of competition differs 
from how people commonly use the term. So we brieﬂy discuss four potential deﬁnitions of 
competition and how they relate to market power:
1. competition from the perspective of businesses
2. competition from the perspective of consumers
3. competition from the perspective of citizens
4. competition from the perspective of economists
1.1 THE BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE ON COMPETITION AND MARKET POWER
From the point of view of an individual business, competition is generally a bad thing—
something to be reduced or eliminated. Competition means that other businesses are working 
to reduce your sales and proﬁts. It also means that you have to be very aware of what your 
competitors are charging for their goods and services, and you may have to adjust your prices 
to reﬂect what your competitors are doing.
From the perspective of a business, market power is a good thing. You want to be able to 
inﬂuence people to buy what you are selling. You want to be able to command a high price  
market power: the 
ability to control, or 
at least affect, the 
terms and conditions 
of a market exchange

 
UNDERSTANDING MARKET POWER AND COMPETITION 
369
for what you sell. You want to have the power to bargain for low prices for the resources that you 
buy. You want your business to grow, capturing a large share of the market in which you sell.
1.2 THE CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE ON COMPETITION AND MARKET POWER
To consumers, competition is generally a good thing. Competition among businesses tends 
to drive prices down, making goods and services more affordable to consumers. Many 
consumers like to “shop around” for the lowest prices. Having several competing stores 
(or Internet shopping sites) to choose from means that consumers are more likely to ﬁnd 
bargains. (For more on competition from the perspective of both businesses and consum-
ers, see Box 17.1.)
Consumers generally do not beneﬁt when sellers possess market power. People who live 
in rural areas with just a single local gas station or grocery store will generally pay higher 
prices than people living in urban areas. While the higher prices may partly reﬂect higher 
wholesale costs to sellers, a seller that possesses market power can use that power to charge 
relatively high prices just because the seller knows that consumers must otherwise travel 
long distances to shop elsewhere.
1.3 THE CITIZEN PERSPECTIVE ON COMPETITION AND MARKET POWER
People are both consumers and citizens. Sometimes their goals as consumers may not align 
with their views as concerned citizens. Competition and market power is one such issue. 
BOX 17.1 AMAZON AND MARKET COMPETITION
Amazon is the world’s top online retailer, with 2012 
global revenues of more than $60 billion. In the 
United States, Amazon accounted for 15 percent of all 
e-commerce in 2012. Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, 
has become one of the twenty richest people in the 
world, with a net worth of about $25 billion.
Amazon’s success is based largely on its ability 
to offer a lower price than its competitors, especially 
“brick-and-mortar” competitors that must pay the cost 
of operating physical stores. Consumers beneﬁt from 
Amazon’s low prices, free shipping on many orders, 
and avoiding having to drive to stores.
But Amazon’s price-based competitive advantage 
appears to be slipping. Amazon’s competitors are 
increasingly willing to match, or even beat, Amazon’s 
prices. For example, in July 2013 the online re-
tailer Overstock announced that it would undercut 
Amazon’s book prices by 10 percent. Amazon had 
no choice but to match the price discount. Best Buy 
has a policy of matching Amazon’s price on similar 
items. Moreover, customers can pick up items at local 
Best Buy stores, so they do not have to wait days for 
delivery. In addition, Walmart is increasing its online 
shopping presence, looking to grab market share 
from Amazon.
Bed Bath & Beyond is another competitor that may 
be chipping away at Amazon’s sales. A 2013 price 
survey found that the total cost of a basket of thirty 
items was 6.5 percent cheaper at Bed Bath & Beyond 
than at Amazon. For example, a shower curtain that 
sold for $32.39 at Amazon was priced at $24.99 at 
Bed Bath & Beyond. In addition, Bed Bath & Beyond 
frequently sends its customers coupons for a 20 per-
cent discount, which makes their prices even lower.
Another factor that may hurt Amazon’s ability to offer 
lower prices than its brick-and-mortar competitors is 
that Internet retailers may soon be required to collect 
state sales tax. Previously, Amazon did not charge its 
customers state sales taxes, even for orders delivered 
to states that levy them, giving Amazon a 5–10 percent 
price advantage in those states. However, Amazon 
began to collect state sales tax as early as 2008 for 
orders to New York, and now collects such taxes for 
orders delivered to sixteen states. The Marketplace 
Fairness Act, which would require all Internet retailers 
to collect state sales taxes, has passed the U.S. Senate, 
but has not yet been voted on by the full Congress as of 
this book’s publication. Because of changing laws and 
increasing competition, Amazon may no longer be the 
dominant retailing force that it has been in the past.

CHAPTER 17 — MARKETS WITHOUT POWER
While consumers generally approve of competition because it tends to lead to lower prices, 
as concerned citizens they may perceive competition as the cause of undesirable social and 
environmental impacts. For example, consumers may support the construction of a new sub-
urban “big box” store in their town because it will increase consumer choice and offer low 
prices. But others may oppose the store, on the basis that it will harm the environment, hurt 
“mom-and-pop” stores, and reduce the vitality of a downtown area.
Concerned citizens may also worry about businesses that cite the “need to stay competitive” 
as their reason for eliminating jobs, taking over smaller companies, refusing to implement 
voluntary pollution controls, or moving their production overseas, all of which are perceived 
as harmful. From the point of view of a concerned citizen, neither market power nor tooth-
and-nail competition serves the interests of a peaceful and humane society. Many concerned 
citizens would prefer to see markets based on decentralized power, along with ethical and 
cooperative behavior that serves the common good.
Many citizens view market power primarily in terms of the size and ﬁnancial clout of 
large corporations. They believe that “big business” disproportionately inﬂuences public 
policy to obtain tax breaks, subsidies, or exemption from environmental regulations. 
They cite examples of big businesses acting callously or unethically, raising prices on 
goods that people need, forcing workers to accept low wages, or intimidating people 
with lawsuits.
1.4 THE ECONOMISTS’ PERSPECTIVE ON COMPETITION AND MARKET POWER
Some economists view competition and market power through the lens of traditional welfare 
analysis. From this perspective, competition is generally a good thing (and market power 
can be a bad thing) because competition tends to increase the social welfare of a market. To 
an economist, the term “competitive market” does not imply the use of cutthroat or illegal 
policies. Instead, it is shorthand for the case in which so many buyers and sellers interact in 
a market that none are able to exercise signiﬁcant market power. The fact that a competitor 
is always trying to take away your customers or your workers is what keeps you on your 
toes and makes you run your organization efﬁciently. Competition, to an economist, means 
decentralized power. The image of a self-regulating, “free” competitive market is at the core 
of traditional neoclassical economics.
As a social science, economics tends to make normative judgments from the point of 
view of social efﬁciency, not just from the perspective of one particular actor. The traditional 
neoclassical view, focused almost entirely on efﬁciency goals, notes that market power can 
create inefﬁciency. (We demonstrate this in Chapter 18.) Hence it considers market power 
largely harmful, except in certain unavoidable cases.
But as we have learned in other chapters, a complete economic analysis needs to consider 
all costs and beneﬁts, not just those that accrue to market participants. In particular, we should 
consider social and environmental externalities. If competition drives businesses to treat their 
workers poorly or ignore environmental and safety regulations, these costs must be considered 
when we evaluate the extent to which an unregulated market leads to an efﬁcient outcome. 
As economists, we may also be concerned about whether competitive markets lead to just 
outcomes, based on normative views of fairness.
Discussion Questions
1. To which of the four views of market power and competition do you most relate? Do you 
think all four views are valid, or is one particular view more worthwhile or “correct” than 
the others?
2. Can you think of an example of an economic actor that is not a business ﬁrm but that has 
“market power” in the sense deﬁned in the text?

 
PERFECT COMPETITION 
371
2. PERFECT COMPETITION
The economic model of perfect competition relies on particular assumptions and leads to 
certain conclusions about how ﬁrms will behave and what proﬁts they can make.
2.1 THE CONDITIONS OF PERFECT COMPETITION
The model of perfect competition is based on four key assumptions about a market:
1. There are numerous small sellers and buyers. Each buyer and seller is so small relative 
to the size of the relevant market that none can affect the market price.
2. Within any particular market, only one kind of good or service is traded and all units of 
the good or service offered for sale are identical. Therefore, buyers will not care which 
ﬁrm they buy from and will make purchasing decisions based solely on price.
3. Producers of the good or service can freely enter or exit the industry. There are no barriers 
preventing a new ﬁrm from joining the market or preventing an existing one from leaving 
the market.
4. Buyers and sellers all have perfect information. They all know where the good is avail-
able, at what prices it is offered, and whether proﬁts are being made.
Another assumption is that the long-run minimum efﬁcient scale (which we discussed in 
Chapter 16) of a producer in this industry is fairly small, relative to total demand in the market. 
In other words, production is characterized by constant returns to scale, not by economies of 
scale. This is important because, if it were not the case, the market might not be large enough 
for the many efﬁcient ﬁrms assumed by the theory.
In a perfectly competitive market, every individual seller is a price taker, which means 
that each seller has no market power and price is determined by the interaction of market 
supply and demand. As each seller is relatively small, each can basically sell all they want to 
at the going price. But if they raise their price even just a little above the market-determined 
price, no one will buy from them because consumers can purchase identical items for a lower 
price from their competitors.
Being a price taker means that you face a perfectly elastic demand curve, as we discussed 
in Chapter 5. This is shown in Figure 17.1. A seller can sell all it wants at the market price 
of P*. At any price above P*, however, it will sell nothing. There is also no reason to sell at 
any price below P* because it can sell as much as it wants at P*.
Note that the market demand curve in a perfectly competitive market has the normal 
downward slope. Each individual seller faces a perfectly elastic demand curve, but the demand 
curve for the market as a whole will be less elastic, or perhaps inelastic.

But at any price higher than the

CHAPTER 17 — MARKETS WITHOUT POWER
2.2 EXAMPLES OF PERFECT COMPETITION?
Examples of perfectly competitive markets in the real world are hard to come by. In older text-
books, agricultural commodities such as wheat were often given as examples of goods traded in 
perfectly competitive markets. It was argued that one farmer’s wheat, of a given type, was nearly 
identical to the wheat of the same type sold by other farmers. Further, no individual farmer had 
any perceptible inﬂuence on the market price. However, in industrialized countries, agricultural 
markets today tend to be highly organized and regulated, with farmer-supported marketing boards, 
government-guaranteed minimum prices, long-term contracts, and the like deliberately inﬂuenc-
ing the terms and conditions of the market. Further (as discussed in Chapter 18), some large 
agricultural corporations, such as Monsanto and Cargill, possess signiﬁcant market power.
Perhaps the markets that most closely approach perfect competition today are not markets 
for goods but certain ﬁnancial resale markets. For example, the conditions that prevail in the 
stock market often approximate those of perfect competition. The shares of stock of a particular 
company are all identical. Because this is a ﬁnancial resale market, the cost of “production” 
is irrelevant, so there are no barriers to entry. Well-deﬁned stock exchanges set up a structure 
under which the going price becomes common knowledge. When many shares of stock are 
outstanding, the trading of a few shares does not perceptibly affect the share price. If you own 
a few shares of stock and think about selling them, your broker will quote you a price—take 
it or leave it. The demand curve that you face, as an individual seller, is horizontal.
In some labor markets as well, conditions may approximate perfect competition. Workers 
with general skills, such as ﬂipping burgers or sweeping ﬂoors, may provide nearly identical 
services from an employer’s point of view. When there are many such “sellers,” they may 
ﬁnd that they have a choice of a job at “the going wage” or no job at all.
Discussion Questions
1. Suppose that you are thinking of starting your own business. Would you want to start a 
business in a perfectly competitive market? What do you think are the advantages and 
disadvantages of selling in a perfectly competitive market?
2. In addition to the markets mentioned in this section, can you think of any other markets 
that meet the assumptions of perfect competition?
3. PROFIT MAXIMIZATION UNDER PERFECT COMPETITION
We now consider the production decisions of perfectly competitive sellers. Although a perfectly 
competitive seller can theoretically sell all he wants, in practice a seller will limit production to 
maximize his proﬁts. We illustrate proﬁt maximization by building on the corn farming example 
that we developed in Chapter 16. We assume that corn farming occurs in a perfectly competi-
tive market. Even though this may not be a totally realistic assumption, it allows us to illustrate 
the production decisions of a perfectly competitive seller. We present a more formal model of 
production decisions in a perfectly competitive market in the appendix to this chapter.
3.1 REVENUES
In Chapter 16, we discussed production costs. We now consider revenues—the money that 
sellers receive from their sales. Assuming that all units sell for the same price, total revenues 
are simply equal to price multiplied by quantity. So if the price of corn were $4 per bushel 
and a farmer sold 1,000 bushels of corn, her total revenues would be $4,000.*
We can now deﬁne proﬁts as the difference between total revenues and total costs. But 
recall from Chapter 16 that we have two different deﬁnitions of costs—accounting costs 
and economic costs. The difference is that economic costs include all opportunity costs, 
total revenues: 
the total amount of 
money received by a 
seller, equal to price 
times quantity
*This was approximately the actual price of corn at the time that this book was written.

 
PROFIT MAXIMIZATION UNDER PERFECT COMPETITION 
373
such as the wages that one could potentially earn doing something else. Comparably, we 
also have two deﬁnitions of proﬁts. Accounting proﬁts are calculated as the difference 
between total revenues and accounting costs. Economic proﬁts are the difference between 
total revenues and economic costs. Accounting proﬁts are higher than economic proﬁts, 
because economic costs are higher than accounting costs. Note that it is entirely possible 
for a seller to make a positive accounting proﬁt, but no economic proﬁt, or even a negative 
proﬁt (i.e., a loss).
The standard neoclassical model of perfect competition assumes that each seller seeks 
to maximize his or her proﬁts. In the numerical model that we present here, we assume that 
costs mean economic costs, and thus proﬁts are economic proﬁts. We will see that economic 
proﬁts are an important concept in the traditional model of perfect competition.
We also need to deﬁne marginal revenue, which is the additional revenue obtained by selling 
one more unit. In a perfectly competitive market, marginal revenue is simply the market price. So 
if the price of corn is $4 per bushel, the marginal revenue from selling one more bushel is simply 
$4. In Chapter 18, we consider markets in which the marginal revenue is not equal to price.
We can represent total revenues graphically, as shown in Figure 17.2. The total revenue 
curve is a straight line because marginal revenue is constant at $4 per bushel. So if a farmer 
sells 100 bushels of corn, for example, total revenues will be $400; if she sells 140 bushels 
of corn, total revenues will be $560.

Total revenues increase linearly with 
the quantity sold given that the price 
for each unit (in this case, bushels 
of corn) is constant in a perfectly 
competitive market. 
3.2 PROFIT MAXIMIZATION EXAMPLE
Continuing with our corn farming example, we need to determine the level of corn produc-
tion that will result in the maximum proﬁt. To compile Table 17.1, we can combine our 
information from Chapter 15 about production costs with the fact that corn sells for $4 per 
bushel. We have calculated the proﬁt (or loss) of each level of corn production, based on 
different levels of fertilizer application. Note that Table 17.1 repeats the information from 
Table 16.4, but adds a total revenue and proﬁt column. As discussed above, we assume 
that the ﬁxed cost of $500 per acre is an economic cost, including both accounting and 
opportunity costs.
We see that the farmer’s proﬁts are maximized at a production level of 154 bushels per 
acre, applying 6 bags of fertilizer per acre. At this point, economic proﬁts are $26 per acre. 
Any other level of production results in lower (or negative) proﬁts.

374 
CHAPTER 17 — MARKETS WITHOUT POWER
Proﬁt maximization can be shown graphically as the difference between total revenues and 
total costs, as shown in Figure 17.3. In this ﬁgure we have combined Figure 17.2, showing 
total revenues, with our total cost curve from Figure 16.4. The vertical distance between 
the total revenue curve and the total cost curve represents proﬁts. This vertical distance is 
greatest, and proﬁts are maximized, at 154 bushels per acre.
In addition to determining the proﬁt-maximizing level of production using a table or a 
graph of total revenues and total costs, we can also use marginal analysis. Recall that in 
Chapter 16 we calculated the marginal cost of producing one more bushel of corn at each 
level of fertilizer application (Table 16.5). We repeat this table here as Table 17.2, with the 
addition of one more column to the right indicating the marginal revenue from selling corn, 
which is constant at $4 per bushel.
Marginal analysis tells us that it makes economic sense to do something as long as the 
marginal beneﬁts are greater than the marginal costs. So the farmer’s question is whether it 
makes economic sense to add each bag of fertilizer. As long as the marginal revenues exceed

the marginal costs the farmer should keeping adding fertilizer, because proﬁts are increasing. 
So, for example, we can see that adding the third bag of fertilizer increases proﬁts because the 
marginal cost, measured in dollars per bushel of corn, is $1.33 while the marginal revenues 
per bushel are $4.00.
Marginal revenues exceed marginal cost for every production level up to six bags of 
fertilizer. For the seventh bag of fertilizer, the marginal cost of $5 exceeds the marginal 
revenue of $4. By adding the seventh bag of fertilizer, the farmer loses money. So the proﬁt-
maximizing level of fertilizer application is six bags, at which the farmer produces 154 bushels 
of corn per acre. This is the same answer that we obtained previously based on tabular and 
graphical analysis of total costs and revenues.
We can also illustrate proﬁt maximization using a graph of marginal costs and marginal 
revenues, shown in Figure 17.4. We see that marginal revenue is constant at $4 per bushel. 
The marginal cost of corn production is increasing, as we discussed in Chapter 16. The

CHAPTER 17 — MARKETS WITHOUT POWER
proﬁt-maximizing level of corn production is 154 bushels, again up to the point where the 
marginal revenue equals marginal cost.
We can now state the general rule for proﬁt maximization under perfect competition: 
A seller should increase production up to the point where marginal revenues equal marginal 
costs, commonly expressed as MR = MC. Given that marginal revenue is always equal to price 
under perfect competition, we can also state that proﬁt maximizing means setting P = MC.
3.3 PROFITS UNDER PERFECT COMPETITION
In Table 17.1 we found that at the proﬁt-maximizing level of production (154 bushels of corn 
per acre), the farmer is making $26 per acre in proﬁts. Recall that this is an economic proﬁt. 
Although this may not sound like much, a farmer may have many acres, perhaps hundreds, in 
corn production. Also, as an economic proﬁt, this means that farming is providing a better income 
than any other opportunity, such as working as a police ofﬁcer or an administrative assistant.
We now ask an important question: Can economic proﬁts persist under perfect competition? 
The answer is no, based on the assumptions of perfect competition. Speciﬁcally:
s  With free entry and exit, anyone can easily become a farmer, switching from any other 
profession.*
s  With perfect information, everyone is aware that farming is providing higher proﬁts than 
other opportunities.
s  Another implication of perfect information is that everyone has access to information that 
will allow him or her to produce corn as efﬁciently as possible (i.e., at the lowest cost).
s  All bushels of corn are identical, so anyone producing corn can sell as much as he or she 
wants at the market price.
Thus the existence of economic proﬁts in our idealized picture of corn production will attract 
some people to switch what they are doing and take up corn farming. We assume that this will not 
affect the costs of corn farming—the costs remain the same as in Tables 17.1 and 17.2. However, 
the inﬂux of new farmers increases the market supply of corn. In other words, at any given corn 
price, more corn will be supplied because more farmers are growing corn, as illustrated in Figure 
17.5. The original market equilibrium, with a corn price of $4.00 per bushel, is E0. As more 
farmers enter the market, the supply curve shifts to the right, moving from Supply0 to Supply1. 
With the increase in supply, the market price falls from $4.00 per bushel to a lower price, P1.
proﬁt maximiza-
tion (under perfect 
competition): a 
seller should increase 
production up to the 
point where MR = 
MC. As MR = P under 
perfect competition, 
we can also deﬁne 
the proﬁt maximizing 
solution by setting  
P = MC.
*Of course, becoming a corn farmer is not “free”—it normally requires training and signiﬁcant investment in land and 
equipment. But, as in any economic model, we are abstracting from reality to illustrate a point.
Figure 17.5 The Impact of an Increase in Supply as Farmers Enter the Corn Market
An increase in supply, as more 
farmers enter the market, will lower 
the equilibrium price (from $4.00 
per bushel to P 1) and increase the 
quantity sold.

PROFIT MAXIMIZATION UNDER PERFECT COMPETITION

Our next question becomes: How much will supply increase? Or, given that the equilibrium 
price will vary depending on how much supply shifts, what will P1 eventually be?
Note that as the price of corn falls below $4.00 per bushel, each farmer’s proﬁts will fall. 
Thus the increase in supply reduces the amount of economic proﬁts made by each farmer. 
But as long as economic proﬁts exist, even if they are small, farming is still more attractive 
than all other opportunities. Thus as long as economic proﬁts exist, entry of new farmers into 
the market will continue.
As each new farmer enters the market, three things will happen simultaneously:
1. The market supply curve shifts a little further to the right.
2. The market price falls a little further.
3. Economic proﬁts for each farmer become a little lower.
We can illustrate what is happening in the market as a whole and for each individual farmer 
by putting the market supply and demand graph next to our graph of marginal costs and 
revenues for an individual farmer, as shown in Figure 17.6. Each farmer’s marginal revenue 
curve is equal to price (a horizontal line), which is determined by market conditions (i.e., 
market supply and demand). When more farmers enter the market, shifting the supply curve 
from Supply0 to Supply1, each farmer’s marginal revenue curve falls from MR0 to MR1. Each 
farmer’s proﬁt-maximizing level of production is still where MR = MC. So each farmer will 
respond to the decrease in price by shifting production from point A to point B. At the lower 
price, each farmer is making a smaller proﬁt.
Eventually, we will reach a point where price falls enough that economic proﬁts fall to zero. 
At this point, farming is equally attractive to the next best alternative, and there is no incentive 
for further entry to the market. In other words, under the assumptions of perfect competition, 
economic proﬁts will eventually fall to zero. We call this the perfectly competitive market 
equilibrium. At this market equilibrium, there is no further incentive for entry or exit.
It is important to remember that even though economic proﬁts are zero at the perfectly 
competitive market equilibrium, each farmer is still making an accounting proﬁt. For every 
bushel of corn up to point B in Figure 17.6, marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost. 
So each farmer is making an accounting proﬁt on every bushel of corn up to point B. Perfect 
competition drives economic proﬁts to zero, but not accounting proﬁts.
We can ask one ﬁnal question based on our corn farming example: What is P1, the price that 
will eventually drive economic proﬁts to zero? Algebraically solving for P1 requires more math 
than we cover in this book, but you can solve for P1 with some trial and error. You would calculate 
total revenues in Table 17.1 based on successively lower corn prices until the maximum attainable 
perfectly competi-
tive market equi-
librium: the market 
equilibrium in a 
perfectly competitive 
market in which the 
economic proﬁts of 
each individual seller 
are zero, and there is 
no incentive for entry 
or exit

As more farmers enter the market,

economic proﬁts of each individual 
farmer will decrease.

CHAPTER 17 — MARKETS WITHOUT POWER
proﬁt equals zero. For example, if the corn price were $3.90 per bushel instead of $4.00, 154 
bushels of corn would sell for $600.60 (instead of $616.00). This is still higher than the total cost 
of $590, so an economic proﬁt is still being made. Thus price at the perfectly competitive market 
equilibrium must be lower than $3.90. The solution for the perfectly competitive equilibrium price 
is slightly more than $3.83 per bushel. At this price, 154 bushels would sell for exactly $590, total 
revenues would equal total costs, and economic proﬁts would be zero.*
Discussion Questions
1. Explain, in your words without a table or a graph, why economic proﬁts fall to zero in a 
perfectly competitive market.
2. How useful do you think the model of a perfectly competitive market presented in this 
section is in explaining economic behavior in the real world? What do you think is the 
most relevant insight from the model? 
4. LOSSES AND EXIT
In our corn example, each farmer is always making an accounting proﬁt, even at the 
perfectly competitive market equilibrium. But in the real world, sometimes businesses 
do lose money and may even decide to shut down production and exit a market. In this 
section, we consider how a seller will behave when it is accruing losses rather than mak-
ing a proﬁt.**
4.1. LOSSES IN THE SHORT RUN
Let’s suppose that the price of corn decreased to $3.60 per bushel, perhaps due to a decrease 
in the demand for corn. We can see how this affects an individual farmer by looking at Table 
17.3. This is the same as Table 17.1 except that total revenues are now calculated based on 
a corn price of $3.60 per bushel instead of $4.00 per bushel. The ﬁxed and variable costs of 
corn production have stayed the same.
We see that at the lower corn price, the “proﬁt-maximizing” level of corn production, now 
at 150 bushels per acre with ﬁve bags of fertilizer, is actually a loss. The best that the farmer 
can do is to lose $35 per acre!
 *Note that in this particular example, the proﬁt-maximizing level of production under the perfectly competitive market 
equilibrium remains 154 bushels of corn. However, as shown in Figure 17.6, the movement from point A to point B will 
generally result in a decrease in the optimal production level for each farmer. If we conducted this analysis such that farmers 
could add partial bags of fertilizer, then movement from point A to point B would result in a slight decrease in fertilizer 
application and thus a slight decrease in corn production per acre.
**In this section, we are still referring to economic, rather than accounting, losses.

LOSSES AND EXIT 
379
Would it ever make sense for a farmer to stay in business when she is losing money? We 
know in the real world that businesses frequently lose money temporarily, only to make proﬁts 
later. During the Great Recession in 2007–9, many businesses lost money, including banks 
and auto manufacturers. While some did go out of business, others survived and eventually 
returned to proﬁtability.
Thus a farmer’s decision comes down to whether she is willing and able to accept temporary 
losses, with the hope of making proﬁts in the future, or quit farming. To understand how a rational 
farmer will behave, we have to recall, from Chapter 16, the distinction between the short run and 
the long run. In the short run, at least one input is ﬁxed in quantity, and thus the cost of paying 
for any ﬁxed inputs must be paid regardless of production levels. In the long run, all inputs are 
variable, and thus a seller can avoid paying all costs simply by leaving the market.
In our corn example, the ﬁxed cost of $500 must be paid in the short term, regardless of 
the level of corn production. Even if the farmer decides to produce no corn, she must still pay 
this ﬁxed cost. So the farmer’s short-term production decision comes down to two options:
1. continue to produce some corn, even at a loss
2. produce no corn at all, and just pay the ﬁxed costs
Table 17.3 shows that at 150 bushels of corn (the best the farmer can do), the farmer loses 
$35 per acre—total costs are $575, and total revenues are $540. Her other option is to not 
produce any corn. In this case, she will still have to pay her ﬁxed cost of $500 per acre. She 
avoids having to pay any variable costs, but she also receives no revenues. So her losses will 
be $500 per acre if she produces no corn.
Obviously, it is better to lose only $35 per acre than to lose $500 per acre. By producing 
some corn, rather than none, she is able to more than cover her variable costs, recovering 
a large portion of her ﬁxed costs as well. In other words, as long as she is able to cover her 
variable costs, in the short term it makes economic sense to continue production, even if 
losses are occurring.
A surprising implication of this conclusion is that it does not matter how big the ﬁxed 
costs are. As long as there is something left over, after variable costs are paid, to go toward 
paying the ﬁxed costs—whatever they may be—the farmer should continue to produce corn. 
Whether the ﬁxed costs are $500 per acre or $5,000 per acre does not matter. You can prove 
this to yourself by calculating that the farmer does better by producing 150 bushels of corn 
and losing $4,535 per acre than by not producing and losing $5,000 per acre. The same would 
be true even if ﬁxed costs were $1 million per acre!
This is a speciﬁc example of a more general economic principle concerning production 
decisions. Sunk costs should not affect short-run production decisions. A sunk cost is a cost 
that, in the short run, is the proverbial “water over the dam.” The expense has already been 
incurred (or committed to) and cannot be reversed.
This principle often seems to contradict common sense. Humans seem to have an illogical 
but psychologically strong tendency to want to make past investments “pay off.” And the 
larger the past investment, the more likely people are to be inﬂuenced by sunk costs. This 
is true not only of production decisions but of economic behavior in general. This is yet 
another example of seemingly irrational economic behavior, as we discussed in Chapter 
8. Economics teaches us that when making decisions, we should focus on what is the best 
decision for us now and that past investment is irrelevant. (For some examples of how sunk 
costs can inﬂuence economic behavior, see Box 17.2.)
4.2 LOSSES IN THE LONG RUN
In the long run, all costs are variable. So in the long run the farmer can avoid having to pay 
the short-run ﬁxed cost of $500 per acre simply by exiting the corn market. The farmer can 
sunk cost: an ex-
penditure that was 
incurred or commit-
ted to in the past and 
is irreversible in the 
short run

CHAPTER 17 — MARKETS WITHOUT POWER
sell her land and machinery and take up a different profession. In a perfectly competitive 
market, or any market, short-term losses may be rational, but in the long run exit becomes 
preferable to losing money.
Again, human behavior may be more complicated than this, and exiting a market may 
be a difﬁcult decision. For example, the decision to sell a farm that has been in a family for 
generations may involve more than ﬁnancial factors. Selling the farm, say to a developer, 
may also create negative externalities, such as the loss of wildlife habitat. What is optimal 
for an individual seller may not be optimal for social welfare. In some cases where farms 
are losing money, it may be better from a social welfare perspective to subsidize the farmer 
so that she does not feel compelled to sell to a developer.
Discussion Questions
1. “Why would anyone run a business if he couldn’t make a proﬁt?” This is a frequent 
response to economists’ idea that all ﬁrms in a particular market make zero “economic 
proﬁts.”
a. In your own words, explain what economists mean by zero economic proﬁts and why 
an entrepreneur would choose to operate a perfectly competitive business.
b. Explain why perfectly competitive ﬁrms are assumed to make zero economic proﬁts 
in the long run.
2. Suppose that you are halfway through a particular course and you decide that you are not 
learning anything useful and the rest of the course is not worth your effort (obviously we 
are not describing this course!). It is too late to drop the course and sign up for another 
one. Is this an example of a sunk cost? How does economics suggest that you decide 
whether to complete the course?
BOX 17.2 SUNK COSTS AND DECISION MAKING
Suppose that you have paid $50 in advance for a ticket 
to a concert. Assume that the ticket is nonrefundable 
and nontransferable. In other words, it is a sunk cost. 
But suppose that there is a blizzard the night of the con-
cert, and traveling there would be miserable. Faced with 
a simple choice between relaxing at home and heading 
out into the blizzard to go to the concert, assume that 
you would prefer to stay home. But you have already 
paid $50 for the concert ticket. What do you do?
According to economic logic, the sunk cost of $50 
should be irrelevant to your decision. What should matter 
is which option is the best choice for you now. But surveys 
show that many people are swayed by sunk costs and 
that the amount of the sunk cost matters. Now, suppose 
instead that you had won the concert ticket in a contest 
rather than paying $50 for it. Would that affect your 
decision? According to economic logic, it shouldn’t.
It seems that people create “psychological ac-
counts” in their heads about different expenditures, 
which can inﬂuence their decisions. Consider the 
following example from a paper published by Daniel 
Kahneman and his colleague Amos Tversky (recall that 
we discussed them in Chapter 8). First, suppose that 
you are going to see a play and the tickets cost $10. 
As you enter the theater, you discover that you have 
lost a $10 bill. Do you still pay $10 for a ticket? Their 
survey results indicate that 82 percent of respondents 
would still buy a ticket. Most people viewed the loss 
of $10 as belonging to a different “account” than the 
one used to pay for the ticket.
However, imagine that you have already paid 
$10 for a ticket and you discover as you enter the 
theater that you have lost the ticket. Do you pay $10 
for another ticket? In this case, only about half of re-
spondents would buy another ticket. In this case, many 
people consider buying another ticket equivalent to 
paying $20 for a ticket, and thus overpaying.
In either case, $10 is a sunk cost—you either lost 
a $10 bill or you already paid $10 for a ticket. So 
the decision in either case as you enter the theater is 
whether you should pay a marginal $10 to see the 
play. But how the sunk cost is presented to people 
does have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on their answer. As 
usual, human behavior is complicated and context 
does matter.

PRODUCTION, EFFICIENCY, AND EQUITY 
381
5. PRODUCTION, EFFICIENCY, AND EQUITY
One of the implications of the perfectly competitive market model is that each ﬁrm must act 
in an economically efﬁcient manner. As economic proﬁts are assumed to be zero in the long 
run, any ﬁrm that operates in an inefﬁcient manner will make negative economic proﬁts. In 
the long run, inefﬁcient ﬁrms will thus be forced out of the market.
But in the real world, inefﬁciencies may be quite common, even in markets that approach 
the conditions of perfect competition. We next consider two types of inefﬁciencies that may 
exist in any market. Then we end this chapter with a discussion of efﬁciency and equity in 
perfectly competitive markets.
5.1 PATH DEPENDENCE
Path dependence, a term borrowed from mathematics, basically means that “history matters” 
in determining how production technologies—and even entire economies—develop. When 
a process is path dependent, the way in which it develops may depend crucially on “initial 
conditions” and past events. The present state of manufactured capital or human capital, for 
example, can be thought of as making up part of the initial conditions for current production 
decisions.
Agriculture offers a good example of path dependence. For example, in the western part of 
Germany farms tend to be relatively small, but in the eastern part of Germany farms tend to be 
much larger. The explanation has nothing to do with a difference in the minimum efﬁcient scale in 
the two regions. Instead, it is a result of history—until 1990 Germany was split into two countries, 
and in East Germany farms were organized by the government as large collectives.1
Another agricultural example of path dependence concerns the allocation of water 
rights in the western United States.2 To promote agricultural development in the West, 
water rights were allocated under the “prior appropriation doctrine,” which states that 
the ﬁrst person to establish any beneﬁcial use of a given quantity of water obtains the 
right to that quantity of water in the future. Other water users who come later may also 
obtain water rights by establishing beneﬁcial uses, but they are able to access water only 
after the demands of all “senior” water rights holders, who established rights before 
them, have been met.
The allocation of water under the prior appropriation doctrine is based on history, not 
economic efﬁciency. As water demands have increased in the West, economists have 
advocated for the establishment of water markets that would allow water rights holders to 
trade water, theoretically allocating water to more efﬁcient uses. However, the efﬁciency 
gains from water trading have been much smaller than predicted, as many water rights 
holders have been concerned that if they do not put their water to beneﬁcial uses, but trade 
it instead, they may lose their rights. Even worse, prior appropriation encourages inefﬁcient 
water use because it basically means “use it or lose it.” So, rather than adopt efﬁcient 
irrigation techniques and risk losing some of their water rights, farmers may continue to 
rely on inefﬁcient practices.
Historical evidence suggests that health care in the United States also developed in a 
path-dependent fashion, rather than an economically efﬁcient manner.3 As part of the New 
Deal legislation in the 1930s, President Franklin Roosevelt supported universal public health-
insurance coverage, but it was defeated in Congress. Then during World War II wage controls 
were implemented that prevented businesses from increasing wages. To attract workers while 
being unable to offer higher wages, some ﬁrms began to offer health-insurance coverage as a 
fringe beneﬁt. Labor unions then began to demand health-insurance coverage from employers. 
As employer-provided health insurance became more common, interest in universal health 
care faded. The United States now spends more than any other country on health care, as a 
percentage of GDP, yet many of its health outcomes are rather mediocre. We discuss health 
care in the United States in more detail in Chapter 18.
path dependence: 
a condition that ex-
ists when economic 
developments depend 
on initial conditions 
and past events—
that is, when “history 
matters”

382 
CHAPTER 17 — MARKETS WITHOUT POWER
5.2 NETWORK EXTERNALITIES
In addition to taking place in a historical context, production decisions also take place within 
a rich social context. Many technologies, such as standards for computers, automobiles, and 
kitchen appliance sizes, are widely shared. A production technology is characterized by a network 
eternality if people are more likely to adopt it, the more other people have adopted it.
A common example of a network externality is the widespread use of Microsoft Windows 
operating systems on personal computers (PCs). Although other operating systems, such as 
Linux and Macintosh, exist and offer some advantages, the vast majority of users have a 
computer with a Windows operating system mainly because that is what other users have 
adopted. The dominance of Windows is also an example of path dependence, because of the 
history in which Microsoft was able to gain a strong initial position in the PC market after 
it established a partnership with IBM in the 1980s. (Another interesting question, likely 
explained in part due to network externalities, is why students are much more likely than 
professors to use Macs.)
A network externality is a type of “positive feedback” loop—the more that people adopt 
a given technology, the more likely it is that additional people will adopt that technology. In 
the case of Microsoft Windows, as it became more common, more software and computers 
were designed for Windows. This makes it even more difﬁcult for a new operating system 
to gain market share, even if it is more efﬁcient.
Suppose that you develop an alternative to Windows that is superior in many respects. Most 
users will not adopt your operating system until they believe that a lot of software that they 
need will be written for it, that upgrades will be available in the future, and that they will be 
able to communicate easily with others. But none of this can be assured until your invention 
has been widely adopted across a whole network of users. Your problem is that in order to 
gain widespread adoption, you must already have it! Unless you are in a position to create a 
widespread network out of nothing—perhaps, for example, by blanketing the country with free 
software and training—your technically superior invention will not be adopted broadly.
A similar problem exists for a city that is trying to increase the use of public transportation 
in order to decrease road congestion and pollution. If most of the people in the city use the 
public transportation system, as in New York City and many European cities, it will seem like 
a normal thing to do, residential and workplace location patterns will reﬂect the availability 
of public transportation, the buses and subways will run frequently, and service may be so 
good that people freely choose it over using a private car. By contrast, if few people use public 
transportation, it may be stigmatized, routes and services will (in the absence of massive 
subsidies) tend to be very limited and inconvenient, residences and workplaces will tend to 
sprawl, and thus ridership will be further discouraged.
Network externalities create another way in which rational decision making by individuals 
can lead to inefﬁcient production processes and a failure to maximize long-run social welfare. 
(See Box 17.3 for another example of path dependence and network externalities.)
5.3 MARKETS, EFFICIENCY, AND EQUITY
A perfectly competitive market is, under certain assumptions, economically efﬁcient accord-
ing to welfare analysis (as discussed in Chapter 6). In theory, if nothing prevents a perfectly 
competitive market from reaching equilibrium then the sum of consumer and producer surplus 
is maximized. However, this equilibrium is economically efﬁcient only if:
1. There are no positive or negative externalities associated with the production and consumption 
of the good or service, including externalities that might occur in the future. As we discussed 
in Chapter 13, externalities may be pervasive, in terms of environmental or social effects.
2. All buyers and sellers have perfect information, or at least the ability to correctly determine 
when the marginal beneﬁts of acquiring additional information become smaller than the 
network external-
ity (in production): 
a situation in which a 
particular technology 
or production pro-
cess is more likely to 
be adopted because 
other economic ac-
tors have already 
adopted it

 
PRODUCTION, EFFICIENCY, AND EQUITY 
383
marginal costs. As we discussed in Chapter 8, information is often lacking, even inten-
tionally distorted to serve other economic interests, and economic actors often behave in 
ways that are inconsistent with the assumption of perfect information.
3. Consumer demand curves, based on willingness to pay, accurately reﬂect the beneﬁts 
consumers obtain from their purchases. As we saw in Chapter 9, consumers often fail to 
accurately predict the beneﬁts of goods and services.
So a market that meets all the conditions of perfect competition may still fail to maximize 
social and individual welfare if these additional conditions are not satisﬁed. Further, our 
analysis of perfect competition says nothing about whether the market outcome is considered 
equitable. An appealing feature of perfectly competitive markets to most economists is that 
they force ﬁrms to be efﬁcient in their production decisions. As we mentioned at the start of 
this section, all perfectly competitive ﬁrms must be efﬁcient or face going out of business. 
This production efﬁciency also ensures that consumers are offered the lowest possible prices. 
But the constant competitive pressure on ﬁrms can lead to job cuts and other cost-minimizing 
decisions that create social disruptions and externalities. For example, a perfectly competitive 
ﬁrm may try to temporarily capture positive economic proﬁts by ignoring pollution regulations, 
increasing the negative externalities they impose on society.
Moving beyond a single perfectly competitive market, economists have proven that an 
entire economy that consists only of perfectly competitive markets will have an efﬁcient 
allocation of all resources, without any government regulation.* This conclusion, which 
requires a complex mathematical proof, has been used by some economists to support limiting 
government involvement in markets.
Although no economy consists entirely of perfectly competitive markets, any movement 
toward the perfectly competitive ideal would seem to generally increase economic efﬁciency. 
However, this is not necessarily the case. In the 1950s the economists R.G. Lipsey and Kelvin 
BOX 17.3 THE QWERTY KEYBOARD
A classic example of path dependency is the layout of 
typewriters and computer keyboards. The conventional 
QWERTY layout, named for the ﬁrst several letters 
in the top left row, was developed in the nineteenth 
century and rapidly became the norm throughout 
the English-speaking world. The QWERTY layout 
was actually designed to slow down typing in order 
to prevent the keys from jamming on old-fashioned 
typewriters!
Studies with modern typewriters and computer 
keyboards have shown that the QWERTY layout is 
far from the most efﬁcient. Alternative keyboard 
designs have been developed that, with sufﬁcient 
practice, increase typing speeds and reduce errors. 
For example, the “Dvorak Simpliﬁed Keyboard,” 
patented in the 1930s, groups common letter 
combinations together to reduce awkward ﬁnger 
movements. Also, based on the usage rates of dif-
ferent letters, about 70 percent of key strokes occur 
on the row of letters where people commonly rest 
their ﬁngers, making it more ergonomic. However, 
efforts to market an alternative keyboard layout 
have consistently failed.
The major reason for the failure of alternatives 
to the QWERTY layout is that it has historically been 
built into an interlinked, economy-wide structure of 
equipment and training. Ofﬁce equipment manu-
facturers are all set up to produce it. Keyboarding 
classes all teach it. A shift to a more efﬁcient layout 
would entail substantial costs in time and money, 
even though long-run efﬁciency gains could be 
achieved.
In sum, you type on a QWERTY keyboard not 
because it is the most efﬁcient layout but because of 
a historical quirk and the fact that everyone else is 
using it.

CHAPTER 17 — MARKETS WITHOUT POWER
Lancaster demonstrated that any deviation from the perfectly competitive economy-wide 
ideal—even a slight deviation in a single market—may require government intervention 
in many markets to achieve the best possible outcome from the standpoint of economic 
efﬁciency.*
In the real world, the vast majority of markets in any economy are not perfectly competitive. 
Thus basing economic policy suggestions on an assumption of perfectly competitive markets 
is questionable, to say the least. Further, policy suggestions that focus exclusively on 
economic efﬁciency as a ﬁnal goal, while ignoring other ﬁnal goals such as environmental 
sustainability, fairness, and good social relations, are unlikely to be in the best interest of 
overall well-being.
So while our analysis of perfectly competitive markets is a useful tool in our economic 
toolbox, it does not say much about how the real world operates or what types of policies we 
should institute. More interesting and useful analyses concern what happens to markets when 
the conditions of perfect competition are not satisﬁed. But to understand these analyses, we 
ﬁrst need to understand the perfectly competitive model presented in this chapter. In Chapter 
18, we consider markets that are not perfectly competitive, including the implications of these 
markets for efﬁciency, fairness, and public policies.
Discussion Questions
1. Try to think of other examples, not mentioned in the text, of path dependence or network ex-
ternalities. Do you think that these situations are inefﬁcient? Do you think that government 
policy should play a role in eliminating path dependence and network externalities?
2. An interesting book published in the 1990s, titled No Contest, argues for the restructur-
ing of society to promote cooperation rather than competition. The book contends that 
the pervasive existence of competition in society actually destroys social capital, creates 
anxiety, and lowers productivity. Do you think that there could be a viable alternative 
to an economy based on competitive pressures? Should government policies promote 
competition, cooperation, neither, or both?

APPENDIX: A FORMAL MODEL OF PERFECT COMPETITION
In this appendix, we present a formal conceptual model of perfect competition. We start by 
introducing new material on production costs and then combine that with the production 
decisions of a price-taking ﬁrm.
Recall from Chapter 16 the deﬁnition of average total cost (ATC) as total cost divided 
by the quantity produced. For example, if the total cost of producing 200 bushels of corn 
were $800, the ATC would be $4.00 ($800 ÷ 200). ATC relates to marginal cost (MC) in the 
following manner:
s  If MC < ATC, then ATC is decreasing
s  If MC > ATC, then ATC is increasing
s  When ATC = MC, ATC is at its lowest point
While this may seem difﬁcult to grasp, consider the following analogy. Suppose that your 
current grade average in a class is a 90, and you get a new grade of 80 on a quiz. As your 
marginal grade (the quiz grade of 80) is lower than your average grade, your average grade 
will go down. However, if you instead score a 95 on the quiz, your marginal grade is higher 
than your average and your average will go up.
The relationship between ATC and MC is shown in Figure 17.7. We see that ATC starts 
out relatively high because ﬁxed costs (which are often relatively large) are divided by a 
relative small quantity. As quantity increases, the average cost of production declines, even 
as marginal costs begin to rise (i.e., the reduction of ATC that is due to dividing by a larger 

 
APPENDIX: A FORMAL MODEL OF PERFECT COMPETITION 
387
quantity more than offsets the rising marginal production costs). Eventually, the marginal 
cost rises above ATC, and then ATC rises. The minimum ATC is at point A.
Next we introduce a new cost variable, average variable cost (AVC). AVC is equal to 
total variable cost divided by quantity. As AVC excludes ﬁxed costs, it will always be less 
than ATC. Like ATC, the minimum AVC will occur where it intercepts the MC curve. Realize 
that all marginal costs are variable costs. So whenever MC < AVC, AVC is declining, and 
whenever MC > AVC, AVC will rise.
In Figure 17.8 we have added an AVC curve to the graph shown in Figure 17.7. Note that the 
distance between ATC and AVC is initially large because ﬁxed costs are divided by a relatively 
small quantity. As quantity increases, ﬁxed costs become less dominant in determining ATC, 
and AVC moves closer to ATC.
We can refer to this graph to determine the total costs of producing a given quantity and 
divide total costs into ﬁxed and variable costs, as shown in Figure 17.9. Production is at Q0. 
Total cost is the average per-unit cost (ATC) multiplied by Q0, or the entire shaded area in the 
graph. The total variable costs are obtained by multiplying Q0 by the average variable cost, 
which is the blue-shaded area in the graph. The difference is ﬁxed costs, the gray-shaded 
area. Note that the area of ﬁxed costs must be the same for any level of production, as it does 
not vary according to production levels.
Suppose that price is initially at P0. A perfectly competitive ﬁrm would produce where P 
= MC, or at point X in Figure 17.10. Assuming the ﬁrm’s costs include opportunity costs,

CHAPTER 17 — MARKETS WITHOUT POWER
in this case the ﬁrm is making an economic proﬁt, as shown in the graph as the blue-shaded 
area above the ﬁrm’s total costs. Note that total revenues would be P0 multiplied by Q0, or 
the sum of all shaded areas.
As discussed in the chapter, the existence of economic proﬁts creates an incentive for 
entry into the market. Assuming no barriers to entry, new ﬁrms will enter the market until 
economic proﬁts are eliminated. This occurs when total revenues are just equal to total costs. 
As price falls, each perfectly competitive ﬁrm will reduce its production as the point where 
P = MC moves to the left. The perfectly competitive market equilibrium is shown in Figure 
17.11, with each ﬁrm producing at point Y (a quantity of Q1 at a price of P1). At this point, 
each ﬁrm is earning a zero economic proﬁt—a proﬁt just equal to what they could be making 
with their next-best alternative.
Finally, we consider the decision whether a ﬁrm should continue to produce in the short 
run while experiencing losses. As discussed in the chapter, perfectly competitive ﬁrms will 
continue to produce as long as they can recover their variable costs. So if price falls a little 
below P1 in Figure 17.11, the ﬁrm will be making negative economic proﬁts, but it will still 
be making enough revenues to cover its variable costs as well as pay some ﬁxed costs—which 
is still better than shutting down production, earning no revenues, and having to pay all its 
ﬁxed costs.

Eventually, the price will fall enough that the ﬁrm will not be able to cover its variable 
costs, and it is better off shutting down production and just paying its ﬁxed costs, as illustrated 
in Figure 17.12. At a price of P2 the ﬁrm produces at point Z (where P = MC) and makes 
just enough in revenues to cover its variable costs. However, if price falls below P2, the ﬁrm 
will not be able to cover its variable costs and it is better off shutting down production and 
just paying its ﬁxed costs.

18 Markets with Market Power
At the turn of the century, one of the ongoing big news stories concerned the lawsuits being 
brought against Microsoft—a company that had made its founder, Bill Gates, the richest 
person on the planet. At issue was the question of whether Microsoft had too much control 
over its market—in other words, whether its “market power” was excessive. As we will see, 
markets are rarely as competitive as described under the conditions of perfect competition 
from the last chapter. Indeed, many industries—from transportation and utilities to agriculture 
and health care—are characterized by a considerable degree of market power.
1. THE TRADITIONAL MODELS
Traditional neoclassical economics asks the question: “How do the number of ﬁrms in a 
product market and the characteristics of the good being sold affect the proﬁt-maximizing 
decisions of the ﬁrm?” The four traditional types of market structure are perfect competition, 
pure monopoly, monopolistic competition, and oligopoly.
s  PERFECT COMPETITION THE SITUATION IN WHICH THERE ARE MANY SELLERS SELLING IDENTICAL GOODS (see Chapter 17)
s  pure monopoly: the situation in which there is only one seller
s  monopolistic competition: the situation in which there are many sellers, but they sell 
slightly different things
s  oligopoly: the situation in which there are so few sellers that each needs to watch what the 
others are doing
The ﬁrst two are “idealized” types because they do rarely, if ever, exist in their “pure” 
form. In other words, although competition may exist to a signiﬁcant degree, it is never 
“perfect”; and absolute monopolies also do not exist in the United States because they are 
prohibited by laws meant to encourage competitive behavior. These two “idealized types” 
are at opposite ends of a “competitiveness continuum,” along which we ﬁnd the other two 
types, monopolistic competition and oligopoly. Basically, the degree of competitiveness 
within an industry will inform whether the market more closely resembles monopolistic 
competition or oligopoly. In the latter case, markets are found to be truly complex, evolving 
social organizations. Arguably, oligopoly is the most important and prevalent type of market 
in contemporary industrialized economies.
Why model the ﬁrst two types if they do not occur in the real world? As we have seen in 
earlier chapters, economists often sacriﬁce some realism in their analytical models in order to 
present simpliﬁed cases that can provide useful insights into economic behavior and decisions. 
The perfect competition and monopoly outcomes represent baseline cases to which we can 
then compare our conclusions about monopolistic competition and oligopoly.

there is only one

ation in which there 
are so few sellers that

what the others are 
doing

 
PURE MONOPOLY: ONE SELLER 
391
2. PURE MONOPOLY: ONE SELLER
The case that is diametrically opposed to perfect competition is pure monopoly, in which 
there is only one seller. As in the case of perfect competition, the traditional model of proﬁt 
maximization for monopoly leads to clear and deﬁnite predictions. But the predicted outcomes 
are, perhaps not surprisingly, very different from those of the perfect competition model.
2.1 THE CONDITIONS OF MONOPOLY
Monopoly is characterized by the following conditions:
1. There is only one seller.
2. The good being sold has no close substitutes. This means that buyers must buy from the 
monopolist or not at all.
3. Barriers to entry prevent other ﬁrms from starting to produce the good.
Because the monopolist is the only seller in the market, it faces no competition from other 
ﬁrms. The condition of “no close substitutes” means that the good that the monopolist sells 
must be substantially different from anything else, so the monopolist does not have to worry 
about losing buyers to markets for similar, even if not identical, goods. If the monopolist 
made economic proﬁts, other ﬁrms would, of course, want to enter the market. Barriers to 
entry are necessary to keep those other ﬁrms out. They come in three major kinds: economic 
barriers, legal barriers, and deliberate barriers.
Economic Barriers
Economic barriers derive primarily from the nature of the production technology. For example, 
the production technology may be characterized by high ﬁxed costs, economies of scale, or 
network externalities.
High ﬁxed costs prevent potential competitors from entering the industry on a small scale 
and expanding, because while they are small they cannot generate enough revenue to recover 
the sizable ﬁxed costs. Competitors must therefore enter as very large-scale operations, which 
may be a difﬁcult and risky thing to do. For example, the large initial investment required to 
build facilities that can produce specialized military aircraft make it difﬁcult for any potential 
entrant to challenge existing ﬁrms.
The size of the market relative to the minimum efﬁcient scale of a ﬁrm is also important 
(recall our discussion in Chapter 16). A monopoly will likely arise if the minimum efﬁcient 
scale is large enough to correspond to the majority of a particular market. In such situations, 
any ﬁrm with less than the majority of the market will be producing at higher per-unit costs 
than a ﬁrm that is producing above the minimum efﬁcient scale. Ultimately, these smaller 
competitors will be uncompetitive compared to a ﬁrm with monopoly power. A monopoly 
that emerges because of economies of scale is called a natural monopoly.
Network externalities (see Chapter 17) can also lead to monopolization. The fact that most 
PC users have come to use Windows operating systems and software written for those systems 
gives Microsoft an advantage that a competitor would ﬁnd extremely hard to challenge.
Legal Barriers
Legal barriers include copyrights (which protect creative works), franchises and concessions 
(which directly prohibit entry), patents (which prevent other ﬁrms from using innovations), 
and trademarks (which protect brand names). Legal barriers provide the oldest and most 
secure foundations for monopoly. In times past, kings frequently granted monopoly rights as 
a reward for services rendered to them. In the United States, patent protection allows a ﬁrm 
exclusive use of an invention for an extended period of time, usually 17 to 20 years. If the 
barriers to entry: 
economic, legal, or 
deliberate obstacles 
that keep new sell-
ers from entering a 
market
natural monopoly: 
a monopoly that 
arises because the 
minimum efﬁcient 
scale of the producing 
unit is large relative 
to the total market 
demand

392 
CHAPTER 18 — MARKETS WITH MARKET POWER
invention produces a new and unique good or facilitates production at much lower costs than 
competitors incur, a monopoly can result.
How can one determine which type of enterprise, brand, or type of work deserves such legal 
protection? Critics often argue that the government is excessively generous in providing patents 
or trademarks, which can stiﬂe market competition, noting that a well-endowed ﬁrm with market 
power has resources available to lobby the government to grant such concessions. When this 
occurs, it is another example of the rent-seeking behavior described in earlier chapters.
Deliberate Barriers
A deliberate barrier involves the physical, ﬁnancial, or political intimidation of potential 
competitors. Not surprisingly, many such “barriers” are illegal. For example, a monopolist 
might induce the supplier of an essential raw material not to supply potential competitors, or 
it might get a distributor to agree not to distribute products produced by a rival. Such deals, 
designed to exclude competitors from access to necessary goods and services, are called 
exclusionary practices.
A powerful monopolist might also discourage potential competitors by engaging in 
predatory pricing. Whenever small competitors enter the market, the monopolist may 
temporarily lower the price of its product to a level so low that it does not cover costs, in 
order to drive its new rivals out of business. In international markets, selling output in another 
country at prices below the cost of domestic production is called dumping.
A powerful monopolist might also threaten smaller potential competitors with unfounded 
(but very expensive) lawsuits, in attempts to intimidate or bankrupt them. In such cases, the 
size of the monopolist relative to potential competitors is clearly important: These strategies 
are possible only for relatively large, established ﬁrms with “deep pockets.” Acts of violence 
are not unheard of as barriers to entry, most notably in monopolies run by organized crime.
2.2 EXAMPLES OF MONOPOLY
Although earlier we described monopoly as an “idealized” case, rarely if ever found in 
reality, examples of near-monopolies are fairly easy to ﬁnd. For example, we have already 
mentioned Microsoft’s dominance in PC operating systems. If a ﬁrm is the only supplier in a 
given geographic area, it is called a local monopoly. For example, a small, isolated town may 
have only one hardware store, which has a local monopoly for the sale of certain products. A 
university bookstore is another example of a local monopoly, in the provision of textbooks 
(although the store may face competition from online retailers).
Older textbooks often cited industries in transportation, communications, and public 
utilities as examples of natural monopolies. Until relatively recently, for example, the 
U.S. Postal Service had a monopoly on the delivery of letters and packages. Railroads, 
phone companies, and electric companies were traditionally operated either directly by the 
government or as regulated monopolies—that is, private companies run under government 
supervision. It would obviously have been inefﬁcient, it was often argued, to have two mail 
carriers delivering to the same house, or two lines of railroad tracks, or multiple separate 
grids of electrical transmission wires.
In recent years, however, competition, deregulation, and privatization have complicated 
this picture. Nowadays, the U.S. Postal Service has competition in many markets from 
FedEx, UPS, and other ﬁrms, and it is not rare to see trucks with each of the three insignias 
delivering to the same business district or neighborhood on the same day. Market structure 
in communications and utilities has become more sophisticated; the aspects with large 
economies of scale (such as maintenance of the electrical grid) are separated from parts of 
the business where economies of scale are not so great (such as generation of electricity). 
What might once have seemed obvious (i.e., that utilities should be run as natural monopolies) 
may therefore no longer be so.

2.3 PROFIT MAXIMIZATION FOR A MONOPOLIST
In choosing what level of output to produce, a monopolistic ﬁrm follows the general pat-
tern of behavior of a proﬁt-maximizing ﬁrm as described in Chapter 17, seeking the level at 
which its marginal cost is equal to its marginal revenue (MC = MR). But although its costs 
are determined in the same way as those of a perfectly competitive ﬁrm, its revenues are 
signiﬁcantly different.
A price-taking ﬁrm has such a small market share that it can sell however much of its 
product it chooses to at the going price. Because it is “small,” no amount sold would, in 
theory, have any impact on the price determined by market conditions of supply and demand. 
In contrast, because a monopolistic ﬁrm is the sole supplier of a given product, it possesses 
enormous inﬂuence over the price of its product. Whereas the demand curve for the price-
taking ﬁrm is horizontal, reﬂecting the ﬁrm’s powerlessness over price, the demand curve 
for the monopolist’s output is identical to the overall market demand curve for that product. 
In other words, it slopes downward.
The monopolistic ﬁrm is able to sell more only by inducing consumers as a group to 
buy more. That is, to sell more it must either mount an effective advertising campaign 
(to shift out the demand curve that it faces) or offer its product at a lower price. Another 
way to look at the difference is to note that the monopolist can raise its price, losing some 
sales but obtaining more revenue per unit for those remaining. In contrast, the price-
taking ﬁrm will sell absolutely nothing if it raises its price above the existing market 
level. In short, a monopolist is a price maker, not a price taker. It can set both price and 
quantity, although the price-quantity combinations that it can choose are constrained by 
market demand.
Consider how a producer would behave if, instead of receiving a ﬂat amount for each unit 
of output sold, it were a monopolist and faced the full schedule of market demand. Table 
18.1 shows how the ﬁrm must, in order to sell more of its output, drop its selling price. It can 
sell 1 unit if it sets the price at $44, for example. But if it wants to sell 2 units, it must drop 
the price to $40 each in order to ﬁnd another buyer. The ﬁrst two columns of Table 18.1 thus 
describe the demand curve for this good.
The fourth column in Table 18.1 indicates how much extra revenue the monopolist would 
gain for producing and selling an additional unit. Although initial revenue for selling 1 unit 
is $44, if the monopolist wants instead to sell 2 units it must sell both units at the lower price 
of $40, receiving total revenue of $80. It thus gains $40 from selling the second unit but also 
loses the $4 (from the original $44) that it would have gotten from selling the ﬁrst unit alone. 
Marginal revenue from the second unit, then, is only $36 (40 minus 4 or, what amounts to 
the same thing, 80 minus 44).
The remainder of Table 18.1 is calculated in the same fashion. Note that after the monopolist 
sells 6 units, total revenue starts to go down (from its peak at $144), and marginal revenue 
becomes negative. Recall from Chapter 5 that the upper regions of demand curves (where

ing price, constrained

quantities are low and prices are high) tend to be elastic, meaning that reductions in price 
increase revenue. The lower regions tend to be inelastic, such that reductions in price decrease 
revenue. This is exactly what is illustrated numerically in Table 18.1.
We can use the data from Table 18.1 to construct a demand curve for the good, as well as 
a marginal revenue curve. These are shown in Figure 18.1. The marginal revenue curve lies 
below the demand curve (after the ﬁrst unit) and falls off more steeply, entering the negative 
part of the graph after 6 units.
Figure 18.1 also shows the marginal cost curve for the good, which is similar to the cost 
curves we derived in Chapter 16. (The cost curves are independent of whether a producer is 
competitive or a monopolist; only the demand side of the market is different.) The monopolist 
will maximize proﬁts by producing the quantity at which MR = MC, which occurs at point A 
in Figure 18.1. This is an output level of 5 units. Reading horizontally from the MC curve, 
you see that the marginal cost of producing the ﬁfth unit is $12. The graph and table show 
that the marginal revenue from the ﬁfth unit is also $12.
Figure 18.1 Monopoly Proﬁt Maximization
A monopolist decides how much 
to produce by setting marginal 
cost equal to marginal revenue 
(point A). The price that buyers are 
willing to pay for this quantity is 
read off the demand curve (point 
B). The monopolist produces less, 
and charges more, than would 
ﬁrms in a competitive equilibrium 
(point C).

The monopolist, however, will not charge its customers $12 per unit. Reading up from a 
quantity of 5 to the demand curve, we see that customers are willing to pay up to $28 each 
for the 5 units produced, as shown by point B on the demand curve in Figure 18.1 (see also 
the “Selling price” column in Table 18.1). The monopolist will produce at a marginal cost to 
itself of $12 per unit but will charge customers $28 per unit to maximize proﬁts.
What level of proﬁts will the monopolist make in the long run? Unlike in the competitive 
case, in which we assume that economic proﬁts are driven to zero by the entrance of new 
producers, monopolists can make sustained positive economic proﬁts, as long as barriers to 
entry keep potential competitors out. To determine the actual level of proﬁts, you need to 
know more about the cost structure of the ﬁrm. This is investigated in the appendix to this 
chapter. If the monopolist’s cost structure is such that it makes economic losses, presumably 
in the long run it will choose to exit the industry.
2.4 MONOPOLY AND INEFFICIENCY
Monopoly power generally leads to inefﬁciencies in the form of deadweight loss (dis-
cussed in Chapter 6), when compared to a competitive outcome. Because the monopolist 
produces at an output level at which the marginal willingness to pay (price) exceeds 
marginal cost, society could gain from increased output of the product. From the point 
of view of society, in other words, the cost of additional production is lower than the 
marginal beneﬁts.

 
PURE MONOPOLY: ONE SELLER 
395
In the above example, buyers value the sixth unit at $24, whereas the cost of producing 
the sixth unit is less than $24 (as seen in Figure 18.1). The social beneﬁt of producing 
the sixth unit is greater than the social marginal cost, and society would be better off if 
it were produced. The “curving triangle” ABC in Figure 18.1 represents the deadweight 
loss from the monopolist’s decision, compared to a competitive situation in which 
marginal willingness to pay and marginal cost would be equal (at point C, where 7 units 
are produced).
Another way to examine the efﬁciency and distributional effects is to analyze producer 
surplus and consumer surplus. In Figure 18.2 the competitive equilibrium (price-taking) 
situation is portrayed by thinking of the MC curve as the sum of the MC curves of numerous 
competitive ﬁrms. The resulting competitive price and quantity are PE and QE. The contrasting 
monopoly price and quantity are PM and QM. As we have just noted, the fact that the monopolist 
will supply a lower quantity and charge a higher price creates deadweight loss. It also causes 
a distributional shift away from the buyers of the good and toward the monopolist. The 
rectangle labeled “transfer” would be part of consumer surplus in a competitive market, 
but the monopolist extracts the value represented by the rectangle from the consumer, thus 
reducing overall consumer surplus. Market power creates more beneﬁt for the seller—which 
is why businesses like to get it—but at the expense of buyers of the good (lost consumer 
surplus) and of efﬁciency for society as a whole as it creates a deadweight loss relative to 
the competitive outcome.
Figure 18.2 The Welfare Costs of Monopoly Power
A monopolist imposes a deadweight 
loss on society relative to a situation 
of perfect competition and transfers 
surplus from consumers to itself.

Sometimes, people justify monopolies on the grounds that they create situations that 
foster innovation. Other justiﬁcations note that, in the 1950s and 1960s, the large U.S. 
ﬁrms in the steel and automotive industries shared some of their monopoly proﬁts with 
their workers, providing levels of wages and beneﬁts (especially pensions) that helped 
cast large ﬁrms with such market power in a positive light. Such beneﬁts could not, 
however, be maintained when foreign competition forced them to cut such costs in order 
to remain proﬁtable. But there are other economic objections to monopoly power. One 
of the most common is the claim that a lack of competition makes a monopolist lazy. 
A secure monopolist has less incentive to please customers, manage costs efﬁciently, 
and adopt new ideas than a ﬁrm that has its survival on the line. We should, moreover, 
consider what monopolists do with their positive economic proﬁts. A monopolist may, 
in fact, need to spend most or all of the proﬁts merely keeping entry barriers up. For 

396 
CHAPTER 18 — MARKETS WITH MARKET POWER
instance, when monopolies are generated by exclusive concessions or licenses given out 
by governments, producers might spend much or all of their economic proﬁts on rent-
seeking activities of lobbying and bribing government ofﬁcials in order to maintain their 
exclusive right to produce a good.
2.5 CAN MONOPOLY BE EFFICIENT?
However, in some situations the efﬁciency cost of monopoly may not be as negative as the 
foregoing analysis suggests. In some cases, monopoly may even be preferable to a competi-
tive market.
Natural Monopoly
We have already mentioned one case in which a single big ﬁrm may be socially preferable 
to many small ones: natural monopoly. Competitive ﬁrms would face per-unit costs that 
were unnecessarily high, but a monopolist could exploit its economies of scale. Often, 
natural monopolies are regulated. The government allows only one ﬁrm to produce the 
good but mandates that it produce at higher levels, and sell at lower prices, than the ﬁrm 
would choose on its own. One prominent example is the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority in greater New York. A private company that provides a variety of public trans-
portation services, it is fundamentally a monopoly, but the local government regulates 
its pricing policy.
Regulated monopolies can, nonetheless, present the government with a dilemma, especially 
when substantial economies of scale are present. Often the marginal cost of production is very 
low. For example, on a passenger railroad line the marginal cost of transporting one more 
rider, assuming some seats are empty, is very low after the rails, engines, and schedules are 
all in place. Efﬁciently setting the price of a ticket equal to the marginal cost of providing a 
ride, however, would mean that the monopolist’s revenues would not cover its costs, making 
its business untenable.
In some cases, the government subsidizes the monopolist to encourage socially beneﬁcial 
price setting and levels of production. But although subsidies are a commonsense manner of 
persuading natural monopolists to increase production, they are politically very unpopular: 
Many taxpayers resent having their tax dollars go to private companies. Rather than regulating 
price, government might also regulate the company’s proﬁt rate or its output level. Alas, 
each comes with its own problem. Compelling companies not to exceed a speciﬁed proﬁt 
rate creates an incentive to engage in wasteful spending (on, e.g., excess administration 
or perks for company executives), because higher costs permit the generation of greater 
absolute proﬁts, whatever the maximum proﬁt rate. And requiring companies to provide 
a minimum level of output to meet the needs of society creates an incentive to skimp on 
quality of service and materials used, in order to cut costs and thereby earn a higher proﬁt. 
So although it is certainly true that natural monopolies make sense in certain industries and 
that such monopolies must be regulated, there is no single optimal method of regulation. It 
is likely to depend on the individual case.
Despite the economic case in favor of natural monopolies in some instances, many 
economists argue that all monopolies should be discouraged, if not abolished, because of 
their belief that competition always leads to a more efﬁcient distribution and, invariably, 
lower prices. In recent decades, a signiﬁcant deregulation of natural monopolies has taken 
place and not only in the United States. One well-publicized case was the privatization of 
municipal water supplies in Bolivia in the late 1990s. Such a move does not always deliver 
the expected beneﬁts, namely, lower prices and greater availability of the commodity for 
consumers (see Box 18.1).

 
PURE MONOPOLY: ONE SELLER 
397
Intellectual Property
The problem of covering costs arises again in the case of research costs for the development 
of new technologies. Patents, copyrights, and other protections of intellectual property are 
not granted simply to enrich inventors. The rationale for these forms of government-granted 
monopoly power is to encourage research and innovation. Development of new computer 
technologies, medical technologies, and drugs can be very expensive. Firms argue that they 
need a period of exclusive, high proﬁts to ﬁnance their research and development. Without 
the ability to patent an innovation, it is argued, ﬁrms might ﬁnd research unproﬁtable and so 
do less of it, to the detriment of all.
Of course, patents also have a social cost in that they restrict the production of some 
important and valuable goods while raising their price. The cost can be extremely high: In 
many cases, restricted access to certain indispensable medications results in unnecessary 
human suffering and premature death. Also, as societies become more concerned about 
climate change, there is concern that allowing new low-emission energy technologies to 
be patented could slow their rates of adoption, as the owner of the patent would produce 
such technologies based on maximum proﬁt, not social need. Other forms of government 
action have been suggested as ways of encouraging invention that would not carry the 
BOX 18.1 PRIVATIZATION OF MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLIES
Municipal water supply is a common example of 
a natural monopoly. The signiﬁcant ﬁxed cost of 
water treatment facilities and supply pipes means 
that the minimum efﬁcient scale is normally so 
large that it forms an effective barrier to entry for 
potential competitors. Municipal water has been 
traditionally supplied either by nonproﬁt public 
utilities or by highly regulated private companies 
that are limited in the prices that they can charge 
their customers.
In recent decades, some economists have proposed 
moving toward a greater degree of privatization of 
municipal water supplies, with fewer regulations on 
the prices that companies can charge. With water 
privatization, different companies bid for the right to 
become the monopoly provider. Under most privati-
zation contracts, which commonly last for four to ten 
years, the water supply infrastructure remains publicly 
owned. However, proponents of privatization contend 
that for-proﬁt companies will be motivated to operate 
water supply systems in a more efﬁcient manner than 
public utilities.
Privatization of water supplies has been most con-
troversial in developing countries. In the late 1990s, 
the World Bank pushed scores of poor countries to 
privatize their water supplies as a condition for re-
ceiving much-needed economic assistance. In several 
cases, most infamously Bolivia, private companies 
raised the price of water so much that poor families 
could not afford enough to meet basic needs.
The need for better water management is es-
pecially acute in China. With contracts to supply 
water becoming more lucrative, the number of 
private water utilities in China has skyrocketed. 
As water demands increase in Beijing, wells dug 
around the city must reach ever-greater depths to 
hit fresh water. But in China private water suppli-
ers must pay the cost of constructing new wells. In 
order to recover investment costs, companies have 
dramatically raised the price of water. “It’s more 
than most families can afford to pay,” says Ge Yun, 
an economist with the Xinjiang Conservation Fund. 
“So as more water goes private, fewer people have 
access to it.”
The World Bank continues to promote privatization, 
noting that higher water prices are necessary to induce 
conservation. Public utilities rarely charge enough to 
reﬂect the true economic and social costs of water; 
privatization advocates argue that this is the root cause 
of unsustainable water use. From the perspective of 
social welfare, market prices are too low if they fail 
to account for externalities. But economic efﬁciency 
may conﬂict with the goal of equity. Privatization may 
work best when combined with policies ensuring that 
the poorest can afford enough water to meet their 
basic needs, as in the South African system, which 
provides a minimum supply of water to all households 
free to ensure that basic needs can be met. Only 
water usage above this minimum amount is billed to 
households.

patent system’s harmful effect of restricting production and use. These include direct 
funding of research, offering research prizes, and buying patents from companies for a 
one-time fee.
Pressure to Appear Competitive
In the idealized case of pure monopoly, the seller is free to maximize proﬁts. But do unregulated 
monopolists in the real world always maximize proﬁts? Even if a monopolist faces neither a 
serious rival nor any meaningful government restriction, it may fear potential competitors or 
government action. If so, the monopolist might produce and price in a way that more closely 
resembles a competitive ﬁrm, out of fear that excessive monopoly proﬁts would attract too 
much attention.
Often the barriers protecting a monopoly can be bypassed by producing a similar, though 
not identical, product. Monopolies held by American railroads in the early twentieth century, 
for example, were weakened not by competing railroads but by truck and airline competition 
that increased the elasticity of demand for railroad transportation. Textbooks written as recently 
as the 1970s sometimes asserted that competition between telephone companies and postal 
systems was impossible, because there was no way of sending documents by telephone—an 
idea that seems quaintly old-fashioned in an era of fax machines and e-mail. Microsoft has 
argued that even though it currently enjoys a near-monopoly, it is “competitive” in a dynamic 
sense because new technologies could arise at any time to upset its dominance in the market 
for PC operating systems.
Firms with market power might also be cautious out of fear of government action. Since 
the 1930s, most industrialized countries have created government agencies charged with 
investigating cases of monopoly power. Governments may take over monopolies, regulate 
them, or break them up into smaller companies if their existence is found to be socially 
harmful. The ﬁrst ruling in the United States vs. Microsoft case (in which Microsoft was 
charged with violating antitrust statutes and engaging in abusive practices in its operating 
system and Web browser sales) mandated a breakup, although a federal appeals court ruling 
focused instead on changing its business practices. Some monopolists may refrain from fully 
exploiting their power in order to be less visibly irksome—hence less likely to be targeted 
for the sort of attention that Microsoft repeatedly receives.
Perfect Price Discrimination
Although we usually think of ﬁrms as charging the same price to all buyers, this need not 
be the case. An interesting—if rare—welfare result occurs in the case of what is called a 
“perfectly price-discriminating” monopolist.
A price-discriminating seller is one that charges different prices to different buyers, 
depending on their ability and willingness to pay. How can a seller do this? One way is to 
keep its prices a secret. In the real world, car salespeople often carry out a version of price 
discrimination, offering a price that is closer to the list price and pressing more options on 
a buyer who comes into the showroom dressed in expensive clothing, while more rapidly 
offering discounts to a less–afﬂuent-looking client. Airline companies characteristically do 
something similar, charging business travelers—who are generally quite inﬂexible about 
when they must ﬂy—a higher price, on average, than vacationers. A clever way of doing 
this is by offering discounts for ﬂights that require a weekend stay away (because doing so 
generally excludes business travelers).
Another way is to offer discounts structured so that some people, but—importantly—not 
others, will pass them up. Why do stores sometimes offer bulk discounts or “two for the 
price of one” sales or offer discounts only if you come on particular “sale days” or go to the 
trouble of bringing in a coupon? They are also trying to separate out the price-unresponsive 
price discrimina-
tion: a seller’s charg-
ing different prices 
to different buyers, 
depending on their 
ability and willingness 
to pay

 
PURE MONOPOLY: ONE SELLER

customers (who will buy anyway) from the price-responsive ones, who will take the time 
and trouble to ﬁnd sales, mail in coupons for rebates, and so on.
This possibility is illustrated in the demand curve in Figure 18.3. Customer A does not care 
about getting a low price and would be willing to pay price PA for the ﬁrst few units (QA) of the 
good. The seller would like to be able to charge Customer A this high price and then drop the 
price a little for Customer B, who would not buy any of the good at price PA but is happy to buy 
at price PB, increasing the total quantity sold to QB. And so on. In this case, consumer surplus 
is whittled away—each customer is paying close to the maximum that he or she is willing to 
pay. The seller is reaping the beneﬁts—extra revenue, represented by shaded rectangles on the 
graph, for each sale made above the price charged to the last buyer (PD). Compare this to the 
“baseline” monopoly case discussed earlier. Remember that the monopolist faced the dilemma 
of undercutting itself by lowering the price on all goods sold by offering more to consumers; 
in the case of price discrimination, this problem is at least partially overcome.
If a monopolist could vary the price continuously—that is, not in discrete steps but over 
the entire demand curve, as shown in Figure 18.4—it would be engaging in “perfect” price 
discrimination. In such a hypothetical case, the monopolist captures the entire consumer surplus. 
Consumers therefore “gain” nothing from their purchases, because everyone spends exactly how 
much he or she is willing to pay—not a penny less. From a social point of view, a large transfer 
of beneﬁt takes place from buyers to the monopolist. But the earlier deadweight efﬁciency

CHAPTER 18 — MARKETS WITH MARKET POWER
loss would also be eliminated, in contrast to the case of a monopolist that is not perfectly price 
discriminating. This is because the seller in this case has no reason to restrict output and would 
produce until P = MC, which is no different from the outcome under perfect competition.
The equity consequences of price discrimination are interesting. In a case in which the 
monopolist reaps large proﬁts at consumers’ expense, price discrimination seems unfair to 
consumers. However, price discrimination may sometimes just allow a producer to break 
even. The only nonproﬁt mental health clinic in town, for example, may offer its services 
on a “sliding scale,” in which the price charged to a client rises with his or her income. The 
care given to lower-income clients is thus subsidized by the higher prices paid by those with 
a higher ability to pay. If it were forced to charge only a single price, the clinic might have 
to close or turn away its poorest clients.

As noted earlier, however, cases of pure monopoly happen extremely rarely—if at all—in 
the real world. Most goods have some reasonable substitutes. If railroads were monopolized, 
people might turn to trucks or cars, for example. Even if only one drug company produced the 
most effective drug for a medical condition, drugs produced by other companies can normally 
at least help. This brings us to a discussion of cases that are neither perfect competition nor 
pure monopoly.
Discussion Questions
1. On many campuses, the ofﬁcial college or university bookstores used to have monopoly 
power in selling textbooks to students. What would you call this kind of monopoly? Is it 
still the case at your institution? Why or why not?
2. Does it sometimes make sense to have just one company in charge of providing some-
thing? Some users of electronics are frustrated by the lack of compatibility among their 
gadgets and between their gadgets and those of their friends. Might it be better to have 
just one company manufacture computers, gaming machines, music players, cell phones, 
and the like in such a way that they all work smoothly with one another? What would be 
the advantages and disadvantages of such a situation?
3. MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION
Monopolistic competition shares characteristics with both perfect competition and monopoly. 
Because of its name, however, many students confuse monopolistic competition with mo-
nopoly. It is important not to, because monopolistic competition is generally closer to the 
competitive end of the spectrum.

 
MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION 
401
3.1 THE CONDITIONS OF MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION
Monopolistic competition is generally characterized by the following conditions:
1. There are numerous small buyers and sellers.
2. The sellers produce goods that are close substitutes but are not identical. Products are 
often differentiated, which means that each seller’s product is somewhat different from 
that offered by the other sellers.
3. Producers of the good or service can freely enter or exit the industry.
4. Buyers and sellers have perfect information.
The above conditions are identical to those of perfect competition, except that products are 
differentiated instead of identical. In this case, buyers care which producer they buy from.
3.2 EXAMPLES OF MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION
How many different brands of blue jeans can you name? How many fast-food restaurants 
might you ﬁnd in a large town or a city? Why might there be three different brands of gasoline 
offered at stations at the same busy intersection? These are all examples of differentiated prod-
ucts. McDonald’s, Burger King, and Wendy’s franchises all sell hamburgers, but they prepare 
them a little differently, and each franchise is located in a different spot. Different gas stations 
may offer slightly different products, different levels of service, or different complementary 
products or services (e.g., a convenience store or a car wash). Such differences in product 
offerings, however slight, often are sufﬁcient to elicit a degree of brand loyalty on the part of 
the consumer, although its strength varies considerably across the population.
Situations of monopolistic competition seem to be ubiquitous in contemporary industrialized 
societies. In everyday life, we see many ﬁrms competing to sell us slightly different varieties 
of the same goods and services.
3.3 PROFIT MAXIMIZATION WITH MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION
Product differentiation means that each seller is a miniature monopoly, the only producer of 
its particular good. Indeed, it is this fact that makes the ﬁrms monopolistically competitive. 
Starbucks coffee is a classic example. Although many argue that it produces superior coffee 
(and many others argue the contrary), it once had a virtual “monopoly” on the “amenities” that 
it offered along with its coffee—comfortable couches and Wi-Fi access, for example—as part 
of its “product line.” These produced legions of loyal customers, and while many other smaller 
coffee outlets have mimicked Starbucks in this regard, Starbucks obtained an early enough start 
on the competition to secure for itself a sizable share of the coffee-drinking population.
We see similar brand loyalty in the fast-food industry. Some people, for example, might 
claim that McDonald’s hamburgers are far superior to Wendy’s and might be willing to 
continue to buy from McDonald’s even if it raises its prices. You might be willing to pay a 
higher price for milk at a local convenience store, even though you know that the price is 
lower at the big supermarket miles away. Whereas perfectly competitive sellers will lose 
all their customers if they raise their prices above the prevailing market price, a ﬁrm that 
sells a differentiated product may have a little leeway. Firms in a situation of monopolistic 
competition face a downward-sloping demand curve for their particular product.
The fact that such ﬁrms face a downward-sloping demand curve means that their 
proﬁt-maximization problem more closely resembles that of a monopolist (illustrated in 
Figure 18.1). They also face marginal revenue curves that lie below the demand curve. A 
sophisticated monopolistic competitor, with good information, or at least a good “feel” for 
market circumstances, will choose an output level by setting MR = MC at point A in Figure 
18.1 and will charge customers the price set by the demand curve, at point B.

402 
CHAPTER 18 — MARKETS WITH MARKET POWER
Unlike what occurs in the case of monopoly, however, the demand for such a ﬁrm’s good 
is affected by the availability of close substitutes. If a Wendy’s restaurant shuts down, demand 
at McDonald’s, Burger King, and other restaurants and franchises nearby is likely to rise. If 
a new Burger King opens up, demand for food provided by many existing nearby restaurants 
may fall. Even though no other ﬁrm produces an identical good, substitutes often are close 
enough to induce meaningful changes in the market.
The fact that entry and exit are easy means that if any monopolistically competitive ﬁrm 
is making positive economic proﬁts, new producers will be attracted to the market and will 
begin to sell similar goods (e.g., other hamburgers). As new ﬁrms enter the market, the demand 
for the speciﬁc product in question (e.g., a McDonald’s hamburger) will fall, as illustrated in 
Figure 18.5. Suppose the demand for a particular ﬁrm’s products is D1, and it is making positive 
economic proﬁts. Other ﬁrms will enter the market, selling similar products, reducing the 
ﬁrm’s demand to D2. This will cut into the ﬁrm’s revenues and proﬁts. How many new ﬁrms 
will enter, and how much will demand fall for any one ﬁrm? In economists’ approximation, 
it happens just up to the point where every ﬁrm is making zero economic proﬁts. (See the 
appendix to this chapter for a graphical explanation.)
Figure 18.5 The Effect of the Entry of New Firms on a Monopolistically Competitive Firm
A condition of easy entry and 
exit means that new ﬁrms 
can enter, driving down the 
demand experienced by any one 
monopolistically competitive ﬁrm.

Like the monopolist, the monopolistically competitive ﬁrm faces a downward-sloping 
demand curve and so produces less, and charges a higher price, than a perfectly competitive 
firm. As in the case of a perfectly competitive firm, however, free entry and exit in 
monopolistically competitive markets means that any positive economic proﬁts to be gained 
should only be temporary, as new competitors move in to exploit new opportunities to earn 
money.
3.4 MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION AND LONG-RUN EFFICIENCY
Compared to perfectly competitive ﬁrms, monopolistically competitive ﬁrms produce lower 
levels of output and charge higher prices. Like monopolies, they stop short of producing at 
levels where the social marginal beneﬁt of production is just equal to the social marginal 
cost. It can also be shown (and is shown in the appendix to this chapter) that such ﬁrms have 
higher unit costs than would occur in a perfectly competitive market. In short, they operate 
inefﬁciently.
Monopolistically competitive ﬁrms may, like monopolists, expend considerable resources 
to protect their miniature monopoly. While perhaps unable to keep competitors from entering 
their general industry, they can try, increasingly, to differentiate their product. Firms in this 

 
OLIGOPOLY 
403
kind of market structure are observed to engage in a great deal of nonprice competition. 
That is, they compete with other producers by advertising heavily in order to make buyers 
want their particular product (e.g., Gap jeans) and by using attractive signs and packaging, 
selecting better locations, varying their hours of operation, and so on.
In terms of social beneﬁt, it seems evident that resources would be better spent producing 
fewer varieties of goods and services, at lower costs, and with less advertising. Yet some cast 
a more positive light on the problem, focusing instead on consumer preferences. They argue 
that inefﬁciencies in production are merely the price that must be paid to satisfy consumers’ 
desire for variety (and, presumably, also for massive advertising and ﬂashy packaging). 
Although probably not the whole story, it may very well be that the highest social beneﬁt lies 
somewhere between dull, completely standardized products and the extreme proliferation of 
consumer goods that we currently observe.
Discussion Questions
1. Think of a somewhat differentiated good or service that you can buy locally in any number 
of different places—for example, a gallon of gasoline or a cup of coffee. Do you observe 
differences in prices? What differences might lead to these variations in prices? (Or is 
the assumption of perfect information violated? Does everyone know where the cheapest 
version can be found?) What examples of nonprice competition can you identify among 
the various sellers?
2. Do you think that the amount of variety in the goods and services that you are offered 
as a consumer is excessive? Just about right? Too limited? Do some forms of nonprice 
competition have consequences for long-term well-being and sustainability?
4. OLIGOPOLY
While oligopoly shares some characteristics of competitive markets, it is closer to monopoly 
in that a small number of ﬁrms possess a sizable share of the market. Oligopoly is similar 
to monopoly (and monopolistic competition) in that output is lower, and prices are higher, 
than would be the case under perfect competition. Oligopolists, like monopolists, may also 
possess signiﬁcant political and economic clout on local or national levels.
4.1 MARKET STRUCTURE OF AN OLIGOPOLISTIC INDUSTRY
The oligopolistic market structure is characterized by the following conditions:
1. The market is dominated by only a few sellers, at least some of which control enough of 
the market to be able to inﬂuence the market price.
2. Entry is difﬁcult.
The products produced by oligopolists may be either standardized or differentiated. Various 
assumptions may be made about how much information is available to producers and their 
customers in markets with oligopolies.
The most important implication of the condition that there are few ﬁrms is that the actions 
of each ﬁrm have effects on the market that rival ﬁrms cannot ignore. It means, among other 
things, that the rivals may respond in ways that, in turn, require a response from the original 
ﬁrm(s). In short, oligopoly exists if each ﬁrm must include, among the factors that it considers 
in deciding on its own actions, the possible reactions of rival ﬁrms.
Remember that in perfect competition the seller need not be concerned with the actions 
of others. All that such a seller needs to know is the market price. In the case of monopoly, 
of course, there are no other sellers to worry about. In the case of monopolistic competition, 
with many sellers, the effect of the action of any one seller is spread out over many other 
nonprice competi-
tion: competition 
through activities oth-
er than setting prices, 
such as advertising 
and location

404 
CHAPTER 18 — MARKETS WITH MARKET POWER
sellers. But in an oligopolistic situation, each ﬁrm needs to be keenly aware of what each of 
the (few) other ﬁrms is doing.
4.2 EXAMPLES OF OLIGOPOLY
An industrial concentration ratio is the share of total production, sales, or revenues attribut-
able to the largest producers in an industry. The share of domestic production accounted for 
by the four largest ﬁrms is a traditional indicator of how oligopolistic an industry has become. 
Despite the absence of a precise deﬁnition, we say that an oligopoly exists wherever a “small” 
number of ﬁrms (perhaps between four and ten) possess something more than a majority of 
the market share (e.g., about two-thirds of the market share or more).
We presented some data on industrial concentration ratios in Chapter 0. In addition, 
according to the U.S. government’s 2007 Economic Census (the most recent data 
available), the concentration ratio for credit card companies is 79 percent, for breakfast 
cereal manufacturing, 85 percent, and for glass container manufacturing, 86 percent. 
All three appear to satisfy even stringent criteria for oligopoly. The market for wireless 
telecommunications services is also dominated by just a few sellers. (See Box 18.2 for 
another example of oligopoly.)
4.3 OLIGOPOLY AND THE BEHAVIOR OF FIRMS
The behavior of oligopolistic ﬁrms is truly social in the sense of being interdependent with 
the behavior of other actors; hence it appears more complex than other market structures. 
Instead of one theory for oligopolies, economists have many, any of which might be helpful 
but none of which is deﬁnitive. We brieﬂy describe two of them here: ﬁrst, the theory of 
strategic interaction and game theory and, second, models of collusion, cartels, and price 
leadership.

BOX 18.2 OLIGOPOLY AND AIRLINE MERGERS
In February 2013, US Airways and American Airlines 
announced their intention to merge, an $11 billion 
deal that would create the world’s largest airline. The 
proposed merger follows a trend of consolidation in 
the airline industry in the United States. Between 2001 
and 2013, the top ten airline companies in the country 
had already combined to form ﬁve major carriers, 
including mergers of Northwest and Delta in 2008 
and United and Continental in 2010. If approved 
by federal regulators, the US Airways and American 
Airlines merger would create four “megacarriers” that 
would control 83 percent of the U.S. air passenger 
market.
Initially it seemed that the merger would easily 
receive approval, as had been the case with previous 
airline mergers. But in August 2013, the U.S. Justice 
Department, joined by the attorneys general of seven 
states, ﬁled a lawsuit to block the merger, arguing 
that it would cause “substantial harm” to passen-
gers by raising fares and reducing competition. The 
government noted that the merger would eliminate 
competition on more than 1,000 routes. Assistant 
Attorney General Bill Baer said, “As we look at the 
market today, it’s not functioning as competitively as 
it ought to be, and if this deal goes through, it’s going 
to be much worse.”
“This is the best news that consumers could have 
possible gotten,” said Charlie Leocha, director of the 
Consumer Travel Alliance. Leocha indicated that pre-
vious mergers have led to higher fares and reduced 
choices for travelers and that the proposed merger 
would have the same result.
One possible outcome is that the merger will still 
be approved, but only with some concessions by the 
two airlines. For example, they may be forced to give 
up some landing and take-off slots at busy Reagan 
National Airport outside Washington, DC, thus al-
lowing for increased competition from other airlines. 
Meanwhile, the airlines contend that allowing them to 
merge will improve their ability to compete with other 
large carriers, such as United and Delta.

OLIGOPOLY 
405
Strategic Interaction and Game Theory
One theory is that oligopolistic ﬁrms will act strategically against one another, plotting their 
moves as though they were generals planning a war or opponents in a game of chess. Oli-
gopolistic sellers are often seen as engaging in “competition” in the active, aggressive sense 
in which business managers use this term. That is, oligopolistic ﬁrms choose prices, marketing 
strategies, and the like, with an eye to “beating out” speciﬁc rivals and gaining greater market 
share at their expense. A classic example is the rivalry between Coke and Pepsi.
Game theory, which has its origin in the work of mathematician John von Neumann 
(1903–1957) and economist Oskar Morgenstern (1902–1977), provides a framework for the 
formal analysis of some types of strategic behavior. For example, consider a market with 
two sellers, also known as a duopoly. Suppose that each is trying to decide whether to set a 
low or a high price for the good that they both sell. They need to pay attention to what the 
other one does, because if Firm 1 sets a high price, Firm 2 might set a low price and end up 
with all the customers (or vice versa). Using game theory, we can describe a payoff matrix, 
as shown in Figure 18.6.

The entries in the payoff matrix show the proﬁt level that each ﬁrm can expect, given its 
choice and the choice of its rival. The combination “loss, high proﬁt” in the bottom-left cell, 
for example, shows that if Firm 1 sets a high price while Firm 2 sets a low price, Firm 1 will 
make a loss, while Firm 2—which now has all the customers—will make high proﬁts. (Test 
yourself: What does the upper-right-hand cell represent?) Clearly, each ﬁrm would ﬁnd it to its 
own advantage to be the only low-price seller in the market. Recognition of this fact could lead 
to a price war, in which each ﬁrm progressively cuts its prices in order to try to be the low-
price seller. Although a price war could, in some real-world cases, last until one party went out 
of business, in Figure 18.6 we have illustrated a case in which, when both ﬁrms set low prices, 
both keep a share of customers and make low proﬁts. This is shown in the cell at the upper 
left. However, if both set high prices, as shown in the bottom-right cell, they could both make 
moderate proﬁts while keeping a share of customers.
In this model, we assume that the ﬁrms are “noncooperative”—that is, that they are 
archrivals and do not communicate or cooperate with each other. Noncooperative game 
theory suggests that a rational ﬁrm will choose the option that will leave it best off (or least 
damaged) regardless of what its rival does. Looking at the payoff matrix in Figure 18.6, we 
can see that Firm 1 will choose to set a low price rather than a high price. If Firm 1 sets a 
low price and Firm 2 chooses “low,” Firm 1 gets low, but positive, proﬁts. If Firm 1 sets a 
low price and Firm 2 chooses “high,” Firm 1 gets high proﬁts. Regardless of what Firm 2 
does, then, Firm 1 gets better outcomes than the corresponding loss or moderate proﬁts than it 
would get by setting a high price. A similar analysis for Firm 2 shows that it also will choose 
to set its prices low. The “solution” to the game is the (low proﬁt, low proﬁt) cell. Yet in a 
certain sense it is not a solution at all, since what appears individually rational for each ﬁrm 
actually produces a perverse outcome that is suboptimal for both.

CHAPTER 18 — MARKETS WITH MARKET POWER
Scenarios such as this are often referred to as “prisoner’s dilemmas” because of the well-
known formulation in terms of prisoners who are held separately and asked to confess to 
a crime that they committed together. If neither confesses, they both go free after one year 
(call this situation a “plea bargain”). However, if only one confesses (ratting on the other), 
he goes free while the other goes to jail for 10 years. If both confess, they each are sentenced 
to jail for three years. The best strategy, for a prisoner who does not know what his partner 
in crime will do, is to confess. That way, he is assured of not having to go to jail for more 
than three years. (What outcome would be best for both? What would be necessary for them 
to achieve it?)
Strategic thinking can also be applied to nonprice competition, which oligopolists also 
frequently employ. For example, sellers may need to decide whether to spend a lot or a little 
on advertising, packaging, and booths at sales conventions. What they decide to do will, at 
least in part, depend on what their rivals do. Nonprice competition is most likely when each 
ﬁrm is selling a somewhat differentiated product.
Another form of game theory imagines that the parties do not make their decisions 
simultaneously, as in our example, but one after the other. The theory of “sequential games” 
covers situations in which one ﬁrm moves ﬁrst and then the second chooses its strategy. Each 
ﬁrm’s expectations about the reaction of the other are key to describing the probable outcomes 
of such a game. More recently, formal game theory has also been applied to “cooperative” 
games in which, for example, actors may bargain toward a mutually beneﬁcial outcome.
Collusion, Cartels, and Price Leadership
Clearly, Firm 1 and Firm 2 in the above example (not to mention the prisoners) would do better 
if they got together and agreed on a joint strategy that gave them both their best outcomes. 
If the two ﬁrms could make a binding agreement to both keep their prices high, they could 
both make moderate proﬁts instead of ending up at the noncooperative solution in which each 
makes low proﬁts. Firms that cooperate in this way are said to engage in collusion. They get 
together and form a monopoly (at least a local one) for pricing purposes, even though they 
keep their production activities separate.
Cartels such as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are examples 
of explicit collusion. OPEC did not try to keep its collusion a secret but instead announced 
its formation and its high prices.
Tacit collusion takes place when sellers collude more subtly, without creation of a cartel. 
Because cartels are by and large illegal in many industrialized countries, sellers must often 
pass information around on the sly. An industry association may collect information and post 
it on the Web so that all members will know what price the others are charging. Such ﬂows of 
information make it easier to cooperate and to monitor compliance with tacit price ﬁxing, in 
which all sellers implicitly agree to maintain a common price. One form of implicit collusion 
is price leadership, in which everyone in the industry looks to one ﬁrm, raising their prices 
when it does and lowering them likewise. Such price leadership, many believe, characterized 
the U.S. steel and airlines industries for years. Price leadership tends to be more common 
when the ﬁrms all sell identical, standardized products.
However, as members of OPEC discovered, collusion can be hard to sustain. Each seller has an 
incentive to undercut the set price privately, in order to sell a little more. Nevertheless, collusion 
has sometimes been persistent. Members may realize that it is in their greater long-term interest 
to stick with the collusive price rather than to risk losing everything by starting a price war.
4.4 HOW COMMON IS OLIGOPOLY?
Oligopolistic industries tend to be inefﬁcient, for the same reasons that monopoly often is. 
In fact, oligopoly is often even less efﬁcient. Because production decisions remain separate, 
there is less possibility of even reaping advantages of economies of scale.
collusion: coopera-
tion among potential 
rivals to gain market 
power as a group
tacit collusion: col-
lusion that takes place 
without creation of a 
cartel
price ﬁxing: a form 
of collusion in which 
a group of sellers 
implicitly agrees to 
maintain a common 
price
price leadership: 
a form of collusion 
in which many sell-
ers follow the price 
changes instituted by 
one particular seller

 
IMPERFECT COMPETITION IN AGRICULTURE AND HEALTH CARE 
407
Although oligopoly has traditionally been deﬁned in terms of few sellers and difﬁcult entry, 
the key feature that distinguishes the behavior of sellers is not so much the number of them 
as the existence of interdependence among them. A market can, in fact, display oligopolistic 
characteristics even with easy entry and hence many possible sellers. When four ﬁrms 
control 80 percent of the market, for example, it has little effect on their behavior whether 
the remaining 20 percent of the market is divided among 10 sellers or 1,000.
Oligopolies can also be local. Not all industries experience high concentration ratios at 
the national level. For example, the U.S. Census indicates that in 2007 the top four retail 
ﬂorists shared 2.1 percent of the total national market, and the top four credit unions shared 
10.1 percent. Even when industries are not so concentrated at the national level, however, 
ﬁrms may behave in somewhat oligopolistic ways more locally. If there are two ﬂorists in a 
town, for example, you can bet that each keeps track of what the other is charging, where it 
is advertising, and how it adjusts its prices on Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day!
Market structures in which sellers need to take into account the actions of other sellers, 
and then respond effectively and creatively, are possibly more prevalent in the real world than 
monopolistic competition (although certainty on this question would require precise deﬁnitions 
of each in terms of the respective concentration ratios). And even apparent monopolies are 
normally oligopolistic when one takes a closer look.
Take Microsoft, which is a good real-world example of a near-monopoly. Because computer 
users can still choose Macintosh or Linux operating systems, and because Microsoft can 
reasonably fear that the creation of a new technology could destroy its monopoly powers, it is 
not quite a pure monopoly. And we had mentioned McDonald’s and Wendy’s as monopolistic 
competitors, but you can be sure that they keep a watchful eye on each other’s locations, 
pricing, and promotional strategies.
The need to take into account others’ actions is important in traditional economics’ 
narrowly deﬁned (i.e., “few sellers”) idea of oligopoly. But it is also of broader importance 
because rarely can any real-world company, of any size or in any industry, safely ignore the 
actions taken by others. Studies of economics, business, sociology, and politics share many 
common concerns when the prevalence of truly interdependent economic decision-making 
is taken into account.
Discussion Questions
1. What would it mean for two sellers to act noncooperatively, in a “prisoner’s dilemma” 
manner? What real world examples can you think of? What, instead, would it mean for 
two sellers to collude? Which of the two outcomes is more common in the real world? 
Why?
2. Suppose that a seller in a duopoly needs to decide whether to spend a lot or a little on 
advertising. Assume that the consumers are already reasonably well informed about the 
product, so the purpose of a lot of advertising is to draw customers away from the rival. 
How could the payoffs from this situation resemble those in Figure 18.6? Draw a payoff 
matrix illustrating this case (with options “spend a lot” or “spend a little” and outcomes 
of low, moderate, or high proﬁts) and describe the noncooperative solution. What if the 
government decided to ban advertising in this industry (as it has, in the past, banned adver-
tising of cigarettes and alcohol in various media)? Would that help or hurt the companies’ 
proﬁts?
5. IMPERFECT COMPETITION IN AGRICULTURE AND HEALTH CARE
We now turn to a more in-depth discussion of two markets: agriculture and health care. These 
two markets are illustrative of many of the concepts we have been discussing in this chapter, 
as well as throughout the book, including economic efﬁciency, market failure, externalities, 
equity, and the role of government.

408 
CHAPTER 18 — MARKETS WITH MARKET POWER
5.1 AGRICULTURE
On the face of it, markets for agricultural products should be a textbook case of perfect com-
petition or at least something approaching it. Products are mostly undifferentiated—although 
this has changed in recent years, with growing attention to organic and locally produced 
food—and there exist a multitude of producers, many small and without market power. Yet 
U.S. agriculture has not been “competitive” for many years. Indeed, many economists ﬁnd 
ironic the fact that, when they teach introductory economics, they often cite this market as a 
classic example of market distortion.
What types of distortion are present in agriculture, and how did the market get to be this 
way? Without going into great detail about the history, U.S. farmers struggled immensely 
during the Great Depression, when food prices dropped precipitously, because of both the 
forces of demand (a drop in demand from European countries) and supply (overproduction 
in response to price spikes during the 1920s). In order to keep many thousands of farmers 
from going bankrupt, the U.S. government embarked on an ambitious farm policy that, in 
many ways, continues to this day. What it entailed was basically the creation of a price ﬂoor 
in the agricultural markets (recall the discussion of price ﬂoors and price ceilings in Chapter 
6), in which the government subsidized farmers for any difference between the food market 
price and what was deemed to be a “fair” price.
The problem with such a policy—and in 80 years it has never encountered a shortage of 
critics—is that it tends to “distort” markets for food. By setting a minimum price above the 
market price, the effect has been to stimulate overproduction—that is, production of food in 
an amount far greater than the quantity demanded at the market (i.e., unsubsidized) price.
We can see this in Figure 18.7. In the absence of any distortion, the market achieves 
equilibrium (point E) where the market price is Pm and the quantity produced, Qm. When the 
government agrees to pay the subsidy to the farmer, the farmer now receives Pm + s. The 
“distortion” is the artiﬁcially produced surplus that, you will note, does not look the same 
as in the example from Chapter 6. The reason is that in this case the consumer still pays Pm 
(the whole purpose of the subsidy) and is therefore still motivated to buy Qm. The surplus, 
or amount overproduced, is shown as QP – Qm.

When the government provides a 
subsidy, it distorts the market. With 
the subsidy, farmers overproduce, 
and inefﬁciency results.
The manner in which the United States disposes of its surplus has varied over the years, 
and depending on crop type, but it usually has involved either selling it to other countries—as 
when the United States shipped vast amounts of surplus wheat to the Soviet Union in the 
early 1970s—providing it at low or no cost to very poor countries, or simply destroying it. 
The critics of the overall policy make the following points:

 
IMPERFECT COMPETITION IN AGRICULTURE AND HEALTH CARE 
409
s  U.S. farmland is being degraded faster than it would be with less incentive to 
overproduce.
s  Rich farmers with large landholdings have received a disproportionately large share of the 
subsidies, making it all the harder for small farms to survive against this competition.
s  Although in the short run the cheap or free food that poor countries receive from the United 
States may be essential to relieve a famine, in the long run it often drives farmers in those 
countries out of business, as they have to lower their prices to compete and often are unable 
to cover their production costs.
Taking another approach, the government has sometimes subsidized (i.e., paid) farmers 
to keep their land fallow (i.e., unplanted). In any case, what seems clear is that allocative 
efﬁciency was not the primary goal of U.S. agricultural policy. Instead, since the 1930s, the 
government has placed a great priority on protecting the U.S. farmer’s livelihood.
In itself, this is a laudable objective. But aside from inefﬁciency, there is another 
consequence not visible in the above diagram. Figure 18.7, like many others in the book, 
presents a static interpretation of the problem—that is, viewed at a particular point in time. It 
does not provide any dynamic analysis or explanation of the likely response to the distortion 
in the market. That omission is critical, because herein lies one of the principal causes of the 
transformation of U.S. agriculture into an oligopolistic market. Whereas small family farms 
once dominated U.S. farming, today the majority of agricultural products are grown on a 
small number of (increasingly large) farms controlled by agribusiness giants like Cargill or 
Archer-Daniels Midland. As of 2010, the United States had 2.2 million farms, compared with 
5.7 million in 1950, and the average farm size in 2010 was 418 acres, more than twice the 
average 60 years earlier (208 acres).
The growth in U.S average farm size since the 1930s has two main causes. The ﬁrst, 
indeed, is a response to the original farm support policies, which both provoked new farming 
ventures and motivated consolidation of landholding, because the amount of the government 
subsidy was often tied to the size of the farm. The second was the self-perpetuating nature 
of scale economies. As farms became larger, they, like other industries, proﬁted from 
economies of scale and were better able to shoulder rapidly increasing costs—especially 
after 1970—associated with the increasing mechanization of agriculture, increased price of 
petroleum, and higher interest rates on loans. A not-uncommon story, consequently, was the 
failure of smaller farms to compete and their sale to larger farms. The process, repeated many 
times across the country, only contributed to the concentration of land ownership.
Politics also played a role. Although the United States had been moving to limit 
overproduction in agriculture in earlier decades, in the early 1970s, U.S. Secretary of 
Agriculture Earl Butz took a very strident pro–big business approach. He is often credited 
with (or blamed for, depending on one’s point of view) subsidizing the development of large 
commercial corn production and the growing use of inexpensive corn in prepared foods. It 
was not until 1996 that U.S. farm policy took a turn in the direction of a greater exposure to 
the market (with the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act), but stern opposition 
from politicians representing farming states in Congress led to a reversion to the earlier 
support policies.
As mentioned earlier in the section on monopoly, large companies with economies of scale 
have the potential to be very efﬁcient if they produce large volumes at lower prices. This was 
Secretary Butz’s argument in the early 1970s: Farms should be big in order to justify and 
support the mechanization and investment in new technology that would make farms much 
more efﬁcient. Although the debate continues on whether large farms are more efﬁcient than 
small ones, there are certainly disadvantages to excess market power in agriculture. As also 
noted earlier, lack of sufﬁcient competition potentially makes oligopolistic ﬁrms complacent 
and less innovative. For those who believe that economics is not just about efﬁciency and 

410 
CHAPTER 18 — MARKETS WITH MARKET POWER
production growth but also about people, output and price controls seemed to be the best way 
of dealing with the problem at the time.
The Great Depression was admittedly an exceptional period in our history, and the argument 
that farm policy has outlived its usefulness has its merits. Certainly, it has produced some 
unintended consequences, most of all the reduced number and viability of small farms. But many 
maintain that because food is a basic necessity, and because food prices are sometimes quite 
volatile, agricultural markets should continue to be regulated. Indeed, the main issue today might 
be not whether to regulate agriculture but the extent to which agricultural subsidies should favor 
the giant agricultural middlemen and the large producers who appear least to need them.
5.2 HEALTH CARE
The market for health care is remarkable in its complexity. It is, in fact, composed of numer-
ous interrelated markets. For example, a variety of markets exist for different types of care—
traditional medicine, allopathic medicine, homeopathy, herbal healers, and so forth—and 
markets for drugs and other pharmaceuticals. Moreover, there are markets for the insurance 
that in many cases pay for a variety of health-care services.
Classiﬁcation of health care in terms of market structure depends on the speciﬁc market. 
The health insurance industry is oligopolistic because insurance premiums are more or less 
“set” by the relatively few insurers that control most of the market. Likewise, the relatively 
few pharmaceutical companies—or to be more precise, few large ones—have considerable 
market power, enhanced by generous patents granted by the government. Hospitals might 
also be reasonably considered regional oligopolies—or even monopolies, in more sparsely 
populated areas. Many attribute rapidly rising health-care costs in recent years to the substantial 
market power present in the industry (see Box 18.3).
The markets that connect individual health-care providers and “consumers” are, however, 
more difﬁcult to classify. They would appear to have more of the attributes of competitive 
BOX 18.3 RISING HEALTH-CARE COSTS AND MARKET POWER
A 2010 analysis by the Massachusetts Attorney 
General’s ofﬁce analyzed possible causes of rising 
health-care costs in the state. The report’s conclusion 
is that higher costs can be attributed primarily to the 
exercise of market power by hospitals and physicians 
groups, rather than by improvements in the quality of 
care or the cost of providing care.
The analysis looked at the compensation that dif-
ferent health-care providers received from insurance 
companies. It found that the amount of compensation 
received by hospitals can vary by a factor of two for 
the same health-care services. In other words, some 
hospitals appear to be able to negotiate higher rates 
from insurance companies, not on the basis of provid-
ing better care but due to an ability to leverage their 
market power. Insurance companies, in turn, charge 
higher premiums to their customers.
The report found that “serious systemwide failings 
in the commercial health insurance marketplace” exist 
in the state. Massachusetts Attorney General Martha 
Coakley said, “Our review shows that the current sys-
tem of health care payment is not always value-based, 
and health care providers throughout the state are 
compensated at widely different rates for providing 
similar quality and complexity of services.”
Based on the report, the state is looking at evaluating 
ways to rein in rising health-care costs. One proposal is 
to move away from a “fee-for-service” system, in which 
hospitals and physicians are paid for each procedure that 
they perform, thus creating an incentive for unnecessary 
tests and operations. An alternative is a “capitated” sys-
tem, in which hospitals and physicians receive a set pay-
ment from insurers for each patient they serve. Another 
cost-control option, favored by Governor Deval Patrick, 
is to give the state the authority to regulate “excessive or 
unreasonable” insurance premium rate increases. But 
Jim Klocke, executive vice president of the Greater Boston 
Chamber of Commerce, said that giving the state the 
power “to play a formal role in the price-setting process 
is not the right approach.”

IMPERFECT COMPETITION IN AGRICULTURE AND HEALTH CARE 
411
markets, and it is certainly true that no providers control a substantial share of any mass 
market. Yet none of the individual markets are highly competitive either, for a number of 
reasons. Here we discuss four.
Heterogeneous Product
To begin with, recall that an important feature of perfect competition is that the product sold 
be identical or homogenous. This is clearly not the case in some markets in the health-care 
industry. One example is the quality of medical treatment. As countless online “reviews” 
attest, there is a great variety in quality, both of individual physicians and specialists and of 
hospitals. To the extent that the reviews accurately reﬂect reality, a doctor or a hospital judged 
“superior” might be justiﬁed in charging a higher price than other providers.
Even the “product” sold by the health insurance companies is highly variable. In contrast 
to the “single payer” insurance found in Canada and most European countries, for which 
coverage is more or less the same for all residents, there are numerous “tiers” of insurance 
in the United States. And each tier differs in the details, depending on the speciﬁc company 
offering the coverage. For example, most insurance companies today require a copayment, a 
way of ensuring that the consumer has some “skin in the game” so as to discourage overuse of 
health-care services. The size of this payment varies greatly as do the conditions under which 
it is paid—for example, for specialists only or for emergency care—and the restrictions on 
services covered (based on, e.g., if a provider is “signed up” with the insurance company). 
So we might almost consider meaningless the question of the “market price” of a particular 
health-care service.
Barriers to Entry
Another way in which health care differs from the idealized model of perfect competition 
is in the presence of barriers to entry. In the case of U.S. health insurance, the industry is 
oligopolistic, dominated by several fairly large companies that cover most of the market. As 
discussed earlier, it is exceedingly difﬁcult to break into such a market as a small upstart. 
Providers of medical care face licensing requirements—medical school, licensing exams, and 
so on—that keep all but the most qualiﬁed from becoming doctors.
There certainly are good reasons for keeping unqualiﬁed individuals from practicing 
medicine. Yet the problem with such an entry barrier, many have argued, is that it grants undue 
protection to existing practitioners, potentially providing insufﬁcient incentive to deliver the 
best possible quality. It is not our place to say whether these restrictions and protections are, 
on balance, for good or ill; certainly, both sides have valid arguments. But it is sufﬁcient here 
to emphasize that entry barriers in health care can be substantial.
Information Asymmetry
Another basic attribute of a perfectly competitive market is the presence of “perfect informa-
tion.” In other words, classical economic theory presumes that both sides of the market—
suppliers and “demanders”—have access to all the relevant information necessary to make 
an informed decision. This is decidedly not the case with health care.
What some economists call “information asymmetry”—a situation in which some market 
participants are more informed than others—is present, for example, when a doctor sees a 
patient. The patient is, in most cases, inadequately informed to make a proper judgment about 
whether a particular test or procedure that the doctor recommends is really necessary, so 
generally the doctor is simply trusted. Although the patient in many cases does not directly 
pay for most of what might be unnecessary procedures, the ultimate consequence—since 
the insurance companies end up ﬁnancing an inefﬁciently high number of them—is that 
everyone’s health insurance premiums go up.

412 
CHAPTER 18 — MARKETS WITH MARKET POWER
Such asymmetry of information is also present between the patient and the insurance 
company. Most Americans have their health insurance company pay directly for a majority of 
their health-care expenses (in exchange for payment—usually monthly—of a ﬁxed premium, 
privately or through an employer), and one can easily imagine how such a system could 
encourage overuse of medical services. As the marginal cost of many health-care services 
for insured individuals is zero, or very low, people have an incentive to demand services 
that may be unnecessary or very expensive. Further contributing to rising health-care costs, 
doctors are typically paid by insurance companies on the basis of each service performed, 
rather than actual health care outcomes.
Another issue is that individuals in poor health have a greater incentive to purchase 
insurance in the ﬁrst place than those in relatively good health. This requires insurance 
companies to make more payments than they would expect if they were covering a random 
mix of sick and well, causing them to raise premiums to avoid losing money. This is a problem 
of adverse selection, in which the higher premiums further discourage healthy members of 
the population from signing up, and so on in a vicious cycle, eventually making the premiums 
so high as to jeopardize the system itself. While it is not actually as simple as this—to be 
sure, millions of healthy Americans have insurance, most because their employer helps pay 
for it—there is no question that premiums are inefﬁciently high due to disproportionate use 
of health-care services by the unhealthy.
The problem would easily be avoided by charging lower premiums to healthier people, not 
unlike what is done by life insurance companies. But this is, in practice, extremely difﬁcult 
to do, because information asymmetry is much greater when it comes to determining the 
overall “healthiness” of an individual (e.g., one person might have a chronically bad back but 
be otherwise healthy, another might suffer from allergies, etc.) than for statistically assessing 
mortality based on a few critical health indicators. Also, even if feasible, it would imply that 
those who are already chronically ill would face prohibitively high premiums, an outcome that 
few people desire. Some insurance companies retain provisions for “pre-existing conditions” 
as a pretext for excluding new participants who are already sick, and these are precisely the 
people that the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” is in part designed to protect.
Market Price
A ﬁnal feature of a perfectly competitive market that is absent from health care is the presence 
of a clear and unambiguous market price. This is lacking even for basic medicines. Anyone who 
purchases pharmaceuticals has no doubt observed the signiﬁcantly higher price charged for, say, 
the branded aspirin than for the generic (or “store brand”) version—even though the two products 
are identical in their formulation. For another example, Walmart can sell some over-the-counter 
medicines (such as eye drops) at half the price set by other pharmacies due to a number of the 
store’s outstanding characteristics: low costs due to efﬁciency, economies of scale, and low wages 
as well as enormous price-setting power, which allows it to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical 
companies. It is even harder to imagine a single, clear price for other health-care services, such as 
visits to doctor’s ofﬁces or to hospitals, because there is so much variability among them.
Entry barriers, mentioned earlier, confound matters further. Lack of severe competition 
permits doctors, for instance, to discriminate based on price—familiar to most as having a 
“sliding scale.” It is difﬁcult to imagine the higher prices being sustained in the presence of 
greater competition. And information asymmetry plays perhaps the greatest role in failure 
to achieve a clear market price. Because insurance companies, health-care providers, and 
ordinary people all “trade” using different amounts—and quality—of information (about how 
necessary a procedure might be, its likelihood of success, its affordability, etc.), it might be 
surprising that prices are ever consistent.
Regarding price, another important consideration is that health care has an important 
“public good” dimension. The beneﬁt of a vaccine, for example, is not only obtained by 
adverse selection: 
a system that favors 
the weaker members 
of a given population, 
generally to the detri-
ment of the system 
itself

 
SUMMARY AND A FINAL NOTE 
413
individuals, but also by everyone else living in a population of (mostly) vaccinated individuals 
(namely, a much lower chance of contracting the disease in question). Likewise, the beneﬁts 
of psychiatric medications include the diminished likelihood, for everyone, of confronting 
an overabundance of mentally ill individuals. Because such indirect or residual beneﬁts are 
“public”—that is, they do not enter into the private beneﬁt-cost calculation of buyer and 
seller—they cannot be reﬂected in the market price.
Many have raised arguments about ways in which this sector of the economy could be 
made more competitive, with the goal of allocating resources more efﬁciently. Laudable 
as the goal no doubt is, there is something unique about health care—the fact that it is a 
fundamental human necessity and its provision is often plagued by market failure—that 
forces us to reconsider whether market-based approaches work best.
Another element to the problem is perhaps the most critical. Health insurance 
companies ultimately decide which claims they will pay. In most cases, then, they 
effectively decide whether a prescribed medical treatment will be undertaken, because 
most people would be unwilling (or, often, unable) to pay for it out of pocket. If the 
decisions of the insurers were based on their expertise in the area of medicine and their 
concern for the well-being of the insured, the present system would make a lot more 
sense. But the insurance company is fundamentally pursuing proﬁt, which, of course, 
is not in itself a bad thing. The problem is when the pursuit of proﬁt conﬂicts with the 
objective of ensuring patient health.
When compared to other countries, the United States does not perform well in terms of 
national health indicators. Although average life expectancy certainly is much higher in the 
country than in the far poorer countries of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, it is not as 
high as in most industrialized countries—that is, Western European countries, Canada, Japan, 
Australia, and New Zealand. And the United States also compares unfavorably, in terms of 
life expectancy and infant mortality, with a growing number of “middle-income” countries 
(e.g., Costa Rica, Cuba). None of this proves that other health-care systems—such as, most 
notably, a “single payer” system—are superior to one based on private proﬁts and markets. 
But the evidence does call for research into the question of whether better systems might 
exist for delivering health care.
Discussion Questions
1. Select the topic of either agriculture or health, and answer the following questions:
a. What do you think is the single biggest problem in this area of the economy?
b. What kind of policy do you favor to help to overcome that problem?
c. What makes it difﬁcult to implement the policy that you favor?
2. Should the health-care industry become more like a competitive free market? Do you 
think that it would help bring costs down? How might such a change come about? What 
might be some potentially undesirable consequences?
6. SUMMARY AND A FINAL NOTE
The traditional four-way categorization of markets, summarized in Table 18.2, can be 
helpful in thinking about how market structure can affect the incentives facing ﬁrms. It is 
important to remember that the differences between these classiﬁcations are not always 
clear. In particular, in many real-world markets, sellers need to keep track of what others 
in their industry are doing and to plan strategically, whether there are few sellers or many. 
Such interdependent activity requires analysis that is beyond the scope of simple models 
of marginal thinking. Moreover, as we think about market power, we need to recognize 
that globalization, which has intensiﬁed in recent decades, has made dramatic changes in 
market conditions. Traditional categories may therefore no longer cover all of the most 
important situations.

414 
CHAPTER 18 — MARKETS WITH MARKET POWER
The classical economic discussion of markets tends to focus on the beneﬁts of “free” 
markets and competition. When the discussion turns to market power, economists mostly 
focus largely on ﬁrms that may have the power to affect prices in the markets where they 
sell goods that they have produced.
Market power, however, is much more widespread. For example,
s  Governments, nonproﬁt organizations, and individuals can have market power. In some 
states and counties, for example, governments have a monopoly on liquor sales. An indi-
vidual selling a unique work of art has market power.
s  .ONPRICE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EXCHANGE SUCH AS DELIVERY DATES QUALITY STANDARDS AND length of contracts can be manipulated by economic actors with market power.
s  Market power can exist in nonproduct markets, such as markets for resale of goods, markets 
for resources, and ﬁnancial markets.
s  Market power can occur on the buyers’ side. That is, market power can be used to affect the 
prices paid by ﬁrms to their suppliers for inputs, including human labor. The cases of monopsony 
(one buyer) and oligopsony (few buyers) were discussed in Chapter 10 on labor markets.
Market power, therefore, refers to much more than the ability of ﬁrms to set prices above 
marginal cost. Although the classical analysis of market power tends to stress its detrimental 
consequences in terms of lost efﬁciency—an issue of concern from the point of view of the 
consumer—the consequences of market power in terms of fairness and distributional effects 
are often at least as important, if not more so, to human well-being. If, for example, market 
power allows a few large companies to force consumers to pay more for food while at the 
same time making earning a living increasingly difﬁcult for small farmers, this could be at 
least as damaging to human well-being as the market power that allows a ﬁrm to set prices 
above marginal cost. A similar argument is easily made regarding the market power enjoyed 
by the pharmaceutical and the health insurance giants.
Market power is frequently used to impose externalities upon society. For example, a large 
manufacturer may lobby to gain an exemption from a pollution regulation. Thus instead of 
having the manufacturer pay the costs of pollution control, society pays costs in terms of 
poorer health and ecosystem damages. 
The most important lesson here is to remember both the usefulness and limitations of textbook 
models. Abstract and admittedly simpliﬁed models of perfect competition and monopoly help 
us to understand the basics of how certain key ingredients of a market economy function. It is

critically important to be able to generalize across many examples across the world, and over time, 
in order to gain general insight into how the economy works. But it is equally important—if not 
more so—not to idealize the models to the point that they come to be seen as reality itself.
Neither free markets nor monopolies exist in their purest sense; the world is far more 
complicated than this. The challenge is to learn to properly utilize the insights gained from 
economic models in the analysis of complex real-world problems. As should be clear from the 
examples in this book, it is often difﬁcult to separate economic concepts of efﬁciency from 
issues of ethics, fairness, sustainability, and distribution. As the present chapter illustrates, 
market power often implies other forms of political power. The proper use of economic 
modeling and analysis recognizes both its usefulness and its limitations, in guiding us to a 
better understanding, and better policies, on agriculture, health, and many other issues that 
are critical for human well-being.

it earns no addition to proﬁts. If one of the chains 
is the only one to open an outlet, it makes high ad-
ditional proﬁts. If they both open outlets, they have 
to split the available market, and they make only 
more moderate additional proﬁts.

APPENDIX: FORMAL ANALYSIS OF MONOPOLY AND MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION
A1. THE ASSUMPTIONS
This appendix shows how monopoly and monopolistic competition market structures can be 
formally treated within a model of proﬁt-maximizing ﬁrms. 
A2. MONOPOLY
Suppose that our ﬁrm is a monopolist, with the marginal revenue schedule shown in Table 
18.1 and Figure 18.1 and with the marginal cost curve shown in Figure 18.1. As described in 
this chapter, the monopolist maximizes proﬁts by setting MR = MC. It produces 5 units, at 
a marginal cost of about $12, and sells them for a price of $28. Adding in the average total 
cost curve of the ﬁrm enables us to identify the area of economic proﬁt, as shown in Figure 

 
APPENDIX: FORMAL ANALYSIS OF MONOPOLY AND MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION 
417
18.8. The ﬁrm’s revenues include both shaded areas, whereas its costs are represented by the 
darker-shaded rectangle. The monopolist makes positive economic proﬁt equal to the area 
of the ligher-shaded rectangle.
A3. MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION
A monopolistically competitive ﬁrm faces a downward-sloping demand curve. Yet, like a 
perfectly competitive ﬁrm, it also makes zero economic proﬁts in the long run.
This case is illustrated in Figure 18.9. Like a monopolist, the monopolistically competitive 
ﬁrm will choose to produce the quantity corresponding to point A, where MR = MC. It will 
charge a price corresponding to point B on the demand curve. Point B is also on the ATC curve 
in the long run. Thus the shaded rectangle represents both total revenue (price × quantity) and 
total cost (average total cost × quantity). The ﬁrm makes zero economic proﬁts.
How does this come about? Look back at Figure 18.5. If the price were above the ATC 
curve, the ﬁrm would make positive economic proﬁts, and (because there is free entry) new 
ﬁrms would enter the industry. This causes the demand curve for this ﬁrm’s differentiated 
product to shift downward. The demand curve is imagined to shift downward until it just 
touches the ATC curve, as shown in Figure 18.9.

The monopolist sells its product at 
a per-unit price that is higher than 
its per-unit cost of production, 
thus reaping positive economic 
proﬁts. Revenues are represented 
by the total shaded area. The

of revenues over costs—the

19 Introduction to Macroeconomics
1. WHAT IS MACROECONOMICS ABOUT?
As we noted in Chapter 1, while microeconomics emphasizes the economic activities and 
interactions of individuals, ﬁrms, and other speciﬁc organizations, macroeconomics looks 
at the workings of the economy as a whole, at the national—and often the global—level. 
There is continuous interaction between the microeconomic and macroeconomic levels of 
the economy. The macroeconomic situation is based on the behavior of millions of individual 
economic actors, and at the same time economic conditions at the aggregate level create the 
environment in which individual economic actors make their decisions. These conditions 
include rates of unemployment and inﬂation, ecological limits and constraints, degrees of 
economic inequality, and social/cultural assumptions about trust and responsibility.
For example, when you seek paid work in your chosen ﬁeld, your success will depend in part 
on both micro- and macroeconomic factors. On the microeconomic side, you will need to have 
prepared yourself for the work—invested in your own “human capital,” an economist would 
say. You will need to ﬁnd a particular business or other agency that can use your skills—or ﬁnd 
direct buyers for your services, if you decide to strike out on your own. You will want to ﬁnd 
work that gives you a combination of job satisfaction, income, and beneﬁts that you like.
But will employers in general be hiring? Some graduating classes are unlucky and ﬂood 
the job market just as the national economy is “going sour”—that is, entering a recession. 
No matter how well-prepared you are, ﬁnding a job can be tough during a period of high 
unemployment, when many people who seek jobs are not successful in ﬁnding one. And 
if you do ﬁnd a job, how far will your paycheck go toward meeting your standard-of-living 
desires? If you start working during a period of high inﬂation, when the overall level of prices 
is increasing, the purchasing power of a ﬁxed paycheck will be quickly eroded.
Macroeconomic conditions also affect personal debt. If you are like most students these days, 
you will be paying back loans for a number of years. The higher the prevailing real interest rates 
in the economy, the more costly this borrowing will be. Your own economic well-being will 
also be tied to global issues such as trade ﬂows and currency exchange rates—especially if you 
go to work for a business that does a lot of importing or exporting or you send money back to 
relatives in a home country. If you are lucky, all these factors will fall in your favor. If you are 
not . . . well, then you can join the chorus blaming “the economy” for your troubles.
Such macroeconomic issues are considered “short run”—economists refer to them as having 
to do with macroeconomic “ﬂuctuations.” Sometimes unemployment is high, and sometimes 
it is low, and the same goes for inﬂation, interest rates, trade deﬁcits, and exchange rates.
Other macroeconomic issues have to do with the long run. Can you expect your standard 
of living twenty years from now, or the standard of living of your children, to be higher or 
lower than what you enjoy now? Are you living in a society where all people have a chance 
to develop themselves, or are extremes of wealth and poverty becoming more pronounced

as lasting for two

quarters or more

CHAPTER 19 — INTRODUCTION TO MACROECONOMICS
over time? What is the supply of natural resources used in production processes, and what is 
the quality of those resources? What other social and environmental factors affect the ability 
of the economy to prosper, or threaten its success?
Macroeconomics seeks to explain an especially interesting phenomenon: the fact that bad 
things can often happen on a national or global level even though virtually no individual or 
microeconomic-level organization wants or intends them to happen. People generally agree 
that high unemployment, persistent high inﬂation, and destruction of the natural environment, 
for example, are bad things, yet they occur nonetheless.
Microeconomics and macroeconomics are terms that are applied rather loosely, covering 
or emphasizing different topics as times and circumstances change. Many issues have both 
macroeconomic and microeconomic aspects. For example, imposition of a sales tax will affect 
microeconomic behavior—people may consume less or shift their patterns of consumption toward 
untaxed items—but it also affects government revenues, which, as we will see, are an important 
element of macroeconomic analysis. No one speaks of “the microeconomy” because there are too 
many subnational economic systems of varied sizes that are studied in the ﬁeld of microeconomics. 
However, the term macroeconomy is used to refer to a national economic system.
People also speak of the global economy, meaning the system of economic rules, norms, 
and interactions by which economic actors and actions in different parts of the world are 
connected to one another. Economic actors (or economic agents) include all individuals, 
groups, and organizations that engage in or inﬂuence economic activity. As the global economy 
has become an increasingly important part of the experience of more and more people, it has 
become more essential to include its study in introductory macroeconomics courses. You can 
expect to ﬁnd global as well as macroeconomic issues extensively covered in this book.

and money in college to studying economics. Why? What do you hope to learn in this 
course that will be helpful for you in reaching your goals?
2. Are you familiar with the following terms? While you will study them in detail in this 
course, see how well you can come up with a deﬁnition for them just from your previous 
knowledge. (It does not matter at this point if you are not familiar with them.)

2. MACROECONOMICS AND THE DYNAMICS OF REAL-WORLD MARKETS
Much of microeconomics, as we have seen, is based on supply and demand analysis, in which 
price adjustments lead to economic equilibrium. If this same logic applied to the economy 
as a whole, there would be little need for a separate theory of macroeconomics. But, as de-
scribed in earlier chapters, few if any markets truly approach perfect competition. Markets 
may be characterized by market power (as discussed in Chapter 18). Buyers and sellers may 
have imperfect information, or be bound by long-term contracts. The role of assumptions 
and expectations can be signiﬁcant. For example, if people were used to paying more for 
the services of lawyers than for the services of teachers, lawyers would be very resistant to 
changes in the relative prices. In general, wages, which are a special kind of price, can be 
affected by a variety of things aside from simple supply and demand. For these and other 
reasons, the mechanism of price adjustment may not work as smoothly as a simple supply-
and-demand model might suggest.

MACROECONOMICS AND THE DYNAMICS OF REAL-WORLD MARKETS 
423
2.1 WHEN PRICE ADJUSTMENTS ARE SLOW
An issue of particular importance to macroeconomics is the question of the speed at which 
real-world price adjustments take place. How long will it take markets to reach equilibrium? 
Minutes? An hour? A day? The theory of supply and demand does not tell us. As discussed in 
Chapter 3, basic market analysis represents a static model, which does not take into account 
the passage of time.
Some markets, such as stock markets, tend to clear quickly. But other markets involve 
signiﬁcant time delays. For example, consider the market for shirts. When you go into a 
clothing store, you see a rack of shirts and, on their tags, a given price. The price probably 
reﬂects a markup by the retailer over what he or she paid to a distributor to get the shirts. The 
distributor in turn probably charged a markup over the price charged by the manufacturer. 
Now, if the shirts were overpriced, they would not sell very well. In terms of market analysis, 
there will be a surplus. If the market adjusted instantaneously, the supplier and demander 
would quickly be able to ﬁne tune the price and quantity to get it just right. The price would 
fall, the surplus of shirts would disappear immediately, and equilibrium would be restored.
In a realistic, complicated case such as this one, however, there is actually a chain of 
markets involved—the manufacturer sells to the distributor, the distributor to the retailer, 
and the retailer to the ﬁnal buyer. A quick adjustment of prices is unlikely. More commonly, 
when retailers mark down the prices on the shirts they have in stock in order to clear them 
out, the drop in the price will not immediately travel back up the supply chain. In the next 
order that the retailers place with their distributors, the retailers might just ask for a smaller 
quantity of shirts, at the price at which the distributor is offering them—especially if the 
retailer were small relative to the distributor and had little power to bargain over prices. Any 
changes in prices or quantities at the manufacturing level would only develop over time, as 
the manufacturers saw the level of their inventories either rise (because the shirts are not 
selling) or fall (because the distributors order more).
Because of the time it takes for all these things to happen, some economists believe that the 
most likely ﬁrst response to a surplus is that manufacturers would cut production—perhaps 
laying off workers—rather than reducing their price. In such a case, the quantity produced 
adjusts to meet the quantity demanded at a given price, rather than the price adjusting to clear 
the market. If such quantity adjustments happened throughout the economy, unemployment 
could rise.
Suppliers may also be reluctant to change the prices that they offer because of menu 
costs—literally, the costs of changing the prices listed on such things as order forms and 
restaurant menus. Other factors that could slow the process of price adjustment include union 
contracts, lengthy production processes, and information problems. 
2.2 WHEN PRICES SWING TOO MUCH: MARKET INSTABILITY
Other markets have adjustment processes in which prices may change rapidly. In electronic 
stock markets, for example, thousands of trades may take place every minute, as buyers and 
sellers ﬁnd each other and quickly negotiate a price. Such a market can probably be thought 
of as in equilibrium, or moving quickly toward one, nearly all the time.
Very rapid adjustments of prices, however, create their own set of problems. They can 
encourage speculation—the buying and selling of assets with the expectation of proﬁting 
from appreciation or depreciation in their values, usually over a relatively short period of 
time. Speculators buy items such as stocks in companies, commodities futures (e.g., contracts 
to buy or sell items such as pork bellies or copper at a speciﬁc price on a future date), foreign 
exchange, real estate, or other investment vehicles, purely in the hopes that they will be able 
to sell them in the future for more than they have paid.
When many people come to believe that the price of something will rise, a speculative 
bubble can occur, in which people buy the asset because so many other people also believe 
quantity adjust-
ments: a response 
by suppliers in which 
they react to unex-
pectedly low sales of 
their good primarily 
by reducing produc-
tion levels rather than 
by reducing the price 
and to unexpectedly 
high sales by increas-
ing production rather 
than raising the price
menu costs: the 
costs to a supplier 
of changing prices 
listed on order forms, 
brochures, menus, and 
the like

and selling assets with 
the expectation of

optimism raises the

tal value 

424 
CHAPTER 19 — INTRODUCTION TO MACROECONOMICS
that its price will continue to rise. In a mass phenomenon often referred to using terms such as 
“herd mentality” or “bandwagon effect,” speculators’ mutually reinforcing optimism causes 
asset values to rise far above any price that could be rationalized in terms of “economic 
fundamentals.” 
In the case of a stock price, for example, the rational economic basis for valuation should 
be the returns that an investor can expect from the ﬁrm of which the stock represents an 
ownership share, while in the case of real estate the value should be determined by the stream 
of likely rents, from the present into the future. Someone who buys a home to live in should 
rationally select one whose costs (mortgage payments plus lost income on the money used for 
down payment) are similar to the rent that would be demanded for a comparable property. 
During a bubble, however, people pay less attention to (or take a biased view of) such 
fundamental factors. Instead, demand for an asset is determined largely by purchasers’ 
perception that they will be able to ﬁnd someone to whom they can sell the asset at a higher 
price. Eventually, however, people begin to ﬁgure out that prices have become unrealistically 
high. Then demand drops, the bubble bursts, and prices fall. This happened during the “dot-
com” bubble of the late 1990s (see Figure 19.1).

Figure 19.1 The Stock Market Bubble of 1999–2000
Enthusiasm about new 
technologies, and Internet 
e-commerce in particular, 
temporarily drove the prices of 
many companies’ stocks very 
high. During the bubble, the 
prices of stocks as determined 
by supply and demand rose 
far above the prices that would 
occur if valuation had been 
based on the companies’ actual 
performances.
It is fairly easy, of course, to recognize a bubble after the fact. However, during the 
spectacular rise in stock prices that took place in the late 1990s, many otherwise rational 
and intelligent people convinced one another—and themselves—that the stock market boom 
reﬂected an immense jump in productivity, not a speculative bubble. This led to a major crash 
in stock prices during 2000–2. 
In spite of the painful lesson of this crash, soon afterward the buildup began for another 
boom and bust, this time originating in the U.S. market for subprime mortages. Such 
mortgages are housing loans given to people whose income or credit history is not good 
enough to qualify them for regular mortgages. 
Many banks aggressively marketed subprime housing loans to prospective homeowners 
from early 2004 to 2007, sometimes using fraudulent techniques and making proﬁts by 
collecting fees on each loan made. Some of the world’s largest banks moved aggressively into 
this area, bundling and repackaging the mortgages in such a way that their riskiness was not 
immediately apparent. Eventually, however, softening of housing prices and rising adjustable 
interest rates caused a steep increase in the number of U.S. homeowners who were defaulting 
on their loans. Securities based on “bundled” subprime mortgages rapidly lost market value as 
questions were ﬁnally raised about the actual worth of the assets on which they were based. 
During the subprime crisis, many people lost their homes, and many of the largest commercial 
banks lost billions of dollars. We will examine this ﬁnancial crisis in Chapter 30. (See Box 
19.1 for a presentation of recent developments in the housing market).

425
Situations of speculative bubbles and volatile (that is, rapidly changing) prices have 
important implications for macroeconomics, even though there is some disagreement among 
economists about the importance of market volatility. Issues such as quantity adjustment and 
market volatility suggest that markets in the real world may not be as well-behaved as those 
in a basic supply and demand model. Things may look different when we consider them 
from the perspective of the economy as a whole. For this reason, explaining national-level 
economic phenomena may require different theoretical tools. 
3. MACROECONOMIC GOALS
We have introduced the idea of an economy working “well” or “badly” and have referred 
to high unemployment, persistent high inﬂation, and destruction of the natural environment 
as bad things that virtually no one wants. “Bad” and “good” are value-laden terms. Do they 
belong in an economics textbook?
As noted in Chapter 1, social scientists often make a distinction between positive questions, 
which concern issues of fact, or “what is,” and normative questions, which have to do with 
goals and values, or “what should be.” For example, “What is the level of poverty in our 
country?” is a positive question, requiring descriptive facts as an answer. “How much effort 
should be given to poverty reduction?” is a normative question, requiring analysis of our values 
and goals. In our study of economics, we often ﬁnd that positive and normative questions 
are inevitably intertwined. For example, consider the deﬁnition of poverty. To construct a 
deﬁnition of poverty, we need to combine facts about income distribution with a normative 
assessment of where to draw the poverty line. We also need to consider whether the deﬁnition 
of poverty should be based solely on income, or whether it should include information about 
people’s assets or opportunities. Life rarely offers us a neat distinction between “ what is” 
and “what ought to be”; more often, we have to deal with a mixture of the two.
Much of macroeconomic analysis is concerned with positive issues. Using both empirical 
evidence and various theories, we describe—using the best available economic research—
how an economy functions at the macro level. Yet, although a few people perhaps enjoy 
assets: property 
owned by an indi-
vidual or company
BOX 19.1 RECOVERY IN THE HOUSING MARKET
The housing market is considered an important 
indicator of the overall economy. In the wake of 
the Great Recession, the average house price in 
the United States fell by about one-third between 
2006 and 2011. Finally, in 2012 the housing mar-
ket began to show signs of recovery. By the end of 
2012 prices were rising at an annual rate of over 
7percent.
The rising prices are a function of both supply 
and demand factors. The number of homes sold 
nationally in 2012 was up by about 30 percent 
compared to the previous year. At the same time, 
the supply of homes for sale reached its lowest level 
since 2005. 
The increase in house prices varied signiﬁcantly 
across regions of the country. The biggest gains were 
found in areas hit the hardest when the housing 
bubble burst in 2007. Prices increased by 23 percent 
in Phoenix, 14 percent in Detroit, 13 percent in Las 
Vegas, and 10 percent in Miami. Of the 20 major 
metropolitan markets, only New York City saw further 
declines in house prices in 2012.
The reasons housing prices have increased include 
an improvement in the overall economy, lower un-
employment rates, very low mortgage rates, and the 
tight supply. Richard Green of the USC Lusk Center 
for Real Estate, said the recovery in housing prices has 
not been even across all the different price segments. 
He said the upper end of the market has done well as 
the wealthier families’ earnings have recovered and 
foreign buyers have come into the market. The lower 
end of the market has recovered due to purchases by 
investors looking for bargains. “It’s the middle market 
that needs help—particularly in the form of higher 
income—if it is going to have a sustained recovery,” 
Green said.

CHAPTER 19 — INTRODUCTION TO MACROECONOMICS
studying economic principles for their own sake, the main reason that anyone would study 
macroeconomics is to try to understand how we—as a society, country, and world—can 
reach our desired goals. Thus we cannot avoid the normative question of what goals the 
macroeconomy should achieve.
Not everyone has the same goals, either at a personal level or as part of their idea of a 
“good” society. However, agreement becomes easier at a more general level. In the context 
of macroeconomics, we can say that three especially important components of well-being 
are good living standards, stability and security, and sustainability.
3.1 LIVING STANDARDS
One macroeconomic goal is to achieve and maintain people’s living standards at a high enough 
level that their lives can be long, healthy, and enjoyable and offer them the opportunity to 
accomplish the things that they believe give their lives meaning.
The most basic living standard issues relate to the quality of people’s diets and housing, 
their access to means of transportation and communication, and the quality of medical attention 
that they receive. Taking a somewhat broader view, we might also include less tangible aspects 
of life, such as the quality of education that people receive and the variety of entertainment 
and other non-work-related activities that they can enjoy.
In addition, the way in which people participate in producing goods and services—as well 
as their consumption of them—has important implications for their health and happiness. So, 
for working-age people, the quality of their working lives is part of their standard of living. And 
for people who cannot do much work because they are too young, old, ill, or handicapped, the 
quality of the hands-on care that they receive is a major component of their living standard.
As we will see in Chapter 21, we could add even more categories to broaden our notion of 
well-being, going beyond economic issues to include things like political freedom and social 
inclusion (see Box 19.2). Traditionally, however, economics has regarded living standards 
growth as the top concern.
How can living standards be maintained or improved? For a long time, “raising living 
standards” was considered nearly synonymous with “achieving economic growth.” 
By economic growth, we mean growth in the level of marketed production or output. 
Traditionally, this has been measured within a country by the growth of its gross domestic 
product (GDP)—a measure that you will hear much more about in later chapters.

MACROECONOMIC GOALS 
427
Global economic growth has been impressive in recent decades. Figure 19.2 plots the 
sum of GDP for all countries from 1960 to 2006. The data from which this chart has been 
plotted are far from perfect—different countries have at different times used a variety 
of methods to calculate their GDP. The deﬁnition of GDP can also be controversial, as 
we explore in Chapters 20 and 21. Nevertheless, we can reasonably conclude from this 
picture that global production of goods and services has increased greatly over the past 
few decades. By this measure, the value of global production in 2010 was about 5.7 times 
the value in 1960.
The growth in economic production has not been equal in all countries, and material 
living standards are still very low in much of the world. This fact is important for people’s 
options and their enjoyment of life. Poverty can mean that people are crowded together in 
unsanitary urban slums or isolated in rural huts, have barely enough to eat, receive little or 
no education, and never see a doctor.
Worldwide, extreme poverty is still a major concern; according to a 2008 World Bank 
study, 1.4 billion people—about a quarter of the population of the developing world—had 
less than $1.25 to spend per day. The production of more and better housing, better roads, 
more grain, more schooling, and more medical care—more goods and services—is necessary 
to raise living standards in such situations.
Because of this underlying concern with living standards, for many decades economists 
focused very strongly on measures of economic growth and the question of how it could be 
maintained and increased. The process of moving from a general situation of poverty and 
deprivation to one of increased production and plenty is what has traditionally been referred 
to as economic development. (This topic is discussed at greater length in Chapter 32.)
Generally, economic development has been thought of as a process of increasing agricultural 
productivity, investing in machinery and technology, and making changes in the organization 
of work (from home-based shops to factories, for example), so that labor productivity 
rises—meaning that people can produce more in each hour that they work.
Of course, while increased production is necessary in such a situation, it is not sufﬁcient 
on its own to improve living standards for the people living in a poor country. For one thing, 
the increase in production may not be enough to keep pace with a growing population. 
Improvement in general living standards can result only if production per person (GDP per 
capita) on average rises.
Some of the increase in global production shown in Figure 19.2 is simply a result of 
more people producing goods and services. When we adjust for the growth in the world’s 
population, we see that production per capita, measured by dividing global production by

global population, has also grown over the past several decades, but not by as much. Figure 
19.3 shows that global production per capita increased by about a factor of 2.5 between 1960 
and 2010, according to this measure.* 
If we were to disaggregate from the global ﬁgures, we would see that increases in economic 
production over these years vary signiﬁcantly across different regions and countries. In East 
Asian countries, GDP per capita increased more than sevenfold. In sub-Saharan Africa, 
however, GDP per capita increased only about 15 percent between 1960 and 2010.
Even if GDP per capita is rising, other factors are still important in ensuring that economic 
growth beneﬁts the world’s and each country’s population as a whole. Recall from Chapter 
1 the three basic economic questions: what, how, and for whom.
s  &IRST IT MATTERS what is produced. An economy may experience “economic growth” by 
increasing its production of military hardware or large public monuments, for example, but 
these kinds of production raise living standards less than growth in production of nutritious 
food, widely available health care, or the quality of basic education.
s  3ECOND IT MATTERS how it is produced. In some poorer countries today, many workers—
including young children—work 14- to 16-hour days in unsafe, badly ventilated mines 
and factories; many suffer severe illnesses and early death. And in both rich and poor 
countries, production is often carried out in ways that deplete or degrade essential natural 
resources.
s  4HIRD IT MATTERS for whom economic growth occurs. How are the increases in production, or 
in incomes arising from production, distributed among the population? Do some regions, or 
some groups of people as deﬁned by income class, race, ethnicity, gender, or other factors, 
receive more of the gains from growth than others? If the beneﬁts of economic growth go 
only to a tiny global or national elite, the bulk of the population may remain very poor.
Even given the qualiﬁcations raised by these questions, it is generally true that in regions 
that are very poor economic growth, as measured by an increase in GDP, is necessary and 
important to increase well-being.
In richer regions, the situation may be different. In a country that is already rich, is economic 
growth still the key to improving living standards and increasing overall well-being? In most 
highly industrialized countries, populations are growing very slowly—in many countries they

are declining or on a trajectory that will soon bring about population decline.* When the 
population is not growing, and when the majority of families already enjoy decent housing, 
safe water, plenty of food, readily available heating and refrigeration, a car or two (or more), 
airline travel, TVs and the like, do we really need more in general?
Some people would say that we do, but others believe that we should instead switch 
our national priorities into making sure that production is designed to increase well-being. 
In countries that already have a high level of production, living standards growth may be 
achievable even in the absence of economic growth, by improving cultural, educational, and 
environmental conditions, raising the quality of work-life and the quantity and quality of 
leisure, and by promoting an equitable allocation of economic rewards.
We will return to these questions—and to the critical issue of the relationships among 
economic growth, job creation, and well-being—in later chapters.
3.2 STABILITY AND SECURITY
While closely linked to goals for living standards, the goal of stability and security brings 
in a dimension that we have not yet discussed. Imagine that you are elderly, and looking 
back over your life you can say that on average, you enjoyed a good standard of living. 
This might arise from two quite different scenarios. In one scenario, you enjoy a fairly 
steady, or gently rising, living standard and are always able to plan conﬁdently for your 
ﬁnancial future.
In the other scenario, you are quite successful at some points in your life but also 
periodically have to face the real possibility of “losing it all.” You do well and buy a very 
nice house, but then you become unemployed and your house is foreclosed on because you 
are not able to make the payments. Then you start to do well again and believe you are on 
a solid path to a pleasant retirement, but steeply rising price levels or a jumpy stock market 
reduces the value of your savings and pension. Even if, after the fact and “over the long 
run,” you can say that on average you have done OK in terms of your living standards, the 
uncertainty and anxiety of living with economic ﬂuctuations in the second scenario would 
take a toll on your overall well-being, relative to the more stable case.
High rates of unemployment are associated with many indicators of individual and social 
stress, such as suicide, domestic violence, and stress-related illnesses among those affected, 
and crime. Unpredictable ﬂuctuations in employment levels and rates of inﬂation, interest 
rates, and foreign exchange rates make it difﬁcult—and, in the worst cases, impossible—for 
individuals and organizations to make productive and economically sensible plans for the 
future. This has been a major concern for many young people who entered the work force 
during or after the major recession of 2007–9.
One common pattern is for ﬂuctuations in the level of production to occur as a cycle in which 
recessions (or “contractions” or “slumps”) and their attendant problem of high unemployment 
alternate with booms (also called “expansions” or “recoveries”), which often bring with them 
the problem of more rapidly rising prices. This is called the business cycle or trade cycle. 
Even if these problems are “short run” and do not last long—people eventually ﬁnd jobs or 
inﬂation slows down—ﬂuctuations cause considerable “ill-being” while they last. So creating 
a stable, secure economic environment is a separate important macroeconomic goal.
In this chapter, we follow the common convention of using GDP as an indicator of 
prosperity. In Chapters 20 and 21, as well as later, we discuss with more precision exactly 
what it is that GDP does—and does not—measure. For now, we will use GDP as an overall 
measure of economic activity. For example, consider Figure 19.4, which shows GDP for the 
United States since 1800. You can see that while the general trend is upward, the curve on the 
graph does not indicate steady growth. The curve is somewhat wavy. During some periods 
GDP fell as the country experienced economic contractions, and during other periods GDP

CHAPTER 19 — INTRODUCTION TO MACROECONOMICS
rose very steeply due to rapid economic expansion. (As in all other graphs of production in this 
chapter, GDP numbers in Figure 19.4 are expressed in “real,” or inﬂation-adjusted, terms.) 
One widely accepted macroeconomic goal is the achievement of sufﬁcient economic 
stability to enable individuals and families to enjoy economic security and to be able to make 
reasonable predictions about their future. In the light of new knowledge about our dependence 
on the natural world, which is undergoing radical alterations due to human economic activity, 
the goal of security now must also include a much longer time horizon, recognizing a serious 
responsibility to future generations. This leads us to our third goal: sustainability.
3.3 SUSTAINABILITY
We want good living standards and stability not only for ourselves right now but also for our-
selves later in our lives and for our children, grandchildren, and other generations to come.
In order to understand how well we are achieving the goal of sustainability, we must 
address the questions:
s  Are economic activities ﬁnancially sustainable into the future? Or is a country incurring a 
high amount of debt that may create a heavy burden on its future inhabitants?
s  Are economic activities socially sustainable into the future? Are disparities between the “haves” 
and the “have-nots” accelerating or diminishing? Are they based on justiﬁable causes or on 
unequal power relations? Are young people receiving the upbringing and education required 
to enable them to contribute to a healthy economy and society? Or is the current structure of 
economic activity setting the stage for future social disruption and political strife?
s  Are economic activities ecologically sustainable into the future? Is the natural environment 
that supports life being treated in a way that will sustain its quality into the future? Or is it 
becoming depleted or degraded?
For many generations, it seemed that technological progress and economic growth were 
magical keys that unlocked the door to unlimited improvements in the standard of living. For 
example, real output per person in the United States in 2010 was about sixteen times what it 
had been in 1840. “Developed” countries in North America, Western Europe, and elsewhere

experienced long-run rising standards of living through industrialization, improvements in 
agricultural technology, and the development of service industries.
Can this process continue indeﬁnitely? Some have argued that sustainability problems can 
be remedied by more GDP growth. For example, the issue of ﬁnancial sustainability includes 
both concerns about the level of government debt (which accumulates whenever governments 
spend more than they take in) and external debt (what all people and organizations in a country 
owe to foreigners). Too much debt is a problem since it means that a large proportion of a 
country’s income in the future may need to be directed toward paying back the debt rather 
than to other, more socially beneﬁcial, uses. Indebtedness, however, is usually considered 
manageable as long as the growth of GDP is at least keeping pace with the level of debt, so 
that debt does not increase as a percent of GDP. 
Regarding social sustainability, some people believe that economic growth is also the way to 
relieve social ills and political strife. They reason that the bigger the pie, the bigger everyone’s 
share can be, and that rising personal incomes will naturally lead to a peaceful and productive 
population. Concerning ecological issues, some economists think that any current negative 
effects of economic growth on the environment can be remedied by additional economic 
growth, since higher incomes give countries the wherewithal to invest in new exploration 
for resources and new pollution-controlling technologies. So, to the most growth-oriented 
economists, “sustainable growth” simply means making sure that the growth rate of GDP 
stays high well into the future.
In contrast to those who believe that economic growth, as traditionally deﬁned, holds the best 
answers to ﬁnancial, social, and environmental problems, by the end of the twentieth century 
some economists had started asking whether these might instead contribute to these problems.
To the extent that a country’s economic prosperity depends on short-sighted or unrealistic 
ﬁnancial planning, prosperity may be unsustainable. For decades, for example, many poorer 
countries were encouraged to borrow heavily from richer countries in order to make progress 
in economic development. However, many of them did not achieve the high rate of economic 
growth that was supposed to result from the borrowing, and a severe “debt crisis” resulted. 
Some very poor countries currently spend more funds simply to pay the interest on their debt 
than they pay for health care for their own population; many also pay more in principal and 
interest than they currently receive in grants and loans.
Some industrialized countries, including the United States, also borrow heavily to fund 
their activities. Many fear that such borrowing may become so excessive that dramatically 
higher taxes will be required in the future in order to pay interest on the debt. Those called 
on to pay these higher taxes—and, hence, suffer lower living standards—would be future 
workers like you. Setting good priorities about how we borrow—and what we borrow for—is 
important for long-run sustainability. This issue will be discussed in detail in Chapter 31. 
Turning to social sustainability, many economists and other observers have come to question 
whether “development” as traditionally deﬁned will solve the problem of global disparities 
in living standards. Some economists suggest that historical factors such as the legacy of 
colonization, and political factors such as rich countries’ protection of their own industries within 
the system of global trade, mean that it is impossible to expect poorer countries to “develop” in 
the same way as countries that industrialized earlier. Analysts have also estimated that giving 
everyone in the world an American lifestyle, including a meat-rich diet and multiple cars per 
family, would require an extra two to four planets to supply resources and absorb waste!
Traditional goals of unlimited material afﬂuence have also been called into question within 
richer countries, and some social scientists have suggested that consumerist and “more-is-
better” values may actually contribute to personal and social discontent and the weakening of 
social norms of trust and reciprocity. Societies that suffer wide divisions between “haves” and 
“have-nots,” or a general sense that everybody is just out for him- or herself, are more likely 
to suffer social and political breakdown—perhaps to the point of violence—than societies 
where people enjoy a greater sense of social cohesion.
Regarding environmental issues, land development and certain agricultural practices 

432 
CHAPTER 19 — INTRODUCTION TO MACROECONOMICS
have caused extinction of some species and notable decreases in genetic diversity in others. 
Contemporary “developed” economies are presently heavily dependent on the consumption 
of fossil fuels; but scientists warn that carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil 
fuels are rapidly exacerbating global climate change.
This raises the question of whether it is sufﬁcient to sustain the ﬁnancial, economic, and 
ecological systems as they are now. Some of the ecological systems that support economic 
activity may already be severely degraded. In such cases, it is not enough to sustain what 
exists now—rather, we need to take on a goal of restorative development, to rebuild systems 
that are no longer supporting well-being in the present and the future.
Some ecologically-oriented economists have suggested that that, instead of placing blind 
faith in technological progress and economic growth, society should adopt a precautionary 
principle. This principle says that we should err on the side of caution, or, as stated by one 
group of experts, “When an activity raises threats of harm to the environment or human health, 
precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully 
established scientiﬁcally.”1 Such attention to environmental sustainability need not preclude also 
giving attention to the goals of living standards improvement and stability, but it does clearly 
call into question the idea that economic growth, in itself, is always the only or the best goal.
Many economists in the twentieth century did not explicitly address the question of 
macroeconomic goals, content in the belief that economic growth would naturally contribute 
to the achievement of any other goals that we might choose. This textbook attempts to balance 
ideas on how to achieve economic growth with questions about what kinds of growth actually 
contribute to well-being and ideas on how present and future well-being can be enhanced 
by restorative development.
Discussion Questions
1. Which of the macroeconomic goals discussed above do you think should have the 
highest priority? Why? Are there other major goals that you think are missing from 
the preceding discussion?
2. No one would argue that the goal of macroeconomics is to make people worse off! Yet 
the above outline of macroeconomic goals suggests that trying too hard to achieve some 
narrowly deﬁned goals may lead to such a result. Why do you think that some economists 
would view economic growth as the major goal, while others view it as potentially in 
conﬂict with other goals such as sustainability or restorative development?
4. MACROECONOMICS IN CONTEXT
Macroeconomics, as a ﬁeld of study, is not a set of principles that is set in stone. Rather, 
the ﬁeld has developed and changed over time as new empirical and theoretical techniques 
have been invented and as historical events have raised new questions for which people have 
urgently sought answers. To give you an idea of how the various principles in this book ﬁt 
into social and historical contexts, we end this chapter with a short overview of the major 
historical developments in macroeconomics. This is not just dusty history; you will see as you 
progress through this textbook that many themes keep arising in slightly new forms, while 
other challenges are unique to our twenty-ﬁrst-century world.
4.1 THE CLASSICAL PERIOD
Centuries ago, most people in the world were involved in agriculture or in home production, 
such as when a family would work together to turn raw wool into cloth. Merchants were a 
minority, and industrial production and large-scale trade were unknown. All this changed 
with the coming of the Industrial Revolution, which began in England in the mid-eighteenth 
century. In many countries, technological progress led to new methods of production, and 
more productive economies both increased and diversiﬁed their output. Necessities like food

and clothing used up a decreasing proportion of the average family income, while a growing 
fraction of the population was able to acquire more comforts and luxuries—better bedding, 
plumbing, housing, and transportation, to name just a few of the improvements in living 
standards. Academic thinkers started to try to understand and explain how these changes 
came about—and classical economics was born.
During this period, macroeconomic study focused on economic growth and distribution. 
The most famous classical economist was the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith (1723–1790), 
whose 1776 book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations set the 
terms of discussion for centuries to come. Smith attributed the growing “wealth of nations” 
to various factors. One was changes in the organization of work, particularly the division of 
labor that assigned workers to specialized, narrowly deﬁned tasks. Whereas in family-based 
production each individual had usually performed a variety of tasks, in industrial production 
a person would repeat one speciﬁc task over and over, presumably becoming more proﬁcient 
with increased practice. Another factor was technological progress, such as the invention of new 
machines powered by burning coal. The third was the accumulation of funds to invest in plants 
and machinery (“capital accumulation”). Classical economists were also particularly concerned 
with theorizing about how the funds generated by selling output would come to be distributed 
between the people who worked in factories and the capitalists who owned the factories.
Classical economists, including Smith, David Ricardo, Thomas Malthus, John Stuart Mill, 
and Karl Marx, were interested in several questions that are still among the most important 
issues for macroeconomics: How is the total wealth generated by a society divided between 
those who own the means of production and those who work for them? Is the existing division 
optimal? What are the forces that determine how society’s wealth will be divided?
Smith is known in particular for promulgating the idea that market systems could coordinate 
the self-interested actions of individuals so that they would ultimately serve the social good. 
While Smith himself supported a number of government interventions and discussed the 
moral basis of social and economic behavior at length in other works, the school of classical 
economics has been popularly identiﬁed with the idea that individual self-interest is a positive 
force and that governments should let markets function without interference—that economies 
should be laissez-faire.* 
The classical economists, with the exception of Malthus and Marx, did not much address 
the problem of economic ﬂuctuations. Most of them thought that a smoothly functioning 
market system should be entirely self-regulating, and full employment should generally 
prevail. This view was summarized in Say’s Law, named after the French classical economist  
Jean-Baptiste Say (1767–1832), which was said to prove that “supply creates its own demand.” 
The example Say gave was of a tradesman, for example, a shoemaker, who sold $100 worth 
of shoes. Say argued that the shoemaker would naturally want to spend the $100 on other 
goods, thereby creating a level of demand that was exactly equal in monetary value to the 
supply of shoes that he had provided. If this example is extended to the whole economy, it 
suggests that the quantities demanded and quantities supplied of goods will exactly balance. 
From this, Say also deduced that the system would always generate the right number of jobs 
for those needing work. Classical economists discussed issues related to a country’s monetary 
system, but tended to assume that monetary issues affected only the price levels, and not the 
level of production, in a country.
4.2 THE GREAT DEPRESSION, KEYNES, AND MONETARISM
In practice, however, economies do not always work so smoothly. Some periods, like 1904–6 
and the 1920s in the United States, were boom years in which everyone seemed eager to invest 
and spend. People with extra funds would buy stocks (ownership shares in companies) or deposit 
their funds in banks (to be lent to others) with great conﬁdence and optimism. But it appeared

CHAPTER 19 — INTRODUCTION TO MACROECONOMICS
that these booms frequently ended in painful recessions. Suddenly, the tide would turn, and 
everyone would want to sell—not buy—and stock prices would plummet. A lack of conﬁdence 
in banks would lead to “bank runs” or “banking panics,” such as occurred in 1907 and 1930–33 
in the United States, when many people tried to withdraw their deposits all at once. With ﬁnan-
cial markets in tatters, businesses and individuals would be unable or unwilling to maintain or 
expand their activities. Because people were cutting back on spending, produced goods would 
go unsold. Industries would cut back on production. People would become unemployed.
A great many people in the United States (and much of the rest of the industrialized 
world) suffered considerable hardship during the Great Depression that followed the 1929 
stock market crash. Production dropped by about 30 percent between 1929 and 1933. At its 
worst, the unemployment rate during the Great Depression topped 25 percent—one in four 
workers in the United States could not ﬁnd a job. High unemployment persisted throughout 
the 1930s, and classical economic theory did not seem to be of much help in either explaining 
or correcting the situation.
The publication of the British economist John Maynard Keynes’s The General Theory 
of Employment, Interest, and Money in 1936 was a watershed event. In this book, Keynes 
(pronounced “canes”) argued that Say’s Law was wrong. It is possible for an economy to have 
a level of demand for goods that is insufﬁcient to meet the supply from production, he said. 
In such a case, producers, unable to sell their goods, will cut back on production, laying off 
workers and thus creating economic slumps. The key to getting out of such a slump, Keynes 
argued, is to increase aggregate demand—the total demand for goods and services in the 
national economy as a whole.
Keynes suggested a number of ways to achieve this. People could be encouraged to 
consume more, the government could buy more goods and services, or businesses could be 
encouraged to spend more. Some economists thought that the best way to encourage business 
spending was to keep interest rates low, so that businesses could borrow easily to invest in 
their enterprises. But, while Keynes believed that increasing investment spending would 
be the key to getting out of a depression, he thought that low interest rates alone would be 
insufﬁcient to tempt discouraged and uncertain business leaders to start investing again. He 
wrote in The General Theory that the solution to business cycles lay in having the government 
take more direct control of the level of national investment. In his view, capitalist economies 
were inherently unstable, and only a more socially oriented direction of investment could cure 
this instability. This policy, however, was not generally adopted, and the Great Depression 
continued for the remainder of the 1930s.
It was the high government spending associated with national mobilization for World 
War II that ﬁnally brought the Great Depression to an end. Perhaps this is one reason that 
the followers of what came to be known as Keynesian economics did not follow Keynes 
on all points. While they retained his emphasis on deﬁciencies in aggregate demand, they 
tended to emphasize the use of ﬁscal policy to keep employment rates up. Fiscal policy is 
the manipulation of levels of government spending and taxation to raise or lower the level 
of aggregate demand.
Other economists in the years after the conclusion of World War II—most notably University 
of Chicago economist Milton Friedman—took a different tack. While the Keynesians argued 
that active government ﬁscal policies were the way to get out of a recession, the monetarists 
argued that bad government monetary policies were how economies tend to get into bad 
situations in the ﬁrst place. In this view, it was primarily the U.S. government’s poor use of its 
monetary policy tools, such as banking regulations and the issuance of currency (most often 
understood as “printing money”), that led to the Great Depression. They blamed government 
policies that encouraged overly “loose” money (i.e., easy credit, low interest rates, and high 
levels of money supply) for the overspending of the late 1920s. Then, they claimed, “tight” 
money policies (tight credit, higher-than-optimal interest rates, and low money supply) during 
the early 1930s turned what could have been a more minor slump into a major depression. They

argued that governments should focus on keeping the money supply steady and not try to take 
an active role in directing the economy, even when unemployment is high. Like the classical 
economists, they believed that the economy would best be left to adjust on its own.
The Keynesian approach to monetary policy, in contrast, favors an active use of monetary 
policy together with ﬁscal policy to try to maintain full employment. This approach strongly 
inﬂuenced macroeconomic policy-making in the United States and many other countries after 
the Second World War. The idea became popular that the government might even be able 
to “ﬁne tune” the economy, counteracting any tendencies to slump with expansionary (high 
spending or loose money) policies, and any excessive expansion with contractionary (low 
spending or tight money) policies, thereby largely eliminating business cycles. A related idea 
was that the government could choose to “trade off” unemployment and inﬂation—letting the 
economy suffer a little more inﬂation to get the unemployment rate down, or vice versa.
4.3 SYNTHESIZING CLASSICAL AND KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS
In the early 1970s, this rosy picture was shattered, however, as many industrialized countries 
began to experience rising unemployment combined with increased inﬂation. To explain this, 
many macroeconomists attempted to merge elements of both classical and Keynesian eco-
nomics, making a distinction between the long run and the short run as follows:
s  Classical theories assert, ﬁrst, that economies should naturally settle at full-employment 
levels of output and, second, that the primary outcome of changes in the money supply are 
changes in the price level or rate of inﬂation. In an idealized smoothly functioning market 
system—as we see in detail in a later chapter—any unemployment (i.e., surplus labor) 
should be corrected by a drop in the (equilibrium) wage. In the emerging synthesis, full 
employment and purely inﬂationary effects came to be thought of as long-run outcomes, 
which occur only after all markets have had sufﬁcient time to adjust.
s  Keynesian economists after World War II had come to accept the idea that their theories 
should be explainable in terms of market models, but explained unemployment as being 
due to the fact that markets for labor do not adjust as quickly as classical theory implies. 
Some Keynesian economists argued that wages are “sticky” in real-world markets and will 
not fall fast enough during a slump for full employment to be quickly restored. Fiscal and 
monetary policies were thought, in this emerging synthesis, to be effective mechanisms for 
coping with this short-run phenomenon.
Thus the dominant macroeconomic theory that emerged argued that in the short run—a 
period of some months or years—we are in a primarily Keynesian world where ﬁscal and 
monetary policies can be effective. In the long run, however—after such a period of time 
that even “sticky” markets are able to adjust—we are in a classical world, where market 
adjustments ensure full employment and money only affects prices.
Economists thus explained the inﬂation that occurred in the ﬁrst few years of the 1970s (in 
spite of the simultaneous presence of unemployment) as the long-run outcome of expansionary 
monetary policies of the previous years. It appeared that short-run active (Keynesian) 
government policies could have unintended negative long-term (classical) consequences.
While many economists came to agree on this general theoretical picture, debates have 
continued, now centered on the value of active government policies. Macroeconomists at 
the classical end of the spectrum tend to emphasize market efﬁciency and a small role for 
government. They are suspicious about the use of monetary policy because of the possible 
negative effects of inﬂation. They also reject active ﬁscal policy, arguing that increases in 
government spending or taxation primarily lead to a larger government. Large governments, 
they believe, discourage private sector activities and economic growth.
Economists on the Keynesian end of the spectrum, meanwhile, tend to emphasize the 
way in which unemployment can cause severe human suffering and may persist for a long 

436 
CHAPTER 19 — INTRODUCTION TO MACROECONOMICS
time. They argue for a more active role for government. Waiting for markets to adjust on 
their own, they believe, may mean waiting too long. And, as Keynes himself put it, “In the 
long run, we are all dead.”
This argument between classical and Keynesian economists is very much alive today. 
New developments in recent years—in particular the severe recession of 2007–9 and its 
aftermath—have revived many of these long-running debates about the appropriate role of 
government ﬁscal and monetary policy.
4.4 MACROECONOMICS FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
While issues of economic growth and the business cycle preoccupied macroeconomic think-
ing for generations, once again, in the twenty-ﬁrst century, new developments are demanding 
new ways of looking at the economic world.
Most recently, great suffering, including loss of homes and income, resulted from the 
2007–8 ﬁnancial crisis and the ensuing recession and slow recovery. Concerns have arisen 
over levels of national debt, and there has been intense debate about appropriate policy 
responses. These issues are discussed in Part VIII of this book.
In a broader perspective, the persistence of substantial global poverty, as mentioned in 
the earlier discussion of social sustainability, has called into question the appropriateness 
of traditional ideas about economic development. Questions of what, how, and for whom—
rather than just “how much”—are becoming ever more important in evaluating the effects 
of economic activity on human well-being. Increasingly unequal distributions of resources 
and disparities in power, on local, national, and global scales, are rising to the fore as critical 
issues for human well-being. Inequality and resource constraints have cascading effects in 
political instability as well as armed conﬂicts.
The environmental impact of fossil fuel–based economic growth has become a major focus 
of economic, social, and political concern, along with other environmental issues. Most previous 
economic theories assumed that resources and the capacity of the environment to absorb 
the by-products of economic growth were essentially unlimited—or at least that continued 
developments in technology would keep problems of depletion and pollution at bay. This has 
been increasingly questioned as the scale of human economic activity grows larger.
The graphs of economic growth, seen earlier in this chapter, illustrate an impressive human 
ability to increase production. The growth in global atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2, the 
principal gas associated with climate change) illustrated in Figure 19.5 is equally impressive 
but more sobering, as it shows the human ability to affect our environment signiﬁcantly—
sometimes in dangerous ways. CO2 is released in fossil fuel–burning industrial production, 
transportation, and heating, and the more such production takes place, the more is released. 
Deforestation also contributes to increases in atmospheric CO2.

As fossil-fuel based industrialization and 
deforestation have increased, so has the 
atmospheric concentration of the gases 
involved in global warming.

QUESTONS AND EXERCISES 
437
Unless emissions of greenhouse gases are reduced dramatically, we can expect to 
see a number of dangerous results from climate change, including increasingly severe 
disturbances to agriculture, disruptions in water supply, an expansion of the reach of 
tropical diseases, and threats from increasingly severe weather including hurricanes, ﬂoods, 
and droughts. Reconciling ecological sustainability and restoration with full employment 
and growth in living standards is rising in prominence as a macroeconomic issue. Related 
environmental issues concerning the depletion or degradation of a wide variety of critical 
natural resources will require new thinking about the relationship between production and 
living standards.
This is an exciting moment in the study of macroeconomics, when so much is at stake—and 
when there is both need and opportunity for creative new ideas. If you had embarked on this 
course 20 years ago, you would likely have read a textbook that implied that “everything we 
need to know about the macroeconomy is here—just learn it.” Given recent developments, 
it is more appropriate to invite you to contemplate and discuss how the economy works, how 
it doesn’t, and how it should.
Discussion Questions
1. Which major historical events inﬂuenced the development of macroeconomics as a ﬁeld 
of study? In addition to the problems listed in the text, do you think there are other current 
problems that macroeconomics should be addressing?
2. The fact that economists do not always agree, and that there are alternative “schools” of 
macroeconomic thought, can sometimes seem confusing. It may help to think about, or 
discuss in a group, how economics compares to other subjects that you or your classmates 
have studied. What kinds of changes in the ﬁelds of physics or biology have occurred in 
the past hundred years? Are there major debates, disagreements, and unsettled issues in 
other ﬁelds such as psychology, sociology, or political science? 
REVIEW QUESTIONS
 1. How does macroeconomics differ from 
microeconomics?
 2. Describe how and why sellers of a good might ad-
just the quantity of what they produce, rather than 
the price.
 3. What are some of the problems that can be created 
by large price swings?
 4. What is meant by “living standards growth”? Is this 
the same as “economic growth”?
 5. What is economic development? What factors are 
important in ensuring that economic growth beneﬁts 
a country’s population as a whole?
 6. Why are macroeconomic ﬂuctuations a cause for 
concern?
 7. What global developments have caused ﬁnancial, 
social, and ecological sustainability or restoration to 
become increasingly prominent as macroeconomic 
concerns?
 8. What is the “precautionary principle”?
 9. What historical developments and concerns 
motivated—and what beliefs characterized—the 
classical economists? The school of Keynesian 
economics? The work of the monetarists? The syn-
thesis of Keynesian and classical thought?
 10. Name two or more global issues that will likely 
shape the development of macroeconomics in the 
twenty-ﬁrst century.

20 Macroeconomic Measurement:  
The Current Approach
In order to make good macroeconomic policy choices, we need to have reliable information on 
how the economy is performing. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the metric that is most often 
cited to assess overall economic performance.* For example, a common deﬁnition of a recession is 
when an economy’s GDP decreases for two consecutive quarters. Of course, other variables, such 
as unemployment, inﬂation, and interest rates, are of great interest to economists and policymakers, 
but they tend to rely most heavily on GDP data to guide their policy recommendations.
In this chapter, we take a detailed look at GDP and related national economic data. But 
before we begin, a note of caution is in order. Although it is true that GDP growth improves 
average material living standards, which in turn contributes to well-being, it is not true that 
GDP growth always increases well-being. For example, if GDP grows simply because people 
are working longer hours, we would need to evaluate the increase in GDP against the loss in 
leisure time to determine whether well-being has actually increased. In Chapter 21, we look 
at the limitations of, and alternatives to, GDP as a measure of well-being, in order to place 
our discussion of GDP “in context” with our broader discussion of well-being.
1. AN OVERVIEW OF NATIONAL ACCOUNTING
The idea of creating a system of national accounting to guide U.S. economic policies ﬁrst 
took hold during the Great Depression in the 1930s. Presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin 
Roosevelt knew that national production was down, but other than a few numbers represent-
ing the volumes of railroad shipments and steel production, they had no information on how 
much it was down. Likewise, they had little way of knowing whether the policies that they 
were trying to implement were actually helping the economy to rebound.
The Department of Commerce commissioned economist Simon Kuznets to begin to develop 
national accounts. The ﬁrst set of accounts was presented to Congress in 1937. Interest in 
keeping national accounts increased in the 1940s because of the need for national economic 
mobilization during World War II. Now, every functioning country compiles national accounts 
using standardized approaches.
National accounting involves more than just measuring GDP. Thus we refer to a system of 
National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) that collects data on production, income, 
spending, prices, and employment. In the United States, the national accounts are maintained 
by a federal agency, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).
*A closely related measure is gross national product (GNP). The difference between GNP and GDP concerns whether 
foreign earnings are included. GNP includes the earnings of a country’s citizens and corporations regardless of where they 
are located in the world. GDP includes all earnings within a country’s borders, even the earnings of foreign citizens and 
corporations. GDP is the more common measure used when comparing international statistics.

CHAPTER 20 — MACROECONOMIC MEASUREMENT: THE CURRENT APPROACH
1.1 CONVENTIONS ABOUT NATIONAL ACCOUNTING SECTORS
Before we focus on how GDP is measured, we ﬁrst need to discuss some of the “conventions,” 
or assumptions, used in the NIPA. National accounting conventions are simply habits or 
agreements, adopted by agencies in order to try to make the accounts as standardized and 
comparable across different countries and periods as possible. Some of these conventions 
concern how data are categorized. For example, there are conventions concerning what is 
classiﬁed as investment versus consumption or a durable versus a nondurable good. Other 
conventions address how estimates are made for some components of the NIPA for which 
readily available data are lacking. Of course, there are alternatives to the common conventions, 
but the emphasis is on standardization rather than always choosing the “best” approach.
One of the common national accounting conventions concerns how the entire economy 
is broken down into four national accounting sectors.* These sectors, as deﬁned by the 
BEA, are:
1. Households and institutions sector: This includes both households and nonproﬁt insti-
tutions that serve households, such as nonproﬁt hospitals, universities, museums, trade 
unions, and charities. The BEA also refers to the households and institutions sector as the 
“personal” sector. (Note how this overlaps with, but is not identical to, the “core sphere” 
described in Chapter 2.)
2. Business sector: The BEA business sector is somewhat broader than just for-proﬁt busi-
nesses. Certain business-serving nonproﬁt organizations, such as trade associations and 
chambers of commerce, are included in this category. In addition, government agencies 
that produce goods and services for sale—such as the U.S. Postal Service, municipal gas 
and electric companies, and airports—are also classiﬁed as being in the business sector.
3. Government sector: The government sector includes all federal, state, and local govern-
ment entities, except for the “business-like” government enterprises mentioned above.
4. Foreign sector: The entities in the ﬁrst three sectors include, for the national accounts, 
only those located within the physical borders of the United States. The foreign sector (or 
“rest of the world”) includes all entities—household, nonproﬁt, business, or government—
located outside the borders of the United States. An individual in another country who 
buys imported U.S. products, for example, or a company located abroad that sells goods 
or services to the United States, ﬁgures into U.S. accounts as part of the foreign sector.
1.2 CONVENTIONS ABOUT CAPITAL STOCKS
Although natural, manufactured, human, and social capital are all crucial resources for 
economic activity, it is largely only manufactured capital that is currently included in the 
accounting of national nonﬁnancial assets. This might be because the national accounts were 
originally devised at a time when the rise of manufacturing made the accumulation of machin-
ery and factory buildings appear to be the main road to prosperity. In the twenty-ﬁrst century, 
the rise in importance of knowledge, along with concerns for ecological issues, suggests that 
additional accounts should be added—a topic we take up in Chapter 21.
The ﬁrst category of manufactured capital in the national accounts is ﬁxed assets. Fixed 
assets include equipment owned by businesses and governments, structures such as factories 
and ofﬁce buildings, and residences (i.e., houses and apartment buildings). In 1999, in partial 
recognition of the increasingly important role of knowledge and technology in production, 
computer software was added as an additional type of ﬁxed asset.
A second—and much smaller—component of the manufactured capital stock is inventories. 
Inventories are stocks of raw materials, such as crude oil awaiting reﬁning, or manufactured 
national account-
ing conventions: 
habits or agreements, 
adopted by govern-
ment agencies in or-
der to make national 
accounts as standard-
ized and comparable 
across different coun-
tries and periods as 
possible
*We call them “national accounting sectors” to differentiate them from the classiﬁcation of the economy into sectors 
discussed in Chapter 22, where we refer to “production” sectors.
ﬁxed assets: 
equipment owned 
by businesses and 
governments; struc-
tures; residences; and 
software
inventories: stocks 
of raw materials or 
manufactured goods 
being stored until 
they can be used or 
sold

goods, such as the shoe inventory of a retail shoe store, that are held until they can be used 
or sold. The BEA only counts inventories held by the business sector.
Equipment used by governments and businesses is included in “ﬁxed assets.” But what 
about equipment owned by households, such as cars and stoves, that are used in household 
production of goods and services? The BEA calls all goods bought by households that are 
expected to last longer than three years consumer durable goods. In 2003, the BEA began 
including consumer durables in its accounts of assets.
The BEA estimates of the dollar value of the country’s stock of manufactured assets at the 
end of 2011 are given in Table 20.1.
1.3 CONVENTIONS ABOUT INVESTMENT
The way that the national accounts measure investment spending may seem confusing if one 
does not keep in mind some basic facts. First, recall from Chapter 3 that economists generally 
use the term “investment” to mean additions to stocks of nonﬁnancial assets. This contrasts 
with the common use of the term “investment” to refer to ﬁnancial investment, such as the 
purchase of stocks and bonds. Second, it is important to remember that investment represents 
a ﬂow. A machine added to a factory in 2013, for example, is considered part of the national 
stock of nonresidential assets for every year from the time it is installed until the time it is 
junked. However, the machine was an addition to assets only in 2013, and hence its value 
would be counted as an investment only in that one year. Lastly, as was also discussed in 
Chapter 3, gross investment includes all measured ﬂows into the capital stock over a period 
while net investment adjusts this measure for the fact that some portion of the capital stock 
wears out, becomes obsolete, or is destroyed—that is, depreciates—over the period.
For example, suppose that an ofﬁce complex built in 1980 is torn down this year and 
replaced by a new, larger ofﬁce complex. Measured gross investment for this year would 
include the full value of the new ofﬁce complex. Net investment for this year would 
be calculated as the value of the new ofﬁce complex minus the value of the depreciated 
building that was torn down. If the new building has 100,000 square feet of space, while 
the old one had 60,000 square feet, for example, the economy has a net gain of only 
40,000 square feet of ofﬁce space. Net investment, which measures only the value of the 
new space and any improvements in quality, gives a better idea of the actual addition to 
productive capacity.
Gross investment in ﬁxed assets is always zero or positive. However, if, over a period 
of time, the capital stock depreciates faster than it is being replaced, net investment can be 
negative. This can sometimes happen to manufactured capital stocks when a country is hit 
by major disasters such as wars or ﬂoods, or during a period when new investment is very 
low, meaning that gross investment is less than depreciation.
Ideally, productive investments by all sectors would be recognized in the national accounts. 
But it was not until 1996 that government investment in ﬁxed assets was recognized, and 
depreciation: a de-
crease in the quantity 
or quality of a stock 
of capital
gross investment: 
all ﬂows into the 
capital stock over a 
period of time
net investment:

nus an adjustment for

CHAPTER 20 — MACROECONOMIC MEASUREMENT: THE CURRENT APPROACH
household investment in consumer durables is still, by convention, not considered part of 
investment in the national accounts.
Discussion Questions
1. The BEA deﬁnitions of sectors use some conventions that are not obvious. To which sector 
might the BEA assign each of the following entities? Why?
a. A local city government–owned golf course that charges fees similar to those at local 
private courses
b. A large nonproﬁt hospital
c. A U.S.-owned movie company whose ofﬁces and studio are in Japan
d. A nonproﬁt trade association, such as the Chocolate Manufacturers Association
2. Under the BEA deﬁnitions, would spending on education be counted as investment? Would 
buying shares in a company be considered investment? Why?
2. DEFINING GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT
As we mentioned earlier, the most referenced single number that comes out of the national 
accounts is GDP. A wide range of policymakers and media outlets await the announcement 
of newly published ﬁgures on GDP with great anticipation (see Box 20.1). The ﬁgures on 
the growth rate of GDP are often taken to signal the success or failure of macroeconomic 
policy-making.
According to the BEA, GDP is supposed to measure the total market value of ﬁnal goods and 
services newly produced within a country’s borders over a period of time (usually one year).
This deﬁnition contains several key phrases. Let us consider each of them.
“Market value”: For most components of GDP, we can simply refer to the market prices 
of goods and services to determine their contribution to GDP. However, in some cases (as 
we discuss later in the chapter), we do not have market prices for certain goods and services 
and thus need to estimate their value using another approach.
“Final goods and services”: A ﬁnal good is one that is ready for use. That is, no further 
productive activity needs to occur before the good can be consumed (if it is a good that is 
used up as it is put to use) or put to work producing other goods and services (e.g., if it is a 
piece of equipment). The reason for limiting measurement to ﬁnal goods and services is to 
avoid double counting. For example, suppose that over the course of a year, paper is produced 
by one company and sold to another company that uses it to make books. The books are 
then sold to their ﬁnal buyers. Books in this case are the ﬁnal goods, while the paper used in 
them is an intermediate good. By limiting the accounting to ﬁnal goods, production is only 
counted once—the paper is only counted as part of the books.
“Over a period of time”: Since GDP measures a ﬂow, it of course must be measured 
over a time period. Macroeconomists usually work with GDP measured on a yearly basis. 
Estimates of GDP are released more often than once a year—generally on a quarterly basis 
(the ﬁrst quarter covering January through March, the second April through June, and so on). 
However, even when only a part of the year is being covered, GDP and its growth rates are 
usually expressed in annual terms.
“Newly produced”: Only new goods and services are counted. For example, if you buy a 
book published in 2010 at a used bookshop, the value of the book itself is not included in this 
year’s GDP. Only the retail services provided by the used bookshop are “newly produced,” 
and are part of this year’s GDP.
“Within a country’s borders”: This means that the goods and services are produced within 
the physical borders of the country. If a U.S. citizen goes abroad to work, for example, what 
he or she produces while away is not part of U.S. GDP. On the other hand, the work of a 
Japanese citizen at a Japanese-owned factory is part of U.S. GDP if that factory is located 
inside the borders of the United States.
gross domestic 
product (GDP) 
(BEA deﬁnition): a 
measure of the total 
market value of ﬁnal 
goods and services 
newly produced with-
in a country’s borders 
over a period of time 
(usually one year)
ﬁnal good: a good 
that is ready for use, 
needing no further 
processing
intermediate 
good: a good that 
will undergo further 
processing

 
MEASURING GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT 
443
3. MEASURING GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT
The BEA publishes tables showing the components of GDP, as well as many other tables 
dealing with assets, employment, prices, and other topics in the NIPA. (These are easily ac-
cessed at www.bea.gov.) To understand these tabulations, however, you need to understand 
how aggregate production, spending, and income are related in an economic system.
Imagine a simple economy with no foreign sector, no depreciation, no inventories, and 
in which all the proﬁts that companies earn end up in the bank accounts of households. 
In this case, three quite different measures of counting GDP would in theory all add up to 
the same number:
Value of Production = Value of Spending = Value of Income
Using a production approach, which might seem to be the most natural and direct method, 
we could sum up the dollar value of all ﬁnal goods and services produced in each national 
accounting sector—by the household and institutions sector, the business sector, and the 
government sector.
Using the spending approach, we could look at who buys the ﬁnal goods and services 
that have been produced. Since we assumed that no goods are carried as inventory in this 
very simple economy, everything produced must be bought. Totaling the dollar value 
of spending on all various kinds of goods and services by all sectors in this imaginary 
simple economy will indicate a second way of arriving at the ﬁgure for a country’s 
aggregate production.
Lastly, because in this simple economy everyone who is involved in production also 
receives monetary payment for their contribution to it, we could, alternatively, take an income 
approach. In this approach, we total the compensation received by everyone involved in 
production, including workers, investors, creditors, and owners of land or equipment rented 
for productive use.
In this very simple economy if, say, $10 billion worth of goods and services is produced, 
then the amount spent on goods and services must also be $10 billion and the amount of 
payment received as income must also be $10 billion. Sometimes in dealing with national 
BOX 20.1 U.S. ECONOMY CONTRACTS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION
The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reported in 
January 2013 that the U.S. economy contracted 
for the ﬁrst time since the Great Recession ofﬁcially 
ended in 2009. Real gross domestic product (GDP) 
for the last quarter of 2012 shrank at an annual rate 
of 0.1 percent. The decline in GDP was attributed to 
decreases in private inventory investment, government 
spending, and exports. The decline in federal defense 
spending was particularly large, at 22 percent. The BEA 
also noted that personal consumption expenditures 
increased by 2.2 percent, with a signiﬁcant increase 
in durable goods expenditures of 13.9 percent.
Did the decline in GDP suggest the United States in 
early 2013 was on the brink of another recession? Most 
economists rejected this idea. The negative inﬂuences 
on GDP were viewed as temporary factors, rather than 
indicative of a trend. And indeed, GDP growth resumed, 
though at only moderate rates, later in 2013.
It’s “the best-looking contraction in U.S. GDP you’ll 
ever see,” Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for 
Capital Economics said in a research note. “The drag 
from defense spending and inventories is a one-off. 
The rest of the report is all encouraging.”
Also, the decline in private inventories was viewed 
as a sign that businesses would need to increase 
purchases to restore depleted inventories. In the 
wake of this report, most economists projected that 
the economic recovery in the United States would 
continue, with projections for annual GDP growth of 
2.0 percent to 2.5 percent GDP in 2013.

CHAPTER 20 — MACROECONOMIC MEASUREMENT: THE CURRENT APPROACH
accounts economists hence use the terms “production,” “income,” and “expenditure” 
interchangeably.
While there is a rough equivalence in theory among the product, spending, and income 
approaches to calculating GDP, making estimates for an actual economy requires a number 
of conventions and adjustments. We now consider each approach in more detail.
3.1 THE PRODUCT APPROACH
The BEA measures the “value” of ﬁnal goods and services primarily by their dollar market 
value. For example, if the business sector produces 1,000 automobiles of a certain type this 
year, which are which are then sold to ﬁnal users for $20,000 each, this production contributes 
$20 million to GDP. 
Rather than looking at the ﬁnal sale, however, it is sometimes useful for accounting and 
analytical purposes to follow an alternative approach. This is to think about how much each 
industry contributes to the value of the ﬁnal good or service. In the value-added approach 
to GDP accounting, you start with the raw materials—say, iron ore—used in producing a 
good or service—say, an automobile—and then see how much market value is added at each 
stage in the production process.
For example, suppose a steel manufacturer buys $500 worth of iron ore from a mining 
company and uses this ore to produce steel automobile frames, which it then sells to Ford 
Motor Company for $1,800 each. The difference between the price of the iron ore and the 
cost of any other materials needed to convert iron ore into automobile frames, including 
energy and equipment costs, represents value added. So if the steel manufacturer requires 
another $200 in additional materials and other costs to produce an automobile frame, then the 
difference between their total costs ($700) and the selling price ($1,800) is the value added 
at this stage in production ($1,100). This $1,100 is the amount that is left over after paying 
for inputs, and it becomes either wages to steel workers or proﬁts to the steel manufacturing 
company. Similarly, we can determine the value added by Ford Motor Company as the 
difference between all its input costs (except labor) and the ﬁnal selling price of the car. If 
the car sells for $20,000, Ford’s value added can be calculated by subtracting the price of the 
steel, rubber, glass, energy, and all other purchased inputs. Supposing that these added up to 
$12,000, Ford’s value added would be $8,000.
The BEA maintains an extensive set of tables, called Input-Output Accounts, to keep track 
of the contributions to GDP by various industries. These tables show that outputs of each 
industrial sector (e.g., agriculture, manufacturing, or services) can become inputs (intermediate 
goods) to production in other sectors.
If we add up the value-added contribution of each step in the production process, we should 
end up with the ﬁnal market price of the good. The fact that these numbers should be the same 
serves as a “check” on the validity of data that the BEA collects from different sources.
While ﬁnding the market value of goods may seem fairly straightforward for manufacturing 
industries, in practice the idea of “market value” is often much harder to determine. In many 
cases the BEA uses imputation to estimate the value of components of GDP. An imputation 
is a sort of educated guess, usually based on the value of similar outputs or on the value of 
inputs used in production.
For example, the housing stock of a country produces a ﬂow of services—the services 
of shelter. For housing units that are rented, the rent paid is the market value of the housing 
services. But how can we ﬁnd out the value of the services generated by houses occupied by 
their owners? For these, the BEA must impute a value. They use data from the rental housing 
market to impute what owner-occupiers might be said to be “paying in rent” to themselves.
In cases where no similar marketed product exists, the BEA often falls back on using a 
value-added approach, looking exclusively at the value of inputs. We know, for example, 
that governments purchase many intermediate goods, and then produce goods and services. 
value-added: the 
value of what a pro-
ducer sells, less the 
value of the interme-
diate inputs it uses, 
except labor. This is 
equal to the wages 
paid out by the pro-
ducer plus its proﬁts
imputation: a pro-
cedure in which val-
ues are assigned for a 
category of products, 
usually using values of 
related products or 
inputs

 
MEASURING GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT 
445
But rarely are government outputs—new highways, the services of parks, the services of 
public education, national defense, and so on—actually sold on markets. How, then, can the 
production of the government be valued?
In the actual GDP accounts, the value of government production is imputed by adding up the 
amount that governments pay their workers, the amount that they pay for intermediate goods 
and services, and an allowance for depreciation of ﬁxed assets. Likewise, the production of 
nonproﬁt institutions is measured in large part by looking at their inputs. For example, data 
on payroll expenses form an important part of the information used in estimating the value 
of the services produced by nonproﬁt agencies.
Imputations are also used when data are difﬁcult or impossible to obtain. Although it might 
be tempting to imagine the BEA as an all-knowing agency that can directly observe all market 
transactions, gathering data is a laborious (and often expensive) process. The BEA relies on a 
variety of censuses and surveys to obtain information, as well as on data such as government 
budgets and tax records. Market transactions that people take pains not to have observed 
by the government—such as illegal drug deals or work performed “off the books” to avoid 
taxes—hence are usually not represented in the national statistics. The BEA updates all its 
estimates periodically, as it receives better data or improves its statistical techniques—hence 
you may see many slightly varying numbers quoted for, say “U.S. GDP, 2013” depending 
on when the data were published.
In one signiﬁcant case, however, the designers of the national accounts decided not even 
to attempt to impute a value for production: the production of goods and services within 
households for their own use. The ofﬁcial measure of production by households includes the 
value of services produced by the house itself (i.e., the rent or imputed rent) and production 
within the households to the extent that work is paid (i.e., done by hired housekeepers, 
babysitters, or private gardeners). But activities such as unpaid child care, cooking, or the 
cleaning or landscaping of a home done without pay by household members—traditionally, 
mostly by women—are not counted in GDP. This creates an anomaly in the accounts. For 
many years, textbooks noted that “if a man marries his housekeeper, GDP falls.” That is, 
marriage would convert the woman’s housekeeping work from being paid and counted to 
being unpaid and uncounted.
We can summarize the product approach to measuring GDP using the equation:
GDP = Business production + Household and institutions production  
+ Government production
This sort of equation is called an identity or an accounting identity. It holds simply because 
of the way in which the various terms have been deﬁned. Once we agree on the deﬁnitions 
of terms, then there remains nothing controversial about an identity. (When we begin to deal 
with macroeconomic modeling in Chapter 24 we introduce another kind of equation, called 
a behavioral equation. A behavioral equation represents an economist’s supposition about 
how an economic actor behaves—and because it may or may not hold well in practice, it 
can be more controversial.)
Note that the foreign sector does not contribute to the production of GDP in the above 
equation. Can you explain why? (Hint: Look back at the deﬁnition of GDP.)
Table 20.2 presents the BEA estimate of GDP in 2012 using the product approach, divided 
into national accounting sectors and subsectors. Not surprisingly, given the conventions 
and accounting procedures, the BEA attributes a very large share of productive activity to 
the business sector. In 2012, the business sector was estimated to have produced goods and 
services worth about $12 trillion, or about 76 percent of the total GDP of $15.68 trillion. The 
household and institutions sector and the government sector were each estimated to have 
contributed about 12 percent. (In Table 20.2, as in later tables, the totals for sectors are often 
divided into values for subsectors.)

ing identity): an

CHAPTER 20 — MACROECONOMIC MEASUREMENT: THE CURRENT APPROACH
3.2 THE SPENDING APPROACH
The spending approach adds up the value of newly produced goods and services bought by 
the household and institution, business, foreign, and government sectors. The estimated values 
for these expenditures for 2012 are listed in Table 20.3.
Purchases of goods and services by households and nonprofit institutions serving 
households are called “personal consumption expenditures” by the BEA. By convention, 
they are all considered “ﬁnal” goods and services (even though, as discussed earlier, many 
of these are used in household and nonproﬁt production processes).

Business spending on ﬁnal goods and services is called “gross private domestic 
investment” by the BEA. This includes business spending on ﬁxed assets including 
structures, equipment, and software, as well as the value of changes in inventories within 
that sector. Why isn’t business spending on wages or on materials such as energy and 

 
MEASURING GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT 
447
raw materials counted here? Recall that GDP only accounts for ﬁnal goods and services. 
Including the value of intermediate inputs with business spending as well would result 
in double counting. 
Sometimes it is not so easy to say what is an intermediate good and what is a ﬁnal good. 
Recently, the BEA changed its deﬁnitions to include business spending on intellectual property, 
as well as research and development, as investments (ﬁnal goods) rather than intermediate 
goods. Making this change raised the value of GDP by $560 billion—not reﬂecting any actual 
increase in production, just a change in the way production is deﬁned (see Box 20.2). 
The simple economy that we discussed when noting how, in concept, “production = 
spending = income” was a closed economy, with no foreign sector. Although sometimes 
countries isolate themselves from world trade (China during the 1960s being a prime example), 
for the most part global economic relations have become increasingly important as advances 
in transportation and communication have accelerated. Because the United States is an open 
economy, we need to take into account interactions with the foreign sector.
Some of the goods and services produced inside the United States are bought by entities in 
the foreign sector. The value of these exported goods must be added to the value of domestic 
spending in calculating GDP. In addition, some of the spending by U.S. residents is for goods 
and services produced abroad. Such spending is, in fact, already included in the calculation 
of spending by the various other sectors in Table 20.3. So the value of imported goods and 
services must be subtracted to arrive at a measure of domestic production.
Net exports measures the overall impact of international trade on GDP. It is the difference 
between exports and imports:
Net exports = Exports – Imports
Net exports may be either positive (if we sell more abroad than we buy) or negative (if 
we buy more than we sell). In 2012, for example, we can see in Table 20.3 that the United 
States imported goods and services worth $0.57 trillion (or $570 billion) more than the 
value of the goods and services exported. (In the table, the fact that the value of imports is 
subtracted rather than added is denoted by putting the number in italics.) Hence, that year, 
U.S. net exports were negative.
Lastly, we come to the expenditures made by the government sector. The BEA calls 
these “government consumption expenditures and gross investment” and breaks them down 
BOX 20.2 WITH THE STROKE OF A PEN, GDP INCREASES BY $560 BILLION
In July 2013, U.S. GDP increased by $560 billion—
overnight. No change took place in actual production. 
What happened was that the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis (BEA), which is responsible for calculating 
GDP, decided to change the way it counts business 
spending.
The BEA established a new category called “intellec-
tual property products,” which includes “entertainment 
originals” such as TV shows that generate long-term 
streams of income. Production costs for such items are 
counted as investment, which is a part of GDP, rather 
than as business expenses, which are excluded from 
GDP as “intermediate goods.” Similarly, research and 
development expenditures, previously considered to 
be a business expense like paper clips or electricity, will 
now also be treated as investment with the possibility 
to generate future income.
This change increased GDP by 3.6 percent in a 
single month. This won’t be added to ﬁgures for eco-
nomic growth, though. Economic growth will now be 
calculated using the adjusted method, so that while 
the overall level of GDP will rise, its trend over time 
will not change. The Commerce Department reported 
that rate as an annual 1.7 percent during the second 
quarter of 2013—unaffected by the BEA’s new method 
for calculation. It will, however, affect the debt-to-GDP 
ratio, making the national debt look a little smaller 
relative to current GDP.

feld’ Worth?” New York Times, August 1, 2013.

CHAPTER 20 — MACROECONOMIC MEASUREMENT: THE CURRENT APPROACH
by whether they are made at the federal level or at the state and local level. These ﬁgures 
represent only spending for ﬁnal goods and services, so they exclude the parts of government 
budgets that go for transfers (such as Social Security). In 2012, about two-thirds of federal 
government spending was on national defense.
Based on the spending by different sectors, we can summarize the spending approach 
with the identity:
 
GDP = Household and institution spending
 
 + Business spending
 
 + Net foreign sector spending
 
 + Government spending
Or, if we want to highlight the portions that are (by convention) considered consumption 
versus those considered investment, we can summarize this approach with the identity:
 
GDP = Personal consumption
 
 + Private investment
 
 + Government consumption 
 
 + Government investment
 
 + Net exports
3.3 THE INCOME APPROACH
The production-related incomes (such as from wages, rents, and proﬁts) earned by all people 
and organizations located inside the United States can be summed up in a measure called 
national income (NI).
If this were a simple economy with no foreign sector and no depreciation, the sum of 
the incomes from production (NI) would exactly equal GDP. But in our more complex 
economy, three adjustments are needed to reconcile ﬁgures on domestic income and domestic 
production.
First, we need to note that some domestic incomes reﬂect foreign production. For example, 
as mentioned above, the proﬁts of a U.S. company may include earnings from overseas plants. 
Such incomes must be subtracted from NI order to reconcile this measure with the ﬁgure for 
gross domestic product. Conversely, the income from some domestic production is received 
by foreign residents, and so not counted in NI. A German-owned factory in the United States 
may send its proﬁts back to its Berlin headquarters, for example. The value of these incomes 
must be added to NI in order to approximate GDP.
In 2011, income receipts from the rest of the world exceeded income paid out to foreign 
residents by more than $250 billion. These “net income receipts from the rest of the world” 
are shown in Table 20.4. When net income receipts from the rest of the world are added to 
GDP, the result is a measure called gross national product (GNP). For many years, GNP was 
used as the primary measure of U.S. production. It measures a country’s production in terms 
of the output produced by its workers and companies, no matter where in the world they were 
located. The BEA switched its emphasis from GNP to GDP in 1991, believing that it is more 
important, for the purposes for which the accounts are used, to track economic activity within 
the borders of the United States. Most other countries, and international economic agencies 
that collect national income data, also use GDP as the standard measure. 
Second, we need to account for the fact that not all of GDP creates income, since some 
domestic production simply goes into replacing structures, equipment, and software that have 
worn out or become obsolete. So we must add depreciation (what the BEA calls “consumption 
of ﬁxed capital”) to NI to get a number closer to GDP. This is a bit confusing—but it is in effect 
national income 
(NI): a measure of 
all domestic incomes 
earned in production

 
GROWTH, PRICE CHANGES, AND REAL GDP

the reverse of what we did above, when we subtracted depreciation from gross investment to 
get net investment. (In calculating incomes, depreciation is typically deducted from proﬁts.)
The third adjustment in Table 20.4 is what is called the “statistical discrepancy.” It reﬂects 
the fact that, no matter how diligently the BEA compiles the accounts, it cannot exactly 
reconcile the results from the income approach with the results from the product and spending 
approaches.
We can summarize the meaningful parts of the income approach by the identity:
GDP = National income
 
− Net income payments from the foreign sector
 
+ Depreciation
Discussion Questions
1. The previous section explained why a country’s “production” and “income” can be thought 
of as roughly equal in a conceptual sense. Why, in practice, does the value of domestic 
production actually differ from the total of domestic incomes?
2. Sometimes GDP is deﬁned as “The total market value of all ﬁnal goods and services newly 
produced in a country over time.” Given the above discussion, how true is this deﬁnition, 
really? Does GDP really count only goods and services exchanged in markets? Does it 
really account for all production?
4. GROWTH, PRICE CHANGES, AND REAL GDP
Economic growth (traditionally deﬁned as increasing GDP) is a statistic that is closely fol-
lowed by policymakers and the media. Inﬂation, or the growth rate of prices, is another of the 
macroeconomic statistics that is considered most signiﬁcant. We now consider the measure-
ment of these two factors and how they relate to each other.
4.1 CALCULATING GDP GROWTH RATES
So far, we have concentrated on calculating GDP in only one year. To calculate rates of eco-
nomic growth, economists must look at how GDP changes over time. The percentage change 
in GDP from year to year can be calculated using the standard percentage-change formula. 
The standard formula, for something that takes one value in year 1 (Value1) and another in 
year 2 (Value2), is:
percentage change

So to compute the growth rate of GDP from, say, 2011 to 2012, we calculate:

For example, U.S. GDP in 2011 was estimated at $15.08 trillion, while in 2012 it was

indicating that GDP grew 4.0 percent between 2011 and 2012.
The BEA and newspapers commonly report the GDP growth rates for quarters, expressed in 
terms of an “annual growth rate.” This is a measure of how much the economy would grow if it 
were to continue to expand for the entire year at the speed reported for the three-month period.
4.2 NOMINAL VS. REAL GDP
Does the number we just calculated mean that the level of aggregate production in 2012 was 
4.0 percent larger than production in 2011? Not necessarily. The measure of GDP used in 
the previous section is nominal or current-dollar GDP, or GDP expressed in terms of the 
prices of goods and services that were current at the time. The 2012 ﬁgure for GDP that we 
used, for example, is based on prices as they were in 2012, and the 2011 ﬁgure is based on 
prices that prevailed in 2011. 
Not only does output change between two years, but generally the prices at which output 
is valued change as well. If prices rose between 2011 and 2012, part of the measured GDP 
growth would be an increase in prices rather than in actual production. Real GDP is a measure 
that seeks to reﬂect the actual value of goods and services produced, by removing the effect 
of changes in prices.
For example, suppose a very simple economy produces only two goods, apples and 
oranges, as shown in Table 20.5. Column (2) shows the price of each good in each year, 
while Column (3) gives the physical production, measured in pounds. Nominal GDP is 
just the sum of the dollar values of the goods produced in a year, evaluated at the prices 
in that same year:
Nominal GDP = Total production valued at current prices
As we can see in Table 20.5, in Year 1 the value of nominal GDP is $200. In Year 2, the 
value of nominal GDP is $300. The percentage growth of GDP from Year 1 to Year 2 can 
be calculated as 50 percent, applying the percentage-change formula from the previous 
section.
But if you look carefully, you can see that only part of the change in nominal GDP is due 
to an increase in production: The quantity of oranges produced rises from 50 pounds to 75 
pounds from Year 1 to Year 2. The rest of the GDP increase is due to an increase in the price 
of apples, from $1.00 to $1.50. Note that the quantity of apples produced has not changed.
4.3 CALCULATING REAL GDP
Until 1995, the BEA calculated real GDP using the “constant-dollar method.” Because the 
constant-dollar method is relatively easy to understand and contains most of the information 
that you need to have as a beginning economics student, we cover it in some detail.
nominal (current 
dollar) GDP: gross 
domestic product 
expressed in terms of 
current prices
real GDP: a measure 
of gross domestic 
product that seeks 
to reﬂect the actual 
value of goods and 
services produced, by 
removing the effect of 
changes in prices

 
GROWTH, PRICE CHANGES, AND REAL GDP 
451
The constant-dollar method uses prices from one particular year, called the base year, to 
evaluate the value of production in all years.
Constant-dollar real GDP is calculated by doing the same sort of multiplying and summing 
exercise as shown in Table 20.5, but using the same prices for all years:
Constant-Dollar Real GDP = Total production valued at base year prices
Applying the constant-dollar method to our simple “apples-and-oranges” example, for 
instance, we might take Year 1 as the base year and express GDP in both Year 1 and Year 2 
in terms of Year 1’s prices. Calculations of constant-dollar real GDP for each year are shown 
in Table 20.6. While the quantities in Column (3) are the same as in Table 20.5, the prices 
in Column (2) are all from Year 1. GDP in Year 2 expressed in “constant (Year 1) dollars” is 
the sum of quantities in Year 2 multiplied by prices in Year 1. This comes out to be $250. In 
the base year, real and nominal GDP are the same.
Using the percentage growth rate formula from the previous section, we can see that 
constant-dollar real GDP has grown by 25 percent. Note that this is less than the 50 percent 
growth ﬁgure for nominal GDP. Some of the growth in nominal GDP is due to price changes, 
not production changes.
The convention of using “constant dollars,” however, has a number of problems. One of the 
most bothersome is that it makes measured GDP growth calculations depend on which year is 
chosen as base. For example, what if we chose Year 2 as the base instead of Year 1? Applying 
Year 2 prices to both years would yield a measured growth rate of 20 percent, instead of the 25 
percent that we calculated using Year 1 as the base. (You can check this as an exercise.) The

CHAPTER 20 — MACROECONOMIC MEASUREMENT: THE CURRENT APPROACH
method also suffers from various biases, which become more important the more dissimilar 
relative prices and spending patterns are between the base year and a current year.
Beginning in 1996, the BEA switched to calculating real GDP using the “chained-dollar” 
method. The concept behind the new measure is still the same—real GDP still is an attempt 
to measure output changes free of the inﬂuence of changing prices. Although there is still 
one year for which real and nominal GDP are equal, it is now called the “reference year,” and 
real GDP is currently expressed in BEA publications in terms of “chained (2005) dollars.” An 
advantage of the chained-dollar method is that, unlike the constant-dollar method, it yields 
a unique growth rate. But the chained-dollar method requires a steep jump in computational 
complexity. Because these calculations are much harder than for the constant-dollar method, 
their explanation is in the Appendix to this chapter.
In Figure 20.1 you can see how measures of real and nominal GDP diverge. Because prices 
were generally rising over the period 1980–2012, nominal GDP grew faster than real GDP, as 
shown by the more steeply rising line. The difference between the rate of growth of nominal GDP 
and the rate of growth of real GDP is the inﬂation rate (discussed in the next section). Note that 
the reference year in Figure 20.1 is 2005; thus real and nominal GDP are the same in that year.
4.4 PRICE INDEXES AND INFLATION RATES
Price indexes are interesting both for how they relate to calculation of real GDP and on their 
own because of their relevance to the policy interest in measuring (and controlling) inﬂation. 
An index number measures the change in magnitude, in this case the price level, compared 
to another period. Generally, the value of the index number in the reference or base year is 
set at 100, though sometimes other values (such as 1 or 10) are used.
The price index most often reported in the news is the consumer price index (CPI), 
calculated by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The CPI measures changes in the 
prices of goods and services bought by households.
Calculating price increases is not quite so straightforward as it might seem at ﬁrst sight. 
For example, in Table 20.5 the price of apples increased from $1.00 per pound to $1.50 per 
pound. Using the standard percentage-change formula, we would say that the price of apples 
increased by 50 percent. However, we also see in Table 20.5 that the price of oranges did 
not change. So how do we calculate the overall price change in our two-good economy?
We would not simply average the two price changes to arrive at an overall price increase 
of 25 percent. Instead, we must realize that changes in some prices are more signiﬁcant to 
consumers because they either purchase more of certain products (such as gallons of milk) 
or because they spend a large portion of their incomes on something (such as rent).

GROWTH, PRICE CHANGES, AND REAL GDP 
453
Thus the CPI is calculated using a weighted average of the prices of the various goods 
and services that it tracks. The mathematics of this is worth a little explaining. A “weighted 
average” is an average in which the different numbers being averaged together are “weighted” 
to indicate their relative importance in the calculation. You are probably already familiar 
with this, in the calculation of your own Grade Point Average. Each grade that you receive 
for a course is “weighted” by the number of credits (or hours) the course is worth. These 
weighted grade points are added up and then divided by the total number of credits or hours 
to yield your GPA. An “A” received for a two-credit course thus receives less emphasis in 
the calculation than an “A” received for a four-credit course.
Similarly, in measuring price levels in the economy, we want to give greater emphasis to 
prices for goods and services that affect consumers the most and less emphasis to the prices 
of relatively minor goods and services. The way to do this is to weight each price by the 
corresponding quantity that is sold at that price.
Once again, however, we face choices about which standards to use. Should we use as 
weights the quantities bought in Year 1, Year 2, or some combination? Until recently, the 
BLS used a constant-weight method to calculate the CPI. Quantities bought during one period 
are chosen as the “base.” These quantities are said to represent a typical “market basket” of 
goods bought by households. A constant-weight price index is calculated according to the 
following formula:
  Constant Weight Price Index =
sum of current prices weighted by base quantities   100
sum of base prices weighted by base quantities
The price-index problem is analogous to the calculation of “constant-dollar” GDP—only 
now it is a common set of quantity weights, rather than prices, from the base period that are 
applied to every calculation.
Consider, again, our “apples-and-oranges” economy. Table 20.7 shows how we would 
calculate the numerator and denominator for the constant-weight price index formula, 
considering Year 2 the current year and using the Year 1 “market basket” as the base. The 
sum of current (Year 2) prices weighted by base quantities is $250, while the sum of base 
prices weighted by base quantities is $200. The CPI for Year 2 is therefore calculated as (250 
÷ 200) × 100 = 125. The price index for the base year (here, Year 1) always equals 100.

The growth rate of prices—that is, the inﬂation rate affecting consumers—is measured by 
the growth rate of this price index:

100
So, in this case, with the price index rising from 100 to 125, the inﬂation rate is 25 
percent.
Unfortunately, when a price index is based on constant weights, it may tend to 
overstate inﬂation for periods after the base year. When the price of a good is rising 
particularly quickly relative to other goods, people tend to look for cheaper substitutes. 
But a constant-weight index assumes that people are still buying the same quantities of 
the expensive goods. Various innovations have recently been made in the CPI to attempt 
to get around this problem. Currently, the “market basket” is updated periodically using 
data from ongoing household expenditure surveys (see Box 20.3). The BLS now also 
publishes “chained” price indexes. The mathematics of these more advanced calculations 
will not be presented here.
The CPI is not the only price index in use. The producer price index (PPI) measures prices 
that domestic producers receive for their output and so tracks many intermediate goods not 
included in the CPI market basket. Import and export price indexes track prices of goods 
traded between domestic residents and the foreign sector. Because they track different goods, 
these indexes—and inﬂation rates calculated from them—may vary.
BOX 20.3 HOW QUANTITY WEIGHTS CAN LOSE VALIDITY OVER TIME
Why do economists and statisticians make a fuss about 
updating the quantity weights used in calculating the 
Consumer Price Index? Consider how household ex-
penditure patterns have changed over time.
In 1901, nearly half the budget of a typical urban, 
working family went toward food, while 15 percent toward 
shelter and an equal proportion toward clothing. The 
family probably spent nothing at all on cars or gasoline—
because automobiles were not yet in wide use!
By 1950, the picture had changed considerably. 
Now only a third of the family’s spending was on food, 
while only 11 percent was on shelter and 12 percent 
on clothing. On average, families were now spending 
about 12 percent of their budget on expenses related 
to private vehicles.
In recent data on consumer expenditures, the 
share devoted to food has dropped even further—to 
13 percent (possibly the lowest the world has ever 
seen). Expenditures on clothing have dropped to less 
than 5 percent of a household’s budget, on average. 
Meanwhile, families are spending more on shelter 
(20 to 30 percent of their budget) and private vehicle 
expenses (16 percent of their budget), than they were 
in the mid-twentieth century.
Using expenditure patterns from one of these peri-
ods to “weight” the CPI in another would clearly result 
in biased ﬁgures. Using the 1901 expenditure pattern 
nowadays, for example, would mean that auto and 
gasoline prices would not ﬁgure into the CPI at all.
The invention of new goods and services (e.g., 
MP3 players) and quality improvements in existing 
goods (e.g., in products for home entertainment and 
computing) continue to create special challenges for 
the economists working to measure price changes.

Spending Has Changed in the U.S.,” Monthly Labor Review

calculations.
4.5 GROWTH AND GROWTH RATES
We have calculated year-to-year growth rates for GDP and prices. But suppose that we want 
to ask how much GDP has grown over the past ﬁve years or twenty years? How do we cal-
culate those numbers? The answer is rather complicated, but fortunately you can use BEA’s 
published NIPA tables to answer such questions.
An even simpler (though less precise) way to get a grasp on the relation of annual growth 
rates to changes over a longer period is by using the rule of 72. Taking 72/x, where x equals 
rule of 72: a short-
hand calculation that 
states that dividing 72 
by an annual growth 
rate yields approxi-
mately the number of 
years it will take for 
an amount to double

 
SAVINGS, INVESTMENT, AND TRADE 
455
the annual growth rate, will give you approximately the number of years it will take for an 
amount to double if it grows at that constant rate (as long as the numbers you are using are 
not extremely high or low). For example, if real GDP grew at a constant 4 percent rate per 
year, it would double in about eighteen years (since 72/4 = 18).
Discussion Questions
1. The “constant-dollar” method of estimating real GDP uses prices for one year to calculate 
measures of GDP for all years. Why is it sometimes important to evaluate GDP in the 
current year using prices from some other year? Why can’t we just always use current 
prices? Explain.
2. How is the “constant-dollar” method of estimating real GDP similar to the use of “constant 
weights” in the computation of the price indexes? Explain.
5. SAVINGS, INVESTMENT, AND TRADE
At a personal level, you produce goods and services, earn income, consume, save, and bor-
row or lend. One of the reasons that you keep personal accounts might be to try to track your 
inﬂows and outﬂows, so that you know whether you are depleting your personal assets or 
accumulating them. If you can save money out of your current income, you are improving 
your ﬁnancial position for the future. However, if you spend down your savings or go into 
debt merely to ﬁnance a high level of consumption, you may ﬁnd yourself in trouble later 
on. Spending down ﬁnancial savings or going into debt can be a good choice for your future 
only if you use the funds to gain another valuable asset. Students often go into debt in order 
to ﬁnance their education, for example, with the idea that it will pay off later by enabling 
them to earn a higher income than they would have been able to otherwise.
There are analogous issues at the national level. Besides keeping track of economic growth 
and inﬂation, systems of national accounting serve another important purpose. They allow 
us to look at the savings-and-assets situation of a national economy as a whole (at least as 
far as manufactured assets and ﬁnancial ﬂows are concerned).
5.1 THE RELATIONSHIP OF SAVINGS, INVESTMENT, AND TRADE
The category at the national level that is analogous to your personal day-to-day consumption 
spending is the consumption spending done by the “household and institutions” and “govern-
ment” sectors. This is spending on goods and services that are presumably “used up” right 
now—they are not expected to help the country over the long term. The analogous category 
to your income is—at least roughly—GDP.
Recall that the spending approach to GDP says that
GDP = Personal consumption + Private investment + Net exports
+ Government consumption + Government investment 
Rearranging, we obtain
GDP – Personal consumption – Government consumption 
= Private investment + Government investment + Net exports
Because saving is what is left over from income after spending on consumption (the left-
hand side of the equation above), we can combine private and government investment on 
the right-hand side to get:
Saving = Investment + Net exports.

456 
CHAPTER 20 — MACROECONOMIC MEASUREMENT: THE CURRENT APPROACH
Thinking about these quantities in terms of valuable goods and services, this important 
identity says, intuitively, that goods and services that are produced in our domestic economy 
in excess of what we currently use for consumption can be investment goods—additions to 
our stock of manufactured assets (including replacement of depreciated assets)—or can be 
sold to foreign countries (in excess of the value of what we import from them).
5.2 NET DOMESTIC PRODUCT AND SAVING
The investment concept used in deﬁning gross domestic product (GDP) is gross investment. 
To calculate what the level of production is during a year, above and beyond the production 
that simply replaces worn-out manufactured capital, we need another concept, net domestic 
product (NDP). NDP is GDP less depreciation (just as net investment, we saw earlier, is 
gross investment less depreciation):
Net domestic product = GDP – Depreciation
Similarly, we can differentiate between gross saving and net saving. To really ﬁnd 
out the extent to which we have “put something aside for the future,” we would subtract 
depreciation from our gross measure of saving. For example, even if our savings were 
positive, if they did not ﬁnance enough investment to make up for the deterioration of 
capital stock, we would actually start the next year in a worse position. Net saving is thus 
gross saving minus depreciation.
Net saving = (Gross) Saving – Depreciation
Net saving is a better measure than gross saving of whether we are “putting something 
aside for the future.”
How much has the United States been “putting something aside for the future” lately? 
According to BEA data, gross savings in the United States were $1.84 trillion in 2011. But 
since ﬁxed capital depreciation in 2011 was $1.94 trillion, net savings were actually negative! 
Net savings in the United States were also negative in 2010 and 2009. Compared to other 
countries, the United States has had relatively low savings rates for many years.

rates derived using the two methods.)

 
APPENDIX: CHAINED DOLLAR REAL GDP 
459
APPENDIX: CHAINED DOLLAR REAL GDP
The key new concept in the “chained-dollar” method is an emphasis on estimating quantity 
indexes for GDP in the current year relative to the year before and relative to the reference 
year.
Chained-dollar measures of real GDP and GDP growth are based on the use of index 
numbers. The ratio of two values of GDP in adjacent years, measured at a common set of prices, 
can be used as a quantity index to measure production in one year relative to another.
The calculation of chained-dollar real GDP starts with the calculation of a Fisher quantity 
index, which measures production in one year relative to an adjacent year by using an average 
of the ratios that would be found by using ﬁrst one year and then the other as the source of prices 
at which production is valued. The type of average used is a “geometric” average. Instead of 
adding two numbers and then dividing by two, as you would in calculating the most common 
type of average (the arithmetic mean), to get a geometric average you multiply the two numbers 
together and then take the square root. The formula for this Fisher quantity index is:

This index has a value of 1 in the reference year, which we take to be Year 1.
The growth rate of real GDP between the reference year and the next year can then be 
calculated as:
growth rate = (Fisher quantity index − 1)  100
For example, we have already made many of the necessary calculations for the “apples-
and-oranges” economy in Tables 20.5 and 20.6. Plugging these in, we get

.
The growth rate of real GDP for the “apples-and-oranges” economy between these two 
years is
growth rate = (1.225 – 1)  100 = 22.5 percent
Note that this growth rate is between the two growth rates (20 percent and 25 percent) we 
obtained by using the constant-dollar method with various base years. The Fisher quantity 
index method gives us a unique average number for estimated growth.
A quantity index for the current year in terms of a reference year that may be several years 
in the past is created by “chaining together” year-to-year Fisher quantity indexes to make 
a chain-type quantity index comparing real production relative to the reference year. The 
chain-type quantity index has a value of 100 in the reference year. In any subsequent year, it 
is set equal to the chain-type quantity index from the previous year multiplied by the Fisher 
quantity index calculated for the current year.
Finally, estimation of real GDP in (chained) dollar terms is made by multiplying the 
chain-type quantity index for a year times the level of nominal GDP in the reference year 
and dividing by 100.

CHAPTER 20 — MACROECONOMIC MEASUREMENT: THE CURRENT APPROACH
For example, suppose that we take our “apples-and-oranges” economy, making Year 1 the 
reference year. Year 1’s chain-type quantity index is thus set equal to 100, and its nominal and 
real GDP are equal. These are shown in Table 20.8. The chain-type quantity index for Year 
2 is the previous year’s value (100) times the Fisher quantity index that we just calculated 
(1.225). We multiply this result, the new index number 122.5, times nominal GDP in the base 
year ($200) and divide by 100 to get real GDP, $245. Whew!

Real GDP (chained Year 1 dollars)
(122.5 × $200)/100
= $200
= $245
This can be continued for many years into the future—or into the past. (For example, if the 
Fisher quantity index calculated for Year 3 were to come out to be 1.152, then the chain-type 
quantity index for Year 3 would be 122.5  1.152.) If you want to check to see that this method 
actually makes some sense, calculate the percentage change in real GDP from Year 1 to Year 
2 using the values in the table above. You will ﬁnd it does, in fact, equal 22.5 percent!
A price index can be calculated for Year 2 (using Year 1 as the reference year) as (300/245) 
 100 = 122.5, showing a 22.5 percent price increase over Year 1. This kind of price index 
is known as a “GDP deﬂator” or “implicit price deﬂator.”
The new method has some other drawbacks, as well. The sum of real components of 
GDP in chained-dollar terms do not generally exactly add up to real GDP. Users of the 
data are also warned not to make comparisons of chained-dollar amounts for years far 
away from the reference year. The BEA tries to make the data more usable by providing 
tables in which, for example, year to year growth rates in components of GDP are already 
calculated for the user.

21 Macroeconomic Measurement: 
Environmental and Social Dimensions
1. A BROADER VIEW OF NATIONAL INCOME ACCOUNTING
As discussed in Chapter 20, GDP is a good (though not perfect) summary of the annual ﬂow 
of goods and services through the market. In the 80-plus years since the introduction of U.S. 
national income accounting, GDP has become the ofﬁcial barometer of living standards and 
business cycles. It appears in newspapers and political debates as a measure of government 
performance and an indicator of economic, political, and social progress.
GDP is not just something that economists look at; rather, numbers on the size and growth 
rate of GDP affect critical national and international policies. It is a measure by which we judge 
presidents and a basis on which multilateral institutions determine how much money they will 
lend to developing countries. GDP numbers are widely used as a proxy for national success.
Yet GDP was never intended to play such a role. Economists dating back to Simon Kuznets, 
the originator of U.S. national accounting systems, have warned that GDP is a specialized 
tool for measuring market activity, which should not be confused with national well-being. 
As suggested in Box 21.1, GDP often rises with increases in things that most people would 
want to have less of, while it often fails to rise with positive contributions to individual and 
social well-being that are not bought and sold in markets.
As discussed in Chapter 3, marketed economic activity occurs within broader social and 
environmental contexts. These contexts can have an effect on national welfare that is no less 
important than marketed economic activity. The various alternatives to national accounting 
presented in this chapter represent our growing awareness of the importance of these social 
and environmental contexts of economic activity. 
In Chapter 1, we mentioned that neglect of the questions of what, how, and for whom can 
mean that growth in production per capita may not lead to increased welfare. Now we can 
go into more detail about the problems that arise from focusing on production alone—or 
from focusing only on the money value of output, with too little attention to the details of 
what is being produced. Many economists, and others analysts, believe that if we are really 
to understand this more complete picture of the economy, and what it is doing for human 
well-being, national governments need to start gathering new kinds of data and creating new 
indicators.
Before we begin to discuss speciﬁc options for adjusting, replacing, or supplementing 
GDP, we ﬁrst need to ask ourselves three important questions:
1. What should we measure? GDP measures only economic production. Are there some things 
that GDP excludes that should be included as a component of well-being, such as health 
outcomes or environmental quality? Should some parts of GDP be excluded because they 
harm well-being, in the short or long term?

462 
CHAPTER 21 — MACROECONOMIC MEASUREMENT: ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS
2. What should be used as the unit of measurement? Although GDP is measured in dollars, 
what units should be used to measure other variables of well-being, such as levels of vio-
lence or air quality?
3. Should we seek to combine disparate well-being indicators into a single “bottom-line” 
number, or should we keep the variables disaggregated (i.e., split up into component cat-
egories)? One tempting approach is to convert all variables to dollars to allow for com-
parability. But what techniques can we use to measure variables such as environmental 
quality or social capital in dollars, and should we even try?
One response to the last question has been the development of satellite accounts,* which 
are intended to supplement standard accounts by tracking data on other well-being indicators, 
such as health, education, and other aspects of social and environmental well-being. For 
example, the United Kingdom maintains environmental accounts that track data on forested 
area, oil and gas reserves, waste generation, greenhouse gas emissions, and expenditures on 
environmental protection.
The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) uses dollar-denominated satellite accounts 
to highlight certain existing components of GDP. For example, the BEA is creating a new 
satellite account that highlights health-care expenditures that fall under GDP but are currently 
obscured by the aggregate measure.1 Beginning in 1994 the BEA also operated a satellite 
account that was designed to see how GDP would be different if research and development 
were counted as investment rather than spending. As noted in Chapter 20, this change was 
BOX 21.1 THERE’S NO G-D-P IN “A BETTER ECONOMY”
The year-end numbers have been tabulated, and 
America is winning the race by a large margin. The 
nation’s closest competitor, China, scores only half 
as high, and European nations, Japan, and Brazil 
lag way behind with little chance of catching up.
This statement is not about medal counts from 
the summer Olympics; it’s not about citizens’ health; 
and it’s certainly not about student test scores in 
math and science. It’s about GDP. The United States 
continues to dominate the race for the biggest 
economy.
Gross domestic product has become the most 
watched and most misinterpreted of all economic 
indicators. It’s a measure of economic activity—of 
money changing hands. Despite the mundane na-
ture of this economic indicator, politicians ﬁercely 
compete with each other to see who can promise 
the fastest GDP growth. Government programs 
and investments in technology get the green light 
only when they are predicted to spur GDP growth. 
Economists, bankers, and businesspeople pop the 
champagne corks when they hear “good news” 
about quarterly GDP numbers.
And while the United States leads in GDP, it also 
leads in military spending, the number of people in 
prison, and the percentage of people who are obese. 
These other ﬁrst-place ﬁnishes seem at odds with 
America’s position atop the GDP standings—that is, 
until you realize that spending on war, incarceration, 
and disease, as well as other “defensive expendi-
tures,” all count toward GDP. The arithmetic of GDP 
doesn’t consider what the money is actually being 
spent on, and over time, we’ve been spending more 
and more money on remedial activities and calling 
this “progress.”
Counting all these negatives in GDP (not to 
mention omitting positive activities such as raising 
children, volunteering, and caring for elderly people) 
seems like an oversight or an accounting mix-up. 
But it also seems like something that could be eas-
ily ﬁxed. Many people, including Nobel laureates 
in economics (and even the laureate who invented 
national income accounting) have issued stern warn-
ings not to confuse GDP with national progress, and 
many forward-thinking economists have proposed 
alternative indicators of progress.

*The United Nations differentiates between “internal” satellite accounts (those that are linked to standard accounts and 
typically measured in monetary units) and “external” satellite accounts (not necessarily linked and measured in either physical 
or monetary units). See http://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/AEG/papers/m4SatelliteAccounts.pdf.

incorporated into the core GDP account beginning in 2013.2 Future uses of satellite accounts 
in the BEA may start experimenting with changes such as valuing household labor or counting 
environmental losses as losses.
In general, the BEA’s satellite accounts rely on monetary valuation and are readily 
comparable to GDP. Other countries use satellite accounts in which the unit of measurement 
is physical units. Even where resources can be easily valued in dollars, data in physical units 
may be more meaningful. Consider that we could measure the economic value of oil and gas 
reserves by multiplying the quantity of reserves in physical units multiplied by the market 
price. But suppose that the market price increases considerably at the same time that reserves 
are drawn down. Although the economic value of reserves could increase, that information 
would fail to tell us that our physical reserves have declined.
Often it is very difﬁcult to convert variables to monetary units. How can we express 
changes in violence or health levels in terms of dollar values? Such questions raise important 
methodological issues, such as whether the economic value of higher asthma rates includes 
only medical expenditures and lost productivity or whether other quality of life factors need 
to be considered. Some may raise ethical objections to attaching dollar values to variables 
such as trafﬁc deaths or biodiversity.
Satellite accounts can be viewed as a “dashboard” approach to national accounting. The 
dashboard on a car provides not only a speedometer but also a gas gauge and an indicator 
of temperature and battery level—and we have in recent years come to recognize the 
value of adding an indicator of how many miles are being driven per gallon of fuel. The 
dashboard on an airplane contains even more indicators, and an economy is considerably 
more complex than an airplane.* Proponents of this approach agree that GDP is a very 
useful record of national output for historical and international comparisons, but believe 
that GDP tells us only one of the things that we want to know about the economy. Some 
of the things that it does not tell us are very important, and they deserve to have their 
own indicators.
As we delve into additional categories that we might wish to have reported in national 
accounts, we may ﬁnd ourselves straying into areas where measurement becomes more 
difﬁcult. Thus we can add a fourth question to our list above: Should we include only variables 
that can be measured objectively (whether in money or other units), or should we also consider 
subjective data? In particular, should one or more of our “dashboard” indicators present the 
results from surveys that ask people about their well-being? We consider this possibility in 
the next section.
Due to funding cutbacks, in the United States progress on improving macroeconomic 
measurement in the national accounts has slowed considerably. Nevertheless, many private 
groups, as well as subnational entities (such as states) in the United States and ofﬁcial statistical 
agencies in a number of other countries are making progress in developing better measures 
to address the social and environmental issues of the twenty-ﬁrst century.
For example, the national statistical agencies of the UK, France, and Germany are 
currently constructing alternative measures of well-being. There has been a proliferation 
of new indicators, more than a dozen of which have emerged in the past decade. Some are 
concentrating on developing reﬁned measures of national assets and production, keeping as 
close as possible to the framework of the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). 
Others are working to develop wholly new indicators, hoping either to replace GDP as the 
major measure of economic success or to persuade the public and policymakers that GDP 
is useful only for some purposes and that other measures are needed to make different 
assessments.
*An example of the dashboard approach is the Key National Indicators System, housed at the National Academies. Created 
by act of Congress but not yet funded, the proposal creates a dashboard of more than 200 indicators. For more info, see www.
stateoftheusa.org.

CHAPTER 21 — MACROECONOMIC MEASUREMENT: ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS
Discussion Questions
1. GDP can be characterized as a (rough) measure of the amount of “throughput” taking 
place in an economy—as measuring the level of activity whose purpose it is to turn re-
newable and nonrenewable resources into new products. How does “throughput” relate 
to sustainable well-being? Is more “throughput” always a good thing?
2. In Chapter 1, we discussed how economies are based on natural, manufactured, social, and 
human capital. Only the value of manufactured capital (structures and equipment)—and 
recently, software—is estimated in the current national accounts. Can you think of ways 
that the stocks of natural, social, and human capital might be measured? What kind of 
information would be needed?
2. WHY GDP IS NOT A MEASURE OF WELL-BEING
Recognizing the limitations of GDP and the need to develop indicators that incorporate social 
and environmental factors, in 2008 French president Nicolas Sarkozy created the Commis-
sion on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress. The commission 
was chaired by Nobel Prize–winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, and the chair of the advisory 
board was another Nobel laureate economist, Amartya Sen. Other members of the commis-
sion included numerous prominent economists.
In September 2009, the commission produced its nearly 300-page report. It concluded that 
it is necessary to shift from an emphasis on measuring economic production to measuring 
well-being. It also distinguished between current well-being and sustainability, recognizing 
that whether current well-being can be sustained depends upon the levels of capital (natural, 
physical, human, and social) passed on to future generations.
2.1 SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING
As mentioned above, GDP was never intended to measure welfare or well-being. Even if 
increases in GDP produce increases in well-being, ceteris paribus, many other factors may 
be equally or more important in determining well-being levels. In other words, well-being is 
clearly multidimensional. The Sarkozy Commission, for example, deﬁned eight dimensions 
of well-being, including material living standards, health, education, political voice, social 
connections, and the environment.
Objective data can be collected that provide information on many of these dimensions, 
such as average life expectancy, literacy rates, and air pollution levels. But such data still 
do not tell us exactly how these factors relate to well-being. If the goal of economics is to 
promote well-being, you may wonder why economists do not try to measure it directly. 
Until recently, most economists believed that it was not possible to obtain quantitative data 
on something that is inherently subjective; we cannot hook up individuals to a machine and 
measure their well-being in unambiguous quantitative terms. But we can take a much more 
intuitive approach—we can simply ask people about their well-being. Although this approach 
may seem unscientiﬁc, a large body of scientiﬁc research has emerged in recent decades 
that suggests that data on subjective well-being (SWB) provides meaningful information 
regarding social welfare levels and the factors that inﬂuence well-being.
Collecting data on SWB involves surveying individuals and asking them a question such 
as: “All things considered, how satisﬁed are you with your life as a whole these days?” 
Respondents then answer based on a scale from 1 (dissatisﬁed) to 10 (satisﬁed). How much 
credence can we give to the answers to such questions?
A wide variety of efforts, such as the World Happiness Report from Columbia University’s 
Earth Institute,3 the Gallup World Poll, and the European Social Survey, have come up with 
remarkably consistent measures of “happiness” or “life satisfaction.” The Sarkozy Commission 
concludes:
subjective well-
being: a measure 
of welfare based on 
survey questions ask-
ing people about their 
own degree of life 
satisfaction

 
WHY GDP IS NOT A MEASURE OF WELL-BEING 
465
Research has shown that it is possible to collect meaningful and reliable data on 
subjective as well as objective well-being. Quantitative measures of [SWB] hold the 
promise of delivering not just a good measure of quality of life per se, but also a better 
understanding of its determinants, reaching beyond people’s income and material 
conditions. Despite the persistence of many unresolved issues, these subjective measures 
provide important information about quality of life.4
The Sarkozy Commission recommends using SWB data in conjunction with objective 
data on various well-being dimensions such as income levels and health outcomes to obtain 
a more comprehensive picture of welfare.
Most relevant for our study of macroeconomics is how SWB results correlate with standard 
economic measures of national welfare such as GDP. We can study the relationship in two 
ways:
1. Are average SWB levels higher in countries with higher GDP per capita?
2. As GDP per capita increases in a particular country over time, do SWB levels rise?
SWB data have been collected for many developed and developing countries. Figure 21.1 
plots average SWB against per-capita GDP, adjusted for differences in purchasing power, for 
56 countries. In general, SWB is positively correlated with higher levels of GDP, but note 
that the beneﬁts of income gains decline at higher income levels, as shown by the curved 
trendline. However, SWB can be high in both rich and poor countries. In fact, the countries 
with the highest SWB levels are Mexico and Colombia, both middle-income countries.
Figure 21.1 also shows that while SWB varies among richer countries, all developed 
countries have relatively high SWB. There are no countries above a per-capita GDP of $20,000 
per year that have an average SWB below 6.0, and many poorer countries have an average 
SWB below 6.0. Thus it appears from this graph that for at least some developing countries, 
increasing GDP could lead to higher SWB levels. But income gains in richer countries are 
associated with much smaller increases in SWB.

CHAPTER 21 — MACROECONOMIC MEASUREMENT: ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS
The other way to analyze country-level SWB data is to consider how SWB changes as a 
country develops economically over time. The longest time series of SWB data comes from 
the United States, dating back to 1946. While real GDP per capita has increased by about a 
factor of three since 1946, average SWB levels have essentially remained constant. But an 
analysis of country trends in SWB over the period 1981–2007 found that average SWB rose 
in 45 of 52 countries, with economic growth leading to greater SWB gains for low-income 
countries. India is an example of a country that has experienced signiﬁcant gains in SWB 
levels as its economy has grown in recent decades.5
Based on both approaches to evaluating SWB, the results imply that as people are able to 
meet their basic needs, such as adequate nutrition and basic health care, their happiness generally 
increases. Beyond that, further income gains are associated with smaller increases in SWB or no 
increase at all. At higher income levels, people seem more likely to judge their happiness relative 
to others. So even if everyone’s income doubles, average happiness levels may be unchanged.
As the Sarkozy Commission mentions, further work is needed to understand the relationship 
between SWB and other well-being measures. But the results so far suggest that SWB should 
be one of the indicators on our “dashboard” of well-being measures.
2.2 CRITIQUES OF GDP
Many important issues are not included adequately, if at all in GDP. In addition, some things 
that are included in GDP can be misleading or represent actively harmful activities.
s  ! CRITICAL ISSUE IS household production, which is examined at more length later in this 
chapter. While standard accounting measures include the paid labor from such household ac-
tivities as child care and gardening, these services are not counted when they are unpaid. 
s  3TANDARD MEASURES DO NOT COUNT THE BENElTS OF volunteer work, even though such work can 
contribute to social well-being as much as economic production does. Also, the free services 
provided by many nonproﬁt organizations (e.g., a homeless shelter funded by donations) 
go unaccounted, even if the workers in the organization are paid.
s  Leisure is another important neglected factor. A rise in output might come about because 
people expend more time and effort at paid work. The resulting increase in measured output 
does not take into account the fact that overwork makes people more tired and stressed and 
takes away from time that they could use for enjoying other activities. But if people spend 
more time in leisure, increasing their well-being, this will not be reﬂected in GDP (except 
insofar as they spend money on leisure-related activities).
s  !LSO INADEQUATELY REmECTED ARE ISSUES AROUND LOSS OR GAIN	 OF human and social capital 
formation. Social and political factors that may signiﬁcantly affect well-being include the 
health and education levels of a country’s citizens, as well as political participation, gov-
ernment effectiveness (or lack thereof), and issues of trust, corruption, or other aspects of 
the economic and social culture.
s  !NOTHER SIGNIlCANT CRITICISM OF '$0 WHEN USED AS A GENERAL MEASURE OF ECONOMIC PROGRESS or success, is that interactions between the economy and the natural world are often ignored. 
GDP generally does not account for environmental degradation and resource depletion, 
while treating natural resources that do not go through the market as having no monetary 
value.
s  3OME OUTPUTS MERELY COMPENSATE FOR OR DEFEND AGAINST HARMFUL EVENTS THAT RESULT DIRECTLY or indirectly, from the economic activity represented in GDP. Referred to as defensive 
expenditures, these show up as positive contributions to GDP but we do not account for 
the associated negative impacts. Consider, for example, an oil spill that results in massive 
clean-up efforts: The billions of dollars spent cleaning up after the 2011 Deepwater Hori-
zon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico turned up as positive additions to GDP, even while the 
environmental and human losses are mostly not reﬂected. When environmental issues are

mostly invisible, there can be an appearance of economic growth even as the ecological 
basis for future economic health is being seriously undermined.
s  Products or production methods that reduce, rather than increase, well-being may show up 
as additions to GDP. Unhealthy foods and drugs and dangerous equipment, for example, 
may lower, not raise, overall well-being. Even if people are willing to pay for such goods 
and services, either individually (perhaps inﬂuenced by advertising) or through their gov-
ernments (perhaps inﬂuenced by interest group lobbyists), such decisions might reﬂect 
poor information or bad judgment when looked at from the point of view of well-being. 
In terms of production methods, if people are miserable at their jobs, suffering boring, de-
grading, unpleasant, or harmful working conditions, their well-being is compromised. The 
divergence between output and well-being is especially obvious in cases where workers’ 
lives or health are threatened by their working conditions, even while their work results in 
a high volume of marketed goods and services.
s  !NOTHER GAP BETWEEN '$0 AND WELLBEING IS ﬁnancial debt. GDP counts consumption 
levels as rising even if the rise is ﬁnanced by unsustainably large debt burdens, whether 
the debt is held by consumers or by governments. When debts are high enough to require 
painful changes in future consumption, not accounting for ﬁnancial debt is similar to not 
accounting for unsustainable tolls exacted on the natural environment.
s  &INALLY INCREASED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN A GIVEN COUNTRY IS COUNTED AS AN ADDITION TO '$0 EVEN if it increases inequality. Two countries with the same per-capita GDP may have a signiﬁcantly 
different income distribution and, closely related, different levels of overall well-being. At an 
individual level, if someone making just $20,000 per year receives a raise of $1,000, this is 
counted as the same societal gain as it would be if that raise went to someone with an income 
of $100,000. Obviously, the additional income means much more for the individual well-being 
of the person with the lower salary. Although economists generally accept this concept (called 
the diminishing marginal utility of income), GDP counts income gains the same regardless of 
whether the person receiving the increase desperately needs the income or is already rich.
The foregoing examples all indicate the social dangers of pursuing policies geared only 
to raising GDP. A narrow national focus solely on increasing output may result in decreased 
leisure and less time for parenting, friendships, and community relations; it can increase levels 
of stress and mental illness, or raise economic inequality to a socially destructive level. For 
all these reasons, improvements are needed in the design of measures of national success and 
in deﬁning and gathering the data needed for such measures. The next two sections describe 
three leading alternative measures.
3. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO REPRESENTING WELL-BEING
3.1 THE GENUINE PROGRESS INDICATOR (GPI)
In 1989, economist Herman Daly and theologian John Cobb Jr. suggested an alternative 
measure to GDP that they called the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW). This 
measure was later transformed into the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), one of the most 
ambitious attempts to date to design a replacement to GDP.* The GPI is a measure of eco-
nomic well-being that adds many beneﬁts and subtracts many costs that are not included in 
GDP. It is designed to differentiate
between economic activity that diminishes both natural and social capital and activity 
that enhances such capital. . . . In particular, if GPI is stable or increasing in a given 
*Another predecessor to the GPI and the ISEW was the Measure of Economic Welfare, by William Nordhaus and James 
Tobin. This 1973 effort was the ﬁrst serious attempt to create an alternative to GDP.

468 
CHAPTER 21 — MACROECONOMIC MEASUREMENT: ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS
year the implication is that stocks of natural and social capital on which all goods and 
services ﬂows depend will be at least as great for the next generation, while if GPI is 
falling it implies that the economic system is eroding those stocks and limiting the next 
generation’s prospects.6
The starting point of the GPI is personal consumption expenditures (PCE). In the United 
States, about 70 percent of GDP consists of personal consumption, with the remainder made 
up of government consumption, investment, and net exports. In calculating the GPI, the level 
of PCE is ﬁrst adjusted for income inequality, measured by dividing PCE by a factor that 
reﬂects the change in the Gini ratio since 1968. (Recall from Chapter 11 that a higher Gini 
ratio indicates greater inequality; the ratio was at a low point in the United States in 1968, 
and has generally risen since then.)
Next, some items that increase well-being but are not measured in PCE are added, including 
estimates of the value of time spent on household and volunteer work and the value of higher 
education. A measure of the services of consumer durables is added, reﬂecting the well-being 
gained from having items such as appliances and cars. Although most government spending 
is excluded from the GPI because it is argued that such spending is defensive, services such 
as those that come from government spending on highways and streets is added.
Then cost items are subtracted, including estimates of social costs, such as the costs of crime 
and lost leisure time, and environmental costs, including water pollution, the loss of wetlands, 
and damage from CO2 emissions. A few other adjustments are made, including an addition for 
the amount by which the net (manufactured) capital stock grows, on a per-worker basis, based 
on the rationale that constant or increasing stocks are necessary for sustainability. A measure 
of net foreign borrowing is subtracted, because consumption ﬁnanced from foreign borrowing 
is offset by increased debt, and thus does not represent a net addition to national well-being. 
The cost of consumer-durable purchases is subtracted to avoid double counting, given that 
a measure of the services of consumer durables has already been included. The adjustments 
made in order to arrive at the GPI for a recent year (2004) are described in Table 21.1.

ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO REPRESENTING WELL-BEING 
469
As we might expect, with all the adjustments outlined above, the GPI differs signiﬁcantly 
from GDP in magnitude and trends. The largest positive adjustments to inequality-adjusted 
personal consumption are the value of household work and parenting and the beneﬁts of 
higher education. But the additions are more than offset by the various deductions, most 
importantly the deductions for nonrenewable energy depletion and CO2 emissions. Thus the 
GPI is signiﬁcantly less than personal consumption.
Trends in real (i.e., inﬂation-adjusted) GDP per capita and real GPI per capita are tracked 
from 1950 to 2002 in Figure 21.2. Not only is per-capita GPI lower than per-capita GDP, but 
its growth trajectory has diverged from GDP since 1978. Since that year, the GPI has ﬂat-
lined, while GDP continued to grow, indicating that environmental and social costs omitted 
from GDP have been increasing faster than the value of the omitted beneﬁts. Relying on the 
GPI instead of GDP would suggest signiﬁcantly different policy recommendations, focusing 
more on reducing environmental damage, preserving natural capital, developing renewable 
energy resources, and redressing rising inequality.
GPI estimates have been developed for countries other than the United States, including 
Australia, China, Germany, and India. The GPI has also been applied at the subnational level, 
not only in the United States (as discussed below) but also in other countries. For example, 
a 2009 analysis of the Auckland region in New Zealand showed that, unlike in the United 
States, in 1990–2006 the GPI grew at nearly the same rate as the region’s GDP (Figure 21.3). 
Even in this case, environmental losses grew at a more rapid rate than the GPI—rising 27 
percent during this period while the GPI rose 18 percent. But the positive contributions to 
the GPI, in particular growth in personal consumption, were enough to more than offset the 
environmental losses.
The state of Maryland, in the United States, also measures its GPI, deﬁning each of the 
variables in Table 21.1 as an economic, environmental, or social component. Figure 21.4 breaks 
down the state’s GPI into these three aggregate components, over the period 1960–2010.7 While 
the economic contributions to the GPI rose steadily, the net social contributions increased only 
slightly, and the environmental costs (negative contributions) more than doubled.
Calculating the GPI requires converting various environmental factors into a single 
metric—dollars. Among the questions this raises is: Can disparate environmental and social 
resources and amenities be compared directly, by any metric? Other approaches to measuring 
national well-being have been developed that avoid the use of a monetary metric but consider 
different aspects of the environment or quality of life rather than using a dollar value.

CHAPTER 21 — MACROECONOMIC MEASUREMENT: ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS
3.2 THE BETTER LIFE INDEX (BLI)
A major challenge to efforts to create better indicators is the difﬁculty of obtaining measure-
ments of the non-monetary variables. The Better Life Index (BLI) launched by the Organiza-
tion for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is somewhat more ambitious than 
the GPI in attempting to include more variables that are not commonly included, precisely 
because they are hard to measure.* (We consider measurement issues at greater length below, 
in our discussion of environmental indicators.)
BLI considers well-being a function of the following 11 dimensions:

*The OECD is a group of the world’s advanced industrialized countries, now including some developing countries, such as 
Mexico. The BLI was created, in part, as a response to the 2009 Sarkozy Commission report discussed above.

 
ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO REPRESENTING WELL-BEING 
471
 1. Income, Wealth, and Inequality: The main variables used for this dimension are dispos-
able household income and net ﬁnancial wealth.* The BLI also considers the degree of 
inequality in income and wealth.
 2. Jobs and Earnings: The main variables comprising this dimension are the unemployment 
rate, the long-term unemployment rate, and average earnings per employee.
 3. Housing Conditions: Sufﬁcient housing is important to provide security, privacy, and 
stability.
 4. Health Status: The BLI includes life expectancy and a subjective evaluation of one’s overall 
health status.
 5. Work and Life Balance: The BLI measures the proportion of employees who work long 
(50 or more) hours per week, the time available for leisure and personal care, and the 
employment rate for women with school-age children.
 6. Education and Skills: This is measured as the percentage of the adult (25–64 year old) 
population that has a secondary-school degree, and students’ cognitive skills based on 
standardized testing.
 7. Social Connections: This dimension is measured by people’s responses to a standardized ques-
tion asking whether they have friends or relatives on whom they can count in times of need.
 8. Civic Engagement and Governance: This dimension is based on voter turnout data and a 
composite index that measures citizen input into policy-making.
 9. Environmental Quality: The main variable used to measure environmental quality is air 
pollution levels, speciﬁcally levels of particulate matter. Secondary environmental variables 
include an estimate of the degree to which diseases are caused by environmental factors, 
people’s subjective satisfaction with their local environment, and access to green space.
10. Personal Security: This dimension focuses on threats to one’s safety. It is measured using 
homicide and assault rates.
11. Subjective Well-Being: This dimension measures people’s overall satisfaction with their 
lives as well as reported negative feelings.
Although the BLI includes many components, it is designed to produce an overall well-
being index. The results for each dimension are standardized across countries, resulting in a 
score from 0 to 10. But how do we assign a weight to the various components? One approach 
is simply to weigh each of the 11 dimensions equally. The BLI report makes no speciﬁc 
recommendations for weighing the different dimensions, but its Web site allows users to 
select their own weights for each of the dimensions (see www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org). The 
OECD is collecting user input and will use this information to gain a better understanding 
of the factors that are most important for measuring well-being.
3.3 THE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX (HDI)
In contrast to the BLI, the United Nations Human Development Index (HDI) is calculated 
based on only three components of well-being: life expectancy at birth, years of formal educa-
tion, and real per-capita GDP. Although they are denominated in different units—both years 
and money—no attempt is made to translate one into the other. Rather, relative performance 
is presented in a scaled index (Figure 21.5).
Like the BLI, the HDI then faces the issue of how to assign relative weights. The standard 
HDI approach is to give equal weight to each of the three indicators. Inclusion of standard 
measures of income as one-third of the indicator makes it highly, although not perfectly, 
correlated with GDP; of the 30 countries with the highest HDI scores in 2011, all but one 
was also ranked in the top 40 by national income per capita.
*In addition to the main variables discussed here, most of the dimensions also consider secondary variables. For example, 
the dimension of income and wealth also includes data on household consumption and a subjective evaluation of material 
well-being.

472 
CHAPTER 21 — MACROECONOMIC MEASUREMENT: ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS
At the same time, the results often show that countries with similar GDP levels vary 
dramatically in overall human welfare, as measured by the HDI. For example, Belize, Namibia, 
and Panama have similar levels of GDP, but their HDI scores vary signiﬁcantly. Panama 
has the highest score in this group because of high education levels and relatively long life 
expectancy. Namibia’s low life expectancy pulls down its HDI score. Angola, Vietnam, and 
Zimbabwe also have similar per-capita GDP values but widely varying HDI scores. Vietnam 
does well on the two nonmonetary measures while Angola scores poorly on both of them, 
and Zimbabwe scores well on education but not longevity.
The relative simplicity of the HDI has made it much easier to apply in countries with less 
money to spend on data collection; hence, it has been especially valuable for developing 
countries. It has been an annual feature of every UN Human Development Report since 1990. 
In a number of countries, the HDI is now an ofﬁcial government statistic; its annual publication 
inaugurates serious political discussion and renewed efforts, nationally and regionally, to improve 
lives and is followed by many development agencies interested in tracking progress. The HDI 
continues to be modiﬁed, with new versions that adjust for inequality and gender equity.
3.4 OTHER NATIONAL ACCOUNTING ALTERNATIVES
Aside from the three measures just described (GPI, BLI, and HDI), many other proposals have 
been made either to supplement GDP, adjust it, or replace it. To give a sense of this landscape, 
we brieﬂy describe a sample of them. Except for the ﬁrst one, they are all indicators that have 
been developed for use in speciﬁc locales.
s  4HE Happy Planet Index (HPI) has been proposed by the new economics foundation 
of London, UK. Like the HDI, the HPI is designed to compare the success of different 
countries, to see how efﬁciently (in environmental terms) each country is able to promote 
the well-being of its inhabitants. The measure multiplies life expectancy by a measure of 
life satisfaction, then divides by ecological footprint, a measure of ecological impact.* 
Life expectancy is a statistic obtainable for almost all countries. Life satisfaction has been 
measured in a variety of ways: The HPI uses subjective well-being data from the Gallup 
World Poll. HPI has been calculated for 151 countries. The index tends to rise with per-
capita GDP up to $5,000, after which it tends to decline, because thereafter the ecological 
footprint increases more rapidly than life satisfaction or life expectancy (see Box 21.2).

BOX 21.2 THE HAPPY PLANET INDEX
The Happy Planet Index asserts that the goal of society 
is to create long and happy lives for its members. To 
do this, natural resources must be used and wastes 
generated. The HPI is made up of three variables that 
reﬂect these concepts:
1. ÛiÀ>}iÊviÊiÝ«iVÌ>VÞ\ This measures whether 
a society’s members lead long lives.
2. ÛiÀ>}iÊÃÕLiVÌÛiÊÜiLi}\ This measures 
whether a society’s members lead happy lives. 
The data are obtained from surveys that ask 
people how satisﬁed they are with their lives. 
Despite the simplicity of the approach, years 
of research have demonstrated that the results 
provide reasonably accurate estimates of an 
individual’s welfare.
3. V}V>ÊvÌ«ÀÌ\ÊThis measures a society’s 
overall ecological impact. It is deﬁned as the 
amount of land required to provide a society 
with the resources that it consumes and as-
similate the waste that it generates. While it 
has been subject to methodological critiques, 
by converting all ecological impacts into a 
single value, it provides an overall assessment 
of sustainability.
Average subjective well-being, scaled between 0 and 
1, is multiplied by life expectancy to obtain the “happy 
life years” of a society. Then the HPI is calculated as:
HPI = Happy Life Years/Ecological Footprint
The HPI has been calculated for 143 countries. The 
countries with the highest HPI scores are those whose 
citizens tend to be rather happy and long-lived but have 
relatively modest ecological footprints, including Costa 
Rica, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Guatemala, 
and Vietnam. One interesting aspect of the HPI is that a 
country’s HPI ranking tends to be unrelated to its GDP. 
The United States ranks 114, just above Nigeria.
The interpretation and policy implications of the 
HPI are unclear. For example, India and Haiti have a 
higher HPI score than Germany or France. Does this 
imply that India and Haiti are more desirable to live 
in, or more ecologically sustainable, than Germany 
or France? Probably not. Another issue is whether a 
country’s policies can affect happiness levels, which 
may be more a construction of inherent social and 
cultural factors rather than policy choices.
But despite its limitations, the HPI has received atten-
tion as an alternative or supplement to GDP, especially 
in Europe. A 2007 report to the European Parliament 
cites several strengths of the HPI, including:
UÊ ÌÊVÃ`iÀÃÊÌiÊi`ÃÊvÊiVVÊ>VÌÛÌÞ]Ê
namely, happiness and life expectancy.

So while the HPI is unlikely to become a widespread 
alternative to GDP, it does provide information that is 
not currently captured in any other national account-

Index, a composite index of 45 variables pertaining to environment, economy, rights, gender 
equality, education, culture, working conditions, health, and political participation. France 
has the Fleurbaey/Gaulier Indicator, which is similar to GPI but tries to incorporate even 
more monetary values of nonmonetary factors (job security, healthy life expectancy, en-
vironmental sustainability), using subjective valuations of these factors to create adjusted 
“equivalent incomes.” They are aggregated and then reduced by the degree of inequality 
in the equivalent incomes.
s  4HE Gross National Happiness (GNH) concept was proposed in Bhutan in 1972 as a guiding 
principle for economic development that takes a holistic approach to improving the quality 
of people’s lives. Although the concept of GNH has been used for decades, the attempt to 
quantify it is recent.8 In 2010 it was formally deﬁned along nine different dimensions of 
welfare, including 33 distinct indicators. For example, the education dimension includes 
literacy and education rates; the psychological well-being dimension includes subjective 
well-being and an indicator of spirituality; and the governance dimension includes data on 
political participation and government performance. The index is made up of both objective 
and subjective data.
One lesson from all these alternatives is that there is not necessarily a positive correlation 
between the total of ﬁnal purchases in an economy (one of the things that GDP is designed 
to measure) and other measures of well-being in the present or of economic possibility (even 
as measured by GDP) in the future. In many instances, GDP is rising while other measures 
stay ﬂat or fall.
The next two sections focus on the issues surrounding two particular elements that 
have been seriously underrepresented in GDP. Section 4 discusses issues of accounting for 
household production. Section 5 takes up environmental accounting, including subsections 
on the methodological problems of how to assign values to things that are not sold through 
markets.

fail to account for something that you think should be included? Think hard about what 
you really think human well-being is about.

Are there some alternatives discussed above that would ﬁt into more than one of these 
categories? Are there some that are difﬁcult to ﬁt into any of them? Would you suggest any 
other ways of categorizing efforts that are being made to improve how we measure the success 
of an economy in achieving well-being for present and future people?
4. MEASURING HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTION
The preceding section described efforts around the world to improve the statistics that are used 
to assess a country’s economic performance. Part of this movement includes interest in gather-
ing data on household production. Many countries, including Australia, Canada, India, Japan, 
Mexico, Thailand, and the UK, have conducted or are conducting national time-use surveys to

aid their understanding of unpaid productive activities. The United Nations Statistical Com-
mission and Eurostat (the statistical ofﬁce of the European Union) are encouraging countries 
to develop satellite accounts that provide the necessary information to adjust measures of 
GDP so that they take into account both household production and interactions between the 
economy and the environment, while not changing the ofﬁcial deﬁnition of GDP.
Efforts to calculate household labor actually predate standard GDP accounts. In 1921 a 
group of economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research calculated that the value of 
household services would be about 25 to 30 percent of marketed production. Decades later, in 
1988, economist Robert Eisner reviewed six major proposed redesigns of the National Income 
and Product Accounts (NIPA), all of which included substantial estimated values for household 
production.9 Despite numerous demonstrations of its practicality dating back more than 85 years, 
however, household production has never been included in the U.S. GDP accounts.
There are strong arguments to suggest that current GDP ﬁgures are less accurate for having 
neglected household production. Most obviously, GDP is understated—a substantial area of 
valuable productive activity has been overlooked (see Box 21.3). This was stressed by Simon 
Kuznets, the architect of national income accounting, when he presented his original set of 
estimates to Congress in 1937. With his typical candor, he noted what was missing, pointing 
in particular to “services of housewives and other members of the family.”
Even the most conservative estimates of the total value of household production arrive at 
numbers equal to about 25–30 percent of standard GDP in the United States, and less conservative 
estimates put the value as equal to or greater than the value of marketed production.
One of the major economic shifts during the twentieth century was the movement of a large 
proportion of women from unpaid employment as full-time homemakers to paid employment 
outside the home. In 1870, 40 percent of all U.S. workers were women working as full-time 
homemakers; by 2000, the proportion had dropped to 16 percent. This increase in work outside 
the home, as well as the increase in purchases of substitutes for home production, such as 
paid child care and prepared foods, was counted as an increase in GDP. The value of lost 
household production, however, was not subtracted. This failure to account for reductions 
BOX 21.3 WHAT ARE STAY-AT-HOME MOMS REALLY WORTH?
What is the fair market value of all the work a typical 
stay-at-home mom does in a year? To answer this 
question we can multiply the hours spent at different 
tasks by the typical wage paid to workers who per-
form those tasks. For example, according to 2012 
research by insure.com, the typical mom spends 14 
hours per week cooking. The U.S. Bureau of Labor 
Statistics estimates the average wage for cooks at 
about $9 per hour. This implies that the annual value 
of a mom’s cooking labor is over $6,000. Applying 
the same approach to other household tasks, includ-
ing child care, cleaning, shopping, yard work, and 
driving, the annual value of a full-time stay-at-home 
mom is over $60,000. Similar research by salary.com 
comes up with an even larger market value—about 
$113,000 annually!
While there are some stay-at-home dads in the 
United States, about 150,000, they are far outnum-
bered by the 5 million stay-at-home moms. But the 
number of stay-at-home moms has been declining 
in recent decades as more women have entered the 
workforce. While this brings additional income to 
households, the income is partially offset by additional 
expenses. In many states, the cost of full-time child 
care exceeds the typical annual cost of college tuition. 
For example, in Massachusetts the average cost of 
child care is $19,000 per year.
While the additional household income and mar-
ket expenditures are counted as increases to GDP, 
the median salary in the United States for a woman 
working full-time is only about $37,000. So based 
on the values presented above, it isn’t clear whether 
total social welfare increases or decreases when many 
women are compelled to enter the workforce.

CHAPTER 21 — MACROECONOMIC MEASUREMENT: ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS
in some home-produced goods and services means that GDP growth during the period was 
overstated. For example, an article in the May 2012 Survey of Current Business found that 
if “home production”—the value of the time spent cooking, cleaning, watching the kids, 
and so forth—were counted, it would raise the level of nominal GDP nearly 26 percent 
in 2010. Back in 1965, when fewer women were in the formal labor force and more 
were working in the nonmarket sector, GDP would have been raised by 39 percent. 
Because the inclusion of “home production” would add more to the level of GDP in 
1965 than in 2010, factoring in the value of these nonmarket activities was found to 
reduce the average annual growth rate of GDP over this period. 10
Comparisons between countries are also made more difﬁcult by the lack of accounting for 
household production in GDP. In countries of the global South, where such activities make 
up a much higher proportion of total production than they do in the developed countries of 
the global North, GDP is even more inadequate as an indicator of national production. When 
we focus on well-being—rather than money ﬂows—as the goal of an economy, it becomes 
especially evident that there is important economic activity in households that is going 
unreported in national income accounts.
Why does this matter? One important reason is that the omission of most household 
production from the national accounts may contribute to a subtle bias in the perceptions of 
policymakers who base their economic decisions on them. Because household work is not 
measured, it may be easy to think that it is not important or not even part of the economy.
The U.S. Social Security retirement system, for example, makes payments to people based 
only on their market wages and years in paid work. Some advocates suggest that people should 
also get credit for time spent raising children—for example, a year of Social Security credit 
for time taken off with each child, in recognition of the contribution that such unpaid work 
makes to social and economic life. Having home production counted in GDP might help 
make policymakers more aware of its productive contributions.11 Interestingly, critiques of 
GDP for its failure to count household labor arise out of both conservative principles, which 
emphasize family values, and progressive ones, which seek to recognize the value of labor 
that has been historically and disproportionately performed by women.
4.1 TIME-USE SURVEYS
A ﬁrst step in determining a value for household production is to ﬁnd out how much time 
people spend in unpaid productive activities. In the past, estimates of time use in the United 
States came from small and sporadic surveys. However, in 2003, following the lead of many 
other industrialized countries, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) began to collect data 
for the ﬁrst national ongoing survey of time use. The American Time Use Study (ATUS), 
conducted by the BLS, asks people age sixteen or over in a nationally representative sample 
to report in detail how they used their time on one particular day.12
The results of the survey for 2011 indicate that, on average on any given day, 83 percent of 
women and 65 percent of men spend some time engaging in household activities, including 
housework, food preparation and cleanup, lawn and garden care, or household management 
(such as paying bills). When averaged over all responses (including those who had not spent 
any time on household activities), women spent an average of 2.2 hours per day on these 
activities, while men spent 1.4 hours. On an average day, 19 percent of men reported doing 
housework, such as cleaning or doing laundry, compared with 53 percent of women.
4.2 METHODS OF VALUING HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTION
After time use has been measured in terms of hours spent on various activities, standard 
national accounting procedures require that these hours be assigned a monetary value using 

 
ACCOUNTING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT 
477
market or quasi-market prices. Economists have developed two main methods of assigning 
a monetary value to household time use: the replacement-cost method and the opportunity-
cost method.
In the replacement-cost method, hours spent on household labor are valued at what 
it would cost to pay someone else to do the same job. In the most popular approach—and 
the one used to generate the most conservative estimates—economists use the wages paid 
in a general category such as “domestic worker” or “housekeeper” to impute a wage. A 
variant of this method, which usually results in higher estimates, is to value each type of 
task separately: child-care time is valued according to the wage of a professional child-care 
worker, housecleaning by the wages of professional housecleaners, plumbing repair by the 
wages of a plumber, and so forth.
The opportunity-cost method starts from a different view, based on microeconomic 
“marginal” thinking. Presumably, if someone reduces his or her hours at paid work in order 
to engage in household production, he or she is assumed to value the time spent in household 
production (at the margin) at least at the wage rate that he or she could have been earned by 
doing paid work for another hour. That is, if you choose to give up $30 that you could have 
earned working an extra hour in order to spend an hour with your child, you must presumably 
think that the value of spending that hour with your child is at least $30. This leads to using 
the wage rate that the household producer would have earned in the market to value the time 
spent doing household work. In this case, estimates of the value of nonmarket production 
can be quite a bit higher than using the replacement-cost method, since some hours would be 
valued at the wage rates earned by doctors, lawyers, and other more highly-paid workers.
Neither approach to imputing a wage rate is perfect. However, it would be hard to argue 
that perfection has been achieved in any of the other measurements and imputations involved 
in creating the national accounts, and many argue that imputing any value for household 
labor time, even using minimal replacement costs, is more accurate than imputing a value 
of zero.
Similar arguments have been made concerning unpaid volunteer work in communities 
and nonproﬁt organizations—the time that people spend coaching children’s sports teams, 
visiting nursing homes, serving on church and school committees, and so on. In the American 
Time Use Survey, 13 percent of the people surveyed reported participating in organizational, 
civic, and religious activities on their surveyed day, a ﬁgure that includes organized volunteer 
activities. If volunteer work as well as household work were both counted in national 
accounts, the proportion of production attributed to the core sphere of the economy would 
rise considerably.
Discussion Questions
1. Do you think that national governments should incorporate a monetary estimate of the 
value of household production in national accounting statistics? How do you think the 
inclusion of household production would affect the measurement of economic activity in 
developed versus developing countries?
2. Think back on at least one household activity in which you have engaged in the past couple 
of days that in principle would be replaceable by market or third-person services. How 
would that activity be valued by the replacement-cost method? By the opportunity-cost 
method? What sorts of manufactured capital goods were important, along with your labor, 
in the activity?
5. ACCOUNTING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
The natural environment underpins all economic activities. To express this observation in 
accounting terms, consider the example of a developing country that depends heavily on 
natural resources. If its forests are cut down, its soil fertility depleted, and its water supplies

polluted, surely the country has become poorer. But national income accounting will merely 
record the market value of the timber, agricultural produce, and industrial output as positive 
contributions to GDP.
The danger of omitting important environmental considerations from our measures of 
success is not limited to developing countries. The United States also depends in many ways 
on its natural resources. Soil depletion has not yet raised the cost of land-based food but is 
likely to do so in the future without signiﬁcant changes in farming practices. The market price 
of ﬁsh has increased with depletion of many species. The United States shares with all other 
countries a reliance on weather patterns that support existing lives and lifestyles; if human 
activities increase the level of greenhouse gases emissions that lead to serious disruptions 
in climate, more severe storms, and rising sea levels, more and more money will be spent in 
what we have described as “defensive expenditures.” Serious attention is now being paid to 
whether these should go into our national accounting on the plus or the minus side.
Recall Figure 2.2, which indicated that the natural environment provides resources and 
environmental services as inﬂows to economic activity and that economic activity also 
releases waste products into the environment. How can these environmental connections be 
reﬂected in national accounting?
Environmental economists describe the economic functions of the natural world under 
three headings:*
1. Resource functions: The natural environment provides natural resources that are inputs 
into human production processes. They include mineral ores, crude petroleum, ﬁsh, soil, 
and forests. Some of these resources, such as ﬁsh and forests, are renewable while others, 
such as minerals and petroleum, are not.
2. Environmental service functions: The natural environment provides the basic habitat of 
clean air, drinkable water, and suitable climate that directly support all forms of life on 
the planet. Water ﬁltration provided by wetlands and erosion control provided by tree-
covered hillsides are other examples of services provided by ecosystems. People enjoy the 
services of the natural environment directly when they enjoy pleasant scenery or outdoor 
recreation.
3. Sink functions: The natural environment also serves as a “sink” that absorbs (up to a point) 
the pollution and waste generated by economic activity. Car exhaust dissipates into the 
atmosphere, for example, while used packaging goes into landﬁll, and ﬂuid industrial waste 
ends up in rivers and oceans. Some waste breaks down relatively quickly into harmless 
substances. Others are toxic or accumulate over time, eventually compromising the quality 
of the environment.
Although for centuries these environmental functions were treated as though they 
were provided “free” and in unlimited amounts, more recently the problems of depletion 
of resources, degradation of environmental services, and overuse of environmental sink 
functions have become increasingly apparent. The next section describes some efforts to 
account for them.
5.1 ENVIRONMENTALLY ADJUSTED NET DOMESTIC PRODUCT
The most basic approach to “green” accounting is to start with traditional measures and make 
adjustments that reﬂect environmental concerns. In current national income accounting, it is 
commonly recognized that some of each year’s economic production is offset by the depre-
*A fourth category of environmental value stems not from use but from mere appreciation of the existence of species and 
environmental amenities; this is felt by some people even if they do not expect to see, for example, a blue whale or Victoria 
Falls. The “existence value” of a given species or resource is difﬁcult to quantify, but it is recognized as a legitimate economic 
value by economists.

 
ACCOUNTING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT 
479
ciation of manufactured, or ﬁxed, capital such as buildings and machinery.* In other words, 
while economic activity provides society with the beneﬁts of new goods and services, each 
year the value of previously produced assets declines, and this loss of beneﬁts should be ac-
counted for. Thus national accounting methods produce estimates of net domestic product 
(NDP), which starts with GDP and then deducts the annual depreciation value of existing 
ﬁxed capital. For example, in 2010 the GDP of the United States was $14.7 trillion. But the 
depreciation of ﬁxed capital that year totaled $1.9 trillion.** Thus the NDP of the United 
States in 2010 was $12.8 trillion.
Extending this logic, we can see that each year the value of natural capital may also 
depreciate as a result of resource extraction or environmental degradation. In some cases, the 
value of natural capital could increase as well if environmental quality improves; that, after 
all, is the point of restorative development. The net annual change in the value of natural 
capital in a country can simply be added or subtracted from NDP to obtain what has been 
called environmentally adjusted NDP (EDP). Thus:
EDP = GDP – Dm – Dn.
where Dm is the depreciation of manufactured capital and Dn is the depreciation of natural 
capital.
This measure requires estimating natural capital depreciation in monetary terms, rather than 
physical units such as biomass volume or habitat area. The methods discussed in Chapter 20 can 
theoretically be used to estimate such values, but to estimate all types of natural capital depreciation 
in monetary terms is a daunting task that would require many assumptions. Thus the estimates of 
EDP that have been produced focus on only a few categories of natural capital depreciation.
One of the earliest attempts at green accounting estimated EDP for Indonesia over a 14-
year period, 1971–84.13 This pioneering analysis deducted the value of depreciation for three 
categories of natural capital: oil, forests, and soil. The values of GDP and EDP over this time 
period are shown in Figure 21.6.***
The results suggest several important points:

rate results. Over the time period covered in Figure 21.6, GDP grew at an annual rate of 7.1 
percent. However, EDP grew at an annual rate of only 4.0 percent. So this case demonstrates 
that looking only at GDP to determine the trend in national welfare may lead policymakers 
to conclude that growth is robust. But accounting for environmental degradation shows 
that much of the apparent growth was at the expense of the environment.

result of a dramatic increase in world oil prices resulting from the 1973–74 Arab oil 
    *Depreciation is simply a measure of the loss of capital value through wear and tear. For accounting purposes, it can 
be calculated using a “straight-line” formula according to which, for example, a new machine is estimated to lose 10 percent 
of its original value each year over ten-year period or using more complex valuation methods. 
 
 
 **Estimates of ﬁxed capital depreciation are obtained from tax records. Businesses are not taxed on the value of their 
ﬁxed capital depreciation—thus they have a strong incentive to claim this deduction. 
 
 
***The analysis actually refers to EDP as “NDP*,” which the study authors called “adjusted net domestic product.” 
But to avoid confusion with the more common usage of the term “net domestic product”—only deducting for ﬁxed capital 
depreciation—we call their environmentally adjusted values EDP.

embargo, rather than a change in the actual oil reserves in Indonesia. Similarly, in some 
years the total volume of timber decreased, but the market price went up, resulting in 
an increase in the overall value of timber resources. This increase in value masks the 
physical degradation of timber resources. So if we measure the value of natural capital 
at market prices, we may lose important information regarding the actual physical stock 
of those resources.*
Since this pioneering study, many countries have attempted to arrive at a valuation of their 
natural resources and environment (see Box 21.4). Similarly, the World Bank has developed 
an indicator of adjusted net saving, which seeks to measure what a society is truly saving for 
its future, starting with net savings (gross savings minus manufactured capital depreciation) 
and making adjustments for education, pollution, and the depreciation of natural capital.14
5.2 VALUING ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
If assigning a monetary value to manufactured assets that are used for only a few years is dif-
ﬁcult, think about how much more difﬁcult it is to determine a dollar measure for natural assets! 
Consider, for example, the value of uranium reserves still in the ground. Perhaps uranium will 
become more valuable a hundred years in the future because countries turn increasingly to 
nuclear power. Or the price of uranium may fall in the future as countries, concerned about 
safety and the disposal of nuclear wastes, explore other energy sources instead. The discovery 
of previously unknown mineral deposits, changes in policies, shifts in consumer demand, and 
new technologies are among the factors that make predicting the future over the long term 
very difﬁcult and thus make it very hard to determine the value of many assets.
Other assets are difﬁcult to value because, although we have a sense that overall ecological 
balance is important to human as well as other life on the planet, some forms of natural capital 
have no apparent market value. Biologists tell us, for example, that in recent decades there 
has been a worldwide decline in populations of amphibians (frogs, toads, and salamanders), 
along with a large increase in deformities in these animals. Clearly, degradation of the 
natural environment is occurring. But since the market value of most frog species is zero,

given year, one could use a ﬁve-year moving average to smooth out price spikes and dips.

 
ACCOUNTING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

there are wide disagreements about how—or even whether—a dollar value can be put on 
these losses.*
As an example, suppose that a hillside is stripped of its forest covering, and the wood is sold 
as pulp for papermaking. The lack of vegetation now means that run-off from rain increases, 
and “Streamside,” a town at the bottom of the hill, suffers ﬂooding and has to repair many 
buildings. In the national accounts as currently constructed, the logging activity contributes 
to GDP in this year (in the form of valuable wood products) and the activity of repairing 
buildings is counted as an economic activity that also adds to GDP in this year.
Or consider an alternative scenario, in which the town realizes that ﬂooding is likely and 
ﬁlls sandbags to line its riverbank. It thereby avoids costly repairs. But, again, both the logging 
and the sandbag making are counted as adding to GDP.
What is wrong with this, of course, is that the initial environmental services of the forest 
in terms of water retention were not counted as part of GDP. If they had been, we would 
have noticed that the efforts of the town did not reﬂect new production so much as a shift in 
production from the “nature sector” to the human sector. Had we included the “nature sector” 
from the beginning, our national accounts would have shown a decrease in the production 
of that sector (decreased water retention) offsetting the increase in production of the human 
sector (that is, repairing buildings or constructing sandbag barriers).
But how should we go about evaluating the environmental services received from the trees 
on the hillside? Normally, economists would try to value the production of water retention 
services of an existing forest by looking at some places in which this value has been translated 
BOX 21.4 ENVIRONMENTAL ACCOUNTING IN CHINA
In 2004 China’s State Environmental Protection Agency 
(SEPA) announced that it would undertake a study to 
estimate the cost of various types of environmental 
damage. The initial ﬁndings released in 2006 indicated 
that environmental costs equaled about 3 percent of 
China’s GDP. The report was widely criticized because 
it failed to include numerous categories of environ-
mental damage such as groundwater contamination. 
Shortly afterward, Zhu Guangyao, the deputy chief of 
SEPA, released a separate report that concluded that 
environmental damage was closer to 10 percent of 
China’s GDP—a value similar to what many observers 
were expecting.
In a 2007 report jointly produced by the World 
Bank and SEPA, the health and nonhealth costs of air 
and water pollution alone were estimated to be 5.8 
percent of China’s GDP.
The results indicate that much of China’s recent 
economic growth has been partially offset by increased 
resource depletion and pollution. Recognizing the 
costs of environmental damage, the Chinese govern-
ment set targets in 2006 for such variables as energy 
consumption per unit of GDP, releases of major air 
pollutants, and total forest cover. China’s investment 
in pollution control and renewable energy is growing 
rapidly. However, the Chinese government’s effort to 
develop green GDP measures have abated somewhat 
in recent years, and some of the targets that were set 
in 2006 were not met.
Further analysis of the cost of pollution and 
resource depletion in China can help the govern-
ment implement policies that achieve true human 
development.
Past policies and decisions have been made in the 
absence of concrete knowledge of the environmental 
impacts and costs. [New], quantitative information 
based on Chinese research under Chinese conditions 
[can] reduce this information gap. At the same time 
. . . substantially more information is needed in order 
to understand the health and nonhealth consequences 
of pollution, particularly in the water sector.

*Going beyond the “existence value” that some people would ascribe to amphibians, others use the analogy of how 
canaries are used in coal mines. Given their high sensitivity to air quality, canaries in distress indicate the danger of bad air 
before it rises to the level that causes humans to lose consciousness. Amphibians are highly sensitive to ground and water 
pollutants, including chemicals that are common in consumer products; their situation may be an important warning about 
dangers to human beings. But this does not resolve the question of how to value them.

into dollar terms. Let’s imagine that near Streamside there is another town, “Sandybank,” 
which has an identical situation, with identical logging, but it has avoided damage by spending 
$100,000 on sandbagging. Our goal is to ﬁgure out the dollar value of a year’s worth of water 
retention services provided by the forest near Streamside.
Suppose that the cost of repairs in Streamside, after the ﬂooding, was $5 million. If you 
estimate the value of the water retention services of the hillside forest using the damage-cost 
approach, you would say that the services are worth $5 million.
However, we could also use the experience of Sandybank as the basis for our value estimate. 
Using the equally plausible maintenance-cost approach, we could say that the value of the 
forest’s services is $100,000. (This is similar to the “replacement-cost” approach discussed 
earlier in the chapter.) As often happens, the two approaches do not agree—in this case the 
value of the forest’s services could be estimated at either $5 million or $100,000.
Economists and environmental scientists face a similar choice in many other areas; for 
example, whether to measure the value of unpolluted air in terms of effects of pollution on 
human health (damage) or in terms of the cost of pollution-control devices (maintenance). 
So far, some national and international agencies have adopted one convention and some the 
other in their experimental environmental accounts.
If the withdrawal of environmental services makes people suffer or die, then we enter the 
even more controversial area of trying to assign dollar values to human suffering and human 
lives. And many environmental effects cross national lines. What is the monetary value of a 
global “public good” such as a stable climate? On whose account should we tally the loss of 
deep-sea ﬁsheries located in international waters?
One approach to the problem of valuation is simply to use satellite accounts, as described above, 
which can be recorded in physical terms, without monetary valuation. So, for example, we might 
note that the forest cover in a country has declined by 10 percent without attempting to value all the 
ecological functions of forests. Many governments have already committed in principle to creating 
such accounts for their own country, and some, such as Norway, maintain extensive satellite accounts 
for many resource and environmental categories.
Discussion Questions
1. In Burgess County, current irrigation methods are leading to rising salt levels in agricultural 
ﬁelds. As a result, the number of bushels of corn that can be harvested per acre is declining. 
If you are a county agricultural economist, what two approaches might you consider using to 
estimate the value of the lost fertility of the soil during the current year? What sorts of eco-
nomic and technological information would you need to come up with your estimates?
2. Some people have argued that the monetary valuation of environmental costs and beneﬁts 
is important because “any number is better than no number”—without valuation, these 
factors are omitted from GDP accounts. Others say that it is impossible to express envi-
ronmental factors adequately in dollar terms. What are some valid points on each side of 
this debate? How do you think this debate should be resolved?
6. CONCLUSION: MEASURING ECONOMIC WELL-BEING
No one—and especially not their creators—would argue that alternative macroeconomic 
indicators have been perfected. It is quite possible to argue about whether damage cost 
or replacement cost should be used in evaluating environmental services, for example, or 
whether more direct measures of poverty should be included in the HDI. Much is still open 
for discussion.
No single approach has emerged as the “best” way to adjust, replace, or supplement 
GDP. As we have seen, any macroeconomic indicator involves numerous assumptions. 
One of the strengths of some of the new measures is that they allow users to see how the 
results change under different assumptions. For example, the BLI allows users to adjust the 
damage-cost ap-
proach: assigning a 
monetary value to an 
environmental service 
that is equal to the 
actual damage done 
when the service is 
withdrawn
maintenance-cost 
approach: assign-
ing a monetary value 
to an environmental 
service that is equal 
to what it would cost 
to maintain the same 
standard of services 
using an alternative 
method

weights on each of the 11 well-being dimensions according to their personal preferences. 
Some have suggested that the best approach is to use multiple indicators, along the lines 
of the “dashboard” analogy mentioned earlier. One thing is clear—reliance on a single 
traditional GDP measure omits or distorts many crucial variables. Thus all the alternative 
approaches discussed in this chapter have some value in providing broader perspectives 
on the measurement of well-being.

22 The Structure of the U.S. Economy
The U. S. economy is the largest in the world. In 2012 it produced over $15.5 trillion in ﬁnal 
goods and services—almost 22 percent of total global economic production as measured by 
GDP of all the world’s countries. In order to understand in more detail how a national economy 
functions, in this chapter we take a closer look at the U.S. economy. This also requires think-
ing beyond the country’s borders, because the management of a country’s natural resources 
or ﬁnancial system can affect the welfare of other countries or the entire planet. Thus while 
our discussion in this chapter focuses on the United States, at times we consider this country 
in a broader international framework.
Although the U.S. economy has grown signiﬁcantly over time, it has also changed. 
An elaboration of these changes also provides more historical context to our study of 
macroeconomics. A clear example is the role of agriculture in the U.S. economy. Early in 
U.S. history, most people worked as small farmers. The United States is currently one of 
the world’s major agricultural producers, but less than 2 percent of the workforce is directly 
engaged in agriculture.* What is the rest of the workforce doing? You may, or may not, be 
surprised to know that more than three-quarters of the workforce is engaged in producing 
“services” of one kind or another, with about 5 percent working in government, while as of 
2012 only about 17 percent of workers were employed in manufacturing and construction.1 
This chapter provides some insight into what is going on in this complex macroeconomy.
1. THE THREE MAJOR PRODUCTIVE SECTORS IN AN ECONOMY
1.1 A QUICK REVIEW OF CATEGORIES
Although macroeconomics often considers “the economy” as a whole, it is very far from being 
a homogeneous entity. We have already considered some ways to classify a macroeconomy 
into smaller units.
s  )N #HAPTER  WE DESCRIBED four essential economic activities: production, distribution and 
consumption of goods and services, and resource maintenance.
s  )N #HAPTER  WE DElNED THE three economic spheres: core, business, and public purpose.
s  )N #HAPTER  WE SAW THAT THE 53 NATIONAL ACCOUNTS CLASSIFY THE ECONOMY INTO four account-
ing sectors: households and institutions, businesses, government, and the foreign sector.
The traditional accounting division by sector, explained in Chapter 20, was a way of 
deﬁning groups according to who produces goods and services. In this chapter, we turn to 
*The United States is the world’s third-largest agricultural producer, based on agricultural value added, behind China and India.

 
THE THREE MAJOR PRODUCTIVE SECTORS IN AN ECONOMY 
487
different classiﬁcation groups, which we refer to as output sectors, based on what is being 
produced. This is slightly confusing, but it is important to remember that these sectors are 
not the same ones discussed in Chapter 20.
The three productive sectors that constitute any national economy are called primary, 
secondary, and tertiary. The primary sector involves the harvesting and extraction of natural 
resources and rudimentary processing of these raw materials. Industries in the primary 
sector include agriculture, commercial ﬁshing, mining, and the timber industry. Generally, 
the products produced in the primary sector are not sold directly to households for ﬁnal 
consumption but to manufacturers as inputs. For example, the wheat grown, harvested, 
sorted, and dried in the primary sector would be sold to milling and baking companies in the 
secondary sector, which would then process the wheat into bread.
The secondary sector involves converting the outputs of the primary sector into products 
suitable for use or consumption. The secondary sector includes manufacturing industries 
such as automobile production, the chemical industry, petroleum reﬁning, the pharmaceutical 
industry, and electronics production. It also includes the construction of buildings and 
highways and utilities such as those that generate and distribute electricity.
Finally we have the tertiary sector, also called the service sector. This sector involves the 
provision of services rather than tangible goods. The tertiary sector includes such services as 
the transportation, marketing, and retailing of physical goods. It also includes direct services 
without the distribution of any physical goods, such as consulting, education, technology, 
ﬁnance, administration, and tourism.
There is no simple mapping from the three spheres that make up the economy (as described 
in Chapter 2) into the three output sectors just described. Firms in the business sphere of the 
economy are distributed among all three sectors. Entities from the public-purpose and core 
spheres can also be classiﬁed as working in one or more of the sectors. In the core sphere, 
for example, a household growing food in a garden is contributing to the primary sector. 
Production of home-cooked meals is a secondary-sector activity. The activities of care and 
maintenance in the home are best understood as services—thus in the tertiary sector. Much 
of the work of government and nonproﬁt organizations (in the public-purpose sphere) is 
accounted for in the tertiary sector but may also be active in each of the other two sectors.
1.2 THE RELATIVE SIZE OF THE OUTPUT SECTORS IN THE UNITED STATES
In looking at the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) in Chapter 20, you might 
have been surprised to see that less than a quarter of GDP comes from production that has to 
do with physical things, and less than 18 percent of workers are involved in that production—
when production is measured in terms of the money value of output.
The italicized caveat summarizes some of what we reviewed in Chapter 21, where we noted 
that the percentages just cited do not include work that is done without pay, such as volunteer 
work, or child care by parents. Indeed, they leave out many other issues of importance to 
human well-being. Nevertheless, because in many instances the most available and consistent 
data are to be found in the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) from the U.S. 
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), this chapter relies on the NIPA to classify the three 
output sectors in the United States.
This means that our discussion of the relative proportions of economic production is based 
on the market value of goods and services. In such an analysis, a ﬁnancial service that is 
produced in a few minutes might count for more than the education produced by a primary 
school teacher in a year—or, to use an image cited by Adam Smith, the production of a handful 
of diamonds could count for more than the production of a reservoir full of water.
Based on such measures, this chapter shows that in the United States, as in most countries, 
the production of physical things is a relatively small, and declining, part of the measured 
economy. Does this mean that we are moving toward a “dematerialized” economy, more 
output sectors: divi-
sions of a macroecon-
omy based on what is 
being produced
primary sector: 
the sector of the 
economy that involves 
the harvesting and 
extraction of natural 
resources and simple 
processing of these 
raw materials into 
products that are gen-
erally sold to manu-
facturers as inputs
secondary sector: 
the sector of the 
economy that involves 
converting the out-
puts of the primary 
sector into products 
suitable for use or 
consumption. It in-
cludes manufacturing, 
construction, and 
utilities.
tertiary sector: the 
sector of the econo-
my that involves the 
provision of services 
rather than of tangible 
goods

488 
CHAPTER 22 — THE STRUCTURE OF THE U.S. ECONOMY
concerned with the production of services such as communication and education than 
manufactured goods? Is this shift toward services good news for the environment? What 
does it mean for our quality of life, as workers, consumers, and citizens?
Market value does not tell us everything that we need to know about the human value of 
different goods, services, and other economic activities. In some parts of the chapter, we go 
beyond NIPA ﬁgures to discuss the parts of the existing economy that do not show up there 
and also to consider issues of potentially great importance for the future that are not yet well 
represented in current accounts.
As you will remember from Chapters 20 and 21, while most government activity is included 
in NIPA data, with outputs valued essentially in terms of the government’s cost of procuring 
inputs, many nonproﬁt as well as most core contributions to the economy are not measured 
in traditional national income accounting. However, we can begin to understand the relative 
size of the three sectors by using NIPA data.
Table 22.1 presents, based on NIPA data, the market value of the annual production of 
the three output sectors in the United States. We see that the private (i.e., nongovernment) 
tertiary sector dominates the U.S. economy, contributing 64.3 percent of total GDP (close 
to two-thirds). Because the majority of government activities (about 13% of GDP) also 
involve providing services, this implies that about three-quarters of the U.S. GDP derives 
from services.
Does this mean that the other sectors are relatively unimportant? Not at all. The tertiary 
sector relies heavily on outputs from the other two sectors. Consider, for example, that a 
restaurant would not be able to provide food services without meat and vegetable products, 
furniture made from wood, and building and equipment based on rock, metal ores, or 
petroleum products (plastics). Some of the money that the restaurant pays for the products 
derived from agriculture, wood, and metal ﬁnds its way back to workers and owners in the 
primary sector, but the larger portion goes to secondary industries such as construction and 
fabrication of equipment.
Even a partner in an investment ﬁrm will need a desk in an ofﬁce building, with computer 
and communications media, all ultimately based on outputs from the primary and secondary 
sectors. In the latter case, the economic value added in the tertiary sector is a giant step beyond 
what had been created in the other two sectors. You might wonder whether this is a sensible 
assessment of “value.” Has the investment manager, compared to the restaurateur, contributed 
much more to the real wealth and well-being of the economy as is suggested by the difference 
in their value added? (We discuss this issue further in section 4.2 on ﬁnancialization.)
Discussion Questions
1. Think about the businesses and industries in your community. How would you classify 
those businesses according to each of the three sectors described above? Does your answer 
to this question concur with the notion that the majority of economic activity takes place 
in the tertiary sector?
2. Try to estimate what share of your total expenditures is spent on products from the primary, 
secondary, and tertiary sectors. How do you think your expenditure patterns will change 
in the future? For example, assuming that your income will rise after you graduate, do 
you think that your share of expenditures on services will increase or decrease?
2. THE PRIMARY SECTOR IN THE UNITED STATES
The primary sector, as we have discussed, is concerned with the harvesting and extraction 
of natural resources. Countries vary widely in their natural resource endowments, and their 
particular resource advantages or deﬁcits affect their economic development and future pros-
pects. This is especially true of the United States. When Europeans arrived in North America 
in the ﬁfteenth through the nineteenth centuries they found extraordinary natural resources: 

 
THE PRIMARY SECTOR IN THE UNITED STATES

fresh and salt waters teeming with ﬁsh, forests full of birds and animals, and huge stocks of 
valuable timber and great plains that were suitable for highly productive agriculture. Europeans 
and later immigrants brought with them, and developed after their arrival, methods of using 
these resources that have changed the landscape and the human experience of living here to 
an extraordinary extent. A quick look at the food, water, and energy systems illustrates the 
evolution of the production and use of primary sector products in the United States.
2.1 THE FOOD SYSTEM
Food, or the land on which it is raised, is a renewable—though, like ﬁsh, also potentially 
exhaustible—resource. Throughout its early history, the United States was an agrarian 
economy. In the late 1700s approximately 90 percent of the labor force was composed of 
farmers. By 1880, farmers still made up about half the labor force. Now less than 2 percent 
of the U.S. workforce is employed in agriculture yet agriculture currently occupies 42 percent 
of the entire land area of the United States—around 1 billion acres—and thus continues to 
dominate the geographic landscape of the country.

Note: The category of “real estate” included in the tertiary sector differs from “construction” (in the 
secondary sector), because it refers to the services of existing structures, as well as to the services provided 
by those who help people buy, sell, or lease properties. Real estate appears to be the largest single industry 
listed in Table 22.1, accounting for 12.6 percent of GDP. This is an artifact of the way GDP is calculated. 
As mentioned in Chapter 20, GDP includes the non-marketed value of services that are provided by owner-
occupied housing—the value of the housing services that owners “rent to themselves.”
The total for GDP is greater than the sum of GDP for the three private sectors and government 
because the total includes additional industries not classiﬁed separately.

CHAPTER 22 — THE STRUCTURE OF THE U.S. ECONOMY
During the twentieth century, agriculture in the United States underwent dramatic changes. 
Major trends included a decline in the total farm population, a decrease in the total number of 
farms, an increase in average farm size, and an increase in agricultural productivity (i.e., output 
per acre, as well as output per worker). There are now about 2 million farms in the United States, 
of which about 92 percent are classiﬁed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as “small family 
farms”: those with annual sales of $250,000 or less. The small farms produce less than one-third 
of the country’s agricultural output. Meanwhile, farms with annual sales of more than $1 million 
(only about 1 percent of all farms) account for nearly half the value of agricultural production. 
The largest farms in the country tend to be owned as corporate enterprises with annual sales of 
millions of dollars. Farm receipts in the United States are approximately evenly divided between 
livestock and crops. The majority of the grain produced in the United States (about 60 percent) 
is not directly used for human consumption but instead is fed to livestock.
Agricultural productivity has increased as human labor has been replaced by mechanization 
and as the use of modern agricultural technologies has spread. For example, in the past hundred 
years, average corn yields in the United States have risen from around 25 to 140 bushels per 
acre, and wheat yields have increased from 12 to 40 bushels per acre. One American farmer 
now provides enough food and clothing for about 130 people. 
Most of the agricultural products that people consume are not obtained directly from farmers 
but undergo signiﬁcant processing prior to being sold to consumers. As we see in Figure 22.1, 
less than 12 cents of every dollar spent on food in the United States is paid to farmers. Food 
services—restaurants and other places serving food away from home—receive more than one-
third of what Americans pay for food. The next largest portion (18.6 cents of every dollar) is 
spent on food processing before the point of sale to consumers or food services. Of each dollar, 
13.6 cents goes to the retailer who mediates between the producers/processors and consumers. 
The remainder is spent for packaging, transportation, energy, ﬁnance, insurance, and “other,” 
which includes advertising (2 cents) and legal and accounting services (1.8 cents).
Figure 22.1 suggests that the impact of agriculture extends well into the secondary and 
tertiary sectors. Even though few people are directly employed in agriculture, nearly 20 
percent of all American jobs can be considered dependent on agriculture. Most of these jobs 
are in wholesaling, retailing, or food services.
2.2 WATER
Depletion of groundwater supplies in the United States is a serious threat to agriculture as well 
as to patterns of habitation. Agriculture is responsible for about four-ﬁfths of our country’s

What we eat comes from the 
primary sector, but only about 18.4 
percent of the ﬁnal cost of food is 
directly associated with the primary 
sector activities of growing food and 
supplying energy for its production, 
processing, etc. 22.4 percent of 
the ﬁnal cost is attributed to the 
secondary sector, for processing and 
packaging (though we should note 
that the physical inputs to packaging 
also derive from the primary sector). 
All the rest—59 percent—goes to 
tertiary sector activities.

THE PRIMARY SECTOR IN THE UNITED STATES 
491
water use, much of it used to irrigate crops in Western states. More than one-third of the ir-
rigation water used in the country comes from groundwater aquifers, which are renewable 
resources that recharge very slowly and can become depleted when withdrawals exceed the rate 
of natural recharge (somewhat analogous to catching ﬁsh at a greater rate than its populations 
reproduce). Currently, the United States is withdrawing groundwater approximately four times 
faster than it is being replenished, most obviously in Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska, which 
rely on water from the Ogallala Aquifer, the world’s largest known aquifer. The water table 
for the Ogallala Aquifer is declining as much as 2 feet per year, and water supplies from the 
aquifer have already been exhausted in some areas. The declining water table in the aquifer 
has motivated increased use of efﬁcient irrigation practices, but over time many more areas 
will lose access to this resource. Most likely, these areas will need to either switch to different 
crops that require less water or be removed from agricultural production.
Fortunately, water conservation methods have dramatically decreased both the absolute 
and the per-person amount of fresh water used in the United States since their peak in 1980. 
Per-person use is about 25 percent lower today than it was then. Reasons for what is essentially 
a behavioral change include higher energy costs, resulting in energy conservation, as well as 
federal and state laws mandating efﬁciency in appliances (more fresh water is used to produce 
electricity than for any other purpose except farming). For example, through technology and 
redesign the average amount of water in a standard ﬂush toilet—the domestic appliance with 
the largest water use—fell from 6 gallons to 1.6. And farmers have been increasingly relying 
on a variety of strategies to reduce water use, including crops (some genetically modiﬁed) 
that require less water and drip irrigation, which applies tiny amounts of water directly to 
the roots of crops.
2.3 THE ENERGY SYSTEM
Modern production and consumption systems require energy—a lot of energy. The United 
States is the world’s second-largest consumer of energy, behind China. But in per capita terms, 
U.S. energy consumption is about four times that of China. Although the United States has 
less than 5 percent of the world’s population, it uses about 20 percent of the world’s energy. 
New York State, with 19.5 million residents, uses as much energy as 800 million residents of 
sub-Saharan Africa (all the residents of that region, except the Republic of South Africa). The 
United States has one of the highest per-capita energy usage rates in the world, exceeded only 
by a few countries, such as the high-latitude countries of Canada, Norway, and Iceland. It is 
worth noting that the last two of these derive most of their electricity from renewable sources 
(Norway 97 percent, Iceland 100 percent), while Canada gets 63 percent of its electricity 
from renewables (mostly hydropower).
We can also compare countries by looking at the amount of energy used per dollar of GDP. 
A low number is generally indicative of an economy that is energy efﬁcient in its production 
processes. The United States is about average among industrialized countries in the energy 
efﬁciency of production—more efﬁcient than Finland or Canada, but less efﬁcient than 
Switzerland, Germany, or Japan.
Figure 22.2 shows the sources used to obtain energy in the United States. We can see that 
the country is heavily dependent on fossil fuels; petroleum is the single most important energy 
source, and carbon-based fossil fuels (petroleum, coal, and natural gas) provide 82 percent 
of all energy used in the country. Coal, often viewed as a fuel from an earlier industrial age, 
is still the primary fuel for electricity generation in the United States; as of 2012 it was the 
source of about 40 percent of the nation’s electricity. Meanwhile, petroleum provides nearly 
all the fuel for transportation.
Nuclear power is primarily used to generate electricity, providing about 20 percent of the 
country’s electricity supply. Although some energy analysts predicted a “nuclear renaissance” 
in the early twenty-ﬁrst century, cost considerations and the 2011 accident at the nuclear power 

492 
CHAPTER 22 — THE STRUCTURE OF THE U.S. ECONOMY
plant in Fukushima, Japan, have caused most plans to expand nuclear power in the United 
States to be shelved. Thus the current trend is for the national share of energy derived from 
nuclear power to decline in the future, as aging plants are decommissioned.
The United States currently obtains a small share of its energy from renewable resources, 
but the utilization of renewable energy is increasing rapidly. Wind energy is the fastest-
growing energy source in the country, increasing by over 2,400 percent between 2000 and 
2011. A few states, such as Iowa and South Dakota, get nearly 25 percent of their electricity 
from wind. Solar energy use has also grown signiﬁcantly, increasing more than 200 percent 
between 2000 and 2011. A 2013 article in Energy Policy outlined how New York State could 
supply all its energy needs from wind, solar, and water power by 2030, creating 58,000 jobs 
in the process. The main author of the study commented, “You could power America with 
renewables, from a technical and economic standpoint. The biggest obstacles are social and 
political—what you need is the will to do it.”2
The United States is not only the world’s second-largest consumer of energy; it is also 
the world’s second-largest energy producer (again, behind China). In 2010 the United States 
produced 15 percent of the world’s energy. It has experienced an energy boom in recent years, 
with an increase in total energy production of about 14 percent between 2005 and 2012. The 
majority of this growth is due to increased production of natural gas and oil. Novel extraction 
technologies, particularly hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as “fracking,” have made 
it economically viable to tap fossil fuel deposits 2 miles or more below the ground (see Box 
22.1 for a discussion of the debate over fracking).
In the 1950s, the country was essentially energy independent, obtaining only about 15 
percent of its oil from imports. At the onset of the ﬁrst energy crisis in 1973, the United States 
had come to rely on imports for about 35 percent of its oil. In 2006, this dependence peaked 
at 60 percent but as a result of increased domestic production it has declined since then. In 
2012 the United States imported 40 percent of its oil supplies. 
A common fallacy is that the United States obtains most of its imported oil from the 
Middle East. In fact, less than 20 percent of the country’s oil imports come from Persian Gulf 
countries. The largest exporter of oil to the United States is Canada, which supplies three 
times as much oil as Saudi Arabia. Other important sources of foreign oil include Mexico, 
Venezuela, and Russia.
Although energy use permeates every aspect of economic activity in the United States, 
the production of energy currently employs less than a million workers, or about 0.5 percent 
Figure 22.2 Energy Consumption in the United States, by Energy Source, 2012
Source: Monthly Energy Review, United States Energy Information Administration, February 25, 2013.
Over 80 percent of the energy 
consumed in the United States 
comes from fossil fuels. While 
the share of energy coming from 
renewables such as wind, solar, and 
geothermal energy is increasing, 
these still provide less than 2 
percent of energy supplies.

of the workforce, and directly contributes a similar small share to GDP. Yet ﬂuctuations in 
energy supply and prices can have signiﬁcant impacts on economy-wide variables such as 
GDP growth, inﬂation, and employment. Increases in energy prices lead to downstream 
increases in the price of many other products and higher inﬂation rates. Dramatic energy 
price increases in recent decades, particularly in the price of oil, have precipitated recessions 
at both the national and international levels.
Discussion Questions
1. How do you obtain most of your food? Does it come from a supermarket, or do you get some 
from a farmers’ market or grow your own? Are you surprised to learn that less than 12 cents 
of a dollar spent on food goes to the primary sector, where the food is actually produced?
2. Do you think that the heavy dependence of the United States on fossil fuels for energy is 
a problem? How likely is it that this might change in the future?
3. THE SECONDARY (INDUSTRIAL) SECTOR IN THE UNITED STATES
When asked what makes up an economy, many people think ﬁrst of manufacturing. And although 
the share of GDP from manufacturing has been declining in the United States for several decades, 
the United States remains a major manufacturer. In fact, in 2010 the United States was the world’s 
largest manufacturer by value added, just slightly ahead of China. The United States has about 
335,000 manufacturing enterprises, which together employ about 13 million people.
The secondary sector includes construction and utilities as well as manufacturing. These 
industries comprise 17 percent of GDP in the United States (Table 22.1) and employ about 18 
percent of the workforce, with about 10 percent in manufacturing and the rest in construction 
and utilities.
BOX 22.1 FRACKING AND THE U.S. ENERGY BOOM
Fracking is the process of pumping ﬂuids under high 
pressure into fossil-fuel deposits, creating numerous 
fractures that release the fuel from the surrounding 
rock and allow extraction. Combined with deep-well 
horizontal drilling techniques, this technology allows 
the development of previously uneconomic oil and gas 
reserves across the United States, including in Texas, 
North Dakota, and Pennsylvania.
Proponents of fracking in the United States argue 
that obtaining oil from domestic sources is better than 
importing it. Natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel, thus 
substituting it for coal in electricity generation reduces 
carbon emissions and other air pollutants. Increased 
U.S. production of natural gas has resulted in falling 
prices—a decline of more than 50% between 2007 
and 2012. The recent U.S. energy boom as a result 
of fracking has increased employment in previously 
impoverished areas.
Opponents of fracking point to the potential for 
water contamination. While the fuel deposits are 
normally much deeper underground than drinking 
water aquifers, drilling through these aquifers means 
that leaks in the concrete casings could threaten water 
supplies. Many of the chemicals used for fracking 
are highly toxic. The U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) has already documented several cases 
of drinking water contamination as a result of frack-
ing. Another concern is that the increased availability 
of domestic fossil fuels distracts us from the need to 
develop renewable substitutes.
In December 2012, the EPA noted that “responsible 
development of America’s oil and gas resources offers 
important economic, energy security, and environmen-
tal beneﬁts. However, as the use of hydraulic fracturing 
has increased, so have concerns about its potential 
human health and environmental impacts, especially 
for drinking water.” The EPA is currently studying the 
health and environmental impacts of fracking, with 
a draft report due out in 2014. Meanwhile, in 2011 
France became the ﬁrst country to ban fracking, and 
several other countries have prohibited the process.

CHAPTER 22 — THE STRUCTURE OF THE U.S. ECONOMY
3.1 CONSTRUCTION AND HOUSING
The construction industry is particularly affected by macroeconomic conditions, as has been 
evident in the aftermath of the global ﬁnancial crisis. In 2006—the peak of the housing bubble, 
as discussed in Chapter 30—more than $900 billion was spent on new private construction 
in the United States. In 2010, the value of new private construction fell by 44 percent to only 
$500 billion. As of 2013, it had started to rise again, but at a modest pace. Figure 22.3 shows 
how the number of housing starts decline during recessionary periods but then recover after 
a recession is over. (The data follow housing starts because only the ﬂow of newly con-
structed housing, not the level of pre-existing housing, count in measuring the production of 
the secondary sector.) Note that housing starts bottomed out in 2009 at the end of the recent 
recession and have slowly begun to recover. But the collapse from the mid-2000s peak was 
so severe that as recently as 2012 starts were only about 40 percent of what they were seven 
years earlier. The volatility of this industry is suggested by the fact that, in 2013, some people 
were again starting to talk about a shortage of new housing.
3.2 MANUFACTURING
Even in the U.S. economy, which is dominated by services, manufacturing still employs about 
10 percent of the labor force. Table 22.2 presents a summary of the production and employ-
ment in major manufacturing industries in the country. No single manufacturing industry 
dominates, but the top industries include transportation equipment (mostly automobiles), 
computers and electronics, metal products, chemicals, and food processing. Here we discuss 
just two: textiles and automobiles.
Textiles
In the 1800s the textile and apparel industry arose as this country’s ﬁrst large-scale manufac-
turing industry, with the majority of the mills located in the Northeast. The mills, employing 
mostly women and girls, were the scene of some of the nation’s early labor union battles, as 
the women fought to limit the work day to ten hours. The textile industry expanded rapidly, 
increasingly using immigrant labor and becoming the largest manufacturing employer in 
the country by the start of the twentieth century. In 1920 nearly two million workers were

employed in the industry. Then, faced with foreign competition, particularly from Japan, the 
industry stopped expanding. Employment in the American textile industry remained around 
two million workers for the next ﬁfty years or so.
Since the 1970s, the textile and apparel industry in the United States has been decimated—
employment in the industry has declined about 90 percent, and the decline appears likely 
to continue into the future. Imports from China have been at the center of the debate on 
manufacturing job losses in the United States. In 2002 import quota restrictions were removed 
from 29 categories of apparel. In just two years China more than doubled its exports of 
textiles and apparel to the United States. Chinese imports can be produced at lower cost 
than domestic goods primarily because of lower wages. China currently dominates global 
textile manufacturing, but this may be changing. In recent years, textile manufacturing has 
been leaving China for countries with even lower wages, including Bangladesh, Cambodia, 
and India.
Textiles and clothing are outstanding examples of a category of manufactured items that (1) 
are labor intensive (i.e., their production requires a large number of labor hours in proportion 
to the cost of other inputs) and (2) can be produced with large numbers of unskilled laborers. 
These characteristics create conditions in which countries with large populations of poor 
people can compete on the international market.
Automobiles
In contrast to textiles, the automobile industry in the United States beneﬁted from a number 
of factors during the twentieth century. One was the “ﬁrst-mover advantage” gained by the 
leadership of Henry Ford and others who innovated and created strong industries before most 
foreign competitors. Another was the fact that the United States has a huge domestic market. 
Not needing to rely on exports is an advantage in an industry in which the transaction cost 
involved in shipping automobiles over long distances creates a cost disadvantage for foreign 
producers. In addition, for a long time the technology of automobile production was such 
that the greater productivity of more skilled workers enabled them to compete successfully 
against lower-wage workers who had less education, training, and skill (summarized in many 
economic discussions as “human capital”).

CHAPTER 22 — THE STRUCTURE OF THE U.S. ECONOMY
The ﬁrst challenge to the preeminence of the U.S. auto companies in the enormous 
domestic market came with the oil crises of the 1970s. This motivated a surge in imports of 
high-quality, fuel-efﬁcient vehicles from Japan. By 1980 the Japanese automobile industry, 
virtually nonexistent twenty years earlier, had captured over 20 percent of the U.S. market. 
The impact of this ﬁrst wave of foreign competition on the domestic motor vehicle industry 
was severe. Between 1977 and 1982 employment in the industry in the United States declined 
30 percent.
In the 1980s and 1990s, the domestic automobile industry recovered, for several reasons. 
First, U.S. automobile manufacturers improved the quality of their vehicles, often either 
emulating Japanese production methods or forming joint ventures with foreign producers. 
Another factor was the decline in gasoline prices in the 1980s, which shifted demand back 
toward larger domestic vehicles. Sales of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, initially 
produced almost exclusively by American companies, increased dramatically during this 
period.
The U.S. auto industry again fell on hard times in the 2000s, ﬁrst from a signiﬁcant decline in 
sales of fuel-inefﬁcient vehicles due to higher gas prices and then from the global ﬁnancial crisis. 
General Motors was hit particularly hard. Between just 2006 and 2009, annual vehicle production 
by U.S. automakers fell more than 50 percent. In 2008 and 2009, the federal government rescued 
General Motors and Chrysler through loans exceeding $60 billion, made through the Troubled 
Asset Relief Program (TARP). The federal government also took an ownership share of each 
company. As the economy improved and manufacturers shifted toward more fuel-efﬁcient 
vehicles, the two companies were able to repay their TARP loans. Employment in the automotive 
industry has begun to recover, but remains well below its peak.
3.3 WHERE HAVE ALL THE MANUFACTURING JOBS GONE?
According to some measures, the size of the secondary sector has stayed fairly constant over 
the past half-century. For example, the value added from manufacturing, when adjusted for 
inﬂation, is about the same magnitude now as it was in the 1960s. However, as we have seen, 
its share of GDP has declined because the size of the service sector has grown so much.
Yet even though the value of manufacturing output has held fairly constant, employment 
in manufacturing has declined. As shown in Figure 22.4, while there were some ups and 
downs, total employment in manufacturing generally increased from 1950 until 1979. Since 
then, two periods of decline have occurred in manufacturing employment, ﬁrst in the early 
1980s and more recently since the late 1990s. From a peak of more than 20 million workers 
in 1979, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined by 30 percent.
The decline in U.S. manufacturing industries does not indicate declining demand for 
manufactured goods. The United States imports signiﬁcantly more manufactured goods than 
it sells abroad, resulting in a trade deﬁcit in goods of $736 billion in 2012. When we combine 
data on both foreign and domestic goods, the U.S. demand for goods increased by 226 percent 
between 1980 and 2012, even after adjusting for inﬂation. So while the U.S. economy is 
becoming more service oriented, as a share of GDP, this does not signify an absolute decline 
in the demand for manufactured goods.
These ﬁgures suggest that American manufacturing jobs have essentially shifted overseas. 
In 1992, American manufacturers met 73 percent of the domestic demand for goods. In 2012 
they met only 51 percent. The major sources of imports in goods are (in order of the 2012 
value of imports): China, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Germany. The U.S. trade deﬁcit with all 
these countries has grown, especially with China. The value of imports from China (including 
both goods and services) increased 290 percent between 2001 and 2012 alone.
Although imports have clearly played a role, the decline in the absolute number of U.S. 
manufacturing jobs predates the dramatic increase in imports from China. In fact, the decline 
is not unique to the United States but is a worldwide phenomenon. The absolute number 

 
THE SECONDARY (INDUSTRIAL) SECTOR IN THE UNITED STATES 
497
of manufacturing jobs peaked years ago in virtually all industrial countries. The same is 
true, or is rapidly becoming true, in emerging markets, where rapid productivity growth 
allows real wages and output to rise, while the number of manufacturing jobs declines and 
the service sector expands relative to manufacturing. China, the trading partner that has 
been perceived as the greatest threat to jobs in the United States, has also generally been 
losing manufacturing jobs. For example, between 1995 and 2002 China lost 14.9 million 
manufacturing jobs—more than the entire current U.S. manufacturing workforce. This 
job loss happened even though value-added manufacturing in China grew by 90 percent 
in real terms during this period.
What is the cause of this global phenomenon? It appears that in recent decades an 
acceleration has taken place in the process that began with the Industrial Revolution in 
the mid- to late eighteenth century, in which technological change makes it possible for 
industries to substitute manufactured capital (i.e., machinery and automation) for human 
labor. Manufacturing productivity is commonly measured as an index of the value of the 
goods produced per hour of labor. Manufacturing productivity in the United States over the 
past few decades has been growing faster than overall business productivity, and the progress 
has accelerated since 1990. During the 1980s, manufacturing productivity increased by an 
average of 2.6 percent per year, but the rate rose to 4 percent per year during the 1990s, falling 
slightly to about 3.2 percent per year since then.
The increase in productivity means that more goods can be produced using fewer 
human labor-hours. Although global demand for manufactured goods continues to grow, 
it has not grown as rapidly as productivity. More goods and services are produced and 
sold, but fewer people are required to produce them. Hence the worldwide availability 
of manufacturing jobs has been a “shrinking pie.” Still, changes in labor prices and the 
availability of productive capital mean that manufacturing does often shift across national 
borders. Recent wage increases in China make it less attractive to manufacturers and may 
even signal an opportunity for an increase in U.S. manufacturing. For more on this issue, 
see Box 22.2.
What does this mean for human well-being? An economist looking forward to this situation 
one or two hundred years ago might have said that it is exactly what progress is supposed 
to be about—that people can get more of what they want with less work. However, people 
can only purchase the output of a market economy if they have income, and for most people 
income comes primarily through wages, which are attached to jobs. The accelerating shift of 
jobs from the secondary to the tertiary sector is a topic discussed in Chapter 23.

CHAPTER 22 — THE STRUCTURE OF THE U.S. ECONOMY
Discussion Questions
1. One of the main impacts of the Great Recession in the United States was a signiﬁcant 
decline in housing prices in most areas of the country. However, at the same time, the 
number of homes sold also declined dramatically. Shouldn’t the decline in housing prices 
have resulted in an increase in home sales, as suggested by a basic model of supply and 
demand?
2. Some people cite the return from the suburbs to urban areas and the lower percentage of 
young people getting driver’s licenses as indications that “the age of the automobile is 
drawing to a close.” Do you think that this is true? If automobile use were to fall in half 
over the next 15 years, what impact would this have on the economy?
4. THE TERTIARY (SERVICE) SECTOR
Early in this chapter, we gave an intuitive explanation for why, even though people are just 
as dependent as they have always been on the materials extracted from nature, the primary 
sector has shrunk in economic importance as societies have industrialized. It was not hard 
to explain how manufacturing came to claim a larger part of every household budget and 
therefore of the total economy; however, we are still left with questions about how “services” 
have more recently become so signiﬁcant.
Even more than the other sectors, the tertiary sector cannot be deﬁned as a homogeneous 
economic category. As we saw in Table 22.1, the service sector includes a wide variety of 
industries, including education, retail trade, ﬁnancial services, insurance, waste management, 
and entertainment. The Appendix to this chapter provides one approach to putting these 
BOX 22.2 ARE MANUFACTURING JOBS COMING BACK TO THE UNITED STATES?
At least part of the decline in American manufacturing 
jobs is a result of cheap labor in countries such as China 
and India. In the early 2000s, Chinese manufacturing 
wages averaged only $0.50 per hour, only about 1/25 
the wages of an American worker. Even accounting 
for transportation costs and the lower productivity of 
Chinese workers, it often made economic sense to shift 
production from the United States to China.
However, the advantage of Chinese manufacturing 
has eroded in recent years. Chinese wages are growing 
at nearly 20 percent per year and are now close to half 
of U.S. wages. American workers are about three times 
more productive than Chinese workers. Combine that 
with higher transportation costs as a result of higher oil 
prices, and some American companies are producing 
goods domestically solely on cost considerations.
As opposed to “offshoring,” some economists refer 
to “re-shoring” as the movement of manufacturing 
jobs from countries such as China back to the United 
States. For example, General Electric reversed a 2009 
decision to produce refrigerators in Asia, instead opt-
ing to refurbish a factory in Indiana. The company 
SolarWorld decided to manufacture solar panels at 
a plant in Oregon rather than in China, based on 
comparable overall costs and higher quality.
The scale of re-shoring is currently relatively low, 
and China still retains a cost advantage in most 
manufacturing industries. But a 2011 report by 
Boston Consulting Group, a management consult-
ing company, concludes that “by sometime around 
2015—for many goods destined for North American 
 consumers—manufacturing in some parts of the United 
States will be just as economical as manufacturing in 
China.” The report notes that some jobs in China will 
shift to countries with even lower labor costs, such as 
Vietnam and Indonesia, but these countries currently 
lack the infrastructure, worker skills, and quality assur-
ance needed for high-end manufacturing.
The potential for re-shoring can be increased 
through policies such as low-cost loans and subsi-
dies. President Barack Obama proposed tax breaks 
for companies keeping jobs in the United States in 
2012, but as of 2013 no legislation had been passed 
on this issue.

THE TERTIARY (SERVICE) SECTOR

into categories, as a way of getting a handle on this seemingly immaterial, yet enormously 
important part of our economy. The remainder of this section, however, is devoted to providing 
some basic data on the sector, with speciﬁc attention paid to the areas of retail, ﬁnancial and 
insurance services, and human services (including health and education).
Employment trends, wages, and other measures vary considerably across different service 
industries. For example, one common perception is that jobs in the service sector pay poorly. 
While this is true for such jobs as cashiers and child-care workers, it is clearly not true for such 
service jobs as doctors and lawyers. Overall, service jobs pay only slightly less on average 
than manufacturing jobs. In 2012 the average hourly wage in goods-producing industries 
was $24.91, while the average pay in the service industries was $23.46 per hour. At the same 
time, many jobs in ﬁnance have wages that far exceed most of those in manufacturing. From 
the 1940s to the early 1980s, average compensation in the ﬁnancial sector stayed close to the 
average for all domestic private industries (including manufacturing and industries in all three 
sectors). Starting in the early 1980s, it began to rise rapidly. By 2012, average compensation 
in the ﬁnancial sector was 25 percent higher than the nationwide average.
Traditionally, most international trade has involved the exchange of physical goods, but 
trade in services is now expanding rapidly. While it is easy to picture a physical good moving 
between countries, it might be harder to imagine how services could be internationally traded. 
A service is “exported” if agents in the United States provide a service used by an individual 
or organization based abroad. For example, if someone from Argentina stays in a U.S. hotel, 
this is considered an “export” of U.S.-produced accommodation services. 
A service is “imported” if agents in the foreign sector provide a service used by individuals 
or organizations based in the United States. For example, if a U.S. manufacturer ships its 
goods using freighters registered in Liberia, it is said to “import” transportation services from 
Liberia. Between 1980 and 2011, global trade in services increased by a factor of 10.7, while 
trade in goods increased by a factor of 8.7. By 2011 almost 19 percent of all international 
trade was in services. Improvements in information technology have made services such as 
customer call centers, software development, and data processing more easily transferable 
across national boundaries in recent years. The United Nations notes that cost savings of 
20–40 percent are commonly reported by companies that offshore their service needs to 
low-wage countries.
In 2011, the United States exported more in services than it imported, and this trade 
surplus has been expanding in the past several years. The principal services exported by the 
United States are travel, ﬁnancial, and educational services, while the main service imports 
are travel, telecommunications, and freight services.
4.1 RETAIL SERVICES
Few manufacturers sell their products directly to consumers. Instead, manufacturers typically 
sell their output to retailers, perhaps also using wholesalers as intermediaries. Retailers are 
categorized in the service sector because they normally do not manufacture any of the goods 
that they sell. Prominent retailers such as Walmart, Home Depot, and Target purchase virtually 
all their products from suppliers, in the United States and in other countries.
Retail services as a whole are not becoming a larger share of the national economy, but 
there is a clear trend toward the dominance of a small number of very large retailers. We 
can use data on concentration ratios to illustrate the ascendancy of these ﬁrms. A “four-ﬁrm 
concentration ratio” is calculated by dividing the domestic revenues of the four largest ﬁrms 
in an industry by the total domestic revenues in the industry. Figure 22.5 shows the change 
in the four-ﬁrm concentration ratios for several types of retailers between 1992 and 2007. 
Large retailers have come to dominate their industries by offering consumers a large number 
of choices and low prices. In the parlance of microeconomics, the retail industry is clearly 
oligopolistic, meaning that it is dominated by a small number of companies. However, the 

500 
CHAPTER 22 — THE STRUCTURE OF THE U.S. ECONOMY
economic scale of the largest retailers has become so large that the behavior of individual 
ﬁrms has implications at the macroeconomic level. In 2012 Walmart was the world’s largest 
retailer (and third-largest company) by revenue, with sales of $447 billion, and the world’s 
largest nongovernment employer, with 2.1 million employees.
Some researchers believe that a major reason that productivity increased so much in the 
United States in the late 1990s is a result of Walmart’s pressure on suppliers to increase their 
efﬁciency. As another example of Walmart’s pervasive reach, the decline of the American 
textiles industry can be attributed in part to Walmart’s foreign sourcing of low-priced apparel. 
Consider that an estimated 10 percent of Chinese imports to the United States are for Walmart. 
Economy-wide impacts like these blur traditional distinctions between microeconomics and 
macroeconomics and demand new lines of research and analysis.
4.2 FINANCE AND FINANCIALIZATION
The ﬁnancial, insurance, and real estate sectors are often lumped together. We give a brief 
overview of these sectors and then focus on the ﬁnancial sector, which has had a huge impact 
on the U.S. economy in recent years.
The most common job categories in this group of industries are bank tellers, loan ofﬁcers, 
real estate agents, and insurance agents. Combined, these sectors accounted for 20.3 percent 
of GDP in 2011 and collectively employed over seven million people (about 5 percent of 
the workforce). In 2009, 946 life insurance companies in the United States held almost $5 
trillion in assets, but there has been a signiﬁcant concentration of assets in recent years; in 
1990, there were more than twice as many insurance companies as at present, but collectively 
they held only $1.4 trillion in assets.
From 1947 to the present, the percentage of U.S. value added from ﬁnance and insurance has 
more than tripled, from 2.4 percent to 7.7 percent (Figure 22.6). In contrast, the contribution 
of real estate has only grown from 8.1 to 12.6 percent. It is interesting to note, however, that 
both categories have more or less plateaued since around 2000, reﬂecting the two recessions 
that the country has experienced since then. 
The area of most interest among such services today—because they are closely associated 
with the market dysfunctions implicated in the Great Recession—covers the ﬁnancial 
institutions that manage financial assets. Households, nonfinancial businesses, and

ratios in these retail industries 
have all increased since 1992.

governments hold about half the country’s ﬁnancial assets. The rest are held by ﬁnancial 
institutions, which include banks, credit unions, pension and retirement funds, mutual funds, 
securities brokers, and insurance companies. Financial institutions are divided into two types, 
according to the services that they provide (though many institutions now provide both types of 
services). Depository institutions, such as banks and credit unions, pay interest on deposits and 
then use the deposits to make loans. Nondepository institutions, such as insurance companies, 
pension funds, brokerage ﬁrms, and mutual fund companies, sell ﬁnancial products such 
as insurance or money management. They then invest their proﬁts in a variety of ﬁnancial 
assets. Pension funds, in particular, hold extensive ﬁnancial assets that they manage for the 
present and future beneﬁt of retirees and workers; thus in many countries, they are the largest 
investors, employing the services of a variety of ﬁnancial institutions.
Financial assets include stocks (shares in ownership of companies); bonds (certiﬁcates 
indicating that the holder has lent money to a government entity or a business, which will repay 
the loan over time, with interest); foreign currencies (held when the investor expects either 
that his own currency will depreciate or that a foreign currency will rise in relative value); 
certiﬁcates of deposit and money market accounts (specially designed savings accounts at 
banks, which pay higher interest than normal savings accounts, but generally place restrictions 
on withdrawals or set a minimum deposit level).
According to standard economic theory, the principal function of banks and other ﬁnancial 
institutions is to intermediate the movement of funds throughout the economy. When we say 
that ﬁnancial institutions are intermediaries, we mean that they move funds between savers 
and investors. For example, banks absorb savings (e.g., we deposit money in banks), and 
then they redirect these funds back into the economy in the form of loans that pay higher 
rates of interest, to cover the banks’ costs of operation and give them a proﬁt. When these 
loans are used to open new businesses or expand existing ones, resulting in increases in 
production and employment, intermediating institutions such as banks are helping the real 
economy to function. The “real economy” refers to the part of the economy that is concerned 
with actually producing goods and services, as opposed to the ﬁnancial side of the economy 
(sometimes called “the paper economy”), whose activities focus on buying and selling on 
the ﬁnancial markets.
Given that the primary role of the ﬁnancial sector is to facilitate activities in the real 
economy, there is no inherent reason to expect the ﬁnancial sector to grow signiﬁcantly over 
time relative to the size of the overall economy. Yet, as we have seen, the relative size of

markedly over the past half 
century, with the strongest

CHAPTER 22 — THE STRUCTURE OF THE U.S. ECONOMY
the ﬁnancial sector has increased considerably—and, indeed, is expected to continue to do 
so; a 2012 report by Bain and Company projected that by 2020 there will be a global total 
of $900 trillion in ﬁnancial assets, while GDP in real economies will only total $90 trillion. 
How did this happen? The explanation is complex and multidimensional and is considered 
further in Chapter 26 and, especially, Chapter 30. At this point, consider an image that may 
help you to visualize the situation.
Imagine that the ﬁnancial sector is a hot air balloon; the basket tethered beneath it the real 
economy (or at least that part of the real economy that is related to, and uses the services 
of, the ﬁnancial sector). The relationship is essential for the ﬁnancial sector: without such a 
relationship, it would just ﬂoat up into the sky, without any substance. It also has value for 
the real economy: It gives the economy a “lift” by allocating savings to useful investments. 
However, since about 1982 a process of ﬁnancialization has allowed the balloon to inﬂate 
more and more. Less and less of its connection to what is going on in the real economy has to 
do with the traditional circulation of ﬁnancial capital: from production, through savings, then 
back to production of real-world goods and services. Instead, the connection is increasingly 
about the expansion of ﬁnancial claims within the balloon, including “bubbles” of temporary 
inﬂation in the prices that people are willing to pay for ﬁnancial assets, as well as the creation 
of large amounts of debt.
This can generate huge incomes for a small group of people. Part of this income is spent in 
the real economy, paying for luxury cars, McMansions, and the services of personal trainers 
and celebrity chefs, but much of it feeds back into the expansion inside the balloon.
The simplest way of understanding the ﬁnancialization that has affected the U.S. economy, 
as well as other advanced economies in recent decades is as a combination of two things: (1) 
huge increases in debt throughout the economy, along with (2) inﬂation in the price of assets, 
unconnected with any inﬂation in the price of real goods and services. This is what occurred 
in the period 1980–2007, when both asset prices and debt levels throughout the economy 
ballooned relative to incomes.
To give some examples on the debt side:

Mortgage loans represent a large portion of consumer indebtedness; during the housing 
bubble that led up to the ﬁnancial crisis, new mortgages were being issued at unprecedented 
rates. Total debt in all sectors of the economy, measured relative to GDP, increased to historic 
levels before the Great Recession, as shown in Figure 22.7. Particularly dramatic was the 
increase in debt among ﬁnancial businesses, which increased from just a few percent of GDP 
IN THE S TO  PERCENT OF '$0 IN  Debt levels have moderated in recent years, since the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008. Many 
households have substituted debt reduction for new spending. As discussed in Chapters 23 
and 30, slow growth in wages and declining household income played an important role in 
the credit boom, as consumers compensated for limited incomes by relying on credit cards 
and other loans to extend their ability to continue spending.
The ﬁnancial economy, as we will see in Chapter 30, found ways to use household debt, 
especially mortgages, as collateral to expand its own activity, while regulatory easing and the 
rise of new kinds of ﬁnancial institutions made it possible for money to be lent out with very 
little collateral. (“Collateral” is a valuable asset used as a basis for a loan.) A wide variety of

ﬁnancial ﬁrms entered the game of taking in funds and then turning them around to invest 
in high-yield assets.
Financial ﬁrms may sell stock (shares in the company) to raise capital, but in recent years 
borrowing became a more popular way to increase the funds held by a ﬁnancial ﬁrm. The higher 
the ratio of borrowed funds to funds contributed by stockholders, the greater a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial 
leverage. Leverage essentially means using borrowed money to increase the investment power 
of one’s own money, and it can be touted as high “return on investment” (ROI), because the 
return can be calculated without factoring in the borrowed funds that are involved. With a 
large cushion of borrowed funds, a ﬁnancial institution could, for example, hold $1 million 
as collateral while lending out $25 million. These loans could go to other institutions, which, 
in turn, held back a few percent and lent out the rest. Such loans are described as “highly 
leveraged” ($1 million can leverage $25 million or more). This possibility made it appealing 
for banks and other ﬁnancial institutions to keep borrowing more money in order to have 
a greater stake in other investments. However, it also created signiﬁcant risks: If a ﬁrm is 
leveraged 25-fold, then a loss of just over 4 percent will be sufﬁcient to bankrupt it.
Financialization really takes hold when the loans themselves are increasingly viewed 
as desirable investments. This leads to a situation in which much of the ﬁnancial sector is 
leveraging itself to invest in ﬁnancial assets that are themselves different types of loans, and 
increasingly these loans are bundled into other complex ﬁnancial instruments. To repeat a 
saying that is popular in the sector, “Finance mostly ﬁnances ﬁnance.”* The relative size of 
the ﬁnancial economy increases as companies substitute this type of ﬁnancial investing for 
“real” investment (i.e., purchasing of ﬁxed assets like machines or computers).
As noted above, the two sources of hot air for the ﬁnancialization balloon are debt and asset 
price inﬂation. In real markets, the price of a good or a service comes from an intersection 
of several considerations, including the cost of supplying it and how willing and able people 
are to pay for it. In ﬁnancial markets, the cost of supply is often nothing more than the time 
and inventiveness of the manager who invents or promotes a ﬁnancial asset that most people 
do not understand (and are most often not intended to understand). These assets can, at least 
for a while, be extremely proﬁtable, hence the very large salaries received by the people

1983 and rose to more than triple that level by 2009.*
If the cost of production in the ﬁnancial sector is different from the supply side in the 
real economy, the demand side of the ﬁnancial economy is even more different. Financial 
markets do not operate like markets for real goods and services, in which an increase in the 
price of a good tends to depress demand. In ﬁnancial markets, instead, an increase in the 
price of an asset can spur people to borrow more, which in turn causes prices to rise further. 
The value of an asset is what you think someone else is willing to pay for it. Whether the 
asset is a tulip bulb (as in the bizarre incident of tulip mania in the seventeenth century) 
or a piece of real estate, or some complex bundle of derivatives, as long as the balloon is 
inﬂating, the prospective buyer of an asset may pay a price that bears no relation to anything 
on the ground, as long as he or she believes that the price will keep going up, and the next 
buyer will be willing to pay still more.** When the speculative fever breaks, prices can 
decline even more rapidly—the ﬁnancial “bubble” bursts, with bad consequences for the 
real economy.
The process of ﬁnancialization has affected stock markets throughout the world. Average 
holding times for stocks has fallen as large ﬁnancial institutions engage in rapid trading of 
stocks in search of short-term gains. Investors on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) 
held stocks for an average period of about ﬁve years in 1975, two years in 1991, but only 
ﬁve months in 2008.3 This is in contrast to an approach which focuses on the ability of a 
business to generate revenues and generally involves holding stocks for longer periods. 
Short-term investing makes markets more vulnerable to “bubbles,” when investors 
looking for a quick proﬁt drive stock prices to excessive heights, leading to a subsequent  
crash.
The stock market, however, plays a relatively small role in ﬁnancing investment in the real 
world. The majority of transactions in the stock market consist of investors transacting with 
other investors, while a relatively small proportion of stock purchases actually ﬁnance new 
investments in productive activities. Genuinely new activities, such as start-up businesses, 
tend to be ﬁnanced through “angel” investors who have personal knowledge of the business; 
in the case of many small business start-ups the initial funding very often comes from family 
and friends. Once a new business has begun to have a track record, the next stage of ﬁnancing 
is likely to come from venture capitalists (also outside of the public stock markets), who

Economic Policy Institute, Brieﬁng Paper #331, 2011.
**Derivatives are ﬁnancial instruments whose value is “derived” from the value of another, underlying asset. For 
example, an option to purchase a stock is a derivative whose value is based on potential changes in the value of the 
underlying stock.

 
THE TERTIARY (SERVICE) SECTOR

spend their working lives scrutinizing new businesses and investing in a number of them, 
with the understanding that many will fail, but with the hope that a few will make it big. 
Finally, when a business is considered mature enough to go public, the venture capitalists 
and the CEO will agree on the best time to make an initial public offering (IPO). This is the 
main opportunity for funds invested through the stock market to make a real difference in 
business activity.
In contrast, established corporations do not depend on the stock market as much as is 
generally thought when they decide to invest in new or expanded activities. Most of the 
major corporations of today have accumulated large pools of retained earnings which 
they can invest in new activities. Indeed, since the 1980s, corporations have actually 
spent more on buying back their own stock than they have taken in by selling newly 
issued stock.
4.3 HUMAN SERVICES: HEALTH
We now return to the real-world portion of the tertiary sector within the macroeconomy, 
with a consideration of human services. Human services include education, health care, 
social work, and child care. These services can be provided by private businesses, non-
proﬁt organizations, or governments. A major difference between the United States and 
other developed countries is that human services in the United States are less likely to be 
provided by the public sector. Perhaps the most vivid example of this difference is with 
respect to health care.
Health care is one of the fastest-growing industries in the United States. In 2013 about 
13 percent of the country’s workers were employed in the health-care sector. As shown in 
Figure 22.8, national health-care expenditures grew from about 5 percent of GDP in 1960 to 
17 percent of GDP in 2011. Out-of-pocket costs (the amounts paid by individuals for health 
care, including payments by those without insurance and co-pays and other expenses by those 
with insurance) have remained relatively constant over the years, but both private insurance 
and public costs have risen considerably. In 2011 annual per capita spending on health care 
in the United States was about $8,700. Health-care costs are expected to increase further 
and become an even greater share of GDP, as the population ages and medical technology 
continues to become more sophisticated.
While the share of health expenditures by the public sector has increased in recent decades, 
public funding of health care in the United States is much smaller as a share of total health-
care costs than in any other developed country. In 2008, public funding paid for 46 percent 
of health-care costs in the United States, while in other industrialized countries it ranged 
from 66 to 87 percent.

CHAPTER 22 — THE STRUCTURE OF THE U.S. ECONOMY
The dominance of private markets for health care in the United States has not kept health-care 
spending or costs low. In fact, a higher share of GDP is spent on health care in the United States 
than in any other developed country. While in the United States health care accounts for about 
17 percent of GDP, in France health care represents 11 percent, in Canada 10 percent, and in 
Sweden and the United Kingdom 9 percent. (See Chapter 0 for more comparisons.) Also, in the 
United States prices are rising much more rapidly in health care than overall: Between 2000 and 
2010, the consumer price index for medical care rose 48 percent while the overall price index 
only rose 26 percent. The cost of health insurance premiums is rising at an even faster rate.
Given that these expenditures are so high in the United States, is the quality of health care 
higher than in other developed countries? Using several common measures of national health, 
as shown in Chapter 0, the United States actually ranks lower than most other developed 
countries. This country has a relatively low number of physicians per capita and a lower-than-
average rate of childhood immunization. Average life spans are shorter than in most other 
developed countries, and infant mortality rates are slightly above the norm.
Unlike all other developed countries, the United States does not have publicly funded 
universal health-care coverage. For those with adequate coverage through private insurance, 
most often provided by employers, the United States offers some of the highest-quality 
medical care in the world. But about 16 percent of Americans lacked any health insurance in 
2011, a proportion that has generally been increasing in recent years. In an attempt to expand 
health-care coverage, improve quality, and control costs, in 2010 Congress passed the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, which could possibly 
reverse this trend, although this depends on its effective implementation. See Box 22.3 for 
more on this law.
BOX 22.3 THE 2010 AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
The passage of “Obamacare” in 2010 marked the most 
signiﬁcant change to the American health care system 
in decades. The law will be phased in over the period 
2010–20. Some of its main provisions include:
UÊ Êº`Û`Õ>Ê>`>Ìi»ÊÌ>ÌÊÀiµÕÀiÃÊ`Û`Õ-
als to obtain health insurance by 2014 or pay 
a penalty. Individuals and families below the 
federal poverty line currently can receive free 
health care through Medicaid, and thus will not 
need to purchase private insurance. Individuals 
between 100 percent and 400 percent of the 
poverty line will be able to obtain subsidized 
coverage, based on a sliding scale.
UÊ /iÊ>ÜÊÃiÌÃÊ>ÝÕÊÃÕÀ>ViÊ«ÀiÕÊÀ>ÌiÃÊ
for individuals and families making up to 400 
percent of the poverty line. For example, an 
individual making 150 percent of the poverty 
line cannot pay more than 4 percent of his or 
her income in premiums.

cent tax on individuals making more than 
$200,000 per year (or couples making more 
than $250,000). The funds from the tax will 
be used to subsidize health care coverage for 
low-income individuals and pay for other costs 
of the law.

provide health care coverage or pay a fee if the 
government has to subsidize their  employees’ 
health care. Smaller ﬁrms that offer health 
insurance may qualify for subsidies.
The Congressional Budget Ofﬁce (CBO) conducted 
a comprehensive analysis of the law in 2011, predicting 
that about 34 million more Americans will have health 
care coverage in 2021 as a result of it. While the CBO 
estimates the gross costs of the law to be $1.4 trillion 
over the period 2012–21, these costs will be more than 
offset by additional revenues and Medicare and other 
savings. Thus the CBO estimates that the law will actu-
ally reduce the federal deﬁcit by about $200 billion.

THE TERTIARY (SERVICE) SECTOR 
507
4.4 HUMAN SERVICES: EDUCATION
The situation with respect to education in the United States in many ways mirrors that of health 
care. The quality of education in the United States can be excellent, which draws many foreigners 
to come there for higher education. About 20 percent of graduate students in the United States 
are foreign born. Spending per student in the United States on elementary and secondary educa-
tion is signiﬁcantly higher than the average among members of the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) (only Switzerland and Luxembourg spend more), and 
the United States spends more per student than any other country on postsecondary education. 
However, the performance of American students is only mediocre by international standards. 
In a standardized test given in 2009 to 15-year-old students in 74 countries with varying levels 
of economic development, U.S. students ranked thirty-ﬁrst in math, seventeenth in reading, and 
twenty-third in science. (See Chapter 0 for additional comparisons.)
In section 6.2, we discussed the ballooning of debt in the U.S. economy. The cost of education 
has played a role in this. Between 2002 and 2012, the cost of attending a public four-year 
institution increased by 68 percent, much more rapidly than overall inﬂation, which rose 27 
percent during the same period. Meanwhile, real median household income was falling. 
While federal college education grants have increased, particularly since 2008, the majority 
of federal education assistance now comes in the form of loans. Although those who have 
trouble paying back federal student loans can apply for assistance programs, students who 
take out loans from private companies tend to face higher interest rates and less ﬂexible 
conditions. According to the Pew Research Center, the debt on student loans eats up 24 
percent of household incomes for the lowest-income families.
Both public and private institutions provide education in the United States. Education services 
employed slightly more than 2 percent of workers in 2010. About 75 million students are enrolled 
in American schools at all grade levels, and about 85 percent are in public schools. Among people 
25 and older in the United States in 2010, 87 percent are high school graduates and 30 percent 
have college degrees. Educational attainment differs by race and gender. For example, while 30 
percent of whites had a college degree in 2010, only 20 percent of blacks and 14 percent of those 
of Hispanic origin had completed college. Although males are more likely than females to have 
a college degree (30 percent vs. 29 percent), more females are enrolled in college than males. For 
the ﬁrst time, in 2009 women earned more graduate degrees than men in the United States.
4.5 CONCLUDING THOUGHTS 
This chapter has provided a bird’s-eye view of the U.S. economy. We have looked at primary 
sector activities that provide the raw materials on which everything else depends, noting that 
the importance of these activities is belied by the small percentage of GDP devoted to them. 
We have looked at secondary-sector activities that process physical materials, turning them 
into goods for sale. And we have looked at the tertiary sector, which accounts for about three-
quarters of the economic activity in the United States.
The “marketed” section of the economy, on which we have concentrated here, is not the 
whole picture. Seemingly inherent in our economic system is a drive to ﬁnd ever more ways 
to replace what we do for ourselves with marketed services or products. The replacement of 
much home cooking with fast food, take-out, and rapid meal delivery is a prime example. 
Still, the services that people provide as friends, neighbors, family members, and citizens 
continue to be a large part of the economy, though unmeasured by ﬂows of money and therefore 
missing from GDP. Recall from Chapter 21 that even the most conservative estimates of the 
total value of household production are 25–30 percent of standard GDP in the United States. 
In a more fully accounted economy, covering the core as well as the business and public-
purpose spheres, the tertiary sector would still loom very large—much of the (non-monetized) 
economic activity in the core sphere is services—but its expansion would be largely in the 
areas of “private social services” and “entertainment.”

508 
CHAPTER 22 — THE STRUCTURE OF THE U.S. ECONOMY
As we continue our analysis of the macroeconomy, we will focus primarily on the portion of 
the economy that is measured by standard GDP. We will be concerned primarily with aggregate 
ﬁgures, concentrating for example on total consumption, total investment, and total government 
spending. The material covered in this chapter, as well as in the preceding two, may help us to bear 
in mind the realities that lie behind the abstractions that are necessary to develop macroeconomic 
theory. Before delving into that theory, we need to review one other important area of the real 
economy—employment and unemployment—the topic of the next chapter. 
Discussion Questions
1. Economic theory suggests that goods and services provided in competitive markets by 
private enterprises will result in lower prices. But we have learned that health-care costs 
in the United States actually are the highest in the world, although Americans do not bet-
ter have health outcomes than people in countries that provide public health care. How 
would you explain this result? Do you think that the Affordable Care Act will improve 
the situation? If not, what alternative solution would you suggest?
2. Try to estimate what share of your total expenditures is on products from the primary, 
secondary, and tertiary sectors. How do you think your expenditure patterns will change 
in the future? For example, assuming that your income rises after you graduate, do you 
think that your share of expenditures on services will increase or decrease?
 1. List and deﬁne the three major sectors of the U.S. 
economy, as discussed in this chapter.
 2. Approximately what percentage of the U.S. GDP 
is produced in each of the three sectors? How has 
this allocation changed over time?
 3. How do “technological optimists” view the debate 
about natural resource constraints?
 4. What are some of the potential future natural re-
source constraints on economic activity?
 5. Summarize how agriculture in the United States has 
changed over the past century. About how much of 
each dollar spent on food currently goes to farmers?
 6. Does the declining share of the primary sector imply 
that it is becoming less important?
 7. What is the largest source of energy in the United 
States?
 8. Why does the number of new housing starts in the 
United States show a cyclical pattern?
 9. Contrast the recent history of the American textile 
and automobile industries.
10. Are some politicians correct when they say that Ameri-
can manufacturing jobs have been shifted overseas?
11. Is the service sector synonymous with low-paying 
jobs?
12. What is meant by “ﬁnancialization”? What data 
suggest the United States has become more ﬁnan-
cialized in recent years?

APPENDIX
A1. THE TERTIARY SECTOR IN THE OVERALL MACRO CONTEXT
Figure 22.9 is a depiction of the private (non governmental) U.S. economy that we have as-
sembled to take a closer look at the tertiary sector. It starts from the value-added approach 
to national accounting that was used for Table 22.1. This approach, as you may remember 
from Chapter 20, includes intermediate inputs such as wholesale and retail trade, as well as 
management of companies and enterprises. The primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors of 
the economy are shown in Figure 22.9 at somewhat higher proportions than those given in 
Table 22.1 because of exclusion of the government sector.
Figure 22.9 then illustrates one potential way to further categorize the tertiary sector. 
These divisions are the authors’ classiﬁcation and do not represent any ofﬁcial government 
classiﬁcation scheme. The four divisions presented in the ﬁgure are explained below.
We will identify the largest category of the tertiary activities in GDP as “Ownership 
Transactions,” which includes 31.3 percent of private GDP. About thirteen percentage points 
of this category represents the imputed value, to each homeowner, of the ongoing value 
of being able to live in that house. The remainder—about 18 percent of private GDP—is 
essentially about buying and selling, covering activities that transfer ownership of goods and 
services from producers to buyers, or from previous owners to new owners. This includes 
transportation and warehousing, wholesale and retail trade, and real-estate rental and leasing 
(aside from the above-mentioned imputed value of homeownership).

510 
CHAPTER 22 — THE STRUCTURE OF THE U.S. ECONOMY
Transportation and transportation-related activities that allow people in a modern society to 
acquire items that were not produced locally are an important part of “ownership transactions.” 
They make it possible for you to enjoy fruits and vegetables when they are out of season 
where you live, goods that are not produced in your area, and goods that you can purchase 
more cheaply because they were produced in other parts of the country—or, more often, of 
the world—where the cost is lower (leaving aside, for the moment, feelings that you may 
have about the variety of reasons that production costs for certain goods are lower in some 
places than in others).
Another signiﬁcant portion of the value added in this category may be traced to “the 
middleman”—the person or organization that facilitates the transaction between the ﬁnal buyer 
and the original producer or between the previous owner and the next one (as is often the case 
with stocks and bonds, real estate, ﬁne arts, and other things that tend to have a sequence of 
owners). It is sometimes said that a way to lower prices without hurting producers is to “get 
rid of the middleman,” that is, to ﬁnd a way to put the end user directly in contact with the 
producer. Perhaps more of this will happen over time, via the Internet. In the meantime, in 
an advanced economy in which there is a huge amount of choice, for buyers, among objects 
that can come from anywhere in the world, it is not surprising that a signiﬁcant portion of 
GDP should be devoted to making these connections.
The next largest category, “Managing the System,” covers the marketed services that 
keep the economic system going. These include information, ﬁnance and insurance, and 
professional, scientiﬁc, and technical services.* This category also includes the activities 
that the Census Bureau calls administrative and waste management and management of 
companies and enterprises.
This category is about the organization and management of a hugely complex system—or, 
more accurately, a set of systems. Our society has come a long way from the relatively simple 
economies that we described early in this chapter, when discussing how the secondary sector 
grew relative to the primary sector. Firms are more numerous; large (and enormous) ﬁrms are 
*A major part of the ﬁnance industry is the buying and selling of paper or electronic claims to ownership of productive 
resources, such as stocks. The ﬁnancial advisers, investment companies, and other money managers whose salaries, bonuses, 
and so on are represented as “ﬁnance” in “Managing the System” are sometimes selling the right to own a piece of a new 
company; more often, they are reselling previously owned stocks and bonds. If we could readily identify these activities, 
perhaps it would be appropriate to move them to the category “Ownership Transactions.”
Figure 22.9 Classiﬁcation of Private GDP in the United States, 2011
The production of services, 
accounting for over three-quarters 
of private GDP in the United 
States, can be best understood if 
broken down into several additional 
categories.

more numerous; and there is much organization and management to be done in negotiating 
the networks of relations inside these ﬁrms and among them. Governments do some of this 
organization and management, and they, in turn, along with the ﬁrms, need many kinds of 
support. Many individuals and families, too, have resources that they can use to purchase 
support for the complexities of operating in an industrialized world. The kinds of support 
that individuals and organizations want and can pay for include insurance and advice about 
insurance, as well as advice and assistance with the management and operation of technologies, 
from automobile repair to computer hardware and software.
“Private Social Services” (within the tertiary sector) covers only those portions of 
education, health care, and social assistance that are not covered by government; they do 
not cover the cost of materials (such as medical supplies) that would show up as products 
of the secondary sector. 
The category “Entertainment” is partially about “what we do for fun”; it covers services 
sold in relation to arts, entertainment and recreation, and accommodation and food services. 
Thus, for example, it comprises wages for musicians but not the sale price of a new painting 
(accounted as a secondary-sector product); it covers payments for movie tickets and wages for 
hotel and restaurant personnel as well as the people working in retail and wholesale who sell 
DVDs or food but not the materials or manufacturing cost of DVDs or of food (whose value 
is divided between the primary and secondary sectors). A signiﬁcant portion of this category 
is also work related, including business lunches and accommodations for business trips.
A2: HISTORICAL TRENDS AND GLOBAL COMPARISONS
The relative shares of the three output sectors in GDP have changed over time in the United 
States. Figure 22.10 shows the share of the U.S. private economy (excluding government) at-
tributed to each of the three output sectors since 1800. Perhaps the most surprising conclusion 
from the graph is that the tertiary sector has always comprised the largest share of economic 
production in the United States, even in 1800. The tertiary share of GDP held steady at around 
50 percent from 1800 until about 1950, then steadily climbed to its current share of about 75 
percent. The secondary sector’s share of GDP tended to increase from 1800 to about 1950 but 
has decreased since then. Finally, the primary sector’s share of GDP was about 40 percent in 
1800 but has since declined to its current share of about 3 percent of GDP.
The sectoral distribution of economic production in several other countries is given in Table 
22.3. The classiﬁcation of output sectors in the table, based on data from the World Bank, 
is slightly different from the deﬁnitions given above. The World Bank deﬁnes agriculture as 
its own output sector. The World Bank’s “industrial” sector includes the secondary sector as 
deﬁned above, but adds ﬁshing, forestry, and mining output. The tertiary sector is unchanged, 
including all services.
As in the United States, the tertiary sector also comprises at least 70 percent of economic 
production in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Japan, and Germany. Norway is an example of a 
developed country with a relatively large share of GDP, over 40 percent, from the secondary 
sector. The secondary sector is the dominant share of GDP in several countries, including 
China, Saudi Arabia (because oil production is classiﬁed as “industrial”), Indonesia, and the 
Republic of the Congo (also heavily dependent on oil production). The agricultural sector is 
the largest sector only in a handful of lower-income countries, including Ethiopia. Even in 
most developing countries, the tertiary sector is the dominant output sector.
The sectoral data for different countries indicate that economic development is commonly 
associated with a declining share of GDP from agriculture. Economic growth in most countries 
is associated with a signiﬁcant increase in the relative share of manufacturing, but this is 
not universally true. Some countries, such as Hong Kong, Bermuda, and Singapore, have 
achieved income growth by primarily expanding the service sector. We consider these and 
other issues of economic development in more detail in Chapter 32.

23 Employment, Unemployment,  
and Wages
As discussed in Chapter 1, a primary goal of the economy is to support a good standard of 
living.* This normally involves making it possible for people to gain the income needed 
to purchase goods and services. Nonmarket factors such as household production, publicly 
produced goods and services, leisure time, and a healthy environment, play an important 
role in determining living standards, but for most people in developed economies income 
from work is the main factor needed to support individuals and families. In this chapter we 
focus on paid employment, and on levels of employment and unemployment in the economy 
as a whole. 
The second macroeconomic goal that we cited was stability and security. Unemployment 
can be a major threat to people’s stability and security. This chapter focuses speciﬁcally on 
understanding the phenomenon of unemployment. Later chapters consider the macroeconomic 
conditions that affect unemployment levels.
The third macroeconomic goal is to sustain and restore the various forms of capital that 
are essential for future as well as present well-being. This chapter discusses the ways in 
which the availability of natural and manufactured capital, in particular, is relevant for future 
employment and income.
What does all of this mean for your future? Do you, for example, feel that your future work 
experience will be similar to that of your parents? During some periods in history, expectations 
of work remained stable for decades. But expectations have changed—according to a 2012 
survey in the United States, only 14 percent of respondents believe that today’s children will 
be better off than their parents.1
There are many reasons for this sense of turbulence and change, including the globalization 
of markets, the increasing scale and concentration of many businesses, changing relations 
between states and corporations, the information revolution and other rapid changes in 
technology, and the impact of the Great Recession (the recession of 2007–9, so named because 
of its severity and lasting impact). This chapter and subsequent chapters will explore what 
macroeconomics can tell us about how these and other forces are affecting the nature of 
employment, the levels and impacts of unemployment, and the longer-term future of work 
and incomes.
1. EMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT
We have seen in previous chapters how ofﬁcial data are used to draw a macro portrait of the 
U.S. economy—and how these data may emphasize some aspects (especially the economic 
*The terms “standard of living” and “well-being” are often used interchangeably, but there is a distinction. “Standard of 
living” refers to the tangible aspects of one’s life, while “well-being” refers to the overall state of one’s life, including social 
and psychological aspects as well as tangible aspects.

514 
CHAPTER 23 — EMPLOYMENT, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND WAGES
activities that involve markets) and ignore or downplay others. We start this chapter with a 
similar look at the ofﬁcial data on work issues. These data do not cover everything that we 
might want to know, but it is important to know how to read the ofﬁcial data and what they 
can tell us.
1.1 MEASURING EMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT
Every month, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) interviews about 60,000 households, 
asking whether individual household members have jobs or are looking for work. In addi-
tion to conducting this household survey, it collects data every month from nearly 400,000 
employers. Based on these two surveys, the BLS publishes monthly data on work issues, 
including the ofﬁcial unemployment rate.
If you live in a U.S. household, someday you may get a telephone call from a BLS interviewer. 
After a few preliminaries he or she will ask you the questions shown in Box A of Figure 23.1. If 
you can answer “no” to all these questions, you are part of the civilian, noninstitutionalized, age 
sixteen and over population about which this survey gathers data, and the interviewer will ask 
you questions about employment. If you answer “yes” to any question in Box A, the interviewer 
will not ask you about employment. Ofﬁcial employment and unemployment statistics do not 
include you. Trends in employment statistics over time, then, need to be analyzed in the light 
of considerations such as changes in age demographics, military policy, and rates of disability 
and incarceration. (See Box 23.1, for more on incarceration in the United States.)
If you are part of the surveyed population, then you will be asked the questions in Box B of 
Figure 23.1, starting with: “Last week, did you do any work for pay or proﬁt?” Anyone who 
answers “yes” will be classiﬁed as employed. If you did any paid work last week—even if you 
worked for only an hour or two at a casual job—the interviewer will code you as “employed.” 
If you answer “no,” then you will be asked more questions. For example, if you have a paid 
job but just did not happen to put in any hours last week because you were sick, on vacation, 
or on certain kinds of leave, you will be coded as working and “employed.” Also, if you did 
unpaid work in a family-run business, such as a retail store or farm, you will be classiﬁed as 
“employed” as long as you worked for more than ﬁfteen hours a week.

work for pay or proﬁt 
during the week 
before he or she is 
surveyed by the BLS 
or who worked for 
ﬁfteen hours or more 
in a family business

 
EMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT 
515
Note that the “family business” situation is the only case in which unpaid work currently 
counts as being employed in the ofﬁcial statistics. If you work fewer than 15 hours in your 
family business, or are, for example, occupied with caring for your children or other family 
members or doing community volunteer work, you will not be considered “employed.” 
Terms such as “labor,” “work,” and “employment” in ofﬁcial statistics generally refer only 
to paid work.
If your answers to the household survey do not result in your being classiﬁed as “employed,” 
you will be asked the questions about job search and availability shown in Box C of Figure 
23.1. Activities such as contacting employers and sending out résumés count as an “active” job 
search. Merely participating in a job-training program or reading employment ads do not. The 
question about whether you could start a job concerns whether, in fact, you are available for 
work. If, for example, you are a college student searching during spring break for a summer job, 
but you are not available to start the job until June, you would answer “no” to the availability 
question. If you can answer “yes” to both these questions you are classiﬁed as unemployed.
If you are either employed or unemployed, the BLS classiﬁes you as part of the labor 
force. But what if you are neither “employed” nor “unemployed”—if you do not have a job 
but are not actively seeking one? Then you are classiﬁed as “not in the labor force.” People 
in this category are often taking care of a home and family, in school, disabled, or retired.
Notice, in Figure 23.1, that the vast majority of U.S. residents who are not “employed” 
either are “not in the labor force” (about 89.3 million) or are not part of the surveyed 
population (about 70.7 million). The latter group includes children under 16, and person 
who are institutionalized. In comparison, about 12.0 million people in February 2013 were 
formally counted as “unemployed.” (Figures are updated monthly at www.bls.gov.)
BOX 23.1 INCARCERATION IN THE UNITED STATES
Not only does the United States incarcerate more 
individuals than any other country in the world but 
it also has the world’s highest incarceration rate. In 
2011 the United States prison population was about 
2.2 million people, or one in every 140 people in the 
country. This is about seven times the incarceration 
rate of most other developed countries.
The U.S. prison population has increased dra-
matically in the past few decades. In 1980 only about 
500,000 people were incarcerated in the United 
States. Given that violent and property crimes actu-
ally decreased between 1980 and 2011, why has the 
prison population risen so much?
Much of the increase is a result of the “war on 
drugs,” which mandated long prison sentences for 
drug offenses, including nonviolent crimes such as 
drug possession. A 2010 report looks at the cost of 
incarcerating so many people:
The ﬁnancial costs of our corrections policies are 
staggering. In 2008, federal, state, and local gov-
ernments spent about $75 billion on corrections. 
. . . Reducing the number of non-violent offenders 
in our prisons and jails by half would lower this bill 
by $16.9 billion per year, with the largest share 
of these savings accruing to ﬁnancially squeezed 
state and local governments. Every indication is 
that these savings could be achieved without any 
appreciable deterioration in public safety. (Schmitt, 
2010, p. 2)
The high U.S. prison population has implications 
for the unemployment rate. Many people currently in 
prison would otherwise be unemployed. According to 
one estimate, the U.S. unemployment rate would be 
about two percentage points higher if prisoners were 
counted. In 2013, a number of bills were introduced in 
the U.S. Congress proposing sentencing reform, which 
if passed might reduce the prison population.

CHAPTER 23 — EMPLOYMENT, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND WAGES
1.2 THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE
Every month, having made estimates, based on the survey responses, of the total number of 
employed and unemployed people in the country, the BLS calculates the ofﬁcial unemploy-
ment rate. This follows the formula:
unemployment rate
number of people unemployed
number of peo
=
ple in the labor force ×100
For example, in February 2013, looking at Figure 23.1 you can see that the BLS estimated 
that 143.5 million people were employed and 12.0 million people were unemployed. The 
unemployment rate was thus calculated as 7.7 percent:
unemployment rate = 
12.0 million
 100 = 7.7
155.5 million
The unemployment rate represents the fraction of the ofﬁcially deﬁned labor force that is 
made up of people who are not currently working at paid jobs but are currently looking for 
and available for paid work.
The unemployment rate reported in the media is often “seasonally adjusted.” Over the 
course of a year, some swings in unemployment are fairly predictable. For example, agriculture 
and construction tend to employ fewer people in the cold winter months, and each year many 
students enter the labor force in May and June after graduation. The BLS releases “seasonally 
adjusted” ﬁgures that attempt to reﬂect only shifts in unemployment that are due to factors 
other than such seasonal patterns.
The BLS also estimates unemployment rates for various demographic groups, occupations, 
industries, and geographical areas. Historically, unemployment rates have generally been 
substantially higher for minority populations than for whites, for teenagers than for older 
people, and for less educated people than for the more educated. Unemployment rates often 
have differed somewhat by gender, though not with any consistent pattern. Some representative 
unemployment rates are given in Table 23.1.

EMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT 
517
Discouraged Workers and Underemployment
The fact that some people “not in the labor force” might want jobs but have given up looking 
for them has long troubled employment analysts. To the extent that people give up looking, 
the ofﬁcial unemployment rate underestimates people’s need and desire for paid jobs.
In recent years, the BLS has added questions to the survey to try to determine how many 
people in the “not in the labor force” population may want employment, even if they are not 
currently searching for work. If someone says that he or she is available for work, wants to 
work, and has looked for work in the past 12 months but not in the past 4 weeks, the BLS 
calls them “marginally attached workers.” In February 2013 marginally attached workers 
numbered 2.6 million.
If these marginally attached workers also say that the reason they are no longer looking is 
that they believe there are no jobs out there for them, they are called discouraged workers. 
They may have become discouraged because their skills do not match available openings, 
because they have experienced discrimination, or because they have been turned away 
time after time. In February 2013 the number of discouraged workers in the United States 
was estimated at about 900,000. Marginally attached workers who are not discouraged 
workers typically have not looked for work recently because of school attendance or family 
responsibilities.
Let’s also take a closer look at the people classiﬁed as “employed.” In the BLS statistics, 
people are counted as “employed” if they do any paid work at all during the reference week, 
even if only for an hour or two. Some people prefer part-time work, of course, because of the 
time it leaves them for other activities, such as schooling or family care. Some are limited 
to part-time work for health reasons. But others want and need full-time work and are only 
settling for part-time work until they can ﬁnd something better. The household survey asks 
people who work part time about their reasons for doing so. 
In February 2013, 18.9 million people reported working less than 35 hours per week for 
“noneconomic” reasons such as health or family responsibilities. In the same month, an 
additional 8.0 million people reported working part time for what the BLS calls “economic 
reasons”—that is, slack business conditions or because part-time work was all they could 
ﬁnd (see Box 23.2).
What indicator, then, should we look at to see whether the national employment situation 
is “bad” or “good”? The BLS now publishes various measures of labor underutilization that 
allow you to see the situation from a variety of different perspectives. For example, if the 
marginally attached workers and people who work part time involuntarily are added to the 
marginally at-
tached workers: 
people who want 
employment and 
have looked for work 
in the past twelve 
months but not in the 
past four weeks
discouraged work-
ers: people who 
want employment but 
have given up looking 
because they believe 
that there are no jobs 
available for them
BOX 23.2 MANY PART-TIME WORKERS WANT FULL-TIME WORK
By March 2013, the U.S. economy had generated 
thirty straight months of job growth. “But for millions 
of people looking for more work and greater income, 
that improvement provided little solace. 7.6 million 
Americans were stuck in part-time jobs, about the 
same as a year earlier.” These underemployed work-
ers did not count towards the ofﬁcial jobless rate of 
7.6 percent in March.
“There’s nothing inherently wrong with people 
taking part-time jobs if they want them,” said Diane 
Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial. “The 
problem is that people are accepting part-time pay 
because they have no other choice.” 
The rise in part-time work has been characteristic of 
the recession of 2007–9 and its aftermath. Part-timers 
usually earn less per hour than their full-time coun-
terparts. It is often easier for companies to manage 
schedules with part-time workers, and they may not 
have to pay the same beneﬁts as full-time workers typi-
cally get. Some of the strongest job growth has been 
in areas such as food services and retailing, industries 
that are particularly likely to use part-timers.

Time Wait for Better Job,” New York Times, April 20, 2013.

CHAPTER 23 — EMPLOYMENT, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND WAGES
number of unemployed, the rate of labor underutilization in February 2013 comes to 14.3 
percent, compared to the ofﬁcial unemployment rate of 7.7 percent.
The BLS also counts people as employed even if the kind of work that they did does 
not match their skills. Suppose that you paint your aunt’s living room for cash while you 
are waiting to hear back on job applications for management or computer positions. The 
BLS counts you as already employed. People who are working at jobs that underutilize 
their abilities, as well as those who work fewer hours than they wish to, are said to be 
underemployed.
If we are concerned about human well-being, underemployment as well as unemployment 
should be of concern. While underemployment due to an underutilization of skills is certainly 
of considerable concern for both efﬁciency and quality-of-life reasons, BLS ofﬁcial surveys 
do not currently attempt to measure this sort of underemployment.
Discussion Questions
1. How would the BLS classify you, personally, on the basis of your activities last week? Can 
you think of an example where someone you think of as working would not be considered 
by the BLS to be ofﬁcially “employed”? Is it true that people who are not working are 
generally counted as “unemployed”?
2. Do you know anyone who is a “discouraged worker”? How about someone working part 
time “for economic reasons”?
1.3 LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION
In the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, it was common in the United States for men to be the 
“breadwinners” of a family while most women stayed home to care for children and engage 
in other household production. Thus men were much more likely to be part of the labor force, 
using the deﬁnition presented in Figure 23.1. We can calculate the labor force participation 
(LFP) rate by dividing the number of people ofﬁcially in the labor force by the number of 
people age 16 or over who are not institutionalized or in the military:
LFP Rate =
number of people in the labor force
 100
number of people age 16+, not institutionalized or in the military
The LFP rate indicates the fraction of potential paid workers who either are in paid jobs 
or are seeking and available for paid work. In 2013 the LFP rate in the United States was 
about 64 percent.
In the mid-twentieth century, the labor force participation rates for men and women were 
very different: In 1948 the LFP rate for men age 25 to 54 was 97 percent, while for women it 
was only 35 percent. Since then, men’s LFP rate has declined slightly while the rate for women 
increased dramatically until about 2000, when it began to stabilize at around 75 percent (see 
Figure 23.2). The women’s rights movement during the 1960s and 1970s contributed to this 
expansion in women’s labor market activities. Other factors include the expansion of the service 
sector (discussed in Chapter 22) and reductions in the average number of children per family. 
The decline in men’s LFP rate is likely a result of men’s staying in school longer and being 
more likely to assist with raising children and other household production. Young males 
(age 20–24) are much less likely to be in the labor force now compared to several decades 
ago, primarily due to staying in school longer. As a result of higher college attendance, the 
percentage of the labor force with a college degree has increased in recent decades—it is 
currently about 35 percent.
The labor force has changed in other ways as well, reﬂecting broader demographic changes. 
In 1975 the labor force was 89 percent Caucasian, but currently whites comprise 79 percent 
underemployment: 
working fewer hours 
than desired or at

of the labor force. The number of Hispanics in the labor force increased from 4 percent in 
1975 to 16 percent in 2013.
Discussion Questions
1. What was the labor force experience of your grandparents (or others whom you know in 
that generation? Of your parents (or their generation)? What do you expect your own labor 
force participation to be like? Do the patterns in your family reﬂect the national pattern 
of changes discussed in the text?
2. What evidence have you seen—in your own family or in the media—of increasing “ﬂex-
ibility” in labor markets? Do you think that these changes have been beneﬁcial, harmful, 
or both?
2. A CLOSER LOOK AT UNEMPLOYMENT
The unemployment rate is one of the most important indicators that economists use to judge 
the state of a country’s economy. As we see below, a degree of unemployment is expected 
and even considered healthy in an economy. But being unemployed for a long time, against 
one’s wishes, has a signiﬁcant negative impact on people’s well-being, including their mental 
and physical health.2
A recession has a major impact on increasing unemployment. Why do recessions occur? 
We brieﬂy address this question, which is so central to our understanding of employment 
and unemployment, leaving a more detailed study of the phenomenon to Part VII of this 
book.
2.1 TYPES OF UNEMPLOYMENT
Although BLS statisticians are concerned mainly with calculating the number of the un-
employed, economists are more concerned with the causes of unemployment. Economists 
often apply a three-way categorization of types of unemployment, which—while not closely 
related to BLS categories—can be helpful in thinking about some of the major causes of 
unemployment.

more women have entered 
the labor force.

CHAPTER 23 — EMPLOYMENT, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND WAGES
Frictional Unemployment
Frictional (or search) unemployment merely reﬂects people’s transitions between jobs. The 
fact that some people are unemployed does not necessarily mean that there are no jobs avail-
able. In January 2013, for example, while there were 12 million people unemployed, there 
were also about 3.7 million job vacancies—that is, jobs looking for people! Even in a well-
functioning economy, it may take many weeks for people and suitable jobs to ﬁnd each other. 
An unemployment rate of 0 percent could only happen if everyone who wants a job always 
takes one immediately, or at least within the BLS’s monthly survey periods. Not only is this 
unlikely but it is also in some ways undesirable. Everyone beneﬁts if people take the time to 
ﬁnd good job matches—work that puts their skills and talents to good use. Because information 
about job openings takes time to ﬁnd, and employers may want to spend time interviewing 
and testing applicants, making a good job match is not an instantaneous process.
For the most part, economists do not worry too much about frictional unemployment 
because some frictional unemployment—about 2 to 3 percent—is inevitable, and much of it 
tends to be short term. Things such as innovative Web technologies for matching job offers 
to job seekers may reduce frictional unemployment by reducing search time.
Many job seekers rely on state unemployment insurance programs to ease their income 
needs while they spend time searching for work. Unemployment compensation beneﬁts are, 
in many states, set at half a worker’s earnings or a state-set maximum (whichever is less). 
Until recently, people who qualiﬁed for unemployment programs usually received up to 
twenty-six weeks’ worth of beneﬁts. But in the wake of the Great Recession, unemployment 
beneﬁts were extended, at one time to as long as 99 weeks. Part of the justiﬁcation for these 
programs is to allow people the time to ﬁnd job opportunities—more difﬁcult in a time of 
high unemployment—and make good matches.
Structural Unemployment
Structural unemployment arises when a widespread mismatch occurs between, on the one 
hand, the kinds of jobs being offered by employers and, on the other, the skills, experience, 
education, or geographic location of potential employees. One important cause of structural 
unemployment is sectoral shifts, such as those described in Chapter 22, where employment 
has been falling (relative to total population size) in the primary and secondary sectors, with 
the largest number of new jobs opening up in the tertiary (service) sector. The U.S. economy 
may have a lot of new openings for ﬁnancial analysts and nurses’ aides in the Southwest, for 
example. But these will not do you much good if you live in the Northeast and your skills 
are in engine assembly or Web design.
Major transitions in the kinds of work that are available—whether caused by new 
technologies or by sectoral shifts—are inevitably painful. Many manufacturing jobs have 
traditionally enjoyed institutional arrangements—including unionization and job characteristics 
negotiated with the help of unions—that increased the compensation and the quality of those 
jobs. People who had developed valuable skills in one job may ﬁnd that their labor commands 
a lower price in other types of work. Many displaced workers, particularly older ones, may 
never ﬁnd the kind of pay and satisfaction that they had at their earlier occupations. Older 
displaced workers are more likely than younger ones to stay unemployed for long periods 
or to exit the labor force.
Governments at all levels have tried various policies to prevent or alleviate structural 
unemployment. The governments of some countries, notably Germany and Japan in the 
1980s and 1990s, have enacted industrial policies that directly encourage the development 
and retention of certain key industries through loans, subsidies, and tax credits. During 
negotiations on international trade (see Chapter 29), one sensitive issue is always the 
impact that increased trade might have on the employment levels in various industries in 
each country.

A CLOSER LOOK AT UNEMPLOYMENT 
521
Government policies in the United States that target structural unemployment often focus 
on helping displaced workers ﬁnd new employment. For example, the Trade Adjustment 
Assistance Reform Act of 2002 provides beneﬁts for certain workers displaced as a result 
of increased imports or the shifting of production to other countries. Workers who qualify 
for the program can receive retraining along with temporary income support payments and 
assistance with health insurance. The key feature of these programs is that they are targeted 
to particular workers in particular sectors of the economy. There has been some question, 
however, as to whether they have actually been successful in getting displaced workers into 
good new jobs. Business policies at the ﬁrm level are also relevant: Firms can help prevent 
structural unemployment if they make retaining or retraining their loyal employees a priority, 
even while responding to changes in technology and trade.
Cyclical Unemployment
Cyclical unemployment is unemployment due to macroeconomic ﬂuctuations—speciﬁcally, 
unemployment that occurs due to a recession. During recessions, unemployment rises as 
demand for the products of business falls off. During recoveries, this kind of unemployment 
should decrease.
Traditionally, a recession has been deﬁned as a situation in which GDP falls for at least 
two consecutive calendar quarters. Most economists look to the National Bureau of Economic 
Research (NBER), a nonproﬁt and nongovernmental economic research organization, to 
“ofﬁcially” mark the beginning and end of recessions. The NBER determinations are strongly 
based on GDP data, though they also consider other indicators, such as the levels of industrial 
production and wholesale-retail sales.
Whereas frictional unemployment and a degree of structural unemployment are almost 
always present in an economy, cyclical unemployment is variable and is the kind of 
unemployment that can be most harmful both to the individuals and families that it affects 
and to the economy as a whole. This is why a great deal of macroeconomic theorizing has 
to do with the causes of cyclical unemployment and the appropriate policy responses. In 
severe recessions, such as what has come to be called the Great Recession of 2007–8, cyclical 
unemployment becomes unacceptably high and may remain high even after the economy 
is no longer formally in recession. This is what has been called a “jobless recovery”: Even 
after GDP starts to recover, job growth is very slow.
As we see later in this and the following chapters, economists have different theories about 
what to do in response to high unemployment. As discussed in Chapter 19, these debates trace 
back to the Great Depression of the 1930s and the differences between classical economics and 
the theories of John Maynard Keynes. We pursue these issues in greater detail starting in Chapter 
24. First, we delve into patterns of unemployment and the workings of the labor market.
2.2 PATTERNS OF UNEMPLOYMENT
Figure 23.3 shows the monthly unemployment rate in the United States from January 1969 
to February 2013. Unemployment was at a low of 3.4 percent in 1969 and at a high of 10.8 
percent in 1982. Notice in the ﬁgure that, the U.S. economy experienced four recessions 
between 1969 and 1982 but only two relatively short recessions between 1983 and 2006.
During the Great Recession, the unemployment rate rose dramatically from less than 5 
percent in late 2007 to its peak of 10.0 percent in October 2009. Although by July 2013 the 
unemployment rate was down to 7.4 percent, it remained high by historical standards. In addition 
to persistent high unemployment, a particular feature of the Great Recession was a dramatic 
increase in the average duration of unemployment, shown in Figure 23.4, which plots the average 
duration of unemployment in addition to the unemployment rate. The ﬁgure shows that when 
the unemployment rate goes up, the average duration of unemployment also rises. When job 
opportunities are scarcer, it takes longer for workers who lose their jobs to ﬁnd new ones.

CHAPTER 23 — EMPLOYMENT, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND WAGES
We see in Figure 23.4 that even when the unemployment rate exceeded 10 percent in the 
early 1980s, the average duration of unemployment reached only about 20 weeks. As a result 
of the recession in the early 2000s, the unemployment rate peaked at around 6 percent and 
the average duration of unemployment again hit 20 weeks. But as the unemployment rate 
rose during the Great Recession, the average duration of unemployment shot up dramatically. 
Even as the unemployment rate began to fall in 2010, the average duration of unemployment 
continued to rise, eventually reaching a peak of about 41 weeks in late 2011. As mentioned 
above, the duration of unemployment beneﬁts was temporarily extended to up to 99 weeks 
in the wake of the Great Recession. (For more on the issue of unemployment duration and 
beneﬁts, see Box 23.3.)

A CLOSER LOOK AT UNEMPLOYMENT 
523
While structural unemployment affects only some sectors of the economy and some 
amount of frictional unemployment seems inevitable, cyclical unemployment is spread 
broadly through the economy and can cause considerable economic hardship. In the wake of 
the Great Recession, cyclical unemployment persisted at high levels for many years (see Box 
23.4). For this reason, it seems that avoiding or minimizing cyclical unemployment should 
be an important goal of economic policy. Explanations of why macroeconomic ﬂuctuations 
occur and what kind of policies might be used to dampen them (and thus reduce cyclical 
unemployment) are discussed in Part VII of this book. 
Discussion Questions
1. Reﬂecting on your experience or that of someone you know, how long might it normally 
take for someone to ﬁnd a job in your area? Comparing your answers in a group, do you 
ﬁnd different opinions? What might be some of the factors that make frictional unemploy-
ment last a longer or shorter period of time?
2. Do you know of places in your city or region (or country) that have been hit particularly 
hard by unemployment and underemployment, recently or in past decades? Do you know 
why this hardship occurred? Would you characterize this unemployment as frictional, 
structural, or cyclical?
BOX 23.3 UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND THE GREAT RECESSION
Before the Great Recession, unemployed workers were 
eligible to receive up to 26 weeks’ worth of unemploy-
ment beneﬁts through state-funded programs. An 
individual’s beneﬁts are calculated using state-speciﬁc 
formulas based on his or her earnings while in em-
ployment, subject to maximum amounts that also vary 
by state. The weekly maximum beneﬁt ranges from as 
much as about $900 in Massachusetts to as little as 
$250 in Mississippi, Arizona, and Louisiana.
As the economy headed into recession in 2008, 
Congress passed legislation that provided federal 
unemployment beneﬁts after state beneﬁts expired. 
Initially, the federal extension was 13 weeks, but several 
acts of Congress eventually increased this to as much 
as 73 weeks. Thus some workers became eligible for 
unemployment beneﬁts for a total of 99 weeks. The 
previous record for total unemployment beneﬁts was 65 
weeks’ worth during a recession in the mid-1970s.
More recently, the federal extension of unemploy-
ment beneﬁts has been scaled back—a result of both 
an improving economy and federal budget cuts. As 
of August 2013 the availability of federal unemploy-
ment beneﬁts varied by state from 14 to 47 weeks, 
depending on the unemployment rate in each state. 
Workers in states with the highest unemployment 
rates are eligible to receive federal beneﬁts for the 
longest duration.
However, the availability of unemployment ben-
eﬁts in each state is not always directly related to the 
economic conditions in that state, due to variations 
in state policies and other complexities. For example, 
while Alaska has a relative low unemployment rate 
(6.8 percent in March 2013), it offers beneﬁts for one 
of the longest periods. Meanwhile, South Carolina has 
an above-average unemployment rate but provides 
beneﬁts for a relatively short maximum of 48 weeks.
The disparity is partly the result of the nation’s complex 
unemployment-insurance system, a web of state and 
federal programs that wasn’t designed for such a long 
period of high unemployment. . . . The most dra-
matic recent cuts have been in North Carolina, which 
recently overhauled its unemployment-insurance 
system, reducing both the duration and the dollar 
amount of beneﬁts starting in July. . . . Doug Damato 
will likely be one of those getting cut off. The 40-year-
old Asheville resident was laid off from his job at a 
local utility in February 2012, and he enrolled in a 
program to earn an associate’s degree in mechanical 
engineering while receiving jobless beneﬁts. But Mr. 
Damato is now slated to lose his beneﬁts before he 
ﬁnishes his degree. “I don’t know what I’m going to 
do,” Mr. Damato said. “I’d like to be able to ﬁnish 
what I started.” (Casselman, 2013)

CHAPTER 23 — EMPLOYMENT, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND WAGES
3. THEORIES OF EMPLOYMENT, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND WAGES
Employment and wages are fundamental components of macroeconomic analysis. As of 2012 
income from wages and salaries accounted for 69 percent of national income in the United 
States. Labor income is what makes it possible for most households to purchase many of the 
things that they need and want. (The other sources of income mostly derive from various kinds 
and degrees of ownership of productive assets—such as buildings, land, or other resources 
or stocks, which are ownership “shares” in companies.) We now take a look at the different 
explanations for how wages are set and how overall employment and unemployment levels 
are determined.
3.1 THE CLASSICAL THEORY
You will recall from Chapter 19 that “classical” approaches to economics favor the workings 
of free markets, without government intervention. The classical approach to understanding 
wages and employment assumes that markets behave as described by the idealized supply-
and-demand model presented in Chapter 4, characterized by perfect competition. 
This model, as applied to the labor market, is shown as Figure 23.5a. “Quantity,” on the 
horizontal axis, can be understood to mean either quantity of labor services or the amount 
of labor hours supplied and demanded. We can think of this quantity as being measured, for 
example, by the number of full-time equivalent days worked over a given time period. The 
“price” of labor is the wage, in this case, per day (we assume that this is a “real” wage, i.e., 
adjusted for inﬂation.) Workers supply labor, while employers demand it. This very simple 
model assumes that every unit of labor services is the same and every worker in this market 
will receive exactly the same wage. The equilibrium wage in this example is WE and the 
equilibrium quantity of labor supplied is at LE.
Because the market pictured in Figure 23.5a is free to adjust, there is no involuntary 
unemployment. Everyone who wants a job at the going wage gets one. There may be many 
BOX 23.4 HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT PROVES PERSISTENT 
Employers in the United States added 162,00 jobs in 
July 2013, fewer than expected, with the previous two 
months’ estimates of job growth revised downward as 
well. The unemployment rate ticked down from 7.6 
to 7.4 percent as people got jobs or dropped out of 
the labor force.
According to a report by the Economic Policy 
Institute,
The labor market began the second half of 2013 
with a ﬁzzle. The jobs report released by the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics shows the addition of 162,000 
jobs in July and a 26,000 downward revision to 
earlier months’ data, bringing the average monthly 
growth rate of the last three months to 175,000 
jobs. At this rate, it would take six years to ﬁll the 
gap of 8.3 million jobs needed to return to a 
healthy job market.
 The unemployment rate dropped from 7.6 to 
7.4 percent, but this was largely due to workers 
dropping out of, or not entering, the labor force 
because of weak job opportunities. The labor force 
participation rate dropped to 63.4 percent, near its 
low of the downturn. The share of the working-age 
(16+) population with a job did not budge, holding 
steady at 58.7 percent.
The Economic Policy Institute report noted that 
unemployment was elevated across all categories of 
education, age, gender, race/ethnicity, and occupa-
tion—a pattern characteristic of cyclical unemploy-
ment. The number of people working part-time who 
wanted full-time jobs increased by 19,000, to 8.2 
million, indicating an underemployment rate at a level 
about double that prior to the downturn. Long-term 
unemployment was also elevated, with 36.7 percent 
of unemployed workers having been unemployed for 
more than six months.

people who would offer their services on this market if the wage were higher—as the portion 
of the supply curve to the right of LE demonstrates. But, given the currently offered wage rate, 
these people have made a rational choice not to participate in this labor market.
Within this model, the only way that involuntary unemployment can exist is if something 
gets in the way of market forces. The presence of a legal minimum wage is commonly 
pointed to as one such factor. As illustrated in Figure 23.5b, if employers are required to 
pay a minimum wage of W* (“W-star”), which is above the equilibrium wage, this model 
predicts that they will hire fewer workers. At an artiﬁcially high wage W*, employers want 
to hire only LD workers. But at that wage more people (LS) want jobs. There is a situation of 
surplus, as we discussed in Chapter 4. In this case, the market is prevented from adjusting to 
equilibrium by legal restrictions on employers. Now there are people who want a job at the 
going wage, but cannot ﬁnd one—that is, they are unemployed.
In the real world, where issues of motivation, labor relations, and power are also 
important, the classical idea that minimum wages cause substantial unemployment can 
be called into question. In a well-known study, economists David Card and Alan Krueger 
found that a moderate increase in the minimum wage in New Jersey did not cause low-
wage employment to decline and may have even increased it.3 The study came under 
ﬁre from economists who believed (given the analysis shown in Figure 23.5a) that such 
a result simply could not be true. But the classical world assumes perfect competition, 
whereas real-world employers may have enough power in the labor market to be able to 
pay workers less than they are worth. Labor markets seem to be more complicated than a 
simple supply-and-demand model suggests.
In any case, the minimum wage affects only a portion of the workforce—people who are 
relatively unskilled, including many teenagers—but unemployment tends to affect people 
at all wage levels. Classical economists suggest other “market interference” reasons for 
unemployment, as well. The economy might provide less than the optimal number of jobs, 
they believe, because:

CHAPTER 23 — EMPLOYMENT, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND WAGES
market behavior. Like other classical proposals, such labor market proposals assume 
that the economy works best under the principle of laissez-faire (“leave it alone”). But 
alternative explanations of the workings of labor markets suggest a different perspective. 
In considering some of these alternative explanations, we will step away from the 
assumptions of a single, homogeneous market in which all jobs and all workers are 
alike and the labor market is characterized by perfect competition. Labor markets are 
also inﬂuenced by many other factors, including history, psychology, power, resources, 
productivity, and technology.
3.2 ALTERNATIVE PERSPECTIVES ON LABOR MARKETS
In Chapter 19, we identiﬁed the Keynesian (pronounced “Canesian”) perspective as a major 
alternative to the classical view. Keynes, among many other economists, pointed out aspects of 
real-world human psychology, history, and institutions that make it unlikely (as well as often 
undesirable) that wages will fall quickly in response to a labor surplus. Wages may eventu-
ally adjust in the way shown in the classical model but too slowly to keep the labor market 
in equilibrium. And even if wages do fall, this will not necessarily result in full employment, 
for reasons we will discuss. 
The incidence of unemployment, as well as the different rates of pay going to different 
groups, has much to do with people’s memory of recent history. When one category of work 
is paid more highly than another, people who were receiving those higher wages are often 
able to hold out for a long time against other forces (including supply and demand) that would 
tend to reverse the relationship. Employers may be slow to reduce wages because they fear 
that workers will strongly resist such a move—perhaps with strikes or other labor actions. 
The observed failure of wages to adjust as quickly or completely as predicted has inspired 
a number of theoretical explanations. Some of these fall into the category of “sticky wage” 
theories. In addition to psychological resistance to wage cuts, a minimum wage might also 
make wages “sticky,” or wages may also become set at particular levels by long-term contracts, 
such as many large employers negotiate with labor unions.
A fairly recent attempt to explain wages that differ from the equilibrium point is efﬁciency 
wage theory, which points out that managers must attract, train, and motivate workers if 
their enterprise is to be productive. Employers may therefore ﬁnd it to their advantage to 
pay employees more than would be strictly necessary to get them to work. This theory can 
be illustrated by looking back at Figure 23.5a, where W* could be read as the efﬁciency 
wage.
Efﬁciency wage theory is a good ﬁt with many observations. When workers are better paid 
they may be healthier and better nourished and therefore more able to do quality work. (This 
is especially true when talking about wage rates at the low end of the scale.) Also, workers 
may be more highly motivated and may have a lower propensity to quit if they know they 
are getting “a really good deal” from their employer than they would be if they are getting 
barely enough to motivate them to take the job or just the same as they could get anywhere 
else. Workers with a lower likelihood of quitting are more valuable to an employer because 
the employer saves on the costs of training new workers. Workers may also work more 
efﬁciently if they believe that they could lose their “really good deal” if they are caught 
shirking. If a pool of unemployed people results from the higher-than-necessary efﬁciency 
wages, those who are employed might have greater incentives to work hard out of fear of 
losing their good jobs.
Legally or contractually set wages, fear of worker unrest, and efﬁciency wages are all 
possible explanations for “sticky wages.” What sort of policies result from such theories? 
More government activity to relieve unemployment-related hardship may be proposed, such 
as the policies we discuss in Part VII of this book, or programs of unemployment beneﬁts 
or job creation.

THEORIES OF EMPLOYMENT, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND WAGES 
527
Some economists also argue that a moderate level of economy-wide price inﬂation tends 
to relieve some “sticky wage” unemployment. How could this be so? Suppose that you are 
working for $12 per hour now, and your employer wants to cut your wage to $10 per hour. 
You would probably resist if asked to accept this wage cut—especially if you see that other 
people are not suffering such wage cuts. But suppose, instead, that your wage stays at $12 
per hour, and, over time, inﬂation reduces the purchasing power of your wage to $10 per 
hour (in terms of prices of the base year). Your nominal wage has stayed the same, but your 
real wage (and thus your real cost to your employer) has fallen. Because this has happened 
more subtly—and is felt more economy-wide—than a cut in your personal nominal wage, 
you may not feel as compelled to resist. According to some theories, such a drop in the wage 
(in real terms) should cause employment to increase.
While some Keynesian theorists emphasize sticky wages, Keynes’s critique of classical 
views actually went much further. In more general terms, the Keynesian perspective challenges 
the entire classical assertion that unemployment results mainly from wage levels that are 
too high. Rather than blaming unemployment on “the wage being too high,” Keynes and his 
followers focus on the issue of insufﬁcient demand for labor—which they perceive as the 
direct result of insufﬁcient demand for goods and services. (It is often said that “the demand 
for labor is a derived demand”—meaning that it is derived from the demand for the output 
produced by labor.)
Thus, to Keynes and his followers, ﬁxing the problem of unemployment in a recession or 
depression is not just a matter of making labor markets work more smoothly. Rather, total 
demand—what economists refer to as aggregate demand—for goods and services in the 
economy has to increase in order to stimulate hiring. In this analysis, falling wages would 
not improve labor market conditions but would make things worse, because workers would 
have less money to buy goods and services, leading to lower levels of business sales and 
further layoffs. Unlike the classical economists, Keynes believed that government policies 
could be effective in response to an economic downturn. We consider these theories and 
policies in Part VII of this book.
3.3 LONGER TERM ISSUES: PRODUCTIVITY, RESOURCES, AND TECHNOLOGY
An important macroeconomic issue is the share of total income received by labor. Data that 
track the share of national income received as wages indicate that this share has declined in 
recent years. In the nonfarm business sector (which accounts for roughly 74 percent of the 
output produced in the U.S. economy), labor’s share of total income tended, before 1980, to 
ﬂuctuate around a long-run value of approximately 65 percent. By 2012 it had decreased to 
57.6 percent.
One explanation for this could be that workers have become less productive—but 
statistics on average output per hour worked indicate that wages have in fact not been 
keeping up with growing labor productivity. The formal deﬁnition of labor productivity is 
the market value of the output of a given amount of labor, normally one hour. Productivity 
growth in the nonfarm business sector averaged 2.7 percent annually before 1973, then 
1.4 percent during a slowdown in productivity growth over 1974–1995, and 2.3 percent 
from 1996 to 2012.
As labor becomes more productive, one would expect that wages would rise accordingly. 
As shown in Figure 23.6, which presents the growth of nonfarm labor productivity and 
nonfarm real median hourly wages since 1947, this was approximately true from 1947 up to 
until about 1970. Over this period, wages and productivity both increased by a real factor of 
about two. But since then, a gap between productivity growth and real wage growth became 
evident. This wage-productivity gap has increased over time.
As suggested in Chapter 10, the decline in the bargaining power of unions in the United 
States is one obvious explanation for the widening wage-productivity gap. Workers have not

CHAPTER 23 — EMPLOYMENT, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND WAGES
had the power to insist that their wages keep up with the increasing value of their output. At 
the same time, when we consider the share of income going to labor, we also must realize 
that the productivity of labor depends in part on other aspects of production.
There are a number of important determinants of labor productivity, including health and 
education (as aspects of human capital), work organization, and levels of cooperation in the 
workplace (which are aspects of social capital). This section focuses on two other determinants 
of labor productivity: technology, which can expand the stocks of manufactured, human, and 
social capital; and natural resources.
Technology and Wages
Obviously, a main reason for the upward trend in labor productivity shown in Figure 23.6 
is an improvement in technology. But can technology also be part of the reason that median 
wages have not kept pace with productivity gains?
Ever since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, technology has been recognized 
by workers as a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it has created circumstances wherein 
each worker has more natural and manufactured capital to work with, raising workers’ 
productivity and hence their earnings. On the other hand, technology can effectively replace 
workers, leading to technological unemployment; ever fewer workers are needed to produce 
a given quantity of output.
Fears of technological unemployment have been raised repeatedly during the last two 
and a half centuries. While these fears have been valid in speciﬁc areas—for example, 
computers have made many secretarial jobs obsolete—the total quantity of jobs has not 
declined as a proportion of the population. Indeed, in the twentieth century, the number of 
jobs in the United States increased signiﬁcantly, as women successfully entered the labor 
force and increased the LFP rate, as mentioned above. Technological unemployment, to 
those who experience it, is as painful as any other type of unemployment; however, it 
does not become a society-wide issue if the total number of jobs keeps pace with the size 
of the population, and education or retraining provides workers who can adapt to the new 
circumstances.
Technology can also affect wages and the distribution of wages across different types of 
workers. One theory, referred to as skill-biased technical change, proposes that workers

who possess the education and skills needed to use modern technologies will see relative 
increases in employment and wages. For example, workers who are able to use computers 
and other digital technologies may gain an advantage over workers who lack such skills. If 
these skilled workers are a minority of the work force, they could obtain wage gains while 
most workers’ wages stagnate. Note that average wages may increase while the median wage 
stays relatively constant if all the gains accrue to those at the top.* Skill-biased technical 
change has been hypothesized to be one of the reasons for an overall increase in inequality 
in the United States.
Evidence suggests that skill-biased technical change may be part of the explanation for 
rising wage inequality, but it may be a less important factor particularly in recent years. A 
2012 paper notes:
It is hard, however, to ﬁnd the winners from technical change in the last ten years, as the 
wages of the bottom 70 per cent of college graduates have been ﬂat or in decline. That 
would leave just 30 per cent of college graduates (6.6 per cent of the workforce) and 
the 11 per cent of workers with advanced degrees as the winners of technical change. 
It also seems unlikely that technical change has generated the upward trajectory of the 
top 1 per cent of wage earners.4
Natural Resources and Wages
The availability and prices of natural resources can also affect wages. Labor and natural 
resources represent two inputs in production processes, along with other types of capital, so 
productivity depends on a combination of inputs.
First, consider the possibility that natural resources are becoming scarcer and/or more 
expensive to extract, as discussed in Chapter 19. If natural resources, as one input into 
production processes, become more expensive, producers will seek to substitute other inputs 
that have become relatively less expensive. Thus the demand for labor would be expected 
to increase, and wages should rise. But we also have to consider the macroeconomic 
impact of a rise in natural resource prices. In recent years, higher prices for oil and other 
natural resources have had a negative impact on economic activity, contributing to higher 
unemployment.
As mentioned above, technology also represents an input into production processes. If 
natural resources become more expensive, that creates an incentive for research into ways to 
use these resources more efﬁciently, or to seek substitutes. Technological improvements or 
resource substitution could offset the negative impacts of natural resource scarcity on wages 
and the overall economy.
Productivity gains could also be the basis for reducing work hours. Figure 23.6 shows 
that labor productivity doubled between the mid-1970s and 2012. One interpretation of this 
result is that the United States can now produce twice the quantity of goods and services 
with the same amount of labor used in the 1970s. But an alternative possibility is that we 
can now produce the same quantity of goods and services produced in the 1970s, but with 
half the amount of labor.
Consider this statement in light of the notion of labor ﬂexibility discussed in Chapter 
10. Suppose that workers had the choice between taking productivity gains as either wage 
increases or labor time decreases. Theoretically, American workers could be living at the 
same material living standards of the 1970s, but working only six months of every year! 
*The median wage is the wage received by workers at the exact middle of the wage distribution. Thus the median wage 
can remain constant or decline while wages in the top half of the distribution increase.

CHAPTER 23 — EMPLOYMENT, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND WAGES
Of course, some workers may always choose more pay over shorter hours, but allowing 
for more work choice accords with standard economic theory, stated as follows:
According to economic theory, we should let each worker choose how many hours to 
work. If workers choose shorter hours, it is because they get greater satisfaction from 
more free time than they would get from more income. According to the basic principle 
of market economics, interfering with individuals’ choices between more free time 
and more income reduces total well being, just as interfering with individuals’ choices 
between two products would reduce total well being by forcing some people to buy 
the product that gives them less.5
Assuming that many workers are willing to work shorter hours for an equivalent reduction 
in pay, as mentioned in Section 2.2, this would reduce their overall consumption and thus 
rates of natural resource degradation and extraction.
Currently in the United States, part-time jobs are much less attractive than full-time jobs 
because hourly wages are often low and few beneﬁts are provided. Some countries have 
enacted policies to promote higher-quality part-time jobs. One example is the Netherlands 
where discrimination against part-time workers is illegal and employers must offer the option 
of shorter work hours unless they can prove that it would impose an economic hardship on 
their business.
BOX 23.5 WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF WORK?
Discussions about the future of work tempt us to 
try to imagine what a better world would be like 
and to ask ourselves whether the economy of the 
future is trending in such a direction. Questions 
along these lines were posed to Andres McAfee, 
an MIT business school researcher who coauthored 
the book Race Against the Machine. Asked for an 
optimistic view of the future, McAfee described a 
“digital Athens” in which a highly automated and 
productive economy would greatly reduce the need 
for human labor—“So the optimistic version is that 
we ﬁnally have more hours in our week freed up 
from toil and drudgery.” When asked if he saw a 
digital Athens on the horizon, he responded that, 
instead, “the people at the top of the skill, wage, 
and income distribution are working more hours,” 
while added leisure is going to those who don’t want 
it—the unemployed.
McAfee was also asked: “What is your advice to 
the individual, or to the parent educating a child?” 
His response: “To the parent, make sure your kid’s 
education is geared toward things at which machines 
appear not to be very good. Computers are still lousy 
at programming computers. Computers are still bad at 
ﬁguring out what questions need to be asked. I would 
encourage every kid these days to buckle down and 
do a double major, one in the liberal arts and one in 
the college of sciences.”

Andres McAfee, Technology Review (September/October 
2012): 71.
Some analysts have proposed that giving people more ﬂexibility to set their work hours is 
an important way to achieve a more sustainable society (see Box 23.5). We will discuss the 
issue of policies needed for sustainability in more detail in Chapter 33.
Discussion Questions

“sticky wage” theorists, or economists concerned with aggregate demand? What are 
some strengths and weaknesses of each argument? 
2. Can you think of other impacts, positive and negative, of allowing workers more ﬂexibil-
ity in setting their work hours? Would you support any speciﬁc policies to promote more 
choice of work hours?

24 Aggregate Demand and  
Economic Fluctuations
What makes an economy experience GDP expansion or contraction, high or low employment, 
and good or bad business conditions? These questions have been very much in the forefront 
of discussion in the United States and many other countries since the ﬁnancial crisis of 
2007–8, the ensuing recession, widely known as the Great Recession, and the slow recovery 
that followed. In a sophisticated contemporary economy such as that in the United States, 
a decline in demand for goods and services by consumers and businesses generally leads to 
recessionary conditions and higher unemployment. In Chapter 30 we discuss the events of 
the ﬁnancial crisis and its aftermath in more detail. But before getting into these speciﬁcs, 
we need to develop a general theory of how the demand for goods and services varies over 
time and how this affects economic conditions.
1. THE BUSINESS CYCLE
Part VII of this textbook focuses in particular on the goal of economic stabilization—that 
is, keeping unemployment and inﬂation at acceptable levels over the business cycle. For the 
moment, we set aside consideration of our two other goals—the goal of improvement in true 
living standards and the goal of maintaining the ecological, social, and ﬁnancial sustainability 
of a national economy—to focus on stabilization. As we see, one crucial key to understanding 
macroeconomics is how the amount that individuals and businesses want to spend overall 
(or “aggregate demand,” as we called it in Chapter 19) inﬂuences, and is inﬂuenced by, 
other macroeconomic variables. One of the key debates in macroeconomic policy is between 
Keynesians, who believe that aggregate demand needs active guidance if the economy is to 
be stable, and more classically-oriented economists, who believe that aggregate demand can 
take care of itself.
In Chapter 19 we introduced the notion of the “business cycle,” while in Chapter 23 we 
considered in detail how employment and unemployment vary over the cycle. Now we look 
in more detail at business cycles, or recurrent ﬂuctuations in the level of national production, 
with alternating periods of recession and boom.
1.1 WHAT HAPPENS DURING THE BUSINESS CYCLE
Figure 24.1 shows the pattern of real GDP growth over the period 1985–2012. In most years, as you 
can see, GDP grew. But during three periods—1990–91, and 2001, and 2007–9—GDP shrank. The 
level of real GDP actually went down from one calendar quarter to the next. As noted in Chapter 
23, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) declares a “recession” when economic 
activity declines for two consecutive quarters, relying on GDP statistics to make this judgment.
In other periods, you can see that GDP grew quite steadily. The positive GDP growth 
beginning in 2002 shown in Figure 24.1 continued well into 2007, but in 2007–8 the ﬁnancial

crisis hit, and the economy plunged into a severe recession, lasting from December 2007 to 
June 2009. After the recession technically ended, it took several years for GDP to recover 
to its previous level, and as discussed in the last chapter, high unemployment lingered much 
longer. The goal of macroeconomic stabilization policy is to smooth out such variations.
As we discuss the ins and outs of stabilization policy, you need to keep in mind two “stylized 
facts.” Economists call these “stylized facts” because, while they form a very important base 
for the way we think about the economy, they are not always literally true. Just as we use 
simplifying assumptions in microeconomics to draw supply and demand curves, we start 
from a simpliﬁed version of reality in constructing our macroeconomic theory.
Stylized Fact #1: During an economic downturn or contraction, unemployment rises, 
while in a recovery or expansion, unemployment falls. This is fairly easy to understand, 
since, when production in an economy is falling, it would seem natural to assume that 
producers need fewer workers—because they are producing fewer goods. Similarly, in an 
expansion, unemployment falls.* This relationship is sometimes expressed by an equation 
called Okun’s law. In the early 1960s, economist Arthur M. Okun estimated that a one-
percentage point drop in the unemployment rate was associated with an approximately 
3-percentage point boost to real GDP. The equation for Okun’s “law” has been estimated 
many times since then, and in many different variations, and is best regarded as a rule of 
thumb rather than a “law.”
We can see some strong evidence of this inverse relationship between output growth and 
employment by comparing Figure 24.1 with Figure 24.2, which shows the unemployment 
rate from 1985 to 2012, including the three recessions that occurred during this period, as 
identiﬁed by the NBER. As output turns downward in Figure 24.1, unemployment shoots 
dramatically upward in Figure 24.2. The inverse relation, however, is not perfect. In all 
three recessions, the unemployment rate continued to increase even after GDP started to rise 
again. But with the exception of the periods immediately following a recession, rising GDP 
is generally associated with increased employment.
Stylized Fact #2: An economic recovery or expansion, if it is very strong, tends to lead 
to an increase in the inﬂation rate. During a downturn or contraction, pressure on inﬂation 
eases off (and inﬂation may fall or even become negative). The reasoning behind this result 
is that, as an economy “heats up,” producers increasingly compete with one another over a  
Okun’s “law”: an 
empirical inverse rela-
tionship between the 
unemployment rate 
and real GDP growth
*In a “jobless recovery,” real GDP growth is slow (below average), so it does not create jobs fast enough to counteract the 
normal increase in the labor force due to population growth and decrease in labor demand due to increased output per worker.

THE BUSINESS CYCLE

limited supply of raw materials, labor, and so on. Prices and wages tend to be bid up, and 
inﬂation results or intensiﬁes. In a slump, this upward pressure on prices slackens, or even 
reverses, so inﬂation may be lower or even, in some cases, negative (deﬂation). Figure 24.3 
shows the inﬂation rate over the period 1985–2012, including the same three recessions 
highlighted in Figures 24.1 and 24.2. 
As you can see, the “stylized fact” that inﬂation tends to fall during a recession seems to be 
borne out by the actual data for this period. The three recessions shown in Figure 24.3 were 
accompanied by distinct downturns in the inﬂation rate. But wide ﬂuctuations in the inﬂation 
rate also occurred during other periods, with both increases and downturns occurring during 
economic upswings. Business cycle–led variations in the degree of competition for workers 
and resources are only one cause—and, in recent decades, not always the most important 
cause—of variations in inﬂation. We look at this issue more closely in Chapters 27 and 28. 
But for the discussion of business cycles in this and the following two chapters, we assume 
that booms lead to at least a threat of rising inﬂation.
1.2 A STYLIZED BUSINESS CYCLE
When analyzing business cycles, it is often convenient to separate the issue of economic ﬂuctua-
tions from the issue of economic growth. In Figure 24.1 the most striking pattern is the overall 
growth trend in GDP. For the analysis in Part VII of this book, it will be more helpful to mentally 
remove the upward trend and to think of business cycles in terms of the stylized picture shown 
in Figure 24.4. (We return to the subjects of growth and development in Part VIII.)

ended, reaching a peak of 10 
percent in 2010.

CHAPTER 24 — AGGREGATE DEMAND AND ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
During a contraction, GDP falls until the economy hits the trough, or lowest point. During 
an expansion, GDP rises from a trough until it reaches a peak. In Figure 24.4, the idea that 
there is a range of output levels that represent “full employment” is represented by the gray 
area labeled with the value Y*. Given the different kinds of unemployment discussed in 
Chapter 23, there is some controversy about exactly what “full employment” means over the 
business cycle, so we have used a range rather than a speciﬁc level of GDP here to indicate 
“full-employment output” for modeling purposes. (Sometimes you may also see this referred 
to as “potential output.”)
At full-employment output, the economy is, presumably, not suffering from an 
unemployment problem. But neither is the unemployment rate actually zero (as measured 
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics), due to the existence of at least some short-term, transitory 
or “frictional,” unemployment.
What economists generally do agree on is that there have been—historically, at least—
episodes when economies have “overheated” and output has gone above this range—giving 
rise (by Stylized Fact #2) to inﬂationary pressures. Thus Figure 24.4 shows employment at 
the peak levels at the top of, or possibly slightly exceeding, the “full employment” band. And 
there have also been times when economies have fallen into troughs, with (due to Stylized 
Fact #1) unacceptable levels of unemployment. In terms of the business cycle model shown in 
Figure 24.4, the goal of stabilization policy is to keep an economy in the gray area, avoiding 
the threats of inﬂation and unemployment.
1.3 THE DOWNTURN SIDE OF THE STORY
It will take this entire chapter and the next four to build up a workable theory of the business 
cycle! Because this is a large and complex topic, we need to take things one step at a time. 
We start by looking at the case of economic downturns.
The biggest downturn in U.S. history was, of course, the Great Depression. Production 
dropped dramatically from 1929 to 1930 and ofﬁcially measured national unemployment 
soared, topping out at 25 percent. Some regions were especially hard-hit, with unemployment 
rates above the national average, and severe underemployment as well. Not only were times 
bad—they stayed bad. Unemployment stayed in the double digits all through the 1930s.
Nor was the Great Depression just a U.S. phenomenon. Most of this country’s major 
trading partners were also hard-hit. Table 24.1 presents some additional descriptive data 
about the falloff in economic activity in the United States, and resulting hardships, during 
the Great Depression.
Figure 24.4 A Stylized Business Cycle
In this hypothetical economy, GDP contracts 
from peaks to troughs, and expands from 
troughs to peaks. A range of output indicating 
“full employment” is indicated by Y*.

MACROECONOMIC MODELING AND AGGREGATE DEMAND 
539
Another severe economic downturn hit the United States beginning in 2007. While not 
as serious as the Great Depression, this “Great Recession” resembled it in that, unlike most 
recessions of the past, it persisted for more than a few quarters. Even after the economy 
formally left recession and entered recovery, employment growth was very slow. This 
severe recession was caused in large part by the ﬁnancial crisis of 2007 and illustrates the 
vulnerability of the U.S. economy to excess “ﬁnancialization,” a topic that we discussed in 
Chapter 22, and to which we return in Chapter 30.
Notice that in our stylized business cycle in Figure 24.4 there is no scale on the “year” axis. 
The timing of the cycle is not regular or predictable, so economists in the early years of the 
Great Depression differed on how to interpret it. Most economists in the 1930s, trained in the 
classical school, reassured public leaders that this sort of cycle was merely to be expected. 
They believed that the economy was in the “trough” stage but that it would soon start to 
expand again. In the long run, they assured ofﬁcials, the economy would recover by itself, 
as it had recovered from other downturns in the past.
In response, British economist John Maynard Keynes quipped that “in the long run, we are all 
dead.” He meant that simply waiting for the economy to recover would lead to an unacceptably 
long period of severe economic damage—which indeed is what happened during the Great 
Depression. In 1936 Keynes presented a theory on how economies can fall into recessions and 
stay there for a long time—and some ideas about how public policy might help economies get 
out of the trough more quickly. We start our detailed study of business cycle theory with models 
that illustrate classical and Keynesian theories concerning recession and depressions.
Discussion Questions
1. What impressions do you have of the Great Recession that began in 2007? What were its 
impacts on people whom you know or have heard about? How do you think it compares 
to the Great Depression of the 1930s?
2. Do you know in what phase of the business cycle we are at present? Is the U.S. economy 
currently in a recession or an expansion? What does this mean for employment, inﬂation, 
and GDP growth?
2. MACROECONOMIC MODELING AND AGGREGATE DEMAND
For economists, explanations often take the form of theoretical mathematical models. A theo-
retical model (as we saw in Chapter 2) is a “thought experiment” to help us see the world,

which necessarily highlights some aspects of a situation. At the same time, due to simplify-
ing assumptions, it neglects others. A mathematical model expresses the theory in terms of 
equations, graphs, or schedules. Models contain variables. These are abstract (simpliﬁed) 
representations of important macroeconomic measures—usually related to ones that we can 
observe empirically, such as GDP or the unemployment rate. Macroeconomists make simpli-
fying assumptions about variables, for example, assuming that all the various interest rates 
that might coexist in the economy can be summarized as if they were a single one, referred 
to as “the interest rate.” Mathematical models relate these variables together using algebraic 
formulas, graphs, or tables in such a way as to make clear how these variables affect one 
another, according to the theorist’s understanding.

In Chapter 20, we saw that the economy could be described in terms of four sectors: house-
hold, business, government, and foreign. Household expenditures on consumption, business 
expenditures on investment, government spending, and exchange with the foreign sector 
expressed as net exports were summed up to obtain total GDP.
This approach simpliﬁes the economy—for example, by assuming that only businesses 
carry out investment—and the models of aggregate demand we now develop simplify even 
further:*

does not grow. In designing models, it is often useful to separate out different issues into 
different models. Chapter 32 of this text examines economic growth and ignores business 
cycles. In Part VII, we take an opposite but complementary approach, concentrating on 
cycles and abstracting from growth.

households, in return for the labor or capital services that they provide. (In the real world, 
businesses often hold onto some of their proﬁts as “retained earnings,” rather than paying 
them all out to households, but we ignore that here.) We reintroduce the government in 
Chapter 25 and discuss the foreign sector in Chapter 29.

sical and Keynesian theories about the behavior of economies that face a threat of recession 
and rising unemployment due to (potentially) insufﬁcient aggregate demand. Booms and 
inﬂationary pressures are discussed in later chapters.
These simpliﬁcations allow us to make some important points while still keeping the 
stories, with their accompanying math and graphs, reasonably simple.
2.2 OUTPUT, INCOME, AND AGGREGATE DEMAND
Recall from Chapter 20 that whether GDP is measured by the product approach, the spending 
approach, or the income approach, the number will be the same (in theory). For the macro-
economic models that we now develop, we will assume that a single variable, which we will 
denote as “Y,” represents GDP expressed as “output,” “product,” or “income” interchangeably. 
The top arrow in Figure 24.5 illustrates that, in our simpliﬁed macroeconomy, production by 
ﬁrms generates labor and capital incomes to households.
But things get more interesting when we examine the ﬂows from income into spending 
and from spending (aggregate demand) to supporting a given level of output in the economy. 
*As noted in Chapter 20, household investment in consumer durables and government investment in ﬁxed assets are not 
speciﬁcally accounted for in national income calculations.

 
MACROECONOMIC MODELING AND AGGREGATE DEMAND 
541
A macroeconomy is in an equilibrium situation when output, income, and spending are all 
in balance—when they are linked in an unbroken chain, each supported by the other at the 
equilibrium level, as illustrated in Figure 24.5.
The Keynesian model is based on the idea that spending or aggregate demand, which we 
denote as AD, may (at least temporarily) fall out of balance with the other ﬂows. Aggregate 
demand in the economy depends on the spending behavior of the economic actors in the 
economy. Households make consumption spending decisions, and together the household 
sector generates an aggregate level of consumption, C. We assume that households always 
consume at the level that they plan to, given their incomes—that what they end up spending 
is always exactly equal to what they intended to spend.
But for ﬁrms, the situation can be more complicated, as we will see as this chapter 
progresses. Purchases of ﬁnal goods by business ﬁrms are considered investment, as discussed 
in Chapter 20. We will denote total investment for a given year as I. But, as we will see, total 
actual investment is not always the same as what business ﬁrms plan to invest. We call the 
amount they plan to invest over the course of a year intended investment, II.
Because the only actors we are looking at right now are households and businesses, we 
begin our modeling of aggregate demand with the equation:
Aggregate Demand = Consumption + Intended Investment
AD = C + II
AD is the level of spending that results if people are able to follow their plans.
Remembering that if “output,” “income,” and “spending” are all just different ways of 
looking at GDP, it must also be true in this simple economy that GDP is equal to consumption 
plus total (actual) investment:
Y = C + I
Y = C + I is an accounting identity. At the end of any year, when actual ﬂows of output, 
income, and spending are tallied up in the national accounts, the spending by households 
and businesses must (in an economy with no government or foreign sector) be equal to GDP. 
This equation is true in the same way that, in business accounting, net worth is deﬁned as 
equal to assets minus liabilities.
The equation AD = C + II, in contrast, represents something different. It is what is called a 
behavioral equation, used by economists for modeling purposes—we do not have a national 
agency that looks into business leaders’ minds and measures their intentions! We work with 
Figure 24.5 The Output-Income-Spending Flow of an Economy in Equilibrium
A macroeconomy is said to be in 
equilibrium when the incomes that 
arise from production give rise to 
a level of spending that, in turn, 
stimulates producers to produce the 
original level of output.

CHAPTER 24 — AGGREGATE DEMAND AND ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
both of these equations later in this chapter. The accounting identity involves the actual 
level of investment, while the behavioral equation involves the level of planned, desired, or 
intended investment. While in this simple world households always actually spend what they 
have intended to spend (so we do not need a separate symbol for “intended consumption”), 
Y and AD will only be the same if actual investment (I) is equal to intended investment (II). 
As we will see, this will not always be the case.
The link from income (Y) to spending (AD) is the potential weak link in the chain illustrated 
in Figure 24.5. This is because the people who get the income do not just automatically go 
out and spend it all. This creates the problem of leakages.
2.3 THE PROBLEM OF LEAKAGES
The household sector, we have assumed, receives all the income in the economy. House-
holds spend some of this income on consumption goods and save the rest, according to the 
equation:
S = Y – C
where S is the aggregate level of saving. Saving is considered a “leakage” from the output-
income-spending cycle, because it represents income that is not spent on currently produced 
goods and services. This is illustrated in Figure 24.6, which shows that some funds are diverted 
from the income-spending part of the cycle into savings.
The other side of the coin, however, is that businesses need funds if they are going to be 
able to buy investment goods. (Remember, we have assumed that they do not hold onto any 
of the income they receive, but pass it all along to households as wages, proﬁts, interest, or 
rents.) In our simple model we assume that ﬁrms must borrow from the savings put away by 
households in order to be able to ﬁnance investment projects.
You can think of households depositing their savings in banks, with ﬁrms taking out loans 
from the banks to buy structures or equipment. In this way, ﬁrms can reinject funds to the 
spending stream in the form of investment. This “injection” of spending through investment 
is also illustrated in Figure 24.6.
If the amount that households want to save is equal to the amount that ﬁrms want to invest, 
then these two ﬂows will balance each other out:
Figure 24.6 The Output-Income-Spending Flow with Leakages and Injections
When households save 
rather than spend part of 
their incomes, funds are 
diverted from the income-
spending ﬂow. When ﬁrms 
spend on investment goods, 
this creates a ﬂow into the 
spending stream.

MACROECONOMIC MODELING AND AGGREGATE DEMAND 
543
In equilibrium:
leakages = injections
S = II
If the ﬂows are in balance, then Figure 24.6 is just a more complicated version of the 
equilibrium situation portrayed in Figure 24.5. The income-spending ﬂow is more complex, 
but all income still ends up feeding into AD, thus supporting the initial level of output (you 
can mentally ﬁll in the missing part of the circle). This is the kind of equilibrium you might 
encounter while pumping air into an inner tube that has a leak: The inner tube stays the same 
size because you put in more air just as quickly as it is leaking out.
This can be seen mathematically as well. If we add C to each side of the equilibrium 
condition above, we get C + S = C + II. But from the equation that deﬁnes saving (S) above, 
we know that the left side equals Y, while from the deﬁnition of aggregate demand above we 
know that the right side equals AD. Therefore, when leakages equal injections:
In equilibrium:
Y = AD
This equation says that spending is exactly sufﬁcient to buy the output produced—the 
economy is in a macroeconomic equilibrium. But households and ﬁrms are two different 
sectors—what happens if their plans do not mesh?
Suppose that businesses suddenly lose conﬁdence about the future and cut back on their 
plans for expansion (that is, they reduce II). Or suppose that intended investment is unchanged, 
but households suddenly decide to consume less and save more, so that the ﬂow into savings 
is larger than what ﬁrms want to use for investment. In either case, leakages will exceed 
injections. If the savings leakage in Figure 24.6 is larger than the investment injection, the 
result is that AD will be smaller than income and output:
In the case of insufﬁcient aggregate demand:
leakages > injections
S > II
Y > AD
The question mark in Figure 24.6 indicates that planned spending may or may not be 
sufﬁcient to support the existing level of output. If the economy is not in macroeconomic 
equilibrium, something will have to adjust.
Here we reach the dividing point between classical and Keynesian economists. These two 
theories tell very different stories about how this adjustment comes about. We start with the 
classical story.
2.4 THE CLASSICAL SOLUTION TO LEAKAGES
In the classical model, we are essentially in a perfectly balanced world, where output is 
always at its full-employment level. We saw in Chapter 23, looking at business cycles from 
an employment perspective, that classical economists believed that falling wages in ﬂexible 
labor markets would bring the economy back to full employment.
For the moment, we put this labor market story into the background and ask our business 
cycle question in another way: How does an economy (which we assume to be running at a 
full-employment level of production) keep leakages into saving exactly equal to injections 
coming from investment spending? Or, to express this another way, how can the economy 
respond to a sudden shift in saving or intended investment that might cause insufﬁcient (or 
excessive) aggregate demand? The classical argument is again, not surprisingly, that ﬂexible 
markets will keep the economy at a full-employment level of spending and output.

544 
CHAPTER 24 — AGGREGATE DEMAND AND ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
In this case, the relevant market is what economists call the market for loanable funds. 
In our very simple model, households save out of income from current production. Because 
they can earn interest on any savings they deposit in a bank rather than stuff under a mattress, 
they will prefer the bank. In this market, households are the suppliers of loanable funds and 
ﬁrms are the demanders of loanable funds. The classical theory about the market for loanable 
funds is illustrated in Figure 24.7. The vertical axis is the interest rate paid from ﬁrms to 
households, which acts as the “price” of loanable funds.
Classical economists assume that households make their decisions about how much to save by 
looking at the going rate of interest in this market. The higher the interest rate, the more worthwhile 
it is to save, because their savings earn more. The lower the interest rate, the less appealing it is 
to save. So the supply of loanable funds (saving) curve in Figure 24.7 slopes upward.
To ﬁrms, however, the payment of interest is a cost. So when interest rates are low, this 
model assumes, ﬁrms will want to borrow more for investment projects because borrowing 
is inexpensive. High interest rates, in contrast, will discourage ﬁrms from borrowing. The 
demand curve in Figure 24.7 thus slopes downward. Where the curves cross determines 
the equilibrium “price” of funds—here, the interest rate of 5 percent—and the equilibrium 
quantity of funds borrowed and lent.
In Figure 24.7, the amount saved by households and lent out is 140—which is also the 
amount borrowed and invested by ﬁrms.* (All numbers in our simple models are made up 
and set to be easy numbers to handle. You could think of the unit for our numbers for Y, AD, 
C, I, and S as billions of real dollars in a ﬁctional economy.)
In Figure 24.8 we illustrate what happens in the classical model if, after starting from a 
position at point E0 (which we assume corresponds to a full-employment balance of S and 
I), ﬁrms suddenly change their plans, deciding to spend less on investment. The demand for 
loanable funds curve shifts leftward. If the interest rate remained at 5 percent, we would see 
a big drop in investment. But because the interest rate falls to 3 percent, part of the drop 
in investment will be reversed as ﬁrms take advantage of the cheaper loans. And because 
the interest rate is now lower, some households will choose to save less and consume more 
(indicated by the movement downward along the supply curve).
In the end, saving and (both intended and actual) investment will still be equal, though 
at a lower level—in Figure 24.8, the level drops to 60. Aggregate demand will still be equal 
to the full-employment level—though now it is made up of somewhat less investment, and 
somewhat more consumption, than before the shift in investment plans. In short, the fall 
*In the real world, households and institutions, ﬁrms, governments, and the foreign sector all borrow and lend for various reasons, 
and much of the supply and demand for loanable funds reﬂects transactions in existing assets that have little to do with current ﬂows 
of production and income. This model abstracts from these complications to focus on ﬂows of savings and investment.
Figure 24.7 The Classical Model of the Market for Loanable Funds
In the classical version of the 
macroeconomic model, household saving 
creates the supply of loanable funds and 
ﬁrms’ borrowing for investment creates 
the demand for loanable funds. At the 
equilibrium interest rate, the amount 
households save and the amount 
businesses invest are equated.

in intended investment was balanced by an increase in consumer spending (a decrease in 
saving).
In the classical model, both households’ saving activity and ﬁrms’ investment spending 
are assumed to be quite sensitive to changes in the interest rate, which serves as the “price 
of loanable funds.” An adjustment in the interest rate, according to this theory, will quickly 
correct any threat of imbalances between the leakage of savings and the injection of investment. 
The interest rate is assumed to adjust smoothly in a free-market economy.
With saving and intended investment always in balance, there is no reason to think that 
the economy would ever diverge from full employment. The economy is thus self-sustaining 
at full employment due to the smooth working of the market for loanable funds (see Figure 
24.9). We assume (for now) that the level of output that corresponds to full employment is 
clearly known. As we did in Figure 24.4, we use the symbol Y* to denote this full-employment 
level (or range) of output and income.
In the real world, things do not always work out so smoothly (see Box 24.1). This became 
evident in the Great Depression, when the economy clearly did fall into a situation of severe 
and prolonged unemployment. People came to be dissatisﬁed with the classical theory. Could 
there be something wrong with this story? Could another theory do a better job of explaining 
Figure 24.8 Adjustment to a Reduction in Intended Investment in the Classical Model
In the classical model, smooth adjustments in the 
market for loanable funds keep saving equal to 
investment, even if ﬁrms or households change 
their behavior.

the depression—and even better, point toward how the economy might get out of it? This issue 
has particular relevance today, because we have recently been through a similar experience—
stubbornly high unemployment that does not automatically readjust to full employment.
Discussion Questions
1. Who are the actors in this simple macroeconomic model? What is the role of each in 
determining the ﬂow of currently produced goods and services? What is the role of each 
in the classical market for loanable funds?
2. Explain verbally why, in the classical model, the demand for loanable funds curve slopes 
downward. Explain verbally why the supply of loanable funds curve slopes upward.
3. THE KEYNESIAN MODEL
Keynes’ major contribution was to develop a theory to explain why aggregate demand could 
stay persistently low. He called it The General Theory, because he believed that the case of 
full employment (Y*) represents only a special case, one that may not often be achieved. In 
this section we present the basics of his theory using (for the moment) the very simple closed-
economy, no-government, no-growth model introduced above.
3.1 CONSUMPTION
Many things may affect the level of aggregate consumption in an economy, but one thing 
that very clearly affects it is the level of current aggregate income. Households are able to 
spend more on consumption goods and services when the economy is generating a lot of in-
come than they can when it is not (see Box 24.2). So Keynes used in his model a very simple 
consumption function that expresses aggregate consumption as the sum of two components: 
an “autonomous” part and a part that depends on the level of aggregate income. In algebraic 
form, the Keynesian consumption function is expressed as:
BOX 24.1 SMALL BUSINESS LOANS IN THE WAKE OF THE GREAT RECESSION
In the market for loanable funds, banks act as inter-
mediaries between the savings of households and the 
borrowing of businesses. Banks have to determine the 
creditworthiness of businesses seeking loans, based 
on expectations about the overall economy and the 
proﬁt potential of each business applicant.
As you might expect, business lending decreased 
during the global ﬁnancial crisis in 2007–9. In part, 
this was a response to poor macroeconomic conditions 
and a decline in the demand for loans, but another 
factor was that banks increased the stringency of their 
loan requirements. Thus in the aftermath of the crisis, 
banks are generally less willing to provide loans to 
businesses perceived to be credit risks.
Business lending has rebounded more recently 
as macroeconomic conditions improve, but a linger-
ing effect of the crisis is that banks remain particu-
larly reluctant to lend to small businesses. Kenneth 
Walsleben, who teaches at the Whitman School of 
Management at Syracuse University notes: “The days 
of yesteryear when you could go to your corner bank 
are over. Small, emerging, growing businesses have 
few traditional sources to turn to.”
This has produced essentially two separate markets 
for loanable funds. Bill Dunkelberg of the National 
Federation of Independent Business refers to it as a 
“bifurcated economy.” Larger businesses are able to 
obtain traditional loans from banks at favorable interest 
rates, generally around 5–7 percent. Small businesses 
are frequently forced to seek funds from nontraditional 
sources, which tend to impose higher interest rates. For 
example, business “cash advance” loans commonly 
provided to restaurants and other retailers allow the 
lender to receive a percentage of each credit card 
transaction directly. The interest rates on nontraditional 
loans tend to be at least 15 percent, and rates of 30 
percent or more are not uncommon.

where ×C is “autonomous” consumption and mpc is called the “marginal propensity to con-
sume” (explained below). We ﬁrst discuss the economic signiﬁcance of these two parts of 
the function and then put the function to work.
Autonomous consumption is the part of consumption that is not related to income. It can 
be thought of as a minimum level of income that people feel required to spend for basic 
needs. It can also be seen as reﬂecting the amount of consumption spending that people will 
undertake no matter what their current incomes are, reﬂecting their long-term plans, their 
commitments and habits, and their place in the community.
But, of course, much of consumption does reﬂect current income and its changes. The 
term “marginal propensity to consume” (mpc) reﬂects the number of additional dollars of 
consumption spending that occur for every additional dollar of aggregate income. Using the 
notation Δ (the Greek letter delta) to mean “change in,” mpc can be expressed as:
mpc = ΔC /ΔY = (the change of C resulting from a change in Y) ÷ (the change in Y).
In the following example, we use an mpc of 8/10 or 0.8. This means that for 
every additional $10 in aggregate income, households will spend an additional $8 on 
consumption. Logically, the mpc should be no greater than 1. An mpc greater than 1 
would mean that people increase their consumption by more than the addition to their 
income. An mpc of about 0.8 has been the standard, historically, in Keynesian modeling 
exercises—though such a value may not correspond well to actual data on consumption 
in every time period.
Recall that any income not spent by the household sector is saved. Based on the consumption 
function, a savings function can be derived using the equation for savings and substituting 
in the equation for consumption:
S = Y – C = Y – (C + mpc Y) = – C + (1 – mpc) Y
The term (1 – mpc) is called the “marginal propensity to save”:
mps = 1 – mpc = ΔS/ΔY
BOX 24.2 CONSUMER SPENDING RISES WITH INCREASED INCOME 
In June 2013, the Associated Press reported that:
Americans spent more in May as their income 
rose, encouraging signs after a slow start to 
the year. The Commerce department said on 
Thursday that consumer spending rose 0.3 
percent last month, nearly erasing a decline of 
similar size in April. Income rose 0.5 percent. 
Consumers, beneﬁting from low inﬂation, 
spent more at retail businesses in May, notably 
for cars, home improvements and sporting 
goods. The number of people who signed 
contracts to buy homes in the United States 
jumped in May to the highest level in more 
than six years, a sign home sales will probably 
rise in the months ahead.
Economists pay careful attention to trends in 
consumer spending, which represents about 70% of 
aggregate demand in the economy. When income 
rises, consumers tend to spend more. In turn, higher 
consumer spending tends to stimulate further growth 
in the economy. Thus this news in mid-2013 indicated 
a continuing, though slow, economic recovery follow-
ing the recession of 2007–9.

Up,” Associated Press, June 17, 2013.

CHAPTER 24 — AGGREGATE DEMAND AND ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
For example, if households spend 80 percent of additional income, or $8 out of an additional 
$10 in income, then they must save 20 percent (= 100 percent – 80 percent), or $2 out of $10. 
So if the mpc is 0.8, the mps must be 0.2.
If we assign number values to the parameters ×C and mpc, we can express the relation 
between income and consumption stated in the consumption function by a schedule, as in 
Table 24.2. Various income levels are shown in Column (1). For now, we set autonomous 
consumption at 20 (as shown in Column [2]). With an mpc set equal to 0.8, Column (3) shows 
how to calculate the second component of the consumption function. Adding together the 
autonomous and income-related components yields total consumption, shown in Column (4). 
We also show in Column (5), for later reference, the implied level of saving. For example, 
the shaded row indicates that when income is 400, C = 20 + 0.8 (400) = 20 + 320 = 340. 
Saving is calculated as 400 − = 340 = 60. Consumption and saving both rise steadily as 
income rises.

*When the household sector “dissaves,” it depletes assets (or increases debts) in order to pay for consumption. In this case, 
consumption exceeds income, and savings are negative. This has happened, at a national level, in only two periods in U.S. history: 
ﬁrst during the Great Depression, and then again in 2005, when people were feeling wealthy because of large increases in the value 
of their homes. In 1984, U.S. households saved 10.8 percent of their after-tax income; in 2005 the ﬁgure was −0.5 percent; in 2007 
the ﬁgure was positive but less than 1 percent. After 2008, households started to save more in an effort to reduce debt.
We can also see the relationships among consumption, income, and saving in this model 
in the graph in Figure 24.10. (For a review of graphing techniques, see Box 24.3.) The 
horizontal axis measures income (Y) while the vertical axis measures consumption (C). The 
consumption function crosses the vertical axis at the level of autonomous consumption (×C) 
of 20. The line has a slope equal to the mpc of 0.8. Figure 24.10 also includes a 45° line, 
which tells us what consumption would be if people consumed all their income instead of 
saving part of it. So the vertical distance between the 45° “consumption = income” line and 
the consumption function tells us how much people save. We can see, for example, that at 
an income of 100, households, in this model, consume all their income. At levels of income 
lower than 100, consumption is higher than income, and they “dissave.”* At an income of 
400, how much do people save? Check for yourself that the information given in Table 24.2 
and Figure 24.10 for income levels of 0, 100, and 400 are in agreement.
A number of factors can cause the consumption schedule for a macroeconomy to change. 
Among the signiﬁcant ones are:

 
THE KEYNESIAN MODEL 
549
s  Wealth. When many people in a country feel wealthier—perhaps because the stock market 
or housing prices are high—the household sector as a whole may tend to spend more, even 
if households’ actual annual incomes do not change.
s  Consumer conﬁdence. When people feel less conﬁdent about the future—perhaps due to 
political turmoil or the fear of a coming recession—they may tend to hunker down and 
spend less on consumption goods.
s  Attitudes toward spending and saving. If many people decided to consume less for reasons 
of health, cultural shifts, or the environment, consumption would also be depressed.
s  Consumption-related government policies. High levels of saving can be a source of capital 
for economic growth. Sometimes, a country’s leaders will urge people to lower their con-
sumption levels and raise their saving levels, in order to provide funds for investing in the 
future. (An exercise at the end of this chapter asks you to look at some implications of such 
a policy.) At other times, leaders urge people (especially in the United States) to consume, 
in order to boost the economy. Tax systems may be designed to encourage saving, or to 
encourage certain types of consumption.
s  The distribution of income. Poorer people tend to spend more of their income than richer 
people, because just covering necessities can take most or all of their income (or more, 
forcing them into debt). So a redistribution of income from richer people to poorer people 
tends to raise consumption and depress saving.
Some of these factors may be best thought of as changing ×C in the Keynesian consumption 
function, causing the consumption schedule to shift up or down, while others may change 
the mpc, causing the schedule to become steeper or ﬂatter. 
BOX 24.3 GRAPHING WITH A SLOPE-INTERCEPT EQUATION
Linear equations are of the form Y = a + b X. On a 
graph the variable Y is measured on the vertical axis 
and the variable X is measured on the horizontal axis. 
X and Y are called “variables” and a and b are called 
“parameters.” The parameter a is called “the intercept” 
and shows where the line representing the linear rela-
tionship between X and Y crosses the vertical axis. The 
parameter b is “the slope,” and determines the steepness 
of the line. It reﬂects “rise over run”: that is, starting from 
any point on the line and moving to any other point off 
to the right on the same line, the slope is the ratio of the 
number of units the line moves upwards (rises) to the 
number of units the line moves sideways (runs). 
The consumption function, C = C + mpc Y, is of this 
same form, only with different variable and parameter 
names. The consumption function relates the variable 
C to the variable Y. It has an intercept of C  and a 
slope of mpc.
Figure 24.10 The Keynesian Consumption Function
In the Keynesian model, consumption 
rises with income according to the 
equation C = C + mpc Y

CHAPTER 24 — AGGREGATE DEMAND AND ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
Note that the classical model assumes that people make their decisions about how much 
income to consume and how much to save based largely on the interest rate, but the Keynesian 
model does not mention the interest rate because the effects of interest rates on saving are, in 
fact, ambiguous. If you saw that a very high interest rate is prevailing in the loanable funds 
market, you might want to take advantage of it and increase your rate of saving, at least for 
a while. In this case, you would be acting as classical economists assume: A higher interest 
rate causes you to save more and consume less.
But what if you are saving primarily to ﬁnance your college education or your retirement, 
so you have a certain target level of accumulated wealth in mind? A higher interest rate also 
means that you can reach this target faster (and so revert to higher consumption sooner) or 
that you can reach the target in the same amount of time while saving less. Common sense 
suggests that the amount that people save depends mainly on their ability to save, based on their 
income as well as their needs and plans, rather than primarily on the current interest rate.
In fact, a more signiﬁcant impact of changes in interest rates on household behavior comes 
from their effect on what households may pay in interest, rather than on what households 
earn. While the simple classical model assumes that households are only on the saving and 
lending side of the market, in reality households frequently borrow to spend on capital goods 
for household production. When interest rates are high, households may postpone buying 
houses, cars, major appliances, and other consumer durables.
In any case, the simple Keynesian function that we are working with leaves out the interest 
rate entirely. The most important thing to remember about the Keynesian consumption function 
is that some income generally “leaks” into saving (and so does not create aggregate demand) 
and that, unlike in the classical model, the interest rate is not considered an important factor 
in determining the size of this leakage.
3.2 INVESTMENT
In the real world, ﬁrms may take into account a number of things when thinking about how much 
to invest. The cost of borrowing (the interest rate) is certainly one factor, as are other things, such 
as the prices of investment goods, their own accumulated assets and debt, and the willingness of 
people to lend to them. (Not everyone can qualify for a loan.) Keynes thought that, in general, 
interest rates were somewhat important in explaining the level of investment. But he argued that, 
in the case of a severe slowdown of economic activity such as the Great Depression, a low interest 
rate would not be enough to motivate business ﬁrms to invest in building up new capacity.
The most important factor in explaining aggregate investment spending, Keynes thought, is 
the general level of optimism or pessimism that investors feel about the future, or what he called 
“animal spirits.” If ﬁrms’ managers believe that they will be able to sell more of the goods or 
services that they produce in the future, and at a good price, they will want to invest in equipment 
and structures to maintain and expand their capacity. If they do not see such a rosy future ahead, 
then why would even a very low interest rate persuade them to invest? The borrowed funds will 
have to be repaid; the major question for the borrower is “are my prospects for success good 
enough to allow me to repay this loan?” The interest rate will marginally change the amount to 
be repaid but is not the major determinant of the answer to this question.
Because Keynes saw investment as future directed, rather than related to any current, 
observable economic variables, the “function” for intended investment in the simple Keynesian 
model just says that investors intend to invest whatever investors intend to invest. All of 
intended investment is considered “autonomous” in this model. We can denote this as:
I1 = ×II
where ×II is “autonomous intended investment.” Don’t worry too much about whether to put a 
bar over the symbol—we have introduced it here just to show you that it is similar in concept 

 
THE KEYNESIAN MODEL 
551
to the ×C in the consumption function. Just as ×C can go up or down depending on consumer 
conﬁdence, ×II can go up or down depending on investor conﬁdence.
Figure 24.11 graphs investment against income, for the case where ×II = 60. Because 
investment does not depend on income, the graph is horizontal. The lack of attention to 
interest rates is a limitation of the simple Keynesian model. In later chapters, we depart from 
this simpliﬁcation and consider the effects of interest rates on investment.
3.3 THE AGGREGATE DEMAND SCHEDULE
Earlier we deﬁned AD as the sum of consumption and intended investment. We can now add 
intended investment to the consumption schedule and curve to get a schedule and graph for 
aggregate demand. In Table 24.3, Columns (1) and (2) just repeat Table 24.2. In Column (3) 
we have set intended investment at 60, for any level of income, in line with the notion that it 
is all “autonomous.” Column (4) calculates the level of aggregate intended spending in the 
economy. We can see that when, for example, Y = 400, households and businesses together 
plan to spend 400 on consumption and investment.
Figure 24.12 shows the relationship between income and aggregate demand. The AD line lies 
exactly 60 units vertically above the C line, at every level of income. Its intercept is the sum of 
autonomous consumption and intended investment. Its slope is the same as that of the consumption 
function. We can see that when, for example, Y = 400, then C = 340 and AD = 400.
The AD curve shifts up or down as autonomous consumption or autonomous investment 
changes. Suppose that intended investment is 140, instead of 60. Table 24.4 calculates AD for 
Figure 24.11 The Keynesian Investment Function
In the simplest Keynesian model, intended investment 
is a constant, no matter what the level of national 
income, being determined instead by long-term proﬁt 
expectations.

3.4 THE POSSIBILITY OF UNINTENDED INVESTMENT
The key to the Keynesian model is understanding why and how unintended investment can occur 
and how ﬁrms respond when they see it happening. Unintended investment occurs when aggregate 
demand is insufﬁcient, because ﬁrms will not be able to sell all the goods that they produce.
Recall (from Chapter 20) that a country’s manufactured capital stock includes structures, 
equipment, and inventories. Many ﬁrms normally plan to keep as inventory a level of supplies 
that they expect to use soon and products that they have not yet shipped. Unintended inventory 
investment occurs when these inventories build up unexpectedly. A manufacturing ﬁrm, for 
example, experiences excess inventory accumulation when it cannot sell its goods as quickly 
Figure 24.13 Aggregate Demand with Higher 
Intended Investment
If intended investment increases (or autonomous 
consumption increases), the aggregate demand curve 
shifts upward.

selected levels of income like those that we used before, but at this higher level of II. Because 
neither ×C nor the mpc has changed, Column (2) is the same as in earlier tables.
This aggregate demand schedule is graphed in Figure 24.13. The intercept is now 160, 
which is equal to ×C of 20 plus ×II of 140, while the slope is still equal to the mpc. Notice that 
now, at an income level of 400, aggregate demand is 480 instead of 400. With investment 
increased by 80, aggregate demand at any income level increases by 80 as well.
Figure 24.13 could also be used to illustrate an increase in ×C from 20 to 100 (an increase 
of 80) while intended investment remains at 60. Any combination of ×C and ×II that sums to 
160 would yield this graph. In economic terms, any increase in autonomous consumer and 
investor desired spending increases aggregate demand.

 
THE KEYNESIAN MODEL 
553
as expected and the goods pile up in warehouses. Conversely, a ﬁrm that sells its goods faster 
than expected experiences excess inventory depletion, as the goods “ﬂy off the shelves” and 
the warehouse empties out.
Actual investment (I, as measured in the national accounts) is the sum of what businesses plan to 
invest, plus what they inadvertently end up investing if AD and Y do not match up exactly:
I = intended investment (II) + excess inventory accumulation or depletion
In Table 24.5, Columns (1) and (2) repeat information from Table 24.3, for intended 
investment of 60 and selected levels of income. Column (3) calculates levels of unintended 
investment. If, for example, income and output are 600, but aggregate demand is only 560, 
excess inventory accumulation of 40 will occur. Or, if income and output are 300, but ﬁrms 
and households want to buy 320, inventories will be depleted by 20 to meet the demand. Only 
at an income level of 400 is there a balance between income and spending.
Columns (4) to (6) are included in Table 24.5 to show that both the equation AD = C + II 
and the identity Y = C + I hold at all times in this model. Column (5) of Table 24.5 calculates 
actual investment (I) as the sum of intended and unintended investment. Notice that the ﬁgures 
in Column (6) match those in Column (1)—when we include unintended, excess inventory 
accumulation or depletion, the basic macroeconomic identity Y = C + I is still true.
Figure 24.14—often called the “Keynesian cross” diagram—illustrates this case for two 
income levels. The AD curve, as we know, represents the sum of consumption and investment at

CHAPTER 24 — AGGREGATE DEMAND AND ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
any income level. The dashed line is a 45° line that (as in our earlier diagram about consumption, 
income, and saving) illustrates equality between the values on the two axes. With income on 
the horizontal axis and output on the vertical axis, all points on this 45° line represent situations 
where output equals income. At an income level of 800, the AD curve indicates that aggregate 
demand is 720. But the “output = income” line indicates that output is 800 and so exceeds 
spending. There is unintended inventory build-up of 80, as indicated by the vertical distance 
between the AD curve and the 45° line, at this income level. (Check to see that this is consistent 
with Table 24.5.)
At an income level of 400, where the AD line crosses the 45° line, there is full 
macroeconomic equilibrium, because output, income, and spending are all at the same level. 
Unintended investment is 0.
At levels of income and output above 400 in Table 24.5 and Figure 24.14, business ﬁrms’ 
managers are unhappy because more and more of their goods are gathering dust. For levels 
of income and output below 400, their inventories are being depleted below intended levels. 
These are not equilibrium levels of income, and the economy will not stay at any of those 
income levels—things will change.
3.5 MOVEMENT TO EQUILIBRIUM IN THE KEYNESIAN MODEL
If ﬁrms are unhappy about unsold goods, they will do something to correct the situation. 
If inventories are building up more than intended, they will cut back on production. Their 
cutbacks in production will continue until they are no longer seeing inventories build up 
excessively—that is, until the level of what is actually produced matches what they can sell. 
Reductions in Y will continue until Y = AD. This is a little more complicated than it may at 
ﬁrst seem, though, since any reduction in output leads to reduced income, which leads to 
reduced consumption, so that AD is a moving target. We look at this complication below in 
Section 3.7, but for now we continue with the main story.
In Figure 24.14, above, suppose that the economy were (for reasons explored later) initially 
at an income and output level of 800. From the ﬁgure and Table 24.5, we can see that this 
is not an equilibrium—producers are seeing excess inventory accumulation of 80 because 
AD is only 720. Producers will cut back on production. The equilibrium point E is obtained 
when aggregate output has fallen to 400 and AD has also fallen to 400.
So, what has happened here? If you look back at Table 24.2, you can see that at the initial 
income level of 800, there was a “leakage” into saving of 140. But ﬁrms, we have assumed, 
only want to spend 60 on investment. Leakages exceeded injections by 80, aggregate demand 
was insufﬁcient, and inventories of 80 built up. Firms cut back on production. They continued 
to cut back until inventories were back where they wanted them.
Yet when the economy arrives at an equilibrium, the balance between saving and investing 
has been restored! Why is this so? Intended investment has not changed—it has been at 60 all 
along. But now that income has dropped, households have less income to use for consumption 
and saving, and so saving has dropped from its initial level of 140 to only 60. (See Table 24.2 
to check that this is the level of saving at an income level of 400.) It is changes in aggregate 
income, and the resulting changes in consumption and saving, that have caused leakages and 
injections to become equal again.
We can also see in the schedules and graphs what would happen if AD were for some 
reason to be above the current level of output. If output were to start out at 300, for example, 
desired spending of 320 (see Table 24.5) would cause produced goods to “ﬂy off the 
shelves” and deplete inventories. According to this model, this situation would motivate 
ﬁrms to increase production. As production rises, income, consumption, and saving would 
also all rise. Again, equilibrium would be reached when Y and AD both equal 400, and S 
and I both equal 60.

 
THE KEYNESIAN MODEL 
555
3.6 THE PROBLEM OF PERSISTENT UNEMPLOYMENT
Now that the pieces of the model have been explained, the model can be put together to il-
lustrate what Keynes taught about the Great Depression. Assume that 800 represents the full-
employment level of output for this economy, as illustrated by the vertical “full-employment 
range” Y* in Figure 24.15. If intended investment is 140 (the higher AD line in Figure 24.15), 
the economy is at an initial full-employment equilibrium at E0. (Refer back to Table 24.4 and 
Figure 24.13 to conﬁrm that at this level of income Y = AD.)
Figure 24.15 Full Employment Equilibrium with High Intended Investment
Supposing that Y = 800 represents full 
employment, an intended investment level 
of 140 generates spending sufﬁcient to 
maintain this as an equilibrium.

But at the start of the Great Depression, the 1929 stock market crash and other events 
caused business and investor conﬁdence to plummet. (Consumer conﬁdence and ﬁnancial 
wealth also plummeted, but we are simplifying the story by concentrating on ﬁrms.) Producers 
became very uncertain about whether they would be able to sell what they produced, so they 
cut back radically on their investment spending. This is modeled in Figure 24.16 as a drop 
in aggregate demand caused by a drop in intended investment from 140 to 60. (Note that 60 
is the number used in Table 24.3, so that AD1 in Figure 24.16 is identical to the AD curve in 
Figure 24.12.) With the drop in AD, income of 800 is no longer an equilibrium. Consistent 
with the adjustments toward equilibrium that we just discussed, output, income, and spending 
contract until a new equilibrium (E1) is reached at a level of 400.
Figure 24.16 A Keynesian Unemployment Equilibrium
A fall in investor conﬁdence causes the 
equilibrium level of output to fall. The initial 
excess of leakages over injections caused 
by low investment spending is corrected by 
a contraction in output, income, and saving. 
At E1, leakages and injections are again 
equal.

CHAPTER 24 — AGGREGATE DEMAND AND ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
An income and output level of 400, however, is far below the level of production required 
to provide full employment for workers. Massive unemployment results. And in the Keynesian 
model, there is no automatic mechanism (as there was in the classical model) that rescues the 
economy from this situation. The economy experiences a contraction, settling at a new, persistent, 
self-reinforcing, low-income, and high-unemployment equilibrium, as shown in Figure 24.17.
To say that a macroeconomy is “in equilibrium” just means that output, income, and 
spending are in balance. The basic idea about an equilibrium is that there tend to be forces 
(such as, in this model, ﬁrms’ desire to avoid unintended inventories) that are likely to push 
an economy toward equilibrium and tend to keep it there after it is achieved. But achievement 
of an equilibrium is not the same thing as full employment—the equilibrium level at which 
output, income, and spending balance may or may not be at full employment.
In Keynes’s view, there was nothing that would “naturally” or “automatically” happen to pull 
an economy out of such a low-employment situation. A full-employment equilibrium such as E0 
in Figure 24.15 is possible, but it is merely one of a large number of possible equilibria (seen in 
the model as different points along the 45° line). Equally possible is a persistent unemployment 
equilibrium such as E1 in Figure 24.16. Because Keynes, unlike classical economists, did not 
equate equilibrium with full employment, he believed that there is often a need for action to 
stimulate aggregate demand. Such policies are the topics of Chapters 25 and 27.
3.7 THE MULTIPLIER
In the example above, intended investment dropped from 140 to 60 because of a fall in inves-
tor conﬁdence—a decline of 80 units. But output dropped from 800 to 400—a decline of 400 
units. Why is the decline in output so much bigger than the decline in investment spending 
that caused it?
The intuition behind this result is that, while the drop in investment spending leads to 
a drop in aggregate demand, which leads directly to a contraction in output, there are also 
feedback effects through consumption. Because consumption depends on income, and income 
depends on AD, which depends on consumption, additional effects “echo” back and forth. For 
example, reducing production in a factory does not merely involve laying off assembly-line 
workers. The laid-off factory workers now have less income to spend at stores. This means 
that the stores will also need to lay off some of their employees, who then also have less 
income. And so on. This process is illustrated in more detail in Table 24.6.
In the ﬁrst row of Table 24.6, for example, the drop in intended investment (step 1) leads to 
an immediate drop in AD of 80 (step 2). Firms see inventories piling up and cut back production 
by 80. But this decreases the income going to households, because ﬁrms are now paying less 
in wages, interest, dividends, and rents. Consumers react (in step 3) to a change in income 
according to the relationship ΔC = mpc ΔY. With 80 less in income, they reduce their spending

An excess of leakages over injections 
causes aggregate demand to be insufﬁcient 
for a full employment level of output. Output 
and income fall until equilibrium is restored.

spending by 64 but their income went down by 80? See if you can think of the answer before 
you check the footnote.*
The second and later rows show how decreases in consumption decrease aggregate demand, 
output, and income, and thus depress consumption even further. Note that in each round, the 
decrease in Y gets a little smaller. Fortunately, a convenient result from mathematics means 
that we do not need to calculate the sum of all these changes in Y by continuing to extend the 
table, row after row (in theory, forever—although the numbers get very tiny after a while).** 
A result from the mathematics of inﬁnite series implies that, in the end, the total change in 
Y is related in the following way to the original change in II:
ΔY = 
1
Δ ×II
1 – mpc
which means, in this case,
ΔY =
1
(–80) =
1
(–80) = 5(–80) = –400
1 – .08

The expression 1/(1 – mpc) is called “the income/spending multiplier”—or, for short, the 
multiplier—and is abbreviated mult:
 *They economize by reducing both consumption and saving. They reduce their saving by 16 (which corresponds to the 
remaining 20 percent of the income change).
**Column 2 of the table can be summarized as:  
ΔY = 1 + mpc Δ ×II + mpc (mpc Δ ×II) + mpc (mpc (mpc Δ ×II)) + . . .
    = (1 + mpc + mpc2 + mpc3 +. . . . ) Δ ×II 
But the inﬁnite series (1 + x + x2 + x3 + x4 + . . . + x∞) where x < 1 can be simpliﬁed to 1/(1 – x)

In this case, with mpc = 0.8, the multiplier is 5. The initial decrease in intended investment 
causes, in the end, a decrease in income that is ﬁve times its size. We can express this 
mathematically as ΔY = mult Δ×I
The value of the multiplier would be the same if it had been a decrease in consumer conﬁdence, 
acting through a change in ×C that started this cascade in incomes, instead of a decrease in investor 
conﬁdence. Mathematically, this means ΔY = mult Δ×C as well. In Chapter 25, we add consideration 
of other factors that change aggregate demand, other than investor and consumer conﬁdence.
Discussion Questions
1. If you received a raise of $100 per month, how would you increase your spending per month? 
How much would you change your saving? What is your mpc? What is your mps?
2. Describe verbally how, in the Keynesian model, an economy can end up in an equilibrium 
of persistent unemployment.
4. CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
In classical economic theory, an economy should never go into a slump—or at least it should not 
stay in one very long. Any deﬁciency in aggregate demand would be quickly counteracted by 
smooth adjustments in the market for loanable funds. Keynes, by contrast, theorized that deﬁciencies 
in aggregate demand, due to drops in investor (or consumer) conﬁdence, could explain the deep, 
long-term slumps that many countries experienced during the Great Depression (as well as some 
of the other economic depressions that various economies have experienced throughout history). 
Modern Keynesians argue that this theory also explains the Great Recession that began in 2007.
Any excess of “leakages” over “injections” into the aggregate demand stream would, 
Keynes theorized, lead to progressive rounds of declines in consumption and income, until 
savings are so low that a new, lower-output-level equilibrium is established. He believed 
that some kind of government action was required to get the economy out of its slump and 
to achieve a higher equilibrium level. In Chapter 25, we explore how the U.S. economy did, 
in fact, get out of the Great Depression, as well as some of the policies that were instituted 
in response to the Great Recession.
It is also worth taking a moment to consider the implications of this model as it relates to 
contemporary controversies over consumerism and the environment. In the Keynesian model, it 
does, indeed, appear that keeping consumption and spending at high levels is necessary to keep 
the economy humming. The idea that cutting back on consumption spending would be “bad 
for the economy” is based on the Keynesian notion that reductions in aggregate spending lead 
to recessions or depressions and that these could potentially be deep and persistent. Would our 
cutting back on the kinds of consumption that are environmentally damaging lead to recession 
and job losses? Or could we perhaps substitute other kinds of economic activity and job creation? 
We revisit this assumption in later chapters to see whether it really is the case that what is good 
for the environment (and for future generations) has to be “bad for the economy.”
Discussion Questions

economy? Explain why.
2. Have you ever read articles or editorials that claim that high consumption is essential for 
a healthy economy? Does the Keynesian model seem to conﬁrm or challenge this idea? 
What are some arguments for the opposite point of view?

out.
a. Suppose that the economy starts out in a situ-
ation we already developed in the text: ×C = 20 
+ .8Y and II = 60 (see Table 24.3). Carefully 
graph the resulting AD curve, labeling the 
levels of aggregate demand that result when

initial case? What is the equilibrium level of 
saving?
c. Now suppose that people decide they want to 
save more of their income and spend less of it. In 
fact, their new level of autonomous consumption 
is 0, so the new consumption function is just C =

gregate demand that would result from incomes 
of 0, 300, 400, and 500. (You might want to set

APPENDIX: AN ALGEBRAIC APPROACH TO THE MULTIPLIER 
561
APPENDIX: AN ALGEBRAIC APPROACH TO THE MULTIPLIER
The formula for the multiplier in the simplest Keynesian model can also be derived using 
tools of basic algebra, starting with rearranging the equation for AD:
 
AD =  C + ×II
We can substitute in the Keynesian equation for consumption, C = ×C + mpc Y, and use the 
fact that in this model all investment is autonomous, to get
 
AD = (×C + mpc Y ) + ×II
 
= (×C + ×II) + mpc Y
The last rearrangement shows that the AD curve has an intercept equal to the sum of the 
autonomous terms and a slope equal to the mpc. Changes in either of the variable in parentheses, 
by changing the intercept, shift the curve upward or downward in a parallel manner.
By substituting this into the equation for the equilibrium condition, Y = AD, we can derive 
an expression for equilibrium income in terms of all the other variables in the model:
 
Y = (×C + ×II) + mpc Y
 
Y – mpc Y = ×C + ×II
 
(1 – mpc) Y = ×C + II
Y =
1
(×C + ×II)
(1 – mpc)
If autonomous consumption or intended investment increases, these each increase 
equilibrium income by mult =1/(1 – mpc) times the change in autonomous consumption or 
investment.

CHAPTER 24 — AGGREGATE DEMAND AND ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
To see this explicitly, consider the changes that would come about in Y if there is a change 
in ×II from ×II0 to a new level, ×II1, while autonomous consumption (and the mpc) stays the same. 
We can solve for the change in Y by subtracting the old equation from the new one:
Y1 =
1
(×C + ×II1)
1 – mpc
– Y0 = 
1
(×C + ×II0)
1 – mpc
Y1 – Y0= 
1
(×C – ×C + ×II1 – ×II0)
1 – mpc
But ×C (and the mpc) is unchanged, so the ﬁrst subtraction in parentheses comes out to be 
0. We are left with:
Y1 – Y0= 
1
(×II1 – ×II0)
1 – mpc
or
ΔY = multΔ ×II
where mult = 1/(1 − mpc). Similar analysis of Δ×C (holding intended investment constant) 
would show that the multiplier for that change is also mult.

25 Fiscal Policy
The recession that began in the United States in 2007 was the most severe and long-lasting 
since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Even after the economy started to recover, growth 
was slow and job creation weak, with unemployment remaining over 7 percent through 2013. 
This led to a wide-ranging, and continuing, debate over the best way for government to respond 
to the recession and its aftermath. An immediate response put in place by the Obama admin-
istration in 2009 was a policy of economic stimulus through expanded government spending 
and tax cuts. The “stimulus package” involved more than $800 billion in new government 
spending and reduced taxes. This was followed by further tax cuts over the next two years, 
including a temporary two-percentage-point payroll tax holiday in 2011 and 2012.
The commonsense idea behind these policies is that more spending, either by government 
or by individuals and families who receive tax cuts, will create demand for goods and thereby 
expand employment and output. In terms of the macroeconomic theory sketched out in 
Chapter 24, these policies are intended to increase aggregate demand, generating positive 
multiplier effects.
The stimulus policy drew immediate criticism, especially from conservative economists 
and politicians, who argued that these policies would increase the deﬁcit and national debt 
and would not be effective in helping the economy to recover. Proponents of the stimulus 
responded that it was essential to prevent an already very weak economy from slipping into 
Great Depression–like conditions. As you can see, in terms of economic theory, this argument 
reﬂects the difference between classical and Keynesian views of how economies operate. A 
similar debate raged in Europe between advocates of “austerity” policies aimed at balancing 
budgets and reducing debt and those who argued that in a time of high unemployment the 
main priority should be expanding economic activity.
We return to the speciﬁcs of these debates—and an evaluation of the results of economic 
stimulus and of austerity policies—in future chapters. Our goal in this chapter is to develop 
a basic theory of government spending and taxes and their effects on the economy, using the 
principles of aggregate demand and the multiplier developed in Chapter 24.
1. THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND TAXES
Economists often disagree about which tax and spending policies are best in different eco-
nomic situations. These debates are over ﬁscal policy—what government spends, how it gets 
the money that it spends, and the effects of these activities on GDP levels. To understand 
these issues, we need to extend the simple macroeconomic model of Chapter 24 to include 
the role of government.
If the role of the government is added, the equation for aggregate demand used in previous 
chapters becomes:
AD = C + II + G
ﬁscal policy: govern-
ment spending and 
tax policy

564 
CHAPTER 25 — FISCAL POLICY
Government spending on goods and services, including spending by federal, state, and local 
governments (G) is added to aggregate demand (AD). Taxes do not appear directly in this equation, 
but, as we will see, they have an impact through their effect on consumption spending.
We examine the effects of these changes to our model one at a time, starting with the 
impact of a change in government spending.
1.1 A CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT SPENDING
Government spending has a direct impact on the level of GDP. Government purchases of 
goods and services increase aggregate demand, boosting equilibrium output. In Chapter 24, 
we showed how a decline in intended investment (II) lowered the AD line, leading to equi-
librium at a lower level of income. This suggests that government spending might be used as 
an antidote to low investment spending.
Suppose that we start with the macroeconomic equilibrium presented in Table 24.5 and 
Figure 24.16 in Chapter 24. Remember that this was an unemployment equilibrium. If we 
start at an unemployment equilibrium, additional aggregate demand will be needed to return 
to full employment. Our ﬁrst model assumed no government role; hence initial government 
spending equals 0. Thus a simple policy would be to increase government spending on goods 
and services from 0 to 80. As you can see in Table 25.1 and Figure 25.1, the addition of 80 
units of government spending causes the equilibrium to shift up by 400, to the full employment 
Y* of 800. Why does this happen?

Figure 25.1 Increased Government Spending
An increase in government spending 
has a similar effect to an increase 
in private ﬁxed investment. It shifts 
the AD line upward, as government 
spending rises. This increases the 
equilibrium levels of income and 
output. The increase in Y is larger 
than that of G because of the 
multiplier effect, which occurs due to 
the induced consumption that occurs 
as the economy expands along the 
AD line.

THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND TAXES 
565
Let’s look at a simple example—a new building construction program. Government money 
is spent on goods such as concrete and steel as well as paying workers. This directly creates 
new aggregate demand. In addition, there are multiplier effects—construction workers will 
use their incomes to buy all kinds of consumer goods and services. The multiplier effects add 
to the original economic stimulus resulting from the government spending.
The effect is exactly the same as the multiplier for intended investment that we discussed in 
Chapter 24. The initial change in government spending (ΔG) becomes income to individuals 
(ΔY), which leads to a round of consumer spending (ΔC) equal to (mpc*ΔY), which in turn 
becomes income to other individuals, leading to another round of consumer spending, and 
so forth. The whole process can be summarized using the same formula as in Chapter 24, 
but now applied to government spending rather than intended investment:
Δ
Δ
Y
mpc
G
=
−
1
1
or:
 
 
 
 
          ΔY = mult ΔG
Using the same mpc and multiplier as before (we had chosen the example where mpc = 0.8, 
resulting in mult = 5) allows us to predict the impact of government spending on economic 
equilibrium. The multiplier applies to government spending in exactly the same way that 
it does to changes in intended investment. Therefore an increase in government spending 
of 80 leads to an equilibrium shift of 80  5 = 400. Looking at it the other way, if we start 
with the goal of an increase of 400 in Y, we can divide 400 by 5 to ﬁnd the needed quantity 
of ΔG: 400/5 = 80.
Note that at the original AD level, there is an equilibrium at 400, where AD = Y, and 
there is signiﬁcant unemployment. After the addition of 80 in government spending (G), 
the new equilibrium is at the full-employment level of 800, where AD1 = Y. (You can check 
other levels in the table to make sure that it is the only level at which AD1 = Y.) Figure 
25.1 shows the same thing graphically. The aggregate demand schedule moves up by 80 
at each level of income, so that the horizontal intercept of the AD line moves up from 80 
to 160. The slope of the AD line remains the same, since there has been no change in the 
mpc. The change in equilibrium income is equal to the change in government spending 
times the multiplier.
Using the multiplier, we can easily calculate the effect of further changes in government 
spending. For example, suppose that government spending were reduced from 80 to 60. This 
negative change of 20 in G would lead to a change of (5  –20 = –100) in equilibrium Y. 
Income would fall from 800 to 700.
So we can see that an increase in government spending will raise the level of economic 
equilibrium, while a decrease in government spending will lower it. The multiplier effect, 
which is the same size in both directions, gives the policy extra “bang for the buck”—in 
this case, a change in government spending leads to ﬁve times as great a change in national 
income.
While we have used a multiplier of 5 to illustrate our hypothetical example, in real life 
the multiplier is rarely this large (as we will see later in the chapter and also in the algebraic 
presentation in Appendix A2), but there will usually be some multiplier effects from a change 
in government spending. Econometric studies of the U.S. economy generally indicate a 
multiplier effect of 2.0 or less.
1.2 TAXES AND TRANSFER PAYMENTS
To complete the picture of ﬁscal policy, we need to include the role of taxes and transfer 
payments. If voters and government ofﬁcials do not want to raise government spending on 

566 
CHAPTER 25 — FISCAL POLICY
goods and services, they have another option. To raise GDP, the government could cut taxes 
or increase transfer payments. Transfer payments are government grants, subsidies, or gifts 
to individuals or ﬁrms. Examples of transfer payments include unemployment insurance and 
Social Security payments, payments of interest to holders of government bonds, and subsidies 
to, for example, energy or agricultural corporations.
In recent decades, the ﬁscal tool most often chosen by policymakers has been tax 
reductions. (Tax reductions, of course, tend to be politically popular in addition to providing 
economic stimulus.) Increases in transfer payments would have the same general positive 
effect on aggregate demand. The opposite policies—increasing taxes or decreasing transfer 
payments—would have a negative effect on economic equilibrium, similar to a reduction in 
government spending.
Changes in taxes and transfer payments, however, do not have exactly the same effect 
as changes in government spending on goods and services. The mechanism by which tax 
and transfer changes affect output differs from the process discussed above for government 
spending. While government purchases directly affect aggregate demand and GDP, the 
effect of taxes and transfer payments is indirect, based on their effect on consumption or 
investment. There are many kinds of taxes and transfers, including corporate taxes, tariffs, 
and inheritance taxes, but we focus here on the effects of changes in personal income taxes 
and transfers to individuals.
For example, let’s say consumers receive a tax cut of 50. If they spent it all, that would 
add 50 to aggregate demand. But according to the “marginal propensity to consume” 
(mpc) principle, consumers are likely to use a portion of the tax cut to increase saving 
or reduce debt. With the mpc of 0.8 that we used for our basic model in Chapter 24, 
the portion saved will be 0.2  50 = 10, leaving 40 for increased consumption. Thus 
the effect on aggregate demand would be only 40, not 50 (since saving is not part of 
aggregate demand).
The same logic would hold if consumers received extra transfer income of 50. They would 
spend only 40, and save 10. The reverse would be true for a tax increase or a cut in transfer 
payments. With a tax increase or beneﬁt cut of 50, individuals and families would have less 
to spend and would reduce their consumption by 40.
Economists deﬁne disposable income (Yd) as the income available to consumers after 
paying taxes and receiving transfers:
Yd = Y – T + TR
where T is the total of taxes paid in the economy and TR is the total of transfer payments 
from governments to individuals.
Changes in taxes or transfer payments directly affect disposable income but only indirectly 
affect consumption and aggregate demand. Hence their impact on economic equilibrium is 
less than that of government spending, which affects aggregate demand directly.
For this reason, the multiplier effects of changes in taxes and transfer payments are smaller 
than the multiplier impacts of government spending. If taxes are “lump sum”—that is, set at 
a ﬁxed level that does not change with income, then we can write T = ×T. The tax multiplier 
for a lump sum tax works in two stages. In the ﬁrst stage, consumption is reduced by mpc 
(Δ×T), which can be expressed as:
ΔC = – (mpc) Δ×T
In the second stage, this reduction in consumption has the regular multiplier effect on 
equilibrium income. The combined effect can be expressed as:
ΔY = (mult) ΔC = – (mult) (mpc) Δ×T
transfer payments: 
payments by govern-
ment to individuals 
or ﬁrms, including 
Social Security pay-
ments, unemployment 
compensation, inter-
est payments, and 
subsidies

in a lump sum tax on

expressed mathemati-
cally as ΔY/Δ×T(mult)
(mpc)

 
THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND TAXES 
567
The tax multiplier is equal to ΔY/Δ×T = –(mult)(mpc). Mathematically, (mult)(mpc) 
always works out to exactly 1.0 less than the regular multiplier. (You can use the multiplier 
formula from Chapter 24 to work out why this is true.) Using the ﬁgures from our previous 
example, where mpc = 0.8 and mult = 5, the tax multiplier would be –(0.8)  5 = –4. (For 
a more detailed algebraic account of the tax multiplier for a lump sum tax, see Appendix 
A1.)
Just as a tax increase has a contractionary effect, a tax cut will have an expansionary effect. 
Historically, tax cuts played an important role in U.S. economic policy in the 1960s, 1980s, 
and 2000s, as well as in the response to the recession of 2007–9. In all cases, the effect on 
GDP was expansionary, although there is debate about the exact mechanism through which 
this occurred—not all economists accept the simple tax multiplier process that we have 
discussed.
Transfer payments, which as we noted are a kind of “negative tax,” affect the level of 
output through a similar logic. An increase in transfer payments, like a tax cut, will give people 
more money that they can spend. But the expansionary effect occurs only when they actually 
do spend—so, according to the mpc logic, the impact of an increase in transfer payments 
is reduced by whatever portion of the extra income people decide to save. The multiplier 
impact of a change in transfer payments is therefore the same as that of a change in taxes, 
except in the opposite direction. A cut in transfer payments, like an increase in taxes, will be 
contractionary, tending to lower economic equilibrium.
In the real economy, income taxes are generally proportional or progressive—that is, 
they increase with income levels (as discussed in Chapter 12).* In our model, the effect of a 
proportional tax would be to ﬂatten the aggregate demand curve, since it has a larger effect 
at higher income levels. (See Appendix A2 for a more detailed treatment of the impact of a 
proportional tax—we omit analysis of progressive taxes, which is a bit more complex.) This 
in turn will affect the multiplier, reducing it somewhat.
How can we explain the effect of a proportional tax on the multiplier? Taxes that rise 
with income will tend to lower the proportion consumed out of each dollar increase in 
income. For example, with a 15 percent tax each extra dollar of income will be reduced 
to 85 cents of disposable income. Applying our original mpc of 0.80 to the remaining 85 
cents, we get 0.8  0.85 = 0.68, indicating that 68 cents will be devoted to consumption 
(and 17 cents to saving). The result is similar to having a lower mpc, which also means 
a lower multiplier. This will dampen the effect of income changes on aggregate demand 
and economic equilibrium.
You might wonder what would be the effect of an increase in government spending that is 
exactly balanced by an increase in taxes? Since we have shown that the multiplier effect of 
taxes goes in the opposite direction from that of government spending, it might appear that 
the effects would cancel each other out. But this is not the case. Because the tax multiplier is 
smaller than the government spending multiplier, there is a net positive effect on aggregate 
demand and equilibrium. The difference between the two multipliers equals 1, so the net 
multiplier effect will also equal 1. In the example we have used, the government policy 
multiplier is 5, and the tax multiplier is 4, so the balanced budget multiplier = +5 – 4 = 1. 
Thus the impact on economic equilibrium is exactly equal to the original change in government 
spending (and taxes). So we can say that ΔY = ΔG.**
For example, an increase of $50 billion in government spending, balanced by an equal 
increase of $50 billion in taxes, would be expected to lead to a net increase in equilibrium 
 *Not counting “loopholes” that sometimes allow the very wealthy to characterize some of their income in ways that allow 
them to pay lower effective tax rates than do other groups.
**Technically, simultaneous changes in government spending and taxes of equal size do not imply that the overall budget 
is balanced. What is required for this is that total spending and total taxes be equal.

CHAPTER 25 — FISCAL POLICY
output of $50 billion. One way of thinking about this is to consider that the original government 
spending boosts GDP, but the negative multiplier effects generated by the tax increase cancel 
out the positive multiplier effects of the government spending. This results in a weaker net 
effect than government spending of $50 billion alone, which would lead to ΔY = (mult)ΔG 
= 5ΔG, or $250 billion in this example.
1.3 THE CIRCULAR FLOW WITH GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND TAXES
We can modify the simple circular ﬂow model introduced in Chapter 24 (Figures 24.5 and 
24.6) to add government spending and taxes. A circular ﬂow including government spending 
and taxes is shown in Figure 25.2. As noted above, transfer payments are considered negative 
taxes, so we do not include a separate arrow for transfers. Instead, we show net taxes—taxes 
minus transfer payments—as a leakage from the circular ﬂow and government spending as 
a reinjection to the circular ﬂow.
This model thus has two leakages—savings and net taxes; and two injections—intended 
investment and government spending. As discussed in the previous chapter, savings and 
investment ﬂow through the ﬁnancial system, and may or may not balance. Similarly, taxes 
and government spending may or may not balance, depending on whether the government 
has a deﬁcit, a surplus, or a balanced budget. 
This model represents a useful, simplified way of thinking about the complex 
macroeconomic system. If the overall leakages and injections balance, the system should be 
at a full employment equilibrium. From a Keynesian perspective, the object of government 
policy is to achieve such a balance, by varying government spending and net taxes to offset 
any imbalances in savings and investment. Classical economists are more skeptical about 
the ability of government to achieve this and more concerned that government action will 
unbalance, rather than balance, the circular ﬂow. We discuss some of these policy implications 
in much more detail in later chapters.
In Chapter 29 we introduce one more modiﬁcation of the circular ﬂow diagram to 
take into account the foreign sector, showing the effect of imports and exports. But ﬁrst, 
we examine some of the implications of government policies aimed at balancing out the 
circular ﬂow.
Figure 25.2 A Macroeconomic Model with Government Spending and Taxes
The model shows two sets 
of leakages and injections 
into the circular ﬂow: savings 
(leakage) and intended 
investment (injection), 
and net taxes (leakage) 
and government spending 
(injection). These may or 
may not balance out at a full 
employment level of output.

THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND TAXES 
569
1.4 EXPANSIONARY AND CONTRACTIONARY FISCAL POLICY
The three ﬁscal policy tools discussed above—changes in government spending, changes in 
tax levels, and changes in transfer payments—affect income and employment levels, as well 
as inﬂation rates (discussed further below and in Chapter 28). They also, of course, affect 
the government’s budgetary position. The budget could be balanced, in surplus, or in deﬁcit, 
depending on the combination of spending and tax policy that is employed.
Increasing government spending is an example of what economists refer to as 
expansionary ﬁscal policy. Other expansionary ﬁscal policies are increasing transfer 
payments or lowering taxes. Whether through a direct impact on aggregate demand or 
through giving consumers more money to spend, these policies should increase aggregate 
demand and equilibrium.
If that were the whole story, macroeconomic policy would be simple—just use sufﬁcient 
government spending or tax cuts to maintain the economy at full employment. But there 
are complications. One problem is that in order to spend more, the government has to raise 
taxes, borrow, or “print money.” (Issues of how government ﬁnances its expenditures are 
discussed later in this chapter and in subsequent ones.) Raising taxes tends to counteract the 
expansionary effects of increased spending. Borrowing money creates deﬁcits and raises 
long-term government debt that, as we will see, may or may not be a problem (these issues 
are discussed in depth in Chapter 31).
Another problem is that too much government spending may lead to inﬂation. The goal 
of expansionary ﬁscal policy is to expand the economic activity to its full-employment level. 
But what if ﬁscal policy overshoots this level? It is easy to see how this might occur. For 
politicians, government spending on popular programs is easy but raising taxes to pay for 
them is hard. This can lead to budget deﬁcits (discussed in Section 2), but it can also cause 
excessive aggregate demand in the economy. Excessive demand could also, in theory, arise 
from high consumer or business spending, but usually government spending, alone or in 
combination with high consumer and business expenditures, is partly to blame when the 
economy “overheats.” The result is likely to be inﬂation.
According to our basic analysis, the cure for inﬂation should be fairly straightforward. 
If the problem is too much aggregate demand, the solution is to reduce aggregate demand. 
We could do this by reversing the process discussed in the previous section and lowering 
government spending on goods and services. A similar effect can be obtained by reducing 
transfer payments or by increasing taxes. With lower transfer payments or higher taxes, 
businesses and consumers will have less spending power. Lower spending by government, 
businesses, and consumers will result in a lower equilibrium output level, and there will no 
longer be excess demand pressures to create inﬂation.
Thus we have identiﬁed another important economic policy tool—contractionary ﬁscal 
policy. This is a weapon that can be used against inﬂation, though it would generally be 
unwise to use it at times of high unemployment. (The problem of what to do if unemployment 
and inﬂation occur at the same time—something that is not shown in our simple model—is 
discussed in Chapter 28.) Of course, too large a spending reduction could overshoot in a 
downward direction, leading to excessive unemployment and, possibly, a recession.
Although the effects of contractionary ﬁscal policy can be painful, it would be wrong to 
assume that expansionary ﬁscal policy is always beneﬁcial and contractionary policy always 
harmful. Contractionary policy can be useful when previous policies have “overshot” the goal 
or when the economy is suffering from excessive inﬂation. We discuss this issue of policy 
choice extensively in this and the following chapters.
Discussion Questions
1. What recent changes in government spending or tax policy have been in the news? How 
would you expect these to affect GDP and employment levels?

CHAPTER 25 — FISCAL POLICY
2. In general, tax increases are politically unpopular. Would you ever be likely to favor a 
tax increase? Under what circumstances, if any, might a tax increase be beneﬁcial to the 
economy?
2. THE FEDERAL BUDGET
The federal government’s budget includes spending on goods and services, transfer pay-
ments, and taxes. (This is also true of state and local government budgets, but our focus for 
purposes of ﬁscal policy analysis is mainly the federal budget.) Thus we can divide total 
government expenditures, or government outlays, into two categories. Total government 
outlays include not only government spending on goods and services (G) but also govern-
ment transfer payments:
Government Outlays = G + TR
Recalling the earlier discussion, only government spending directly affects aggregate 
demand. Transfer payments do so only indirectly through their effect on consumption. As 
we see below, however, both types of outlay affect the federal budget, since both represent 
funds that the government must pay out.
On the revenue side, government income comes from taxes (T). When revenues are not 
sufﬁcient to cover outlays, the government borrows to cover the difference. The actual 
ﬁnancing of a deﬁcit is accomplished through the sale of government bonds by the U.S. 
Treasury. Government bonds are interest-bearing securities that can be bought by ﬁrms, 
individuals, or foreign governments. In effect, a government bond is a promise to pay back, 
with interest, the amount borrowed at a speciﬁc time in the future.
Federal sources of revenue and outlays are shown in Figure 25.3 for ﬁscal year (FY) 
2011*. The major sources of federal revenue are personal income and Social Security taxes. 
In FY 2011, the federal government also borrowed an amount equal to 36 percent of the 
total budget. Government borrowing varies from year to year, but deﬁcits are more common 
than surpluses. The major categories of government spending are Social Security, defense 
spending, and social programs.
Social Security and Medicare taxes are a special case, in that they are collected for a 
speciﬁc purpose—the provision of Social Security and Medicare beneﬁts. Funds raised 
through such taxes are exclusively for retirement purposes and cannot be used to ﬁnance 
any other government programs, for example, national defense or social programs (except, 
as we will see, when the federal government borrows from such accounts). For this reason, 
they are considered to be “off budget.” All other tax and spending categories shown are free 
of such restrictions and are classiﬁed as “on budget.” Each of the on-budget spending items 
is subject to congressional approval, or appropriation, each year.
Interest payments on the existing government debt are another special case. They are “on 
budget,” yet they are not subject to approval by Congress. To fulﬁll the promise made by the 
government when issuing bonds, interest on the debt must always be paid. Such payments 
amounted to 6 percent of federal spending in FY 2011.
Clearly, government borrowing and interest payments on the debt have economic impacts. 
What is the nature of these impacts? To answer this question, we need to look more carefully 
at the nature of government deﬁcits.

ment expenditures,

2.1 DEFICITS AND SURPLUSES
First, we need to deﬁne what we mean by the government budget surplus or deﬁcit. This 
can be calculated by subtracting total government outlays from total government tax revenues. 
A positive result indicates a surplus; a negative one, a deﬁcit.

Showing the government’s budget deﬁcit as a percentage of nominal GDP is a simple 
way to correct for the effects of both inﬂation and the ability of the economy to handle the 
deﬁcit. The larger the economy—as measured by GDP—the easier it is to manage a given 
deﬁcit, since both the ﬁscal and budgetary impacts of the deﬁcit will be relatively smaller 
compared to the size of the economy. A bigger economy means that people will have higher 
incomes and a larger ﬂow of savings is likely to be available to purchase more government 
bonds, making it easier for the government to borrow.
State and local governments are generally required to separate their current spending 
and capital budgets. Current spending must be paid for out of current taxes, but money 
Social Security and Medicare made up 
33 percent of federal outlays in 2011, and 
national defense 24 percent. Interest on the 
federal debt represented 6 percent of federal 
outlays.

CHAPTER 25 — FISCAL POLICY
can be borrowed for investment (“capital”) projects such as new schools, bridges, and 
transit systems. The federal budget, however, makes no such distinction between current 
and capital spending. In fact, the federal government has considerably more ﬂexibility 
than state and local governments in the conduct of budget operations. A decisive factor 
in the difference is that the federal government is uniquely empowered to conduct deﬁcit 
spending and to ﬁnance spending through expansion of the money supply (as we will see 
in Chapter 27), while the states and municipalities have no such power. We return to this 
point in later chapters.
Economists sometimes use the term “countercyclical” to describe a federal government 
policy of increasing spending and cutting taxes in lean times and doing the reverse when 
the economy strengthens. State and local governments, in contrast, tend to follow a 
more procyclical policy, in which both recessions and booms are reinforced rather than 
counterbalanced. This is not the intended result but simply a result of the fact that voters are 
more inclined to support local spending on schools, for example, when times are good. So 
in certain respects federal ﬁscal policy works against not only business-cycle ﬂuctuations 
but also the unintentional reinforcement of such ﬂuctuations by state and local governments 
(see Box 25.1).
Over the years, the U.S. Federal budget position has varied from deﬁcit to surplus and 
back again. The U.S. federal government budget went from a large deﬁcit in 1992 to a surplus 
in 2001 (Figure 25.4). Then in 2002 the government budget moved back into deﬁcit. After 
moderating for a few years, deﬁcits increased sharply following the Great Recession of 
2007–9, at one point even exceeding 10 percent of GDP—a level not seen since the 1940s. 
This has led to an extensive debate about the impact of deﬁcits on the economy. We focus on 
these issues in greater depth in Chapter 31. As we see, there is much continuing controversy, 
among economists and the general public, about the signiﬁcance of budgetary policy and 
deﬁcits and many different ideas about the best way to handle issues of government spending, 
taxes, and transfer payments.
2.2 AUTOMATIC STABILIZERS
Deﬁcits and surpluses are not just a result of active ﬁscal policy. A signiﬁcant portion of the 
variations in government spending and tax revenues occurs “automatically,” due to mecha-
nisms built into the economic system to help stabilize it.
deﬁcit spending: 
government spending 
in excess of tax rev-
enues collected
countercyclical 
policy: ﬁscal policy in 
which taxes are low-
ered and expenditure 
is raised when the 
economy is weak, and 
the opposite occurs 
when the economy is 
strong
procyclical policy: 
ﬁscal policy in which 
taxes are lowered and 
expenditure is raised 
when the economy is 
strong, and the oppo-
site is done when the 
economy is weak
BOX 25.1 THE EFFECT OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING ON GDP
While much of the debate about government spend-
ing in the United States focuses on the federal level, 
changes in government spending at state and local 
levels can also have a signiﬁcant impact on the mac-
roeconomy. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis 
(BEA) has developed economic models that attempt 
to isolate the impact of state and local government 
spending on GDP.
The BEA estimated, for example, that in 2009 state 
and local government spending provided a boost to the 
national economy—increasing the GDP growth rate by 
0.28 percentage points. In other words, nominal GDP 
growth in 2009 was 0.9 percent, but would have been 
about 0.6 percent without the positive impact of state 
and local government spending. Some of this spending 
was money that state and local governments received 
from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act (the Obama stimulus).
But when state and local governments cut spend-
ing, their impact on GDP levels can turn negative. This 
was the case in 2010 and 2011, as federal stimulus 
money dried up and states mostly looked to balance 
their budgets by cutting spending. The BEA estimated 
that state and local budget cutbacks reduced GDP 
growth by 0.23 percentage points in 2010 and 0.43 
percentage points in 2011. Preliminary results indicate 
that the impact of state and local government spending 
on GDP in 2012 was also negative.

THE FEDERAL BUDGET 
573
Since the 1950s, government spending has been a major part of the U.S. economy. As 
we have seen, this was partly a result of the Keynesian idea that government spending was 
needed to prevent recession. In recent decades, the use of expansionary ﬁscal policy has been 
controversial, partly as a result of issues such as deﬁcits and inﬂation. During this period, 
however, total government outlays (including transfers and spending on goods and services) 
have not declined, either in money terms or as a percentage of GDP.
As Figure 25.5 shows, government receipts and outlays tend to ﬂuctuate over time. For 
example, beginning in 2007, when the economy stagnated as a consequence of the ﬁnancial 
crisis, government receipts declined while outlays increased. Economists refer to the change 
as the automatic stabilization effect of government spending and taxes. It refers to the way 
in which the government budget moderates ﬂuctuations of aggregate demand even without 
any active decision-making or legislating by the government.
Even if no speciﬁc budgetary action is taken, the government’s budget will vary over the 
business cycle. Suppose that the economy is entering a recession. As aggregate demand falls, the 
government deﬁcit generally rises. Tax revenues decline as people have less income on which 
to pay taxes due to the slowing economy. In addition, as more people receive unemployment

Figure 25.4 Federal Surplus or Deﬁcit as a Percent of GDP
The federal deﬁcit—as measured by 
government borrowing—reached 6 
percent of GDP in 1983, a year of deep 
recession. The deﬁcit was reduced 
as a percent of GDP from the early 
1990s until 1998, when the budget went 
into surplus. From 1998 to 2001, the 
government had a net surplus, meaning 
that some debt was being retired. After 
2000, a recession combined with the 
Bush administration tax cuts put the 
budget back into deﬁcit. The recession 
of 2007–9 led to even larger deﬁcits, 
reaching 10% of GDP before starting to 
decline as the economy started a slow 
recovery.

CHAPTER 25 — FISCAL POLICY
insurance, transfer payments related to programs such as food stamps increase. This cushions 
the fall in personal disposable income—and thus the fall in consumer spending.
If the federal government does not actively move to balance its budget, these automatic 
changes in spending and taxes tend to moderate the recession. In effect, the recession creates 
an automatic response of expansionary ﬁscal impacts—increased spending and lower tax 
revenues. It will also, of course, tend to increase the government deﬁcit (or reduce any 
surplus).
Similarly, if aggregate demand is rising during an economic expansion, tax revenues rise. 
Fewer people receive unemployment or other transfer payments. This means that personal 
disposable income does not rise as quickly as national income. This, in turn, puts a damper 
on increases in consumer spending—and limits the inﬂationary overheating that can arise 
from increased aggregate demand.
Automatic stabilizers are, therefore, inseparable from cyclical budget imbalances. 
Economists often say that the portion of the deﬁcit (surplus) that is the result of automatic 
stabilizers is the cyclical deﬁcit (or surplus). It is, in effect, the part of the budget balance 
that is sensitive to ﬂuctuations in the macroeconomy.
This phenomenon helps explain why, for example, the U.S. government was able to enjoy 
budgetary surpluses in the late 1990s. It is true that the policies of the Clinton administration, 
which included raising tax rates to try to balance the budget, contributed. But as business 
revenues and personal incomes soared, the resulting increase in tax revenues allowed the 
government’s coffers to ﬁll. 
In addition to the automatic stabilizers, the federal budget has another aspect that levels 
the ﬂuctuations of output. This is the steadiness of government spending. Unlike investment, 
consumer spending, net exports, and to some extent state and local government spending, 
most areas of federal spending do not change drastically from year to year. This adds an 
element of stability to the economy’s aggregate demand.
2.3 DISCRETIONARY POLICY
Sometimes, the automatic stabilization effect of government spending and taxes cannot 
smooth economic ups and downs as much as is needed. Relatively severe problems of reces-
sion or inﬂation often give rise to proposals to use an active, or discretionary ﬁscal policy 
to remedy the situation. This issue is controversial among economists. Some economists, as 
we will see, believe that the government should never use an activist ﬁscal policy, believing 
that it is likely to do more harm than good. Other economists argue that activist ﬁscal policy is 
essential, especially to respond to severe economic problems such as deep recession. Regard-
less of economists’ advice, the fact is that governments are making ﬁscal policy all the time, 
whether in a planned or unplanned manner. Every year, the government revises its budget, 
including levels of spending and taxation. These spending and tax levels have effects on the 
economy, and it is important to try to understand them.
Historically, the ﬁrst major experience with expansionary ﬁscal policy was during World 
War II. Before the war, President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal had initiated some 
government spending programs intended to put the unemployed to work during the Great 
Depression. But these programs were dwarfed by the magnitude of war spending in the 1940s. 
As a result, unemployment, which had been as high as 25 percent in 1933 and 19 percent in 
1938, fell to about 2 percent in 1943. The fall in unemployment was a beneﬁcial side effect 
of the onset of World War II and the war-induced spending.*
After the conclusion of World War II, government spending never returned to prewar levels, 
and the beneﬁcial effects of the expanded government role—steady economic growth with 
cyclical deﬁcit 
(surplus): the por-
tion of the deﬁcit (or 
surplus) that is caused 
by ﬂuctuations in the 
business cycle
discretionary ﬁscal 
policy: changes in 
government spending 
and taxation resulting 
from deliberate policy 
decisions
*Employment ﬁgures for that era covered a labor force in which a much lower proportion of women were seeking jobs 
than is the case today. During World War II, an unusually large number of women were employed, ﬁlling jobs left vacant by 
men who were serving in the armed forces.

 
THE FEDERAL BUDGET

relatively low unemployment levels—seemed to justify this. In the 1960s, economists became 
even more optimistic about the beneﬁts of ﬁscal policy. At that time, it was suggested that it 
would be possible for the government to “ﬁne-tune” the economic system using ﬁscal policy, 
to ratchet aggregate demand up or down in response to changes in the business climate.
“Fine-tuning” was largely discredited in the 1970s and 1980s, as the economy struggled 
with inﬂationary problems that were partly a result of sharp increases in oil prices, but were 
also seen as having been worsened by excessive government spending (we look at this in 
more detail in Chapter 28). In addition, many economists argued that problems of time lags 
made ﬁscal policy unwieldy and often counterproductive.
To understand the problems with ﬁne-tuning and time lags, we can use a commonsense 
example. Imagine that when you wake up it is too cold in your apartment, so you turn up 
the temperature on the thermostat. It might take so much time for the apartment to warm 
up that you do not get the beneﬁts before you leave for work. You might become impatient, 
raising the temperature again. As a result, the apartment gets too hot during the day, so when 
you get home you have to turn the thermostat down again. Thus delayed responses make 
your management of the apartment’s temperature less effective. The best strategy is to set 
the thermostat at a single temperature (or, with a programmable thermostat, a speciﬁc daily 
pattern) and then to resist ﬁddling with it.
Similarly, time lags can make active ﬁscal policy less effective as a way to stabilize the 
economy. There are two types of lags: inside and outside lags. Inside lags refer to delays that 
occur within the government, while outside lags refer to the delayed effects of government 
policies. There are four major types of inside lags:
1. A data lag: It may take some time for the government to collect information about eco-
nomic problems such as unemployment.
2. A recognition lag: Government decision-makers may not see an event as a problem right 
away.
3. A legislative lag: Discretionary ﬁscal policy must be instituted in the form of legal changes 
in the government’s budget. The government’s economists may want to increase spending 
or decrease tax rates, but they have to convince both the president and Congress to act to 
solve the problem.
4. A transmission lag: These legal changes take time to show up in actual tax forms and 
government budgets. One solution is that changes can be made retroactive to speed up 
their implementation—for instance, a tax cut legislated now may apply to income received 
during the previous year. However, this is not always done.
In addition, even if all these lags have been overcome, it takes time for the new policies 
actually to affect the economy (the “outside lag”). Suppose, for example, that the government 
responds to a rise in unemployment with increased government spending or a tax cut. By 
the time these policies are in place and create an economic stimulus, the economy may have 
recovered on its own. In that case, the additional aggregate demand will not be needed and 
is likely to create inﬂationary pressures.
Despite these problems with discretionary ﬁscal policy, governments have continued to 
use it, with mixed results. Government ﬁscal stimulus, with or without a formal economic 
justiﬁcation, was applied during the periods 1964–68, 1975–77, 1980–87, in the early 2000s, 
and again in 2008–12, after the ﬁnancial crisis and recession. An especially popular form 
of expansionary policy has been tax cuts, implemented under Presidents Kennedy, Reagan, 
George W. Bush, as well as by the Obama administration as part of a stimulus policy in 
response to recession (see Box 25.2).
Discretionary expenditures constitute a separate portion of the federal budget. While 
automatic stabilizers contribute to the cyclical deﬁcit or surplus, we say that discretionary 
ﬁscal policy produces a structural deﬁcit (or surplus). We can (loosely) think of the 
time lags: the time 
that elapses between 
the formulation of an 
economic policy and 
its actual effects on 
the economy
structural deﬁcit 
(surplus): the por-
tion of the deﬁcit (or 
surplus) that results 
from tax and spend-
ing policy dictated 
by the president and 
Congress at their 
discretion

CHAPTER 25 — FISCAL POLICY
structural deﬁcit as the deﬁcit that would occur if the economy were at full employment. 
Structural deﬁcits represent the portion of the overall deﬁcit that is dictated by the president 
and Congress, even though a signiﬁcant portion of discretionary expenditures often result 
from decisions made years earlier. Only changes in the structural budget balance truly reﬂect 
the direction of ﬁscal policy—that is, whether it is stimulative or contractionary—since 
other changes are related to the automatic stabilizers.
BOX 25.2 THE OBAMA STIMULUS PROGRAM
In February 2009, in response to a severe recession 
that had pushed the unemployment rate over 8 per-
cent, the Obama administration proposed a $787 
billion stimulus package, including $288 billion in 
tax cuts, $224 billion in extended unemployment 
beneﬁts, education, and health care, and $275 billion 
for job creation through federal contracts, grants, and 
loans. The stimulus, formally known as the American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), was enacted 
by Congress, providing for increased spending and 
tax reductions over a period of ten years. For the 
ﬁrst three ﬁscal years, $720 billion, or 91.5 percent, 
was budgeted to maximize the impact in ﬁghting 
the recession. Later estimates by the Congressional 
Budget Ofﬁce (CBO) indicate that the total impact of 
the stimulus package over the period 2009–19 will 
be about $830 billion.
From the point of view of economic analysis, 
the stimulus amounted to a major expansionary 
ﬁscal policy, including all three ﬁscal policy tools: 
changes in government spending, changes in tax 
levels, and changes in transfer payments. According 
to the economic theories discussed in this chapter, 
the effects of such a program should be to expand 
economic activity, boost GDP, and lower unemploy-
ment (although classical economists are skeptical, 
especially about the effectiveness of government 
spending).
Was the stimulus successful? The answer was not 
immediately obvious, because the recession was 
severe (unemployment rates peaked in late 2009 at 
10 percent) and the subsequent recovery slow, giving 
many people the impression that the stimulus failed. 
But there is now sufﬁcient evidence to indicate that in 
fact it was very effective.
According to the CBO, the ARRA “added as many 
as 3.3 million jobs to the economy in the second 
quarter of 2010, and may have prevented the na-
tion from lapsing back into recession.” An analysis 
by economists Alan Blinder and Mark Zandi in 2010 
found that the stimulus “probably averted what could 
have been called Great Depression 2.0. . . . [W]ithout 
the government’s response, GDP in 2010 would be 
about 11.5 percent lower [and] payroll employment 
would be less by some 8½ million jobs.” Blinder and 
Zandi’s analysis takes into account negative multiplier 
effects. The decline in economic activity in 2009 was so 
steep that, without an increase in aggregate demand, 
a negative spiral of lower demand, lower incomes, 
and even lower demand would have taken place, as 
it did in the Great Depression in the 1930s.
The CBO report indicates that “the effects of ARRA 
on output peaked in the ﬁrst half of 2010 and have 
since diminished.” Even so, the stimulus continued to 
exert a positive impact on GDP in 2012: “ARRA raised 
real GDP in 2012 by between 0.1 percent and 0.8 per-
cent, and increased the number of people employed 
in 2012 by between 0.2 million and 1.1 million.” The 
CBO also estimated output multipliers for stimulus 
spending between 0.5 and 2.5, for middle-income tax 
cuts between 0.3 and 1.5, and for transfer payments 
between 0.4 and 2.1.
What about longer-term effects of the stimulus? 
The CBO estimates that ARRA will increase budget 
deﬁcits by about $830 billion over the 2009–19 pe-
riod; 90 percent of this impact occurred during the 
ﬁrst three years of the program. As noted, without the 
stimulus the economy would have been likely to go 
into a much more severe decline, which would have 
lowered tax revenues and raised transfer payments, so 
it is possible that without the stimulus the deﬁcit would 
have increased even more. In a survey conducted by 
the University of Chicago Booth School of Business 
in 2012, 80 percent of economists agreed that the 
stimulus had reduced the unemployment rate. On 
long-term effects, economists were more divided: 46 
percent believed that “the beneﬁts of the stimulus will 
end up exceeding its cost,” while 27 percent were not 
certain, and 12 percent thought that long-term costs 
would outweigh beneﬁts.

POLICY ISSUES 
577
Changes in tax policy—tax cuts, for example—also are classiﬁed as discretionary (in 
contrast to changes in tax revenues resulting from business-cycle ﬂuctuations). Proponents 
of tax cuts sometimes appeal to supply-side economics (ﬁrst introduced during the Reagan 
administration) to support their policies. The supply-side argument for tax cuts is essentially 
that lower tax rates encourage more work, saving, and investment, thereby creating a more 
dynamic economy. According to the most enthusiastic advocates of supply-side economics, 
output will grow so rapidly in response to a cut in tax rates that total tax revenues will 
actually increase, not decrease (more on this in Chapter 31). This is different from the logic 
of increased aggregate demand that we have discussed, which implies that tax cuts will create 
an economic stimulus, but are likely to raise the government deﬁcit.
The economic record seems to show that tax cuts do indeed create an economic stimulus—
but debate continues among economists as to whether this effect is demand-led (as implied 
by our ﬁscal policy model) or based on supply-side effects. And in general, tax cuts have 
usually led to lower revenues and higher deﬁcits (this was true both of the Reagan tax cuts 
in the 1980s and the Bush tax cuts in the 2000s). 
Discussion Questions
1. Do you think that the president is mostly responsible for the persistent budget deﬁcits? Is 
Congress responsible? Are budget deﬁcits necessarily bad?
2. Why doesn’t the government run surpluses every year instead of deﬁcits? Wouldn’t doing 
so be better for the economy?
3. POLICY ISSUES
3.1 CROWDING OUT AND CROWDING IN
A common concern of ﬁscal policy critics is that federal government spending gets in the 
way of consumption and private investment. We have already seen that while government 
expenditures boost aggregate demand, the tax revenues required to ﬁnance such expenditures 
have the opposite effect. But the expenditure effect is stronger, dollar for dollar, than the tax 
effect, which is why the effects do not exactly cancel each other out and why the balanced 
budget multiplier equals 1 instead of 0.
That would be the end of the story if raising taxes were the only means of ﬁnancing government 
expenditures. Yet we know that the government frequently runs deﬁcits and, when it does so, 
it must borrow money. It borrows from the capital markets (i.e., the loanable funds market as 
discussed in Chapter 24), in theory leaving less money available for private investment. The 
reduced availability of loanable funds can have the effect of raising interest rates, which, by making 
borrowing more expensive, makes investment less likely, ceteris paribus. Economists therefore 
say that borrowing to help cover budget deﬁcits may have the effect of “crowding out” private 
investment. Economists who favor the classical approach often claim that replacing dynamic 
private investment with “clumsy” government spending is wasteful and inefﬁcient.
Figure 25.6 uses the classical model of the loanable funds market, introduced in Chapter 
24 (Figure 24.7) to illustrate how government demand for loanable funds could crowd out 
private borrowing. The supply curve (S) represents savings or, more concretely, the supply of 
loanable funds. For a given supply, the interest rate will be pushed up from i1 to i2 when the 
government borrows money to pay for a budget deﬁcit, represented by a shift in the demand 
curve from D1 to D2. The result is that private investment is now more expensive and saving 
becomes more attractive.
The difference between Q2 and Q3 represents the amount of funds borrowed by the 
government. Because this additional demand raises the interest rate, private investment 
becomes less attractive, and some is “crowded out.” Q3 now represents the quantity of loanable 
funds available for private investment. The amount of “crowding out” is shown on the graph 
supply-side eco-
nomics: an eco-
nomic theory that 
emphasizes policies to 
stimulate production, 
such as lower taxes. 
The theory predicts 
that such incentives 
stimulate greater eco-
nomic effort, saving, 
and investment, there-
by increasing overall 
economic output and 
tax revenues.

CHAPTER 25 — FISCAL POLICY
as the difference between Q1 and Q3. The implication of this analysis is that government deﬁcit 
spending is counterproductive to the aim of promoting private investment.
John Maynard Keynes acknowledged the potential for crowding out. He did not, however, 
believe that deﬁcit spending would crowd out private spending to a signiﬁcant degree if, as 
during the Great Depression, there was considerable slack in the economy. In other words, if 
owners of capital are reluctant to invest anyway, there is no reason for government borrowing 
to drive up interest rates. Remember that in the Keynesian view, recessionary conditions are 
characterized by an excess of savings over investment. If there is a large excess of savings, 
there is no reason to worry that government borrowing will absorb too much of the available 
loanable funds.
Keynes also minimized the importance of crowding out for other reasons. First, recall 
from Chapter 24 that, according to Keynes, investment decisions are not dependent only on 
the rate of interest. He believed that investment decisions also are a function of expectations 
of future proﬁt, what he called “animal spirits.” In good economic times, investors purchase 
more capital goods because their growing proﬁts reinforce an optimistic outlook about the 
future. And they are likely to do so despite the historical tendency for interest rates to rise 
in good economic times. The opposite might well be true in recession. Despite low interest 
rates, business spending will be lower due to growing pessimism. For the reasons noted above, 
government borrowing to ﬁnance deﬁcits may not raise interest rates during a recession, and 
even if it does, this might not have any signiﬁcant effect on investment, since investors will 
not want to invest anyway—at least until the economy starts to recover.
Second, there is signiﬁcant scope for complementarity between public and private 
investment. According to this argument, certain government expenditures on, say, 
transportation, energy, or communications networks enhance the potential proﬁts of private 
investment by providing critical infrastructure. Rather than being a substitute for private 
investment, government spending supports the productivity of private investment, and is 
therefore likely to encourage more of it. When such government spending generates more 
investment, it is called crowding in.
During the Great Depression, Keynes argued that the economy could be stuck in a 
potentially permanent low-level equilibrium (i.e., the unemployment equilibrium we saw 
in Chapter 24) and that the government needed to run deﬁcits to ﬁnance the spending

necessary to stimulate aggregate demand and thus attract renewed investment spending on 
capital goods. This argument was been reﬂected recently in the Obama administration’s 
position that infrastructure spending is important to get a sluggish economy moving 
again.
3.2 DIFFERENT MULTIPLIER EFFECTS
Another issue of considerable policy controversy is which items in the budget deserve priority. 
A principal goal of government spending—especially discretionary spending—is to stimulate 
the economy. The multiplier ensures that every additional dollar of government spending 
increases aggregate demand by more than one dollar. But we have also seen that much of the 
effect can be offset by taxes. In addition, it is unrealistic to assume that the multiplier effect 
is the same regardless of the type of government expenditure.
As seen earlier, the larger the mpc, the greater the multiplier. Until now, we have assumed 
that the mpc is uniform—that is, that it represents the marginal propensity to consume of all 
individuals and groups in society. But there may be signiﬁcant variations in the mpc depending 
on which income groups are involved.
The typical wealthy individual is capable of saving a signiﬁcant percentage of his income, a 
much greater percentage than that of most poor people. Of course, what is saved is not consumed; 
the average poor person spends a higher percentage of each additional dollar received than 
would a rich person. In other words, a poor person’s mpc tends to be higher. Because a higher 
mpc translates to a larger multiplier, Keynes argued that in general the multiplier is largest when 
government spending is directed toward those who have the highest mpc. Spending that beneﬁts 
the poor or unemployed is thus likely to have larger multiplier effects.
Table 25.2 presents estimates for the multiplier effects of different ﬁscal policy initiatives. 
(The multipliers listed here are smaller than those seen in earlier examples because of offsetting 
effects and leakages such as those discussed in Appendix A2.) Note that unemployment 
beneﬁts, food stamps, aid to state governments (which help prevent layoffs), and infrastructure 
spending all have relatively large multiplier effects. The smallest multiplier effects tend to 
be associated with tax cuts, whether for wealthy individuals or corporations. As anticipated 
by Keynes, cuts in this case get less “bang for the buck” due to the generally smaller mpc 
exhibited by the beneﬁciaries of such policies.

CHAPTER 25 — FISCAL POLICY
3.3 APPLYING FISCAL POLICY
We have now identiﬁed a number of different ﬁscal policy approaches that can be used by 
the government to respond to various economic conditions. We have also noted some of the 
differences in opinion among economists as to the effectiveness and appropriate use of ﬁscal 
policy. In future chapters, we examine the application of ﬁscal policies to speciﬁc problems, 
including the ﬁnancial crisis and recession that began in 2007. 
Before doing this, we need to add another very important aspect of the economy to our 
analysis: the money supply and monetary policy. The supply of money in the economy is 
a very important factor affecting, among other things, interest rates and inﬂation. We need 
to understand how the money supply is created and regulated and how this relates to other 
macroeconomic factors. This is the topic of Chapters 26 and 27.
After we have added an analysis of money and monetary policy, we will return to a 
consideration of the issues of unemployment and inﬂation and appropriate policies to respond 
to them, in Chapter 28. We will then introduce the international economy in Chapter 29. In 
Chapter 30 we discuss the economic crisis of 2007–8 and its aftermath, in Chapter 31 we 
focus on issues of debt and deﬁcits.

EXERCISES
 1. Using the data in Table 25.1, determine the economic 
equilibrium for a government spending level of 60.
 2. Using Table 25.1 and the formulas and numbers 
given in the text for the multiplier and tax multi-
plier, calculate the effect on equilibrium GDP of a 
government spending level of 100 combined with 
a tax level of 100. What does this imply about the 
impact of a balanced government budget on GDP, 
compared to government spending alone?
 3. Go to the Economic Report of the President at 
www.gpoaccess.gov/eop/. Consult the most recent 
Report’s table on “Gross Domestic Product.” For 
the last year, with ﬁnal rather than preliminary 
ﬁgures, ﬁnd the values of gross domestic product 
personal consumption expenditures, and gross 
private domestic investment. Now ﬁnd the value 
for ﬁxed investment. If we assume that all inven-
tory changes are unintended, ﬁxed investment is 
the same thing as what we call intended invest-
ment. You will note that the column on the right

A1. AN ALGEBRAIC APPROACH TO THE MULTIPLIER, WITH A LUMP-SUM TAX
A lump-sum tax is a tax that is simply levied on an economy as a ﬂat amount. This amount does 
not change with the level of income. Suppose that a lump-sum tax is levied in an economy with 
a government (but no foreign sector). Because consumption in this economy is C = ×C + mpc Yd 
while disposable income is Yd = Y – ×T + TR, we can write the consumption function as:
C = ×C + mpc (Y – ×T + TR)
Thus aggregate demand in this economy can be expressed as:
AD = C + II + G
= ×C + mpc (Y – ×T + TR) + II + G
= ( ×C – mpc ×T + mpc TR + II + G) + mpc Y
The last rearrangement shows that the AD curve has an intercept equal to the term in 
parentheses and a slope equal to the marginal propensity to consume. Changes in any of the 
variable in parentheses, by changing the intercept, shift the curve upward or downward in 
a parallel manner.
By substituting this into the equation for the equilibrium condition, Y = AD, we can derive 
an expression for equilibrium income in terms of all the other variables in the model:
 
 
 
    Y = (×C –mpc ×T + mpc TR + II + G) + mpc Y
 
 
     Y – mpc Y = ×C – mpc ×T + mpc TR + II + G
 
 
 
   (1 – mpc)Y = ×C – mpc ×T + mpcTR + II + G
Y = 
1
(×C – mpc ×T + mpc TR + II + G)
1 – mpc
If autonomous consumption, intended investment, or government spending change, these 
each increase equilibrium income by mult = 1/(1 – mpc) times the amount of the original 
change. If the level of lump-sum taxes or transfers changes, these change Y by either negative 
or positive (mult)(mpc) times the amount of the original change.
To see this explicitly, consider the changes that would come about in Y if there were a 
change in the level of the lump sum tax from T0 to a new level, T1, if everything else stays the 
same. We can solve for the change in Y by subtracting the old equation from the new one:

CHAPTER 25 — FISCAL POLICY
Y1 = 
1
 (×C + II + G – mpc ×T1 + mpc TR)
1 – mpc
[Y0 = 
1
 (×C + II + G – mpc ×T0 + mpc TR)]
1 – mpc
Y1 – Y0 = 
1
 (×C – ×C + II – II + G –G – mpc ×T1 + mpc ×T0 + mpc TR – mpc TR)
1 – mpc
But ×C, II, G, TR (and the mpc) are all unchanged, so most of the subtractions in parentheses 
come out to be 0. We are left with (taking the negative sign out in front):
Y1 –Y0 = – 
1
mpc (×T1 – ×T0)
1 – mpc
or
ΔY = – (mult)(mpc)Δ ×T
As explained in the text, the multiplier for a change in taxes is smaller than the multiplier 
for a change in government spending, because taxation affects aggregate demand only to the 
extent that people spend their tax cut or pay their increased taxes by reducing consumption. 
Because people may also save part of their tax cut or pay part of their increased taxes out of 
their savings, not all the changes in taxes will carry over to changes in aggregate demand. The 
tax multiplier has a negative sign, since a decrease in taxes increases consumption, aggregate 
demand, and income, while a tax increase decreases them. 
A2. AN ALGEBRAIC APPROACH TO THE MULTIPLIER, WITH A PROPORTIONAL TAX
With a proportional tax, total tax revenues are not set at a ﬁxed level of revenues, as was the 
case with a lump sum tax but, rather, are a ﬁxed proportion of total income. That is, T = tY 
where t is the tax rate. The equation for AD becomes
AD = ×C + mpc (Y – tY + TR) II + G
= ×C + mpc TR + II + G) + mpc (Y – tY)
= ( ×C + mpc TR + II + G) + mpc (1 – t) Y
With the addition of proportional taxes, the AD curve now has a new slope: mpc(1 – t). 
Because t is a fraction greater than 0 but less than 1, this slope is generally ﬂatter than the 
slope we have worked with before. A cut in the tax rate rotates the curve upward, as shown 
in Figure 25.7.
Substituting in the equilibrium condition, Y = AD, and solving yields:
Y = (×C + mpc TR + II + G) + mpc (1 – t) Y
Y – mpc (1 – t) Y = ×C + mpc TR + II + G
(1 – mpc (1 – t)) Y = ×C + mpc TR + II + G
Y = 
1
(×C + mpc TR + II + G)
1 – mpc (1– t)

583
The term in brackets is a new multiplier, for the case of a proportional tax. It is smaller 
than the basic (no proportional taxation) multiplier, reﬂecting the fact that now any change 
in spending has smaller feedback effects through consumption. (Some of the change in 
income “leaks” into taxes.) For example, if mpc = 0.8 and t = 0.2, then the new multiplier 
is 1/(1 – 0.64), or approximately 2.8, compared to the simple model multiplier 1/(1 – 0.8), 
which is 5. Changes in autonomous consumption or investment (or government spending 
or transfers) now have less of an effect on equilibrium income—the “automatic stabilizer” 
effect mentioned in the text.
Is there a multiplier for the tax rate, t? That is, could we derive from the model a formula 
for how much equilibrium income should change with a change in the rate (rather than level) 
of taxes? For example, if the tax rate were to decrease from 0.2 to 0.15, could we calculate 
the size of the change from Y0 to Y1 illustrated in Figure 25.7? Yes, but deriving a general 
formula for a multiplier relating the change in Y to the change in the tax rate requires the use 
of calculus, which we will not pursue here. (If you are familiar with calculus, you can use 
the last formula above to calculate the change in Y resulting from a change in t).

26 Money, Banking, and Finance
Everyone would like to have more money, right? Well, maybe not. In 2004 it was very easy 
to be a millionaire in Turkey—many times over. A million Turkish lira were worth about 
$0.75 in U.S. dollars. A 20 million-lira bill was worth about US$15. People routinely just 
put their thumb over the last six digits when looking at a value expressed in liras. Guinness 
World Records named the Turkish lira the world’s least valuable currency. But you could 
have lots of it!
1. WHY MONEY?
So far, this book has said very little about money, ﬁnance, or interest rates. Economics is fun-
damentally about how our scarce resources—including labor—are employed in the production 
of goods and services that contribute to economic well-being. Money is a mere facilitator in 
the process. But money is essential to the functioning of modern economies, which is why 
money, ﬁnance, and interest rates are important macroeconomic issues. 
What is the relation of money and ﬁnance to economic behavior? Before we get into 
the details of how money and credit work in a sophisticated contemporary economy, let’s 
picture a few simpler—and dramatically different—scenarios, drawn from real-world 
situations and events, that inform how economists have come to think about money and the 
macroeconomy.
1.1 MONEY AND AGGREGATE DEMAND
Let’s start with a case of an economy in which inﬂation is low to moderate. Suppose further 
that this economy has a banking system that is sophisticated and in reasonably good shape. 
You are a businessperson who has a great idea about how to expand your business. Or, in 
your role as a household member, you are interested in buying a home for your family. But 
you do not have the cash. You go to a bank and ask for a loan. The bank will evaluate your 
creditworthiness, see how much it currently has available to lend, and then either deny you a 
loan or offer you a loan on particular terms. If you receive a loan offer and accept the terms, 
you will take out the loan and go out and spend. If you are denied the loan, or if you think the 
terms are too unfavorable, you will forgo expanding your business or buying the house.
To the extent the government of a country can affect the volume and terms of loans made by 
banks, it can thus affect the level of spending in the economy. We have seen in Chapters 24 and 25 
how the level of spending (or aggregate demand) in an economy is related to levels of employment 
and output. Monetary policy that affects the behavior of banks, then, may also be a signiﬁcant 
factor in achieving the goals of macroeconomic stabilization and low unemployment.
But not all economies enjoy low inﬂation rates and stable banking systems. Our next two 
cases illustrate these cases.
monetary policy:  
the use of tools con-
trolled by the govern-
ment, such as banking 
regulations and the 
issuance of currency, 
to affect the levels of 
money supply, interest 
rates, and credit

 
WHY MONEY? 
585
1.2 “RUNNING THE PRINTING PRESS”
Consider a country with a very simple government and banking system. The country’s gov-
ernment is housed in a single building and pays its employees and its bills in cash. In the 
basement of the building is a printing press that prints paper money. The government ﬁnds it 
very difﬁcult to collect enough taxes to pay its operating expenses, so it just runs the printing 
press every time an employee needs to be paid or a bill comes due.
How would this affect the economy? If the national economy is very large and growing, 
relative to the size of government expenditures, the fresh bills may just be absorbed into 
circulation without much impact. But if the economy was stagnant and expenditures were 
large, there would soon be a classic situation of inﬂation caused by “too much money 
chasing too few goods.” As more and more money is put into circulation, prices will rise at 
an increasingly rapid rate.
If this goes on for long, a situation of hyperinﬂation (often deﬁned as any annual inﬂation 
rate higher than 100 percent) can result. Germany after World War I, Hungary after World 
War II, Bolivia in the mid-1980s, Argentina during various periods, Ukraine in the early 
1990s, and Zimbabwe in 2008–9 all experienced famous hyperinﬂations.
In Germany in the 1920s, for example, the economy was in tatters after the war and the 
government found it impossible to collect taxes in sufﬁcient amounts to support its operations, 
let alone pay the reparations demanded by the victors. So it resorted to running the printing 
presses. Inﬂation reached a high of 41 percent—per day! In 1920 a German postage stamp 
cost 4 marks; in 1923 the same stamp cost 50 billion marks.
BOX 26.1 EXPERIENCES OF HYPERINFLATION
During the period of German hyperinﬂation in the 
1920s, a story was told of someone taking stacks of 
deutsche marks, the German currency, to town in a 
wheelbarrow in order to make a modest purchase, 
and—after leaving it for a moment—returning to ﬁnd 
the wheelbarrow stolen and the bills stacked on the 
ground. Other stories told of people in a bar ordering 
their beers two at a time, because the time it took for 
the price of beer to rise was less than it would take 
for the beer to get warm.
After the fall of the Soviet Union, in the 1990s, Russia 
suffered from severe inﬂation. Many people who had 
saved money in cash found that it had become nearly 
valueless. A Russian colleague told one of the authors 
of this text how his mother had thought, at the begin-
ning of the 1990s, that she had enough money saved 
to take care of her in old age. She watched the value 
of her stash of bills go down and down until ﬁnally, in 
desperation, rather than watch it disappear, she took 
it to the store and bought a bag of sugar.
In such a situation, it obviously becomes very difﬁcult to keep a sophisticated economy 
going. People tend to resort to barter—exchanging goods, services, or assets directly for other 
goods, services, or assets—to try to avoid having to deal with a rapidly inﬂating currency. It 
becomes impossible to think about making a deposit at a bank or to work out reasonable terms 
for a loan, and so normal patterns of saving and lending are disrupted. If they can, people may 
try to acquire—or at least keep their accounts in—a “hard,” noninﬂating currency issued by a 
foreign country. Hyperinﬂation is obviously not a good situation; production tends to be lowered 
and unemployment is raised by the chaos that hyperinﬂation causes in an economy.
Hyperinﬂation usually ends when the nearly valueless currency is abandoned, and people 
exchange very large denominations of the old currency for small denominations of a new 
currency. If the new currency is accompanied by a credible government promise to stop 
“running the printing press,” the episode of hyperinﬂation draws to a close. This is what 
happened after the hyperinﬂation of the early 2000s in Turkey; the old lira was abandoned 
in favor of a new currency that removed six zeros. By 2013, the new Turkish lira had a fairly 
stable value of about US$0.50.
barter: exchange of 
goods, services, or as-
sets directly for other 
goods, services, or as-
sets, without the use 
of money

586 
CHAPTER 26 — MONEY, BANKING, AND FINANCE
Even if inﬂation does not reach hyperinﬂation levels, high inﬂation can be disruptive 
to an economy. Over time high inﬂation can wipe out the value of people’s savings, and it 
hurts people who are on ﬁxed incomes (such as nonindexed pensions). It redistributes wealth 
from creditors to debtors, since people now repay debts in money that is worth less than the 
money that they originally borrowed. It creates “menu costs”—literally, the cost of time and 
effort made to update printed menus and other sorts of price lists. Rising or variable inﬂation 
rates create a great deal of uncertainty, which can make it very difﬁcult for households and 
businesses to make sensible plans regarding savings, retirement, investment, and so on. 
For these reasons, stabilization of a country’s price level is among the important goals of 
macroeconomic policy.
1.3 DEFLATION AND FINANCIAL CRISES
Now consider an economy in the opposite situation, in which there is too little money in cir-
culation. In this case, prices must be bid down. A situation of generally falling prices is called 
deﬂation. Why would deﬂation be a problem? While deﬂation makes people’s savings more 
valuable and helps people who are on ﬁxed incomes, it is still disruptive. In this case, wealth is 
redistributed from debtors to creditors. You borrow “cheap” money, but later have to pay back 
with money that is “expensive” It creates menu costs. It creates uncertainty. When people come 
to expect deﬂation, it may also cause them to cut back on spending. Why buy a big item such as a 
car or computer now, if you believe you will be able to buy the same item for less next year?
Deﬂation is often touched off by a ﬁnancial crisis in which many people lose access to the 
opportunity to obtain loans and perhaps access to their own deposits at banks as well. If you 
cannot withdraw money from your account at a bank, and you cannot get a loan, then you 
cannot pay for things. If many people are in this situation, the economy grinds to a halt—or 
at least slows down considerably. Because less money is spent, prices fall.
The Great Depression was accompanied in the United States by just such a collapse in the 
banking system. The “bank runs” or “banking panics” of 1930–33, in which people rushed 
to try to withdraw their deposits all at once, caused many banks to fail. Because deposit 
insurance did not yet exist, people’s accounts at those banks were wiped out. The price level 
dropped 25 percent in just a few years. Falling prices bankrupted business and farmers, and 
thus made conditions even worse.
But deﬂation is not merely “ancient history.” Japan also experienced deﬂation touched 
off by a ﬁnancial crisis in late 1989 after a speculative bubble in real estate and stocks 
came to a sudden end. Japanese banks had, it turned out, racked up huge amounts of bad 
loans—loans on which they would never be able to collect. Some banks were ordered to 
shut down, while others teetered. People became justiﬁably leery of depositing funds—or 
of spending, with the future so uncertain. Because deposits were shrinking, banks were 
unable to lend as much, and because spending was shrinking, the Japanese economy slid 
into recession. Over the next decade and a half, prices steadily fell at a rate of about 1 
percent per year (see Box 26.2).
Many experts feared a similar deﬂation in the United States after the 2007–8 ﬁnancial 
crisis. People were losing their homes and jobs all over the country. Measures aimed at bailing 
out failing ﬁnancial institutions and providing cheaper credit pumped more money into the 
system, with the result that a severe collapse in economic activity was averted. While inﬂation 
remained low, the feared deﬂation did not materialize.
Deﬂation can be very damaging when looked at from the perspective of the real potential 
productivity of an economy. People may want to work and spend, and businesses might have 
great ideas for expansion, but they are constrained by the lack of spendable assets to grease the 
wheels of the economy. For this reason, as well as the problems discussed above with rapid 
inﬂation, stability of the monetary system is an important policy goal for governments and is 
closely related to both the goal of price stability and the goal of raising living standards.

Discussion Questions
1. Which of the three conditions just described—low inﬂation, high inﬂation, or deﬂation—
best characterizes the U.S. economy right now? Do you know of any country currently in 
one of the other conditions?
2. Unemployment and inﬂation are usually considered the “bads” that can come with busi-
ness cycles. Compare the costs to society of unemployment to the costs to society of 
inﬂation.
2. WHAT IS MONEY?
You have no doubt that the bills and coins you have in your wallet are “money.” Economists 
would agree with you on that. But in other ways, the manner in which economists use the 
term is very different from the way it is used in popular speech. Money, to an economist, is 
something that plays three speciﬁc roles in an economy, and the cash in your pocket is only 
one form of money.
2.1 THE ROLES OF MONEY
Money is a special kind of ﬁnancial asset (a form of ﬁnancial capital) that has three important 
functions.
First, it is a medium of exchange. When you sell something, you accept money in return. 
When you buy something, you hand over money to obtain the good or service that you 
want. Without a functional medium of exchange, an economy would have to operate as a 
barter system, as mentioned in the earlier example of German hyperinﬂation. You would 
have to trade tangible objects or services directly in order to get other goods or services 
in exchange. This could be quite inconvenient—there would have to be what is called a 
“double coincidence of wants.” For example, if you want pizza and can offer Web design 
services, you would need to hunt around for pizza makers in need of Web design. Such 
BOX 26.2 DEFLATION IN JAPAN
Following a banking crisis in 1989, the Japanese 
economy slid into a situation of recession and deﬂa-
tion, which it has not been able to shake for over two 
decades. A very slow growth rate has been accom-
panied by generally falling prices, which have made 
it very difﬁcult to keep the economy on track.
“As deﬂation became entrenched, consumers ad-
justed accordingly. Instead of splurging on a bottle 
of Chanel fragrance, they started to buy perfume by 
the ounce from peddlers online. Companies adjusted, 
and designer denims gave way to no-frill jeans that 
went for $10 instead of $100 . . . Consumers grew 
accustomed to expecting that the longer they waited, 
the cheaper goods would become. And they held back 
on spending. That led to even less demand and more 
years of deﬂation.”
In 2013, the new Japanese government of Prime 
Minister Shinzo Abe (pronounced ah-bey) tried to 
revive Japan’s deﬂated economy with economic stimu-
lus and monetary expansion. But “for companies to 
feel conﬁdent enough to start raising prices, Japan’s 
consumers have to start spending again, and data 
conﬁrming that trend is mixed.”
In July 2013, “prices rose in Japan last month at 
their fastest pace for almost ﬁve years, offering some 
hope for ending years of debilitating deﬂation that has 
stymied growth. The consumer price index was up 0.7 
percent from a year earlier, the biggest rise since a 1.0 
percent increase in November 2008. Hideo Kumano, 
chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, 
commented: ‘today’s CPI data shows signs of exit 
from deﬂation, but we still need to see improvement 
in the job market and redistribution of wealth . . . to 
declare deﬂation is over.
“The deﬁnition of exit from deﬂation can be politi-
cal, but the key is ‘sustainable’ rises in prices, which 
is difﬁcult to achieve without improvement in the job 
market and salaries,’ Kumano said.”

CHAPTER 26 — MONEY, BANKING, AND FINANCE
merchants may or may not exist, but even if they did, you would certainly have to spend 
some considerable time ﬁnding them. With money, on the other hand, you can sell your 
services to anyone who wants them and use the money you receive to buy pizza from 
anyone who supplies it.
Second, money is also a store of value. That means that, even if you hold onto it for a while, 
it will still be good for transactions when you are ready to use it. This is obviously a necessary 
property, since the pizza makers are unlikely to accept your money in exchange unless they 
know that, a month from now, their landlord will also accept the same money when they 
pay their rent. In serving as a store of value, money serves as a way of holding wealth—like 
any other form of ﬁnancial or real capital that is held because it is worth something. The 
thing that makes money distinct from other assets is its liquidity, that is, the ease with which 
it can be used in exchange. Money is highly liquid—you can take it to the store and use it 
immediately. If you own a car, shares in a business, or a valuable piece of jewelry, these are 
also ways of storing your wealth, but they are not liquid. You must convert the value stored 
in them to money before you can buy something else.
The third role of money is that it is a unit of account. Things are often assigned money 
values even if they are not actually being bought and sold. When a ﬁrm estimates the value 
of unsold inventories in its warehouses in order to calculate its proﬁts or losses, for example, 
or a town assesses the dollar value of a house even though there are no plans for it to be sold, 
they are using money as a unit of account.
Some ways in which we commonly use the term “money” differ from how economists 
use it. For example, we might say that someone “makes a lot of money” because he has a 
high annual income. Income, however, is a ﬂow variable, measured (as described in Chapter 
1) over a period of time. Money is a stock variable—a particular kind of asset. A person who 
makes a lot of income over a year may acquire a large stock of money—or he may not. If 
the income is quickly spent on goods and services, the person may have high income (over 
the year) but accumulate little money (measured at a point in time).
We may also say that someone “has a lot of money” if she has accumulated a lot of 
wealth. But this is also not technically correct. A wealthy person may hold a lot of her 
assets in the form of corporate shares, real estate, or Renaissance paintings, rather than as 
spendable, liquid money. Middle-class families are sometimes described as “house rich, but 
cash poor” exactly for this reason. If they attempt to hold a high proportion of their assets 
as home equity, they may end up with very little in the way of funds that they can actually 
spend—that is, money. Liquidity issues aside, holding money (a particular ﬁnancial asset) 
is not the same as holding a tangible asset with useful physical properties. Money is thus 
not the same things as wealth or income. This is an important distinction, on which we 
will elaborate in later chapters.
2.2 TYPES OF MONEY
Throughout much of history, commodity money was the most common type of money. Com-
modity money is, or is made up of, something that contains intrinsic value and is also used in 
exchange. Coins made of gold or silver are probably the most familiar example. Decorative 
beads, shells, ﬁshhooks, and cattle have served the purpose in some cultures. In prisons and 
prisoner of war camps, cigarettes sometimes developed into a medium of exchange. “Prices” 
for chocolate or other goods and services were quoted in terms of numbers of cigarettes re-
quired in exchange. (Cigarettes thus had exchange value in this system even to nonsmokers, 
for whom they had no intrinsic value.)
To be used as money, a commodity must be generally acceptable, standardized, durable, 
portable, scarce, and, preferably, easily divisible. Standardization is important, so that disputes 
do not arise about the quality and value of the money. Coins stamped by the government are 
a popular kind of money because the stamp is a sign that they are of equal weight and purity 
liquidity: the ease of 
use of an asset as a 
medium of exchange
commodity money: 
a good used as money 
that is also valuable 
in itself
intrinsic value: 
value related to the 
tangible or physical 
properties of the 
object

of mineral content. Gold and silver have historically been popular because coins made from 
them are durable. The scarcity of gold and silver was also an important factor. Coins made 
of, say, wood, in an area with many forests would rapidly lose value as everyone could just 
make their own. Divisibility is also important. Heavy gold ingots might be useful for buying 
expensive real estate, but are not very useful for buying pasta for dinner. Smaller coins, 
and coins made of less valuable minerals, were historically minted to provide a medium of 
exchange for smaller purchases.
Gold and silver coins, while fairly portable, can still be inconvenient to carry around in 
large quantities. Individual banks, state governments, and national governments have at 
various times issued paper monies that represent claims on actual commodities, usually gold 
or silver. For many years, starting in the late 1880s, government-issued silver certiﬁcates 
were the main form of domestic paper money in the United States. International transactions 
were, for many years, based on gold reserves. When people carried such a piece of paper, 
they could think of it as a certiﬁcate showing that they owned a bit of an ingot in Fort 
Knox.
In the 1960s, however, due to an increase in the price of silver, the government eliminated 
silver certiﬁcates and replaced them with what you probably have in your pocket today. 
What is commonly called a “dollar bill” is, if you look at it, ofﬁcially called a Federal 
Reserve note. At about the same time, the U.S. government also removed silver coins 
from circulation, replacing them with look-alike coins made from cheaper nickel-clad 
copper. In 1971, President Richard Nixon took the U.S. economy off the international 
gold standard.
So what is the basis of value of the coins and dollar bills we use today? The basis of value 
is—precisely and no more than—the expectation that the dollar bill will be acceptable in 
exchange. The currency and coins we use now are what are called ﬁat money. “Fiat” in Latin 
means “let it be done,” and a legal authority does something “by ﬁat” when it just declares 
something to be so. A dollar bill is money because the government declares it to be money. In 
other words, its intrinsic value is no more than the value of the piece of paper of which it is 
made; but ﬁat money possesses exchange value, which is the value of the goods or services 
that such money can pay for in the market.
Fiat money is what some people call a “social construction”—something that works in 
society because of how people think and act toward it, not because of something it intrinsically 
“is.” Fiat money works well as long as people are generally in agreement that it has value. 
Later, we examine some cases in which people have stopped agreeing—when people have 
lost conﬁdence in the value of their money.
As economies become more and more sophisticated, however, even carrying around paper money 
is inconvenient for many purposes. Nowadays, you are likely to make many of your transactions 
by other means, such as making electronic funds transfers from your bank. Understanding what 
types of transactions are said to involve “money” requires understanding how various assets differ 
in their liquidity as well as the distinction between money and credit.
2.3 MEASURES OF MONEY
Because different assets have different degrees of liquidity, it is difﬁcult to draw distinct lines 
between which assets are “money,” which are “near-money,” and which are “not money.” 
As a result, economists have devised various ways of deﬁning and measuring the volume of 
money that is circulating in a given economy.
Coins and bills are obviously “money.” In the United States today, coins are 
manufactured by the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia, Denver, San Francisco, and West Point, 
NY, while bills are created by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington, DC, 
and Fort Worth, Texas. When economists measure a country’s “money supply,” only 
currency that is in circulation is included—that is, not currency sitting in a vault at the 
ﬁat money: a me-
dium of exchange 
that is used as money 
because a government 
says it has value, and 
that is accepted by 
the people using it
exchange value: 
value that corre-
sponds to the value of 
goods or services for 
which the item can be 
exchanged

CHAPTER 26 — MONEY, BANKING, AND FINANCE
Mint or at a bank. In October 2012, currency in circulation in the United States totaled 
$1.073 trillion.
But checking accounts are also extremely liquid. People can pay for many things using 
paper checks and, increasingly, debit cards and electronic transfers of funds from their checking 
accounts. The most commonly used measure of the amount of money in an economy at a given 
point in time, then, includes not only currency in circulation but also the value of checkable 
deposits as well as the value of travelers checks, called M1 or, less formally, “pure money.” 
In October 2012, checkable deposits totaled $1.332 trillion, and travelers checks were $3.9 
billion, so M1 totaled $2.409 trillion.
Many people can now move funds from their savings accounts to their checking accounts 
with the click of a mouse or make electronic payments directly from their savings accounts. 
So shouldn’t savings accounts also be considered “money”? A measure called M2 includes 
everything in M1, plus savings deposits and other funds such as small certiﬁcates of deposit 
and retail money market funds (those owned by individuals and businesses). One can often 
write checks against money market accounts, so from a liquidity perspective they are in some 
ways almost indistinguishable from M1. M2, which totaled $10.21 trillion as of October 
2012, is now more than four times the size of M1. When economists talk about “the money 
supply” they usually mean either M1 or M2.
While not quite as liquid as M1, M2 types of money are liquid enough to be labeled 
“near-money.” If we include large certiﬁcates of deposit and money market funds owned or 
managed by large ﬁnancial institutions, we arrive at M3. Specialists even use other broader 
categories of money. The principal reason for the different classiﬁcations is to allow for 
different points on the liquidity continuum that distinguish money from other kinds of assets 
(see Figure 26.1). While it is clear that currency is money and that real estate is not, the line 
separating money from nonmoney assets is not clearly deﬁned.
What about using a credit card to make a purchase? From the user’s point of view, 
using a credit card often seems to be like using a debit card or cash from one’s pocket. 
In economists’ terms, however, one does not use “money” when paying with a credit 
card. When paying on credit, you are, technically speaking, taking out a temporary 
loan from the credit card company. Only one day a month, when you send a check or 
electronic transfer to your credit card company from your checking account, do you 
make a “money” transaction.

money supply that 
includes currency,

and travelers checks

Figure 26.1 The Liquidity Continuum
Items more to the left are more liquid or, in 
other words, more easily used to purchase 
something of value. The farther to the right 
on this continuum, the less liquid the item 
is. Currency is as liquid as it gets, and real 
estate is usually about the most difﬁcult 
asset to convert to money (seldom taking 
less than a few months).

2. What do you commonly use to make payments? Cash? Credit cards? Online payments? In 
which of these cases are you using “money”?
3. THE BANKING SYSTEM
It is easy to understand how the U.S. Mint and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing cre-
ate currency, and how they could create more or less of it. But how does currency make its 
way into people’s wallets? How are bank deposits such as checking accounts created? How 
can the volume of currency and deposits be increased or decreased over time, as a matter of 
macroeconomic policy? To understand the answer to these questions, we need to know more 
about how a contemporary banking system works.
The central bank of the United States, most commonly known as the Federal Reserve 
(or “Fed,” for short) determines how much currency should be produced and puts it into 
circulation. In addition, the actions of the Fed together with actions of private banks create 
the economy’s volume of checkable deposits. For much of Europe, now that many countries 
have joined together in using the euro as a common currency, the equivalent institution to the 
Fed is the European Central Bank (ECB). Most countries have combined systems of private 
and central banking, which work at least roughly like the system described in this chapter. 
The workings of this combined system are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 27. Here 
we start by looking at private banks.
3.1 PRIVATE BANKS
In the discussion of the market for loanable funds in Chapter 24, we assumed that some agents 
lend and others borrow, but we paid no attention to how borrowers and lenders would ﬁnd 
each other. An individual might go to a relative or friend for a loan. But when the borrower is 
operating in a more impersonal way—perhaps because the borrower is a business, not an indi-
vidual, or does not have personal contacts with individuals who can make the needed loan—an 
intermediary is needed to put together would-be lenders with would-be borrowers.
A private bank is a type of institution called a ﬁnancial intermediary. Individuals and 
organizations deposit funds with ﬁnancial intermediaries, for safekeeping, to provide the 
convenience of writing checks, or to earn interest. The ﬁnancial intermediaries use the funds 
deposited with them to make loans to individuals and organizations that seek to borrow funds.
A private bank is a for-proﬁt business, meaning that it seeks to make earnings on its 
activities. It does this by charging interest (and perhaps other fees) on the loans it makes. One of 
its functions is to screen the parties seeking loans, in order to determine their creditworthiness. 
Lending is a risky business—not all loans made will be paid back in full. Demanding physical 
assets as collateral can alleviate some of the risk.
For example, mortgages and home-equity loans are collateralized by the value of a house; 
if the owner defaults on the loan the bank may take possession of the house. Many educational 
loans are backed up by government guarantees. Other loans are made on the basis of an 
evaluation of, say, the strength of a business plan and a business’s record in paying back 
past loans. Banks may charge different interest rates depending on the riskiness of a loan or 
deny a loan request outright.
To understand what happens in a banking system, we start with a private bank’s simpliﬁed 
balance sheet, shown in Table 26.1. A balance sheet is a standard double-entry accounting 
representation of a private bank’s assets and liabilities. It must “balance” in that assets and 
liabilities must add up the same amount. The right-hand side of a balance sheet, as shown 
in Table 26.1, lists an organization’s liabilities. An economic liability is anything that one 
economic actor owes to another. The funds that you deposit in a bank are listed among the 
bank’s liabilities, because it has an obligation to repay these funds to you.
Except in the case of banking panics, depositors are not likely all to show up at the same 
time, demanding their funds in cash. Although the bank must keep some funds on hand to

CHAPTER 26 — MONEY, BANKING, AND FINANCE
meet depositors’ withdrawal needs, normally it can use most of the deposits that it holds to 
obtain earnings.
Assets of an organization are listed on the left-hand side of a balance sheet, as shown in 
Table 26.1. Bank reserves, shown as an asset, include vault cash that the bank keeps on hand 
to meet likely short-term calls, such as depositors’ withdrawals. Reserves also include deposits 
that the private bank has made in an account at the Federal Reserve (discussed in Chapter 27). 
The bank owns these Federal Reserve deposits in the same way that bank customers “own” 
the deposits on their liability side. Banks are required to maintain a certain portion of their 
assets with the Federal Reserve, and these deposits do not earn interest.
One safe way for the bank to earn some interest is to lend money to the federal government 
(i.e., to the U.S. Treasury). Recall from Chapter 25 that the U.S. Treasury borrows from the 
public when it needs to ﬁnance a government deﬁcit or reﬁnance part of the debt. It does 
this by issuing government bonds, which give the buyer the right to speciﬁc payments in the 
future. Depending on the duration of the loan, these securities may be called “bills” (sometimes 
called “T-bills,” i.e., Treasury bills), “bonds,” or “notes.” We will use the term “government 
bonds” to represent any type of federal government security.
Very active markets exist for trading federal bonds, and a particular bond may change hands 
many times before it is paid off. Banks tend to keep some of their assets—about one-quarter, 
on average—in government bonds, because bonds earn interest but are also relatively liquid. 
If it looks as if depositors will want more cash back than a bank has in its vault, the private 
bank can quickly sell some of its government bonds on the open bond market.
The major asset of a private bank—and the major way that it makes its earnings—is its 
portfolio of loans other than government bonds: funds that are owed to the bank by businesses, 
households, nonproﬁts, or nonfederal levels of government. Unlike T-bills, which can be 
liquidated quickly if necessary, some of these may be business loans, home mortgages, or 
consumer loans that will not be repaid for years.
Such assets are generally far less liquid than vault cash or T-bills. This can potentially 
be problematic in difﬁcult times. The health of a private banking system depends on having 
depositors who are conﬁdent about the safety of the funds that they have entrusted to the 
banking system and are not trying to withdraw their funds more rapidly than such loans 
are repaid. If conﬁdence in the banks diminished, and many customers wanted to withdraw 
their money, some banks might ﬁnd themselves with insufﬁcient liquidity (i.e., too many 
of their assets in long-term loans) to service all requests, further undermining conﬁdence in 
the system.
3.2 BANK TYPES
The banks with which most people are familiar are known as retail banks, which perform the 
functions that we have already described: keeping money in secure deposits, providing check 
writing services and clearing checks, and extending loans (Table 26.2). Commercial banks 
are similar to—and indeed often overlap with—retail banks, the main difference being that 
commercial banks tend to hold more assets because their clients include businesses. Savings 
and loan banks are also similar to retail banks but specialize in the provision of home loans 
to their customers. Credit unions are also similar to retail banks, except that instead of being 
privately owned they are collectively owned by their customers.

THE BANKING SYSTEM 
593
Private banks are exclusive, catering to high net worth individuals and companies. Their 
functions range widely from traditional banking to many forms of investment, some of which 
is moderate to high risk. Investment banks mostly deal with companies instead of individuals 
and do not offer any traditional banking services. In other words, their principal function is 
to make asset values grow. 
Central banks are an entirely different institution. They exist to regulate the banking system 
and ensure monetary and interest rate stability in the economy. Chapter 27 deals speciﬁcally 
with the U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve.
The functions of banks are subject to government regulation. The Banking Act of 1933 
(called the Glass-Steagall Act) required that traditional banking functions be strictly separated 
from the ﬁnancial and investment activities of private banks and investment banks. While the 
most common way in which a bank was able to make money was simply to charge higher 
interest rates to lenders than to depositors, private banks and investment banks could engage in 
riskier types of investments and often enjoy much higher returns on their money. The purpose 
of the Glass-Steagall Act was to protect bank customers from excessively risky investment 
activities by their banks that might jeopardize the value of their savings accounts.
In the late 1980s, many savings and loan banks (S&Ls) went bankrupt because they had invested 
too many of their assets in unduly risky real estate ventures. Savings and loans had been suffering 
for many years because higher interest rates in the late 1970s made many customers averse to 
taking out loans, and the growth of money market accounts gave depositors an attractive alternative 
to the S&Ls. In response, the government relaxed regulations on their activity, allowing them to 
invest in “higher return” areas but without adequately overseeing where the money was going.
During this time and in the aftermath of the S&L crisis—for which the U.S. government 
had to provide sizable bailouts at taxpayer expense—many were saying that the Glass-Steagall 
Act survived in name only. In 1999, Congress passed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which 
formally overturned certain provisions in Glass-Steagall, eliminating the separation between 
traditional and investment banking. At the time, many hailed this as a necessary modernization 
of the ﬁnancial system, but as we will see in later chapters, others argue that looser regulation 
contributed to the ﬁnancial crisis of 2007–8 (see Box 26.3).
3.3 HOW BANKS CREATE MONEY
As we saw earlier, the U.S. Mint and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing are responsible 
for producing the country’s supply of currency. But there is another way in which money is 
created, and private banks play a critical role in the process.
If you have ever taken out a loan from a bank, you know that the money that you borrow 
is not generally delivered to you as a bundle of cash. Rather, the bank credits your bank

CHAPTER 26 — MONEY, BANKING, AND FINANCE
account—if you have one—for the amount of the loan, or it creates a new transactions account 
in your name. Consequently, when banks make loans they increase the money supply, because 
transactions accounts make up part of M1 and the broader money supply.
You might think that depositing money in the bank would similarly increase the money 
supply, because doing so also leads to an increase in deposits at the bank. But merely making 
a deposit does not, in fact, increase the money supply. While your act does increase total 
deposits, it also takes the same amount of currency out of circulation (i.e., into the bank’s vault), 
thereby reducing the money supply. In this instance, the composition of the money supply is 
altered—less currency, more transactions deposits—but its total remains unchanged.
Yet your deposit does enable a bank to increase the money supply because the bank can 
now make new loans—hence, create new money—based on your deposit. To see how this 
works, it is important to keep in mind that banks are not required to hold in their vaults or 
on reserve all the money that they receive for a deposit. Far from it. As noted earlier, banks 
can use most of their assets to obtain earnings.
The banking system is a fractional reserve system in which only a small percentage of 
the total value of deposits, usually around 10 percent, must be kept on reserve. The portion 
of bank reserves that are kept to satisfy the minimum requirement is known as required 
reserves. If banks must hold 10 percent of every new deposit on reserve, it means that banks 
can lend out the other 90 percent. So when you make a deposit at your local bank, at least 
BOX 26.3 SHOULD WE REINSTATE THE GLASS-STEAGALL ACT?
In response to the global ﬁnancial crisis of 2007–8, 
various politicians and pundits have argued for the 
reinstatement of the Banking Act of 1933 (called the 
Glass-Steagall Act) provision that separated traditional 
banking from investment activities. Those voicing 
support for reinstating the Act represent a range 
of political views, from Representative Paul Ryan, a 
Republican from Wisconsin, to Elizabeth Warren, 
Democratic senator from Massachusetts. In 2011, 
Representative Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat from Ohio, 
introduced the Return to Prudent Banking Act, which 
would effectively reinstate the Glass Steagall “ﬁrewall” 
between ordinary banking and investment banking. 
Although the Act has been cosponsored by 84 other 
members of Congress, and supported by resolutions 
passed in 17 states, it has not been voted on.
Would the ﬁnancial crisis have been avoided if that 
provision of Glass-Steagall had not been repealed 
in 1999? As is usually the case in economic debates, 
opinions differ. According to a hedge fund manager, 
James Rickards, who supports reinstatement:
In 1999, Democrats led by President Bill Clinton 
and Republicans led by Sen. Phil Gramm joined 
forces to repeal Glass-Steagall at the behest of 
the big banks. What happened over the next 
eight years was an almost exact replay of the 
Roaring Twenties. Once again, banks originated 
fraudulent loans and once again they sold them 
to their customers in the form of securities. The 
bubble peaked in 2007 and collapsed in 2008. 
The hard-earned knowledge of 1933 had been 
lost in the arrogance of 1999.
But Andrew Sorkin, ﬁnancial columnist for The 
 iÜÊ9ÀÊ/iÃ] argues that while reinstatement may 
represent a step in the right direction, it would not 
have prevented the crisis. He notes that some of the 
most troubled banks during the crisis, including Bear 
Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch, were all 
solely investment banks and thus would not have been 
limited by the provisions of Glass-Steagall. Those banks 
that did perform both traditional banking and invest-
ment activities generally would have still encountered 
problems with Glass-Steagall provisions in place. For 
example, Bank of America’s difﬁculties were attributed 
to its acquisition of Countrywide Financial, which had 
made many bad subprime loans that would not have 
been covered under Glass-Steagall. Sorkin suggests 
that the main cause of the crisis was simply that too 
many banks provided loans to businesses and individu-
als who could not pay them back. We discuss the causes 
of the ﬁnancial crisis in more detail in Chapter 30.

90 percent of its value is classiﬁed as excess reserves, which a bank is free to lend to other 
customers.*
So even though your deposit does not directly increase the money supply, it does help 
increase it to the extent that banks are willing to lend out their excess reserves. Banks are 
usually eager to lend out excess reserves, because this is how they can make money on them. 
But sometimes, in periods of ﬁnancial crisis, banks prefer to hold onto excess reserves. In 
Chapter 27, we explore in greater detail how the Federal Reserve inﬂuences the banking 
system’s process of money creation.
Discussion Questions
1. How do banks lend money that they do not physically possess to their customers? Are 
they really creating money in the process?
2. Does it bother you that banks hold only a small fraction of the value of their deposits on 
reserve? Why or why not?
4. MONEY AND FINANCE
In the past, the average person with a little extra money had few options for what to do with 
it other than putting it in the bank. Today, however, people have numerous ﬁnancial invest-
ment alternatives available. Many people, including those classiﬁed as “small investors,” ﬁnd 
themselves with funds that they do not need at the moment and would like to accumulate a 
nest egg. But how can they choose among the many different options, including mutual funds, 
individual stocks, bonds, or other assets? This book does not attempt to offer speciﬁc advice 
on this question. However, a better understanding of the economy as a whole, and of ﬁnance 
in particular, will help you to make informed economic decisions. In this section, we begin 
to look at the relationship between investment decisions that are good for the investor and 
those that make the economy as a whole more productive—and how these may sometimes 
diverge.
4.1 FUNCTIONS OF FINANCE
The primary and most long-standing function of our ﬁnancial system is the provision of 
money to support direct investment. Such “direct” investment is the same as the “intended 
investment” that we saw in Chapter 24, which is an important reinjection into the circular 
ﬂow that comes from the market for loanable funds (i.e., the ﬁnancial system). The banking 
system is involved in this key function, but here we are interested in the broader ﬁnancial 
system, of which banks form only a part.
In recent years, ﬁnance for other purposes has grown in importance. Portfolio investment, 
once available only to rich individuals, is much more widespread today. This refers mostly to 
investing funds in securities such as stocks or bonds. To an economist, portfolio investment 
is merely another form of saving, a means of postponing consumption while hoping to 
earn a greater return than in a traditional bank. It is not “true” investment in that when one 
buys a stock or a bond, ownership of an existing security is transferred from one person to 
another—there is no addition to the economy’s stock of capital.
A century ago, only the wealthy partook of this form of ﬁnancial planning. Indeed, only 
a minority of the population earned enough to save signiﬁcantly. As this changed, most 
people saved money in traditional banks instead of securities. Only more recently, over the 
past three or four decades, have stocks and bonds been “democratized” in the sense that a 
sizable percentage of the population now owns such assets. The change is largely due to the 
excess reserves: 
the portion of bank 
reserves that banks 
are permitted to lend 
to their customers
*We say “at least” because if the bank held some excess reserves before the new deposit, then more than 90 percent of the 
new deposit would be available to be lent.

introduction of collective (also called “pooled” or “commingled”) investment vehicles, such 
as mutual funds, and their association with deﬁned contribution pension plans.
Finance now provides not only a variety of ways to invest but also more choices for long-
term saving. It also supports speculation, that is, buying securities in the hopes of short-term 
gain. Individuals who speculate are not truly saving—they hope to exploit changes in prices 
to achieve short-term proﬁt. The ﬁnancial system offers them a vast, and growing, array of 
possible securities, each with its own market. The opportunities for speculation are therefore 
substantial. Speculators, unlike “true” investors, entrepreneurs, or businesspeople, do not 
directly contribute to economic well-being. As we will see, however, at a large enough scale, 
speculative activity has the potential to inﬂuence the economy through its impact on income, 
wealth, and spending.
As long as speculators are risking their own funds, the economic impact of their activity is 
limited. Most potential problems emerge when they borrow funds for the purpose. Speculators 
may borrow money in order to exploit what they see as market opportunities based on short-
term price movements. This can create problems when speculators use excessive leverage—
investments based on borrowed funds. As we see in greater detail in Chapter 30, borrowing 
excessively to ﬁnance risky speculative ventures carries the potential to destabilize the entire 
ﬁnancial system and, with it, the economy. Another possible problem, not unrelated, is when 
lenders extend large lines of credit to borrowers who would not ordinarily satisfy minimum 
loan criteria. Both were recurrent problems during the most recent ﬁnancial crisis.
Finally, public ﬁnance relates to how governments ﬁnance their activities. We say relatively 
little about this in the present chapter. Chapter 25 has already covered government ﬁnance 
with particular attention to taxes and spending, and Chapter 31 elaborates on the subject of 
government deﬁcits and debt.
4.2 NONBANK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
There was a time when banks were responsible for most, if not all, economic matters relating 
to money. Today, many other types of ﬁnancial intermediaries exist; indeed, over the past 
few decades, banks have been declining in importance relative to these nonbank ﬁnancial 
institutions. Most savings today go through such institutions, which invest in stocks, bonds, 
and other assets.
For instance, many people have their money in what are known as collective investment 
vehicles (CIVs), which basically offer people alternatives to saving money in a bank. Many 
types of CIVs fall into the category of pooled funds, which accept investments from many 
different investors and reduce the cost of making decisions about investing by managing 
them all together.
The best-known example of a CIV is a mutual fund.* Many individuals place their savings 
in such funds, which offer customers a variety of “baskets” or “pools” of investments. They 
purchase “shares” of a given fund, instead of individual stock shares or bonds. Some funds 
are invested in high-growth stocks with moderate to high risk, for example, while others are 
mostly in government bonds. The number of possibilities is large, as thousands of pooled 
funds exist, invested not only in different classes of stocks and bonds but in commodities and 
other assets (as well as a combinations of two or more of these forms of asset).
Pooled funds have lower fees than funds managed by a broker, because they do not have 
a paid manager looking after an individual investor’s money. At the same time, many believe 
that they offer better returns than bank savings accounts. The returns, however, may vary 
greatly, depending in large part on the riskiness of the investments that compose the fund.
Hedge funds are a special category of CIV that often engages in highly speculative 
investments, promising greater earnings potential than most other funds, along with higher risk.

1940 and are open to the general public. This act was updated by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, discussed in Chapter 30.

 
MONEY AND FINANCE

Because they carry greater risk, hedge funds are only permitted to do business with particular 
(high net worth) individuals and institutions. Hedge funds are not necessarily commingled; 
though it is unusual, a hedge fund can be created by a single very large investor.
Pension funds are another type of CIV that accumulate savings from workers, sometimes 
including a matching contribution from employers, usually over a long period, to be disbursed 
as beneﬁts in retirement. Access to the funds before retirement is highly restricted, with 
signiﬁcant penalties for early withdrawals. To encourage workers to participate (thereby 
voluntarily deferring a percentage of their pay that they could otherwise use for current 
consumption), such funds are granted generous tax breaks, both through reducing taxable 
income by the amount of the employee’s contribution, and by deferring taxes on earnings. 
Nearly 100 percent of retirement fund dollars are invested in some form of pooled fund. The 
availability of and extent of choice among funds offered to workers depend on the terms of 
the speciﬁc company or government pension plan.
Some of the largest investors in the world are pension funds that pool the retirement and 
health savings accounts of workers in the public sector. For example, the California Public 
Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) had about $248.8 billion in investments as of 
December 2012. CalPERS’ income comes from returns on its investments and from the 
health-care and pension plans of more than a million workers and their employers, who are 
government agencies at the state or local level, as well as public schools. CalPERS provides 
health-care beneﬁts to about 1.6 million beneﬁciaries and their families, and retirement 
beneﬁts to about 553,000 individuals.
Another example of a nonbank ﬁnancial institution is an insurance company. You 
might not think of insurance companies as similar to banks, but over time they have come 
to resemble them in some ways. The principal difference is that instead of making a deposit 
with an insurance company, you pay it a premium (monthly, quarterly, or annually) that is 
meant to protect you against a particular risk. The company, however, must have sufﬁcient 
funds available to pay to beneﬁciaries that have the bad fortune (ﬁre, ﬂood, theft, accident, 
ill health, etc.) against which they had been insured. It must therefore earn a return sufﬁcient 
to cover the cost of these payouts. In this way, an insurance company resembles a bank: It 
holds a pool of money that it lends to governments and companies and sometimes even invests 
in stocks or other riskier investments. The huge insurance company American International 
Group (AIG), for example, put billions into risky investments and had to seek a government 
bailout during the ﬁnancial crisis of 2007–8 (discussed further in Chapter 30).
Brokerage services also fall into the category of nonbank ﬁnancial institutions. Securities 
brokers, for example, keep an inventory of different ﬁnancial assets—mostly stocks and 
bonds—that result from playing the role of middleman in transactions between buyers and 
sellers. They earn a commission, a percentage of the transaction, for the service of linking the 
buyer and the seller. Their service provides another option for customers who might otherwise 
put all their savings in a bank account. From the customer’s point of view, funds invested 
with a broker are very liquid—in other words, a broker can easily convert a stock or bond 
into cash for a client. But since the broker is earning his own fees based on what products 
the client buys, questions have recently been raised about whom the broker is most likely to 
be serving: the buyer or the seller? The sellers are apt to be large organizations with close, 
sometimes ﬁnancially rewarding, relationships to the broker. In some instances, brokers have 
encouraged the purchase of stocks or other assets that they knew were unlikely to offer the 
advertised return because they stood to gain from the transaction.
Mortgage brokers perform a similar function, except that their role is speciﬁc to real 
estate purchases. Most homebuyers lack sufﬁcient funds to buy a property outright, so they 
must borrow a portion of the sale price. The mortgage broker earns a fee for helping the 
homebuyer and a lender ﬁnd each other. Traditionally, banks held home mortgages for their 
duration, satisﬁed with the interest income that they provided. More recently, many banks 
more often than not will “ﬂip” the mortgage—that is, sell it to another ﬁnancial interest. Why

CHAPTER 26 — MONEY, BANKING, AND FINANCE
banks have been doing this, and what the buyer of the mortgage does with it, are subjects 
for Chapter 30.
These different examples of institutions engaged in nonbanking ﬁnance represent an 
industry that has been growing in size and importance relative to banking. Their activities 
do not directly affect the money supply unless it is very broadly deﬁned, because loans from 
these entities, unlike transactions using bank accounts, are not liquid (and are therefore 
usually classiﬁed as “nonmoney assets”). Nevertheless, as we will see in chapters to follow, 
they play a critical role in the national economy, as well as in the conduct of monetary policy 
(discussed in Chapter 27).
All nonbank ﬁnancial institutions offer customers alternatives, often much more attractive 
than traditional bank savings. And they exemplify the manner in which the role of money has, 
over time, shifted from being a mere facilitator of real economic activity to playing an active 
and essential part in the real economy, with profound economic implications and consequences. 
We explore the phenomenon in much greater detail in the coming chapters.
4.3 FINANCIALIZATION AND FINANCIAL BUBBLES
By almost any measure, the U.S economy is more dependent than ever on ﬁnance. Total 
ﬁnancial assets were less than four times GDP in 1970; today they are more than ten times 
GDP. In 2009, the total value of ﬁnancial transactions was 73 times GDP, primarily a result of 
rapid growth in high-frequency trading, which permits speculators to buy and then quickly sell 
large quantities of assets. That the economy depends so much on ﬁnance does not necessarily 
pose a problem in itself. Only when ﬁnancial investment behavior ceases to be prudent do 
we run into complications. When economies grow on the basis of mass investment in assets 
with questionable foundations, yet rise in price, the growth is unstable and destined to be of 
short duration. Such irrational speculative price rises are called bubbles.
Possibly the most famous historical example of a speculative bubble is the Dutch tulip 
frenzy (called a tulipomania) in the early 1600s. Different tulip types had different values, 
and since no one knew which type would bloom from a given tulip bulb, mass speculation 
ensued. Initially only the wealthy Dutch were buying them, but eventually the rest of the 
population caught the fever. Because everyone was buying tulips, their price rose rapidly, 
until the peak in March 1637, some select bulbs sold for several times the yearly income of 
a skilled craftsman. Shortly thereafter, however, conﬁdence in their value vanished. Almost 
overnight, the tulip market crashed, and many speculators were ruined.
Almost three centuries later, the U.S. stock market also experienced a speculative bubble. 
Many at the time believed that the rapid increase in stock prices during the 1920s was entirely 
justiﬁed, attributing it to a “new reality” evidenced in the establishment of the Federal Reserve 
in 1913 along with government policies to extend free trade, ﬁght inﬂation, and relax of 
antitrust laws. But what was really driving the bubble was the same factor underlying the 
Dutch tulip craze—the “herd instinct” that causes people to follow what everyone else is 
doing and to believe what everyone else believes. In the 1920s it seemed as if everyone 
was buying stocks. This drove up share prices, in turn making stocks much more attractive. 
The period was also characterized by heavy borrowing, especially by the U.S. middle class. 
Toward the end of the 1920s, a substantial share of consumer debt was taken on in order to 
buy stock shares (instead of consumer goods). In October 1929 the stock market crashed, 
and the Great Depression followed.
In recent years, many other bubbles have developed, such as in East Asia in 1997, in 
Russia in 1998, in Argentina in 1999, and in Iceland in 2008 as well as the recent “dot-com” 
and housing bubbles in the United States. At the root of all of them is a widespread belief 
in the value of an asset or assets that is reinforced by speculative borrowing. Bubbles are 
characterized by a rapid increase in prices that are not generally accompanied by an equally 
rapid improvement in economic conditions. In other words, a deﬁning feature of such bubbles 

 
MONEY AND FINANCE 
599
is that there is seldom any economic basis for them. The buying begets more buying, and the 
appreciation in the asset values is ﬂeeting. Despite having so much experience with bubbles, 
why do we fail to learn from past mistakes?
Speculative bubbles form for two reasons: one psychological and one economic. The 
psychological explanation has to do with the faith or “blind optimism” that people exhibit, 
even when confronted with evidence to the contrary. As discussed in Chapter 8, and contrary 
to traditional economic theory, people are not always rational. One of the mistakes commonly 
made is extrapolating values over time. In other words, if home prices in New York City have 
risen 30 percent in the past year, some might rush to buy property in New York, believing 
that the trend will continue. Another common mistake, as we have noted, is the tendency to 
follow the herd. Even someone who doubts that prices could continue to increase might ﬁnd 
it difﬁcult to resist buying an asset when everyone he knows has already done so (and has 
already made money!). The same phenomenon is at play among money managers. Those 
who take a conservative or contrarian position during a bubble risk performing worse than 
nearly everyone else. This accounts for the tendency of fund managers to “follow the herd” 
in the investment advice given to clients.
The main economic element relating to bubbles is the presence of excess liquidity. As 
we will see in Chapter 27, when interest rates in general are low, borrowing becomes more 
attractive. If interest rates are low, there is less incentive to save money in a bank. In such 
instances, investors tend, instead, to borrow from banks and invest the leveraged capital in 
ﬁnancial assets such as stocks or real estate, in the hope of reaping returns that are higher than 
they could obtain from bank savings. As we have seen, such behavior multiplied throughout 
the macro-economy drives up asset prices on the strength of greater demand for them, leading 
to the inﬂation of a ﬁnancial bubble. Excessive liquidity was a major factor in the housing 
bubble of the 2000s (discussed in detail in Chapter 30).
4.4 THE INTERNATIONAL SECTOR
The monetary systems of other countries both resemble and differ from that of the United States. 
Like the United States, countries such as Japan and a number of members of the European Union 
possess currencies (the yen and the euro) that are “internationally tradable.” What this means 
is that other countries regard these currencies as inherently valuable, and so they are willing to 
accept them as payment for traded goods and cross-border investments. Most countries, however, 
operate with a currency that is suitable as a medium of exchange for domestic purposes but is 
not desired as a store of value for people in other countries. Indeed, many of the wealthy in such 
countries prefer to hold their wealth in assets denominated in dollars, euros, or yen.
International links between countries also provide another asset class (in addition to stocks, 
bonds, and the like), namely, foreign currency. Today, investors in some countries hold a 
share of their assets in foreign currency (mostly the strong currencies listed above) as a store 
of value, because foreign currency cannot be used as a medium of exchange in their own 
country. Some are motivated by the security offered by a stable currency like the yen or the 
dollar, while others like to speculate on changes in the value of a currency, not unlike what 
many players do in the stock market.
Indeed, the ﬁnancial system itself has become globalized. Although international trade has 
increased in the past four decades, the rapid expansion in cross-border ﬁnancial ﬂows is even 
more impressive. As we will see in Chapter 29, ﬁnancial ﬂows and trade are closely related. 
To put it as simply as possible, countries with a trade deﬁcit must borrow from countries 
with trade surpluses. And some countries that persistently run a deﬁcit get to the point where 
they must borrow from other countries not only to continue to purchase imports but also to 
service (i.e., pay interest on) their debt. 
When you hear economists or reporters speak about “global imbalances,” they are referring 
to a world that is increasingly polarized; deﬁcit countries come to depend on borrowing 

600 
CHAPTER 26 — MONEY, BANKING, AND FINANCE
from surplus countries in order to support their appetite for imports, and surplus countries 
rely upon the deﬁcit countries to continue purchasing their exports in order to boost their 
domestic economies and employment. There is little doubt, for example, that other countries’ 
demand over the years for South Korean exports has lifted that country into the group of 
the world’s prosperous countries; other Asian countries—most notably China—have been 
trying to emulate that success. But basic arithmetic prohibits every country from exporting 
its way to growth (since everyone’s exports must be someone else’s imports), and the debt 
that ﬁnances the purchases made by the deﬁcit countries only mounts as global imbalances 
become greater.
These imbalances play an important part in the growing “ﬁnancialization” of the global 
economy. The implications for growth, employment, inﬂation, and sustainability are potentially 
huge. We look into this in much greater detail in the chapters that follow.

27 The Federal Reserve and  
Monetary Policy
In the wake of the ﬁnancial crisis of 2007–8, a lot of attention focused on monetary policies, 
including actions by the Federal Reserve (the Fed) in the United States and the European 
Central Bank (ECB). The Fed took extraordinary measures to keep U.S. interest rates very 
low, in an effort to stimulate the economy. The ECB struggled with debt crises in which some 
of its member states, such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, and especially Greece, needed central 
bank support to keep up with payments to their creditors.
Regulating the monetary system of a national economy by inﬂuencing the actions of banks 
and other ﬁnancial institutions seems to be a daunting task for one country, never mind all 
the countries participating in the eurozone. The United States has the good fortune to have 
a central bank—the Federal Reserve—that needs to tend to the monetary needs of only one 
economy. As this chapter shows, however, managing monetary policy in even one country 
is not without its challenges and controversies. In this chapter, we examine the history, 
structure, and policy-making of the Federal Reserve System, which also gives us a basis for 
understanding the operation of other central banks.
1. THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM
In 1907, the U.S. economy experienced a bank panic, in which depositors lost trust in banks, 
tried to withdraw their deposits all at once, and as a result caused many banks to fail. In re-
sponse, Congress enacted legislation creating the Federal Reserve System in 1913. The Fed 
is a rather odd organization in that it is not exactly part of the government, yet not entirely 
separate from it either. It is overseen by a board of governors whose seven members are nomi-
nated by the president and approved by the Senate and who serve nonrenewable fourteen-year 
terms. One member of the board is chosen by the president to serve as chair for a four-year 
term (though he or she may serve consecutive terms within the 14-year period on the Board 
if renominated by the president). The long terms of service are intended to help insulate the 
Fed from short-term political pressures.
The Fed performs a number of important functions. As noted in Chapter 26, it serves as 
a “banker’s bank” by holding deposits made by private banks. One of the Fed’s important 
day-to-day functions involves using these deposits to clear checks that draw funds from one 
bank and deposit them in another. For example, if you give a check to a friend, who then 
deposits it in her bank, the check goes to a Fed clearinghouse. Your bank’s account at the 
Fed is debited by the amount of the check, while your friend’s bank’s account at the Fed is 
credited with the funds.
If a bank is in need of cash to hold in its vault, it can buy currency from the Fed, using 
the funds in its Fed account as payment. As we have seen, the Fed orders banks to keep a 
certain percentage of their deposits as required reserves, in the form of either vault cash 
or in such deposits at the Fed. Currently, banks are required to keep an amount equal to 

 
MONETARY POLICY 
603
10 percent of their checkable deposits as reserves. If it wishes, a bank may keep reserves 
in excess of the required amount, although if it does it may forgo proﬁtable earnings 
opportunities.
Another of the Fed’s important tasks is to attempt to stabilize the rate of exchange between 
domestic and foreign currencies. It does this by buying or selling dollars in exchange for 
foreign currencies, a process that is detailed in Chapter 29. In addition, the Fed, along with 
other organizations such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), regulates 
banks, attempting to ensure that they operate as much as possible without error or fraud. 
Because the FDIC guarantees the value of many accounts, and the Fed is willing to make 
emergency loans to banks that ﬁnd themselves short of liquidity, the sorts of crises in depositor 
conﬁdence that led to bank runs in the past are now far less likely. (Recall from Chapter 26 
that “liquidity” refers to availability of cash.)
In terms of structure, the Federal Reserve System consists of the board of governors 
based in Washington, DC, and twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks based in Atlanta, 
Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City (MO), Minneapolis, New York, 
Philadelphia, Richmond (VA), St. Louis, and San Francisco. The regional Fed banks also 
have their own branches in many other cities, such as Baltimore, Los Angeles, Miami, 
and Pittsburgh.
The structure of the European Central Bank (ECB) is somewhat similar to that of the Fed 
in the United States, the main difference being that it operates across countries. While the 
ECB has headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany, each of the seventeen member countries also 
retains its own national central bank.*
The Fed keeps close track of the economy and tries to sense whether some adjustment 
in the money supply or in interest rates might be necessary to support aggregate demand 
or to counteract undesirable changes in the inﬂation rate. The Fed has the ability to choose 
“targets” for the rate of growth of the money supply or for the level of interest rates. As we 
will see, the two are related, although in recent years focus has generally been on the interest 
rate. We examine the macroeconomic consequences of Fed actions later in this chapter, but 
for right now we concentrate on the mechanics of how the Fed inﬂuences the money supply 
and interest rates.
Discussion Questions

2.1 HOW THE FED CREATES MONEY AND CREDIT
As we saw in Chapter 26, increasing the amount of reserves that a bank holds indirectly 
increases the money supply by permitting banks to lend more money. The additional loans 
increase the number of transaction accounts, adding to the overall supply of money. Each of the 
means that the Fed has at its disposal targets the level of bank reserves. The most commonly 
used tool is open market operations. In open market operations, the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York changes the level of bank reserves by buying or selling government bonds. Such

ations: sales or pur-

CHAPTER 27 — THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND MONETARY POLICY
operations are directed by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is composed 
of the Board of Governors of the Fed and 5 of the 12 regional Fed bank presidents.* Let’s see what 
happens when the FOMC undertakes a purchase of government bonds on the open market.
A simpliﬁed balance sheet for the Fed is shown in Table 27.1. Because currency is issued 
by the Fed, currency in circulation is the Fed’s major liability. You will recall from Chapter 26 
that a liability refers to anything that someone owes to anyone else. Currency is technically 
a liability to the Fed because it is legally redeemable for equivalent value. Formerly, this 
meant that the U.S dollar was backed by its value in gold or silver. Today, the best that one 
could do is get new currency for old currency.

The Fed’s other major liability is the reserves held by private banks. Recall that these consist of vault 
cash plus deposits that the banks have at the Fed. Just as deposits made by individuals at banks are 
the liabilities of the banks, deposits made by banks at the Fed are liabilities of the Fed. The Fed holds 
various assets, but the most important one for our story is its stock of government bonds.
When the Fed makes an open market purchase of bonds, its holdings of bonds increase. 
It generally makes such purchases from a commercial bank, so it pays for the purchase by 
crediting the bank’s account with the Fed by the amount of the purchase.
What does it pay with? Unlike any other actor in the economy, the Fed can create funds 
with the proverbial “stroke of a pen” or, these days, adjusting an entry in a computer database 
at the New York ofﬁce. It simply declares that the bank’s reserves are now higher by the 
amount of the bond purchase. Just as the Fed can authorize production of new currency by the 
Bureau of Engraving and Printing, it is also empowered to create new bank reserves, which 
in turn expand the money supply by permitting banks to make more loans. These new loans 
will end up as deposits elsewhere in the banking system—i.e., new money.
When the Fed makes an open market purchase, it increases something called the monetary 
base (or high-powered money). This is deﬁned as the sum of total currency in circulation 
plus bank reserves. We noted in Chapter 26 that dollar bills in circulation are “ﬁat” money, 
whose value depends on a government declaration that they are money. The monetary base, 
similarly, is a form of ﬁat money that the Fed directly controls.
Suppose that the Fed buys $10 million worth of government bonds from ABC Bank. The 
changes in the Fed’s balance sheet and the balance sheet of ABC Bank are shown in Table 
27.2. The Fed increases both its holdings of assets and liabilities by $10 million—the bonds 
being the asset, and bank reserves the liability. ABC Bank changes only the mix of assets 
it holds, now holding less in bonds and more in reserves. Note that both the Fed and ABC 
Bank balance sheets still balance. If total assets equaled total liabilities before the change, 
they will still be equal after the open market purchase.
So far in our story, reserves have risen by $10 million, but the supply of money in circulation 
(as measured by M1 or other measures) has not changed. But if ABC Bank sees opportunities 
to make proﬁtable loans, it will not let its new $10 million in reserves just sit at the Fed. If it 
just met its reserve requirement before the bond purchase, then all of this new $10 million is 
excess reserves. It can use this $10 million to make $10 million in new loans. This movement 
of $10 million from reserves to new loans is shown in Table 27.3(a).

MONETARY POLICY

Suppose that ABC Bank makes a $10 million loan to Jane’s Construction, and then, after 
obtaining the loan in the form of a check, Jane’s Construction deposits the entire amount of 
the funds at XYZ Bank. (We assume a different bank, since in general recipients of loans do 
not have to deposit them in the originating bank. This also allows us to keep track of changes 
in balance sheets more easily.) The changes in the balance sheets of XYZ Bank are shown 
in Table 27.3(b). Because the way that the Fed clears checks is by increasing or decreasing 
the deposits that it holds for banks, the initial impact on XYZ Bank of the deposit of the 
check by Jane’s Construction is a $10 million increase in both its checkable deposits and its 
reserves at the Fed.
Note, ﬁrst, that the money supply has now increased. Checkable deposits are part of M1, 
and there are now $10 million more in total deposits in the economy than there were before. 
Through an open market purchase of bonds paid for by a “stroke of the pen,” the Fed has 
brought new money into being.
Second, note that XYZ Bank now has excess reserves. If required reserves are 10 percent 
of deposits, it can lend out much of the $10 million in new funds that it has received—$9 
million—while keeping only 10 percent ($1 million) as reserves. (Note that ABC Bank was 
able to lend out the entire $10 million that it received from the Fed. It did not have to keep 
10 percent as reserve, because there was no corresponding increase in deposits at ABC—they 
obtained the $10 million by selling bonds.)
These new loans will, in turn, become new deposits in the banking system (they could 
return to ABC or XYZ bank, but more likely will end up in other banks). Then M1 will have 
increased by the initial 10 million, plus the second-round $9 million—already an increase 
totaling $19 million, which is quite a bit larger than the initial $10 million increase.
Now, of course, the banks that receive the $9 million in deposits resulting from XYZ Bank’s 
loans will ﬁnd that they have excess reserves and will also be able to make new loans, and 
the process will continue. Where will it all end? If each bank that receives new funds lends 
out as much as it can (given the 10 percent reserve requirement), the total amount of new

money will eventually be $100 million*. The logic is similar to the government spending 
multiplier in ﬁscal policy. Just as respending by consumers multiplies the original amount of 
government spending, so the creation of new loans by banks multiplies the original creation 
of new reserves.
The story is actually somewhat more complicated than this because sometimes banks hold 
excess reserves, and often people who take out loans want to hold some of the funds in cash 
or in types of deposits that are not part of M1. So not all high-powered money creation will 
translate directly into new deposits and loans, and monetary expansion will not be quite as 
dramatic as in the example above. Economists deﬁne the money multiplier as the ratio of 
the money supply to the monetary base,
money multiplier

monetary base
=
Using M1 as the measure of money, empirical studies have shown the money multiplier 
in the United States is currently very close to 2. That is, if the Fed acts to increase reserves 
and currency by $10 million, the total increase in the money supply would be expected to 
be around double that:
Δ money = money multiplier  Δ monetary base
$20 million = 2  10 million
With the “stroke of a pen,” the Fed open market purchase of government bonds increases 
the money supply by about twice the value of the initial bond purchase.
Note that, looking at the same story in a slightly different way, the action of the Fed can 
also be seen as increasing the amount of credit extended to private actors in the economy. 
The Fed, in making an open market purchase of government bonds, in essence takes over a 
portion of the public debt that was previously held by private institutions. (Recall from Chapter 
25 that government bonds are issued by the Treasury to ﬁnance federal budget deﬁcits.) The 
new bank reserves created by the purchase of government bonds allow banks to extend more 
credit—new loans—to private actors in the economy.
Traditionally, macroeconomists have tended to look at the asset side of the banks’ balance 
sheets and perceive the story outlined above as a matter of increasing deposits and hence 
increasing the money supply. More recently, some macroeconomists have focused more on 
the liabilities side of the banks’ balance sheets and see this as a story of an expansion of 
credit. While, in some sense, the two views are just “two sides of the same coin,” looking 
at the money face of monetary policy tends to draw more attention to people’s need for 
liquidity, while looking at the credit face draws more attention to issues of how ﬁnancial 
capital is created and distributed within the economy. It is no coincidence that we have these 
two interpretations; as we explore further in Chapter 30—and have alluded to at the end of 
Chapter 26—money is itself a form of debt.
2.2 OTHER MONETARY POLICY TOOLS
As we have seen, if the Fed wants to increase the volume of money and private credit circu-
lating in an economy, it can use open market operations. Open market purchases of govern-
ment bonds increase reserves. Banks will generally then increase their loans, which increases 
deposits and hence the money supply.
While this is, in fact, what the Fed usually does when it wants to expand the money supply, 
it also has other tools at its disposal. Another policy that it can implement is to lower the 
*This can be calculated by using the formula for an inﬁnite series where x is less than one: (1 + x + x2 + x3 + … + xn) =  
1/(1 – x), just as we did in calculating the income/spending multiplier in Chapter 24. In this case x = 0.9.

required reserve ratio. This would have the effect of expanding the money supply by allowing 
banks to make more loans on a smaller base of reserves.
In truth, there is no “single” reserve requirement ratio, as it varies considerably depending 
on type of deposit and size of bank (based on total deposits). For example, the U.S. reserve 
requirement is 0 percent for banks with total transactions accounts less than $12.4 million, 3 
percent for those between $12.4 million and $79.5 million, and 10 percent for those holding 
deposits exceeding $79.5 million. The Fed seldom uses the reserve requirement ratio as a 
monetary tool, however; it last changed the ratio in 1982.
If a bank falls short of having the required amount of reserves on hand, it can borrow 
funds from the Fed at what is called the “discount window” at a rate of interest traditionally 
called the discount rate. In theory, a reduction in the discount rate should increase the money 
supply, because this would lower the cost to a bank of being found to be below its required 
level of reserves. A bank could then be somewhat more aggressive about making loans. In fact, 
however, since the Fed frowns on (and penalizes) banks that are found to be low on reserves 
too often, banks tend to prefer to borrow from one another if they need money in the short 
term (this process is discussed in the following section). In extraordinary circumstances, such 
as during the ﬁnancial crisis in 2008, the Fed has taken the opposite approach, of encouraging 
use of the discount window to promote greater liquidity. 
The Fed can cause the money supply (and credit) to contract, as well. If instead of making 
an open market purchase of government bonds, it makes an open market sale, everything in 
the story we have just told happens in reverse. When the Fed sells bonds, the buyer (usually 
a commercial bank) must pay the Fed. That means the bank has that much less in its reserve 
account. Overall, private banks will now hold more in government bonds and less in reserves. 
(Of course, banks are not forced to buy bonds. However, the Fed can “ﬂood the market” 
with bond offerings sufﬁcient to lower the price to a level so attractive that banks would be 
foolish not to buy.)
If banks hold less in reserves, then they have to tighten up on loans. If they tighten up on 
loans, then there will be fewer deposits. The money multiplier also works in reverse, so that 
the original bond sale has a magniﬁed effect in reducing the total money supply.
The Fed can thus increase the money supply by making an open market purchase of bonds, 
lowering the required reserve ratio, or lowering the discount rate. It can decrease the money 
supply by making an open market sale of bonds, raising the required reserve ratio, or raising 
the discount rate. Of these policy tools, however, open market operations are much the most 
frequently used and most signiﬁcant in affecting the money supply.
In a growing economy, a central bank would rarely want to shrink the money supply in 
absolute terms. A growing economy, as measured by GDP, means ever more transactions 
need to be facilitated by readily available liquid assets and generally growing demand 
by private economic actors for loans. “Loose” monetary policy, in the case of a real-
world growing economy, then, usually means making the money supply grow faster 
than the economy has been growing. “Tight” policy does not mean actually making M1 
fall; rather it just means making the money supply grow slower than the growth rate of 
the economy.
In this section, we have discussed the technical question of how the Fed or another 
economy’s central bank can change the volume of money and credit in an economy. Now 
we can move on to the more interesting questions of why it may—or may not—want to do 
so. We introduce these issues by examining two different situations.

These important base cases are useful for analyzing the situation of certain economies

about monetary policies.
Discussion Questions
1. From the description of the Fed and the earlier discussion of money, can you name some 
things that private banks had to do for themselves before the Federal Reserve System was 
created? What were some of the problems that resulted?
2. Describe in words how a Fed open market operation can increase the volume of money 
in the economy.
3. THE THEORY OF MONEY, INTEREST RATES, AND AGGREGATE DEMAND
Our discussion up to this point has focused on the volume of money and credit in the economy. 
In an economy that is experiencing fairly low inﬂation and that has a healthy banking system, 
most of the concern with the money supply is really a concern about interest rates, the avail-
ability of credit, and their consequences for aggregate demand. In contemporary discussions 
of the Fed’s monetary policy, the focus is almost always on interest rates. How does the Fed 
affect interest rates, and how do changing interest rates affect the economy?
3.1 THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AND OTHER INTEREST RATES
In recent years, when changes in monetary policy have been announced by leaders of the 
Fed or discussed in the ﬁnancial pages of the newspaper, attention usually focuses on what is 
called the federal funds rate. This is the going rate of interest determined on a private market 
of interbank loans. If a bank ﬁnds that it has more reserves than it needs to meet its reserve 
requirements, it offers funds on the “federal funds” market, usually just overnight. If another 
bank is short on reserves, it borrows on that market and pays back the next day.
Although a quick reading of reports in the media often make it sound as though the Fed directly 
controls the federal funds rate (for example, headlines may read “Fed Announces Cut in Federal 
Funds Rate of 0.25 Percent”), this in not, in fact, the case. The Fed announces desired target or 
benchmark levels for the federal funds rate and then acts on bank reserves to try to achieve that 
target. Because the Fed is generally quite effective at this, the difference between the (ofﬁcial) 
target federal funds rate and the (market-determined) actual federal funds rate is usually small.
A simpliﬁed model of the federal funds market is portrayed in Figure 27.1a. The quantity 
of funds is on the horizontal axis, and the federal funds rate—the price of borrowing on this 
market—is on the vertical axis. (Note that this is just a speciﬁc variant of the sort of “market for 
loanable funds” discussed in Chapter 24.) The actors on both sides of this market are banks.
The supply curve for federal funds slopes upward, because higher returns on this market 
mean that banks with excess reserves will be more likely to lend them here, rather than ﬁnding 
other ways to lend them out. The demand curve for federal funds slopes downward, because 
the lower the interest rate, the more willing banks are to borrow. Figure 27.1a portrays a 
situation in which the federal funds rate at which the market clears is 6 percent. (Interest 
rates are generally stated in annualized terms—what borrowers would pay if they held the 
loan for a year—no matter how long the loan is actually held.)
The Fed undertakes open market operations with the goal of pushing the going rate for 
loans in that market to the level of its choosing. Recall that when the Fed makes an open 
market purchase, it increases the quantity of reserves that banks hold. All else being equal, 
this increases the amount of reserves available for private lending in the federal funds market. 
In Figure 27.1b, this is shown as the supply curve for federal funds shifting to the right. In 
this example the federal funds rate falls to 5 percent.

THE THEORY OF MONEY, INTEREST RATES, AND AGGREGATE DEMAND 
609
Since 1995, the Fed has explicitly announced its targets for the federal funds rate and 
then has taken the necessary steps to keep the actual rate as close as possible to the target 
rate. Figure 27.2 shows how the Fed reacts to a shift in the demand for federal funds. A rise 
in demand for federal funds is shown by shift A. If the Fed took no action in response to 
this shift, the increase in demand would cause the interest rate to rise. The Fed counteracts 
this upward pressure by putting more reserves into the system via open market purchases, 
shifting the supply curve outward (shift B). The effect is to virtually ﬁx this important interest 
rate. Conversely, the Fed would meet a decrease in the demand for federal funds with open 
market sales.
Because ﬁnancial markets in a sophisticated economy tend to be closely interlinked, a 
drop in the interest rate in one major market tends to carry over into other markets. When 
banks have to pay more to borrow reserves, they tend to charge more to their own customers. 
Figure 27.3 shows how the prime rate—the rate that banks charge their most creditworthy 
commercial customers—closely follows the federal funds rate. Banks have generally kept 
their prime rate at the federal funds rate plus three percentage points.

610 
CHAPTER 27 — THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND MONETARY POLICY
The rate that you, as an individual, will be charged by a bank on a loan will generally be 
higher than the prime rate, and the interest rate that you receive on your deposits will always 
be lower than the prime rate (so that the bank can make a proﬁt). Nevertheless, consumer 
rates also tend to rise or fall with changes in the federal funds rate.
As a general rule, an expansionary monetary policy expands credit and lowers interest 
rates throughout the economy. Conversely, contractionary monetary policy tends to shrink 
the volume of credit and raise interest rates throughout the economy.* Thus central bank 
monetary policy affects businesses and individuals throughout the economy.
3.2 INTEREST RATES AND INVESTMENT
Economists are particularly interested in interest rates because of their effect on investment. 
To the extent that individuals or businesses make investments using borrowed funds, higher 
interest rates make investing more expensive, and, hence, less attractive. Residential invest-
ment, in particular, has historically been especially sensitive to variations in interest rates. 
Traditionally, investment in homes has been ﬁnanced by ﬁfteen- or thirty-year mortgages. A 
small change in the interest rate can add up, over time, to a very big difference in the total 
cost of buying a house.
The case for interest rate effects on intended business investment in structures, equipment, 
and inventories (sometimes referred to as “nonresidential investment”) is a bit more mixed. 
We saw in Chapter 24 that Keynes did not think that changes in the interest rate would be 
sufﬁcient to get the economy out of the Great Depression. Investor pessimism during that 
period was very deep. Trying to encourage businesses to invest when they see no prospect of 
selling more of their goods has been referred to as attempting to “push on a string.”
The idea that business ﬁxed investment primarily responds to changes in sales much more 
than to changes in interest rates has been called the accelerator principle. If businesses see 
their sales rising, they may need to expand their capacity—that is, invest in new equipment and 
structures—in order to keep up with demand for their product. Since the best overall indicator 
of expanded sales is a rising GDP, this principle says that the best predictor of investment 
growth is GDP growth. Conversely, a small decline—or even just slowing down—of demand

may lead to a disproportionate drying up of intended investment, as ﬁrms come to fear being 
caught with excess capacity. To the extent the accelerator principle is in force, changes in the 
interest rate may have only a relatively minor effect on levels of investment.
Given a particular level of optimism or pessimism, however, ﬁrms can be expected 
to pay at least some attention to interest rates in deciding how much to invest. Higher 
interest rates tend to limit the amount of investment by ﬁrms that may need to borrow 
money to invest. Using the string analogy, it is easier to pull on a string than to push 
it—tighter monetary policy is likely to restrain overall investment. Combining this logical 
assumption with the empirically observed sensitivity of residential investment to interest 
rates, our simple model of macroeconomic stabilization says that, all else being equal, 
lower interest rates will lead to higher intended investment spending (and vice versa for 
higher interest rates). Intended investment is inversely related to the interest rate, r, as 
shown in Figure 27.4.
Changes in investor conﬁdence, related to actual spending (via the accelerator principle) 
or to expected levels of spending, can be portrayed as shifting this intended investment curve. 
An increase in investor conﬁdence, for example, shifts the curve to the right (from I1 to I1') as 
shown in Figure 27.5. At any given interest rate, ﬁrms now want to invest more (I** rather 
than I*). A decrease in investor conﬁdence shifts the curve to the left.
3.3 MONETARY POLICY AND AGGREGATE DEMAND
Our basic model of aggregate demand, developed in Chapters 24 and 25, can now be expanded 
to include the effect of monetary policy. In an economy with low inﬂation and a stable banking 
system, expansionary monetary policy should tend to lower interest rates (Figures 27.1b and 
27.3) and raise intended investment (Figure 27.4). Because intended investment spending, II 
is part of aggregate demand:
AD = C + II + G + NX 
this increase in investment should shift the AD schedule upward and raise the equilibrium 
levels of aggregate demand, income, and output, as shown in Figure 27.6.
The chain of causation can be summarized as:

CHAPTER 27 — THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND MONETARY POLICY
If the economy is headed toward a recession, then monetary policy that is relatively loose, 
increasing the money supply in order to help maintain output, can have a desirable stabilizing 
effect. Sometimes such an expansionary monetary policy is called an accommodating 
monetary policy, especially (though not exclusively) when the Fed is reacting to a speciﬁc 
economic event that might otherwise tend to send the economy into recession.
Contractionary monetary policy, however, would be prescribed if the economy seems 
to be heading towards inﬂation. In that case, the Fed seeks to slow growth and “cool down” 
the economy. In the aggregate demand model, a decrease in the money supply will raise 
interest rates, lower intended investment, shift the AD schedule downward, and lower the 
equilibrium levels of aggregate demand, income, and output.*
Discussion Questions
1. What sorts of interest rates are relevant to your own economic activities?? Do you think 
that Fed policies affect their levels?
2. Is it always true that an increase in the money supply leads to an increase in investment 
and aggregate demand? Why or why not?
4. MONETARY POLICIES IN PRACTICE
4.1 THE FED AND INVESTMENT, 2000–2012
The effect of Fed policy on investment can be illustrated with several recent historical ex-
amples. In late 2000, the federal funds rate stood at 6.5 percent. But there were signs that the 
economy might be heading into recession: The “dot-com” stock market bubble had burst, 
and policymakers were worried that the pattern of enthusiastic investment and consumer 
spending that had fueled GDP growth in the 1990s might be coming to an end. Orders for 
goods had slowed down. Inventories had built up. In January 2001 the Fed, publicly express-
ing concern about the weakness of the economy, took action to lower the federal funds rate 
by half a percentage point. Then, the next month, it lowered it again. Throughout the period 
2001–3, it steadily pushed interest rates down, as shown in Figure 27.7. The federal funds 
rate reached a low of 1 percent in early 2004.
What was the consequence for investment and aggregate demand? The bottom half of 
Figure 27.7 shows the data for residential and nonresidential private ﬁxed (i.e., noninventory) 
investment. Nonresidential fixed investment—business investment in equipment and 
Figure 27.6 Expansionary Monetary Policy and the AD Curve
In this model, expansionary monetary policy 
lowers interest rates, raises investment 
spending, and raises aggregate demand, 
income, and output.

structures—might seem to move in the direction opposite of that predicted by the theory of 
investment presented earlier (Figure 27.4). As interest rates steadily fell through 2001 and 
most of 2002, this kind of investment fell.
But recall that the theory said that “all else being equal” a lower interest rate should lead 
to higher intended investment—and all else was not equal during this period. Businesses had 
too much capacity and inventory and were pessimistic about sales. In terms of the model, 
Figure 27.8 shows this pessimism shifting the intended investment schedule to the left, from 
I1 to I1'. The lower interest rates due to Fed action may have kept investors from cutting back 
even more, but the lower rates were not enough to prevent the downturn in nonresidential 
(and overall) investment, shown on the graph as a shift from I* to I**.
Residential investment, however, shows what many consider a success story for monetary 
policy during this period. While ﬁxed business investment fell markedly, investment in 
housing did not fall, but in fact increased steadily (as shown in Figure 27.7). Even though 
the economy in general was in recession for much of 2001, and investment overall was in 
a slump, housing investment grew over this period. By November 2002, nonresidential 
investment had also started growing again.
By May 2004, the Fed believed that the recovery was well under way and would continue. 
It returned to focusing on its other main macroeconomic goal: controlling inﬂation. For the

CHAPTER 27 — THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND MONETARY POLICY
next three years, the Fed steadily increased the federal funds rate in an attempt to keep the 
economy from “overheating.” But in late 2007, the Fed again switched to an expansionary 
stance, largely due to problems that had developed in the housing market.
As you can see in Figure 27.7(b), residential investment went into a slump in 2006, 
due to overbuilding in the earlier period. Problems in the ﬁnancing of home mortgages 
also created a crisis in the credit markets. As we discuss in Chapter 30, during the 2004–7 
period banks had aggressively moved into the marketing of “subprime” mortgages (loans 
given to people whose incomes or credit histories ordinarily would not be good enough 
to qualify them for mortgages). When borrowers found it impossible to pay back these 
loans, the value of mortages held by banks and other investors fell drastically, creating a 
ﬁnancial crisis and pushing the economy towards recession. Fearing a domino effect that 
would lead to a severe recession, the Fed took steps to make more money available—an 
expansionary monetary policy.
As a clear indicator of the Fed’s aggressive attempt to forestall recession, it allowed the 
federal funds rate to sink to historic lows, and far more quickly than during the previous rate 
reduction. The rate sank from 5.26 percent in mid-2007 to scarcely above 0 (0.16 percent) 
by the end of 2008. For the next ﬁve years, the fed funds rate remained at extraordinarily low 
levels—in late 2013 it stood at 0.09 percent. Unfortunately, in spite of all the Fed’s efforts, 
the economy fell into recession, and economic recovery was very slow. As of 2013, the Fed’s 
policy remained to keep rates at rock-bottom levels.
Since even a near-zero federal funds rate was insufﬁcient to promote the lending 
required to kick start the economy, the Fed resorted to an unusual approach known as 
quantitative easing (QE). Instead of following its regular open market program of 
government bond purchases, under QE the Fed buys other diverse ﬁnancial assets (mostly 
bonds, but many with terms longer than usual) from banks and nonbank institutions alike. 
The main objective here is not an interest rate target but, rather, to ﬂood the economy 
with more money, in hopes of provoking the necessary spending to create an economic 
stimulus (see Box 27.1).
As of 2013, three rounds of quantitative easing, referred to as QE1, QE2, and QE3, had 
taken place. Analyses of the effectiveness of the Fed’s policy are varied. On the one hand, 
there is wide agreement that Fed support was needed to respond to the worst recession since 
the Great Depression of the 1930s. Although it took time, the economy did start to recover, 
and it appears that low interest rates and quantitative easing played an important role in this, 
especially in promoting a housing market recovery through low interest rates for mortgages. 
But some critics warned that such a massive program of monetary expansion could have 
undesired effects, such as fueling further ﬁnancial bubbles or causing inﬂation to rise. To 
evaluate these concerns, we need to look a little further into monetary theory.

MONETARY POLICIES IN PRACTICE 
615
4.2 THE LIQUIDITY TRAP AND CREDIT RATIONING
As noted above, the federal funds rate hovered just over 0 percent from 2008 through 2013.* 
This represented perhaps the most expansionary monetary policy in U.S. history. Insofar 
as recovery was very slow, there was a strong case for continued loosening. But remember 
our earlier analogy of pushing on a string. As the Fed continues to add to the monetary base 
and expand the money supply, there is a possibility that it will just create more “slack in the 
string”—the money will not ﬁnd its way into useful investment and job creation.
In the 1930s, Keynes introduced the term liquidity trap for a situation in which it is 
impossible for a central bank to drive interest rates down any lower. In the past few years, 
the United States appears to have hit this monetary policy wall.
The way a liquidity trap works is that as the Fed creates money, banks, individuals, 
and business ﬁrms simply hold onto the money, rather than using it in ways that increase 
aggregate demand. Recall that, for expansionary monetary policy to work in the predicted 
way, banks have to respond to increases in their reserves by making new loans. But what 
if banks do not ﬁnd many of their customers creditworthy or their usual customers are not 
very interested in taking out new loans? Low interest rates may not translate into new credit 
and new investment, if bankers are not willing to make new loans. Instead, the banks may 
hold the money as excess reserves to protect themselves against problems with bad loans 
or other ﬁnancial demands. This problem repeatedly frustrated the Fed’s attempts to spark a 
recovery from the 2007 crisis.
Instead of using extra funds to make more loans, banks may tend to engage in credit 
rationing in order to ensure their own proﬁtability. This means that they will lend to the 
customers whom they deem most creditworthy, using restrictive standards to decide who 
merits getting a loan. If this happens, some ﬁrms and individuals will get the funds that they 
BOX 27.1 FED CHAIRMAN DEFENDS STIMULUS PROGRAM
In testimony to Congress in February 2013, the 
Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, played 
down concerns about the Fed’s economic stimulus 
campaign, describing it as necessary and effective. 
In response to the economic crisis, the Fed has 
acquired nearly $3 trillion in Treasury and mortgage-
backed securities, and under the QE3 program of 
“quantitative easing” it plans to expand its holding by 
$85 billion a month until economic growth picks up 
and the labor market improves. The Fed also intends 
to hold short-term interest rates near zero at least until 
the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent.
Mr. Bernanke tried to soothe concerns that the 
Fed’s policies might encourage excessive risk-taking by 
investors, or lead to renewed inﬂation. Mr. Bernanke 
indicated that the Fed took these concerns very seri-
ously, and had expanded its efforts to monitor ﬁnancial 
markets. But he also pointed out that inﬂation under 
his chairmanship had been the lowest in the period 
since World War II.
“We do not see the potential costs of increased risk-
taking in some ﬁnancial markets as outweighing the 
beneﬁts of promoting a stronger economic recovery 
and more rapid job creation,” said Mr. Bernanke.
In July 2013, Mr. Bernanke reiterated that “with 
unemployment still high and declining only gradually, 
and with inﬂation running below the Committee’s 
longer-run objective, a highly accommodative mon-
etary policy will remain appropriate for the foresee-
able future.”
As of late 2013, predictions by critics that the Fed’s 
policies would lead to runaway inﬂation had not come 
to pass. Inﬂation remained at historically low levels, 
and inﬂationary expectations were only a little over 
1 percent. At the same time, there was a steady, but 
slow, decline in unemployment, and a modest revival 
in consumer conﬁdence.

need, while others—and particularly smaller ﬁrms and lower-income individuals—may be 
frozen out. In this case, monetary policy may have signiﬁcant distributional effects: in the 
simplest terms, making the rich richer, and the poor poorer.
The possibility of a liquidity trap or of reluctance among bankers and investors to lend 
and borrow means that the Fed faces limitations in its ability to stimulate a sluggish economy 
(see Box 27.1). This does not necessarily mean that the Fed’s efforts are fruitless. As of late 
2013, evidence indicated that the Fed’s purchases of existing mortgages from banks had freed 
up banks to create new mortgages, improving the situation in the housing market. But at the 
same time the creation of so much new money raises concerns that some of the money might 
go to the wrong places, creating inﬂation in asset and goods prices. As of late 2013, this had 
not occurred. But concern about future inﬂation suggests that we should take a further look 
at monetary policy responses to inﬂation.
Discussion Questions
1. What is quantitative easing? How is it different from open market operations? Has the 
Fed had favorable results with it since the 2007 ﬁnancial crisis?
2. Explain the liquidity trap. Do you think that the theory accurately describes the events 
after the Great Recession?
5. THE THEORY OF MONEY, PRICES, AND INFLATION
Section 4 laid out a description of the Fed’s roles and activities that derives from an assump-
tion of an economy in which inﬂation is low and steady, so that the main thing the Fed has to 
worry about is helping to stabilize the levels of investment, aggregate demand, and output. 
Now let’s switch to the opposite extreme. Suppose that the central bank’s main worry is con-
trolling inﬂation. Some different analyses will be helpful in understanding this case.
5.1 THE QUANTITY EQUATION
One way of thinking about the relationship between the real economy, money, and prices is 
based on what economists call the quantity equation:
M  V = P  Y
In this equation, Y is, as usual, real output or GDP. P indicates the price level as measured by a 
price index, for example the GDP deﬂator discussed in Chapter 20. The multiplication of these two 
variables means that the right-hand side of the equation represents nominal output (if necessary, 
review Chapter 20 for an explanation of the difference between nominal and real output).
On the left-hand side, M measures the level of money balances, such as the M1 measure 
discussed above. V, the only really new variable here, represents the velocity of money. The 
velocity of money is the number of times that a dollar changes hands in a year, in order to 
support the level of output and exchange represented by nominal GDP. In other words, since 
the money in circulation is insufﬁcient to “purchase” everything entailed by GDP, velocity 
represents how often, on average, each dollar changes hands in order for there to be sufﬁcient 
funds to purchase all the goods and services produced in the economy. (Remember that we are 
talking both about cash and bank deposits—so “changing hands” could be literal, as when you 
pay for a pizza with cash, or virtual, as when a bank clears a check on one account, making 
the funds available to another account holder.)
Since nominal GDP and M1 are observable, velocity can be calculated as the ratio of 
the two,
V
P
Y
M
=
×
quantity equation: 
M × V = P × Y
where M is the 
money supply, V is the 
velocity of money, P is 
the price level, and Y 
is real output.
velocity of money: 
the number of times 
that a dollar would 
have to change hands 
during a year to 
 support nominal  
GDP, calculated as  
V = (P × Y)/M

 
THE THEORY OF MONEY, PRICES, AND INFLATION 
617
For the quantity equation to become the basis for a theory, rather than merely represent 
deﬁnitions of variables, an assumption needs to be made about velocity. Supporters of 
different economic theories all have subscribed to the irrefutable arithmetic of the quantity 
equation. Where they have differed is over assumptions regarding the behavior of one or 
more of the variables.
Two theories we discuss below—classical and monetarist—assume that velocity is 
constant—changing very little, if at all, with changing conditions in the economy. If this 
is true, then the level of the money supply and the level of nominal GDP should be tightly 
related. We denote this assumption that velocity is constant by putting a bar over V. The 
quantity theory of money, then, is characterized by the relation
M  ×V = P  Y
where ×V is read “V-bar.” More Keynesian-oriented theories, however, while they may make 
use of the quantity equation, do not assume that velocity is constant. Their analyses are not 
based on the quantity theory.
5.2 COMPETING THEORIES
Classical monetary theory is based on the quantity theory of money, plus the assumption that 
output is always constant at its full-employment level.* That is,
M  V = P  Y*
where Y*, as usual, denotes full-employment output. In this case—in contrast to the aggregate 
demand model described in Section 4—changes in the money supply can have no effect on 
the level of output. The inability of changes in the money supply to affect real output is called 
monetary neutrality. The only variable on the left-hand side that is not constant is the money 
supply, while the only variable on the right-hand side that is not constant is the price level. 
Thus, all that a change in the money supply can do is change prices. Rather than an increase 
in the money supply increasing output, in this model an increase in the money supply has no 
effect other than to cause inﬂation.
Classical economists, then, tend to see no need for discretionary monetary policy. On the 
contrary, they consider it counterproductive. In the case of an economy that is not growing, 
classical theory would prescribe a stable money supply level to avoid unnecessary changes in 
prices. In a growing economy, classical theory says that the money supply should grow at the 
same rate as real GDP in order to keep prices stable. If we assume that the rate of real GDP 
growth is fairly constant, then the money supply should just grow at a ﬁxed rate, say 3 percent 
per year. A central bank that enforces this is said to be following a money supply rule.
Another famous theory based on the quantity equation is monetarism, propounded by 
Milton Friedman and Anna Jacobson Schwartz in their book A Monetary History of the United 
States, 1867–1960, published in 1963. While Keynes had argued that insufﬁcient investment 
and aggregate demand caused the Great Depression, Friedman and Schwartz argued that it 
was caused by a severe contraction in the money supply.
Friedman had earlier propounded the quantity theory of money and has become known for 
his saying that “inﬂation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.” But unlike the 
pure classical theorists, he thought that bad monetary policy could have, at least temporarily, 
bad effects on the real economy. During the early years of the Great Depression, he and 
quantity theory of 
money: the theory 
that money supply 
is directly related to 
nominal GDP, accord-
ing to the equation  
M × ×V = P × Y
*We simplify here, but to be precise, the classical view is that the economy will always tend toward full employment 
equilibrium in the long run. Please review Chapter 24 for a comparison between the classical and Keynesian views on this 
point.

618 
CHAPTER 27 — THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND MONETARY POLICY
Schwartz pointed out, both the money supply and the level of nominal GDP fell sharply. This 
empirical observation can be seen as consistent with the quantity theory of money:
They argued that the contraction in the money supply caused the reductions in both the price 
level and real GDP—an assertion that remains controversial. Because of his belief in the potential 
for bad monetary policy to cause harm, Friedman was one of the most vocal proponents of the 
idea that central banks should simply follow a ﬁxed rule of having the money supply grow at a 
steady rate. In this regard, he and most classical theorists would have been in agreement.
The quantity equation can also be used to shed light on the problem of very high inﬂation, 
described early in Chapter 26. Suppose that the level of output in an economy is stagnant or 
growing only very slowly. But at the same time suppose that the central bank is causing the 
money supply to grow very quickly. If people come to expect high inﬂation, money may become 
a “hot potato”—people want to hold it for as short a time as possible because it loses value 
so quickly. They will try to turn money into non-inﬂating assets—real estate, hard currency, 
jewelry, or barterable goods—as quickly as they can. This means that the velocity of money 
also increases. A situation of hyperinﬂation in a stagnant economy can be illustrated as:
where the bar over Y indicates that output is stuck at a level below full employment. With 
output stagnant, and both money supply and velocity increasing, inﬂation must result.
While we imagined a printing press in the government’s basement in our earlier story about 
hyperinﬂation in Chapter 26, a sophisticated economy can also essentially “run the printing 
presses” if the agency that issues government debt and the central bank work together. For 
example, suppose that the U.S. Treasury issues new debt, and the Fed immediately buys the 
same amount of new debt and injects new money into the economy. The effect is the same 
as if the Fed had just printed new currency, except that the increase in bank reserves is in the 
form of “a stroke of the pen” instead of freshly printed paper. This is called monetizing the 
deﬁcit. In the United States, however, the Fed does not automatically buy new government 
debt. It may, as an accommodating move, monetize some deﬁcit spending by the government 
in order to help the economy out of a recession, but it is not obliged to do so.
Even in less extreme cases, a “loose money” policy can lead to inﬂation. For example, 
suppose that the economy is functioning relatively normally, but output has reached its full-
employment level (Y*). If monetary policy continues to be expansionary, inﬂation is likely 
to result. (This is discussed more in Chapter 28.)

6. COMPLICATIONS AND POLICY CONTROVERSIES
In the real world, central banks generally have to be concerned about output and inﬂation, 
as well as banking regulation and stability, all at the same time. When the goals include both 
stabilization of prices and of output, how does this complicate the analysis, and what does 
this mean for policy?

COMPLICATIONS AND POLICY CONTROVERSIES 
619
6.1 THE FED’S DILEMMA
As we saw in Section 3, the Fed tries to get the economy out of a recession through expansion-
ary monetary policy—policies that increase the money supply, lower interest rates, stimulate 
investment, and thus increase aggregate demand. But if it goes about increasing the money 
supply too vigorously or at the wrong time (such as when the economy is already nearing 
full employment), then it can cause inﬂation to rise (as we saw in Section 4). If inﬂation is 
“heating up,” then the Fed should use contractionary monetary policy—reining in the money 
supply, raising interest rates, and discouraging investment in the interest of “cooling off” 
aggregate demand and economic activity.
This may seem very straightforward, but policy-making can have many complications. 
For one thing, there is the controversial question of what exactly the “full-employment” 
level of employment is at any given time. Suppose, for example, that the Fed starts to get 
nervous about inﬂation too early in an economic upswing. Perhaps the unemployment rate 
could have fallen to, say, 4 percent, with little increase in inﬂation, if the recovery had been 
allowed to continue, but the Fed switches into inﬂation-ﬁghting mode at an unemployment 
rate of, say, 6 percent. By halting the recovery too early, the Fed may end up being blamed 
for causing unnecessary suffering. But if conditions in the economy are such that letting 
unemployment fall to 4 percent would cause a large rise in inﬂation, then if the Fed lets the 
recovery continue, it will instead end up being blamed for inﬂation.
There is also considerable controversy over what rates of inﬂation can be considered 
acceptable. Some economists ﬁnd only inﬂation rates from 0 percent to 2 percent acceptable; 
others do not see an urgent need for monetary control unless inﬂation is 5 percent or higher. 
There is a continuing debate among economists and policymakers over the proper weight to 
give to GDP growth goals versus price stabilization goals (see Box 27.2).
Another practical problem is that monetary authorities have to pay attention to issues of 
timing. In Chapter 25 we discussed the “inside lags” of decision making and implementation 
as well as the “outside lag” of an enacted policy having an effect on aggregate demand. In the 
case of ﬁscal policy, the “inside lags” tend to be rather long, as Congress and the President 
try to agree on a budget, but the “outside lag” is relatively short. For monetary policy, the 
case tends to be reversed. The Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet eight 
times a year and may schedule extra meetings. A monetary policy decision only requires 
BOX 27.2 RAISING INFLATION TARGETS IN JAPAN 
“Japan’s new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared a 
‘monetary regime change’ as the central bank bowed 
to government pressure, setting a 2 percent inﬂation 
target aimed at helping the country emerge from its 
prolonged bout of deﬂation . . . Some economists believe 
a moderate amount of inﬂation is grease that can make 
the wheels of the economy spin faster” (Associated Press, 
January 22, 2013). Japan has been stuck in a deﬂation-
ary pattern for decades, as the central bank has had 
trouble even achieving its 1 percent inﬂation target. 
In August 2013, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko 
Kuroda pledged to continue easing until the 2 percent 
inﬂation target is reached. The Bank will conduct open 
market operations to increase the monetary base 
from 60 to 70 trillion yen, boosting its purchases of 
Japanese government bonds to total 50 trillion yen per 
year to lower interest rates and promote lending. 
In a speech to the Kyoto Chamber of Commerce 
and Industry, Deputy Bank Governor Kikuo Iwata said 
that it will take time to see the effects of monetary 
easing in the real economy. He predicted that prices 
and wages would rise, together with an increase in 
household income and capital expenditure. The Bank 
was widely expected to take additional ﬁnancial easing 
measures in 2014, reﬂecting concern that it was not 
doing enough to achieve its goal in two years.

CHAPTER 27 — THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND MONETARY POLICY
discussion and agreement among the FOMC’s twelve members, unlike the much more 
extensive discussions required to get a tax or spending change through Congress. Hence 
decisions about monetary policy can generally be made more quickly than decisions about 
ﬁscal policy. But monetary policy only has an effect on aggregate demand as people change 
their plans—often their very long-term plans—about investment and spending. So the “outside 
lag” is generally thought to be longer. There is a danger that the effects of a policy intended to 
counteract a recession may not be felt until the next boom, or the effects of policies intended 
to counteract a boom might not be felt until the next recession, exacerbating the business 
cycle instead of ﬂattening it out.
Lastly, it is not always the case that an economy suffers from either recession or high 
inﬂation. Sometimes, it suffers from both at the same time. Because one problem seems to 
require expansionary policies while the other calls for contractionary ones, in this case the 
dilemma facing the Fed is especially acute. We take up this topic in Chapter 28.
6.2 RULES VERSUS ACTIVISM
Given all these caveats about monetary policy, you might think that the Fed would do better 
just to follow a money supply growth rule as suggested by the quantity theory of money. 
Indeed, a number of classical macroeconomists make just this argument.
But the quantity theory has its problems. For one thing, the velocity of money is not as 
constant as the theory assumes. Because ﬁnancial markets have many linkages, people’s desire 
to hold some of their assets as money, as opposed to another asset, can cause wide swings in 
velocity. For example, when interest-bearing checking accounts became very popular in the 
1980s, M1 grew quickly as people shifted assets from other forms to this new, highly liquid, 
and interest-bearing form. Because V is the ratio of nominal GDP to money balances, the 
sudden rise in the denominator of this ratio caused the velocity of M1 to fall sharply. Likewise, 
when the stock market takes a dive, it is common for many people to seek the relative security 
of money and near-money assets, driving M1 up and velocity down.
Other changes in velocity are harder to explain. Partly this is because people need liquidity 
not only to facilitate transactions related to GDP—that is, domestic newly produced goods 
and services—but also to facilitate transactions related to used goods, purchases and sales 
of assets, and foreign dealings. Financial market innovations, shocks to asset markets, and 
many other developments in the economy can affect velocity. The more unpredictable velocity 
is, the harder it is to make policy based on the assumption of a stable relationship between 
money supply and nominal GDP.
Nor is it true that output is always at its full-employment level, as we saw when looking at 
unemployment rates in Chapter 23 and at business cycles in Chapter 24. In addition, changes 
in prices can have causes other than monetary policy, such as when oil prices rise due to 
shortages or military conﬂict, and drive up other prices throughout the economy.
As a result, many macroeconomists argue for a more ﬂexible and activist monetary policy 
stance. Rather than having the Fed locked onto a particular rule, they suggest that the Fed 
keep an eye on inﬂation but also remain ﬂexible, so that it can respond to new developments, 
including ﬁnancial market changes, price shocks, and threats of recession.
In Chapter 28, we bring together monetary policy, ﬁscal policy, and the twin goals of 
output and price stabilization. We also take into account some of the effects that world 
events, and policy responses to them, have had on the U.S. economy over the past several 
decades.

APPENDIX
A1. BOND PRICES AND INTEREST RATES
The process by which monetary policy inﬂuences interest rates can be explained by examin-
ing the market for federal funds, as was seen in the body of this chapter. Alternatively, it can 
also be explained by looking at the market for government bonds.
A bond represents debt, but, as a particular kind of ﬁnancial instrument, bonds have some 
characteristics worth mentioning. When the government (or a business) borrows by selling a bond 
it makes promises. It promises to pay the bondholder a ﬁxed amount of money each year for a 
period of time and then, at the end of this time, to repay the principal of the loan. The ﬁxed amount 
bond: a ﬁnancial in-
strument that pays a 
ﬁxed amount each year 
(the coupon amount) 
as well as repaying the 
amount of principal 
(the face value) on a 
particular date (the 
maturity date).

 
APPENDIX: BOND PRICES AND INTEREST RATES 
623
paid per year is called the coupon amount. The date that the principal will be repaid is called the 
maturity date. The amount of principal that will be repaid is called the face value of the bond.
So far, it seems simple enough—a $100 bond at 5 percent, for example, speciﬁes that its 
issuer will pay you $5 a year for ten years and then pay you $100 at the end of ten years. 
What makes bond markets more complicated, though, is that bonds are often sold and resold, 
changing hands many times before they mature. During the period to maturity, many factors 
affecting the value of the bond may change, and so the bond price—the price at which 
bondholders are willing to buy and sell existing bonds—may change.
For example, suppose that you bought the bond just described at its face value of $100. 
The bond yield to maturity, or annual rate of return if you hold a bond until it matures, would 
obviously be 5 percent ($5 annually is 5 percent of the $100 bond price). Suppose that after 
a couple of years you want to sell your bond (perhaps you need the cash), but meanwhile the 
rate of return on alternative (and equally safe) investments has risen to 10 percent. People 
will not be interested in buying your bond at a price of $100, because they would get only 
a 5 percent return on it, whereas they could get a 10 percent return by investing their $100 
elsewhere. To sell your bond you will need to drop the price that you demand until your 
bond looks as attractive as other investments—that is, until the $5 per year represents a 10 
percent yield to maturity.
Conversely, if the return on alternative investments has fallen, say to 2 percent, the $5 
per year on your bond looks pretty good, and you will be able to sell it for more than $100. 
Bond prices and bond yields are thus inversely related.*
The U.S. Treasury issues a variety of different kinds of bonds. Treasury bills have a zero 
coupon amount and mature in one year or less. Because the holder receives no coupons, they 
are sold at a discount from their face value. Other Treasury bonds pay a coupon amount every 
six months and have maturities that range from two to thirty years. In the real economy, then, 
there are many different “government bond” prices—and interest rates. It is only for the sake 
of simplicity of modeling that we assume only one type of bond and one interest rate.
Although many people and organizations buy and sell government bonds on what is 
called the “secondary market” (the “primary market” being the Treasury’s initial offering 
of the bonds), the Fed is a major player. Its actions in the market for government bonds are 
large enough to have discernible effects on the whole market. Expansionary policies tend 
to raise bond prices and lower bond yields and interest rates; contractionary policies do the 
opposite.
A simpliﬁed (secondary) bond market is shown in Figure 27.9(a). The price of bonds 
(and the corresponding nominal interest rate) is on the vertical axis and the quantity on the 
horizontal. The supply curve, in this case, is determined by the willingness of people to 
sell bonds—that is, to exchange their government debt for cash, which means, in effect, to 
stop lending to the government. The demand curve is determined by people’s willingness 
to buy bonds—that is, to lend to the government. The effect of a Fed open market purchase 
of bonds is illustrated in Figure 27.9(b). A sizable Fed purchase shifts the demand curve for 
government bonds to the right. As a result, the price of bonds rises. Because bond prices and 
interest rates are inversely related, the rise in the price of bonds means that the going interest 
rate on them falls.**
 *If the bond has one year left to maturity, for example, its value one year from now is $105. We can use the formula 
[Value next year] / (1 + interest rate) = [Value now] to ﬁnd out what you could get by selling the bond today. If the 
interest rate on alternative investments is 10 percent, then $105/(1 + .10) ≈ $95.45. The lower the bond price, the higher 
the bond yield, and vice versa. Conversely, if the return on alternative investments has fallen, say to 2 percent, the $5 
per year on your bond looks pretty good, and you will be able to sell it for more than $100. If the interest rate is 2 
percent, then $105/(1 + .02) ≈ $102.94.
**The exact relationship depends on the time to maturity of the bond. The longer this time, the greater the impact of an 
interest rate change on the bond price.

624 
CHAPTER 27 — THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND MONETARY POLICY
Although this explanation focuses on the market for government bonds, it is actually parallel 
to the earlier discussion of the Fed and the market for federal funds. The interest rate for three-
month Treasury bills and the federal funds rate are graphed together in Figure 27.10 and they 
track each other closely. The bottom line of this story is the same as that given by the model of 
federal funds used in this chapter: A Fed open market purchase drives down interest rates.
A2. SHORT VERSUS LONG-RUN AND REAL VERSUS NOMINAL INTEREST RATES
In the model of interest rates and aggregate demand discussed in Section 3 of the text, we as-
sumed that the Fed, through open market operations, could change the interest rate that inﬂuences 
investment spending. In Figure 27.8 we used the symbol r to denote a generalized interest rate. 
In real life, however, many different interest rates have to be taken into account.
Here we present some basic facts about short-run vs. long-run and real vs. nominal interest 
rates. We also note the difference between the Fed’s focus on the short-term, nominal interest 
rate and the interest rate that investors often consider the most relevant: that is, the long-term, 
real interest rate.

APPENDIX: SHORT VERSUS LONG-RUN AND REAL VERSUS NOMINAL INTEREST RATES 
625
In Section 4.1 we discussed the federal funds rate as the principal interest rate targeted by 
the Fed. This is a short-term, nominal interest rate. It is short term, because while this rate 
is quoted in annualized terms (that is, what borrowers would pay if they kept the loan for a 
year), the loans are actually made on one day and paid back the next. The Fed uses a portfolio 
of government securities with various maturity dates in its open market operations, but many 
of them have maturity dates of three years or less. The federal funds rate—like any interest 
rate that you normally see quoted—is a nominal interest rate, not adjusted for inﬂation. The 
interest rates determined in markets for loanable funds are always nominal rates.
But if you are considering undertaking a substantial business investment project or 
buying a house, the interest rate that you should be taking into account, if you are a rational 
decision maker, is the real interest rate over the life of the business loan or mortgage. The 
real interest rate is:
r = i – π
where r is the real interest rate, i is the nominal interest rate, and π is the rate of inﬂation.
For example, suppose that you borrow $100 for one year at a nominal rate of 6 percent. You 
will pay back $106 at the end of the year. If the inﬂation rate is 0, then the purchasing power 
of the amount that you pay back at the end of the year is actually $6 more than the amount 
you borrowed. However, if inﬂation is 4 percent during the year, the $106 that you pay back 
is in “cheaper” dollars (dollars that can buy less) than the dollars that you borrowed. The real 
interest rate on your borrowing will be only 2 percent. The higher the inﬂation rate, the better 
the deal is for a borrower at any given nominal rate (and the worse it is for the lender).
If inﬂation is fairly low and steady—as we assumed in the aggregate demand model—then 
this difference between real and nominal interest rates is not of crucial importance. If inﬂation 
is steady at, say, 2 percent, then both lenders and borrowers mentally subtract 2 percent to 
calculate the real rate that corresponds to any nominal rate. If the Fed lowers the prime rate 
from 8 percent to 5 percent, for example, then it correspondingly lowers the real rate from 
6 percent to 3 percent.
In recent decades, inﬂation has been fairly low, usually between 1 and 3 percent. But 
inﬂation is not always so predictable. When inﬂation is high or variable, it is very important 
to realize that investors’ decisions are in reality inﬂuenced by the expected real interest 
rate, re:
r e = i – πe
where i is the nominal rate the borrower agrees to pay and πe is the expected inﬂation rate.
The actual real interest rate (r) can be known only with hindsight. That is, only after 
information on inﬂation has come for last month or last year, can you calculate what the real 
interest rate was in that period. But you never know with certainty what the real interest rate 
is right now or what it will be next year. The more changeable inﬂation is, the harder it is to 
form reliable expectations about real interest rates.
Since investors are usually interested in long-run, real interest rates, while the Fed controls 
primarily short-run, nominal interest rates, the impacts of various Fed policies on the economy 
may not be as straightforward as our basic models imply.

If you read the ﬁnancial pages in any newspaper (or sometimes the front pages if economic 
issues are pressing), you will see discussion about government budgets and deﬁcits, interest 
rate changes, and how these affect unemployment and inﬂation. You may also see news about 
changes in the availability of certain crucial resources—particularly energy resources—and 
about how the impact of such changes in resource supplies spread throughout the country’s 
economy. How does economic theory help to make sense of it all?
In Chapter 24, we started to build a model of business cycles, focusing at ﬁrst on the 
downturn side of the cycle and the problem of unemployment. In Chapters 25, 26, and 27, 
we explained economic theories concerning ﬁscal and monetary policy. So far, our models 
have focused on the “demand side,” illustrated by shifts of the aggregate demand (AD) curve. 
In this chapter, we complete the demand-side story so that it includes explicit attention to 
the potential problem of inﬂation. Then we move on to the issue of the actual productive 
capacity of the economy, or “supply-side” issues. Finally, we will arrive at a model that we 
can use to “put it all together.”
1. AGGREGATE DEMAND AND INFLATION
The AD curve in the Keynesian model used in the previous three chapters was graphed 
with income on the horizontal axis and output on the vertical axis. We mentioned that if 
output is above its full-employment level, there may be a threat of rising inﬂation, but 
nothing in the ﬁgures incorporated this idea. The graphs that we used all measured income, 
output, and aggregate demand without considering changes in price levels. It is time now 
to remedy that omission.
1.1 A NEW VIEW OF THE AGGREGATE DEMAND (AD) CURVE
We can develop a different approach to aggregate demand by viewing it in a graphical format 
that compares output to inﬂation. In this approach, the AD curve shows the effect of inﬂa-
tion on the macroeconomic equilibrium level. To show this graphically, we put inﬂation on 
the vertical axis, and output (Y) on the horizontal axis.* This is shown in Figure 28.1. The 
AD curve shown here differs from the Keynesian AD curve, since it takes into account price 
changes, but the points on this new curve all correspond to points where the Keynesian AD 
curve crosses the 45° line.
This view of aggregate demand assumes that higher inﬂation rates will tend to reduce total 
demand, for several reasons:
Aggregate Supply, Aggregate 
Demand, and Inﬂation:  
Putting It All Together
*Some versions of the AD curve use “price level” rather than inﬂation on the vertical axis. The authors of this text believe 
that using inﬂation better represents the reality of an economic system in which prices are rarely constant.

1.2 SHIFTS OF THE AD CURVE: SPENDING AND TAXATION
The downward slope of the AD curve shown in Figure 28.1 is based on the impacts of 
inﬂation on aggregate demand. What determines the position of the curve? As discussed 
in our original Keynesian AD analysis, the position of the AD depends on speciﬁc levels 
of government spending, taxation, autonomous consumption, autonomous investment, 
and net exports.** Changes in these variables will cause the curve to shift.
For example, if the government were to undertake expansionary ﬁscal policy, this would 
shift the AD curve to the right, as illustrated in Figure 28.2. At any level of inﬂation, there 
would now be aggregate demand sufﬁcient to support a higher level of output. Alternatively, 
if output remained constant, there would be higher levels of inﬂation.
An increase in autonomous consumption or investment would have a similar effect, as 
would an increase in net exports. Recall that autonomous consumption is the part of household 
spending that does not depend on income, and autonomous investment is the part of business 
spending that does not depend on the interest rate. These are often used to represent consumer 
and business “conﬁdence.” Thus an increase in consumer or investor conﬁdence could also 
cause the rightward shift in Figure 28.2. Conversely, of course, contractionary ﬁscal policy, 
reductions in consumer or investment conﬁdence, or reduction in net exports would shift 
the AD curve to the left.

different inﬂation levels on Aggregate

CHAPTER 28 — AGGREGATE SUPPLY, AGGREGATE DEMAND, AND INFLATION
1.3 SHIFTS OF THE AD CURVE: MONETARY POLICY
As we have noted, the Federal Reserve usually responds to higher inﬂation by increasing 
interest rates, and this is reﬂected in the slope of the AD curve. This kind of policy response, 
which aims to keep inﬂation near a target level, is a rather passive sort of monetary policy. A 
more active form of Fed intervention occurs when the Fed’s leaders decide to change policy 
more fundamentally—either by changing their inﬂation target or by shifting their focus to 
ﬁghting unemployment.
For example, in a severe recession the Fed might decide that the economy requires 
additional stimulus. If the Fed instituted signiﬁcant expansionary monetary policies, driving 
interest rates down (as it did, for example, starting in 2007), this would, in theory, have the 
effect of boosting investment and shifting the AD curve to the right. Alternatively, if the 
Fed decided that its policies on inﬂation have been too lax, it could tighten monetary policy 
sharply (this happened, for example, in 1982 in response to severe continuing inﬂation). This 
would have the effect of shifting the AD curve to the left.
To summarize:
s  4HE AD curve indicates levels of equilibrium GDP at different possible rates of inﬂation.
s  4HE AD curve can be shifted by changes in levels of autonomous consumer spending, au-
tonomous investment, ﬁscal policy, net exports, or by major changes in monetary policy.
Discussion Questions
1. “The negative slope of the AD curve means that higher levels of output will lead to lower 
levels of inﬂation.” Is this statement correct or not? Discuss.
2. Does the Fed always want the inﬂation rate to be as low as possible? Why or why not?
2. CAPACITY AND THE AGGREGATE SUPPLY CURVE
As we have noted in earlier chapters, increases in AD can push output up toward the full-
employment level. But what happens when output reaches—or maybe even exceeds—the 
full-employment level? In a graph such as Figure 28.2, for example, there is nothing in the 
model that seems to prevent expansionary policies from just shifting the AD curve, and out-
put, up and up and up.
Obviously, this cannot be true in the real world. At any given time, there are only certain 
quantities of labor, capital, energy, and other material resources available for use. The U.S. labor 
force, for example, comprises just over 150 million people. The United States simply cannot, then, 
produce an output level that would require the work of 200 million people. This is a hard capacity 
constraint: What happens as an economy approaches maximum capacity can be modeled using 
the aggregate supply (AS) curve. The AS curve shows combinations of output and inﬂation that 
can, in fact, occur within an economy, given the reality of capacity constraints.
Figure 28.2 The Effect of Expansionary Fiscal Policy or Increased Conﬁdence on the AD curve
If government spending increases, 
taxes decrease, consumers or 
investors become more conﬁdent, 
or net exports increase, demand for 
goods in the economy rises.

CAPACITY AND THE AGGREGATE SUPPLY CURVE 
629
2.1 THE AGGREGATE SUPPLY (AS) CURVE
Figure 28.3 shows how aggregate supply is related to the rate of inﬂation. Starting from the 
right, at high output levels, we can identify four important, distinct regions of the diagram.
First, the vertical maximum capacity output line indicates the hard limit on a 
macroeconomy’s output. Even if every last resource in the economy were put into use, with 
everybody working ﬂat out to produce the most they could, the economy could not produce 
to the right of the maximum capacity line.
Just below the maximum capacity level of output, the AS curve has a very steep, positive 
slope. This indicates that, as an economy closely approaches its maximum capacity, it is 
likely to experience a substantial increase in inﬂation. If many employers are all trying to hire 
many workers and buy a lot of machinery, energy, and materials all at once, workers’ wages 
and resource prices will tend to be bid upward. But then, to cover their labor and other costs, 
producers will need to raise the prices that they charge for their own goods. Then, in turn, 
if workers ﬁnd that the purchasing power of their wages is being eroded by rising inﬂation, 
they will demand higher wages . . . which leads to higher prices, and so on. The result is a 
phenomenon called a wage-price spiral, in which pressure to produce very high levels of 
output leads to a steep rise in self-reinforcing inﬂation.
In the real world, such steep increases in inﬂation are usually the result of dramatic pressures 
on producers, such as often occur during a national mobilization for war. During World War II, for 
example, the U.S. government pushed the economy very close to its maximum capacity—placing 
big orders for munitions and other supplies for the front, mobilizing the necessary resources by 
encouraging women to enter the paid labor force, encouraging the recycling of materials on an 
unprecedented scale, encouraging the planting of backyard gardens to increase food production, 
and in general pushing people’s productive efforts far beyond their usual peacetime levels. As a 
result, unemployment plummeted. The government, knowing that such pressures could lead to 
sharply rising inﬂation (as shown in the wage-price spiral region of Figure 28.3), kept inﬂation 
from getting out of hand by instituting wage and price controls—direct regulations telling 
ﬁrms what they could and could not do in the way of price or wage increases.
The shaded area to the left of the wage-price spiral region in Figure 28.3 indicates, as it did in 
the national income equilibrium graphs in Chapters 24 and 25, a range of full-employment levels 
of output. While it is controversial to say exactly where that level may be, it can be thought of as 
an output level high enough that unemployment is not considered a national problem. And because 
it must be low enough to allow for at least a small measurable level of transitory unemployment, 
the full-employment level of output is slightly lower than the maximum capacity level of output.

CHAPTER 28 — AGGREGATE SUPPLY, AGGREGATE DEMAND, AND INFLATION
Within the full-employment range, Figure 28.3 shows a gently rising AS relationship. This 
is because, even well before an economy approaches the absolute maximum capacity given 
all its resources, producers may tend to run into “bottlenecks” in the supply of some resources. 
Agricultural workers may be plentiful, for example, but professional and technical workers 
may be in short supply. Or fuel oil may be plentiful, but there may be a shortage of natural gas. 
Shortages in the markets for particular kinds of labor and other inputs may lead to an acceleration 
of inﬂation in some sectors of the economy. Because the measured inﬂation rate represents an 
average for the economy as a whole, some aggregate increase in inﬂation may be observed.
This sort of increase in inﬂation that comes with high (but not extremely high) production 
is what economists expect to happen when the economy nears a business cycle “peak.” Note, 
however, that the AS curve has been drawn as nearly ﬂat in part of the Y* range, indicating 
that combinations of full employment and stable inﬂation may also be possible.
When the economy is in recession or recovering slowly from a recession, output is below 
its full-employment level. The ﬂat AS line shown in Figure 28.3 for this region indicates 
that, under these conditions, there is assumed to be no tendency for inﬂation to rise. Because 
a considerable amount of labor and other resources are unemployed, there is no pressure 
for higher wages or prices. It is also likely that because wages and prices tend to be slow in 
adjusting downward, inﬂation will not fall either—at least not right away.
2.2 SHIFTS OF THE AS CURVE: INFLATIONARY EXPECTATIONS
When people have experienced inﬂation, they come to expect it. They then tend to build the 
level of inﬂation that they expect into the various contracts into which they enter. If a busi-
ness expects 5 percent inﬂation over the coming year, for example, it will add 5 percent to 
the selling price that it quotes for a product to be delivered a year into the future, just to stay 
even. If workers also expect 5 percent inﬂation, they will try to get a 5 percent cost of living 
allowance (COLA), just to stay even. A depositor who expects 5 percent inﬂation and wants 
a 4 percent real rate of return will be satisﬁed only with a 9 percent nominal rate of return.
In this way, an expected rate of inﬂation can start to become institutionally “built in” to an 
economy. As a ﬁrst approximation, it is reasonable to assume that people expect something 
like the level of inﬂation that they have recently experienced (an assumption that economists 
call “adaptive expectations”). Thus inﬂation can be, to some degree, self-fulﬁlling.
Because different contracts come up for renegotiation at different times of the year, the 
process of building in particular inﬂationary expectations will take place only over time. 
Because of the time that it takes for prices and wages to adjust, we need to make a distinction 
between short-run and medium-run aggregate supply responses.
The AS curve in Figure 28.3 was drawn for a particular level of expected inﬂation in the short 
run. Before people have caught on to the fact that the inﬂation rate might be changing, their 
expectations of inﬂation will continue to reﬂect their recent experience. The rate of inﬂation at 
which the AS curve becomes horizontal is the expected inﬂation rate. In this model, an economy 
in recession, or on the horizontal part of the AS curve, will tend in the short run to roll along 
at pretty much the same inﬂation rate as it has experienced in the past. Only tight labor and 
resource markets caused by a boom will tend to increase inﬂation, which will come as a surprise 
to people and will not immediately translate into a change in expectations. For the purposes of 
this model, you might think of the short run as a period of some weeks or months.
Over an unspeciﬁed longer period of time—the medium run—however, a rise in inﬂation 
due to tight markets tends to increase people’s expectation of inﬂation.* If they expect 3 percent 
inﬂation but experience 5 percent inﬂation, the next time that they renegotiate contracts they 
may build in a 5 percent rate. Figure 28.4 shows how the AS curve shifts upward as people’s 
expectation of inﬂation rises. Note that the maximum capacity of the economy has not changed—
*As distinguished from the long run, discussed in the Appendix.

 
CAPACITY AND THE AGGREGATE SUPPLY CURVE 
631
nothing has happened that would affect the physical capacity of the economy to produce. All 
that has happened is that now, at any output level, people’s expectation of inﬂation is higher.
Similarly, if people experience very loose markets for their labor or products, over the medium 
run the expected inﬂation rate may start to come down. Employers may ﬁnd that they can still 
get workers if they offer lower COLAs in the new contracts or even force workers to take pay 
cuts. Producers may raise their prices less this year than last year or cut prices, because they are 
having trouble selling in a slow market. When people start to observe wage and price inﬂation 
tapering off in some sectors of the economy, they may change their expectations about inﬂation. 
As people react to the sluggish aggregate demand that occurs during a recession, they will tend, 
over time, to lessen their expectations about wage and price increases. The graph for this would 
be similar to Figure 28.4, but would show the AS curve shifting downward instead of upward.
2.3 SHIFTS OF THE AS CURVE: SUPPLY SHOCKS
The AS curve also shifts when the capacity of the economy changes. A supply shock is some-
thing that changes the ability of an economy to produce goods and services. Supply shocks 
can be beneﬁcial, as when there is a bumper crop in agriculture or a new invention allows 
more goods or services to be made using a smaller quantity of resources. Increases in labor 
productivity also allow an economy to produce more goods and services.
In such cases, the real capacity of the economy expands, as shown in Figure 28.5. The line 
indicating maximum capacity shifts to the right, showing that the economy can produce more 
than before. We model the beneﬁcial supply shock as moving the AS curve both to the right 
and downward. It moves to the right because capacity has increased. It moves downward 
because beneﬁcial supply shocks are often accompanied by decreases in prices. As computer 
supply shock:  
a change in the pro-
ductive capacity of an 
economy
Figure 28.4 The Effect of an Increase in Inﬂationary Expectations on the Aggregate Supply curve
If people come to expect higher 
inﬂation, these expectations get 
built in to wage and price contracts, 
leading to a generally higher level of 
inﬂation throughout the economy.

CHAPTER 28 — AGGREGATE SUPPLY, AGGREGATE DEMAND, AND INFLATION
technology has improved, for example, the price of any given amount of computing power 
has dropped rapidly. To the extent that computers play a signiﬁcant role in the economy, this 
tends to undermine inﬂation.
Supply shocks can also be adverse. In fact, economists were ﬁrst forced to start theorizing 
about supply shocks when the oil embargo during the 1970s resulted in steeply rising oil prices. 
Natural occurrences, such as hurricanes or droughts, and human-caused situations, such as wars, 
that destroy capital goods and lives are other examples of adverse supply shocks. They reduce 
the economy’s capacity to produce and, by concentrating demand on the limited supplies of 
resources that remain, tend to lead to higher inﬂation. Adverse supply shocks would be illustrated 
in a graph such as Figure 28.5, but with the direction of all the movements reversed.
Discussion Questions
1. Describe in words how the AS curve differs from the AD curve. What does each represent? 
What explains their slopes?
2. Do you get “cost of living” raises at your job or know people who do? Why does this 
practice have important macroeconomic consequences?
3. PUTTING THE AS/AD MODEL TO WORK
Economists invented the AS/AD model to illustrate three points about the macroeconomy:
1. Fiscal and monetary policies affect output and inﬂation:
s %XPANSIONARY lSCAL AND MONETARY POLICIES tend to push the economy toward higher 
output. If the economy is approaching its maximum capacity, they will also cause 
inﬂation to rise.
s #ONTRACTIONARY lSCAL AND MONETARY POLICIES tend to push the economy toward lower 
output. Inﬂation is unlikely to fall quickly, but a persistent recession will tend to lower 
inﬂation over the long term.
2. Supply shocks may also have signiﬁcant effects:
s !DVERSE SUPPLY SHOCKS LOWER OUTPUT AND RAISE INmATION
s "ENElCIAL SUPPLY SHOCKS RAISE OUTPUT AND LOWER INmATION
3. Investor and consumer conﬁdence and expectations also have important effects on output 
and inﬂation.
Bearing these principles in mind, we will see how this model helps to explain some major 
macroeconomic events.
3.1 AN ECONOMY IN RECESSION
In Figure 28.6, we bring together the AS and AD curves for the ﬁrst time. The (short-run) 
equilibrium of the economy is shown as point E0, at the intersection of the two curves. De-
pending on how we place the curves in the ﬁgure, we could illustrate an economy that is in a 
recession, at full employment, or in a wage-price spiral. (We temporarily omit the maximum 
capacity line, but we reintroduce it when we discuss inﬂation.)
In this speciﬁc case, the fact that E0 is to the left of the full-employment range of output 
indicates that the economy is in a recession. Private spending, as determined in part by 
investor and consumer conﬁdence, along with government and foreign sector spending, are 
not enough to keep the economy at full employment. The fact that the curves intersect on the 
ﬂat part of the AS curve indicates that inﬂation (in the short run) is stable. So in this situation 
unemployment is the major problem. What can be done?
Figure 28.6 models the real-world situation of the U.S. economy in the 2007–9 recession. 
Unemployment rose to 10 percent in 2009, but inﬂation was very low. In this situation, the 
administration of President Barack Obama called for a major ﬁscal stimulus program, which 

 
PUTTING THE AS/AD MODEL TO WORK 
633
was approved by Congress in early 2009. The goal of the stimulus program, which included 
$800 billion in increased government spending and tax cuts, was to promote employment both 
through its direct impact and multiplier effects expanding private spending and employment. 
This effect is shown in Figure 28.7 as a rightward shift of the AD curve.
As noted in Chapter 25 (Box 25.1), the stimulus plan was responsible for adding millions 
of jobs to the economy. While economists are not in agreement about how large the multiplier 
effects of the program were, many argue that without the program, the economy would have 
continued to plunge deeper into recession.1 The effects, however, were not large enough to 
bring the economy back to full employment. This is reﬂected in Figure 28.7 as an AD shift 
that moves output toward, but not into, the full-employment zone.
How about the effect of this expansionary program on inﬂation? As the AS/AD model would 
lead us to expect, inﬂation did not rise because the economy did not move beyond the ﬂat portion 
of the AS curve. Some economists and political commentators warned that such a high level of 
government spending and deﬁcits would certainly cause serious inﬂation—but as of late 2013, 
four years after the initiation of the stimulus program, inﬂation remained low (See Box 28.1).
Given continued unemployment and low inﬂation, would more macroeconomic stimulus 
make sense? Some economists argued that it would, but proposals for further ﬁscal stimulus 
were not acted on by Congress, largely out of fear that deﬁcits were already too high (for 
more on this debate, see Chapter 31). So the Federal Reserve stepped in with the further 
monetary stimulus known as “quantitative easing” (as discussed in Chapter 27). The hope 
was that a combination of this monetary expansion plus recovering conﬁdence on the part 
of consumers and businesses could lead to a more complete recovery.
This goal (not yet reached as of late 2013) is shown in Figure 28.8. Here we see that a 
larger AD shift brings the economy back into the full-employment zone. At this point, the 
model predicts that there could be at least a slight increase in inﬂation. Detection of such 
rising inﬂation would signal the Fed to cut back on its monetary expansion. Provided any 
inﬂation effect remained small, the overall effort could be judged a success.
As we see later in this chapter, not all economists agree with this analysis. Some classical 
economists argue that inﬂation has merely been delayed but will eventually cause major 
problems and perhaps force a return to recession. We will look into the theoretical issues 
involved later (without providing any deﬁnite judgment on the debate). 
Figure 28.6 Aggregate Demand and Supply 
Equilibrium in Recession
The position of the AD curve indicates a low level 
of aggregate demand, leading to an economy with 
unemployment at equilibrium E0. At this point on the  
AS curve, inﬂationary pressures are low.

CHAPTER 28 — AGGREGATE SUPPLY, AGGREGATE DEMAND, AND INFLATION
We do know, however, that there have been other times in recent economic history when 
inﬂation has been a major problem. What does the AS/AD model indicate about policy in 
such periods? We explore this topic next.
3.2 AN OVERHEATED ECONOMY
Problems with inﬂation were a major issue in the United States starting in the late 1960s. High 
government spending, in particular spending on the Vietnam war, meant that ﬁscal policy 
was excessively expansionary. Monetary policy during this period tended to accommodate 
the ﬁscal expansion. Although unemployment was very low as a result, the economy started 
to “overheat,” causing inﬂation to rise.
BOX 28.1 WHAT HAPPENED TO INFLATION?
As of mid-2013, inﬂation in the United States remained 
sluggish. Prices rose at the slowest pace in at least half 
a century, up just 1.1 percent over the previous year 
as of May 2013, according to the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis. “Inﬂation has been quiet, and perhaps more 
important from a central bank perspective, inﬂationary 
expectations remain subdued” (Norris, 2013). 
Slow inﬂation may sound like a good thing, but it’s 
not . . . Economic research suggests that inﬂation 
is best in moderation. Price increases lead to wage 
increases, which make it easier to repay existing 
debts, like mortgages, and more attractive to in-
cur new debts, like borrowing to start a company. 
Inﬂation also functions as a kind of economic WD-
40, easing shifts in the allocation of resources. It is 
easier for struggling companies and industries to 
adjust by withholding cost-of-living increases than 
by seeking to impose wage cuts. Perhaps most 
importantly, moderate inﬂation keeps the economy 
at a safe distance from deﬂation, or general price 
declines, which can freeze activity as would-be 
 buyers wait for lower prices. (Appelbaum, 2013)
According to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben 
Bernanke, “We are certainly determined to keep 
inﬂation near its objective, not only avoiding in-
ﬂation that’s too high, but we also want to avoid 
inﬂation that’s too low.” According to economist 
Paul Krugman, the current low inﬂation results from 
persistent weakness in the economy, and the need is 
not for anti-inﬂationary policy, but for more economic 
stimulus to ﬁght unemployment. Predictions that 
stimulus policies by the federal government and the 
Federal Reserve would lead to runaway inﬂation have 
been proved wrong by the course of events (Norris, 
2013). While some continue to warn of future inﬂa-
tion, Krugman argues that the reality of continuing 
unemployment imposes immediate, and lasting, costs 
on the economy, and therefore represents the more 
urgent problem to address.

Figure 28.8 A Greater Expansion of Aggregate Demand
If Aggregate Demand increases by a larger 
amount, it can bring the economy back into 
the full employment zone. At equilibrium 
point E1 the AS/AD model indicates the 
possibility of a slightly higher inﬂation level.

Expansionary policy causes the economy to “heat up.” 
In the short run, people respond by increasing output, 
but tight markets for labor and other resources cause 
inﬂation to rise as well at equilibrium point E1.

In the 1960s economist A.W. Phillips identiﬁed an inverse 
relationship between inﬂation and unemployment. While 
this basic relationship still holds true, events of the 
1970s and later showed that inﬂation can be much more 
variable than the simple Phillips principle implies.
This period of history is modeled in Figure 28.9. The AD curve moves further to the right 
due to the increases in government spending. It shifts from AD0, which at E0 corresponds to 
a full-employment equilibrium, to AD1, which crosses the AS curve in the wage-price spiral 
range. The economy became overheated, moving beyond full employment to E1.
The tradeoff between unemployment and inﬂation in the 1960s established a pattern 
that became known as the Phillips curve, after the economist who ﬁrst identiﬁed it. The 
1960s Phillips curve is shown in Figure 28.10. As you can see, the shape of the upward-
sloping portion of the AS curve is essentially a mirror image of the Phillips curve. This is no 
coincidence. The models that economists developed during the 1960s grew out of observing 
such a pattern of unemployment and inﬂation rates and trying to explain why it occurred. 
The Phillips curve relationship seemed to suggest that policymakers could continue to “trade 
off” inﬂation and unemployment—that they could, by use of appropriate ﬁscal and monetary 
policies, choose to settle the economy at any point along the curve. Policymakers could push 
up inﬂation to keep unemployment low or perhaps sacriﬁce some employment to push down 
inﬂation—or so it was thought at the time.
3.3 STAGFLATION
The developments of the early 1970s came as a shock to Phillips-curve–minded economists 
and policymakers. From 1969 to 1970, unemployment and inﬂation both rose, and both stayed 
fairly high through the 1970–73 period. This combination of economic stagnation (recession) 
and high inﬂation came to be known as stagﬂation.
What happened? In 1968, worried about rising inﬂation, President Lyndon Johnson 
persuaded Congress to enact an income tax surcharge. In our model, we show this 
contractionary ﬁscal policy as a leftward shift of the AD curve in Figure 28.11.
This policy move is widely considered to have been “too little, too late” to curb consumer 
and investor spending. By the time the economy started to cool off, inﬂationary expectations 
had become ﬁrmly implanted. Having recently experienced a wage-price spiral, people had 
built expectations of higher inﬂation into their wage and price contracts. As Karl Otto Pohl, 
former president of the Bundesbank, the German central bank, once commented, inﬂation 
stagﬂation: a combi-
nation of rising inﬂa-
tion and economic 
stagnation

636 
CHAPTER 28 — AGGREGATE SUPPLY, AGGREGATE DEMAND, AND INFLATION
is like toothpaste—once you squeeze it out of the tube, you cannot get it back in. Although 
the ﬁscal cutbacks contributed to falling GDP and rising unemployment, they did not bring 
down inﬂation due to this institutional “ratcheting up” of inﬂationary expectations.
The increase in inﬂationary expectations is represented by an upward shift of the AS 
curve. In Figure 28.11, the combination of the contractionary ﬁscal policy and the rise in 
inﬂationary expectations is shown as moving the economy from an overheated boom point 
of E0 to a recessionary, high inﬂation point of E1. This is exactly what happened to the U.S. 
economy in the early 1970s.
The situation became worse later in the decade. In 1973–74, the member countries of the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cut production, greatly increased 
the price at which they sold their oil, and even temporarily stopped shipping oil to certain 
countries. The price of oil, a key input into many production processes, suddenly quadrupled. 
What effect did this have on the macroeconomy?
The impact of the oil price shock is shown in Figure 28.12. The economy starts off in a recession 
at point E0, which is substantially to the left of the initial maximum capacity line. The cut in foreign 
oil production meant that the United States (and many other oil-importing countries) now suffered 
from a reduced capacity to produce goods, which is shown in Figure 28.12 by the maximum 
capacity line and AS curves shifting to the left. Even if labor resources were fully employed, an 
economy with reduced access to other inputs would not be able to produce as much. At the same 
time, the rise in oil prices had an immediate and direct effect on inﬂation, shifting the AS curve 
up as well, as also shown in Figure 28.12. Both inﬂation and unemployment got worse.

Once inﬂationary expectations 
increase, they become difﬁcult to 
reverse. Contractionary ﬁscal policy 
raises unemployment at equilibrium 
point E1, but lowers inﬂation only 
slightly.

Both inﬂation and unemployment get 
worse at equilibrium point E1.

 
PUTTING THE AS/AD MODEL TO WORK 
637
3.4 A HARD LINE AGAINST INFLATION
This was still not the end of the inﬂationary story of the 1970s. Although oil prices held 
steady and inﬂation moderated during the period 1975–78, oil prices jumped again in 1979 
and 1980. In 1979, the price of oil was ten times higher than it had been in 1973. The overall 
inﬂation rate in the United States was more than 9 percent in 1979—and exceeded 10 percent 
(measured at an annual rate) during some months.
The high rates of inﬂation experienced in the late 1970s were very damaging to the economy. 
As we noted in Chapter 26, high rates of inﬂation can wipe out the value of people’s savings 
and make it very difﬁcult for households and business to plan, save, and invest. Because 
unemployment was also high, as shown in Figure 28.12, it was difﬁcult to see how consumers 
and businesses could ever recover conﬁdence while inﬂation seemed out of control.
Even though the economy was already in a recession, and the unemployment rate was above 
7 percent, the Federal Reserve, under the chairmanship of Paul Volcker, took deliberate and 
drastic action to bring the long-term inﬂation rate down, by implementing very contractionary 
monetary policies. The effects of these “tight money” policies during the early 1980s can be 
seen in Figure 28.13.
As discussed earlier, contractionary monetary policy shifts the AD curve to the left. The AS/
AD model predicts that the immediate effect of this policy will be to send the economy even 
deeper into a recession, with output falling even farther below its full-employment level, as 
shown by equilibrium point E1. But there is a further effect, on inﬂationary expectations.
This contractionary policy was accompanied by many stories in the media about how 
Volcker was really committed to bringing down inﬂation, no matter the cost. Because people 
found this commitment credible, their expectations of inﬂation also came down. The effect 
of this decrease in inﬂationary expectations is shown as a downward shift in the AS curve to 
AS1, showing a reduction in inﬂation. Such a recession with falling inﬂation is, in fact, what 
happened during the Volker contraction. By 1983, the inﬂation rate had fallen to 4 percent, 
but at a signiﬁcant human and economic cost. Unemployment during 1982 and 1983 rose to 
nearly 10 percent. But in the years that followed, the economy recovered and employment 
increased, as shown by equilibrium point E2.
The experience of the 1980s showed that after inﬂationary expectations become established, 
they can be reduced only by policies that cause major economic pain. This has led future 
policymakers to be very wary of encouraging any new inﬂationary wage-price spiral. Changes 
in the global economy in the 1990s, however, made achieving low-inﬂation goals signiﬁcantly 
easier, as discussed in the next section.

A very restrictive monetary policy 
drives the AD curve sharply to the 
left, pushing unemployment to very 
high levels. But a resulting decrease 
in inﬂationary expectations shown in 
aggregate supply curve AS1 lowers 
inﬂation and allows the economy to 
recover to equilibrium point E2.

CHAPTER 28 — AGGREGATE SUPPLY, AGGREGATE DEMAND, AND INFLATION
3.5 TECHNOLOGY AND GLOBALIZATION
Following the substantial recession and disinﬂation of the early 1980s, output began to recover 
again. Fluctuations in unemployment and inﬂation continued, though within narrower bands 
than during the earlier years. From 1984 to 2004, unemployment varied from 4 percent to 
about 8 percent and inﬂation from 1 percent to about 6 percent; since 1992 inﬂation has never 
risen above 4 percent, and brieﬂy fell to zero following the Great Recession (raising concerns 
about the opposite problem of deﬂation, as discussed in Chapter 26). Unemployment was 
low throughout the 1990s, but peaked again at 10% in 2010 following the Great Recession, 
and then declined only slowly (see Figures 28.14 and 28.15).

Unemployment peaked in 1982, and again in 2010. 
Since 2010 unemployment has declined slowly, and was 
just above 7% at the end of 2013.

After peaking in 1980, inﬂation fell throughout the 1980s 
and 1990s, and has remained low. Following the Great 
Recession it fell brieﬂy to zero, raising concerns about 
possible deﬂation. By 2011 it had returned to about 2%, 
historically a relatively low level.

Survey, 2013.

We can use our AS/AD analysis to focus on one more period: the expansion of the 1990s. 
From 1992 to 1998, unemployment rates and inﬂation rates steadily fell, as shown in Figures 
28.14 and 28.15. In 1998, unemployment was 4.4 percent, the lowest it had been since 1965. 
Inﬂation was 1.6 percent, lower than it had been in more than 10 years. This was clearly the 
best macroeconomic performance in decades. Unemployment continued to fall for another 
two years, reaching 3.9 percent in 2000.
What caused this sustained recovery? Signiﬁcant advances in innovation—in particular 
enormous leaps in information technology, including the advent of widespread use of the 
Internet and information systems for business supplies, deliveries, and product design—
provided a major impetus for this period of superior macroeconomic performance. This can 
be modeled as a period of beneﬁcial supply shocks, as shown in Figure 28.16.
Many economists also point to increasing global competitiveness as a factor in the rising 
productivity of this period. Competition from foreign ﬁrms, they argue, made U.S. ﬁrms work 
harder to become efﬁcient. Meanwhile, competition from foreign workers and anti-union 
government policies weakened the power of domestic unions. This helped keep wage and 
price inﬂation low (though it also had consequences for the U.S. distribution of income, as 
described in Chapters 10 and 11).
The strong performance of the macroeconomy in the 1990s inspired economic optimism. A 
number of commentators wondered whether we were entering a “new economy” in which business 
cycles would become a thing of the past. Events after 2000 proved otherwise. In 2001–2 the stock 

 
PUTTING THE AS/AD MODEL TO WORK

market crashed, as the “dot-com” speculative bubble burst. About a year later, the economy slid 
into recession. Expansionary ﬁscal and monetary policies, including tax rate cuts and low interest 
rates, helped to promote a recovery from that recession. But in 2007, another even more signiﬁcant 
speculative bubble in housing collapsed, leading rapidly to the most severe recession since the 
1930s—often referred to as the Great Recession because of its length and severity. The housing 
bubble and the Great Recession are discussed in much greater detail in Chapter 30.
This brings us back to the ﬁrst application that we discussed for AS/AD analysis—policies 
to recover from recession. It seems that we have not entered a new, business-cycle–free, 
“recession-proof” economic optimum. Instead, we have relived some of the recessionary 
problems of previous decades. Although the real productivity gains made during the 1990s 
did not go away, and the effects of that part of the expansion persist to this day, the kinds of 
economic ﬂuctuation and policy response that we have tried to model with AS/AD analysis 
clearly remain of prime importance to macroeconomics (see Box 28.2).

Beneﬁcial supply shocks such as 
improved technology move the AS 
curve and the economy’s maximum 
capacity to the right, also tending to 
raise employment and output while 
lowering inﬂation levels, as seen in 
the shifts from E0 to E1 to E2.
BOX 28.2 SOFT JOBS DATA POSES DILEMMA FOR FED 
A disappointing jobs report in September 2013 raised 
questions about whether the Federal Reserve should 
continue with its stimulus program, or “taper” its efforts. 
While the economy continued to add jobs, the rate of 
growth was slow, and the proportion of Americans 
either working or looking for work fell to its lowest level 
since 1978. There were a few bright spots in the report, 
including a slight increase in the number of hours 
worked and a 5-cent gain in hourly wages for private 
sector workers. Over the previous year, average hourly 
earnings have risen by 52 cents, or 2.2 percent, before 
adjusting for inﬂation of about 1.6 percent.
“If you had a more optimistic view of the economy, 
which I think the Fed does, this should give you 
some pause,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief United 
States economist at MFR economic consultants. “It’s 
been a real struggle here in the labor market.”
 
Still, some economists said they believed 
that Fed governors would ﬁnd enough bright 
spots in the report to justify scaling back their 
monthly purchases of long-term Treasury bonds 
and mortgage-backed securities—measures that 
help push down long-term interest rates—after 
their next meeting. “There’s just barely enough in 
that report and other forward-looking indicators 
to give Fed governors the conﬁdence they need 
to taper,” said Ian Shepardson, chief economist 
at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Despite the lukewarm jobs growth, the jobless rate 
edged closer to the 7 percent level that the Fed had 
identiﬁed as their target for ending asset purchases. 
Some economists suggested that the Fed governors 
might taper bond purchases more slowly, and combine 
this with other measures aimed to maintain employ-
ment growth, such as continuing to hold short-term 
interest rates near zero for an extended period.

CHAPTER 28 — AGGREGATE SUPPLY, AGGREGATE DEMAND, AND INFLATION
Discussion Questions
1. Under what circumstances can aggregate demand be increased without leading to problems 
with inﬂation? Under what circumstances is an increase in aggregate demand likely to 
cause inﬂation?
2. Stagﬂation—a combination of unemployment and inﬂation—seems to be the worst of 
both worlds. What policies were used to respond to the stagﬂation of the late 1970s and 
early 1980s? What factors led to improving economic conditions in the later 1980s and 
the 1990s?
4. COMPETING THEORIES
The AS/AD model has given us insight into some of the major macroeconomic ﬂuctuations of 
the past several decades. But there remains much room for controversy. Was it necessary to 
enact expansionary ﬁscal policy in order to get the economy out of the 2007–8 recession? Was 
it a good idea for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to near zero in 2007–13 to try to 
promote recovery? Economists differ greatly in their views on these issues, and their theoretical 
backgrounds tend to inform their answers to these and other more contemporary questions.
Here we review the ways in which classical and Keynesian economics address these 
questions. Additional theories—some of which take positions between these two poles—are 
reviewed in the Appendix to this chapter.
4.1 CLASSICAL MACROECONOMICS
As discussed in previous chapters, economists with ties to the classical school tend to believe 
in the self-adjusting properties of a free-market system. In the classical view, labor markets 
clear at an equilibrium wage (Chapter 23). Classical markets for loanable funds cause sav-
ings and investment to be equal at an equilibrium interest rate (Chapter 24). In theory, then, 
a smoothly functioning economy should never be at anything other than full employment.
In terms of the AS/AD model, the classical theory implies an AS curve that is quite different 
from the one that we have been working with, as shown in Figure 28.17. In such an economy, 
output would always be at its full-employment level (now shown as a distinct value, rather 
than a range). The AD level would determine the inﬂation rate, but nothing else.
The rationale for this vertical AS curve is as follows. At the full-employment level, 
people are making their optimizing choices about how much to work, consume, and so on. 
If for some reason the economy were to produce at less than the full-employment level, 
the unemployed workers would bid down wages and full employment would be restored. 
If the economy were to produce at more than its full-employment level, wages would be

automatically.

bid up, and employment would drop back to its full-employment level. Such processes are 
assumed to work so quickly and smoothly that the economy will return to full employment 
fairly quickly.
What, according to the classical model, is the effect of aggregate demand management 
policies? As we can see in Figure 28.17, expansionary ﬁscal or monetary policy can have no 
effect on the output level. Classical economists believe that increased government spending 
just “crowds out” private spending (as discussed in Chapter 25), in particular spending on 
investment. Because the economy is already at its full-employment level of Y*, more spending 
by government just means less spending by consumers and businesses.
Similarly, in the classical view, monetary expansions are believed to lead only to increased 
inﬂation. As we saw in our discussion of classical monetary theory in Chapter 27, the classical 
prescription is that the central bank should just choose a certain growth rate of the money 
supply or level of the interest rate to support and stick to it, without concerning itself about 
unemployment and output. Classical theory tends to support politically conservative policies 
that emphasize small government and strict rules on monetary policy. Classical economists 
would tend to say that the ﬁscal expansionary policies put into place in 2009 were unnecessary 
for the purposes of macroeconomic stabilization but that the Volcker contraction of the early 
1980s was a good idea.
4.2 KEYNESIAN MACROECONOMICS
The original Keynesian belief was that market economies are inherently unstable. The Keynes-
ian notion of the inﬂuence of “animal spirits” on investment refers to the tendency of private 
decision-makers to become overly optimistic and create booms in investing and production. 
And the higher the boom, the deeper the crash. Firms that have overextended and overpro-
duced during an upswing need time to regroup, sell off inventory, and so on, before they 
will be ready to go on the upswing again. Households that have overextended and overspent 
during a boom also need to regroup and perhaps pay down debt, before they will be willing 
to restart an optimistic spending bandwagon.
This view of perpetual business cycles is a fundamentally different worldview from 
those that presume an automatic “settling down” of the economy at a full-employment 
equilibrium. Keynes did not believe that macroeconomic phenomena could be explained by 
assuming rational, optimizing behavior by individuals and then extrapolating from models 
of individual markets to the macroeconomy. Modern Keynesians argue that this inherent 
tendency toward market instability requires active government intervention and that the 
alternative—simply waiting for the market to correct itself—risks major economic damage 
and long-term depression.
It is important to note that Keynesians do not only favor expansionary fiscal and 
monetary policies. They believe that they are needed in case of recession, but under different 
circumstances, such as the inﬂationary periods that we have discussed, contractionary policy 
may be called for. Keynesians thus ﬁnd the kind of analysis that we have presented in this 
chapter very useful for determining what type of policy is needed in different circumstances. 
The traditional model of Keynesian business cycles must be modiﬁed to deal with new events 
such as supply shocks (discussed above) and sustainability issues (discussed in Chapter 
33). These require models that are ﬂexible enough to address new issues as they arise. Such 
models are best built on the understanding that economies are subject to a variety of forces, 
many of which can swamp the market equilibrium logic that would be expected to lead to a 
classical situation of full-employment equilibrium.
In the modern era, the debate between economists who favor classical approaches 
and those who argue for Keynesian analysis has continued. The Great Recession and its 
aftermath have provided new fodder for these arguments about economic analysis and 
policy (see Box 28.3).

642 
CHAPTER 28 — AGGREGATE SUPPLY, AGGREGATE DEMAND, AND INFLATION
BOX 28.3 CLASSICAL AND KEYNESIAN VIEWS OF RECESSION AND RECOVERY
The Great Recession of 2007–9 and its aftermath—
a very slow recovery that was still in progress as 
of 2014, ﬁve years after the formal end of the 
recession—have provided a new arena for the long-
running debate between classical and Keynesian 
views in economics.
Two major responses to the recession—the 
U.S. ﬁscal stimulus program of 2009–11 and the 
Federal Reserve policies of ultralow interest rates 
and “quantitative easing” to expand the money 
supply—are right out of the Keynesian playbook 
of expansionary ﬁscal and monetary policy. At the 
same time, policies of “austerity” (drastic spending 
cutbacks) implemented in many European countries 
reﬂect the classical perspective that excessive gov-
ernment spending is a problem, not a solution, and 
that budget deﬁcits need to be eliminated. Thus the 
discussion has focused on the relative success or 
failure of these policies.
Keynesians argued that the stimulative ﬁscal and 
monetary policies implemented in the United States 
prevented a much worse recession, saving or creat-
ing millions of jobs (Blinder and Zandi, 2010) and 
putting the country on a (slow) road to recovery. 
They believed that the results, in terms of employ-
ment creation, were limited mainly because the 
stimulus was not large enough and that the stimulus 
was essentially reversed after the 2010 Republican 
congressional victories. Although Keynesians gen-
erally supported the Fed’s expansionary policies, 
they suggested that they are subject to the “liquidity 
trap” identiﬁed by Keynes—the tendency of banks 
and individuals to hold on to money in bad times, 
limiting the effectiveness of expansionary monetary 
policy (Krugman, 2011, 2013). Meanwhile, they 
pointed to the deepening recession in Europe as 
proof that the “classical medicine” of budget austerity 
was counterproductive.
Classical economists, by contrast, saw the gov-
ernment efforts at economic stimulation as a failure, 
one that would saddle the country with an increased 
burden of debt. According to Allan Meltzer (2011), 
U.S. ﬁscal and monetary policies are mainly 
directed at getting a near-term result. The es-
timated cost of new jobs in President Obama’s 
jobs bill is at least $200,000 per job . . . once 
the subsidies end, the jobs disappear—but the 
bonds that ﬁnanced them remain and must be 
serviced. Perhaps that’s why estimates of the 
additional spending generated by Keynesian 
stimulus—the “multiplier effect” have failed to 
live up to expectations.
As of 2014, the U.S. economy was perform-
ing much better than most European economies, 
which were still well below their production levels 
of 2007, with unemployment rates reaching Great 
Depression levels of over 25 percent. Predictions 
by classical economists of the beneﬁcial effects of 
budget austerity in Europe, and of accelerating 
inﬂation in the United States, had not come true 
(Morris, 2013). U.S. budget deﬁcits were falling 
(in June 2013, the federal government even brieﬂy 
ran a surplus)—something that Keynesians attrib-
uted to the success of their policies, while classical 
economists pointed to budget cuts imposed as part 
of the “debt ceiling” deal of 2011 (discussed further 
in Chapter 31). 
Does this situation amount to a vindication of 
Keynesian policies or merely a temporary and par-
tial success that will look different in a long-term 
perspective? Will the United States end up crippled 
by debt, or will economic recovery make debt man-
agement much easier? Will European economies 
rebound based on conservative budget policies, or 
will these countries eventually turn to more expan-
sionary approaches? The economic argument will 
continue, and new policies and new data will be grist 
to the mill of continued economic debate.

APPENDIX: MORE SCHOOLS OF MACROECONOMICS
A1. NEW CLASSICAL ECONOMICS 
In the simple classical model presented above, the economy is nearly always at or close to full 
employment. Faced with the empirical evidence of widely ﬂuctuating output and unemploy-
ment rates, some modern-day economists—often called “new classical” economists—have 
come up with a number of theories that seek to explain how classical theory can be consistent 
with the observed ﬂuctuations.
At one extreme, some economists have sought to redeﬁne full employment to mean pretty 
much whatever level of employment currently exists. Assuming that people make optimizing 
choices and markets work smoothly, one might observe employment levels rise and fall if, 
for example, technological capacities or people’s preferences for work versus leisure shift 
over time. Some new classical economists, who have worked on what is called real business 
cycle theory, have suggested that “intertemporal substitution of leisure” (i.e., essentially, 
real business cycle 
theory: the theory 
that changes in em-
ployment levels are 
caused by changes in 
technological capaci-
ties or people’s pref-
erences concerning 
work

 
APPENDIX: MORE SCHOOLS OF MACROECONOMICS

people voluntarily taking more time off during recessions) could be at the root of the lower 
employment levels observed during some historical periods.
Economists of the rational expectations school (which originated during the 1970s and 
1980s) proposed a theory as to why monetary policy only affects the inﬂation rate and not 
output. The basic idea is that people have perfect foresight (i.e., they are perfectly rational), so 
their decisions already factor in the effects of predictable Fed policy, rendering it ineffective. 
This model can be explained by using the AS/AD model with a classical-type vertical AS 
(as shown in Figure 28.17). This vertical AS is interpreted to be the real supply curve for 
the economy, while in the short term the ordinary, curved AS reﬂects people’s inﬂationary 
expectations.
Figure 28.18 shows the effects of an expansionary monetary policy in this classical world. 
Starting at E0, the Fed acts to shift the AD curve to the right by expanding the money supply, 
from AD0 to AD1. Economists of the rational expectations school predict that actors in the 
private economy will anticipate this expansionary move by the Fed and interpret it to mean 
that higher inﬂation is likely. As a result, they immediately raise their inﬂationary expectations. 
This rise in expected inﬂation, shown by the upward shift of the standard AS curve from AS0 
to AS1, cancels out the expansionary effects of the policy. Output will not change, and the 
economy stays on the classical AS curve—but at a higher level of inﬂation. Possibly a very 
unexpected move by the Fed might have a temporary effect on output, but as soon as people 
understand what policies the Fed is carrying out, the policies will become ineffective due to 
changes in expectations.
Other new classical economists accept that unemployment is real and very painful to those 
whom it affects. However, they see aggregate demand policies as useless for addressing 
it. Rather, they claim that unemployment is caused by imperfections in labor markets (the 
“classical unemployment” described in Chapter 23). To reduce unemployment, new classical 
economists prescribe getting rid of government regulations (such as rigorous safety standards 
or minimum wages) that limit how ﬁrms can do business, restricting union activity, or cutting 
back on government social welfare policies that make it attractive (according to the new 
classical economists) to stay out of work. Market pressures, they believe, will be enough on 
their own to support full employment—if given free rein.

“New Classical” economists 
suggest that an expansionary 
move by the Fed, shifting the 
AD curve to the right, will be 
accompanied by an increase 
in inﬂationary expectations, 
shifting the AS curve up. 
The net effect, at E1, is an 
increase in inﬂation with no 
change in equilibrium output.

CHAPTER 28 — AGGREGATE SUPPLY, AGGREGATE DEMAND, AND INFLATION
A2. THE NEOCLASSICAL SYNTHESIS AND NEW KEYNESIAN MACROECONOMICS
Somewhere in the middle ground is what has been called the “classical-Keynesian synthesis” 
or neoclassical synthesis. (It is a bit confusing that the terms “neoclassical” and “new classi-
cal” sound so similar, but they represent two different approaches). In this way of looking at 
the world, Keynesian theory, which allows for output to vary from its full-employment level, 
is considered a reasonably good description of how things work in the short and medium run. 
However, this view holds that, for the reasons set out in the classical model, the economy 
will tend to return to full employment in the long run.
You may have noticed that in the exposition of the AS/AD model above, we talked about 
the short run and the medium run, but did not mention the long run. This is because in more 
decidedly Keynesian thought (to be discussed below), the economy is really a succession 
of short and medium runs. Shocks to the economy are so frequent and so pronounced, and 
price and wage adjustments (especially downward ones) so slow, that the economy never 
has a chance to “settle down” at a long-run equilibrium.
In the neoclassical synthesis, however, it is assumed that the economy, if left to its 
own devices for long enough, would settle back at full employment, due to the (eventual) 
success of classical wage and price adjustments. Models built on this basis would use an 
analysis much like that presented in the AS/AD model used in the body of this chapter but 
add a vertical AS curve such as that shown in Figures 28.17 and 28.18, labeling it “long-run 
aggregate supply.”
To the extent that neoclassical economists and some Keynesians agree on this model, 
then, debates come down to a question of how long it takes to get to the long run. More 
classically-oriented economists tend to emphasize that excessive unemployment is merely 
temporary and believe that (at least if government stays out of the way) the long run comes 
fairly soon. Some Keynesian economists, often called New Keynesians, have accepted the 
challenge from classical economists to present all their analysis in terms of the workings 
of markets, individual optimizing behavior, and possible “imperfections” in markets. They 
have built up theories (such as efﬁciency wage theory, discussed in Chapter 23) to explain 
why wages do not just fall during a recession to create a full employment equilibrium. 
They tend to work within the neoclassical synthesis, but claim that due to institutional 
factors the long run may be a long, long way away. They believe that government action, 
then, is often justiﬁed.
A3. POST-KEYNESIAN MACROECONOMICS
Post-Keynesian economists base their analyses on some of the more radical implications 
of the original Keynesian theory.* They believe that modern economies are basically 
unstable and do not accept the idea of a long-run equilibrium at full employment. They 
stress the view that history matters in determining where the economy is today. They also 
believe that the future, although it will depend to some extent on the actions we take now, 
is fundamentally unpredictable, due to the often surprising nature of economic evolution 
and world events.
For example, one post-Keynesian argument is that high unemployment, like high inﬂation, 
may also be “toothpaste” that is very difﬁcult to get back into the tube. When people are 
unemployed for a long time, they tend to lose work skills, lose work habits, and may get 
demoralized. If this is true, then government action to counter unemployment is even more 
needed, since high unemployment now may tend to lead to high unemployment in the future, 
even if the demand situation recovers. (Economists refer to this idea that future levels of

bination of classi-
cal and Keynesian 
perspectives 
*Again, the similarity between the terms “New Keynesian” and “post-Keynesian” can be confusing, but there is a 
difference in the theoretical perspectives, as noted.

macroeconomics: 
a school of thought 
that bases its analy-
sis on micro-level 
market behavior, but 
which justiﬁes activ-
ist macroeconomic 
policies by assuming 
that markets have

can create or prolong 
recessions

macroeconomics: 
a school of thought 
that stresses the im-
portance of history 
and uncertainty in

economic outcomes

unemployment—or any other economic variable—may depend on past levels as “hysteresis” 
or “path dependence.”)
In addition, long periods of high unemployment mean a permanent loss of output and 
investment—making the economy weaker in the long term. For these reasons, it is essential 
for the government to act to maintain full, or close-to-full, employment. Post-Keynesian 
economists would say that the ﬁscal expansionary policies put into place in 2009 were a 
good idea, because they do not believe that an economy left to its own devices will naturally 
return to full employment, even “in the long run.”

29 The Global Economy and Policy
Do you know how many Philippine pesos, South African rand, or Peruvian nuevos soles 
you can get for a U.S. dollar? No? If you traveled to one of these countries, you might be 
surprised to ﬁnd out that the average person on the street in any city can often easily quote 
you the going exchange rate between their currency and the U.S. dollar. People in smaller 
economies have always been very vulnerable to international economic conditions and hence 
make it a habit to stay current on the rate.
In contrast, because the United States has a large economy and its currency currently 
dominates the world ﬁnancial system, people living in the United States have historically 
tended to be relatively unaware of global economic conditions. In recent years, that has 
changed. Now international trade and global borrowing and lending have signiﬁcantly 
increased in importance, for the United States as well as globally.
The ﬁnancial crisis of 2007–8 led to a world economic downturn, drawing attention to the 
degree to which economies are interdependent. Recovery in the United States, for example, 
was slowed by bad economic conditions in Europe. Much attention has also focused on 
the large U.S.–China trade imbalance, with efforts by the United States to get the Chinese 
government to allow an increase in the value of their currency in order to improve the U.S. 
balance of trade with China. There is concern that the large U.S. trade deﬁcit means that the 
United States owes too much money to China and that this will cause economic problems in 
the future. How can we evaluate such international economic issues?
1. MACROECONOMICS IN A GLOBAL CONTEXT
In earlier chapters, our macro model has generally limited its scope to the three main economic 
sectors: households, businesses, and the government. We have seen how each of these—
through consumption, investment, and government spending—contributes to aggregate 
demand. It is now time to open things up a bit and introduce the foreign sector. Doing so will 
provide insight into how national economies are linked together and the opportunities and 
problems that this linkage creates.
1.1 GLOBAL CONNECTIONS
An economy with no international linkages is called a closed economy, while one that par-
ticipates in the global economy is called an open economy. The economic linkages among 
countries can take many forms, including:
s  INTERNATIONAL trade ﬂows, when goods and services that have been created in one country 
are sold in another

 
MACROECONOMICS IN A GLOBAL CONTEX 
649
s  INTERNATIONAL income ﬂows, when capital incomes (proﬁt, rent, and interest), labor incomes, 
or transfer payments go from one country to another
s  INTERNATIONAL transactions in assets, when people trade in ﬁnancial assets such as foreign bonds 
or currencies, or make investments in real foreign assets such as businesses or real estate
s  INTERNATIONAL ﬂows of people, as people migrate from one country to another, either tempo-
rarily or permanently
s  INTERNATIONAL mOWS OF technological knowledge, cultural products, and other intangibles, 
which can profoundly inﬂuence patterns of production and consumption, as well as tastes 
and lifestyles
s  INTERNATIONAL SHARING OF AND IMPACT ON common environmental resources, such as deep-sea 
ﬁsheries and global climate patterns
s  THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT CREATED BY INTERNATIONAL MONETARY INSTITUTIONS INTERNATIONAL trade agreements, international military and aid arrangements, and banks, corporations, and 
other private entities that operate at an international scale.
Any one of these forms of interaction may be crucially important for understanding 
the macroeconomic experience of speciﬁc countries at speciﬁc times. Mexico and Turkey, 
for example, receive signiﬁcant ﬂows of income from remittances sent home by citizens 
working abroad. Biological hazards, such as diseases or insects that threaten human health 
or agriculture, can travel along with people and goods. Trade in “intellectual property,” such 
as technology patents and music copyrights, is currently an issue of hot dispute.
Thoroughly describing the international economic system is too large a project for one 
textbook. This chapter looks at how trade in goods and services affects aggregate demand as 
well as how it corresponds to a country’s international ﬁnances. We look at how trade and 
ﬁnance inﬂuence the exchange rate of a country’s currency. As we will see, these international 
issues can all affect living standards and macroeconomic stabilization. Later chapters look 
in more detail at issues of growth and sustainability.
1.2 MAJOR POLICY TOOLS
We say that a country’s economy is “open” if it exports and imports large amounts relative 
to its GDP and “closed” if it exports and imports relatively small amounts. Governments 
can try to control the degree of openness or “closedness” of their economy through a variety 
of policy tools. The most drastic way to “close” an economy is to institute a trade ban. In 
theory a country could prohibit all international trade, but this hardly ever happens. More 
often countries make trade in selected goods illegal or ban trade with particular countries 
(such as the U.S. ban on trade with Cuba). Inspections at the country’s borders or at hubs of 
transportation, such as airports, are used to enforce a ban.
A less drastic measure is a trade quota, which does not eliminate trade but sets limits on the 
quantity of a good that can be imported or exported. A quota on imports, by restricting supply, 
generally raises the price that can be charged for the good within the country. An import quota helps 
domestic producers by shielding them from lower-price competition. It hurts foreign producers 
because it limits what they can sell in the domestic market. Some foreign producers may, however, 
get some beneﬁt in the form of additional revenues from the artiﬁcially higher price.
A third sort of policy—which has been used often throughout history—is a tariff (or 
“duty”). Tariffs are taxes charged on imports or exports.* Tariffs, like quotas, can reduce 
trade because they make internationally traded goods more costly to buy or sell. Like quotas, 
import tariffs beneﬁt domestic producers while raising prices to consumers. Unlike quotas, 
however, import tariffs provide monetary beneﬁt to the government that imposes them. Also 
trade ban: a law 
preventing the import 
or export of goods or 
services
trade quota: a 
restriction on the 
quantity of a good 
that can be imported 
or exported
tariffs: taxes on im-
ports or exports
*Often misunderstood, tariffs are taxes paid to the government of the importing country by the importing company or 
entity, not by the exporting country.

650 
CHAPTER 29 — THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND POLICY
unlike quotas, tariffs do not give foreign producers an opportunity to increase prices—in fact, 
foreign producers may be forced to lower prices in order to remain competitive with domestic 
producers that do not pay the tariff. 
There are also various non-tariff barriers to trade that can be imposed. These include 
the use of speciﬁc licensing requirements, standards, or regulations on imported goods, which 
permit trade but may limit its extent.
The last important major category of trade-related policies—trade-related subsidies—may 
be used to either expand or contract trade. Export subsidies, paid to domestic producers 
when they market their products abroad, are motivated by a desire to increase the ﬂow of 
exports. Countries can also use subsidies to promote a policy of import substitution, by 
giving domestic producers extra payments to encourage the production of certain goods for 
domestic markets, with a goal of reducing the quantity of imports.
Government policies can also inﬂuence international capital transactions (ﬁnancial ﬂows). 
Central banks often participate in foreign exchange markets with policy goals in mind, buying 
or selling foreign currencies, as discussed in detail later in this chapter. Countries sometimes 
institute capital controls, which are restrictions or taxes on transactions in ﬁnancial assets such 
as currency, stocks, or bonds, or on foreign ownership of domestic assets such as businesses 
or land. Restrictions on how much currency a person can take out of a country, for example, 
are one type of capital control. Such controls are usually instituted to try to prevent sudden, 
destabilizing swings in the movement of ﬁnancial capital.
Countries may also regulate the form that foreign business investments can take. Some 
have required that all business ventures be at least partially owned by domestic investors. 
Some have required that all traded manufactured goods include at least a given percentage 
of parts produced by domestic companies. Countries that have adopted such domestic 
content requirements include China, Indonesia, Mexico, and the Philippines. Sometimes 
such controls are related to a development strategy, while in other cases they simply reﬂect 
a desire to avoid excessive foreign control of domestic economic affairs.
Some trade policies are enacted to try to attract foreign investment, for example, by giving 
foreign companies tax breaks and other incentives. A popular form of this is the foreign trade 
zone, a designated area of the country within which many tax, tariff, and perhaps regulatory 
policies that usually apply to manufacturing are suspended. By attracting foreign investment, 
countries may hope to increase employment or gain access to important technologies. A well-
known example is the maquiladora policy in Mexico under which manufacturing plants can 
import components and produce goods for export free of tariffs.
Migration controls are another important aspect of international policy. Countries 
generally impose restrictions on people who visit or move to their territory, and a few also 
impose tight regulations on people when leaving the country. Although beliefs about race, 
national culture, and population size are often the most obvious concerns behind the shaping 
of these controls, economic interests also play a role. For example, policies may be affected 
by concerns about the skill composition of the domestic labor force or the desire to receive 
remittances from out-migrants.
Countries do not necessarily choose sets of policies that consistently lead toward openness 
or consistently toward “closedness.” Often there is a mix—policies are chosen for a wide 
variety of reasons and can even be at cross purposes. Nor do countries choose their policies 
in a vacuum. Policymakers need to take into account reactions to their policies by foreign 
governments. Increasingly, they also need to pay attention to whether their policies are in 
compliance with international agreements.
1.3 PATTERNS OF TRADE AND FINANCE
International trade has grown immensely in recent years. Sometimes the sum of a country’s 
imports and exports of goods and services, expressed as a percentage of GDP, is used as a 
non-tariff barri-
ers to trade: use 
of licensing or other 
requirements to limit 
the volume of trade
trade-related sub-
sidies: payments giv-
en by governments to 
producers to encour-
age more production, 
either for export or 
as a substitute for 
imports
import substitu-
tion: the policy of 
subsidizing domestic 
producers to make 
products that can be 
used in place of im-
ported goods
capital controls: the 
regulation or taxa-
tion of international 
transactions involving 
assets
domestic content 
requirement: laws 
requiring traded 
goods to contain a 
certain percentage of 
goods produced by 
domestic companies
foreign trade zone: 
a designated area of a 
country within which 
foreign-owned manu-
facturers can operate 
free of many taxes, 
tariffs, and regulations
migration controls: 
restrictions on the 
ﬂow of people into 
and out of a country

measure of an economy’s “openness.” Growth in trade according to this measure is shown 
for 1960–2011 in Figure 29.1. Although trade still remains relatively less important in 
the United States than in many other countries, its importance has been increasing here 
as well.
Why has trade grown over time? The ﬁrst reason is improvements in transportation 
technology. The costs and time lags involved in shipping products by air, for example, are 
far less now than in 1950. Fruit from Chile and ﬂowers from Colombia are now ﬂown into 
the United States every day—and are still fresh when they arrive. The second reason for 
increased trade is advances in telecommunications. The infrastructure for phone, fax, and 
electronic communication has improved dramatically. Better telecommunications make it 
possible for many kinds of services, such as customer support and many technical functions, 
to be directly imported from, for example, call centers in India. The third reason is that many 
governments have, over time, lowered their tariffs and other barriers to trade. The World 
Trade Organization, with 149 member countries, conducts negotiations aimed at lowering 
trade barriers, and mediates trade disputes between countries.
Figure 29.2 shows the volume of exports that the United States sells to the top eight buyers 
of its goods and the volume of its imports that come from the top eight countries that sell to 
it. Historically, the closest neighbors of the United States—Canada and Mexico—have been 
very important trading partners. Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan, not surprisingly, 
have also been leading trade partners. The growing importance of South Korea and Brazil 
is a more recent phenomenon that can be attributed mostly to their rapid development. The 
presence of Saudi Arabia among the top eight sellers to the U.S. (as of 2012) was due almost 
entirely to petroleum imports. 
The biggest development in recent years has been the emergence of China as a major 
source of U.S. imports. Until about 1980, U.S. trade with China was negligible. Since then, 
U.S. importation of Chinese products—especially electronics (including computers and 
televisions) as well as clothing, toys, and furniture—has boomed. Although China buys some 
U.S. goods, including agricultural products and aircraft, the value of U.S. imports from China 
far exceeds the value of U.S. exports to China.

Note: Since this measure includes both imports and exports, it does not mean that over 50% of all produced goods and 
services in the world are traded—it counts the same goods both as exports from one country and imports to another.
The worldwide volume of trade, 
including both imports and exports, 
expressed as a percentage of global 
GDP, has been increasing over the 
past four decades. While the United 
States remains less “open” than many 
economies, trade has become more 
important here as well.

CHAPTER 29 — THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND POLICY
The volume of global ﬁnancial transactions has also exploded in recent years. For example, 
foreign exchange ﬂows in 2013 averaged about $5.3 trillion—per day! This daily ﬁgure 
equates to more than $700 per person on earth. The volume in mid-2013 was almost four 
times the amount in 2001.1

2. THE TRADE BALANCE: COMPLETING THE PICTURE
How does trade affect the economy? It is certainly an important factor. Consumers who go 
to any U.S. shopping mall cannot help but notice that a large proportion of the goods are 
imported. Many U.S. jobs are in industries that depend on export markets. We often hear 
concern expressed about the trade deﬁcit. In 2012, the U.S. trade deﬁcit equaled about 3.4 
percent of GDP. This means that people in the United States were spending much more on 
foreign goods and services (importing) than the United States was selling to foreign buyers 
(exporting). In other words, U.S. net exports (exports minus imports) were negative. In other 
countries, such as China, the situation is reversed—they are large net exporters. Were it not 
for the United States, however, China also would be a sizable net importer, because its total 
trade surplus in 2012 was less than one-third of its surplus just with the United States (known 
as a bilateral surplus, equal to $315 billion in 2012).2

THE TRADE BALANCE: COMPLETING THE PICTURE 
653
2.1 THE CIRCULAR FLOW REVISITED
Our trade balance is related to the circular ﬂow discussed in earlier chapters. In this section, 
we look at the impact of our exports and imports on aggregate demand and GDP. We can 
introduce trade into our macroeconomic model by adding net exports (NX) into the equation 
for aggregate demand:
AD = C + II + G + NX
As discussed in Chapter 20, net exports (NX) equals exports minus imports (X – IM). 
Exports, like intended investment (II) and government spending (G), represent a positive 
contribution to aggregate demand. More exports means more demand for domestically 
produced goods and services. Imports, however, are a negative in the equation. That means 
they represent a leakage from U.S. aggregate demand—a portion of income that is not spent 
on U.S. goods and services.
Negative net exports (when X < IM) therefore represent a net subtraction from demand for 
the output of U.S. businesses and a net leakage from the circular ﬂow. A decrease in exports 
(or increase in imports) tends to reduce the circular ﬂow of domestic income, spending, and 
output—unless injections such as intended investment and government spending counteract 
this contraction. An increase in net exports, on the other hand, encourages a rise in GDP and 
employment. For example, an increase in U.S. purchases of foreign cars and a decrease in 
purchases of domestic cars would lower aggregate demand in the United States (and raise 
it in other car-exporting countries). But an increase in foreign sales by the U.S. computer 
software industry would raise U.S. aggregate demand and employment.
Adding exports and imports completes our basic macroeconomic model. We started 
with a very simple economy, with just consumers and businesses, then added government 
spending, taxes, and the international sector. We now have a more complex model, with three 
leakages (saving, taxes, and imports) and three injections (intended investment, government 
spending, and exports). Imports are considered leakages because, like saving and taxes, they 
draw funds away from the domestic income-spending ﬂow. Exports, like intended investment 
and government spending, add funds to the ﬂow. We can modify our original circular ﬂow 
diagram to show all these ﬂows (Figure 29.3).

Leakages from the circular 
ﬂow include taxes, saving, 
and imports. Injections include 
intended investment, government 
spending, and exports. The level 
of macroeconomic equilibrium will 
depend on the balance of all these 
ﬂows as well as consumption levels.

654 
CHAPTER 29 — THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND POLICY
Macroeconomic equilibrium involves balancing the three types of leakage with the three 
types of injection. A change in any one will alter the equilibrium level of output. The model 
that we have constructed allows us to understand how all these factors are related to levels 
of income and employment. We put it to use shortly to explain how saving and investment 
are linked to the global economy. But ﬁrst we look at the multiplier effects of exports and 
imports.
2.2 EFFECTS ON THE MULTIPLIER
The multiplier effect for an increase in exports is essentially the same as that for an increase in 
II or G. Using the same model as in Chapter 25 (with a multiplier of 5), an increase of exports 
of 40, for example, leads to an increase of 200 in economic equilibrium.
ΔY = mult ΔX
We can use exactly the same logic for a lump-sum increase in imports—the effect on 
equilibrium income just goes in the opposite direction. An increase in imports of 40 would 
lower the equilibrium level of income by 200, and a decrease in imports of 40 would raise 
the equilibrium by 200.
The multiplier logic becomes a little more complicated, however, when we consider how 
import levels are determined. In general, when people receive more income in an economy 
that is open to trade, they spend some of it on domestically produced goods and some on 
imports. The proportion spent on imports, as we noted above, is a “leakage” that does not add 
to domestic demand. If we want to account for this fully, we need to modify our multiplier 
logic. The effect is similar to that of a proportional tax on consumption: It tends to ﬂatten 
the aggregate demand curve, for the same reason. When people receive additional income, a 
portion of it “leaks” away into imports. This portion does not stimulate the domestic economy, 
so multiplier effects are smaller and the economic response a bit less dynamic. Multipliers 
in the neighborhood of four or ﬁve seldom are observed in the real world, because mpc is 
affected not only by our marginal propensity to save but also by the rate of taxation and our 
marginal propensity to import. For a full treatment of this effect, see Appendix A1.
In an open economy, a portion of any aggregate demand increase goes to stimulate someone 
else’s economy via imports. Thus U.S. consumers who buy imported goods from Canada are 
creating jobs and income in Canada, not the United States. Does this mean that imports are 
bad for the United States? Not necessarily. Two other factors are important to consider.
The ﬁrst is that U.S. consumers and U.S. industry beneﬁt from cheaper imported goods 
and services, raw materials, and other industrial inputs. The second is that at least some of the 
money spent on imports is likely to return to the United States as demand for exports, which, 
as we have seen, stimulates an increase in GDP and employment. More generally, the U.S. 
economy, and overall quality of life in the United States, improves when other countries have 
healthier economies and diminishes when other countries are suffering economic setbacks. 
A prosperous world is a happier world for all. Thus, in the largest sense, if China or Canada 
beneﬁts from exporting to the United States, to some extent this beneﬁts everyone. Problems 
can arise, however, when trade deﬁcits (negative net exports) are too large for too long. We 
explore this issue further later in the chapter.
2.3 BALANCE BETWEEN SAVINGS, INVESTMENT, AND NET BORROWING
We can use our macro model to demonstrate that saving and investment are related not only 
to net exports but also to foreign lending and borrowing. Understanding this link is critical 
to making sense of much that happens in the global economy.
We start with the usual equation breaking down GDP into consumption, investment, and 
government spending. In addition, we follow the convention—seen earlier in Chapter 20—of 

 
THE TRADE BALANCE: COMPLETING THE PICTURE 
655
breaking government spending down into “government consumption” and “government 
investment,” which results in the following equation:
 
GDP = Personal consumption + private investment + government consumption + 
 
 
government investment + net exports
or
GDP = C + II + GC + GI + NX
Rearranging, we obtain
GDP – C – GC = II + GI + NX
Because saving is what is left over from income after spending on consumption (the left-
hand side of the equation above), if we combine private and government savings into a single 
term Stotal and private and government investment into a single term Itotal, we get:
Stotal = Itotal + NX
or:
Total saving = Total investment + net exports
Thinking about these quantities in terms of valuable goods and services, this important 
identity says, intuitively, that goods and services that are produced in our domestic economy 
in excess of what we currently use for consumption can become investment goods—additions 
to our stock of manufactured assets (including replacement of depreciated assets)—or can be 
sold to foreign countries (in excess of the value of what we import from them).
Another way of understanding this is in terms of macroeconomic equilibrium. If, say, total 
domestic saving exceeded investment, a net leakage from the circular ﬂow would occur. In 
order to obtain an equilibrium, this leakage would need to be offset by a trade surplus (an 
excess of exports over imports, creating a net injection). If total investment exceeded saving, 
the opposite would result—that is, there would be a trade deﬁcit. In this case, the net leakage 
from an excess of imports over exports would balance the net injection caused by investment 
exceeding savings.
Yet another way to look at the relation of saving, investment, and trade is to think of 
how the various sectors ﬁnance their purchases of goods and services. In a contemporary 
economy, goods are rarely traded for goods; rather, money is used as a means of exchange. 
So, corresponding to any ﬂow of goods and services transacted in exchanges, there is an 
equivalent ﬂow of monetary funds.
Consider, for a moment, a closed economy. In this case the last equation would reduce 
to:
Stotal = Itotal
This says that, in a closed economy, the total amount that is not spent on consumption 
goods is available for spending on investment goods. How does ﬁnancial saving get turned 
into tangible investments?
In the national accounts, it is primarily businesses and the government that are counted 
as investing. They ﬁnance their investment expenditures either from their own savings or by 
borrowing someone else’s savings. Household savings, in the form of income not spent on 

656 
CHAPTER 29 — THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND POLICY
consumption, can be made available for investment by the other sectors—as when the funds 
in a household’s bank deposit are lent to a business or a household buys a government bond. 
The “saving = investment” identity tells us that at an aggregate national level in a closed 
economy, only what the country as a whole saves out of current income can be available to 
ﬁnance investment for the future.
When we consider an open economy, things get more complicated. Now the country as 
a whole can also borrow from, or lend to, the foreign sector, and the relevant identity, as 
noted above, is:
Stotal = Itotal + NX
If net exports are positive, we sell more goods abroad than we buy. How would people 
abroad pay for all our goods, if the value of what we sell to them exceeds the value of what 
they sell to us? They are not earning enough from their sales to pay us! The main way for 
them to ﬁnance their purchases of our goods is by borrowing from us. They would need 
to borrow the amount by which our exports to them exceed our imports from them. So the 
identity can be (approximately) rewritten as:
Stotal = Itotal + net foreign lending
That is, if we had extra savings, above and beyond what is being used for domestic 
investment, we could lend it to foreigners so that they could buy our goods. The equation 
above is only approximate, because foreigners can also get more goods and services from us 
than they sell to us by receiving our goods as gifts, paying for them out of transfer income, 
or selling us their assets, such as land or businesses, in return. We discuss these possibilities 
in greater detail in the next section.
In recent years, however, the United States has tended to have net exports that are 
negative—we tend to buy more from foreign countries than we sell. This means that we need 
to borrow from them. The following identity means exactly the same thing as the last one, 
but is easier to use to represent the recent U.S. situation:
Stotal = Itotal – net foreign borrowing
When we are in a situation of borrowing from abroad, then the amount we are really “putting 
away for the future”—that is, saving—is less than what we would assume if we looked only 
at what we are investing. Although we may be investing domestically, if we are using “net 
foreign borrowing” to obtain investment funds, we are also creating future indebtedness to 
other countries by borrowing from them.
Should we worry that our country has to borrow from foreigners? As in the case of your 
personal ﬁnances, it makes a difference what the purpose of the borrowing is. If the borrowing 
ﬁnanced the purchase of productive new private or government investment goods, then it 
might be a way of actually improving the country’s outlook for the future. As mentioned in 
Chapter 19, for many decades international authorities encouraged poor countries to borrow 
heavily for development projects, using exactly this reasoning.
But if the funds borrowed went largely into investments that did not pay off ﬁnancially or 
if the borrowing only ﬁnanced a high level of consumption, there would be reason to worry. A 
country that borrows a lot may be in trouble when it comes time to pay back its loans. In recent 
years, many poor countries have found themselves unable to pay the interest on the enormous 
foreign debts that they have built up over the years—much less repay the principal. In the case 
of the United States, the country’s creditworthiness has not been seriously questioned, and to 
date paying interest and principal on foreign debt (known as “servicing” the debt) has never 
posed problems. However, as discussed further in Chapter 31, a high level of international 
indebtedness has potential costs over the long term.

Discussion Questions
1. What will be the likely effect of increased imports on U.S. GDP? Do imported goods 
undercut employment in the United States? What other developments in the economy 
might counteract this effect?
2. Savings, imports, and taxes are all considered “leakages” from aggregate demand. Are 
they bad for the economy? Or is there an important function for each? How are their levels 
related to equilibrium GDP, income, and employment?
3. INTERNATIONAL FINANCE
In addition to trade in goods, countries are also linked through exchange of currencies, ﬂows 
of income, and purchases and sales of real and ﬁnancial assets across national borders. As we 
consider how international ﬁnance is related to trade and to domestic macroeconomic poli-
cies, the realization that “everything is linked to everything else” can become overwhelming. 
Most topics that we have discussed earlier in this book—such as supply and demand, interest 
rates, inﬂation, aggregate demand, and the Fed—will come back into play. In order to ease 
into the topic, we focus on relatively simple concepts and models, starting with the difference 
between purchasing power parity and currency exchange rates.
3.1 PURCHASING POWER PARITY
Purchasing power parity (PPP) refers to the notion that, under certain idealized conditions, 
the exchange rate between the currencies of two countries should be such that the purchas-
ing power of currencies is equalized. Consider, for example, the exchange rate between U.S. 
dollars ($) and euros (€). As of mid-2013, $1 was worth about €0.75. Equivalently, we could 
say that one euro was worth $1.33. The two rates are inverses of one another. When we cite 
“the exchange rate” for the dollar in terms of a foreign currency, what we mean is the number 
of units of the foreign currency that you can get in exchange for a dollar.
If currencies could be traded freely against one another, if goods were freely traded and 
totally across countries, and if transportation costs were not important, then there would be 
a strong logic to the theory of purchasing power parity. Suppose that a winter jacket costs 
$200 in New York. If you lived in the United States and changed $200 into euros, the theory 
of PPP says that the number of euros you would receive in exchange for your dollars should 
be exactly enough for you to buy the identical winter jacket in Paris. If, indeed, the jacket 
costs €150 (= $200 × 0.75 euros per dollar) in Paris, PPP holds. If economies really were as 
smoothly integrated as we are assuming in our idealized world, an item (whether a winter 
jacket or an hour of labor services) should cost the same, no matter where you are.
If this were not true, there should be pressures leading toward change. For example, suppose 
that the jacket costs $200 in New York and €150 in Paris, but the exchange rate is higher, at 
€1 : US$1. Why would anyone buy a jacket in New York, if by changing their money into 
euros they could order it from Paris and save $50? For jackets to be sold in both locations—in 
this idealized world—the price in New York would have to be bid down, the price in Paris 
would have to be bid up, or the exchange rate would have to fall.
Of course, in the real world, national economies are not nearly as integrated as this theory 
assumes. Transportation costs do matter; there are many varieties of goods; markets for goods 
and services do not work as quickly, smoothly, and rationally as sometimes assumed; and 
exchange rates are often “managed” (see Section 4.3). Any of these factors can mean that 
converting monetary amounts from one country to another using the prevailing exchange 
rates may be misleading. The fact that the price of a jacket is higher in Paris than in New 
York might, for example, reﬂect a higher general cost of living in Paris.
Sometimes, we see comparisons of international income levels expressed “in PPP terms.” 
Rather than simply using current exchange rates to convert all the various income levels into 
purchasing power 
parity (PPP): the 
theory that exchange 
rates should reﬂect 
differences in pur-
chasing power among

658 
CHAPTER 29 — THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND POLICY
a common currency, PPP adjustments try to take into account the fact that the cost of living 
varies among countries. For example, converting Mexican average per capita income ﬁgure 
from pesos to dollars would probably understate the living standard of the average Mexican. 
Even though the conversion is “correct”—in the sense that there exists a peso–dollar exchange 
rate that can easily be used for such an adjustment—many of the goods and services in Mexico 
are probably much less expensive than in the United States. So the dollar equivalent of what 
the average Mexican earns each year goes much further in Mexico.
The “Big Mac Index” published every year by The Economist is a somewhat lighthearted 
attempt to determine how much exchange rates and the price of goods vary from PPP 
predictions, by comparing the prices (converted into dollars using market exchange rates) of 
a McDonald’s hamburger across various countries. More sophisticated analysis uses a larger 
“basket” of goods to make such comparisons and estimate appropriate PPP adjustments.
3.2 CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES
What makes exchange rates go up and down? Currencies are traded against each other all 
over the world, as people offer to buy and sell. The supply-and-demand model explained in 
Chapter 4 can be applied to foreign exchange markets, once we realize that an exchange rate 
is really just another kind of price.
Figure 29.4 shows an idealized foreign exchange market in which U.S. dollars are traded 
for euros. The quantity of dollars traded is given on the horizontal axis, and the “price” of a 
dollar is given on the vertical axis, in terms of the number of euros it takes to buy a dollar.
In a well-behaved foreign exchange market, domestic residents largely determine the 
supply curve of dollars, by deciding how many dollars they are willing to offer in order 
to buy foreign-produced goods and services and foreign assets. Because foreign-produced 
goods, services, and foreign assets must be paid for in the currency of the country from which 
they will be purchased, dollars must be traded in the foreign exchange market. Professional 
currency traders and banks usually do the actual trading. The more euros that U.S. residents 
can get for their dollars, the cheaper that European items are to them, and the more they will 
want to buy from Europe rather than from domestic producers. Thus, the higher the exchange 
rate, the more dollars they will offer on the market. The supply curve slopes upward.
It is residents of other countries who largely determine the demand curve for dollars. 
They may want to buy goods and services from the United States or to invest in U.S. bonds 
or businesses. To make these purchases, they must acquire dollars. The more euros, or other 
currencies, they have to pay to get a dollar, the more likely they are to go somewhere other

each other on a market, the “price” 
is the exchange rate, that is, 
the number of units of the other 
currency that are required to buy a 
unit of the currency in question.

than the United States for what they want and the lower will be the quantity of dollars that 
they demand. But if the U.S. dollar is relatively cheap in terms of euros, they will want 
to demand more dollars. So the demand curve slopes downward. Market equilibrium is 
established at point E.
When the exchange rate falls, we say that the currency has depreciated. Suppose, for 
example, that a European technology ﬁrm comes out with a new device for listening to music 
that everyone wants to buy. In their desire to obtain euros to buy the good, people in the United 
States will offer more dollars on the foreign exchange market, shifting the supply curve to the 
right. Excess supply will, as in any other market, cause the price to fall, as shown in Figure 
29.5. Commentators may say that the dollar is now “weaker” against the euro. (Conversely, 
of course, the euro is now “stronger” against the dollar.)
But an increase in demand for U.S. products or assets would lead to an appreciation of 
the dollar. For example, if investors became eager to buy U.S. real estate, the demand curve 
for dollars would shift outward and the dollar would appreciate—that is, gain in value. A 
currency may appreciate or depreciate relative to a speciﬁc currency, or it may appreciate or 
depreciate generally—that is, in relation to all or most other currencies.
Which factors are most responsible for the depreciation or appreciation of a country’s 
currency? The ﬁrst potentially important factor is relative prices. If prices in general rose 
more rapidly in the United States than in, say, Japan (meaning that inﬂation is lower in 
Japan), the Japanese would be less interested in purchasing U.S. goods, ceteris paribus, and 
we would be more interested in purchasing theirs. What this means in terms of the foreign 
exchange market is that the United States would supply more dollars (in order to obtain yen 
to make purchases from Japan), and the Japanese would demand fewer dollars to purchase 
our higher-priced goods.
A rightward shift in supply coupled with a leftward shift in demand unambiguously 
lowers the yen “price” of the dollar, meaning that the dollar would depreciate relative to 
the yen (and the yen would appreciate relative to the dollar). Note that, in this example, the 
dollar would not depreciate with respect to all other currencies—it would merely depreciate 
relative to the yen.
The second factor inﬂuencing exchange rates may be a country’s GDP growth rate relative 
to that of its trading partners. If, for example, the United States experienced rapid growth 
in employment and output, it would generally mean that imports (as well as consumption, 
investment, government spending, and exports) also increase relatively rapidly. This would 
lead the United States to demand more foreign currencies (to purchase imports) relative to

CHAPTER 29 — THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND POLICY
the foreign demand for our dollars. Our greater demand for foreign currencies (and supplied 
more dollars to purchase them) would cause the dollar to depreciate.
One might conclude from this discussion that countries that consistently import more than 
they export should have a persistently weak currency. The United States has, in fact, imported 
signiﬁcantly more than it has exported for many years. Yet the value of the dollar not only 
has not collapsed but remains one of the most stable currencies.
How is this possible? Some economists highlight interest rates as a third key factor in 
determining exchange rates. If the interest rate on, say, the six-month U.S. Treasury bill were 
higher than the rate on comparable investments in other countries, the United States might 
attract ﬂows of money from foreign investors seeking to exploit the interest rate differential. 
Because Treasury bills are denominated in dollars, the foreign money would be seeking to 
buy dollars, raising dollar demand. The result would be an appreciation in the value of the 
dollar. As a general rule, then, higher relative interest rates have a tendency to raise demand 
for the domestic currency and hence lead to a currency appreciation.
Yet it would be misleading to attribute dollar stability solely, or possibly even at all, to 
higher interest rates. For example, most countries set interest rates lower in the wake of the 
2007–8 ﬁnancial crisis, and the United States, as we saw in Chapter 27, has been no exception 
to this trend. There is a more general foreign appetite for U.S. assets, such as government 
bonds, that explains the steady and reliable demand for dollars. It is a country’s investment 
attractiveness (or lack thereof) that inﬂuences its currency exchange rate; the prevailing 
interest rate is merely one variable in what makes the country attractive to investors.
In addition to currency needs for trade and investment, many traders buy and sell currency 
for speculative reasons. As discussed in Chapter 19, sometimes people buy something not 
because they need it (e.g., in this case, for facilitating a trade in real items), but because they 
are betting that its price will go up or down in the future. Speculative buying and selling of 
currencies often plays a large role in foreign exchange markets.
Unfortunately, because the ability of a country to participate in global trade critically 
depends on its exchange rate, such “bets” have the potential to produce real economic 
effects that are not always beneﬁcial. As the role of speculation grows in importance relative 
to other factors that inﬂuence exchange rates, the ability of ﬁnancial decisions to affect 
entire economies—especially small, relatively vulnerable economies—only increases. The 
relationship between speculation and ﬁnance, on the one hand, and the “real” economy, on 
the other, is discussed in Chapters 22 and 26 and is explained further in Chapter 30.
As noted above, different countries experience different levels of domestic inﬂation. To 
clarify, “inﬂation” refers to when a currency weakens in terms of domestic purchasing power 
(higher prices mean that the currency is worth relatively less) while “depreciation” is the 
weakening of currency in relation to other currencies (a reduction of its exchange rates). As 
you might expect, the two concepts are related, and what really matters for trade is the real 
exchange rate between currencies. A country with high inﬂation, for example, will generally 
experience a steady depreciation of its nominal (money value) exchange rate against the 
currencies of lower-inﬂation countries, even without any changes in demand for its items. 
Foreigners are willing to purchase the country’s products at the higher prices resulting from 
inﬂation only if they receive more currency units per unit of foreign exchange that they offer, 
such that the real price remains the same.
Most foreign exchange transactions are made in “strong” currencies or currencies that 
other countries would generally not hesitate to accept as payment for goods and services or 
for some investments. The U.S. dollar tops the list, but the euro and the yen also qualify and 
probably the British pound as well. Beyond this, the Swiss franc, famed for its remarkable 
stability, is also considered to be a member of this exclusive club. But the dollar, the euro, and 
the yen stand out as the top three. These currencies are often referred to as foreign exchange 
due to their general acceptability for foreign transactions.

Weak economies seldom if ever accept one another’s currencies, and sometimes not even 
their own currency, as payment for goods, services, or assets. As will become clear, it beneﬁts 
them to be paid in strong currencies. Thus the overwhelming majority of global currency 
trades are in dollars, euros, or yen.
3.3 THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
The ﬂows of foreign exchange payments into and out of a country are summed up in its bal-
ance of payments (BOP) account. Table 29.1 shows the BOP account for the United States 
in 2011. The top part of the table tallies the current account, which tracks ﬂows arising 
from trade in goods and services, earnings, and transfers. The trade account (not shown 
separately in Table 29.1) refers exclusively to the portion of the current account related to 
exports and imports.
Various kinds of transactions lead to payments ﬂowing into this country (and to a demand 
for dollars in the foreign exchange market). When we export goods, we receive payments 
in return. So the ﬁrst entry under current account inﬂows is the $1.497 trillion that the 
United States earned from exports of goods. Exports of services (such as travel, ﬁnancial, 
or intellectual property) also bring in inﬂows, as do incomes earned abroad (as proﬁts or 
interest) by U.S. residents. All told, inﬂows into the United States from exports and incomes 
totaled more than $2.8 trillion in 2011.
Other transactions lead to payments going abroad (and to a supply of dollars to the foreign 
exchange market). When we import goods and services, we need to make payments to foreign 
residents. Foreign residents can take home incomes earned in the United States. The BOP 
account also includes a line for net transfers abroad. The account consists of monies paid out 
in government foreign aid programs as well as remittances—money sent home to families

CHAPTER 29 — THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND POLICY
from the host country by foreign workers. All told, outﬂows of payments from the United 
States totaled just over $3.3 trillion in 2011.
The balance on the current account is measured as inﬂows minus outﬂows. Because 
outﬂows exceeded inﬂows on the current account in 2011, the United States had a current 
account deﬁcit. As you can see from Table 29.1, imports of goods exceeded exports, meaning 
that the United States had a negative trade balance, or trade deﬁcit. Moreover, because income 
ﬂows and transfers were relatively balanced, it was the trade deﬁcit that largely accounted for 
the current account deﬁcit of $466 billion. In fact, as you can see in Figure 29.6, the United 
States has had trade deﬁcits fairly steadily since about 1980, with the gap between imports 
and exports widening to about 6 percent of GDP in some years, but recently narrowing to 
about 3 percent.
How can a country steadily import more than it exports? If you, personally, wanted to 
buy something that costs more than you have the income to pay for, you might take out a 
loan or perhaps sell something that you own, such as your bicycle or your car. Likewise, 
countries can ﬁnance a trade deﬁcit by borrowing or by selling assets. These are the sorts of 
transactions listed in the capital account.
To the extent the United States lends abroad (e.g., when the government extends loans 
to other countries, foreigners borrow from U.S. banks, or people in the United States buy 
foreign bonds), capital outﬂows are generated. This terminology may be confusing. Think 
about capital ﬂows as going in the direction of the country that ends up with “the cash” 
or the power to purchase goods, and away from the country that “buys something.” In the 
case of a loan, the borrower received “the cash,” while the creditor “buys” a bond or other 
security representing a promise to repay; thus a loan is an outﬂow from the lender and an 
inﬂow from the perspective of the borrower. Similarly, if a U.S. ﬁrm engaged in portfolio 
investment—investment in the stocks or bonds of a foreign country or company—or foreign 
direct investment (FDI)—the buying of all or part of a business in another country—it is the 
people abroad who would end up with “the cash,” while the U.S. company would receive the 
asset. This is also counted as an outﬂow. From Table 29.1, we can see that the United States 
had $430 billion in capital outﬂows during 2011.

Capital outﬂows can have widely differing meanings and impacts, depending on where they 
occur. Weak, unstable economies are much more vulnerable to a speciﬁc kind of movement 
known as capital ﬂight, which occurs when investors fear investment losses and rush to 
move their assets to “safer” countries (mostly the United States, the member countries of 
the European Union, and Japan). Capital ﬂight may represent Wall Street investors rushing 
to take their money out of a weak country—as happened with South Korea, Indonesia, and 
the Philippines during the East Asian ﬁnancial crisis of 1997—or the wealthy elite seeking 
to take money out of their own country. In either case, capital ﬂight has the potential to 
destabilize economies by making foreign exchange scarce, and governments will often go 
to great lengths to try to stop it (see Box 29.1).
A country receives capital inﬂows when it borrows from foreigners or when foreigners 
purchase assets there. In the case of the United States, many people abroad buy U.S. 
government bonds, because they are considered a very secure investment. For similar reasons, 
many also put funds into bank accounts here. These are both capital inﬂows—the sellers of 
the U.S. securities and the U.S. banks receive “the cash.” Likewise, if a foreign multinational 
bought an interest in a U.S. publishing company, it would be a capital inﬂow. In 2011, the 
United States received just about $1 trillion in capital inﬂows.
As with the current account, the balance on the capital account is measured as inﬂows 
minus outﬂows. Thus, the United States had a $571 billion capital account surplus in 2011. 
It was the willingness of foreigners to buy U.S. securities (and other assets) that ﬁnanced the 
deﬁcit in the current account. Many commentators worry that the United States is putting itself 
in a vulnerable position by relying on borrowing to “spend beyond its means” on imports. 
Notice that present-day capital inﬂows create the obligation to pay future income outﬂows: 
The interest due in the future on U.S. government bonds sold abroad this year, and future 
proﬁts made by ﬁrms located in the United States that were bought by foreign parties this 
year, will become part of “income payments” in the outﬂows section of the current account, 
in years to come.
Next comes what is known as the ofﬁcial reserve account. It represents the foreign 
exchange market operations of the country’s central bank (in the United States, the Federal 
Reserve). Why the central bank? Here it is probably more helpful to imagine a somewhat 
smaller, less-developed country—say, Indonesia. Like any other country these days, it must 
import some goods and services from other countries. How can it pay for the imports? Its 
currency, the rupiah, will not do. Most exporters have no faith in the value of the rupiah and 
will insist on being paid in foreign exchange—that is, dollars, euros, or yen. This presents 
a problem for Indonesia, because it cannot produce its own dollars. It can, however, obtain 
them.

inﬂation led many afﬂuent Argentines to move their 
money into American real estate by expensive, even 
sometimes illegal means.
Capital outﬂow from Argentina nearly doubled 
from $11.4 billion to $21.5 billion between 2010 
and 2011. The Argentine government has instituted 
capital controls to try to stop the outﬂow, requiring 
special permits to convert pesos into dollars. Trained 
dogs are even used to sniff out dollars at ports, air-
ports, and border crossings. Some Argentines are 
willing to pay a black-market premium of up to 40 
percent to convert their money into dollars. 
The government controls appear to be having 
success. Capital ﬂight from Argentina fell to $3.57 
billion in the ﬁrst half of 2012, from $11.7 billion 
in the second half of 2011.

CHAPTER 29 — THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND POLICY
For example, when Indonesia exports, say, coffee, it can insist on being paid not in rupiah 
but in foreign exchange such as dollars. In this way, it has a strong currency available to pay for 
its imports. It works the same way with the capital account. Indonesia has creditors to whom 
it owes interest every year (which is reﬂected in the income section of the current account) 
that require payment in foreign exchange. Yet Indonesia obtains this foreign exchange not 
only by exporting coffee and other products but also by attracting foreign capital, which it 
also insists take the form of dollars, euros, or yen.
Bank Indonesia, the country’s central bank, holds reserves of foreign currency, so that it can 
make up for a balance of payments deﬁcit if necessary. Of course, it cannot do so indeﬁnitely. 
If the central bank runs short of foreign exchange reserves, the country will have to cut back 
on imports. But in the short term the central bank can supply foreign exchange to cover a 
balance of payments deﬁcit or acquire foreign exchange if there is a balance of payments 
surplus. If the central bank supplies foreign exchange, it is recorded as a positive item in the 
ofﬁcial reserve accounts; if it acquires foreign exchange, it is recorded as a negative item.
In some versions of the BOP, the ofﬁcial reserve account is lumped with the capital 
account.* When this is done, the total inﬂows and outﬂows from the current and capital 
accounts always “balance.” When treated separately, the ofﬁcial reserve account, as we have 
seen, offsets the discrepancy between current and capital accounts. The United States reduced 
its ofﬁcial reserve account by $16 billion in 2011, which means that the Fed’s holdings of 
these assets increased by this amount. If this is confusing, think of it as the negative sign 
signifying that the Fed removed $16 billion in reserve assets (mostly foreign exchange) from 
the U.S. economy.
One additional caveat is the statistical discrepancy. It represents an inability of the BEA 
to make the accounts balance precisely, given problems in the quality of the data, and some 
small items in the accounts that we do not get into here. Allowing for this discrepancy, the 
balances in the current account, the capital account, and the ofﬁcial reserve account must 
add up to zero (the “balance of payments”). The difference between the current and capital 
accounts must be “balanced” by a ﬂow of foreign exchange to or from the central bank. Any 
gap can be fully attributed to measurement error, which is what the statistical discrepancy 
reﬂects.
4. MACROECONOMICS IN AN OPEN ECONOMY
In earlier chapters, our discussion of how ﬁscal and monetary policy can be used to inﬂuence 
aggregate demand was limited to a “closed” economy. We are now ready to consider a more 
complete picture of the effects of such policies. The bottom line of what is laid out in sec-
tions 4.1 and 4.2 is simple to state: The intended effects of monetary policy are strengthened, 
or ampliﬁed, by interactions with the foreign sector; while trade with foreign partners may 
either strengthen or weaken ﬁscal policy actions. The reasons why this is so are, however, 
rather complex. The value of working through them, as we shall do, is that it is a way of 
showing in action some of the principles of macroeconomic supply and demand that have 
been laid out thus far.
4.1 FISCAL POLICY
Recall from our earlier concept of a macroeconomic equilibrium that, for equilibrium to be 
present, injections must equal leakages. We know from Chapter 25 that a budget deﬁcit is 
a net injection because government spending (injection) is greater than tax revenue (leak-
age). If we assume that private savings and investment are in balance, a government budget 
*In recent years, for example, the International Monetary Fund has resorted to calling the capital account the “ﬁnancial 
account,” with the latter calculated to include the ofﬁcial reserve account. We prefer to present the traditional approach to the 
BOP, ﬁnding it more transparent about whether a country is truly in surplus or in deﬁcit.

 
MACROECONOMICS IN AN OPEN ECONOMY 
665
deﬁcit requires a net leakage from the foreign sector for macroeconomic equilibrium to be 
achieved—that is, imports must exceed exports (again, disregarding for now the transfers 
and net income).
In other words, a government’s budget balance is correlated with the country’s trade 
balance—a government deﬁcit, not ﬁnanced from domestic savings, implies a trade deﬁcit. 
But what is the economic mechanism by which they are related? A country’s budget balance 
can inﬂuence its trade balance through at least two separate channels, each related to the 
exchange rate of its currency.
First, we have seen that deﬁcit spending has the potential, in economies at or near full 
employment, to cause crowding out. This tends to lead to higher interest rates. In an open 
economy, the higher rates are likely to attract more foreign investment in the form of bond 
purchases. If foreigners demand more U.S. bonds as a result of the higher interest rates that 
they offer, the demand for dollars increases (because U.S. bonds are all denominated in U.S. 
dollars). The resulting increase in demand for dollars, ceteris paribus, leads to an appreciation 
of the dollar compared to other currencies.
We have also seen that a stronger currency makes a country’s goods relatively more 
expensive in the global markets. In other words, if the U.S. dollar appreciated, we would 
expect the United States to be able to export less than before. At the same time, imports 
would increase because a stronger dollar makes other countries’ goods (denominated in their 
currencies) appear cheaper. Through this sequence, an increase in the budget deﬁcit might 
increase the size of the trade deﬁcit.
Notice, however, that while both deﬁcits grow, the economic effect of the rising trade 
deﬁcit is to offset the expansionary effect of the budget deﬁcit. Imports (leakage from the 
circular ﬂow) increase while exports (injection) decrease. Because we do not know the 
magnitude of each of these changes, we are not saying that the open economy effect cancels 
out the original effect of the ﬁscal stimulus. What we can say is that it probably dampens its 
effect somewhat.
The other channel is a more direct consequence of the ﬁscal expansion. Deﬁcit spending 
boosts aggregate demand, increasing spending and generating greater employment and more 
income. Yet, as the economy grows, all spending grows, including spending on imports. The 
greater demand for imports increases the global supply of dollars, as U.S. citizens demand 
more foreign currency to purchase imports. This causes the dollar to depreciate, reversing 
the process, because a weaker dollar results in more exports and less imports.
Depreciation of the dollar will tend to narrow the trade deﬁcit, resulting in a net injection 
to the circular ﬂow and reinforcing the initial ﬁscal stimulus. Since the two effects we have 
described go in opposite directions, we cannot say anything speciﬁc about the magnitude of 
the changes, nor can we say overall whether the “open economy” on balance reinforces or 
countervails the domestic ﬁscal policy. But we can say that the effect of deﬁcit spending is 
complicated by consideration of foreign sector effects.
4.2 MONETARY POLICY
In Chapter 27 we discussed monetary policy in a closed economy. In an open economy, mon-
etary policy is more effective in changing aggregate demand, because, unlike ﬁscal policy, 
its global effects unambiguously reinforce the domestic policy.
Suppose that the Fed believes the U.S. economy needs a boost and lowers interest rates in 
an attempt to stimulate aggregate demand. As we saw in Chapter 27, the decrease in interest 
rates should encourage investment spending. But in an open economy, the fall in interest rates 
should also increase net exports, another component of aggregate demand.
This is because a reduction in U.S. interest rates is likely to drive away some foreign 
ﬁnancial capital. If interest rates here fell, people abroad would be less inclined to buy U.S. 
government bonds or put their money in U.S. bank accounts. As they sent their ﬁnancial 

666 
CHAPTER 29 — THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND POLICY
capital elsewhere, the demand for U.S. dollars would decrease. This would be portrayed as a 
leftward shift of the demand curve in the foreign exchange market. As discussed above (refer 
to Figure 29.4) a decrease in the demand for dollars would cause the dollar to depreciate.
A depreciation in the dollar means that a dollar now buys fewer units of foreign 
exchange, which, you will recall, discourages spending on imports. Meanwhile, the fact 
that a dollar can be purchased for fewer units of foreign exchange means that U.S. exports 
become “cheap” for foreign buyers. Exports should increase. Because it is demand for 
U.S.-produced goods and services minus imports that enters into aggregate demand, the 
latter rises. Thus, both an increase in exports and a decrease in imports have the effect of 
raising aggregate demand.
The openness of the economy can be thought of as adding an extra loop to the chain of 
causation discussed in Chapter 27, as illustrated below:

Yet this is not the end of the story. Just as in the earlier case of deﬁcit spending, an increase 
in aggregate demand tends to produce an increase in imports. As we have seen, this leads 
to dollar depreciation, as U.S. citizens trade dollars for other currencies so that they can 
purchase imported products.
Here, also, the effect is to reinforce the initial domestic stimulus, since a weaker dollar tends 
to narrow the trade deﬁcit that, as we have seen, increases aggregate demand, ceteris paribus. 
So in contrast to the ﬁscal policy case, where “opening up” the economy produces ambiguous 
effects in relation to a domestic ﬁscal stimulus, for monetary policy the international trade 
consequences clearly reinforce the domestic policy. A monetary stimulus, in other words, is 
ampliﬁed in an open economy. We should note that a monetary contraction would also be 
magniﬁed; the same causal mechanisms would be in effect, only in reverse.
4.3 MANAGED VERSUS FLEXIBLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE
So far, we have assumed that exchange rates are determined by market forces, as modeled in 
Figure 29.5. In a ﬂexible or ﬂoating exchange rate system, countries allow their exchange 
rates to be determined by the forces of supply and demand. But this is not always the case.
Flexible exchange rates can create signiﬁcant uncertainties in an economy. A manufacturer 
may negotiate the future delivery of an imported component, for example, only to ﬁnd that 
exchange rate changes make it much more expensive than expected to complete the deal. 
Foreign exchange markets can also be susceptible to wild swings from speculation. A mere 
rumor of political upheaval in a country, for example, can sometimes create a rush of capital 
outﬂows as people try to move their ﬁnancial assets into foreign banks, causing a precipitous 
drop in the exchange rate. Or an inability to obtain short-term foreign loans may send an 
economy into crisis—and its exchange rate swinging—even if over a longer period the 
economy would be considered ﬁnancially sound. It can be hard to maintain normal economic 
activities when exchange rates ﬂuctuate wildly.
Many countries have tried to control the value of their currencies in order to create a more 
predictable environment for foreign trade. The strictest kind of control is a ﬁxed exchange 
rate system. In this case, a group of countries commits to keeping their currencies trading at 
ﬂexible (ﬂoating)

which exchange rates

demand

MACROECONOMICS IN AN OPEN ECONOMY 
667
ﬁxed ratios over time. Starting in 1944, many countries, including the United States, had ﬁxed 
exchange rates under what is known as the Bretton Woods system (named after the international 
monetary conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire that created a post-war ﬁnancial order 
including the Intentional Monetary Fund and the World Bank).
The exchange rates in such a system, however, do not usually remain perfectly ﬁxed. For 
one thing, it is impossible to literally ﬁx an exchange rate, because the central bank would need 
to have perfect (and continuously perfect) information about all trades. What the countries that 
participated in the Bretton Woods conference did—and countries today that ﬁx their currency 
generally do—is set a “band” or range around a “target rate” and allow the “ﬁxed” rate to 
ﬂuctuate within this band. In the case of the countries that were part of the Bretton Woods 
system, the band was very narrow—on the order of plus or minus 1 percentage point. 
Over the long term, the target rate within the band can change, at the government’s 
discretion. When a government lowers the level at which it ﬁxes its exchange rate, what is 
called a devaluation occurs, and when it raises it, a revaluation takes place. But the system 
can be undermined if there are too many changes, and when key currencies such as the dollar 
come under too much selling pressure a ﬁxed exchange rate system can break up. This is what 
happened to the Bretton Woods system in 1972. The U.S. dollar had been the linchpin of the 
system, and had been convertible to gold. When the United States suffered large currency 
outﬂows, the U.S. eliminated gold convertibility and allowed the currency to ﬂoat, which 
was quickly followed by other major countries ﬂoating their currencies also. 
After the Bretton Woods system ended, many countries moved to a “ﬂoating” system, while 
others tried to exert some management over their currencies. Such management is performed 
by trying to maintain certain target exchange rates, by “pegging” the currency to a particular 
foreign currency or by letting it “ﬂoat” but only within certain bounds (something like the 
Bretton Woods system, only with a much wider band).
How does a country keep its exchange rate ﬁxed, or at least within bounds? A government 
has at its disposal two main tools. The ﬁrst is imposing capital controls. For example, a country 
that wants to limit foreign exchange trading may require that importers apply for licenses to 
deal in foreign exchange or impose quotas on how much they can obtain. By only allowing 
highly regulated transactions, it can control the prices at which exchange transactions are 
made.
The second is foreign exchange market intervention. As we saw earlier in our discussion 
of ofﬁcial reserve accounts, central banks have the power to intervene in foreign exchange 
markets. They may do this under a ﬂoating exchange rate regime, with the object of raising or 
lowering the rate, or to build up or lower their holdings of foreign exchange. When a country 
is committed to a ﬁxed exchange rate, it is the responsibility of the central bank to respond 
to upward or downward pressures on the rate with appropriate intervention in order to keep 
the rate at the prescribed level.
To see how intervention works, consider Figure 29.7. Suppose that the government would 
like to keep the exchange rate of its domestic currency at (or above) the level e*, but market 
pressures are represented by the curves Smarket and Dmarket. At the exchange rate e*, there is an 
excess supply (surplus) of domestic currency, and so there is pressure on the exchange rate to 
fall. The central bank must artiﬁcially create more demand for the domestic currency, as shown 
by demand curve Dwith intervention. It does this by going into the market and exchanging foreign 
currency for domestic currency—essentially “soaking up” the surplus domestic currency.
The problem is that the central bank can do this only as long as it has sufﬁcient reserves 
of foreign exchange on hand. If it ran out of foreign exchange, it would be unable to support 
the currency and be forced to devalue. This is, in fact, fairly common among countries with 
deﬁcits in their BOP, and in some cases leads to a balance of payments crisis.
Is devaluation a bad thing? The answer to this question is complex. Devaluation is generally 
thought to be good for exporters, because it makes the country’s goods cheaper abroad. But 
it also means that people in the country will ﬁnd that imports are now more expensive. And

CHAPTER 29 — THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND POLICY
sometimes devaluation is taken as a sign of instability or poor policy in a country or leads to 
international runs of speculation or competitive devaluation.
Imagine, for example, an investor who is considering investing $100 million in Bolivian 
government bonds. If it seemed likely that the country’s currency—the sucre—would at some 
point be devalued, the best strategy would be to avoid investing in Bolivia. If the exchange 
rate today were 5,000 sucres to the dollar, the investor could purchase 500 billion sucres 
worth of bonds with $100 million. But if the currency were in fact later devalued—to the 
point where 10,000 sucres would be needed to purchase a dollar—the investment would 
subsequently only be worth $50 million if the investor decided to sell the bonds and convert 
back to dollars. Because of the potential problems resulting from currency devaluation, many 
economists have grown cautious about recommending devaluation as a cure for international 
imbalances.
In contrast, a country can keep its exchange rate lower than market forces would dictate 
by supplying a lot of its domestic currency on the market and amassing large amounts of 
foreign reserves. Recently, China has used this tactic, keeping the value of its currency, the 
renminbi artiﬁcially low to stimulate exports. (The value of renminbi is often cited in terms 
of its most common unit, the yuan). China has, in the process, become a large holder of U.S. 
dollars as well as other currencies. China has been under pressure from many countries to 
revalue the renminbi (see Box 29.2).
One complication with ﬁxed exchange rates is that they make it impossible for a country 
to conduct independent monetary policy. The reason is that intervention by its central bank on 
money markets to buy and sell its currency for foreign exchange reasons necessarily affects 
the country’s domestic money supply, and vice versa. A country can set its exchange rate or 
its interest rate, but not both. If it keeps its exchange rate ﬁxed relative to another currency, 
the interest rates in the two countries will tend to move together.
The adoption of the euro by some member countries of the European Union (EU) is a 
dramatic recent example of ﬁxed exchange rates—taken a step further. In 1999 eleven member 
countries established ﬁxed exchange rates between their national currencies and the euro—
although, at that time, the euro was just an accounting notation. In 2002, euro banknotes and 
coins were put into circulation and national currencies were withdrawn. The countries that 
have adopted the euro have given up having separate monetary policies, putting the European 
Central Bank in control of monetary policy-making for the group as a whole. Because of 
this, and the fact that different countries often have different objectives and requirements, 
monetary policy is often more complicated in the eurozone than in individual countries (see 
Box 29.3). At latest count, the EU has 27 members, of which 17 participate in the euro.

bank has to buy up the surplus of

BOX 29.2 UNITED STATES PRESSURES CHINA TO REVALUE ITS CURRENCY 
For some time, the United States has put pressure 
on China to revalue its currency. In May 2012, The 
U.S. Treasury Department said that China had made 
progress in allowing its currency to rise against the 
dollar. This ﬁnding averted a formal charge of cur-
rency manipulation and a likely trade dispute. But 
the Treasury still considered China’s currency, the 
renminbi, to be undervalued, meaning that it needed 
to appreciate further against the dollar.
The renminbi gained 8 percent against the dol-
lar between 2010 and 2012. A currency with a 
lower value gives China a trade advantage by 
making its exports cheaper and imports from the 
United States more expensive. Some American 
manufacturers have urged the administration to 
take punitive steps to force China to allow the 
renminbi to trade freely. The renminbi now trades 
within a narrow range against the dollar.
The U.S. trade deﬁcit with China was $315 billion 
in 2012. The continuing trade deﬁcit means that 
the issue of currency valuation will continue to be 
a point of dispute between the two countries, with 
some U.S. legislators urging stronger action to force 
China to revalue.

BOX 29.3 EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK GRAPPLES WITH INTEREST RATES AND EURO VALUE 
February 7, 2013—Mario Draghi, the president of 
the European Central Bank, cited the rising value of 
the euro as a possible threat to the region’s economic 
recovery. His comments immediately sent the euro 
down sharply against the dollar and yen. While the 
ECB President denied trying to inﬂuence the value of 
the euro, he implied that the Bank could take action 
if the euro rose too much.
“The exchange rate is not a policy target, but 
it is important for growth and price stability,” 
Mr. Draghi said at a news conference after the 
regular monthly policy meeting of the ECB’s 
Governing Council, in which the central bank 
left its main interest rate at 0.75 percent, as 
expected.
 
Mr. Draghi, during the news conference, was 
careful to avoid any explicit threat to take action 
to push down the euro or to criticize any other 
countries. He said the euro’s current value was 
not far from its historical norm. But he noted 
that economic policy by other countries, none 
of which he identiﬁed, could affect exchange 
rates.
 
Recovery in the Eurozone could be threatened 
by the rising value of the euro, which could hurt 
European exports by making them more expen-
sive for foreign buyers. In recent weeks, the euro 
has risen substantially against the dollar, to its 
highest levels in a year.
 
A stronger euro means that products rang-
ing from cars to wine become more expensive 
abroad, putting European producers at a disad-
vantage against foreign competitors. But there 
are also positive effects. Imports, particularly 
oil, become less expensive for Europeans, which 
helps stimulate the economy.

5. INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
The Bretton Woods system of ﬁxed exchange rates was only one aspect of the international 
ﬁnancial structure established in the 1940s. Also formed during this period were the Inter-
national Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), later expanded into the World 
Bank, with the goal of promoting economic development through loans and programs aimed 
at poorer countries, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), established to oversee 
international ﬁnancial arrangements. Although ﬁxed exchange rates have been abandoned, 
the World Bank and the IMF continue—with considerable controversy—to play signiﬁcant 
roles in international affairs.

CHAPTER 29 — THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND POLICY
The IMF was charged with overseeing exchange rates, international payments, and balance 
of payments management and with giving advice to countries about their ﬁnancial affairs. 
The IMF has a complicated governance structure based on voting shares allocated to member 
countries, but in fact its policy-making has historically been dominated by the United States 
and certain countries in Europe. The appointed members of its executive board represent 
the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan. The IMF recently 
restructured its voting system to give China, South Korea, Turkey, and Mexico slightly larger 
shares. Both the World Bank and IMF have their headquarters in Washington, DC.
When a country is in ﬁnancial trouble—for example, when it is unable to pay the interest 
that it owes on its foreign debts or is experiencing wild swings in its exchange rate—the IMF 
(in conjunction with the World Bank, if the country is poor) often advises the government 
on how to remedy the problem. The IMF has tended to encourage low- and middle-income 
countries with debt problems to remove their barriers to trade and capital ﬂows, arguing that 
such liberalization promotes economic growth. The countries are also advised to minimize 
the size of their government and its expenditures, as a way to reduce the need for borrowing. 
They are told to keep their inﬂation rates down and are often advised about their exchange 
rate policies as well.
The policy prescriptions of trade liberalization, privatization, deregulation, and small government 
became known during the 1980s and 1990s as the Washington Consensus (described in more 
detail in Chapter 32). The policies have also become the source of much controversy, as many 
economists have come to believe that rigid, “one-size-ﬁts-all” application of such policies often 
works against, rather than for, human welfare and international stability (see Box 29.4).
Although the lending power of the IMF gives it considerable say in the affairs of many 
countries—for better or worse—the powers of any international organization are limited, 
especially with regard to the countries that are larger and more powerful. For example, 
many commentators worry about issues such as the undervalued Chinese renminbi/yuan, 
or the volume of foreign debt being taken on by the United States, but there is currently no 
international institution with the power to force China or the United States to change their 
policies. The IMF was also unable to prevent the rapid development of global ﬁnancial crisis 
in 2008–9, although it played a role in putting together bailout packages for some countries 
after the crisis. 
Many observers are currently calling for reforms in the international ﬁnancial system and 
perhaps for new international institutions. Dissatisfaction over the IMF prescriptions for 
liberalization has caused some changes within the organization itself. But some argue that 
these changes are not sufﬁcient and that more radical changes are necessary. Suggestions 
include greater regulation of international banking, substantial reforms and increased 
transparency in multinational corporate governance, restrictions on short-term capital ﬂows, 
a tax on speculative transactions in foreign exchange (see Chapter 30), and establishment of 
an international bankruptcy court.
Discussion Questions
1. To check your understanding of international linkages, consider the following hypothetical 
scenario. Suppose that people overseas become less interested in buying U.S. government 
bonds (perhaps because they start to think of them as less secure). What would be the 
effect on:
a. The BOP ﬁnancial account?
b. The supply or demand for U.S. dollars?
c. The value of the U.S. dollar?
d. The BOP current account?

REVIEW QUESTIONS
BOX 29.4 THE IMF AND THE ARGENTINE DEFAULT
In December 2001, the Argentine government an-
nounced a moratorium on payments on its $155 
billion in public foreign debt. This default—the 
largest by a sovereign nation in history—rocked the 
international ﬁnancial world. Was there more that 
the IMF could have done to prevent this? Or might 
IMF advice have been part of the reason that the 
default occurred?
In 1991 Argentina had pegged its currency to 
the U.S. dollar, as a way of bringing hyperinﬂation 
to a halt. The IMF, believing that this would lead to 
more discipline in Argentine policy-making, ap-
proved the peg. But with the dollar strong against the 
currencies of Europe and Brazil, Argentina’s major 
trading partners, the peg made Argentina’s exports 
expensive. This discouraged Argentine industry and 
encouraged the purchase of imports. Trade deﬁ-
cits resulted, ﬁnanced by borrowing from abroad. 
Unemployment rose.
The IMF advised the Argentine government 
to address its ﬁnancial issues by cutting back on 
government expenditures and privatizing its social 
security program. The country’s leaders complied, 
even though the economy was in a downturn. The 
IMF encouraged Argentina to institute free trade poli-
cies, though major markets in the United States and 
Europe remained closed to its exports. Meanwhile, ﬁ-
nancial crises in Asia, Mexico, and Brazil made inves-
tors more nervous about lending to middle-income 
countries. The fact that the Argentine economy was 
visibly struggling caused foreign lenders to demand 
higher interest rates to compensate them for the risk 
of default. This in turn made the debt even harder 
to bear, in a vicious circle.
In December 2001, the situation reached a crisis. 
With ofﬁcial unemployment nearing 20 percent, 
people demonstrated in the street, which led the gov-
ernment to fall. Unable to make its debt payments, 
the interim government announced the default. The 
Argentine economy continued in a downward slide 
well into 2002.
Some commentators have blamed the default on 
corruption and mismanagement by the Argentine 
government and suggested that the crisis might 
have been avoided if the government had cut its 
expenditures even more. Others, observing that 
the government budget deﬁcit was actually of a 
quite reasonable size (less than 3 percent of GDP), 
believe that inappropriate IMF advice is at least 
as much to blame. Basic principles of macroeco-
nomics say that a government should raise—not 
lower—spending during a recession, but the IMF 
policies went in the opposite direction, pushing 
the economy into a downward spiral. According 
to this view, given IMF advice, default was only a 
matter of time.

APPENDIX: AN ALGEBRAIC APPROACH TO THE MULTIPLIER, IN A MODEL WITH TRADE
Just as we modiﬁed the multiplier in the appendix to Chapter 25 to take account of the impact 
of taxes, we can now go a step further to consider the effect of trade. Suppose that, in addition 
to consumption’s depending on income, imports depend on income according to the equation 
IM = mpim Y, where mpim is the marginal propensity to import (the proportion of additional 
income spent on imports). The mpim is a fraction. Starting with the equation for aggregate 
demand with a proportional tax that we had derived in the appendix to Chapter 25, we can 
get an equation for aggregate demand in an economy including trade, as follows:
AD = C + II + G + X – IM
= ×C + mpc (Y – tY + TR) + II + G + X – mpim Y
= (×C+ mpcTR + II + G + X) + [mpc(1 – t) – mpim] Y
The AD curve now has the intercept given by the ﬁrst term in parentheses. Changes in 
exports shift the curve upward or downward. The new slope is given by the term in brackets. 
The slope is ﬂatter, due to the subtraction of mpim.
Solving for Y (using the same method as in the appendix to Chapter 25—but leaving out 
some of the intermediate steps) yields:
Y – mpc (1 – t) Y + mpim Y = C + mpc TR + II + G + X

The term in brackets is a new multiplier that includes both proportional taxes and imports 
that depend on domestic income. This multiplier here is even smaller than the previous 
two. For example, if mpc = .8, t = .2, and mpim = .1, the new multiplier is 1/(1 – .64 + .1) 
or 1/(0.46) or approximately 2.2. This is because any increase in Y now “leaks” not only 
into saving and taxes but also into increases in imports (which takes away from demand 
for domestic products).

30 The Financial Crisis and the  
Great Recession
The ﬁnancial crisis that commenced in 2007 and its aftermath have been widely referred to 
as the “Great Recession”—and with good reason. From its beginning until its nadir in 2009, 
it was responsible for the destruction of nearly $20 trillion worth of ﬁnancial assets owned by 
U.S. households. During this time, the U.S. unemployment rate rose from 4.7 percent to 10 
percent (not counting the discouraged and marginally attached workers discussed in Chapter 
23). By 2010, college graduates fortunate enough to ﬁnd a job were, on average, earning 17.5 
percent less than their counterparts before the crisis—and experts were predicting that such 
a decline in earnings would persist for more than a decade.
The crisis also spread beyond U.S. borders. As consumption and income declined in the 
United States, many countries experienced a signiﬁcant reduction in exports as well as a decline 
in the investments that they held in the United States. As a result, global GDP declined by 2 
percent in 2009. It has been estimated that between 50 million and 100 million people around 
the world either fell into, or were prevented from escaping, extreme poverty due to the crisis. 
Why did this happen? Why were its effects so long-lasting? What lessons can be learned for 
the future? These are complicated questions to which this chapter provides some answers.
1. PRELUDE TO A CRISIS
In retrospect, perhaps it is not difﬁcult to see that something “big” was going to happen. 
Economic conditions were unusual. The federal funds rate, and interest rates in general, were 
at historic lows. The extremely low mortgage rates were particularly important, because they 
motivated an unprecedented rush to buy real estate. Even people who ordinarily would have 
little hope of obtaining a mortgage got in on the action. As record numbers of consumers 
bought homes and investment properties, housing prices surged. Most people—realtors in 
particular—did not appear to think that house prices could ever go down again.
1.1 THE HOUSING BUBBLE
The housing bubble was an archetypal bubble. Like others before it, this bubble began in-
nocently enough, with an increase in demand for real estate. As we learned in Chapter 4, 
an increase in market demand tends to increase prices, and the housing market proved no 
exception. Unfortunately, the increase in home prices fed a speculative frenzy, and millions 
rushed to buy, believing that prices could only go in one direction—up! The buyers included 
not only would-be homeowners, but also speculators who were buying simply with an interest 
in “ﬂipping” the property (reselling at a higher price). The naive view exhibited by so many 
is characteristic of earlier bubbles, during which the lessons of the past were ignored.
To obtain a sense of the magnitude of the housing bubble, consider that average real home 
prices—that is, adjusting for inﬂation—were only 2 percent higher in 1997 than a century 

678 
CHAPTER 30 — THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE GREAT RECESSION
earlier (Figure 30.1). But prices skyrocketed starting in the late 1990s, and by the time they 
peaked in 2006 the average price of a house was nearly twice the long-term average price in 
the previous century. And the subsequent collapse was such that a mere six years later, prices 
had reverted to their long-term trend.
What fed the speculative ﬂurry that gave rise to such a massive bubble? In part, it was 
the bubble immediately preceding it—the “dot-com” bubble in technology stocks (discussed 
in Chapter 19). Even after a bubble bursts—and the dot-com bubble deﬂated from 2000 
to 2003—there are winners as well as losers. Many beneﬁciaries of the dot-com bubble 
perceived themselves as considerably better off than a few years earlier and spent their 
newfound wealth on, among other things, bigger and more expensive houses. Demand for 
houses persisted, and even grew, despite continually increasing prices that, perversely, only 
conﬁrmed expectations of continually rising prices. The result was an upward spiral of self-
fulﬁlling speculative price hikes.
Another major factor was the unprecedented access to credit in the form of mortgages. 
During the mid-1990s, U.S. households borrowed an annual average of approximately $200 
billion in the form of mortgages for home purchases. The ﬁgure rose abruptly to $500 billion 
for the period 1998–2002 and to $1 trillion from 2003 to 2006. While widespread access to 
credit is arguably critical for a vibrant economy, an exceedingly rapid increase in borrowing 
has, throughout history, been among the most consistent determinants of ﬁnancial crises. By 
inﬂating bubbles, credit booms have invariably led to ﬁnancial busts.
The key Federal Reserve interest rates—particularly the federal funds rate—are decisive 
in regulating credit availability. We saw in Chapter 27 how the Fed uses monetary policy 
to control interest rates; the critical point to remember in this context is that changes in the 
Fed’s key rates percolate through the economy, because banks that can borrow at lower rates 
will also lend at lower rates and vice-versa. The 2001 recession that followed the collapse 
of the dot-com bubble prompted the Fed, led by Chairman Alan Greenspan, to lower the 
target federal funds rate from 6 percent to 1.75 percent. The Fed kept the rate low and in the 
summer of 2003 lowered it still further—to 1 percent, its lowest level in 50 years. The low 
federal funds rate in turn led to rate reductions across the board, including the rates for loans 
and home mortgages. These reductions fueled the borrowing binge that caused real estate 
prices to spiral upward (Figure 30.2).
Mortgage rates hit a 50-year low of just over 5 percent in 2003, and borrowing to ﬁnance home 
purchases consequently skyrocketed. There was also a second, less well understood, channel

PRELUDE TO A CRISIS 
679
through which low rates contributed to the housing bubble. To understand it, you must keep in 
mind that while low interest rates are attractive to borrowers, they are decidedly unattractive 
to lenders. Here we are speaking not so much of the commercial banks that are extending 
mortgages to their customers—because the rate they charge, however low, is always considerably 
higher than the rate that they must pay to depositors—as of other ﬁnancial institutions (such as 
investment banks) or high-net-worth individuals who are seeking higher returns on their money. 
With the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act provision separating commercial and investment 
banking, many more ﬁnancial players were now able to participate in the mortgage market.
In this period, U.S. Treasury bonds of all types were paying very low rates, and stocks were 
still not performing well on account of the bursting of the dot-com bubble. Financial investors 
who had grown accustomed to the much higher returns on their money that were available 
in previous decades were struggling to ﬁnd more proﬁtable ways to invest their money. 
Meanwhile, a rapidly growing number of prospective homebuyers were seeking mortgages 
at favorable rates. Traditionally, home mortgages involved only the borrower, on one side, 
and the bank that provided the funds, on the other. But this was to change, as investment 
banks now saw a unique opportunity to meet both investor and homebuyer interests with a 
single ﬁnancial product: a mortgage-backed security (MBS).
A mortgage-backed security is a bundle of independently issued home mortgages that 
an investor may buy in order to obtain a share of the mortgage interest payments; you could 
think of it as something like a mutual fund, but containing mortgages instead of stocks or 
government bonds. The investor also takes on the default risk from the individual mortgages 
that make up the MBS—that is, the risk that the homebuyers might not be able to make their 
mortgage payments. This risk varies from case to case, and here is where matters become a 
bit more complex.
Each MBS is divided into tiers or tranches, with the “senior” tranche the ﬁrst to be paid in 
the event of mortgage defaults (hence, the safest). The “lowest tranche” is the riskiest but is 
correspondingly paid a higher return. Essentially, MBSs are a kind of derivative, constructed 
by mathematically proﬁcient analysts who are paid to calculate the appropriate risk-return 
balance for each of the individual tranches.*

prices began to be 
apparent in 2006.

CHAPTER 30 — THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE GREAT RECESSION
Following the advent of MBSs in the 1990s, banks increasingly acted as intermediaries 
that made housing loans and then bundled the mortgages together to be sold for a fee to 
investors. In the early 2000s, MBSs offered more attractive rates of return to investors than 
many types of bonds, both because of the Fed’s continued low interest rates and the fact 
that mortgages generally pay higher interest rates than most other types of loans. Private 
investment banks were selling large quantities of MBSs, and the share of residential 
mortgages that were bundled into MBSs grew from 50 percent in 1995 to more than 80 
percent by 2008.
But ﬁnancial institutions then went even further. They developed another type of 
security known as a collateralized debt obligation (CDO), which is an even more complex 
investment product. It packages together a variety of loans, including, especially, MBSs—
thus making it a “bundle of bundles” of mortgages. As in the case of MBSs, a hierarchy of 
tranches is available, each carrying a calculated risk-return balance. The complexity of the 
bundling that was involved meant that even the analysts entrusted with the construction 
of CDOs did not always fully understand them, and certainly the investors who bought 
them, and many of the ﬁnancial executives who approved their use, had little idea of the 
risks involved.
After packaging mortgages into MBSs, and MBSs into CDOs, investment banks also sought 
to insure the most senior tranches of each of them against default risk. Companies such as 
American International Group (AIG) sold what are known as credit default swaps (CDSs), 
which are a form of insurance policy against defaults related to MBSs or CDOs. In such an 
arrangement, the buyer of the CDS (usually an investment bank) pays a fee to the seller (an 
insurance company), which agrees to cover losses in case of a default.
During the early 2000s, it became an increasingly common practice to sell CDSs to insure 
the top tranches of MBSs and CDOs. Anyone can enter the market to buy a CDS; when one 
buys the CDS without owning the debt or mortgage that it insures, it is known as a “naked” 
CDS. Critics have argued that naked CDSs should be banned—likening them to buying ﬁre 
insurance on your neighbor’s home—because the owner of the CDS in this case would gain 
if the investment defaults on its payments. The European Parliament indeed saw it this way 
when, in 2011, it banned naked CDSs on European government debt. 
To feed the escalating demand for higher returns, investment banks started offering MBSs 
and CDOs, with the risk to be insured by CDSs. Yet in order to satisfy demand for the new 
products, it was important to maintain a large nationwide pool of home mortgages. And here 
a problem emerged. Despite the historically low interest rates and unprecedented access to 
credit, it seemed that new loans could not be issued quickly enough to fulﬁll investor demand 
for the new bundled securities. In order to persuade even more people to become homeowners, 
banks needed not only to continue offering low rates but also to relax some of their lending 
criteria. This was to be a critical factor in the subprime crisis.
1.2 THE SUBPRIME CRISIS
Although unbridled optimism about home prices and cheap credit contributed their fair share 
to the housing bubble, the expansion and deﬂation of the bubble could not have been so dra-
matic or damaging in the absence of an extraordinary buildup of risky lending. A new kind 
of loan, the subprime mortgage, became common.
Banks typically classify subprime borrowers as individuals who may have difﬁculty 
repaying the loan due to a high level of debt, relatively low income, or a poor credit 
record. Historically, banks have either turned down the subprime borrower or charged 
him/her a higher interest rate to compensate for the increased lending risk.
During the housing bubble, both restrictions were relaxed: The criteria for mortgage 
eligibility were loosened, and the interest rate charged to subprime borrowers was lowered. 
The number of subprime mortgages soared. In 2002, less than 10 percent of U.S. mortgages 
collateralized debt 
obligation: an invest-
ment product that

were subprime; a mere three years later, approximately 25 percent were. While the housing 
bubble was inﬂating, many commentators exulted that homeownership was becoming a 
reality for many for whom it had previously been only a dream. The argument lost credibility 
several years later, however, when the housing bubble burst. Subprime credit evaporated, and 
countless borrowers, unable to keep up with their mortgage payments, faced foreclosure.
Evidence supports the claim that the explosion of subprime lending intensiﬁed both the 
rise and the fall of the entire housing bubble. As noted above, mortgage borrowing doubled 
from an annual average of $500 billion from 1998 to 2002 to $1 trillion in the 2003–6 period. 
The rapid increase can be attributed largely to the proliferation of subprime lending. When 
housing prices ﬁnally started turning downward in 2006, continuing mortgage payments 
became especially difﬁcult for subprime borrowers. The resulting wave of subprime 
foreclosures hastened the downward spiral of prices, because they created a glut in housing 
supply. Meanwhile, a widespread tightening of credit led to a drop in demand. An increase 
in supply coupled with a drop in demand is a recipe for lower prices, and that is precisely 
what was observed after the bubble burst.
Discussion Questions
1. People often refer to the housing “bubble” and even the housing “crisis.” Is an increase in 
the average price of homes not a good thing? What if prices are rising more rapidly than 
in the past? Explain.
2. Would you prefer interest rates in the economy to be high or low? On what does it depend? 
Who beneﬁtted from low interest rates during the inﬂation of the housing bubble? How 
did the low interest rates create problems?
2. ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE CRISIS
In Chapters 22 and 26, we discussed the relationship between the ﬁnancial and the “real” 
economies. The ﬁnancial crisis clearly demonstrated the importance of this relationship. The 
disappearance of immense ﬁnancial wealth in the immediate aftermath of the crisis spilled 
over into the real economy. As people had less wealth, they were apt to spend less. (This 
is what we identiﬁed as the “wealth effect” in Chapter 28.) Even those who preferred to 
continue spending often found that banks were suddenly much more reluctant to lend them 
money. Less spending resulted in sharply lower output and a weaker labor market, as our 
circular ﬂow analysis suggests. (As noted in Chapter 28, Keynesian economists argue that, 
were it not for an active government policy and the existing social safety net, things could 
have been much worse.)
2.1 UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE VICIOUS RECESSIONARY SPIRAL
As a consequence of the crisis, the U.S. economy lost nearly 9 million jobs from 2007 to 
2009. Over a particular eight-month period spanning 2008 and 2009, the average U.S. 
household lost nearly $100,000 from its property and retirement portfolio values combined. 
Approximately 11 million homebuyers faced foreclosure from 2008 to mid-2012, account-
ing for about one of every four mortgages in the United States. Tens of millions were made 
poorer, if not “ofﬁcially” poor. Clearly, the massive loss of speculative ﬁnancial wealth on 
Wall Street (much of it related to depressed MBS and CDO values) translated to a compa-
rable loss of real wealth on “Main Street.” The ﬁnancial crisis had turned into a broad-based 
economic crisis.
Although many families experienced hardship, certain groups were affected 
disproportionately. Young people, for example, suffered a heavy impact from the unemployment 
crisis. Each year brought a new wave of recent graduates into the workforce, adding to the 
masses of young people already facing dismal job prospects. Certain industries, such as 

682 
CHAPTER 30 — THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE GREAT RECESSION
construction and manufacturing, were hit particularly hard. Construction unemployment 
rates nearly tripled from 2007 to 2010, while manufacturing unemployment jumped from 
4.3 percent in 2007 to 12.1 percent in 2009.
The economic impact of the ﬁnancial crisis persisted for an unusually long period. The 
unemployment rate remained above 7 percent through late 2013 (see Box 30.1). Why 
was this? As we saw in earlier chapters, the circular ﬂow economy can, in difﬁcult times, 
produce a vicious cycle. Unemployed workers generally have less income to spend. Families 
facing income losses and needing ﬁnancial assistance can ordinarily borrow money—but 
after the ﬁnancial crisis of 2007–8, banks and ﬁnancial institutions introduced tougher 
standards for credit card loans and home equity loans, in which an equity stake in a home 
is posted as collateral. This led to a “credit crunch” in which families and business were 
unable to obtain loans.
Many families were therefore compelled to cut their spending further; in the period from 
2008 to 2011, U.S. consumers on average reported spending $175 per month less than they 
would have in the absence of a recession. Many employers, suddenly facing lower proﬁts, 
ﬁred workers, contributing to a vicious unemployment cycle. While the values of MBSs and 
other newfangled securities seemed to plunge overnight, it took longer for the ensuing credit 
contraction to affect business bottom lines, employment decisions, and consumer spending. 
Thus the crisis that began in 2007 led to a recession and very slow recovery that lasted more 
than ﬁve years.

BOX 30.1 THE COSTS OF LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT
The long-term unemployment that followed the Great 
Recession was unprecedented since the 1930s, and 
has exacted a huge human and economic cost.
Long-term unemployment is experienced dis-
proportionately by the young, the old, the less 
educated, and African-American and Latino 
workers. While older workers are less likely to be 
laid off than younger workers, they are about half 
as likely to be rehired. [As a result] the number 
of unemployed people between ages 50 and 65 
has more than doubled.
 
The result is nothing short of a national 
emergency. Millions of workers have been dis-
connected from the work force, and possibly even 
from society. If they are not reconnected, the costs 
to them and to society will be grim. (Baker and 
Hassett, 2012)
Research indicates a 50 to 100 percent increase 
in death rates for older male workers in the years 
following a job loss. One reason for this higher 
mortality is suicide. The longer the period of unem-
ployment, the higher the risk of suicide. Joblessness 
is also linked to higher rates of serious disease and 
higher probability of divorce. Effects last into the next 
generation; children whose fathers lose a job have 
lower annual earning as adults than those whose 
fathers do not experience unemployment. 
In the aftermath of the Great Recession, a slow 
recovery has seen lower job gains for men than 
women. By 2013, women’s total private sector 
employment was slightly higher than before the re-
cession, but jobs for men still lagged 3 percentage 
points below their previous levels.
Work-sharing programs that encourage com-
panies to cut hours rather than payrolls, as well 
as retraining and re-employment programs, could 
help to mitigate the cost of long-term unemploy-
ment. Unfortunately, many state governments have 
taken the opposite approach, cutting aid to the 
unemployed. In 2013 North Carolina, with one of 
the highest jobless rates in the nation, cut both the 
duration and amount of unemployment beneﬁts. 
According to economist Paul Krugman, this is “coun-
terproductive as well as cruel—it will lead to lower 
spending, worsening the economic situation, and 
destroying more jobs.”

ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE CRISIS 
683
Modern economies are, in a certain sense, more vulnerable to events in ﬁnance than they 
were in the past. Due in large part to the proliferation of mutual funds and their increased 
availability in employee retirement accounts, a higher percentage of the population than ever 
before have a ﬁnancial stake in the stock and bond markets.
Today, even if ﬁnancial instability is mostly speculative in nature and does not have a direct 
economic cause, it produces very real economic effects because consumers who feel poorer 
spend less money, potentially triggering a downturn characterized by reduced economic output 
and high unemployment. As we saw in Chapter 28, a leftward shift in the AD curve during 
the ﬁnancial crisis decreased GDP and produced widespread fears of deﬂation.
Income and wealth inequality, already severe before the crisis, only intensiﬁed after it. 
While the wealthiest members of society lost the most in dollar terms (although much of it 
was recovered by 2010), the lower and middle classes, on average, lost a far greater share 
of their existing wealth. From mid-2007 to early 2009, U.S. families lost $10.9 trillion in 
ﬁnancial investments related to stocks and bonds, amounting to an average loss of nearly 
$100,000 per household. More than half of U.S. households held retirement accounts whose 
value plummeted during the crisis, wrecking the retirement plans of millions of middle-class 
families. From 2007 through 2010, the median household lost nearly 40 percent of owned 
wealth, effectively undoing 18 years of wealth accumulation. And the poorest 25 percent 
suffered the most; their average household net worth fell to zero.
2.2 THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND THE GREAT RECESSION COMPARED
Calling the period after the ﬁnancial crisis the “Great Recession” invites comparison with the 
other “great” economic downturn of the past century, the Great Depression. What makes the 
Great Recession different from previous recessions is the duration of the downturn. During 
most of the twentieth century, after about 1940, a recession was an almost predictable busi-
ness cycle downturn followed, after a few quarters, by a solid economic recovery. Although 
the NBER declared the latest recession “ofﬁcially” over by 2009, the slow pace of recovery 
in the job market, continued foreclosures, and a continued sense of despondency among the 
general public made many feel that the “recession” continued much longer. Even after 2009, 
most of the damaging effects of recession lingered, especially for the long-term unemployed 
and for new entrants into the labor market.*
Are the current downturn and the Great Depression comparable? Followers of historical 
trends point out that both downturns were preceded by a period of apparent economic strength. 
Those who remember the dot-com bubble that preceded the one in housing may not know that 
Americans experienced a similar asset bubble during the 1920s. Many banks were starting 
to diversify their services, moving into real estate and other relatively risky investments, 
potentially contributing to the bubble. Not unlike the more recent period, in the 1920s people 
were feeling optimistic and were therefore spending, many immoderately, driving prices up. 
Average annual economic growth during the 1920s is estimated to have been more than 4 
percent, so things were looking good. Yet, as also occurred before the current downturn, the 
rapidly inﬂating asset bubble in the 1920s, most manifest in the main stock indexes like the 
Dow Jones Industrials (not in housing), inevitably collapsed.
In terms of possible factors that caused each economic downturn, the two episodes may have 
been more similar than different. But in terms of economic consequences, the differences are 
noteworthy, and the principal reason relates to government regulation, automatic stabilizers, 
and discretionary ﬁscal and monetary policy. For example, thousands of banks failed in the 
early years of the Great Depression, causing millions of depositors to lose their savings. In 
contrast, there was not a single such case in the aftermath of the recent crisis. Some banks 
*Remember from Chapter 24 that a recession technically ends as soon as GDP stops falling and starts rising again, but that 
unemployment may continue to rise for some time after this.

CHAPTER 30 — THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE GREAT RECESSION
did fail (though far fewer than in the 1930s), but depositors’ accounts were protected by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). In response to the crisis, the insurance limit for 
deposits was raised from $100,000 to $250,000, helping to prevent any depositor panic. 
The existence of a government-ﬁnanced “social safety net” also made a major difference. 
Not only was the unemployment rate at the nadir of the ﬁnancial crisis much lower than 
during the depths of the Great Depression (10 percent compared to 25 percent), but the 
unemployed were eligible for “extended beneﬁts” of up to 99 weeks during the worst period 
of the recession (reduced to 73 weeks in 2012). There was no unemployment insurance during 
the Great Depression, nor did food stamps exist. 
Such beneﬁts enabled many of those involuntarily jobless to function during the worst 
part of the recent downturn, keeping consumption levels, and the broader economy, more 
or less stable despite the slow job recovery. The absence of such basic government support 
during the 1930s consigned millions to misery and prolonged the depression. In addition to 
the existence of automatic stabilizers, such as unemployment and food stamps, aggressive 
expansionary ﬁscal and monetary policies were put in place by the federal government and 
the Fed, starting in late 2008 (discussed in detail below).
Broad statistics support the conclusion that, for all the difﬁculties caused by the Great 
Recession, they were signiﬁcantly less than those during the Great Depression. The U.S. 
economy, for example, moved into its recovery phase a mere year and a half after the ﬁnancial 
collapse; during the Great Depression it took almost four years. Because of the social safety 
net that is in place now, consumption remained relatively stable, and deﬂation was averted 
(average prices actually rose nearly 2 percent from 2007 to 2009). In contrast, during the 
early years of the Great Depression, prices declined by more than 25 percent. And while the 
Dow Jones Industrials average lost slightly more than half its peak value in late 2008, it lost 
nearly 90 percent of its value after the market collapsed in 1929.
The principal difference, then, between the two periods is the existence of a social safety net, 
government regulations to protect ordinary Americans, and activist macroeconomic policy. It is 
no coincidence that programs such as Social Security, food stamps, and unemployment insurance 
were introduced in the 1930s under the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt. For all the anxiety 
over deregulation and the reduction in the social safety net over the past three decades, the ﬁnancial 
crisis laid bare the importance of a government presence in the economy. Government programs, 
ﬁrst instituted in the 1930s, kept the current downturn from becoming far worse.
Discussion Questions
1. Do you think changes in the value of “paper assets” like stocks and bonds, or even of 
homes, should have real economic effects? Why? Why do you think that employment suf-
fered from the disappearance of so much ﬁnancial wealth following the ﬁnancial crisis?
2. Do you think that the Great Recession is nearly as bad as the Great Depression was? In 
what ways is it similar to it? In what ways was it different? Do you know any stories of 
family members who lived through the Great Depression?
3. UNDERLYING CAUSES OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS
Many factors were behind the Great Recession. We have reviewed the fact that many unqualiﬁed 
borrowers were permitted—often actively encouraged—to buy homes that they could not afford. 
Other factors include the determination of large banks and the “titans” of ﬁnance to maintain high 
returns for their loans and investments, in the process downplaying that risks were often, in the end, 
borne by others. Their ability to do so was greatly increased by a trend towards deregulation of 
industries, including ﬁnance. Economic globalization also provided fuel for the crisis, and allowed 
it to spread more rapidly. These factors combined to produce other effects on the character of the 
macroeconomy. These other effects range from growing inequality among the U.S. population, 
to the structure and functioning of large economic institutions, to global trends and issues.

 
UNDERLYING CAUSES OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS 
685
3.1 INEQUALITY
In the three decades before the 2007 crisis, the income gap between rich and poor members 
of the U.S. population widened to levels not seen since the 1920s. During the last two de-
cades of the twentieth century, rising income inequality was mostly due not to real income 
declines for the poor and middle classes but to relative gains for the wealthy. The low and 
middle-income groups were gaining in absolute terms; the problem was merely to keep pace 
with the rich. But starting around 1999, things changed. The median U.S. household income 
began a real decline, signifying that the low and middle classes were now losing in absolute 
terms as well. The majority of U.S. families now faced difﬁculty even maintaining their 
customary level of consumption.
Policymakers could address the growing disconnect between rising consumption 
expectations by the low- and middle-income groups and their decreasing real incomes in 
three ways. The ﬁrst was the “laissez-faire” option of doing nothing and hoping that market 
forces would, over time, diminish income inequality. The second option was to alter the tax 
and spending mix in a way that some income could be either directly or indirectly channeled 
toward the relatively poor. The third option was to encourage credit expansion and set lower 
interest rate targets, in the hope that families who did not otherwise possess sufﬁcient income 
to meet their spending needs might borrow to make up the difference. In practice, policymakers 
rejected the second option of redistributing income in favor of a combination of the ﬁrst and 
third options: do nothing about growing inequality, but facilitate greater borrowing on the 
part of middle-class and low-income families. 
Countless U.S. families—subprime or otherwise—exploited the opportunity to take out 
home equity loans on generous terms. The trend had broad bipartisan support; indeed, many 
policymakers greeted it with optimism rather than skepticism. It seemed to be a clever way of 
addressing the economy’s need for sustained consumer spending while avoiding the thornier 
issue of inequality or unpopular government action.
In the years preceding the crisis, the approach appeared to bear fruit. Consumption 
continued to increase despite declining incomes. Expectation of continued appreciation in 
their home’s value doubtless encouraged families to spend more money than they had. But the 
numbers contained what should have been a warning. In 1980, for example, U.S. households 
held an average debt level equal to about 60 percent of disposable income; in 2007 this ﬁgure 
exceeded 130 percent. As a result, there was a sharp increase in the number of families who 
found themselves unable to continue paying their mortgages. For the many thousands whose 
home values dropped in the subsequent collapse, it often became more economically practical 
to default and face foreclosure than to continue to pay, because the monthly payments would 
continue to reﬂect the original, and often much higher, value of the home.
Lower interest rates during these years undoubtedly fueled the credit expansion. But 
household indebtedness might have ballooned even without such stimulus. A widespread 
perception of falling living standards, largely a consequence of income inequality, was 
probably sufﬁcient to provoke a rapid increase in demand for loans.
3.2 BANK SIZE AND DEREGULATION
Many believe that the immense size of some of the leading U.S. banks was one of the causes 
of the ﬁnancial crisis. There is little question that banks have gotten much bigger and that 
banking sector assets have become more concentrated. Since around 1980, the steadily in-
creasing frequency of bank mergers has led to a growing number of large banks. From 1984 
to 2007, the number of banks with more than $10 billion in assets increased ﬁvefold, from 
24 to 119, and the share of banking sector assets held by large banks increased from 28 to 
more than 75 percent (Figure 30.3). The consolidation continues to this day. In 2012, the 19 
largest banks held more than 60 percent of the assets of the sector, and the six largest of them 
held assets equal to two-thirds of U.S. GDP.

686 
CHAPTER 30 — THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE GREAT RECESSION
Both geographic and sectoral factors contributed to the consolidation. Before the 1980s, 
most states had strict regulations forbidding out-of-state banks from owning subsidiary 
banks within their borders. The point was to impede excessive bank growth. But, beginning 
in 1980, with the Reagan administration’s promotion of a deregulatory agenda, this began 
to change. More states allowed their banks to merge with banks from outside the state. 
In 1994, Congress passed the Riegle-Neal Banking and Branching Efﬁciency Act, which 
effectively sanctioned and strengthened the deregulatory trend already in motion for more 
than a decade.
Another important factor was the sectoral changes that banking deregulation permitted. 
Ever since the Great Depression, customer bank accounts had been protected by the Glass-
Steagall Act (see Chapter 26), which separated commercial and investment banking activities, 
essentially preventing commercial banks from engaging in risky investments and investment 
banks from holding deposits. The separation between the two was gradually eroded through 
the 1980s and 1990s, with the Fed becoming increasingly lenient about which activities 
were permitted for commercial banks. In 1999 the Financial Services Modernization Act 
(FSMA) effectively overturned Glass-Steagall, allowing large ﬁnancial companies to engage 
in commercial and investment banking as well as insurance. This act, perhaps more than any 
other piece of legislation, contributed to the increase in the number of “megabanks,” notable 
among them being Citigroup, the largest ﬁnancial company in the world.
Among other important deregulatory policies were the gradual loosening of restrictions 
on capital across borders, a congressional ban on the regulation of credit default swaps, an 
agreement to allow banks to measure the riskiness of their own products, and increases in the 
amount of leverage permitted to investment banks. Allowing banks greater leverage meant 
that they could borrow huge sums at low rates of interest and invest the borrowed funds in 
the shaky bond products discussed earlier. Deregulation thus magniﬁed the ultimate effects 
of the crisis.

UNDERLYING CAUSES OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS 
687
At the time many argued that the ﬁnancial deregulation trend augured well, claiming that 
large banks are less prone to risk than small ones and therefore have less of a destabilizing 
effect on the economy. A large bank would, for instance, lend to borrowers who are more 
geographically dispersed, thereby making it less vulnerable to locally concentrated defaults. 
Also, according to this argument, a large bank faces less risk because it possesses a greater 
diversity of income sources (e.g., stocks and real estate, in addition to loans) than a traditional 
small bank. Supporters also made so-called economies of scale arguments, stating that a 
larger size would allow a bank to operate more efﬁciently by allowing it to cut costs in 
many areas. On the other side were those who argued that, insofar as such claims were true, 
it meant that only large banks were free to take on offsetting degrees of high risk elsewhere 
by, for example, leveraging highly in order to invest vast sums in potentially risky assets. 
Empirical studies have generally supported the latter claim. In 2013, megabank JPMorgan 
Chase agreed to pay a $13 billion settlement resulting from the bank’s questionable mortgage 
practices leading up to the ﬁnancial crisis.
The principal argument against excessively large banks is related to what is known as “too 
big to fail.” “Too big to fail” does not mean that it is impossible for a large bank to fail; as 
the ﬁnancial crisis made painfully obvious, it is all too possible. What it means is that it is 
possible for an enterprise to grow to such a size that its subsequent failure would harm not 
only the shareholders but also the public at large. 
Large banks count many other large companies among their creditors, so the failure and 
eventual bankruptcy of any one of them could cause a “domino effect,” in which the inability 
of one bank to pay other creditors could jeopardize the ﬁnancial standing of others, with 
potentially catastrophic spillover effects. It was such a fear that prompted federal regulators 
to “bail out” large ﬁnancial companies like Citigroup, Bank of America, and AIG (via 
grants, loans, or assisted mergers). Although many people did not like the idea of the U.S. 
government’s granting so much assistance to failed banks—which had failed due mostly 
to recklessness, not poor fortune—it was generally agreed that the alternative—a potential 
economic collapse—was much worse.
Despite agreeing with the decision, many banking industry critics point out that we would 
not have faced the problem in the ﬁrst place if banks had not been permitted to grow “too 
big.” They argue that after banks (or companies in any sector of our economy) become 
aware that they are “too big,” they have an incentive to take on greater risks, anticipating 
that they will lose very little regardless of the outcome of their ventures. If the ventures 
fail to pay off, the large banks would be ﬁrst in line for government assistance in the form 
of a bailout. The creation of such perverse incentives is what economists refer to as moral 
hazard.
The moral hazard created by “too big to fail” in effect divorced the public’s interests 
from those of the banks, creating a situation in which the pensions or portfolios owned 
by many millions of households suffered large losses while major banks were bailed out. 
In 2008, Congress passed the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which authorized 
the U.S. Treasury to spend as much as $700 billion in loans, stock purchases, and asset 
buyouts for insolvent banks, in addition to earlier loans provided by the Fed. This served 
mostly to assist the “too big” banks; for example, the Treasury spent $220 billion to 
purchase stock from the 19 largest ﬁnancial companies but only $41 billion for all other 
banks.
In its defense, the Treasury pointed out in 2012 that not only had 94 percent of its TARP 
investments been repaid but that the value of those investments had increased by $19 billion. 
Nevertheless, taxpayer money had been used to shoulder $700 billion worth of risk. Although 
the TARP investments turned out favorably this time, the fact that it was even needed vividly 
illustrates the dangers of a banking sector that is “too big to fail.”

CHAPTER 30 — THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE GREAT RECESSION
3.3 MISGUIDED CORPORATE INCENTIVE STRUCTURE
Although the existence of “megabanks” encouraged ﬁnancial risk taking, bank managers 
were facing a changing payment structure that would similarly distort their incentives. Be-
fore the 1990s, compensation for bank chief executive ofﬁcers (CEOs) was mostly unrelated 
to company fortunes. That is, they were generally paid a salary that would grow at a rate 
comparable to that of many other employees. If the company performed especially poorly, 
the CEO might lose his/her job, but otherwise the CEO’s salary remained unaffected by 
company performance.
More recent views, including those taught in business schools, increasingly supported the 
idea that executive compensation packages should include performance incentives. CEO pay 
started to come more in the form of stock options, and bonuses were more frequently tied 
to the company stock value. The rationale for the changes was that they would give CEOs a 
greater incentive to take steps that would ensure a good return for the company shareholders. 
Many believed that rapid growth in the stock value would be a reﬂection of the CEO’s ability 
and understanding of risk.
The new pay structure, however, generated unexpected problems. If CEOs were to be 
evaluated primarily on the basis of company stock price, they would be motivated to focus 
on short-term gains in this area, ignoring long-term risks. They would be compensated 
handsomely—in terms of both the number of stock options and bonus size—if the stock 
price went up, even if the increase was not sustainable. The CEO might well have left the 
company before the long-run damage became evident. In the case of the housing bubble, 
any self-interested CEO could have proﬁted even if he suspected that the rapid increase in 
home prices could not last. The new pay structure created an incentive for gambling on risky 
mortgages. It became apparent only later that such an incentive-based pay structure was 
another example of moral hazard (see Box 30.2).
From 2000 to 2007, the period during which the housing bubble was inﬂating, Lehman 
Brothers (which was to be the sole “megabank” to be allowed to fail during the crisis) and 
Bear Stearns (which also went out of business but was taken over by Bank of America 
BOX 30.2 CEO PAY AND TAX LOOPHOLES
According to a 2012 report by the Institute for Policy 
Studies (IPS), various current tax provisions encour-
age excessive CEO pay. According to the report:
The four most direct tax subsidies for excessive 
executive pay cost taxpayers an estimated $14.4 
billion per year—$46 for every American man, 
woman, and child. That amount could also cover 
the annual cost of hiring 211,732 elementary-
school teachers, or provide Pell Grants of $5,500 
to 2,591,021 college students.
The largest of these tax provisions relates to a 
company’s ability to claim a tax deduction for ex-
ecutive pay. A 1993 law limits this deduction to $1 
million annually for direct compensation, but there 
are no deductibility limits placed on “performance-
based” pay in the form of stock options. In 2011 
Larry Ellison, the CEO of Oracle, received more 
than $76 million in performance-based pay, and 
the company did not have to pay any federal taxes 
on this amount.
Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of 
California, has introduced legislation, the Income 
Equity Act (HR 382), that would limit a company’s 
ability to deduct CEO pay to 25 times the salary of 
the company’s lowest-paid worker. Her bill would 
not limit the amount that a company could pay its 
CEO, just the amount that would be tax deductible. 
The bill “would encourage corporations to raise 
pay at the bottom of the corporate pay ladder. The 
greater the pay for a company’s lowest-paid worker, 
the higher the tax-deductible pay for the company’s 
highest-paid executives.”

under pressure from the Fed, thereby technically avoiding bankruptcy) paid their CEOs $61 
million and $87 million respectively in bonuses, with both citing unprecedented increases 
in their stock price as justiﬁcation. These CEOs also earned $461 million and $289 million 
respectively from exercising their stock options during this time. During this period, the 
companies were engaging in the unsustainable borrowing that would lead to their collapse. 
By the time the game was up in 2007, and the share prices plummeted, the CEOs had already 
become immensely wealthy and were under no obligation to return the funds.
It may not be self-evident why shareholders would allow for such a skewed incentive 
structure if it actually threatened their share values. Could it be that the inherent moral 
hazard in such a pay structure did not occur to anyone? It is highly unlikely. The fact is that 
shareholders in major companies do not actually possess much inﬂuence over CEOs. The 
boards of directors of companies have historically acted, in theory at least, on behalf of 
shareholders. And one “action” is determining CEO compensation.
In practice, and especially in recent years, company boards tend to be more aligned with 
CEO interests than with those of the shareholders whom they are presumed to represent. 
In some companies, CEOs hold sway over board members’ compensation and re-election 
prospects, generating an incentive for “mutual favors.” Moreover, many bank CEOs sit on 
the boards of other banks, providing ample opportunity for board members to cater to CEO 
interests, and vice versa. Therefore it should be no surprise that some CEOs were allowed 
to proﬁt greatly from short-term growth, to the cost of not only shareholders but also the 
population at large.
3.4 GLOBALIZATION AND LONG-TERM ECONOMIC TRENDS
Events originating outside the United States also contributed to the ﬁnancial crisis. First, the 
progressive globalization of labor markets took its toll on U.S. workers. Beginning around 
the late 1960s, the United States started to rely more on foreign countries (e.g., China and 
Mexico) for production of consumer goods, because these countries, which pay a far lower 
average wage, could produce them at a lower price. We noted in Chapter 22 that the U.S. 
manufacturing sector has been in decline from about this time, and in Chapter 23 that real 
wages in the United States have failed to keep up with gains in productivity since the 1970s. 
This trend was facilitated by a gradual weakening of labor unions. In the mid-1960s, about 
one-third of all employees were in a labor union; today only about 12 percent of public sector 
workers are, and 7 percent in the private sector.
While globalization also brought signiﬁcant advantages to the United States (as noted in 
Chapters 28 and 29), the distribution of the gains and losses tended to reinforce the growing 
pattern of inequality discussed above. This put pressure on struggling middle-class and low-
income families to take on more debt. As we have outlined, easy credit access made going 
into debt a seemingly attractive option, and as long as house prices were rising, the illusion of 
increasing wealth encouraged taking on large mortgages. Household debt outstanding, mostly 
mortgage or credit card debt, rose to 98 percent of GDP by 2007. This allowed American 
families to live beyond their means, until the 2008 crisis forced massive retrenchment.
Another factor was the persistent U.S. current account deﬁcits. Although the United States 
did not consistently import more than it exported until the mid-1980s, from then on the current 
account grew ever more unbalanced. The deﬁcit increased from about 1 percent of GDP in 
1990 to 6 percent in 2006, causing a massive inﬂow of foreign money that, as we saw in 
Chapter 29, is necessary to keep international ﬁnancial ﬂows “in balance.” The ﬂood of foreign 
money was invested in a variety of U.S. assets, intensifying the asset price inﬂation that was 
already occurring. Some of it was used to purchase Treasury bonds, but much of it ﬁnanced 
borrowing by U.S. homeowners or was directly invested in stocks, MBSs, and CDOs.
One major consequence of the foreign savings inﬂow was that it reinforced the lowering 
of interest rates. Recalling the classical model of the loanable funds market ﬁrst discussed in 

690 
CHAPTER 30 — THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE GREAT RECESSION
Chapter 24, the inﬂow substantially increased supply (a rightward shift of the supply curve), 
thereby leading to a reduction in the interest rate. We have already seen that low interest rates 
can potentially induce an increase in the level of real domestic investment, which historically 
leads to healthy economic growth and domestic employment. But lower interest rates can 
also play a decisive role in inﬂating bubbles by fueling consumption and provoking excessive 
leveraging for purposes of ﬁnancial speculation. In the case of the foreign inﬂows resulting 
from U.S. current account deﬁcits, it is not possible to know whether they would have been 
sufﬁcient, on their own, to produce a ﬁnancial bubble in the United States, but we do know 
that they played an important role.
By the time the housing bubble was close to bursting, the ﬁnancial sector had been 
deregulated to an extent not seen since before the Great Depression. Globalization only served 
to reinforce the inﬂation of the bubble. Movement of capital by investment banks and hedge 
funds across borders is only lightly regulated. So the problems discussed earlier, in which 
there was inadequate oversight of bank investments and loans—and of the management of 
risk—were magniﬁed because there was no such oversight at all when it came to capital 
investments from overseas. Because foreign investors were parking their excess funds in the 
U.S. ﬁnancial system (recall that they had these funds in no small part as a result of years of 
trade surpluses with the United States), investment banks and hedge funds possessed more 
capital with which to take on more risk and more debt (with historically low interest rates 
serving as another incentive), in order to multiply their returns.
How did ﬁnance come to play such an important role in the economy? One possible explanation 
is that the steady decline in U.S. manufacturing made it increasingly difﬁcult to obtain an attractive 
return on investments in companies that were manufacturing real products. This downward trend 
may, at least in part, explain the proliferation of arcane ﬁnancial products, as discussed earlier. 
Because expected returns in industry were relatively low, many ﬁnancial investments seemed 
to promise attractive returns (if only in the short run). As we have seen, bubbles are inﬂated 
when investors desperate for high returns sink their money into assets with highly questionable 
foundations, causing their price to rise rapidly, which in turn draws in further investors.
Discussion Questions
1. Have you seen anything in the news in recent weeks about the regulation of banking 
and ﬁnance? Do you think, in general, that it is a good idea to allow banks and ﬁnancial 
institutions to conduct their business with minimal government interference? Why or 
why not?
2. Did the ﬁnancial crisis mostly have to do with banks? Homebuyers? International eco-
nomics? What do you think is the most important factor that explains it?
4. REMEDIES AND IDEAS FOR AVERTING FUTURE CRISES
The ﬁnancial crisis called for both short- and long-term responses. Many believe that it was 
critical, in the short term, to restore at least some semblance of stability to the ﬁnancial sys-
tem, lest it collapse and bring the broader economy down with it. This urgent need prompted 
the government to act, by bailing out the institutions deemed most systemically important to 
the health of the economy and by instituting a “stimulus” program of federal spending. The 
Fed joined in as well, actively purchasing not only Treasury bonds but also securities such as 
MBSs through its “quantitative easing” program (as discussed in Chapter 27). 
After the worst had been averted, attention turned to the long-term question—how to 
prevent future ﬁnancial crises. This is a more difﬁcult issue. One possible solution is to 
reverse, at least partially, some of the ﬁnancial deregulation that helped lead to the crisis. 
Many have supported calls for more regulation of the ﬁnancial sector, and some reforms have 
been implemented, although there has been opposition both from some who think that they 
go too far and from others who believe that they do not go far enough.

 
REMEDIES AND IDEAS FOR AVERTING FUTURE CRISES 
691
4.1 FISCAL AND MONETARY RESPONSES
After the emergency measures taken to forestall a complete economic collapse in late 2008, 
there remained the task of stimulating the economy, especially with the goal of creating rapid job 
growth. To this end, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), an 
$831 billion government-spending bill. Whether the amount was big enough or too big remains 
an open question. But independent analysts estimate that ARRA created between 1.5 million and 
7.9 million new jobs from 2009 to 2012. Nevertheless, employment growth remained lackluster 
through 2013, with the unemployment rate remaining above 7 percent. 
Moreover, as we have seen, when the government ramps up spending without a 
corresponding tax increase, the result is a swelling deﬁcit, increasing the overall national 
debt. Some critics contend that this policy will lead to even greater problems in the long term 
(we review the issue of deﬁcits and debt in Chapter 31). But one indisputable consequence 
of the crisis, and the bill that followed, is that Keynesian economics once again became an 
important inﬂuence in U.S. policy-making.
While the federal government was rapidly boosting spending, many state and local 
governments were doing the precise opposite. The drop in household income resulting from 
mass layoffs and stagnant wages meant that state and local governments could collect less 
tax revenue, resulting in the sharpest drop in state tax revenue in U.S. history. State budget 
deﬁcits ballooned, peaking at a total of $191 billion in 2010 and remaining high at $55 billion 
even for ﬁscal year 2013.
You may recall from Chapter 25 that while the federal deﬁcit often seeks to stabilize the 
macroeconomy by pursuing countercyclical policy (i.e., deﬁcit spending when times are bad, 
budget balance or surplus* when the economy recovers), states and municipalities—mostly 
because they are not empowered to create their own money—do the exact opposite. States 
did receive federal assistance as part of ARRA, but it covered only about 40 percent of 
their budget shortfalls from 2009 to 2011. To make up the rest, by 2012 46 states had cut 
spending on services while 30 states had increased taxes. Although ﬁscally prudent, both 
policies countervail economic recovery efforts, and some analysts estimate that these “anti-
Keynesian” state policies have cost U.S. workers more than 4 million jobs from 2009 to 2012, 
undercutting the reported job gains from the federal stimulus program.
In the area of monetary policy, the Fed embarked on a stimulus plan that is unprecedented 
in nature. Immediately after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, the Fed purchased 
billions of dollars’ worth of shaky assets, including mortgage-backed securities that had lost 
the majority of their value. The result was that the assets on its balance sheet jumped from 
about $950 billion in 2007 to more than $2.5 trillion in 2008.**
As discussed in Chapter 27, Fed purchases of securities effectively increase the money 
supply, because holding more reserves enables banks to offer more loans to the public. The 
principal difference between quantitative easing and open market operations is that while the 
latter involves the purchase of government Treasury bonds, the former means that the Fed is 
buying distressed assets. As of early 2013, the Fed’s asset holdings approached $3 trillion, with 
a signiﬁcant fraction uncharacteristically invested in assets of questionable value. In the fall 
of 2012, Fed chair Ben Bernanke announced the third round of quantitative easing (dubbed 
QE3), through which the Fed committed to purchasing $40 billion in MBSs per month.
These expansionary monetary policies had a major effect in promoting economic 
recovery, including in the housing market (see Box 30.3). But employing monetary policy 
to stimulate the economy has limitations; as noted earlier, one could ﬂood the economy with 
money, but if consumers and businesses remain pessimistic, the existence of more money 
does not necessarily lead to increases in consumption or investment. Despite the Fed’s very 
 *Or at least smaller deﬁcits, facilitated by rising tax revenues.
**In “quantitative easing,” the Fed purchases MBSs from banks and credits them with fresh reserves.

692 
CHAPTER 30 — THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE GREAT RECESSION
expansionary policies, banks remain fairly reluctant to lend their excess reserves, except to 
their most creditworthy borrowers.
In addition, some fear that the Fed, through its efforts, is inadvertently inﬂating a new 
bubble. Wall Street, for example, appears ebullient at the efforts of both the ﬁscal and monetary 
authorities to reverse the economic decline; stock indexes rose to record levels in 2013. At 
the same time, there was a rush into “junk bonds”—corporate bonds considered at moderate 
to high risk of default—because of their relatively high interest rates. And we should not 
forget that sustained low interest rates are always an invitation for speculators to leverage 
their investment positions inexpensively, as some have returned to doing.
4.2 THE DODD-FRANK BILL 
The deregulation that preceded the ﬁnancial crisis had been developed over many decades. 
Starting in the 1980s, many government regulations that had been in place for decades 
were eliminated. The premise for deregulation was the belief that companies would beneﬁt 
from less government intrusion in their affairs and that the broader economy would gain 
from an improvement in investment incentives. As we have noted, important deregula-
tory legislation, such as the Financial Services Modernization Act—which effectively 
overturned Glass-Steagall—were adopted, generally with bipartisan support, during the 
1990s and 2000s.
But in late 2008 the political atmosphere changed rather abruptly. Suddenly, a clamor 
arose for regulatory reform to protect Americans from the recklessness of the ﬁnancial sector, 
which only intensiﬁed after the ﬁrst recipients of government assistance were revealed to be 
BOX 30.3 HOUSING PRICES HEADED BACK UP
Although Figure 30.1 shows housing prices declin-
ing from their 2006 peak, more recent data indicate 
that housing prices are headed back up. Over the 
12 months from March 2012 to February 2013, 
the Case-Shiller index of housing prices was up 
9.3 percent. That was the biggest 12-month gain 
in the index since May 2006, shortly after the index 
indicated record-high home prices.
The index showed a 12-month decline in prices 
almost every month over a ﬁve-year period 
through May 2012. But every month since then 
has shown a gain in home prices, and each 
month’s gain has been stronger than the one 
that came before. “Despite some recent mixed 
economic reports for March, housing continues 
to be one of the brighter spots in the economy,” 
said David Blitzer, chairman of the index com-
mittee at S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
While rising housing prices are a sign of an 
economic recovery, some economists worry that 
the recent rapid rise in home prices could be prob-
lematic. Stan Humphries, chief economist for real 
estate Web site Zillow, said that “regardless what 
data you look at, home values are clearly rising at 
an unsustainable pace.”
Mike Larson, real estate analyst at Weiss 
Research, said he’s concerned that much of the 
increase is being driven by investors ﬂooding into 
some markets to buy homes in order to rent them 
out, outbidding the potential homeowners who 
want to live in a home. “Prices are not at bub-
blicious levels, but you’re talking about a trend 
that can be destabilizing,” he said.
The biggest increase in housing prices was in 
Phoenix, AZ, a city particularly hard-hit during the 
ﬁnancial crisis, where prices increased by 23 per-
cent. Some neighborhoods in the city saw housing 
prices rise by 40 percent. According to Dean Baker, 
codirector of the Center for Economic and Policy 
Research, these dramatic price increases were being 
driven by speculators. He noted that in the housing 
markets most hurt by the bursting of the housing 
bubble, there was a danger that new bubbles will 
form. “The end of this round of speculation is not 
likely to be much prettier for the areas affected than 
the end of the last round,” he said.

REMEDIES AND IDEAS FOR AVERTING FUTURE CRISES

the ﬁnancial companies themselves. The principal change arising from the call for reform 
was the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), 
cosponsored by Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Representative Barney Frank (D-MA), 
which seeks to address many of the causes of the ﬁnancial crisis.
First, Dodd-Frank addresses the deteriorating lending standards that encouraged subprime 
loans and pumped air into the housing bubble. The legislation requires that ﬁnancial companies 
that seek to lend money to prospective homeowners use minimum criteria (related to, e.g., 
credit history and income and debt levels) to determine whether the candidate for a mortgage 
can reasonably be expected to repay.
The law also seeks to put a halt to so-called predatory lending, which was increasingly 
common in the last years of the housing bubble. Predatory lending describes the practice 
in which ﬁnancial companies target individuals whom they know are unlikely to repay 
a mortgage. Dodd-Frank creates a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (www.
consumerﬁnance.gov/) that protects vulnerable borrowers but also monitors loosely regulated 
lenders known for predatory practices. In July 2013, the Bureau became fully operational 
with the appointment of a permanent director.
Another key feature of Dodd-Frank is that it directly confronts the moral hazard 
inherent in the ﬁnancial system and its pay structure. In order to reduce the extent to which 
commercial banks transfer risk to investment banks through the use of MBSs and other 
securities, the legislation requires commercial banks to be exposed to a minimum amount 
of the mortgage default risk. Dodd-Frank, moreover, puts restrictions on CDSs, requiring 
companies that seek to insure senior tranches of MBSs or CDOs to post more collateral to 
back up their value. 
In addressing corporate pay structure, Dodd-Frank calls for the Securities and Exchange 
Commission to ensure that corporate board members who determine CEO compensation do 
not have private interests in the company that might give them an incentive to favor higher 
CEO pay over broad shareholder interests. 
Dodd-Frank also takes on ratings agencies like Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s, the 
companies that rate a great variety of debt and debt-related securities to give investors a clear 
picture of the riskiness of the asset. The new legislation requires the agencies to disclose 
the method used to rate each security, in hopes of increasing transparency for investors. It 
partially addresses conﬂict of interest concerns stemming from the fact that the agencies are 
regularly paid by the banks that they rate, possibly creating an incentive to understate the 
risk of certain securities. Nevertheless, Dodd-Frank does not prohibit ratings agencies from 
being paid by the ﬁrms that they rate.
The legislation also limits the amount of leverage permitted to large ﬁnancial ﬁrms. 
As noted earlier, the instability leading to the crisis was magniﬁed by the fact that ﬁrms 
were allowed to borrow amounts so high that they intensiﬁed the artiﬁcial rise in asset  
prices.
Perhaps most important, the Dodd-Frank bill takes on the issue of “too big to fail.” It 
uses the designation “systemically important” for ﬁnancial companies that hold assets in 
excess of $50 billion (of which there are currently almost 40) and subjects them to Fed-
imposed restrictions on their activities that are more stringent than those faced by smaller 
ﬁrms. The law also seeks to restrict further growth. For example, it forbids any merger that 
allows a single ﬁrm to hold more than 10 percent of the liabilities of the entire ﬁnancial  
sector. 
4.3 BEYOND DODD-FRANK
Like most historic pieces of legislation, the Dodd-Frank bill has received no shortage of 
criticism. A familiar argument against it is one that is commonly heard about regulation in 

694 
CHAPTER 30 — THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE GREAT RECESSION
general: that the bill creates signiﬁcant costs for ﬁnancial ﬁrms, slowing down business and 
job creation. Another point of criticism is that the legislation is too complex, perhaps even 
contradictory.
A third argument made against Dodd-Frank is that it has been “watered down” to a great 
extent by intense lobbying efforts by the ﬁnancial industry itself—suggesting, in effect, that 
the regulators are under the inﬂuence of the regulated. One salient example supporting this 
claim is the fact that, in 2012, regulators decided that new CDS regulations would not apply 
to ﬁrms that sell less than $8 billion in CDSs per year. Because of this change, which was 
a direct result of pressure from the ﬁnance lobby, the overwhelming majority of companies 
are exempt from CDS regulations.
As of late 2013, only 40 percent of the rules provided for in Dodd-Frank had been 
adopted in ﬁnal form. In the process, a number of them had been watered down or 
eliminated due to pressure from the ﬁnancial industry. Dodd-Frank also encountered 
problems globally, as foreign countries protested aspects that affected their ﬁnancial 
companies.
Opposition to Dodd-Frank is not, however, limited to Wall Street. Although much of 
the public favors reform and greater regulation of the ﬁnancial industry, many remain 
opposed to or at least highly skeptical of Dodd-Frank. Polls indicate that nearly half the 
U.S. population believes that the legislation would do more to protect the ﬁnancial industry 
than consumers. 
In order to go beyond Dodd-Frank, we must ask not merely how to regulate ﬁnance, 
but also how to redirect ﬁnance to the goal of increasing overall beneﬁts to society. One 
obvious way would be to reverse course in the direction of smaller and more specialized 
banks, along the lines of the Glass-Steagall Act. Free market principles align with the idea 
that banks should be “small enough to fail.” In other words, market competition should 
weed out the weak or inferior banks, and in the process the banking system would be made 
more robust.
A system based on small banks would highlight the important economic role that they 
already play. Despite holding barely 10 percent of total banking sector assets, small banks 
provide more than one-third of all small business loans in the United States. This is a critically 
important service, because small businesses have created over two-thirds of new jobs in the 
United States since the early 1990s. 
Such a change, in effect a return to traditional banking, would require addressing the heavy 
inﬂuence in government that is arguably responsible for the deregulation in the ﬁrst place: the 
veritable “revolving door” through which some of the “big players” in ﬁnance subsequently 
take on important government posts, and vice-versa. Attempts to block this door have included 
proposed requirements that individuals must wait a signiﬁcant number of years between the 
time that they leave a government position in which they can affect legislation on industry 
sectors and when they begin to work in those sectors.
Another means of redirecting ﬁnance to serve society would be to ask investors to pay 
a modest tax each time that they complete a ﬁnancial transaction. Keynes proposed such a 
tax in 1936—at a time when the role of ﬁnance vis-à-vis the real economy was minuscule 
compared to today—as a way of discouraging the short-term speculation that makes the 
price of company stock highly volatile. Decades later, another prominent economist, the 
Nobel laureate James Tobin, also argued that ﬁnancial transactions, particularly currency 
trades, should be taxed. His idea was that each transaction be taxed at a low rate, but that 
speculators would end up paying much more than long-term investors because they buy 
and sell securities much more frequently. Today, the term “Tobin tax” is used to refer to any 
proposed ﬁnancial transaction tax.
Studies estimate that a ﬁnancial transactions tax of a fraction of a percentage point would 
generate billions of dollars in revenue. The European Commission has adopted a tax on all 
stock, bond, and derivative trading in the European Union beginning in 2014, and Canada

has passed legislation that proposes to implement a Tobin tax if enough other countries agree 
to participate.
In future, the ﬁnancial sector will continue to be the focus of an extensive debate about 
regulation, transparency, and the political power of large ﬁnancial institutions. Economic theory 
cannot provide deﬁnitive answers to these questions, but as this chapter has shown, many 
of the macroeconomic analyses that we have developed are very relevant to understanding 
and evaluating these issues.

31 Deﬁcits and Debt
You may have seen the national debt clock in New York City that continually shows how much 
our debt is increasing by the second. The total amount of the debt, which exceeds $16 trillion, 
seems very large. But what does it mean? To whom do we owe all this money? Is it a serious 
problem? Should we care about government debt when the economy has yet to recover from 
the ﬁnancial crisis? Is it possible for the United States to stop borrowing? This chapter goes 
into detail in answering these questions and even considers some possible ways to reverse the 
trend. But ﬁrst we provide some historical context to the notion of a national debt.
1. DEFICITS AND THE NATIONAL DEBT
Perhaps because the two terms sound so much alike, many people confuse the government’s 
deﬁcit with the government debt. But the two “D words” are very different. The deﬁcit totaled 
$1.1 trillion in ﬁscal 2012, while total federal debt exceeded $16 trillion at the end of ﬁscal 2012. 
The reason the second number is much larger than the ﬁrst is that the debt represents deﬁcits 
accumulated over many years. In economists’ terms, we can say that the government deﬁcit is 
a ﬂow variable while its debt is a stock variable. (See Chapter 1 for this distinction.)
The government’s debt rises when the government runs a deﬁcit and falls when it runs 
a surplus.* Figure 31.1 shows some recent data on the government’s debt, measured as a 
percentage of GDP. The two lines on the graph indicate the total government debt and the 
part of government debt held by the public (as opposed to debt held by government agencies). 
After hitting a high of more than 100 percent of GDP during World War II, the debt generally 
declined as a percentage of GDP until 1980. It rose somewhat before 1996, then fell until 
2000. Since 2000 the debt has risen, with a particularly sharp increase in the years following 
the 2007–9 recession.
What is the impact on the economy of government debt? One commonly expressed view 
of the government’s debt is that it represents a burden on future generations of citizens. There 
is some truth to this assertion, but it is also somewhat misleading. It implicitly compares the 
government’s debt to the debt of a private citizen. Certainly, if you personally accumulated 
a huge debt, it would not be a good thing for your ﬁnancial future. But government debt is 
different in some important ways.
First, about half of government debt is, directly or indirectly, owed to U.S. citizens. When 
people own Treasury bills (T-bills), Treasury notes, or Treasury bonds, they own government 
*Although the arithmetic requires that the debt rise when the government is in deﬁcit—because the only way to ﬁnance 
a deﬁcit is to borrow money—in the case of a surplus it is possible for the government to hold some funds in reserve, for 
example, to ﬁnance future expenditures. It is usually the case, however, that governments will use some or all of a surplus to 
reduce existing debt.

698 
CHAPTER 31 — DEFICITS AND DEBT
IOUs. From their point of view, the government debt is an asset, a form of wealth. If your 
grandmother gives you a U.S. Savings Bond, she is giving you a beneﬁt, not a burden. These 
assets are some of the safest ones that you can own.
Second, government debt does not have to be paid off. Old debt can be “rolled over,” that 
is, replaced by new debt. Provided that the size of the debt does not grow too quickly, the 
government’s credit is good—there will always be people interested in buying and holding 
government bonds. Most economists use the rule of thumb that as long as the rate of increase 
in government’s debt is not signiﬁcantly greater than that of GDP for several years in a row, 
it does not represent a severe problem for the economy. As Figure 31.1 shows, following the 
2007–9 recession, persistently large deﬁcits have caused the debt to rise much more rapidly 
than GDP in recent years. Nonetheless, the debt is still at a lower level relative to GDP than 
it was immediately after World War II, which was followed by nearly two decades of relative 
economic prosperity.
Third, the U.S. government pays interest in U.S. dollars. A country such as Argentina 
that owes money to other countries and must pay interest in a foreign currency (the U.S. 
dollar) can get into big trouble and go bankrupt. But it is much easier to manage a debt that 
is denominated in your own currency. Even if some of the debt is owed to foreigners, the 
United States does not have to obtain foreign currency to pay it. And so long as foreigners 
are willing to continue holding U.S. government bonds, it will not be necessary to pay it at 
all—instead, the debt can be rolled over as new bonds replace old ones.
But this should not encourage us to believe that government debt is never a concern. 
Rising debt creates several signiﬁcant problems. First, interest must be paid on the debt. 
This means that a larger share of future budgets must be devoted to paying interest, leaving 
less for other needs. It is also true that the largest holders of government bonds tend to 
be wealthier people, so most of the interest paid by the government goes to better-off 
individuals. If this payment is not counteracted by changes in the tax system, it encourages 
growing income inequality. It also creates a problem of generational equity—future 
taxpayers will have to pay more interest because of government borrowing today. It is a 
burden on future generations in that debt ﬁnance detracts from other important functions 
that the government could be performing.
A second problem is that in recent years an increasing proportion of the debt has been 
borrowed from governments, corporations, and individuals in foreign countries (Figure 31.2). 
The interest payments on this portion of the debt must be made to those outside the country. 
That means that the United States must earn enough income from exports and other sources to 
pay not only for imports but also for interest payments to the rest of the world. Alternatively,

the country could borrow more, but it is best to avoid this solution, since it would just make 
the overall foreign debt problem larger in the long run.
Large foreign holdings of debt also pose another problem—what if those foreign debt 
holders decided to sell the U.S. bonds that they own? In that case, the government might 
have trouble ﬁnding enough people who are willing to hold government bonds (that is, lend 
money to the government). This could cause interest rates to rise sharply, which in turn would 
push the government budget further into deﬁcit.
The question “Is government debt worth it?” can be answered only if we consider what that 
debt is used to ﬁnance. In this respect, an analogy to personal or business debt is appropriate. 
Most people—including economists—do not reject consumer and corporate debt. Rather, 
our judgment about debt depends on the beneﬁts received.
For example, if debt is accumulated for gambling, it is a bad idea. If the bet does not pay 
off, then it is very difﬁcult to pay the interest on the debt (not to mention the principal). But if 
the government borrows to pay for intelligently planned investment, it can be very beneﬁcial. 
If the investment leads to economic growth, the government’s ability to collect tax revenue 
is enhanced. This kind of borrowing can pay for itself, as long as the investment is not for 
wasteful “pork barrel” spending, poorly planned or unnecessary projects, and so on. Recalling 
our earlier discussion of the opportunity cost of government borrowing at full employment, 
the interest-generating capacity of the proposed project is certainly an important—though 
not the only—consideration.
Even if the debt ﬁnances current spending, it can be justiﬁable if it is seen as necessary to 
maintain or protect valuable aspects of life. Most people would not be opposed to borrowing 
to pay for cleanup after a natural disaster (e.g., in January 2013 Congress appropriated $60 
billion in relief funds for Hurricane Sandy relief) or to contain a deadly pandemic. How about 
for military spending? Opinions differ about whether particular defense expenditures are 
necessary to maintain or protect valuable aspects of life. But wasteful spending, or spending 
on unwise defense policies, constitutes a drag on more productive economic activity (as 
suggested by the production-possibilities curve “guns-versus-butter” analysis introduced in 
Chapter 1).
The management of debt involves standard principles of wise stewardship of ﬁnances. 
When we apply them to government deﬁcits and debt, we need to weigh the economic beneﬁts 
of different spending and tax policies.

CHAPTER 31 — DEFICITS AND DEBT
Discussion Questions
1. What is the difference between the deﬁcit and the national debt? How are they related?
2. “The national debt is a huge burden on our economy.” How would you evaluate this 
statement?
2. THE U.S. NATIONAL DEBT: A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
2.1 TWO CENTURIES OF DEFICITS AND DEBT
Deﬁcit ﬁnancing has been part of U.S. history from the very beginning. The Continental 
Congress put the country into debt in order to continue its ﬁght for independence from Great 
Britain. As is done today, Congress issued bonds in order to ﬁnance the country’s war effort. 
There was considerable controversy after the war regarding the role of the new federal gov-
ernment in absorbing the debts incurred by individual states. Alexander Hamilton, secretary 
of the Treasury under George Washington, was prominent among those who believed that, 
by introducing greater ﬂexibility into the money supply, a national debt had the potential to 
strengthen the economy and the country. Despite opposition from other political leaders—
John Adams and Thomas Jefferson among them—Hamilton helped set in motion a process 
through which the federal government regularly relied on debt to ﬁnance its operations.
After the United States became independent from Great Britain, its federal government 
generally repaid its debts fairly quickly. The War of 1812, however, proved very costly, and 
the national debt approached 15 percent of national income by 1816. In the nineteenth and 
early twentieth centuries, it was mostly wars that depleted the government’s ﬁnances. The 
Civil War was especially costly—the debt approached 40 percent of total national income at 
its peak—but the Mexican-American and Spanish-American wars also added to the national 
debt. By 1900 it had fallen below 5 percent of total GDP, but the budget deﬁcits during World 
War I again pushed the national debt beyond 40 percent of GDP.
In terms of its effect on government ﬁnances, the Great Depression of the 1930s was truly 
a watershed. The economic crisis ultimately led to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New 
Deal social programs. From that point on, federal spending on social programs—in addition to 
continued military spending—has ﬁgured prominently in the total debt ﬁgures. Consequently, 
since 1931 the U.S. federal budget has been in surplus only seven years, compared with the 
years from independence until then, during which surpluses were seen twice as frequently 
as deﬁcits. National debt in relation to income rose signiﬁcantly during the 1930s, but it 
was World War II that had an even greater impact. Because consumer goods were rationed, 
savings accumulated, and people used them to purchase U.S. war bonds (a form of debt), 
which helped ﬁnance U.S. participation in World War II. After the war, the national debt 
totaled an unprecedented 122 percent of GDP (Figure 31.1).
2.2 “SUPPLY-SIDE” ECONOMICS
After World War II, as noted, the debt generally declined as a percentage of GDP until 1980. 
The national debt was just over $900 billion in 1981, but rose by nearly $2 trillion during the 
next eight years. In other words, over those eight years the country incurred twice as much 
debt as it had in its ﬁrst 200 years! How did this happen?
Ronald Reagan’s 1980 presidential campaign leaned heavily on the principles of “supply-
side” economics, which promised that offering more beneﬁts and incentives to the individuals 
and groups that held the most wealth and productive capital would stimulate rapid investment 
growth and job creation. According to this principle, tax cuts would pay for themselves 
through greater revenues from an expanded economy. 
The major policy experiment with supply-side economics was the Economic Recovery Act 
(ERA, 1981), which cut income and corporate tax rates, substantially reducing government 

 
THE DEBT AND ITS LINKS TO FINANCE 
701
revenues. At the same time, military spending increased in the 1980s. Consequently, the annual 
budget deﬁcit, which had been 2.7 percent of GDP in 1980, grew to an annual average of 
4 percent during the Reagan presidency. True, a portion of the increase was due to cyclical 
factors, speciﬁcally an unusually deep recession in 1981–82. Most of it, however, resulted 
from the failure of supply-side economics to produce the revenue growth that was needed 
to make up for the tax cut.
2.3 1989 TO THE PRESENT
In absolute terms, the national debt continued to grow after Reagan left ofﬁce, despite the fact 
that by then public awareness of the government’s ﬁscal problems had grown. In an attempt 
to address the persistent deﬁcits, President George H.W. Bush raised tax rates slightly and 
signed a bill in 1990 requiring that all spending increases be matched by either decreases in 
spending in other areas or tax increases, in a system known as PAYGO (“pay as you go”). 
Despite the introduction of that system, another recession (1990–91) and the ﬁrst Iraq war 
kept deﬁcits in the range of 4 percent of GDP annually. It also did not help matters that siz-
able sums had to be used to bail out many savings and loan banks that collapsed due to losses 
from risky and ill-conceived real estate investments (a precursor of the real estate bubble of 
the twenty-ﬁrst century). In 1992 the national debt was $4 trillion.
Bush’s PAYGO policy was continued under the administration of Bill Clinton. Congress again 
raised income tax rates, and the end of the cold war allowed the federal government to lower military 
expenditures (relative to GDP, although not in absolute terms), a side beneﬁt often referred to as a 
“peace dividend.” At the same time, the economy emerged from recession and began a period of 
sustained growth. The resulting movement from the trough to the peak of the business cycle from 
1992 to 2000 generated surpluses in the overall federal budget from 1998 to 2001, a feat that had 
not been achieved since 1969. This period of budget surpluses, however, was short-lived.
During the presidency of George W. Bush (2001–9), a combination of recession, tax rate 
cuts, and increased military expenditures pushed the budget back into deﬁcit and caused the 
debt to increase further. By 2008 the debt totaled almost 70 percent of GDP.
The ﬁrst Obama administration (2008–13) was spent dealing with the worst recession since 
the 1930s. During this period, annual deﬁcits averaged 8.7 percent of GDP, and the national 
debt rose to just over 100 percent of GDP, as the government deployed a $787 billion ﬁscal 
policy package to keep the 2007–9 recession from turning into a full-ﬂedged depression. 
Tax revenue fell sharply, from $2.5 trillion in 2008 to $2.1 trillion in 2009. As is normal 
in a recession, expenditures increased due to automatic stabilizers (see Chapter 25). The 
combination of these factors with continued military expenses in Iraq and Afghanistan led 
to record deﬁcits of more than $1 trillion. In 2012 the deﬁcit began to decline, with further 
declines projected, but the national debt overall increased to more than $16 billion.
Discussion Questions
1. Has the U.S. federal government ever had a budget surplus? When was the last time? Was 
there ever a time that the government was not in debt?
2. What causes budget deﬁcits? Are budget deﬁcits necessarily a bad thing?
3. THE DEBT AND ITS LINKS TO FINANCE
3.1 TAXONOMY OF DEBT TYPES
In the popular press, one encounters different estimates of the country’s debt, which can vary 
considerably. By some estimates, U.S. total debt now approximates 350 percent of GDP. Some 
confusion has been caused by differing terminology relating to the debt, so it may be helpful 
to distinguish between different categories.

702 
CHAPTER 31 — DEFICITS AND DEBT
Usually, the term “national debt” refers to the gross federal debt, which is actually the 
total debt outstanding for the federal government (Table 31.1) and is the debt to which we 
have referred until now. It is not, however, the same as the public debt. The gross federal 
debt includes money that the federal government “borrows” from other government accounts. 
Prominent examples include Social Security and Medicare, which, as noted earlier, are 
classiﬁed as “off budget.” Basically, when the government collects more in tax revenue for 
these programs than it pays out, it realizes an off-budget surplus. It is then in a position to 
“borrow” the surplus, or at least a portion of it, as an alternative to borrowing money from 
the public. So it is the public debt, not the gross federal debt, that is a direct consequence of 
federal budget deﬁcits.

Recall that the Federal Reserve is an active participant in the market for U.S. bonds, as it 
buys and sells them to conduct its open market operations in hopes of inﬂuencing interest rates. 
So the Fed also holds a signiﬁcant share of the federal debt. Its share is also a part of the public 
debt. The difference between the public debt and the debt held by the public (this terminology 
is unfortunately confusing, but we need to learn it!) is the debt held by the Fed.
One ﬁnal distinction is between the internal debt and the external debt. The internal 
debt refers to the portion of the gross federal debt that is owned by individuals or groups 
within the country, and the external debt represents the portion held by foreigners or 
foreign groups.
Like the federal government, state and municipal governments also often rely on borrowing 
to fund their operations. They issue a variety of bond instruments to acquire funds from 
the public, which in a sense add to the country’s total indebtedness. This is also a point of 
frequent confusion. In its common usage, the term “national debt” usually refers only to 
the federal portion of the debt. This seems reasonable, because it is the debt that is directly 
related to ﬁscal policy and how it affects the national economy. Yet if we speak of the total 
debt of the country, it appears misleading to exclude the state and local debt. And the picture 
becomes even more complicated, because to get a complete accounting of debt we should 
include all household debt (e.g., mortgage and credit card), ﬁnancial sector debt, and the debt 
of nonﬁnancial business, which includes both bank loans outstanding and corporate bonds 
issued to ﬁnance private debt.

 
THE DEBT AND ITS LINKS TO FINANCE 
703
If we add all the categories to represent the total indebtedness of the whole country, we 
ﬁnd that, as of 2011, it did indeed exceed 350 percent of GDP and is much more than double 
what it was in the early 1970s (Figure 31.3). Such an inclusive debt concept is not of great 
signiﬁcance in ordinary times, but during the run-up to the Great Recession, it should have 
been setting off alarm bells, as it meant that the country as a whole had used up much of the 
leeway in terms of borrowing capacity that could have been drawn on to get out of a recession. 
Note that since the Great Recession, total debt has fallen as the economic downturn forced 
households and businesses to reduce their debt levels.
3.2 FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BORROWING: POTENTIAL PROBLEMS
In earlier chapters, we saw that when the government borrows money, it issues bonds on which 
it must pay interest. The interest payments form part of the annual federal budget. Figure 31.4 
shows how these payments as a percentage of federal spending have varied over time. Note 
that interest payments accounted for a much greater portion of the budget during the 1980s 
and 1990s than they do now. Considering that federal debt as a percentage of GDP has risen 
quite rapidly over the past decade, how can this be? The answer is that the unusually low 
interest rates that have prevailed over the same period make this possible.
We have seen in earlier chapters that a weak economy tends to induce lower interest rates, 
both naturally and as a consequence of policy measures. If interest rates are lower throughout 
the economy, the Treasury can issue new debt (e.g., Treasury bonds) at a low interest rate. 
When it does so, it is effectively reducing the portion of the federal budget that must be set 
aside for debt service. The phenomenon is not unlike the low monthly payments a homeowner 
makes after obtaining a mortgage with a very low interest rate. The major difference to keep 
in mind is that, unlike a household, the federal government has the ability to print money if 
need be to pay off its debt.
As of January 2013, the interest rate on a 10-year Treasury bond was 1.86 percent (see 
Figure 31.5). But during 2013 rates started rising, and in September 2013 had reached 2.92 
percent. One might think that at the historically low interest rates prevailing from 2009 to 
2012, borrowing was especially cheap, making it a good time for the government to run a 
budget deﬁcit and accumulate debt. The argument for adding to federal debt seems even 
stronger if the government spends on programs that produce a high multiplier effect (Chapter 
25). With low interest rates, the gain from the multiplier effect (in terms of the increase in 
aggregate demand) is potentially larger than the loss (adding to debt burden), making the 
net gain positive.
However, it may be counterproductive to allow the debt to grow if it is to ﬁnance “low-
multiplier” activities. An example is tax cuts for the wealthy, which, as we saw in Chapter 
Figure 31.3 Total U.S. Indebtedness as a Percentage of GDP
Here the federal debt is only a 
subset of the total, and one that 
has not increased substantially 
over the years. The household 
sector debt has grown much 
more rapidly, and that of the 
ﬁnancial sector most rapidly of 
all.

CHAPTER 31 — DEFICITS AND DEBT
25, do not produce as much “bang for the buck” as tax cuts for the poor or new spending on 
constructive activities. A useful way of understanding the problem is to imagine the federal 
government as a private business. Would a business borrow money at an interest rate higher 
than its expected rate of return? Here, the situation is similar, only a bit more complicated; 
the government needs to assess the projected “social return” of its expenditures.
Another concern with mounting debt is that, if sufﬁciently large, lenders might start to 
doubt the borrowers’ ability to repay. If the doubt were severe and widespread, it could affect 
the bond market and, indirectly, the national economy. Risk-averse investors would sell their 
bonds, driving bond prices down. When bond prices go down, bond yields (interest rates) go 
up (as noted in the Appendix to Chapter 27), because the amount that the government has to 
pay in interest on the bond becomes higher relative to the value of the bond.
The greater the unease over the borrower’s ability to pay, the higher the interest rate that 
the borrower must offer in order to attract lenders. In the summer of 2011, Standard and 
Poor’s, one of the major ratings agencies, downgraded U.S. government debt from AAA to 
AA+. Fortunately for the United States, even with this downgrade, its debt remained very 
much in demand.
A third potential problem with too much debt concerns exactly how it gets repaid. An 
indebted country must repay the principal on its debt and service it with interest payments. To 
do so, it must either engage in new borrowing, raise tax revenues, or monetize the debt. We 
have seen that increasing tax rates has the potential to reduce consumption and investment, 
hurting GDP growth and employment. But it is also possible to ﬁnance a federal budget 
deﬁcit with bonds that are purchased by the Fed. As we saw in Chapter 27, this amounts to 
an expansionary monetary policy.
A policy of monetizing the debt risks causing inﬂation, especially if the increase in the 
money supply is sufﬁciently large. If such inﬂation does occur, the bond markets might then 
demand higher interest rates on new debt to compensate for the anticipated loss from inﬂation. 
How serious is this danger? Some economists believe that a mild to moderate increase in 
inﬂation is not necessarily a problem, especially if it occurs in a depressed economy facing a 
looming threat of deﬂation. As we saw in Chapter 26, deﬂation would in most circumstances 
be more dangerous than inﬂation, while mild inﬂation has historically been associated with 
economic recoveries and gains in domestic employment. Severe inﬂation, however, would

be very damaging to the economy, and other economists point to this as a possible result of 
increasing government debt.
Discussion Questions
1. How many different “types” of debt can you think of? Which one do people usually mean 
when they speak about the “national debt”?
2. What are some potential problems with excessive federal debt? How can the debt be 
managed or repaid?
4. POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE DEBT
4.1 WHO OWNS THE DEBT?
We have already seen that when the federal government goes into debt, it sells government 
bonds. But who buys these bonds? It might surprise you to see how ownership of the gross 
federal debt is divided up. For example, due in large part to the recent and ongoing ﬁnancial 
crisis, the Fed has increased its holdings of government bonds, so its share of the total debt 
was 9.6 percent as of 2012 (Figure 31.6). Meanwhile, the amount owed to the Social Security 
fund accounts for 16.4 percent of the debt. As noted above in the discussion of the public 
debt, one thing the federal government may do when it possesses inadequate funds to pursue 
its objectives is skim off some of the surplus—if one exists—from the Social Security trust 
fund. It must then issue the fund an IOU in the form of a bond. 
Social security is by far the largest of the government accounts that hold federal debt. 
Among the many other funds, the principal ones are the funds for federal employee 
retirement, federal hospital insurance, and federal disability insurance. These and all 
the others collectively account for another 14.8 percent of federal debt. State and local 
governments, perhaps surprisingly, account for another 4.3 percent. States and municipalities 
will often use their budget surpluses to buy federal debt, because it is considered mostly 
risk free.

CHAPTER 31 — DEFICITS AND DEBT
The domestic private sector owns a bit more than a ﬁfth (21.3 percent) of the federal debt in 
the form of bonds, which are found in a variety of locations: banks, pension plans, insurance 
companies, mutual funds, and others, including households. Finally, as of 2012, foreigners 
owned just over one-third (33.5 percent) of all federal debt, totaling $5.5 trillion. This is the 
U.S. external debt; in absolute terms, it is by far the largest external debt of any country, but 
not when considered relative to GDP, as discussed below.
In 2013, China and Japan together owned more than 42 percent of the external U.S. debt 
(Figure 31.7), a reﬂection of the huge trade surpluses that the two countries have had with the 
United States for several decades. As we saw in Chapter 29, when China and Japan export 
more to the United States than they import from us, they acquire a surplus of U.S. dollars, 
which they then use to buy U.S. federal debt. Why do they choose to hold U.S. government 
debt? For the same reason that domestic investors, state and local governments, and the 
Social Security trust fund trustees do: Federal debt is widely perceived as returning risk-free 
income.
Four countries—Brazil, Taiwan, Switzerland, and Belgium—accounted for another 14 
percent of the U.S. external debt; major oil-exporting countries had 4.6 percent, and another 
5.2 percent were held in Caribbean offshore banking centers. Finally, the remaining countries 
(approximately 190) collectively owned 33.9 percent of the U.S. external debt as of 2013. 
Although in absolute terms the U.S. debt is by far the highest in the world, it is a very 
different story if we look at total debt in relation to GDP. Japan’s ratio of debt to GDP has risen 
since its economic slowdown started in the 1990s and is currently 214.1 percent of GDP (Figure 
31.8). Nevertheless, Japanese bonds are still bought and traded on the secondary market, 
which may be a testament to the widespread belief in the stability of the Japanese economy. 
This is in stark contrast to Greece, which has had to raise its bond rates substantially to attract 
continued investors, even though its debt to GDP ratio (168 percent) is still signiﬁcantly below 
Japan’s. Italy’s ratio, at 122.7 percent, also surpasses that of the United States.
Among the countries listed, only in the UK does the rate of increase in the debt : GDP 
ratio since 2006 surpass that of the United States, whose ratio increased from 66.4 percent 
to 108.6 percent from 2006 to 2012, impelled by tax cuts and the ﬁnancial crisis. Still, the 
U.S. situation continues to resemble Japan’s, in that growing indebtedness has not noticeably 
altered investor conﬁdence, allowing the U.S. bond yields to remain fairly low.

4.2 THE BALANCED BUDGET DEBATE
If balancing the budget were legally required, the United States would never have accumulated 
the debt that it has. Hoping to avoid uncontrolled debt dependence, many in the past have 
advocated legislation requiring that the budget be balanced. Some have even recommended 
an amendment to the Constitution requiring a balanced federal budget, but the majority in 
Congress has always viewed the idea as too extreme.
Most states have a balanced budget requirement that forces them to cut services and 
government employees during a recession. The federal government often provides aid to 
allow states to minimize cost cutting, in an attempt to prevent the economy from weakening 
further. States have no other recourse because, unlike the federal government, they are unable 
to create additional funds. In large part, this explains why, as we discussed in Chapter 25, 
states (as well as municipalities) practice “procyclical” instead of countercyclical policy. 
A balanced budget amendment would effectively make the federal government little different 
from the states. Proponents argue that such a law would prevent the federal government from 
imprudently running deﬁcits, potentially causing inﬂation, in good economic times. But there 
is a very serious downside, in that such an amendment would make the federal government 
powerless to use countercyclical policy to ﬁght recessions.
In 1985, Congress passed the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deﬁcit Control Act, more 
popularly known as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings act (named after the senators who sponsored 
it). It required that a limit be set on the annual deﬁcit and that the limit be reduced until a 
balanced budget was achieved in 1991. While less stringent than a constitutional requirement, 
the deﬁcit ceiling was nevertheless strict. Not meeting it would require spending to be reduced 
automatically to the point where the deﬁcit was no higher than the prescribed limit for that 
year. It proved too much for Congress—and even for the Supreme Court, which found the 
automatic reduction provision unconstitutional.
In 2011 and again in 2013, the Obama administration faced a potential crisis over the 
near breaching of what is known as the U.S. debt ceiling. (This is different from a deﬁcit 
ceiling. According to rules set by Congress, a vote of Congress is required to increase the

not caused economic crisis. 
Greece, with a much smaller 
economy, has suffered severely

CHAPTER 31 — DEFICITS AND DEBT
debt beyond a set amount, called the debt ceiling.) As the debt approached the mandated 
ceiling, the United States faced the prospect of not being able to borrow fresh funds to pay 
bonds that were coming due for payment. The risk of such a default would be a decline in 
the perceived creditworthiness of the United States and, as noted earlier, in 2011 Standard 
and Poor’s lowered the grade of U.S. Treasury bonds from AAA to AA+, the ﬁrst time in 
history that this had happened.
Following heated and partisan negotiations, Congress and the president struck a deal 
in 2011, allowing the debt ceiling to be raised (by a trillion dollars or so) and granting the 
federal government temporary access to more loans. The terms of the deal were that if the 
government failed to come to a long-term agreement by the end of 2012, the country would 
fall off a “ﬁscal cliff,” meaning that $607 billion of tax rate increases and spending cuts would 
be implemented almost immediately.
Completely falling off the ﬁscal cliff undoubtedly would have contributed to debt 
reduction, but tax increases and spending cuts of the magnitude imposed by the terms of the 
2011 agreement would have created serious dangers for a still-weak national economy. Even 
under normal conditions, there are strong arguments against a balanced budget requirement, 
but in early 2013 reducing deﬁcits rapidly could have been especially harmful. From a 
Keynesian point of view (as noted in Chapters 25 and 28), a period of anemic job growth is 
a time to pursue countercyclical policy, using deﬁcits to stimulate the economy and create 
jobs; it makes better sense to wait for a healthier economy before undertaking further deﬁcit 
reduction.
Obama and Congress debated until the last few hours of 2012 before reaching an agreement 
in January 2013 to temporarily avoid the “cliff.” They agreed, among other things, to restore 
payroll taxes back to 6.2 percent of income (they had been lowered in 2010 to 4.2 percent 
as part of a temporary tax holiday) and to raise the marginal tax rate on individuals earning 
more than $400,000 and households earning more than $450,000 from 35 to 39.6 percent. 
These tax rate increases were considerably less than those implied by the “cliff.” But on the 
spending side, $85 billion in across-the-board spending cuts, known as the “sequester,” did 
go into effect two months later. 
In October 2013, another bitter conﬂict over the debt ceiling ended with an agreement just 
one day before the Treasury would have run out of funds to pay off bonds and meet other 
obligations such as Social Security payments, following a 16-day shutdown of the Federal 
government. Once again, the President and Congress agreed to negotiate over long-term 
debt reduction plans. 
In the wake of the 2013 government shutdown, it was apparent that the crisis resulted 
in signiﬁcant economic costs and a setback to the pace of recovery. Standard and Poor’s 
estimated that the shutdown had cost had cost $24 billion, or $1.5 billion per day, and slowed 
the country’s economic growth by an annualized 0.6 percent for the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Fighting over the debt appeared to be more damaging than the debt itself.
In the long run, of course, it is important to keep debt levels under control, but it is a mistake 
to presume that the federal government should maintain zero debt. The ability to use deﬁcits 
at appropriate times to generate a ﬁscal stimulus is what sets the federal government apart 
from the states and cities and possibly protects a weak economy from sinking deeper.
4.3 IMPOSED AUSTERITY: THE CASE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
In recent years, the member countries of the European Union (EU) have been confronting 
issues similar to those in the United States, but their response has been quite different. In a 
number of EU countries, as in much of the rest of the world, a ﬁnancial collapse followed 
the bursting of real estate bubbles in the U.S. and many other countries. The sudden end 
to a global spree of excessive bank leverage and speculation forced many economies into 
recession.

 
POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE DEBT 
709
Governments, faced with the choice of complete ﬁnancial collapse or the bailout of 
banks with public money, chose the latter. Recessions in countries like Greece, Spain, and 
Portugal caused government revenues to fall and expenditures to rise, increasing deﬁcit and 
debt levels. While the overall situation in Europe may seem strikingly similar to that of the 
United States, there is an important difference. In Europe, much of the crisis focuses on what 
is called sovereign debt—that is, government debt, especially government debt in a currency 
that the government does not control. 
Seventeen countries within the European Union have adopted the euro as their currency. In 
order to participate in the euro currency, EU member countries must meet certain convergence 
criteria. One criterion concerns government ﬁnances and requires both that a country’s 
annual deﬁcit not exceed 3 percent of GDP and that its national debt not exceed 60 percent 
of GDP.* After the country is accepted into the eurozone (countries that have adopted the 
euro as the national currency), the restriction is relaxed somewhat under circumstances of 
extreme economic difﬁculty (which explains, for example, how Greece, Italy, and others can 
have a debt: GDP ratio much higher than 60 percent), but countries must then demonstrate 
that they are making progress toward once again achieving the target amounts. 
Table 31.2 shows deﬁcit and debt ﬁgures for Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain. 
Although all are still far from satisfying the convergence criteria (Italy meets the deﬁcit 
criterion but not the debt criterion), only for Greece have leading experts even discussed 
possible expulsion from the eurozone. But this does not mean that governments have not 
taken action to reduce these numbers.
Authorities in the European Union insisted on a policy of austerity for deeply indebted 
countries. Austerity policy required these countries to reduce expenditures or raise taxes to 
balance their budgets. Unfortunately, such policies have worsened recessionary conditions, 
pushing unemployment rates in some of the worst-hit countries to Great Depression 
levels.
Greece, Spain, and, to a lesser degree, Portugal have experienced considerable social 
unrest in recent years. There is widespread resentment of governments that are willing to 
bail out investors in the ﬁnancial industry but then ask the public to accept higher taxes and 
spending cuts to pay for them. The populations of these countries include millions of retirees 
who see grave threats to the government pensions on which they rely for income support in 
their old age. 
Since countries that are members of the eurozone do not have their own currencies, they 
cannot conduct expansionary monetary policy, and under austerity rules they must implement 
contractionary ﬁscal policy. The combination renders them unable to use economic policy 
to promote recovery. Their ability to borrow is also constrained, since too much borrowing 
could drive the interest rates on their debt to unsustainable levels.

in the three best-performing EU members; (2) not having devalued domestic currency for at least two years; and (3) long-term 
interest rate no higher than 2 percent above that in the three best EU inﬂation performers.

710 
CHAPTER 31 — DEFICITS AND DEBT
The United States does not confront the same problems, for two reasons. The ﬁrst is that, 
at least up to the present, its bond yields are not nearly as sensitive to its escalating debt as 
are yields in other countries. The issue is related to the U.S. position in the global economy, 
which, as noted in Chapter 29, has much to do with the historic prestige and strength of the 
U.S. dollar. The U.S. dominance in this regard may change in the future, but as of now the 
United States enjoys the advantages of having a “safe haven” currency.
The second reason is that the Fed is far more ﬂexible than its EU counterpart, the European 
Central Bank (ECB). The ECB’s singular agenda is controlling inﬂation, and it does not 
consider the ﬁscal conditions in individual countries. The Fed, in contrast, has a dual mandate 
to address both inﬂation and unemployment, providing more ﬂexibility to address short-term 
economic problems.* As we have seen since the ﬁnancial crisis, the United States has the 
ability to employ countercyclical ﬁscal policy and use monetary policy such as lower interest 
rates and quantitative easing to try to spur economic activity. The EU, however, has favored 
policies of austerity, which have worsened recessionary conditions but have done little to 
reduce overall debt levels (see Box 31.1).
Discussion Questions
1. Should there be a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution? What problems might 
such an amendment create?
2. What is the difference between austerity and stimulus? Which tack does the European 
Union follow? How is it different from what the United States has done? Which do you 
think is a better approach?
*The “dual mandate” results from amendments to the Federal Reserve Act in 1977. Prior to 1977, the Fed did not have a 
history of pursuing job growth and had a reputation primarily as an inﬂation ﬁghter.
BOX 31.1 EUROPE PRESSURED TO RECONSIDER AUSTERITY POLICIES
In 2013, unemployment surpassed Great Depression-
era levels in Southern Europe, and was rising even 
in the less hard-hit economies of the north. The job-
less rate in the 17 countries of the Eurozone topped 
12 percent in mid-2013. Inﬂuential voices warned 
that European policies of austerity were failing, 
worsening recession while not helping deﬁcit and 
debt problems.
After years of insisting that the primary cure 
for Europe’s malaise is to slash spending, the 
champions of austerity, most notably Chancellor 
Angela Merkel of Germany, ﬁnd themselves 
under intensiﬁed pressure to back off unpopular 
remedies and ﬁnd some way to restore faltering 
growth to the world’s largest economic bloc.
 
Mounting doubts among ordinary Europeans 
and even the International Monetary Fund have 
forced senior ofﬁcials in Brussels [ofﬁcial seat 
of the European Union] to acknowledge that a 
move away from what critics see as a ﬁxation on 
debt and deﬁcits toward more growth-friendly 
policies is necessary. “There has been a clear shift 
in thinking,” said Guntram Wolff, an economist 
with the European Commission.
 
Hints of a new approach in Europe are likely 
to be greeted as good news by the Obama ad-
ministration, which has urged healthy European 
economies to stimulate growth with increased 
spending and more relaxed monetary policy. The 
American economy, where government spend-
ing has not been reduced as drastically, looks 
relatively robust in comparison with Europe.

5. DEFICIT PROJECTIONS AND POTENTIAL POLICY RESPONSES
5.1 DEFICIT PROJECTIONS
The U.S. annual federal deﬁcit declined from a peak of 10 percent of GDP in 2009 to 7 percent 
of GDP in ﬁscal 2012, and appeared on track to decline further, to around 4 percent of GDP in 
ﬁscal 2013.1 The Congressional Budget Ofﬁce (CBO), which provides nonpartisan economic 
analysis for Congress, projects that the deﬁcit will continue to decline as a percentage of GDP for 
a couple of years but then start to increase again after 2015 (Figure 31.9).2 Although the annual 
federal deﬁcit averaged 3.1 percent of GDP from 1973 to 2012, the deﬁcit is projected to grow 
to 3.8 percent of GDP in 2023 and continue on an upward trajectory after that (see Box 31.2).

The annual federal deﬁcit is 
expected to decline through 2015 
as the economy improves, but 
over the longer term deﬁcits are 
expected to rise due to the effects 
of an aging population, higher 
health-care costs and subsidies, 
and rising interest payments on the 
national debt.

Similarly, the federal debt held by the public is projected to decrease to 73 percent of GDP 
in 2018 but then slowly increase to 77 percent of GDP by 2023. The CBO analysis, which 
assumes no major changes in federal law, identiﬁes four main reasons deﬁcits are projected 
to remain at relatively high levels even as the economy stabilizes:
1. the demographic pressures of an aging population
2. an increase in health-care costs
3. an increase in federal subsidies for health care
4. an increase in interest payments on the federal debt
Note that the ﬁrst three factors are closely related and suggest that a focus on health care 
should be an important component of any signiﬁcant long-term budgetary reforms in the 
United States. The CBO explains:
The aging of the baby-boom generation portends a signiﬁcant and sustained increase in 
coming years in the share of the population that will receive beneﬁts from Social Security 
and Medicare and long-term care services ﬁnanced through Medicaid. Moreover, per 
capita spending on health care is likely to continue to grow faster than per capita spending 
on other goods and services for many years. . . . Without signiﬁcant changes in the laws 

712 
CHAPTER 31 — DEFICITS AND DEBT
governing Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, those factors will boost federal outlays 
as a percentage of GDP well above the average of the past several decades—a conclusion 
that applies under any plausible assumptions about future trends in demographics, 
economic conditions, and health care costs. Unless the laws governing those programs 
are changed—or the increased spending is accompanied by sufﬁciently lower spending 
on other programs, sufﬁciently higher revenues, or a combination of the two—deﬁcits 
will be much larger in the future than they have tended to be in the past.3
5.2 POLICY CHOICES
The principle that the United States requires long-term budgetary reform is widely accepted. 
As implied in the CBO quotation above, the basic math dictates that the choices for reform 
are limited to three basic options:
1. revenue (i.e., tax) increases
2. spending decreases
3. some combination of revenue increases and spending decreases
Few economists or politicians advocate tax increases alone as a solution to reduce the 
federal deﬁcit. Thus most of the debate concerns whether budgetary reforms should include 
only spending cuts or whether tax revenues also need to be increased. So far, both spending 
cuts and tax increases have been pursued.
BOX 31.2 DECLINING BUDGET DEFICITS
According to a report issued by the Congressional 
Budget Office (CBO) in May 2013, the federal 
deﬁcit fell by 32 percent over the period October 
2012—April 2013 compared to the same period in 
the previous year. The CBO noted:
The federal government ran a budget deﬁcit of 
$489 billion in the ﬁrst seven months of ﬁscal year 
2013, according to CBO’s estimates. That amount 
is $231 billion less than the shortfall recorded dur-
ing the same period last year, primarily because 
revenue collections have been much greater than 
they were at this point in 2012. In contrast, federal 
spending so far this year has been slightly lower 
than what it was last year at this time.
And the CBO projected a continuation of the trend 
of shrinking deﬁcits:
If the current laws that govern federal spending and 
taxes do not change, the budget deﬁcit will shrink 
this year to $642 billion, the smallest shortfall since 
2008. Relative to the size of the economy, the deﬁcit 
this year—at 4.0 percent of gross domestic product 
(GDP)—will be less than half as large as the shortfall 
in 2009, which was 10.1 percent of GDP.
Tax receipts increased for several reasons,

Spending on some programs increased, including 
Social Security and Medicare. Spending by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency increased due to 
Hurricane Sandy, and spending by the Department of 
Agriculture increased as a result of drought conditions.
In longer-range projections, budget deﬁcits were pro-
jected to fall even further, to about 2.1 percent of GDP in 
2015. However, deﬁcits were projected to increase again 
in the coming decade, reaching 3.5 percent of GDP in 
2023, due to an aging population, rising health care 
costs, an expansion of federal subsidies for health insur-
ance, and growing interest payments on federal debt.

DEFICIT PROJECTIONS AND POTENTIAL POLICY RESPONSES 
713
Federal spending declined from a peak of 25.2 percent of GDP in 2009 to 22.8 percent in 
2012, with further minor declines projected through 2017. Federal revenues increased from a low 
of 15.1 percent of GDP in 2009 to 15.8 percent in 2012 and are expected to continue growing 
for a few more years. Some of the change in both spending and revenues relates to improving 
economic conditions, but federal legislation has also been enacted to reduce budget deﬁcits.
As mentioned earlier, in January 2013 Congress agreed to increase tax rates on the 
wealthiest households (individuals making more than $400,000 per year and couples making 
more than $450,000). At the same time, the 2010 provision that had temporarily reduced 
payroll taxes by two percentage points for all workers was allowed to expire. So while the 
richest households faced the largest tax increases, federal taxes rose for about 77 percent of 
American households in 2013.
The January 2013 legislation reduced current deﬁcits but did not address the fundamental 
long-term budgetary imbalance of the federal government. We next consider two proposals 
for budgetary reform.
5.3 BUDGETARY REFORMS: THE SIMPSON-BOWLES PLAN
In early 2010, President Obama appointed an 18-member bipartisan commission to develop 
speciﬁc recommendations for deﬁcit reduction. Known as the National Commission on Fis-
cal Responsibility and Reform (NCFRR), it was led by Republican Alan Simpson (a former 
senator) and Democrat Erskine Bowles. Their recommendations are commonly known as the 
Simpson-Bowles Plan.* The plan called for a cumulative (not annual) deﬁcit reduction of 
almost $4 trillion from 2012 to 2020 and eliminating the deﬁcit entirely by 2035. The plan 
also projected that the debt held by the public would be reduced to 40 percent of its current 
level by 2035. Some key elements of this plan include:
1. Reducing discretionary spending by a cumulative $1.7 trillion, including both defense and 
nondefense cuts. The report suggests spending caps, a three-year freeze on congressional 
pay, eliminating Congressional “earmarked” spending for speciﬁc local projects, and a 
reduction in the federal workforce.
2. Adding about $1 trillion in cumulative revenues. While the report actually recommends 
reducing marginal tax rates, it more than offsets that by eliminating more than 150 tax 
deduction provisions. For example, under current law, a taxpayer can deduct the interest 
paid on the mortgage for a second home—the plan would eliminate this deduction. The 
plan advocates that the overall progressivity of the federal tax system should be maintained 
or increased, rather than imposing an additional burden on low-income households, and 
also recommends an increase in the gasoline tax of 15 cents per gallon.
3. Creating about $340 billion in cumulative savings from reductions in health-care costs, 
through various reforms to Medicare and Medicaid.
4. Realizing about $240 billion in cumulative savings from Social Security reforms. The plan 
recommends gradually increasing the full retirement age from 67 to 69 by 2075, slowing 
the growth of beneﬁts to middle- and high-income individuals, and raising the cap on 
income subject to Social Security taxes (the cap was $113,700 as of 2013; increasing the 
cap would mean that wealthier individuals would pay more social security tax).
After being drafted, the Simpson-Bowles Plan ﬁrst needed to be approved by 14 members 
of the full 18-member NCFRR. However, the plan received only 11 votes (support for the 
plan was split essentially equally among Republicans and Democrats). Thus the plan was not

put to a vote in Congress. Despite this failure, both Simpson and Bowles have continued to 
advocate for their plan, making slight changes to it. In February 2013, they wrote:
The failure to get our debt under control, reform our Tax Code and put our entitlement 
programs on a ﬁscally sustainable course is robbing us of the ability to invest in our 
future and will leave us without the resources we need to meet other challenges facing 
our nation. And moving forward will be out of our reach as long as we continue to “pass 
the buck” on the debt crisis. It is critical that leaders in both parties come together in 
an honest and meaningful way to put our ﬁscal house in order if they have any hope of 
addressing the other challenges and opportunities that we face as a nation. . . . If both 
sides move as one beyond their comfort zone on health and tax reform, those changes 
could be combined with the other spending cuts discussed in the negotiations last 
December [2012] to produce a package large enough to stabilize and begin to reduce 
our debt as a share of the economy.6
5.4 BUDGETARY REFORMS: CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE
As a nonpartisan organization, the CBO does not provide speciﬁc recommendations. Instead, 
it aims to analyze the implications of various policy options from an objective point of view. 
Based on a 2011 analysis, the CBO considers three potential policy objectives:
1. Balance the federal budget by 2020: This would require $1 trillion in total annual budget-
ary reforms by 2020 (i.e., a combination of spending reductions and revenue increases).
2. Limit debt to 75 percent of GDP in 2020: This would require $500 billion in total annual 
budgetary reforms.
3. A midway objective that would “keep future deﬁcits stable at a relatively small percentage 
of GDP”: This would require $750 billion in total annual budgetary reforms.
The CBO notes that even the most modest of these proposals (#2) would require substantial 
policy adjustment:
Very few policy changes, taken individually, can shrink the deﬁcit enough to achieve 
any of those objectives. Ultimately, signiﬁcant deﬁcit reduction is likely to require a 
combination of policies, many of which may stand in stark contrast to policies now in 
place. . . . [A] wide gap exists between the future cost of the services that the public has 
become accustomed to receiving from the federal government—especially in the form 
of beneﬁts for older people—and the tax revenues that the public has been sending to 
the government to pay for those services.4
The CBO analysis considers three categories of budgetary reforms:
1. Reduce mandatory spending: This primarily includes spending on programs such as Social 
Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
2. Reduce discretionary spending: This includes spending on national defense, education, 
highways, scientiﬁc research, and the environment.
3. Increase revenues: This includes letting some existing tax cuts expire, as well instituting 
new taxes.
The CBO considered nearly 70 potential budgetary changes. For each change, it estimated 
the budgetary savings that would accrue in 2020 (see Table 31.3).
One implication of the CBO’s estimates is that there is no “magic bullet” that can resolve 
the country’s budgetary imbalance. Even the most signiﬁcant action, letting all 2001, 2003, and 

 
DEFICIT PROJECTIONS AND POTENTIAL POLICY RESPONSES 
715
2009 tax cuts expire, satisﬁes only the least stringent policy objective listed above. Another 
implication is that spending cuts alone will not be sufﬁcient to balance the federal budget. 
Even if all 47 budget cuts considered by the CBO were enacted, including the politically 
unpopular sequestration cuts, total budgetary savings would be only about $900 billion while 
$1 trillion in savings would be required to balance the budget.
Revenue increases offer larger total budgetary savings (nearly $2 trillion for all 
20 options considered by the CBO), but many of these options are rather unpopular, 
including letting existing tax cuts expire for all income levels and eliminating various 
tax deductions. Note that a tax on greenhouse gas emissions, starting at $20 per ton of 
carbon dioxide and increasing by 5.6 percent per year, could generate $140 billion in 
additional revenues.5
The various budgetary reforms analyzed by the CBO would differ in terms of their 
impact on the economy and the distribution of the burden. For example, the CBO notes 
that reducing investment on things like infrastructure and education would decrease 
future economic production. Increasing the retirement age for Social Security would 
disproportionately harm lower-income individuals, as they rely more heavily on Social 
Security beneﬁts.
5.5 DEBT AND DEFICITS IN CONTEXT
The analyses by the CBO and Simpson-Bowles indicate that signiﬁcant budgetary policy 
changes are needed to address a long-term structural ﬁscal imbalance in the United States. 
In both analyses, most of the policy options are phased in gradually to reduce the likelihood 
of economic disruptions.

CHAPTER 31 — DEFICITS AND DEBT
The debate over debts and deﬁcits should be placed in a larger macroeconomic context 
as well as a social and environmental context. For example, proposals to balance the federal 
budget by “broadening the tax base” may imply increasing economic inequality, already at 
historically high levels. Given the strong negative impacts of wide inequalities on the social 
and economic health of a society, it makes sense that major federal policies, regarding both 
spending and taxing, should emphasize reducing inequality. As shown in Table 31.3, some 
possibilities for generating additional revenues also address environmental concerns. A carbon 
tax on gasoline or, more broadly, on greenhouse gas emissions would not only reduce budget 
deﬁcits but also internalize the negative externalities associated with burning fossil fuels and 
increase overall economic efﬁciency.
Recent budgetary impasses also reﬂect a change from earlier generations, when policies 
were frequently adjusted, often with bipartisan support, to address national needs. Consider 
that Social Security tax rates were raised more than 20 times between 1937 and 1990 as the 
program’s needs increased. More recent strong opposition to raising those taxes stands in 
contrast to this historical context. Although the budgetary challenge facing the United States 
may not be its most pressing policy priority, relative to other priorities such as job generation 
and climate change, it will clearly require some difﬁcult choices. But the problem is solvable, 
as long as policymakers are willing to compromise and take a long-term perspective.
Discussion Questions
1. Do you think that we can reduce deﬁcits while also avoiding an increase in tax rates? Why 
would political leaders consider tax hikes? Should everyone experience the same increase?
2. Are there tax policies that can reduce the deﬁcit while also addressing environmental 
problems?

32 How Economies Grow and Develop
What do people mean by economic development? How do the economic status of countries 
and the well-being of their people change over time? Most of the macroeconomic theory that 
we have presented relates to advanced economies such as that of the United States. But if we 
think back 100 years, the United States was a very different place than it is today. Most trans-
portation was still horse drawn, with only a few cars operating on a poor-quality road system. 
Most rural areas did not have electricity or telephone service. In 1900, real per capita income 
in the nation was about $5,000 (measured in 2000 dollars). During the twentieth century, real 
per capita income in the United States rose about sevenfold, to more than $35,000.
The median income in the world today is about equal to that of the United States in the early 
1900s. Although billions of people still live in severe poverty, some formerly poor countries—
such as South Korea, China, and India—are rapidly developing. Many others have experienced 
little economic progress. It is both interesting and important to evaluate how economies grow, 
how the growth process differs in different cases, and why some countries are very successful 
at promoting rapid growth, while others seem to be “stuck” at a low level of income.
As we will see in what follows, economic growth and economic development are not always 
the same thing, and the differences become more pronounced at higher levels of income. 
One important theme in this chapter is that, contrary to some earlier theories, there is nothing 
“automatic” about poor countries becoming developed. Another is that even rapid and sustained 
GDP growth may not be sufﬁcient to ensure broad-based well-being improvement.
1. DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH
Economic development is an idea that became formalized in the mid-twentieth century, as the 
colonial empires began to break down and the more industrialized countries gradually took 
on a changed set of attitudes toward the parts of the world that had not experienced indus-
trialization.* The economic relations between colonies and their rulers had been dominated 
by the desire of the ruling countries to enrich themselves, ﬁrst, through extraction of raw 
materials, and, second, through the creation of markets for goods that they wished to export. 
By the mid-twentieth century, resistance to imperial domination and strong movements for 
independence had made it impossible for the ruling countries to maintain their control. The 
emergence of many new independent countries required a change in attitude. 
On the economic side, it was recognized that countries make better trading partners if 
they can escape from poverty. On the moral side was the recognition that, considering the 
*In the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, a number of Western countries, including Britain, France, the Netherlands, 
and Spain, were colonial powers, exerting control over many colonies in Africa, Asia, and South America. Japan was also 
a colonial power, ruling South Korea and, at various times, parts of China. Most of the colonies had become independent 
countries by the 1960s.

 
DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH

improvement in living conditions that had accompanied industrialization for the richer 
countries, it was only right that the “underdeveloped” countries should have a chance to 
develop their economies and to gain greater wealth and well-being. Some theorists of 
“neo-colonialism” have argued that the former colonial powers continued to use political 
and economic power to maintain their dominant position. Nonetheless, newly independent 
countries were determined to promote economic progress, and the economic theory of 
development emerged with the purpose of helping to achieve this goal. 
The idea of development initially focused on the question: How can poor countries most 
rapidly follow in the steps of the rich ones? The answers to this question are the subject of 
a large part of this chapter. We focus especially on the countries where there is a clear need 
for increased economic development to satisfy people’s basic needs for food, shelter, health 
care, and education. But it is also worth noting that the term “development” can be used for 
all kinds of positive economic change and, thus, could also be applied to the countries that 
have successfully achieved greater wealth and industrialization. That is an issue to which we 
return in Chapter 33, where we will take a look at the changes that will be required both in 
wealthier countries and in rapidly developing countries such as China, if the global economy 
is to achieve a sustainable balance with its ecological context.
1.1 STANDARD ECONOMIC GROWTH THEORY
As we noted in Chapter 21, there are many criticisms of the use of GDP as a measure of 
economic progress. Standard models of economic growth, however, are all based on this 
measure, and we begin by reviewing some of these models.
The simplest deﬁnition of economic growth is an increase in real GDP (i.e., GDP adjusted 
for inﬂation). The growth rate of real GDP is the percentage change in real GDP from one 
year to the next. Using what we learned in Chapter 20, we can express the rate of growth in, 
for example, the period 2011–12, as follows:
growth rate of real GDP = Real GDP2012 – Real GDP2011  100
Real GDP2011
For example, U.S. real GDP in 2011 (in chained 2005 dollars) was $13.44 trillion and in 
2012 it was $13.67 trillion. Thus the growth rate of real U.S. GDP from 2011 to 2012 was
= 13.67 –13.44  100 =
.23
 100 = 2.9 percent
13.44
12.44
For purposes of evaluating how economic growth is related to economic development, it is 
often helpful to focus on the growth rate of GDP per capita—that is, output per person—rather 
than simply on overall output. Mathematically, GDP per capita is expressed as:
GDP per capita = GDP / population
The growth rates of GDP, population, and GDP per capita are related in the following way 
(where the sign ≈ means “approximately equals”):
Growth rate of GDP ≈ Growth rate of population + growth rate of GDP per capita
or:
Growth rate of GDP per capita ≈ Growth rate of GDP – growth rate of population 

720 
CHAPTER 32 — HOW ECONOMIES GROW AND DEVELOP
Thus, for example, an economy that has a GDP growth rate of 4 percent and a population 
growth rate of 2 percent would have a per capita GDP growth rate of approximately 2 percent. 
The per capita GDP growth rate is especially important because it indicates the actual increase 
in average income being experienced by the people of the country. If a country had a 2 percent 
GDP growth rate, but a 3 percent population growth rate, its per capita GDP growth rate 
would actually be negative, at –1 percent. The people would on average be getting poorer each 
year, even though the overall economy is growing. Thus for people’s incomes on average to 
increase over time, the GDP growth rate must exceed the rate of population growth.
In terms of the aggregate supply and demand graphs that we used in Chapter 28, economic 
growth can be shown as a rightward shift of the aggregate supply (AS), increasing the 
economy’s maximum capacity (Figure 32.1). If this kind of increase in aggregate supply took 
place without any shift in aggregate demand (AD), its effects would include growth in output 
and a declining rate of inﬂation. In practice, however, economic growth is almost always 
accompanied by, and is often caused at least in part by, an increase in aggregate demand. 
Thus a more typical pattern for economic growth would be for both the AD and AS curves 
to shift to the right, as shown in Figure 32.1. In this case, output clearly rises, but the effect 
on inﬂation is ambiguous.
What causes economic output to increase? One way that output could increase is if there 
is an expansion in the inputs used to produce it. Recall that in Chapters 1 and 15 we outlined 
ﬁve kinds of capital. Land and natural resources are natural capital. The stock of productive 
resources that have been produced by people is called manufactured capital. All the skills 
and knowledge possessed by humans are human capital, while social and ﬁnancial capital 
both refer to institutional arrangements that make production possible.
Capital expansion is related to the production-possibilities frontier (PPF) that we ﬁrst saw 
in Chapter 1. Recall that any point “outside” the PPF is unattainable—impossible to achieve 
with the present endowment of inputs and available technology. So another way of seeing 
GDP growth is in relation to the capital expansion required to “shift” the PPF outward, to 
where previously unattainable combinations of, say, guns and butter become possible. Such an 
outward shift could require an increase in any one of the capital types: for example, if all the 
material and technological resources are in place but are being used inefﬁciently, an outward 
shift could be achieved through an increase in social capital that allows better coordination 
and cooperation among workers and managers.
Economists sometimes think about output as being generated according to a “production 
function,” which is a mathematical relation between various inputs and the level of output. In 
Figure 32.1 Economic Growth in the AS/AD Model
Economic growth increases the 
maximum capacity of the economy. 
It involves both supply-side and 
demand-side expansions, and does 
not necessarily involve a change in the 
rate of inﬂation.

DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH 
721
the most general sense, we might say that the output of an economy should be expressed as 
a function of ﬂows from all the different types of capital that make production possible. The 
inputs to the production function are commonly referred to as factors of production. In the 
production functions most commonly used by economists, the factors that are emphasized 
are manufactured capital and labor. Sometimes, but not always, natural resources are also 
included.
Technology is the other important variable that inﬂuences economic output. We say that 
a point outside the PPF is unattainable “given available factors of production (i.e., inputs) 
and the present state of technology.” In other words, it matters not only how many of the 
different factors we possess but also how productive on average each is—and productivity 
depends crucially on the level of technology.
In their production functions, economists often include a term that captures total 
factor productivity, which includes all contributions to total production not already 
reﬂected in the input levels. “Total factor productivity” has often been interpreted as 
reﬂecting the way in which technological innovation allows inputs such as capital and 
labor to be used in more effective and valuable ways. For example, the development of 
word-processing software greatly increased efﬁciency compared to the use of typewriters. 
Typewriters, which seem antique to us today, were themselves a huge productive advance 
over clerical work using pen and paper. This process of improved technological methods 
has resulted in an increase in labor productivity—more output can now be produced with 
fewer inputs. The input most often measured in productivity statistics is labor-hours; 
however, total factor productivity also takes into account natural capital, machinery, and 
any other relevant inputs.
1.2 HISTORICAL OVERVIEW AND TWENTIETH-CENTURY THEORY
The Industrial Revolution, a process of rapid social, technological, and economic change, 
which began in Britain and Western Europe, dramatically changed the nature of economic 
production. Although, as we discuss later, the applicability of this model to current develop-
ment issues has been subject to criticism, its strong inﬂuence on standard views of economic 
growth makes it an important starting point for understanding development.
Several elements were critical in creating the Industrial Revolution. First, new agricultural 
techniques, along with new kinds of tools and machines, made agriculture more productive. 
Because farmers became more productive, fewer were needed to produce the necessary food, 
and many migrated to the growing urban areas. Second, the invention and application of 
technologies using fossil-fuel energy (especially coal) contributed not only to the productivity 
gains in agriculture but to growth in the number of factory jobs and the development of 
transportation networks. Third, Britain’s increasing reliance on other countries, including 
its extensive network of colonies, for supplies of raw materials and as markets for its goods, 
was critical in the development of its industrial sector. Britain imported cotton ﬁber from 
India, for example. It discouraged the further development of cotton manufacturing within 
India by putting high import tariffs on Indian-made cloth, while requiring that India let in 
British-made cloth tariff-free.
While the Industrial Revolution began in Britain, by the nineteenth and early twentieth 
centuries it was well along in much of Western Europe and other “early industrializing” 
countries, such as the United States, Canada, and Australia. It is important not just as a 
historical episode but because the pattern of economic development that it established has 
become, in many people’s minds, the model for how development should proceed worldwide. 
The vocabulary of referring to rich countries as “developed” and poorer countries as 
“developing,” for example, involves an implicit assumption that poorer countries are on a 
path of industrialization, on the road to perhaps eventually “catching up” to rich countries’ 
lifestyles and levels of wealth.

CHAPTER 32 — HOW ECONOMIES GROW AND DEVELOP
Starting in the early 1950s, a number of economists began to develop theories on how 
economies develop. The economic historian W.W. Rostow, for example, advanced the thesis 
that progress from “underdevelopment” to development invariably went through ﬁve stages. 
The ﬁrst he referred to as “traditional, agrarian society,” meaning not only an economy based 
on farming but also one that was stagnant—that is, not in an active process of development. 
The second stage, “preconditions for takeoff,” is similar to the ﬁrst, with the important 
exception that the country now possesses a critical mass of entrepreneurs and educated people, 
signifying the country’s potential for development. Although he did not use these terms, for 
Rostow “human capital” was indispensable for development, and “natural capital” (which 
even the least developed countries possess), while important, was insufﬁcient.
The third stage was “takeoff” (into self-sustaining growth). At this point, the country realizes 
its development “potential” by achieving a sufﬁciently high level of savings to ﬁnance the 
investment—speciﬁcally, manufactured capital accumulation—necessary for growth. From 
there, growth and development was expected to sustain itself. The fourth stage is the “drive 
to maturity,” and the ﬁnal stage, where the rich countries currently ﬁnd themselves, is the 
“age of high mass consumption.”
The main conclusion from Rostow’s theory is that after the necessary “preconditions” 
(education and entrepreneurship) are present, investment in manufactured capital and 
technology is sufﬁcient to propel a country to a high living standard. A very similar conclusion 
was reached by the more mathematical Harrod-Domar model, named after the economists 
Roy Harrod and Evsey Domar.
An important corollary to Rostow’s theory is that if domestic savings were insufﬁcient to 
enable a country to reach the “takeoff” stage, “foreign saving” should help compensate for 
the shortfall. This could come from private investment, assuming that countries had stable 
enough conditions to attract foreign investors. The theory also supported the then-widespread 
view that countries like the United States should provide foreign aid to developing countries 
in need, to help them raise their living standard (and also given the reality of the cold war, to 
lure them into their “sphere of inﬂuence”). Yet as we will see, success in this effort was far 
from universal. The failure of aid to stimulate sustained growth in many countries caused a 
great deal of frustration among policymakers.
By the 1980s, the idea that countries should engage in “structural reforms” as a precondition 
for being granted aid gained ground. Multilateral institutions such as the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which provided loans for development or to assist 
countries in ﬁnancial difﬁculties, began to insist that all recipient governments undertake 
a broad swath of policy changes to qualify for further loans. The set of favored policies 
came to be known as the “Washington Consensus.” The main principles of the Washington 
Consensus were:
s  Fiscal discipline. Developing countries were urged to end ﬁscal deﬁcits and balance gov-
ernment budgets by developing reliable sources of tax revenue and limiting spending.
s  Market liberalization and privatization. Abolition of government-controlled industries, 
price controls, and other forms of intervention in domestic markets were seen as essential 
to promoting growth.
s  Trade liberalization and openness to foreign investment. Countries were pressured to re-
move tariffs and other barriers to trade, as well as capital controls and other restrictions on 
foreign investment ﬂows.
Loans from the World Bank, the IMF, and other institutions were made conditional on 
moving toward making such “structural reforms” or “structural adjustments” in a country’s 
economy. The slogan “stabilize, privatize, and liberalize” governed the thinking of 
development policymakers. The implicit promise was that if these policies were followed, 
the conditions for rapid growth would be created. As in Rostow’s theory, the emphasis was

723
on making developing economies “safe” for foreign investment; also, the presumption was 
that the same guidelines applied to every developing country. A new element that arrived 
with the Washington Consensus was a set of limitations on the autonomy of developing 
country governments.
Recent growth performances seriously call into question the validity of these policy 
prescriptions. The region of the world most inﬂuenced by the Washington Consensus has 
been Latin America, and, as can be seen in Table 32.1, its growth rates over the past three 
decades compare rather unfavorably to the average growth rate for middle-income countries 
as a whole (with few exceptions, Latin American countries are in the “middle-income” 
category). Only Chile, which had 3.2 percent growth from 1980 to 2010, comes close to the 
global average for middle-income countries. All the other listed countries (with the possible 
exception of Colombia) grew anemically. The entire Latin America and Caribbean region 
grew only 0.9 percent on average.
The poor performance of this region of the world is, to date, the strongest indictment of 
the Washington Consensus. As we will see, however, even where growth in other regions has 
been stronger, it was quite imbalanced. One of the challenges in development economics is 
to address the growing inequality that results—both within and among countries.
Discussion Questions
1. How, according to twentieth-century theory, can a country achieve GDP growth? How 
is growth related to the capital endowments—and which kinds of capital are most 
important?
2. What, according to Rostow, are the ﬁve “stages of growth” through which all countries 
must pass in order to become developed? Do you think this theory ﬁts with the actual 
experience of development? Can you name a country at each stage?
2. COUNTRY GROWTH EXPERIENCES
The Rostow and Harrod-Domar models were largely based on the phenomenal economic 
growth record of the industrialized countries. This section brieﬂy reviews that record and 
then compares more recent growth rates of different countries.
2.1 GROWTH COMPARISONS ACROSS COUNTRIES
During the twentieth century, real income in the United States rose about sevenfold, and world 
per capita economic output grew about ﬁvefold. Most of this growth came in the second half 
of the twentieth century. Figure 32.2 shows the record of global growth since 1971. Gross 
world product went up by a factor of 3.5 during this period (in inﬂation-adjusted terms). 
This was accompanied by a more than doubling in the use of energy, primarily fossil fuels.

CHAPTER 32 — HOW ECONOMIES GROW AND DEVELOP
Even though world population nearly doubled over the period 1971–2011, food production 
and living standards grew more rapidly than population, leading to a steady increase in per 
capita income.
This economic growth has been very unevenly distributed among countries, as well as 
among people within countries. Table 32.2 shows the per capita national incomes and rates 
of economic growth for selected countries and income category groups during the period 
1990–2011. The table gives national income in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, 
comparing countries based on the relative buying power of incomes.
As Table 32.2 shows, the record is highly variable, with some countries achieving less 
than 1 percent annual per capita economic growth, and others achieving more than 4 percent, 
with China in the lead at a sizzling 9.5 percent. Some already poor countries, such as Haiti 
and the Democratic Republic of Congo, are growing even poorer. While the table indicates 
that the middle-income countries are the fastest-growing group, this is largely a result of high 
growth rates in China and India, which together account for more than half the population 
of all middle-income countries.
What accounts for the striking differences in economic fortunes across countries? And 
can we expect such differences to increase or decrease?
Economies such as those of the United States, Europe, and Japan have beneﬁted from 
many decades of economic growth. Such growth has not been uniform; periods of expansion 
have alternated with periods of slowdown or recession. (The Japanese economy, for example, 
has grown very slowly in recent years.) But overall, GDP in these countries has increased 
due to a combination of factors including growth in aggregate demand and—as discussed 
earlier—labor productivity, technological innovation, and investment in manufactured 
capital.
In addition, successful economic growth has often resulted from taking advantage of trade 
opportunities. Although industrialized countries have generally beneﬁted from openness to 
trade, they have also typically used protectionism—tariffs and quotas to limit trade—to foster

the development of important domestic industries. Critics such as economist Ha-Joon Chang 
claim that such countries have “kicked away” the (protectionist) ladder that they have used to 
ascend to higher living standards and now insist that poor countries seeking to develop their 
economies follow “free trade” rules and not use tariffs or quotas to protect their industries.
Japan and other “Asian Tigers” (South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore), 
starting in the mid-twentieth century, demonstrated a pattern of virtuous cycles in which 
high savings and investment lead to greater productivity, a competitive export industry, and 
growth of domestic industries. The resulting ﬁnancial capital is then invested in machines, 
tools, factories, and other equipment that can further enhance productivity—and the cycle 
begins again. In addition, as the economy grows, more resources are available to invest in 
the development of health-care and educational systems. It sounds simple and obvious—yet 
many countries have had great trouble in achieving such virtuous cycles.
One factor that appears to be essential in almost every case for promoting growth and 
development is human capital. While the U.S. savings rate is low, American investment in 
human capital is relatively high. For example, only Sweden, Korea, and Finland have college 
enrollments beyond high school that are higher than those in the United States. The Asian 
Tigers have also beneﬁted from generally excellent educational systems, along with industrial 
structure that (especially in Japan) motivated workers with good employment beneﬁts linked 
to company proﬁtability.
Early theories of development such as Rostow’s assumed that the lessons from 
industrialized economies simply needed to be applied to countries at lower levels of income, 
so that they could follow a similar path of economic growth. But the global record of uneven 
development and inequality makes the picture signiﬁcantly more complex. For example, the 
global distribution of per capita GDP across countries is shown in Figure 32.3, where each 
country’s per capita GDP in 2011 has been translated into real 2005 U.S. dollars and adjusted 
for PPP, for the sake of comparability. The United States, along with Canada, most of Europe, 
Australia, Japan, and a few other countries, enjoys a per capita GDP of more than $25,000.

CHAPTER 32 — HOW ECONOMIES GROW AND DEVELOP
The poorest countries on earth tend to be in Africa and Asia, where income per capita can be 
below—sometimes much below—$2,500.
Traditionally, many economists have taken an optimistic view concerning the future of 
global income inequality. They have argued that a given increase in the manufactured capital 
stock should lead to a greater increase in output in a country that is capital-poor than in a 
country that is already capital-rich. Therefore, as developing countries build up their capital 
stocks, it is just a matter of time until “less developed” countries catch up with the countries 
that have already “developed.” The idea that poorer countries or regions are on a path to “catch 
up” is often referred to as convergence. Describing low-income countries as “developing” 
assumes that they are on a one-way path toward greater industrialization, labor productivity, 
and integration into the global economy.
Is it true that “developing” countries are, in general, catching up with the “developed” 
countries? Some studies of GDP per capita growth rates, using data such as that in Table 
32.2, emphasize that even the low-income countries have grown more rapidly, on average, 
than the high-income ones. However, this has largely been due to the strong growth rates 
experienced by more populous countries (as noted above, the rapid growth of China and India 
signiﬁcantly raise the average for the middle-income group of countries). If we look at every 
country individually, the conclusion on convergence appears more ambiguous.
The evidence suggests that while some developing countries are on a path to catch up 
with the richer ones in GDP terms, others are not. In fact, if we count each country equally, 
the average annual growth rate of real GDP per capita (PPP) in 1990–2011 was 0.3 percent 
in the low-income countries, 1.9 percent in the middle-income countries, and 2.1 percent 
in the high-income countries—suggesting further divergence rather than convergence. It 
is also true that if a rich country and a poor one are experiencing the same percentage 
growth rate, this adds a great deal more income in the rich country than in the poor one. 
Thus in absolute terms the gap between them grows wider unless the poor country has a 
much higher growth rate.
In spite of all this, when GDP per capita of certain developing countries is expressed as a 
proportion of average GDP per capita in the high-income countries, some countries do appear

to be “catching up” (Figure 32.4a). South Korea, for example, is well on its way to joining 
the ranks of the rich countries, as its per capita GDP rose from about 30 percent of rich-
country GDP in 1980 to more than 80 percent today. Botswana’s per capita income also rose 
considerably over this period, from 20 percent of rich-country GDP to 40 percent. Although 
at a lower level, the rise in China’s per capita GDP has been the most rapid, from less than 
3 percent of rich-country GDP to more than 20 percent. Finally, India is also “catching up,” 
albeit somewhat more slowly and from a lower starting point.
Other developing countries exhibit trends such as those seen in Figure 32.4b. Brazil, often 
touted as one of the most important “newly industrializing countries” (NICs), experienced a 
per capita income drop in relation to the average in rich countries over the period 1980–2005, 
but has rebounded somewhat since 2005. Bolivia, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of 
Congo, among many other countries, suffered losses as well, the latter two from a very low 
starting point, and have had weaker recoveries since 2005 (virtually none for D.R. Congo). 
A consistent pattern among the countries “falling behind” is a particularly sharp drop in the 
1980s, followed by more or less of a leveling off after 2000.

If poor countries are “converging” 
or “catching up” to rich countries, 
their incomes should be rising 
when expressed as a percentage 
of rich country incomes. This 
has happened for South Korea, 
China, and Botswana, and also 
for India, but much more slowly. 
Brazil, Bolivia, Nigeria, and the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
in contrast, all fell farther behind 
over the period 1980–2005.

CHAPTER 32 — HOW ECONOMIES GROW AND DEVELOP
One encouraging fact is that since 2000 there has been signiﬁcantly more progress toward 
convergence, driven mainly by rapid growth in China and India but occurring in other countries 
also. According to one recent study, “the last decade witnessed a sharp reversal from a pattern 
of divergence to convergence—particularly for a set of large middle-income countries.”1 But 
even if convergence is sustained, global inequalities will continue for a long time. The United 
Nations notes that were “high income countries to stop growing today and Latin America 
and sub-Saharan Africa to continue on their current growth trajectories, it would take Latin 
America until 2177 and Africa until 2236 to catch up.”2
How rapidly are countries growing now? Figure 32.5 summarizes a wealth of information 
about economic growth across countries since 1980. The horizontal axis measures GDP 
per capita in 2011, in constant chained 2005, PPP-adjusted dollars. The size of the spheres 
is proportional to the population of the country represented, so that the United States is a 
medium-size sphere, while China and India—together, home to nearly 40 percent of the 
world’s population—are represented by very large spheres. Spheres on the right represent 
the United States and other industrialized countries, and spheres on the left represent poorer  
countries.
The vertical axis measures average annual real GDP per capita growth rates from 1980 
to 2011. Thus more rapidly growing countries, including China, India, and South Korea, are 
high on the graph, while slower-growing countries are represented by spheres closer to the 
horizontal axis. Some countries have experienced negative growth—that is, their levels of 
income per person have actually fallen in recent years after adjusting for inﬂation. High-
income countries have generally experienced moderate, positive average growth rates (on 
the order of 1 percent to 2 percent), while growth rates diverge much more as one moves 
down the income scale. For developing countries, average growth rates diverge dramatically 
(ranging from 10 percent for China down to –3 percent for D.R. Congo).
China and India represent the “good news” side of the development story. Although many 
people in these countries remain very poor, at least the trend is going in the right direction. 
Because of strong growth in these two very populous countries, a large number of people 
have been lifted out of poverty in recent decades.
The countries of sub-Saharan Africa, which have been hit particularly hard by AIDS and 
war, account for a substantial proportion of the very low and negative growth rates (e.g., Côte 
d’Ivoire and D.R. Congo). This is the very “bad news” side of the contemporary development. 
Far from “developing,” such countries have actually become poorer in recent decades.

2.2 THE VARIETY OF SOURCES OF ECONOMIC GROWTH
What accounts for the striking differences in economic fortunes across countries? If there 
were just one simple story about how economic growth occurs, economic analysis would be 
much easier. In fact, however, one can point to a great variety of factors, all of which may 
play a role in development. But their signiﬁcance—and even the direction of their effect, 
positive or negative—may vary greatly from country to country. For this reason, it is impos-
sible to make all-encompassing statements about why many developing countries have failed 
to achieve sustained growth. The following observations summarize a range of reasons for 
growth; their relevance varies from one situation to another.
Natural Resources
Often, one of the ﬁrst things that students of development think of is the role of natural re-
sources. Indeed, large expanses of arable land, rich mineral and energy resources, good natural 
port facilities, and a healthy climate may make it easier for a country to prosper, while a poor 
natural endowment, such as a climate that makes a country prone to malaria or drought, can 
be a serious drag on development. But the historical record includes some surprises. Hong 
Kong and Singapore have prosperous trade-based economies, even though they have scant 
domestic resources, with little land or energy of their own.
In fact, the overexploitation of natural resources can lead both to environmental degradation 
and to economic distortion. Countries such as Nigeria have found that oil reserves, seemingly 
a source of wealth, can easily be misappropriated with very damaging effects on development. 
Misdirected oil revenues can lead to massive corruption and waste. Other sectors of the 
economy are starved of investment and resources, as available resources go primarily toward 
oil production. And because oil is an exhaustible resource, the country can eventually run out 
of oil and ﬁnd itself worse off than before. Nigeria’s experience is symbolic of what many 
have referred to as the “resource curse” (the idea that countries endowed with abundant 
natural resources often do worse than countries with fewer resources).
Savings and Investment
Investment in manufactured capital requires ﬁnancial capital that, as we have seen, comes 
from savings. Yet investment in industrial manufactured capital is not the only important kind 
of investment. Investments in agriculture, through improvement of seeds, irrigation, and the 
like, are also essential to growth. Countries can also invest in human capital by improving 
their country’s systems of education and health care. Workers who are skilled and healthy are 
more able to be productive. Many economists stress that education in science and technology, 
in particular, is likely to have signiﬁcant effects on growth.
Additions to capital, however, do not automatically lead to growth. Technologies that are 
highly automated or “capital intensive” may sometimes be inappropriate in countries with 
an abundance of potential laborers. In such countries, more appropriate investments might 
be made in technologies that make greater use of its abundant potential workers—in other 
words, technologies that are more “labor intensive.”
This claim is not without some controversy, because goods produced under labor-intensive 
processes tend to be less sophisticated and high tech and therefore promise less export 
revenue than other products made with modern equipment. Indeed, one of the conﬂicts 
regularly confronted by developing countries is the need to balance economic diversiﬁcation 
(especially into “higher-end” products) with the need to provide employment opportunities 
for its population. There is also a signiﬁcant tension between the motivations to provide 
more sophisticated products for export vs. products that will be of more use to people in the 
country. In extreme cases, countries export food that their people cannot afford to buy for 
themselves.

CHAPTER 32 — HOW ECONOMIES GROW AND DEVELOP
Allocation of Investment 
According to market theory, investors should be attracted to the most proﬁtable opportunities. 
But market allocation of investment alone may ignore social priorities and will not necessarily 
contribute much to the development of infrastructure (things like roads, ports, railroads, and 
electronic networks). These and other important public goods such as environmental quality 
and water supplies require a public role in directing investment.*
In addition to investing in public goods, governments have often played a role in planning 
other industrial investments. Known as industrial policy, this approach can involve promoting 
particular industries, using tariffs, subsidies, and other economic tools as needed, even when 
this implies active government modiﬁcation of market outcomes. These tools may be applied 
to protect or subsidize industries that are not yet competitive, in the hope that they may become 
so over time; this is sometimes referred to as an infant industry policy.
Virtually all currently high-income countries used such policies in earlier stages of growth. 
Britain and the United States consciously formulated tariff policies to encourage domestic 
industries. Similar industrial policies employed by Japan and the Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, 
Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan) were essential to their rapid development between the 
1960s and 1990s. Ironically, Western countries that aggressively used industrial policies in 
earlier stages of development now often preach free trade and ﬁscal reform to others. As noted 
earlier, this has led to charges of hypocrisy with regard to developed countries that seem to 
want to “kick away the ladder” for later industrializers.
Foreign Sources of Financial Capital 
If a country is not able to ﬁnance the investments it needs for development out of its own 
domestic savings, it generally seeks grants, loans, or investments from abroad. The sources 
of foreign capital for development can be either public or private. Public aid for development 
can take the form of either bilateral assistance or multilateral assistance. Bilateral develop-
ment assistance consists of grants or loans made by a rich country’s government to a poorer 
country. Many developing countries also receive multilateral development assistance from 
institutions such as the World Bank and regional development banks such as the Inter-American 
Development Bank and UN agencies such as the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP). Countries may also borrow from the IMF, particularly during times of crisis.
Private foreign investment is carried out by private companies or individuals. Foreign 
direct investment (FDI) occurs when a company or individual acquires or creates assets for 
its own business operations (e.g., a German company building a factory to produce televisions 
in Mexico). FDI may or may not actually increase the capital stock in the recipient country, 
because it can include acquisitions of existing capital. Private ﬂows also include loans from 
private banks. From 2000 to 2010, private ﬂows of investment to developing countries 
increased dramatically, from $200 billion to more than $1 trillion, but have since leveled off 
at about $700–800 billion.3
The empirical evidence concerning the contribution of public and private foreign capital to 
economic growth is mixed. Some of the countries that are still among the poorest have also 
been the heaviest recipients of concessional aid (meaning aid without any requirements for 
repayment). In some cases, aid went to corrupt leaders who spent it on their own luxurious 
lifestyles rather than on beneﬁts for their people. Many poor countries are now highly indebted 
and spend more on debt service (payment of principal and interest) than on health care for 
their population.
Foreign investment can sometimes play an essential role in spurring development, but 
welcoming foreign businesses also can have a downside. When a large, powerful transnational 
corporation moves into a developing country, it may “crowd out” local initiatives, by

competing with them for ﬁnance, inputs, or markets, sometimes in effect replacing a viable, 
though small-scale, local business sector with an international corporation producing for 
international sales. It may also be disruptive politically or culturally. Some of the most 
oppressive actions in development history (such as peasants being forced off their land or 
union organizers repressed with violence) have come about through alliances between large 
transnational corporations and corrupt governments.
Domestic Demand vs. Export Orientation 
Because there would be little point in increasing production if what is made cannot ﬁnd a 
market, the level of aggregate demand in an economy is also of great importance for growth. 
One reason that developing countries sometimes fail to achieve sustained growth is that, 
while production for export is emphasized, not enough is done to develop domestic markets. 
There are counterexamples to this statement: countries such as Japan and South Korea broke 
into the ranks of more advanced economies by developing powerful export industries, and 
China is now following this same path. But export dependence can become a trap that stiﬂes 
economic development when countries depend on exporting products for which world demand 
is limited. Producers of agricultural exports, in particular, often suffer when world terms of 
trade turn against them, so that the value of what they can sell on the world market drops 
relative to the value of what they want to import.
Financial, Legal, and Regulatory Institutions 
Recently, policymakers have gained a greater appreciation of the role played by ﬁnancial, legal, 
and regulatory institutions (which ﬁt into the category of social capital) in encouraging—or 
discouraging—growth. Very poor countries sometimes have banking and legal systems that do not 
reach very far into rural areas and provide credit only for the well-connected or well-to-do, mak-
ing it difﬁcult for small businesses and entrepreneurs to ﬁnance new or growing enterprises. The 
experience of Russia, where GDP fell more than 40 percent during its emergence from communism 
in the 1990s, highlighted the need for markets to be based in a good institutional framework.
Countries that have been successful in maintaining growth generally have effective systems 
of property rights and contract enforcement, which allow entrepreneurs to beneﬁt from their 
investments, as well as effective corporate and bank regulation. Even in the case of property 
rights, however, the conventional wisdom does not always hold. China and Vietnam, for example, 
have been able to attract signiﬁcant amounts of investment, even though, being at least nominally 
still communist countries, they do not have systems of private property rights. Nevertheless, 
they are able to assure ﬁrms that they will beneﬁt from their investments by other means.
Some developing countries suffer from severe corruption, internal conﬂict, and other 
factors that make it difﬁcult for effective institutions to take root. Political instability leads to 
economic inefﬁciency, difﬁculty in attracting foreign investment, and slow or no growth. This, 
in turn, means that less saving is available for future investment, reinforcing the problems. 
Breaking this vicious cycle is essential for development but can be very difﬁcult to do.
2.3 DIFFERENT KINDS OF ECONOMIES
The previous section focused on the importance of investment—whether in agriculture or 
industrialization, in human and social capital, or in technology, infrastructure, or other physi-
cal capital. This raises the question: Who decides what are the most important investments to 
make? Should investment decisions be left to private markets or controlled by the government 
or some combination of the two? Historical experience offers a number of models.
The most extreme form of government control, represented by the experience of the Soviet 
Union from 1917 to 1989 and often referred to as a “command economy,” has generally been 
discredited as an economic model. Its achievements in areas such as military production and 
terms of trade: the 
price of exports rela-
tive to imports

CHAPTER 32 — HOW ECONOMIES GROW AND DEVELOP
some public goods (such as the Moscow subway system and elements of public education) 
came at a terrible human cost. Comparisons of Communist North Korea and East Germany 
with market-oriented South Korea and West Germany showed starkly that markets had a far 
better chance of achieving a more humane kind of development.
However, these alternatives are not, in fact, the only possibilities. Indeed, there are not only 
differences between market and command economies, but within each of these categories 
there is more than one alternative—and relative development successes or failures do not all 
fall neatly into one place. We can categorize economic organizations according to forms of 
ownership, making a basic distinction between capitalist vs. socialist economies. Then we 
may further subdivide each of these.
Capitalism is a system characterized by predominantly private ownership of productive 
assets; owners may be either private individuals or businesses. Under laissez-faire capitalism, 
the role of the state is supposed to be relatively small; at least in theory, it is conﬁned to 
maintaining a legal-institutional environment conducive to corporate ownership and market 
exchange. The United States and the United Kingdom are the two advanced countries that lie 
closest to this end of the spectrum. In contrast, administrative capitalism involves a more 
substantial amount of state activity alongside market-coordinated activity. Japan, France, and 
the Scandinavian countries ﬁt this description. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have 
tended to be somewhere in the middle, between these two varieties of capitalism.
Socialism is a system that relies much more on public ownership, where the owners may 
be either government or various kinds of cooperatives. The former Soviet Union and North 
Korea exemplify administrative socialism, which centralizes a very large proportion of 
economic power in the government. In contrast, China and Vietnam have been experimenting 
with a hybrid—market socialism—that keeps political power centralized with state ownership 
predominating, but releases a growing amount of economic decision-making power to market 
forces.
Which of these systems is most conducive to development? And what kind of development? 
To compare the success of various types of economies, review some of the data presented 
in Chapter 0. How do the laissez-faire economies of the United States and United Kingdom 
perform compared to the administrative capitalist economics of Japan, France, and the 
Scandinavian countries? Or to the market socialism of China or Vietnam?
Consider the clearly economic categories (2 through 7 in Chapter 0): recent growth rate 
of GDP per capita; net national savings; government debt; labor productivity; average annual 
hours worked; and unemployment rate. Or what about the more well-being-related categories 
of income inequality: Internet users; educational performance; life expectancy; and subjective 
well-being—how do the different types of economies compare in these respects? Finally, 
consider the last two categories (CO2 emissions per capita and local air quality), which say 
something about the hidden environmental and health costs of high levels of production and 
consumption.
Clearly, there is not a single winner. The United States does relatively well in some areas: 
It is among the world’s richest countries and has very high labor productivity and currently 
low inﬂation. It performs poorly on some other measures. The U.S. savings rate is near the 
bottom. Especially when compared to other developed countries, U.S. educational performance 
is mediocre, life expectancy is somewhat shorter, and inequality is relatively high.
If you look at the ranking of the countries whose economies are described as administrative 
capitalism (for example, Japan and the Scandinavian countries), you will ﬁnd a different 
pattern—one that, to some people, looks appealing in terms of greater equality as well as 
health and educational measures.* And China, the nearly unique exemplar of market socialism, 
is virtually in a class by itself. Its extraordinarily high savings and GDP growth rates make

it the winner among major countries in those categories. Its debt is low and its trade balance 
positive. But its income inequality, which used to be very low, has climbed to equal that of 
the United States. While China has a developing middle class, it still has many extremely 
poor people. On the environmental front, as is well known, it has become a major emitter 
not only of greenhouse gases but also of other harmful pollutants.
The debate on development continues. As the experience of the twentieth century reveals, 
there is nothing “automatic” about achieving sustained growth and a high standard of living. 
Undoubtedly, a combination of market and government-led policies will be used as countries 
continue to strive to develop. The unsettled question is how to determine the combination that 
will work best for a particular country and how best to promote a combination of goals that 
include economic development and social well-being. The fact that each country is unique 
and therefore requires a unique “playbook” of strategies makes the task of development 
economists all the more challenging.
Discussion Questions
1. Do you think that the economic challenges faced by developing countries today are the 
same as those faced by industrialized countries when they were starting out? If not, how 
are they different?
2.  Think of a poor country that you know a little about—even if what you know is just where 
it is on a world map and who its neighbors are. Considering the varieties of sources of 
economic growth, where would you propose starting to design a development plan for 
that country?
3. UNDERSTANDING POVERTY
From the early days of development economics, the eradication of poverty has always been 
a goal—sometimes the primary goal, at other times taking second or third place to other 
goals, but always an important consideration. However, the understanding of poverty is not 
as obvious as might at ﬁrst appear. This section uses the lens of measurement to show how 
different groups have tried to understand the issue.
3.1 GDP GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION
There is a close relationship between the goals that we set ourselves and the metrics that 
we use to assess where we are and how well we are progressing toward our goals. Joining a 
growing (new) consensus, the IMF and World Bank have replaced their focus on “structural 
adjustment” with an emphasis on “poverty-reduction” policies that are intended to give coun-
tries more voice in creating their own development solutions.* To reach such a goal, the ﬁrst 
requirement is to deﬁne and measure the thing that we want to change.
As noted earlier, the simplest way of deﬁning poverty is according to average income, 
or GDP per capita. Yet averages hide a great deal. An average GDP per capita of $9,000 
could exist in a country where most people are able to cover their basic needs for nutrition, 
basic health care, and shelter, along with some access to education and communications. 
Alternatively, most of the people in such a country could be living in dire poverty, with 
a small percentage being quite rich, leading to the same average GPD per capita of 
$9,000. We must therefore consider some other poverty measures, as additional ways of 
understanding where economic growth is most needed and what role it plays in the larger 
topic of development.
One common approach is to deﬁne poverty as the percentage of the population below what 
is known as the poverty line. One international poverty line that is often used as a minimum

poverty line: the 
income threshold be-
low which members 
of a population are 
classiﬁed as poor

734 
CHAPTER 32 — HOW ECONOMIES GROW AND DEVELOP
standard to escape extreme poverty is $1.25 per day. According to this measure, many 
developing countries experiencing at least modest growth rates have succeeded in reducing 
the incidence of poverty in their countries. For example, from 1984 to 2010, Mexico had an 
average annual growth rate in per capita GDP of only 0.8 percent, yet this was sufﬁcient to 
reduce its poverty rate from 12.8 to less than 1 percent (Table 32.3). And Brazil more than 
halved its poverty rate from 1981 to 2009 despite a growth rate of only 1.1 percent. Of the 
countries shown, Nigeria is the only one experiencing growth and an increase in poverty.
In comparing countries, it is necessary to use a universal standard, such as the $1.25-per-day 
threshold on which the poverty rates shown in the table are based. Almost all countries also 
have their own (national) poverty line—the threshold for the United States, for example, is 
about $20,000 per year for a family of four—and calculate their national poverty rate based 
on it. While not useful for comparing across countries, the advantage of a national poverty 
line is that it allows a country to deﬁne poverty according to its own standard of living. An 
income that classiﬁed someone as poor in the United States would almost certainly not be 
considered living at the poverty level in India. The international standard of $1.25 per day 
may help in classifying poor countries, but would be useless for rich countries, where the 
poverty rate using this standard would be nearly zero.
Both approaches are typically referred to as “headcount” measures, since they simply 
require the “counting” of people who fall below the poverty line. But many ﬁnd that measuring 
poverty based exclusively on income reﬂects only a small part of the poverty picture. In what 
follows, we consider a more broad-based measure of poverty.
3.2 THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY INDEX
Amartya Sen, a Nobel prize–winning economist, has argued that basing poverty on income 
deﬁciencies is exceedingly narrow and often does not provide an accurate picture of how poor 
a population may be. He has proposed that one’s capabilities—that is, the opportunities that 
people have to be well-nourished, decently housed, have access to education, and in many 
other ways live lives that they ﬁnd worthwhile—are more important than a simple income 
measure. Sen emphasizes the goal of enlarging people’s choices, which depends fundamen-
tally on building their capabilities.
The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), based on Sen’s work, was developed in 2010 
by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative for the United Nations Development 
Programme’s Human Development Report. The MPI considers several elements that are

critical for a decent life, in the areas of physical living standards, education, and health, as 
outlined in a study by Oxford University (see Box 32.1). Although the 10 items on the list are 
not the only essentials, they are good proxies; people who do not have these can reasonably 
be considered deprived, or poor.
The study found that a total of 1.6 billion people are living in multidimensional poverty. 
This is more than 30 percent of the people living in the 104 countries surveyed. Among these, 
South Asia leads the world in poverty, with between 52 percent and 62 percent of those deﬁned 
in the MPI as being in the world’s bottom billion.* About 40 percent of the total are in India. 
Most of the rest live in sub-Saharan Africa, which is home to between 33 percent and 39 
percent of the poorest billion. Of the 104 countries in the survey, only four—Belarus, Hungary, 
Slovenia, and Slovakia—were not home to any of the poorest billion people. Surprisingly, 
41,000 of the poorest billion people live in countries deﬁned, in this study, as high income: 
Croatia, Estonia, United Arab Emirates, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Czech Republic.
*The imprecision is due to three alternative regional divisions used: national, subnational, and individual.
BOX 32.1 HOW THE MPI DEFINITION OF POVERTY IS CONSTRUCTED
A person is identiﬁed as multidimensionally poor 
if he or she is deprived in one third or more of the 
following weighted indicators:

at 1/6)

components: (1) Incidence, the percentage of people 
who are disadvantaged (or the headcount ratio, H); 
and (2) Intensity of people’s deprivation, the average 
share of dimensions in which disadvantaged people 
are deprived (A). Thus MPI = HxA.

It is interesting to compare the results of the MPI study with the “less than $1.25 a day” 
(income-poor) approach. In some countries, there are large discrepancies between the 
percentage of the population that is “MPI poor” and the percentage that is income poor. At one 
end of the scale are the countries that are the least poor in MPI terms. Three of these—Ecuador, 
Macedonia, and Georgia—are nevertheless identiﬁed as having between 10 percent and 20 
percent of their population earning less than $1.25 a day.

736 
CHAPTER 32 — HOW ECONOMIES GROW AND DEVELOP
The two largest discrepancies in the middle group are China, with nearly 30 percent below 
$1.25, but only a little over 10 percent MPI poor; and Swaziland, with over 40 percent income 
poor, but about 20 percent MPI poor.
As we survey the poorest countries (on both scales), which are mostly in Africa, we ﬁnd 
that the proportions of the population suffering from MPI deprivation tend to be greater than 
the proportions living below $1.25 a day. Exceptions include Nigeria, with more than 50 
percent MPI poor but nearly 70 percent income poor, and Madagascar, with nearly 70 percent 
MPI poor but more than 80 percent income poor.
Such discrepancies reveal the potential limitations in relying exclusively on income-based 
poverty measures. Clearly, based on the Oxford study, being above the income poverty line 
is neither necessary nor sufﬁcient for escaping multidimensional deprivation. If income is a 
means to an end, and the “ends” include the health, education, and physical living standards 
criteria outlined in the MPI report, then multidimensional poverty may be more relevant than 
income poverty in the assessment of deprivation within countries. As we see in the following 
section, this “multidimensionality” is also present in any evaluation of a country’s progress 
in achieving development.
3.3 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS
There are alternatives to measuring development primarily in terms of GDP. Bearing in mind 
the “capabilities” approach and multidimensional approaches to deﬁning poverty, some have 
argued that development should be geared primarily to meeting basic needs for food, shelter, 
and health care. The human development approach includes attention to such basic needs 
but goes further to encompass other dimensions of a worthwhile life. 
Recent UNDP reports have, for example, examined how widespread, socially accepted 
domestic violence limits the human development of women in many regions and how human 
development may be limited by political oppression along ethnic or other lines. Such issues 
affect countries with high material standards of living, as well as those still unable to supply 
basic goods.
In September 2000, the member states of the United Nations unanimously declared their 
intention to try to reach a set of development objectives called the Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs). These goals focus on improvements in the life of the very poorest people 
in the world, emphasizing food security, education, gender equity, and health care (see Box 
32.2). The MDGs include mention of environmental sustainability (discussed in Chapter 33). 
Most of the goals set a deadline of 2015 for achievement.
Each of the eight main goals, such as “reduce child mortality,” is accompanied by one or 
more speciﬁc targets, such as “reduce the under-ﬁve mortality rate by two-thirds between 
1990 and 2015.” These targets, in turn, may relate to a number of policy actions, such as 
increasing education for mothers, vaccinating against measles, and distributing malaria-
ﬁghting mosquito nets. The eighth goal, “develop a global partnership for development,” 
points to some policies that the richer countries should enact. They include eliminating tariff 
barriers to poor countries’ products, canceling or restructuring debts, increasing foreign aid, 
easing the ﬂow of essential drugs, and sharing technology.
As a high-proﬁle, speciﬁc commitment of UN members, the MDG declaration has served 
to increase the global attention paid to the promotion of human development. Some have 
nevertheless criticized the MDGs, believing that the goals do not go far enough in addressing 
inequalities and injustices between rich and poor countries. And although the MDGs are a 
noble statement of intent, the follow-through on them since their declaration in 2000 has 
had mixed results.
For example, while the UN claims that the ﬁrst MDG of halving the proportion of people 
living on less than $1.25 a day was met three years before the target date, progress has been 
very uneven. While regions such as North Africa and East Asia have seen considerable gains,

conditions in Oceania (Paciﬁc islands) and parts of sub-Saharan Africa have deteriorated (see 
Figure 32.5 and Table 32.3). In fact, were it not for poverty reduction in two countries—China 
and India—the picture would look far less optimistic.
According to the UN’s Millennium Development Goals Report 2013, “big gains have 
been made in health. Between 2000 and 2010, mortality rates from malaria fell by more 
than 25 percent globally, and an estimated 1.1 million deaths were averted. Death rates from 
tuberculosis could be halved by 2015, compared to 1990 levels.”4 While new HIV/AIDS 
infections are declining, an estimated 34 million people were living with HIV in 2011. 
8 million people in developing regions were receiving antiretroviral therapy, and the price 
of anti-HIV drugs has been brought down. 
While there has been progress in reducing child and maternal mortality rates, improving 
school enrollments, and expanding access to sanitation, the U.N. report notes that 57 million 
children still do not have access to primary education, and 2.5 billion people still lack 
improved sanitation facilities. According to the report, “progress towards the eight MDGs 
has been uneven not only among regions and countries, but also between population groups 
within countries.” 
Debts are being cancelled for nineteen of the very poorest highly indebted countries, 
but they remain a burden for many others. Only ﬁve countries (all European) have met 
the UN target for offering international aid of at least 0.7 percent of GDP; overall, net aid 
disbursements have declined, especially for the least developed countries. The Doha round 
of World Trade Organization negotiations, intended to achieve reforms that would help 
developing countries, remains stalled after more than ten years.
Little progress has been made in opening up rich country markets to the products of poorer 
countries. The spread of some kinds of technology (particularly cell phones) has been rapid 
in some areas, but a technological gulf between rich and poor countries persists. In short, 
while there has been progress in certain areas, it is not clear that poor countries as a whole 
are “converging” to the levels of human development enjoyed in the industrialized world. 
For many countries, it seems that the opposite is true.
In addition to inadequate funding, another reason for limited success in achieving the 
MDGs may be a degree of incompatibility between its goals and the macroeconomic

CHAPTER 32 — HOW ECONOMIES GROW AND DEVELOP
strategies employed by donor countries and multinational agencies, such as the IMF and 
the World Bank. The MDGs were derived from the UN work in deﬁning and assessing 
human development. While, as noted above, the World Bank and IMF have recently 
shifted their focus to incorporate poverty reduction, for much of the last several decades 
development efforts were still dominated by the “neoliberal” Washington Consensus 
(discussed above).*
The neoliberal strategy was poorly suited to achieving the MDGs because, in effect, 
it has different goals (see Box 32.3). It does not concern itself with issues that are 
central to the UN concept of human development, such as care for children and the 
aged, inequality in general, or gender equity, including intra-household distribution of 
income and assets.**
 *“Neoliberal” here refers to market-oriented development theory. It is derived from an older sense of the word “liberal,” 
meaning freeing markets from government controls. This can be confusing since “liberal” in politics today often means using 
government action to help the poor.
**“Intra-household distribution” refers to the role of women in managing household income and assets. Often control over 
income and assets remains in the hands of men, while women are required to do most of the household labor.
BOX 32.3 COMPARISON OF NEOLIBERAL AND UNITED NATIONS APPROACHES  
TO DEVELOPMENT
Multilateral agencies in charge of development have 
often acted at cross purposes, with public statements 
of goals coming from the United Nations but imple-
mentation carried out by agencies with a “neoliberal” 
orientation towards development. Some of the differ-
ences were summarized in a UN Brieﬁng Note written 
by advocates of the human development approach:
The human development approach emphasizes 
three areas of concern. First, it underlines the need 
for the inclusion of a broader group of govern-
mental and nongovernmental actors in decision-
making processes. In government, policy-making 
cannot be left to economic and ﬁnancial decision 
makers alone. Other ministries or departments, 
particularly those concerned with nutrition, health, 
and education, need to be a part of the process. 
Outside government, local communities need to 
be included to ensure a human focus and a clear 
understanding of available options.
 
Second, the human development approach 
broadens the scope of indicators used to monitor 
development. In place of neoliberalism’s sharp 
focus on economic and ﬁnancial indicators as a 
means to human ends, human development relies 
on a wider range of human and social indicators 
that are given primary place as ends in themselves. 
Thus special importance is given to indicators 
that track the human situation: life expectancy, 
nutritional status, and ultimately of well-being 
and happiness. In this regard, human develop-
ment is similar to the basic needs approach of the 
1970s.
 
Third, there are differences in the two ap-
proaches that reﬂect different attitudes toward 
international policy. The urgency of human de-
velopment needs requires stronger international 
action and more rapid and ﬂexible support, ﬁnan-
cially in access to markets and in other forms such 
as peace operations. Moreover, the values and 
principles at the heart of the human development 
approach extend far beyond neoliberalism’s pre-
occupation with economic efﬁciency and include 
human rights, justice, and human solidarity.

Discussion Questions
1. Do you think the categories in the Multidimensional Index of Poverty do a good job of reﬂect-
ing who is truly poor? If you were asked to add one item to this list, what would it be?
2. Do you think the Millennium Development Goals realistic or achievable? What does the 
mixed success in achieving them so far say about current development policies?

4. INEQUALITY
We have discussed the issue of inequality between countries. Also important is the level 
of inequality within countries. As we have seen, many countries have very high levels of 
inequality (as measured by the Gini coefﬁcent, discussed in Chapter 11), meaning that the 
poorest 40 percent of the population receive a meager share of national income, while in other 
countries the “pie” is more equally shared. Apart from any potential ethical issues, inequality 
within countries should concern us if it signiﬁcantly inﬂuences a given country’s prospects 
of achieving sustained growth and development.
4.1 GROWTH, INEQUALITY, AND THE KUZNETS CURVE
Although economic growth and poverty reduction have most often been the primary goals 
of development, there have also been many thinkers—in philosophy as well as in econom-
ics and other social sciences and humanities—who have placed equality, equity, or fairness 
high on their list of end goals: objects worth achieving for their own sake. Yet not everyone 
considers such matters paramount, especially economists. For some, equality is regarded as 
an intermediate goal—something worth achieving if it leads to other desirable outcomes. And 
some have argued that inequality may have a role to play at least at some stages in efforts 
toward economic development.
Although we saw in Chapter 11 that the extent of income inequality within countries is 
highly variable, it turns out that world income inequality is more extreme than in any individual 
country. In Figure 32.6, the world’s population is organized into successive income quintiles, 
each representing 20 percent of the world’s population. Thus the bottom quintile represents 
the poorest 20 percent of humanity, the next quintile represents the second-poorest 20 percent, 
and so on. The area associated with each quintile is in proportion to how much of the world’s 
income they receive. Remarkably, 82.8 percent of the world’s income goes to the richest 20 
percent. Meanwhile, the poorest 40 percent receive only 3.1 percent of the world’s income. 
This outcome is a product of both growing income inequality within many countries and 
growing inequality between countries (e.g., poor countries “falling behind”).

The “champagne glass” shape of the world’s 
income distribution is based on over 80 percent 
of the world’s income going to the top 20 
percent of the world’s population, while the 
poorest 20 percent get only 1 percent of total 
income.

CHAPTER 32 — HOW ECONOMIES GROW AND DEVELOP
Early in the history of development theory, Simon Kuznets (the same economist who 
initiated work on National Income and Product Accounts, as discussed in Chapter 20) 
discussed the issue of inequality in a famous paper.5 He proposed that during the initial 
stages of economic growth, inequality would increase as investment opportunities created a 
wealthy class, while an inﬂux of rural laborers into cities would keep wages low. Eventually, 
according to Kuznets, further industrialization would lead to democratization, widespread 
increases in education, and safety-net policies that would lead to lower inequality. This 
Kuznets curve hypothesis suggests an inverted-U relationship between economic growth 
and inequality—inequality would ﬁrst rise, then fall, with economic growth.
Some countries’ development paths roughly correspond to the Kuznets curve hypothesis, 
especially the early industrializers, such as England, France, Sweden, and Germany—however, 
the evidence is more mixed when we consider a broader range of countries. Some countries, 
such as Norway, Japan, and South Korea, have experienced economic growth with a continual 
decrease in economic inequality. And as we have seen in earlier chapters, economic growth 
in the United States since the 1970s has been associated with an increase in inequality, which 
also contradicts the basic Kuznets curve hypothesis.6
Although the Kuznets curve hypothesis looks primarily at the inﬂuence of economic growth 
on inequality, we can also look at the relationship in the opposite direction—how the level of 
inequality inﬂuences economic growth. Here the evidence is also mixed: Some studies ﬁnd that 
countries that are highly unequal at the start of development have a difﬁcult time achieving 
rapid growth, and others support the view that inequality correlates positively with growth. 
The latter conclusion conforms to a view sometimes associated with traditional economics: 
that the existence of economic inequality creates an incentive for hard work, thereby helping 
the economy grow. In other words, if the economic outcomes in a society were too equal, 
there would be little reason to seek to improve one’s economic situation.
More recently, however, economists have debated whether the high level of inequality in 
the United States is slowing the recovery from the Great Recession. Nobel prize–winning 
economist Joseph Stiglitz, for example, argues that in the recent case of the United States, 
high inequality impedes economic recovery. He claims that the U.S. middle class is now 
weaker than in the past and is therefore unable to fuel a recovery adequately with consumer 
spending. A weakened middle class is also less likely to invest sufﬁciently in education or 
start enough new businesses.
According to research by the IMF, inequality is associated with greater economic 
instability.7 It may be no coincidence that the most signiﬁcant economic downturns in the 
United States over the past 100 years, the Great Depression and the Great Recession, both 
occurred during peaks of inequality. As we saw in Chapter 11, the United States is the most 
economically unequal among the industrialized countries.
Others, such as Paul Krugman (another Nobel prize–winning economist), believe that it is 
not income inequality per se that impedes economic recovery. The problem is that extreme 
income inequality gives rise to political inequality, and this is what can impede recoveries. 
Krugman suggests that the slow economic recovery is due mostly to political problems. 
According to this view, wealthy individuals and powerful corporations in the United States, 
interested in their own economic welfare and wielding signiﬁcant political power, can 
effectively prevent the policies that would promote a broad-based economic recovery (see 
Box 32.4 and Figure 32.7).
According to a recent OECD report,8 such policies for broad-based recovery should 
include:
1. Promoting education: policies that increase high school and college graduation rates as 
well as policies that promote equal access to education, reduce inequality, and increase 
long-term economic growth.
Kuznets curve hy-
pothesis: the theory 
that economic in-
equality ﬁrst increases 
during the initial 
stages of economic 
development but then 
eventually decreases 
with further eco-
nomic growth

BOX 32.4 A UNITED STATES RECOVERY FOR THE 1 PERCENT
As the U.S. economy gradually recovered from the 
impact of the Great Recession of 2007–9, a dis-
proportionate share of the economic gains went to 
the wealthiest Americans. While incomes for typical 
American households remained ﬂat and the percent-
age in poverty did not decline, those who were already 
wealthy improved their position further.
From 2009 to 2012, average real income per 
family grew modestly by 6.0%. However, the gains 
were very uneven. Top 1% incomes grew by 31.4%, 
while bottom 99% income grew by only 0.4% from 
2009 to 2012. Hence, the top 1% captured 95% 
of the income gains in the ﬁrst three years of the 
recovery. (Saez, 2013)
As a result, overall U.S. inequality increased to re-
cord levels. This raised questions about the durability 
of the recovery, since an economically healthy middle 
class is important for maintaining a stable level of ag-
gregate demand. Economist Paul Krugman suggests 
that the rich, comfortable with a situation that “has 
been dismal for workers but not at all bad for the 
wealthy,” oppose the kinds of policies that would favor 
more distribution of income to the middle class and 
low income families (Krugman, 2013). Historically, 
periods of high inequality in U.S. history, during the 
1920s and recently, have been associated with the 
economic instability of the Great Depression and the 
Great Recession (see Figure 32.7).
 
The pay gap between the richest 1 percent and 
the rest of America widened [in 2012], making a 
record. The top 1 percent of U.S. earners collected 
19.3 percent of household income in 2012, their 
largest share in Internal Revenue Service ﬁgures 
going back a century. (Wiseman, 2013) 
The top 10 percent of earners took more than half 
of the country’s total income in 2012, according 
to an updated study by economist Emmanuel Saez 
and Thomas Piketty. . . . The economy remains 
depressed for most wage-earning families. With 
sustained, relatively high rates of unemployment, 
businesses are under no pressure to raise their 
employees’ incomes because both workers and 
employers know that many people without jobs 
would be willing to work for less. The share of 
Americans working or looking for work is at its 
lowest in 35 years. (Lowrey, 2013)

CHAPTER 32 — HOW ECONOMIES GROW AND DEVELOP
2. Well-designed labor market policies and institutions: For example, as long as the mini-
mum wage is not too high to reduce overall employment signiﬁcantly, it can reduce wage 
inequality. Strong unions can also reduce wage inequality.
3. Immigration and discrimination policies: Policies that promote the integration of im-
migrants and that prohibit all forms of discrimination reduce inequality and can increase 
growth.
4. Tax policies: Eliminating tax loopholes that beneﬁt primarily high-income households, 
such as the mortgage interest deduction, would increase the overall progressivity of the 
tax system and allow for a reduction in marginal tax rates, which increase the incentive 
for working.
The OECD report notes that some policies to promote economic growth are likely to 
increase inequality, such as shifting from taxation of income to taxation of consumption, 
using a sales tax or value-added tax (VAT)*. Thus the challenge becomes one of identifying 
policies that offer “win-win” outcomes—that is, those that promote both GDP growth and a 
reduction in the degree of income inequality.
Up to what point should inequality be reduced? Just as no one would be likely to 
advocate the extreme position of “the more inequality the better,” few would support the 
idea of attempting to achieve perfectly equal income distribution throughout a society. 
Yet there is widespread concern that inequality has become excessive in many countries. 
High inequality exists in many developing countries but has also become increasingly 
evident in the United States. As noted, the evidence remains inconclusive regarding its 
effect on growth. But when we broaden our scope to consider the well-being aspects of 
development, instead of just economic growth, the negative effects of inequality become 
more apparent.
4.2 RECENT STUDIES OF INEQUALITY
Even if the relationship between income inequality and GDP growth remains somewhat 
ambiguous, the same is not true for the relationship between inequality and broad-based well-
being. Countries that are more unequal in terms of income generally perform more poorly 
on many well-being indicators.
One way in which inequality affects people is in its impact on population health. Figure 
32.8 plots one proxy for health—average life expectancies—against GDP per capita, with 
spheres, as before, proportional to the population of the country represented. A curve is 
drawn to ﬁt the general pattern made by the data points. Looking at the far left-hand side 
of the ﬁgure, it is clear that living in a very poor country, such as Nigeria, dramatically 
increases the chance that one will die prematurely, compared with living in a country with 
somewhat higher GDP/capita, such as India or China. On the left-hand portion of the 
graph, we can see that substantial inequality between countries plays an important role in 
determining longevity.
In the middle section of the graph, moving from left to right, we see countries such as 
Mexico, which has achieved a life expectancy fairly close to those of the richest countries, 
even though its average income per capita is not even half as high. But South Africa lies far 
below the line, reﬂecting a case in which inequality makes it difﬁcult to translate a moderate 
average level of income into well-being and longevity.
Looking at the spheres representing Western Europe, Japan, and the United States at the 
right-hand side of the ﬁgure, we see that the positive relationship between income and life 
expectancy essentially disappears. At high incomes, in fact, inequality within countries—not 
*A value-added tax, or VAT, is imposed on the net value added in an industry (revenues minus costs of intermediate 
inputs). The concept of value added was discussed in Chapter 20. 

 
INEQUALITY 
743
income per capita—may be an important factor in determining health and life expectancy. 
For example, according to a recent study, despite the fact that the average U.S. citizen can 
expect to live about 77 years on average—which is considerably better than the global 
average of about 70 years—U.S. life expectancy is lower than most other (generally more 
equal) industrialized countries, which are in the 78- to 82-year range. Infant mortality also 
appears to be higher in countries with greater inequality.9 The authors of this study argue 
that inequality is positively associated with a range of negative social outcomes, including 
mental health and incidence of violence.
Another recent study emphasizes the enormous inequality between countries in outcomes 
other than income: 
The differences in life expectancy between countries dwarf those between different 
groups within countries. (This is true for income inequality, too.) There is an eight-
year difference in life expectancy between Japanese women (86.1 years) and Japanese 
men (78.0 years), but both Japanese men and women can expect to live almost twice 
as long as a newborn in the countries with the lowest life expectancy in sub-Saharan 
Africa (Zambia, Angola, and Swaziland).
Infant mortality rates—which are the main drivers of differences in life expectancy 
between rich and poor countries—vary from 3 per 1,000 in Iceland and Singapore to 
more than 150 per 1,000 in Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, and Angola. In 1990, more than a 
quarter of children in Mali did not live to see their ﬁfth birthdays, a marked improvement 
over 1960, when around half died in childhood—or put even more starkly, when median 
life expectancy at birth was only ﬁve years. 10
Thus it seems clear that a special focus of development should be on increasing incomes 
for the poorest and eliminating the kinds of inequality that lead to major human suffering. 
These goals needs to be balanced with the more general objectives of development discussed 
above in Sections 1 and 2.

per head, increases in per 
capita income are associated 
with steep increases in life 
expectancy. After a middle-
income level of per capita 
GDP is reached, however, 
increases in income are 
associated with much more 
modest increases in life 
expectancy, and at high 
incomes the relationship 
ﬂattens out.

CHAPTER 32 — HOW ECONOMIES GROW AND DEVELOP
4.3 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
Over the past century, the world has seen dramatic economic growth, but the beneﬁts of this 
growth have been unevenly distributed. Some developing countries, such as India and China, 
have experienced rapid growth rates.* Others, such as most countries in sub-Saharan Africa 
and some countries in Latin America and Central Asia, are still struggling with low, or even 
negative, growth rates. In terms of living standards and well-being, much of the world’s 
population has been left out of the signiﬁcant progress that appears in aggregate statistics. In 
the future, further development is clearly essential but simple models of economic growth 
may fail to capture important elements of the development challenge (see Box 32.5).
A growing number of development economists recognize the need to rethink development 
more in the direction of broad-based human development, with increased emphasis on 
inequality at all levels of development. For those suffering material deprivation, GDP growth 
is often, but not always or only, the ﬁrst solution and policies to achieve GDP growth should 
be balanced with promotion of human development goals.
There is another important reason for a shift in paradigms regarding economic development. 
We cannot assume that indeﬁnite GDP growth will in the long term be ecologically sustainable. 
This is the focus of Chapter 33, in which we consider some of the issues relating to the 
environmental and resource limits that we face in the twenty-ﬁrst century.
*Both China and India experienced extremely high growth rates of up to 10% per year or more during the decade 
2000–2010, although growth rates in both countries have recently slowed somewhat. See http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/
NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG
BOX 32.5 COMPARING INDIA AND CHINA IN HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
Both India and China have experienced rapid eco-
nomic growth since 2000, but there are signiﬁcant 
differences in their human development levels. Nobel 
Prize winner Amartya Sen, who originated the “ca-
pabilities” approach to development, comments that 
the most signiﬁcant gap between China and India is 
not in growth rates but in the provision of essential 
public services:
Inequality is high in both countries, but China has 
done far more than India to raise life expectancy, 
expand general education, and secure health 
care for its people. India has elite schools of vary-
ing degrees of excellence for the privileged, but 
among all Indians 7 or older, nearly one in ﬁve 
males and one in every three females are illiterate. 
And most schools are of low quality; less than half 
the children can divide 20 by 5, even after four 
years of schooling. . . . The poor have to rely on 
low-quality—and sometimes exploitative—private 
medical care, because there isn’t enough decent 
public care. . . .
 
India’s underperformance can be traced to a 
failure to learn from the examples of so-called Asian 
economic development, in which rapid expansion 
of human capability is both a goal in itself and an 
integral element in achieving rapid growth. 
Despite a lack of democratic process in China, its 
leaders have placed a priority on eliminating hunger, 
illiteracy, and medical neglect. According to Sen, if 
India is to match China’s economic record, it needs 
a “better-educated and healthier labor force at all 
levels of society,” as well as “more knowledge and 
public discussion about the nature and huge extent 
of inequality and its damaging consequences for 
economic growth.”

33 Growth and Sustainability in the 
Twenty-First Century
What will the world be like in 2050 or 2100? Will the world situation be characterized as 
one of widespread material afﬂuence and social peace? Or will the gap between the “haves” 
and the “have-nots” be even bigger and the planet afﬂicted by widespread social conﬂict 
and environmental damage? Of course, no one can foresee the future. But we can at least 
consider how some especially pressing social and environmental challenges will affect the 
macroeconomics of the future.
1. MACROECONOMIC GOALS: LOOKING FORWARD
As we have seen throughout this text, macroeconomics is, at its base, concerned with human 
well-being. The goals of macroeconomic institutions and policies are (as described in Chapter 
1) the achievement of good living standards; stability and security; and ﬁnancial, social, and 
ecological sustainability.
Much of traditional macroeconomics, as we have seen, tends to focus on the stability and 
growth rate of real GDP. To the extent that growth in GDP leads to growth in well-being, 
this is a sensible strategy. But as we saw in Chapter 21 on alternative national accounts, GDP 
does not measure or report on many important issues of well-being such as environmental 
deterioration, unpaid home production, and inequality in the distribution of wealth and income. 
GDP rises when there is increased production of goods that are damaging to society or the 
environment or that simply make up for damage already done. A narrow focus on stability and 
growth in GDP also ignores changes in the conditions of work, stresses imposed on families, 
and developments in the social and ﬁnancial infrastructure of an economy.
Some people believe that continued GDP growth and technological innovation will solve 
the social and environmental problems of the present and future. Others, however, believe 
that many of the social problems of today—including environmental degradation, growing 
inequality, and inadequacies in health care, child care, and education—can be traced to the 
fact that existing forms of economic growth and development have in some ways worked 
against “true” or sustainable well-being.
In Chapter 32, we examined concepts of human development, based on a broader perspective 
suggesting that economic growth alone is not sufﬁcient—though it is often necessary—for 
fostering and maintaining human well-being. In this chapter, we look at a second challenge to 
standard economic growth, relating to the impacts of economic growth on the environment and 
the extent to which ﬁnite planetary limits might make unlimited GDP growth infeasible.
2. MACROECONOMICS AND ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY
In Chapter 32, we noted that world economic production has more than tripled since the early 
1970s. Further economic growth is clearly desirable in developing countries to improve the 

748 
CHAPTER 33 — GROWTH AND SUSTAINABILITY IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
well-being of more than a billion people who are now living in desperate poverty. Continued 
economic growth has been a principal policy objective in industrialized countries.
But as the twenty-ﬁrst century proceeds, we must consider whether it is possible, or 
even desirable, to continue along the economic growth trajectory of the twentieth century. 
Economic growth has been accompanied by an increasing demand for natural resources, 
as well as increases in waste, pollution, and ecosystem damages. Many ecologists warn us 
that the current scale of human impact on the natural world is already unsustainable. Yet the 
ecological implications of a further doubling, quadrupling, or more, of human economic 
activity is an issue that, to date, has received little attention from macroeconomists.*
In this section, we consider the implications of current environmental issues for economic 
growth and development. First, we present an overview of some of the most pressing 
global environmental problems. Then we explore the relationship between economic 
growth and environmental quality and discuss policies to promote ecologically sustainable 
development.
2.1 MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
A number of environmental issues are closely related to economic growth, including: 
Global Population 
Economic and technological growth since the Industrial Revolution has fostered a dramatic 
increase in world population. Global population was approximately 1 billion in 1800, increased 
to 2 billion around 1930 and 3 billion in 1960. In 2000, it increased to 6 billion, and in 2011 
it passed 7 billion. Human population growth contributes to increases in many environmental 
pressures, including those related to food production. Although so far intensiﬁcation of food 
production has kept pace with population growth, it has led to signiﬁcant costs in terms of land 
degradation, pollution from fertilizers and pesticides, and overtaxing of water supplies.
Global population growth rates are currently declining, and many projections indicate 
that the human population will peak sometime in the twenty-ﬁrst century (see Appendix). 
A stable or declining global population would eventually ease environmental pressures, but 
a substantial population increase is still predicted in the coming decades. Medium-range 
projections by the United Nations show a global population of 9.2 billion people in 2050, 
with almost all future population growth occurring in developing countries.
Resource Depletion
As noted in Chapters 22 and 32, depletion of important renewable and nonrenewable re-
sources has accompanied economic growth. Many of the world’s ﬁsheries are in decline due 
to overﬁshing. Tropical forests are being lost at a rapid rate. Nearly a billion people live in 
countries where usable water is in scarce supply and water sources continue to be overdrawn 
and polluted. Stocks of key mineral resources, such as aluminum and copper, are for the most 
part not close to exhaustion, but high-quality reserves are being depleted, and recovery of 
lower-quality reserves tends to involve higher energy and environmental costs.
Probably no other natural resource has been more critical for modern economic growth than 
fossil fuels. These fuels (oil, coal, and natural gas) currently provide more than 80 percent 
of global energy supplies. The U.S. Department of Energy projects that global demand for 
fossil-fuel energy will increase approximately 60 percent between 2006 and 2030. However, 
many estimates suggest that global production of conventional oil, the most-used energy 
source, will peak within the next few decades. While “unconventional” sources of oil and 
gas, such as shale oil and natural gas obtained through hydraulic fracturing or “fracking,” 
*At a GDP growth rate of 3 percent, a doubling of GDP takes about 24 years. A quadrupling would take 48 years.

 
MACROECONOMICS AND ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY 
749
may expand supplies, these sources are likely to be more expensive and come at higher 
environmental cost. All of these fuels contribute to CO2 emissions that cause global climate 
change (discussed in detail below). Given the current dependence on fossil fuels, limitations 
on their use, for economic or environmental reasons, could challenge both the potential for 
industrialized countries to maintain their living standards and for developing countries to 
reduce poverty.
Pollution and Wastes 
As discussed in Chapter 21, damage from pollution is not reﬂected in traditional national ac-
counting measures, even though it clearly reduces welfare. Industrial countries generate the 
vast majority of the world’s pollution and waste. Although rich countries are home to only 
about one-sixth of the world’s population, they generate about two-thirds of global industrial 
wastes by volume. But pollution also jeopardizes economic development in poorer countries. 
For example, a 2006 “Green GDP” estimate for China indicated that environmental costs 
amounted to between 3 percent and 10 percent of China’s GDP. A 2007 estimate by the World 
Bank and China’s State Environmental protection Agency put air and water pollution costs 
alone at 5.8 percent of GDP.1
In some cases, toxic wastes are exported from industrialized countries to low-income 
countries that need the income they earn as compensation for accepting wastes but are ill 
equipped to receive and process them. Rapid future development will mean that pollution 
and waste management problems, both domestic and trade-related, are likely to grow, despite 
efforts to control them with environmental regulations.
2.2 THE RACE BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY AND RESOURCE DEPLETION
In the history of economic development, when one resource became scarce, another has been 
found to replace it. Thus, as wood and whale oil became scarce as energy sources, fossil fuels 
were discovered and developed to take their place. Another example is the development of a 
variety of plastics that have replaced metal or wood inputs in countless products. Even when 
resources are abundant, there may be substitutes (or potential substitutes) that can be used 
more inexpensively. Much of the story of economic growth is associated with productivity 
gains from being able to produce goods and services with progressively cheaper resources.
Yet there is some debate about possible limits to such a process. Some “technological 
optimists” believe that human ingenuity is virtually limitless and that humans will always be 
capable of ﬁnding economic substitutes for existing resources, as they grow scarcer. But do 
substitutes exist for all resources? And are some resources more essential than others?
There is no substitute for potable fresh water, which is absolutely essential for humans and 
many other species. Even where a resource is not essential and substitutes are conceivable, it 
may be necessary to contend with the difﬁculty of obtaining the substitutes and the associated 
costs in terms of money or energy.
The minerals sector is an example of a signiﬁcant area in which costs have recently been 
rising. Mineral prices increased signiﬁcantly from 2000 to 2012, and growing demand from 
developing economies suggests that they may continue to rise over the medium to long 
term.
Copper is one important mineral for which technology had seemed for a long time to be 
winning the race against resource depletion. Plastic has replaced copper in many uses, such 
as plumbing, and plastic ﬁber-optic cables (as well as wireless technologies) have displaced 
copper wires for long-distance information transmission. Yet global demand for copper 
continues to grow, and copper prices tripled between 2000 and 2012. Copper in the ground 
remains in reasonably plentiful supply, but what is left to mine is of lower quality than what 
has already been taken. This is economically and ecologically important because when ore 
quality drops, more energy is typically required to extract and reﬁne it. And generally the 

750 
CHAPTER 33 — GROWTH AND SUSTAINABILITY IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
more energy-intensive the extraction of the mineral is, the more adverse the environmental 
impacts (e.g., pollution) that are produced.
Another important example is phosphorus, which is a critical input in the fertilizer used 
in the mass production of food. It has no known substitutes and there are no synthetic ways 
of creating it. Researchers are therefore focusing on methods of reducing dependence on the 
element or looking for ways of reusing it, conserving it at the point of use, or recycling it 
from plant and animal wastes.
2.3 A BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLE: FISH STOCKS
Unlike minerals, ﬁsh are a renewable or reproducible resource. Yet renewable does not mean 
inexhaustible: It is quite possible for us to run out of ﬁsh in the wild if we harvest them more 
rapidly than they are able to reproduce.
Many deep-sea ﬁsh (e.g., Atlantic halibut, blueﬁn tuna, and cod) are seriously depleted. If 
the danger is recognized early enough, and steps are taken to reduce ﬁshing activity sufﬁciently 
in areas where they spawn, ﬁsh populations can often recover. Canada imposed an indeﬁnite 
moratorium on cod ﬁshing in 1992, and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act, passed in the United States in 1996, limited the allowable catch for dozens 
of species. About half of them are recovering, but many species, including cod and ﬂounder, 
are still in danger. Many other species around the world suffer from overﬁshing as well as 
habitat destruction. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, 80 
percent of the world’s marine ﬁsh stocks are fully exploited or overexploited.2
Ironically, technological change has contributed to the decline. The introduction of bigger 
boats, sonar technology for ﬁnding ﬁsh, and large-scale “drift nets” have all increased depletion 
rates. Increasing scarcity has raised the market price for most wild-caught ﬁsh, generating 
incentives to expand aquaculture (ﬁsh farming). But there are also adverse ecological 
impacts from aquaculture, especially with the farming of saltwater species, such as shrimp 
and salmon. Five pounds of wild-caught ﬁsh are used as feedstock in the production of each 
pound of farmed salmon, while shrimp farming has led to widespread destruction of coastal 
mangrove forests.
Discussion Questions
1. Are you concerned about the future impacts of population growth and resource and 
environmental impacts? Do you think there should be some limits to population and/or 
economic growth?
2. Do you consider yourself a “technological optimist”? Do you believe that natural resource 
constraints represent a serious threat to economic production in the future? If so, which 
resources do you think we should be most concerned about?
3. CLIMATE CHANGE
The resource and environmental issues discussed above all pose serious problems. But perhaps 
the primary environmental challenge of the twenty-ﬁrst century is global climate change. 
Global climate change combines issues of resource use and environmental impact, and is 
strongly related to economic growth.
3.1 GREENHOUSE EMISSIONS AND GLOBAL TEMPERATURE CHANGE
Recent research, summarized in a 2007 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC), has virtually eliminated any doubts that human activities are affecting the 
earth’s climate.3 Emissions of various greenhouse gases, particularly CO2, trap heat near the 
earth’s surface, leading not only to a general warming trend but to sea-level rise, ecological dis-
ruption, and an increase in severe weather events, such as hurricanes, ﬂoods, and droughts.

 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
751
Greenhouse gases persist for decades or more in the earth’s atmosphere. In addition, there 
is a lag between the time a gas is emitted and the time when its effects are fully realized. 
Thus, even if annual emissions of greenhouse gases were immediately stabilized at current 
levels, the concentration of these gases in the atmosphere would continue to rise, with effects 
such as sea-level rise continuing for centuries. Global emissions of greenhouse gases will 
eventually need to be reduced signiﬁcantly—as much as 80 or 90 percent lower than current 
levels by 2050—if we are to avoid the most dangerous effects of climate change. But, rather 
than declining, emissions of the major greenhouse gases are rising rapidly, primarily driven 
by fossil-fuel–based economic growth.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, global emissions of CO2 rose by 
35 percent between 2000 and 2011. Estimated U.S. emissions actually declined by 6 percent 
over the same period, partly as a result of the 2007–9 recession and partly due to a shift to 
less–carbon-intensive natural gas. While U.S. emissions per person remain far higher than 
those in developing countries such as China and India, rapid growth in these countries accounts 
for a steady rise in emissions, which can be expected to continue for years to come.
Predicting the precise effects of climate change is subject to substantial uncertainty. The 
IPCC report summarizes the predictions of various climate change models. They reported a 
range in which the average global temperature was expected to be between 1.1° and 6.4° C  
(2.0 ° and 11.5° F) warmer in 2100 compared to preindustrial levels, with the most likely range 
being between 1.8° C and 4° C (3° F to 7° F). This range of possible temperature increases 
is shown in Figure 33.1. 
The likely effects of a 2° C increase in global average temperature (towards the lower end 
of the projected range) include:

A report sponsored by the British government in 2006 ﬁnds that, under a “business-as-usual” 
(BAU) scenario, there is at least a 50 percent chance of an average temperature increase of 
more than 5°C (9°F) by the early twenty-second century. Climate change of this magnitude 
could lead to catastrophic effects such as the irreversible melting of the Greenland ice sheet, 
the collapse of the Amazon forest, and ﬂooding of major cities including London and New 
York (see Box 33.1).
This report speciﬁcally examined the economics of climate change. It estimates the costs of 
climate change in the twenty-ﬁrst century as between 5 percent and 20 percent of global GDP, 
while the most severe effects of climate change could be avoided at a cost of approximately 
1 percent of GDP. Thus, the report concludes that it appears that the beneﬁts of immediate 
action to minimize climate change signiﬁcantly exceed the costs (see Box 33.1).
Although the most dangerous impacts of climate change are not likely to occur for several 
decades or more, the actions taken in the next few decades will almost surely have a profound 
effect on those ultimate impacts. Delaying action for even a decade would lead to a greater 
risk of catastrophic effects. This has signiﬁcant implications for global equity. The impacts 
BOX 33.1 THE STERN REVIEW—THE ECONOMICS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
Published in October 2006, the British government 
report written by former World Bank chief economist 
Nicholas Stern presents an urgent case for strong and 
immediate action to respond to the threat of global 
climate change. According to this report:
The scientiﬁc evidence is now overwhelming: cli-
mate change presents very serious global risks, and 
it demands an urgent global response. . . . Under 
a BAU [business as usual] scenario, the stock of 
greenhouse gases could more than treble by the 
end of the century, giving at least a 50 percent 
risk of exceeding 5°C global average temperature 
change during the following decades. This would 
take humans into unknown territory. An illustra-
tion of the scale of such an increase is that we are 
now only around 5°C warmer than in the last ice 
age. Such changes would transform the physical 
geography of the world. A radical change in the 
physical geography of the world must have power-
ful implications for the human geography—where 
people live, and how they live their lives.
 
The evidence gathered by the Review leads to a 
simple conclusion: the beneﬁts of strong, early ac
tion considerably outweigh the costs. The evidence 
shows that ignoring climate change will eventually 
damage economic growth. Our actions over the 
coming few decades could create risks of major dis-
ruption to economic and social activity, later in this 
century and in the next, on a scale similar to those 
associated with the great wars and the economic 
depression of the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century. 
And it will be difﬁcult or impossible to reverse these 
changes. Tackling climate change is the pro-growth 
strategy for the longer term, and it can be done in 
a way that does not cap the aspirations for growth 
of rich or poor countries. The earlier effective action 
is taken, the less costly it will be.
 
In summary, analyses that take into account 
the full ranges of both impacts and possible 
outcomes—that is, that employ the basic eco-
nomics of risk—suggest that BAU climate change 
will reduce welfare by an amount equivalent to a 
reduction in consumption per head of between 5 
and 20 percent. Taking account of the increasing 
scientiﬁc evidence of greater risks, of aversion to 
the possibilities of catastrophe, and of a broader 
approach to the consequences than implied by 
narrow output measures, the appropriate estimate 
is likely to be in the upper part of this range. . . . It 
is still possible to avoid the worst impacts of climate 
change; but it requires strong and urgent collective 
action. Delay would be costly and dangerous.

of climate change—including coastal ﬂooding, agricultural yield reductions, spreading of 
tropical diseases, and water shortages—are poised to fall disproportionately on the developing 
countries. While the rich countries would, to some extent, be able to adapt to many of the effects 
of climate change, most developing countries lack the ﬁnancial and technical resources to do 
so. The 2007 IPCC report notes that climate change is likely to exacerbate global inequalities 
and impede economic development in poorer countries.
3.2 NATIONAL AND GLOBAL RESPONSES TO THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE
Because many modern environmental problems are global in scope, they require a coordi-
nated international response. The challenge of global climate change presents an illustration 
of how difﬁcult this can be in practice. The Kyoto Protocol, drafted in 1997, committed 
industrialized countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 5 percent 
below their 1990 emissions in time for the period 2008–2012. But it was not until 2005 
that enough countries ratiﬁed the treaty to enable it to enter into force. The United States, 
the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, refused to ratify the treaty on the grounds 
that it would hurt the U.S. economy and because it does not bind developing countries to 
any emissions targets. Many of the countries that had ratiﬁed the treaty, moreover, did not 
meet their emissions targets.
International negotiations have tried to draft a “roadmap” for a new treaty to succeed the 
Kyoto Protocol since it expired in 2012. But although negotiators generally agree that “deep 
cuts” in greenhouse gas emissions are necessary, they have failed to agree on ﬁrm emissions 
targets or to decide on how to allocate responsibility between developing and industrialized 
countries.
The best hope for avoiding the worst impacts of climate change is to replace fossil-
fuel energy sources with plentiful, less ecologically destructive resources, such as wind 
and solar power. There is also great potential to reduce energy demand through greater 
efﬁciency. Currently, technological progress reduces energy use per unit GDP by about 
2 percent per year in the United States and other advanced countries. But combined with 
an economic growth rate of about 3 percent per year, this still results in about a 1 percent 
per year increase in energy use. Doubling the rate of energy efﬁciency gain would mean 
a 1 percent decrease in energy use per year—making it much easier to achieve carbon 
emissions reduction targets.
Opportunities for reducing emissions are described in the 2013 Annual Energy Outlook 
report of the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Extended Policies case in this 
report shows that the United States could avoid an increase in greenhouse gas emissions 
between 2013 and 2040 by continuing a number of current policies, including the production 
tax credit for wind, geothermal, biomass, and hydroelectric power and the investment tax 
credit for solar and by updating and strengthening a number of other policies, including 
the fuel-economy standards for new cars and appliance efﬁciency standards. These policy 
extensions and updates would reduce projected greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 
6 percent by 2040.
3.3 THE COST OF RESPONDING VERSUS THE COST OF INACTION
A report from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, has estimated that 
$700 billion in public and private investments will be needed each year to shift the global 
economy away from its dependence on fossil fuels. There is growing interest in the idea 
of using a tax on carbon-based energy to raise some of these funds. The Tax Policy Center 
has reported that estimates of income from such a tax in the United States could range 
from 0.5 percent of the country’s GDP (for a tax of $15 per ton of CO2) to 0.8 percent of 
GDP (for a tax of $31 per ton of CO2). A tax of $31 per ton would translate to an extra 30 
cents per gallon of gas. The revenue raised would be about $120 million per year.4 (By 

754 
CHAPTER 33 — GROWTH AND SUSTAINABILITY IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
comparison, the Swiss economy is performing well even with an effective carbon tax rate 
of more than $140 per ton.)
Revenues raised by such a tax could be used to fund the transition to renewable energy. 
In addition a carbon tax would encourage people and businesses to use less energy, with 
reductions concentrated in the energy sources that produce the most carbon (and therefore 
would be most heavily taxed): coal ﬁrst, then petroleum, then natural gas—the latter 
being only half as carbon-intensive as coal but still a signiﬁcant contributor to climate 
change.
The most serious disadvantage to a carbon tax is that it would fall more heavily on the 
poor. The Congressional Budget Ofﬁce estimates that the poorest ﬁfth of Americans spend 
21.4 percent of their income on gas and utilities, while the richest 20 percent spend only 6.8 
percent. There are, however, several ways to respond to this, the most straightforward being 
a direct rebate of some of the tax revenues for those most in need. 
Some of the money raised through energy taxes could be used for disaster preparedness and 
relief. Climate change is already leading to higher cost from natural disasters. The drought of 
2012 in the Southern and Western United States, considered by many analysts to be a result 
of climate change, cost about $35 billion. The same year, Hurricane Sandy was responsible 
for at least $65 billion in damage. In 2013, severe ﬂooding in Colorado required evacuation 
of thousands and caused billions in damage. While no single climate event can be deﬁnitely 
linked to climate change, greater ﬂooding, drought, and more intense hurricanes are predicted 
effects of climate change. 
Although a large-scale energy transition away from fossil fuels would have signiﬁcant 
costs, they may be quite modest on a macroeconomic scale and should be balanced against the 
growing costs likely to be caused by climate change, including extreme weather, agricultural 
output losses, and possible effects of famine, armed conﬂict, and mass migration if large 
areas are affected by sea-level rise or desertiﬁcation. At the same time, looked at from the 
point of view of Keynesian macroeconomic analysis, the policies and actions suggested for 
preventing further climate change could bring potentially large economic beneﬁts in terms 
of employment creation.
Discussion Questions
1. How do you think we should evaluate the economic impacts of climate change? Check 
the short executive summary of the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change 
(see Box 33.1). Do you agree with the conclusions of the Report?
2. What do you think should be done by the United States in response to global climate 
change? Can you think of speciﬁc policies that would reduce carbon emissions without 
resulting in signiﬁcant economic disruption?
4. ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT
4.1 THE ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE HYPOTHESIS
Some researchers have suggested that, in the long run, economic development reduces per 
capita environmental damages. The logic behind this assertion is that sufﬁcient wealth and 
technology allow countries to adopt clean production methods and move to a service-based 
economy. Further, environmental quality is generally considered a “normal good,” meaning 
that people will demand more of it as they become wealthier. 
The environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis posits an inverted U-shaped 
relationship between economic development and environmental damages.* It states that 
*This hypothesis was not devised by Simon Kuznets but is similar to his hypothesis, discussed in Chapter 32, that 
inequality ﬁrst increases, then decreases with growing national wealth.

 
ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT 
755
environmental damage per capita increases in the early stages of economic development, 
reaches a maximum, and then diminishes as a country attains higher levels of income. If the 
evidence supported this hypothesis, it would imply that economic growth would eventually 
promote a cleaner environment.
Does this principle really work? The EKC relationship does seem to hold for some 
pollutants. Figure 33.2 shows the ﬁndings of a study that estimated the relationship between 
per capita sulfur dioxide emissions (the primary cause of “acid rain”) and a country’s per 
capita income. Sulfur dioxide emissions per capita appear to peak at an income level of 
around $5,000 and decline as incomes rise further. Studies of some other pollutants, mostly 
air pollutants, have also given limited support to the EKC hypothesis.
However, the EKC relationship does not appear to hold for many other environmental 
problems. Studies of municipal waste and energy use ﬁnd that environmental impacts generally 
continue to rise as incomes rise. Perhaps most importantly, CO2 emissions show a positive 
relationship with average income, as shown by the upward-sloping trend line in Figure 33.3, with

CHAPTER 33 — GROWTH AND SUSTAINABILITY IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
no apparent turning point. This means that carbon emissions can be generally expected to increase 
as economies grow, unless current dependence on fossil-fuel energy is dramatically altered. 
Thus, contrary to the EKC hypothesis, economic growth appears unlikely to provide a 
guaranteed path to environmental sustainability. The relationship between growth and the 
environment is, in reality, more complex. Average income is not the only relevant factor 
in determining environmental impacts; the distribution of resources also plays a key role. 
Sustainable development needs to include reducing economic inequalities along with 
preserving the environment.
Some environmental damage, such as soil erosion and deforestation, may occur because 
poor people engage in unsustainable practices simply to survive. Programs to eliminate 
poverty in developing countries can provide people with choices that are less environmentally 
destructive. Meanwhile, environmental degradation typically hits the poorest people the 
hardest, because many rely heavily on the natural environment for their subsistence.
Policies that improve the environment can thus also serve to reduce poverty and economic 
inequality. The objectives of human development and environmental protection are 
actually interlinked. The promotion of human development in poor countries can improve 
environmental quality while policies to improve the environment can also reduce economic 
disparities. This suggests the need for a coordinated policy response that considers the linkages 
between human development and the environment.
4.2 POLICIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
Much of macroeconomic theory and policy is currently oriented toward promoting continuous 
economic growth. What kind of policies would be required to promote ecological sustain-
ability? How can these policies be designed to such that they also maintain well-being and 
promote human development, especially in developing countries?
Some ecologically oriented economists view “sustainable growth” as a contradiction in 
terms. They point out that no system can grow without limit. Yet it seems that some kinds 
of economic growth are essential. For the large number of people in the world who cannot 
satisfy their basic needs, for example, an increase in consumption of food, housing, and 
other goods is clearly required. For those who have already achieved a high level of material 
consumption, there are possibilities for continued improvements in well-being through 
expanded educational and cultural services that do not necessarily have a large negative 
environmental impact. But there is nothing in standard macroeconomics to guarantee that 
economic growth will be either equitable or environmentally benign. Speciﬁc policies for 
sustainable development are therefore needed.
What might such policies involve? There are numerous possibilities, including: 
Green Taxes
“Green” taxes make it more expensive to undertake activities that deplete important natural 
resources or contribute to environmental degradation. They discourage energy- and material-
intensive economic activities, while favoring the provision of services and labor-intensive 
industries. One example of a green tax, as discussed above, is a tax on the carbon content of 
energy supplies, favoring renewables and efﬁciency over carbon-based fuels. All countries 
have implemented environmentally based taxes to some extent. As shown in Figure 33.4, 
environmental taxes in industrial countries can range from 3.5 percent to over 10 percent of 
total tax revenues.
Green taxes are strongly supported by economic theory as a means of internalizing negative 
externalities such as pollution. When a negative externality such as pollution exists, an 
unregulated market will result in an inefﬁcient allocation (as discussed in Chapter 13). Because 
all taxes, in addition to raising revenue, discourage the “taxed” activity, it is economically 
desirable to discourage “bads” such as environmental pollution and natural resource depletion 

 
ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT 
757
by placing taxes on them, rather than on positive economic activities like investment and 
the earning of income.
Two common objections to green taxes frequently arise. First, it is likely that green taxes 
would fall disproportionately on lower-income households. But as noted earlier, a rebate or 
credit to these households could be implemented to avoid making a green tax regressive. 
The other criticism is that green taxes are politically unpopular—no one wants higher taxes. 
Increases in green taxes can be offset, however, by reductions in other taxes (such as income 
taxes) so that the tax burden on a typical household remains unchanged. Also, households and 
businesses would have the option to lower the amount of green taxes they pay by undertaking 
energy conservation measures and other environmentally friendly practices, which is not the 
case with other income or business taxes.
Eliminating Subsidies
Agricultural and energy subsidies that encourage the overuse of energy, fertilizer, pesticides, 
and irrigation water could be reduced or eliminated. This would reduce government expen-
ditures, and the money saved could be used to lower taxes or to promote more sustainable 
agricultural systems that rely on the recycling of nutrients, crop diversiﬁcation, the use of 
natural pest controls, and minimizing the use of artiﬁcial chemicals and fertilizer. Such systems 
also tend to be more labor-intensive, so they also have the potential to boost employment.
Recycling and Renewable Energy
Policies such as deposit/refund systems or targeted subsidies can be used to promote greater 
recycling of materials and the use of renewable energy. Through research and development 
grants, subsidies, and tax breaks, governments can support the expansion of energy from so-
lar power, wind, and geothermal heat. Strategic public investment in new technologies such 
as fuel cells and high-efﬁciency industrial systems can eventually make these technologies 
cost-competitive.
Tradable Permits
Tradable permit systems (often called “cap-and-trade”) can set an overall limit on pollution by 
offering a limited number of permits allowing the emission of speciﬁc quantities and types of 
pollution. These plans are based on the principle that a process of pollution reduction may be

most efﬁciently achieved by allowing businesses to choose between ﬁnding low-cost ways to 
reduce their emissions and paying to buy permits. After the permits are distributed to ﬁrms, 
they can then buy them from or sell them to other ﬁrms. Pollution reduction will occur ﬁrst 
where it can be done most economically.
This efﬁciency characteristic makes tradable permit systems popular among economists. 
Although environmentalists have sometimes objected, on principle, to the idea of government 
issuing “permits to pollute,” it is recognized that tradable permits have been used successfully 
in several instances, most notably in reducing sulfur dioxide emissions in the United States. 
Such permits can also be purchased by environmental groups or private citizens in order 
to retire them and thus reduce the overall level of pollution. Carbon trading systems apply 
the same principle to carbon reduction, and have been implemented in Europe, the U.S. 
Northeast, and California. 
Efﬁcient transportation systems can replace energy-intensive automotive transport with 
high-speed trains, public transit, greater use of bicycles, and redesign of cities and suburbs to 
minimize transportation needs. In countries such as the United States, where automobile-centered 
systems are already extensively developed, the use of highly fuel-efﬁcient cars can reduce fuel 
needs; in some developing countries, automobile dependence might be avoided altogether.
Debt-for-Nature Swaps
Debt-for-nature swaps work by forgiving the debt of developing countries in exchange for 
agreements to protect nature reserves or pursue environmentally friendly policies. For ex-
ample, in 2002 the United States canceled $5.5 million in debt owed to it by Peru in return 
for Peru’s agreement to conserve 10 rainforest areas covering more than 27.5 million acres. 
This innovative form of international ﬁscal policy was authorized by the Tropical Forest 
Conservation Act of 1998.
4.3 SUSTAINABILITY AND CONSUMPTION
As discussed earlier, global inequalities currently mean that many people in the world have 
too little to live on, while others consume at high levels. Some theorists have suggested re-
placing the goal of ever-increasing consumption with the goal of sufﬁciency. This idea can be 
developed at two levels. At the individual level is the question of the amount of consumption 
that is sufﬁcient to support human well-being. At the macro or global level is the question of 
what kinds and amounts of consumption can be sustained, by humanity as a whole, without 
destructive environmental consequences. Note that the second question includes two different 
issues: the kinds of consumption and the aggregate quantities consumed.
Alan Durning, the author of How Much Is Enough: The Consumer Society and the Future of 
the Earth, has proposed dividing the global population into three groups classiﬁed according to 
their consumption levels and environmental impacts.5 Table 33.1 presents a similar classiﬁcation 
using updated data. We see that energy use, carbon emissions, and vehicle use are all much 
lower for those in the global lower-income class than in the rest of the world. Although these 
households are often forced to undertake ecologically unsustainable actions simply to survive, 
their overall impact on global environmental problems is relatively minor.
The global “middle class” uses more resources than the poor, but its lifestyle is still 
relatively environmentally sustainable. Those in this class rely primarily on bicycles and 
public transportation, eat a grain-based diet, and use a moderate amount of energy. Durning 
suggests that the entire world population could live at this level of afﬂuence without exceeding 
the ecological capacity of the planet. 
The global upper-income class relies on private vehicles and air transportation, eats a diet 
including daily consumption of meat, and uses a signiﬁcantly higher amount of energy than 
the other classes. The rest of the world could not possibly emulate the lifestyle of this class 
without exceeding the capacity of the global environment.

 
ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT 
759
The problem may not be as irresolvable as it appears. In addition to the question of what 
is possible—that is, ecologically sustainable—we need to ask what is desirable. In rich 
countries, it has become increasingly important to recognize that “too much” can be just 
as much of a problem as “too little.” Increasing consumption may bring little beneﬁt and 
can actually be worse for individuals, who may suffer ill health from overeating, sedentary 
lifestyle and reliance on automobiles, and, according to some social scientists, spiritual 
malaise from exclusive or excessive attention to material things. At high income levels, 
other dimensions of human development, such as freedom from violence, closer and more 
peaceful families and communities, a satisfying work life or volunteer opportunities, cultural 
activities, and investments in the productive and creative capacities of the next generation 
may be more important than having more marketed goods and services. To the extent that 
we trade material consumption for these other objectives, sustainability becomes less of 
a challenge.
Moreover, a large portion of every country’s social and individual well-being depends on the 
maintenance of homes and families, including care of sick and elderly people, along with other 
productive activities that take place in homes and communities but are not bought and sold in 
formal markets (as discussed in Chapters 2 and 21). Many adults today feel squeezed between 
the demands of conventional, forty hours (or more) per week of paid employment and the time 
requirements of their families. As we saw in Chapter 10, full-time employment in Europe requires 
the equivalent of ﬁve fewer weeks of work per year, on average, than full-time employment 
in the United States. Europeans have in effect chosen to translate part of their increased labor 
productivity into increased leisure, instead of using it all to increase earnings and consumption. 
As shown in Figure 33.5, there is a tradeoff between leisure time and money earned, with one the 
opportunity cost for the other; where a country situates itself on the “consumption-possibilities 
frontier” depends on the culture and the prevailing attitudes toward work.
Economic practices that make people “rich” as consumers but “poor” as family and 
community members are not consistent with the human development goal of having the 
freedom to live a valuable life. They are also not ecologically sustainable in the long run, at 
least if every human on earth aspires to the highest levels of consumption. Fortunately, it is 
growing increasingly apparent that scaling back in the area of material consumption not only 
is good for the natural environment but also—at least beyond a certain level of income—can 
enhance our overall well-being.

CHAPTER 33 — GROWTH AND SUSTAINABILITY IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
4.4 SUSTAINABILITY AND INVESTMENT
If an ecological perspective implies limits on consumption, what happens to investment? As 
we have seen earlier in this book, investment spending has often been crucially important for 
aggregate demand and employment. Yet additional investments in traditional kinds of plant 
and equipment, which rely heavily on fossil fuels, may work against environmental sustain-
ability. This dilemma can be resolved only by forms of investment that improve well-being 
but do not increase what has been called throughput—the use of raw materials and energy 
as inputs, resulting in the creation of wastes as system outputs. The social and environmen-
tal challenges that have been outlined in this chapter suggest the need for large investment 
expenditures, many of which are not directly related to increasing material consumption. 
Rather than being a burden or threat, such investment expenditures may be the solution to 
maintaining employment with limited consumption.
As we saw in Chapter 32, many countries in the past used industrial policies successfully, 
to push an economy from one phase to another. The United States could not have gone 
from a mostly agrarian economy to an industrial one without government assistance in 
developing transportation and communication systems. Japan’s government carefully 
selected a sequence of industries to support, going from low-tech and labor-intensive to 
high-tech and information-intensive. All of the successful European, Asian, and North 
American economies have depended on essential support from national investments in 
education and public health. Many such investments are “public goods” (as discussed in 
Chapter 2) because, although they provide widespread beneﬁts, it is hard to collect payment 
from the people who beneﬁt from them; hence, if they are to occur, they must be supported 
through national action.
A similar set of strategic investments, focused on areas such as alternative energy, public 
transportation, sustainable agriculture, education, and health services could move countries 
toward a more environmentally sustainable economy. Such investments contribute to 
economically and environmentally positive development but may not pay the kind of return 
that would encourage private companies to undertake them. Yet with such strategic investments 
in place, the private sector can be relied on for much of the follow-through—much as, in the 
past, the U.S. government provided interstate highways, while the private sector supplied 
cars and trucks.
It is also important to remember that, as discussed in Chapter 21, “investments” should 
really refer to much more than just factories and equipment. Environmental policy is 
concerned with protecting, or avoiding disinvestment in, the global commons—the oceans, 
Figure 33.5 A Consumption Possibilities Frontier
The diagram illustrates the tradeoff 
between consumption and leisure time. 
Europeans on average live at a lower 
material standard than people in the 
United States, because they do not work 
as many hours, hence earn less income. 
On the plus side, they enjoy more leisure 
time, which Americans sacriﬁce in order 
to be able to consume more.

the atmosphere, the world’s store of living species, and other aspects of natural and social 
capital that greatly affect the possibilities and the quality of life for present and future 
human generations.
This kind of long-term investment requires a more future-oriented perspective than is 
used for most business investments. The use of market discount rates (see Box 33.2) tends 
to limit the planning horizons of most businesses and individuals to about twenty to thirty 
years. But long-term sustainability demands a generational perspective, because many of the 
most severe impacts of problems such as global climate change will take decades, or even 
centuries, to unfold.
Discussion Questions
1. How do you think your environmental impacts compare with those of the average person 
in the world?
2. Does reducing environmental impacts require sacriﬁce, or can it be done in ways that 
increase overall well-being?

BOX 33.2 DISCOUNTING THE FUTURE
In economic theory, future costs and beneﬁts are often 
evaluated with a technique called discounting. The 
theory behind discounting is that a dollar today is worth 
more than a dollar tomorrow—even after correcting for 
inﬂation. The discount rate, sometimes referred to as the 
“time discount rate,” is the annual rate at which dollar 
values are considered to change over time (this is a dif-
ferent, broader use of the term than the Federal Reserve’s 
discount rate offered to member banks, discussed in 
Chapter 26). Use of a discount rate often depends on 
the assumption that people of the future will be better off 
than people today—therefore, a dollar is worth more to 
us now than it will be to our great-grandchildren, even 
after accounting for possible inﬂation. For most com-
mercial and ﬁnancial calculations, the use of a discount 
rate makes sense. However, its application to social and 
environmental costs and beneﬁts is more complicated.
To illustrate the impact of discount rate calculations, at 
an 8 percent discount rate, $1.00 today becomes worth 
$1.08 next year and ($1.00) (1.0810) = $2.16 ten years 
from now. Similarly, $1.00 to be received ten years from 
now is worth only ($1.00)/(1.0810) = $0.46 today.
For longer periods, the impact of discounting 
becomes much more dramatic. The present value 
of $1,000 ﬁfty years from now is only $87.20 at a 5 
percent discount rate, and the value of $1,000 one 
hundred years from now is only $7.60. At a 10 per-
cent discount rate, the value of $1,000 one hundred 
years from now is only 7 cents! This would mean that, 
applying a discount rate of 10 percent, it is not worth 
spending more than 7 cents today to avoid $1,000 
worth of damages one hundred years from now. 
This has led to a serious criticism of the discounting 
approach. How can we justify a technique that might 
implicitly consider serious damages to future genera-
tions less important than moderate costs today?
Discounting is essential if we are considering the 
economics of, for example, taking out a mortgage to 
buy a house or a loan to ﬁnance a business investment. 
The beneﬁts of being able to own and live in the house 
starting today may well outweigh the future costs of 
paying interest on the mortgage over the next twenty 
years. Similarly, the income generated by the business 
investment can be compared to the annual payments on 
the loan—if the rate of return on the investment exceeds 
the discount rate, it brings net beneﬁts.
In such cases, it makes sense to use the commercial 
discount rate, determined in current markets, to com-
pare present and future costs and beneﬁts. But can 
we say that a GDP gain today, or in the near future, 
outweighs major damage in the next generation? How 
should we evaluate broader environmental impacts that 
will continue over long periods?
We can try to resolve the problem by deﬁning a 
 social discount rate—a rate that attempts to reﬂect 
the appropriate social valuation of future costs and ben-
eﬁts. Estimates of social discount rates vary but are usu-
ally signiﬁcantly lower than commercial discount rates 
and include a rate of zero. But, of course, private market 
actors such as corporations will base their decisions on 
the current market rate of interest, not a social discount 
rate. Public investments, by contrast, can be based on 
a judgment that the appropriate social discount rate is 
lower—which means that the future should be weighted 
more heavily. This might justify, for example, more in-
vestments in energy efﬁciency and carbon-free energy 
sources today, to avoid damages from climate change 
that are likely to occur in future decades.

CHAPTER 33 — GROWTH AND SUSTAINABILITY IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
5. ARE STABILIZATION AND SUSTAINABILITY IN CONFLICT?
Earlier chapters have emphasized that a high level of aggregate demand is necessary to sup-
port a high output level, keeping income levels up and unemployment down. Is this goal in 
conﬂict with the goal of environmental sustainability? In some ways, it appears that it is, given 
the evidence that we have reviewed on how environmental problems increase with higher 
consumption. But there may be ways to reconcile the goals of higher living standards, full 
employment, and environmental sustainability. To do so, we have to re-examine some of our 
assumptions about economic growth.
5.1 WHAT DO WE REALLY WANT FROM EMPLOYMENT?
The macroeconomic models that we have developed starting in Chapter 24 have implicitly 
assumed that more employment is better. There is no doubt that needing a job and not being 
able to ﬁnd one can be very tough on the unemployed. In addition to the lack of income—which 
can cause severe hardship and poverty for a worker and his or her family—unemployment can 
also have serious psychological repercussions. People often feel demoralized and depressed 
when they ﬁnd that they are not wanted. Studies of the effects on health and mortality of 
business cycle swings show that suicide rates rise during economic downturns (see Chapter 
30, Box 30.1). Clearly, a humane society should want to keep such suffering at a minimum, 
to the extent possible.
Rather than just thinking about “employment” and “unemployment,” perhaps 
macroeconomists should be thinking more about the quality, types, and intensity of 
employment that an economy offers and what these mean for people’s well-being. Being 
pushed out of the wage-earning system is clearly injurious to the involuntarily unemployed, 
and being deprived of sufﬁcient income is very tough on the working poor. But the solution 
need not mean that everyone should always work 40 or more hours a week.
As discussed in Chapter 23, people also beneﬁt from hours that they spend away from 
paid employment; this time provides opportunities to do unpaid work, including family care, 
and also to pursue leisure activities. It may be possible to keep employment levels high while 
reducing material and energy throughput, if we, as a society, think creatively enough about 
what sorts of, as well as how much, employment we really want.
The Dutch government, for example, responded to an economic downturn in the 1980s by 
stabilizing wages and allowing work hours to decline in order to reduce the unemployment 
rate. The idea, in other words, was to “share” available work hours among more people. New 
government employees were hired for four instead of ﬁve days per week. Other sectors soon 
followed, and eventually even Dutch banks adopted 80 percent schedules and a four-day 
workweek. In July 2000, the country passed the Working Hours Adjustment Act, landmark 
legislation that granted employees the right to reduce their weekly hours (even below 80 
percent in many cases) without losing their job or suffering a reduction in hourly pay or 
employment beneﬁts.6
In the same year, the French government reduced the standard workweek from 39 hours 
to 35 hours. Both the Dutch and French policies were motivated primarily by the desire to 
reduce the unemployment rate, but they also served to enhance workers’ quality of life by 
affording them more leisure time. Because more leisure time and lower earnings on average 
leads to less consumption (and less throughput), both policy initiatives are examples of 
innovative macroeconomic policy that takes into account both stabilization and sustainability 
concerns.
5.2 WHAT DO WE REALLY WANT FROM PRODUCTION?
The model that we developed in earlier chapters works only with the level of output, Y, and 
says nothing about the composition of output. From a sustainability perspective, however, 

 
ARE STABILIZATION AND SUSTAINABILITY IN CONFLICT? 
763
the composition of output makes a very big difference. Some things that we beneﬁt from 
and enjoy require relatively little use of material and energy inputs. Eating locally grown 
produce, taking a bike ride with friends, or engaging in educational and cultural activities, for 
example, puts little stress on the natural environment. Other activities, such as heating and 
furnishing a very large house, driving an SUV, or maintaining a perfect lawn using chemical 
fertilizer, have more negative impacts. Shifting away from producing goods and services that 
are most damaging to ecological systems and toward producing goods and services that are 
less destructive—or even environmentally beneﬁcial—could allow an economy to maintain 
consumption, investment, and employment in a less environmentally damaging way.
Another important macroeconomic issue relates to population stabilization. As discussed 
further in the Appendix to this chapter, the United States and many other countries in the 
world are already experiencing a growing ratio of retirees to active workers. Many elderly 
people need extra medical care and personal care. This suggests that while an economy may 
need to release some workers from high-throughput jobs for sustainability reasons, there will 
also be an increased demand for workers in medical and social services. 
Similarly, while some opportunities for investment would no longer be available in a more 
sustainable economy, many more would open up. Investments in energy-saving infrastructure 
for transportation, in wetland restoration, and in conversion of residential and commercial 
buildings to more environmentally friendly patterns of energy and chemical use, for example, 
would create additional employment opportunities. While employment might decline in fossil-
fuel and high-polluting industries, these possibilities for expanded job creation suggest that 
pursuing sustainability goals need not conﬂict with the goal of full employment.
The problems of transitioning to a more sustainable macroeconomy should not be 
minimized. People who build SUVs today, for example, cannot simply start building solar 
panels tomorrow—changes in human and manufactured capital must take place ﬁrst. But 
neither should these problems be enlarged out of proportion. Scientiﬁc evidence suggests 
that a conversion to a less resource-intensive economy is not a matter of if but, rather, a 
matter of when and how. And the longer the conversion is put off, the more difﬁcult it is 
likely to be.
5.3 SUSTAINABILITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL
Sustainable development does not depend only on national policies; it can also be developed from 
the bottom up, starting at the local level. Important aspects of local sustainability include*:
Democratization of Ownership
About 130 million Americans—40 percent of the population—are members of some form of 
one-person, one-vote cooperative. A program initiated by the federal government in the 1980s 
has resulted in about 11,000 employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), involving 10.3 million 
people, in virtually every sector, and some are very large and sophisticated. Three million 
more individuals are involved in worker-owned companies of this kind than are members of 
unions in the private sector.
In addition, thousands of “social enterprises” use democratized ownership both for 
proﬁtable production and to achieve a broader social purpose. By far, the most common 
social enterprise is the Community Development Corporation (CDC), numbering nearly 
5,000 in U.S. cities. For the most part, CDCs serve as low-income housing developers and 
incubators for small businesses.
Another form of democratized ownership involves a growing number of “land trusts”—
essentially nonproﬁt corporations that own housing and promote both conservation and low- 
*Many of the examples cited are drawn from Gar Alperovitz, What Then Must We Do? (White River Junction, VT: Chelsea 
Green, 2013).

764 
CHAPTER 33 — GROWTH AND SUSTAINABILITY IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
and moderate-income housing. Democratized ownership also takes the form of publicly run 
services and enterprises in local communities. More than two thousand publicly owned electric 
utilities are in operation, providing electricity at lower cost to the consumer. About 25 percent of 
electricity in the United States is supplied by locally owned public utilities and cooperatives.
In the ﬁnancial sector, co-ops take the form of credit unions—essentially democratized, 
one-person, one-vote banks. More than 95 million Americans are involved; assets total 
approximately $1 trillion. Following the ﬁnancial failures of 2008, campaigns to “move your 
money” shifted hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars from Wall Street and large 
banks to credit unions and smaller banks. 
“Greening” Communities 
In many cases, worker-owned companies have emphasized “green” design. In Kansas City, 
Missouri, a municipal “Green Impact Zone” has brought together public and private resources 
to transform a decaying neighborhood into a sustainable urban community. The effort in-
cludes school improvements, weatherization, job training and placement programs, business 
development (initially targeted at improving energy efﬁciency), renewable energy and water 
conservation programs, installation of a smart grid by Kansas City Power and Light, and new 
programs to develop housing on abandoned lots.
In Austin, Texas, another green municipal development initiative is working to build a 
regional economy that emphasizes green business leadership, clean technology, new jobs, 
and expanding opportunity. The city supports local companies that “green” their operations, 
and aims to make the city’s operations completely carbon-neutral (i.e., with net zero carbon 
emissions) by 2020—including reducing greenhouse gas emissions by switching to renewable 
energy, replacing inefﬁcient lighting, and replacing vehicle ﬂeets, plus conservation programs 
covering water, air quality, waste reduction and recycling, and green gardening.
These examples suggest that a different economic model of local development can 
combine democratization and ecological sustainability. It is worth considering whether such 
initiatives can be “scaled up” to the macroeconomic level, a question that we address in the 
next section.
5.4 MACROECONOMIC POLICIES FOR STABILIZATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
In Chapter 25, we saw how government spending and taxing policies can contribute to sta-
bilization, and in Chapters 26 and 27, we looked at issues of money and credit. A society 
committed to both stabilization and sustainability could ﬁnd ways to use these standard 
macroeconomic tools to work toward both goals.
Some economic policies aimed at promoting sustainability might actually represent 
a return to well-known Keynesian-style policies but with a new ecological twist—a 
strong emphasis on government and private investment in green technologies and a tax 
structure that shifts the tax burden from income, labor, and capital to the use of fossil 
fuels and resources.
As discussed in Chapter 28, the stimulus plan proposed by the Obama administration 
in 2009 and adopted by Congress was a classic Keynesian expansionary policy. About 10 
percent of the stimulus speciﬁcally targeted environmental objectives (see Box 33.3). Such 
“green Keynesian” policies could be widely adopted and expanded to promote the transition 
to a more sustainable economic system. 
Some ecologically oriented economists have suggested that, rather than growing 
indeﬁnitely on an exponential path—say of 4 percent GDP growth per year—national and 
global economic systems must follow what is called a logistic pattern, in which growth is 
eventually limited, at least in terms of resource consumption. This would lead to what is 
called a steady-state economy, in which population and economic output are stabilized 
(see Figure 33.6).

omy: an economy 
with no increase in 
population, or in the

terials and energy

 
ARE STABILIZATION AND SUSTAINABILITY IN CONFLICT?

These environmental limits on growth would apply to resource and energy consumption; at 
the same time, activities that do not involve resource consumption, which are environmentally 
neutral or environmentally friendly, could continue to grow. Such activities could include 
services, arts, communication, and education. After basic needs are met and reasonable levels 
of consumption achieved, the concept of sustainable development implies that economic 
development should be increasingly oriented toward this kind of inherently “sustainable” 
activities.
One model of a transition to a steady-state economy has been presented by the Canadian 
economist Peter Victor. An economic model called “LOWGROW,” when applied to the Canadian 
economy, models “socio-eco-environmental” paths that offer attractive social and environmental 
outcomes without requiring economic growth.7 In the scenario presented in Figure 33.7, the 
Canadian government is assumed to introduce a tax on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 
creating incentives to switch from high GHG sources of energy to lower ones, making energy

The $787 billion stimulus package adopted by the 
U.S. Congress in 2009 to promote recovery from the 
2007–9 recession contained about $71 billion for 
“green” investments, plus $20 billion in “green” tax 
incentives, including:

The double beneﬁt of such policies is that they 
promote employment and also advance a tran-
sition to a more environmentally sustainable 
economy. It is easily possible to envision much 
larger programs of this nature. For example, 
the stimulus program included $5 billion for 
weatherization programs. A major nationwide 
program for energy efﬁciency retroﬁt in houses 
and commercial buildings could easily be ten 
times as large. The stimulus program temporar-
ily quadrupled U.S. spending on energy and 
environmental research and development; a 
permanent increase of this magnitude would 
have enormous long-term beneﬁts in promoting 
a transition to efﬁciency and renewables.

in general more expensive and encouraging conservation and efﬁciency. The revenues from the 
GHG tax are used to reduce other taxes, so that the net effect on revenues is zero.
In this scenario, GDP per capita stabilizes after 2025, and GHG emissions decrease by 22 
percent by 2035. Poverty levels as well as unemployment decrease signiﬁcantly, and ﬁscal 
balance is reached, with a steady decrease in the debt to GDP ratio. A shorter workweek 
allows for full employment, with less growth in material consumption but more spending on 
health care and education. Such models show that slower growth leading to no growth can be 
consistent with full employment, virtual elimination of poverty, more leisure, considerable 
reduction in GHG emissions, and ﬁscal balance.
Discussion Questions
1. Cutting the length of the standard full-time workweek could be one way to keep people 
employed while cutting down on the “throughput” of materials and energy. Can you think 
of other policies that might also have this effect?
2. Do you think that an economic system can prosper without growth? Can we distinguish 
among growth in GDP, growth in employment, and growth in well-being? To what extent 
do these necessarily go together, and to what extent can improvements in employment 
and well-being be separated from GDP growth?
6. CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
Throughout the twentieth century, the main objective of macroeconomics was steady, strong 
economic growth. Considering the challenges that we face in the twenty-ﬁrst century, mac-
roeconomics itself will need to adapt to new realities. Employment, price stability, and GDP 
growth will continue to be issues of great importance—not as ends in themselves, however, 
but as the means to the broader goals of human development and sustainability. Keeping the 
ultimate well-being goals in mind, macroeconomics must look beyond the experience of the 
past and ask new questions.
A fundamental question confronting macroeconomics in the twenty-ﬁrst century is how the 
majority of people in the world, currently at relatively low standards of living, can improve 
their well-being. The issues of “human development” discussed in Chapter 32 involve a 
combination of traditional economic growth and new approaches more oriented toward 
dealing with problems of poverty, inequality, and ecological sustainability.
Economic analysis needs to take into account the need for technologies that can provide 
energy and materials for human consumption in ways that are ecologically sound, and that 
help to remedy past damages (Box 33.4). The transition to a more sustainable economy 
will have economic costs, but also signiﬁcant beneﬁts, such as increased employment and

BOX 33.4 TECHNOLOGIES FOR A SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY
Technological progress can reduce the need for re-
source inputs and mitigate or eliminate environmental 
impacts. For a new technology to be adopted in the 
marketplace, it must be cost-effective. Recent develop-
ments have encouraged hope that some environmen-
tally sound technologies are, or may soon become, 
competitive with more energy and resource-intensive 
and fossil-fuel based technologies.

in cost. Land-based wind power is now fully com-
petitive with coal and nuclear power (Ailworth, 
2013). While solar and offshore wind power 
remain more expensive than conventional power, 
their costs have declined also. Technologies such 
as solar roof tiles make it possible for buildings 
to generate much or all of their own power, thus 
adding to the asset value of the building.

improved quality of life. Another set of essential questions relates to how macroeconomics 
can be reformed to take into account the distant future. A ﬁrst step in this direction must be 
recognizing that in important areas it is inappropriate to discount the future (see Box 33.2). 
When our great-great-grandchildren are alive, their lives and well-being will be as important 
to them as ours are to us. (This perspective, though often neglected in economics, is not new 
and was emphasized by John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s—see Box 33.5.)
The macroeconomics of the twenty-ﬁrst century must be truly global. The social problems 
of poverty reduction, as well as major environmental problems such as global climate 
change, can be partly addressed at the national level, but the roles of international trade and 
global institutions are critical. Our earlier analyses of national income, ﬁscal and monetary 
policy, unemployment and inﬂation, and other macroeconomic issues, remain relevant, but 
must be placed in the context of global developmental and environmental challenges. 
Discussion Questions
1. Are you optimistic or pessimistic about the future when it comes to reducing global inequali-
ties? Do you believe that the world will be less or more unequal in ﬁfty years? What about 
environmental problems—do you think they will grow better or worse in your lifetime?
2. Do you agree with Keynes’s belief that industrialized countries will soon reach a point 
where needs will be “satisﬁed in the sense that we prefer to devote our further energies 
to noneconomic purposes”? Do you think that we are any closer to this point than 1930, 
when Keynes wrote his essay? Do you see any evidence that this is starting to occur?

REVIEW QUESTIONS
BOX 33.5 ECONOMIC POSSIBILITIES FOR OUR GRANDCHILDREN
What can we reasonably expect the level of our eco-
nomic life to be a hundred years hence? What are 
the economic possibilities for our grandchildren? John 
Maynard Keynes thought that:
a point may soon be reached, much sooner per-
haps than we are all of us aware of, when these 
needs are satisﬁed in the sense that we prefer to 
devote our further energies to non-economic pur-
poses. . . . I draw the conclusion that, assuming 
no important wars and no important increase in 
population, the economic problem may be solved, 
or be at least within sight of solution, within a hun-
dred years. This means that the economic problem 
is not—if we look into the future—the permanent 
problem of the human race.
 
Thus for the ﬁrst time since his creation 
man will be faced with his real, his permanent 
prob lem—how to use his freedom from press-
ing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, 
which science and compound interest will have 
won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and 
well.
 
When the accumulation of wealth is no lon-
ger of high social importance, there will be great 
changes in the code of morals. . . . The love of 
money as a possession—as distinguished from the 
love of money as a means to the enjoyments and 
realities of life—will be recognized for what it is, a 
somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of those semi-
criminal, semi-pathological propensities which 
one hands over with a shudder to the specialists 
in mental disease. All kinds of social customs 
and economic practices, affecting the distribution 
of wealth and of economic rewards and penal-
ties, which we now maintain at all costs, however 
distasteful and unjust they may be in themselves, 
because they are tremendously useful in promot-
ing the accumulation of capital, we shall then be 
free, at last, to discard.
 
Of course there will still be many people with 
intense, unsatisﬁed purposiveness who will blindly 
pursue wealth—unless they can ﬁnd some plau-
sible substitute. But the rest of us will no longer be 
under any obligation to applaud and encourage 
them.

APPENDIX: DEMOGRAPHIC CHALLENGES
One of the important issues in the area of human development and environmental sustainability 
is the question of how many people we need to be concerned about. In 1700, the human popu-
lation was about 600 million. In 1927, it was 2 billion. Currently, more than 7 billion people 
live on this planet. Will national and global populations continue to grow, level off, or even 
shrink? What are the macroeconomic challenges presented by likely demographic changes in 
the coming century?
The relationship between demographic and economic issues is multifaceted. On the 
one hand, growth in the size of economies is often associated with population growth, 

770 
CHAPTER 33 — GROWTH AND SUSTAINABILITY IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
because a growing population means more workers and hence greater ability to produce. 
On the other hand, human well-being can be endangered when population growth 
outpaces available resources, including environmental resources. If the production of 
needed goods and services cannot keep pace with population, lower standards of living 
can result. In addition to the question of population size, issues about the composition 
of a population, when considered according to characteristics such as age, can also be 
important in explaining economic change. After introducing some basic concepts in 
demography (the study of populations), this appendix examines the macroeconomic 
challenges posed by continued growth in global populations and the dramatic aging of 
populations in many countries.
A1. BASIC DEMOGRAPHIC TERMS AND HISTORY
Although the terms “birthrate” and “fertility rate” may seem as if they should mean the same 
thing, in the ﬁeld of demography they have different meanings. The birthrate is the annual 
number of births per 1,000 people in a population. The fertility rate, refers to the average 
number of births per woman of reproductive age in a population. The birthrate in any country 
will depend on two things: ﬁrst, the proportion of people in the country who are women of 
reproductive age, and, second, the rate of fertility among these women. Similarly, the death 
rate is the annual number of deaths per 1,000 people, while a mortality rate refers to deaths 
within a speciﬁc group. 
If the fertility rate is equal to what is called the replacement fertility rate, then the next 
generation will be the same size as the current one—women will, on average, produce just 
enough children to replace themselves and one other adult. Currently, the replacement fertility 
rate for industrialized countries is about 2.1 children per woman. (It is slightly higher than 2 
because slightly more males than females are born, and some female children will die before 
reaching reproductive age.) In countries with higher mortality rates or larger ratios of men 
to women, the replacement fertility rate is somewhat higher.
It might seem that a country with fertility rates that are exactly equal to the replacement 
rate should have a stable population. However, this is not necessarily so, due to a phenomenon 
called population momentum. Recall that the birthrate depends not only on the fertility rate 
but also on the size of the childbearing population. Suppose that a country has relatively few 
older people and large numbers of people of childbearing age. Its population will continue 
to grow even with a replacement fertility rate because the birthrate will be high (reﬂecting 
the size of the childbearing group), while the death rate will be low (because only a small 
proportion of the population will be reaching the end of life). Only when birthrates and death 
rates are equal does a population stabilize.
In the past two hundred to three hundred years, the industrialized countries have 
experienced a demographic transition from a combination of high birthrates and 
death rates to a combination of low birthrates and death rates. But this transition has 
not been smooth. Table 33.2 outlines the four—or perhaps ﬁve—stages of demographic 
transition.
In the ﬁrst stage, women spend a great deal of time and effort in bearing and raising 
children, at much risk to their own health, only to see many of their children die young. Thus 
moving away from the ﬁrst stage is an important goal of human development. Populations 
in the third and fourth stage have moved past the highest birth and death rates, making a 
higher quality of life possible.
Although birth and death rates are crucially important for explaining population trends in 
any country, for some countries the net migration rate is also important. The net migration 
rate is the number of people gained by migration (calculated as the number of people who 
move into an area minus the number of people who moved out of the area) over a year, usually 
expressed per 1,000 people.

A2. GLOBAL POPULATION PATTERNS AND POLICIES
The industrialized countries are generally in the third or fourth stage of the demographic 
transition. The fertility rate in the United States is near 2.1, while most other industrialized 
countries have fertility rates well below 2. Italy was one of the ﬁrst countries to be recognized 
as having a below-replacement birthrate, entering the third stage in about 1960. Its popula-
tion, nevertheless, continued to increase, from 50 million to about 57 million now (due to 
population momentum). Given current trends, Italy’s ﬁfth stage is about to begin; unless 
fertility rates rebound, the population is predicted to sink to 54 million in 2025 and 38 million 
in 2050—a 33 percent decline from the peak. Germany and Japan are other countries where 
population decline has just begun. Government policies in such countries now often seek to 
increase births (see Box 33.6).
Throughout most of the world, populations are still growing. Many governments and 
international agencies working in poorer countries have tried to bring down fertility rates, in 
order to ease the stress that a quickly growing population puts on resources and productive 
Table 33.2 Stages of Demographic Transition
First Stage
Both birth and death rates are high. On average, the number of children that survive 
in each family is just enough to keep the population stable or growing very slowly.
Second 
Stage
Death rates are reduced, while birthrates stay high, so parents are typically survived 
by signiﬁcantly more than the two children required to replace them. From the 
eighteenth to the twentieth centuries, this second stage developed in industrializing 
countries due to the nutritional advances that followed increased agricultural 
productivity, and (especially after about 1850) better medical care and sanitation.
Third Stage
Birthrates start declining, but are still higher than death rates. The increased 
availability of contraception and improvements in female education contribute to this 
stage. In the third stage, fertility rates are initially above replacement level but will 
eventually drop to or possibly below replacement level. Population growth slows down, 
though it continues to grow because of the number of women of childbearing age.
Fourth Stage Birthrates and death rates equalize at a low rate. Population growth is zero—but the 
population is considerably larger than it was when the process began.
Fifth Stage
Birthrates are lower than death rates. When the demographic transition was ﬁrst 
conceptualized, the process was expected to stop at the fourth stage. In fact, however, 
some countries may move fairly rapidly from above- to below-replacement birthrates, 
passing through the fourth stage of equal birth and death rates. Population actually 
declines.
BOX 33.6 SHRINKING ITALY
Although many environmentalists fret about over-
population, Italians are fretting over the opposite. 
Despite the stereotype of its massive Catholic clans, 
Italy actually has one of the lowest birthrates in the 
world, a population set to shrink by a third by 2050, 
and the world’s highest percentage of population 
aged 65 or older (21 percent in 2013). The country 
wants babies. Badly. [In 2004] the Italian government 
offered a $1,300 one-time payment to couples who 
had a second child. The rural village of Laviano, fear-
ful of disappearing altogether, is offering $14,000 
for every baby produced. Studies show, however, 
that while cash payments may accelerate breeding 
schedules, they don’t persuade tot-averse citizens to 
procreate. Some activists say what’s really needed is 
more public-policy support for working mothers. If

capacities. These programs have often been successful, at least to a degree, and some 
population policies simultaneously serve other human development ends. 
Increasing women’s access to health services and education has often played a crucial role, 
not only delivering knowledge about family planning but also giving women the power to 
play a greater role in household decisions. Other policies, such as China’s long-time policy of 
penalizing families with more than one child, are more coercive. Forced sterilizations, forced 
abortions, and infanticide (especially of girls, in cultures that prize boys) are the darker side 
of a compulsory approach to population control.
Population trends in China and India are especially noteworthy, because together they are 
home to nearly 40 percent of the world’s population. Even though China has put downward 
pressure on population with its one-child policy and had a fertility rate estimated at 1.64 
in 2010, its population is still growing due to population momentum. The UN projections 
suggest that its population will continue to grow until 2030, peaking at 1.45 billion. India 
currently has a smaller population than China, and its fertility rate has fallen by half since 
the 1960s. But with a current fertility rate of 2.73, India is expected to displace China as the 
world’s most populous country within the next 50 years. Populations are also still growing 
in most middle-income countries, though their fertility rates vary, some above and others 
below replacement.
Sub-Saharan Africa has had some of the world’s highest fertility rates in modern 
times—as many as seven children per woman in some countries. Tragically, however, the 
HIV/AIDS pandemic has drastically increased mortality rates in many of these countries. 
The population story in the Russian Federation is also rather grim. Suffering from the 
special conditions of a poorly managed transition from socialism to a market economy, it 
has experienced both high death rates and low birthrates. Its population, which reached a 
high of 148 million in 1990, had fallen to 143 million by 2013 (although birth rates have 
recently started to rise).
On the global scale, projections about population made by the United Nations Population 
Division forecast world population rising from its current level of 7 billion to 9 billion by 
2050. Most of the additional people will live in the less industrialized parts of the world. The 
projections assume that life expectancy will increase except where a population is affected 
by HIV/AIDS.
The UN projections, however, do not take into account the consequences of environmental 
degradation. Whether the resources of the world will be able to continue to support such a 
growing population remains to be seen. If population ceases to grow in this century, will it be 
because of individual choices and human development–oriented policies, such as increasing 
people’s power to control their family size? Or because of coercive polices or high death 
rates due to ﬂood, famine, and disease? Macroeconomic policies concerning resource use, 
development, and international economic relations hold part of the key to these important 
questions.
A3. THE ISSUE OF AGING POPULATIONS
To those who have been concerned about the ecological, economic, and social impacts of 
rapid population growth or excessively high population density, stabilizing populations are 
good news. But there are also signiﬁcant threats and challenges inherent in the fourth and 
ﬁfth stages of the demographic transition. The most obvious problems arise from the fact that 
rapidly falling birthrates lead to changes in the age structure of a population.
A convenient way to visualize the age structure of a population is to chart the numbers of 
men and women in different age categories, as shown in Figure 33.8 for the case of the United 
States. Such ﬁgures are sometimes called “population pyramids,” because in populations with 
sizable, steady birthrates and regular, steady death rates among the elderly, they take on the 
triangular shape shown in Figure 33.8(a), representing the U.S. population in 1900.

 
APPENDIX: DEMOGRAPHIC CHALLENGES

Although fertility rates fell in the United States in the twentieth century, this fall was not 
steady. Fertility was particularly low during the Great Depression and then rebounded in part 
after World War II. People born between 1946 and 1964 are thus said to belong to the “baby 
boom” generation. Then, after the “baby boom” came the “baby bust” and a transition to a 
substantially lower fertility rate. As a result, the “pyramid” by 2000 did not look so triangular 
anymore. At the turn of the twenty-ﬁrst century, a high proportion of people were in their 
prime working years, with relatively small numbers of the elderly and children, as shown 
in Figure 33.8(b).
As the bulge created by middle-aged baby boomers moves farther up the pyramid over the 
coming decades, the proportion of the population in retirement years will rise. (The ﬁrst baby

Population Reports, P23–209, “65+ in the United States: 2005,” U.S. Government Printing Ofﬁce, Washington, DC, 2005.
In 1900, the “population pyramid” shows a small elderly population, a larger middle-aged population, and an even 
larger population of children. By 2000, falling birth rates made the middle tiers of the “pyramid” bulge outward. The 
proportion of older people in the population is forecast to be much higher in future decades.

boomers turned 65 in 2011.) Government projections suggest that the age structure of the U.S. 
population will look like Figure 33.8(c) in 2040—much more like a rectangle than a triangle.
Other countries that have experienced a “baby bust” will face a similarly top-heavy age 
structure. This means that there will be fewer people of working age to support people who 
have retired. The old-age dependency ratio is often deﬁned as the number of people age 65 
and over for each hundred people age 15–64. Figure 33.9 shows the projected rises in the 
old-age dependency ratio for three of the countries that we have discussed: China, Italy, and 
the United States. In Italy, for example, the number of older people per 100 working-age 
persons is projected to rise from about 30 now to nearly 70 in 2050.
Such a changing age structure has a number of implications for national macroeconomics:

sectoral shift toward service-sector employment. In some countries, the need for workers 
may be ﬁlled, in part, by increased immigration.

programs and publicly provided social services and medical care. Such strains on public 
ﬁnances may lead to higher taxes or lower beneﬁts or cuts in other areas.
In countries such as the United States, which has a long history of retirement support, the effect 
may be felt primarily through strains in public budgets—as current controversies over the future 
of Social Security and the ﬁnancing of prescription drugs for the elderly already demonstrate. 
The aging of the population may be felt even more acutely in China, where pensions, medical 
care, and other support for the elderly are looming as possibly the leading social crisis.

your imagination, to illustrate another, very important point. Figure 33.8(a) showed the

United States in 1900; it can also serve as a generalized picture of any country that has a 
growing population impelled by fertility rates above replacement. More than half the world’s 
population—about 3.5 billion people—ﬁt this picture. At the same time, Figure 33.8(c) is a 
reasonably good picture of the squared-off “pyramids” that will, in the foreseeable future, 
characterize nearly all the rich countries of the world: Western Europe, Japan, and a few other 
highly industrialized countries. 
As the developing countries gradually stabilize, their population “pyramids” will ﬁll out 
just as those for the United States did over the past century, representing the additional 2 
billion people in the UN’s population projections for 2050. These population images and 
the underlying realities, including growing inequalities of living standards, will be of great 
global signiﬁcance for at least the next 50 years.
Although there is no certainty that inequalities between rich and poor will diminish in the 
foreseeable future, by midcentury there will be some important factors to add to the situation 
just described. China’s population (as noted earlier) will have begun to decline by 2050. It 
also seems likely that India’s declining fertility rate will not stop when it reaches 2.1, but will 
continue to fall, so that sometime in the second half of the twenty-ﬁrst century India will join 
China in a new category of countries that, even if not yet rich, have nevertheless reversed the 
long growth trend of the second stage of the demographic transition.
With China and India, and a number of other countries as well, eventually joining the list 
of countries with below-replacement fertility, it seems likely that within this century we will 
see a stabilization of the global human population. It is also possible that, beyond stabilization, 
the shrinking of populations will continue in the richer countries and spread to others as well. 
In terms of resource demands, pollution generation, and pressure on the earth’s ecological 
capacity, stabilization of population is desirable. However, signiﬁcant changes will be required 
in how people conceptualize and pursue their goals if a shift toward smaller populations is 
to be felt as positive rather than severely negative.
Macroeconomic theory has a signiﬁcant role to play in helping to understand and plan for 
these changes, including the need to revise expectations, behaviors, policies, and theories to 
assist populations in adapting to a changing age proﬁle. This has potentially large implications 
for medical care and other services, GDP, policy, and culture. One important challenge is 
discovering how the elderly can be more of a resource than a drain; this is desirable from an 
economic point of view as well as in terms of the psychological well-being (sense of meaning 
and purpose in life) of the elderly.
An overriding concern in the ﬁrst half of the twenty-ﬁrst century must be the need to provide 
food, energy, education, and productive work for a likely sizable increase in the number of 
people on earth—with virtually all of that increase occurring in areas where economic as 
well as social, cultural, and political systems are already hard pressed to adapt to past and 
present population growth.
The record of the past three hundred years is one of astonishing achievement, in which the 
total human population has multiplied more than tenfold, with more than half of those now 
alive enjoying a level of material consumption that would have been considered great riches 
in any previous era. But the number now living in extreme poverty is greater than the entire 
human population at the beginning of the demographic transition. And the natural capital 
on which humanity can draw is now signiﬁcantly degraded. The moral of the demographic 
story is sobering: It is the need to ﬁnd ways to provide better lives for more people, with 
limited natural resources.
