THE 
EVOLUTION 
OF RELIGIOUS 
MEMES: 
WHO—OR 
WHAT—BENEFITS?1 
Daniel 
C. 
Dennett 
All human 
groups, it seems, have had religion. There 
have been 
groups without agriculture, without clothing, without money, without 
the wheel, without laws, without writing, but not, it seems, without 
religion. Ritual burial of our hominid ancestors may even predate 
spoken language 
itself, the other striking difference that separates us 
from all other species.2 Religion, moreover, does not seem to have 
been a mere passing phase in human evolution; 
in even the most 
technocratic 
and materialistic comers of contemporary 
civilization, 
religion has found niches in which it flourishes. 
Why does it exist? The distinguished historian of ancient religion, 
Walter Burkert joins the impressive ranks of scholars who have ad 
dressed the question of the origin of religion, and unlike most of the 
others, he believes that the perspective of contemporary 
evolutionary 
biology can sharpen the questions 
and illuminate the issues. He is 
right. Dozens 
of insights leap from the pages of this fascinating book, 
arresting observations 
that cut across the standard 
banalities. 
He 
doesn't provide a single—let 
alone confirmed—answer 
to the ques 
tion of why religion exists, but he opens 
up the territory, raising 
many new—and 
investigatable—questions 
while organizing a wealth 
of historical detail for the benefit of future sleuths. Burkert writes with 
laudable 
detachment 
and frequent flashes of tart humor, but his as 
tringency is not always quite up to the task; he occasionally 
permits 
lardy bits from the nonscientific traditions to pass without criticism.

Why does religion exist? Well, why shouldn't 
it exist? "For one 
thing, religion is expensive", 
Burkert notes (142). "Give till it hurts", 
the bejeweled 
preacher in the tent exhorts his rapt congregation 
of 
poor people, 
and ever since people 
have had possessions, 
they have 
done just that, pouring their hard-won wine into the ground, burning 
their most prized livestock or even their children on sacrificial alters, 
living in shacks and caves while building vast temples and mausole 
ums in which no one is to live. "Spartans 
stopped 
warfare to cel 
ebrate their festivals even at crucial moments; Jews decided 
to die 
rather than defend themselves on the Sabbath"(7). 
This lavish and 
deliberate 
"squandering" 
of time and resources is the hallmark 
of 
religion. We don't automatically 
attribute religious significance 
to 
arrowheads 
or potshards—they 
are the remains of manifesdy practi 
cal activities—and 
we do not marvel that our ancestors would build 
elaborate 
storage facilities for grain or water, but why on earth would 
they build even grander edifices for the bones of their dead? 
Any phenomenon 
that apparently exceeds the functional cries out 
for explanation. 
The presumption 
is that we must be missing some 
thing, since it is, in a word, uneconomical, 
and as the economists 
are 
forever reminding us, there is no such thing as a free lunch. Evolu 
tionary biologists would say the same thing: features of the evolving 
world do not persist unless they can pay for themselves somehow. 
We 
don't marvel at a creature doggedly grubbing in the earth with its 
nose, for we figure it is seeking its food; if, however, 
it regularly 
interrupts its rooting with somersaults, we want to know why. What 
benefits are presumed 
(rightly or wrongly) to accrue 
to this excess 
activity? From an evolutionary point of view, religion appears to be a 
ubiquitous 
penchant 
for somersaults 
of the 
most 
elaborate 
sort, 
and 
as such it cries out for explanation. 
Burkert proposes 
to adopt a perspective "beyond individual 
civili 
zations, 
which 
must 
take 
account 
of the vast 
process 
of human 
evolu 
tion within the more general evolutionary 
process of life" (7). Con 
sider 
one 
of his 
examples: 
he 
notes 
that 
there 
is a tempting 
parallel 
between the ubiquitous 
practice of sacrifice in human religions, and 
the "part for whole" sacrifice observable 
in other species: the fox who 
gnaws 
off its own 
paw 
to escape 
the 
trap, 
the 
"terror 
moult" 
of the 
bird who "suddenly 
sheds its feathers and thus leaves the attacker 
with a mouthful of plumage 
while escaping in a 'naked' 
state" (41). 
The cases from biology make eminent sense, of course; such sacrifice 
can be "plainly rational in its calculation 
of loss and gain." 
(40).

Burkert sees clearly that the path from these phenomena 
to human 
ritual sacrifice is winding at best, but he presses on: "Religion 
and 
zoology are seen to join hands" (41). How? What does this mean? 
How is such a juncture to be explained? 
He elucidates: 
"This is not to postulate 
a definite inherited pro 
gram of behavior, encoded 
genetically and passed on in continuous 
evolution from more primitive to higher living beings and culminat 
ing in man. The examples 
from different species are not connected 
by a continuous chain of evolution. . . We are deeding with analogies, 
not homologies". 
And he goes on to observe that "it would be equally 
difficult to hold that these human 
rituals and fantasies owe their 
whole existence to some form of intracultural learning, to observation 
or empathy, or to sheer creative fantasy". So the transmission 
is 
neither wholly genetic nor wholly cultural. Perhaps it is not transmis 
sion at all? What is the alternative? "a biological 
'landscape' 
underly 
ing experience" 
(42). Just so. Convergent 
evolution. 
Uniformities or 
regularities in the environment itself are just as reliable "transmitters" 
of pattern, if something like reason can be postulated to recognize it. 
We do not marvel that people settle near water in all cultures, any 
more than we marvel that people believe that 2+2=4 
in all cultures. 
The bugbear of convergent evolution—and 
hence the absence of any 
transmission 
pathway—is 
always available 
whenever 
a ubiquitous 
feature 
makes 
sense. 
It is only 
the 
out-of-date 
features, 
the 
unfortunate 
legacies, that show clear evidence 
of genetic heritage (the environ 
ment having changed 
too fast for the genome to keep up), and only 
quirky, could-have-been-otherwise 
features that are unmistakable 
signs of cultural transmission (the tell-tale similarities of plagiarism 
being the best example). 
(That religions all use visual symbols is no 
evidence that there is either a symbolism-gene 
or a symbolism meme 
being transmitted; symbolism is too obviously good an idea. But if 
widely separated 
religions use the same symbols, that would 
raise 
questions—but 
the answers may not be obvious. 
A nice case is the 
apparently independent 
invention of the swastika by widely different 
groups.) 
But this is not yet to explain how an appreciation 
of the part for 
whole sacrifice, an appreciation 
we share with other species, might 
get transmogrified into the excesses of human ritual sacrifice. And we 
need to explain how dominance 
hierarchies and submission 
rituals 
among 
conspecifics 
might turn into religious ceremonies 
honoring 
invisible Alpha males or females, how oaths accompanied 
by fero

cious infliction of pain might evolve as behavioral 
innovations 
uncon 
sciously designed to combat the defection problem, and so on. 
There is no dearth of hypotheses: 
such features of religion might 
be like: 
money: it is a well-designed 
cultural addition whose ubiquity can be 
readily explained 
and even justified: it's a Good Trick that one would 
expect to be rediscovered again and again, a case of convergent social 
evolution. The society benefits. (It is somewhat like pheromone trails laid 
down by social insects to coordinate 
the activities of their fellows—its 
utility can only be understood in the context of the group, raising all 
the issues of group selection.) 
a pyramid scheme: it is a cleverly designed con game passed on (cultur 
ally) through the generations of an elite, who use it to take advantage 
of their conspecifics. 
Only the elite benefit. 
a pearl: it is the beautiful byproduct of a rigid, genetically controlled 
mechanism 
responding 
to an unavoidable 
irritation. 
a bowerbird's bower, it is the product of something analogous 
to runa 
way sexual selection, the elaboration 
of biological 
strategies caught 
on a positive feedback escalator. 
shivering, this apparently pointless agitation of the body actually has a 
benign role to play in maintaining 
the homeostatic 
balance, 
by rais 
ing the body temperature. The shiverer benefits, in most but not all 
circumstances 
in which it occurs. 
sneezing, invading 
parasites 
have commandeered 
the organism 
and 
are driving it to destinations that benefit them, whatever its effects on 
the organism. 
The 
truth 
about 
religion 
might 
well 
be 
an 
amalgam 
of 
several 
of 
these hypotheses (or others). But even if this is so—especially 
if this is 
so—we 
will not get a clear vision of why religion exists until we have 
clearly distinguished 
these possibilities and put each of them to the 
test. They do not all pull in the same direction. All of the hypotheses 
seek to explain religion by uncovering some benefit, some work done 
to pay the costs, but they differ strikingly on one issue: cui bono? Who 
or what is the principal beneficiary? 
One 
of the best savored ironies in the history of science is that

paper in his study, but didn't appre

cíate how it could solve his most nagging theoretical problem: 
the 
problem of blending inheritance. A similar irony is that Burkert has 
read Richard Dawkins' 
The Selfish Gene (1976), but still fails to appre 
ciate its messages; 
he doesn't recognize that Dawkins' 
ideas are just 
what he needs to clarify the area of greatest fogginess in his own 
account—we 
might call it his problem 
of blending 
explanations. 
Dawkins' 
book introduced the idea of memes—units 
of cultural rep 
lication—an 
idea that Burkert abruptly dismisses as mere metaphor, 
but it also stressed the importance 
of the cui bono? question, by show 
ing how evolutionary theorists have often misled themselves by fail 
ing to ask at every juncture just whose interests are being advanced: 
those of the individual, the elite, the social group as a whole, or those 
of some selfish genes—or 
even the selfish memes themselves. Burkert 
sometimes 
doesn't notice when his attempts at explanation 
wander 
between 
these quite distinct possibilities, 
mixing considerations 
of 
varying relevance 
and ignoring the different implications 
of these 
hypotheses. 
This is a surprisingly lapse, since Burkert is well aware 
of the 
pitfalls of simplistic Darwinism. 
He crisply rejects the caricature 
of 
evolutionary thinking that turns it all into "genetic determinism". 
As 
he notes, "The prospect for discovering religious genes is dim" (17), 
but he appreciates 
that this would not be the sole or even chief quest 
of an evolutionary 
understanding 
of religion. And he is under no 
illusions about what he can demonstrate 
scientifically: "there is no 
way of testing this hypothesis, be it through 30,000 
or 300,000 
or 
3,000,000 
years, through 1,000, 10,000 or 100,000 
generations; 
by 
scientific standards the hypothesis loses its point. We can only vague 
ly reconstruct the decisive cultural conditions". 
Indeed, I think he is 
overly pessimistic on this score. The chains of reasoning and evidence 
forged to support today's accounts 
of life in the Jurassic are often 
breathtakingly ingenious and complex; efforts to deduce and confirm 
crucial details of the last few hundred thousand 
years of hominid 
evolution have not come close to exhausting their resources. Auda 
cious 
efforts 
to reconstruct 
the 
past 
sometimes 
strike 
gold 
that 
would 
never be recognized 
by an explorer without a theory. 
Burkert is an explorer of vast knowledge 
and the rudiments of a 
theory. What is the relation between genetic transmission and cul 
tural transmission? Burkert gets part of the story clearly: "Informa 
tion survival asserts itself side by side with and even instead of genetic 
survival" (24). These are two parallel and at least partially independ

ent processes 
of selection and replication, but the theorist he then 
turns to is Durkheim, 
not Dawkins. 
"If we adopt the Durkheimian 
concept of 'collective representations,' 
we might ask, why do people 
accept them, and why certain ones among them?" He then considers 
the oft-noted possibility that people 
are duped into accepting 
them 
by an elite, but never quite considers the prospect that even the elite 
are duped into accepting them—by 
the memes themselves, in effect, 
parasitically exploiting proclivities they have "discovered" 
in the hu 
man cognitive-immune 
system. 
Burkert persistently overlooks this possibility. Consider 
a few in 
stances. At the outset he notes the "ubiquity 
of certain less trivial 
phenomena, 
which are culturally determined 
in every case and yet 
not generated or explicable 
in isolation. . . . They must be presumed 
to fulfill basic functions for human social life in all its forms, even if it 
is easy to imagine 
alternatives" 
(4). Indeed 
these phenomena 
may 
fulfill basic functions for us, but they may also do us no good at all, but 
rather earn their keep by serving cultural parasites whose only master 
is their own replication. Burkert would like to argue, from Darwinian 
principles, that religion must serve human interests: 
Because 
on the whole 
the history 
of religions 
has been 
a story of success, 
a good 
strategy 
for survival 
in the long 
run must 
have 
been 
at work. 
In 
other 
words, 
a certain 
survival 
fitness 
of religion 
has to be granted. 
(13) 
Survival fitness for whom? The "obvious" 
answer to would-be 
Dar 
winians is still "humanity" 
or Homo sapiens sapiens, but this "good of 
the species" answer has now been firmly discredited by evolutionary 
theory. Even if, as seems highly probable 
on Burkert's showing, reli 
gion has often served human interests, and been selected for these 
benefits, the case that needs to be made is more complex 
than Bur 
kert recognizes. 
He 
presents 
all 
the 
right 
pieces, 
but 
just 
never 
quite 
put 
them 
all 
together. He clearly sees, for instance, the interactive effect of two of 
the most potent phenotypic 
features of some religious memes: they 
are a potent palliative—an 
opiate of the masses to which one might 
well become 
addicted—and 
in the process of providing relief they 
deflect the sort of criticism that might extinguish them: 
Affliction 
is made 
bearable 
by an ultimate 
if nonempirical 
answer 
to the 
grieving 
one's 
question, 
'why.' 
To 
introduce 
the unseen 
is to interrupt 
the closed 
functional 
chain 
of events—which 
also 
means 
that religion 
is 
never 
fully integrated 
into 
any system 
of society 
but retains 
some 
char 
acter of 'otherness'. (27)

MEMES

In other words, religion keeps its distance (like a medium or a stage 
magician), always reserving the "right" to duck out of sight or decline 
to perform, whenever the scrutiny becomes 
too intense. This power 
need not be consciously appreciated 
by the elite that are its vectors. 
Burkert also sees room for a contrast between 
"cultural" 
and "ge 
netic" fitness. "Religions 
are established by learning, they are propa 
gated both through imitation and through explicit verbal teaching. 
Traditions 
developed 
in this way can evidence 
a kind of cultural 
fitness for survival without any genetic basis" (16). This appeal 
to 
"cultural fitness" needs some clarification, however. Sometimes 
Bur 
kert seems to think it is the genetic fitness of those who have the 
cultural item in their kit, but this is just one possibility; other times he 
sees that genetic fitness may be beside the point—as 
when he points 
to the sixty generations of priestly celibacy in the still robust tradition 
of Roman 
Catholicism. 
The Shakers carried that idea one step further, prohibiting pro 
creation among all their members, not just the clergy, a policy that 
soon led, not surprisingly, to their extinction. But we should temper 
our conviction 
that this result was all too foreseeable. 
It wets not 
inevitable, as a thought experiment will bring out. Imagine 
a sect, 
like the Shakers, that rigorously prohibits procreation 
among all its 
devout, but that (unlike the Shakers), has a creed of enormous 
pros 
elytizing power; for one reason or another people 
convert to this 
religion in droves—and 
never bear children. Instead, they proselytize 
the heathen. 
This pattern persists for a thousand 
years (let's say). 
That persistence would receive a Darwinian 
explanation 
but not in 
terms of the enhanced 
genetic 
fitness of the individuals 
that 
transiently embody the cultural group. Their genetic fitness is zero— 
they leave no grandchildren 
at all. It is a logical truth that if this 
cultural phenomenon 
swept to fixation, converting all the members 
of our species, it would promptly extinguish both the species and 
itself, but that boundary 
condition has no leverage to force all the 
patterns actually discernible in human 
history to pay their dues to 
genetic 
fitness. 
The 
memes' 
perspective 
is obligatoiy 
to 
explain 
such 
phenomena—if 
they 
occur. 
And 
we 
cannot 
even 
frame 
the 
questions 
that 
would 
settle 
whether 
they 
occur 
without 
entertaining 
the 
memes' 
perspective as a tool of enquiry. 
There are more ways of being a good Darwinian 
naturalist about 
culture 
than 
Burkert 
realizes.

at

state

cultural phenomenon, 
brought definite advantage 
to certain indi 
viduals 
and thus was likely to multiply their and their adherents' 
chances 
of offspring and hence their genes, to the detriment of the 
nonreligious" 
(12). This is only one of the interesting evolutionary 
hypotheses 
to consider. As he notes, "The fitness of religion in the 
sense of procreation and survival value is not at all agreed upon" (12). 
Indeed it is not, even by those who are confident that an evolutionary 
perspective 
is the royal road to enlightenment on this topic. 
I dwell on these shortcomings 
only because 
Burkert has whetted 
my appetite beyond what he can satisfy with his feast of good sugges 
tions. As usual, God is in the details, but let me sketch his tentative 
answers to a few key questions: 
Might there be a genetic predisposition for susceptibility to the emotional triggers 
of religious rituals and institutions? 
Indeed there might. There might be "genes for religion" after all, just 
as there might be genes anachronistically 
but tellingly describable 
as 
genes for dyslexia (Dennett 
1995: 116-117). 
There could obviously 
be genetic predispositions 
for herd-joining or loneliness-hating, 
or for 
susceptibility to rhythmic patterns in auditory and locomotory 
phe 
nomena—for 
a love of music and dance in short. And there also 
could be a genetic predisposition 
for the sort of hair-raising, bone 
trembling awe that engulfs many of our conspecifics when they are 
given a religious experience. 
"To 
transmit religion is to transmit 
fear". (30) Burkert offers a evolutionary 
scenario 
of a cascade 
of 
bottlenecks that could select for such genes. "Although 
religious ob 
session could be called a form of paranoia, 
it does offer a chance of 
survival in extreme and hopeless situations, when others, possibly the 
nonreligious 
individuals, 
would break down and give up. Mankind, 
in its long past, will have gone through many a desperate 
situation, 
with an ensuing breakthrough 
of homines religió si" (16). 
Why should rituals take on the forms they do? 
Consider 
Burkert's account of the rituals in many cultures by which 
adolescents 
are initiated into adulthood. 
Why do they occur? Why 
don't other species engage in them?

THE 
EVOLUTION 
OF RELIGIOUS 
MEMES 
123 
Initiation 
rituals 
are 
anything 
but natural. 
It is a mistake 
to make 
the 
assumption 
that nature 
transforms 
itself into ritual, 
and 
ritual 
in turn is 
followed 
by language. 
Rituals 
are 
complicated, 
ambivalent, 
and 
not 
seldom 
opaque 
even to those who practice them. It makes 
more 
sense 
to see 
them 
as cultural 
attempts 
to make 
the 'facts 
of life' 
manageable 
and 
predictable; to perform an act of artificial social creation, as if to veil 
biology. 
In performing 
such 
rituals 
people 
act as if the adolescent, 
male 
or female, 
could 
not simply 
grow 
adult 
on his or her own, 
but must 
be 
made 
a man 
or woman 
by society. 
Ritual 
activity 
follows 
the clues 
of 
nature, 
but works 
on them 
with 
the force 
of conscious 
tradition 
elabo 
rated 
through 
unnatural, 
cultural 
choice; 
with 
exaggeration, 
repetitive 
ness, and other complications. (75; emphasis added) 
As a general rule, animals don't have a clue about why they do what 
they instinctually do, and human beings are no exception; the deeper 
purposes of our "instincts" are seldom transparent to us. The differ 
ence between us and other species is that we are the only species that 
cares about this ignorance! 
Unlike other species, we feel a general 
need to "understand". 
Human 
adolescents 
get in the habit of asking 
"why?" 
and something 
has to be done to assuage 
their reflective 
questioning 
of the strange things that are happening 
in them. They 
want it to make more sense than it does. Culture obliges with an 
opulent festival of excess meaning, 
and "this provides a verbalized 
sort of script to accompany 
natural change, 
handed 
down in oral 
tradition, to facilitate the understanding 
of memorable 
developments 
while hiding part of them" (78). This is all intensely plausible, I think, 
but it neglects cni bono? Is the ceremony, like good folk medicine, a 
fine if ill-understood 
palliative for a genuine ache, or is it, like bad 
folk medicine, 
something the adolescents 
would do better without, 
but which the adult culture imposes on them (perhaps with the best 
of intentions, perhaps not)? Might the traditions persist in spite of the 
fact that they (no longer) serve any social function but merely go 
piggyback on the meme for tradition itself? (Think of the song, "Tra 
dition!" in Fiddler on the Roof) 
The need to know why could be the source of many other rituals 
and 
practices. 
Like 
menarche, 
plagues 
and 
other 
catastrophes 
lead 
to 
new whys. Why to us? What did we do wrong? The weather (adverse 
winds for fleets, floods, and droughts) is another handily chaotic and 
hence 
incomprehensible 
and unpredictable 
source 
of punishment 
and reward. This reflective puzzlement 
is a good impetus to science, 
but until science came along, one had to settle for personifying the 
unpredictable—adopting 
the intentional stance toward it—and

ing various desperate measures of control and appeasement. 
(In The 
Future of an Illusion, Freud calls religion "a substitute of psychology for 
natural science" 
[26].) 
This explanation 
puts a contemporary 
puzzle in a better light: If 
the foundation 
of cults is so often in the pattern of a response to a 
calamity (such as a drought or plague), then why are cults founded so 
readily today? Which calamity is driving people into cults? It seems 
to be a general aporia, a loss of meaning or nerve, a thirst for simple 
answers to overwhelming 
complexity. I suspect it is this last oppres 
sion that weighs the heaviest. And it is not belied by the fact that 
"we" are understanding 
ever more of our surroundings, conquering 
disease, and overwhelming 
the complexities of nature with our scien 
tific theories. For not everybody belongs to this "we". Those who see 
themselves 
as outside the gates of the scientific culture (which of 
course includes not just scientists, but all the science-literate, 
science 
friendly people) 
see it as approximately 
as threatening to their own 
sense of power as Martians 
with advanced 
technology beyond 
our 
ken would seem to us. Their reaction is not unreasonable: 
If you 
can't join 'em, beat 'em. 
Why should religion home in so regularly on the ritual practice of giving gifts to an 
unseen God? 
"How 
could such a principle become 
dominant 
in religion, where 
one side of the deal must necessarily remain unseen?" 
(138). There 
are several threads to the answer. First, and obviously, there is the 
well-known 
profile of superstitious belief, so hard to disconfirm in 
experience. 
As B. F. Skinner and Richard 
Herrnstein demonstrated 
in pigeons some years ago, elaborate 
"superstitious behavior" 
can be 
entrained in animals put on a random 
reinforcement schedule. 
"If 
asked 
why 
they 
keep 
to their 
strange 
and 
sometimes 
bizarre 
religious 
ceremonies, 
so-called primitives will usually reply that they would fall 
sick if they didn't" (108). 
Spontaneous 
remission provides just the 
random 
reinforcement 
schedule 
required. 
Moreover 
the survivors, 
when there are survivors, will have lots of hunches about what they did 
that was right. Credit assignment (as it is known in debugging circles) 
is a notoriously hard problem. 
Giving to the gods (just to be safe) is 
further enforced by cognitive dissonance, 
in effect. All give to the 
gods; those who prosper praise the gods and declare 
their success; 
those who don't go silent, or make up excuses and explanations.

is led to wonder: what is the minimum success rate required to estab 
lish 
such 
customs? 
"Look at all these votive gifts", Diagoras the atheist was told in the 
sanctuary 
of Samothrace, 
which 
houses 
the 
great 
gods 
who 
were 
fa 
mous 
for saving 
people 
from the dangers 
at sea. 
"There 
would 
be many 
more 
votives", 
the atheist 
unflinchingly 
retorted, 
"if all those 
who 
were 
actually 
drowned 
at sea 
had 
had 
the chance 
to set up 
monuments". 
(141) 
But there is more to it than that. People 
often turn over their life 
savings to perfectly visible individuals 
whom they deem to be the 
givers of great gifts of one intangible sort or another, but there is a 
further basin of attraction for the idea of an invisible God, not just 
the current King or Boss or Earthly Benefactor (the alpha male or 
female), but an unseen higher-up. 
This might be a response to a scale effect: what happens 
to the 
alpha in any social group if the band gets bigger and bigger (thanks 
to agriculture, thanks to better living conditions, new improvements 
in hygiene, or fighting off predators)? Must the group disintegrate or 
splinter? Perhaps. Perhaps that happened, 
amoeba-like, 
thousands of 
times before some innovation permitted a larger group to self-stabi 
lize. Such an innovation 
might be the discovery, by an alpha, that 
there is additional safety in declaring oneself to be a mere "messenger 
of power": 
"He administers the power of the stronger one without 
running the full risk of responsibility" 
(98). Alphas 
leam that they 
have 
to keep 
the pressure 
on. 
"Men 
are 
cunning 
by nature 
and 
prone 
to disobey; this is the constant complaint of prophets" 
(100). 
Accepting inferior status to God, the Lord, is a cunning stratagem, 
whether or not its cunning is consciously 
recognized 
by those who 
stumble upon it. Those who rely on it will thrive, wittingly or other 
wise. Submission 
rituals in animals are the ground in which such a 
stratagem could take root. Submission 
entails security; Daddy 
will 
take charge. So an obvious function of submission 
is to reduce ag 
gression. [Cui bono? The individual? 
The group? This is not a settled 
question.) 
An 
obvious 
function 
of even 
the 
king 
having 
to submit 
to 
a higher, but invisible, force is clear: as every subordinate 
knows, 
one's commands 
are more effective than they might otherwise be, if 
one can accompany 
them with a threat to tell the bigger boss if 
disobedience 
ensues. (Variations 
on this stratagem are well-known to 
mafia 
underlings, 
used car salesmen, 
and 
others.) The 
point is 
brought out by what is otherwise a bit of a puzzle.

depends 
on the fidelity of his immediate 
staff—in the simple sense 
that any two or three of them could easily overpower 
him (he can't 
go around with dagger drawn all his life). How do you, as a dictator, 
ensure that your immediate 
staff puts its fidelity to you above 
any 
thoughts they may very well have about replacing you? Putting the 
fear of a higher power in their heads is a pretty good move. In fact, 
there is probably 
an unspoken 
detente between 
chief priest and 
king—each 
needs the other for his power, and together they need the 
gods above. 
God will get you if you try to cross either one of us. 
Burkert is particularly 
Machiavellian 
in his account 
of how this 
stratagem brings the institution of ritual praise in its wake: 
By the force 
of his verbal 
competence 
he not only 
rises 
to a superior 
level 
in imagination 
but succeeds 
in reversing 
the attention 
structure: 
it 
is the superior 
who 
is made 
to pay 
heed 
to the inferior's 
song 
or speech 
of praise. 
Praise 
is the recognized 
form of milking 
noise 
in the presence 
of superiors; 
in a well-structured 
form, it tends 
to become 
music. 
Praise 
ascends 
to the heights 
like incense. 
Thus 
the tension 
between 
high 
and 
low 
is both 
stressed 
and 
relaxed, 
as the lower 
one 
establishes 
his place 
within a system he accepts emphatically. (91) 
Although 
Burkert never mentions Nietzsche—a 
thought-provoking 
silence, given the common 
ground they tread—he 
fully appreciates 
the economic rationale that Nietzsche 
stressed behind this hierarchical 
authority structure. (I find myself reminded 
of Nietzsche's 
view of 
religion almost every time I take my returnable bottles and cans to 
the local Redemption 
Center.) Exchanges 
of property need a stable 
guarantor of the system: what is not mine and not yours but belongs 
to a third party not present needs to be protected from our desires. 
Nietzsche's 
insistence that religion is needed to "breed an animal with 
the right to make promises" can be seen in Burkert's discussion of oaths. 
"Oaths 
are . . . strategies of tricky humans endowed 
with language, 
who 
will 
match 
every 
attempt 
at 
validation 
with 
new 
attempts 
at 
deception". 
Early oaths did not just involve a hand on a Bible, he 
tells us, but taking entrails in hand, dipping hands in blood, and even 
more shocking encounters, designed, it seems, to ensure the "unfor 
gettable imprint of psychic terror" (168). This escalation 
of costliness 
reminds one of the Zahavi 
Principle (which has somehow 
eluded 
Burkert's gaze): 
only costly advertising carries its credibility on its 
sleeve. Burkert sees the relevance of this to evolutionists' work on the 
Prisoner's Dilemma—he 
mentions it briefly, page 
139—but 
he also 
recognizes the complexity of the issues, and chooses not to go out on

any limbs, exhibiting wise caution. But one point at least seems unde 
niable: 
one can always evade 
the quandary 
of the Prisoner's 
Di 
lemma by having Big Brother watching. Put an overseer—a 
merely 
believed in overseer will do handsomely—on 
the scene ubiquitously. 
Burkert sketches analyses of many other phenomena: 
signs and 
divination, 
the relation between social gift-giving (as distinguished, 
importantly, from ordinary economic 
exchange) 
and religious ritual, 
tattoos, the use of precious metals in religious artifacts, and much 
more. He devotes a lengthy chapter to the role of narrative in human 
culture, and the themes that are ubiquitous 
in the most "primitive" 
folklore as well as in the great religious narratives that are its de 
scendants. He points out how these tales exist in versions all over the 
world, in cases where there is little question of cultural transmission. 
Indeed, these stories don't have to be encoded 
in the brain innately; 
they can be encoded, 
implicit, in other parts of the body—e.g., 
the 
reproductive system. Menarche, 
the possibility of rape, the ordeal of 
childbirth, these ubiquitous 
event types can all by themselves carry a 
huge informational load, guaranteeing 
that stories will be reinvented, 
every generation if need be, stories that speak to the needs of beings 
who must go through these experiences. 
Darwin's 
breakthrough in biology was enabled by his deep knowl 
edge of the wealth of empirical details scrupulously garnered by hun 
dreds of pre-Darwinian, 
non-Darwinian 
natural 
historians. 
Their 
theoretical innocence 
was itself an important check on his enthusi 
asm; they had not gathered their facts with an eye to proving Dar 
winian 
theory correct. Burkert stands in a similar relation to the 
wealth of scholarship 
accumulated 
by historians and anthropologists 
about the details of religious practices, attitudes, and artifacts through 
the ages. He is in a good position 
to appreciate 
the relevance— 
unimagined 
by those scholars—of 
many of their hard-won facts. His 
strength, then, is more as the alert and imaginative 
guide to the 
available 
resources than as a theorist. That suggests a fine division of 
labor; let those who would specialize 
in the theory of cultural evolu 
tion 
be 
instructed 
by 
his pioneering 
work. 
Other 
indispensable 
con 
tributors to this interdisciplinary 
project will be those who are as 
encyclopedic 
in their knowledge 
of Asian, African, and American 
religions as Burkert is about the religions he knows best. His scholar 
ship is vast, but he acknowledges 
that he has had to build his case 
from his home base in Mediterranean 
and European 
cultures, with 
sidelong glances only at the Western Hemisphere 
and other varia 
tions.

It is disconcerting to note, however, that it may be difficult to enlist 
many of his scholarly humanist colleagues 
in this collaborative 
re 
search effort. An author's defenses, like an animal's, 
imply a great 
deal about the world in which he lives, and there are altogether too 
many signs in his book that any attempt to introduce 
evolutionary 
considerations 
into a discussion of cultural topics is bound to run into 
a wall of hostile incomprehension. 
Above all, instead of ungenerously 
criticizing Burkert for his minor scientific shortcomings, 
we should 
congratulate 
him for educating 
himself so well in the face of such 
paranoid 
opposition. 
Burkert knows his audience 
and has taken ma 
jor steps towards solving problems of diplomacy 
and communication. 
His experience 
and fluency in the land of culture studies far outweigh 
the minor, and easily amended, 
gaps in his scientific knowledge.
