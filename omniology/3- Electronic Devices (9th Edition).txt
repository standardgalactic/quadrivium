PREFACE
This ninth edition of Electronic Devices reflects changes recommended by users and
reviewers. Applications and troubleshooting coverage have been expanded to include
several new topics related to renewable energy and automated test programming. As in the
previous edition, Chapters 1 through 11 are essentially devoted to discrete devices and
circuits. Chapters 12 through 17 primarily cover linear integrated circuits. A completely
new Chapter 18 covers an introduction to programming for device testing. It can be used as
a “floating” chapter and introduced in conjunction with any of the troubleshooting
sections. Chapter 19, which was Chapter 18 in the last edition, is an online chapter that
covers electronic communications. Multisim® files in versions 10 and 11 are now available
at the companion website, www.pearsonhighered.com/electronics.
New in This Edition
Reorganizations of Chapters 1 and 2
These chapters have been significantly re-
worked for a more effective coverage of the introduction to electronics and diodes. New
topics such as the quantum model of the atom have been added.
GreenTech Applications
This new feature appears after each of the first six chapters
and introduces the application of electronics to solar energy and wind energy. A significant
effort is being made to create renewable and sustainable energy sources to offset, and
eventually replace, fossil fuels. Today’s electronics technician should have some familiarity
with these relatively new technologies. The coverage in this text provides a starting point
for those who may pursue a career in the renewable energy field.
Basic Programming Concepts for Automated Testing
A totally new chapter by Gary
Snyder covers the basics of programming used for the automated testing of electronic
devices. It has become increasingly important for electronic technicians, particularly those
working in certain environments such as production testing, to have a fundamental ground-
ing in automated testing that involves programming. This chapter is intended to be used in
conjunction with the traditional troubleshooting sections and can be introduced or omitted
at the instructor’s discretion.
More Multisim® Circuits Updated to Newest Versions
Additional Multisim® circuit
files have been added to this edition. All the files have been updated to versions 10 and 11.
New Format for Section Objectives
The section objectives have been rewritten to pro-
vide a better indication of the coverage in each section. The new format better reflects the
topics covered and their hierarchy.
Miscellaneous Improvements
An expanded and updated coverage of LEDs includes
high-intensity LEDs, which are becoming widely used in many areas such as residential
lighting, automotive lighting, traffic signals, and informational signs. Also, the topic of
quantum dots is discussed, and more emphasis is given to MOSFETs, particularly in
switching power supplies.

INTRODUCTION
In Chapter 1, you learned that many semiconductor devices
are based on the pn junction. In this chapter, the operation
and characteristics of the diode are covered. Also, three
diode models representing three levels of approximation are
presented and testing is discussed. The importance of the
diode in electronic circuits cannot be overemphasized. Its
ability to conduct current in one direction while blocking
current in the other direction is essential to the operation of
many types of circuits. One circuit in particular is the ac
rectifier, which is covered in this chapter. Other important
applications are circuits such as diode limiters, diode
clampers, and diode voltage multipliers. A datasheet is
discussed for specific diodes.

TROUBLESHOOTING
A technician who understands the basics of circuit operation and who can, if necessary,
perform basic analysis on a given circuit is much more valuable than one who is limited
to carrying out routine test procedures. In this section, you will see how to test a circuit
board that has only a schematic with no specified test procedure or voltage levels. In
this case, basic knowledge of how the circuit operates and the ability to do a quick
circuit analysis are useful. 
After completing this section, you should be able to

POWER AMPLIFIERS
Application Activity: The Complete PA System
The class AB power amplifier follows the audio preamp and drives the speaker as shown 
in the PA system block diagram in Figure 7–34. In this application, the power amplifier is
developed and interfaced with the preamp that was developed in Chapter 6. The maximum
signal power to the speaker should be approximately 6 W for a frequency range of 70 Hz 
to 5 kHz. The dynamic range for the input voltage is up to 40 mV. Finally, the complete PA
system is put together.

PREFACE
Suggestions for Using This Textbook
As mentioned, this book covers discrete devices and circuits in Chapters 1 through 11 and
linear integrated circuits in Chapters 12 through 17. Chapter 18 introduces programming
concepts for device testing and is linked to Troubleshooting sections.
Option 1 (two terms)
Chapters 1 through 11 can be covered in the first term.
Depending on individual preferences and program emphasis, selective coverage may be
necessary. Chapters 12 through 17 can be covered in the second term. Again, selective cov-
erage may be necessary.
Option 2 (one term)
By omitting certain topics and by maintaining a rigorous schedule,
this book can be used in one-term courses. For example, a course covering only discrete
devices and circuits would use Chapters 1 through 11 with, perhaps, some selectivity.
Similarly, a course requiring only linear integrated circuit coverage would use Chapters
12 through 17. Another approach is a very selective coverage of discrete devices and circuits
topics followed by a limited coverage of integrated circuits (only op-amps, for example).
Also, elements such as the Multisim exercises, Application Activities, and GreenTech
Applications can be omitted or selectively used.
To the Student
When studying a particular chapter, study one section until you understand it and only then
move on to the next one. Read each section and study the related illustrations carefully; think
about the material; work through each example step-by-step, work its Related Problem and
check the answer; then answer each question in the Section Checkup, and check your
answers. Don’t expect each concept to be completely clear after a single reading; you may
have to read the material two or even three times. Once you think that you understand the ma-
terial, review the chapter summary, key formula list, and key term definitions at the end of the
In this GreenTech Application, solar tracking is examined. Solar tracking is the process of
moving the solar panel to track the daily movement of the sun and the seasonal changes
in elevation of the sun in the southern sky. The purpose of a solar tracker is to increase the
amount of solar energy that can be collected by the system. For flat-panel collectors, an
increase of 30% to 50% in collected energy can be realized with sun tracking compared
to fixed solar panels.
Before looking at methods for tracking, let’s review how the sun moves across the sky.
The daily motion of the sun follows the arc of a circle from east to west that has its axis
pointed north near the location of the North Star. As the seasons change from the winter
solstice to the summer solstice, the sun rises a little further to the north each day. Between
the summer solstice and the winter solstice, the sun moves further south each day. The
amount of the north-south motion depends on your location.
Single-Axis Solar Tracking
For flat-panel solar collectors, the most economical and generally most practical solution
to tracking is to follow the daily east-west motion, and not the annual north-south motion.
The daily east-to-west motion can be followed with a single-axis tracking system. There
are two basic single-axis systems: polar and azimuth. In a polar system, the main axis is
pointed to the polar north (North Star), as shown in Figure GA4–1(a). (In telescope
terminology, this is called an equatorial mounting.) The advantage is that the solar panel is
kept at an angle facing the sun at all times because it tracks the sun from east to west and
is angled toward the southern sky. In an azimuth tracking system, the motor drives the
solar panel and frequently multiple panels. The panels can be oriented horizontally but
still track the east-to-west motion of the sun. Although this does not intercept as much of
the sunlight during the seasons, it has less wind loading and is more feasible for long
rows of solar panels. Figure GA4–1(b) shows a solar array that is oriented horizontally
with the axis pointing to true north and uses azimuth tracking (east to west). As you can
see, sunlight will strike the polar-aligned panel more directly during the seasonal movement
of the sun than it will with the horizontal orientation of the azimuth tracker.

BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTORS
 FIGURE GA4–1
Types of single-axis solar tracking.
Some solar tracking systems combine both the azimuth and the elevation tracking, which
is known as dual-axis tracking. Ideally, the solar panel should always face directly
toward the sun so that the sun light rays are perpendicular to the panel. With dual-axis
tracking, the annual north-south motion of the sun can be followed in addition to the
daily east-to-west movement. This is particularly important with concentrating collectors
that need to be oriented correctly to focus the sun on the active region.
Figure GA4–2 is an example showing the improvement in energy collection of a typical
tracking panel versus a nontracking panel for a flat solar collector. As you can see, track-
ing extends the time that a given output can be maintained.
There are several methods of implementing solar tracking. Two main ones are sensor con-
trolled and timer controlled.
Sensor-Controlled Solar Tracking
This type of tracking control uses photosensitive devices such as photodiodes or photo-
resistors. Typically, there are two light sensors for the azimuth control and two for the ele-
vation control. Each pair senses the direction of light from the sun and activates the motor
control to move the solar panel to align perpendicular to the sun’s rays.
Figure GA4–3 shows the basic idea of a sensor-controlled tracker. Two photodiodes with
a light-blocking partition between them are mounted on the same plane as the solar panel.

chapter. Take the true/false quiz, the circuit-action quiz, and the self-test. Finally, work the as-
signed problems at the end of the chapter. Working through these problems is perhaps the
most important way to check and reinforce your comprehension of the chapter. By working
problems, you acquire an additional level of insight and understanding, and develop logical
thinking that reading or classroom lectures alone do not provide.
Generally, you cannot fully understand a concept or procedure by simply watching or
listening to someone else. Only hard work and critical thinking will produce the results
you expect and deserve.

INTRODUCTION
Electronic devices such as diodes, transistors, and integrated
circuits are made of a semiconductive material. To under-
stand how these devices work, you should have a basic
knowledge of the structure of atoms and the interaction of
atomic particles. An important concept introduced in this
chapter is that of the pn junction that is formed when two
different types of semiconductive material are joined. The pn
junction is fundamental to the operation of devices such as
the solar cell, the diode, and certain types of transistors.

INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONICS
The Bohr Model
An atom* is the smallest particle of an element that retains the characteristics of that ele-
ment. Each of the known 118 elements has atoms that are different from the atoms of all
other elements. This gives each element a unique atomic structure. According to the clas-
sical Bohr model, atoms have a planetary type of structure that consists of a central nucleus
surrounded by orbiting electrons, as illustrated in Figure 1–1. The nucleus consists of pos-
itively charged particles called protons and uncharged particles called neutrons. The
basic particles of negative charge are called electrons.
Each type of atom has a certain number of electrons and protons that distinguishes it
from the atoms of all other elements. For example, the simplest atom is that of hydrogen,
which has one proton and one electron, as shown in Figure 1–2(a). As another example, the
helium atom, shown in Figure 1–2(b), has two protons and two neutrons in the nucleus and
two electrons orbiting the nucleus.
Atomic Number
All elements are arranged in the periodic table of the elements in order according to their
atomic number. The atomic number equals the number of protons in the nucleus, which is
the same as the number of electrons in an electrically balanced (neutral) atom. For example,
hydrogen has an atomic number of 1 and helium has an atomic number of 2. In their normal
(or neutral) state, all atoms of a given element have the same number of electrons as protons;
the positive charges cancel the negative charges, and the atom has a net charge of zero.
*All bold terms are in the end-of-book glossary. The bold terms in color are key terms and are also defined
at the end of the chapter.

THE ATOM
All matter is composed of atoms; all atoms consist of electrons, protons, and neutrons
except normal hydrogen, which does not have a neutron. Each element in the periodic
table has a unique atomic structure, and all atoms within a given element have the same
number of protons. At first, the atom was thought to be a tiny indivisible sphere. Later it
was shown that the atom was not a single particle but was made up of a small dense
nucleus around which electrons orbit at great distances from the nucleus, similar to the
way planets orbit the sun. Niels Bohr proposed that the electrons in an atom circle the
nucleus in different obits, similar to the way planets orbit the sun in our solar system. The
Bohr model is often referred to as the planetary model. Another view of the atom called
the quantum model is considered a more accurate representation, but it is difficult to
visualize. For most practical purposes in electronics, the Bohr model suffices and is
commonly used because it is easy to visualize.
After completing this section, you should be able to
❏Describe the structure of an atom
◆Discuss the Bohr model of an atom
◆Define electron, proton, neutron, and
nucleus
❏Define atomic number
❏Discuss electron shells and orbits
◆Explain energy levels
❏Define valence electron
❏Discuss ionization
◆Define free electron and ion
❏Discuss the basic concept of the quantum model of the atom
Niels Henrik David Bohr (October 7,
1885–November 18, 1962) was a
Danish physicist, who made
important contributions to
understanding the structure of the
atom and quantum mechanics by
postulating the “planetary” model
of the atom. He received the Nobel
prize in physics in 1922. Bohr drew
upon the work or collaborated
with scientists such as Dalton,
Thomson, and Rutherford, among
others and has been described as
one of the most influential
physicists of the 20th century.

Electrons and Shells
Energy Levels
Electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom at certain distances from the nu-
cleus. Electrons near the nucleus have less energy than those in more distant orbits. Only
discrete (separate and distinct) values of electron energies exist within atomic structures.
Therefore, electrons must orbit only at discrete distances from the nucleus.
Each discrete distance (orbit) from the nucleus corresponds to a certain energy level. In
an atom, the orbits are grouped into energy levels known as shells. A given atom has a
fixed number of shells. Each shell has a fixed maximum number of electrons. The shells
(energy levels) are designated 1, 2, 3, and so on, with 1 being closest to the nucleus. The
Bohr model of the silicon atom is shown in Figure 1–4. Notice that there are 14 electrons
and 14 each of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.

Valence Electrons
Electrons that are in orbits farther from the nucleus have higher energy and are less tightly
bound to the atom than those closer to the nucleus. This is because the force of attraction
between the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electron decreases with
increasing distance from the nucleus. Electrons with the highest energy exist in the outer-
most shell of an atom and are relatively loosely bound to the atom. This outermost shell is
known as the valence shell and electrons in this shell are called valence electrons. These
valence electrons contribute to chemical reactions and bonding within the structure of a
material and determine its electrical properties. When a valence electron gains sufficient
energy from an external source, it can break free from its atom. This is the basis for con-
duction in materials.
Ionization
When an atom absorbs energy from a heat source or from light, for example, the energies
of the electrons are raised. The valence electrons possess more energy and are more
loosely bound to the atom than inner electrons, so they can easily jump to higher energy
shells when external energy is absorbed by the atom.
If a valence electron acquires a sufficient amount of energy, called ionization energy, it
can actually escape from the outer shell and the atom’s influence. The departure of a valence
electron leaves a previously neutral atom with an excess of positive charge (more protons
than electrons). The process of losing a valence electron is known as ionization, and the
resulting positively charged atom is called a positive ion. For example, the chemical symbol
for hydrogen is H. When a neutral hydrogen atom loses its valence electron and becomes a
positive ion, it is designated H. The escaped valence electron is called a free electron.
The reverse process can occur in certain atoms when a free electron collides with the atom
and is captured, releasing energy. The atom that has acquired the extra electron is called a
negative ion. The ionization process is not restricted to single atoms. In many chemical reac-
tions, a group of atoms that are bonded together can lose or acquire one or more electrons.
For some nonmetallic materials such as chlorine, a free electron can be captured by the
neutral atom, forming a negative ion. In the case of chlorine, the ion is more stable than the
neutral atom because it has a filled outer shell. The chlorine ion is designated as 
The Quantum Model
Although the Bohr model of an atom is widely used because of its simplicity and ease of
visualization, it is not a complete model. The quantum model, a more recent model, is con-
sidered to be more accurate. The quantum model is a statistical model and very difficult to
understand or visualize. Like the Bohr model, the quantum model has a nucleus of protons
and neutrons surrounded by electrons. Unlike the Bohr model, the electrons in the quan-
tum model do not exist in precise circular orbits as particles. Two important theories under-
lie the quantum model: the wave-particle duality and the uncertainty principle.
◆Wave-particle duality.
Just as light can be both a wave and a particle (photon),
electrons are thought to exhibit a dual characteristic. The velocity of an orbiting elec-
tron is considered to be its wavelength, which interferes with neighboring electron
waves by amplifying or canceling each other.
Cl-.
Ne = 2n2 = 2(4)2 = 2(16) = 32
Ne = 2n2 = 2(3)2 = 2(9) = 18
Ne = 2n2 = 2(2)2 = 2(4) = 8
Atoms are extremely small and
cannot be seen even with the
strongest optical microscopes;
however, a scanning tunneling
microscope can detect a single
atom. The nucleus is so small and
the electrons orbit at such
distances that the atom is mostly
empty space. To put it in
perspective, if the proton in a
hydrogen atom were the size of a
golf ball, the electron orbit would
be approximately one mile away.
Protons and neutrons are
approximately the same mass. The
mass of an electron is 1 1836 of a
proton. Within protons and
neutrons there are even smaller
particles called quarks.

INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONICS
◆Uncertainly principle.
As you know, a wave is characterized by peaks and valleys;
therefore, electrons acting as waves cannot be precisely identified in terms of their posi-
tion. According to Heisenberg, it is impossible to determine simultaneously both the
position and velocity of an electron with any degree of accuracy or certainty. The result
of this principle produces a concept of the atom with probability clouds, which are
mathematical descriptions of where electrons in an atom are most likely to be located.
In the quantum model, each shell or energy level consists of up to four subshells called
orbitals, which are designated s, p, d, and f. Orbital s can hold a maximum of two electrons,
orbital p can hold six electrons, orbital d can hold ten electrons, and orbital f can hold four-
teen electrons. Each atom can be described by an electron configuration table that shows
the shells or energy levels, the orbitals, and the number of electrons in each orbital. For
example, the electron configuration table for the nitrogen atom is given in Table 1–1. The
first full-size number is the shell or energy level, the letter is the orbital, and the exponent
is the number of electrons in the orbital.
De Broglie showed that every
particle has wave characteristics.
Schrodiger developed a wave
equation for electrons.

Atomic orbitals do not resemble a discrete circular path for the electron as depicted in
Bohr’s planetary model. In the quantum picture, each shell in the Bohr model is a three-
dimensional space surrounding the atom that represents the mean (average) energy of the
electron cloud. The term electron cloud (probability cloud) is used to describe the area
around an atom’s nucleus where an electron will probably be found.
Using the atomic number from the periodic table in Figure 1–3, describe a silicon (Si)
atom using an electron configuration table.
Solution
The atomic number of silicon is 14. This means that there are 14 protons in the nucleus.
Since there is always the same number of electrons as protons in a neutral atom, there
are also 14 electrons. As you know, there can be up to two electrons in shell 1, eight in
shell 2, and eighteen in shell 3. Therefore, in silicon there are two electrons in shell 1,
eight electrons in shell 2, and four electrons in shell 3 for a total of 14 electrons. The
electron configuration table for silicon is shown in Table 1–2.

In a three-dimensional representation of the quantum model of an atom, the s-orbitals
are shaped like spheres with the nucleus in the center. For energy level 1, the sphere is
“solid” but for energy levels 2 or more, each single s-orbital is composed of spherical surfaces
that are nested shells. A p-orbital for shell 2 has the form of two ellipsoidal lobes with a
point of tangency at the nucleus (sometimes referred to as a dumbbell shape.) The three

MATERIALS USED IN ELECTRONICS
In terms of their electrical properties, materials can be classified into three groups: con-
ductors, semiconductors, and insulators. When atoms combine to form a solid, crystalline
material, they arrange themselves in a symmetrical pattern. The atoms within the crystal
structure are held together by covalent bonds, which are created by the interaction of the
valence electrons of the atoms. Silicon is a crystalline material.

INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONICS
Insulators, Conductors, and Semiconductors
All materials are made up of atoms. These atoms contribute to the electrical properties of a
material, including its ability to conduct electrical current.
For purposes of discussing electrical properties, an atom can be represented by the
valence shell and a core that consists of all the inner shells and the nucleus. This concept is
illustrated in Figure 1–6 for a carbon atom. Carbon is used in some types of electrical
resistors. Notice that the carbon atom has four electrons in the valence shell and two electrons
in the inner shell. The nucleus consists of six protons and six neutrons, so the 6 indicates
the positive charge of the six protons. The core has a net charge of 4 (6 for the nucleus
and 
for the two inner-shell electrons).
Insulators
An insulator is a material that does not conduct electrical current under nor-
mal conditions. Most good insulators are compounds rather than single-element materials
and have very high resistivities. Valence electrons are tightly bound to the atoms; there-
fore, there are very few free electrons in an insulator. Examples of insulators are rubber,
plastics, glass, mica, and quartz.
Conductors
A conductor is a material that easily conducts electrical current. Most
metals are good conductors. The best conductors are single-element materials, such as
copper (Cu), silver (Ag), gold (Au), and aluminum (Al), which are characterized by atoms
with only one valence electron very loosely bound to the atom. These loosely bound va-
lence electrons become free electrons. Therefore, in a conductive material the free elec-
trons are valence electrons.
Semiconductors
A semiconductor is a material that is between conductors and insula-
tors in its ability to conduct electrical current. A semiconductor in its pure (intrinsic) state
is neither a good conductor nor a good insulator. Single-element semiconductors are
antimony (Sb), arsenic (As), astatine (At), boron (B), polonium (Po), tellurium (Te),
silicon (Si), and germanium (Ge). Compound semiconductors such as gallium arsenide,
indium phosphide, gallium nitride, silicon carbide, and silicon germanium are also com-
monly used. The single-element semiconductors are characterized by atoms with four va-
lence electrons. Silicon is the most commonly used semiconductor.
Band Gap
Recall that the valence shell of an atom represents a band of energy levels and that the va-
lence electrons are confined to that band. When an electron acquires enough additional en-
ergy, it can leave the valence shell, become a free electron, and exist in what is known as
the conduction band.
The difference in energy between the valence band and the conduction band is called
an energy gap or band gap. This is the amount of energy that a valence electron must
have in order to jump from the valence band to the conduction band. Once in the conduc-
tion band, the electron is free to move throughout the material and is not tied to any
given atom.
Figure 1–7 shows energy diagrams for insulators, semiconductors, and conductors. The
energy gap or band gap is the difference between two energy levels and is “not allowed” in
quantum theory. It is a region in insulators and semiconductors where no electron states
exist. Although an electron may not exist in this region, it can “jump” across it under cer-
tain conditions. For insulators, the gap can be crossed only when breakdown conditions
occur—as when a very high voltage is applied across the material. The band gap is illus-
trated in Figure 1–7(a) for insulators. In semiconductors the band gap is smaller, allowing
an electron in the valence band to jump into the conduction band if it absorbs a photon. The
band gap depends on the semiconductor material. This is illustrated in Figure 1–7(b). In
conductors, the conduction band and valence band overlap, so there is no gap, as shown in
Figure 1–7(c). This means that electrons in the valence band move freely into the conduc-
tion band, so there are always electrons available as free electrons.

Next to silicon, the second most
common semiconductive material
is gallium arsenide, GaAs. This is a
crystalline compound, not an
element. Its properties can be
controlled by varying the relative
amount of gallium and arsenic.
GaAs has the advantage of
making semiconductor devices that
respond very quickly to electrical
signals. This makes it better than
silicon for applications like
amplifying the high frequency 
(1 GHz to 10 GHz) signals from TV
satellites, etc. The main
disadvantage of GaAs is that it is
more difficult to make and the
chemicals involved are quite often
toxic!

Comparison of a Semiconductor Atom to a Conductor Atom
Silicon is a semiconductor and copper is a conductor. Bohr diagrams of the silicon atom and
the copper atom are shown in Figure 1–8. Notice that the core of the silicon atom has a net
charge of 4 (14 protons  10 electrons) and the core of the copper atom has a net charge of
1 (29 protons  28 electrons). The core includes everything except the valence electrons.

Energy diagrams for the three types
of materials.
The valence electron in the copper atom “feels” an attractive force of 1 compared to a
valence electron in the silicon atom which “feels” an attractive force of 4. Therefore,
there is more force trying to hold a valence electron to the atom in silicon than in copper.
The copper’s valence electron is in the fourth shell, which is a greater distance from its nu-
cleus than the silicon’s valence electron in the third shell. Recall that electrons farthest
from the nucleus have the most energy. The valence electron in copper has more energy
than the valence electron in silicon. This means that it is easier for valence electrons in
copper to acquire enough additional energy to escape from their atoms and become free
electrons than it is in silicon. In fact, large numbers of valence electrons in copper already
have sufficient energy to be free electrons at normal room temperature.
Silicon and Germanium
The atomic structures of silicon and germanium are compared in Figure 1–9. Silicon is
used in diodes, transistors, integrated circuits, and other semiconductor devices. Notice
that both silicon and germanium have the characteristic four valence electrons.

The valence electrons in germanium are in the fourth shell while those in silicon are in
the third shell, closer to the nucleus. This means that the germanium valence electrons are
at higher energy levels than those in silicon and, therefore, require a smaller amount of ad-
ditional energy to escape from the atom. This property makes germanium more unstable at
high temperatures and results in excessive reverse current. This is why silicon is a more
widely used semiconductive material.
Covalent Bonds
Figure 1–10 shows how each silicon atom positions itself with four
adjacent silicon atoms to form a silicon crystal. A silicon (Si) atom with its four valence
electrons shares an electron with each of its four neighbors. This effectively creates eight
shared valence electrons for each atom and produces a state of chemical stability. Also, this
sharing of valence electrons produces the covalent bonds that hold the atoms together;
each valence electron is attracted equally by the two adjacent atoms which share it.
Covalent bonding in an intrinsic silicon crystal is shown in Figure 1–11. An intrinsic crys-
tal is one that has no impurities. Covalent bonding for germanium is similar because it also
has four valence electrons.

CURRENT IN SEMICONDUCTORS
The way a material conducts electrical current is important in understanding how
electronic devices operate. You can’t really understand the operation of a device such
as a diode or transistor without knowing something about current in semiconductors.
After completing this section, you should be able to
❏Describe how current is produced in a semiconductor
❏Discuss conduction electrons and holes
◆Explain an electron-hole pair
◆Discuss recombination
❏Explain electron and hole current
As you have learned, the electrons of an atom can exist only within prescribed energy
bands. Each shell around the nucleus corresponds to a certain energy band and is separated
from adjacent shells by band gaps, in which no electrons can exist. Figure 1–12 shows the
energy band diagram for an unexcited (no external energy such as heat) atom in a pure sil-
icon crystal. This condition occurs only at a temperature of absolute 0 Kelvin.

INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONICS
Conduction Electrons and Holes
An intrinsic (pure) silicon crystal at room temperature has sufficient heat (thermal) energy
for some valence electrons to jump the gap from the valence band into the conduction band,
becoming free electrons. Free electrons are also called conduction electrons. This is illus-
trated in the energy diagram of Figure 1–13(a) and in the bonding diagram of Figure 1–13(b).

Creation of electron-hole pairs in a

When an electron jumps to the conduction band, a vacancy is left in the valence band
within the crystal. This vacancy is called a hole. For every electron raised to the conduc-
tion band by external energy, there is one hole left in the valence band, creating what is
called an electron-hole pair. Recombination occurs when a conduction-band electron
loses energy and falls back into a hole in the valence band.
To summarize, a piece of intrinsic silicon at room temperature has, at any instant, a
number of conduction-band (free) electrons that are unattached to any atom and are essen-
tially drifting randomly throughout the material. There is also an equal number of holes in
the valence band created when these electrons jump into the conduction band. This is illus-
trated in Figure 1–14.

Electron and Hole Current
When a voltage is applied across a piece of intrinsic silicon, as shown in Figure 1-15, the ther-
mally generated free electrons in the conduction band, which are free to move randomly in
the crystal structure, are now easily attracted toward the positive end. This movement of free
electrons is one type of current in a semiconductive material and is called electron current.

Free electrons are being generated
continuously while some recombine
with holes.
Another type of current occurs in the valence band, where the holes created by the free
electrons exist. Electrons remaining in the valence band are still attached to their atoms
and are not free to move randomly in the crystal structure as are the free electrons.
However, a valence electron can move into a nearby hole with little change in its energy
level, thus leaving another hole where it came from. Effectively the hole has moved from
one place to another in the crystal structure, as illustrated in Figure 1–16. Although current
in the valence band is produced by valence electrons, it is called hole current to distinguish
it from electron current in the conduction band.
As you have seen, conduction in semiconductors is considered to be either the move-
ment of free electrons in the conduction band or the movement of holes in the valence
band, which is actually the movement of valence electrons to nearby atoms, creating hole
current in the opposite direction.
It is interesting to contrast the two types of charge movement in a semiconductor with
the charge movement in a metallic conductor, such as copper. Copper atoms form a differ-
ent type of crystal in which the atoms are not covalently bonded to each other but consist
of a “sea” of positive ion cores, which are atoms stripped of their valence electrons. The
valence electrons are attracted to the positive ions, keeping the positive ions together and
forming the metallic bond. The valence electrons do not belong to a given atom, but to the
crystal as a whole. Since the valence electrons in copper are free to move, the application
of a voltage results in current. There is only one type of current—the movement of free
electrons—because there are no “holes” in the metallic crystal structure.

INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONICS
Since semiconductors are generally poor conductors, their conductivity can be drasti-
cally increased by the controlled addition of impurities to the intrinsic (pure) semiconductive
material. This process, called doping, increases the number of current carriers (electrons
or holes). The two categories of impurities are n-type and p-type.
N-Type Semiconductor
To increase the number of conduction-band electrons in intrinsic silicon, pentavalent im-
purity atoms are added. These are atoms with five valence electrons such as arsenic (As),
phosphorus (P), bismuth (Bi), and antimony (Sb).

N-TYPE AND P-TYPE SEMICONDUCTORS
Semiconductive materials do not conduct current well and are of limited value in their
intrinsic state. This is because of the limited number of free electrons in the conduction
band and holes in the valence band. Intrinsic silicon (or germanium) must be modified by
increasing the number of free electrons or holes to increase its conductivity and make it
useful in electronic devices. This is done by adding impurities to the intrinsic material.
Two types of extrinsic (impure) semiconductive materials, n-type and p-type, are the key
building blocks for most types of electronic devices.
After completing this section, you should be able to
❏Describe the properties of n-type and p-type semiconductors

As illustrated in Figure 1–17, each pentavalent atom (antimony, in this case) forms co-
valent bonds with four adjacent silicon atoms. Four of the antimony atom’s valence elec-
trons are used to form the covalent bonds with silicon atoms, leaving one extra electron.
This extra electron becomes a conduction electron because it is not involved in bonding.
Because the pentavalent atom gives up an electron, it is often called a donor atom. The
number of conduction electrons can be carefully controlled by the number of impurity
atoms added to the silicon. A conduction electron created by this doping process does not
leave a hole in the valence band because it is in excess of the number required to fill the
valence band.
Majority and Minority Carriers
Since most of the current carriers are electrons, silicon
(or germanium) doped with pentavalent atoms is an n-type semiconductor (the n stands for
the negative charge on an electron). The electrons are called the majority carriers in
n-type material. Although the majority of current carriers in n-type material are electrons,
there are also a few holes that are created when electron-hole pairs are thermally gener-
ated. These holes are not produced by the addition of the pentavalent impurity atoms.
Holes in an n-type material are called minority carriers.
P-Type Semiconductor
To increase the number of holes in intrinsic silicon, trivalent impurity atoms are added.
These are atoms with three valence electrons such as boron (B), indium (In), and gallium
(Ga). As illustrated in Figure 1–18, each trivalent atom (boron, in this case) forms covalent
bonds with four adjacent silicon atoms. All three of the boron atom’s valence electrons are
used in the covalent bonds; and, since four electrons are required, a hole results when each
trivalent atom is added. Because the trivalent atom can take an electron, it is often referred
to as an acceptor atom. The number of holes can be carefully controlled by the number of
trivalent impurity atoms added to the silicon. A hole created by this doping process is not
accompanied by a conduction (free) electron.
Majority and Minority Carriers
Since most of the current carriers are holes, silicon (or
germanium) doped with trivalent atoms is called a p-type semiconductor. The holes are the
majority carriers in p-type material. Although the majority of current carriers in p-type
material are holes, there are also a few conduction-band electrons that are created when
electron-hole pairs are thermally generated. These conduction-band electrons are not pro-
duced by the addition of the trivalent impurity atoms. Conduction-band electrons in p-type
material are the minority carriers.

THE PN JUNCTION
When you take a block of silicon and dope part of it with a trivalent impurity and the other
part with a pentavalent impurity, a boundary called the pn junction is formed between the
resulting p-type and n-type portions. The pn junction is the basis for diodes, certain transis-
tors, solar cells, and other devices, as you will learn later.
After completing this section, you should be able to

◆Define barrier potential and discuss its significance
◆State the values of barrier
potential in silicon and germanium
❏Discuss energy diagrams
◆Define energy hill
A p-type material consists of silicon atoms and trivalent impurity atoms such as boron.
The boron atom adds a hole when it bonds with the silicon atoms. However, since the num-
ber of protons and the number of electrons are equal throughout the material, there is no
net charge in the material and so it is neutral.

THE PN JUNCTION
◆
17
An n-type silicon material consists of silicon atoms and pentavalent impurity atoms such as
antimony. As you have seen, an impurity atom releases an electron when it bonds with four
silicon atoms. Since there is still an equal number of protons and electrons (including the free
electrons) throughout the material, there is no net charge in the material and so it is neutral.
If a piece of intrinsic silicon is doped so that part is n-type and the other part is p-type,
a pn junction forms at the boundary between the two regions and a diode is created, as
indicated in Figure 1–19(a). The p region has many holes (majority carriers) from the
impurity atoms and only a few thermally generated free electrons (minority carriers). The
n region has many free electrons (majority carriers) from the impurity atoms and only a
few thermally generated holes (minority carriers).

After the invention of the light bulb,
Edison continued to experiment and
in 1883 found that he could detect
electrons flowing through the
vacuum from the lighted filament to
a metal plate mounted inside the
bulb. This discovery became known
as the Edison effect.
An English physicist, John
Fleming, took up where Edison left
off and found that the Edison effect
could also be used to detect radio
waves and convert them to electrical
signals. He went on to develop a
two-element vacuum tube called the
Fleming valve, later known as the
diode. Modern pn junction devices
are an outgrowth of this.
H I S T O R Y  N O T E
Formation of the Depletion Region
The free electrons in the n region are randomly drifting in all directions. At the instant of
the pn junction formation, the free electrons near the junction in the n region begin to dif-
fuse across the junction into the p region where they combine with holes near the junction,
as shown in Figure 1–19(b).
Before the pn junction is formed, recall that there are as many electrons as protons in
the n-type material, making the material neutral in terms of net charge. The same is true for
the p-type material.
When the pn junction is formed, the n region loses free electrons as they diffuse across
the junction. This creates a layer of positive charges (pentavalent ions) near the junction.
As the electrons move across the junction, the p region loses holes as the electrons and
holes combine. This creates a layer of negative charges (trivalent ions) near the junction.
These two layers of positive and negative charges form the depletion region, as shown in
Figure 1–19(b). The term depletion refers to the fact that the region near the pn junction is
depleted of charge carriers (electrons and holes) due to diffusion across the junction. Keep
in mind that the depletion region is formed very quickly and is very thin compared to the n
region and p region. 
After the initial surge of free electrons across the pn junction, the depletion region has
expanded to a point where equilibrium is established and there is no further diffusion of

18
◆
INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONICS
electrons across the junction. This occurs as follows. As electrons continue to diffuse
across the junction, more and more positive and negative charges are created near the junc-
tion as the depletion region is formed. A point is reached where the total negative charge in
the depletion region repels any further diffusion of electrons (negatively charged particles)
into the p region (like charges repel) and the diffusion stops. In other words, the depletion
region acts as a barrier to the further movement of electrons across the junction.
Barrier Potential
Any time there is a positive charge and a negative charge near each
other, there is a force acting on the charges as described by Coulomb’s law. In the depletion re-
gion there are many positive charges and many negative charges on opposite sides of the pn
junction. The forces between the opposite charges form an electric field, as illustrated in
Figure 1–19(b) by the blue arrows between the positive charges and the negative charges. This
electric field is a barrier to the free electrons in the n region, and energy must be expended to
move an electron through the electric field. That is, external energy must be applied to get the
electrons to move across the barrier of the electric field in the depletion region.
The potential difference of the electric field across the depletion region is the amount of
voltage required to move electrons through the electric field. This potential difference is
called the barrier potential and is expressed in volts. Stated another way, a certain
amount of voltage equal to the barrier potential and with the proper polarity must be ap-
plied across a pn junction before electrons will begin to flow across the junction. You will
learn more about this when we discuss biasing in Chapter 2.
The barrier potential of a pn junction depends on several factors, including the type of
semiconductive material, the amount of doping, and the temperature. The typical barrier
potential is approximately 0.7 V for silicon and 0.3 V for germanium at 
Because ger-
manium devices are not widely used, silicon will be used throughout the rest of the book.
Energy Diagrams of the PN Junction and Depletion Region
The valence and conduction bands in an n-type material are at slightly lower energy levels
than the valence and conduction bands in a p-type material. Recall that p-type material has
trivalent impurities and n-type material has pentavalent impurities. The trivalent impurities
exert lower forces on the outer-shell electrons than the pentavalent impurities. The lower
forces in p-type materials mean that the electron orbits are slightly larger and hence have
greater energy than the electron orbits in the n-type materials.
An energy diagram for a pn junction at the instant of formation is shown in Figure
1–20(a). As you can see, the valence and conduction bands in the n region are at lower en-
ergy levels than those in the p region, but there is a significant amount of overlapping.
The free electrons in the n region that occupy the upper part of the conduction band in
terms of their energy can easily diffuse across the junction (they do not have to gain addi-
tional energy) and temporarily become free electrons in the lower part of the p-region con-
duction band. After crossing the junction, the electrons quickly lose energy and fall into
the holes in the p-region valence band as indicated in Figure 1-20(a).
As the diffusion continues, the depletion region begins to form and the energy level of
the n-region conduction band decreases. The decrease in the energy level of the conduction
band in the n region is due to the loss of the higher-energy electrons that have diffused
across the junction to the p region. Soon, there are no electrons left in the n-region conduc-
tion band with enough energy to get across the junction to the p-region conduction band, as
indicated by the alignment of the top of the n-region conduction band and the bottom of the
p-region conduction band in Figure 1–20(b). At this point, the junction is at equilibrium;
and the depletion region is complete because diffusion has ceased. There is an energy gra-
diant across the depletion region which acts as an “energy hill” that an n-region electron
must climb to get to the p region.
Notice that as the energy level of the n-region conduction band has shifted downward,
the energy level of the valence band has also shifted downward. It still takes the same
amount of energy for a valence electron to become a free electron. In other words, the en-
ergy gap between the valence band and the conduction band remains the same.

Russell Ohl, working at Bell Labs
in 1940, stumbled on the
semiconductor pn junction. Ohl
was working with a silicon sample
that had an accidental crack down
its middle. He was using an
ohmmeter to test the electrical
resistance of the sample when he
noted that when the sample was
exposed to light, the current that
flowed between the two sides of
the crack made a significant jump.
This discovery was fundamental to
the work of the team that invented
the transistor in 1947.

SUMMARY
Section 1–1
◆According to the classical Bohr model, the atom is viewed as having a planetary-type structure
with electrons orbiting at various distances around the central nucleus.
◆According to the quantum model, electrons do not exist in precise circular orbits as particles as
in the Bohr model. The electrons can be waves or particles and precise location at any time is
uncertain.
◆The nucleus of an atom consists of protons and neutrons. The protons have a positive charge and
the neutrons are uncharged. The number of protons is the atomic number of the atom.
◆Electrons have a negative charge and orbit around the nucleus at distances that depend on their
energy level. An atom has discrete bands of energy called shells in which the electrons orbit.
Atomic structure allows a certain maximum number of electrons in each shell. In their natural
state, all atoms are neutral because they have an equal number of protons and electrons.
◆The outermost shell or band of an atom is called the valence band, and electrons that orbit in
this band are called valence electrons. These electrons have the highest energy of all those in the
atom. If a valence electron acquires enough energy from an outside source such as heat, it can
jump out of the valence band and break away from its atom.
Section 1–2
◆Insulating materials have very few free electrons and do not conduct current at all under normal
circumstances.
◆Materials that are conductors have a large number of free electrons and conduct current very well.
◆Semiconductive materials fall in between conductors and insulators in their ability to conduct
current.
◆Semiconductor atoms have four valence electrons. Silicon is the most widely used semiconduc-
tive material.

INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONICS
◆Semiconductor atoms bond together in a symmetrical pattern to form a solid material called a
crystal. The bonds that hold a crystal together are called covalent bonds.
Section 1–3
◆The valence electrons that manage to escape from their parent atom are called conduction elec-
trons or free electrons. They have more energy than the electrons in the valence band and are
free to drift throughout the material.
◆When an electron breaks away to become free, it leaves a hole in the valence band creating what
is called an electron-hole pair. These electron-hole pairs are thermally produced because the
electron has acquired enough energy from external heat to break away from its atom.
◆A free electron will eventually lose energy and fall back into a hole. This is called
recombination. Electron-hole pairs are continuously being thermally generated so there are al-
ways free electrons in the material.
◆When a voltage is applied across the semiconductor, the thermally produced free electrons move
toward the positive end and form the current. This is one type of current and is called electron
current.
◆Another type of current is the hole current. This occurs as valence electrons move from hole to
hole creating, in effect, a movement of holes in the opposite direction.
Section 1–4
◆An n-type semiconductive material is created by adding impurity atoms that have five valence
electrons. These impurities are pentavalent atoms. A p-type semiconductor is created by adding
impurity atoms with only three valence electrons. These impurities are trivalent atoms.
◆The process of adding pentavalent or trivalent impurities to a semiconductor is called doping.
◆The majority carriers in an n-type semiconductor are free electrons acquired by the doping
process, and the minority carriers are holes produced by thermally generated electron-hole
pairs. The majority carriers in a p-type semiconductor are holes acquired by the doping
process, and the minority carriers are free electrons produced by thermally generated
electron-hole pairs.
Section 1–5
◆A pn junction is formed when part of a material is doped n-type and part of it is doped p-type. A
depletion region forms starting at the junction that is devoid of any majority carriers. The deple-
tion region is formed by ionization.
◆The barrier potential is typically 0.7 V for a silicon diode and 0.3 V for germanium.

INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONICS
Photovoltaic (PV) Cell Structure and Operation
The key feature of a PV (solar) cell is the pn junction that was covered in Chapter 1. The
photovoltaic effect is the basic physical process by which a solar cell converts sunlight
into electricity. Sunlight contains photons or “packets” of energy sufficient to create
electron-hole pairs in the n and p regions. Electrons accumulate in the n-region and
holes accumulate in the p region, producing a potential difference (voltage) across the
cell. When an external load is connected, the electrons flow through the semiconductor
material and provide current to the external load.
The Solar Cell Structure
Although there are other types of solar cells and continuing
research promises new developments in the future, the crystalline silicon solar cell is by far
the most widely used. A silicon solar cell consists of a thin layer or wafer of silicon that
has been doped to create a pn junction. The depth and distribution of impurity atoms can
be controlled very precisely during the doping process. The most commonly used process
for creating a silicon ingot, from which a silicon wafer is cut, is called the Czochralski
method. In this process, a seed crystal of silicon is dipped into melted polycrystalline sili-
con. As the seed crystal is withdrawn and rotated, a cylindrical ingot of silicon is formed.
Thin circular shaped-wafers are sliced from an ingot of ultra-pure silicon and then are
polished and trimmed to an octagonal, hexagonal, or rectangular shape for maximum
coverage when fitted into an array. The silicon wafer is doped so that the n region is much
thinner than the p region to permit light penetration, as shown in Figure GA1–1(a). 
A grid-work of very thin conductive contact strips are deposited on top of the wafer by
methods such as photoresist or silk-screen, as shown in part (b). The contact grid must
maximize the surface area of the silicon wafer that be exposed to the sunlight in order to
collect as much light energy as possible.

Basic construction of a PV solar cell.
The conductive grid across the top of the cell is necessary so that the electrons have a
shorter distance to travel through the silicon when an external load is connected. The far-
ther electrons travel through the silicon material, the greater the energy loss due to resist-
ance. A solid contact covering all of the bottom of the wafer is then added, as indicated in
the figure. Thickness of the solar cell compared to the surface area is greatly exaggerated
for purposes of illustration.

GREENTECH APPLICATION 1

25
After the contacts are incorporated, an antireflective coating is placed on top the contact
grid and n region, as shown in Figure GA1–1(c). This allows the solar cell to absorb as
much of the sun’s energy as possible by reducing the amount of light energy reflected
away from the surface of the cell. Finally, a glass or transparent plastic layer is attached to
the top of the cell with transparent adhesive to protect it from the weather. Figure GA1–2
shows a completed solar cell.
Operation of a Solar Cell
As indicated before, sunlight is composed of photons, or
“packets” of energy. The sun produces an astounding amount of energy. The small
fraction of the sun’s total energy that reaches the earth is enough to meet all of our power
needs many times over. There is sufficient solar energy striking the earth each hour to
meet worldwide demands for an entire year.
The n-type layer is very thin compared to the p region to allow light penetration into the
p region. The thickness of the entire cell is actually about the thickness of an eggshell.
When a photon penetrates either the n region or the p-type region and strikes a silicon
atom near the pn junction with sufficient energy to knock an electron out of the valence
band, the electron becomes a free electron and leaves a hole in the valence band, creating
an electron-hole pair. The amount of energy required to free an electron from the valence
band of a silicon atom is called the band-gap energy and is 1.12 eV (electron volts). In the
p region, the free electron is swept across the depletion region by the electric field into
the n region. In the n region, the hole is swept across the depletion region by the electric
field into the p region. Electrons accumulate in the n region, creating a negative charge;
and holes accumulate in the p region, creating a positive charge. A voltage is developed
between the n region and p region contacts, as shown in Figure GA1–3.
 FIGURE GA1–2
A complete PV solar cell.
When a load is connected to a solar cell via the top and bottom contacts, the free electrons
flow out of the n region to the grid contacts on the top surface, through the negative
contact, through the load and back into the positive contact on the bottom surface, and
into the p region where they can recombine with holes. The sunlight energy continues to
create new electron-hole pairs and the process goes on, as illustrated in Figure GA1–4.

INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONICS
Solar Cell Characteristics
Solar cells are typically 100 cm2 to 225 cm2 in size. The usable voltage from silicon solar
cells is approximately 0.5 V to 0.6 V. Terminal voltage is only slightly dependent on the
intensity of light radiation, but the current increases with light intensity. For example, a
100 cm2 silicon cell reaches a maximum current of approximately 2 A when radiated by
1000 W/m2 of light.
Figure GA1–5 shows the V-I characteristic curves for a typical solar cell for various light
intensities. Higher light intensity produces more current. The operating point for maxi-
mum power output for a given light intensity should be in the “knee” area of the curve,
as indicated by the dashed line. The load on the solar cell controls this operating point
(RL  V I).

V-I characteristic for a typical single
solar cell from increasing light 
intensities.
In a solar power system, the cell is generally loaded by a charge controller or an inverter.
A special method called maximum power point tracking will sense the operating point
and adjust the load resistance to keep it in the knee region. For example, assume the
solar cell is operating on the highest intensity curve (blue) shown in Figure GA1–5. For
maximum power (dashed line), the voltage is 0.5 V and the current is 1.5 A. For this
condition, the load is
Now, if the light intensity falls to where the cell is operating on the red curve, the current
is less and the load resistance will have to change to maintain maximum power output as
follows:
If the resistance did not change, the voltage output would drop to 
V  IR  (0.8 A)(0.33 W)  0.264 V
resulting in less than maximum power output for the red curve. Of course, the power
will still be less on the red curve than on the blue curve because the current is less.
The output voltage and current of a solar cell is also temperature dependent. Notice in
Figure GA1–6 that for a constant light intensity the output voltage decreases as the
temperature increases but the current is affected only by a small amount.

Solar Cell Panels
Currently, the problem is in harnessing solar energy in sufficient amounts and at a reason-
able cost to meet our requirements. It takes approximately a square meter solar panel to
produce 100 W in a sunny climate. Some energy can be harvested even if cloud cover
exists, but no energy can be obtained during the night.
A single solar cell is impractical for most applications because it can produce only about
0.5 V to 0.6 V. To produce higher voltages, multiple solar cells are connected in series as
shown in Figure GA1–7(a). For example, the six series cells will ideally produce 6(0.5 V)
 3 V. Since they are connected in series, the six cells will produce the same current as a
single cell. For increased current capacity, series cells are connected in parallel, as shown
in part (b). Assuming a cell can produce 2 A, the series-parallel arrangement of twelve
cells will produce 4 A at 3 V. Multiple cells connected to produce a specified power
output are called solar panels or solar modules.

Solar panels are generally available in 12 V, 24 V, 36 V, and 48 V versions. Higher output
solar panels are also available for special applications. In actuality, a 12 V solar panel
produces more than 12 V (15 V to 20 V) in order to charge a 12 V battery and compensate
for voltage drops in the series connection and other losses. Ideally, a panel with 24 individual
solar cells is required to produce an output of 12 V, assuming each cell produces 0.5 V. In

INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONICS
practice, more than thirty cells are typically used in a 12 V panel. Manufacturers usually
specify the output of a solar panel in terms of power at a certain solar radiation called the
peak sun irradiance which is 1000 W/m2. For example, a 12 V solar panel that has a
rated voltage of 17 V and produces a current of 3.5 A to a load at peak sun condition has
a specified output power of
Many solar panels can be interconnected to form large arrays for high power outputs, as
illustrated in Figure GA1–8.
P = VI = (17 V)(3.5 A) = 59.5 W
The Solar Power System
A basic solar power system that can supply power to ac loads generally consists of four
components, as shown in the block diagram in Figure GA1-9. These components are the
solar panel, the charge controller, the batteries, and the inverter. For supplying only dc
loads, such as solar-powered instruments and dc lamps, the inverter is not needed. Some
solar power systems do not include battery backup or the charge controller and are used
to provide supplemental power only when the sun is shining.
Efficiency is an important characteristic of a solar power system. Energy loss due to volt-
age drops, the photovoltaic process, and other factors are inevitable, so minimizing losses
is a critical consideration in solar power systems.

Solar Panel
The solar panel collects energy from the sun and converts it to electrical
energy through the photovoltaic process. Of course, the solar panel will not produce the
specified power output all of the time. For example, if there is 4 hours of peak sun during
a given day, a 60 W panel will produce 4  60 W  240 Wh of energy. For the hours that
the sun is not peak, the output will depend on the percentage of peak sun and is less than
the specified output. A system is typically designed taking into account the annual of av-
erage peak sun per day for a given geographical area.
Charge Controller
A charge controller, also called a charge regulator, takes the output
of the solar panel and ensures that the battery is charged efficiently and is not over-
charged. Generally, the charge controller is rated based on the amount of current it can
regulate. The operation of many solar charge controllers is based on the principle of
pulse-width modulation. Also, some controllers include a charging method that maximizes
charging, called maximum power point tracking. The charge controller and batteries in a
solar power system will be examined in more detail in GreenTech Application 2.
Battery
Deep-cycle batteries, such as lead-acid, are used in solar power systems because
they can be charged and discharged hundreds or thousands of times. Recall that batteries
are rated in ampere-hours (Ah), which specifies the current that can be supplied for certain
number of hours. For example, a 400 Ah battery can supply 400 A for one hour, 4 A for
100 hours, or 10 A for 40 hours. Batteries can be connected in series to increase voltage
or in parallel to increase amp-hrs.
Inverter
The inverter changes DC voltage stored in the battery to the standard 120 240 Vac
used in most common applications such as lighting, appliances, and motors. Basically, in
an inverter the dc from the battery is electronically switched on and off and filtered to
produce a sinusoidal ac output. The ac output is then applied to a step-up transformer to
get 120 Vac. The inverter in a solar system will be covered in more detail in GreenTech
Application 3.

INTRODUCTION
In Chapter 1, you learned that many semiconductor devices
are based on the pn junction. In this chapter, the operation
and characteristics of the diode are covered. Also, three
diode models representing three levels of approximation are
presented and testing is discussed. The importance of the
diode in electronic circuits cannot be overemphasized. Its
ability to conduct current in one direction while blocking
current in the other direction is essential to the operation of
many types of circuits. One circuit in particular is the ac
rectifier, which is covered in this chapter. Other important
applications are circuits such as diode limiters, diode
clampers, and diode voltage multipliers. A datasheet is
discussed for specific diodes.

The Diode
As mentioned, a diode is made from a small piece of semiconductor material, usually
silicon, in which half is doped as a p region and half is doped as an n region with a pn
junction and depletion region in between. The p region is called the anode and is connected
to a conductive terminal. The n region is called the cathode and is connected to a second
conductive terminal. The basic diode structure and schematic symbol are shown in
Figure 2–1.

Typical Diode Packages
Several common physical configurations of through-hole
mounted diodes are illustrated in Figure 2–2(a). The anode (A) and cathode (K) are indi-
cated on a diode in several ways, depending on the type of package. The cathode is usually
marked by a band, a tab, or some other feature. On those packages where one lead is con-
nected to the case, the case is the cathode.
Surface-Mount Diode Packages
Figure 2–2(b) shows typical diode packages for sur-
face mounting on a printed circuit board. The SOD and SOT packages have gull-wing
shaped leads. The SMA package has L-shaped leads that bend under the package. The
SOD and SMA types have a band on one end to indicate the cathode. The SOT type is a
three-terminal package in which there are either one or two diodes. In a single-diode SOT
package, pin 1 is usually the anode and pin 3 is the cathode. In a dual-diode SOT package,
pin 3 is the common terminal and can be either the anode or the cathode. Always check the
datasheet for the particular diode to verify the pin configurations.
The diodes covered in this chapter
are based on the pn junction just
like the solar cell, also known as
the photovoltaic cell or PV cell,
that was introduced in Chapter 1.
A solar cell is basically a diode
with a different geometric
construction than rectifier and
signal diodes. The p and n regions
in the solar cell are much thinner
to allow light energy to activate
the photovoltaic effect, and a solar
cell’s exposed surface is transparent.
G R E E N T E C H N O T E
Similar to the solar cell in Chapter 1, a diode is a two-terminal semiconductor device
formed by two doped regions of silicon separated by a pn junction. In this chapter, the
most common category of diode, known as the general-purpose diode, is covered.
Other names, such as rectifier diode or signal diode, depend on the particular type of
application for which the diode was designed. You will learn how to use a voltage to
cause the diode to conduct current in one direction and block it in the other direction.
This process is called biasing.

DIODES AND APPLICATIONS
Forward Bias
To bias a diode, you apply a dc voltage across it. Forward bias is the condition that allows
current through the pn junction. Figure 2–3 shows a dc voltage source connected by con-
ductive material (contacts and wire) across a diode in the direction to produce forward
bias. This external bias voltage is designated as VBIAS. The resistor limits the forward cur-
rent to a value that will not damage the diode. Notice that the negative side of VBIAS is con-
nected to the n region of the diode and the positive side is connected to the p region. This
is one requirement for forward bias. A second requirement is that the bias voltage, VBIAS,
must be greater than the barrier potential.

A diode connected for forward bias.
A fundamental picture of what happens when a diode is forward-biased is shown in
Figure 2–4. Because like charges repel, the negative side of the bias-voltage source
“pushes” the free electrons, which are the majority carriers in the n region, toward the pn
junction. This flow of free electrons is called electron current. The negative side of the
source also provides a continuous flow of electrons through the external connection (con-
ductor) and into the n region as shown.
The bias-voltage source imparts sufficient energy to the free electrons for them to over-
come the barrier potential of the depletion region and move on through into the p region.
Once in the p region, these conduction electrons have lost enough energy to immediately
combine with holes in the valence band.

 FIGURE 2–4

flow of majority carriers and the
voltage due to the barrier potential
across the depletion region.
Now, the electrons are in the valence band in the p region, simply because they have
lost too much energy overcoming the barrier potential to remain in the conduction
band. Since unlike charges attract, the positive side of the bias-voltage source attracts
the valence electrons toward the left end of the p region. The holes in the p region
provide the medium or “pathway” for these valence electrons to move through the p re-
gion. The valence electrons move from one hole to the next toward the left. The holes,
which are the majority carriers in the p region, effectively (not actually) move to the
right toward the junction, as you can see in Figure 2–4. This effective flow of holes is
the hole current. You can also view the hole current as being created by the flow of
valence electrons through the p region, with the holes providing the only means for
these electrons to flow.
As the electrons flow out of the p region through the external connection (conductor)
and to the positive side of the bias-voltage source, they leave holes behind in the p region;
at the same time, these electrons become conduction electrons in the metal conductor.
Recall that the conduction band in a conductor overlaps the valence band so that it takes
much less energy for an electron to be a free electron in a conductor than in a semiconduc-
tor and that metallic conductors do not have holes in their structure. There is a continuous
availability of holes effectively moving toward the pn junction to combine with the contin-
uous stream of electrons as they come across the junction into the p region.
The Effect of Forward Bias on the Depletion Region
As more electrons flow into the
depletion region, the number of positive ions is reduced. As more holes effectively flow
into the depletion region on the other side of the pn junction, the number of negative ions
is reduced. This reduction in positive and negative ions during forward bias causes the de-
pletion region to narrow, as indicated in Figure 2–5.

DIODES AND APPLICATIONS
The Effect of the Barrier Potential During Forward Bias
Recall that the electric field
between the positive and negative ions in the depletion region on either side of the junction
creates an “energy hill” that prevents free electrons from diffusing across the junction at
equilibrium. This is known as the barrier potential.
When forward bias is applied, the free electrons are provided with enough energy
from the bias-voltage source to overcome the barrier potential and effectively “climb
the energy hill” and cross the depletion region. The energy that the electrons require in
order to pass through the depletion region is equal to the barrier potential. In other
words, the electrons give up an amount of energy equivalent to the barrier potential
when they cross the depletion region. This energy loss results in a voltage drop across
the pn junction equal to the barrier potential (0.7 V), as indicated in Figure 2–5(b). An
additional small voltage drop occurs across the p and n regions due to the internal re-
sistance of the material. For doped semiconductive material, this resistance, called the
dynamic resistance, is very small and can usually be neglected. This is discussed in
more detail in Section 2–2.
Reverse Bias
Reverse bias is the condition that essentially prevents current through the diode. Figure 2–6
shows a dc voltage source connected across a diode in the direction to produce reverse
bias. This external bias voltage is designated as VBIAS just as it was for forward bias.
Notice that the positive side of VBIAS is connected to the n region of the diode and the neg-
ative side is connected to the p region. Also note that the depletion region is shown much
wider than in forward bias or equilibrium.

A limiting resistor is shown although
it is not important in reverse bias 
because there is essentially no current.
An illustration of what happens when a diode is reverse-biased is shown in Figure 2–7.
Because unlike charges attract, the positive side of the bias-voltage source “pulls” the
free electrons, which are the majority carriers in the n region, away from the pn junction.
As the electrons flow toward the positive side of the voltage source, additional positive
ions are created. This results in a widening of the depletion region and a depletion of
majority carriers.

DIODE OPERATION

35
In the p region, electrons from the negative side of the voltage source enter as valence
electrons and move from hole to hole toward the depletion region where they create addi-
tional negative ions. This results in a widening of the depletion region and a depletion of
majority carriers. The flow of valence electrons can be viewed as holes being “pulled” to-
ward the positive side.
The initial flow of charge carriers is transitional and lasts for only a very short time
after the reverse-bias voltage is applied. As the depletion region widens, the availability
of majority carriers decreases. As more of the n and p regions become depleted of majority
carriers, the electric field between the positive and negative ions increases in strength
until the potential across the depletion region equals the bias voltage, VBIAS. At this point,
the transition current essentially ceases except for a very small reverse current that can
usually be neglected.
Reverse Current
The extremely small current that exists in reverse bias after the tran-
sition current dies out is caused by the minority carriers in the n and p regions that are
produced by thermally generated electron-hole pairs. The small number of free minority
electrons in the p region are “pushed” toward the pn junction by the negative bias voltage.
When these electrons reach the wide depletion region, they “fall down the energy hill”
and combine with the minority holes in the n region as valence electrons and flow toward
the positive bias voltage, creating a small hole current.
The conduction band in the p region is at a higher energy level than the conduction
band in the n region. Therefore, the minority electrons easily pass through the depletion
region because they require no additional energy. Reverse current is illustrated in
Figure 2–8.
Reverse Breakdown
Normally, the reverse current is so small that it can be neglected.
However, if the external reverse-bias voltage is increased to a value called the breakdown
voltage, the reverse current will drastically increase.
This is what happens. The high reverse-bias voltage imparts energy to the free minority
electrons so that as they speed through the p region, they collide with atoms with enough
energy to knock valence electrons out of orbit and into the conduction band. The newly
created conduction electrons are also high in energy and repeat the process. If one electron
knocks only two others out of their valence orbit during its travel through the p region, the
numbers quickly multiply. As these high-energy electrons go through the depletion region,
they have enough energy to go through the n region as conduction electrons, rather than
combining with holes.
The multiplication of conduction electrons just discussed is known as the avalanche ef-
fect, and reverse current can increase dramatically if steps are not taken to limit the cur-
rent. When the reverse current is not limited, the resulting heating will permanently dam-
age the diode. Most diodes are not operated in reverse breakdown, but if the current is
limited (by adding a series-limiting resistor for example), there is no permanent damage to
the diode.

DIODES AND APPLICATIONS
V-I Characteristic for Forward Bias
When a forward-bias voltage is applied across a diode, there is current. This current is
called the forward current and is designated IF. Figure 2–9 illustrates what happens as the
forward-bias voltage is increased positively from 0 V. The resistor is used to limit the for-
ward current to a value that will not overheat the diode and cause damage.
With 0 V across the diode, there is no forward current. As you gradually increase the
forward-bias voltage, the forward current and the voltage across the diode gradually in-
crease, as shown in Figure 2–9(a). A portion of the forward-bias voltage is dropped across
the limiting resistor. When the forward-bias voltage is increased to a value where the volt-
age across the diode reaches approximately 0.7 V (barrier potential), the forward current
begins to increase rapidly, as illustrated in Figure 2–9(b).
As you continue to increase the forward-bias voltage, the current continues to increase
very rapidly, but the voltage across the diode increases only gradually above 0.7 V. This
small increase in the diode voltage above the barrier potential is due to the voltage drop
across the internal dynamic resistance of the semiconductive material.
Graphing the V-I Curve
If you plot the results of the type of measurements shown in
Figure 2–9 on a graph, you get the V-I characteristic curve for a forward-biased diode, as
shown in Figure 2–10(a). The diode forward voltage (VF) increases to the right along the
horizontal axis, and the forward current (IF) increases upward along the vertical axis.

VOLTAGE-CURRENT CHARACTERISTIC OF A DIODE
As you have learned, forward bias produces current through a diode and reverse bias es-
sentially prevents current, except for a negligible reverse current. Reverse bias prevents
current as long as the reverse-bias voltage does not equal or exceed the breakdown volt-
age of the junction. In this section, we will examine the relationship between the voltage
and the current in a diode on a graphical basis.

As you can see in Figure 2–10(a), the forward current increases very little until the for-
ward voltage across the pn junction reaches approximately 0.7 V at the knee of the curve.
After this point, the forward voltage remains nearly constant at approximately 0.7 V, but IF
increases rapidly. As previously mentioned, there is a slight increase in VF above 0.7 V as
the current increases due mainly to the voltage drop across the dynamic resistance. The IF
scale is typically in mA, as indicated.
Three points A, B, and C are shown on the curve in Figure 2–10(a). Point A corresponds
to a zero-bias condition. Point B corresponds to Figure 2–10(a) where the forward voltage
is less than the barrier potential of 0.7 V. Point C corresponds to Figure 2–10(a) where the
forward voltage approximately equals the barrier potential. As the external bias voltage
and forward current continue to increase above the knee, the forward voltage will increase
slightly above 0.7 V. In reality, the forward voltage can be as much as approximately 1 V,
depending on the forward current.

DIODES AND APPLICATIONS
Dynamic Resistance
Figure 2–10(b) is an expanded view of the V-I characteristic curve
in part (a) and illustrates dynamic resistance. Unlike a linear resistance, the resistance of
the forward-biased diode is not constant over the entire curve. Because the resistance
changes as you move along the V-I curve, it is called dynamic or ac resistance. Internal re-
sistances of electronic devices are usually designated by lowercase italic r with a prime, in-
stead of the standard R. The dynamic resistance of a diode is designated 
Below the knee of the curve the resistance is greatest because the current increases very
little for a given change in voltage
The resistance begins to decrease in
the region of the knee of the curve and becomes smallest above the knee where there is a
large change in current for a given change in voltage.
V-I Characteristic for Reverse Bias
When a reverse-bias voltage is applied across a diode, there is only an extremely small re-
verse current (IR) through the pn junction. With 0 V across the diode, there is no reverse
current. As you gradually increase the reverse-bias voltage, there is a very small reverse
current and the voltage across the diode increases. When the applied bias voltage is in-
creased to a value where the reverse voltage across the diode (VR) reaches the breakdown
value (VBR), the reverse current begins to increase rapidly.
As you continue to increase the bias voltage, the current continues to increase very rap-
idly, but the voltage across the diode increases very little above VBR. Breakdown, with ex-
ceptions, is not a normal mode of operation for most pn junction devices.
Graphing the V-I Curve
If you plot the results of reverse-bias measurements on a graph,
you get the V-I characteristic curve for a reverse-biased diode. A typical curve is shown in
Figure 2–11. The diode reverse voltage (VR) increases to the left along the horizontal axis,
and the reverse current (IR) increases downward along the vertical axis.
There is very little reverse current (usually
) until the reverse voltage across the
diode reaches approximately the breakdown value (VBR) at the knee of the curve. After this
point, the reverse voltage remains at approximately VBR, but IR increases very rapidly, result-
ing in overheating and possible damage if current is not limited to a safe level. The breakdown
voltage for a diode depends on the doping level, which the manufacturer sets, depending on
the type of diode. A typical rectifier diode (the most widely used type) has a breakdown volt-
age of greater than 50 V. Some specialized diodes have a breakdown voltage that is only 5 V.
The Complete V-I Characteristic Curve
Combine the curves for both forward bias and reverse bias, and you have the complete V-I

Forward-Bias
Recall that a diode is forward-biased when a voltage source is connected as
shown in Figure 2–14(a). The positive terminal of the source is connected to the anode
through a current-limiting resistor. The negative terminal of the source is connected to the
cathode. The forward current (IF) is from anode to cathode as indicated. The forward voltage
drop (VF) due to the barrier potential is from positive at the anode to negative at the cathode.

Reverse-Bias Connection
A diode is reverse-biased when a voltage source is connected
as shown in Figure 2–14(b). The negative terminal of the source is connected to the anode
side of the circuit, and the positive terminal is connected to the cathode side. A resistor is
not necessary in reverse bias but it is shown for circuit consistency. The reverse current is
extremely small and can be considered to be zero. Notice that the entire bias voltage
(VBIAS) appears across the diode.
Diode Approximations
The Ideal Diode Model
The ideal model of a diode is the least accurate approximation
and can be represented by a simple switch. When the diode is forward-biased, it ideally acts
like a closed (on) switch, as shown in Figure 2–15(a). When the diode is reverse-biased, it

ideally acts like an open (off) switch, as shown in part (b). Although the barrier potential, the
forward dynamic resistance, and the reverse current are all neglected, this model is adequate
for most troubleshooting when you are trying to determine if the diode is working properly.
In Figure 2–15(c), the ideal V-I characteristic curve graphically depicts the ideal diode
operation. Since the barrier potential and the forward dynamic resistance are neglected, the
diode is assumed to have a zero voltage across it when forward-biased, as indicated by the
portion of the curve on the positive vertical axis.
The forward current is determined by the bias voltage and the limiting resistor using
Ohm’s law.
VF = 0 V
Equation 2–1
Since the reverse current is neglected, its value is assumed to be zero, as indicated in
Figure 2–15(c) by the portion of the curve on the negative horizontal axis.
The reverse voltage equals the bias voltage.
You may want to use the ideal model when you are troubleshooting or trying to figure out
the operation of a circuit and are not concerned with more exact values of voltage or current.
The Practical Diode Model
The practical model includes the barrier potential. When the
diode is forward-biased, it is equivalent to a closed switch in series with a small equivalent
voltage source (VF) equal to the barrier potential (0.7 V) with the positive side toward the
anode, as indicated in Figure 2–16(a). This equivalent voltage source represents the barrier po-
tential that must be exceeded by the bias voltage before the diode will conduct and is not an
active source of voltage. When conducting, a voltage drop of 0.7 V appears across the diode.

DIODES AND APPLICATIONS
The forward current is determined as follows by first applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law to
Figure 2–16(a):
Substituting and solving for IF,
VRLIMIT = IFRLIMIT
VBIAS - VF - VRLIMIT = 0
The diode is assumed to have zero reverse current, as indicated by the portion of the curve
on the negative horizontal axis.
The practical model is useful when you are troubleshooting in lower-voltage cir-
cuits. In these cases, the 0.7 V drop across the diode may be significant and should be
taken into account. The practical model is also useful when you are designing basic
diode circuits.
The Complete Diode Model
The complete model of a diode is the most accurate
approximation and includes the barrier potential, the small forward dynamic resistance
and the large internal reverse resistance
The reverse resistance is taken into
account because it provides a path for the reverse current, which is included in this
diode model.
When the diode is forward-biased, it acts as a closed switch in series with the equivalent
barrier potential voltage (VB) and the small forward dynamic resistance
as indicated
in Figure 2–17(a). When the diode is reverse-biased, it acts as an open switch in parallel
with the large internal reverse resistance
as shown in Figure 2–17(b). The barrier
potential does not affect reverse bias, so it is not a factor.

HALF-WAVE RECTIFIERS
Because of their ability to conduct current in one direction and block current in the other
direction, diodes are used in circuits called rectifiers that convert ac voltage into dc voltage.
Rectifiers are found in all dc power supplies that operate from an ac voltage source. A power
supply is an essential part of each electronic system from the simplest to the most complex.
After completing this section, you should be able to

HALF-WAVE RECTIFIERS

The Basic DC Power Supply
All active electronic devices require a source of constant dc that can be supplied by a
battery or a dc power supply. The dc power supply converts the standard 120 V,
60 Hz ac voltage available at wall outlets into a constant dc voltage. The dc power sup-
ply is one of the most common circuits you will find, so it is important to understand
how it works. The voltage produced is used to power all types of electronic circuits
including consumer electronics (televisions, DVDs, etc.), computers, industrial con-
trollers, and most laboratory instrumentation systems and equipment. The dc voltage
level required depends on the application, but most applications require relatively low
voltages.
A basic block diagram of the complete power supply is shown in Figure 2–19(a).
Generally the ac input line voltage is stepped down to a lower ac voltage with a trans-
former (although it may be stepped up when higher voltages are needed or there may be
no transformer at all in rare instances). As you learned in your dc/ac course, a
transformer changes ac voltages based on the turns ratio between the primary and sec-
ondary. If the secondary has more turns than the primary, the output voltage across the
secondary will be higher and the current will be smaller. If the secondary has fewer turns
than the primary, the output voltage across the secondary will be lower and the current
will be higher. The rectifier can be either a half-wave rectifier or a full-wave rectifier
(covered in Section 2–5). The rectifier converts the ac input voltage to a pulsating dc
voltage, called a half-wave rectified voltage, as shown in Figure 2–19(b). The filter elim-
inates the fluctuations in the rectified voltage and produces a relatively smooth dc volt-
age. The power supply filter is covered in Section 2–6. The regulator is a circuit that
maintains a constant dc voltage for variations in the input line voltage or in the load.
Regulators vary from a single semiconductor device to more complex integrated circuits.
The load is a circuit or device connected to the output of the power supply and operates
from the power supply voltage and current.
The standard line voltage in North
America is 120 V/240 V at 60 Hz.
Most small appliances operate on
120 V and larger appliances such
as dryers, ranges, and heaters
operate on 240 V. Occasionally,
you will see references to 110 V or
115 V, but the standard is 120 V.
Some foreign countries do use 110 V
or 115 V at either 60 Hz or 50 Hz.

DIODES AND APPLICATIONS
Half-Wave Rectifier Operation
Figure 2–20 illustrates the process called half-wave rectification. A diode is connected to
an ac source and to a load resistor, RL, forming a half-wave rectifier. Keep in mind that
all ground symbols represent the same point electrically. Let’s examine what happens dur-
ing one cycle of the input voltage using the ideal model for the diode. When the sinusoidal
input voltage (Vin) goes positive, the diode is forward-biased and conducts current through
the load resistor, as shown in part (a). The current produces an output voltage across the
load RL, which has the same shape as the positive half-cycle of the input voltage.
The Energy Star program was
originally established by the EPA as
a voluntary labeling program
designed to indicate energy-efficient
products. In order for power
supplies to comply with the Energy
Star requirements, they must have a
minimum 80% efficiency rating for
all rated power output. Try to
choose a power supply that carries
as 80 PLUS logo on it. This means
that the power supply efficiency has
been tested and approved to meet
the Energy Star guidelines. Not all
power supplies that claim to be high
efficiency meet the Energy Star
requirements.

During the positive alternation of the 60 Hz input voltage, the output voltage looks like the positive
half of the input voltage. The current path is through ground back to the source.
 FIGURE 2–20
Half-wave rectifier operation. The diode is considered to be ideal.
When the input voltage goes negative during the second half of its cycle, the diode is
reverse-biased. There is no current, so the voltage across the load resistor is 0 V, as shown
in Figure 2–20(b). The net result is that only the positive half-cycles of the ac input voltage
appear across the load. Since the output does not change polarity, it is a pulsating dc volt-
age with a frequency of 60 Hz, as shown in part (c).
Average Value of the Half-Wave Output Voltage
The average value of the half-wave
rectified output voltage is the value you would measure on a dc voltmeter. Mathematically, it is
determined by finding the area under the curve over a full cycle, as illustrated in Figure 2–21,
and then dividing by
the number of radians in a full cycle. The result of this is expressed
in Equation 2–3, where Vp is the peak value of the voltage. This equation shows that VAVG is
approximately 31.8% of Vp for a half-wave rectified voltage. The derivation for this equation
can be found in “Derivations of Selected Equations” at www.pearsonhighered.com/floyd.

Effect of the Barrier Potential on the Half-Wave Rectifier Output
In the previous discussion, the diode was considered ideal. When the practical diode model
is used with the barrier potential of 0.7 V taken into account, this is what happens. During
the positive half-cycle, the input voltage must overcome the barrier potential before the
diode becomes forward-biased. This results in a half-wave output with a peak value that is
0.7 V less than the peak value of the input, as shown in Figure 2–23. The expression for the
peak output voltage is

barrier potential (at least 10 V, as a rule of thumb). However, we will use the practical
model of a diode, taking the 0.7 V barrier potential into account unless stated otherwise.

Peak Inverse Voltage (PIV)
The peak inverse voltage (PIV) equals the peak value of the input voltage, and the diode
must be capable of withstanding this amount of repetitive reverse voltage. For the diode in
Figure 2–26, the maximum value of reverse voltage, designated as PIV, occurs at the peak
of each negative alternation of the input voltage when the diode is reverse-biased. A diode
should be rated at least 20% higher than the PIV.

Transformer Coupling
As you have seen, a transformer is often used to couple the ac input voltage from the
source to the rectifier, as shown in Figure 2–27. Transformer coupling provides two advan-
tages. First, it allows the source voltage to be stepped down as needed. Second, the ac source
is electrically isolated from the rectifier, thus preventing a shock hazard in the secondary
circuit.

Half-wave rectifier with transformer-

The amount that the voltage is stepped down is determined by the turns ratio of the
transformer. Unfortunately, the definition of turns ratio for transformers is not consistent
between various sources and disciplines. In this text, we use the definition given by the
IEEE for electronic power transformers, which is “the number of turns in the secondary
(Nsec) divided by the number of turns in the primary (Npri).” Thus, a transformer with a
turns ratio less than 1 is a step-down type and one with a turns ratio greater than 1 is a step-
up type. To show the turns ratio on a schematic, it is common practice to show the numer-
ical ratio directly above the windings.
The secondary voltage of a transformer equals the turns ratio, n, times the primary
voltage.
If
the secondary voltage is greater than the primary voltage. If
the second-
ary voltage is less than the primary voltage. If n  1, then Vsec  Vpri.
The peak secondary voltage, Vp(sec), in a transformer-coupled half-wave rectifier is the
same as Vp(in) in Equation 2–4. Therefore, Equation 2–4 written in terms of Vp(sec) is
and Equation 2–5 in terms of Vp(sec) is
Turns ratio is useful for understanding the voltage transfer from primary to secondary.
However, transformer datasheets rarely show the turns ratio. A transformer is generally
specified based on the secondary voltage rather than the turns ratio.

A full-wave rectifier allows unidirectional (one-way) current through the load during
the entire
of the input cycle, whereas a half-wave rectifier allows current through the
load only during one-half of the cycle. The result of full-wave rectification is an output
voltage with a frequency twice the input frequency and that pulsates every half-cycle of the

DIODES AND APPLICATIONS
Center-Tapped Full-Wave Rectifier Operation
A center-tapped rectifier is a type of full-wave rectifier that uses two diodes connected to
the secondary of a center-tapped transformer, as shown in Figure 2–31. The input voltage is
coupled through the transformer to the center-tapped secondary. Half of the total secondary
voltage appears between the center tap and each end of the secondary winding as shown.
For a positive half-cycle of the input voltage, the polarities of the secondary voltages are
as shown in Figure 2–32(a). This condition forward-biases diode D1 and reverse-biases
diode D2. The current path is through D1 and the load resistor RL, as indicated. For a nega-
tive half-cycle of the input voltage, the voltage polarities on the secondary are as shown in
Figure 2–32(b). This condition reverse-biases D1 and forward-biases D2. The current path
is through D2 and RL, as indicated. Because the output current during both the positive and
negative portions of the input cycle is in the same direction through the load, the output
voltage developed across the load resistor is a full-wave rectified dc voltage, as shown.

referring to the forward voltage due to the barrier potential as the diode drop.
In order to obtain an output voltage with a peak equal to the input peak (less the diode
drop), a step-up transformer with a turns ratio of n = 2 must be used, as shown in Figure
2–34. In this case, the total secondary voltage (Vsec) is twice the primary voltage (2Vpri), so
the voltage across each half of the secondary is equal to Vpri.

The bridge rectifier uses four diodes connected as shown in Figure 2–38. When the input
cycle is positive as in part (a), diodes D1 and D2 are forward-biased and conduct current in
the direction shown. A voltage is developed across RL that looks like the positive half of
the input cycle. During this time, diodes D3 and D4 are reverse-biased.

During the negative half-cycle, D1 and D2 are reverse-biased. A full-wave rectified output

A bridge rectifier with a transformer-coupled input is shown in
Figure 2–39(a). During the positive half-cycle of the total secondary voltage, diodes D1 and D2
are forward-biased. Neglecting the diode drops, the secondary voltage appears across the load
resistor. The same is true when D3 and D4 are forward-biased during the negative half-cycle.
As you can see in Figure 2–39(b), two diodes are always in series with the load resistor
during both the positive and negative half-cycles. If these diode drops are taken into ac-

POWER SUPPLY FILTERS AND REGULATORS
A power supply filter ideally eliminates the fluctuations in the output voltage of a half-
wave or full-wave rectifier and produces a constant-level dc voltage. Filtering is neces-
sary because electronic circuits require a constant source of dc voltage and current to
provide power and biasing for proper operation. Filters are implemented with capaci-
tors, as you will see in this section. Voltage regulation in power supplies is usually
done with integrated circuit voltage regulators. A voltage regulator prevents changes in
the filtered dc voltage due to variations in input voltage or load.
 FIGURE 2–41

58
◆
DIODES AND APPLICATIONS
In most power supply applications, the standard 60 Hz ac power line voltage must be
converted to an approximately constant dc voltage. The 60 Hz pulsating dc output of a
half-wave rectifier or the 120 Hz pulsating output of a full-wave rectifier must be filtered to
reduce the large voltage variations. Figure 2–42 illustrates the filtering concept showing a
nearly smooth dc output voltage from the filter. The small amount of fluctuation in the fil-
ter output voltage is called ripple.

Capacitor-Input Filter
A half-wave rectifier with a capacitor-input filter is shown in Figure 2–43. The filter is sim-
ply a capacitor connected from the rectifier output to ground. RL represents the equivalent
resistance of a load. We will use the half-wave rectifier to illustrate the basic principle and
then expand the concept to full-wave rectification.
During the positive first quarter-cycle of the input, the diode is forward-biased, allowing
the capacitor to charge to within 0.7 V of the input peak, as illustrated in Figure 2–43(a).
When the input begins to decrease below its peak, as shown in part (b), the capacitor re-
tains its charge and the diode becomes reverse-biased because the cathode is more positive
than the anode. During the remaining part of the cycle, the capacitor can discharge only
through the load resistance at a rate determined by the RLC time constant, which is nor-
mally long compared to the period of the input. The larger the time constant, the less the
capacitor will discharge. During the first quarter of the next cycle, as illustrated in part (c),
the diode will again become forward-biased when the input voltage exceeds the capacitor
voltage by approximately 0.7 V.
When installing polarized
capacitors in a circuit, be sure to
observe the proper polarity. The
positive lead always connects to
the more positive side of the
circuit. An incorrectly connected
polarized capacitor can explode.

Ripple Voltage
As you have seen, the capacitor quickly charges at the beginning of a
cycle and slowly discharges through RL after the positive peak of the input voltage (when
the diode is reverse-biased). The variation in the capacitor voltage due to the charging and
discharging is called the ripple voltage. Generally, ripple is undesirable; thus, the smaller
the ripple, the better the filtering action, as illustrated in Figure 2–44.

DIODES AND APPLICATIONS
For a given input frequency, the output frequency of a full-wave rectifier is twice that of
a half-wave rectifier, as illustrated in Figure 2–45. This makes a full-wave rectifier easier
to filter because of the shorter time between peaks. When filtered, the full-wave rectified
voltage has a smaller ripple than does a half-wave voltage for the same load resistance and
capacitor values. The capacitor discharges less during the shorter interval between full-
wave pulses, as shown in Figure 2–46.

DIODES AND APPLICATIONS
Surge Current in the Capacitor-Input Filter
Before the switch in Figure 2–49 is
closed, the filter capacitor is uncharged. At the instant the switch is closed, voltage is con-
nected to the bridge and the uncharged capacitor appears as a short, as shown. This pro-
duces an initial surge of current, Isurge, through the two forward-biased diodes D1 and D2.
The worst-case situation occurs when the switch is closed at a peak of the secondary volt-
age and a maximum surge current, Isurge(max), is produced, as illustrated in the figure.
In dc power supplies, a fuse is always placed in the primary circuit of the transformer,
as shown in Figure 2–49. A slow-blow type fuse is generally used because of the surge cur-
rent that initially occurs when power is first turned on. The fuse rating is determined by
calculating the power in the power supply load, which is the output power. Since Pin = Pout
in an ideal transformer, the primary current can be calculated as
The fuse rating should be at least 20% larger than the calculated value of Ipri.
Voltage Regulators
While filters can reduce the ripple from power supplies to a low value, the most effective ap-
proach is a combination of a capacitor-input filter used with a voltage regulator. A voltage
regulator is connected to the output of a filtered rectifier and maintains a constant output volt-
age (or current) despite changes in the input, the load current, or the temperature. The capac-
itor-input filter reduces the input ripple to the regulator to an acceptable level. The combina-
tion of a large capacitor and a voltage regulator helps produce an excellent power supply.
Most regulators are integrated circuits and have three terminals—an input terminal, an
output terminal, and a reference (or adjust) terminal. The input to the regulator is first fil-
tered with a capacitor to reduce the ripple to
The regulator reduces the ripple to a
negligible amount. In addition, most regulators have an internal voltage reference, short-
circuit protection, and thermal shutdown circuitry. They are available in a variety of volt-
ages, including positive and negative outputs, and can be designed for variable outputs
with a minimum of external components. Typically, voltage regulators can furnish a con-
stant output of one or more amps of current with high ripple rejection.
Three-terminal regulators designed for fixed output voltages require only external ca-
pacitors to complete the regulation portion of the power supply, as shown in Figure 2–50.
Filtering is accomplished by a large-value capacitor between the input voltage and ground.
An output capacitor (typically
) is connected from the output to ground to
improve the transient response.

Percent Regulation
The regulation expressed as a percentage is a figure of merit used to specify the performance
of a voltage regulator. It can be in terms of input (line) regulation or load regulation.

The line regulation specifies how much change occurs in the output
voltage for a given change in the input voltage. It is typically defined as a ratio of a change
in output voltage for a corresponding change in the input voltage expressed as a percentage.
Equation 2–14
Load Regulation
The load regulation specifies how much change occurs in the output
voltage over a certain range of load current values, usually from minimum current (no

DIODES AND APPLICATIONS
Biased Limiters
The level to which an ac voltage is limited can be adjusted by adding a
bias voltage, VBIAS, in series with the diode, as shown in Figure 2–55. The voltage at point
A must equal VBIAS + 0.7 V before the diode will become forward-biased and conduct.
Once the diode begins to conduct, the voltage at point A is limited to VBIAS + 0.7 V so that
all input voltage above this level is clipped off.
To limit a voltage to a specified negative level, the diode and bias voltage must be
connected as in Figure 2–56. In this case, the voltage at point A must go below
to forward-bias the diode and initiate limiting action as shown.
-VBIAS - 0.7 V
By turning the diode around, the positive limiter can be modified to limit the output
voltage to the portion of the input voltage waveform above
as shown by
the output waveform in Figure 2–57(a). Similarly, the negative limiter can be modified
to limit the output voltage to the portion of the input voltage waveform below
as shown by the output waveform in part (b).

Voltage-Divider Bias
The bias voltage sources that have been used to illustrate the basic
operation of diode limiters can be replaced by a resistive voltage divider that derives the
desired bias voltage from the dc supply voltage, as shown in Figure 2–60. The bias voltage
is set by the resistor values according to the voltage-divider formula.
A positively biased limiter is shown in Figure 2–60(a), a negatively biased limiter is shown
in part (b), and a variable positive bias circuit using a potentiometer voltage divider is
shown in part (c). The bias resistors must be small compared to R1 so that the forward cur-
rent through the diode will not affect the bias voltage.
A Limiter Application
Many circuits have certain restrictions on the input level to avoid
damaging the circuit. For example, almost all digital circuits should not have an input level
that exceeds the power supply voltage. An input of a few volts more than this could dam-
age the circuit. To prevent the input from exceeding a specific level, you may see a diode
limiter across the input signal path in many digital circuits.

DIODE LIMITERS AND CLAMPERS

Diode Clampers
A clamper adds a dc level to an ac voltage. Clampers are sometimes known as dc restor-
ers. Figure 2–63 shows a diode clamper that inserts a positive dc level in the output wave-
form. The operation of this circuit can be seen by considering the first negative half-cycle
of the input voltage. When the input voltage initially goes negative, the diode is forward-
biased, allowing the capacitor to charge to near the peak of the input
as
shown in Figure 2–63(a). Just after the negative peak, the diode is reverse-biased. This is
because the cathode is held near
by the charge on the capacitor. The capac-
itor can only discharge through the high resistance of RL. So, from the peak of one negative
half-cycle to the next, the capacitor discharges very little. The amount that is discharged, of
course, depends on the value of RL.
Vp(in) - 0.7 V
(Vp(in) - 0.7 V),
If the capacitor discharges during the period of the input wave, clamping action is af-
fected. If the RC time constant is 100 times the period, the clamping action is excellent. An
RC time constant of ten times the period will have a small amount of distortion at the
ground level due to the charging current.
The net effect of the clamping action is that the capacitor retains a charge approxi-
mately equal to the peak value of the input less the diode drop. The capacitor voltage acts
essentially as a battery in series with the input voltage. The dc voltage of the capacitor adds
to the input voltage by superposition, as in Figure 2–63(b).
If the diode is turned around, a negative dc voltage is added to the input voltage to pro-
duce the output voltage as shown in Figure 2–64.

Ideally, a negative dc value equal to the input peak less the diode drop is inserted by

Voltage Doubler
Half-Wave Voltage Doubler
A voltage doubler is a voltage multiplier with a multiplica-
tion factor of two. A half-wave voltage doubler is shown in Figure 2–67. During the positive
half-cycle of the secondary voltage, diode D1 is forward-biased and D2 is reverse-biased.
Capacitor C1 is charged to the peak of the secondary voltage (Vp) less the diode drop with the
polarity shown in part (a). During the negative half-cycle, diode D2 is forward-biased and D1
is reverse-biased, as shown in part (b). Since C1 can’t discharge, the peak voltage on C1 adds
to the secondary voltage to charge C2 to approximately 2Vp. Applying Kirchhoff’s law
around the loop as shown in part (b), the voltage across C2 is
Neglecting the diode drop of D2, VC1 = Vp. Therefore,

Half-wave voltage doubler operation. Vp is the peak secondary voltage.
Under a no-load condition, C2 remains charged to approximately 2Vp. If a load resist-
ance is connected across the output, C2 discharges slightly through the load on the next
positive half-cycle and is again recharged to 2Vp on the following negative half-cycle. The
resulting output is a half-wave, capacitor-filtered voltage. The peak inverse voltage across
each diode is 2Vp. If the diode were reversed, the output voltage across C2 would have the
opposite polarity.
Voltage multipliers use clamping action to increase peak rectified voltages without the
necessity of increasing the transformer’s voltage rating. Multiplication factors of two,
three, and four are common. Voltage multipliers are used in high-voltage, low-current
applications such as cathode-ray tubes (CRTs) and particle accelerators.

DIODES AND APPLICATIONS
Full-Wave Voltage Doubler
A full-wave doubler is shown in Figure 2–68. When the
secondary voltage is positive, D1 is forward-biased and C1 charges to approximately Vp, as
shown in part (a). During the negative half-cycle, D2 is forward-biased and C2 charges to
approximately Vp, as shown in part (b). The output voltage, 2Vp, is taken across the two ca-
pacitors in series.
Voltage Tripler
The addition of another diode-capacitor section to the half-wave voltage doubler creates
a voltage tripler, as shown in Figure 2–69. The operation is as follows: On the positive
half-cycle of the secondary voltage, C1 charges to Vp through D1. During the negative half-
cycle, C2 charges to 2Vp through D2, as described for the doubler. During the next positive
half-cycle, C3 charges to 2Vp through D3. The tripler output is taken across C1 and C3, as
shown in the figure.
Voltage Quadrupler
The addition of still another diode-capacitor section, as shown in Figure 2–70, produces an
output four times the peak secondary voltage. C4 charges to 2Vp through D4 on a negative
half-cycle. The 4Vp output is taken across C2 and C4, as shown. In both the tripler and
quadrupler circuits, the PIV of each diode is 2Vp.

Figure 2–71 shows a typical rectifier diode datasheet. The presentation of information
on datasheets may vary from one manufacturer to another, but they basically all convey the
same information. The mechanical information, such as package dimensions, are not
shown on this particular datasheet but are generally available from the manufacturer.
Notice on this datasheet that there are three categories of data given in table form and four
types of characteristics shown in graphical form.
Data Categories
Absolute Maximum Ratings
The absolute maximum ratings indicate the maximum
values of the several parameters under which the diode can be operated without damage
or degradation. For greatest reliability and longer life, the diode should be operated well
under these maximums. Generally, the maximum ratings are specified for an operating
ambient temperature (TA) of
unless otherwise stated. Ambient temperature is the
temperature of the air surrounding the device. The parameters given in Figure 2–71 are
as follows:
VRRM
The peak reverse voltage that can be applied repetitively across the diode.
Notice that it is 50 V for the 1N4001 and 1000 V for the 1N4007. This rating is the
same as the PIV.
IF(AV)
The maximum average value of a 60 Hz half-wave rectified forward current.
This current parameter is 1.0 A for all of the diode types and is specified for an ambient
temperature of 
IFSM
The maximum peak value of nonrepetitive single half-sine-wave forward surge
current with a duration of 8.3 ms. This current parameter is 30 A for all of the diode
types.

Thermal Characteristics
All devices have a limit on the amount of heat that they can

Average power dissipation is the amount of power that the diode can dissipate
under any condition. A diode should never be operated at maximum power, except for
brief periods, to assure reliability and longer life.
RuJA
Thermal resistance from the diode junction to the surrounding air. This indicates
the ability of the device material to resist the flow of heat and specifies the number of
degrees difference between the junction and the surrounding air for each watt trans-
ferred from the junction to the air.
Electrical Characteristics
The electrical characteristics are specified under certain con-
ditions and are the same for each type of diode. These values are typical and can be more
or less for a given diode. Some datasheets provide a minimum and a maximum value in ad-
dition to a typical value for a parameter.

determine the forward voltage for other values of forward current, you must examine
the forward characteristics graph.

decreases. For example, if the surge is repeated 7 times, the maximum current is 18 A, as
shown in Figure 2–74.

Reverse Characteristics
This graph from the datasheet shows how the reverse current
varies with the reverse voltage for three different junction temperatures. The horizontal
axis is the percentage of maximum reverse voltage, VRRM. For example, at 25°C, a 1N4001
has a reverse current of approximately 0.04 mA at 20% of its maximum VRRM or 10 V. If
the VRRM is increased to 90%, the reverse current increases to approximately 0.11 mA, as
shown in Figure 2–75.

Testing a Diode
A multimeter can be used as a fast and simple way to check a diode out of the circuit. A
good diode will show an extremely high resistance (ideally an open) with reverse bias and
a very low resistance with forward bias. A defective open diode will show an extremely
high resistance (or open) for both forward and reverse bias. A defective shorted or resistive
diode will show zero or a low resistance for both forward and reverse bias. An open diode
is the most common type of failure.
The DMM Diode Test Position
Many digital multimeters (DMMs) have a diode test
function that provides a convenient way to test a diode. A typical DMM, as shown in
Figure 2–76, has a small diode symbol to mark the position of the function switch. When
set to diode test, the meter provides an internal voltage sufficient to forward-bias and
reverse-bias a diode. This internal voltage may vary among different makes of DMM, but
2.5 V to 3.5 V is a typical range of values. The meter provides a voltage reading or other
indication to show the condition of the diode under test.
When the Diode Is Working
In Figure 2–76(a), the red (positive) lead of the meter is
connected to the anode and the black (negative) lead is connected to the cathode to forward-
bias the diode. If the diode is good, you will get a reading of between approximately 0.5 V
and 0.9 V, with 0.7 V being typical for forward bias.
In Figure 2–76(b), the diode is turned around for reverse bias as shown. If the diode is
working properly, you will typically get a reading of “OL”. Some DMMs may display the
internal voltage for a reverse-bias condition.
When the Diode Is Defective
When a diode has failed open, you get an out-of-range
“OL” indication for both the forward-bias and the reverse-bias conditions, as illustrated in
Figure 2–76(c). If a diode is shorted, the meter reads 0 V in both forward- and reverse-bias
tests, as indicated in part (d).
Checking a Diode with the OHMs Function
DMMs that do not have a diode test po-
sition can be used to check a diode by setting the function switch on an OHMs range. For
a forward-bias check of a good diode, you will get a resistance reading that can vary de-
pending on the meter’s internal battery. Many meters do not have sufficient voltage on the
OHMs setting to fully forward-bias a diode and you may get a reading of from several hun-
dred to several thousand ohms. For the reverse-bias check of a good diode, you will get an

out-of-range indication such as “OL” on most DMMs because the reverse resistance is too
high for the meter to measure.
Even though you may not get accurate forward- and reverse-resistance readings on a
DMM, the relative readings indicate that a diode is functioning properly, and that is usually all
you need to know. The out-of-range indication shows that the reverse resistance is extremely
high, as you expect. The reading of a few hundred to a few thousand ohms for forward bias is
relatively small compared to the reverse resistance, indicating that the diode is working prop-
erly. The actual resistance of a forward-biased diode is typically much less than 100
.
Troubleshooting a Power Supply
Troubleshooting is the application of logical thinking combined with a thorough knowl-
edge of circuit or system operation to identify and correct a malfunction. A systematic ap-
proach to troubleshooting consists of three steps: analysis, planning, and measuring.
A defective circuit or system is one with a known good input but with no output or an
incorrect output. For example, in Figure 2–77(a), a properly functioning dc power supply
is represented by a single block with a known input voltage and a correct output voltage. A
defective dc power supply is represented in part (b) as a block with an input voltage and an
incorrect output voltage.
Analysis
The first step in troubleshooting a defective circuit or system is to analyze the
problem, which includes identifying the symptom and eliminating as many causes as pos-
sible. In the case of the power supply example illustrated in Figure 2–77(b), the symptom
is that the output voltage is not a constant regulated dc voltage. This symptom does not tell
you much about what the specific cause may be. In other situations, however, a particular
symptom may point to a given area where a fault is most likely.

When working with low-voltage
power supplies, be careful not to
come in contact with the 120 V
ac line. Severe shock or worse
could result. To verify input
voltage to a rectifier, it is always
better to check at the transformer
secondary instead of trying to
measure the line voltage directly.
If it becomes necessary to
measure the line voltage, use a
multimeter and be careful.

TROUBLESHOOTING
◆
79
The first thing you should do in analyzing the problem is to try to eliminate any obvious
causes. In general, you should start by making sure the power cord is plugged into an ac-
tive outlet and that the fuse is not blown. In the case of a battery-powered system, make
sure the battery is good. Something as simple as this is sometimes the cause of a problem.
However, in this case, there must be power because there is an output voltage.
Beyond the power check, use your senses to detect obvious defects, such as a burned re-
sistor, broken wire, loose connection, or an open fuse. Since some failures are temperature
dependent, you can sometimes find an overheated component by touch. However, be very
cautious in a live circuit to avoid possible burn or shock. For intermittent failures, the cir-
cuit may work properly for awhile and then fail due to heat buildup. As a rule, you should
always do a sensory check as part of the analysis phase before proceeding.
Planning
In this phase, you must consider how you will attack the problem. There are
three possible approaches to troubleshooting most circuits or systems.
1. Start at the input (the transformer secondary in the case of a dc power supply)
where there is a known input voltage and work toward the output until you get an
incorrect measurement. When you find no voltage or an incorrect voltage, you have
narrowed the problem to the part of the circuit between the last test point where the
voltage was good and the present test point. In all troubleshooting approaches, you
must know what the voltage is supposed to be at each point in order to recognize an
incorrect measurement when you see it.
2. Start at the output of a circuit and work toward the input. Check for voltage at each
test point until you get a correct measurement. At this point, you have isolated the
problem to the part of the circuit between the last test point and the current test
point where the voltage is correct.
3. Use the half-splitting method and start in the middle of the circuit. If this measure-
ment shows a correct voltage, you know that the circuit is working properly from
the input to that test point. This means that the fault is between the current test
point and the output point, so begin tracing the voltage from that point toward the
output. If the measurement in the middle of the circuit shows no voltage or an in-
correct voltage, you know that the fault is between the input and that test point.
Therefore, begin tracing the voltage from the test point toward the input.
For illustration, let’s say that you decide to apply the half-splitting method using an
oscilloscope.
Measurement
The half-splitting method is illustrated in Figure 2–78 with the measure-
ments indicating a particular fault (open filter capacitor in this case). At test point 2 (TP2)
you observe a full-wave rectified voltage that indicates that the transformer and rectifier

are working properly. This measurement also indicates that the filter capacitor is open,
which is verified by the full-wave voltage at TP3. If the filter were working properly, you
would measure a dc voltage at both TP2 and TP3. If the filter capacitor were shorted, you
would observe no voltage at all of the test points because the fuse would most likely be
blown. A short anywhere in the system is very difficult to isolate because, if the system is
properly fused, the fuse will blow immediately when a short to ground develops.
For the case illustrated in Figure 2–78, the half-splitting method took two measure-
ments to isolate the fault to the open filter capacitor. If you had started from the trans-
former output, it would have taken three measurements; and if you had started at the final
output, it would have also taken three measurements, as illustrated in Figure 2–79.

Fault Analysis
In some cases, after isolating a fault to a particular circuit, it may be necessary to isolate
the problem to a single component in the circuit. In this event, you have to apply logical
thinking and your knowledge of the symptoms caused by certain component failures.
Some typical component failures and the symptoms they produce are now discussed.
Effect of an Open Diode in a Half-Wave Rectifier
A half-wave filtered rectifier with
an open diode is shown in Figure 2–80. The resulting symptom is zero output voltage as
indicated. This is obvious because the open diode breaks the current path from the trans-
former secondary winding to the filter and load resistor and there is no load current.
Other faults that will cause the same symptom in this circuit are an open transformer
winding, an open fuse, or no input voltage.
Effect of an Open Diode in a Full-Wave Rectifier
A full-wave center-tapped filtered
rectifier is shown in Figure 2–81. If either of the two diodes is open, the output voltage will
have twice the normal ripple voltage at 60 Hz rather than at 120 Hz, as indicated.

82
◆
DIODES AND APPLICATIONS
Another fault that will cause the same symptom is an open in the transformer secondary
winding.
The reason for the increased ripple at 60 Hz rather than at 120 Hz is as follows. If
one of the diodes in Figure 2–81 is open, there is current through RL only during one
half-cycle of the input voltage. During the other half-cycle of the input, the open path
caused by the open diode prevents current through RL. The result is half-wave rectifica-
tion, as shown in Figure 2–81, which produces the larger ripple voltage with a fre-
quency of 60 Hz.
An open diode in a full-wave bridge rectifier will produce the same symptom as in the
center-tapped circuit, as shown in Figure 2–82. The open diode prevents current through
RL during half of the input voltage cycle. The result is half-wave rectification, which pro-
duces double the ripple voltage at 60 Hz.
Effects of a Faulty Filter Capacitor
Three types of defects of a filter capacitor are illus-
trated in Figure 2–83.
◆Open
If the filter capacitor for a full-wave rectifier opens, the output is a full-wave
rectified voltage.
◆Shorted
If the filter capacitor shorts, the output is 0 V. A shorted capacitor should
cause the fuse to blow open. If not properly fused, a shorted capacitor may cause
some or all of the diodes in the rectifier to burn open due to excessive current. In any
event, the output is 0 V.
◆Leaky
A leaky filter capacitor is equivalent to a capacitor with a parallel leakage
resistance. The effect of the leakage resistance is to reduce the time constant and
allow the capacitor to discharge more rapidly than normal. This results in an increase
in the ripple voltage on the output. This fault is rare.
Effects of a Faulty Transformer
An open primary or secondary winding of a power
supply transformer results in an output of 0 V, as mentioned before.

likely, the problem is in the transformer or in the rectifier, but there may be a
short from the filter input to ground.
Step 2: The voltage at test point 1 (TP1) is correct, indicating that the transformer
is working. So, the problem must be in the rectifier or a shorted filter
input.
Step 3: With the power turned off, use a DMM to check for a short from the filter
input to ground. Assume that the DMM indicates no short. The fault is now
isolated to the rectifier.
Step 4: Apply fault analysis to the rectifier circuit. Determine the component failure
in the rectifier that will produce a 0 V input. If only one of the diodes in the
rectifier is open, there should be a half-wave rectified output voltage, so this is
not the problem. In order to have a 0 V output, there must be an open in the
rectifier circuit.
Step 5: With the power off, use the DMM in the diode test mode to check each diode.
Replace the defective diodes, turn the power on, and check for proper opera-
tion. Assume this corrects the problem.

Application Activity: DC Power Supply
Assume that you are working for a company that designs, tests, manufactures, and mar-
kets various electronic instruments including dc power supplies. Your first assignment is
to develop and test a basic unregulated power supply using the knowledge that you have
acquired so far. Later modifications will include the addition of a regulator. The power
supply must meet or exceed the following specifications:
◆Input voltage: 120 V rms @60 Hz
◆Output voltage:
◆Ripple factor (max): 3.00%
◆Load current (max): 250 mA
Design of the Power Supply
The Rectifier Circuit
A full-wave rectifier has less ripple for a given filter capacitor
than a half-wave rectifier. A full-wave bridge rectifier is probably the best choice
because it provides the most output voltage for a given input voltage and the PIV is less
than for a center-tapped rectifier. Also, the full-wave bridge does not require a center-
tapped transformer.
1. Compare Equations 2–7 and 2–9 for output voltages.
2. Compare Equations 2–8 and 2–10 for PIV.
The full-wave bridge rectifier circuit is shown in Figure 2–85.

DIODES AND APPLICATIONS
Because the rectifier in the single IC package exceeds the specifications and requires
less wiring on a board, takes up less space, and requires stocking and handling of only
one component versus four, it is the best choice. Another factor to consider is the cost.
Requirements for the diodes in the bridge are
◆Forward current rating must be equal or greater than 250 mA (maximum load
current).
◆PIV must be greater than the minimum calculated value of 16.7 V
By reviewing manufacturer’s datasheets on-line, a specific device can be chosen. Figure
2–87 shows a partial datasheet for the rectifier to be used for this power supply. Notice that
it exceeds the specified requirements. Four possible websites for rectifiers and diodes are

supply circuit with a load connected and scope displays of the output voltage with and
without the filter capacitor connected. The filter capacitor value of 
F is the next
highest standard value closest to the minimum calculated value required. A load resistor
value was chosen to draw a current equal to or greater than the specified maximum load

The closest standard value is 
which draws 258 mA at 16 V and which meets and
exceeds the load current specification.
8. Determine the power rating for the load resistor.
To produce a dc output of 16 V, a peak secondary voltage of 16 V
1.4 V
17.4 V is
required. The rms secondary voltage must be
A standard transformer rms output voltage is 12.6 V. The transformer specification
required by Multisim is
120 V:12.6 V
9.52:1
The dc voltmeter in Figure 2–89(a) indicates an output voltage of 16.209 V, which is
well within the
requirement. In part (c), the scope is AC coupled and set
at 100 mV/division. You can see that the peak-to-peak ripple voltage is less than 300 mV,
which is less than 480 mV, corresponding to the specified maximum ripple factor
of 3%.
Build and simulate the circuit using your Multisim software. Observe the operation
with the virtual oscilloscope and voltmeter.
Prototyping and Testing
Now that all the components have been selected, the prototype circuit is constructed and
tested. After the circuit is successfully tested, it is ready to be finalized on a printed
circuit board.
To build and test a similar circuit, go to Experiment 2 in your lab manual
(Laboratory Exercises for Electronic Devices by David Buchla and Steven
Wetterling).
The Printed Circuit Board
The circuit board is shown in Figure 2–90. There are additional traces and connection
points on the board for expansion to a regulated power supply, which will be done in
Chapter 3. The circuit board is connected to the ac voltage and to a power load resistor
via a cable. The power switch shown in the original schematic will be on the PC board
housing and is not shown for the test setup. A DMM measurement of the output voltage
indicates a correct value. Oscilloscope measurement of the ripple shows that it is within
specifications.

SUMMARY
Section 2–1
◆There is current through a diode only when it is forward-biased. Ideally, there is no current
when there is no bias nor when there is reverse bias. Actually, there is a very small current
in reverse bias due to the thermally generated minority carriers, but this can usually be
neglected.
◆Avalanche occurs in a reverse-biased diode if the bias voltage equals or exceeds the breakdown
voltage.
◆A diode conducts current when forward-biased and blocks current when reversed-biased.
◆Reverse breakdown voltage for a diode is typically greater than 50 V.
Section 2–2
◆The V-I characteristic curve shows the diode current as a function of voltage across the diode.
◆The resistance of a forward-biased diode is called the dynamic or ac resistance.
◆Reverse current increases rapidly at the reverse breakdown voltage.
◆Reverse breakdown should be avoided in most diodes.

of the input
cycle.

◆PIV (peak inverse voltage) is the maximum voltage appearing across the diode in reverse bias.
Section 2–5
◆Each diode in a full-wave rectifier is forward-biased and conducts for 
of the input cycle.
◆The output frequency of a full-wave rectifier is twice the input frequency.
◆The two basic types of full-wave rectifier are center-tapped and bridge.
◆The peak output voltage of a center-tapped full-wave rectifier is approximately one-half of the
total peak secondary voltage less one diode drop.
◆The PIV for each diode in a center-tapped full-wave rectifier is twice the peak output voltage
plus one diode drop.
◆The peak output voltage of a bridge rectifier equals the total peak secondary voltage less two
diode drops.
◆The PIV for each diode in a bridge rectifier is approximately half that required for an equivalent
center-tapped configuration and is equal to the peak output voltage plus one diode drop.

DIODES AND APPLICATIONS
In GreenTech Application 1, the photovoltaic cell and a basic solar power system were
introduced. The block diagram is shown again in Figure GA2–1. You learned that the
basic components of a solar-powered system were the solar panel, the charge controller,
the batteries, and the inverter. Now we will continue the solar power coverage by focus-
ing on the charge controller and batteries.
GreenTech Application 2: Solar Power
The Batteries
Deep-cycle (deep discharge) sealed lead-acid batteries are the most common batteries in
solar power systems because their initial cost is lower and they are readily available.
Unlike automobile batteries, which are shallow-cycle, deep-cycle batteries can be repeat-
edly discharged by as much as 80 percent of their capacity, although they will have a
longer life if the cycles are shallower.
Deep-cycle batteries are required in solar power systems simply because the sunlight is
not at its maximum all of the time—it is an intermittent energy source. When the light
intensity from the sun decreases because of clouds or goes away entirely at night, the out-
put from a solar panel drops drastically or goes to zero. During the periods of low light or
no light, the batteries will discharge significantly when a load is connected. Typically, the
voltage output of a solar panel must be at least 13.6 V to charge a 12 V battery. Solar pan-
els are usually rated at voltages higher than the nominal output. For example, most 12 V
solar panels produce 16 V to 20 V at optimal light conditions. The higher voltage outputs
are necessary so that the solar panel will still produce a sufficient charging voltage during
some nonoptimal conditions.
Battery Connections
Batteries can be connected in series to increase the output voltage
and in parallel to increase the ampere-hour capacity, as illustrated in Figure GA2–2 for any
number of batteries. Several series connections of batteries can be connected in parallel to
achieve both an increase in amp-hrs and output voltage. For example, assume a system uses
12 V, 200 Ah batteries. If the system requires 12 V and 600 Ah, three parallel-connected
batteries are used. If the system requires 24 V and 200 Ah, two series-connected batteries are
used. If 24 V and 600 Ah are needed, three pairs of series batteries are connected in parallel.

The Charge Controller
A solar charge controller is needed in solar power systems that use batteries to store the
energy, with the exception of very low-power systems. The solar charge controller regu-
lates the power from the solar panels primarily to prevent overcharging the batteries.
Overcharging batteries reduce battery life and may damage the batteries.
Generally, there is no need for a charge controller with trickle-charge solar panels, such as
those that produce five watts or less. A good rule-of-thumb is that if the solar panel produces
about two watts or less for each 50 battery amp-hrs (Ah), then you don’t need one. A
charge controller is required if the solar panel produces more than two watts for each 50 Ah
of battery rating. For example, a 12 V battery rated at 120 Ah will not require a charge
controller, as the following calculation shows, because the solar power is less than 5 W.
In this case, the charging circuit is shown in Figure GA2–3. The diode prevents the bat-
tery from discharging back through the solar panel when the panel voltage drops below
the battery voltage. For example, when the solar panel is producing 16 V, the diode is
forward-biased and the battery is charging. When the battery voltage is 12 V and the
panel output drops to less than 12.7 V, the diode is reverse-biased and the battery cannot
discharge back through the solar cells.

 FIGURE GA2–3
Simple trickle charging in a small
solar system (less than 5 W).
For solar systems of more than about 5 W, a charge controller is necessary. Basically,
charge controllers regulate the 16–20 V output of the typical 12 V solar panel down to
what the battery needs depending on the amount of battery charge, the type of battery,
and the temperature. Solar panels produce more voltage at cooler temperatures.
Types of Charge Controllers
Three basic types of charge controllers are on/off, PWM,
and MPPT. The most basic controller is the on/off type, which simply monitors the battery
voltage and stops the charging when the battery voltage reaches a specified level in order to
prevent overcharging. It then restarts the charging once the battery voltage drops below a pre-
determined value. Figure GA2–4 shows the basic concept. The switch shown represents a
transistor that is turned on and off. (You will study transistors beginning in Chapter 4.) The
voltage of the battery is fed back to the control circuit. When the voltage is below a set low
value, the control circuit turns the switch on to charge the battery. When the battery charges
to a set high value, the control circuit turns the switch off. The diode prevents discharge back
through the control circuit when the output of the panel is lower than the battery.

Basic concept of the on/off charge
controller.
PWM (pulse width modulation) charge controllers gradually reduce the amount of power
applied to the batteries as the batteries get closer to full charge. This type of controller
allows the batteries to be more fully charged with less stress on the batteries. This extends

110
◆
DIODES AND APPLICATIONS
the life of the batteries and constantly maintains the batteries in a fully charged state
(called “float”) during sunlight hours. The PWM controller produces a series of pulses to
charge the batteries instead of a constant charge. The battery voltage is constantly moni-
tored to determine how to adjust the frequency of the pulses and the pulse widths. When
the batteries are fully charged and there is no load to drain them, the controller produces
very short pulses at a low rate or no pulses at all. When the batteries are discharged, long
pulses at a high rate are sent or the controller may go into a constant-charging mode, de-
pending on the amount of discharge.
Figure GA2–5 shows the basic concept of a PWM charge controller. In part (a), the PWM
and control circuit produces pulses based on the input from the sampling circuit. The
sampling circuit determines the actual battery voltage by sampling the voltage between
pulses. The diode acts as a rectifier and also blocks discharge of the battery back through
the charger at night. Part (b) demonstrates how the battery charges during each pulse and
how the width and the time between pulses change as the battery charges.

As you have learned, the output voltage of a solar panel varies greatly with the amount of
sunlight and with the air temperature. For this reason, solar panels with voltage ratings
higher than the battery voltage must be used in order to provide sufficient charging volt-
age to the battery under less than optimum conditions. As mentioned earlier, a 12 V solar
panel may produce 20 V under optimum conditions but can produce only a certain
amount of current. For example, if a solar panel can produce 8 A at 20 V, it is rated at
160 W. Batteries like to be charged at a voltage a little higher than their rated voltage. If a
12 V battery is being charged at 14 V, and it is drawing the maximum 8 A from the solar
panel, the power delivered to the battery is 8 A
14 V
112 W instead of the 160 W
produced by the solar panel at 20 V. The batteries only stored 70% of the available energy
because the 12 V battery cannot operate at 20 V.
MPPT (maximum power point tracker) charge controllers eliminate much of the energy
loss found in the other types of controllers and produce much higher efficiencies. The
MPPT continuously tracks the input voltage and current from the solar panel to determine
when the peak input power occurs and then adjusts the voltage to the battery to optimize
the charging. This results in a maximum power transfer from the solar panel to the bat-
tery. In Figure GA2–6, the blue curve is the voltage-current characteristic for a certain
solar panel under a specified condition of incident light. The green curve is the power
showing where the peak occurs, which is in the knee of the V-I curve. If the incident light
decreases, the curves will shift down.

The MPPT is basically a DC-to-DC converter. A simplified block diagram showing the
basic functional concept is shown in Figure GA2–7. Although there are several ways in
which the MPPT can be implemented, the figure illustrates the basic functions. The
DC/AC converter, the transformer, and the AC/DC converter isolate the dc input from the
dc output, so the output can be adjusted for maximum power. For example, if a 160 W
solar panel produces 20 V at 8 A, it needs to be reduced to approximately 13.6 V to
charge a 12 V battery. A normal charger will not be able to provide more than 8 A at
13.6 V (or 109 W), which means the panel is not being used efficiently and only 76% of
the available power from the solar panel is used. An MPPT charge controller can supply
about 11 A at 13.6 V (150 W), thus decreasing the charging time and producing a better
match between the panel and the battery. In this case, the panel is being used more effi-
ciently because it is able to deliver about 94% of the available power to the battery.

INTRODUCTION
Chapter 2 was devoted to general-purpose and rectifier
diodes, which are the most widely used types. In this chapter,
we will cover several other types of diodes that are designed
for specific applications, including the zener, varactor (variable-
capacitance), light-emitting, photo, laser, Schottky, tunnel,
pin, step-recovery, and current regulator diodes.
APPLICATION ACTIVITY PREVIEW
The Application Activity in this chapter is the expansion of
the 16 V power supply developed in Chapter 2 into a 12 V
regulated power supply with an LED power-on indicator. The
new circuit will incorporate a voltage regulator IC, which is
introduced in this chapter.

THE ZENER DIODE
A major application for zener diodes is as a type of voltage regulator for providing
stable reference voltages for use in power supplies, voltmeters, and other instruments.
In this section, you will see how the zener diode maintains a nearly constant dc voltage
under the proper operating conditions. You will learn the conditions and limitations for
properly using the zener diode and the factors that affect its performance.
After completing this section, you should be able to
❏Describe the characteristics of a zener diode and analyze its operation

❏Discuss zener equivalent circuits
❏Define temperature coefficient
◆Analyze zener voltage as a function of temperature
❏Discuss zener power dissipation and derating
◆Apply power derating to a zener diode
❏Interpret zener diode datasheets
The symbol for a zener diode is shown in Figure 3–1. Instead of a straight line repre-
senting the cathode, the zener diode has a bent line that reminds you of the letter Z (for
zener). A zener diode is a silicon pn junction device that is designed for operation in the
reverse-breakdown region. The breakdown voltage of a zener diode is set by carefully con-
trolling the doping level during manufacture. Recall, from the discussion of the diode char-
acteristic curve in Chapter 2, that when a diode reaches reverse breakdown, its voltage
remains almost constant even though the current changes drastically, and this is the key to
zener diode operation. This volt-ampere characteristic is shown again in Figure 3–2 with
the normal operating region for zener diodes shown as a shaded area.
Zener Breakdown
Zener diodes are designed to operate in reverse breakdown. Two types of reverse breakdown
in a zener diode are avalanche and zener. The avalanche effect, discussed in Chapter 2, occurs
in both rectifier and zener diodes at a sufficiently high reverse voltage. Zener breakdown

SPECIAL-PURPOSE DIODES
occurs in a zener diode at low reverse voltages. A zener diode is heavily doped to reduce the
breakdown voltage. This causes a very thin depletion region. As a result, an intense electric
field exists within the depletion region. Near the zener breakdown voltage (VZ), the field is in-
tense enough to pull electrons from their valence bands and create current.
Zener diodes with breakdown voltages of less than approximately 5 V operate predom-
inately in zener breakdown. Those with breakdown voltages greater than approximately
5 V operate predominately in avalanche breakdown. Both types, however, are called
zener diodes. Zeners are commercially available with breakdown voltages from less than
1 V to more than 250 V with specified tolerances from 1% to 20%.
Breakdown Characteristics
Figure 3–3 shows the reverse portion of a zener diode’s characteristic curve. Notice that as
the reverse voltage (VR) is increased, the reverse current (IR) remains extremely small up to
the “knee” of the curve. The reverse current is also called the zener current, IZ. At this
point, the breakdown effect begins; the internal zener resistance, also called zener imped-
ance (ZZ), begins to decrease as the reverse current increases rapidly. From the bottom of
the knee, the zener breakdown voltage (VZ) remains essentially constant although it in-
creases slightly as the zener current, IZ, increases.

Clarence Melvin Zener, an
American physicist, was born in
Indianapolis and earned his PhD
from Harvard in 1930. He was the
first to describe the properties of
reverse breakdown that are
exploited by the zener diode. As a
result, Bell Labs, where the device
was developed, named the diode
after him. He was also involved in
areas of superconductivity,
metallurgy, and geometric
programming.

Zener Regulation
The ability to keep the reverse voltage across its terminals essentially
constant is the key feature of the zener diode. A zener diode operating in breakdown acts
as a voltage regulator because it maintains a nearly constant voltage across its terminals
over a specified range of reverse-current values.
A minimum value of reverse current, IZK, must be maintained in order to keep the diode
in breakdown for voltage regulation. You can see on the curve in Figure 3–3 that when the
reverse current is reduced below the knee of the curve, the voltage decreases drastically
and regulation is lost. Also, there is a maximum current, IZM, above which the diode may
be damaged due to excessive power dissipation. So, basically, the zener diode maintains a
nearly constant voltage across its terminals for values of reverse current ranging from IZK
to IZM. A nominal zener voltage, VZ, is usually specified on a datasheet at a value of reverse
current called the zener test current.
Zener Equivalent Circuits
Figure 3–4 shows the ideal model (first approximation) of a zener diode in reverse break-
down and its ideal characteristic curve. It has a constant voltage drop equal to the nominal
zener voltage. This constant voltage drop across the zener diode produced by reverse
breakdown is represented by a dc voltage symbol even though the zener diode does not
produce a voltage.

Figure 3–5(a) represents the practical model (second approximation) of a zener diode,
where the zener impedance (resistance), ZZ, is included. Since the actual voltage curve is
not ideally vertical, a change in zener current 
produces a small change in zener volt-
age 
as illustrated in Figure 3–5(b). By Ohm’s law, the ratio of 
is the
impedance, as expressed in the following equation:

Equation 3–1
Normally, ZZ is specified at the zener test current. In most cases, you can assume that ZZ is
a small constant over the full range of zener current values and is purely resistive. It is best
to avoid operating a zener diode near the knee of the curve because the impedance changes
dramatically in that area.
ZZ  ¢VZ

For most circuit analysis and troubleshooting work, the ideal model will give very good
results and is much easier to use than more complicated models. When a zener diode is op-
erating normally, it will be in reverse breakdown and you should observe the nominal
breakdown voltage across it. Most schematics will indicate on the drawing what this volt-
age should be.

Temperature Coefficient
The temperature coefficient specifies the percent change in zener voltage for each degree
Celsius change in temperature. For example, a 12 V zener diode with a positive temper-
ature coefficient of 
will exhibit a 1.2 mV increase in VZ when the junction
temperature increases one degree Celsius. The formula for calculating the change in
zener voltage for a given junction temperature change, for a specified temperature
coefficient, is

Zener Power Dissipation and Derating
Zener diodes are specified to operate at a maximum power called the maximum dc power
dissipation, PD(max). For example, the 1N746 zener is rated at a PD(max) of 500 mW and
the 1N3305A is rated at a PD(max) of 50 W. The dc power dissipation is determined by the
formula,
Power Derating
The maximum power dissipation of a zener diode is typically specified
for temperatures at or below a certain value (
for example). Above the specified tem-
perature, the maximum power dissipation is reduced according to a derating factor. The
derating factor is expressed in 
The maximum derated power can be determined
with the following formula:

Zener Diode Datasheet Information
The amount and type of information found on datasheets for zener diodes (or any category
of electronic device) varies from one type of diode to the next. The datasheet for some
zeners contains more information than for others. Figure 3–7 gives an example of the type
of information you have studied that can be found on a typical datasheet. This particular
information is for a zener series, the 1N4728A–1N4764A.

The zener diode can be used as a type of voltage regulator for providing stable reference
voltages. In this section, you will see how zeners can be used as voltage references,
regulators, and as simple limiters or clippers.
After completing this section, you should be able to

Zener Regulation with a Variable Input Voltage
Zener diode regulators can provide a reasonably constant dc level at the output, but they are
not particularly efficient. For this reason, they are limited to applications that require only
low current to the load. Figure 3–9 illustrates how a zener diode can be used to regulate a dc

voltage. As the input voltage varies (within limits), the zener diode maintains a nearly con-
stant output voltage across its terminals. However, as VIN changes, IZ will change propor-
tionally so that the limitations on the input voltage variation are set by the minimum and
maximum current values (IZK and IZM) with which the zener can operate. Resistor R is the
series current-limiting resistor. The meters indicate the relative values and trends.
To illustrate regulation, let’s use the ideal model of the 1N4740A zener diode (ignoring
the zener resistance) in the circuit of Figure 3–10. The absolute lowest current that will
maintain regulation is specified at 
which for the 1N4740A is 0.25 mA and represents
the no-load current. The maximum current is not given on the datasheet but can be calcu-
lated from the power specification of 1 W, which is given on the datasheet. Keep in mind
that both the minimum and maximum values are at the operating extremes and represent
worst-case operation.

This shows that this zener diode can ideally regulate an input voltage from 10.055 V to 32 V

resistor 
is connected, part of the total current is through the zener and part through

SPECIAL-PURPOSE DIODES
You have seen how the zener diode regulates voltage. Its regulating ability is somewhat lim-
ited by the change in zener voltage over a range of current values, which restricts the load cur-
rent that it can handle. To achieve better regulation and provide for greater variations in load
current, the zener diode is combined as a key element with other circuit components to create a
3-terminal linear voltage regulator. Three-terminal voltage regulators that were introduced in
Chapter 2 are IC devices that use the zener to provide a reference voltage for an internal ampli-
fier. For a given dc input voltage, the 3-terminal regulator maintains an essentially constant dc
voltage over a range of input voltages and load currents. The dc output voltage is always less
than the input voltage. The details of this type of regulator are covered in Chapter 17. Figure
3–17 illustrates a basic 3-terminal regulator showing where the zener diode is used.

to limit voltage swings to desired levels. Figure 3–18 shows three basic ways the limiting

of a signal voltage to the selected zener voltage. During the negative alternation, the zener

THE VARACTOR DIODE
The junction capacitance of diodes varies with the amount of reverse bias. Varactor
diodes are specially designed to take advantage of this characteristic and are used as
voltage-controlled capacitors rather than traditional diodes. These devices are com-
monly used in communication systems. Varactor diodes are also referred to as
varicaps or tuning diodes.

A varactor is a diode that always operates in reverse bias and is doped to maximize the
inherent capacitance of the depletion region. The depletion region acts as a capacitor di-
electric because of its nonconductive characteristic. The p and n regions are conductive
and act as the capacitor plates, as illustrated in Figure 3–21.

The reverse-biased varactor diode
acts as a variable capacitor.
Basic Operation
Recall that capacitance is determined by the parameters of plate area (A), dielectric con-
stant ( ), and plate separation (d), as expressed in the following formula:
As the reverse-bias voltage increases, the depletion region widens, effectively increas-
ing the plate separation, thus decreasing the capacitance. When the reverse-bias voltage
decreases, the depletion region narrows, thus increasing the capacitance. This action is
shown in Figure 3–22(a) and (b). A graph of diode capacitance (CT) versus reverse voltage
for a certain varactor is shown in Figure 3–22(c). For this particular device, CT varies from
30 pF to slightly less than 4 pF as VR varies from 1 V to 30 V.
In a varactor diode, these capacitance parameters are controlled by the method of dop-
ing near the pn junction and the size and geometry of the diode’s construction. Nominal
varactor capacitances are typically available from a few picofarads to several hundred
picofarads. Figure 3–23 shows a common symbol for a varactor.

exhibit a capacitance anywhere between 19.8 pF and 24.2 pF. This tolerance range should
not be confused with the range of capacitance values that result from varying the reverse
bias as determined by the capacitance ratio.
Capacitance Ratio
The varactor capacitance ratio is also known as the tuning ratio. It
is the ratio of the diode capacitance at a minimum reverse voltage to the diode capacitance
at a maximum reverse voltage. For the varactor diodes represented in Figure 3–24, the ca-
pacitance ratio is the ratio of C measured at a VR of 2 V divided by C measured at a VR of
20 V. The capacitance ratio is designated as C2>C20 in this case.
For the 832A, the minimum capacitance ratio is 5.0. This means that the capacitance
value decreases by a factor of 5.0 as VR is increased from 2 V to 20 V. The following cal-
culation illustrates how to use the capacitance ratio (CR) to find the capacitance range for
the 832A. If C2
22 pF and the minimum CR
C2>C20
5.0,
The diode capacitance varies from 22 pF to 4.4 pF when VR is increased from 2 V to 20 V.
The Zetex 830 series of varactor diodes are hyper-abrupt junction devices. The doping
in the n and p regions is made uniform so that at the pn junction there is a very abrupt
change from n to p instead of the more gradual change found in the rectifier diodes. The
abruptness of the pn junction determines the capacitance ratio.
Back-to-Back Configuration
One of the drawbacks of using just a single varactor diode
in certain applications, such as rf tuning, is that if the diode is forward-biased by the rf sig-
nal during part of the ac cycle, its reverse leakage will increase momentarily. Also, a type
of distortion called harmonic distortion is produced if the varactor is alternately biased
positively and negatively. To avoid harmonic distortion, you will often see two varactor
diodes back to back, as shown in Figure 3–25(a) with the reverse dc voltage applied to both
devices simultaneously. The two tuning diodes will be driven alternately into high and low
capacitance, and the net capacitance will remain constant and is unaffected by the rf signal
amplitude. The Zetex 832A varactor diode is available in a back-to-back configuration in
an SOT23 package or as a single diode in an SOD523 package, as shown in Figure 3–25(b).
Although the cathodes in the back-to-back configuration are connected to a common pin,
each diode can also be used individually.

An Application
A major application of varactors is in tuning circuits. For example, VHF, UHF, and satel-
lite receivers utilize varactors. Varactors are also used in cellular communications. When
used in a parallel resonant circuit, as illustrated in Figure 3–26, the varactor acts as a

variable capacitor, thus allowing the resonant frequency to be adjusted by a variable volt-
age level. The varactor diode provides the total variable capacitance in the parallel resonant
band-pass filter. The varactor diode and the inductor form a parallel resonant circuit from
the output to ac ground. The capacitors C1 and C2 have no effect on the filter’s frequency
response because their reactances are negligible at the resonant frequencies. C1 prevents a
dc path from the potentiometer wiper back to the ac source through the inductor and R1. C2
prevents a dc path from the wiper of the potentiometer to a load on the output. The poten-
tiometer R2 forms a variable dc voltage for biasing the varactor. The reverse-bias voltage
across the varactor can be varied with the potentiometer.

The Light-Emitting Diode (LED)
The symbol for an LED is shown in Figure 3–28.
The basic operation of the light-emitting diode (LED) is as follows. When the device
is forward-biased, electrons cross the pn junction from the n-type material and recombine
with holes in the p-type material. Recall from Chapter 1 that these free electrons are in
the conduction band and at a higher energy than the holes in the valence band. The difference
in energy between the electrons and the holes corresponds to the energy of visible light.
When recombination takes place, the recombining electrons release energy in the form of
photons. The emitted light tends to be monochromatic (one color) that depends on the
band gap (and other factors). A large exposed surface area on one layer of the semicon-
ductive material permits the photons to be emitted as visible light. This process, called
electroluminescence, is illustrated in Figure 3–29. Various impurities are added during
the doping process to establish the wavelength of the emitted light. The wavelength deter-
mines the color of visible light. Some LEDs emit photons that are not part of the visible
spectrum but have longer wavelengths and are in the infrared (IR) portion of the spectrum.
LED Semiconductor Materials
The semiconductor gallium arsenide (GaAs) was used
in early LEDs and emits IR radiation, which is invisible. The first visible red LEDs were
produced using gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) on a GaAs substrate. The efficiency
was increased using a gallium phosphide (GaP) substrate, resulting in brighter red LEDs
and also allowing orange LEDs.
Later, GaP was used as the light-emitter to achieve pale green light. By using a red and
a green chip, LEDs were able to produce yellow light. The first super-bright red, yellow,
and green LEDs were produced using gallium aluminum arsenide phosphide (GaAlAsP).
By the early 1990s ultrabright LEDs using indium gallium aluminum phosphide
(InGaAlP) were available in red, orange, yellow, and green.

with great promise for various devices, including light-emitting diodes. On the other
hand, the photodiode is a light detector.

SPECIAL-PURPOSE DIODES
Blue LEDs using silicon carbide (SiC) and ultrabright blue LEDs made of gallium ni-
tride (GaN) became available. High intensity LEDs that produce green and blue are also
made using indium gallium nitride (InGaN). High-intensity white LEDs are formed using
ultrabright blue GaN coated with fluorescent phosphors that absorb the blue light and
reemit it as white light.
LED Biasing
The forward voltage across an LED is considerably greater than for a sili-
con diode. Typically, the maximum VF for LEDs is between 1.2 V and 3.2 V, depending on
the material. Reverse breakdown for an LED is much less than for a silicon rectifier diode
(3 V to 10 V is typical).
The LED emits light in response to a sufficient forward current, as shown in Figure 3–30(a).
The amount of power output translated into light is directly proportional to the forward cur-
rent, as indicated in Figure 3–30(b). An increase in IF corresponds proportionally to an
increase in light output. The light output (both intensity and color) is also dependent on tem-
perature. Light intensity goes down with higher temperature as indicated in the figure.

Efficiency is a term used in many
fields to show how well a
particular process works. It is the
ratio of the output to the input
and is a dimensionless number,
often expressed as a percentage.
An efficiency of 100% is the
theoretical maximum that can
never be achieved in real systems.
For lighting, the term efficacy is
used with units of lumens per watt
and is related to the efficiency of
converting input power (in watts)
to light that can be seen by the
human eye (lumens). The
theoretical maximum efficacy is
683 lumens/watt.

Light Emission
An LED emits light over a specified range of wavelengths as indicated
by the spectral output curves in Figure 3–31. The curves in part (a) represent the light out-
put versus wavelength for typical visible LEDs, and the curve in part (b) is for a typical in-
frared LED. The wavelength 
is expressed in nanometers (nm). The normalized output
of the visible red LED peaks at 660 nm, the yellow at 590 nm, green at 540 nm, and blue at
460 nm. The output for the infrared LED peaks at 940 nm.

The graphs in Figure 3–32 show typical radiation patterns for small LEDs. LEDs are
directional light sources (unlike filament or fluorescent bulbs). The radiation pattern is
generally perpendicular to the emitting surface; however, it can be altered by the shape of
the emitter surface and by lenses and diffusion films to favor a specific direction.
Directional patterns can be an advantage for certain applications, such as traffic lights,
where the light is intended to be seen only by certain drivers. Figure 3–32(a) shows the pat-
tern for a forward-directed LED such as used in small panel indicators. Figure 3–32(b)
shows the pattern for a wider viewing angle such as found in many super-bright LEDs. A
wide variety of patterns are available from manufacturers; one variation is to design the
LED to emit nearly all the light to the side in two lobes.

LED Datasheet Information
A partial datasheet for an TSMF1000 infrared (IR) light-emitting diode is shown in Figure
3–34. Notice that the maximum reverse voltage is only 5 V, the maximum forward current
is 100 mA, and the forward voltage drop is approximately 1.3 V for IF
20 mA.
From the graph in part (c), you can see that the peak power output for this device occurs
at a wavelength of 870 nm; its radiation pattern is shown in part (d).
Radiant Intensity and Irradiance
In Figure 3–34(a), the radiant intensity, Ie (symbol
not to be confused with current), is the output power per steradian and is specified as 5 mW/sr
at IF
20 mA. The steradian (sr) is the unit of solid angular measurement. Irradiance, E,
is the power per unit area at a given distance from an LED source expressed in mW/cm2.
Irradiance is important because the response of a detector (photodiode) used in conjunc-
tion with an LED depends on the irradiance of the light it receives.

SPECIAL-PURPOSE DIODES
Applications
Standard LEDs are used for indicator lamps and readout displays on a wide variety of in-
struments, ranging from consumer appliances to scientific apparatus. A common type of
display device using LEDs is the seven-segment display. Combinations of the segments
form the ten decimal digits as illustrated in Figure 3–35. Each segment in the display is an
LED. By forward-biasing selected combinations of segments, any decimal digit and a dec-
imal point can be formed. Two types of LED circuit arrangements are the common anode
and common cathode as shown.
One common application of an infrared LED is in remote control units for TV, DVD, gate
openers, etc. The IR LED sends out a beam of invisible light that is sensed by the receiver in
your TV, for example. For each button on the remote control unit, there is a unique code. When
a specific button is pressed, a coded electrical signal is generated that goes to the LED, which
converts the electrical signal to a coded infrared light signal. The TV receiver recognizes the
code and takes appropriate action, such as changing the channel or increasing the volume.
Also, IR light-emitting diodes are used in optical coupling applications, often in con-
junction with fiber optics. Areas of application include industrial processing and control,
position encoders, bar graph readers, and optical switching.
An example of how an IR LED could be used in an industrial application is illustrated
in Figure 3–36. This particular system is used to count baseballs as they are fed down a
chute into a box for shipping. As each ball passes through the chute, the IR beam emitted
by the LED is interrupted. This is detected by the photodiode (discussed later) and the re-
sulting change in current is sensed by a detector circuit. An electronic circuit counts each
time that the beam is interrupted; and when a preset number of balls pass through the
chute, the “stop” mechanism is activated to stop the flow of balls until the next empty box
is automatically moved into place on the conveyor. When the next box is in place, the
“stop” mechanism is deactivated and the balls begin to roll again. This idea can also be ap-
plied to inventory and packing control for many other types of products.
High-Intensity LEDs
LEDs that produce much greater light outputs than standard LEDs are found in many ap-
plications including traffic lights, automotive lighting, indoor and outdoor advertising and
informational signs, and home lighting.

Traffic Lights
LEDs are quickly replacing the traditional incandescent bulbs in traffic
signal applications. Arrays of tiny LEDs form the red, yellow, and green lights in a traffic
light unit. An LED array has three major advantages over the incandescent bulb: brighter
light, longer lifetime (years vs. months), and less energy consumption (about 90% less).
LED traffic lights are constructed in arrays with lenses that optimize and direct the light
output. Figure 3–37(a) illustrates the concept of a traffic light array using red LEDs. A rel-
atively low density of LEDs is shown for illustration. The actual number and spacing of the
LEDs in a traffic light unit depends on the diameter of the unit, the type of lens, the color,
and the required light intensity. With an appropriate LED density and a lens, an 8- or 12-
inch traffic light will appear essentially as a solid-color circle.
LEDs in an array are usually connected either in a series-parallel or a parallel arrange-
ment. A series connection is not practical because if one LED fails open, then all the
LEDs are disabled. For a parallel connection, each LED requires a limiting resistor. To re-
duce the number of limiting resistors, a series-parallel connection can be used, as shown
in Figure 3–37(b).

SPECIAL-PURPOSE DIODES
Some LED traffic arrays use small reflectors for each LED to help maximize the effect
of the light output. Also, an optical lens covers the front of the array to direct the light from
each individual diode to prevent improper dispersion of light and to optimize the visibility.
Figure 3–38 illustrates how a lens is used to direct the light toward the viewer.
The particular LED circuit configuration depends on the voltage and the color of the
LED. Different color LEDs require different forward voltages to operate. Red LEDs take
the least; and as the color moves up the color spectrum toward blue, the voltage require-
ment increases. Typically, a red LED requires about 2 V, while blue LEDs require between
3 V and 4 V. Generally, LEDs, however, need 20 mA to 30 mA of current, regardless of
their voltage requirements. Typical V-I curves for red, yellow, green, and blue LEDs are
shown in Figure 3–39.
Light seen by viewer is
concentrated in a smaller
area and is more intense
than it would be without

LED Displays
LEDs are widely used in large and small signs and message boards for
both indoor and outdoor uses, including large-screen television. Signs can be single-color,
multicolor, or full-color. Full-color screens use a tiny grouping of high-intensity red, green,
and blue LEDs to form a pixel. A typical screen is made of thousands of RGB pixels with
the exact number determined by the sizes of the screen and the pixel.
Red, green, and blue (RGB) are primary colors and when mixed together in varying
amounts, can be used to produce any color in the visible spectrum. A basic pixel formed by
three LEDs is shown in Figure 3–41. The light emission from each of the three diodes can
be varied independently by varying the amount of forward current. Yellow is added to the
three primary colors (RGBY) in some TV screen applications.
Other Applications
High-intensity LEDs are becoming more widely used in automo-
tive lighting for taillights, brakelights, turn signals, back-up lights, and interior applica-
tions. LED arrays are expected to replace most incandescent bulbs in automotive lighting.
Eventually, headlights may also be replaced by white LED arrays. LEDs can be seen better
in poor weather and can last 100 times longer than an incandescent bulb.
LEDs are also finding their way into interior home and business lighting applications.
Arrays of white LEDs may eventually replace incandescent light bulbs and flourescent
lighting in interior living and work areas. As previously mentioned, most white LEDs use
a blue GaN (gallium nitride) LED covered by a yellowish phosphor coating made of a cer-
tain type of crystals that have been powdered and bound in a type of viscous adhesive.
Since yellow light stimulates the red and green receptors of the eye, the resulting mix of
blue and yellow light gives the appearance of white.

SPECIAL-PURPOSE DIODES
The Organic LED (OLED)
An OLED is a device that consists of two or three layers of materials composed of organic
molecules or polymers that emit light with the application of voltage. OLEDs produce
light through the process of electrophosphorescence. The color of the light depends on the
type of organic molecule in the emissive layer. The basic structure of a 2-layer OLED is
shown in Figure 3–42.

Electrons are provided to the emissive layer and removed from the conductive layer when
there is current between the cathode and anode. This removal of electrons from the con-
ductive layer leaves holes. The electrons from the emissive layer recombine with the holes
from the conductive layer near the junction of the two layers. When this recombination
occurs, energy is released in the form of light that passes through the transparent cathode
material. If the anode and substrate are also made from transparent materials, light is emitted
in both directions, making the OLED useful in applications such as heads-up displays.
OLEDs can be sprayed onto substrates just like inks are sprayed onto paper during
printing. Inkjet technology greatly reduces the cost of OLED manufacturing and allows
OLEDs to be printed onto very large films for large displays like 80-inch TV screens or
electronic billboards.
Quantum Dots
Quantum dots are a form of nanocrystals that are made from semiconductor material such
as silicon, germanium, cadmium sulfide, cadmium selenide, and indium phosphide.
Quantum dots are only 1 nm to 12 nm in diameter (a nm is one billionth of a meter).
Billions of dots could fit on the head of a pin! Because of their small size, quantum effects
arise due to the confinement of electrons and holes; as a result, material properties are very
different than the normal material. One important property is that the band gap is dependent
on the size of the dots. When excited from an external source, dots formed from semicon-
ductors emit light in the visible range as well as infrared and ultraviolet, depending on their
size. The higher-frequency blue light is emitted by smaller dots suspended in solution
(larger band gap); red light is emitted from solutions with larger dots (smaller band gap).
Solutions containing the quantum dots glow eerily with specific colors as shown in the
photograph in Figure 3–43.

OLED technology was developed
by Eastman Kodak. It is beginning
to replace LCD (liquid crystal
display) technology in handheld
devices such as PDAs and cellular
phones. OLEDs are brighter,
thinner, faster, and lighter than
conventional LEDs or LCDs. They
also use less power and are
cheaper to manufacture.
F Y I
Although quantum dots are not diodes themselves, they can be used in construction of
light-emitting diodes as well as display devices and a variety of other applications. As you
know, LEDs work by generating a specific frequency (color) of light, which is determined
by the band gap. To produce white light, blue LEDs are coated with a phosphor that adds
yellow light to the blue, forming white. The result is not a pure white, but tends to be harsh
and makes colors appear unnatural. While this is satisfactory for displays and signs, many

Quantum dots can be used to modify the basic color of LEDs by converting higher energy
photons (blue) to photons of lower energy. The result is a color that more closely approximates

an incandescent bulb. Quantum dot filters can be designed to contain combinations of colors,
giving designers control of the spectrum. The important advantage of quantum dot technology
is that it does not lose the incoming light; it merely absorbs the light and reradiates it at a dif-
ferent frequency. This enables control of color without giving up efficiency. By placing a
quantum dot filter in front of a white LED, the spectrum can be made to look like that of an in-
candescent bulb. The resulting light is more satisfactory for general illumination, while retain-
ing the advantages of LEDs.
There are other promising applications, particularly in medical applications. Water-soluble
quantum dots are used as a biochemical luminescent marker for cellular imaging and med-
ical research. Research is also being done on quantum dots as the basic device units for
information processing by manipulating two energy levels within the quantum dot. 
The Photodiode
The photodiode is a device that operates in reverse bias, as shown in Figure 3–44(a),
where 
is the reverse light current. The photodiode has a small transparent window that
allows light to strike the pn junction. Some typical photodiodes are shown in Figure 3–44(b).
An alternate photodiode symbol is shown in Figure 3–44(c).

Recall that when reverse-biased, a rectifier diode has a very small reverse leakage cur-
rent. The same is true for a photodiode. The reverse-biased current is produced by thermally
generated electron-hole pairs in the depletion region, which are swept across the pn junction
by the electric field created by the reverse voltage. In a rectifier diode, the reverse leakage
current increases with temperature due to an increase in the number of electron-hole pairs.
A photodiode differs from a rectifier diode in that when its pn junction is exposed to
light, the reverse current increases with the light intensity. When there is no incident light,
the reverse current, 
is almost negligible and is called the dark current. An increase
in the amount of light intensity, expressed as irradiance (mW/cm2), produces an increase in
the reverse current, as shown by the graph in Figure 3–45(a).
From the graph in Figure 3–45(b), you can see that the reverse current for this particu-
lar device is approximately 
at a reverse-bias voltage of 10 V with an irradiance of
0.5 mW/cm2. Therefore, the resistance of the device is
At 20 mW/cm2, the current is approximately 
The resistance under
this condition is
These calculations show that the photodiode can be used as a variable-resistance device
controlled by light intensity.

Photodiode Datasheet Information
A partial datasheet for an TEMD1000 photodiode is shown in Figure 3–47. Notice that the
maximum reverse voltage is 60 V and the dark current (reverse current with no light) is
typically 1 nA for a reverse voltage of 10 V. The dark current increases with an increase in
reverse voltage and also with an increase in temperature.
Sensitivity
From the graph in part (b), you can see that the maximum sensitivity for this
device occurs at a wavelength of 950 nm. The angular response graph in part (c) shows an
area of response measured as relative sensitivity. At 
on either side of the maximum ori-
entation, the sensitivity drops to approximately 82% of maximum.

Basic laser diode construction and operation.
The Laser Diode
The term laser stands for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. Laser
light is monochromatic, which means that it consists of a single color and not a mixture of
colors. Laser light is also called coherent light, a single wavelength, as compared to inco-
herent light, which consists of a wide band of wavelengths. The laser diode normally emits
coherent light, whereas the LED emits incoherent light. The symbols are the same as
shown in Figure 3–48(a).
The basic construction of a laser diode is shown in Figure 3–48(b). A pn junction is
formed by two layers of doped gallium arsenide. The length of the pn junction bears a pre-
cise relationship with the wavelength of the light to be emitted. There is a highly reflective
surface at one end of the pn junction and a partially reflective surface at the other end,
forming a resonant cavity for the photons. External leads provide the anode and cathode
connections.
The basic operation is as follows. The laser diode is forward-biased by an external volt-
age source. As electrons move through the junction, recombination occurs just as in an or-
dinary diode. As electrons fall into holes to recombine, photons are released. A released
photon can strike an atom, causing another photon to be released. As the forward current is
increased, more electrons enter the depletion region and cause more photons to be emitted.
Eventually some of the photons that are randomly drifting within the depletion region
strike the reflected surfaces perpendicularly. These reflected photons move along the de-
pletion region, striking atoms and releasing additional photons due to the avalanche effect.
This back-and-forth movement of photons increases as the generation of photons “snow-
balls” until a very intense beam of laser light is formed by the photons that pass through
the partially reflective end of the pn junction.
Each photon produced in this process is identical to the other photons in energy level,
phase relationship, and frequency. So a single wavelength of intense light emerges from
the laser diode, as indicated in Figure 3–48(c). Laser diodes have a threshold level of cur-
rent above which the laser action occurs and below which the diode behaves essentially as
an LED, emitting incoherent light.
An Application
Laser diodes and photodiodes are used in the pick-up system of com-
pact disk (CD) players. Audio information (sound) is digitally recorded in stereo on the
surface of a compact disk in the form of microscopic “pits” and “flats.” A lens arrangement
focuses the laser beam from the diode onto the CD surface. As the CD rotates, the lens and
beam follow the track under control of a servomotor. The laser light, which is altered by

the pits and flats along the recorded track, is reflected back from the track through a lens
and optical system to infrared photodiodes. The signal from the photodiodes is then used to
reproduce the digitally recorded sound. Laser diodes are also used in laser printers and
fiber-optic systems.
The Schottky Diode
Schottky diodes are high-current diodes used primarily in high-frequency and fast-switching
applications. They are also known as hot-carrier diodes. The term hot-carrier is derived
from the higher energy level of electrons in the n region compared to those in the metal re-
gion. A Schottky diode symbol is shown in Figure 3–49. A Schottky diode is formed by
joining a doped semiconductor region (usually n-type) with a metal such as gold, silver, or
platinum. Rather than a pn junction, there is a metal-to-semiconductor junction, as shown
in Figure 3–50. The forward voltage drop is typically around 0.3 V because there is no de-
pletion region as in a pn junction diode.
The Schottky diode operates only with majority carriers. There are no minority carri-
ers and thus no reverse leakage current as in other types of diodes. The metal region is
heavily occupied with conduction-band electrons, and the n-type semiconductor region
is lightly doped. When forward-biased, the higher energy electrons in the n region are in-
jected into the metal region where they give up their excess energy very rapidly. Since
there are no minority carriers, as in a conventional rectifier diode, there is a very rapid
response to a change in bias. The Schottky is a fast-switching diode, and most of its ap-
plications make use of this property. It can be used in high-frequency applications and in
many digital circuits to decrease switching times. The LS family of TTL logic (LS
stands for low-power Schottky) is one type of digital integrated circuit that uses the
Schottky diode.
The PIN Diode
The pin diode consists of heavily doped p and n regions separated by an intrinsic (i) region,
as shown in Figure 3–51(a). When reverse-biased, the pin diode acts like a nearly constant
capacitance. When forward-biased, it acts like a current-controlled variable resistance.
This is shown in Figure 3–51(b) and (c). The low forward resistance of the intrinsic region
decreases with increasing current.

Thin-film PV solar panels, a
relatively new development, use a
somewhat different concept for
the diodes than a standard
crystalline silicon panel uses. The
thin films are based on amorphous
silicon, rather than crystalline
silicon, as standard PV panels are.
The p and n layers are separated by
an intrinsic layer forming a p-i-n
diode. Because they are very thin,
light can penetrate the entire layer
and multiple layers can be added
with different band gaps to capture
a larger percentage of the light
spectrum. This is a promising
method for forming large flexible
panels.

SPECIAL-PURPOSE DIODES
The forward series resistance characteristic and the reverse capacitance characteristic
are shown graphically in Figure 3–52 for a typical pin diode.
The pin diode is used as a dc-controlled microwave switch operated by rapid changes in
bias or as a modulating device that takes advantage of the variable forward-resistance char-
acteristic. Since no rectification occurs at the pn junction, a high-frequency signal can be
modulated (varied) by a lower-frequency bias variation. A pin diode can also be used in at-
tenuator applications because its resistance can be controlled by the amount of current.
Certain types of pin diodes are used as photodetectors in fiber-optic systems.

PIN diode characteristics.
 FIGURE 3–53
Tunnel diode symbols.
The Step-Recovery Diode
The step-recovery diode uses graded doping where the doping level of the semiconductive
materials is reduced as the pn junction is approached. This produces an abrupt turn-off time
by allowing a fast release of stored charge when switching from forward to reverse bias. It
also allows a rapid re-establishment of forward current when switching from reverse to for-
ward bias. This diode is used in very high frequency (VHF) and fast-switching applications.
The Tunnel Diode
The tunnel diode exhibits a special characteristic known as negative resistance. This fea-
ture makes it useful in oscillator and microwave amplifier applications. Two alternate sym-
bols are shown in Figure 3–53. Tunnel diodes are constructed with germanium or gallium
arsenide by doping the p and n regions much more heavily than in a conventional rectifier
diode. This heavy doping results in an extremely narrow depletion region. The heavy dop-
ing allows conduction for all reverse voltages so that there is no breakdown effect as with
the conventional rectifier diode. This is shown in Figure 3–54.
Also, the extremely narrow depletion region permits electrons to “tunnel” through the
pn junction at very low forward-bias voltages, and the diode acts as a conductor. This is
shown in Figure 3–54 between points A and B. At point B, the forward voltage begins to
develop a barrier, and the current begins to decrease as the forward voltage continues to in-
crease. This is the negative-resistance region.
This effect is opposite to that described in Ohm’s law, where an increase in voltage results
in an increase in current. At point C, the diode begins to act as a conventional forward-
biased diode.

Leo Esaki won the Nobel Prize in
physics in 1973 for the invention
of the tunnel diode in the late
1950s. Surprisingly, in 1976 Robert
Noyce, cofounder of Intel Corp.,
revealed in a talk before the MIT
Club of New York that he had in
his notebooks from 1956 a
complete description of the tunnel
diode. However, credit for the
invention is given to Esaki and the

An Application
A parallel resonant circuit can be represented by a capacitance, induc-
tance, and resistance in parallel, as in Figure 3–55(a). RP is the parallel equivalent of the
series winding resistance of the coil. When the tank circuit is “shocked” into oscillation by
an application of voltage as in Figure 3–55(b), a damped sinusoidal output results. The
damping is due to the resistance of the tank, which prevents a sustained oscillation because
energy is lost when there is current through the resistance.

diode is 15 V. In part (b), a potentiometer is connected to provide a variable load resistance.
It is adjusted to a minimum value for a full-load test as determined by the following calcu-
lations. The full-load test is at minimum zener current (IZK). The meter reading of 14.8 V
indicates approximately the expected output voltage of 15.0 V.
Case 1: Zener Diode Open
If the zener diode fails open, the power supply test gives the
approximate results indicated in Figure 3–60. In the no-load check shown in part (a),
the output voltage is 24 V because there is no voltage dropped between the filtered out-
put of the power supply and the output terminal. This definitely indicates an open
between the output terminal and ground. In the full-load check, the voltage of 14.8 V
results from the voltage-divider action of the 
series resistor and the 
load.
In this case, the result is too close to the normal reading to be a reliable fault indication
but the no-load check will verify the problem. Also, if RL is varied, VOUT will vary if
the zener diode is open.

Case 2: Incorrect Zener Voltage
As indicated in Figure 3–61, a no-load check that results
in an output voltage greater than the maximum zener voltage but less than the power sup-
ply output voltage indicates that the zener has failed such that its internal impedance is
more than it should be. The 20 V output in this case is 4.5 V higher than the expected value
of 15.5 V. That additional voltage indicates the zener is faulty or the wrong type has been
installed. A 0 V output, of course, indicates that there is a short.

CHECKUP
Application Activity: Regulated DC Power Supply
The unregulated 16 V dc power supply developed in Chapter 2 is to be upgraded to a reg-
ulated power supply with a fixed output voltage of 12 V. An integrated circuit 3–terminal
voltage regulator is to be used and a red LED incorporated to indicate when the power is
on. The printed circuit board for the unregulated power supply was designed to accom-
modate these additions.
The Circuit
Practical considerations for the circuit are the type of regulator, the selection of the LED
power-on indicator and limiting resistor, and the value and placement of the fuse.

SPECIAL-PURPOSE DIODES
The Regulator
The 78XX series of linear voltage regulators provide positive fixed out-
put voltages for a range of values. The last two digits in the part number indicate the out-
put voltage. The 7812 provides a 12 V regulated output. The change in output voltage for a
specified change in input voltage is called the line regulation. The change in output voltage
for a specified change in load current is called the load regulation. These parameters are
specified on the datasheet. It is recommended by the manufacturer that a 
capacitor
be connected from the input terminal to ground and a 
connected from the output
terminal to ground, as shown in Figure 3–62 to prevent high-frequency oscillations and
improve the performance. You may wonder about putting a small-value capacitor in
parallel with a large one; the reason is that the large filter capacitor has an internal equiva-
lent series resistance, which affects the high frequency response of the system. The effect
is cancelled with the small capacitor.

12 V regulated power supply.
A partial datasheet for a 7812 is shown in Figure 3–63(a) Notice that there is a range
of nominal output voltages, but it is typically 12 V. The line and load regulation specify
how much the output can vary about the nominal output value. For example, the typical
12 V output will change no more than 11 mV (typical) as the load current changes from
5 mA to 1. 5 A. Package configurations are shown in part (b).
1. From the datasheet, determine the maximum output voltage if the input voltage to
the regulator increases to 22 V, assuming a nominal output of 12 V.
2. From the datasheet, determine how much the typical output voltage changes when
the load current changes from 250 mA to 750 mA.
The LED
A typical partial datasheet for a visible red LED is shown in Figure 3–64. As
the datasheet shows, a forward current of 10 mA to 20 mA is used for the test data.
3. Determine the value of the resistor shown in Figure 3–62 for limiting the LED
current to 20 mA and use the next higher standard value. Also specify the power
rating of the limiting resistor.
The Fuse
The fuse will be in series with the primary winding of the transformer, as
shown in Figure 3–62. The fuse should be calculated based on the maximum allowable
primary current. Recall from your dc/ac circuits course that if the voltage is stepped

down, the current is stepped up. From the specifications for the unregulated power supply,
the maximum load current is 250 mA. The current required for the power-on LED
indicator is 15 mA. So, the total secondary current is 265 mA. The primary current will
be the secondary current divided by the turns ratio.
4. Calculate the primary current and use this value to select a fuse rating.

Simulation of the regulated 12 V power supply circuit.
Simulation
In the development of a new circuit, it is helpful to simulate the circuit using a software
program before actually building it and committing it to hardware. We will use Multisim
to simulate this power supply circuit. Figure 3–65 shows the simulated regulated power
supply circuit. The unregulated power supply was previously tested, so you need only to
verify that the regulated output is correct. A load resistor value is chosen to draw a cur-
rent equal to or greater than the specified maximum load current.
The closest standard value is 
which draws 255 mA at 12 V.
5. Determine the power rating for the load resistor.
Simulate the circuit using your Multisim software. Verify the operation with the virtual
voltmeter.
Prototyping and Testing
Now that all the components have been selected and the circuit has been simulated, the
new components are added to the power supply protoboard from Experiment 2 and the
circuit is tested.
To build and test a similar circuit, go to Experiment 3 in your lab manual (Laboratory
Exercises for Electronic Devices by David Buchla and Steven Wetterling).
Printed Circuit Board
The 12 V regulated power supply prototype has been built and tested. It is now commit-
ted to a printed circuit layout, as shown in Figure 3–66. Notice that a heat sink is used
with the regulator IC to increase its ability to dissipate power. With the ac line voltage
and load resistor connected, the output voltage is measured.
6. Compare the printed circuit board to the schematic in Figure 3–65.
7. Calculate the power dissipated by the regulator for an output of 12 V.

SPECIAL-PURPOSE DIODES
The Inverter
The inverter is a dc-to-ac converter that takes the output of the batteries in a
solar power system and converts it to a standard 120 V, 60 Hz output voltage. This is the same
as the voltage provided by the electric utilities companies. Some inverters can produce 240 V.
Basically, an inverter switches the dc output of the storage battery on and off and
processes the result to create a pure sine wave, a stepped wave called a modified or quasi
sine wave (sometimes called a modified square wave), or a square wave. Most inverters
produce a pure sine wave, which is the type that the power company generates. Other out-
puts are found in cheaper inverters and are limited to providing power at lower efficien-
cies to only certain types of loads. The square wave inverter is seldom used, although it
can be used as the basis for generating a pure sine wave. These three types of inverter out-
puts are shown in Figure GA3–2.
Recall from your dc/ac course that the harmonic content of a square wave includes a fun-
damental sine wave at the frequency of the square wave and a series of odd harmonics.
One method of implementing a relatively pure sine wave inverter uses a dc to square
wave inverter. The square wave is processed through a filter system to eliminate all of the
odd harmonics, leaving only the fundamental sine wave, as illustrated in Figure GA3–3.
A step-up transformer is used to produce the required 120 V, 60 Hz sine wave.

A switching circuit can be used in the conversion of dc voltage to an ac square wave volt-
age. One method is illustrated in Figure GA3–4 where switch symbols are used to repre-
sent switching transistors such as CMOS, which is discussed in Chapter 9. In part (a),
switches S2 and S3 are on for a specified time and S1 and S4 are off. The direct current
is through the load as shown creating a positive output voltage, as indicated. In part (b),
opposite switches are on and off. The current is in the opposite direction through the load
and the output voltage is negative. The complete on/off cycle of the switches produces an
alternating square wave. The transistors are switched by a timing control circuit which is
not shown for simplicity. The load is the filter in the pure sine wave inverter.

Inverters can have two types of interface: stand-alone and grid-tie. The stand-alone in-
verter is used in applications where all of the output power is used for a specified load,
such as lighting, appliances, and motors, and is independent of the electrical power grid.
Figure GA3–1 represents a stand-alone system. The grid-tie inverter is used in applica-
tions where all or part of the output power is provided to the electrical gird. For example,
a home solar power system may share excess power not used in the home with the power
company for credit if net metering is available. Some power companies have a net meter-
ing policy in which a special meter is installed and all power going to the electrical grid is
deducted from power used by the on-site consumer. A large solar power system may be
entirely devoted to producing power for the electrical gird.
The Grid-Tie System
A grid-tie inverter (GTI) must synchronize its ac output frequency
(60 Hz) and phase with that of the grid, limit its amplitude for compatibility with the grid,
and adjust its power factor to unity (voltage and current in phase). For safety reasons,
grid-tie inverters have to disconnect from the grid if the grid goes down in a blackout. An
option with grid-tie systems is that the solar panel can connect directly to the inverter
with no battery backup. However, batteries allow the consumer to have energy available
when they lose power from the grid. Figure GA3–5 shows the basic concept of a grid-tie
solar power system with backup batteries.
During normal operation, the grid is supplying electrical power to the user and the power
from the grid-tie inverter is fed back into the gird through the distribution and control
circuits for credit from the power company. If the grid goes down, the ac disconnect pre-
vents the power from the grid-tie inverter from feeding into the solar power is then
switched directly to the user.

INTRODUCTION
The invention of the transistor was the beginning of a tech-
nological revolution that is still continuing. All of the com-
plex electronic devices and systems today are an outgrowth
of early developments in semiconductor transistors.
Two basic types of transistors are the bipolar junction
transistor (BJT), which we will begin to study in this chapter,
and the field-effect transistor (FET), which we will cover in
later chapters. The BJT is used in two broad areas—as a
linear amplifier to boost or amplify an electrical signal and
as an electronic switch. Both of these applications are
introduced in this chapter.
APPLICATION ACTIVITY PREVIEW
Suppose you work for a company that makes a security
alarm system for protecting homes and businesses against
illegal entry. You are given the responsibility for final devel-
opment and for testing each system before it is shipped out.
The first step is to learn all you can about transistor opera-
tion. You will then apply your knowledge to the Application
Activity at the end of the chapter.

BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTORS
The BJT is constructed with three doped semiconductor regions separated by two pn
junctions, as shown in the epitaxial planar structure in Figure 4–1(a). The three regions
are called emitter, base, and collector. Physical representations of the two types of
BJTs are shown in Figure 4–1(b) and (c). One type consists of two n regions separated by
a p region (npn), and the other type consists of two p regions separated by an n region
(pnp). The term bipolar refers to the use of both holes and electrons as current carriers in
the transistor structure.

BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTOR (BJT) STRUCTURE
The basic structure of the bipolar junction transistor (BJT) determines its operating char-
acteristics. In this section, you will see how semiconductive materials are used to form a
BJT, and you will learn the standard BJT symbols.
After completing this section, you should be able to
❏Describe the basic structure of the BJT
◆Explain the difference between the structure of an npn and a pnp transistor
◆Identify the symbols for npn and pnp transistors
◆Name the three regions of a
BJT and their labels
The pn junction joining the base region and the emitter region is called the base-emitter
junction. The pn junction joining the base region and the collector region is called the
base-collector junction, as indicated in Figure 4–1(b). A wire lead connects to each of the
three regions, as shown. These leads are labeled E, B, and C for emitter, base, and collec-
tor, respectively. The base region is lightly doped and very thin compared to the heavily
doped emitter and the moderately doped collector regions. (The reason for this is discussed
in the next section.) Figure 4–2 shows the schematic symbols for the npn and pnp bipolar
junction transistors.
The transistor was invented in 1947
by a team of scientists from Bell
Laboratories. William Shockley,
Walter Brattain, and John Bardeen
developed the solid-state device
that replaced the vacuum tube.
Each received the Nobel prize in
1956. The transistor is arguably the
most significant invention of the
twentieth century.

BASIC BJT OPERATION
In order for a BJT to operate properly as an amplifier, the two pn junctions must be
correctly biased with external dc voltages. In this section, we mainly use the npn
transistor for illustration. The operation of the pnp is the same as for the npn except
that the roles of the electrons and holes, the bias voltage polarities, and the current
directions are all reversed.
After completing this section, you should be able to

❏Explain the internal operation of a BJT
◆Discuss the hole and electron movement

Biasing
Figure 4–3 shows a bias arrangement for both npn and pnp BJTs for operation as an
amplifier. Notice that in both cases the base-emitter (BE) junction is forward-biased and the
base-collector (BC) junction is reverse-biased. This condition is called forward-reverse bias.

Operation
To understand how a transistor operates, let’s examine what happens inside the npn structure.
The heavily doped n-type emitter region has a very high density of conduction-band (free)
electrons, as indicated in Figure 4–4. These free electrons easily diffuse through the forward-
based BE junction into the lightly doped and very thin p-type base region, as indicated by the
wide arrow. The base has a low density of holes, which are the majority carriers, as repre-
sented by the white circles. A small percentage of the total number of free electrons injected
into the base region recombine with holes and move as valence electrons through the base re-
gion and into the emitter region as hole current, indicated by the red arrows.

176
◆
BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTORS
When the electrons that have recombined with holes as valence electrons leave the crys-
talline structure of the base, they become free electrons in the metallic base lead and pro-
duce the external base current. Most of the free electrons that have entered the base do not
recombine with holes because the base is very thin. As the free electrons move toward the
reverse-biased BC junction, they are swept across into the collector region by the attraction
of the positive collector supply voltage. The free electrons move through the collector re-
gion, into the external circuit, and then return into the emitter region along with the base
current, as indicated. The emitter current is slightly greater than the collector current be-
cause of the small base current that splits off from the total current injected into the base
region from the emitter.
Transistor Currents
The directions of the currents in an npn transistor and its schematic symbol are as shown in
Figure 4–5(a); those for a pnp transistor are shown in Figure 4–5(b). Notice that the arrow
on the emitter inside the transistor symbols points in the direction of conventional current.
These diagrams show that the emitter current (IE) is the sum of the collector current (IC)
and the base current (IB), expressed as follows:

BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTORS
When a transistor is connected to dc bias voltages, as shown in Figure 4–6 for both npn
and pnp types, VBB forward-biases the base-emitter junction, and VCC reverse-biases the
base-collector junction. Although in this chapter we are using separate battery symbols to
represent the bias voltages, in practice the voltages are often derived from a single dc
power supply. For example, VCC is normally taken directly from the power supply output
and VBB (which is smaller) can be produced with a voltage divider. Bias circuits are exam-
ined thoroughly in Chapter 5.

Equation 4–2
Typical values of bDC range from less than 20 to 200 or higher. bDC is usually designated
as an equivalent hybrid (h) parameter, hFE, on transistor datasheets. h-parameters are cov-
ered in Chapter 6. All you need to know now is that
The ratio of the dc collector current (IC) to the dc emitter current (IE) is the dc alpha
(aDC). The alpha is a less-used parameter than beta in transistor circuits.
Typically, values of aDC range from 0.95 to 0.99 or greater, but aDC is always less than 1.
The reason is that IC is always slightly less than IE by the amount of IB. For example, if

Transistor DC Model
You can view the unsaturated BJT as a device with a current input and a dependent cur-
rent source in the output circuit, as shown in Figure 4–7 for an npn.The input circuit is a
forward-biased diode through which there is base current. The output circuit is a depen-
dent current source (diamond-shaped element) with a value that is dependent on the base
current, IB, and equal to bDCIB. Recall that independent current source symbols have a
circular shape.

Although in an actual transistor VBE can be as high as 0.9 V and is dependent on current,
we will use 0.7 V throughout this text in order to simplify the analysis of the basic con-
cepts. Keep in mind that the characteristic of the base-emitter junction is the same as a nor-
mal diode curve like the one in Figure 2-12.

Collector Characteristic Curves
Using a circuit like that shown in Figure 4–10(a), a set of collector characteristic curves
can be generated that show how the collector current, IC, varies with the collector-to-
emitter voltage, VCE, for specified values of base current, IB. Notice in the circuit diagram
that both VBB and VCC are variable sources of voltage.
Assume that VBB is set to produce a certain value of IB and VCC is zero. For this condi-
tion, both the base-emitter junction and the base-collector junction are forward-biased be-
cause the base is at approximately 0.7 V while the emitter and the collector are at 0 V. The
base current is through the base-emitter junction because of the low impedance path to

ground and, therefore, IC is zero. When both junctions are forward-biased, the transistor is
in the saturation region of its operation. Saturation is the state of a BJT in which the col-
lector current has reached a maximum and is independent of the base current.
As VCC is increased, VCE increases as the collector current increases. This is indicated
by the portion of the characteristic curve between points A and B in Figure 4–10(b). IC in-
creases as VCC is increased because VCE remains less than 0.7 V due to the forward-biased
base-collector junction.
Ideally, when VCE exceeds 0.7 V, the base-collector junction becomes reverse-biased
and the transistor goes into the active, or linear, region of its operation. Once the base-
collector junction is reverse-biased, IC levels off and remains essentially constant for a
given value of IB as VCE continues to increase. Actually, IC increases very slightly as VCE
increases due to widening of the base-collector depletion region. This results in fewer
holes for recombination in the base region which effectively causes a slight increase in
bDC. This is shown by the portion of the characteristic curve between points B and C in
Figure 4–10(b). For this portion of the characteristic curve, the value of IC is determined
only by the relationship expressed as IC
bDCIB.
When VCE reaches a sufficiently high voltage, the reverse-biased base-collector junc-
tion goes into breakdown; and the collector current increases rapidly as indicated by the
part of the curve to the right of point C in Figure 4–10(b). A transistor should never be op-
erated in this breakdown region.
A family of collector characteristic curves is produced when IC versus VCE is plotted for
several values of IB, as illustrated in Figure 4–10(c). When IB
0, the transistor is in the
cutoff region although there is a very small collector leakage current as indicated. Cutoff
is the nonconducting state of a transistor. The amount of collector leakage current for
IB
0 is exaggerated on the graph for illustration.

Cutoff
As previously mentioned, when IB
0, the transistor is in the cutoff region of its opera-
tion. This is shown in Figure 4–13 with the base lead open, resulting in a base current of
zero. Under this condition, there is a very small amount of collector leakage current, ICEO,
due mainly to thermally produced carriers. Because ICEO is extremely small, it will usually
be neglected in circuit analysis so that VCE
VCC. In cutoff, neither the base-emitter nor
the base-collector junctions are forward-biased. The subscript CEO represents collector-
to-emitter with the base open.

Saturation
When the base-emitter junction becomes forward-biased and the base current is in-
creased, the collector current also increases (IC
bDCIB) and VCE decreases as a result of
more drop across the collector resistor (VCE
VCC - ICRC). This is illustrated in Figure
4–14. When VCE reaches its saturation value, VCE(sat), the base-collector junction be-
comes forward-biased and IC can increase no further even with a continued increase in IB.
At the point of saturation, the relation IC
bDCIB is no longer valid. VCE(sat) for a tran-
sistor occurs somewhere below the knee of the collector curves, and it is usually only a
few tenths of a volt.

Cutoff and saturation can be illustrated in relation to the collector characteristic curves
by the use of a load line. Figure 4–15 shows a dc load line drawn on a family of curves

ideal cutoff where IC

More About 
DC
The bDC or hFE is an important BJT parameter that we need to examine further. bDC is not
truly constant but varies with both collector current and with temperature. Keeping the
junction temperature constant and increasing IC causes bDC to increase to a maximum. A
further increase in IC beyond this maximum point causes bDC to decrease. If IC is held con-
stant and the temperature is varied, bDC changes directly with the temperature. If the tem-
perature goes up, bDC goes up and vice versa. Figure 4–17 shows the variation of bDC with
IC and junction temperature (TJ) for a typical BJT.
B
Solution
First, determine IC(sat).
Now, see if IB is large enough to produce IC(sat).
This shows that with the specified bDC, this base current is capable of producing an
IC greater than IC(sat). Therefore, the transistor is saturated, and the collector current
value of 11.5 mA is never reached. If you further increase IB, the collector current
remains at its saturation value of 9.8 mA.

A transistor datasheet usually specifies bDC (hFE) at specific IC values. Even at fixed
values of IC and temperature, bDC varies from one device to another for a given type of
transistor due to inconsistencies in the manufacturing process that are unavoidable. The
bDC specified at a certain value of IC is usually the minimum value, bDC(min), although the
maximum and typical values are also sometimes specified.

BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTORS
Maximum Transistor Ratings
A BJT, like any other electronic device, has limitations on its operation. These limitations
are stated in the form of maximum ratings and are normally specified on the manufac-
turer’s datasheet. Typically, maximum ratings are given for collector-to-base voltage,
collector-to-emitter voltage, emitter-to-base voltage, collector current, and power dissipation.
The product of VCE and IC must not exceed the maximum power dissipation. Both VCE
and IC cannot be maximum at the same time. If VCE is maximum, IC can be calculated as
If IC is maximum, VCE can be calculated by rearranging the previous equation as follows:
For any given transistor, a maximum power dissipation curve can be plotted on the col-
lector characteristic curves, as shown in Figure 4–18(a). These values are tabulated in
Figure 4–18(b). Assume PD(max) is 500 mW, VCE(max) is 20 V, and IC(max) is 50 mA. The
curve shows that this particular transistor cannot be operated in the shaded portion of the
graph. IC(max) is the limiting rating between points A and B, PD(max) is the limiting rating
between points B and C, and VCE(max) is the limiting rating between points C and D.

Derating PD(max)
PD(max) is usually specified at 25°C. For higher temperatures, PD(max) is less. Datasheets
often give derating factors for determining PD(max) at any temperature above 25°C. For
example, a derating factor of 2 mW/°C indicates that the maximum power dissipation is
reduced 2 mW for each degree Celsius increase in temperature.

can be adjusted without exceeding a rating. Which rating would be exceeded first?

=
=
EXAMPLE 4–6
Solution
First, find IB so that you can determine IC.
IC is much less than IC(max) and ideally will not change with VCC. It is determined only
by IB and bDC.
The voltage drop across RC is
Now you can determine the value of VCC when VCE
VCE(max)
15 V.
So,
VCC can be increased to 34.5 V, under the existing conditions, before VCE(max) is
exceeded. However, at this point it is not known whether or not PD(max) has been
exceeded.
Since PD(max) is 800 mW, it is not exceeded when VCC
34.5 V. So, VCE(max)
15 V
is the limiting rating in this case. If the base current is removed causing the transistor
to turn off, VCE(max) will be exceeded first because the entire supply voltage, VCC,
will be dropped across the transistor.

the maximum collector-emitter voltage (VCEO) is 40 V. The CEO subscript indicates that
the voltage is measured from collector (C) to emitter (E) with the base open (O). In the text,
we use VCE(max) for this parameter. Also notice that the maximum collector current is
200 mA.
The bDC (hFE) is specified for several values of IC. As you can see, hFE varies with IC as

BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTORS
DC and AC Quantities
Before discussing the concept of transistor amplification, the designations that we will use
for the circuit quantities of current, voltage, and resistance must be explained because am-
plifier circuits have both dc and ac quantities.
In this text, italic capital letters are used for both dc and ac currents (I) and voltages (V).
This rule applies to rms, average, peak, and peak-to-peak ac values. AC current and volt-
age values are always rms unless stated otherwise. Although some texts use lowercase i
and v for ac current and voltage, we reserve the use of lowercase i and v only for instanta-
neous values. In this text, the distinction between a dc current or voltage and an ac current
or voltage is in the subscript.
DC quantities always carry an uppercase roman (nonitalic) subscript. For example, IB,
IC, and IE are the dc transistor currents. VBE, VCB, and VCE are the dc voltages from one
transistor terminal to another. Single subscripted voltages such as VB, VC, and VE are dc
voltages from the transistor terminals to ground.
AC and all time-varying quantities always carry a lowercase italic subscript. For exam-
ple, Ib, Ic, and Ie are the ac transistor currents. Vbe, Vcb, and Vce are the ac voltages from one
transistor terminal to another. Single subscripted voltages such as Vb, Vc, and Ve are ac
voltages from the transistor terminals to ground.
The rule is different for internal transistor resistances. As you will see later, transistors
have internal ac resistances that are designated by lowercase 
with an appropriate sub-
script. For example, the internal ac emitter resistance is designated as 
.

THE BJT AS AN AMPLIFIER
Amplification is the process of linearly increasing the amplitude of an electrical signal
and is one of the major properties of a transistor. As you learned, a BJT exhibits current
gain (called b). When a BJT is biased in the active (or linear) region, as previously de-
scribed, the BE junction has a low resistance due to forward bias and the BC junction has
a high resistance due to reverse bias.

THE BJT AS AN AMPLIFIER

Voltage Amplification
As you have learned, a transistor amplifies current because the collector current is equal to
the base current multiplied by the current gain, b. The base current in a transistor is very
small compared to the collector and emitter currents. Because of this, the collector current
is approximately equal to the emitter current.
With this in mind, let’s look at the circuit in Figure 4–21. An ac voltage, Vs, is superim-
posed on the dc bias voltage VBB by capacitive coupling as shown. The dc bias voltage VCC
is connected to the collector through the collector resistor, RC.
The ac input voltage produces an ac base current, which results in a much larger ac col-
lector current. The ac collector current produces an ac voltage across RC, thus producing an
amplified, but inverted, reproduction of the ac input voltage in the active region of opera-
tion, as illustrated in Figure 4–21.
The forward-biased base-emitter junction presents a very low resistance to the ac signal.
This internal ac emitter resistance is designated 
in Figure 4–21 and appears in series
with RB. The ac base voltage is
The ac collector voltage, Vc, equals the ac voltage drop across RC.
Since 
the ac collector voltage is
Vb can be considered the transistor ac input voltage where Vb

IbRB. Vc can be con-
sidered the transistor ac output voltage. Since voltage gain is defined as the ratio of the output
voltage to the input voltage, the ratio of Vc to Vb is the ac voltage gain, Av, of the transistor.

for Vb yields

Switching Operation
Figure 4–23 illustrates the basic operation of a BJT as a switching device. In part (a), the
transistor is in the cutoff region because the base-emitter junction is not forward-biased. In
this condition, there is, ideally, an open between collector and emitter, as indicated by the
switch equivalent. In part (b), the transistor is in the saturation region because the base-
emitter junction and the base-collector junction are forward-biased and the base current is
made large enough to cause the collector current to reach its saturation value. In this con-
dition, there is, ideally, a short between collector and emitter, as indicated by the switch
equivalent. Actually, a small voltage drop across the transister of up to a few tenths of a
volt normally occurs, which is the saturation voltage, VCE(sat).

the square wave is at 0 V, the transistor is in cutoff; and since there is no collector cur-
rent, the LED does not emit light. When the square wave goes to its high level, the tran-
sistor saturates. This forward-biases the LED, and the resulting collector current
through the LED causes it to emit light. Thus, the LED is on for 1 second and off for 
1 second.
The LED in Figure 4–25 requires 30 mA to emit a sufficient level of light. Therefore,
the collector current should be approximately 30 mA. For the following circuit values,

the transistor saturates. Use double the minimum value of base current as a safety

BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTORS
In a phototransistor the base current is produced when light strikes the photosensitive
semiconductor base region. The collector-base pn junction is exposed to incident light
through a lens opening in the transistor package. When there is no incident light, there is
only a small thermally generated collector-to-emitter leakage current, ICEO; this dark cur-
rent is typically in the nA range. When light strikes the collector-base pn junction, a base
current, Il, is produced that is directly proportional to the light intensity. This action pro-
duces a collector current that increases with Il. Except for the way base current is gener-
ated, the phototransistor behaves as a conventional BJT. In many cases, there is no electri-
cal connection to the base.
The relationship between the collector current and the light-generated base current in a
phototransistor is
Equation 4–11
The schematic symbol and some typical phototransistors are shown in Figure 4–26.
Since the actual photogeneration of base current occurs in the collector-base region, the
larger the physical area of this region, the more base current is generated. Thus, a typical
phototransistor is designed to offer a large area to the incident light, as the simplified
structure diagram in Figure 4–27 illustrates.

A phototransistor is similar to a regular BJT except that the base current is produced
and controlled by light instead of a voltage source. The phototransistor effectively con-
verts light energy to an electrical signal.

THE PHOTOTRANSISTOR

197
A phototransistor can be either a two-lead or a three-lead device. In the three-lead con-
figuration, the base lead is brought out so that the device can be used as a conventional BJT
with or without the additional light-sensitivity feature. In the two-lead configuration, the
base is not electrically available, and the device can be used only with light as the input. In
many applications, the phototransistor is used in the two-lead version.
Figure 4–28 shows a phototransistor with a biasing circuit and typical collector charac-
teristic curves. Notice that each individual curve on the graph corresponds to a certain
value of light intensity (in this case, the units are mW/cm2) and that the collector current in
creases with light intensity.
Phototransistors are not sensitive to all light but only to light within a certain range of
wavelengths. They are most sensitive to particular wavelengths in the red and infrared
part of the spectrum, as shown by the peak of the infrared spectral response curve in
Figure 4–29.
Applications
Phototransistors are used in a variety of applications. A light-operated relay circuit is
shown in Figure 4–30(a). The phototransistor Q1 drives the BJT Q2. When there is suffi-
cient incident light on Q1, transistor Q2 is driven into saturation, and collector current
through the relay coil energizes the relay. The diode across the relay coil prevents, by its
limiting action, a large voltage transient from occurring at the collector of Q2 when the
transistor turns off.
Figure 4–30(b) shows a circuit in which a relay is deactivated by incident light on
the phototransistor. When there is insufficient light, transistor Q2 is biased on, keeping
the relay energized. When there is sufficient light, phototransistor Q1 turns on; this
pulls the base of Q2 low, thus turning Q2 off and de-energizing the relay.

TRANSISTOR CATEGORIES AND PACKAGING
◆
199
Transistor Categories
Manufacturers generally classify bipolar junction transistors into three broad categories:
general-purpose/small-signal devices, power devices, and RF (radio frequency/microwave)
devices. Although each of these categories, to a large degree, has its own unique package
types, you will find certain types of packages used in more than one device category. Let’s
look at transistor packages for each of the three categories so that you will be able to
recognize a transistor when you see one on a circuit board and have a good idea of what
general category it is in.
General-Purpose/Small-Signal Transistors
General-purpose/small-signal transistors
are generally used for low- or medium-power amplifiers or switching circuits. The pack-
ages are either plastic or metal cases. Certain types of packages contain multiple transis-
tors. Figure 4–34 illustrates two common plastic cases and a metal can package.
Figure 4–35 shows multiple-transistor packages. Some of the multiple-transistor pack-
ages such as the dual in-line (DIP) and the small-outline (SO) are the same as those used
for many integrated circuits. Typical pin connections are shown so you can identify the
emitter, base, and collector.
Power Transistors
Power transistors are used to handle large currents (typically more
than 1 A) and/or large voltages. For example, the final audio stage in a stereo system uses
a power transistor amplifier to drive the speakers. Figure 4–36 shows some common package
1. How does a phototransistor differ from a conventional BJT?
2. A three-lead phototransistor has an external (emitter, base, collector) lead.

TRANSISTOR CATEGORIES AND PACKAGING
BJTs are available in a wide range of package types for various applications. Those
with mounting studs or heat sinks are usually power transistors. Low-power and
medium-power transistors are usually found in smaller metal or plastic cases. Still
another package classification is for high-frequency devices. You should be familiar
with common transistor packages and be able to identify the emitter, base, and collector
terminals.
After completing this section, you should be able to
❏Identify various types of transistor packages
❏List three broad transistor categories
◆Identify package pin configurations
typical graph of CTR versus forward LED current. For this case, it varies from about 50%
to about 110%.
Optocouplers are used to isolate sections of a circuit that are incompatible in terms of
the voltage levels or currents required. For example, they are used to protect hospital pa-
tients from shock when they are connected to monitoring instruments or other devices.
They are also used to isolate low-current control or signal circuits from noisy power supply
circuits or higher-current motor and machine circuits.

BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTORS
Troubleshooting a Biased Transistor
Several faults can occur in a simple transistor bias circuit. Possible faults are open bias re-
sistors, open or resistive connections, shorted connections, and opens or shorts internal to
the transistor itself. Figure 4–38 is a basic transistor bias circuit with all voltages refer-
enced to ground. The two bias voltages are VBB
3 V and VCC
9 V. The correct volt-
age measurements at the base and collector are shown. Analytically, these voltages are ver-
ified as follows. A bDC
200 is taken as midway between the minimum and maximum
values of hFE given on the datasheet for the 2N3904 in Figure 4–20. A different hFE (bDC),
of course, will produce different results for the given circuit.
 VC = 9 V - ICRC = 9 V - (8.2 mA)(560 Æ) = 4.4 V

Several faults that can occur in the circuit and the accompanying symptoms are illus-
trated in Figure 4–39. Symptoms are shown in terms of measured voltages that are incor-
rect. If a transistor circuit is not operating correctly, it is a good idea to verify that VCC and
ground are connected and operating. A simple check at the top of the collector resistor and
at the collector itself will quickly ascertain if VCC is present and if the transistor is con-
ducting normally or is in cutoff or saturation. If it is in cutoff, the collector voltage will
equal VCC; if it is in saturation, the collector voltage will be near zero. Another faulty
measurement can be seen if there is an open in the collector path. The term floating point
refers to a point in the circuit that is not electrically connected to ground or a “solid” volt-
age. Normally, very small and sometimes fluctuating voltages in the mV to low mV range
are generally measured at floating points. The faults in Figure 4–39 are typical but do not
represent all possible faults that may occur.
Testing a Transistor with a DMM
A digital multimeter can be used as a fast and simple way to check a transistor for open or
shorted junctions. For this test, you can view the transistor as two diodes connected as
shown in Figure 4–40 for both npn and pnp transistors. The base-collector junction is one
diode and the base-emitter junction is the other.

Recall that a good diode will show an extremely high resistance (or open) with reverse
bias and a very low resistance with forward bias. A defective open diode will show an ex-
tremely high resistance (or open) for both forward and reverse bias. A defective shorted or
resistive diode will show zero or a very low resistance for both forward and reverse bias.
An open diode is the most common type of failure. Since the transistor pn junctions are, in
effect diodes, the same basic characteristics apply.

BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTORS
The DMM Diode Test Position
Many digital multimeters (DMMs) have a diode test
position that provides a convenient way to test a transistor. A typical DMM, as shown in
Figure 4–41, has a small diode symbol to mark the position of the function switch. When
set to diode test, the meter provides an internal voltage sufficient to forward-bias and re-
verse-bias a transistor junction.

Typical DMM test of a properly functioning npn transistor. Leads are reversed for a pnp transistor.
When the Transistor Is Not Defective
In Figure 4–41(a), the red (positive) lead of the
meter is connected to the base of an npn transistor and the black (negative) lead is connected
to the emitter to forward-bias the base-emitter junction. If the junction is good, you will get a
reading of between approximately 0.6 V and 0.8 V, with 0.7 V being typical for forward bias.
In Figure 4–41(b), the leads are switched to reverse-bias the base-emitter junction, as
shown. If the transistor is working properly, you will typically get an OL indication.
The process just described is repeated for the base-collector junction as shown in Figure
4–41(c) and (d). For a pnp transistor, the polarity of the meter leads are reversed for each test.
When the Transistor Is Defective
When a transistor has failed with an open junction or
internal connection, you get an open circuit voltage reading (OL) for both the forward-bias
and the reverse-bias conditions for that junction, as illustrated in Figure 4–42(a). If a junction
is shorted, the meter reads 0 V in both forward- and reverse-bias tests, as indicated in part (b).
Some DMMs provide a test socket on their front panel for testing a transistor for the hFE
(bDC) value. If the transistor is inserted improperly in the socket or if it is not functioning
properly due to a faulty junction or internal connection, a typical meter will flash a 1 or display
a 0. If a value of bDC within the normal range for the specific transistor is displayed, the device
is functioning properly. The normal range of bDC can be determined from the datasheet.
Checking a Transistor with the OHMs Function
DMMs that do not have a diode test
position or an hFE socket can be used to test a transistor for open or shorted junctions by set-
ting the function switch to an OHMs range. For the forward-bias check of a good transistor
pn junction, you will get a resistance reading that can vary depending on the meter’s internal
battery. Many DMMs do not have sufficient voltage on the OHMs range to fully forward-bias
a junction, and you may get a reading of from several hundred to several thousand ohms.
For the reverse-bias check of a good transistor, you will get an out-of-range indication
on most DMMs because the reverse resistance is too high to measure. An out-of-range
indication may be a flashing 1 or a display of dashes, depending on the particular DMM.
Even though you may not get accurate forward and reverse resistance readings on a
DMM, the relative readings are sufficient to indicate a properly functioning transistor pn
junction. The out-of-range indication shows that the reverse resistance is very high, as you

TROUBLESHOOTING
◆
205
expect. The reading of a few hundred to a few thousand ohms for forward bias indicates
that the forward resistance is small compared to the reverse resistance, as you expect.
Transistor Testers
An individual transistor can be tested either in-circuit or out-of-circuit with a transistor
tester. For example, let’s say that an amplifier on a particular printed circuit (PC) board has
malfunctioned. Good troubleshooting practice dictates that you do not unsolder a compo-
nent from a circuit board unless you are reasonably sure that it is bad or you simply cannot
isolate the problem down to a single component. When components are removed, there is
a risk of damage to the PC board contacts and traces.
You can perform an in-circuit check of the transistor using a transistor tester similar to
the one shown in Figure 4–43. The three clip-leads are connected to the transistor termi-
nals and the tester gives a positive indication if the transistor is good.
(a) Forward-bias test and reverse-
 
bias test give the same reading
 
(OL is typical) for an open
 
BC junction.
(b) Forward- and reverse-bias tests 
 
for a shorted junction give the
 
same 0 V reading.

BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTORS
In-Circuit and Out-of-Circuit Tests
Case 1
If the transistor tests defective, it should be carefully removed and replaced with a
known good one. An out-of-circuit check of the replacement device is usually a good idea,
just to make sure it is OK. The transistor is plugged into the socket on the transistor tester
for out-of-circuit tests.
Case 2
If the transistor tests good in-circuit but the circuit is not working properly, exam-
ine the circuit board for a poor connection at the collector pad or for a break in the con-
necting trace. A poor solder joint often results in an open or a highly resistive contact. The
physical point at which you actually measure the voltage is very important in this case. For
example, if you measure on the collector lead when there is an external open at the collec-
tor pad, you will measure a floating point. If you measure on the connecting trace or on the
RC lead, you will read VCC. This situation is illustrated in Figure 4–44.

Compare with Figure 4–44.
Importance of Point-of-Measurement in Troubleshooting
In case 2, if you had taken
the initial measurement on the transistor lead itself and the open were internal to the tran-
sistor as shown in Figure 4–45, you would have measured VCC. This indicates a defective
transistor even before the tester was used, assuming the base-to-emitter voltage is normal.
This simple concept emphasizes the importance of point-of-measurement in certain trou-
bleshooting situations.
What fault do the measurements in Figure 4–46 indicate?
Solution
The transistor is in cutoff, as indicated by the 10 V measurement on the collector lead. The
base bias voltage of 3 V appears on the PC board contact but not on the transistor lead,
as indicated by the floating point measurement. This shows that there is an open external
to the transistor between the two measured base points. Check the solder joint at the base
contact on the PC board. If the open were internal, there would be 3 V on the base lead.
Related Problem
If the meter in Figure 4–46 that now reads 3 V indicates a floating point when touch-
ing the circuit board pad, what is the most likely fault?

Leakage Measurement
Very small leakage currents exist in all transistors and in most
cases are small enough to neglect (usually nA). When a transistor is connected with the
base open (IB
0), it is in cutoff. Ideally IC
0; but actually there is a small current from
collector to emitter, as mentioned earlier, called ICEO (collector-to-emitter current with
base open). This leakage current is usually in the nA range. A faulty transistor will often
have excessive leakage current and can be checked in a transistor tester. Another leakage
current in transistors is the reverse collector-to-base current, ICBO. This is measured with
the emitter open. If it is excessive, a shorted collector-base junction is likely.
Gain Measurement
In addition to leakage tests, the typical transistor tester also checks
the bDC. A known value of IB is applied, and the resulting IC is measured. The reading will
indicate the value of the IC/IB ratio, although in some units only a relative indication is
given. Most testers provide for an in-circuit bDC check, so that a suspected device does not
have to be removed from the circuit for testing.
Curve Tracers
A curve tracer is an oscilloscope type of instrument that can display tran-
sistor characteristics such as a family of collector curves. In addition to the measurement
and display of various transistor characteristics, diode curves can also be displayed.

BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTORS
Application Activity: Security Alarm System
A circuit using transistor switches will be developed for use in an alarm system for detect-
ing forced entry into a building. In its simplest form, the alarm system will accommodate
four zones with any number of openings. It can be expanded to cover additional zones. For
the purposes of this application, a zone is one room in a house or other building. The sensor
used for each opening can be either a mechanical switch, a magnetically operated switch,
or an optical sensor. Detection of an intrusion can be used to initiate an audible alarm signal
and/or to initiate transmission of a signal over the phone line to a monitoring service.
Designing the Circuit
A basic block diagram of the system is shown in Figure 4–47. The sensors for each zone
are connected to the switching circuits, and the output of the switching circuit goes to an
audible alarm circuit and/or to a telephone dialing circuit. The focus of this application is
the transistor switching circuits.

shown in part (b). The sensors are represented by switch symbols.

 FIGURE 4–48
Zone sensor configuration.
A circuit for one zone is shown in Figure 4–49. It consists of two BJTs, Q1 and Q2. As
long as the zone sensors are closed, Q1 is in the on state (saturated). The very low satura-
tion voltage at the Q1 collector keeps Q2 off. Notice that the collector of Q2 is left open
with no load connected. This allows for all four of the zone circuit outputs to be tied to-
gether and a common load connected externally to drive the alarm and/or dialing circuits.
If one of the zone sensors opens, indicating a break-in, Q1 turns off and its collector volt-
age goes to VCC. This turns on Q2, causing it to saturate. The on state of Q2 will then acti-
vate the audible alarm and the telephone dialing sequence.

required to saturate Q1 at IC = 10 mA.
3. To ensure saturation, calculate the value of R1 necessary to provide sufficient base
current to Q1 from the +12 V sensor input. R2 can be any arbitrarily high value to
assure the base of Q1 is near ground when there is no input voltage.
4. Calculate the value of R4 so that a sufficient base current is supplied to Q2 to

nected to a 12 V source simulates the zone input and a 620 Æ load resistor is connected to

indicated by 0.126 V at its collector. When the zone switch is closed, Q2 is off as indi-
cated by the 11.999 V at its collector.
5. How does the Q2 saturation voltage compare to the value specified on the datasheet?
Simulate the circuit using your Multisim software. Observe the operation with the
virtual multimeter.
Prototyping and Testing
Now that the circuit has been simulated, it is connected on a protoboard and tested for
proper operation.
To build and test a similar circuit, go to Experiment 4 in your lab manual (Laboratory
Exercises for Electronic Devices by David Buchla and Steven Wetterling).
Printed Circuit Board
The transistor switching circuit prototype has been built and tested. It is now committed

circuits on the board, one for each zone to be monitored. The outputs are externally con-
nected to form a single input.
6. Compare the printed circuit board to the schematic in Figure 4–49 and verify that
they agree. Identify each component.
7. Compare the resistor values on the printed circuit board to those that you calcu-
lated previously. They should closely agree.
8. Label the input and output pins on the printed circuit board according to their

SUMMARY
Section 4–1
◆The BJT (bipolar junction transistor) is constructed with three regions: base, collector, and emitter.
◆The BJT has two pn junctions, the base-emitter junction and the base-collector junction.
◆Current in a BJT consists of both free electrons and holes, thus the term bipolar.
◆The base region is very thin and lightly doped compared to the collector and emitter regions.
◆The two types of bipolar junction transistor are the npn and the pnp.
Section 4–2
◆To operate as an amplifier, the base-emitter junction must be forward-biased and the base-
collector junction must be reverse-biased. This is called forward-reverse bias.
◆The three currents in the transistor are the base current (IB), emitter current (IE), and collector
current (IC).
◆
IB is very small compared to IC and IE.
Section 4–3
◆The dc current gain of a transistor is the ratio of IC to IB and is designated bDC. Values typically
range from less than 20 to several hundred.
◆bDC is usually referred to as hFE on transistor datasheets.
◆The ratio of IC to IE is called aDC. Values typically range from 0.95 to 0.99.
◆There is a variation in bDC over temperature and also from one transistor to another of the
same type.
Section 4–4
◆When a transistor is forward-reverse biased, the voltage gain depends on the internal emitter
resistance and the external collector resistance.
◆Voltage gain is the ratio of output voltage to input voltage.
◆Internal transistor resistances are represented by a lowercase r.
Section 4–5
◆A transistor can be operated as an electronic switch in cutoff and saturation.
◆In cutoff, both pn junctions are reverse-biased and there is essentially no collector current. The
transistor ideally behaves like an open switch between collector and emitter.
◆In saturation, both pn junctions are forward-biased and the collector current is maximum. The
transistor ideally behaves like a closed switch between collector and emitter.
Section 4–6
◆In a phototransistor, base current is produced by incident light.
◆A phototransistor can be either a two-lead or a three-lead device.
◆An optocoupler consists of an LED and a photodiode or phototransistor.
◆Optocouplers are used to electrically isolate circuits.
Section 4–7
◆There are many types of transistor packages using plastic, metal, or ceramic.
◆Two basic package types are through-hole and surface mount.
Section 4–8
◆It is best to check a transistor in-circuit before removing it.
◆Common faults in transistor circuits are open junctions, low bDC, excessive leakage currents,
and external opens and shorts on the circuit board.

In this GreenTech Application, solar tracking is examined. Solar tracking is the process of
moving the solar panel to track the daily movement of the sun and the seasonal changes
in elevation of the sun in the southern sky. The purpose of a solar tracker is to increase the
amount of solar energy that can be collected by the system. For flat-panel collectors, an
increase of 30% to 50% in collected energy can be realized with sun tracking compared
to fixed solar panels.
Before looking at methods for tracking, let’s review how the sun moves across the sky.
The daily motion of the sun follows the arc of a circle from east to west that has its axis
pointed north near the location of the North Star. As the seasons change from the winter
solstice to the summer solstice, the sun rises a little further to the north each day. Between
the summer solstice and the winter solstice, the sun moves further south each day. The
amount of the north-south motion depends on your location.
Single-Axis Solar Tracking
For flat-panel solar collectors, the most economical and generally most practical solution
to tracking is to follow the daily east-west motion, and not the annual north-south motion.
The daily east-to-west motion can be followed with a single-axis tracking system. There
are two basic single-axis systems: polar and azimuth. In a polar system, the main axis is
pointed to the polar north (North Star), as shown in Figure GA4–1(a). (In telescope
terminology, this is called an equatorial mounting.) The advantage is that the solar panel is
kept at an angle facing the sun at all times because it tracks the sun from east to west and
is angled toward the southern sky. In an azimuth tracking system, the motor drives the
solar panel and frequently multiple panels. The panels can be oriented horizontally but
still track the east-to-west motion of the sun. Although this does not intercept as much of
the sunlight during the seasons, it has less wind loading and is more feasible for long
rows of solar panels. Figure GA4–1(b) shows a solar array that is oriented horizontally
with the axis pointing to true north and uses azimuth tracking (east to west). As you can
see, sunlight will strike the polar-aligned panel more directly during the seasonal movement
of the sun than it will with the horizontal orientation of the azimuth tracker.

BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTORS
 FIGURE GA4–1
Types of single-axis solar tracking.
Some solar tracking systems combine both the azimuth and the elevation tracking, which
is known as dual-axis tracking. Ideally, the solar panel should always face directly
toward the sun so that the sun light rays are perpendicular to the panel. With dual-axis
tracking, the annual north-south motion of the sun can be followed in addition to the

daily east-to-west movement. This is particularly important with concentrating collectors
that need to be oriented correctly to focus the sun on the active region.
Figure GA4–2 is an example showing the improvement in energy collection of a typical
tracking panel versus a nontracking panel for a flat solar collector. As you can see, track-
ing extends the time that a given output can be maintained.
There are several methods of implementing solar tracking. Two main ones are sensor con-
trolled and timer controlled.
Sensor-Controlled Solar Tracking
This type of tracking control uses photosensitive devices such as photodiodes or photo-
resistors. Typically, there are two light sensors for the azimuth control and two for the ele-
vation control. Each pair senses the direction of light from the sun and activates the motor
control to move the solar panel to align perpendicular to the sun’s rays.
Figure GA4–3 shows the basic idea of a sensor-controlled tracker. Two photodiodes with
a light-blocking partition between them are mounted on the same plane as the solar panel.

Tracking
Nontracking

If the solar panel is not facing directly toward the sun, the light strikes the panel and the
photodiode assembly at an angle so that one of the diodes is shaded or partially shaded by
the partition and receives less light than the other, as illustrated in Figure GA4–3(a). As a
result, the photodiode with the most light produces a higher current than the partially-
shaded device. The difference in currents from the two diodes is sensed by an operational
amplifier and sends an output voltage to the motor. The motor rotates the solar panel until
both photodiodes produce the same current and then is stopped by the control circuit, as
illustrated in Figure GA4–3(b). The light-blocking partition between the diodes is ori-
ented vertically for azimuth tracking and horizontally for elevation tracking. The photo-
diode assemblies must face in the same direction as the solar panel, so they are mounted
on the solar panel frame.
Dual-Axis Solar Tracking
As mentioned, a dual-axis system tracks the sun in both az-
imuth and elevation. It requires two photo-sensing elements and two motors, as shown in
Figure GA4–4. The outputs from the two pairs of sensors go to the position-control circuits.
A circuit detects the differential between the two azimuth sensor outputs and, if the differ-
ential is sufficient, the azimuth motor is advanced westward until a balance occurs between
the two sensors. Similarly, another circuit detects the differential between the two elevation
sensor outputs and, correspondingly, advances the elevation motor to rotate the solar panel
either up or down until a balance occurs between the two sensors. When night falls and the
solar panel is at its western-most position, the position-control circuits detect no output
from the azimuth sensors and send a reset command to the azimuth motor to cause it to
turn the soar panel back to its eastmost position to await sunrise the next day. The system
must be sensitive enough to detect very small differences in photodiode output because the
more closely the sun is tracked, the better the energy collection efficiency.
A drawback of the sensor-controlled system is its sensitivity requirement for cloudy days
or a passing cloud, when the differences in detected light are much smaller. The system
must be able to distinguish between two low-light levels. Also, a certain amount of energy
must be diverted to power the electronics and motors, although this is a requirement of
most types of tracking systems.
Timer-Controlled Solar Tracking
Solar tracking can also be accomplished by using an electronic timer that causes the motors
to move incrementally in azimuth and elevation. During the day the sun moves from east-
to-west and this takes approximately 12 hours at summer solstice. The sun moves at a

rate of approximately 15° per hour. A timer-controlled tracking system can be designed to
follow the sun at desired increments. For example, the panel azimuth position could
advance every minute (60 times an hour), every 5 minutes (12 times an hour), or every
15 minutes (4 times an hour), depending on the tracking accuracy desired.
The sun moves slowly in elevation as it progresses from winter solstice to summer sol-
stice and back again, traversing an angle of 47° in six months. This is a rate of 8° per
month. The tracking system could make one adjustment in the elevation or tilt of the solar
panel each week or each month, depending on the accuracy desired.
Generally, a timer-controlled tracker uses an accurate time source, such as a crystal oscil-
lator, a microprocessor with associated timing and control circuits, and motor interface
circuits. The advantage of this type of tracking is that it is independent of the amount of
sunlight that is striking the solar panel. Like the sensor-controlled system, the electronics
and motors use extra energy. A simple block diagram is shown in Figure GA4–5.

INTRODUCTION
As you learned in Chapter 4, a transistor must be properly
biased in order to operate as an amplifier. DC biasing is used
to establish fixed dc values for the transistor currents and
voltages called the dc operating point or quiescent point
(Q-point). In this chapter, several types of bias circuits are
discussed. This material lays the groundwork for the study 
of amplifiers, and other circuits that require proper biasing.
APPLICATION ACTIVITY PREVIEW
The Application Activity focuses on a system for controlling
temperature in an industrial chemical process. You will be
dealing with a circuit that converts a temperature measure-
ment to a proportional voltage that is used to adjust the
temperature of a liquid in a storage tank. The first step is to
learn all you can about transistor operation. You will then
apply your knowledge to the Application Activity at the end
of the chapter.

THE DC OPERATING POINT

229
DC Bias
Bias establishes the dc operating point (Q-point) for proper linear operation of an ampli-
fier. If an amplifier is not biased with correct dc voltages on the input and output, it can go
into saturation or cutoff when an input signal is applied. Figure 5–1 shows the effects of
proper and improper dc biasing of an inverting amplifier. In part (a), the output signal is an
amplified replica of the input signal except that it is inverted, which means that it is
out of phase with the input. The output signal swings equally above and below the dc bias
level of the output, VDC(out). Improper biasing can cause distortion in the output signal, as
illustrated in parts (b) and (c). Part (b) illustrates limiting of the positive portion of the out-
put voltage as a result of a Q-point (dc operating point) being too close to cutoff. Part (c)
shows limiting of the negative portion of the output voltage as a result of a dc operating
point being too close to saturation.

THE DC OPERATING POINT
A transistor must be properly biased with a dc voltage in order to operate as a linear
amplifier. A dc operating point must be set so that signal variations at the input terminal
are amplified and accurately reproduced at the output terminal. As you learned in
Chapter 4, when you bias a transistor, you establish the dc voltage and current values.
This means, for example, that at the dc operating point, IC and VCE have specified
values. The dc operating point is often referred to as the Q-point (quiescent point).
After completing this section, you should be able to

effects of dc bias.
In 1965, a single transistor cost
more than a dollar. By 1975, the
cost of a transistor had dropped to
less than a penny, while transistor
size allowed for almost 100,000
transistors on a single chip. From
1979 to 1999, processor
performance went from about
1.5 million instructions per second
(MIPS) to over 1,000 MIPS. Today’s
processors, some topping out at
well above one billion transistors,
run at 3.2 GHz and higher, deliver
over 10,000 MIPS, and can be
manufactured in high volumes
with transistors that cost less than
1/10,000th of a cent.

In Figure 5–3, we assign three values to IB and observe what happens to IC and VCE.
First, VBB is adjusted to produce an IB of

using a dc load line. This is a straight line drawn on the characteristic curves from the

curves.

The point at which the load line intersects a characteristic curve represents the Q-point
for that particular value of IB. Figure 5–4(b) illustrates the Q-point on the load line for each
value of IB in Figure 5–3. 
Linear Operation
The region along the load line including all points between saturation
and cutoff is generally known as the linear region of the transistor’s operation. As long as
the transistor is operated in this region, the output voltage is ideally a linear reproduction
of the input.
Figure 5–5 shows an example of the linear operation of a transistor. AC quantities are
indicated by lowercase italic subscripts. Assume a sinusoidal voltage, Vin, is superimposed
on VBB, causing the base current to vary sinusoidally
above and below its Q-point
value of
This, in turn, causes the collector current to vary 10 mA above and below
its Q-point value of 30 mA. As a result of the variation in collector current, the collector-
to-emitter voltage varies 2.2 V above and below its Q-point value of 3.4 V. Point A on the
load line in Figure 5–5 corresponds to the positive peak of the sinusoidal input voltage.
Point B corresponds to the negative peak, and point Q corresponds to the zero value of the
sine wave, as indicated. VCEQ, ICQ, and IBQ are dc Q-point values with no input sinusoidal
voltage applied.

Waveform Distortion
As previously mentioned, under certain input signal conditions
the location of the Q-point on the load line can cause one peak of the Vce waveform to be
limited or clipped, as shown in parts (a) and (b) of Figure 5–6. In each case the input sig-
nal is too large for the Q-point location and is driving the transistor into cutoff or saturation
during a portion of the input cycle. When both peaks are limited as in Figure 5–6(c), the
transistor is being driven into both saturation and cutoff by an excessively large input sig-
nal. When only the positive peak is limited, the transistor is being driven into cutoff but not
saturation. When only the negative peak is limited, the transistor is being driven into satu-
ration but not cutoff.
Gordon Moore, one of the founders
of Intel, observed in an article in
the April, 1965, issue of Electronics
magazine that innovations in
technology would allow a doubling
of the number of transistors in a
given space every year (in an update
article in 1975, Moore adjusted the
rate to every two years to account
for the growing complexity of
chips), and that the speed of those
transistors would increase. This
prediction has become widely
known as Moore’s law.

Since IC(cutoff)

collector current can occur and still maintain linear operation of the transistor.

tion is reached, IC can increase an amount ideally equal to
However, IC can decrease by 39.6 mA before cutoff (IC

the limiting excursion is 21 mA because the Q-point is closer to saturation than to cut-
off. The 21 mA is the maximum peak variation of the collector current. Actually, it
would be slightly less in practice because VCE(sat) is not quite zero.

Voltage-divider bias.
Up to this point a separate dc source, VBB, was used to bias the base-emitter junction be-
cause it could be varied independently of VCC and it helped to illustrate transistor opera-
tion. A more practical bias method is to use VCC as the single bias source, as shown in
Figure 5–9. To simplify the schematic, the battery symbol is omitted and replaced by a line
termination circle with a voltage indicator (VCC) as shown.
A dc bias voltage at the base of the transistor can be developed by a resistive voltage-
divider that consists of R1 and R2, as shown in Figure 5–9. VCC is the dc collector supply
voltage. Two current paths are between point A and ground: one through R2 and the other
through the base-emitter junction of the transistor and RE.
Generally, voltage-divider bias circuits are designed so that the base current is much
smaller than the current (I2) through R2 in Figure 5–9. In this case, the voltage-divider cir-
cuit is very straightforward to analyze because the loading effect of the base current can be
ignored. A voltage divider in which the base current is small compared to the current in R2
is said to be a stiff voltage divider because the base voltage is relatively independent of
different transistors and temperature effects.
To analyze a voltage-divider circuit in which IB is small compared to I2, first calculate
the voltage on the base using the unloaded voltage-divider rule:

The basic analysis developed in Example 5–2 is all that is needed for most voltage-
divider circuits, but there may be cases where you need to analyze the circuit with more ac-
curacy. Ideally, a voltage-divider circuit is stiff, which means that the transistor does not
appear as a significant load. All circuit design involves trade-offs; and one trade-off is that
stiff voltage dividers require smaller resistors, which are not always desirable because of
potential loading effects on other circuits and added power requirements. If the circuit
designer wanted to raise the input resistance, the divider string may not be stiff; and more
detailed analysis is required to calculate circuit parameters. To determine if the divider is stiff,
you need to examine the dc input resistance looking in at the base as shown in Figure 5–11.
Once you know VC and VE, you can determine VCE.
VCE = VC - VE

You can quickly estimate the loading effect by comparing RIN(BASE) to the resistor R2 in

effect will be 10% or less and the voltage divider is stiff. If RIN(BASE) is less than ten times

polarities opposite to the npn. This can be accomplished with a negative collector supply

Emitter Bias
Emitter bias provides excellent bias stability in spite of changes in

both a positive and a negative supply voltage. To obtain a reasonable estimate of the key dc
values in an emitter-biased circuit, analysis is quite easy. In an npn circuit, such as shown

TRANSISTOR BIAS CIRCUITS
in Figure 5–17, the small base current causes the base voltage to be slightly below ground.
The emitter voltage is one diode drop less than this. The combination of this small drop
across RB and VBE forces the emitter to be at approximately
Using this approxima-
tion, you can obtain the emitter current as
VEE is entered as a negative value in this equation.
You can apply the approximation that 
to calculate the collector voltage.
The approximation that
is useful for troubleshooting because you won’t need
to perform any detailed calculations. As in the case of voltage-divider bias, there is a more

Emitter-Feedback Bias
If an emitter resistor is added to the base-bias circuit in Figure 5–20, the result is emitter-
feedback bias, as shown in Figure 5–21. The idea is to help make base bias more pre-
dictable with negative feedback, which negates any attempted change in collector current
with an opposing change in base voltage. If the collector current tries to increase, the emit-
ter voltage increases, causing an increase in base voltage because VB
VE + VBE. This in-
crease in base voltage reduces the voltage across RB, thus reducing the base current and
keeping the collector current from increasing. A similar action occurs if the collector cur-
rent tries to decrease. While this is better for linear circuits than base bias, it is still de-
pendent on
and is not as predictable as voltage-divider bias. To calculate IE, you can
write Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) around the base circuit.

Collector-Feedback Bias
In Figure 5–22, the base resistor RB is connected to the collector rather than to VCC, as it
was in the base bias arrangement discussed earlier. The collector voltage provides the bias
for the base-emitter junction. The negative feedback creates an “offsetting” effect that
tends to keep the Q-point stable. If IC tries to increase, it drops more voltage across RC,
thereby causing VC to decrease. When VC decreases, there is a decrease in voltage across
RB, which decreases IB. The decrease in IB produces less IC which, in turn, drops less volt-
age across RC and thus offsets the decrease in VC.
Analysis of a Collector-Feedback Bias Circuit
By Ohm’s law, the base current can be
expressed as
Let’s assume that 
The collector voltage is
Also,
Substituting for VC in the equation 
The terms can be arranged so that

Equation 5–13 shows that the collector current is

This dependency, of course, can be minimized
by making
An important feature of collector-feedback
bias is that it essentially eliminates the
dependency even if the stated condi-
tions are met.
As you have learned,
varies directly with temperature, and VBE varies inversely
with temperature. As the temperature goes up in a collector-feedback circuit,
goes
up and VBE goes down. The increase in
acts to increase IC. The decrease in VBE
acts to increase IB which, in turn also acts to increase IC. As IC tries to increase, the
voltage drop across RC also tries to increase. This tends to reduce the collector voltage
and therefore the voltage across RB, thus reducing IB and offsetting the attempted in-
crease in IC and the attempted decrease in VC. The result is that the collector-feedback
circuit maintains a relatively stable Q-point. The reverse action occurs when the tem-
perature decreases.

TROUBLESHOOTING
In a biased transistor circuit, the transistor can fail or a resistor in the bias circuit can
fail. We will examine several possibilities in this section using the voltage-divider bias
arrangement. Many circuit failures result from open resistors, internally open transistor
leads and junctions, or shorted junctions. Often, these failures can produce an apparent
cutoff or saturation condition when voltage is measured at the collector.
After completing this section, you should be able to

Troubleshooting a Voltage-Divider Biased Transistor
An example of a transistor with voltage-divider bias is shown in Figure 5–24. For the spe-
cific component values shown, you should get the voltage readings approximately as indi-
cated when the circuit is operating properly.
For this type of bias circuit, a particular group of faults will cause the transistor collec-
tor to be at VCC when measured with respect to ground. Five faults are indicated for the cir-
cuit in Figure 5–25(a). The collector voltage is equal to 10 V with respect to ground for
each of the faults as indicated in the table in part (b). Also, for each of the faults, the base
voltage and the emitter voltage with respect to ground are given.
Fault 1: Resistor R1 Open
This fault removes the bias voltage from the base, thus connect-
ing the base to ground through R2 and forcing the transistor into cutoff because VB

0 A. The transistor is nonconducting so there is no IC and, therefore, no voltage drop
across RC. This makes the collector voltage equal to VCC (10 V). Since there is no base cur-
rent or collector current, there is also no emitter current and VE
0 V.
Fault 2: Resistor RE Open
This fault prevents base current, emitter current, and collec-
tor current except for a very small ICBO that can be neglected. Since IC

TRANSISTOR BIAS CIRCUITS
voltage drop across RC and, therefore, VC = VCC = 10 V. The voltage divider produces a
voltage at the base with respect to ground as follows:
When a voltmeter is connected to the emitter, it provides a current path through its high
internal impedance, resulting in a forward-biased base-emitter junction. Therefore, the
emitter voltage is
The amount of the forward voltage drop across the BE
junction depends on the current. VBE = 0.7 V is assumed for purposes of illustration, but it
may be much less. The result is an emitter voltage as follows:
Fault 3: Base Internally Open
An internal transistor fault is more likely to happen than
an open resistor. Again, the transistor is nonconducting so IC  0 A and VC  VCC  10 V.
Just as for the case of the open RE, the voltage divider produces 3.2 V at the external base
connection. The voltage at the external emitter connection is 0 V because there is no emit-
ter current through RE and, thus, no voltage drop.
Fault 4: Emitter Internally Open
Again, the transistor is nonconducting, so IC  0 A
and VC  VCC  10 V. Just as for the case of the open RE and the internally open base, the
voltage divider produces 3.2 V at the base. The voltage at the external emitter lead is 0 V
because that point is open and connected to ground through RE. Notice that Faults 3 and 4
produce identical symptoms.
Fault 5: Collector Internally Open
Since there is an internal open in the transistor col-
lector, there is no IC and, therefore, VC  VCC  10 V. In this situation, the voltage divider is
loaded by RE through the forward-biased BE junction, as shown by the approximate equiva-
lent circuit in Figure 5–26. The base voltage and emitter voltage are determined as follows:

nonconducting. Obviously, if RC is open, there can be no collector current. In this situation,
the equivalent bias circuit is the same as for Fault 5, as illustrated in Figure 5–26.
Therefore, VB  1.11 V and since the BE junction is forward-biased,
When a voltmeter is connected to the collector to measure VC, a current path is provided
through the internal impedance of the meter and the BC junction is forward-biased by VB.
Therefore,
Again the forward drops across the internal transistor junctions depend on the current.
We are using 0.7 V for illustration, but the forward drops may be much less.
Fault 7: Resistor R2 Open
When R2 opens as shown in Figure 5–27(b), the base voltage
and base current increase from their normal values because the voltage divider is now
formed by
and
In this case, the base voltage is determined by the emitter
voltage
First, verify whether the transistor is in saturation or not. The collector saturation cur-
rent and the base current required to produce saturation are determined as follows (assum-
ing VCE(sat)  0.2 V):
Assuming the transistor is saturated, the maximum base current is determined.
Since this amount of base current is more than enough to produce saturation, the transistor
is definitely saturated. Therefore, VE, VB, and VC are as follows:

Application Activity: Temperature to Voltage Conversion
The focus of this Application Activity is a temperature-sensing circuit that converts the tem-
perature of a liquid to a proportional voltage for the purpose of maintaining the temperature
of the liquid within a specified range. Figure 5–28 illustrates the temperature-control system.
The temperature sensor is a thermistor, which is a device whose resistance changes with
temperature. The thermistor is connected to a transistor circuit that is biased for linear opera-
tion. The output voltage of the circuit is proportional to the thermistor resistance and thus to
the temperature of the liquid in the tank. The output voltage goes to an interface circuit that

ature of the liquid is below a set value, the fuel is increased and if it is above that value, the
fuel is decreased. The temperature is to be maintained at
Designing the Circuit
Circuit Configuration
A voltage-divider biased linear amplifier is used for the temperature-
to-voltage conversion. The thermistor is used as one of the resistors in the voltage-divider
bias. This thermistor has a positive temperature coefficient so, if the temperature increases,
the resistance of the thermistor increases and if the temperature decreases, the resistance
decreases. The base voltage changes proportionally to the change in thermistor resistance.
The output voltage is inversely proportional to the base voltage, so as the temperature goes
up, the output voltage decreases and reduces the fuel flow to the burner. As the temperature
goes down, the output voltage increases and allows more fuel to the burner.
Components
As shown in Figure 5–29(a), the circuit is implemented with a 2N3904
transistor, three resistors and a thermistor with the values shown, and a +9 V dc source.

Wind energy, like solar energy, is a major renewable resource. Wind is actually a product
of solar energy because differences in earth temperatures result in the movement of air.
Wind turbines harvest energy from the wind and may be used as small single units to
supply an individual home or wind farms where tens to hundreds of large units harvest
wind energy and convert it to electricity.
Two key elements in a wind turbine are the blades and the ac generator. In many wind
turbines, electronic circuits sense the wind direction and speed and adjust the orientation
and pitch of the blades to maximize the energy collected from the wind. The generator
produces a varying ac voltage that depends on the rotational speed of the blades due to
the wind. Since the frequency and amplitude of a generator output varies with wind
speed, the ac output is converted to dc and then back to 60 Hz ac with an inverter. Like a
solar power system, the energy can be stored in batteries using a charge controller for
smaller applications, or the energy can be connected directly to the grid for large-scale
applications.
Figure GA5–1 shows a basic diagram of a horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT) for
small power applications, such as home use. A typical wind turbine has three blades and
is mounted on a very high support tower. Wind energy is converted to mechanical energy
by the rotating blades. As shown in Figure GA5–1, the blade rotation is applied to a shaft,
which is geared up to turn the ac generator shaft at a higher rate than the blades are rotat-
ing. The generator rotation produces an ac voltage output with a frequency that depends
on the rate of rotation. Since it is a variable frequency and amplitude output, as previ-
ously mentioned, the ac is converted to dc by the ac-to-dc converter. The dc is sent to a
charge controller that charges the storage batteries. The battery output is applied to an
inverter where it is converted to a 120 V, 60 Hz ac voltage for individual consumer use.
The wind vane and yaw bearing assembly are used on small turbines to keep the blades
pointed into the wind. An anemometer senses the wind speed in order to brake the blades
when the wind reaches a specified speed. This prevents mechanical damage if the wind
speed is too high.

The AC-to-DC Converter
Because of the variable frequency of the ac from the generator, it must first be converted
to dc for the charge controller. A rectifier and regulator are used for the conversion, as 
illustrated in Figure GA5–2. The ac voltage from the generator varies in amplitude and
frequency as a function of wind speed. The ac-to-dc converter changes the varying ac to 
a varying dc voltage, which is then applied to a voltage regulator to produce a specified
constant dc voltage, as shown.
Large-Scale Wind Turbines
Figure GA5–3 is a horizontal axis grid-tie turbine, which is the most common configura-
tion for commercial wind farm applications. The wind direction sensor sends a signal to
the control electronics so the yaw motor can keep the turbine pointing into the wind. The
wind speed sensor sends a signal to the control electronics so the pitch of the blades can
be adjusted for maximum efficiency. Also, when the wind exceeds a specified speed, the
control electronics activates the brakes to reduce or stop rotation of the blades, preventing
damage to the unit.

Factor determining the available power in the wind.
For large wind turbines (above 100 kW–150 kW) the voltage generated is usually 690 V
three-phase ac. The output goes to a transformer usually located in the tower or near its
base and is stepped up to thousands of volts depending on the requirements of the local
electrical grid.
Power in the Wind
The amount of power available in the wind can be calculated using the following formula:
In the formula, 
is the density of the air, A is the area swept by the blades, and v is the
velocity (speed) of the wind. Note that the power is dependent on the length of the blades,
r, and the cube of the wind speed, v3. Since A 

Betz Law
This law states that the theoretical limit of the amount of power that can be
extracted from the wind is 59% if all conditions are perfect. This limiting factor was de-
veloped by Albert Betz in 1926. In practice, 20% to 40% can normally be expected.
Wind Power Curve
A wind power curve shows the amount of power that can be extracted over a range of
wind speeds (velocities) for specific turbines. Wind power curves will vary from one type
of turbine to another. Figure GA5–5 shows a typical curve. The cut-in speed is the wind
speed at which the blades begin to turn. The start-up speed is the wind speed at which the
blades are moving fast enough to cause the generator to produce electricity. The start-up
speed is slightly higher than the cut-in speed. The maximum power output is the peak
power that the turbine can produce. For this example curve, the maximum power output
is approximately 200 kW at a wind speed of approximately 28 mph.
To limit the rotational speed of the blades above the maximum power output (MPO) point in
order to prevent damage to the machine, a process called furling is used. Ideally, the curve is
kept as level as possible as shown by the dashed portion of the curve in Figure GA5–5.
However, in practice, the power decreases above that point, once the furling process is acti-
vated. Furling can be accomplished by changing the pitch of the blades or turning the entire
turbine away from the wind direction slightly under direction of the control electronics. Also,
when the wind reaches a predetermined maximum, the turbine can be completely shut down.
For example, the curve shows this turbine being shut down at 45 mph.
the available power in the wind will be increased by four times (22  4). If the wind 
velocity doubles, the available power in the wind is increased by eight times (23  8). Of
course, a turbine cannot convert all of the available wind power into mechanical power to
turn the generator. In fact, most practical turbines can convert less than 50% of the wind
power. Figure GA5–4 illustrates the factors that affect the amount of power that can be
extracted from the wind.

INTRODUCTION
The things you learned about biasing a transistor in Chapter 5
are now applied in this chapter where bipolar junction
transistor (BJT) circuits are used as small-signal amplifiers.
The term small-signal refers to the use of signals that take up
a relatively small percentage of an amplifier’s operational
range. Additionally, you will learn how to reduce an ampli-
fier to an equivalent dc and ac circuit for easier analysis, and
you will learn about multistage amplifiers. The differential
amplifier is also covered.

In the previous chapters, dc quantities were identified by nonitalic uppercase (capital) sub-
scripts such as IC, IE, VC, and VCE. Lowercase italic subscripts are used to indicate ac quan-
tities of rms, peak, and peak-to-peak currents and voltages: for example, Ic, Ie, Ib, Vc, and
Vce (rms values are assumed unless otherwise stated). Instantaneous quantities are repre-
sented by both lowercase letters and subscripts such as ic, ie, ib, and vce. Figure 6–1 illus-

AMPLIFIER OPERATION
The biasing of a transistor is purely a dc operation. The purpose of biasing is to estab-
lish a Q-point about which variations in current and voltage can occur in response to 
an ac input signal. In applications where small signal voltages must be amplified—
such as from an antenna or a microphone—variations about the Q-point are relatively
small. Amplifiers designed to handle these small ac signals are often referred to as
small-signal amplifiers.
After completing this section, you should be able to
❏Describe amplifier operation
❏Identify ac quantities
◆Distinguish ac quantities from dc quantities
❏Discuss the operation of a linear amplifier
◆Define phase inversion
◆Graphically illustrate amplifier operation
◆Analyze ac load line operation
The American inventor Lee De
Forest (1873–1961) is one of
several pioneers of radio
development. De Forest
experimented with receiving long-
distance radio signals and in 1907
patented an electronic device
named the audion, which was the
first amplifier. De Forest’s new
three-electrode (triode) vacuum
tube boosted radio waves as they
were received and made possible
what was then called “wireless
telephony,” which allowed the
human voice, music, or any
broadcast signal to be heard.
H I S T O R Y  N O T E
In addition to currents and voltages, resistances often have different values when a cir-
cuit is analyzed from an ac viewpoint as opposed to a dc viewpoint. Lowercase subscripts
are used to identify ac resistance values. For example, Rc is the ac collector resistance, and
RC is the dc collector resistance. You will see the need for this distinction later. Resistance
values internal to the transistor use a lowercase 
to show it is an ac resistance. An exam-
ple is the internal ac emitter resistance, r¿e.

The Linear Amplifier
A linear amplifier provides amplification of a signal without any distortion so that the out-
put signal is an exact amplified replica of the input signal. A voltage-divider biased tran-
sistor with a sinusoidal ac source capacitively coupled to the base through C1 and a load
capacitively coupled to the collector through C2 is shown in Figure 6–2. The coupling ca-
pacitors block dc and thus prevent the internal source resistance, Rs, and the load resist-
ance, RL, from changing the dc bias voltages at the base and collector. The capacitors
ideally appear as shorts to the signal voltage. The sinusoidal source voltage causes the base
voltage to vary sinusoidally above and below its dc bias level, VBQ. The resulting variation
in base current produces a larger variation in collector current because of the current gain
of the transistor.

As the sinusoidal collector current increases, the collector voltage decreases. The col-

The sinusoidal collector-to-emitter voltage varies above and below its Q-point value,

out of phase with the base voltage, as illustrated in Figure 6–2. A transistor
always produces a phase inversion between the base voltage and the collector voltage.
A Graphical Picture
The operation just described can be illustrated graphically on the
ac load line, as shown in Figure 6–3. The sinusoidal voltage at the base produces a base
current that varies above and below the Q-point on the ac load line, as shown by the arrows.

Lines projected from the peaks of the base current, across to the IC axis, and down to the
VCE axis, indicate the peak-to-peak variations of the collector current and collector-to-
emitter voltage, as shown. The ac load line differs from the dc load line because the effec-
tive ac collector resistance is RL in parallel with RC and is less than the dc collector resist-
ance RC alone. This difference between the dc and the ac load lines is covered in Chapter 7
in relation to power amplifiers.

TRANSISTOR AC MODELS
To visualize the operation of a transistor in an amplifier circuit, it is often useful to 
represent the device by a model circuit. A transistor model circuit uses various internal
transistor parameters to represent its operation. Transistor models are described in this
section based on resistance or r parameters. Another system of parameters, called h
parameters, is briefly described.

r-Parameter Transistor Model
An r-parameter model for a BJT is shown in Figure 6–5(a). For most general analysis
work, it can be simplified as follows: The effect of the ac base resistance 
is usually
small enough to neglect, so it can be replaced by a short. The ac collector resistance 
is
usually several hundred kilohms and can be replaced by an open. The resulting simplified
r-parameter equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 6–5(b).
The interpretation of this model circuit in terms of a transistor’s ac operation is as
follows: A resistance 
appears between the emitter and base terminals. This is the
resistance “seen” looking into the emitter of a forward-biased transistor. The collector
effectively acts as a dependent current source of 
or, equivalently, 
represented
by the diamond-shaped symbol. These factors are shown with a transistor symbol in
Figure 6–6.

Comparison of the AC Beta (

For a typical transistor, a graph of IC versus IB is nonlinear, as shown in Figure 6–7(a). If
you pick a Q-point on the curve and cause the base current to vary an amount 
then the
collector current will vary an amount 
as shown in part (b). At different points on the
nonlinear curve, the ratio 
will be different, and it may also differ from the IC IB
ratio at the Q-point. Since 
the values of these two quan-
tities can differ slightly.

THE COMMON-EMITTER AMPLIFIER
As you have learned, a BJT can be represented in an ac model circuit. Three amplifier
configurations are the common-emitter, the common-base, and the common-collector.
The common-emitter (CE) configuration has the emitter as the common terminal, or
ground, to an ac signal. CE amplifiers exhibit high voltage gain and high current gain.
The common-collector and common-base configurations are covered in the sections
6–4 and 6–5.
After completing this section, you should be able to

Figure 6–8 shows a common-emitter amplifier with voltage-divider bias and coupling
capacitors C1 and C3 on the input and output and a bypass capacitor, C2, from emitter to
ground. The input signal, Vin, is capacitively coupled to the base terminal, the output sig-
nal, Vout, is capacitively coupled from the collector to the load. The amplified output is
out of phase with the input. Because the ac signal is applied to the base terminal as

THE COMMON-EMITTER AMPLIFIER

the input and taken from the collector terminal as the output, the emitter is common to both
the input and output signals. There is no signal at the emitter because the bypass capacitor
effectively shorts the emitter to ground at the signal frequency. All amplifiers have a com-
bination of both ac and dc operation, which must be considered, but keep in mind that the
common-emitter designation refers to the ac operation.
Phase Inversion
The output signal is 
out of phase with the input signal. As the
input signal voltage changes, it causes the ac base current to change, resulting in a change
in the collector current from its Q-point value. If the base current increases, the collector
current increases above its Q-point value, causing an increase in the voltage drop across
RC. This increase in the voltage across RC means that the voltage at the collector decreases
from its Q-point. So, any change in input signal voltage results in an opposite change in
collector signal voltage, which is a phase inversion.
DC Analysis
To analyze the amplifier in Figure 6–8, the dc bias values must first be determined. To do
this, a dc equivalent circuit is developed by removing the coupling and bypass capacitors
because they appear open as far as the dc bias is concerned. This also removes the load
resistor and signal source. The dc equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 6–9.
Theveninizing the bias circuit and applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the base-emitter

AC Analysis
To analyze the ac signal operation of an amplifier, an ac equivalent circuit is developed as
follows:
1. The capacitors C1, C2, and C3 are replaced by effective shorts because their values
are selected so that XC is negligible at the signal frequency and can be considered
to be 
2. The dc source is replaced by ground.
A dc voltage source has an internal resistance of near 
because it holds a constant volt-
age independent of the load (within limits); no ac voltage can be developed across it so it
appears as an ac short. This is why a dc source is called an ac ground.
The ac equivalent circuit for the common-emitter amplifier in Figure 6–8 is shown in
Figure 6–10(a). Notice that both RC and R1 have one end connected to ac ground (red) be-
cause, in the actual circuit, they are connected to VCC which is, in effect, ac ground.

In ac analysis, the ac ground and the actual ground are treated as the same point electri-
cally. The amplifier in Figure 6–8 is called a common-emitter amplifier because the bypass
capacitor C2 keeps the emitter at ac ground. Ground is the common point in the circuit.
Signal (AC) Voltage at the Base
An ac voltage source, Vs, is shown connected to the
input in Figure 6–10(b). If the internal resistance of the ac source is 
then all of the
source voltage appears at the base terminal. If, however, the ac source has a nonzero inter-
nal resistance, then three factors must be taken into account in determining the actual sig-
nal voltage at the base. These are the source resistance (Rs), the bias resistance
and the ac input resistance at the base of the transistor 
This is illustrated in
Figure 6–11(a) and is simplified by combining R1, R2, and Rin(base) in parallel to get the
total input resistance, Rin(tot), which is the resistance “seen” by an ac source connected to
the input, as shown in Figure 6–11(b). A high value of input resistance is desirable so that
the amplifier will not excessively load the signal source. This is opposite to the require-
ment for a stable Q-point, which requires smaller resistors. The conflicting requirement for
high input resistance and stable biasing is but one of the many trade-offs that must be con-
sidered when choosing components for a circuit. The total input resistance is expressed by
the following formula:

Next, determine the total input resistance viewed from the source.
The source voltage is divided down by Rs and Rin(tot), so the signal voltage at the

As you can see, there is significant attenuation (reduction) of the source voltage due
to the source resistance and amplifier’s input resistance combining to act as a voltage
divider.

Equation 6–5 is the voltage gain from base to collector. To get the overall gain of the
amplifier from the source voltage to collector, the attenuation of the input circuit must be
included.
Attenuation is the reduction in signal voltage as it passes through a circuit and corre-
sponds to a gain of less than 1. For example, if the signal amplitude is reduced by half, the
attenuation is 2, which can be expressed as a gain of 0.5 because gain is the reciprocal of
attenuation. Suppose a source produces a 10 mV input signal and the source resistance
combined with the load resistance results in a 2 mV output signal. In this case, the attenu-
ation is 10 mV 2 mV  5. That is, the input signal is reduced by a factor of 5. This can be

Effect of the Emitter Bypass Capacitor on Voltage Gain
The emitter bypass capac-
itor, which is C2 in Figure 6–8, provides an effective short to the ac signal around the
emitter resistor, thus keeping the emitter at ac ground, as you have seen. With the bypass
capacitor, the gain of a given amplifier is maximum and equal to 
The value of the bypass capacitor must be large enough so that its reactance over the
frequency range of the amplifier is very small (ideally 
) compared to RE. A good
rule-of-thumb is that the capacitive reactance, XC, of the bypass capacitor should be at
least 10 times smaller than RE at the minimum frequency for which the amplifier must
operate.

Assume that the amplifier in Figure 6–15 has a voltage gain from base to collector of Av

the source resistance and total input resistance of the amplifier acting as a voltage divider
and can be expressed as

Effect of a Load on the Voltage Gain
A load is the amount of current drawn from the
output of an amplifier or other circuit through a load resistance. When a resistor, RL, is con-
nected to the output through the coupling capacitor C3, as shown in Figure 6–17(a), it cre-
ates a load on the circuit. The collector resistance at the signal frequency is effectively RC
in parallel with RL. Remember, the upper end of RC is effectively at ac ground. The ac
equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 6–17(b). The total ac collector resistance is

Stability of the Voltage Gain
Stability is a measure of how well an amplifier maintains its design values over changes in
temperature or for a transistor with a different 
Although bypassing RE does produce the
maximum voltage gain, there is a stability problem because the ac voltage gain is depend-
ent on 
Also, 
depends on IE and on temperature. This causes the
gain to be unstable over changes in temperature because when 
increases, the gain de-
creases and vice versa.

Swamping re to Stabilize the Voltage Gain
Swamping is a method used to minimize
the effect of 
without reducing the voltage gain to its minimum value. This method
“swamps” out the effect of 
on the voltage gain. Swamping is, in effect, a compromise
between having a bypass capacitor across RE and having no bypass capacitor at all.
In a swamped amplifier, RE is partially bypassed so that a reasonable gain can be
achieved, and the effect of 
on the gain is greatly reduced or eliminated. The total 
external emitter resistance, RE, is formed with two separate emitter resistors, RE1 and
RE2, as indicated in Figure 6–18. One of the resistors, RE2, is bypassed and the other 
is not.
Both resistors (RE1  RE2) affect the dc bias while only RE1 affects the ac voltage gain.

Input Resistance
The emitter-follower is characterized by a high input resistance; this is what makes it a
useful circuit. Because of the high input resistance, it can be used as a buffer to minimize
loading effects when a circuit is driving a low-resistance load. The derivation of the input
resistance, looking in at the base of the common-collector amplifier, is similar to that for
the common-emitter amplifier. In a common-collector circuit, however, the emitter resistor
is never bypassed because the output is taken across Re, which is RE in parallel with RL.

One way to boost input resistance is to use a Darlington pair, as shown in Figure 6–28.
The collectors of two transistors are connected, and the emitter of the first drives the base
of the second. This configuration achieves 
multiplication as shown in the following
steps. The emitter current of the first transistor is

known as a complementary Darlington or a compound transistor. The current gain is
about the same as in the Darlington pair, as illustrated. The difference is that the Q2 base
current is the Q1 collector current instead of emitter current, as in the Darlington
arrangement.
An advantage of the Sziklai pair, compared to the Darlington, is that it takes less
voltage to turn it on because only one barrier potential has to be overcome. A Sziklai
pair is sometimes used in conjunction with a Darlington pair as the output stage of
power amplifiers. In this case, the output power transistors are both the same type (two
npn or two pnp transistors). This makes it easier to obtain exact matches of the output
transistors, resulting in improved thermal stability and better sound quality in audio
applications.

THE COMMON-BASE AMPLIFIER
The common-base (CB) amplifier provides high voltage gain with a maximum
current gain of 1. Since it has a low input resistance, the CB amplifier is the most appro-

outputs.

A typical common-base amplifier is shown in Figure 6–31. The base is the common

resistor.

Av1 = 25, Av2 = 5, and Av3 = 12.
 A¿v(dB) = 20.0 dB + 23.5 dB + 26.0 dB = 69.5 dB
 Av3(dB) = 20 log 20 = 26.0 dB

 Av1(dB) = 20 log 10 = 20.0 dB
 A¿v = Av1Av2Av3 = (10)(15)(20) = 3000
Loading Effects
In determining the voltage gain of the first stage, you must consider the
loading effect of the second stage. Because the coupling capacitor C3 effectively appears
as a short at the signal frequency, the total input resistance of the second stage presents an
ac load to the first stage.
Looking from the collector of Q1, the two biasing resistors in the second stage, R5
and R6, appear in parallel with the input resistance at the base of Q2. In other words, the
signal at the collector of Q1 “sees” R3, R5, R6, and Rin(base2) of the second stage all in
parallel to ac ground. Thus, the effective ac collector resistance of Q1 is the total of all
these resistances in parallel, as Figure 6–35 illustrates. The voltage gain of the first
stage is reduced by the loading of the second stage because the effective ac collector
resistance of the first stage is less than the actual value of its collector resistor, R3.
Remember that Av = Rc>r¿e.

BJT AMPLIFIERS
Direct-Coupled Multistage Amplifiers
A basic two-stage, direct-coupled amplifier is shown in Figure 6–36. Notice that there are
no coupling or bypass capacitors in this circuit. The dc collector voltage of the first stage
provides the base-bias voltage for the second stage. Because of the direct coupling, this
type of amplifier has a better low-frequency response than the capacitively coupled type in
which the reactance of coupling and bypass capacitors at very low frequencies may be-
come excessive. The increased reactance of capacitors at lower frequencies produces gain
reduction in capacitively coupled amplifiers.
Direct-coupled amplifiers can be used to amplify low frequencies all the way down to dc
(0 Hz) without loss of voltage gain because there are no capacitive reactances in the circuit.
The disadvantage of direct-coupled amplifiers, on the other hand, is that small changes in the
dc bias voltages from temperature effects or power-supply variation are amplified by the suc-
ceeding stages, which can result in a significant drift in the dc levels throughout the circuit.

THE DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER
A differential amplifier is an amplifier that produces outputs that are a function of the
difference between two input voltages. The differential amplifier has two basic modes of
operation: differential (in which the two inputs are different) and common mode (in
which the two inputs are the same). The differential amplifier is important in operational
amplifiers, which are covered beginning in Chapter 12.

The following discussion is in relation to Figure 6–38 and consists of a basic dc analy-
sis of the diff-amp’s operation. First, when both inputs are grounded (0 V), the emitters are
at 
as indicated in Figure 6–38(a). It is assumed that the transistors are identically
matched by careful process control during manufacturing so that their dc emitter currents
are the same when there is no input signal. Thus,
Since both emitter currents combine through RE,
where
Based on the approximation that 
Since both collector currents and both collector resistors are equal (when the input voltage
is zero),
This condition is illustrated in Figure 6–38(a).
Next, input 2 is left grounded, and a positive bias voltage is applied to input 1, as shown
in Figure 6–38(b). The positive voltage on the base of Q1 increases IC1 and raises the emit-
ter voltage to
This action reduces the forward bias (VBE) of Q2 because its base is held at 0 V (ground),
thus causing IC2 to decrease. The net result is that the increase in IC1 causes a decrease in
VC1, and the decrease in IC2 causes an increase in VC2, as shown.

Finally, input 1 is grounded and a positive bias voltage is applied to input 2, as shown in
Figure 6–38(c). The positive bias voltage causes Q2 to conduct more, thus increasing IC2.
Also, the emitter voltage is raised. This reduces the forward bias of Q1, since its base is
held at ground, and causes IC1 to decrease. The result is that the increase in IC2 produces a
decrease in VC2, and the decrease in IC1 causes VC1 to increase, as shown.
Modes of Signal Operation
Single-Ended Differential Input
When a diff-amp is operated with this input configu-
ration, one input is grounded and the signal voltage is applied only to the other input, as
shown in Figure 6–39. In the case where the signal voltage is applied to input 1 as in part
(a), an inverted, amplified signal voltage appears at output 1 as shown. Also, a signal volt-
age appears in phase at the emitter of Q1. Since the emitters of Q1 and Q2 are common, the
emitter signal becomes an input to Q2, which functions as a common-base amplifier. The
signal is amplified by Q2 and appears, noninverted, at output 2. This action is illustrated in
part (a).
In the case where the signal is applied to input 2 with input 1 grounded, as in Figure
6–39(b), an inverted, amplified signal voltage appears at output 2. In this situation, Q1 acts
as a common-base amplifier, and a noninverted, amplified signal appears at output 1.

Double-Ended Differential Inputs
In this input configuration, two opposite-polarity
(out-of-phase) signals are applied to the inputs, as shown in Figure 6–40(a). Each input af-
fects the outputs, as you will see in the following discussion.
Figure 6–40(b) shows the output signals due to the signal on input 1 acting alone as a
single-ended input. Figure 6–40(c) on page 308 shows the output signals due to the signal
on input 2 acting alone as a single-ended input. Notice in parts (b) and (c) that the signals
on output 1 are of the same polarity. The same is also true for output 2. By superimposing
both output 1 signals and both output 2 signals, you get the total output signals, as shown
in Figure 6–40(d).

Common-Mode Inputs
One of the most important aspects of the operation of a diff-
amp can be seen by considering the common-mode condition where two signal voltages
of the same phase, frequency, and amplitude are applied to the two inputs, as shown in
Figure 6–41(a). Again, by considering each input signal as acting alone, you can under-

Figure 6–41(b) shows the output signals due to the signal on only input 1, and Figure
6–41(c) shows the output signals due to the signal on only input 2. Notice that the corre-
sponding signals on output 1 are of the opposite polarity, and so are the ones on output 2.
When the input signals are applied to both inputs, the outputs are superimposed and they
cancel, resulting in a zero output voltage, as shown in Figure 6–41(d).
This action is called common-mode rejection. Its importance lies in the situation
where an unwanted signal appears commonly on both diff-amp inputs. Common-mode
rejection means that this unwanted signal will not appear on the outputs and distort the
desired signal. Common-mode signals (noise) generally are the result of the pick-up of
radiated energy on the input lines from adjacent lines, the 60 Hz power line, or other
sources.
Common-Mode Rejection Ratio
Desired signals appear on only one input or with opposite polarities on both input lines.
These desired signals are amplified and appear on the outputs as previously discussed.
Unwanted signals (noise) appearing with the same polarity on both input lines are essen-
tially cancelled by the diff-amp and do not appear on the outputs. The measure of an ampli-
fier’s ability to reject common-mode signals is a parameter called the CMRR (common-
mode rejection ratio).
Ideally, a diff-amp provides a very high gain for desired signals (single-ended or differ-
ential) and zero gain for common-mode signals. Practical diff-amps, however, do exhibit a
very small common-mode gain (usually much less than 1), while providing a high differ-
ential voltage gain (usually several thousand). The higher the differential gain with respect
to the common-mode gain, the better the performance of the diff-amp in terms of rejection
of common-mode signals. This suggests that a good measure of the diff-amp’s perform-
ance in rejecting unwanted common-mode signals is the ratio of the differential voltage
gain Av(d) to the common-mode gain, Acm. This ratio is the common-mode rejection ratio,
CMRR.
Equation 6–25
Equation 6–26
The higher the CMRR, the better. A very high value of CMRR means that the differen-
tial gain Av(d) is high and the common-mode gain Acm is low.
The CMRR is often expressed in decibels (dB) as
CMRR 

A certain diff-amp has a differential voltage gain of 2000 and a common-mode gain of
0.2. Determine the CMRR and express it in decibels.

Therefore,
Expressed in decibels,

BJT AMPLIFIERS
A CMRR of 10,000 means that the desired input signal (differential) is amplified
10,000 times more than the unwanted noise (common-mode). For example, if the ampli-
tudes of the differential input signal and the common-mode noise are equal, the desired
signal will appear on the output 10,000 times greater in amplitude than the noise. Thus, the
noise or interference has been essentially eliminated.
When you are faced with having to troubleshoot a circuit, the first thing you need is a
schematic with the proper dc and signal voltages labeled. You must know what the correct
voltages in the circuit should be before you can identify an incorrect voltage. Schematics
of some circuits are available with voltages indicated at certain points. If this is not the
case, you must use your knowledge of the circuit operation to determine the correct volt-
ages. Figure 6–42 is the schematic for the two-stage amplifier that was analyzed in Section
6–6. The correct voltages are indicated at each point. 
1. Distinguish between double-ended and single-ended differential inputs.
2. Define common-mode rejection.
3. For a given value of differential gain, does a higher CMRR result in a higher or lower
common-mode gain?

mined that the circuit did work properly and then failed. A visual check of the circuit board

wire clippings, or burned components turns up nothing. You conclude that the problem is
most likely a faulty component in the amplifier circuit or an open connection. Also, the dc
supply voltage may not be correct or may be missing.
Planning
You decide to use an oscilloscope to check the dc levels and the ac signals
(you prefer to use a DMM to measure the dc voltages) at certain test points. Also, you de-
cide to apply the half-splitting method to trace the voltages in the circuit and use an in-circuit
transistor tester if a transistor is suspected of being faulty.
Measurement
To determine the faulty component in a multistage amplifier, use the gen-
eral five-step troubleshooting procedure which is illustrated as follows.
Step 1: Perform a power check. Assume the dc supply voltage is correct as indicated
in Figure 6–43.
Step 2: Check the input and output voltages. Assume the measurements indicate that
the input signal voltage is correct. However, there is no output signal voltage
or the output signal voltage is much less than it should be, as shown by the di-
agram in Figure 6–43.

Step 3: Apply the half-splitting method of signal tracing. Check the voltages at the
output of the first stage. No signal voltage or a much less than normal signal
voltage indicates that the problem is in the first stage. An incorrect dc volt-
age also indicates a first-stage problem. If the signal voltage and the dc
voltage are correct at the output of the first stage, the problem is in the
second stage. After this check, you have narrowed the problem to one of the
two stages. This step is illustrated in Figure 6–44.
Step 4: Apply fault analysis. Focus on the faulty stage and determine the component
failure that can produce the incorrect output.
Symptom: DC voltages incorrect.
Likely faults: A failure of any resistor or the transistor will produce an incor-
rect dc bias voltage. A leaky bypass or coupling capacitor will also affect the
dc bias voltages. Further measurements in the stage are necessary to isolate
the faulty component.
Incorrect ac voltages and the most likely fault(s) are illustrated in Figure
6–45 as follows:
(a) Symptom 1: Signal voltage at output missing; dc voltage correct.
Symptom 2: Signal voltage at base missing; dc voltage correct.
Likely fault: Input coupling capacitor open. This prevents the signal
from getting to the base.
(b) Symptom: Correct signal at base but no output signal.
Likely fault: Transistor base open.
(c) Symptom: Signal voltage at output much less than normal; dc voltage
correct.
Likely fault: Bypass capacitor open.
Step 5: Replace or repair. With the power turned off, replace the defective compo-
nent or repair the defective connection. Turn on the power, and check for
proper operation.

Troubleshooting a faulty stage.
The two-stage amplifier in Figure 6–42 has malfunctioned. Specify the step-by-step
troubleshooting procedure for an assumed fault.
Solution
Assume there are no visual or other indications of a problem such as a charred resistor,
solder splash, wire clipping, broken connection, or extremely hot component. The
troubleshooting procedure for a certain fault scenario is as follows:
Step 1: There is power to the circuit as indicated by a correct VCC measurement.
Step 2: There is a verified input signal voltage, but no output signal voltage is
measured.
Step 3: The signal voltage and the dc voltage at the collector of Q1 are correct. This
means that the problem is in the second stage or the coupling capacitor C3
between the stages.
Step 4: The correct signal voltage and dc bias voltage are measured at the base of Q2.
This eliminates the possibility of a fault in C3 or the second stage bias circuit.
The collector of Q2 is at 10 V and there is no signal voltage. This measure-
ment, made directly on the transistor collector, indicates that either the collec-
tor is shorted to VCC or the transistor is internally open. It is unlikely that the
collector resistor R7 is shorted but to verify, turn off the power and use an
ohmmeter to check.
The possibility of a short is eliminated by the ohmmeter check. The other
possible faults are (a) transistor Q2 internally open or (b) emitter resistor or

get a large enough signal voltage swing to provide a maximum of 6 W to the speaker.

SUMMARY
Section 6–1
◆A small-signal amplifier uses only a small portion of its load line under signal conditions.
◆The ac load line differs from the dc load line because the effective ac collector resistance is less
than the dc collector resistance.
Section 6–2
◆r parameters are easily identifiable and applicable with a transistor’s circuit operation.
◆h parameters are important because manufacturers’ datasheets specify transistors using h parameters.
Section 6–3
◆A common-emitter amplifier has high voltage, current, and power gains, but a relatively low
input resistance.
◆Swamping is a method of stabilizing the voltage gain.
Section 6–4
◆A common-collector amplifier has high input resistance and high current gain, but its voltage
gain is approximately 1.
◆A Darlington pair provides beta multiplication for increased input resistance.
◆A common-collector amplifier is known as an emitter-follower.
Section 6–5
◆The common-base amplifier has a high voltage gain, but it has a very low input resistance and
its current gain is approximately 1.
◆Common-emitter, common-collector, and common-base amplifier configurations are summa-
rized in Table 6–4.

BJT AMPLIFIERS
Section 6–6
◆The total gain of a multistage amplifier is the product of the individual gains (sum of dB gains).
◆Single-stage amplifiers can be connected in sequence with capacitively-coupling and direct
coupling methods to form multistage amplifiers.
Section 6–7
◆A differential input voltage appears between the inverting and noninverting inputs of a differen-
tial amplifier.
◆In the differential mode, a diff-amp can be operated with single-ended or double-ended inputs.
◆In single-ended operation, there is a signal on one input and the other input is grounded.
◆In double-ended operation, two signals that are 180° out of phase are on the inputs.
◆Common-mode occurs when equal in-phase voltages are applied to both input terminals.

Vertical-Axis Turbines
In GreenTech Application 5, you learned about the horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT).
Now, a second major type, the vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) is introduced. In a VAWT,
the main rotor shaft is vertical instead of horizontal. An advantage of the VAWT is that the
generator, gears, and electronics can be placed near or at ground level instead of high on top
of the support tower as in a HAWT. This makes servicing much easier. Another advantage is
that a VAWT does not have to be pointed toward the wind, eliminating the need for yaw
mechanisms and circuits. It can capture wind from any direction. Also, VAWTs can be
placed closer together in wind farms than HAWTs because HAWTs exhibit a slowing effect
on the wind and VAWTs do not. Therefore, there is a limit on how close HAWTs can be to
each other. At this time, the horizontal turbine is much more widely used than the vertical
turbine. However, as improvements are made, the VAWT may become more competitive.
Darrieus or Eggbeater Turbine
Figure GA6–1 shows one type of VAWT called a
Darrieus, named after its inventer, but is more commonly known as an “eggbeater” turbine.

BJT AMPLIFIERS
VAWTs are difficult to mount on tall towers, so they are usually closer to the ground, thus
requiring less support structure than HAWTs. Since the wind speed tends to be less at
lower altitudes, the wind energy available is less than for a comparable-sized HAWT. Also,
air flow near the ground is usually more turbulent causing more stress on the turbine.
Notice that the block diagram is similar to that of the HAWT but is usually a bit simpler in
terms of the control electronics. Since there is no requirement for yawing the turbine to
move it into the wind, the electronics may simply detect the rotational speed of the shaft
and slow or stop the blades when the wind speed reaches a specified level.
In practice, the Darrieus VAWT is typically less efficient than the propeller-driven HAWT
because it does not handle variations in wind speed as effectively. Also, it is more diffi-
cult to protect the Darrieus from excessive wind speeds without completely shutting it
down. It also has a lower starting torque and does not self-start very well, so an auxiliary
starting motor may be required.
Giromill Turbine
This turbine is a subtype of the Darrieus. Instead of curved blades, the
giromill uses two or more straight airfoils (blades). A three-blade unit is shown in Figure
GA6–2. Although it is cheaper and easier to build than a standard Darrieus turbine, it is
less efficient, requires strong winds or a motor to start, and often cannot maintain a steady
rate of rotation. A variation of this type of turbine has variable pitch airfoils for improve-
ment of starting torque and reduction in torque pulsation due to uneven rotation rate.
Savonius Turbines
This is one of the simplest turbines but the least efficient.
Aerodynamically, Savonius turbines are drag-type turbines because, as they rotate, the
scoops have to move air out of the way whereas blade-type turbines work on the principle
of aerodynamic lift. One form of a two-scoop turbine is shown in Figure GA6–3; some-
times three or more scoops are used. The Savonius turbine is generally limited to small
power applications. In the figure, the rotation is clockwise with the wind direction as
shown.

Helical Wind Turbines
Another variation of the Darrieus, the helical VAWT, has blades
that are shaped in a twisted helical pattern. Some advantages are that the helical turbine
tends to rotate more quietly that other types of blade turbines. Also, the helical turbine
can withstand much higher wind speeds than other turbines and can begin rotation at
much lower wind speeds than other types of VAWTs. A photo of one type of helical con-
figuration is shown in Figure GA6–4(a). Other forms of helix turbines are also used, as
shown in part (b).

INTRODUCTION
Power amplifiers are large-signal amplifiers. This generally
means that a much larger portion of the load line is used
during signal operation than in a small-signal amplifier. In
this chapter, we will cover four classes of power amplifiers:
class A, class B, class AB, and class C. These amplifier classi-
fications are based on the percentage of the input cycle for
which the amplifier operates in its linear region. Each class
has a unique circuit configuration because of the way it must
be operated. The emphasis is on power amplification.
Power amplifiers are normally used as the final stage of a
communications receiver or transmitter to provide signal
power to speakers or to a transmitting antenna. BJTs are
used to illustrate power amplifier principles.

◆
POWER AMPLIFIERS
In a small-signal amplifier, the ac signal moves over a small percentage of the total ac
load line. When the output signal is larger and approaches the limits of the ac load line, the
amplifier is a large-signal type. Both large-signal and small-signal amplifiers are consid-
ered to be class A if they operate in the linear region at all times, as illustrated in Figure 7–1.
Class A power amplifiers are large-signal amplifiers with the objective of providing power
(rather than voltage) to a load. As a rule of thumb, an amplifier may be considered to be a
power amplifier if it is rated for more than 1 W and it is necessary to consider the problem
of heat dissipation in components.

THE CLASS A POWER AMPLIFIER
When an amplifier is biased such that it always operates in the linear region where the
output signal is an amplified replica of the input signal, it is a class A amplifier. The
discussion of amplifiers in the previous chapters apply to class A operation. Power ampli-
fiers are those amplifiers that have the objective of delivering power to a load. This means
that components must be considered in terms of their ability to dissipate heat.
After completing this section, you should be able to
❏Explain and analyze the operation of class A amplifiers
❏Discuss transistor heat dissipation
◆Describe the purpose of a heat sink
❏Discuss the importance of a centered Q-point
◆Describe the relationship of the dc and ac load lines with the Q-point
◆Describe the effects of a noncentered Q-point on the output waveform
❏Determine power gain
❏Define dc quiescent power
❏Discuss and determine output signal power
❏Define and determine the efficiency of a power amplifier
Heat Dissipation
Power transistors (and other power devices) must dissipate a large amount of internally
generated heat. For BJT power transistors, the collector terminal is the critical junction; for
this reason, the transistor’s case is always connected to the collector terminal. The case of
all power transistors is designed to provide a large contact area between it and an external
heat sink. Heat from the transistor flows through the case to the heat sink and then dissi-
pates in the surrounding air. Heat sinks vary in size, number of fins, and type of material.
Their size depends on the heat dissipation requirement and the maximum ambient temper-
ature in which the transistor is to operate. In high-power applications (a few hundred
watts), a cooling fan may be necessary.
Centered Q-Point
Recall that the dc and ac load lines intersect at the Q-point. When the Q-point is at the cen-
ter of the ac load line, a maximum class A signal can be obtained. You can see this concept
by examining the graph of the load line for a given amplifier in Figure 7–2(a). This graph
shows the ac load line with the Q-point at its center. The collector current can vary from its

THE CLASS A POWER AMPLIFIER
◆

Q-point value, ICQ, up to its saturation value, Ic(sat), and down to its cutoff value of zero.
Likewise, the collector-to-emitter voltage can swing from its Q-point value, VCEQ, up to its
cutoff value, Vce(cutoff ), and down to its saturation value of near zero. This operation is in-
dicated in Figure 7–2(b). The peak value of the collector current equals ICQ, and the peak
value of the collector-to-emitter voltage equals VCEQ in this case. This signal is the maxi-
mum that can be obtained from the class A amplifier. Actually, the output cannot quite
reach saturation or cutoff, so the practical maximum is slightly less.
If the Q-point is not centered on the ac load line, the output signal is limited. Figure 7–3
shows an ac load line with the Q-point moved away from center toward cutoff. The output
variation is limited by cutoff in this case. The collector current can only swing down to near
zero and an equal amount above ICQ. The collector-to-emitter voltage can only swing up to its

the amplifier is driven any further than this, it will “clip” at cutoff, as shown in Figure 7–3(b).
Figure 7–4 shows an ac load line with the Q-point moved away from center toward sat-
uration. In this case, the output variation is limited by saturation. The collector current can
only swing up to near saturation and an equal amount below ICQ. The collector-to-emitter
voltage can only swing down to its saturation value and an equal amount above VCEQ. This
situation is illustrated in Figure 7–4(a). If the amplifier is driven any further, it will “clip”
at saturation, as shown in Figure 7–4(b).
Power Gain
A power amplifier delivers power to a load. The power gain of an amplifier is the ratio of
the output power (power delivered to the load) to the input power. In general, power gain is
where Ap is the power gain, PL is signal power delivered to the load, and Pin is signal power
delivered to the amplifier.
The power gain can be computed by any of several formulas, depending on what is
known. Frequently, the easiest way to obtain power gain is from input resistance, load re-
sistance, and voltage gain. To see how this is done, recall that power can be expressed in
terms of voltage and resistance as
For ac power, the voltage is expressed as rms. The output power delivered to the load is
The input power delivered to the amplifier is

Since VL Vin = Av,

Recall from Chapter 6 that for a voltage-divider biased amplifier,
and that for a CE or CC amplifier,
Equation 7–2 shows that the power gain of an amplifier is the voltage gain squared
times the ratio of the input resistance to the output load resistance. The formula can be
applied to any amplifier. For example, assume a common-collector (CC) amplifier has an
input resistance of 
and a load resistance of 
Since a CC amplifier has a voltage
gain of approximately 1, the power gain is
For a CC amplifier, Ap is just the ratio of the input resistance to the output load resistance.

Equation 7–2
The only way a class A power amplifier can supply power to a load is to maintain a qui-
escent current that is at least as large as the peak current requirement for the load current.
A signal will not increase the power dissipated by the transistor but actually causes less
total power to be dissipated. The dc quiescent power, given in Equation 7–3, is the maxi-
mum power that a class A amplifier must handle. The transistor’s power rating must exceed
this value.
Output Power
In general, the output signal power is the product of the rms load current and the rms
load voltage. The maximum unclipped ac signal occurs when the Q-point is centered on
the ac load line. For a CE amplifier with a centered Q-point, the maximum peak voltage
swing is
The rms value is 0.707Vc(max).
The maximum peak current swing is
The rms value is 0.707Ic(max).

Efficiency
The efficiency of any amplifier is the ratio of the output signal power supplied to a load to
the total power from the dc supply. The maximum output signal power that can be obtained
is given by Equation 7–4. The average power supply current, ICC, is equal to ICQ and the
supply voltage is at least 2VCEQ. Therefore, the total dc power is
The maximum efficiency, 
of a capacitively coupled class A amplifier is
The maximum efficiency of a capacitively coupled class A amplifier cannot be higher
than 0.25, or 25%, and, in practice, is usually considerably less (about 10%). Although the
efficiency can be made higher by transformer coupling the signal to the load, there are
drawbacks to transformer coupling. These drawbacks include the size and cost of trans-
formers as well as potential distortion problems when the transformer core begins to satu-
rate. In general, the low efficiency of class A amplifiers limits their usefulness to small
power applications that require usually less than 1 W.

THE CLASS B AND CLASS AB PUSH-PULL AMPLIFIERS
When an amplifier is biased at cutoff so that it operates in the linear region for 
of
the input cycle and is in cutoff for 
it is a class B amplifier. Class AB amplifiers are
biased to conduct for slightly more than 
The primary advantage of a class B or
class AB amplifier over a class A amplifier is that either one is more efficient than a class
A amplifier; you can get more output power for a given amount of input power. A disad-
vantage of class B or class AB is that it is more difficult to implement the circuit in order
to get a linear reproduction of the input waveform. The term push-pull refers to a com-
mon type of class B or class AB amplifier circuit in which two transistors are used on al-
ternating half-cycles to reproduce the input waveform at the output.

The Q-Point Is at Cutoff
The class B amplifier is biased at the cutoff point so that
It is brought out of cutoff and operates in its linear region
when the input signal drives the transistor into conduction. This is illustrated in Figure 7–7
with an emitter-follower circuit where the output is not a replica of the input.
ICQ = 0 and VCEQ = VCE(cutoff).
Class B Push-Pull Operation
As you can see, the circuit in Figure 7–7 only conducts for the positive half of the cycle. To
amplify the entire cycle, it is necessary to add a second class B amplifier that operates on
the negative half of the cycle. The combination of two class B amplifiers working together
is called push-pull operation.

POWER AMPLIFIERS
There are two common approaches for using push-pull amplifiers to reproduce the 
entire waveform. The first approach uses transformer coupling. The second uses two
complementary symmetry transistors; these are a matching pair of npn/pnp BJTs.
Transformer Coupling
Transformer coupling is illustrated in Figure 7–8. The input
transformer has a center-tapped secondary that is connected to ground, producing phase in-
version of one side with respect to the other. The input transformer thus converts the input
signal to two out-of-phase signals for the transistors. Notice that both transistors are npn
types. Because of the signal inversion, Q1 will conduct on the positive part of the cycle and
Q2 will conduct on the negative part. The output transformer combines the signals by per-
mitting current in both directions, even though one transistor is always cut off. The positive
power supply signal is connected to the center tap of the output transformer.

Complementary Symmetry Transistors
Figure 7–9 shows one of the most popular
types of push-pull class B amplifiers using two emitter-followers and both positive and
negative power supplies. This is a complementary amplifier because one emitter-follower
uses an npn transistor and the other a pnp, which conduct on opposite alternations of the
input cycle. Notice that there is no dc base bias voltage (VB  0). Thus, only the signal
voltage drives the transistors into conduction. Transistor Q1 conducts during the positive
half of the input cycle, and Q2 conducts during the negative half.

Crossover Distortion
When the dc base voltage is zero, both transistors are off and the
input signal voltage must exceed VBE before a transistor conducts. Because of this, there is
a time interval between the positive and negative alternations of the input when neither
transistor is conducting, as shown in Figure 7–10. The resulting distortion in the output
waveform is called crossover distortion.
Biasing the Push-Pull Amplifier for Class AB Operation
To overcome crossover distortion, the biasing is adjusted to just overcome the VBE of the
transistors; this results in a modified form of operation called class AB. In class AB oper-
ation, the push-pull stages are biased into slight conduction, even when no input signal is
present. This can be done with a voltage-divider and diode arrangement, as shown in
Figure 7–11. When the diode characteristics of D1 and D2 are closely matched to the char-
acteristics of the transistor base-emitter junctions, the current in the diodes and the current
in the transistors are the same; this is called a current mirror. This current mirror pro-
duces the desired class AB operation and eliminates crossover distortion.
In the bias path of the circuit in Figure 7–11, R1 and R2 are of equal value, as are the
positive and negative supply voltages. This forces the voltage at point A (between the
diodes) to equal 0 V and eliminates the need for an input coupling capacitor. The dc volt-
age on the output is also 0 V. Assuming that both diodes and both complementary transis-
tors are identical, the drop across D1 equals the VBE of Q1, and the drop across D2 equals

the VBE of Q2. Since they are matched, the diode current will be the same as ICQ. The diode
current and ICQ can be found by applying Ohm’s law to either R1 or R2 as follows:
This small current required of class AB operation eliminates the crossover distortion but
has the potential for thermal instability if the transistor’s VBE drops are not matched to the
diode drops or if the diodes are not in thermal equilibrium with the transistors. Heat in the
power transistors decreases the base-emitter voltage and tends to increase current. If
the diodes are warmed the same amount, the current is stabilized; but if the diodes are in a
cooler environment, they cause ICQ to increase even more. More heat is produced in an un-
restrained cycle known as thermal runaway. To keep this from happening, the diodes
should have the same thermal environment as the transistors. In some cases, a small resis-
tor in the emitter of each transistor can alleviate thermal runaway.
Crossover distortion also occurs in transformer-coupled amplifiers like the one shown
in Figure 7–8. To eliminate it in this case, 0.7 V is applied to the input transformer’s sec-
ondary that just biases both transistors into conduction. The bias voltage to produce this
drop can be derived from the power supply using a single diode as shown in Figure 7–12.

AC Operation
Consider the ac load line for Q1 of the class AB amplifier in Figure 7–11.
The Q-point is slightly above cutoff. (In a true class B amplifier, the Q-point is at cutoff.)
The ac cutoff voltage for a two-supply operation is at VCC with an ICQ as given earlier. The
ac saturation current for a two-supply operation with a push-pull amplifier is

both transistors! This assumed short across the power supplies obviously would cause
maximum current from the supplies and implies the dc load line passes almost vertically
through the cutoff as shown. Operation along the dc load line, such as caused by thermal
runaway, could produce such a high current that the transistors are destroyed.
Figure 7–14(a) illustrates the ac load line for Q1 of the class AB amplifier in Figure
7–14(b). In the case illustrated, a signal is applied that swings over the region of the ac load
line shown in bold. At the upper end of the ac load line, the voltage across the transistor
(Vce) is a minimum, and the output voltage is maximum.
Under maximum conditions, transistors Q1 and Q2 are alternately driven from near cut-
off to near saturation. During the positive alternation of the input signal, the Q1 emitter is
driven from its Q-point value of 0 to nearly VCC, producing a positive peak voltage a little
less than VCC. Likewise, during the negative alternation of the input signal, the Q2 emitter
is driven from its Q-point value of 0 V, to near 
producing a negative peak voltage
almost equal to 
Although it is possible to operate close to the saturation current, this
type of operation results in increased distortion of the signal.
The ac saturation current (Equation 7–5) is also the peak output current. Each transistor
can essentially operate over its entire load line. Recall that in class A operation, the tran-
sistor can also operate over the entire load line but with a significant difference. In class A
operation, the Q-point is near the middle and there is significant current in the transistors
even with no signal. In class B operation, when there is no signal, the transistors have only
a very small current and therefore dissipate very little power. Thus, the efficiency of a class
B amplifier can be much higher than a class A amplifier. It will be shown later that the
maximum efficiency of a class B amplifier is 79%.

Darlington Class AB Amplifier
In many applications where the push-pull configuration is used, the load resistance is relatively
small. For example, an 
speaker is a common load for a class AB push-pull amplifier.
As you saw in the previous example, push-pull amplifiers can present a quite low input
resistance to the preceding amplifier that drives it. Depending on the output resistance of
the preceding amplifier, the low push-pull input resistance can load it severely and signifi-
cantly reduce the voltage gain. As an example, if each bias resistor is 
and if the
complementary transistors in a push-pull amplifier exhibit an ac beta of 50 and the load
resistance is 
the input resistance 
is
If the collector resistance of the driving amplifier is, for example, 
the input
resistance of the push-pull amplifier reduces the effective collector resistance of the driving
amplifier (assuming a common-emitter) to 
This drastically reduces the voltage gain of the driving amplifier because its gain is 
In certain applications with low-resistance loads, a push-pull amplifier using Darlington
transistors can be used to increase the input resistance presented to the driving amplifier
and avoid severely reducing the voltage gain. The overall ac beta of a Darlington pair is
generally in excess of a thousand. Also, the bias resistors can be greater because less base
current is required.
In the previous case, for example, if 
for each transistor in a Darlington pair,
the overall ac beta is 
If the bias resistors are 
the input
resistance is greatly increased, as the following calculation shows.

Darlington/Complementary Darlington Class AB Amplifier
The complementary Darlington, also known as the Sziklai pair, was introduced in Chapter 6.
Recall that it is similar to the traditional Darlington pair except it uses complementary
transistors (one npn and one pnp). The complementary Darlington is used when it is deter-
mined that output power transistors of the same type should be used (both npn or both
pnp). Figure 7–20 shows a class AB push-pull amplifier with two npn output power tran-
sistors (Q2 and Q4). The upper part of the push-pull configuration is a traditional
Darlington, and the lower part is a complementary Darlington.

THE CLASS C AMPLIFIER
Class C amplifiers are biased so that conduction occurs for much less than 
Class C
amplifiers are more efficient than either class A or push-pull class B and class AB, which
means that more output power can be obtained from class C operation. The output ampli-
tude is a nonlinear function of the input, so class C amplifiers are not used for linear
amplification. They are generally used in radio frequency (RF) applications, including
circuits, such as oscillators, that have a constant output amplitude, and modulators, where
a high-frequency signal is controlled by a low-frequency signal.

Basic Class C Operation
The basic concept of class C operation is illustrated in Figure 7–21. A common-emitter
class C amplifier with a resistive load is shown in Figure 7–22(a). A class C amplifier is
normally operated with a resonant circuit load, so the resistive load is used only for the
purpose of illustrating the concept. It is biased below cutoff with the negative VBB supply.
The ac source voltage has a peak value that is slightly greater than 
so that the
base voltage exceeds the barrier potential of the base-emitter junction for a short time near
the positive peak of each cycle, as illustrated in Figure 7–22(b). During this short interval, the
transistor is turned on. When the entire ac load line is used, as shown in Figure 7–22(c), the
ideal maximum collector current is Ic(sat), and the ideal minimum collector voltage is
Vce(sat).

Power Dissipation
The power dissipation of the transistor in a class C amplifier is low because it is on for only
a small percentage of the input cycle. Figure 7–23(a) shows the collector current pulses.
The time between the pulses is the period (T) of the ac input voltage. The collector current
and the collector voltage during the on time of the transistor are shown in Figure 7–23(b).
To avoid complex mathematics, we will assume ideal pulse approximations. Using this
simplification, if the output swings over the entire load, the maximum current amplitude is
Ic(sat) and the minimum voltage amplitude is Vce(sat) during the time the transistor is on.
The power dissipation during the on time is, therefore,
The transistor is on for a short time, ton, and off for the rest of the input cycle. Therefore,
assuming the entire load line is used, the power dissipation averaged over the entire
cycle is

Solution

Therefore,
The low power dissipation of the transistor operated in class C is important because, as
you will see later, it leads to a very high efficiency when it is operated as a tuned class C
amplifier in which relatively high power is achieved in the resonant circuit.

Tuned Operation
Because the collector voltage (output) is not a replica of the input, the resistively loaded
class C amplifier alone is of no value in linear applications. It is therefore necessary to use a
class C amplifier with a parallel resonant circuit (tank), as shown in Figure 7–24(a). The res-
onant frequency of the tank circuit is determined by the formula 
The short
pulse of collector current on each cycle of the input initiates and sustains the oscillation of
the tank circuit so that an output sinusoidal voltage is produced, as illustrated in Figure
7–24(b). The tank circuit has high impedance only near the resonant frequency, so the gain
is large only at this frequency.
fr = 1>(2p1LC).
The current pulse charges the capacitor to approximately VCC, as shown in Figure
7–25(a). After the pulse, the capacitor quickly discharges, thus charging the inductor.
Then, after the capacitor completely discharges, the inductor’s magnetic field collapses
and then quickly recharges C to near VCC in a direction opposite to the previous charge.
This completes one half-cycle of the oscillation, as shown in parts (b) and (c) of Figure
7–25. Next, the capacitor discharges again, increasing the inductor’s magnetic field.
The inductor then quickly recharges the capacitor back to a positive peak slightly less than
the previous one, due to energy loss in the winding resistance. This completes one full
cycle, as shown in parts (d) and (e) of Figure 7–25. The peak-to-peak output voltage is
therefore approximately equal to 2VCC.
The amplitude of each successive cycle of the oscillation will be less than that of the
previous cycle because of energy loss in the resistance of the tank circuit, as shown in
Figure 7–26(a), and the oscillation will eventually die out. However, the regular recur-
rences of the collector current pulse re-energizes the resonant circuit and sustains the oscil-
lations at a constant amplitude.
When the tank circuit is tuned to the frequency of the input signal (fundamental), re-
energizing occurs on each cycle of the tank voltage, Vr, as shown in Figure 7–26(b). When
the tank circuit is tuned to the second harmonic of the input signal, re-energizing occurs on
alternate cycles as shown in Figure 7–26(c). In this case, a class C amplifier operates as a
frequency multiplier 
By tuning the resonant tank circuit to higher harmonics, further
frequency multiplication factors are achieved.

This places the transistor in cutoff except at the positive
peaks, when the transistor conducts for a short interval. For good clamping action,
the R1C1 time constant of the clamping circuit must be much greater than the period of

Oscilloscope displays showing output voltage for the amplifier in Figure 7–30 for several types of failures.
Now let’s consider four incorrect output waveforms and the most likely causes in each
case. In Figure 7–31(a), the scope displays a dc level equal to the dc supply voltage, indicat-
ing that the transistor is in cutoff. The two most likely causes of this condition are (1) the
transistor has an open pn junction, or (2) R4 is open, preventing collector and emitter current.
In Figure 7–31(b), the scope displays a dc level at the collector approximately equal to
the dc emitter voltage. The two probable causes of this indication are (1) the transistor is
shorted from collector to emitter, or (2) R2 is open, causing the transistor to be biased in
saturation. In the second case, a sufficiently large input signal can bring the transistor out
of saturation on its negative peaks, resulting in short pulses on the output.
In Figure 7–31(c), the scope displays an output waveform that indicates the transistor is
in cutoff except during a small portion of the input cycle. Possible causes of this indication
are (1) the Q-point has shifted down due to a drastic out-of-tolerance change in a resistor
value, or (2) R1 is open, biasing the transistor in cutoff. The display shows that the input
signal is sufficient to bring it out of cutoff for a small portion of the cycle.
In Figure 7–31(d), the scope displays an output waveform that indicates the transistor is
saturated except during a small portion of the input cycle. Again, it is possible that an 
incorrect resistance value has caused a drastic shift in the Q-point up toward saturation, or
R2 is open, causing the transistor to be biased in saturation, and the input signal is bringing
it out of saturation for a small portion of the cycle.
Case 2: Class AB
As shown in Figure 7–32, the class AB push-pull amplifier should have a sinusoidal output
when a sinusoidal input signal is applied.

Two incorrect output waveforms are shown in Figure 7–33. The waveform in part (a)
shows that only the positive half of the input signal is present on the output. One possible
cause is that diode D1 is open. If this is the fault, the positive half of the input signal forward-
biases D2 and causes transistor Q2 to conduct. Another possible cause is that the base-emitter
junction of Q2 is open so only the positive half of the input signal appears on the output
because Q1 is still working.

POWER AMPLIFIERS
SUMMARY
Section 7–1
◆A class A power amplifier operates entirely in the linear region of the transistor’s characteristic
curves. The transistor conducts during the full 
of the input cycle.
◆The Q-point must be centered on the load line for maximum class A output signal swing.
◆The maximum efficiency of a class A power amplifier is 25 percent.
Section 7–2
◆A class B amplifier operates in the linear region for half of the input cycle 
and it is in
cutoff for the other half.
◆The Q-point is at cutoff for class B operation.
◆Class B amplifiers are normally operated in a push-pull configuration in order to produce an
output that is a replica of the input.
◆The maximum efficiency of a class B amplifier is 79 percent.
◆A class AB amplifier is biased slightly above cutoff and operates in the linear region for slightly
more than 
of the input cycle.
◆Class AB eliminates crossover distortion found in pure class B.
Section 7–3
◆A class C amplifier operates in the linear region for only a small part of the input cycle.
◆The class C amplifier is biased below cutoff.
◆Class C amplifiers are normally operated as tuned amplifiers to produce a sinusoidal output.
◆The maximum efficiency of a class C amplifier is higher than that of either class A or class B
amplifiers. Under conditions of low power dissipation and high output power, the efficiency can
approach 100 percent.

INTRODUCTION
BJTs (bipolar junction transistors) were covered in previous
chapters. Now we will discuss the second major type of
transistor, the FET (field-effect transistor). FETs are unipolar
devices because, unlike BJTs that use both electron and hole
current, they operate only with one type of charge carrier.
The two main types of FETs are the junction field-effect tran-
sistor (JFET) and the metal oxide semiconductor field-effect
transistor (MOSFET). The term field-effect relates to the
depletion region formed in the channel of a FET as a result
of a voltage applied on one of its terminals (gate).
Recall that a BJT is a current-controlled device; that is,
the base current controls the amount of collector current. A
FET is different. It is a voltage-controlled device, where the
voltage between two of the terminals (gate and source)
controls the current through the device. A major advantage
of FETs is their very high input resistance. Because of their
nonlinear characteristics, they are generally not as widely
used in amplifiers as BJTs except where very high input
impedances are required. However, FETs are the preferred
device in low-voltage switching applications because they are
generally faster than BJTs when turned on and off. The IGBT
is generally used in high-voltage switching applications.

Basic Structure
Figure 8–1(a) shows the basic structure of an n-channel JFET (junction field-effect transis-
tor). Wire leads are connected to each end of the n-channel; the drain is at the upper end,
and the source is at the lower end. Two p-type regions are diffused in the n-type material
to form a channel, and both p-type regions are connected to the gate lead. For simplicity,
the gate lead is shown connected to only one of the p regions. A p-channel JFET is shown
in Figure 8–1(b). 
8–1
THE JFET
The JFET (junction field-effect transistor) is a type of FET that operates with a
reverse-biased pn junction to control current in a channel. Depending on their
structure, JFETs fall into either of two categories, n channel or p channel.
After completing this section, you should be able to

drain to source. VGG sets the reverse-bias voltage between the gate and the source, as
shown.
The JFET is always operated with the gate-source pn junction reverse-biased. Reverse-
biasing of the gate-source junction with a negative gate voltage produces a depletion re-
gion along the pn junction, which extends into the n channel and thus increases its resist-
ance by restricting the channel width.
The channel width and thus the channel resistance can be controlled by varying the gate
voltage, thereby controlling the amount of drain current, ID. Figure 8–3 illustrates this con-
cept. The white areas represent the depletion region created by the reverse bias. It is wider
toward the drain end of the channel because the reverse-bias voltage between the gate and
the drain is greater than that between the gate and the source. We will discuss JFET char-
acteristic curves and some parameters in Section 8–2.

Drain Characteristic Curve
Consider the case when the gate-to-source voltage is zero (VGS
0 V). This is produced
by shorting the gate to the source, as in Figure 8–5(a) where both are grounded. As VDD
(and thus VDS) is increased from 0 V, ID will increase proportionally, as shown in the graph
of Figure 8–5(b) between points A and B. In this area, the channel resistance is essentially
constant because the depletion region is not large enough to have significant effect. This is
called the ohmic region because VDS and ID are related by Ohm’s law. (Ohmic region is
discussed further in Section 8–4.)
At point B in Figure 8–5(b), the curve levels off and enters the active region where ID
becomes essentially constant. As VDS increases from point B to point C, the reverse-bias

FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS (FETS)
voltage from gate to drain (VGD) produces a depletion region large enough to offset the in-
crease in VDS, thus keeping ID relatively constant.
Pinch-Off Voltage
For VGS
0 V, the value of VDS at which ID becomes essentially
constant (point B on the curve in Figure 8–5(b)) is the pinch-off voltage, VP. For a given
JFET, VP has a fixed value. As you can see, a continued increase in VDS above the pinch-
off voltage produces an almost constant drain current. This value of drain current is IDSS
(Drain to Source current with gate Shorted) and is always specified on JFET datasheets.
IDSS is the maximum drain current that a specific JFET can produce regardless of the exter-
nal circuit, and it is always specified for the condition, VGS
0 V.
Breakdown
As shown in the graph in Figure 8–5(b), breakdown occurs at point C
when ID begins to increase very rapidly with any further increase in VDS. Breakdown can
result in irreversible damage to the device, so JFETs are always operated below breakdown
and within the active region (constant current) (between points B and C on the graph). The
JFET action that produces the drain characteristic curve to the point of breakdown for
VGS
0 V is illustrated in Figure 8–6.
VGS Controls ID
Let’s connect a bias voltage, VGG, from gate to source as shown in Figure 8–7(a). As VGS
is set to increasingly more negative values by adjusting VGG, a family of drain characteristic
curves is produced, as shown in Figure 8–7(b). Notice that ID decreases as the magnitude
of VGS is increased to larger negative values because of the narrowing of the channel.
Also notice that, for each increase in VGS, the JFET reaches pinch-off (where constant
current begins) at values of VDS less than VP. The term pinch-off is not the same as pinch-
off voltage, Vp. Therefore, the amount of drain current is controlled by VGS, as illustrated
in Figure 8–8.
Cutoff Voltage
The value of VGS that makes ID approximately zero is the cutoff voltage, VGS(off), as shown
in Figure 8–8(d). The JFET must be operated between VGS
0 V and VGS(off). For this
range of gate-to-source voltages, ID will vary from a maximum of IDSS to a minimum of
almost zero.

FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS (FETS)
As you have seen, for an n-channel JFET, the more negative VGS is, the smaller ID be-
comes in the active region. When VGS has a sufficiently large negative value, ID is reduced
to zero. This cutoff effect is caused by the widening of the depletion region to a point
where it completely closes the channel, as shown in Figure 8–9.

Comparison of Pinch-Off Voltage and Cutoff Voltage
As you have seen, there is a difference between pinch-off and cutoff voltages. There is
also a connection. The pinch-off voltage VP is the value of VDS at which the drain current
becomes constant and equal to IDSS and is always measured at VGS
0 V. However,

pinch-off occurs for VDS values less than VP when VGS is nonzero. So, although VP is a
constant, the minimum value of VDS at which ID becomes constant varies with VGS.
VGS(off) and VP are always equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. A datasheet usually
will give either VGS(off) or VP, but not both. However, when you know one, you have the
other. For example, if

FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS (FETS)
JFET Universal Transfer Characteristic
You have learned that a range of VGS values from zero to VGS(off) controls the amount of drain
current. For an n-channel JFET, VGS(off) is negative, and for a p-channel JFET, VGS(off) is pos-
itive. Because VGS does control ID, the relationship between these two quantities is very
important. Figure 8–12 is a general transfer characteristic curve that illustrates graphically
the relationship between VGS and ID. This curve is also known as a transconductance curve.

JFET Forward Transconductance
The forward transconductance (transfer conductance), gm, is the change in drain current
for a given change in gate-to-source voltage
with the drain-to-source voltage
constant. It is expressed as a ratio and has the unit of siemens (S).
Other common designations for this parameter are gfs and yfs (forward transfer admit-
tance). As you will see in Chapter 9, gm is an important factor in determining the voltage
gain of a FET amplifier.
Because the transfer characteristic curve for a JFET is nonlinear, gm varies in value depend-
ing on the location on the curve as set by VGS. The value for gm is greater near the top of the
curve (near VGS  0) than it is near the bottom (near VGS(off)), as illustrated in Figure 8–15.

FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS (FETS)
Input Resistance and Capacitance
As you know, a JFET operates with its gate-source junction reverse-biased, which makes
the input resistance at the gate very high. This high input resistance is one advantage of the
JFET over the BJT. (Recall that a bipolar junction transistor operates with a forward-biased
base-emitter junction.) JFET datasheets often specify the input resistance by giving a value
for the gate reverse current, IGSS, at a certain gate-to-source voltage. The input resistance
can then be determined using the following equation, where the vertical lines indicate an
absolute value (no sign):
For example, the 2N5457 datasheet in Figure 8–14 lists a maximum IGSS of
for
at
IGSS increases with temperature, so the input resistance decreases.
The input capacitance, Ciss, is a result of the JFET operating with a reverse-biased pn
junction. Recall that a reverse-biased pn junction acts as a capacitor whose capacitance de-
pends on the amount of reverse voltage. For example, the 2N5457 has a maximum Ciss of
7 pF for VGS  0.

AC Drain-to-Source Resistance
You learned from the drain characteristic curve that, above pinch-off, the drain current is
relatively constant over a range of drain-to-source voltages. Therefore, a large change in
VDS produces only a very small change in ID. The ratio of these changes is the ac drain-to-
source resistance of the device,

admittance, yos, for VGS  0 V.

JFET BIASING

397
Self-Bias
Self-bias is the most common type of JFET bias. Recall that a JFET must be operated such
that the gate-source junction is always reverse-biased. This condition requires a negative
VGS for an n-channel JFET and a positive VGS for a p-channel JFET. This can be achieved
using the self-bias arrangements shown in Figure 8–16. The gate resistor, RG, does not af-
fect the bias because it has essentially no voltage drop across it; and therefore the gate re-
mains at 0 V. RG is necessary only to force the gate to be at 0 V and to isolate an ac signal
from ground in amplifier applications, as you will see later.

gate-to-source voltage is zero, what is VP?
2. The VGS of a certain n-channel JFET is increased negatively. Does the drain current

JFET BIASING
Using some of the JFET parameters discussed previously, you will now see how to
dc-bias JFETs. Just as with the BJT, the purpose of biasing is to select the proper dc
gate-to-source voltage to establish a desired value of drain current and, thus, a proper
Q-point. Three types of bias are self-bias, voltage-divider bias, and current-source bias.

For the n-channel JFET in Figure 8–16(a), IS produces a voltage drop across RS and

In the following example, the n-channel JFET in Figure 8–16(a) is used for illustration.
Keep in mind that analysis of the p-channel JFET is the same except for opposite-polarity
voltages. The drain voltage with respect to ground is determined as follows:
Since VS  IDRS, the drain-to-source voltage is
VDS = VD - VS = VDD - ID(RD + RS)
VD = VDD - IDRD
VGS = +IDRS
VGS = -IDRS
VGS = VG - VS = 0 - IDRS = -IDRS
Find VDS and VGS in Figure 8–17. For the particular JFET in this circuit, the parameter
values such as gm, VGS(off), and IDSS are such that a drain current (ID) of approximately
5 mA is produced. Another JFET, even of the same type, may not produce the same
results when connected in this circuit due to the variations in parameter values.

Setting the Q-Point of a Self-Biased JFET
The basic approach to establishing a JFET bias point is to determine ID for a desired value
of VGS or vice versa. Then calculate the required value of RS using the following relation-
ship. The vertical lines indicate an absolute value.
For a desired value of VGS, ID can be determined in either of two ways: from the trans-
fer characteristic curve for the particular JFET or, more practically, from Equation 8–1
using IDSS and VGS(off) from the JFET datasheet. The next two examples illustrate these
procedures.

Midpoint Bias
It is usually desirable to bias a JFET near the midpoint of its transfer
characteristic curve where ID  IDSS2. Under signal conditions, midpoint bias allows the
maximum amount of drain current swing between IDSS and 0. For Equation 8–1, it can be
shown that ID is approximately one-half of IDSS when VGS  VGS(off)3.4. The derivation
is given in “Derivations of Selected Equations” at www.pearsonhighered.com/floyd.
So, by selecting VGS  VGS(off) 3.4, you should get a midpoint bias in terms of ID.

If a self-bias dc load line is drawn as illustrated in Figure 8–27(b), the same circuit
using a 2N5459 can have a Q-point anywhere along the line from Q1, the minimum bias
point, to Q2, the maximum bias point. Accordingly, the drain current can be any value
between ID1 and ID2, as shown by the shaded area. This means that the dc voltage at the
drain can have a range of values depending on ID. Also, the gate-to-source voltage can
be any value between VGS1 and VGS2, as indicated.
Figure 8–28 illustrates Q-point stability for a self-biased JFET and for a JFET with voltage-
divider bias. With voltage-divider bias, the dependency of ID on the range of Q-points is
reduced because the slope of the load line is less than for self-bias for a given JFET.
Although VGS varies quite a bit for both self-bias and voltage-divider bias, ID is much more
stable with voltage-divider bias.
Current-Source Bias
Current-source bias is a method for increasing the Q-point stability of a self-biased
JFET by making the drain current essentially independent of VGS. This is accomplished
by using a constant-current source in series with the JFET source, as shown in Figure
8–29(a). In this circuit, a BJT acts as the constant-current source because its emitter
current is essentially constant if
A FET can also be used as a constant-
current source.

THE OHMIC REGION
The ohmic region is the portion of the FET characteristic curves in which Ohm’s law

have a relatively constant slope for small values of ID. The slope of the characteristic curve

The JFET as a Variable Resistance
A JFET can be biased in either the active region or
the ohmic region. JFETs are often biased in the ohmic region for use as a voltage-
controlled variable resistor. The control voltage is VGS, and it determines the resistance by
varying the Q-point. To bias a JFET in the ohmic region, the dc load line must intersect the
characteristic curve in the ohmic region, as illustrated in Figure 8–31. To do this in a way
that allows VGS to control RDS, the dc saturation current is set for a value much less than
IDSS so that the load line intersects most of the characteristic curves in the ohmic region, as
illustrated. In this case,
Figure 8–31 shows the operating region expanded with three Q-points shown (Q0, Q1, and
Q2), depending on VGS.

FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS (FETS)
As you move along the load line in the ohmic region of Figure 8–31, the value of RDS
varies as the Q-point falls successively on curves with different slopes. The Q-point is
moved along the load line by varying
to
in this case. As this hap-
pens, the slope of each successive curve is less than the previous one. A decrease in slope
corresponds to less ID and more VDS, which implies an increase in RDS. This change in
resistance can be exploited in a number of applications where voltage control of a resist-
ance is useful.

Q-point at the Origin
In certain amplifiers, you may want to change the resistance seen
by the ac signal without affecting the dc bias in order to control the gain. Sometimes you
will see a JFET used as a variable resistance in a circuit where both ID and VDS are set at 0,
which means that the Q-point is at the origin. A Q-point at the origin is achieved by using
a capacitor in the drain circuit of the JFET. This makes the dc quantities VDS
0 V and
ID
0 mA, so the only variables are VGS and Id, the ac drain current. At the origin you have
the ac drain current controlled by VGS. As you learned earlier, transconductance is defined
as a change in drain current for a given change in gate-to-source voltage. So, the key factor
when you bias at the origin is the transconductance. Figure 8–33 shows the characteristic
curves expanded at the origin. Notice that the ohmic region extends into the third quadrant.

THE MOSFET
The MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor) is another category
of field-effect transistor. The MOSFET, different from the JFET, has no pn junction
structure; instead, the gate of the MOSFET is insulated from the channel by a silicon
dioxide (SiO2) layer. The two basic types of MOSFETs are enhancement (E) and deple-
tion (D). Of the two types, the enhancement MOSFET is more widely used. Because
polycrystalline silicon is now used for the gate material instead of metal, these devices
are sometimes called IGFETs (insulated-gate FETs).

THE MOSFET
◆
413
Enhancement MOSFET (E-MOSFET)
The E-MOSFET operates only in the enhancement mode and has no depletion mode. It
differs in construction from the D-MOSFET, which is discussed next, in that it has no
structural channel. Notice in Figure 8–34(a) that the substrate extends completely to the
SiO2 layer. For an n-channel device, a positive gate voltage above a threshold value
induces a channel by creating a thin layer of negative charges in the substrate region adja-
cent to the SiO2 layer, as shown in Figure 8–34(b). The conductivity of the channel is
enhanced by increasing the gate-to-source voltage and thus pulling more electrons into
the channel area. For any gate voltage below the threshold value, there is no channel.
After completing this section, you should be able to

Depletion MOSFET (D-MOSFET)
Another type of MOSFET is the depletion MOSFET (D-MOSFET), and Figure 8–36
illustrates its basic structure. The drain and source are diffused into the substrate material
and then connected by a narrow channel adjacent to the insulated gate. Both n-channel and
p-channel devices are shown in the figure. We will use the n-channel device to describe the
basic operation. The p-channel operation is the same, except the voltage polarities are
opposite those of the n-channel.

Representation of the basic structure of D-MOSFETs.
The D-MOSFET can be operated in either of two modes—the depletion mode or the
enhancement mode—and is sometimes called a depletion/enhancement MOSFET.
Since the gate is insulated from the channel, either a positive or a negative gate voltage
can be applied. The n-channel MOSFET operates in the depletion mode when a nega-
tive gate-to-source voltage is applied and in the enhancement mode when a positive
gate-to-source voltage is applied. These devices are generally operated in the depletion
mode.
Depletion Mode
Visualize the gate as one plate of a parallel-plate capacitor and the
channel as the other plate. The silicon dioxide insulating layer is the dielectric. With a
negative gate voltage, the negative charges on the gate repel conduction electrons from
the channel, leaving positive ions in their place. Thereby, the n channel is depleted of
some of its electrons, thus decreasing the channel conductivity. The greater the negative
voltage on the gate, the greater the depletion of n-channel electrons. At a sufficiently
negative gate-to-source voltage, VGS(off), the channel is totally depleted and the drain
current is zero. This depletion mode is illustrated in Figure 8–37(a). Like the n-channel
JFET, the n-channel D-MOSFET conducts drain current for gate-to-source voltages
between VGS(off) and zero. In addition, the D-MOSFET conducts for values of VGS above
zero.

THE MOSFET

Enhancement Mode
With a positive gate voltage, more conduction electrons are attracted
into the channel, thus increasing (enhancing) the channel conductivity, as illustrated in
Figure 8–37(b).
D-MOSFET Symbols
The schematic symbols for both the n-channel and the p-channel
depletion MOSFETs are shown in Figure 8–38. The substrate, indicated by the arrow, is

Power MOSFET Structures
The conventional enhancement MOSFETs have a long thin lateral channel as shown in the
structural view in Figure 8–39. This results in a relatively high drain-to-source resistance
and limits the E-MOSFET to low power applications. When the gate is positive, the chan-
nel is formed close to the gate between the source and the drain, as shown.
Laterally Diffused MOSFET (LDMOSFET)
The LDMOSFET has a lateral channel
structure and is a type of enhancement MOSFET designed for power applications.
This device has a shorter channel between drain and source than does the conventional
E-MOSFET. The shorter channel results in lower resistance, which allows higher current
and voltage.
A new type of field-effect transistor
uses a fin-like structure instead of
the conventional flat silicon
structure. It is much smaller than
the conventional silicon transistors.
The fins are made from a
semiconductor material called
indium-gallium-arsenide instead of
silicon. In addition to making
computer chips much smaller in
size, the finFET can operate many
times faster than conventional FETs.

FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS (FETS)
Figure 8–40 shows the basic structure of an LDMOSFET. When the gate is positive, a
very short n channel is induced in the p layer between the lightly doped source and the n-
region. There is current between the drain and source through the n regions and the in-
duced channel as indicated.
VMOSFET
The V-groove MOSFET is another example of the conventional E-MOSFET
designed to achieve higher power capability by creating a shorter and wider channel with
less resistance between the drain and source using a vertical channel structure. The shorter,
wider channels allow for higher currents and, thus, greater power dissipation. Frequency
response is also improved.
The VMOSFET has two source connections, a gate connection on top, and a drain con-
nection on the bottom, as shown in Figure 8–41. The channel is induced vertically along
both sides of the V-shaped groove between the drain (n+ substrate where n+ means a higher
doping level than
) and the source connections. The channel length is set by the thick-
ness of the layers, which is controlled by doping densities and diffusion time rather than by
mask dimensions.
n-
TMOSFET
The vertical channel structure of the TMOSFET is illustrated in Figure 8–42.
The gate structure is embedded in a silicon dioxide layer, and the source contact is con-
tinuous over the entire surface area. The drain is on the bottom. TMOSFET achieves
greater packing density than VMOSFET, while retaining the short vertical channel
advantage.

Dual-Gate MOSFETs
The dual-gate MOSFET can be either a depletion or an enhancement type. The only dif-
ference is that it has two gates, as shown in Figure 8–43. As previously mentioned, one
drawback of a FET is its high input capacitance, which restricts its use at higher frequen-
cies. By using a dual-gate device, the input capacitance is reduced, thus making the device
useful in high-frequency RF amplifier applications. Another advantage of the dual-gate
arrangement is that it allows for an automatic gain control (AGC) input in RF amplifiers.
Another application is demonstrated in the Application Activity where the bias on the sec-
ond gate is used to adjust the transconductance curve.

FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS (FETS)
E-MOSFET Transfer Characteristic
The E-MOSFET uses only channel enhancement. Therefore, an n-channel device requires
a positive gate-to-source voltage, and a p-channel device requires a negative gate-to-source
voltage. Figure 8–44 shows the general transfer characteristic curves for both types of
E-MOSFETs. As you can see, there is no drain current when VGS
0. Therefore, the
E-MOSFET does not have a significant IDSS parameter, as do the JFET and the D-MOSFET.
Notice also that there is ideally no drain current until VGS reaches a certain nonzero value
called the threshold voltage, VGS(th).
=
The equation for the parabolic transfer characteristic curve of the E-MOSFET differs
from that of the JFET and the D-MOSFET because the curve starts at VGS(th) rather than
VGS(off) on the horizontal axis and never intersects the vertical axis. The equation for the
E-MOSFET transfer characteristic curve is
Equation 8–4
The constant K depends on the particular MOSFET and can be determined from the
datasheet by taking the specified value of ID, called ID(on), at the given value of VGS and
substituting the values into Equation 8–4 as illustrated in Example 8–16.

Handling Precautions
All MOS devices are subject to damage from electrostatic discharge (ESD). Because the gate
of a MOSFET is insulated from the channel, the input resistance is extremely high (ideally
infinite). The gate leakage current, IGSS, for a typical MOSFET is in the pA range, whereas the
gate reverse current for a typical JFET is in the nA range. The input capacitance results from
the insulated gate structure. Excess static charge can be accumulated because the input capac-
itance combines with the very high input resistance and can result in damage to the device. To
avoid damage from ESD, certain precautions should be taken when handling MOSFETs:
1. Carefully remove MOSFET devices from their packaging. They are shipped in con-
ductive foam or special foil conductive bags. Usually they are shipped with a wire ring
around the leads, which is removed just prior to installing the MOSFET in a circuit.
2. All instruments and metal benches used in assembly or test should be connected to
earth ground (round or third prong of 110 V wall outlets).
3. The assembler’s or handler’s wrist should be connected to a commercial grounding
strap, which has a high-value series resistor for safety. The resistor prevents acci-
dental contact with voltage from becoming lethal.
4. Never remove a MOS device (or any other device, for that matter) from the circuit
while the power is on.
5. Do not apply signals to a MOS device while the dc power supply is off.

E-MOSFET Bias
Because E-MOSFETs must have a VGS greater than the threshold value, VGS(th), zero bias
cannot be used. Figure 8–46 shows two ways to bias an E-MOSFET (D-MOSFETs can
also be biased using these methods). An n-channel device is used for purposes of
illustration. In either the voltage-divider or drain-feedback bias arrangement, the purpose
is to make the gate voltage more positive than the source by an amount exceeding VGS(th).
Equations for the analysis of the voltage-divider bias in Figure 8–46(a) are as follows:

from Equation 8–4.
In the drain-feedback bias circuit in Figure 8–46(b), there is negligible gate current and,
therefore, no voltage drop across RG. This makes VGS

D-MOSFET Bias
Recall that D-MOSFETs can be operated with either positive or negative values of VGS. A
simple bias method is to set VGS
0 so that an ac signal at the gate varies the gate-to-
source voltage above and below this 0 V bias point. A MOSFET with zero bias is shown in
Figure 8–49(a). Since VGS
0, ID
IDSS as indicated. The drain-to-source voltage is
expressed as follows:
The purpose of RG is to accommodate an ac signal input by isolating it from ground, as
shown in Figure 8–49(b). Since there is no dc gate current, RG does not affect the zero
gate-to-source bias.

THE IGBT
The IGBT (insulated-gate bipolar transistor) combines features from both the
MOSFET and the BJT that make it useful in high-voltage and high-current switch-
ing applications. The IGBT has largely replaced the MOSFET and the BJT in many
of these applications.

FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS (FETS)
The IGBT is a device that has the output conduction characteristics of a BJT but is
voltage controlled like a MOSFET; it is an excellent choice for many high-voltage
switching applications. The IGBT has three terminals: gate, collector, and emitter. One
common circuit symbol is shown in Figure 8–51. As you can see, it is similar to the BJT
symbol except there is an extra bar representing the gate structure of a MOSFET rather
than a base.
The IGBT has MOSFET input characteristics and BJT output characteristics. BJTs are
capable of higher currents than FETs, but MOSFETs have no gate current because of the
insulated gate structure. IGBTs exhibit a lower saturation voltage than MOSFETs and
have about the same saturation voltage as BJTs. IGBTs are superior to MOSFETs in some
applications because they can handle high collector-to-emitter voltages exceeding 200 V
and exhibit less saturation voltage when they are in the on state. IGBTs are superior to
BJTs in some applications because they can switch faster. In terms of switching speed,
MOSFETs switch fastest, then IGBTs, followed by BJTs, which are slowest. A general
comparison of IGBTs, MOSFETs, and BJTs is given in Table 8–1.

Operation
The IGBT is controlled by the gate voltage just like a MOSFET. Essentially, an IGBT can
be thought of as a voltage-controlled BJT, but with faster switching speeds. Because it is
controlled by voltage on the insulated gate, the IGBT has essentially no input current and
does not load the driving source. A simplified equivalent circuit for an IGBT is shown in
Figure 8–52. The input element is a MOSFET, and the output element is a bipolar transis-
tor. When the gate voltage with respect to the emitter is less than a threshold voltage,
Vthresh, the device is turned off. The device is turned on by increasing the gate voltage to a
value exceeding the threshold voltage.
The npnp structure of the IGBT forms a parasitic transistor and an inherent parasitic
resistance within the device, as shown in red in Figure 8–53. These parasitic components
have no effect during normal operation. However, if the maximum collector current is
exceeded under certain conditions, the parasitic transistor, Qp can turn on. If Qp turns on, it

Faults in Self-Biased JFET Circuits
Symptom 1: VD  VDD
For this condition, the drain current must be zero because there
is no voltage drop across RD, as illustrated in Figure 8–54(a). As in any circuit, it is good
troubleshooting practice to first check for obvious problems such as open or poor connec-
tions, as well as charred resistors. Next, disconnect power and measure suspected resistors
for opens. If these are okay, the JFET is probably bad. Any of the following faults can pro-
duce this symptom:
1. No ground connection at RS
2. RS open
3. Open drain lead connection
4. Open source lead connection
5. FET internally open between drain and source
Symptom 2: VD Significantly Less Than Normal
For this condition, unless the supply
voltage is lower than it should be, the drain current must be larger than normal because the

drop across RD is too much. Figure 8–54(b) indicates this situation. This symptom can be
caused by any of the following:
1. Open RG
2. Open gate lead
3. FET internally open at gate
Any of these three faults will cause the depletion region in the JFET to disappear and the chan-
nel to widen so that the drain current is limited only by RD, RS, and the small channel resistance.
Faults in D-MOSFET and E-MOSFET Circuits
One fault that is difficult to detect is when the gate opens in a zero-biased D-MOSFET. In
a zero-biased D-MOSFET, the gate-to-source voltage ideally remains zero when an open
occurs in the gate circuit; thus, the drain current doesn’t change, and the bias appears nor-
mal, as indicated in Figure 8–55. However, static charge as a result of the open may cause
ID to behave irratically.

An open fault in the gate circuit of a

In an E-MOSFET circuit with voltage-divider bias, an open R1 makes the gate voltage
zero. This causes the transistor to be off and act like an open switch because a gate-to-
source threshold voltage greater than zero is required to turn the device on. This condition
is illustrated in Figure 8–56(a). If R2 opens, the gate is at +VDD and the channel resistance
is very low so the device approximates a closed switch. The drain current is limited only by
RD. This condition is illustrated in Figure 8–56(b).

Application Activity: pH Sensor Circuit
This application involves electronic instrumentation in a waste water treatment facility.
The system controls the amount of acid and base reagent added to waste water in order
to neutralize it. The diagram of the waste water neutralization pH system is shown in
Figure 8–57. The system measures and controls the pH of the water, which is a measure
of the degree of acidity or alkalinity. The pH scale ranges from 0 for the strongest acids
through 7 for neutral solutions and up to 14 for the strongest bases (caustics). Typically,
the pH for waste water ranges from greater than 2 and less than 11. The pH of the water
is measured by sensor probes at the inlets and outlets of the tanks. The processor and
controller unit uses the inputs from the pH sensor circuits to adjust the amount of acid or
base introduced into the neutralization tank. The pH should be 7 at the outlet of the
smoothing tank.

428
◆
FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS (FETS)
Generally, waste water treatment is done in three steps as follows:
◆Primary treatment
Collecting, screening, and initial storage
◆Secondary treatment
Removal of solids and the majority of contaminants using
filters, coagulation, flocculation, and membranes
◆Tertiary treatment
Polishing, pH adjustment, carbon treatment to remove taste
and smells, disinfection, and temporary storage to allow the disinfecting agent
to work
In this application, we are focusing on the process of pH adjustment in the tertiary
stage of treatment.
The Sensor Circuit
There are three identical pH sensor circuits, one for each of the inlet/outlets indicated in
Figure 8–57. The pH sensor produces a small voltage (mV) proportional to the pH of the
water in which it is immersed. The pH sensor produces a negative voltage if the water is
acidic, no voltage if it is neutral, and a positive voltage if it is basic. The sensor output
goes to the gate of a MOSFET circuit, which amplifies the sensor voltage for processing
by the digital controller.

The pH sensor circuit is simulated in Multisim, and the results for a series of sensor input
voltages are shown in Figure 8–61. The sensor is modeled as a dc source in series with 
an internal resistance. Notice that the output of the circuit increases as the sensor input
decreases. Rheostat R3 is used to calibrate each of the three sensor circuits so that they
have an identical output voltage for a given sensor input voltage.

Prototyping and Testing
Now that the circuit has been simulated, the prototype circuit is constructed and
tested. A dc voltage source can be used to provide the sensor input voltages. After the
circuit is successfully tested on a protoboard, it is ready to be finalized on a printed
circuit board.
To build and test a similar circuit, go to Experiment 8 in your lab manual (Laboratory
Exercises for Electronic Devices by David Buchla and Steven Wetterling).
Circuit Board
The pH sensor circuits are implemented on a printed circuit board as shown in Figure 8–62.
Each circuit monitors one of the three pH sensors in the system. Note that a single voltage
divider provides 6 V to the second gate of each transistor.
8. Check the printed circuit board for correctness by comparing with the schematic
in Figure 8–59.
9. Identify the connections on the back side of the board.
10. Label each input and output pin according to function.
Calibration and Testing
The first step is to calibrate each of the three circuits for a pH of 7. Using a known neutral
test solution in a container into which the sensors are placed, the rheostat is adjusted (if
necessary) to produce the same output voltage for each circuit. In this case it is 4.197 V,
as shown in Figure 8–63.
The next step is to replace the neutral solution with one that has an acidity with a known
pH. All the circuits should produce the same voltage within a specified tolerance. Finally,
using a basic solution with a known pH, measure the output voltages. Again, they should
all agree.

SUMMARY
Section 8–1
◆Field-effect transistors are unipolar devices (one-charge carrier).
◆The three FET terminals are source, drain, and gate.
◆The JFET operates with a reverse-biased pn junction (gate-to-source).
◆The high input resistance of a JFET is due to the reverse-biased gate-source junction.
◆Reverse bias of a JFET produces a depletion region within the channel, thus increasing channel
resistance.

436
◆
FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS (FETS)
Section 8–2
◆For an n-channel JFET, VGS can vary from zero negatively to cutoff, VGS(off). For a p-channel
JFET, VGS can vary from zero positively to VGS(off).
◆
IDSS is the constant drain current when VGS  0. This is true for both JFETs and D-MOSFETs.
◆A FET is called a square-law device because of the relationship of ID to the square of a term
containing VGS.
Section 8–3
◆Midpoint bias for a JFET is ID  IDSS 2, obtained by setting VGS
VGS(off) 3.4.
◆The Q-point in a JFET with voltage-divider bias is more stable than in a self-biased JFET.
◆Current-source bias increases the stability of a self-biased JFET.
Section 8–4
◆A JFET used as a variable resistor is biased in the ohmic region.
◆To bias in the ohmic region, ID must be much smaller than IDSS.
◆The gate voltage controls RDS in the ohmic region.
◆When a JFET is biased at the origin (VDS  0, ID  0), the ac channel resistance is controlled
by the gate voltage.
Section 8–5
◆MOSFETs differ from JFETs in that the gate of a MOSFET is insulated from the channel by an
SiO2 layer, whereas the gate and channel in a JFET are separated by a pn junction.
◆A depletion MOSFET (D-MOSFET) can operate with a zero, positive, or negative gate-to-
source voltage.
◆The D-MOSFET has a physical channel between the drain and source.
◆For an n-channel D-MOSFET, negative values of VGS produce the depletion mode and positive

APPLICATION ACTIVITY PREVIEW
A JFET common-source amplifier and a common-gate ampli-
fier are combined in a cascode arrangement for an active 
antenna. Cascode amplifiers are often used for RF (radio fre-
quency) applications to achieve improved high-frequency
performance. In this application, the cascode amplifier pro-
vides a high resistance input for a whip antenna, as well as
high gain to amplify extremely small antenna signals.

INTRODUCTION
Because of their extremely high input resistance and low
noise, FET amplifiers are a good choice for certain applica-
tions, such as amplifying low-level signals in the first stage
of a communication receiver. FETs also have the advantage in
certain power amplifiers and in switching circuits because 
biasing is simple and more efficient. The standard amplifier
configurations are common-source (CS), common-drain (CD)
and common-base (CB), which are analogous to CE, CC, and
CB configurations of BJTs.
FETs can be used in any of the amplifier types introduced
earlier (class A, class B, and class C). In some cases, the FET
circuit will perform better; in other cases, the BJT circuit is 
superior because BJTs have higher gain and better linearity.
Another type of amplifier (class D) is introduced in this chapter
because FETs are always superior to BJTs in class D and you
will rarely see BJTs used in class D. The class D amplifier is a
switching amplifier that is normally either in cutoff or satura-
tion. It is used in analog power amplifiers with a circuit called
a pulse-width modulator, introduced in Section 9–4.
FETs are superior to BJTs in nearly all switching applica-
tions. Various switching circuits—analog switches, analog
multiplexers, and switched capacitors—are discussed. In 
addition, common digital switching circuits are introduced
using CMOS (complementary MOS).

THE COMMON-SOURCE AMPLIFIER
When used in amplifier applications, the FET has an important advantage compared to
the BJT due to the FET’s extremely high input impedance. Disadvantages, however, 
include higher distortion and lower gain. The particular application will usually deter-
mine which type of transistor is best suited. The common-source (CS) amplifier is 
comparable to the common-emitter BJT amplifier that you studied in Chapter 6.

JFET Amplifier Operation
A common-source JFET amplifier is one in which the ac input signal is applied to the
gate and the ac output signal is taken from the drain. The source terminal is common to
both the input and output signal. A common-source amplifier either has no source resistor
or has a bypassed source resistor, so the source is connected to ac ground. A self-biased
common-source n-channel JFET amplifier with an ac source capacitively coupled to the
gate is shown in Figure 9–3(a). The resistor, RG, serves two purposes: It keeps the gate at
approximately 0 V dc (because IGSS is extremely small), and its large value (usually sev-
eral megohms) prevents loading of the ac signal source. A bias voltage is produced by the
drop across RS. The bypass capacitor, C2, keeps the source of the JFET at ac ground.

The input signal voltage causes the gate-to-source voltage to swing above and below its
Q-point value (VGSQ), causing a corresponding swing in drain current. As the drain current

voltage. The drain-to-source voltage swings above and below its Q-point value (VDSQ) and
is 180° out of phase with the gate-to-source voltage, as illustrated in Figure 9–3(b).
A Graphical Picture
The operation just described for an n-channel JFET is illustrated
graphically on both the transfer characteristic curve and the drain characteristic curve in
Figure 9–4. Part (a) shows how a sinusoidal variation, Vgs, produces a corresponding sinu-
soidal variation in Id. As Vgs swings from its Q-point value to a more negative value, Id
decreases from its Q-point value. As Vgs swings to a less negative value, Id increases. Figure
9–4(b) shows a view of the same operation using the drain curves. The signal at the gate drives
the drain current above and below the Q-point on the load line, as indicated by the arrows.
Lines projected from the peaks of the gate voltage across to the ID axis and down to the VDS
axis indicate the peak-to-peak variations of the drain current and drain-to-source voltage, as
shown. Because the transfer characteristic curve is nonlinear, the output will have some dis-
tortion. This can be minimized if the signal swings over a limited portion of the load line.

DC Analysis
The first step in analyzing a JFET amplifier is to determine the dc conditions including ID
and VS. ID determines the Q-point for an amplifier and enables you to calculate VD, so it is
useful to determine its value. It can be found either graphically or mathematically. The
graphical approach, introduced in Chapter 8 using the transconductance curve, will be ap-
plied to an amplifier here. The same result can be obtained by expanding Equation 8–1,
which is the mathematical description of the transconductance curve. The amplifier shown
in Figure 9–5 will be used to illustrate both approaches. To simplify the dc analysis, the
equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 9–6; capacitors appear open to dc, so they are removed.
Graphical Approach
Recall from Section 8–2 that the JFET universal transfer charac-
teristic (transconductance curve) illustrates the relationship between the output current
and the input voltage. The endpoints of the transconductance curve are at IDSS and
VGS(off). A dc graphical solution is done by plotting the load line (for the self-biased case
shown) on the same plot and reading the values of VGS and ID at the intersection of these
plots (Q-point).

The mathematical approach is more tedious than the graphi-
cal approach because it involves expanding the equation into quadratic form and solving
the quadratic equation. To determine ID mathematically from the known quantities, substi-
tute VGS  IDRS into Equation 8–1. The result is shown as Equation 9–2, which has ID on
both sides. Isolating ID requires the solution of the quadratic form, which is given in
“Derivations of Selected Equations” at www.pearsonhighered.com/floyd. A much easier
approach is to enter Equation 9–2 into a graphing calculator such as the TI-89. The steps

cuit as follows. Replace the capacitors by effective shorts, based on the simplifying as-
sumption that

on the assumption that the voltage source has a zero internal resistance. The VDD terminal
is at a zero-volt ac potential and therefore acts as an ac ground.
The ac equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 9–8(a). Notice that the VDD end of Rd and
the source terminal are both effectively at ac ground. Recall that in ac analysis, the ac
ground and the actual circuit ground are treated as the same point.

Effect of an AC Load on Voltage Gain
When a load is connected to an amplifier’s output through a coupling capacitor, as shown
in Figure 9–10(a), the ac drain resistance is effectively RD in parallel with RL because the
upper end of RD is at ac ground. The ac equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 9–10(b). The

Phase Inversion
The output voltage (at the drain) is

The phase inversion can be designated by a negative voltage gain, 
Recall that the
common-emitter BJT amplifier also exhibited a phase inversion.
Input Resistance
Because the input to a common-source amplifier is at the gate, the input resistance is 
extremely high. Ideally, it approaches infinity and can be neglected. As you know, the high
input resistance is produced by the reverse-biased pn junction in a JFET and by the insu-
lated gate structure in a MOSFET. The actual input resistance seen by the signal source is

The signal voltage causes Vgs to swing above and below its zero value, producing a
swing in Id, as shown in Figure 9–13. The negative swing in Vgs produces the depletion
mode, and Id decreases. The positive swing in Vgs produces the enhancement mode, and Id
increases. Note that the enhancement mode is to the right of the vertical axis (VGS  0),
and the depletion mode is to the left. The dc analysis of this amplifier is somewhat easier
than for a JFET because ID  IDSS at VGS  0. Once ID is known, the analysis involves cal-
culating only VD.
The ac analysis is the same as for the JFET amplifier.

FET AMPLIFIERS AND SWITCHING CIRCUITS
A common-drain JFET amplifier is one in which the input signal is applied to the
gate and the output is taken from the source, making the drain common to both. Because
it is common, there is no need for a drain resistor. A common-drain JFET amplifier is
shown in Figure 9–18. A common-drain amplifier is also called a source-follower.
Self-biasing is used in this particular circuit. The input signal is applied to the gate
through a coupling capacitor, C1, and the output signal is coupled to the load resistor
through C2.

THE COMMON-DRAIN AMPLIFIER
The common-drain (CD) amplifier is comparable to the common-collector BJT amplifier.
Recall that the CC amplifier is called an emitter-follower. Similarly, the common-drain
amplifier is called a source-follower because the voltage at the source is approximately
the same amplitude as the input (gate) voltage and is in phase with it. In other words, the
source voltage follows the gate input voltage.

The Cascode Amplifier
One application in which the common-gate configuration is found is the cascode amplifier,
commonly used for RF (radio frequency) applications. A cascode amplifier is one in which a
common-source amplifier and a common-gate amplifier are connected in a series arrangement.
BJTs can also be used to form cascode amplifiers (a common-emitter and a common-base). A
JFET cascode amplifier circuit is shown in Figure 9–24. The input stage is a common-source
amplifier, and its load is a common-gate amplifier connected in the drain circuit.
The cascode amplifier using JFETs provides a very high input resistance and signifi-
cantly reduces capacitive effects to allow for operation at much higher frequencies than a
common-source amplifier alone. Internal capacitances, which exist in every type of tran-
sistor, become significant at higher frequencies and reduce the gain of inverting amplifiers
as described by the Miller effect, covered in Chapter 10. The first stage is a CS amplifier
that inverts the signal. However, the gain is very low because of the low input resistance of

THE COMMON-GATE AMPLIFIER
◆

the CB amplifier that it is driving. As a result, the effect of internal capacitances on the
high-frequency response is very small. The second stage is a CG amplifier that does not in-
vert the signal, so it can have high gain without degrading the high-frequency response.
The combination of the two amplifiers provides the best of both circuits, resulting in high
gain, high input resistance, and an excellent high-frequency response.
The voltage gain of the cascode amplifier in Figure 9–24 is a product of the gains of
both the CS and the CG stages. However, as mentioned, the gain is primarily provided by
the CG amplifier.
Since Rd of the CS amplifier stage is the input resistance of the CG stage and XL is the re-
actance of the inductor in the drain of the CG stage, the voltage gain is
assuming the transconductances of both transistors are approximately the same. From the
equation you can see that the voltage gain increases with frequency because XL increases.
As the frequency continues to increase, eventually capacitance effects become significant
enough to begin reducing the gain.
The input resistance to the cascade amplifier is the input resistance to the CS stage.

FET AMPLIFIERS AND SWITCHING CIRCUITS
In a class D amplifier, the output transistors are operated as switches instead of operating
linearly as in the classes A, B, and AB. An advantage in audio applications is that a class D
amplifier can operate at a maximum theoretical efficiency of 100% compared to class A at
25% and class B/AB at 79%. In practice, efficiencies over 90% can be achieved with class D.
A basic block diagram of a class D amplifier driving a speaker is shown in Figure 9–25.
It consists of a pulse-width modulator driving complementary MOSFET output transistors
operating as switches and followed by a low-pass filter. Most class D amplifiers operate on
dual-polarity power supplies. The MOSFETs are basically push-pull amplifiers that are op-
erated as switching devices, rather than linear devices as in the case of class B amplifiers.

of amplifiers are generally implemented with either BJTs or FETs. The class D ampli-

the other classes because its output transistors are switched on and off in response to
an analog input instead of operating linearly over a continuous range of input values.

wider when the amplitude is positive and narrower when the amplitude is negative. The
output will be a square wave if the input is zero.
The PWM signal is typically produced using a comparator circuit. Comparators are dis-
cussed in more detail in Chapter 13, but here is a basic explanation of how they work. A

comparator has two inputs and one output, as shown by the symbol in Figure 9–27. The input
labeled + is called the noninverting input, and the input labeled  is the inverting input. When
the voltage on the inverting input exceeds the voltage on the noninverting input, the compara-
tor switches to its negative saturated output state. When the voltage on the noninverting input
exceeds the voltage on the inverting input, the comparator switches to its positive saturated
output state. This is illustrated in Figure 9–27 for one cycle of a sine wave voltage on the non-
inverting input and a higher frequency triangular wave voltage on the inverting input.

The comparator inputs are typically very small voltages (mV range); and the compara-
tor output is “rail-to-rail,” which means that the positive maximum is near the positive dc
supply voltage and the negative maximum is near the negative dc supply voltage. An out-
put of 
or 24 V peak-to-peak is not unusual. From this, you can see that the gain can
be quite high. For example, if the input signal is 10 mVpp, the voltage gain is 24 Vpp/
10 mVpp  2400. Since the comparator output amplitude is constant for a specified range
of input voltages, the gain is dependent on the input signal voltage. If the input signal is
100 mVpp, the output is still 24 Vpp, and the gain is 240 instead of 2400.
Frequency Spectra
All nonsinusoidal waveforms are made up of harmonic frequencies.
The frequency content of a particular waveform is called its spectrum. When the triangular
waveform modulates the input sine wave, the resulting spectrum contains the sine wave fre-
quency, finput, plus the fundamental frequency of the triangular modulating signal, fm, and har-
monic frequencies above and below the fundamental frequency. These harmonic frequencies

are due to the fast rise and fall times of the PWM signal and the flat areas between the pulses.
A simplified frequency spectrum of a PWM signal is shown in Figure 9–28. The frequency of
the triangular waveform must be significantly higher than the highest input signal frequency
so that the lowest frequency harmonic is well above the range of input signal frequencies.

The Complementary MOSFET Stage
The MOSFETs are arranged in a common-source complementary configuration to provide
power gain. Each transistor switches between the on state and the off state and when one tran-
sistor is on, the other one is off, as shown in Figure 9–29. When a transistor is on, there is very
little voltage across it and, therefore, there is very little power dissipated even though it may
have a high current through it. When a transistor is off, there is no current through it and,
therefore, there is no power dissipated. The only time power is dissipated in the transistors is
during the short switching time. Power delivered to a load can be very high because a load
will have a voltage across it nearly equal to the supply voltages and a high current through it.
Efficiency
When Q1 is on, it is providing current to the load. However, ideally the volt-
age across it is zero so the internal power dissipated by Q1 is
At the same time, Q2 is off and the current through it is zero, so the internal power is
Ideally, the output power to the load is 2VQIL. The maximum ideal efficiency is, therefore,

In a practical case, each MOSFET would have a few tenths of a volt across it in the on
state. There is also a small internal power dissipation in the comparator and triangular
wave generator. Also, power is dissipated during the finite switching time, so the ideal 
efficiency of 100% can never be reached in practice.
A certain class D amplifier dissipates an internal power of 100 mW in the comparator,
triangular-wave generator, and filter combined. Each MOSFET in the complementary
stage has a voltage of 0.4 V across it in the on state. The amplifier operates from
dc sources and provides 0.5 A to the load. Neglecting any voltage dropped
across the filter, determine the output power and the overall efficiency.
Solution

The low-pass filter removes the modulating frequency and harmonics and passes only the
original signal to the output. The filter has a bandwidth that passes only the input signal

Signal Flow

applied and pulse-width modulated to produce a PWM signal at the output of the modula-
tor where voltage gain is achieved. The PWM drives the complementary MOSFET stage to

MOSFET Switching Operation
E-MOSFETs are generally used for switching applications because of their threshold char-
acteristic, VGS(th). When the gate-to-source voltage is less than the threshold value, the
MOSFET is off. When the gate-to-source voltage is greater than the threshold value, the
MOSFET is on. When VGS is varied between VGS(th) and VGS(on), the MOSFET is being
operated as a switch, as illustrated in Figure 9–32. In the off state, when 
the
device is operating at the lower end of the load line and acts like an open switch (very high
RDS). When VGS is sufficently greater than VGS(th), the device is operating at the upper end
of the load line in the ohmic region and acts like a closed switch (very low RDS).
The Ideal Switch
Refer to Figure 9–33(a). When the gate voltage of the n-channel
MOSFET is V, the gate is more positive than the source by an amount exceeding VGS(th).
The MOSFET is on and appears as a closed switch between the drain and source. When
the gate voltage is zero, the gate-to-source voltage is 0 V. The MOSFET is off and appears
as an open switch between the drain and source.
Refer to Figure 9–33(b). When the gate voltage of the p-channel MOSFET is 0 V, the
gate is less positive than the source by an amount exceeding VGS(th). The MOSFET is on

The Analog Switch
MOSFETs are commonly used for switching analog signals. Basically, a signal applied to the
drain can be switched through to the source by a voltage on the gate. A major restriction is that
the signal level at the source must not cause the gate-to-source voltage to drop below VGS(th).
A basic n-channel MOSFET analog switch is shown in Figure 9–34. The signal at the
drain is connected to the source when the MOSFET is turned on by a positive VGS and is
disconnected when VGS is 0, as indicated.

Analog Switch Applications
Sampling Circuit
One application of analog switches is in analog-to-digital conversion.
The analog switch is used in a sample-and-hold circuit to sample the input signal at a cer-
tain rate. Each sampled signal value is then temporarily stored on a capacitor until it can be
converted to a digital code by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). To accomplish this,
the MOSFET is turned on for short intervals during one cycle of the input signal by pulses
applied to the gate. The basic operation, showing only a few samples for clarity, is illus-
trated in Figure 9–36.
A certain analog switch similar to the one shown in Figure 9–35 uses an n-channel
MOSFET with VGS(th)
2 V. A voltage of 
5 V is applied at the gate to turn the
switch on. Determine the maximum peak-to-peak input signal that can be applied, 
assuming no voltage drop across the switch.

must equal or exceed the threshold voltage. For maximum

When a gate pulse is at its high level, the switch is turned on and the small portion of the
input waveform occurring during that pulse appears on the output. When the pulse wave-
form is at its 0 V level, the switch is turned off and the output is also at 0 V.
An analog switch is used to sample an audio signal with a maximum frequency of 
8 kHz. Determine the minimum frequency of the pulses applied to the MOSFET gate.
Solution
The sampling frequency must be greater than 16 kHz.
Related Problem
What is the minimum sampling frequency if the highest frequency in the audio signal
is 12 kHz?
fsample (min) 7 2fsignal (max) = 2(8 kHz) = 16 kHz
EXAMPLE 9–14
Analog Multiplexer
Analog multiplexers are used where two or more signals are to be
routed to the same destination. For example, a two-channel analog sampling multiplexer is
shown in Figure 9–37. The MOSFETs are alternately turned on and off so that first one sig-
nal sample is connected to the output and then the other. The pulses are applied to the gate
of switch A, and the inverted pulses are applied to the gate of switch B. A digital circuit
known as an inverter is used for this. When the pulses are high, switch A is on and switch B
is off. When the pulses are low, switch B is on and switch A is off. This is called time-
division multiplexing because signal A appears on the output during time intervals when
the pulse is high and signal B appears during the time intervals when the pulse is low. That
is, they are interleaved on a time basis for transmission on a single line.
Switched-Capacitor Circuit
Another application of MOSFETs is in switched-capacitor
circuits commonly used in integrated circuit programmable analog devices known as
analog signal processors. Because capacitors can be implemented in ICs more easily than
a resistor, they are used to emulate resistors. Capacitors also take up less space on a chip
than an IC resistor and dissipate no power. Many types of analog circuits use resistors to
determine voltage gain and other characteristics and by using switched capacitors to emu-
late resistors, dynamic programming of analog circuits can be achieved.
For example, in a certain type of IC amplifier circuit that you will study later, two
external resistors are required as shown in Figure 9–38. The values of these resistors
establish the voltage gain of the amplifier as Av  R2/R1.

A switched-capacitor can be used to emulate a resistor as shown in Figure 9–39 using a
mechanical switch analogy (MOSFETs are actually used as the switches). Switch 1 and
switch 2 are alternately turned on and off at a certain frequency to charge or discharge C,
depending on the values of the voltage sources. In the case of R1 in Figure 9–38, Vin and V1
are represented by VA and VB, respectively. For R2, V1 and Vout are represented by VA and
VB, respectively.
It can be shown (see Appendix B) that the capacitor emulates a resistance with a value
that depends on the frequency at which the switches are turned on and off and the capaci-
tance value.
By changing the frequency, the effective resistance value can be altered.
Complementary E-MOSFETs and capacitors can be used to replace the resistors in the
amplifier, as shown in Figure 9–40. When Q1 is on, Q2 is off and vice versa. The frequency
f1 and C1 are selected to provide the required value of R1. Likewise, f2 and C2 provide the
required value of R2. To reprogram the amplifier for a different gain, the frequencies are

CMOS combines n-channel and p-channel E-MOSFETs in a series arrangement as shown
in Figure 9–41(a). The input voltage at the gates is either 0 V or VDD. Notice that VDD and
ground are both connected to source terminals of the transistors. To avoid confusion, the
term VDD is used for the positive voltage, which is on the p-channel device’s source terminal.
When Vin = 0 V, Q1 is on and Q2 is off, as shown in part (b). Because Q1 is acting as a
closed switch, the output is approximately VDD. When Vin = VDD, Q2 is on and Q1 is off, as
shown in part (c). Because Q2 is acting as a closed switch, the output is essentially con-
nected to ground (0 V).

A major advantage of CMOS is that it consumes very little dc power. Because the
MOSFETs are in series and one of them is always off, there is essentially no current from
the dc supply in the quiescent state. When the MOSFETs are switching, there is current for
a very short time because both transistors are on during this very short transition from one
state to the other.

Notice that the circuit in Figure 9–41 actually inverts the input because when
the input is 0 V or low, the output is VDD or high. When the input is VDD or high, the out-

The problem is approached in the following sequence.
Step 1: Determine what the voltage levels in the circuit should be so that you know
what to look for. First, pull a datasheet on the particular transistor (assume
both Q1 and Q2 are found to be the same type of transistor) and determine the
gm so that you can calculate the typical voltage gain. Assume that for this par-
ticular device, a typical gm of 
is specified. Calculate the expected
typical voltage gain of each stage (notice they are identical) based on the typ-
ical value of gm. The gm of actual devices may be any value between the spec-
ified minimum and maximum values. Because the input resistance is very
high, the second stage does not significantly load the first stage, as in a BJT
amplifier. So, the unloaded voltage gain for each stage is
Since the stages are identical, the typical overall gain should be
Assume the dc levels have been checked and verified. You are now ready to
move to ac signal checks.
Step 2: Arrange a test setup to permit connection of an input test signal, a dc supply
voltage, and ground to the circuit. The schematic shows that the dc supply
voltage must be +12 V. Choose 10 mV rms as an input test signal. This value
is arbitrary (although the capability of your signal source is a factor), but
small enough that the expected output signal voltage is well below the
absolute peak-to-peak limit of 12 V set by the supply voltage and ground
(you know that the output voltage swing cannot go higher than 12 V or lower
than 0 V). Set the frequency of the sinusoidal signal source to an arbitrary
value in the audio range (say 10 kHz) because you know this is an audio
amplifier. The audio frequency range is generally accepted as 20 Hz to 20 kHz.
Step 3: Check the input signal at the gate of Q1 and the output signal at the drain of
Q2 with an oscilloscope. The results are shown in Figure 9–47. The measured
output voltage has a peak value of 226 mV. The expected typical peak output
voltage is
The output is much less than it should be.
Step 4: Trace the signal from the output toward the input to determine the fault.
Figure 9–47 shows the oscilloscope displays of the measured signal
voltages. The voltage at the gate of Q2 is 106 mV peak, as expected
This signal is properly coupled from the drain
of Q1. Therefore, the problem lies in the second stage. From the oscilloscope
displays, the gain of Q2 is much lower than it should be (213 mV 100 mV =
2.13 instead of 7.5).
Step 5: Analyze the possible causes of the observed malfunction. There are three
possible reasons the gain is low:
1. Q2 has a lower transconductance (gm) than the specified typical value.
Check the datasheet to see if the minimum gm accounts for the lower
measured gain.
2. R5 has a lower value than shown on the schematic. An incorrect value
should show up with dc voltage checks, particularly if the value is much
different than specified, so this is not the likely cause in this case.
3. The bypass capacitor C4 is open.

FET AMPLIFIERS AND SWITCHING CIRCUITS
The best way to check the gm is by replacing Q2 with a new transistor of the
same type and rechecking the output signal. You can make certain that R5 is
the proper value by removing one end of the resistor from the circuit board
and measuring the resistance with an ohmmeter. To avoid having to unsolder
a component, the best way to start isolating the fault is by checking the signal
voltage at the source of Q2. If the capacitor is working properly, there will be
only a dc voltage at the source. The presence of a signal voltage at the source
indicates that C4 is open. With R6 unbypassed, the gain expression is
rather than simply gmRd, thus resulting in less gain.

SECTION 9–7 
CHECKUP
Application Activity: Active Antenna
In this application, a broadband JFET amplifier is used to provide a high input impedance
and voltage gain for a whip antenna. When an antenna is connected to the input of a
receiver or a coaxial cable, signal deterioration may be unacceptable due to a distant sta-
tion, noisy conditions, or an impedance mismatch. An active antenna can alleviate this
problem by providing a stronger signal. The block diagram in Figure 9–48 shows an
active antenna, followed by a low impedance output buffer to drive a coaxial cable or a
receiver input. The focus in this application is the active antenna. The low output imped-
ance buffer can be a BJT emitter-follower or an impedance-matching transformer.
The Amplifier Circuit
Figure 9–49 is a broadband amplifier using two JFETs in a cascode arrangement com-
monly used in RF (radio frequency) applications. The advantage of using a JFET is that
its high input impedance does not load the antenna and cause a reduction in signal volt-
age, resulting in poor signal reception. It also is a low noise device and can be located
close to the antenna before additional noise is picked up by the system. Generally, an
antenna produces signal voltages in the microvolt range, and any signal loss because of
loading or noise can significantly degrade the signal. The active antenna also provides a
large voltage gain that results in a stronger signal to the receiver with improved signal-to-
noise ratio. The active antenna is powered by a separate 9 V battery, which also provides
isolation from noise pickup in the signal lines and is located in an enclosed metal box to
provide additional isolation.

Cascode amplifier for active antenna.
This active antenna has a voltage gain of approximately 2000 at 88 MHz and a gain of
approximately 10,000 at 1 GHz which makes it applicable for the FM broadcast band,
some TV channel bands, some amateur radio (HAM) bands, cell phone bands, and many
others. Also below the FM band, the gain may be adequate for other radio and TV bands
as well, depending on receiver requirements. The coil can be changed to optimize gain
within a specified band or to adjust the band downward.
1. Research the Internet to determine the frequency band for TV channels 7–13.
2. Research the Internet to find the frequency bands allocated for cellular telephones.
3. What is the purpose of C2 in Figure 9–49?
The transistors used in the active antenna are 2N5484 n-channel JFETs. The partial
datasheet is shown in Figure 9–50.
4. Using the datasheet, determine RIN(gate) of the JFET (Q2).
5. What input resistance is presented to the antenna in Figure 9–49?
6. From the datasheet, what is the minimum forward transconductance?
Simulation
The active antenna circuit is simulated in Multisim with the antenna input represented by
a 
peak source. The output signal is shown for 88 MHz and 1 GHz inputs in Figure
9–51 on page 489.
7. What is the significance of the 88 MHz frequency?
8. Determine the rms output voltage in Figure 9–51(b) and (c), and calculate the gain
for both frequencies.
Simulate the active antenna circuit using your Multisim software. Measure the output
voltage at 10 MHz, 100 MHz, and 500 MHz.
Prototyping and Testing
Now that the circuit has been simulated, the prototype circuit is constructed and tested.
After the circuit is successfully tested, it is ready to be finalized. Because you are work-
ing at high frequencies where stray capacitances can cause unwanted resonant conditions,
the circuit layout is very critical.

Circuit Board
Certain considerations should be observed when laying out a printed circuit board for RF
circuits. EMI (electromagnetic interference), line inductance, and stray capacitance all
become important at high frequencies. A few basic features that should be incorporated
on an RF circuit board are
◆Keep traces as short and wide as possible.
◆Do not run parallel signal lines that are in close proximity.
◆Capacitively decouple supply voltages.
◆Provide a large ground plane for shielding and to minimize noise.

The Complete Active Antenna Unit
Typically, the active antenna circuit should be enclosed in a metal box for proper shielding,
similar to that shown in Figure 9–53. The particular configuration shown includes an
impedance-matching transformer connected to a type of connector (BNC) used with coaxial
cables for illustration. Other interface configurations, such as an emitter-follower output
may be used for interfacing. The particular antenna shown is a telescoping whip antenna.

FET AMPLIFIERS AND SWITCHING CIRCUITS
SUMMARY
Section 9–1
◆The transconductance, gm, of a FET relates the output current, Id, to the input voltage, Vgs.
◆The voltage gain of a common-source amplifier is determined largely by the transconductance,
gm, and the drain resistance, Rd.
◆The internal drain-to-source resistance, 
of a FET influences (reduces) the gain if it is not
sufficiently greater than Rd so that it can be neglected.
◆An unbypassed resistance between source and ground (RS) reduces the voltage gain of a FET
amplifier.
◆A load resistance connected to the drain of a common-source amplifier reduces the voltage gain.
◆There is a 
phase inversion between gate and drain voltages.
◆The input resistance at the gate of a FET is extremely high.
Section 9–2
◆The voltage gain of a common-drain amplifier (source-follower) is always slightly less than 1.
◆There is no phase inversion between gate and source in a source-follower.
Section 9–3
◆The input resistance of a common-gate amplifier is the reciprocal of gm.
◆The cascode amplifier combines a CS amplifier and a CG amplifier.
Section 9–4
◆The class D amplifier is a nonlinear amplifier because the transistors operate as switches.
◆The class D amplifier uses pulse-width modulation (PWM) to represent the input signal.
◆A low-pass filter converts the PWM signal back to the original input signal.
◆The efficiency of a class D amplifier approaches 100%.
Section 9–5
◆An analog switch passes or blocks an analog signal when turned on or off by a digital control input.
◆A sampling circuit is an analog switch that is turned on for short time intervals to allow a suffi-
cient number of discrete input signal values to appear on the output so that the input signal can
be accurately represented by those discrete values.
◆An analog multiplexer consists of two or more analog switches that connect sampled portions of
their analog input signals to a single output in a time sequence.
◆Switched-capacitors are used to emulate resistance in programmable IC analog arrays.
Section 9–6
◆Complementary MOS (CMOS) is used in low-power digital switching circuits.
◆CMOS uses an n-channel MOSFET and a p-channel MOSFET connected in series.
◆The inverter, NAND gate, and NOR gate are examples of digital logic circuits.

INTRODUCTION
In the previous chapters on amplifiers, the effects of the
input frequency on an amplifier’s operation due to capacitive
elements in the circuit were neglected in order to focus on
other concepts. The coupling and bypass capacitors were
considered to be ideal shorts and the internal transistor 
capacitances were considered to be ideal opens. This treatment
is valid when the frequency is in an amplifier’s midrange.
As you know, capacitive reactance decreases with increas-
ing frequency and vice versa. When the frequency is low
enough, the coupling and bypass capacitors can no longer 
be considered as shorts because their reactances are large
enough to have a significant effect. Also, when the frequency
is high enough, the internal transistor capacitances can no
longer be considered as opens because their reactances 
become small enough to have a significant effect on the ampli-
fier operation. A complete picture of an amplifier’s response
must take into account the full range of frequencies over 
which the amplifier can operate.
In this chapter, you will study the frequency effects on
amplifier gain and phase shift. The coverage applies to both
BJT and FET amplifiers, and a mix of both are included to 
illustrate the concepts.

AMPLIFIER FREQUENCY RESPONSE
10–1 BASIC CONCEPTS
In amplifiers, the coupling and bypass capacitors appear to be shorts to ac at the 
midband frequencies. At low frequencies the capacitive reactance of these capacitors
affect the gain and phase shift of signals, so they must be taken into account. The
frequency response of an amplifier is the change in gain or phase shift over a speci-
fied range of input signal frequencies.
After completing this section, you should be able to
❏Explain how circuit capacitances affect the frequency response of an amplifier
◆Define frequency response
❏Discuss the effect of coupling capacitors
◆Recall the formula for capacitive reactance
❏Discuss the effect of bypass capacitors
❏Describe the effect of internal transistor capacitances
◆Identify the internal capacitance in BJTs and JFETs
❏Explain Miller’s theorem
◆Calculate the Miller input and output capacitances
Effect of Coupling Capacitors
Recall from basic circuit theory that 
This formula shows that the capaci-
tive reactance varies inversely with frequency. At lower frequencies the reactance is greater,
and it decreases as the frequency increases. At lower frequencies—for example, audio fre-
quencies below 10 Hz—capacitively coupled amplifiers such as those in Figure 10–1 have
less voltage gain than they have at higher frequencies. The reason is that at lower frequen-
cies more signal voltage is dropped across C1 and C3 because their reactances are higher.
This higher signal voltage drop at lower frequencies reduces the voltage gain. Also, a phase
shift is introduced by the coupling capacitors because C1 forms a lead circuit with the Rin of
the amplifier and C3 forms a lead circuit with RL in series with RC or RD. Recall that a lead
circuit is an RC circuit in which the output voltage across R leads the input voltage in phase.

affect an amplifier’s response. Internal transistor junction capacitances, however, do come into
play, reducing an amplifier’s gain and introducing phase shift as the signal frequency increases.
Figure 10–3 shows the internal pn junction capacitances for both a bipolar junction
transistor and a JFET. In the case of the BJT, Cbe is the base-emitter junction capacitance
and Cbc is the base-collector junction capacitance. In the case of the JFET, Cgs is the ca-
pacitance between gate and source and Cgd is the capacitance between gate and drain.

Internal transistor capacitances.
Datasheets often refer to the BJT capacitance Cbc as the output capacitance, often des-
ignated Cob. The capacitance Cbe is often designated as the input capacitance Cib.
Datasheets for FETs normally specify input capacitance Ciss and reverse transfer capaci-
tance Crss. From these, Cgs and Cgd can be calculated, as you will see in Section 10–4.
At lower frequencies, the internal capacitances have a very high reactance because of their
low capacitance value (usually only a few picofarads) and the low frequency value. There-
fore, they look like opens and have no effect on the transistor’s performance. As the frequency
goes up, the internal capacitive reactances go down, and at some point they begin to have a sig-
nificant effect on the transistor’s gain. When the reactance of Cbe (or Cgs) becomes small
enough, a significant amount of the signal voltage is lost due to a voltage-divider effect of the
signal source resistance and the reactance of Cbe, as illustrated in Figure 10–4(a). When the

reactance of Cbc (or Cgd) becomes small enough, a significant amount of output signal voltage
is fed back out of phase with the input (negative feedback), thus effectively reducing the volt-
age gain. This is illustrated in Figure 10–4(b).
Miller’s Theorem
Miller’s theorem is used to simplify the analysis of inverting amplifiers at high frequencies
where the internal transistor capacitances are important. The capacitance Cbc in BJTs (Cgd
in FETs) between the input (base or gate) and the output (collector or drain) is shown in
Figure 10–5(a) in a generalized form. Av is the absolute voltage gain of the inverting 
amplifier at midrange frequencies, and C represents either Cbc or Cgd.

Miller’s theorem states that C effectively appears as a capacitance from input to ground,
as shown in Figure 10–5(b), that can be expressed as follows:
Equation 10–1
This formula shows that Cbc (or Cgd) has a much greater impact on input capacitance than
its actual value. For example, if Cbc  6 pF and the amplifier gain is 50, then Cin(Miller) 
306 pF. Figure 10–6 shows how this effective input capacitance appears in the actual ac
equivalent circuit in parallel with Cbe (or Cgs).

Miller’s theorem also states that C effectively appears as a capacitance from output to
ground, as shown in Figure 10–5(b), that can be expressed as follows:

This formula indicates that if the voltage gain is 10 or greater, Cout(Miller) is approximately
equal to Cbc or Cgd because (Av  1) Av is approximately equal to 1. Figure 10–6 also

THE DECIBEL
◆
509
The use of decibels to express gain was introduced in Chapter 6. The decibel unit is im-
portant in amplifier measurements. The basis for the decibel unit stems from the logarith-
mic response of the human ear to the intensity of sound. The decibel is a logarithmic
measurement of the ratio of one power to another or one voltage to another. Power gain is
expressed in decibels (dB) by the following formula:
1. In an ac amplifier, which capacitors affect the low-frequency gain?
2. How is the high-frequency gain of an amplifier limited?
3. When can coupling and bypass capacitors be neglected?
4. Determine Cin(Miller) if Av  50 and Cbc  5 pF.
5. Determine Cout(Miller) if Av  25 and Cbc  3 pF.

AMPLIFIER FREQUENCY RESPONSE
0 dB Reference
It is often convenient in amplifiers to assign a certain value of gain as the 0 dB reference.
This does not mean that the actual voltage gain is 1 (which is 0 dB); it means that the ref-
erence gain, no matter what its actual value, is used as a reference with which to compare
other values of gain and is therefore assigned a 0 dB value.
Many amplifiers exhibit a maximum gain over a certain range of frequencies and a
reduced gain at frequencies below and above this range. The maximum gain occurs for the
range of frequencies between the upper and lower critical frequencies and is called the
midrange gain, which is assigned a 0 dB value. Any value of gain below midrange can 
be referenced to 0 dB and expressed as a negative dB value. For example, if the midrange
voltage gain of a certain amplifier is 100 and the gain at a certain frequency below midrange
is 50, then this reduced voltage gain can be expressed as 
This indicates that it is 6 dB below the 0 dB reference. Halving the output voltage
for a steady input voltage is always a 6 dB reduction in the gain. Correspondingly, a dou-
bling of the output voltage is always a 6 dB increase in the gain. Figure 10–7 illustrates a
normalized gain-versus-frequency curve showing several dB points. The term normalized
means that the midrange voltage gain is assigned a value of 1 or 0 dB.

*Answers can be found at www.pearsonhighered.com/floyd.
Table 10–1 shows how doubling or halving voltage gains translates into decibel values.
Notice in the table that every time the voltage gain is doubled, the decibel value increases
by 6 dB, and every time the gain is halved, the dB value decreases by 6 dB.
Critical Frequency
A critical frequency (also known as cutoff frequency or corner frequency) is a frequency
at which the output power drops to one-half of its midrange value. This corresponds to a
3 dB reduction in the power gain, as expressed in dB by the following formula:
Ap(dB) = 10 log (0.5) = -3 dB
The factor of 20 in Equation 10–4
is because power is proportional to
voltage squared. Technically, the
equation should be applied only
when the voltages are measured in
the same impedance. This is the
case for many communication
systems, such as in television or
microwave systems.

Power Measurement in dBm
The dBm is a unit for measuring power levels referenced to 1 mW. Positive dBm values
represent power levels above 1 mW, and negative dBm values represent power levels
below 1 mW.
Because the decibel (dB) can be used to represent only power ratios, not actual power,
the dBm provides a convenient way to express actual power output of an amplifier or other
device. Each 3 dBm increase corresponds to a doubling of the power, and a 3 dBm de-
crease corresponds to a halving of the power.
To state that an amplifier has a 3 dB power gain indicates only that the output power is
twice the input power and nothing about the actual output power. To indicate actual output
The unit of dBmV is used in some
applications such as cable TV
where the reference level is 1 mV,
which corresponds to 0 dB. Just as
the dBm is used to indicate actual
power, the dBmV unit is used to
indicate actual voltage.

The voltage gain and phase shift of capacitively coupled amplifiers are affected when
the signal frequency is below a critical value. At low frequencies, the reactance of the

an increase in phase shift. Frequency responses of both BJT and FET capacitively

One RC circuit is formed by the input coupling capacitor C1 and the input resistance of
the amplifier. The second RC circuit is formed by the output coupling capacitor C3, the re-
sistance looking in at the collector 
, and the load resistance. The third RC circuit that
affects the low-frequency response is formed by the emitter-bypass capacitor C2 and the
resistance looking in at the emitter.
The Input RC Circuit
The input RC circuit for the BJT amplifier in Figure 10–8 is formed by C1 and the ampli-
fier’s input resistance and is shown in Figure 10–10. (Input resistance was discussed in
Chapter 6.) As the signal frequency decreases, XC1 increases. This causes less voltage
across the input resistance of the amplifier at the base because more voltage is dropped
across C1 and because of this, the overall voltage gain of the amplifier is reduced. The base
voltage for the input RC circuit in Figure 10–10 (neglecting the internal resistance of the
input signal source) can be stated as

Voltage Gain Roll-Off at Low Frequencies
As you have seen, the input RC circuit re-
duces the overall voltage gain of an amplifier by 3 dB when the frequency is reduced to the
critical value fc. As the frequency continues to decrease below fc, the overall voltage gain also
continues to decrease. The rate of decrease in voltage gain with frequency is called roll-off.
For each ten times reduction in frequency below fc, there is a 20 dB reduction in voltage gain.

The dB attenuation is
The Bode Plot
A ten-times change in frequency is called a decade. So, for the input RC
circuit, the attenuation is reduced by 20 dB for each decade that the frequency decreases
below the critical frequency. This causes the overall voltage gain to drop 20 dB per decade.
A plot of dB voltage gain versus frequency on semilog graph paper (logarithmic hori-
zontal axis scale and a linear vertical axis scale) is called a Bode plot. A generalized Bode
plot for an input RC circuit appears in Figure 10–12. The ideal response curve is shown in
blue. Notice that it is flat (0 dB) down to the critical frequency, at which point the gain
drops at 
as shown. Above fc are the midrange frequencies. The actual
response curve is shown in red. Notice that it decreases gradually beginning in midrange
and is down to

AMPLIFIER FREQUENCY RESPONSE
The Output RC Circuit
The second high-pass RC circuit in the BJT amplifier of Figure 10–8 is formed by the cou-
pling capacitor C3, the resistance looking in at the collector, and the load resistance RL, as
shown in Figure 10–15(a). In determining the output resistance, looking in at the collector,
the transistor is treated as an ideal current source (with infinite internal resistance), and the
upper end of RC is effectively at ac ground, as shown in Figure 10–15(b). Therefore, thev-
enizing the circuit to the left of capacitor C3 produces an equivalent voltage source equal to
the collector voltage and a series resistance equal to RC, as shown in Figure 10–15(c). The
lower critical frequency of this output RC circuit is

The effect of the output RC circuit on the amplifier voltage gain is similar to that of the
input RC circuit. As the signal frequency decreases, XC3 increases. This causes less voltage
across the load resistance because more voltage is dropped across C3. The signal voltage is
reduced by a factor of 0.707 when frequency is reduced to the lower critical value, fcl, for
the circuit. This corresponds to a 3 dB reduction in voltage gain.

The Bypass RC Circuit
The third RC circuit that affects the low-frequency gain of the BJT amplifier in Figure

quencies, it is assumed that

the amplifier gain is 
as you already know. As the frequency is reduced, XC2 increases
and no longer provides a sufficiently low reactance to effectively place the emitter at ac
ground, as shown in part (b). Because the impedance from emitter to ground increases, the
gain decreases. In this case, Re in the formula, 
is replaced by an imped-
ance formed by RE in parallel with XC2.
The bypass RC circuit is formed by C2 and the resistance looking in at the emitter,

Total Low-Frequency Response of an Amplifier
Now that we have individually examined the high-pass RC circuits that affect a BJT or FET
amplifier’s voltage gain at low frequencies, let’s look at the combined effect of the three RC
circuits in a BJT amplifier. Each circuit has a critical frequency determined by the R and C
values. The critical frequencies of the three RC circuits are not necessarily all equal. If one of
the RC circuits has a critical (break) frequency higher than the other two, then it is the
dominant RC circuit. The dominant circuit determines the frequency at which the overall
voltage gain of the amplifier begins to drop at 
The other circuits each cause
an additional 
dB/decade roll-off below their respective critical (break) frequencies.
To get a better picture of what happens at low frequencies, refer to the Bode plot in
Figure 10–25, which shows the superimposed ideal responses for the three RC circuits
(green lines) of a BJT amplifier. In this example, each RC circuit has a different critical fre-
quency. The input RC circuit is dominant (highest fc) in this case, and the bypass RC circuit
has the lowest fc. The ideal overall response is shown as the blue line.
Here is what happens. As the frequency is reduced from midrange, the first “break
point” occurs at the critical frequency of the input RC circuit, fcl(input), and the gain begins
to drop at 
This constant roll-off rate continues until the critical frequency
of the output RC circuit, fcl(output), is reached. At this break point, the output RC circuit
adds another 
dB/decade to make a total roll-off of

dB/decade roll-off continues until the critical frequency of the bypass RC circuit,
fcl(bypass), is reached. The bypass RC circuit adds still another 
dB/decade at this break
point, making the gain roll-off at 
dB/decade.
If all RC circuits have the same critical frequency, the response curve has one break
point at that value of fcl, and the voltage gain rolls off at 
dB/decade below that value,
as shown by the ideal curve (blue) in Figure 10–26. Actually, the midrange voltage gain
does not extend down to the dominant critical frequency but is really at 
dB below the
midrange voltage gain at that point (

AMPLIFIER FREQUENCY RESPONSE
Computer Simulation of Frequency Response
As you saw in the previous example, the calculation of multiple critical frequencies is 
involved and each critical frequency contributes to the overall response. The ideal response
shown in Example 10–9 is an excellent first approximation, but when more accuracy is 
required, a computer simulation is used. The computer takes into account all of the param-
eters for the particular device including effects such as internal capacitances that are usually
ignored in manual calculations, and it can calculate in detail the interactions that occur
when there are multiple breakpoints as in Example 10–9.
Multisim is based on SPICE models that can show the frequency response of circuits on
the Bode plotter. As mentioned earlier, the Bode plotter is not a real instrument. It performs
the same function as an instrument called the spectrum analyzer, which can also plot the
frequency response of a circuit. Example 10–10 illustrates the application of computer
analysis to the circuit in the previous example. 
SPICE was one of the first computer
programs that could simulate
electronic circuits. Its origins can be
traced to a program called CANCER
(Computer Analysis of Nonlinear
Circuits, Excluding Radiation) at the
University of California. It was
developed as a computer aid for
designing integrated circuits in the
1960s. SPICE is an acronym for
Simulation Program with Integrated
Circuit Emphasis. Over the years,
SPICE has been revised many times
but is still the underlying software
for many of today’s simulations.

10–4 HIGH-FREQUENCY AMPLIFIER RESPONSE
You have seen how the coupling and bypass capacitors affect the voltage gain of an
amplifier at lower frequencies where the reactances of the coupling and bypass capaci-
tors are significant. In the midrange of an amplifier, the effects of the capacitors are
minimal and can be neglected. If the frequency is increased sufficiently, a point is
reached where the transistor’s internal capacitances begin to have a significant effect
on the gain. The basic differences between BJTs and FETs are the specifications of the
internal capacitances and the input resistance.

BJT Amplifiers
A high-frequency ac equivalent circuit for the BJT amplifier in Figure 10–31(a) is shown
in Figure 10–31(b). Notice that the coupling and bypass capacitors are treated as effective
shorts and do not appear in the equivalent circuit. The internal capacitances, Cbe and Cbc,
which are significant only at high frequencies, do appear in the diagram. As previously
mentioned. Cbe is sometimes called the input capacitance Cib, and Cbc is sometimes called
the output capacitance Cob. Cbe is specified on datasheets at a certain value of VBE. Often,
a datasheet will list Cib as Cibo and Cob as Cobo. The o as the last letter in the subscript in-
dicates the capacitance is measured with the base open. For example, a 2N2222A transis-
tor has a Cbe of 25 pF at VBE  0.5 V dc, IC  0, and f  1 MHz. Also, Cbc is specified at
a certain value of VBC. The 2N2222A has a maximum Cbc of 8 pF at VBC  10 V dc.

By applying Miller’s theorem to the
inverting amplifier in Figure 10–31(b) and using the midrange voltage gain, you have a circuit

that can be analyzed for high-frequency response. Looking in from the signal source, the
capacitance Cbc appears in the Miller input capacitance from base to ground.
Cbe simply appears as a capacitance to ac ground, as shown in Figure 10–32, in parallel
with Cin(Miller). Looking in at the collector, Cbc appears in the Miller output capacitance
from collector to ground. As shown in Figure 10–32, the Miller output capacitance appears
in parallel with Rc.
These two Miller capacitances create a high-frequency input RC circuit and a high-
frequency output RC circuit. These two circuits differ from the low-frequency input and
output circuits, which act as high-pass filters, because the capacitances go to ground and
therefore act as low-pass filters. The equivalent circuit in Figure 10–32 is an ideal model
because stray capacitances that are due to circuit interconnections are neglected.

The Input RC Circuit
At high frequencies, the input circuit is as shown in Figure 10–33(a), where 
is the
input resistance at the base of the transistor because the bypass capacitor effectively shorts
the emitter to ground. By combining Cbe and Cin(Miller) in parallel and repositioning, you
get the simplified circuit shown in Figure 10–33(b). Next, by thevenizing the circuit to the
left of the capacitor, as indicated, the input RC circuit is reduced to the equivalent form
shown in Figure 10–33(c).
As the frequency increases, the capacitive reactance becomes smaller. This causes the
signal voltage at the base to decrease, so the amplifier’s voltage gain decreases. The reason
for this is that the capacitance and resistance act as a voltage divider and, as the frequency
increases, more voltage is dropped across the resistance and less across the capacitance. At
the critical frequency, the gain is 3 dB less than its midrange value. The upper critical high

AMPLIFIER FREQUENCY RESPONSE
Phase Shift of the Input RC Circuit
Because the output voltage of a high-frequency
input RC circuit is across the capacitor, the output of the circuit lags the input. The phase
angle is expressed as
Equation 10–17
At the critical frequency, the phase angle is 
with the signal voltage at the base of the
transistor lagging the input signal. As the frequency increases above fc, the phase angle in-
creases above 
and approaches 
when the frequency is sufficiently high.
The Output RC Circuit
The high-frequency output RC circuit is formed by the Miller output capacitance and the
resistance looking in at the collector, as shown in Figure 10–36(a). In determining the out-
put resistance, the transistor is treated as a current source (open) and one end of RC is
effectively ac ground, as shown in Figure 10–36(b). By rearranging the position of the
capacitance in the diagram and thevenizing the circuit to the left, as shown in Figure
10–36(c), you get the equivalent circuit in Figure 10–36(d). The equivalent output RC cir-
cuit consists of a resistance equal to the parallel combination of RC and RL in series with a
capacitance that is determined by the following Miller formula:
If the voltage gain is at least 10, this formula can be approximated as

FET Amplifiers
The approach to the high-frequency analysis of a FET amplifier is similar to that of a BJT
amplifier. The basic differences are the specifications of the internal FET capacitances and
the determination of the input resistance.
Figure 10–39(a) shows a JFET common-source amplifier that will be used to illustrate
high-frequency analysis. A high-frequency equivalent circuit for the amplifier is shown in
Figure 10–39(b). Notice that the coupling and bypass capacitors are assumed to have neg-
ligible reactances and are considered to be shorts. The internal capacitances Cgs and Cgd
appear in the equivalent circuit because their reactances are significant at high frequencies.

FET datasheets do not normally provide values for Cgs, Cgd,

output capacitance. Because of the manufacturer’s method of measurement, the following

Using Miller’s Theorem
Miller’s theorem is applied the same way in FET inverting am-
plifier high-frequency analysis as was done in BJT amplifiers. Looking in from the signal
source in Figure 10–39(b), Cgd effectively appears in the Miller input capacitance, which
was given in Equation 10–1, as follows:
Cgs simply appears as a capacitance to ac ground in parallel with Cin(Miller), as shown in
Figure 10–40. Looking in at the drain, Cgd effectively appears in the Miller output
capacitance (from Equation 10–2) from drain to ground in parallel with Rd, as shown in
Figure 10–40.
These two Miller capacitances contribute to a high-frequency input RC circuit and a high-
frequency output RC circuit. Both are low-pass filters, which produce phase lag.

Figure 10–45(b) shows a generalized ideal response curve (Bode plot) for the BJT
amplifier shown in Figure 10–45(a). As previously discussed, the three break points at the
lower critical frequencies ( fcl1, fcl2, and fcl3) are produced by the three low-frequency RC
circuits formed by the coupling and bypass capacitors. The break points at the upper criti-
cal frequencies, fcu1 and fcu2, are produced by the two high-frequency RC circuits formed
by the transistor’s internal capacitances.
Of particular interest are the two dominant critical frequencies, fcl3 and fcu1, in Figure
10–45(b). These two frequencies are where the voltage gain of the amplifier is 3 dB below
its midrange value. These dominant frequencies are designated fcl(dom) and fcu(dom).
The upper and lower dominant critical frequencies are sometimes called the half-power
frequencies. This term is derived from the fact that the output power of an amplifier at its
critical frequencies is one-half of its midrange power, as previously mentioned. This can be
shown as follows, starting with the fact that the output voltage is 0.707 of its midrange
value at the dominant critical frequencies.
Bandwidth
An amplifier normally operates with signal frequencies between fcl(dom) and fcu(dom). As
you know, when the input signal frequency is at fcl(dom) or fcu(dom), the output signal voltage
level is 70.7% of its midrange value or 
If the signal frequency drops below fcl(dom),
the gain and thus the output signal level drops at 20 dB/decade until the next critical fre-
quency is reached. The same occurs when the signal frequency goes above fcu(dom).
The range (band) of frequencies lying between fcl(dom) and fcu(dom) is defined as the
bandwidth of the amplifier, as illustrated in Figure 10–46. Only the dominant critical fre-
quencies appear in the response curve because they determine the bandwidth. Also, some-
times the other critical frequencies are far enough away from the dominant frequencies that
they play no significant role in the total amplifier response and can be neglected. The
amplifier’s bandwidth is expressed in units of hertz as
-3 dB.

Ideally, all signal frequencies lying in an amplifier’s bandwidth are amplified equally. For
example, if a 10 mV rms signal is applied to an amplifier with a voltage gain of 20, it is

EXAMPLE 10–16
Gain-Bandwidth Product
One characteristic of amplifiers is that the product of the voltage gain and the bandwidth is
always constant when the roll-off is 
This characteristic is called the gain-
bandwidth product. Let’s assume that the dominant lower critical frequency of a particu-
lar amplifier is much less than the dominant upper critical frequency.
The bandwidth can then be approximated as
Unity-Gain Frequency
The simplified Bode plot for this condition is shown in Figure
10–47. Notice that fcl(dom) is neglected because it is so much smaller than fcu(dom), and the
bandwidth approximately equals fcu(dom). Beginning at fcu(dom), the gain rolls off until unity
gain (0 dB) is reached. The frequency at which the amplifier’s gain is 1 is called the unity-
gain frequency, fT. The significance of fT is that it always equals the midrange voltage gain
times the bandwidth and is constant for a given transistor.

10–6 FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF MULTISTAGE AMPLIFIERS
To this point, you have seen how the voltage gain of a single-stage amplifier changes
over frequency. When two or more stages are cascaded to form a multistage amplifier,
the overall frequency response is determined by the frequency response of each stage
depending on the relationships of the critical frequencies.
After completing this section, you should be able to

◆Determine the overall bandwidth
❏Analyze the case where the stages have equal critical frequencies
◆Determine the overall bandwidth
❏Simulate a two-stage amplifier using Multisim
When amplifier stages are cascaded to form a multistage amplifier, the dominant fre-
quency response is determined by the responses of the individual stages. There are two
cases to consider:
1. Each stage has a different dominant lower critical frequency and a different domi-
nant upper critical frequency.

2. Each stage has the same dominant lower critical frequency and the same dominant

Different Critical Frequencies
Ideally, when the dominant lower critical frequency, fcl(dom), of each amplifier stage is dif-
ferent from the other stages, the overall dominant lower critical frequency, 
equals
the dominant critical frequency of the stage with the highest fcl(dom).
Ideally, when the dominant upper critical frequency, fcu(dom), of each amplifier stage is
different from the other stages, the overall dominant upper critical frequency, 
equals the dominant critical frequency of the stage with the lowest fcu(dom).
In practice, the critical frequencies interact, so these calculated values should be con-
sidered approximations that are useful for troubleshooting or estimating the response.
When more accuracy is required, a computer simulation is the best solution.
Overall Bandwidth
The bandwidth of a multistage amplifier is the difference between the
overall dominant lower critical frequency and the overall dominant upper critical frequency.

Equal Critical Frequencies
When each amplifier stage in a multistage arrangement has equal dominant critical fre-
quencies, you may think that the overall dominant critical frequency is equal to the critical
frequency of each stage. This is not the case, however.
When the dominant lower critical frequencies of each stage in a multistage amplifier are all
the same, the overall dominant lower critical frequency is increased by a factor of 
as shown by the following formula (n is the number of stages in the multistage amplifier):
1>221>n - 1
When the dominant upper critical frequencies of each stage are all the same, the overall
dominant upper critical frequency is reduced by a factor of 221>n - 1.

Computer Simulation for Multistage Amplifiers
With multistage amplifiers, the detailed calculation of the frequency response is greatly
simplified by computer simulation. There are several interactions within each stage and
other interactions between the stages that affect the overall response. When you need more
accuracy, a computer simulation is used. This is particularly useful in design work because
you can change a component and see the effect immediately on the frequency response. The
following example illustrates the application of computer analysis to a multistage amplifier.

AMPLIFIER FREQUENCY RESPONSE
dual-channel oscilloscope connected to the input and to the output. The input frequency is
set to a midrange value, and its amplitude is adjusted to establish an output signal refer-
ence level, as shown in Figure 10–50(b). This output voltage reference level for midrange
should be set at a convenient value within the linear operation of the amplifier: for exam-
ple, 100 mV, 1 V, 10 V, and so on. In this case, set the output signal to a peak value of 1 V.
Next, the frequency of the input voltage is decreased until the peak value of the output
drops to 0.707 V. The amplitude of the input voltage must be kept constant as the fre-
quency is reduced. Readjustment may be necessary because of changes in loading of the
voltage source with frequency. When the output is 0.707 V, the frequency is measured, and
you have the value for fcl as indicated in Figure 10–50(c).
Next, the input frequency is increased back up through midrange and beyond until the
peak value of the output voltage again drops to 0.707 V. Again, the amplitude of the
input must be kept constant as the frequency is increased. When the output is 0.707 V,
the frequency is measured and you have the value for fcu as indicated in Figure 10–50(d).
From these two frequency measurements, you can find the bandwidth by the formula
Step-Response Measurement
The lower and upper critical frequencies of an amplifier can be determined using the step-
response method by applying a voltage step to the input of the amplifier and measuring
the rise and fall times of the resulting output voltage. The basic test setup shown in Figure
10–50(a) is used except that the pulse output of the function generator is selected. The
input step is created by the rising edge of a pulse that has a long duration compared to
the rise and fall times to be measured. The rise time of the input pulse must be fast
compared to the rise time you measure from the amplifier.
High-Frequency Measurement
When a step input is applied, the amplifier’s high-
frequency RC circuits (internal capacitances) prevent the output from responding immedi-
ately to the step input. As a result, the output voltage has a rise time (tr) associated with it,
as shown in Figure 10–51(a). In fact, the rise time is inversely related to the upper critical
frequency (fcu) of the amplifier. As fcu becomes lower, the rise time of the output becomes
greater. The oscilloscope display illustrates how the rise time is measured from the 10%
amplitude point to the 90% amplitude point. The scope must be set on a short time base so
the relatively short interval of the rise time can be accurately observed. Once this measure-
ment is made, fcu can be calculated with the following formula:
BW = fcu - fcl.

Low-Frequency Measurement
To determine the lower critical frequency ( fcl) of the
amplifier, the step input must be of sufficiently long duration to observe the full charging
time of the low-frequency RC circuits (coupling capacitances), which cause the “sloping”
of the output and which we will refer to as the fall time (tf). This is illustrated in Figure
10–51(b). The fall time is inversely related to the low critical frequency of the amplifier.
As fcl becomes higher, the fall time of the output becomes less. The scope display illus-
trates how the fall time is measured from the 90% point to the 10% point. The scope must
be set on a long time base so the complete interval of the fall time can be observed. Once
this measurement is made, fcl can be determined with the following formula.

Application Activity: Frequency Analysis of Audio Amplifier
A utility company is interested in purchasing a large quantity of the PA systems that were
developed in the Application Activities in Chapters 6 and 7. Because the company fre-
quently works near high-voltage power lines, where 60 Hz interference is common, it has
requested that the PA systems be designed to minimize pickup from power lines. You
have been assigned to analyze the frequency response of the PA system and determine the
best way to avoid the 60 Hz interference. The modified PA system will be marketed only
for voice communication.
The audio frequency spectrum is defined to be the range of frequencies from 20 Hz to
20 kHz. However, the range of frequencies of the human voice is generally accepted to be
between 300 Hz and 3 kHz. Based on this, the audio amplifier is to be redesigned for a
cutoff (critical) frequency in order to minimize the 60 Hz interference.
The utility company has requested that the gain at 60 Hz should be down by a minimum
of 
from the midrange gain for the units it is purchasing. The high-frequency
response of the amplifier is no concern at this point, as long as it is greater than approxi-
mately 3 kHz.
The original audio amplifier, shown in Figure 10–52 and in the simulation of Figure
10–53, has a dominant lower critical frequency of 16 Hz as indicated on the Bode plotter
in Figure 10–53(c). In order to meet the new specification for a lower critical frequency
of 300 Hz, the amplifier must be modified with lower capacitance values.

AMPLIFIER FREQUENCY RESPONSE
Moving the Bode plotter cursor down until the gain is approximately 3 dB below
midrange, or 30.3 dB, results in a lower critical frequency of 16 Hz at this gain setting
(note that there is a small effect on the response for different gains due to a different
path for C4 to charge and discharge). This verifies that the response of the preamp
includes the potentially troublesome 60 Hz interference.
Modification to Increase the Overall Lower Critical Frequency
Capacitor values must be reduced to achieve a critical frequency of 
The
approach, in this case, will be to use C1 and C3 to set the new dominant critical frequency.
C2 and C5 will be used to produce a faster roll-off below 60 Hz. C4 will be left at 
to avoid a change in frequency response when the gain is changed.
C1 is part of the stage 1 input circuit, and C3 is part of the stage 2 input circuit. These
capacitor values will determine the proper dominant lower critical frequencies required to
achieve an overall dominant critical frequency of 300 Hz.
Multistage Frequency Response
When the lower critical frequencies of each stage are
equal, Equation 10–29 applies. The overall dominant lower critical frequency, 
is
300 Hz. Solving the equation for the dominant lower critical frequency of each stage,
you get
Setting the dominant critical frequency of both stages of the amplifier to 193 Hz will pro-
duce an overall dominant lower critical frequency of 300 Hz. Using the frequency analy-
sis that was done for the original circuit as a guide, do the following calculations.
1. Calculate the value of C1 to produce a lower critical frequency of 193 Hz.
2. Calculate the value of C3 to produce a lower critical frequency of 193 Hz.
The results of your calculation should agree with the values shown in Figure 10–54. The
value for C2 is the next lower available value in Multisim.
The Multisim circuit with reduced capacitor values is shown in Figure 10–54(a). As
you can see in part (c), the new critical frequency is 276.604 Hz, which is within the
specified 10% tolerance of 300 Hz. The gain is 9.744 dB for a frequency near 60 Hz with
the volume setting at 85%, as shown in part (d).
3. From the Bode plots in Figure 10–54, determine how much the gain at 60 Hz is
down from the midrange gain.
Simulate the preamp circuit using your Multisim software. Observe the operation 
with the Bode plotter.
Prototyping and Testing
Now that the revised circuit has been simulated and its operation verified, the modifications
are made to the circuit and it is constructed and tested. After the circuit is successfully
tested on a protoboard, it is ready to be finalized on a printed circuit board.

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter, several types of semiconductor devices are
introduced. A family of devices known as thyristors are con-
structed of four semiconductor layers (pnpn). Thyristors in-
clude the 4-layer diode, the silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR),
the diac, the triac, and the silicon-controlled switch (SCS).
These types of thyristors share certain common characteris-
tics in addition to their four-layer construction. They act as
open circuits capable of withstanding a certain rated voltage
until they are triggered. When triggered, they turn on and
become low-resistance current paths and remain so, even
after the trigger is removed, until the current is reduced to a
certain level or until they are triggered off, depending on the
type of device. Thyristors can be used to control the amount
of ac power to a load and are used in lamp dimmers, motor
speed controls, ignition systems, and charging circuits, to
name a few.
Other devices described in this chapter include the uni-
junction transistor (UJT) and the programmable unijunction
transistor (PUT). UJTs and PUTs are used as trigger devices
for thyristors and also in oscillators and timing circuits.

Shockley Diode
The 4-layer diode (also known as Shockley diode and SUS) is a type of thyristor, which
is a class of devices constructed of four semiconductor layers. The basic construction of a
4-layer diode and its schematic symbol are shown in Figure 11–1.
The pnpn structure can be represented by an equivalent circuit consisting of a pnp tran-
sistor and an npn transistor, as shown in Figure 11–2(a). The upper pnp layers form 
and
the lower npn layers form 
with the two middle layers shared by both equivalent transis-
tors. Notice that the base-emitter junction of 
corresponds to pn junction 1 in Figure 11–1,
the base-emitter junction of 
corresponds to pn junction 3, and the base-collector
junctions of both 
and 
correspond to pn junction 2.
When a positive bias voltage is applied to the anode with respect to the cathode, as
shown in Figure 11–2(b), the base-emitter junctions of 
and 
(pn junctions 1 and 3 in
Figure 11–1(a)) are forward-biased, and the common base-collector junction ( pn junction
2 in Figure 11–1(a)) is reverse-biased.

11–1 THE FOUR-LAYER DIODE
The basic thyristor is a 4-layer device with two terminals, the anode and the
cathode. It is constructed of four semiconductor layers that form a pnpn structure.
The device acts as a switch and remains off until the forward voltage reaches a
certain value; then it turns on and conducts. Conduction continues until the
current is reduced below a specified value. Although the 4-layer diode is seldom
used in new designs, the principles form the basis of other thyristors that you
will study.

Forward-Breakover Voltage
The operation of the 4-layer diode may seem unusual be-
cause when it is forward-biased, it can act essentially as an open switch. There is a region
of forward bias, called the forward-blocking region, in which the device has a very high
forward resistance (ideally an open) and is in the off state. The forward-blocking region ex-
ists from 
up to a value of 
called the forward-breakover voltage, VBR(F).
This is indicated on the 4-layer diode characteristic curve in Figure 11–4.

VAK = 0 V
As 
is increased from 0, the anode current, 
gradually increases, as shown on the
graph. As 
increases, a point is reached where 
the switching current. At this
point, 
and the internal transistor structures become saturated. When this
happens, the forward voltage drop, 
suddenly decreases to a low value, and the 4-layer
diode enters the forward-conduction region as indicated in Figure 11–4. Now, the device is
in the on state and acts as a closed switch. When the anode current drops back below the
holding value, 
the device turns off.
Holding Current
Once the 4-layer diode is conducting (in the on state), it will continue
to conduct until the anode current is reduced below a specified level, called the holding
current, IH. This parameter is also indicated on the characteristic curve in Figure 11–4.
When 
falls below 
the device rapidly switches back to the off state and enters the
forward-blocking region.
Switching Current
The value of the anode current at the point where the device
switches from the forward-blocking region (off) to the forward-conduction region (on) is
called the switching current, IS. This value of current is always less than the holding
current, IH.

The four-layer diode (also called a
Shockley diode) was invented by
William Shockley while he was at
Bell Labs. Shockley believed the
four-layer diode would revolutionize
telephone switching circuits because
it could replace the mechanical
switches used by the telephone
equipment of the time. In the mid-
1950s, Shockley founded Shockley
Semiconductor Labs with the intent
of constructing silicon transistors
but soon changed the emphasis of
his company to the four-layer diode.
It was difficult to manufacture with
the technology of the time, and
Shockley’s company never managed
to turn a profit. The four-layer diode
eventually evolved into the SCR,
which is essentially a four-layer
diode with an added control gate.

An Application
The circuit in Figure 11–6(a) is a relaxation oscillator. The operation is as follows. When
the switch is closed, the capacitor charges through R until its voltage reaches the forward-
breakover voltage of the 4-layer diode. At this point the diode switches into conduction,
and the capacitor rapidly discharges through the diode. Discharging continues until the
current through the diode falls below the holding value. At this point, the diode switches

11–2 THE SILICON-CONTROLLED RECTIFIER (SCR)
Like the 4-layer diode, the SCR has two possible states of operation. In the off state, it
acts ideally as an open circuit between the anode and the cathode; actually, rather than
an open, there is a very high resistance. In the on state, the SCR acts ideally as a short
from the anode to the cathode; actually, there is a small on (forward) resistance. The
LASCR operates as an SCR except it is triggered by light.

An SCR (silicon-controlled rectifier) is a 4-layer pnpn device similar to the 4-layer
diode except with three terminals: anode, cathode, and gate. The basic structure of an SCR
is shown in Figure 11–7(a), and the schematic symbol is shown in Figure 11–7(b). Typical
SCR packages are shown in Figure 11–7(c). Other types of thyristors are found in the same

Like the 4-layer diode operation, the SCR operation can best be understood by thinking of
its internal pnpn structure as a two-transistor arrangement, as shown in Figure 11–8. This
structure is like that of the 4-layer diode except for the gate connection. The upper pnp layers
act as a transistor, 
, and the lower npn layers act as a transistor,

Turning the SCR On

can be approximated by an open switch, as indicated. When a positive pulse of current
(trigger) is applied to the gate, both transistors turn on (the anode must be more positive
than the cathode). This action is shown in Figure 11–9(b).

Thus, the device stays on (latches) once it is triggered on, as shown in Figure

proximated by a closed switch, as indicated.
Like the 4-layer diode, an SCR can also be turned on without gate triggering by increas-
ing the anode-to-cathode voltage to a value exceeding the forward-breakover voltage
as shown on the characteristic curve in Figure 11–10(a). The forward-breakover
voltage decreases as 
is increased above 0 V, as shown by the set of curves in Figure
11–10(b). Eventually, a value of 
is reached at which the SCR turns on at a very low
anode-to-cathode voltage. So, as you can see, the gate current controls the value of forward
breakover voltage, 
required for turn-on.

Although anode-to-cathode voltages in excess of 
will not damage the device if
current is limited, this situation should be avoided because the normal control of the SCR
is lost. It should normally be triggered on only with a pulse at the gate.
Turning the SCR Off
When the gate returns to 0 V after the trigger pulse is removed, the SCR cannot turn off; it
stays in the forward-conduction region. The anode current must drop below the value of
the holding current, 
in order for turn-off to occur. The holding current is indicated in
Figure 11–10.
There are two basic methods for turning off an SCR: anode current interruption and
forced commutation. The anode current can be interrupted by either a momentary series or
parallel switching arrangement, as shown in Figure 11–11. The series switch in part (a)
simply reduces the anode current to zero and causes the SCR to turn off. The parallel
switch in part (b) routes part of the total current away from the SCR, thereby reducing the
anode current to a value less than 
The forced commutation method basically requires momentarily forcing current
through the SCR in the direction opposite to the forward conduction so that the net forward
current is reduced below the holding value. The basic circuit, as shown in Figure 11–12,
consists of a switch (normally a transistor switch) and a capacitor. While the SCR is con-
ducting, the switch is open and 
is charged to the supply voltage through 
, as shown in
part (a). To turn off the SCR, the switch is closed, placing the capacitor across the SCR and
forcing current through it opposite to the forward current, as shown in part (b). Typically,
turn-off times for SCRs range from a few microseconds up to about 30 ms.

SCR Characteristics and Ratings
Several of the most important SCR characteristics and ratings are defined as follows. Use

This is the voltage at which the SCR enters the
forward-conduction region. The value of

THYRISTORS
Gate trigger current,
This is the value of gate current necessary to switch the
SCR from the forward-blocking region to the forward-conduction region under speci-
fied conditions.
Average forward current,
This is the maximum continuous anode current (dc)
that the device can withstand in the conduction state under specified conditions.
Forward-conduction region
This region corresponds to the on condition of the SCR
where there is forward current from anode to cathode through the very low resistance
(approximate short) of the SCR.
Forward-blocking and reverse-blocking regions
These regions correspond to the off
condition of the SCR where the forward current from anode to cathode is blocked by
the effective open circuit of the SCR.
Reverse-breakdown voltage,
This parameter specifies the value of reverse
voltage from cathode to anode at which the device breaks into the avalanche region
and begins to conduct heavily (the same as in a pn junction diode).
The Light-Activated SCR (LASCR)
The light-activated silicon-controlled rectifier (LASCR) is a four-layer semiconductor de-
vice (thyristor) that operates essentially as does the conventional SCR except that it can
also be light-triggered. The LASCR conducts current in one direction when activated by a
sufficient amount of light and continues to conduct until the current falls below a specified
value. Figure 11–13 shows a LASCR schematic symbol. The LASCR is most sensitive to
light when the gate terminal is open. If necessary, a resistor from the gate to the cathode
can be used to reduce the sensitivity.
Figure 11–14 shows a LASCR used to energize a latching relay. The input source turns
on the lamp; the resulting incident light triggers the LASCR. The anode current energizes
the relay and closes the contact. Notice that the input source is electrically isolated from
the rest of the circuit.

THYRISTORS
The Diac
A diac is a two-terminal four-layer semiconductor device (thyristor) that can conduct cur-
rent in either direction when activated. The basic construction and schematic symbol for a
diac are shown in Figure 11–24. Notice that there are two terminals, labelled 
and 
.
The top and bottom layers contain both n and p materials. The right side of the stack can be
regarded as a pnpn structure with the same characteristics as a four-layer diode, while the
left side is an inverted four-layer diode having an npnp structure.
Conduction occurs in a diac when the breakover voltage is reached with either polarity
across the two terminals. The curve in Figure 11–25 illustrates this characteristic. Once
breakover occurs, current is in a direction depending on the polarity of the voltage across
the terminals. The device turns off when the current drops below the holding value.

11–4 THE DIAC AND TRIAC
Both the diac and the triac are types of thyristors that can conduct current in both
directions (bilateral). The difference between the two devices is that a diac has two ter-
minals, while a triac has a third terminal, which is the gate for triggering. The diac
functions basically like two parallel 4-layer diodes turned in opposite directions. The
triac functions basically like two parallel SCRs turned in opposite directions with a
common gate terminal.

portion of the characteristic curve, as shown in Figure 11–25.
The Triac
A triac is like a diac with a gate terminal. A triac can be turned on by a pulse of gate current
and does not require the breakover voltage to initiate conduction, as does the diac. Basically,
a triac can be thought of simply as two SCRs connected in parallel and in opposite direc-
tions with a common gate terminal. Unlike the SCR, the triac can conduct current in either
direction when it is triggered on, depending on the polarity of the voltage across its 
and
terminals. Figure 11–27 shows the basic construction and schematic symbol for a triac.

ceases to conduct when the anode current drops below the specified value of the holding cur-
rent, 
The only way to turn off the triac is to reduce the current to a sufficiently low level.

Applications
Like the SCR, triacs are also used to control average power to a load by the method of phase
control. The triac can be triggered such that the ac power is supplied to the load for a controlled
portion of each half-cycle. During each positive half-cycle of the ac, the triac is off for a certain
interval, called the delay angle (measured in degrees), and then it is triggered on and conducts
current through the load for the remaining portion of the positive half-cycle, called the
conduction angle. Similar action occurs on the negative half-cycle except that, of course, cur-
rent is conducted in the opposite direction through the load. Figure 11–30 illustrates this action.

val near each 0 crossing where the triac current drops below the holding value, thus turning
the device off.

THYRISTORS
Basic Operation
An SCS (silicon-controlled switch) is a four-terminal thyristor that has two gate terminals
that are used to trigger the device on and off. The symbol and terminal identification for an
SCS are shown in Figure 11–33.
As with the previous thyristors, the basic operation of the SCS can be understood by re-
ferring to the transistor equivalent, shown in Figure 11–34. To start, assume that both 
and 
are off, and therefore that the SCS is not conducting. A positive pulse on the cath-
ode gate drives 
into conduction and thus provides a path for 
base current. When 
turns on, its collector current provides base current for 
, thus sustaining the on state of
the device. This regenerative action is the same as in the turn-on process of the SCR and
the 4-layer diode and is illustrated in Figure 11–34(a).
The SCS can also be turned on with a negative pulse on the anode gate, as indicated in
Figure 11–34(a). This drives 
into conduction which, in turn, provides base current for
. Once 
is on, it provides a path for 
base current, thus sustaining the on state.
To turn the SCS off, a positive pulse is applied to the anode gate. This reverse-biases the
base-emitter junction of 
and turns it off. 
, in turn, cuts off and the SCS ceases con-
duction, as shown in Figure 11–34(b). The device can also be turned off with a negative
pulse on the cathode gate, as indicated in part (b). The SCS typically has a faster turn-off
time than the SCR.

The silicon-controlled switch (SCS) is similar in construction to the SCR. The SCS,
however, has two gate terminals, the cathode gate and the anode gate. The SCS can be
turned on and off using either gate terminal. Remember that the SCR can be only
turned on using its gate terminal. Normally, the SCS is available in power ratings
lower than those of the SCR.

11–6 THE UNIJUNCTION TRANSISTOR (UJT)
The unijunction transistor does not belong to the thyristor family because it does not
have a four-layer type of construction. The term unijunction refers to the fact that
the UJT has a single pn junction. The UJT is useful in certain oscillator applications
and as a triggering device in thyristor circuits.

THYRISTORS
The UJT (unijunction transistor) is a three-terminal device whose basic construction is
shown in Figure 11–36(a). The schematic symbol appears in Figure 11–36(b). Notice the
terminals are labelled Emitter (E), Base 1 
, and Base 2 
. Do not confuse this sym-
bol with that of a JFET; the difference is that the arrow is at an angle for the UJT. The UJT
has only one pn junction, and therefore, the characteristics of this device are different from
those of either the BJT or the FET, as you will see.

A UJT Application
The UJT can be used as a trigger device for SCRs and triacs. Other applications include
nonsinusoidal oscillators, sawtooth generators, phase control, and timing circuits. Figure
11–39 shows a UJT relaxation oscillator as an example of one application.
The operation is as follows. When dc power is applied, the capacitor C charges expo-
nentially through 
until it reaches the peak-point voltage 
At this point, the pn
junction becomes forward-biased, and the emitter characteristic goes into the negative
resistance region 
decreases and 
increases). The capacitor then quickly discharges
through the forward-biased junction, 
, and 
When the capacitor voltage decreases to
the valley-point voltage 
the UJT turns off, the capacitor begins to charge again, and the
cycle is repeated, as shown in the emitter voltage waveform in Figure 11–40 (top). During
the discharge time of the capacitor, the UJT is conducting. Therefore, a voltage is developed
across

THYRISTORS
A PUT (programmable unijunction transistor) is a type of three-terminal thyristor that
is triggered into conduction when the voltage at the anode exceeds the voltage at the gate.
The structure of the PUT is more similar to that of an SCR (four-layer) than to a UJT. The
exception is that the gate is brought out as shown in Figure 11–42. Notice that the gate is
connected to the n region adjacent to the anode. This pn junction controls the on and off
states of the device. The gate is always biased positive with respect to the cathode. When the
anode voltage exceeds the gate voltage by approximately 0.7 V, the pn junction is forward-
biased and the PUT turns on. The PUT stays on until the anode voltage falls back below
this level, then the PUT turns off.

The programmable unijunction transistor (PUT) is actually a type of thyristor and not
like the UJT at all in terms of structure. The only similarity to a UJT is that the PUT can
be used in some oscillator applications to replace the UJT. The PUT is similar to an SCR
except that its anode-to-gate voltage can be used to both turn on and turn off the device.

An Application
A plot of the anode-to-cathode voltage, 
versus anode current, 
in Figure 11–43(b) re-
veals a characteristic curve similar to that of the UJT. Therefore, the PUT replaces the UJT in
many applications. One such application is the relaxation oscillator in Figure 11–44(a).
The basic operation of the PUT is as follows. The gate is biased at +9 V by the voltage
divider consisting of resistors 
and 
When dc power is applied, the PUT is off and the
capacitor charges toward +18 V through 
When the capacitor reaches 
the PUT turns on and the capacitor rapidly discharges through the low on resistance of the
PUT and 
A voltage spike is developed across 
during the discharge. As soon as
the capacitor discharges, the PUT turns off and the charging cycle starts over, as shown by
the waveforms in Figure 11–44(b).

Application Activity: Motor Speed Control
In this application, an SCR and a PUT are used to control the speed of a conveyor belt
motor. The circuit controls the speed of the conveyor so that a predetermined average
number of randomly spaced parts flow past a point on the production line in a specified
period of time. This is to allow an adequate amount of time for the production line workers
to perform certain tasks on each part. A basic diagram of the conveyor speed-control sys-
tem is shown in Figure 11–45.

Each time a part on the moving conveyor belt passes the infrared (IR) detector and
interrupts the IR beam, a digital counter in the processing circuits is advanced by one.
The count of the passing parts is accumulated over a specified period of time and converted
to a proportional voltage by the processing circuits. The more parts that pass the IR detector
during the specified time, the higher the voltage. The proportional voltage is applied to the
motor speed-control circuit which, in turn, adjusts the speed of the electric motor that
drives the conveyor belt in order to maintain the desired number of parts in a specified
period of time.
The Motor Speed-Control Circuit
The proportional voltage from the processing circuits is applied to the gate of a PUT.
This voltage determines the point in the ac cycle at which the SCR is triggered on. For a
higher PUT gate voltage, the SCR turns on later in the half-cycle and therefore delivers
less average power to the motor to decrease its speed. For a lower PUT gate voltage, the
SCR turns on earlier in the half-cycle and delivers more average power to the motor to
increase its speed. This process continually adjusts the motor speed to maintain the
required number of parts per unit time moving on the conveyor. A potentiometer is used
for calibration of the SCR trigger point. The motor speed-control circuit is shown in
Figure 11–46.

THYRISTORS
Answer the following questions using the partial datasheets in Figure 11–47. If sufficient
information doesn’t appear on these datasheets, go to onsemi.com and download the
complete datasheet(s).
1. How much peak voltage can the SCR withstand in the off state?
2. What is the maximum SCR current when it is turned on?
3. What is the maximum power dissipation of the PUT?
Simulation
The motor speed-control circuit is simulated in Multisim with a resistive/inductive load in
place of the motor and a dc voltage source in place of the input from the processing circuit,
as shown in Figure 11–48. The diode is placed across the motor for transient suppression.
4. On the scope display in Figure 11–48 identify when the SCR is conducting.
5. If the control voltage is reduced, will the SCR conduct more or less?
6. If the control voltage is reduced, will the motor speed increase or decrease?
Figure 11–49 shows the results of varying 
. You can see that as the control
voltage is decreased, the SCR conducts for more of the cycle and therefore delivers more
power to the motor to increase its speed.
Simulate the motor speed-control circuit using your Multisim software. Observe how
the SCR voltage changes with changes in 
.
Prototyping and Testing
Now that the circuit has been simulated, the prototype circuit is constructed and tested.
After the circuit is successfully tested on a protoboard, it is ready to be finalized on a

SUMMARY
Section 11–1
◆Thyristors are devices constructed with four semiconductor layers (pnpn).
◆Thyristors include 4-layer diodes, SCRs, LASCRs, diacs, triacs, SCSs, and PUTs.
◆The 4-layer diode is a thyristor that conducts when the voltage across its terminals exceeds the
breakover potential.
Section 11–2
◆The silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) can be triggered on by a pulse at the gate and turned off
by reducing the anode current below the specified holding value.
◆Light acts as the trigger source in light-activated SCRs (LASCRs).
Section 11–4
◆The diac can conduct current in either direction and is turned on when a breakover voltage is
exceeded. It turns off when the current drops below the holding value.
◆The triac, like the diac, is a bidirectional device. It can be turned on by a pulse at the gate and
conducts in a direction depending on the voltage polarity across the two anode terminals.
Section 11–5
◆The silicon-controlled switch (SCS) has two gate terminals and can be turned on by a pulse at
the cathode gate and turned off by a pulse at the anode gate.
Section 11–6
◆The intrinsic standoff ratio of a unijunction transistor (UJT) determines the voltage at which the
device will trigger on.
Section 11–7
◆The programmable unijunction transistor (PUT) can be externally programmed to turn on at a
desired anode-to-gate voltage level.

fier from the PA system in Chapter 7 is modified. The two-
stage preamp portion of the amplifier is replaced by an 
op-amp circuit. The power amplifier portion is retained in its
original configuration with the exception of the drive circuit
so that the new design consists of an op-amp driving a push-
pull power stage. In the original system there are two PC
boards—one for the preamp and one for the power ampli-
fier. The new design will allow both the preamp and the
power amplifier to be on a single PC board.

INTRODUCTION
In the previous chapters, you have studied a number of im-
portant electronic devices. These devices, such as the diode
and the transistor, are separate devices that are individually
packaged and interconnected in a circuit with other devices
to form a complete, functional unit. Such devices are
referred to as discrete components.
Now you will begin the study of linear integrated circuits
(ICs), where many transistors, diodes, resistors, and capaci-
tors are fabricated on a single tiny chip of semiconductive
material and packaged in a single case to form a functional
circuit. An integrated circuit, such as an operational ampli-
fier (op-amp), is treated as a single device. This means that
you will be concerned with what the circuit does more from
an external viewpoint than from an internal, component-
level viewpoint.
In this chapter, you will learn the basics of op-amps,
which are the most versatile and widely used of all linear 
integrated circuits. You will also learn about open-loop and
closed-loop frequency responses, bandwidth, phase shift,
and other frequency-related parameters. The effects of nega-
tive feedback will be examined.

Op-amp symbols and packages.
The standard operational amplifier (op-amp) symbol is shown in Figure 12–1(a). It
has two input terminals, the inverting () input and the noninverting () input, and one
output terminal. Most op-amps operate with two dc supply voltages, one positive and the
other negative, as shown in Figure 12–1(b), although some have a single dc supply.
Usually these dc voltage terminals are left off the schematic symbol for simplicity but are
understood to be there. Some typical op-amp IC packages are shown in Figure 12–1(c). 
12–1 INTRODUCTION TO OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIERS
Early operational amplifiers (op-amps) were used primarily to perform mathematical
operations such as addition, subtraction, integration, and differentiation—thus the
term operational. These early devices were constructed with vacuum tubes and
worked with high voltages. Today’s op-amps are linear integrated circuits (ICs) that
use relatively low dc supply voltages and are reliable and inexpensive.
After completing this section, you should be able to
❏Describe the basic operational amplifier and its characteristics
◆Identify the schematic symbol and IC package terminals
❏Discuss the ideal op-amp
❏Discuss the practical op-amp
◆Draw the internal block diagram
The Ideal Op-Amp
To illustrate what an op-amp is, let’s consider its ideal characteristics. A practical op-amp,
of course, falls short of these ideal standards, but it is much easier to understand and ana-
lyze the device from an ideal point of view.
First, the ideal op-amp has infinite voltage gain and infinite bandwidth. Also, it has an
infinite input impedance (open) so that it does not load the driving source. Finally, it has a
zero output impedance. Op-amp characteristics are illustrated in Figure 12–2(a). The input
voltage, Vin, appears between the two input terminals, and the output voltage is AvVin, as
indicated by the internal voltage source symbol. The concept of infinite input impedance is
The operational amplifier concept
originated around 1947. It was
proposed that such a device would
form an extremely useful analog
building block. The first
commercial op-amps used vacuum
tubes, but it was not until the
introduction of the integrated
circuit did the op-amp start to
fulfill its true potential. In 1964,
the first integrated circuit op-amp,
designated the 702, was developed
by Fairchild Semiconductor. This
was later followed by the 709 and
eventually the 741, which has
become an industry standard.

The Practical Op-Amp
Although integrated circuit (IC) op-amps approach parameter values that can be treated
as ideal in many cases, the ideal device can never be made. Any device has limitations, and
the IC op-amp is no exception. Op-amps have both voltage and current limitations. Peak-
to-peak output voltage, for example, is usually limited to slightly less than the two supply
voltages. Output current is also limited by internal restrictions such as power dissipation
and component ratings.
Characteristics of a practical op-amp are very high voltage gain, very high input imped-
ance, and very low output impedance. These are labelled in Figure 12–2(b). Another practi-
cal consideration is that there is always noise generated within the op-amp. Noise is an
undesired signal that affects the quality of a desired signal. Today, circuit designers are using
smaller voltages that require high accuracy, so low-noise components are in greater demand.
All circuits generate noise; op-amps are no exception, but the amount can be minimized.
Internal Block Diagram of an Op-Amp
A typical op-amp is made up of three types of
amplifier circuits: a differential amplifier, a voltage amplifier, and a push-pull amplifier, as
shown in Figure 12–3. The differential amplifier is the input stage for the op-amp. It pro-
vides amplification of the difference voltage between the two inputs. The second stage is usu-
ally a class A amplifier that provides additional gain. Some op-amps may have more than one
voltage amplifier stage. A push-pull class B amplifier is typically used for the output stage.

OP-AMP INPUT MODES AND PARAMETERS

605
The differential amplifier was introduced in Chapter 6. The term differential comes from
the amplifier’s ability to amplify the difference of two input signals applied to its inputs.
Only the difference in the two signals is amplified; if there is no difference, the output is
zero. The differential amplifier exhibits two modes of operation based on the type of input
signals. These modes are differential and common, which are described in the next section.
Since the differential amplifier is the input stage of the op-amp, the op-amp exhibits the
same modes.

Input Signal Modes
Recall that the input signal modes are determined by the differential amplifier input stage
of the op-amp.
Differential Mode
In the differential mode, either one signal is applied to an input
with the other input grounded or two opposite-polarity signals are applied to the inputs.
When an op-amp is operated in the single-ended differential mode, one input is grounded
and a signal voltage is applied to the other input, as shown in Figure 12–4. In the case
where the signal voltage is applied to the inverting input as in part (a), an inverted, ampli-
fied signal voltage appears at the output. In the case where the signal is applied to the non-
inverting input with the inverting input grounded, as in Figure 12–4(b), a noninverted,
amplified signal voltage appears at the output.

THE OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER
In the double-ended differential mode, two opposite-polarity (out-of-phase) signals
are applied to the inputs, as shown in Figure 12–5(a). The amplified difference between
the two inputs appears on the output. Equivalently, the double-ended differential mode
can be represented by a single source connected between the two inputs, as shown in
Figure 12–5(b).

Common Mode
In the common mode, two signal voltages of the same phase, fre-
quency, and amplitude are applied to the two inputs, as shown in Figure 12–6. When
equal input signals are applied to both inputs, they tend to cancel, resulting in a zero out-
put voltage.
This action is called common-mode rejection. Its importance lies in the situation where
an unwanted signal appears commonly on both op-amp inputs. Common-mode rejection
means that this unwanted signal will not appear on the output and distort the desired signal.
Common-mode signals (noise) generally are the result of the pick-up of radiated energy on
the input lines, from adjacent lines, the 60 Hz power line, or other sources.
Op-Amp Parameters
Common-Mode Rejection Ratio
Desired signals can appear on only one input or with
opposite polarities on both input lines. These desired signals are amplified and appear on
the output as previously discussed. Unwanted signals (noise) appearing with the same po-
larity on both input lines are essentially cancelled by the op-amp and do not appear on the
output. The measure of an amplifier’s ability to reject common-mode signals is a parame-
ter called the CMRR (common-mode rejection ratio).
Ideally, an op-amp provides a very high gain for differential-mode signals and zero gain for
common-mode signals. Practical op-amps, however, do exhibit a very small common-mode

gain (usually much less than 1), while providing a high open-loop differential voltage gain
(usually several thousand). The higher the open-loop gain with respect to the common-mode
gain, the better the performance of the op-amp in terms of rejection of common-mode signals.
This suggests that a good measure of the op-amp’s performance in rejecting unwanted
common-mode signals is the ratio of the open-loop differential voltage gain, Aol, to the
common-mode gain, Acm. This ratio is the common-mode rejection ratio, CMRR.
Equation 12–1
The higher the CMRR, the better. A very high value of CMRR means that the open-loop
gain, Aol, is high and the common-mode gain, Acm, is low.
The CMRR is often expressed in decibels (dB) as
CMRR  Aol
Acm
Equation 12–2
The open-loop voltage gain, Aol, of an op-amp is the internal voltage gain of the de-
vice and represents the ratio of output voltage to input voltage when there are no external
components. The open-loop voltage gain is set entirely by the internal design. Open-loop
voltage gain can range up to 200,000 (106 dB) and is not a well-controlled parameter.
Datasheets often refer to the open-loop voltage gain as the large-signal voltage gain.
A CMRR of 100,000, for example, means that the desired input signal (differential) is
amplified 100,000 times more than the unwanted noise (common-mode). If the amplitudes
of the differential input signal and the common-mode noise are equal, the desired signal
will appear on the output 100,000 times greater in amplitude than the noise. Thus, the
noise or interference has been essentially eliminated.

converter (discussed in Chapter 14). In this case, the op-amp output is designed to operate
between ground and a full scale output that is near (or at) the positive supply voltage. 
Op-amps that operate on a single supply use the terminology VOH and VOL to specify the
maximum and minimum output voltage. (Note that these are not the same as the digital def-
initions of VOL and VOH.)
Input Offset Voltage
The ideal op-amp produces zero volts out for zero volts in. In a
practical op-amp, however, a small dc voltage, VOUT(error), appears at the output when no
differential input voltage is applied. Its primary cause is a slight mismatch of the base-
emitter voltages of the differential amplifier input stage of an op-amp.
As specified on an op-amp datasheet, the input offset voltage, VOS, is the differential dc
voltage required between the inputs to force the output to zero volts. Typical values of
input offset voltage are in the range of 2 mV or less. In the ideal case, it is 0 V.
The input offset voltage drift is a parameter related to VOS that specifies how much
change occurs in the input offset voltage for each degree change in temperature. Typical
values range anywhere from about 
per degree Celsius to about 
per degree
Celsius. Usually, an op-amp with a higher nominal value of input offset voltage exhibits a
higher drift. 
Input Bias Current
You have seen that the input terminals of a bipolar differential am-
plifier are the transistor bases and, therefore, the input currents are the base currents.
The input bias current is the dc current required by the inputs of the amplifier to prop-
erly operate the first stage. By definition, the input bias current is the average of both input
currents and is calculated as follows:

Designers today are “going green”
by reducing power in op-amps and
applications. To reduce power
dissipated by op-amps, lower
voltage supplies can be used as
well as greater reliance on CMOS.
In some cases, CMOS requires only
a few picoamps of bias current,
which helps designers reduce
current in the external circuit.

Input Impedance
Two basic ways of specifying the input impedance of an op-amp are
the differential and the common mode. The differential input impedance is the total resist-
ance between the inverting and the noninverting inputs, as illustrated in Figure 12–8(a).
Differential impedance is measured by determining the change in bias current for a given
change in differential input voltage. The common-mode input impedance is the resistance
between each input and ground and is measured by determining the change in bias current
for a given change in common-mode input voltage. It is depicted in Figure 12–8(b).

Input Offset Current
Ideally, the two input bias currents are equal, and thus their dif-
ference is zero. In a practical op-amp, however, the bias currents are not exactly equal.
The input offset current, IOS, is the difference of the input bias currents, expressed as an
absolute value.
Equation 12–4
Actual magnitudes of offset current are usually at least an order of magnitude (ten times)
less than the bias current. In many applications, the offset current can be neglected.
However, high-gain, high-input impedance amplifiers should have as little IOS as possible
because the difference in currents through large input resistances develops a substantial
offset voltage, as shown in Figure 12–9.

A change in offset current with temperature affects the error voltage. Values of tempera-
ture coefficient for the offset current in the range of 0.5 nA per degree Celsius are common.

Slew Rate
The maximum rate of change of the output voltage in response to a step input
voltage is the slew rate of an op-amp. The slew rate is dependent upon the high-frequency
response of the amplifier stages within the op-amp.
Slew rate is measured with an op-amp connected as shown in Figure 12–11(a). This
particular op-amp connection is a unity-gain, noninverting configuration that will be dis-
cussed in Section 12–4. It gives a worst-case (slowest) slew rate. Recall that the high-
frequency components of a voltage step are contained in the rising edge and that the upper
critical frequency of an amplifier limits its response to a step input. For a step input, the
slope on the output is inversely proportional to the upper critical frequency. Slope in-
creases as upper critical frequency decreases.

THE OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER
A pulse is applied to the input and the resulting ideal output voltage is indicated in
Figure 12–11(b). The width of the input pulse must be sufficient to allow the output to
“slew” from its lower limit to its upper limit. A certain time interval, 
is required for the
output voltage to go from its lower limit

Frequency Response
The internal amplifier stages that make up an op-amp have volt-
age gains limited by junction capacitances, as discussed in Chapter 10. Although the
differential amplifiers used in op-amps are somewhat different from the basic amplifiers
discussed earlier, the same principles apply. An op-amp has no internal coupling capaci-
tors, however; therefore, the low-frequency response extends down to dc (0 Hz).
Noise Specification
Noise has become a more important issue in new circuit designs
because of the requirement to run at lower voltages and with greater accuracy than in
the past. As little as two or three microvolts can create errors in analog-to-digital con-
version. Many sensors produce only tiny voltages that can be masked by noise. As a
result, unwanted noise from op-amps and components can degrade the performance of
circuits.
Noise is defined as an unwanted signal that affects the quality of a desired signal. While
interference from an external source (such as a nearby power line) qualifies as noise, for
the purpose of op-amp specifications, interference is not included. Only noise generated
within the op-amp is considered in the noise specification. When the op-amp is added to a
circuit, additional noise contributions are added from other circuit elements, such as the
feedback resistors or any sensors. For example, all resistors generate thermal noise—even
one sitting in the parts bin. The circuit designer must consider all sources within the
circuit, but the concern here is the op-amp specification for noise, which only considers the
op-amp.
There are two basic forms of noise. At low frequencies, noise is inversely proportional
to the frequency; this is called 1/f noise or “pink noise”. Above a critical noise frequency,
the noise becomes flat and is spread out equally across the frequency spectrum; this is
called “white noise”. The power distribution of noise is measured in watts per hertz
(W/Hz). Power is proportional to the square of the voltage, so noise voltage (density) is
found by taking the square root of the noise power density, resulting in units of volts per
square root hertz 
For operational amplifiers, noise level is normally shown with
units of 
and is specified relative to the input at a specific frequency above the
noise critical frequency. For example, a noise level graph for a very low-noise op-amp is
shown in Figure 12–13; the specification for this op-amp will indicate that the input volt-
age noise density at 1 kHz is 
At low frequencies, the noise level is higher
than this due to the 1/f noise contribution as you can see from the graph.

THE OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER
Comparison of Op-Amp Parameters
Table 12–1 provides a comparison of values showing selected parameters for some repre-
sentative op-amps. As you can see from the table, there is a wide difference in certain spec-
ifications. All designs involve certain compromises, so in order for designers to optimize
one parameter, they must often sacrifice another parameter. Choosing an op-amp for a
particular application depends on which parameters are important to optimize. Parameters
depend on the conditions for which they are measured. For details on any of these specifi-
cations, consult the datasheet.
Most available op-amps have three important features: short-circuit protection, no latch-
up, and input offset nulling. Short-circuit protection keeps the circuit from being damaged if
the output becomes shorted, and the no latch-up feature prevents the op-amp from hanging
up in one output state (high or low voltage level) under certain input conditions. Input offset
nulling is achieved by an external potentiometer that sets the output voltage at precisely zero
with zero input.

Why Use Negative Feedback?
As you can see in Table 12–1, the inherent open-loop voltage gain of a typical op-amp is
very high (usually greater than 100,000). Therefore, an extremely small input voltage
drives the op-amp into its saturated output states. In fact, even the input offset voltage of
the op-amp can drive it into saturation. For example, assume VIN  1 mV and Aol 
100,000. Then,
Since the output level of an op-amp can never reach 100 V, it is driven deep into saturation
and the output is limited to its maximum output levels, as illustrated in Figure 12–15 for
both a positive and a negative input voltage of 1 mV.
The usefulness of an op-amp operated without negative feedback is generally limited to
comparator applications (to be studied in Chapter 13). With negative feedback, the closed-
loop voltage gain (Acl) can be reduced and controlled so that the op-amp can function as a

12–4 OP-AMPS WITH NEGATIVE FEEDBACK
An op-amp can be connected using negative feedback to stabilize the gain and increase
frequency response. Negative feedback takes a portion of the output and applies it
back out of phase with the input, creating an effective reduction in gain. This closed-
loop gain is usually much less than the open-loop gain and independent of it.

Closed-Loop Voltage Gain, Acl
The closed-loop voltage gain is the voltage gain of an op-amp with external feedback.
The amplifier configuration consists of the op-amp and an external negative feedback cir-
cuit that connects the output to the inverting input. The closed-loop voltage gain is deter-
mined by the external component values and can be precisely controlled by them.
Noninverting Amplifier
An op-amp connected in a closed-loop configuration as a noninverting amplifier with a
controlled amount of voltage gain is shown in Figure 12–16. The input signal is applied to
the noninverting (+) input. The output is applied back to the inverting 
input through
the feedback circuit (closed loop) formed by the input resistor Ri and the feedback resistor
Rf. This creates negative feedback as follows. Resistors Ri and Rf form a voltage-divider
circuit, which reduces Vout and connects the reduced voltage Vf to the inverting input. The

The voltage-follower configuration is a special case of the noninverting amplifier where
all of the output voltage is fed back to the inverting 
input by a straight connection, as
shown in Figure 12–19. As you can see, the straight feedback connection has a voltage
gain of 1 (which means there is no gain). The closed-loop voltage gain of a noninverting

The most important features of the voltage-follower configuration are its very high
input impedance and its very low output impedance. These features make it a nearly ideal
buffer amplifier for interfacing high-impedance sources and low-impedance loads. This is
discussed further in Section 12–5.
Inverting Amplifier
An op-amp connected as an inverting amplifier with a controlled amount of voltage gain
is shown in Figure 12–20. The input signal is applied through a series input resistor Ri to
the inverting 
input. Also, the output is fed back through Rf to the same input. The non-
inverting (+) input is grounded.
(-)
At this point, the ideal op-amp parameters mentioned earlier are useful in simplifying the
analysis of this circuit. In particular, the concept of infinite input impedance is of great
value. An infinite input impedance implies zero current at the inverting input. If there is zero
current through the input impedance, then there must be no voltage drop between the
inverting and noninverting inputs. This means that the voltage at the inverting 
input is
zero because the noninverting (+) input is grounded. This zero voltage at the inverting input
terminal is referred to as virtual ground. This condition is illustrated in Figure 12–21(a).
Since there is no current at the inverting input, the current through Ri and the current
through Rf are equal, as shown in Figure 12–21(b).

Certain deviations from the ideal op-amp must be recognized because of their effects
on its operation. Transistors within the op-amp must be biased so that they have the
correct values of base and collector currents and collector-to-emitter voltages. The
ideal op-amp has no input current at its terminals; but in fact, the practical op-amp has
small input bias currents typically in the nA range. Also, small internal imbalances in
the transistors effectively produce a small offset voltage between the inputs. These
nonideal parameters were described in Section 12–2.

Noninverting and Inverting Amplifiers
To compensate for the effect of bias current in
the noninverting amplifier, a resistor Rc is added, as shown in Figure 12–32(a). The com-
pensating resistor value equals the parallel combination of Ri and Rf. The input current cre-
ates a voltage drop across Rc that offsets the voltage across the combination of Ri and Rf,
thus sufficiently reducing the output error voltage. The inverting amplifier is similarly
compensated, as shown in Figure 12–32(b).

Use of a BIFET Op-Amp to Eliminate the Need for Bias Current Compensation
The
BIFET op-amp uses both BJTs and JFETs in its internal circuitry. The JFETs are used as the
input devices to achieve a higher input impedance than is possible with standard BJT
amplifiers. Because of their very high input impedance, BIFETs typically have input bias
currents that are much smaller than in BJT op-amps, thus reducing or eliminating the need
for bias current compensation.
Effect of Input Offset Voltage
The output voltage of an op-amp should be zero when the differential input is zero.
However, there is always a small output error voltage present whose value typically ranges
from microvolts to millivolts. This is due to unavoidable imbalances within the internal op-
amp transistors aside from the bias currents previously discussed. In a negative feedback
configuration, the input offset voltage VIO can be visualized as an equivalent small dc volt-
age source, as illustrated in Figure 12–33 for a voltage-follower. Generally, the output error
voltage due to the input offset voltage is
For the case of the voltage-follower, Acl = 1, so
Input Offset Voltage Compensation
Most integrated circuit op-amps provide a means of compensating for offset voltage. This
is usually done by connecting an external potentiometer to designated pins on the IC package,
as illustrated in Figure 12–34(a) and (b) for a 741 op-amp. The two terminals are labelled
offset null. With no input, the potentiometer is simply adjusted until the output voltage
reads 0, as shown in Figure 12–34(c).

of an op-amp are covered. Open-loop responses relate to an op-amp with no exter-

frequency, and the phase response indicates how the phase shift between the input
and output signal changes with frequency. The open-loop gain, like the 
of a tran-
sistor, varies greatly from one device to the next of the same type and cannot be
depended upon to have a constant value.

is always less than the open-loop gain. The closed-loop voltage gain can be precisely con-
trolled by external component values. The closed-loop response of op-amps is covered in
Section 12–8.
Bandwidth Limitations
In the previous sections, all of the voltage gain expressions were based on the midrange
gain and were considered independent of the frequency. The midrange open-loop gain of
an op-amp extends from zero frequency (dc) up to a critical frequency at which the gain
is 3 dB less than the midrange value. This concept should be familiar from your study of
Chapter 10. Op-amps are dc amplifiers (no capacitive coupling between stages), and
therefore, there is no lower critical frequency. This means that the midrange gain extends
down to zero frequency (dc), and dc voltages are amplified the same as midrange signal
frequencies.
An open-loop response curve (Bode plot) for a certain op-amp is shown in Figure
12–36. Most op-amp datasheets show this type of curve or specify the midrange open-loop
gain. Notice that the curve rolls off (decreases) at 
per decade 
per octave).
The midrange gain is 200,000, which is 106 dB, and the critical (cutoff) frequency is ap-
proximately 10 Hz.

3 dB Open-Loop Bandwidth
Recall from Chapter 10 that the bandwidth of an ac am-
plifier is the frequency range between the points where the gain is 3 dB less than the
midrange gain. In general, the bandwidth equals the upper critical frequency ( fcu) minus
the lower critical frequency ( fcl).
Since fcl for an op-amp is zero, the bandwidth is simply equal to the upper critical
frequency.
BW = fcu - fcl

From now on, we will refer to fcu as simply fc; and we will use open-loop (ol) or closed-
loop (cl) subscript designators, for example, fc(ol).
Unity-Gain Bandwidth
Notice in Figure 12–36 that the gain steadily decreases to a
point where it is equal to unity (1 or 0 dB). The value of the frequency at which this unity
gain occurs is the unity-gain frequency designated fT. fT is also called the unity-gain
bandwidth.
Gain-Versus-Frequency Analysis
The RC lag (low-pass) circuits within an op-amp are responsible for the roll-off in gain as
the frequency increases, just as was discussed for the discrete amplifiers in Chapter 10.
From basic ac circuit theory, the attenuation of an RC lag circuit, such as in Figure 12–37,
is expressed as
Dividing both the numerator and denominator to the right of the equals sign by XC,
The critical frequency of an RC circuit is
Dividing both sides by f gives
Since 
the previous expression can be written as
Substituting this result in the previous equation for Vout/Vin produces the following expres-
sion for the attenuation of an RC lag circuit in terms of frequency:

If an op-amp is represented by a voltage gain element with a gain of Aol(mid) plus a single
RC lag circuit, as shown in Figure 12–38, it is known as a compensated op-amp. The total
open-loop gain of the op-amp is the product of the midrange open-loop gain, Aol(mid), and
the attenuation of the RC circuit.

THE OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER
As you can see from Equation 12–19, the open-loop gain equals the midrange gain
when the signal frequency f is much less than the critical frequency fc and drops off as the
frequency increases. Since fc is part of the open-loop response of an op-amp, we will refer
to it as fc(ol).

quency increases above fc(ol).

Phase Shift
As you know from Chapter 10, an RC circuit causes a propagation delay from input to out-
put, thus creating a phase shift between the input signal and the output signal. An RC lag
circuit such as found in an op-amp stage causes the output signal voltage to lag the input,
as shown in Figure 12–39. From basic ac circuit theory, the phase shift, 
is

THE OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER
Overall Frequency Response
Previously, an op-amp was defined to have a constant roll-off of 
above its
critical frequency. For most op-amps this is the case; for some, however, the situation is more
complex. The more complex IC operational amplifier may consist of two or more cascaded
amplifier stages. The gain of each stage is frequency dependent and rolls off at
above its critical frequency. Therefore, the total response of an op-amp is a
composite of the individual responses of the internal stages. As an example, a three-stage op-
amp is represented in Figure 12–41(a), and the frequency response of each stage is shown in
Figure 12–41(b). As you know, dB gains are added so that the total op-amp frequency re-
sponse is as shown in Figure 12–41(c). Since the roll-off rates are additive, the total roll-off
rate increases by 
as each critical frequency is reached.

Overall Phase Response
In a multistage amplifier, each stage contributes to the total phase lag. As you have seen,
each RC lag circuit can produce up to a 
phase shift. Since each stage in an op-amp
includes an RC lag circuit, a three-stage op-amp, for example, can have a maximum phase
lag of 
Also, the phase lag of each stage is less than 
when the frequency is
below the critical frequency, equal to 
at the critical frequency, and greater than 
when the frequency is above the critical frequency. The phase lags of the stages of an op-amp
are added to produce a total phase lag, according to the following formula for three stages:

12–21 in “Derivations of Selected Equations” at www.pearsonhighered.com/floyd.
Since fc(cl) equals the bandwidth for the closed-loop amplifier, the closed-loop band-
width (BWcl) is also increased by the same factor.

CLOSED-LOOP FREQUENCY RESPONSE
◆
635
The closed-loop gain is independent of the open-loop gain up to the point of intersection of
the two gain curves. This point of intersection is the critical frequency, fc(cl), for the closed-
loop response. Notice that the closed-loop gain has the same roll-off rate as the open-loop
gain, beyond the closed-loop critical frequency.
Gain-Bandwidth Product
An increase in closed-loop gain causes a decrease in the bandwidth and vice versa, such
that the product of gain and bandwidth is a constant. This is true as long as the roll-off rate
is fixed, as in the case of a compensated op-amp. If you let Acl represent the gain of any of
the closed-loop configurations and fc(cl) represent the closed-loop critical frequency (same
as the bandwidth), then
The gain-bandwidth product is always equal to the frequency at which the op-amp’s
open-loop gain is unity or 0 dB (unity-gain bandwidth, fT).

THE OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER
In the basic op-amp configurations, there are only a few external components that can
fail. These are the feedback resistor, the input resistor, and the potentiometer used for off-
set voltage compensation. Also, of course, the op-amp itself can fail or there can be faulty
contacts in the circuit. Let’s examine the three basic configurations for possible faults and
the associated symptoms.
The first thing to do when you suspect a faulty circuit is to check for the proper supply
voltage and ground at the pins of the op-amp. Having done that, several other possible
faults are as follows. A visual inspection should also be done.
Faults in the Noninverting Amplifier
Open Feedback Resistor
If the feedback resistor, Rf, in Figure 12–44 opens, the op-amp is
operating with its very high open-loop gain, which causes the input signal to drive the device
into nonlinear operation and results in a severely clipped output signal as shown in part (a).
Related Problem
Determine the bandwidth of each of the amplifiers in Figure 12–43. Both op-amps
have an Aol of 90 dB and a unity-gain bandwidth of 2 MHz.

Measure the bandwidth of each amplifier using the Bode plotter and compare with
the calculated values.
1. Is the closed-loop gain always less than the open-loop gain?
2. A certain op-amp is used in a feedback configuration having a gain of 30 and a band-
width of 100 kHz. If the external resistor values are changed to increase the gain to
60, what is the new bandwidth?
3. What is the unity-gain bandwidth of the op-amp in Question 2?

CHECKUP
12–9 TROUBLESHOOTING
As a technician, you may encounter situations in which an op-amp or its associated
circuitry has malfunctioned. The op-amp is a complex integrated circuit with many
types of internal failures possible. However, since you cannot troubleshoot the op-amp
internally, treat it as a single device with only a few connections to it. If it fails, replace
it just as you would a resistor, capacitor, or transistor.
After completing this section, you should be able to
❏Troubleshoot op-amp circuits
❏Determine faults in the noninverting amplifier
❏Determine faults in the voltage-follower
❏Determine faults in the inverting amplifier

Selected sections from Chapter 18 may be introduced as part of this troubleshooting
coverage or, optionally, the entire chapter 18 may be covered later or not at all.

TROUBLESHOOTING

637
Open Input Resistor
In this case, you still have a closed-loop configuration. Since Ri is
open and effectively equal to infinity 
the closed-loop gain from Equation 12–8 is
This shows that the amplifier acts like a voltage-follower. You would observe an output
signal that is the same as the input, as indicated in Figure 12–44(b).
Internally Open Noninverting Op-Amp Input
In this situation, because the input volt-
age is not applied to the op-amp, the output is zero. This is indicated in Figure 12–44(c).
Other Op-Amp Faults
In general, an internal failure will result in a loss or distortion of
the output signal. The best approach is to first make sure that there are no external failures
or faulty conditions. If everything else is good, then the op-amp must be bad.
Faults in the Voltage-Follower
The voltage-follower is a special case of the noninverting amplifier. Except for a faulty op-
amp, an open or shorted external connection, or a problem with the offset null potentiome-
ter, about the only thing that can happen in a voltage-follower circuit is an open feedback
loop. This would have the same effect as an open feedback resistor as previously discussed.
Faults in the Inverting Amplifier
Open Feedback Resistor
If Rf opens, as indicated in Figure 12–45(a), the input signal
still feeds through the input resistor and is amplified by the high open-loop gain of the op-
amp. This forces the device to be driven into nonlinear operation, and you will see an out-
put something like that shown. This is a similar result as in the noninverting amplifier
configuration.

The Circuit
The schematic of the new op-amp design is shown in Figure 12–47. A 741 operational
amplifier is used for the preamp stage. The power amplifier retains the original push-pull
complementary Darlington configuration with the exception of the driver stage. This has
been eliminated because the op-amp, with its very low output resistance, is capable of
driving the push-pull power amplifier stage without a buffer interface. The rheostat, Rgain,
is for adjusting the voltage gain, and the potentiometer, Rnull, is for output nulling (making
the dc output 0 V).
1. Identify the op-amp configuration.
2. Calculate the maximum and minimum voltage gains of the op-amp.
3. What is the maximum rms output of the op-amp stage if the input is 50 mV rms?
4. Determine the ideal maximum power delivered by the audio amplifier to an 
speaker.

THE OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER
Simulate the op-amp audio amplifier using your Multisim software. Observe the
signal voltages with the oscilloscope.
Prototyping and Testing
Now that the circuit has been simulated, the prototype circuit is constructed and tested.
After the circuit is successfully tested on a protoboard, it is ready to be finalized on a
printed circuit board.
To build and test a similar circuit, go to Experiment 12–A in your lab manual
(Laboratory Exercises for Electronic Devices by David Buchla and Steven
Wetterling).
The original system had two boards, the preamp board and the power amp board. By
using the new op-amp design, the audio amplifier is simplified to one board, as shown in
Figure 12–50.
11. Check the printed circuit board for correctness by comparing it with the
schematic in Figure 12–47.
12. Label each input and output pin according to function.

Programmable Analog Technology
FPAAs (field-programmable analog arrays) and dpASPs (dynamically programmable analog
signal processors) are based on switched-capacitor technology that was covered in Chapter 9.
These are integrated circuit devices that can be programmed with software for various types of
analog functions and designs. Both the FPAA and the dpASP can be reprogrammed, but the
FPAA is statically reconfigurable and must first be reset whereas the dpASP can be dynami-
cally reconfigured “on-the-fly” while operating in a system. The software allows you to experi-
ment and design with various analog devices that are covered in this textbook by specifying 
parameters, observing operation, interconnecting devices for more complex circuits, and prepar-
ing the software for downloading to an actual device. Refer to the tutorial available with the
AnadigmDesigner®2 software or the tutorial in the Laboratory Exercises for Electronic Devices
lab manual.

The Designer2 software differs in its primary purpose from the Multisim software you have
been using. Electronic Workbench Multisim is basically a simulation software that allows you to
test circuits on the computer using simulated discrete and integrated components. The Multisim
software is useful for verifying that a circuit actually works as intended, but it has limited hardware
interface capability. AnadigmDesigner2 is both a simulation and a hardware interface tool that
allows you to custom program an analog design and implement it in an integrated circuit chip. It is
based on an extensive library of analog functions called configurable analog modules (CAMs) that
can be connected using a simple “drag-and drop” format and tested with virtual instruments on the
computer. The design can then be converted to hardware by downloading it to an actual FPAA or
dpASP IC chip.
A free trial version of the AnadigmDesigner2 software is available for downloading at www.
anadigm.com. The basic steps in implementing a design are as follows using a specific CAM for
illustration. These steps apply to any CAM or multiple CAMs.
CAM Selection
The first step in implementing a programmable analog design is to open the AnadigmDesigner2
software. The representation of a blank FPAA or dpASP chip will appear as shown in Figure
12–52. Select the Configure icon to open a list of available CAMs, as shown in Figure 12–53.
Configure and Place CAM
Select the desired CAM and set up the parameters in the Set CAM Parameters screen shown in
Figure 12–54. Next place the CAM in the chip outline and connect to an input and output, as shown
in Figure 12–55. Several CAMs can be placed in one chip and interconnected.
