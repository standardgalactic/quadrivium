and Follicle Maturation

Common Axis 
In males & females, GnRH secretion is pulsatile. 
 
Local secretion of testosterone is needed for development of ovum (female) and of sperm (male).   
 
Inhibin B decreases FSH secretion. Sex hormones regulate GnRH, LH and FSH.

The Roles of the Ovary 

Germ cells (oocytes) are generated in 
embryogenesis (10-20 milllion per ovary at 
birth). 
 
400-500 oocytes actually mature to ovulation. 
Oocyte Number  

Oocyte Maturation  
Estrogen increases the number of LH receptors -positive feedback 
As follicle matures, the follicle produces more and more estrogen 
In addition, the number of LH and FSH receptors increases, making the follicle 
more sensitive to their effects

Key Concepts 
Differentiation of germ cells as well as synthesis and  secretion of 
sex hormones are the common functions of the ovaries and 
testes. 
 
FSH and LH govern germ cell maturation and sex steroid 
hormone production in both males and females.  
 
As the chosen follicle matures, it produces estrogen which 
increases its own sensitivity to LH (and FSH) and reduces the 
amount of FSH released by the pituitary. The reduction in FSH 
leads to the death of less mature follicles. 
 
In females, a second group of kisspeptin neurons is responsible 
for the ability of estrogen to cause the LH surge.
